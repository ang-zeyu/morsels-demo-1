'Brackton,' he said, sharp-like, 'is Bostil goin' to pull a gun on me  at sight?' 'Reckon he is,' I told him. 'Wal, I'm not powerful glad to  know thet.... I hear Creech's blue hoss will race the King this time.  How about it?' 'Sure an' certain this year. I've Creech's an' Bostil's  word for thet.' Cordts put his hand on my shoulder. You ought to 've  seen his eyes!...'I want to see thet race.... I'm goin' to.' 'Wal,' I  said, 'you'll have to stop bein'--You'll need to change your bizness.'  Then, Bostil, what do you think? Cordts was sort of eager an' wild. He  said thet was a race he jest couldn't miss. He swore he wouldn't turn a  trick or let a man of his gang stir a hand till after thet race, if  you'd let him come.\"    A light flitted across Bostil's face.    \"I know how Cordts feels,\" he said.    \"Wal, it's a queer deal,\" went on Brackton. \"Fer a long time you've  meant to draw on Cordts when you meet. We all know thet.\"    \"Yes, I'll kill him!\" The light left Bostil's face. His voice sounded  differently. His mouth opened, drooped strangely at the corners, then  shut in a grim, tense line. Bostil had killed more than one man. The  memory, no doubt, was haunting and ghastly.    \"Cordts seemed to think his word was guarantee of his good faith. He  said he'd send an Indian in here to find out if he can come to the  races. I reckon, Bostil, thet it wouldn't hurt none to let him come.  An' hold your gun hand fer the time he swears he'll be honest. Queer  deal, ain't it, men? A hoss-thief turnin' honest jest to see a race!  Beats me! Bostil, it's a cheap way to get at least a little honesty  from Cordts. An' refusin' might rile him bad. When all's said Cordts  ain't as bad as he could be.\"    \"I'll let him come,\" replied Bostil, breathing deep. \"But it'll be hard  to see him, rememberin' how he's robbed me, an' what he's threatened.  An' I ain't lettin' him come to bribe a few weeks' decency from him.  I'm doin' it for only one reason.... Because I know how he loves the  King--how he wants to see the King run away from the field thet day!  Thet's why!\"    There was a moment of silence, during which all turned to Creech. He  was a stalwart man, no longer young, with a lined face, deep-set,  troubled eyes, and white, thin beard.    \"Bostil, if Cordts loves the King thet well, he's in fer heartbreak,\"  said Creech, with a ring in his voice.    Down crashed Bostil's heavy boots and fire flamed in his gaze. The  other men laughed, and Brackton interposed:    \"Hold on, you boy riders!\" he yelled. \"We ain't a-goin' to have any  arguments like thet.... Now, Bostil, it's settled, then? You'll let  Cordts come?\"    \"Glad to have him,\" replied Bostil.    \"Good. An' now mebbe we'd better get down to the bizness of this here  meetin'.\"    They seated themselves around the table, upon which Bostil laid an old  and much-soiled ledger and a stub of a lead-pencil.    \"First well set the time,\" he said, with animation, \"an' then pitch  into details.... What's the date?\"    No one answered, and presently they all looked blankly from one to the  other.    \"It's April, ain't it?\" queried Holley.    That assurance was as close as they could get to the time of year.    \"Lucy!\" called Bostil, in a loud voice.    She came running in, anxious, almost alarmed.    \"Goodness! you made us jump! What on earth is the matter?\"    \"Lucy, we want to know the date,\" replied Bostil.    \"Date! Did you have to scare Auntie and me out of our wits just for  that?\"    \"Who scared you? This is important, Lucy. What's the date?\"    \"It's a week to-day since last Tuesday,\" answered Lucy, sweetly.    \"Huh! Then it's Tuesday again,\" said Bostil, laboriously writing it  down. \"Now, what's the date?\"    \"Don't you remember?\"    \"Remember? I never knew.\"    \"Dad! ... Last Tuesday was my birthday--the day you DID NOT give me a  horse!\"    \"Aw, so it was,\" rejoined Bostil, confused at her reproach. \"An' thet  date was--let's see--April sixth.... Then this is April thirteenth.  Much obliged, Lucy. Run back to your aunt now. This hoss talk won't  interest you.\"    Lucy tossed her head. \"I'll bet I'll have to straighten out the whole  thing.\" Then with a laugh she disappeared.    \"Three days beginnin--say June first. June first--second, an' third.  How about thet for the races?\"    Everybody agreed, and Bostil laboriously wrote that down. Then they  planned the details. Purses and prizes, largely donated by Bostil and  Muncie, the rich members of the community, were recorded. The old rules  were adhered to. Any rider or any Indian could enter any horse in any  race, or as many horses as he liked in as many races. But by winning  one race he excluded himself from the others. Bostil argued for a  certain weight in riders, but the others ruled out this suggestion.  Special races were arranged for the Indians, with saddles, bridles,  blankets, guns as prizes.    All this appeared of absorbing interest to Bostil. He perspired freely.  There was a gleam in his eye, betraying excitement. When it came to  arranging the details of the big race between the high-class racers,  then he grew intense and harder to deal with. Many points had to go by  vote. Muncie and Williams both had fleet horses to enter in this race;  Holley had one; Creech had two; there were sure to be several Indians  enter fast mustangs; and Bostil had the King and four others to choose  from. Bostil held out stubbornly for a long race. It was well known  that Sage King was unbeatable in a long race. If there were any chance  to beat him it must be at short distance. The vote went against Bostil,  much to his chagrin, and the great race was set down for two miles.    \"But two miles! ... Two miles!\" he kept repeating. \"Thet's Blue Roan's  distance. Thet's his distance. An' it ain't fair to the King!\"    His guests, excepting Creech, argued with him, explained, reasoned,  showed him that it was fair to all concerned. Bostil finally  acquiesced, but he was not happy. The plain fact was that he was  frightened.    When the men were departing Bostil called Creech back into the  sitting-room. Creech appeared surprised, yet it was evident that he  would have been glad to make friends with Bostil.    \"What'll you take for the roan?\" Bostil asked, tersely,' as if he had  never asked that before.    \"Bostil, didn't we thresh thet out before--an' FELL out over it?\"  queried Creech, with a deprecating spread of his hands.    \"Wal, we can fall in again, if you'll sell or trade the hoss.\"    \"I'm sorry, but I can't.\"    \"You need money an' hosses, don't you?\" demanded Bostil, brutally. He  had no conscience in a matter of horse-dealing.    \"Lord knows, I do,\" replied Creech.    \"Wal, then, here's your chance. I'll give you five hundred in gold an'  Sarchedon to boot.\"    Creech looked as if he had not heard aright. Bostil repeated the offer.    \"No,\" replied Creech.    \"I'll make it a thousand an' throw Plume in with Sarch,\" flashed Bostil.    \"No!\" Creech turned pale and swallowed hard.    \"Two thousand an' Dusty Ben along with the others?\" This was an  unheard-of price to pay for any horse. Creech saw that Bostil was  desperate. It was an almost overpowering temptation. Evidently Creech  resisted it only by applying all his mind to the thought of his  clean-limbed, soft-eyed, noble horse.    Bostil did not give Creech time to speak. \"Twenty-five hundred an' Two  Face along with the rest!\"    \"My God, Bostil--stop it! I can't PART with Blue Roan. You're rich an'  you've no heart. Thet I always knew. At least to me you never had,  since I owned them two racers. Didn't I beg you, a little time back, to  lend me a few hundred? To meet thet debt? An' you wouldn't, unless I'd  sell the hosses. An' I had to lose my sheep. Now I'm a poor  man--gettin' poorer all the time. But I won't sell or trade Blue Roan,  not for all you've got!\"    Creech seemed to gain strength with his speech and passion with the  strength. His eyes glinted at the hard, paling face of his rival. He  raised a clenching fist.    \"An' by G--d, I'm goin' to win thet race!\"    During that week Lucy had heard many things about Joel Creech, and some  of them were disquieting.    Some rider had not only found Joel's clothes on the trail, but he had  recognized the track of the horse Lucy rode, and at once connected her  with the singular discovery. Coupling that with Joel's appearance in  the village incased in a heaving armor of adobe, the riders guessed  pretty close to the truth. For them the joke was tremendous. And Joel  Creech was exceedingly sensitive to ridicule. The riders made life  unbearable for him. They had fun out of it as long as Joel showed signs  of taking the joke manfully, which was not long, and then his  resentment won their contempt. That led to sarcasm on their part and  bitter anger on his. It came to Lucy's ears that Joel began to act and  talk strangely. She found out that the rider Van had knocked Joel down  in Brackton's store and had kicked a gun out of his hand. Van laughed  off the rumor and Brackton gave her no satisfaction. Moreover, she  heard no other rumors. The channels of gossip had suddenly closed to  her. Bostil, when questioned by Lucy, swore in a way that amazed her,  and all he told her was to leave Creech alone. Finally, when Muncie  discharged Joel, who worked now and then, Lucy realized that something  was wrong with Joel and that she was to blame for it.    She grew worried and anxious and sorry, but she held her peace, and  determined to find out for herself what was wrong. Every day when she  rode out into the sage she expected to meet him, or at least see him  somewhere; nevertheless days went by and there was no sign of him.    One afternoon she saw some Indians driving sheep down the river road  toward the ford, and, acting upon impulse, she turned her horse after  them.    Lucy seldom "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20660"],[0,"The Faith of Islam (#6)"],[1," of As-Shafi'i for learning is a liar.\" Having carefully  studied the systems of the two preceding Imams he then proceeded on an  eclectic system to form his own. It was a reaction against the system of  Abu Hanifa. As-Shafi'i follows rather the traditional plan of Ibn Malik.  The Hanifite will be satisfied if, in the absence of a clear and a direct  statement, he finds one {22} passage in the Quran, or one Tradition from  which the required judgment may be deduced. The Shafi'ite in the same  circumstances, if Tradition is the source of his deduction, will require a  considerable number of Traditions from which to make it.    Imam Ibn Hanbal was the last of the four Orthodox Imams. He was born at  Baghdad (A.H. 164). His system is a distinct return to Traditionalism. He  lived at Baghdad during the reign of the Khalif Mamun, when Orthodox Islam  seemed in danger of being lost amid the rationalistic speculations, (that  is, from an Orthodox Muslim stand-point), and licentious practices of the  Court. The jurists most in favour at Court were followers of Abu Hanifa.  They carried the principle of analogical deduction to dangerous lengths in  order to satisfy the latitudinarianism of the Khalif. Human speculation  seemed to be weakening all the essentials of the Faith. Ibn Hanbal met the  difficulty by discarding altogether the principle of analogical deduction.  At the same time he saw that the Maliki system, founded as it was on the  \"Customs of Madina,\" was ill-suited to meet the wants of a great and  growing Empire. It needed to be supplemented. What better, what surer  ground could he go upon than the Traditions. These at least were inspired,  and thus formed a safer foundation on which to build a system of  jurisprudence than the analogical deductions of Abu Hanifa did. The system  of Ibn Hanbal has almost ceased to exist. There is now no Mufti of this  sect at Mecca, though the other three are represented there. Still his  influence is felt to this day in the importance he attached to Tradition.    The distinction between the four Imams has been put in this way. Abu Hanifa  exercised his own judgment. Malik and Hanbal preferred authority and  precedent. As-Shafi'i entirely repudiated reason. They differ, too, as  regards the value of certain Traditions, but to each of them an authentic  Tradition is an incontestable authority. Their {23} opinion on points of  doctrine and practice forms the third basis of the Faith.    The Ijma' of the four Imams is a binding law upon all Sunnis. It might be  supposed that as the growing needs of the Empire led to the formation of  these schools of interpretation; so now the requirements of modern, social  and political life might be met by fresh Imams making new analogical  deductions. This is not the case. The orthodox belief is, that since the  time of the four Imams there has been no Mujtahid who could do as they did.  If circumstances should arise which absolutely require some decision to be  arrived at, it must be given in full accordance with the 'mazhab,' or  school of interpretation, to which the person framing the decision  belongs.[29] This effectually prevents all change, and by excluding  innovation, whether good or bad, keeps Islam stationary. Legislation is now  purely deductive. Nothing must be done contrary to the principles contained  in the jurisprudence of the four Imams. \"Thus, in any Muhammadan State  legislative reforms are simply impossible. There exists no initiative. The  Sultan, or Khalif can claim the allegiance of his people only so long as he  remains the exact executor of the prescriptions of the Law.\"    The question then as regards the politics of the \"Eastern {24} Question\" is  not whether Muhammad was a deceiver or self-deceived, an apostle or an  impostor; whether the Quran is on the whole good or bad; whether Arabia was  the better or the worse for the change Muhammad wrought; but what Islam as  a religious and political system has become and is, how it now works, what  Orthodox Muslims believe and how they act in that belief. The essence of  that belief is, that the system as taught by Prophet, Khalifs and Imams is  absolutely perfect.[30] Innovation is worse than a mistake. It is a crime,  a sin. This completeness, this finality of his system of religion and  polity, is the very pride and glory of a true Muslim. To look for an  increase of light in the knowledge of his relation to God and the unseen  world, in the laws which regulate Islam on earth is to admit that  Muhammad's revelation was incomplete, and that admission no Muslim will  make.    It has been stated on high authority that all that is required for the  reform of Turkey is that the Qanuns or orders of the Sultan should take the  place of the Shari'at or law of Islam. Precisely so; if this could be done,  Turkey might be reformed; but Islam would cease to be the religion of the  State. That the law as formulated by the Imam Abu Hanifa ill suits the  conditions of modern life is more than probable; but it is the very  function of the Khalif of Islam, {25} which the Sultan claims to be, to  maintain it. He is no Mujtahid, for such there are not now amongst the  Sunnis, to which sect the Turks belong. If through stress of circumstances  some new law must be made, orthodoxy demands that it should be strictly in  accordance with the opinions of the Imams. The Shia'hs, in opposition to  the Sunnis, hold that there are still Mujtahidin, but this opinion arises  from their peculiar doctrine of the Imamat, a subject we shall discuss a  little later on. At first sight it would seem that if there can be  Mujtahidin who are now able to give authoritative opinions, there may be  some hope of enlightened progress amongst Shia'h people--the Persians for  example. There is doubtless amongst them more religious unrest, more  mysticism, more heresy, but they are no further on the road of progress  than their neighbours; and the apparent advantage of the presence of a  Mujtahid is quite nullified by the fact that all his decisions must be  strictly in accordance with the Quran and the Sunnat, or rather with what  to the Shia'h stands in the place of the Sunnat. The Shia'h, as well as the  Sunni, must base all legislation on the fossilized system of the past, not  on the living needs of the present. Precedent rules both with an iron sway.  The Wahhabis reject all Ijma' except that of the Companions, but that they  accept; so when they are called the Puritans of Islam, it must be  remembered that they accept as a rule of faith not only the Quran, but the  Sunnat, and some Ijma'.    In order to make Ijma' binding, it is necessary that the Mujtahidin should  have been unanimous in their opinion or in their practice.    The whole subject of Ijtihad is one of the most important in connection  with the possibility of reforms in a Muslim state. A modern Muhammadan  writer[31] seeking to show that Islam does possess a capacity for progress  and that so far from being a hard and fast system, it is able to adapt  itself to new circumstances, because the Prophet ushered in {26} \"an age of  active principles,\" uses the story I have already related when describing  the origin of Ijtihad (Ante. p. 17) to prove the accuracy of his statement.  He makes Mu'az to say:--\"I will look first to the Quran, then to precedents  of the Prophet, and lastly rely upon my _own judgment_.\" It is true that  Ijtihad literally means 'great effort,' it is true that the Companions and  Mujtahidin of the first class had the power of exercising their judgment in  doubtful cases, and of deciding them according to their sense of the  fitness of things, provided always, that their decision contravened no law  of the Quran or the Sunnat; but this in no way proves that Islam has any  capacity for progress, or that \"an age of active principles\" was ushered in  by Muhammad, or that his \"words breathe energy and force, and infuse new  life into the dormant heart of humanity.\" For, though the term Ijtihad  might, in reference to the men I have mentioned, be somewhat freely  translated as \"one's own judgment,\" it can have no such meaning now. It is  a purely technical term, and its use and only use now is to express the  \"referring of a difficult case to some analogy drawn from the Quran and the  Sunnat.\" But even were the meaning not thus restricted, even though it  meant now as it sometimes meant at first, \"one's own judgment;\" still Syed  Amir 'Ali's position would remain to be proved for, since the days of the  four Imams, the orthodox believe that there has been no Mujtahid of the  first class, and to none but men of this rank has such power ever been  accorded. Thus granting, for the sake of argument merely, that the Syed's  translation is grammatically and technically correct, all that results from  it is that the \"age of active principles\" lasted only for two centuries. I  do not admit that there ever was such an age in Islam, and certainly  neither its theological development, nor its political growth negative the  opposite assertion, _viz._, that Muhammad gave precepts rather than  principles. The Turks are included in \"the dormant heart of humanity,\" but  it is difficult to see what \"energy and {27} force\" is breathed, what \"new  life is infused\" into them by the \"wonderful words\" of the Prophet, or what  lasting good the \"age of active principles\" has produced.    4. QIAS is the fourth foundation of Islam. The word literally means  reasoning, comparing. It is in common use in Hindustani and Persian in the  sense of guessing, considering, &c. Technically, it means the analogical  reasoning of the learned with regard to the teaching of the Quran, the  Sunnat and the Ijma'. For example, the Quran says:--\"Honour thy father and  thy mother and be not a cause of displeasure to them.\" It is evident from  this that disobedience to parents is prohibited, and prohibition implies  punishment if the order is disobeyed. Again, if the"]]]
