But perhaps the most remarkable example  of Syrian art we possess is the king's gate recently discovered at  Carchemish.(2) The presence of the hieroglyphic inscriptions points to  the survival of Hittite tradition, but the figures represented in  the reliefs are of Aramaean, not Hittite, type. Here the king is seen  leading his eldest son by the hand in some stately ceremonial, and  ranged in registers behind them are the younger members of the royal  family, whose ages are indicated by their occupations.(3) The employment  of basalt in place of limestone does not disguise the sculptor's debt  to Assyria. But the design is entirely his own, and the combined dignity  and homeliness of the composition are refreshingly superior to the  arrogant spirit and hard execution which mar so much Assyrian work. This  example is particularly instructive, as it shows how a borrowed art may  be developed in skilled hands and made to serve a purpose in complete  harmony with its new environment.         (1) _Collection de Clercq_, t. II, pl. xxxvi. The stele is       sculptured in relief with the figure of a North Syrian god.       Here the winged disk is Egyptian, as well as the god's       helmet with uraeus, and his loin-cloth; his attitude and his       supporting lion are Hittite; and the lozenge-mountains, on       which the lion stands, and the technique of the carving are       Assyrian. But in spite of its composite character the design       is quite successful and not in the least incongruous.         (2) Hogarth, _Carchemish_, Pt. I (1914), pl. B. 7 f.         (3) Two of the older boys play at knuckle-bones, others whip       spinning-tops, and a little naked girl runs behind       supporting herself with a stick, on the head of which is       carved a bird. The procession is brought up by the queen-       mother, who carries the youngest baby and leads a pet lamb.    Such monuments surely illustrate the adaptability of the Semitic  craftsman among men of Phoenician and Aramaean strain. Excavation in  Palestine has failed to furnish examples of Hebrew work. But Hebrew  tradition itself justifies us in regarding this _trait_ as of more  general application, or at any rate as not repugnant to Hebrew thought,  when it relates that Solomon employed Tyrian craftsmen for work upon the  Temple and its furniture; for Phoenician art was essentially Egyptian in  its origin and general character. Even Eshmun-'zar's desire for burial  in an Egyptian sarcophagus may be paralleled in Hebrew tradition of  a much earlier period, when, in the last verse of Genesis,(1) it is  recorded that Joseph died, \"and they embalmed him, and he was put in a  coffin in Egypt\". Since it formed the subject of prophetic denunciation,  I refrain for the moment from citing the notorious adoption of Assyrian  customs at certain periods of the later Judaean monarchy. The two  records I have referred to will suffice, for we have in them cherished  traditions, of which the Hebrews themselves were proud, concerning the  most famous example of Hebrew religious architecture and the burial of  one of the patriarchs of the race. A similar readiness to make use of  the best available resources, even of foreign origin, may on analogy be  regarded as at least possible in the composition of Hebrew literature.         (1) Gen. l. 26, assigned by critics to E.    We shall see that the problems we have to face concern the possible  influence of Babylon, rather than of Egypt, upon Hebrew tradition. And  one last example, drawn from the later period, will serve to demonstrate  how Babylonian influence penetrated the ancient world and has even left  some trace upon modern civilization. It is a fact, though one perhaps  not generally realized, that the twelve divisions on the dials of  our clocks and watches have a Babylonian, and ultimately a Sumerian,  ancestry. For why is it we divide the day into twenty-four hours? We  have a decimal system of reckoning, we count by tens; why then should we  divide the day and night into twelve hours each, instead of into ten or  some multiple of ten? The reason is that the Babylonians divided the day  into twelve double-hours; and the Greeks took over their ancient system  of time-division along with their knowledge of astronomy and passed it  on to us. So if we ourselves, after more than two thousand years, are  making use of an old custom from Babylon, it would not be surprising if  the Hebrews, a contemporary race, should have fallen under her influence  even before they were carried away as captives and settled forcibly upon  her river-banks.    We may pass on, then, to the site from which our new material has been  obtained--the ancient city of Nippur, in central Babylonia. Though the  place has been deserted for at least nine hundred years, its ancient  name still lingers on in local tradition, and to this day _Niffer_ or  _Nuffar_ is the name the Arabs give the mounds which cover its extensive  ruins. No modern town or village has been built upon them or in their  immediate neighbourhood. The nearest considerable town is Diwaniyah, on  the left bank of the Hillah branch of the Euphrates, twenty miles to the  south-west; but some four miles to the south of the ruins is the village  of Suq el-'Afej, on the eastern edge of the 'Afej marshes, which begin  to the south of Nippur and stretch away westward. Protected by its  swamps, the region contains a few primitive settlements of the wild  'Afej tribesmen, each a group of reed-huts clustering around the mud  fort of its ruling sheikh. Their chief enemies are the Shammar, who  dispute with them possession of the pastures. In summer the marshes near  the mounds are merely pools of water connected by channels through  the reed-beds, but in spring the flood-water converts them into a vast  lagoon, and all that meets the eye are a few small hamlets built on  rising knolls above the water-level. Thus Nippur may be almost isolated  during the floods, but the mounds are protected from the waters'  encroachment by an outer ring of former habitation which has slightly  raised the level of the encircling area. The ruins of the city stand  from thirty to seventy feet above the plain, and in the north-eastern  corner there rose, before the excavations, a conical mound, known by  the Arabs as _Bint el-Emir_ or \"The Princess\". This prominent landmark  represents the temple-tower of Enlil's famous sanctuary, and even after  excavation it is still the first object that the approaching traveller  sees on the horizon. When he has climbed its summit he enjoys an  uninterrupted view over desert and swamp.    The cause of Nippur's present desolation is to be traced to the change  in the bed of the Euphrates, which now lies far to the west. But in  antiquity the stream flowed through the centre of the city, along the  dry bed of the Shatt en-Nil, which divides the mounds into an eastern  and a western group. The latter covers the remains of the city proper  and was occupied in part by the great business-houses and bazaars. Here  more than thirty thousand contracts and accounts, dating from the fourth  millennium to the fifth century B.C., were found in houses along the  former river-bank. In the eastern half of the city was Enlil's great  temple Ekur, with its temple-tower Imkharsag rising in successive stages  beside it. The huge temple-enclosure contained not only the sacrificial  shrines, but also the priests' apartments, store-chambers, and  temple-magazines. Outside its enclosing wall, to the south-west, a large  triangular mound, christened \"Tablet Hill\" by the excavators, yielded  a further supply of records. In addition to business-documents of the  First Dynasty of Babylon and of the later Assyrian, Neo-Babylonian,  and Persian periods, between two and three thousand literary texts and  fragments were discovered here, many of them dating from the Sumerian  period. And it is possible that some of the early literary texts that  have been published were obtained in other parts of the city.    No less than twenty-one different strata, representing separate periods  of occupation, have been noted by the American excavators at various  levels within the Nippur mounds,(1) the earliest descending to virgin  soil some twenty feet below the present level of the surrounding plain.  The remote date of Nippur's foundation as a city and cult-centre  is attested by the fact that the pavement laid by Naram-Sin in the  south-eastern temple-court lies thirty feet above virgin soil, while  only thirty-six feet of superimposed _debris_ represent the succeeding  millennia of occupation down to Sassanian and early Arab times. In  the period of the Hebrew captivity the city still ranked as a great  commercial market and as one of the most sacred repositories of  Babylonian religious tradition. We know that not far off was Tel-abib,  the seat of one of the colonies of Jewish exiles, for that lay \"by the  river of Chebar\",(2) which we may identify with the Kabaru Canal in  Nippur's immediate neighbourhood. It was \"among the captives by the  river Chebar\" that Ezekiel lived and prophesied, and it was on Chebar's  banks that he saw his first vision of the Cherubim.(3) He and other of  the Jewish exiles may perhaps have mingled with the motley crowd that  once thronged the streets of Nippur, and they may often have gazed on  the huge temple-tower which rose above the city's flat roofs. We know  that the later population of Nippur itself included a considerable  Jewish element, for the upper strata of the mounds have yielded numerous  clay bowls with Hebrew, Mandaean, and Syriac magical inscriptions;(4)  and not the least interesting of the objects recovered was the wooden  box of a Jewish scribe, containing his pen and ink-vessel and a little  scrap of crumbling parchment inscribed with a few Hebrew characters.(5)         ("]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20300"],[0,"Henry VIII. (#6)"],[1,"by Erasmus as possessing the soundest  judgment and as being remarkable for her prudence as well as for her  piety. Bernard Andre,[43] historian and poet, who had been tutor to  Prince Arthur, probably took no small part in the education of his  younger brother; to him he dedicated, after Arthur's death, two of the  annual summaries of events which he was in the habit of compiling.  Giles D'Ewes,[44] apparently a Frenchman and the author of a notable  French grammar, taught that language to Prince Henry, as many      (p. 021)  years later he did to his daughter, Queen Mary; probably either D'Ewes  or Andre trained his handwriting, which is a curious compromise  between the clear and bold Italian style, soon to be adopted by  well-instructed Englishmen, and the old English hieroglyphics in which  more humbly educated individuals, including Shakespeare, concealed the  meaning of their words. But the most famous of Henry's teachers was  the poet Skelton, the greatest name in English verse from Lydgate down  to Surrey. Skelton was poet laureate to Henry VII. Court, and refers  in his poems to his wearing of the white and green of Tudor  liveries.[45] He celebrated in verse Arthur's creation as Prince of  Wales and Henry's as Duke of York;[46] and before the younger prince  was nine years old, this \"incomparable light and ornament of British  Letters,\" as Erasmus styles him, was directing Henry's studies.  Skelton himself writes.--      The honor of England I learned to spell,    I gave him drink of the sugred well    Of Helicon's waters crystalline,    Acquainting him with the Muses nine.                       [Footnote 40: This is an anonymous portrait of                     Henry at the age of eighteen months or two years                     belonging to Sir Edmund and Lady Verney.]                       [Footnote 41: Erasmus, _Epist._, p. 1182; _L. and                     P._, iv., 5412.]                       [Footnote 42: This testimonial was written in 1528                     before Henry VIII. had given the most striking                     demonstrations of its truth.]                       [Footnote 43: See _D.N.B._, i., 398. Erasmus,                     however, described Andre as being \"of mean                     abilities\" (_L. and P._, iv., 626).]                       [Footnote 44: _D.N.B._, xiv., 449; _cf._ _L. and                     P._, i., 513. On Henry VIII's accession D'Ewes was                     appointed keeper of the King's library at Richmond                     with a salary of L10 per year.]                       [Footnote 45: Skelton, _Works_, ed.

Mus. Addit.                     MS. 26787_.]    The coarseness of Skelton's satires and his open disregard of the  clerical vows of chastity may justify some doubt of the value of the  poet's influence on Henry's character; but he so far observed the  conventional duties of his post as to dedicate to his royal pupil, in  1501, a moral treatise in Latin of no particular worth.[47] More  deserving of Henry's study were two books inscribed to him a       (p. 022)  little later by young Boerio, son of the King's Genoese physician and  a pupil of Erasmus, who, according to his own account, suffered untold  afflictions from the father's temper. One was a translation of  Isocrates' _De Regno_, the other of Lucian's tract against believing  calumnies.[48] The latter was, to judge from the tale of Henry's  victims, a precept which he scarcely laid to heart in youth. In other  respects he was apt enough to learn. He showed \"remarkable docility  for mathematics,\" became proficient in Latin, spoke French with ease,  understood Italian, and, later on, possibly from Catherine of Aragon,  acquired a knowledge of Spanish. In 1499 Erasmus himself, the greatest  of the humanists, visited his friend, Lord Mountjoy, near Greenwich,  and made young Henry's acquaintance. \"I was staying,\" he writes,[49]  \"at Lord Mountjoy's country house when Thomas More came to see me, and  took me out with him for a walk as far as the next village, where all  the King's children, except Prince Arthur, who was then the eldest  son, were being educated. When we came into the hall, the attendants  not only of the palace, but also of Mountjoy's household, were all  assembled. In the midst stood Prince Henry, now nine years old, and  having already something of royalty in his demeanour in which there  was a certain dignity combined with singular courtesy. On his right  was Margaret, about eleven years of age, afterwards married to James,  King of Scots; and on his left played Mary, a child of four. Edmund  was an infant in arms. More, with his companion Arnold, after      (p. 023)  paying his respects to the boy Henry, the same that is now King of  England, presented him with some writing. For my part, not having  expected anything of the sort, I had nothing to offer, but promised  that, on another occasion, I would in some way declare my duty towards  him. Meantime, I was angry with More for not having warned me, especially  as the boy sent me a little note, while we were at dinner, to challenge  something from my pen. I went home, and in the Muses' spite, from whom  I had been so long divorced, finished the poem within three days.\" The  poem,[50] in which Britain speaks her own praise and that of her  princes, Henry VII. and his children, was dedicated to the Duke of  York and accompanied by a letter in which Erasmus commended Henry's  devotion to learning. Seven years later Erasmus again wrote to Henry,  now Prince of Wales, condoling with him upon the death of his  brother-in-law, Philip of Burgundy, King of Castile. Henry replied in  cordial manner, inviting the great scholar to continue the correspondence.  The style of his letter so impressed Erasmus that he suspected, as he  says,[51] \"some help from others in the ideas and expressions. In a  conversation I afterwards had with William, Lord Mountjoy, he tried by  various arguments to dispel that suspicion, and when he found he could  not do so he gave up the point and let it pass until he was  sufficiently instructed in the case. On another occasion, when we were  talking alone together, he brought out a number of the Prince's  letters, some to other people and some to himself, and among them one  which answered to mine: in these letters were manifest signs of    (p. 024)  comment, addition, suppression, correction and alteration--You might  recognise the first drafting of a letter, and you might make out the  second and third, and sometimes even the fourth correction; but  whatever was revised or added was in the same handwriting. I had then  no further grounds for hesitation, and, overcome by the facts, I laid  aside all suspicion.\" Neither, he adds, would his correspondent doubt  Henry VIII's authorship of the book against Luther if he knew that  king's \"happy genius\". That famous book is sufficient proof that  theological studies held no small place in Henry's education. They  were cast in the traditional mould, for the Lancastrians were very  orthodox, and the early Tudors followed in their steps. Margaret  Beaufort left her husband to devote herself to good works and a  semi-monastic life; Henry VII. converted a heretic at the stake and  left him to burn;[52] and the theological conservatism, which Henry  VIII. imbibed in youth, clung to him to the end of his days.

Even as Duke of York he had  a band of minstrels apart from those of the King and Prince Arthur;[53]  and when he was king his minstrels formed an indispensable part of his  retinue, whether he went on progress through his kingdom, or crossed  the seas on errands of peace or war.[54] He became an expert performer  on the lute, the organ and the harpsichord, and all the cares of State  could not divert him from practising on those instruments both day (p. 025)  and night. He sent all over England in search of singing men and boys  for the chapel royal, and sometimes appropriated choristers from  Wolsey's chapel, which he thought better provided than his own.[55]  From Venice he enticed to England the organist of St. Mark's, Dionysius  Memo, and on occasion Henry and his Court listened four hours at a  stretch to Memo's organ recitals.[56] Not only did he take delight in  the practice of music by himself and others; he also studied its  theory and wrote with the skill of an expert. Vocal and instrumental  pieces of his own composition, preserved among the manuscripts at the  British Museum,[57] rank among the best productions of the time; and  one of his anthems, \"O Lorde, the Maker of all thyng,\" is of the  highest order of merit, and still remains a favourite in English  cathedrals.
