Finger nails well cared for, but recently neglected. Hair dyed  to hide gray patches; dye wanted renewing. Shoes, French. Night-robe,  silk; good lace; probably French, also. Faint perfume--don't know what  it is--apparently proceeding from civet fur. Furs, magnificent; very  costly.\"...    He slightly moved the table-lamp in order to direct its light upon  the white face. The bloodless lips were parted and the detective bent,  closely peering at the teeth thus revealed.    \"Her teeth were oddly discolored, doctor,\" he said, taking out a  magnifying glass and examining them closely. \"They had been recently  scaled, too; so that she was not in the habit of neglecting them.\"    Dr. Cumberly nodded.    \"The drug habit, again,\" he said guardedly; \"a proper examination will  establish the full facts.\"    The inspector added brief notes to those already made, ere he rose from  beside the body. Then:--    \"You are absolutely certain,\" he said, deliberately, facing Leroux,  \"that you had never set eyes on this woman prior to her coming here,  to-night?\"    \"I can swear it!\" said Leroux.    \"Good!\" replied the detective, and closed his notebook with a snap.  \"Usual formalities will have to be gone through, but I don't think I  need trouble you, gentlemen, any further, to-night.\"          V    DOCTORS DIFFER      Dr. Cumberly walked slowly upstairs to his own flat, a picture etched  indelibly upon his mind, of Henry Leroux, with a face of despair,  sitting below in his dining-room and listening to the ominous sounds  proceeding from the study, where the police were now busily engaged. In  the lobby he met his daughter Helen, who was waiting for him in a state  of nervous suspense.    \"Father!\" she began, whilst rebuke died upon the doctor's lips--\"tell me  quickly what has happened.\"    Perceiving that an explanation was unavoidable, Dr. Cumberly outlined  the story of the night's gruesome happenings, whilst Big Ben began to  chime the hour of one.    Helen, eager-eyed, and with her charming face rather pale, hung upon  every word of the narrative.    \"And now,\" concluded her father, \"you must go to bed. I insist.\"    \"But father!\" cried the girl--\"there is some thing\"...    She hesitated, uneasily.    \"Well, Helen, go on,\" said the doctor.    \"I am afraid you will refuse.\"    \"At least give me the opportunity.\"    \"Well--in the glimpse, the half-glimpse, which I had of her, I  seemed\"...    Dr. Cumberly rested his hands upon his daughter's shoulders  characteristically, looking into the troubled gray eyes.    \"You don't mean,\" he began...    \"I thought I recognized her!\" whispered the girl.    \"Good God! can it be possible?\"    \"I have been trying, ever since, to recall where we had met, but without  result. It might mean so much\"...    Dr. Cumberly regarded her, fixedly.    \"It might mean so much to--Mr. Leroux. But I suppose you will say it is  impossible?\"    \"It IS impossible,\" said Dr. Cumberly firmly; \"dismiss the idea, Helen.\"    \"But father,\" pleaded the girl, placing her hands over his own,  \"consider what is at stake\"...    \"I am anxious that you should not become involved in this morbid  business.\"    \"But you surely know me better than to expect me to faint or become  hysterical, or anything silly like that! I was certainly shocked when  I came down to-night, because--well, it was all so frightfully  unexpected\"...    Dr. Cumberly shook his head. Helen put her arms about his neck and  raised her eyes to his.    \"You have no right to refuse,\" she said, softly: \"don't you see that?\"    Dr. Cumberly frowned. Then:--    \"You are right, Helen,\" he agreed. \"I should know your pluck well  enough. But if Inspector Dunbar is gone, the police may refuse to admit  us\"...    \"Then let us hurry!\" cried Helen. \"I am afraid they will take away\"...    Side by side they descended to Henry Leroux's flat, ringing the bell,  which, an hour earlier, the lady of the civet furs had rung.    A sergeant in uniform opened the door.    \"Is Detective-Inspector Dunbar here?\" inquired the physician.    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Say that Dr. Cumberly wishes to speak to him. And\"--as the man was  about to depart--\"request him not to arouse Mr. Leroux.\"    Almost immediately the inspector appeared, a look of surprise upon his  face, which increased on perceiving the girl beside her father.    \"This is my daughter, Inspector,\" explained Cumberly; \"she is a  contributor to the Planet, and to various magazines, and in this  journalistic capacity, meets many people in many walks of life. She  thinks she may be of use to you in preparing your case.\"    Dunbar bowed rather awkwardly.    \"Glad to meet you, Miss Cumberly,\" came the inevitable formula.  \"Entirely at your service.\"    \"I had an idea, Inspector,\" said the girl, laying her hand  confidentially upon Dunbar's arm, \"that I recognized, when I entered Mr.  Leroux's study, tonight\"--Dunbar nodded--\"that I recognized--the--the  victim!\"    \"Good!\" said the inspector, rubbing his palms briskly together. His  tawny eyes sparkled. \"And you would wish to see her again before we  take her away. Very plucky of you, Miss Cumberly! But then, you are a  doctor's daughter.\"    They entered, and the inspector closed the door behind them.    \"Don't arouse poor Leroux,\" whispered Cumberly to the detective. \"I left  him on a couch in the dining-room.\"...    \"He is still there,\" replied Dunbar; \"poor chap! It is\"...    He met Helen's glance, and broke off shortly.    In the study two uniformed constables, and an officer in plain clothes,  were apparently engaged in making an inventory--or such was the  impression conveyed. The clock ticked merrily on; its ticking a  desecration, where all else was hushed in deference to the grim visitor.  The body of the murdered woman had been laid upon the chesterfield, and  a little, dark, bearded man was conducting an elaborate examination;  when, seeing the trio enter, he hastily threw the coat of civet fur over  the body, and stood up, facing the intruders.    \"It's all right, doctor,\" said the inspector; \"and we shan't detain you  a moment.\" He glanced over his shoulder. \"Mr. Hilton, M. R. C. S.\" he  said, indicating the dark man--\"Dr. Cumberly and Miss Cumberly.\"    The divisional surgeon bowed to Helen and eagerly grasped the hand of  the celebrated physician.    \"I am fortunate in being able to ask your opinion,\" he began....    Dr. Cumberly nodded shortly, and with upraised hand, cut him short.    \"I shall willingly give you any assistance in my power,\" he said;  \"but my daughter has voluntarily committed herself to a rather painful  ordeal, and I am anxious to get it over.\"    He stooped and raised the fur from the ghastly face.    Helen, her hand resting upon her father's shoulder, ventured one rapid  glance and then looked away, shuddering slightly. Dr. Cumberly replaced  the coat and gazed anxiously at his daughter. But Helen, with admirable  courage, having closed her eyes for a moment, reopened them, and smiled  at her father's anxiety. She was pale, but perfectly composed.    \"Well, Miss Cumberly?\" inquired the inspector, eagerly; whilst all in  the room watched this slim girl in her charming deshabille, this dainty  figure so utterly out of place in that scene of morbid crime.    She raised her gray eyes to the detective.    \"I still believe that I have seen the face, somewhere, before. But I  shall have to reflect a while--I meet so many folks, you know, in a  casual way--before I can commit myself to any statement.\"    In the leonine eyes looking into hers gleamed the light of admiration  and approval. The canny Scotsman admired this girl for her beauty, as  a matter of course, for her courage, because courage was a quality  standing high in his estimation, but, above all, for her admirable  discretion.    \"Very proper, Miss Cumberly,\" he said; \"very proper and wise on your  part. I don't wish to hurry you in any way, but\"--he hesitated, glancing  at the man in plain clothes, who had now resumed a careful perusal of a  newspaper--\"but her name doesn't happen to be Vernon--\"    \"Vernon!\" cried the girl, her eyes lighting up at sound of the name.  \"Mrs. Vernon! it is! it is! She was pointed out to me at the last Arts  Ball--where she appeared in a most monstrous Chinese costume--\"    \"Chinese?\" inquired Dunbar, producing the bulky notebook.    \"Yes. Oh! poor, poor soul!\"    \"You know nothing further about her, Miss Cumberly?\"    \"Nothing, Inspector. She was merely pointed out to me as one of the  strangest figures in the hall. Her husband, I understand, is an art  expert--\"    \"He WAS!\" said Dunbar, closing the book sharply. \"He died this  afternoon; and a paragraph announcing his death appears in the newspaper  which we found in the victim's fur coat!\"    \"But how--\"    \"It was the only paragraph on the half-page folded outwards which was in  any sense PERSONAL. I am greatly indebted to you, Miss Cumberly; every  hour wasted on a case like this means a fresh plait in the rope around  the neck of the wrong man!\"    Helen Cumberly grew slowly quite pallid.    \"Good night,\" she said; and bowing to the detective and to the surgeon,  she prepared to depart.    Mr. Hilton touched Dr. Cumberly's arm, as he, too, was about to retire.    \"May I hope,\" he whispered, \"that you will return and give me the  benefit of your opinion in making out my report?\"    Dr. Cumberly glanced at his daughter; and seeing her to be perfectly  composed:--\"For the moment, I have formed no opinion, Mr. Hilton,\"  he said, quietly, \"not having had an opportunity to conduct a proper  examination.\"    Hilton bent and whispered, confidentially, in the other's ear:--    \"She was drugged!\"    The innuendo underlying the words struck Dr. Cumberly forcibly, and he  started back with his brows drawn together in a frown.    \"Do you mean that she was addicted to the use of drugs?\" he asked,  sharply; \"or that the drugging took"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20293"],[0,"A Popular History of the Art of Music (#6)"],[1,"of the Harper\" found in a papyrus  dating from about 1500 B.C., which gives an idea of the sentiments the  music was intended to convey. Here it is, from Rawlinson's \"History of  Ancient Egypt,\" p. 48:         \"THE SONG OF THE HARPER.\"         (From a papyrus of the XVIIIth Dynasty.)         The great one has gone to his rest         Ended his task and his race;       Thus men are aye passing away,         And youths are aye taking their place.       As Ra rises up every morn,         And Tum every evening doth set.       So women conceive and bring forth,         And men without ceasing beget.       Each soul in its turn draweth breath,       Each man born of woman sees death.         Take thy pleasure to-day,         Father! Holy one! See,       Spices and fragrant oils,         Father, we bring to thee.       On thy sister's bosom and arms         Wreaths of lotus we place;       On thy sister, dear to thy heart,         Aye sitting before thy face.       Sing the song, let music be played,       And let cares behind thee be laid.         Take thy pleasure to-day;         Mind thee of joy and delight!       Soon life's pilgrimage ends,         And we pass to silence and night.       Patriarch, perfect and pure,         Neferhotep, blessed one! Thou       Didst finish thy course upon earth,         And art with the blessed ones now.       Men pass to the silent shore,       And their place shall know them no more.         They are as they never had been         Since the sun went forth upon high;       They sit on the banks of the stream         That floweth in stillness by.       Thy soul is among them; thou         Dost drink of the sacred tide,       Having the wish of thy heart,         At peace ever since thou hast died.       Give bread to the man who is poor,       And thy name shall be blest evermore.    All princely households appear to have had their regular staff of  musicians, at the head being the \"Overest of Musicians,\" whose tombs  still furnish some of the most instructive information upon this part  of the ancient life. People of lower social grade had to be content  with the temporary services of the street musicians, such as those  represented in Fig. 6. They played and sang and danced for weddings  and festivities, and undertook the entire contract of mourning for the  dead, the measure being the production of a small vial full of tears,  under the immediate inspection of the relative of the deceased whose  grief might happen to need this official assistance.    For warlike purposes the Egyptians had a short trumpet of bronze, and  a long trumpet, not unlike a straight trombone. They had drums of many  kinds, but as none of these instruments have reference to the  development of the higher art of music, we do not delay to describe  them.    One thing which might surprise us in casting an eye over the foregoing  representations as a whole is the small progress made considering the  immensely long period covered by the glimpses we have of the music of  this far-away race. From the days of the harpers in our earliest  illustrations to those of the last is more than 2,000 years, in fact  considerably longer than from the beginning of the Christian era until  now. The explanation is easy to find. In the first place, the  incitations upon the side of sense perception were comparatively  meager. Neither in sonority nor in delicacy of tonal resource were the  Egyptian instruments a tenth part as stimulating as those of to-day.  Moreover, we have here to deal with childlike intelligences, slow  perceptions, and limited opportunities of comparison. Hence if these  were all the discouraging elements there would be but little cause for  wonder at the slow progress. But there was another element deeper and  more powerful. The Egyptian mind was conservative to reaction. Plato  in his \"Laws,\" says: \"Long ago the Egyptians appear to have recognized  the very principle of which we are now speaking--that their young  citizens must be habituated to the forms and strains of virtue. These  they fixed, and exhibited the patterns of them in their temples, and  no painter or artist is allowed to innovate upon them, or to leave the  traditional forms or invent new ones. To this day no alteration is  allowed in these arts nor in music at all. And you will find that  their works of art are painted or modeled in the same forms that they  were 10,000 years ago. This is literally true, and no exaggeration--their  ancient paintings and sculptures are not a whit better or worse than  those of to-day, but are with just the same skill.\" This, which Dr.  Draper calls the \"protective idea,\" was undoubtedly the cause of their  little progress.    In another place Plato gives a very interesting glimpse of the  Egyptian method of education, and describes something having in it  much the spirit of the modern kindergarten. He says (\"Laws,\" Jowett's  translation, p. 815): \"In that country systems of calculation have  been actually invented for the use of children, which they learn as a  pleasure and amusement. They have to distribute apples and garlands,  adapting the same number to either a larger or less number of persons;  and they distribute to pugilists and wrestlers, or they follow one  another, or pair together by lot. Another mode of amusing them is by  taking vessels of gold, and brass, and silver, and the like, and  mingling them, or distributing them without mingling. As I was saying,  they adapt to their amusement the numbers in common use, and in this  way make more intelligible to their pupils the arrangements and  movements of armies and expeditions, and in the management of a  household they make people more useful to themselves, and wide-awake.\"  This, together with the well known expectation of the Egyptians to be  judged after death according to the \"deeds done in the body,\" as our  sacred writings have it, affords a high idea of their serious and  lofty turn of mind, as well as of the great advance they had made  toward a true notion of the means of education.          CHAPTER II.    MUSIC AMONG THE HEBREWS AND ASSYRIANS.      Second in point of antiquity, but first in modern association, comes  the music of the Hebrews, and of the other allied nations of Assyria  and Babylon, from whom they learned a part of their art of music. The  place of music in the cult of the Hebrews was very large and  important, yet in spite of this fact they never elevated their music  into an art, strictly so called. There are no evidences of a  progressive development of instruments and a tonal sense among this  people. As they were when first we meet them, so they continued until  they pass out of the view of history as a nation, when the sacrificial  fires went out in the great temple at Jerusalem on the 11th of July,  A.D. 70, and the heathen Roman defiled the altars of God. In the  beginning Genesis tells us of one Jubal, who was the father of such as  handle the harp and the organ (kinnor and ugabh--the little triangular  harp of Assyria, and the shepherd's pipe, which here stands for all  sorts of wind instruments). In the course of the centuries the harp  changed its form somewhat, and perhaps had an increased number of  strings; the flute was multiplied into several sub-varieties, and the  horn was added. From Egypt they had the timbrel, a tambourine, to  which Miriam, the sister of Moses, intoned the sublime canticle, \"The  horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea.\" There were also the  sistra, those metallic instruments serving in the temple service the  same purpose that the bells serve in the mass at the present  day--that, namely, of letting the distant worshipers know when the  solemn moment has arrived.    Vast numbers of musicians were employed in the greater temple service,  4,000 being mentioned in I Chronicles xxiii, 5, as praising God with  the kinds of instruments appointed by David. According to Josephus,  this great number was vastly increased in still later times, the  numbers given being 200,000 trumpeters and 40,000 harpers and players  upon stringed instruments. Even if we take the figures as greatly  exaggerated, they show nevertheless that the art of music had a great  place among this people.    The instruments known were few in number, and their type underwent  little change from the earliest days. The principal instrument of the  older time was the _Kinnor_, or little triangular harp, which we find  in the record of the primeval Jubal, and which more than 1,000 years  later was played before Saul to defend him from the evil spirit. This  also was the instrument most prominent in the temple service, and this  again was hung upon the willows of Babylon. The name kinnor is said to  have been Phoenician, a fact which points to this as the source of  its derivation. It is not easy to see how this could well be, unless  we regard the name as having been applied to the invention of Jubal at  a later time, for Jubal lived many years anterior to the founding of  the great metropolis of the Mediterranean. The kinnor was a small harp  having from ten to twenty strings. The usual forms are shown in the  accompanying illustration. The strings were fastened upon a metal rod  lying along the face of the sounding board. The type of construction  is totally unlike that of the Egyptian harps, and its musical powers  were apparently considerably inferior. Its form was the following:    [Illustration: Fig. 8.]    Another instrument often mentioned in the English version of the Bible  is the psaltery, of which the form is somewhat uncertain, but is  thought to have been four-sided. Various ancient representations have  been supposed to be this instrument, but none of them satisfactorily,  at least not authoritatively. It was probably a variety of harp. The  nebel is also said to have been a psaltery, but its etymology points  to the Phoenician nabel, a triangular harp like a Greek delta. The  forms of the"]]]
