[Illustration: Completed Pedestal]    Having the boards for the post cut to the proper length and square, nail  them together as shown in the detail drawing. Use finishing nails, then  set the heads and fill the holes with putty. Next, nail the 3/4 by 6-in.  piece on one end of the post leaving the edges projecting even on all  sides. Pick out the best board for the top. On the under side and 1/2.  in. in from the edges, nail four of the 3/4 by 2 by 11-in. pieces which  have been previously mitered as shown in the plan view. Now fasten this  top to the post by nailing through the projecting edge of the top piece  into the top board. Be careful to get this top on square with the post  and exactly in center.    The bottom board is made in the same manner as the top board and is  nailed to the lower end of the post as shown. Four 1-in. square blocks  should be fastened to the bottom for the pedestal to rest on.    When complete, sandpaper smooth and apply any one of the many mission  stains that are supplied by the trade for this purpose.    [Illustration]    After staining the wood, the surface can be given a polished or dull  finish, as desired. Mission furniture requires a dull finish, and this  may be obtained by applying a coat of wax, well rubbed on the wood.          MAGAZINE RACK      The accompanying cut shows a magazine rack that will find favor with  many amateur wood-workers on account of its simplicity in design and its  rich, massive appearance when properly finished. It is so constructed  that each piece may be polished, stained and finished before it is  finally put together. Quarter-sawed oak is the best wood to use.  Plain-sawed oak looks well, but it is more liable to warp than  quarter-sawed and this is quite an element in pieces as wide as the ones  here used. Following is a list of the material needed:       4 posts, 2 by 2 by 40 in., S-4-S.     5 shelves, 1 by 14 by 24 in., S-2-S.    20 F.H. screws, 2 in. long.    Considerable labor can be saved if the material be ordered from the mill  ready cut to length, squared and sanded. The corner posts should be made  first. The most convenient and accurate method of laying out the  mortises is to square one end of each post and lay them on the bench  flat, with the squared ends even with each other; then clamp them  securely and lay out the mortises on one side across all four pieces at  once; then loosen the clamp and project the marks to the other side with  a try-square. Now saw along these marks, making each cut just deep  enough to bring the mortises diagonally across the piece from one corner  to the opposite corner as shown in the detail sketch. Be careful not to  get the mortises wider than the shelves are thick. Bevel the tops of the  posts as shown.    [Illustration: Detail of the Magazine Rack]    [Illustration: Magazine Rack Complete]    See that the ends of the shelves are square and smooth, then set a  scratch gauge so that the scriber is just 2 in. from the face of the  block and mark this distance off each way from the corner of the  shelves. Saw these corners diagonally across as shown, being careful not  to saw off too much.    The parts can now be assembled. Place all the parts in position, then  pass a rope around each end and twist it up tightly with a small stick.  If this is properly done, you can now pick up the rack and handle it in  any way you wish. The screws can now be put in the corners. You can use  flat-head screws and plug the holes, or you can use round-head blue  screws and let the heads project. After the screws are all in, dress off  all unevenness where the shelves are mortised into the posts, then mark  each shelf and post so that you can put it together again after the  parts are finished. Take the rack apart and transfer the marks to some  part of the mortises and shelves that will not be covered with the  finish you intend to put on. Apply the finish you wish to use and when  the parts are thoroughly dry they can be reassembled and your rack will  be complete.          A HALL TREE      When making the hall tree as shown in the accompanying illustration use  quarter-sawed oak if possible, as this wood is the most suitable for  finishing in the different mission stains. This is a very useful and  attractive piece of mission furniture and is also very easy to  construct. The stock can be purchased ready cut to length, mill-planed  and sandpapered on four sides as given in the following list:      1 post, 2 by 2 by 59 in.    4 posts, 2 by 2 by 10 in.    8 braces, 7/8 by 2 by 7-1/2 in.    4 arms, 7/8 by 2 by 5-3/4 in.    [Illustration: Detail and Finished View of Hall Tree]    First square up all the posts and bevel them at the tops as shown. Then  cut the mortises making them 1/2 in. wide and 7/8 in. deep. Cut the  tenons on the braces to fit these mortises. Be careful to get the  distance between the shoulders of the braces all of the same length. A  good way to do this is to place them all side by side on a flat surface  with the ends square and lay them all out at once. The top arms can be  made in the same manner. The tenons should fit good and tight in all the  posts.    The parts can now be glued and clamped together. When they are dry,  scrape all the surplus glue from about the joints and go over the whole  with fine sandpaper, removing all rough spots. Apply the finish you like  best or the one that will match your other furniture. Purchase a few  hooks at a hardware store and fasten in the upper arms as shown, and the  hall tree is complete.          A TABLE FOR THE DEN      The table shown in the accompanying sketch is especially appropriate for  the den; it might be used in any other part of the house as well. It may  be built of plain-sawed red oak, or of quarter-sawed white oak. The wood  should be thoroughly seasoned and devoid of imperfections.    Order the material as follows:      1 top piece, 3/4 in. thick by 36 in. square, S-2-S.    4 legs, 2-1/2 in. square by 30 in. long, S-4-S.    2 upper horizontals, 1-1/8 by 2 by 36 in., S-4-S.    2 lower horizontals, 3/4 by 2-1/2 by 35 in., S-4-S.    4 keys, 1/2 by 1 by 5 in., S-2-S.    Lay out and cut the circular top first. Next cut the four legs to  length. To get the slopes for the ends of the legs and the shoulders of  the tenons, lay out a full-sized drawing in pencil and lay the bevel  along these lines, adjusting the parts to the lines.    [Illustration: Table Completed]    The top horizontals have grooves cut on either side to allow the posts  to \"set in.\" This is to give the frame more rigidity. The lower  horizontals or stretchers are to be tenoned through the posts and keyed.  That the keys may be alike in size, a good plan is to make them first,  then make the mortises in the stretchers to correspond. Work the keys to  the proper thickness, unless they were ordered so, then to length and  joint one edge straight and square. Next lay off across the key the  lines A and B of the drawing so that A shall measure 1/2 in. and B 3/8  in. Draw a sloping line through these points and work this edge of the  key to size and shape. Round the top of the key as shown. Then mortise,  in the tenon, for the key can then be laid out to 1/2 in. for the top  opening and 3/8 in. for the bottom.    [Illustration: Detail of a Den Table]    The most satisfactory finish for mission designs, and the easiest to  apply, is wax. It is an old finish that was superseded by varnish. Our  ancestors used to make wax polish by \"cutting\" beeswax with turpentine.  Cut up the beeswax and add to it about one-third its volume of  turpentine. Heat to the boiling point in a double boiler. Or, melt a  quantity of beeswax and to this add an equal volume of turpentine. Care  must be taken that the turpentine shall not catch fire.    Rapid drying and hardening waxes can be purchased now-a-days. They  require a smooth surface and a thin application for a successful result.  Too much wax upon a rough surface will produce very ugly, white,  chalk-like spottings as the wax dries. These are especially noticeable  upon dark finishes. Waxes colored black overcome this, but are not  necessary if the ordinary wax is properly applied. 1--Stain the wood, if  a very dark finish is desired. 2--If the wood is coarse grained, put on  one or two coats of paste filler and rub it off carefully, that a smooth  surface may be prepared. Allow the stain 12 hours in which to dry, also  each coat of filler. 3--With a soft cloth apply as thin a coating of wax  as can be and still cover the wood. Wax is in paste form. 4--Allow this  to stand five or ten minutes, then rub briskly with a soft dry cloth to  polish. 5--Let stand 24 hours, then apply another coat.    [Illustration: WINDOW SEAT Fig. 1--The Rough Cedar Box Without the  Covering]          A BURLAP-COVERED WINDOW SEAT      A portable window seat of neat appearance, which is designed to take the  place of a cedar chest, is shown in the accompanying sketch. If care is  taken to make the joints fit well, the box will be practically airtight  and mothproof, providing a place in which to store extra bedding or  furs. The following list of materials will be needed:      36 ft. 1-in. thick cedar boards for the box.     1 piece pine, 2 by 2 in. by 12 ft. long.    32 ft. of 1/4 by 2-in. oak strips.    54 ft. of 1/4 by 1-in. oak strips.    16 doz. R.H. 3/4-in, long brass screws.     1 piece green burlap, 24 by 48 in.     2 pieces green burlap, 20 by 44 in.     2 pieces green burlap, 20 by 20 in.    20 pieces red burlap, 3-1/4 in. square.    The box as shown in Fig. 1 is made first. Nail the sides and the bottom  to the ends, being careful to get the box perfectly square. The corners  can be dovetailed together if"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23667"],[0,"Woodland Tales (#6)"],[1," the Butterflies that sometimes sleep all winter, and so live  in two different seasons.    Its eggs are laid on the willows, elms, or poplars, in early springtime.  The young soon hatch, and eat so much, and grow so fast, that five weeks  after the eggs are laid, and three after they are hatched, the  caterpillar is full grown, and hangs itself up as a chrysalis under some  sheltering board or rail. In two weeks more, the wonderful event takes  place, the perfect Butterfly comes forth; and there is another  Mourning-cloak to liven the roadside, and amaze us with its half-hidden  beauty.      TALE 14    The Wandering Monarch    Did you ever read the old Greek story of Ulysses, King of Ithaca, the  Wandering Monarch, who for twenty years roamed over sea and land away  from home--always trying to get back, but doomed to keep on travelling,  homesick and weary, but still moving on; until his name became a byword  for wandering?    [Illustration: MONARCH BUTTERFLY    \"The Wanderer\" in Three Stages: Cocoon, Caterpillar, and Butterfly]    In our own woods and our own fields in America we have a Wandering  Monarch--the \"Big Red Butterfly\" as we children called it--the \"Monarch\"  as it is named by the butterfly catchers.    It is called the \"Wanderer\" chiefly because it is the only one of our  Butterflies that migrates like the birds. In the late summer it  gathers in great swarms when the bright days are waning, and flies away  to warmer lands. I have often seen it going, yet I do not remember that  I ever saw it come back in the springtime; but it comes, though not in  great flocks like those that went south.    One of the common names of this splendid creature is \"Milkweed  Butterfly\" because its grub or caterpillar is fond of feeding on the  leaves of the common milkweed.    The drawing shows the size and style of the grub; in colour it is yellow  or yellowish green with black bands.    As soon as it is grown big enough and fat enough, the grub hangs itself  up as a \"chrysalis\" which is a Greek word that may be freely rendered  into \"golden jewel.\" The middle drawing shows its shape; in colour it is  of a pale green with spots of gold, or as it has been described \"a green  house with golden nails.\"    After about two weeks the great change takes place, and the bundle-baby  or chrysalis opens to let out the splendid red-brown Butterfly, of  nearly the same red as a Cock Robin's breast in springtime, with lines  and embroidery of black and its border set with pearls. Near the middle  of the hind wing is a dark spot like a thickening of one rib. This has  been called a \"sachet bag\" or \"scent-pocket,\" and though not very  ornamental to look at, is of more use to it than the most beautiful  white pearl of the border. For this is the battery of its wireless  telegraph. We think our ships and aeroplanes very far advanced because  they can signal miles away, and yet the Wandering Monarch had an outfit  for sending messages long before it was ever dreamed of by man. Maybe it  is not a very strong battery, but it certainly reaches for miles; and  maybe its messages are not very clear, but they serve at least to let  the Monarchs know where their wives are, and how to find them, which is  something.    There is one other reason for calling this the Wanderer. Although it is  an American by birth, it has travelled to England and the Philippines  and is ever going farther over the world till at last no doubt it will  have seen all lands and possessed them.    It makes old Ulysses look like a very stay-at-home, for his farthest  travels never went beyond the blue Mediterranean, and his whole twenty  years of voyaging covered less than the states east of the  Mississippi--much less than our Red Wanderer covers in a single summer.      TALE 15    The Bells of the Solomon Seal    Let us go out into the woods, and look for the Solomon Seal. This is May  and we should find it in some half open place, where it is neither wet  nor dry. Here it is! See the string of bells that hangs from its curving  stem. Dig out its roots, wash off the earth, and you will see the mark  of King Solomon's Seal that gives its name to the plant. Now listen to  the story of it all.    King Solomon had the \"second sight\" that means the deeper sight, the  magic eyesight which made him see through a stone wall, or read men's  thoughts. King Solomon had fayland ears; which means, he could hear all  sounds from A to Z; while common ears, like yours and mine, hear only  the middle sounds from K to Q.    Everything that lives and moves is giving out music; every flower that  blooms is singing its song. We cannot hear, our ears are too dull; but  King Solomon could. And one day, as he walked through the woods, he  heard a new flower-song that made him stop and listen. It had strange  music with it, and part of that was a chime of golden bells.    [Illustration: The Bells of the Solomon Seal]    The great King sat down on a bank. His fayland eyes could see right into  the ground. He saw the fat fleshy root like a little goblin, reaching  its long white fingers down into the soil, picking out the magic  crystals to pack away in its pockets; and he could see the tall stem  like a wood-elf carrying them up, and spreading them upon its flat  hands, so they could soak up the juices of the sun and air. He could see  them turning into a wonderful stuff like amber dew, with a tang like  new-cut timber. But it was not yet done, so he could not tell just what  it might be good for. Now it was springtime, and it would be harvest red  moon before the little worker would have the magic healing stored in its  treasure bags underground. So to prevent any one harming or hindering  the plant till its work was done, the King took out his seal ring and  stamped seal marks all along the root, where they are unto this day. And  then to make it sure he made the golden bell chimes become visible so  every one could see them. There they hang like a row of ringing bells.    But the King never came back to learn the rest of it, for he had to  build the temple; and he had many wives who took up a great deal of his  time. So the world has never found out just what is the magic power of  the plant. But it is there, be sure of that, just as surely as the peal  of golden bells is there, and the marks of the great King's Seal.      TALE 16    The Silver Bells of the False Solomon Seal    [Illustration: The Silver Bells of the False Solomon Seal]    Over a month later, the King suddenly remembered that he had not been  out to see the plant whose root he had sealed. He was very busy at the  time, as he had the temple to build, and many wives to look after; so he  called Djin, a good goblin, who does hard work and said, \"Go and see  that no one has harmed that plant,\" then told him how to find it.    Away went the good goblin, like a flash. He was a very obedient servant,  but not very bright; and when he came to the woods, he looked all around  for the plant with the chime of bells, for King Solomon had forgotten to  say that the bells do not ring after June, and it was now July. So the  goblin looked about for a long time. He did not dare to go back and say  he could not find it--that would have been a terrible crime, so he  looked and looked. At last he heard a little tinkle of bells away off in  the woods. He flew to the place, and there was a plant like the one he  sought but its bells were of silver, and all in a bunch instead of a  long string. The good goblin dug down to the big fat root in the ground  and found that the seal marks had grown over--at least he thought they  had--for they were nowhere to be seen. So he looked around for something  to help. His eye fell on an acorn cup. He took this, and using it for a  seal, he stamped the root all over.    Then he took a piece of the root and a sprig and flew back to show the  King. Solomon smiled and said: \"You did the best you could, but you have  marked the wrong root. Listen! This is not the golden chime, but the  chime of silver bells.\"    That is the story of it and that is why it has ever since been called  the False Solomon Seal.

THINGS TO SEE IN SUMMERTIME    [Illustration: The Brownie and the Mouse-bird]          Things to See in Summertime      TALE 17    How the Mouse-bird Made Fun of the Brownie    Once there was a conceited Brownie, who thought he could do more things  and do them better than any other of his people. He had not tried yet,  for he was very young, but he said he was going to do them some day!    One morning a sly old Brownie, really making fun of him, said: \"Why  don't you catch that Phoebe-bird? It is quite easy if you put a little  salt on his tail.\" Away went Smarty Brownie to try. But the Phoebe would  not sit still, and the Brownie came back saying: \"He bobbed his tail so,  the salt would not stay on.\"    \"Well,\" said the sly old Brownie, \"there is a little Mouse-bird whose  tail never bobs. You can easily catch him, for you see, he does not even  fly, but crawls like a mouse up the tree,\" and he pointed to a little  brown Creeper. By this time the young Brownie knew that the others were  laughing at him, so he said rather hotly, \"I'll just show you right  now.\"    He took an acorn cup full of salt, and went after the Mouse-bird. It was  at the bottom of the big tree, creeping up, round and round, as if on a  spiral staircase, and the Brownie began to climb in the same way. But  every little while the climber had to stop and rest. This had strange  results, for there is a law in Brownie land, that wherever one of the  little people stops to sit down, or rest, a toadstool must spring up for  him to sit on. So the track of the Brownie up the trunk became one long  staircase of toadstool steps, some close, some far apart, but each  showing where the Brownie had rested. They came closer together "]]]
