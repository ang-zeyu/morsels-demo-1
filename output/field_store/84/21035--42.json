The individual cells of a muscle are  alike in structure and function, but they differ widely from those of  a gland or secreting organ, as the liver. But it is to be ever  remembered that the statements with which we set out hold: that is,  that however cells may differ, they have in all animals certain  properties in common. Of the muscle-cell, the liver-cell, and the  one-celled animal we may affirm the same properties, but the  difference is that while all are secretory the liver-cell is eminently  so, and produces bile, which other cells do not; that while it is but  feebly contractile, or susceptible of change of form, the muscle-cell  is characterized by this property above all others.    The lower we descend in the animal scale the more simple are the  mechanisms by which results are attained. The one-celled animal may be  said to breathe with its whole body, while the man employs a large  number of muscles, not to speak, at present, of other arrangements.  But when a muscle is examined under the microscope, it is found to  consist of cells, each one of which is physiologically in all  essentials like an amoeba, so that we may say that a muscle or other  tissue or organ is really a sort of colony of cells of similar  structure and function, all working in harmony like a happy family. We  actually do find colonies of unicellular animals much like amoeba,  so that the muscle-cells and all other cells of the body may be  compared to amoeba and other one-celled animals.    But while in such unicellular creatures all functions are properties  of the individual cell, among higher forms _systems_ take the place of  the protoplasm of the single cell. There is a circulatory system, a  respiratory system, etc.; but we must once more point out that such  systems are made up of cells, so that every function of the highest  animal may be finally reduced to what takes place in the unicellular  animal. A circulatory system consists of a heart and blood-vessels,  all filled with blood, which latter is \"the life,\" as was known from  the earliest times; yet this same blood is of no more use for the  nourishment of the body while it is contained in those tubes which  constitute the blood-vessels than is bread locked up in a pantry to a  hungry boy. That which really provides the nutriment for the body is a  fluid derived from the blood, a something like the liquid part of  blood and known as _lymph_. This latter is to the cells of any tissue,  as a muscle, as is the water filled with the food on which an amoeba  lives. In like manner, in spite of the complicated apparatus which  supplies oxygen and removes carbon dioxide, the respiratory system,  respiration is finally the work of the cell, as in amoeba; a  muscle-cell respires exactly as does the one-celled animal.    When we consider the marvellous complexity of structure of one of the  higher animals, and the amazing variety of its functions, the question  naturally arises as to how all this is brought about without any sort  of clashing of the interests of one part with those of another. Why is  it that the stomach has enough and not too much blood? By what means  has Nature solved the problem of supplying more oxygen to parts in  action than to those at rest? How is it that one set of muscles acts  with instead of antagonizing another set, as in any complicated series  of movements, such as walking?    To bring about this harmonization, or _co-ordination_, the nervous  system has been provided. As the nervous and muscular systems are of  preeminent importance in voice-production, they will now be considered  with more detail than it is necessary to give to other systems.    Complicated as is the nervous system, modern advances in the sciences  of anatomy and physiology have made the comprehension of the subject  easier. It is now known that the nervous system, in spite of its wide  ramifications, is also made up of cells which are structurally and  functionally related to each other, and make connection with every  part of the whole community, the body. A nerve-cell, or _neurone_, may  be very complicated in its structure because of its many branches  or extensions from the main body of the cell.    [Illustration: FIG. 4. Body of a nerve-cell of the spinal cord,  specially stained so as to show the minute structure. (Schaefer's  _Histology_.)]    [Illustration: FIG. 5. A large nerve-cell from the spinal cord of the  ox, magnified 175 diameters. (Schaefer.)]    [Illustration: FIG. 6. A cell of another form, from the superficial or  outer part of the greater brain (cortex cerebri). The great amount of  branching is suggestive of the power to receive and to transmit  nervous influences (impulses) from various other cells; in other  words, complexity of structure suggests a corresponding complexity of  function.]    [Illustration: FIG. 7. Representation of the manner in which a nerve  is seen to terminate in a muscle, such ending being one form of  \"nerve-ending\" termed a \"muscle plate.\" It tends to emphasize the  close relationship existing between muscle and nerve, and to justify  the expression \"neuro-muscular mechanism,\" the nervous system being as  important for movements as the muscles. (Schaefer's _Histology_.)]    [Illustration: FIG. 8. Three muscle-fibres lying beside each other,  with the small blood-vessels (capillaries) around and between them.  Such are the appearances presented under the microscope by skeletal or  striped muscles such as those of the larynx. (Schaefer.)]    It may be said, in general terms, that the nervous _centres_, the  brain and the spinal cord, which are parts of one anatomical whole,  are characterized by the presence of the cell-bodies as well as their  extensions, while nerves consist only of the extensions or arms of the  cell-bodies. The nerve-cell whose body is in the top of the brain may  have an extension or arm which may reach practically to the end of the  spinal cord, and there make communication with another cell whose arm,  in turn, may reach as far as the toe. Such nerve arms or extensions  constitute the _nerve-fibres_, and bundles of these _nerves_, or  _nerve-trunks_.    Usually nerve-fibres make connection with the cells of an organ by a  special modification of structure known as a _nerve-ending_. A nervous  message or influence (_nerve-impulse_) may pass either to the  centre--_i.e._, toward a cell-body--or from it; in other words, a  nervous impulse may originate in the centre or in some organ more or  less distant from it; a nervous impulse may be _central_ or  _peripheral_. Nearly all central impulses, we now know, arise because  of the peripheral ones. One may illustrate this important relation by  a telegraph system. The message a railroad operator sends out--_e.g._,  that which determines whether a train is to be held at a certain  station or sent on--might depend wholly on information received from  another office. The extra flow of blood to the stomach when food  enters it is owing to such a relation of things. The food acts as a  stimulus to the ends of the nerve-fibres, and, in consequence, there  is an ingoing (_afferent_) message or impulse, and, by reason of this,  an outgoing (_efferent_) one to the muscle-cells of the small  blood-vessels, owing to which they contract less strongly and the  calibre of these vessels is increased; hence more blood reaches the  smallest vessels of all (_capillaries_.) Such a physiological relation  of things is termed _reflex action_. For such reflex action there are  required structurally at least two neurones or nerve-cells, and  functionally a stimulus of a certain strength and quality. Of course,  if more blood passes to the stomach there must be less somewhere else,  as the total volume of the blood is limited. The value of the  knowledge of such a fact is obvious. It must be unwise to exercise  vigorously immediately after meals, for this determines blood to the  muscles which would serve a better purpose in the digestive organs.  For a like reason the singer who would do his best before the public  will refrain from taking a large meal before appearing.    As this subject of reflex action is of the highest importance, the  reader is advised to make himself thoroughly familiar with the  principles involved before perusing the future chapters of this work.  Fig. 16 shows the structural relations for reflex action. It also  indicates how such nervous relations may be complicated by other  connections of the nerve-cells involved in the reflex action. It will  be seen that they make many upward connections with the brain, in  consequence of which consciousness may be involved. Ordinarily one is  more or less conscious of reflex action, though the will is not  involved; in fact, a willed or voluntary action is usually considered  the reverse of a reflex or involuntary action. But for a reflex action  the brain is not essential. As is well known, a snake's hinder part  will move in response to a touch when completely severed from the head  end; and movements of considerable complexity can be evoked in a  headless frog.    Herein, then, lies the solution of the problem. This is Nature's way  of bringing one part into harmonious relations with another. As by a  telegraphic system the most distant parts of a vast railway system may  be brought into harmonious working, so is it with the body by means of  the nervous system. The nerve-centres correspond to the heads of the  railway system, or, perhaps more correctly, to the various officials  resident in some large city who from this centre regulate the affairs  of the whole line.    The muscular system is made up of cells of two kinds, those  characteristic of the muscles used in ordinary movements, and those  employed for the movements of the internal organs. The muscles of the  limbs are made up of striped muscle-cells; those of the stomach, etc.,  of unstriped cells. These latter are "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19881"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Carlisle (#6)"],[1," within ten  days on pain of excommunication with bell, book, and candle. Its  revenues, according to the rotuli, called the king's books, which were  made up in the reign of Henry VIII., were valued at L 3, 2s. 8d. per  annum.\"[3]      [3] \"History of Carlisle,\" page 158.    Some very fine foliated brackets can be seen in the arch between this  chapel and the choir aisle.    Dividing the chapel from the transept and aisle is some exquisite carved  screen-work (Late Decorated) dating from the latter part of the  fifteenth century, and attributed to Prior Gondibour. Its great beauty,  and the skilful variations of the designs, will repay careful  inspection. The chapel now serves as a vestry for the clergy: but it is  to be regretted that it cannot add to the beauty of the cathedral by  being utilised for its proper purpose.    The pointed doorway on the left, originally opened on to a well which  was closed in the course of the restoration of the building. The  position of Carlisle on the border making it liable to sudden attacks in  early times, it is probable that the inhabitants may have taken  sanctuary in the cathedral many a time, when a well of water would be of  great advantage to the refugees.    #Monuments in the Transepts.#--North Transept. Near the entrance to the  north choir aisle stands the altar-tomb of Prior Senhouse. It is covered  with a slab of dark blue marble. An inscription runs thus: \"The tomb of  Simon Senhouse, Prior of Carlisle in the reign of Henry VII. The  original inscription being lost, the present plate was substituted by  the senior male branch of the Senhouse family, A.D. 1850. Motto, 'Lothe  to offend.'\"    It was on this tomb that the tenants of the priory were accustomed to  pay their rents.    South Transept.--On a stone in the west wall (now covered with a pane of  glass) is an inscription which was discovered in 1853. It is written  in Norse runes, and is as follows:--      \"Tolfihn yraita thasi rynr a thisi stain.\"    \"Tolfihn wrote these runes on this stone.\"    The runes are Norse, not Anglo-Saxon. The latter are not often found,  but the former are scarcer still. The runes, perhaps, date from the  eleventh century.    [Illustration: SCREEN--ST. CATHERINE'S CHAPEL. From Billings.]    There is also a marble tablet containing a medallion likeness of George  Moore.      \"A man of rare strength and simplicity of character,    of active benevolence and wide influence.    A yeoman's son    he was not born to wealth    but by ability and industry he gained it,    and he ever used it    as a steward of God and a disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ    for the furtherance of all good works.\"    George Moore was born at Mealsgate, Cumberland, the 9th April 1806. He  went to London in 1825. Two years later he was working for Fisher,  Stroud & Robinson, lace merchants, as town traveller, and, soon after,  as traveller in the north of England. He was so successful that he was  nicknamed \"The Napoleon of Watling Street.\" When he was twenty-three he  accepted an offer from a firm of lace merchants, Groucock & Copestake,  to become a partner. He gave up travelling for orders in 1841, but soon  suffered in health. As a remedy he took to following the hounds, and  later (in 1844) went on a three months' trip to America. On his return  he started on his career of philanthropy which has made him famous. A  few of the institutions for which he worked, and to which he contributed  largely, may be mentioned; the Cumberland Benevolent Society, the  Commercial Travellers' Schools, the British Home for Incurables, the  Warehousemen and Clerks' Schools, the Royal Free Hospital, and the  London City Mission. Various Cumberland charities found in him a  generous supporter. He met with his death in Carlisle. Knocked down by a  runaway horse, 20th November 1876, while on his way to attend a meeting  of the Nurses' Institution, he died the next day from his injuries.  The following was a favourite motto with him:--        \"What I spent, I had,      What I saved, I lost,      What I gave, I have.\"    [Illustration: THE CHOIR, LOOKING WEST. _A. Pumphrey, Photo._]    There is a memorial tablet to Robert Anderson, \"the Cumberland Bard,\"  1770-1833. Born in Carlisle, he had but little schooling, and at ten  years of age he was earning wages as assistant to a calico printer;  later, he was bound apprentice to a pattern-drawer in his native city.  He went to London to pursue his calling, and he seems to have been led  to attempt to write poetry through hearing some imitation Scottish songs  sung at Vauxhall. He published his first volume in 1798, and his  Cumberland Ballads in 1805. His verses, not altogether destitute of real  poetry, are valuable for the pictures they give of obsolete manners and  customs of the district.    The #Choir.#--A low doorway in the eastern arch of the tower gives  entrance to the choir. Some of the woodwork of the stalls fills the  lower part of this arch, and the entrance has been placed towards the  north, so as to open exactly on the centre of the choir. In point of  beauty the choir compares favourably with any we possess in England, and  the eye can rest upon it again and again with renewed satisfaction and  delight. Its superb main arcade, with the boldly-designed and  finely-carved capitals representing the twelve months of the  year--unrivalled in this country; its handsome clerestory windows; its  great east window (the pride of the cathedral); and, overhead, its  richly-coloured roof, unique in shape, afford a combination not easily  to be surpassed.    The choir is about 134 feet long, 34 feet 6 inches wide between the  columns, and 72 feet 6 inches between the aisle walls.    The nave is not so wide by about 12 feet, and as the columns of both  nave and choir on the south side are on the same line, the extra width  is all on the north.    Looking westward, the view is marred by the tower arch not being in the  centre of the west wall, in consequence of which there is an ugly space  of blank wall between the arch and the north choir aisle.    There are eight bays, averaging about 18 feet in width. Those at the  end, however, east and west, are not so wide. At the east they probably  suffer from the intrusion of the east wall, which is about six feet  thick. The western bays may have lost the space taken for the choir  entrance. They have very acute arches, and at the west end rest on  responds or half-piers against the tower walls. Those at the east end  rest on brackets, and their mouldings lose themselves in the wall on  each side of the great window.    The presbytery is reached by two steps from the choir, and the last bay  but one (in which the altar stands) is raised three steps above the  presbytery.    The main arcade practically dates from after the terrible fire in 1292.  The arches escaped, and are splendid specimens of Early English, \"of the  Pointed style in all the purity of its first period.\" They were  underbuilt with Early Decorated piers, while the capitals were finished  at the same time as the triforium and clerestory (Late Decorated)  1350-1400.    The piers are not equal in diameter to those of the nave; they measure  but five feet and a quarter. Each consists of eight clustered pillars of  red sandstone. The four facing the cardinal points of the compass are  larger than the intermediate ones, which are filleted. The base moulding  is very deep and hollow. These piers support the Early English arches,  with dog-tooth ornament large in the interior, small in the exterior.  Altogether, these fine arches give a very pleasing impression of  lightness and grace, and make us feel \"the fascination of the Pointed  style.\"    At the junctions of the arches are small grotesque heads very well  executed. On the north side, where the presbytery begins, is a queen's  head, and on the opposite side a figure with a dog's head.    There are altogether fourteen complete, and two half piers, the capitals  of which are carved with foliage alone, or with the addition of winged  monsters, birds, beasts, and human figures. Twelve of them represent the  domestic and agricultural occupations of the months. The first capital  on the south side (east end) shows a creature with a man's head, wings,  and a tail terminating in the head of a serpent, which bites the monster  on the temple. January is symbolised on the next one, and the series  continues westward, then crosses over, and proceeds from west to east on  the north side, finishing at the last pier but one.    _January._--A figure in a loose-fitting tunic, sitting down. He has  three faces--two in profile--and is drinking with the right and left  mouths. At his feet is a third vessel.    _February._--A man in a loose tunic, and head closely wrapped up. He  appears to suffer from cold, for his face is woe-begone, and he is  sitting over a fire, holding out one boot upside down as if to drain  water from it, while he lifts up one foot to catch the heat. The  fireplace is very skilfully carved.    _March._--A man, hood on head, digging with a spade at the foot of a  leafless tree. Other decorations are, a squirrel, a bear with hands,  birds, and a beast's body with a mitred head.    _April._--A bare-legged man with his head tied up, pruning a tree. On  this capital are also two figures half-human, half-bestial, clasping  each other round the neck.    [Illustration: ONE BAY OF THE CHOIR.]    _May._--A woman in a long gown holding in each hand a bunch of foliage,  which she offers to a young man clad in a tunic, with his hood thrown  back. In addition there are three winged beasts with human heads, one  mitred.    _June._--A horseman, bareheaded, holding on his right hand a hawk, and  bearing a branch of roses in his left hand. There are also some  half-human figures, and men playing musical instruments. This capital is  more elaborately carved than any of the others.    _July._--A man mowing. In addition there are"]]]
