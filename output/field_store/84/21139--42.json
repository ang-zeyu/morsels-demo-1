[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21728"],[0,"The Dog Crusoe and his Master (#6)"],[1,"be named, was well-known among the hunters and  the Red-skins of the border-lands, and in Dick's hands its bullets were  as deadly as its owner's eye was quick and true.    Crusoe's education, too, had been completed.  Faithfully and patiently  had his young master trained his mind, until he fitted him to be a meet  companion in the hunt.  To \"carry\" and \"fetch\" were now but trifling  portions of the dog's accomplishments.  He could dive a fathom deep in  the lake and bring up any article that might have been dropped or thrown  in.  His swimming powers were marvellous, and so powerful were his  muscles, that he seemed to spurn the water while passing through it,  with his broad chest high out of the curling wave, at a speed that  neither man nor beast could keep up with for a moment.  His intellect  now was sharp and quick as a needle; he never required a second bidding.  When Dick went out hunting he used frequently to drop a mitten or a  powder-horn unknown to the dog, and, after walking miles away from it,  would stop short and look down into the mild, gentle face of his  companion.    \"Crusoe,\" he said, in the same quiet tones with which he would have  addressed a human friend, \"I've dropped my mitten, go fetch it, pup.\"  Dick continued to call it \"pup\" from habit.    One glance of intelligence passed from Crusoe's eye, and in a moment he  was away at full gallop; nor did he rest until the lost article was  lying at his master's feet.  Dick was loath to try how far back on his  track Crusoe would run if desired.  He had often gone back five and six  miles at a stretch; but his powers did not stop here.  He could carry  articles back to the spot from which they had been taken and leave them  there.  He could head the game that his master was pursuing and turn it  back; and he would guard any object he was desired to \"watch\" with  unflinching constancy.  But it would occupy too much space and time to  enumerate all Crusoe's qualities and powers.  His biography will unfold  them.    In personal appearance he was majestic, having grown to an immense size  even for a Newfoundland.  Had his visage been at all wolfish in  character, his aspect would have been terrible.  But he possessed in an  eminent degree that mild, humble expression of face peculiar to his  race.  When roused or excited, and especially when bounding through the  forest with the chase in view, he was absolutely magnificent.  At other  times his gait was slow, and he seemed to prefer a _quiet_ walk with  Dick Varley to anything else under the sun.  But when Dick was inclined  to be boisterous Crusoe's tail and ears rose at a moment's notice, and  he was ready for _anything_.  Moreover, he obeyed commands instantly and  implicitly.  In this respect he put to shame most of the _boys_ of the  settlement, who were by no means famed for their habits of prompt  obedience.    Crusoe's eye was constantly watching the face of his master.  When Dick  said \"Go\" he went, when he said \"Come\" he came.  If he had been in the  midst of an excited bound at the throat of a stag, and Dick had called  out, \"Down, Crusoe,\" he would have sunk to the earth like a stone.  No  doubt it took many months of training to bring the dog to this state of  perfection; but Dick accomplished it by patience, perseverance, and  _love_.    Besides all this, Crusoe could speak!  He spoke by means of the dog's  dumb alphabet in a way that defies description.  He conversed, so to  speak, with his extremities--his head and his tail.  But his eyes, his  soft brown eyes, were the chief medium of communication.  If ever the  language of the eyes was carried to perfection, it was exhibited in the  person of Crusoe.  But, indeed, it would be difficult to say which part  of his expressive face expressed most.  The cocked ears of expectation;  the drooped ears of sorrow; the bright, full eye of joy; the half-closed  eye of contentment; and the frowning eye of indignation accompanied with  a slight, a very slight, pucker of the nose and a gleam of dazzling  ivory--ha! no enemy ever saw this last piece of canine language without  a full appreciation of what it meant.  Then as to the tail--the  modulations of meaning in the varied wag of that expressive member!  Oh!  it's useless to attempt description.  Mortal man cannot conceive of the  delicate shades of sentiment expressible by a dog's tail, unless he has  studied the subject--the wag, the waggle, the cock, the droop, the  slope, the wriggle!  Away with description--it is impotent and valueless  here!    As we have said, Crusoe was meek and mild.  He had been bitten, on the  sly, by half the ill-natured curs in the settlement, and had only shown  his teeth in return.  He had no enmities--though several enemies--and he  had a thousand friends, particularly among the ranks of the weak and the  persecuted, whom he always protected and avenged when opportunity  offered.  A single instance of this kind will serve to show his  character.    One day Dick and Crusoe were sitting on a rock beside the lake--the same  identical rock near which, when a pup, the latter had received his first  lesson.  They were conversing as usual, for Dick had elicited such a  fund of intelligence from the dog's mind, and had injected such wealth  of wisdom into it, that he felt convinced it understood every word he  said.    \"This is capital weather, Crusoe; ain't it pup?\"    Crusoe made a motion with his head which was quite as significant as a  nod.    \"Ha! my pup, I wish that you and I might go and have a slap at the  grizzly bars and a look at the Rocky Mountains.  Wouldn't it be nuts,  pup?\"    Crusoe looked dubious.    \"What, you don't agree with me!  Now, tell me, pup, wouldn't ye like to  grip a bar?\"    Still Crusoe looked dubious, but made a gentle motion with his tail, as  though he would have said, \"I've seen neither Rocky Mountains nor  grizzly bars, and know nothin' about 'em, but I'm open to conviction.\"    \"You're a brave pup,\" rejoined Dick, stroking the dog's huge head  affectionately.  \"I wouldn't give you for ten times your weight in  golden dollars--if there be sich things.\"    Crusoe made no reply whatever to this.  He regarded it as a truism  unworthy of notice; he evidently felt that a comparison between love and  dollars was preposterous.    At this point in the conversation a little dog with a lame leg hobbled  to the edge of the rocks in front of the spot where Dick was seated, and  looked down into the water, which was deep there.  Whether it did so for  the purpose of admiring its very plain visage in the liquid mirror, or  finding out what was going on among the fish, we cannot say, as it never  told us; but at that moment a big, clumsy, savage-looking dog rushed out  from the neighbouring thicket and began to worry it.    \"Punish him, Crusoe,\" said Dick quickly.    Crusoe made one bound that a lion might have been proud of, and seizing  the aggressor by the back, lifted him off his legs and held him,  howling, in the air--at the same time casting a look towards his master  for further instructions.    \"Pitch him in,\" said Dick, making a sign with his hand.    Crusoe turned and quietly dropped the dog into the lake.  Having  regarded his struggles there for a few moments with grave severity of  countenance, he walked slowly back and sat down beside his master.    The little dog made good its retreat as fast as three legs would carry  it, and the surly dog, having swam ashore, retired sulkily, with his  tail very much between his legs.    Little wonder, then, that Crusoe was beloved by great and small among  the well-disposed of the canine tribes of the Mustang Valley.    But Crusoe was not a mere machine.  When not actively engaged in Dick  Varley's service, he busied himself with private little matters of his  own.  He undertook modest little excursions into the woods or along the  margin of the lake, sometimes alone, but more frequently with a little  friend whose whole heart and being seemed to be swallowed up in  admiration of his big companion.  Whether Crusoe botanised or geologised  on these excursions we will not venture to say.  Assuredly he seemed as  though he did both, for he poked his nose into every bush and tuft of  moss, and turned over the stones, and dug holes in the ground--and, in  short, if he did not understand these sciences, he behaved very much as  if he did.  Certainly he knew as much about them as many of the human  species do.    In these walks he never took the slightest notice of Grumps (that was  the little dog's name), but Grumps made up for this by taking excessive  notice of _him_.  When Crusoe stopped, Grumps stopped and sat down to  look at him.  When Crusoe trotted on, Grumps trotted on too.  When  Crusoe examined a bush Grumps sat down to watch him, and when he dug a  hole Grumps looked into it to see what was there.  Grumps never helped  him; his sole delight was in looking on.  They didn't converse much,  these two dogs.  To be in each other's company seemed to be happiness  enough--at least Grumps thought so.    There was one point at which Grumps stopped short, however, and ceased  to follow his friend; and that was when he rushed headlong into the lake  and disported himself for an hour at a time in its cool waters.  Crusoe  was, both by nature and training, a splendid water-dog.  Grumps, on the  contrary, held water in abhorrence, so he sat on the shores of the lake  disconsolate when his friend was bathing, and waited till he came out.  The only time when Grumps was thoroughly nonplussed, was when Dick  Varley's whistle sounded faintly in the far distance.  Then Crusoe would  prick up his ears, and stretch out at full gallop, clearing ditch, and  fence, and brake with his strong elastic bound, and leaving Grumps to  patter after him as fast as his four-inch legs would carry him.  Poor  Grumps usually arrived at the village, to find both dog and master gone,  and would betake himself to his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21736"],[0,"The Gorilla Hunters (#6)"],[1,"deducts a percentage for its  trouble, the price dwindles down as it goes, until a mere trifle,  sometimes nothing at all, remains to be handed over to the unfortunate  people of the tribe who originally sent off the goods for sale.  Of  course, such a system almost paralyses trade.  But the intermediate  tribes between the coast and the interior being the gainers by this  system, are exceedingly jealous of anything like an attempt to carry on  direct trade.  They are ready to go to war with the tribes of the  interior, should they attempt it, and they throw all the opposition they  can in the way of the few white men who ever penetrate the interior for  such a purpose.    It will thus be seen that our travels would be hindered very much, if  not stopped altogether, and ourselves be regarded with jealousy, or  perhaps murdered, if our motives in going inland were not fully and  satisfactorily explained to the different tribes as we passed through  their lands.  And we therefore proposed to overcome the difficulty by  taking a native guide with us from the tribe with which we should chance  to be residing when obliged to separate from the Portuguese trader.    We had now reached this point.  The day before that on which we encamped  in the woods, as above related, we arrived at a native village, and had  been received kindly by the king.  Almost immediately after our arrival  we heard so many stories about gorillas that I felt persuaded we should  fall in with one if we went a-hunting, and being exceedingly anxious to  add one to my collection of animals--for I had a small museum at home--I  prevailed on Jack and Peterkin to go one day's journey into the bush to  look for them.  They laughed very much at me indeed, and said that we  were still very far away from the gorilla country; but I had read in  some work on Africa a remark to the effect that there is no cordillera,  or mountain range, extending across the whole continent to limit the  _habitat_ of certain classes of animals, and I thought that if any  animal in Africa would not consent to remain in one region when it  wished to go to another, that animal must be the ferocious gorilla.  The  trader also laughed at me, and said that he had never seen any himself  in that region, and that we would have to cross the desert before seeing  them.  Still, I felt a disposition to try; besides, I felt certain that  we should at least fall in with some sort of animals or plants or  minerals that would be worth collecting; so it was agreed that we should  go out for a single day, and be back in time for a great elephant-hunt  which was about to take place.    But to return from this digression.  Having finished breakfast, we made  three bundles or packages of our blankets, provisions, and camp  equipage; strapped them on our backs; and then, shouldering our rifles,  set out on our return to the negro village.    Of course we gave Jack the largest and heaviest bundle to carry.  Peterkin's and mine were about equal, for although I was taller than  Peterkin, I was not by any means so powerful or active.  I often  wondered at the great strength that lay in the little frame of my  friend.  To look at him, no one would believe that he was such a tough,  wiry, hardy little fellow.  He was the same hearty, jovial creature that  I had lived with so pleasantly when he and Jack and I were cast away on  the coral island.  With the exception of a small scrap of whisker on  each cheek, a scar over the right eye, and a certain air of manliness,  there was little change in my old comrade.    \"Ralph,\" said Jack, as we strode along through the forest, \"do you  remember how we three used to wander about together in the woods of our  coral island?\"    \"Remember!\"  I cried with enthusiasm, for at that moment the thought  occurred to my own mind; \"how can I ever forget it, Jack?  It seems to  me just like yesterday.  I can hardly believe that six long years have  passed since we drank that delicious natural lemonade out of the green  cocoa-nuts, and wandered on the coral beach, and visited Penguin Island,  and dived into the cave to escape the pirates.  The whole scene rises up  before me so vividly that I could fancy we were still there.  Ah! these  were happy times.\"    \"So they were,\" cried Peterkin; \"but don't you go and become  sentimentally sad, Ralph, when you talk of those happy days.  If we were  happy there, are we not happy _here_?--There's no change in us--except,  indeed, that Jack has become a gorilla.\"    \"Ay, and you a monkey,\" retorted Jack.    \"True; and Ralph a naturalist, which is the strangest beast of all,\"  added Peterkin.--\"Can you tell me, Ralph, by the way, what tree that  is?\"    \"I'm sure I cannot tell.  Never saw or heard of one like it before,\" I  replied, looking at the tree referred to with some interest.  It was a  fine tree, but the great beauty about it was the gorgeous fruit with  which it was laden.  It hung in the form of bunches of large grapes, and  was of the brightest scarlet colour.  The glowing bunches seemed like  precious gems glittering amongst the green foliage, and I observed that  a few monkeys and several parrots were peeping at us through the  branches.    \"It seems good for food,\" said Jack.  \"You'd better climb up, Peterkin,  and pull a few bunches.  The puggies won't mind you, of course, being  one of themselves.\"    \"Ralph,\" said Peterkin, turning to me, and deigning no reply to Jack,  \"you call yourself a naturalist; so I suppose you are acquainted with  the habits of monkeys, and can turn your knowledge to practical  account.\"    \"Well,\" I replied, \"I know something about the monkey tribes, but I  cannot say that at this moment I remember any particular habit of which  we might avail ourselves.\"    \"Do you not?  Well, now, that's odd.  I'm a student of nature myself,  and I have picked up a little useful knowledge in the course of my  travels.  Did you ever travel so far as the Zoological Gardens in  London?\"    \"Of course I have done so, often.\"    \"And did you ever observe a peculiar species of monkey, which, when you  made a face at it, instantly flew into a towering passion, and shook the  bars of its cage until you expected to see them broken?\"    \"Yes,\" said I, laughing; \"what then?\"    \"Look here, you naturalist, and I'll put a wrinkle on your horn.  Yonder  hangs a magnificent bunch of fruit that I very much desire to possess.\"    \"But it's too high to reach,\" said I.    \"But there's a monkey sitting beside it,\" said Peterkin.    \"I see.  You don't expect him to pull it and throw it down, do you?\"    \"Oh no, certainly not; but--\" Here Peterkin stepped up to the tree, and  looking up at the monkey, said, \"O-o-o-oo-o!\" angrily.    \"_O-o-o-oo-oo_!\" replied the monkey, stretching out its neck and looking  down with an expression of surprise and indignation, as if to say, \"What  on earth do you mean by that?\"    \"Oo-o-o-oo-o!\" roared Peterkin.    Hereupon the monkey uttered a terrific shriek of passion, exposed all  its teeth and gums, glared at its adversary like a little fiend, and  seizing the branch with both hands, shook it with all its might.  The  result was, that not only did the coveted bunch of fruit fall to the  ground, but a perfect shower of bunches came down, one of which hit Jack  on the forehead, and, bursting there, sent its fragrant juice down his  face and into his beard, while the parrots and all the other monkeys  took to flight, shrieking with mingled terror and rage.    \"You see I'm a practical man,\" observed Peterkin quietly, as he picked  up the fruit and began to eat it.  \"Knowledge is power, my boy.  A man  with a philosophical turn of mind like yourself ought to have been up to  a dodge of this sort.  How capital this fruit is, to be sure!--Does it  make good pomade, Jack?\"    \"Excellent; but as I'm not in the habit of using pomade, I shall wash  this out of my beard as quickly as possible.\"    While Jack went to a brook that ran close to where we stood, I tasted  the fruit, and found it most excellent, the pulp being juicy, with a  very pleasant flavour.    While we were thus engaged a wild pig ran grunting past us.    \"Doesn't that remind you of some of our doings on the coral island,  Ralph?\" said Peterkin.    Before I could reply a herd of lovely small gazelles flew past.  Our  rifles were lying on the ground, and before either of us could take aim  the swift creatures were lost sight of in the thick underwood.  Peterkin  fired one shot at a venture, but without any result.    We were still deploring our stupidity in not having our rifles handy,  when a strange sound was heard in the distance.  By this time Jack had  come up, so we all three seized our rifles and listened intently.  The  sound was evidently approaching.  It was a low, dull, booming roar,  which at one moment seemed to be distant thunder, at another the cry of  some huge animal in rage or pain.  Presently the beating of heavy hoofs  on the turf and the crash of branches were heard.  Each of us sprang  instinctively towards a tree, feeling that if danger were near its trunk  would afford us some protection.    Being ignorant, as yet, of the cries of the various wild beasts  inhabiting those woods, we were greatly at a loss to determine what  creature it could be that approached at such headlong speed.  That its  mad career was caused by fear soon became apparent, for the tones of  terror either in man or beast, when distinctly heard, cannot be  mistaken.    Immediately in front of the spot where we stood was an open space or  glade of considerable extent.  Towards this the animal approached, as  was evident from the increasing loudness of its wild roar, which was  almost continuous.  In another moment the thick wall of underwood at its  farther extremity was burst asunder with a crash, and a wild buffalo  bull bounded into the plain and dashed madly across.  On its neck was  crouched a leopard, which had fixed its claws and"]]]
