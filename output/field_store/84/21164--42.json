Dr. Orrin Morris and Dr. John Earl were graduated from the same class in  the Harvard medical school, but Dr. Morris had immediately after  graduation settled down to the exclusive practice of surgery according  to orthodox methods, and was already regarded as one of the rising young  surgeons of New York City.    His father had met with financial reverses in 1907 that had not only  wrecked the family fortune but had carried him to an untimely grave. His  mother had been dead for some years and he had no brother or sister. He  maintained a house on East 57th Street and had much practice in two of  the prominent hospitals.    Dr. Morris presented a rather angular appearance as he strode away with  Miss Holland. He was excessively lean, of swarthy complexion, dark eyes,  black hair and a domineering air. His mother had possessed a strain of  that Spanish blood that was freely mixed with the Moors during their  occupancy of Spain, and added to the natural tendencies of the Latin  were visible some of the ear-marks of Moorish intensity. For some months  he had been paying marked attention to Miss Holland, whom he had known  in a general way for a long time, and, while she did not encourage him,  she had not thought it necessary to dismiss him, for she found him most  entertaining, as he was regarded as one of the best non-professional  violinists in New York. They had spent many agreeable evenings together  over their music, she playing the accompaniments on the piano.    His views on public questions were as set and conservative as were his  views on medicine, and she never attempted to discuss those matters with  him; the fact that she could not do so was somewhat a relief to her when  she desired to get away from her public activities.    Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey, Dr. Morris and Miss Holland, and the two young men  with other ladies of their acquaintance, joined in the last dance and  then started for the cloakrooms together.          CHAPTER V    HYPNOTISM USED FOR AN ANAESTHETIC      Mrs. Ramsey and Miss Holland emerged from the dressing-rooms after a  trifling delay, and found Hilda's party and Dr. Morris waiting in the  foyer. Just as they were about making their way to their respective  motors they heard a sudden commotion and wild cries from the street, and  a crowd of people surged in, crying that a child had been killed by an  automobile. Both Dr. Earl and Dr. Morris rushed toward the street as a  man came in carrying a little girl of perhaps ten years of age, bleeding  profusely from the mouth and the scalp, with one leg evidently broken.  The mother of the child, a comely woman of thirty, followed, wringing  her hands. Her excitement verged on hysteria, but at the sight of Dr.  Morris she controlled herself by a mighty effort.    \"To the hospital, to the hospital, Dr. Earl,\" peremptorily exclaimed Dr.  Morris, as Dr. Earl threw aside his coat and, rolling back his sleeves  and directing the man to place the child on a table in one of the  ante-rooms, began to examine the character of the injuries.    \"Oh, don't take my poor child to the hospital. I know she will die if  she goes there; bring her home; it is only a few blocks,\" the mother  pleaded with Dr. Morris, whom she seemed to know.    \"Don't waste time here. Where is the telephone? I will call an ambulance  immediately.\"    \"I don't want her taken to the hospital,\" said the woman sullenly.    \"This is no place to operate on a hysterical child,\" Morris answered.  \"She need not be kept in the hospital, but she should certainly be taken  there. I know Dr. Earl will agree with me.\"    In the meantime, Earl had completed his examination. Silvia Holland was  watching him anxiously. As Morris spoke he looked up and caught her eye.    \"It is only a simple fracture, and the scalp wounds are slight. I  suppose we could get along, if we can get hot water and the necessary  appliances,\" he said dubiously, and then added, turning to the woman,  \"Dr. Morris is quite right, madame, in advising the hospital, and I  assure you there is no danger.\"    The woman turned pleading eyes to Silvia. \"She's all I have, and I can't  let her be taken away from me. Couldn't we go home? It is only a few  blocks away, and I know I can make her comfortable. Oh, please, please  don't let them take her away!\"    Miss Holland looked at Dr. Earl and put her arm around the woman  protectingly. \"If it isn't any worse than that,\" she said hesitatingly,  \"don't you think you could do as she asks? Setting a simple fracture  isn't a very complicated operation, is it?\"    Earl smiled. \"Oh, no,\" he said, \"it can be done in a comparatively few  minutes.\"    \"Then why not do it,\" she said, \"and spare the mother all this  protracted agony, and get the child home?\"    \"Because there are no appliances here to administer an anaesthetic or do  anything else properly,\" answered Morris impatiently, \"and no one can  tell from a cursory examination whether or not there are other injuries,  to say nothing of the danger from septicaemia if the work is done in a  clumsy, slipshod manner.\"    Earl colored, and Miss Holland replied with some spirit that even the  absence of the usual accessories need not imply clumsiness of method,  and again asked Earl if he could not manage where they were. He turned  to the mother.    \"If you insist upon it, I have no doubt that I can do all that is  necessary without bad results. As to the anaesthetic, we can dispense  with that.\"    \"I will have nothing to do with the case under these circumstances,\"  Morris said angrily.    The woman hesitated, and then said firmly, \"I should prefer the other  gentleman to take charge. I won't have her taken to the hospital.\"    \"Very well,\" said Earl, and taking a notebook from his pocket he wrote  out a list of necessary appliances, bandages, alcohol, antiseptic  solutions, surgeon's scissors, needles, silk and thread, and giving it  to Frank bade him hurry to the drug-store around the corner which  carried surgical supplies and procure them, and also to bring a box that  would do for splints.    \"I must have an assistant,\" he said, and without a word, Miss Holland  improvised an apron from some of the bunting that was in evidence  everywhere, and put herself at his disposal. He sent all the others out  of the room, and bent over the child for a few minutes. What did he do?  Miss Holland watched, but could not tell. The moaning ceased, the little  limbs relaxed, and the child fell into a quiet sleep.    The mother stood just outside the door, listening with strained  attention, and after two or three impatient turns about the foyer,  Morris joined her.    \"You can do as you please so far as I am concerned,\" he said in a low  tone, \"but I warn you that you are taking big risks. Allie is nervous  and excitable at any time, and to-night she is close to hysterics, and  she won't get over the shock of even a simple operation in a hurry,  especially if he is fool enough to attempt it without an anaesthetic.\"    The woman wavered for a moment, and then turned away without a word, and  shrugging his shoulders Morris strode down toward the entrance. A moment  later Silvia Holland came out of the ante-room.    \"You can go in now,\" she said, \"only don't disturb your child; she is  sleeping and you must be very quiet. Did you see Dr. Morris? Oh, there  he is.\"    Mindful of the amenities of life, she hurried to his side. His face was  dark with something more than anger, and did not lighten as she laid the  tips of her fingers on his arm.    \"I know you will excuse me, Orrin,\" she said gently. \"You mustn't be  angry with me, but I really feel as if I ought to see this through; the  poor woman needs me. You will forgive me?\"    He looked at her with sudden passion. \"Oh, yes, I forgive _you_,\" he  said, with unmistakable emphasis on the pronoun, and was gone. Silvia  Holland looked after him for a moment, conscious that, accustomed as she  was to his moods, this was quite a new one, and then joined Dr. Earl,  who had come into the foyer to say goodnight to the Ramseys and Frank  Earl, who had returned with the surgical appliances and found nothing  more that he could do. \"By the way, old man,\" Dr. Earl called to his  brother-in-law, \"send the machine back if you don't mind,\" and with a  word of thanks he re-entered the ante-room, followed by Miss Holland,  and closed the door against further interruption.    There was a sink in the room, with hot and cold water, and he directed  Miss Holland to cleanse the basin and implements in the boiling water,  and follow this up by dipping them in an antiseptic solution; in the  meantime he ripped the box to pieces, and selected two strips, which he  whittled into splints, shaping them to the child's leg, and working with  great rapidity. The bandages, cotton and other things were laid out upon  the table, and then he took the basin and a cloth and washed the wounds  on the head, putting back the tousled locks as carefully and tenderly as  a woman.    \"Ordinarily,\" he said to his assistant, \"I should have done this first,  but my examination showed that this injury is very slight. Of course she  has bled profusely, but it has come from the nose, and it looks pretty  bad, but there is nothing serious. Half a dozen stitches will be ample  for the scalp. Thread that needle with the silk, please. Now let me have  it.\" He took it from her, and in a moment the cuts on the head were  sewed, and he was pulling the leg into place, applying the cotton, the  splints and bandages, working deftly and silently. \"The other needle  with the thread, please,\" he said, not looking up, and Miss Holland  handed it to him. Presently he raised his head and threw back his  shoulders.    \"It is all done,\" he said simply, and called the mother. \"I shall return  in a quarter of an hour,\" he said, \"and bring her out of this sleep. Do  not try to rouse her, for you cannot. Do you not think, Miss Holland,  that it would"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22288"],[0,"Chinese Painters: A Critical Study (#6)"],[1,"e, and through tone values and  gradations of shades, he endeavored to create the same feeling of  atmosphere and space which he had been able to express with _luo-ts'ing_.  No original picture remains to inform us to what extent he succeeded, but  by means of monochrome paintings of the Sung period which owe their  inspiration to him, the importance of the reform accomplished, and the  tendencies manifested in those lost works of art may be divined.    Another master whose work can be defined with sufficient accuracy to cite  as an illustration of a different aspect of the history of painting during  the T'ang period, is Han Kan, who lived in the middle of the eighth  century and who is celebrated as a painter of horses.    The sculptured stones of the Han dynasty, especially the admirable  bas-reliefs of the tomb of Chao-ling, representing the favorite coursers  of the emperor T'ai-tsung, show the manner in which artists, from the  third to the seventh centuries, were capable of studying and delineating  the postures of the horse. It is therefore not surprising to find a great  animal painter in the eighth century. Beyond question he was not the  first. The written records have preserved the names of several of his  predecessors and while the honor of having been the great founder of a  school was attributed to him, it is possible that this refers only to an  artistic movement bearing his name, of which he was not the sole  representative.    But the work of Han Kan and the unknown artists grouped around him,  proclaims a powerful tradition, a well grounded school of animal painters  which had attained the highest eminence. It was destined to exert a  strong influence upon painters of horses in the Yuean epoch and even when,  later on, this great tradition is seen disappearing, cloying and insipid,  amidst the mannerisms of the Ming period, it will still retain sufficient  power to carry thus far a reflection of the vigor and vitality attained in  the great periods.    The painting of _Flowers and Birds_, and _Plants and Insects_ appears to  have been already established at this time. The flowers and plants are  drawn according to the methods of _double contour_ and _single contour_,  worked over and brought out with that intensity of analysis to which  allusion has been made. The bird is caught in its most subtle movement,  the insect studied in its essential structure.    Thus we see that Chinese painting had extended its investigations in every  direction and had solved the problems found along its path. It had  absorbed foreign influences, altered its conception of the divine and  found a new type of figure. It had endowed landscape painting with all the  resources of atmospheric perspective and had established the two essential  styles of the North and the South. The painter was master of the visible;  his thought dominated form and was able to express itself with freedom.          V. THE SUNG PERIOD--TENTH TO THIRTEENTH CENTURIES      The T'ang period had been the golden age of Chinese poetry. It had  witnessed an extraordinary outburst of religious fervor, and the  overwhelming domination of Buddhism. It had, moreover, triumphantly  re-established the unity of the empire and to the pride of intellectual  activity it could add the pride of might and dominion. But the same cannot  be said for the Sung period. From a political standpoint its history is  one of cumulative disaster. Ancient China retreated by degrees before the  thrusts of the barbarians, until the great thunderbolt of Genghis Khan's  conquest, reverberating with formidable echoes throughout all Asia,  announced the approaching downfall of culture in the red dawn of a new  era.    The Sung culture, totally different from that of the T'ang period, was,  however, swept forward to its culmination. It would seem as if, under the  menace of the barbarians, the mind had set for its goal the development of  ideas embryonic in earlier work, formulating them in haste and arresting  them finally in perfect yet sad images, in which the heights attained were  haunted by the shadow of impending ruin.      [Illustration: PLATE XI. LANDSCAPE BY MA LIN    Sung Period. Collection of R. Petrucci.]    The dynasty opened with a classical reaction against new ideas and  witnessed a return to Confucian philosophy, with its conception of the  State. But centuries of history had not rolled by without effect. In the  tenth and eleventh centuries the ancient writings were no longer  understood with their original meaning. A whole series of philosophers, of  whom the last is Chu Hsi (thirteenth century), had formulated a composite  doctrine resulting in what might be called an official philosophy, which  has dominated to the present day. Some bold spirits, however, opposed this  reactionary codification, struggling in vain to give a positive and firm  structure to the doomed empire. Their influence appears to have been  considerable. Just as the old heterodox philosophy was being stifled by  the dry and colorless metaphysics of the conservatives, it was awakened to  new life by the painters, who gave it a stirring interpretation in their  work.    The period of technical research was past. At first, with care and  patience, forms had been determined by drawing. Color had remained a thing  apart, regarded as a work of illumination and quite distinct from drawing.  Then study was extended still further. Color came to be viewed in the  light of shades and tones and became one of the means for the expression  of form; it became the very drawing itself,--that which reveals the basic  structure.    Wang Wei represents the moment when art, emancipating itself from problems  already solved, had conquered every medium of expression. Such is the  tradition which he bequeathed to the Sung artists, who were destined to  add thereto such supreme masterpieces.    The Sung painters were haunted by the old philosophical beliefs as to the  formation of the universe. Beyond the actual surroundings they dimly  perceived a magic world made up of perfect forms. Appearances were but the  visible covering of the two great principles whose combination engendered  life. They believed that, in painting, they did more than to reproduce the  external form of things. They labored with the conviction that they were  wresting the soul from objects, in order to transfer it to the painted  silk. Thus they created something new, an imaginary world more beautiful  than the real world, wherein the intimate relation of beings and things  was disclosed,--a world pervaded by pure spirit and one which was revealed  only to those whose thought was sufficiently enlightened, and whose  sympathies were sufficiently broad, to understand and to be stirred.    The painters of the line of Wang Wei during the Sung period, devoted  themselves chiefly to the development of painting in monochrome. They  pursued the study of relations of tones and values of shading up to the  limit of extreme delicacy, and if they mingled color at all with their  subtle evocations, it was with a feeling of unequalled restraint. They  dwelt for the most part in intimacy with Nature. Fleeing from the cares  of court and city, they retired into mountain solitudes, meditating for  long periods before taking up the brush to paint. Thus they portrayed  those mountains enveloped in mists, wherein was revealed the harmony of  the two principles which control the universe. From the depths of valleys  misty vapors arose and cedars and gigantic pines reared their majestic  forms, while, on the threshold of a thatched cabin upon some rocky  plateau, a hermit deep in meditation contemplated the vast expanse of a  landscape of august grandeur.      [Illustration: PLATE XII. MONGOL HORSEMAN RETURNING FROM THE HUNT    By Chao Meng-fu. Yuean Period. Doucet Collection.]    Sometimes, turning to plant forms, they painted the bamboo in black and  white. A single masterly stroke sufficed to draw the cylindrical stalk  from one joint to another, or the pointed leaves which are so quivering  with life that we seem to hear the plaintive voice of the wind \"combed,\"  as the Chinese writings express it, \"by the reeds.\" Or again, when a  flower was the subject, they suggested it with a simplicity that  presupposes a scientifically exact study of forms. It was by no means the  splendid image which they sought to grasp but the soul itself; at one time  the flower barely open in all its enchanting freshness, at another the  softened petals drooping in languid fashion, revealing a splendor still  present but soon to fade; at times the dew moistening the leaves, the snow  shrouding them with its purity, or the slow monotonous rain beneath which  they drip, motionless. These paintings are always instinct with deep  poetic feeling.    At the hands of the Sung painters the school of landscape and monochrome  technique attained a level which will never be exceeded. The masters of  this period are numerous and are frequently represented by works of almost  certain authenticity. It seems useless to assemble here names which will  convey no meaning to the European reader. It will suffice to illustrate by  a few great figures the three centuries of history during which Chinese  landscape painting reached its culminating point.    Tung Yuean and Chue Jan are considered by the critics as having founded a  special school in the great tradition of Wang Wei. Their paintings were  quiet in coloring and were executed with broad strokes in an impressionist  style. These works must be viewed from a distance to see their apparent  violence merge into extreme elegance. They furnish a complete  demonstration of the laws of atmospheric perspective, with its feeling of  distance and infinite space, in which forms are immersed. Here we find  evidence that these painters were the first to attempt the arrangement of  lines according to rule, which led ultimately to calligraphic painting.   "]]]
