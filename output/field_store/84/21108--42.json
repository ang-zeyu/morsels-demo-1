In our own western country there dwells a bird known as the Phalarope,  the females of which enjoy {47} an immunity from domestic duties that  might cause the lady Hornbill many an envious sigh did she know of the  freedom of her American sister.    Mrs. Phalarope has no intention of being shut in with her eggs for a  month while her mate goes roaming at large about the country, nor has  she any idea of playing the part of the Georgia Mockingbird and  bringing five-sixths of the food which the young require.  Her method  of procedure is first to permit her mate to search for a suitable  nesting site.  When some sheltered spot in the ground, quite to her  liking, has been found she deposits the eggs and goes her way.  Little  companies of female Phalaropes may be seen at this time of the year  frequenting the ponds and sloughs they inhabit.  The dutiful and  well-trained males are all at home, where they are responsible for the  entire task of caring for, and incubating, the eggs.    _Length of Mated Life._--The length of time which birds remain mated is  a question often asked but seldom answered satisfactorily.  The truth  of the {48} matter is that not much is known about the subject.  Apparently a great many birds return to the same yard and even to the  same tree to build their nest year after year.  I say apparently  because such birds are seldom marked in such a way as to enable one to  be positive that they are the identical individuals which came the year  before.  It is probably somewhere near the truth to say that most small  birds usually choose the same mates year after year if both survive the  dangers of winter and in spring meet again on their old trysting  grounds.  It is safe to assert that as a rule birds retain the same  mates throughout the breeding season if misfortune does not befall one  of them.  During the fall and winter months, when the impulses  governing domestic duties are dormant, birds pay little or no attention  to their mates.    [Illustration: A mountain Bluebird family.  Its home having been  destroyed it is now enjoying temporary quarters furnished by a kindly  hand.]    _A Much-married Bluebird._--One spring a pair of Bluebirds came into  our yard, and to the accompaniment of much cheerful bird conversation,  in the form of whistles, twitters, chirps, and snatches of {49} song,  began hunting eagerly for some place to locate a nest.  Out in the  woodshed I found a box, perhaps six inches square and twice as long.  Cutting a small entrance hole on one side, I fastened the box seven or  eight feet from the ground on the side of a young tree.  The newcomers  immediately took possession and began carrying dry grasses into their  adopted sanctuary.  Several days elapsed and then one morning, while  standing on the back of a garden settee and peeping into the hole, I  discovered that a pale-blue egg had been laid.  When the nest contained  four of these little beauties incubation began.    One rainy night while the mother bird was on duty she must have heard  the scratching of claws on the box outside.  A moment later two yellow  eyes blazed at the entrance and a long arm reached into the nest.  The  next morning on the grass beneath the window we found her wing tips and  many other fragments of her plumage.  All that day the distressed mate  flew about the lawn and called continually.  He seemed to gather but  little food and {50} the evidence of his suffering was pitiful.  In  fact, he stirred our feelings to such a pitch we at length closed the  windows to shut out the sounds of his mournful calls.    Upon looking out next morning, the first note we heard was that of a  Bluebird, but his voice seemed to have lost some of its sorrow.  Walking around the corner of the house, I found him sitting on a limb  near the box.  Two feet from him sat another Bluebird--a female.  At  eleven o'clock we saw her clinging to the side of the box and looking  inquiringly into the entrance hole.  We knew what this meant;  incidentally we knew, too, that being a ladybird she would have no use  for the nest and eggs that had been placed there by another, so I  cleaned out the box.    We were anxious that the cat should have no chance to destroy our  little friend's second wife, so the box was suspended from a limb by a  wire over two feet in length.  Five eggs were laid and the mother bird  began sitting.  Then one night the cat {51} found out what was  happening.  How she ever succeeded in her undertaking, I know not.  She  must have started by climbing the tree and creeping out on the limb.  I  have never seen a cat slide down a wire; nevertheless the next morning  the box was tenantless and the feathers of the second female were  scattered over the lawn.  This time the Bluebird's heart seemed really  broken and his cries of lamentation filled the grove.  Eleven days now  passed before a third soul-mate came to share his fortunes.  We could  afford to take no more risks.  On a sunny hillside in the garden the  cat was buried, and a few weeks later four little Bluebirds left the  lawn on their own wings.    _The Faithful Canada Geese._--Along the Atlantic Coast, where the  shooting of wildfowl is an important industry with many people, the  raising of Canada Geese is a common custom.  Not only do these great  birds serve as food, but they play the part of decoys when their owners  go ahunting.  They are genuine Wild Geese, some of them having been  {52} wounded and captured from the great flocks which frequent these  waters during the colder months of the year.  They retain their wild  characteristics with great tenacity and it is necessary to keep them  pinioned to prevent their flying away to the North when in spring the  spirit of migration calls aloud to all the bird world.    [Illustration: Canada Geese Decoys]    {53}    The conduct of these decoys indicates that the losing of a mate is a  much more serious matter among them than with the Bluebird and others  of our small feathered friends.  When a gander has chosen his goose and  she has accepted his advances, the pair remain constantly together,  summer and winter, as long as they live.  If one is killed, many years  may elapse before the survivor selects another companion.    In Currituck County, North Carolina, there was not long ago a gander  that local tradition said was sixty-two years of age.  The first thirty  years of his life he remained unmated and for the last thirty-two he  has been the proud possessor of a mate from whose side he has never  strayed.    These Geese do not mate readily, and a man who has a company of thirty  or forty may well be satisfied if six or eight pairs of them are mated.  The truth of this statement is proved by the fact that on the local  market a single Goose is worth about one dollar, while a pair of mated  Geese will readily bring five dollars.    {54}    _Unmated Birds._--A little reflection will make the student realize the  fact that out in the fields and woods, in the swamps and on the  mountains, on the beaches, as well as far away on the ocean, there are  many birds that are not mated.  Among them are widows and widowers,  heartfree spinsters and pining bachelors.  Just what per cent. of the  bird life is unmated in any one season it would, of course, be  impossible to tell.  The information which the writer has gathered by a  careful census of a certain species in a given limited territory  enabled him to determine that in this particular case only about  three-fifths of the individuals are mated any one season.    _Polygamy Among Birds._--As with mankind, some races have  well-developed tendencies toward polygamy.  In the warmer regions of  the United States there dwells a great, splendid, glossy Blackbird, the  Boat-tailed Crackle.  The nest of this bird is a wonderfully woven  structure of water plants and grasses and is usually built in a bush  growing in the {55} water.  When you find one nest of the Crackle you  are pretty certain to find several other occupied nests in the  immediate vicinity.  From three to six of these marvellous cradles,  with their quiet brown female owners, often appear to be watched over  by one shining, iridescent lord Crackle, who may be husband to them  all.  He guards his own with jealous care.  Evidently, too, he desires  the whole country to know that he is the most handsome, ferocious bird  on the earth; for all day long his hoarse shoutings may be heard, and  when he launches into the air, the sound of the ponderous beating of  his wings can, on a still day, be heard half a mile away, across the  lake.    One of the best-known polygamous birds of North America is the Wild  Turkey.  Go into any part of the country where this fast-disappearing  game bird still survives, and the experienced local gunners will tell  you that in the mating season you will usually find a gobbler  accompanied by two or more Turkey hens.  When a female gets ready to  make her nest she slips away from her sultan and the other members {56}  of the seraglio and, going to some broom-sedge field or open place in  the woods, constructs her nest on the ground beneath some slight,  convenient shelter.  Day after day she absents herself for a short  time, and the speckled treasures grow in number until from twelve to  fifteen have been deposited.  All this time her movements are  characterized by absolute secrecy, for if the gobbler by any chance  comes upon the nest he immediately breaks every egg.  He is perhaps  wise enough to know that when his hens begin to set lonely times are in  store for him.    _The Outcast._--One of our wild birds whose domestic relations are not  fully understood is strongly suspected of being promiscuously  polygamous.  Suspicion on this point is heightened by the fact "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21012"],[0,"The Loyalists of America and Their Times, Vol. 1 of 2.
