So little Mr. Squirrel studied how to please old King Bear,  and he grew fat on the good things which other people had earned.    \"One day old King Bear gave little Mr. Squirrel six big, fat nuts. You  see, old King Bear didn't care for nuts himself, not the kind with the  hard shells, anyway, so he really wasn't as generous as he seemed, which  is the way with a great many people. It is easy to give what you don't  want yourself. Little Mr. Squirrel bowed very low and thanked old King  Bear in his best manner. He really didn't want those nuts, for his  stomach was full at the time, but it wouldn't do to refuse a gift from  the king. So he took the nuts and pretended to be delighted with them.    \"'What shall I do with them?' said little Mr. Squirrel as soon as he was  alone. 'It won't do for me to leave them where old King Bear will find  them, for it might make him very angry.' At last he remembered a certain  hollow tree. 'The very place!' cried little Mr. Squirrel. 'I'll drop  them in there, and no one will be any the wiser.'    \"No sooner thought of than it was done, and little Mr. Squirrel frisked  away in his usual happy-go-lucky fashion and forgot all about the nuts  in the hollow tree. It wasn't very long after this that Old Mother  Nature began to hear complaints of old King Bear and his rule in the  Green Forest. He had grown fat and lazy, and all his relatives had grown  fat and lazy because, you see, none of them had to work for the things  they ate. The little forest and meadow people were growing tired of  feeding the Bear family. It was just at the beginning of winter when Old  Mother Nature came to see for herself what the trouble was. It didn't  take her long to find out. No, Sir, it didn't take her long. You can't  fool Old Mother Nature, and it's of no use to try. She took one good  look at old King Bear nodding in the cave where he used to sleep. He was  so fat he looked as if he would burst his skin.    \"Old Mother Nature frowned. 'You are such a lazy fellow that you shall  be king no longer. Instead, you shall sleep all winter and grow thin and  thinner till you awake in the spring, and then you will have to hunt  for your own food, for never again shall you live on the gifts of  others,' said she.    \"All the little forest and meadow people who had been bringing tribute,  that is things to eat, to old King Bear rejoiced that they need do so no  longer and went about their business. All of old King Bear's family,  including his cousin Mr. Coon, had been put to sleep just like old King  Bear himself. Yes, Sir, they were all asleep, fast asleep.    \"Little Mr. Squirrel felt lonesome. He grew more lonesome every day.  None of the other little people would have anything to do with him  because they remembered how he had lived without working when he was the  favorite of King Bear. The weather was cold, and it was hard work to  find anything to eat. Mr. Squirrel was hungry all the time. He couldn't  think of anything but his stomach and how empty it was. He grew thin and  thinner.    \"One cold day when the snow covered the earth, little Mr. Squirrel went  without breakfast. Then he went without dinner. You see, he couldn't  find so much as a pine-seed to eat. Late in the afternoon he crept into  a hollow tree to get away from the cold, bitter wind. He was very tired  and very cold and very, very hungry. Tears filled his eyes and ran over  and dripped from his nose. He curled up on the leaves at the bottom of  the hollow to try to go to sleep and forget. Under him was something  hard. He twisted and turned, but he couldn't get in a comfortable  position. Finally he looked to see what the trouble was caused by. What  do you think he found? Six big, fat nuts! Yes, Sir, six big, fat nuts!  Little Mr. Squirrel was so glad that he cried for very joy.    \"When he had eaten two, he felt better and decided to keep the others  for the next day. Then he began to wonder how those nuts happened to be  in that hollow tree. He thought and thought, and at last he remembered  how he had hidden six nuts in this very hollow a long time before, when  he had had more than he knew what to do with. These were the very nuts,  the present of old King Bear.    \"Right then as he thought about it, little Mr. Squirrel had a bright  idea. He made up his mind that thereafter he would stop his  happy-go-lucky idleness, and the first time that ever he found plenty of  food, he would fill that hollow tree just as full as he could pack it,  and then if there should come a time when food was scarce, he would  have plenty. And that is just what he did do. The next fall when nuts  were plentiful, he worked from morning till night storing them away in  the hollow tree, and all that winter he was happy and fat, for he had  plenty to eat. He never had to beg of any one. He had learned to save.    \"And ever since then the Squirrels have been among the wisest of all the  little forest people and always the busiest.        \"The Squirrel family long since learned       That things are best when duly earned;       That play and fun are found in work       By him who does not try to shirk.    \"And that's all,\" finished Grandfather Frog.    \"Thank you! Thank you, Grandfather Frog!\" cried Peter Rabbit.                                          VII                     HOW LIGHTFOOT THE DEER LEARNED TO JUMP                                          VII                     HOW LIGHTFOOT THE DEER LEARNED TO JUMP      It isn't often that Peter Rabbit is filled with envy. As a rule, Peter  is very free from anything like envy. Usually he is quite content with  the gifts bestowed upon him by Old Mother Nature, and if others have  more than he has, he is glad for them and wastes no time fretting  because he has not been so fortunate. But once in a great while Peter  becomes really and truly envious. It was that way the first time he saw  Lightfoot the Deer leap over a fallen tree, and ever after, when he saw  Lightfoot, a little of that same feeling stirred in his heart. You see,  Peter always had been very proud of his own powers of jumping. To be  sure Jumper the Hare could jump higher and farther than he could, but  Jumper is his own cousin, so it was all in the family, so to speak, and  Peter didn't mind. But to see Lightfoot the Deer go sailing over the  tops of the bushes and over the fallen trees as if he had springs in his  legs was quite another matter.    \"I wish I could jump like that,\" said Peter right out loud one day, as  he stood with his hands on his hips watching Lightfoot leap over a pile  of brush.    \"Why don't you learn to?\" asked Jimmy Skunk with a mischievous twinkle  in the eye which Peter couldn't see. \"Lightfoot couldn't always jump  like that; he had to learn. Why don't you find out how? Probably  Grandfather Frog knows all about it. He knows about almost everything.  If I were you, I'd ask him.\"    \"I--I--I don't just like to,\" replied Peter. \"I've asked him so many  questions that I am afraid he'll think me a nuisance. I tell you what,  Jimmy, you ask him!\" Peter's eyes brightened as he said this.    Jimmy chuckled. \"No, you don't!\" said he. \"If there is anything you want  to know from Grandfather Frog, ask him yourself. I don't want to know  how Lightfoot learned to jump. He may jump over the moon, for all I  care. Have you seen any fat beetles this morning, Peter?\"    \"No,\" replied Peter shortly. \"I'm not interested in beetles. There may  never be any fat beetles, for all I care.\"    Jimmy laughed. It was a good-natured, chuckling kind of a laugh. \"Don't  get huffy, Peter,\" said he. \"Here's hoping that you learn how to jump  like Lightfoot the Deer, and that I get a stomachful of fat beetles.\"  With that Jimmy Skunk slowly ambled along down the Crooked Little Path.    Peter watched him out of sight, sighed, started for the dear Old  Briar-patch, stopped, sighed again, and then headed straight for the  Smiling Pool. Grandfather Frog was there on his big green lily-pad, and  Peter wasted no time.    \"How did Lightfoot the Deer learn to jump so splendidly, Grandfather  Frog?\" he blurted out almost before he had stopped running.    Grandfather Frog blinked his great, goggly eyes. \"Chug-a-rum!\" said he.  \"If you'll jump across the Laughing Brook over there where it comes into  the Smiling Pool, I'll tell you.\"    Peter looked at the Laughing Brook in dismay. It was quite wide at that  point. \"I--I can't,\" he stammered.    \"Then I can't tell you how Lightfoot learned to jump,\" replied  Grandfather Frog, quite as if the matter were settled.    \"I--I'll try!\" Peter hastened to blurt out.    \"All right. While you are trying, I'll see if I can remember the story,\"  replied Grandfather Frog.    Peter went back a little so as to get a good start. Then he ran as hard  as he knew how, and when he reached the bank of the Laughing Brook, he  jumped with all his might. It was a good jump--a splendid jump--but it  wasn't quite enough of a jump, and Peter landed with a great splash in  the water! Grandfather Frog opened his great mouth as wide as he could,  which is very wide indeed, and laughed until the tears rolled down from  his great, goggly eyes. Jerry Muskrat and Billy Mink rolled over and  over on the bank, laughing until their sides ached. Even Spotty the  Turtle smiled, which is very unusual for Spotty.    Now Peter does not like the water, and though he can swim, he doesn't  feel at all at home in it. He paddled for the shore as fast as he could,  and in his heart was something very like anger. No one likes to be  laughed at. Peter intended to start for home the very minute he reached  the shore. But just before his feet touched bottom, he heard the great,  deep voice of Grandfather Frog.    \"That is just the way Lightfoot the Deer learned to jump--trying to do  what he couldn't do and keeping at it until he could.

The grass is rather scant, it's true,      But this a fair exchange is,     The sheep can see a lovely view      By climbing up the ranges.       And She-oak Flat's the station's name,      I'm not surprised at that, sirs:     The oaks were there before I came,      And I supplied the flat, sirs.     A man would wonder how it's done,      The stock so soon decreases --     They sometimes tumble off the run      And break themselves to pieces.       I've tried to make expenses meet,      But wasted all my labours,     The sheep the dingoes didn't eat      Were stolen by the neighbours.     They stole my pears -- my native pears --      Those thrice-convicted felons,     And ravished from me unawares      My crop of paddy-melons.       And sometimes under sunny skies,      Without an explanation,     The Murrumbidgee used to rise      And overflow the station.     But this was caused (as now I know)      When summer sunshine glowing     Had melted all Kiandra's snow      And set the river going.       And in the news, perhaps you read:      'Stock passings.  Puckawidgee,     Fat cattle:  Seven hundred head      Swept down the Murrumbidgee;     Their destination's quite obscure,      But, somehow, there's a notion,     Unless the river falls, they're sure      To reach the Southern Ocean.'       So after that I'll give it best;      No more with Fate I'll battle.     I'll let the river take the rest,      For those were all my cattle.     And with one comprehensive curse      I close my brief narration,     And advertise it in my verse --      'For Sale!  A Mountain Station.'          Been There Before           There came a stranger to Walgett town,      To Walgett town when the sun was low,     And he carried a thirst that was worth a crown,      Yet how to quench it he did not know;     But he thought he might take those yokels down,     The guileless yokels of Walgett town.       They made him a bet in a private bar,      In a private bar when the talk was high,     And they bet him some pounds no matter how far      He could pelt a stone, yet he could not shy     A stone right over the river so brown,     The Darling river at Walgett town.       He knew that the river from bank to bank      Was fifty yards, and he smiled a smile     As he trundled down, but his hopes they sank      For there wasn't a stone within fifty mile;     For the saltbush plain and the open down     Produce no quarries in Walgett town.       The yokels laughed at his hopes o'erthrown,      And he stood awhile like a man in a dream;     Then out of his pocket he fetched a stone,      And pelted it over the silent stream --     He had been there before:  he had wandered down     On a previous visit to Walgett town.          The Man Who Was Away           The widow sought the lawyer's room with children three in tow,     She told the lawyer man her tale in tones of deepest woe.     Said she, 'My husband took to drink for pains in his inside,     And never drew a sober breath from then until he died.       'He never drew a sober breath, he died without a will,     And I must sell the bit of land the childer's mouths to fill.     There's some is grown and gone away, but some is childer yet,     And times is very bad indeed -- a livin's hard to get.       'There's Min and Sis and little Chris, they stops at home with me,     And Sal has married Greenhide Bill that breaks for Bingeree.     And Fred is drovin' Conroy's sheep along the Castlereagh,     And Charley's shearin' down the Bland, and Peter is away.'       The lawyer wrote the details down in ink of legal blue --     'There's Minnie, Susan, Christopher, they stop at home with you;     There's Sarah, Frederick, and Charles, I'll write to them to-day,     But what about the other one -- the one who is away?       'You'll have to furnish his consent to sell the bit of land.'     The widow shuffled in her seat, 'Oh, don't you understand?     I thought a lawyer ought to know -- I don't know what to say --     You'll have to do without him, boss, for Peter is away.'       But here the little boy spoke up -- said he, 'We thought you knew;     He's done six months in Goulburn gaol -- he's got six more to do.'     Thus in one comprehensive flash he made it clear as day,     The mystery of Peter's life -- the man who was away.          The Man from Ironbark           It was the man from Ironbark who struck the Sydney town,     He wandered over street and park, he wandered up and down.     He loitered here, he loitered there, till he was like to drop,     Until at last in sheer despair he sought a barber's shop.     ''Ere! shave my beard and whiskers off, I'll be a man of mark,     I'll go and do the Sydney toff up home in Ironbark.'       The barber man was small and flash, as barbers mostly are,     He wore a strike-your-fancy sash, he smoked a huge cigar:     He was a humorist of note and keen at repartee,     He laid the odds and kept a 'tote', whatever that may be,     And when he saw our friend arrive, he whispered 'Here's a lark!     Just watch me catch him all alive, this man from Ironbark.'       There were some gilded youths that sat along the barber's wall,     Their eyes were dull, their heads were flat, they had no brains at all;     To them the barber passed the wink, his dexter eyelid shut,     'I'll make this bloomin' yokel think his bloomin' throat is cut.'     And as he soaped and rubbed it in he made a rude remark:     'I s'pose the flats is pretty green up there in Ironbark.'       A grunt was all reply he got; he shaved the bushman's chin,     Then made the water boiling hot and dipped the razor in.     He raised his hand, his brow grew black, he paused awhile to gloat,     Then slashed the red-hot razor-back across his victim's throat;     Upon the newly shaven skin it made a livid mark --     No doubt it fairly took him in -- the man from Ironbark.       He fetched a wild up-country yell might wake the dead to hear,     And though his throat, he knew full well, was cut from ear to ear,     He struggled gamely to his feet, and faced the murd'rous foe:     'You've done for me! you dog, I'm beat! one hit before I go!     I only wish I had a knife, you blessed murdering shark!     But you'll remember all your life, the man from Ironbark.'       He lifted up his hairy paw, with one tremendous clout     He landed on the barber's jaw, and knocked the barber out.     He set to work with tooth and nail, he made the place a wreck;     He grabbed the nearest gilded youth, and tried to break his neck.     And all the while his throat he held to save his vital spark,     And 'Murder!  Bloody Murder!' yelled the man from Ironbark.       A peeler man who heard the din came in to see the show;     He tried to run the bushman in, but he refused to go.     And when at last the barber spoke, and said, ''Twas all in fun --     'Twas just a little harmless joke, a trifle overdone.'     'A joke!' he cried, 'By George, that's fine; a lively sort of lark;     I'd like to catch that murdering swine some night in Ironbark.'       And now while round the shearing floor the list'ning shearers gape,     He tells the story o'er and o'er, and brags of his escape.     'Them barber chaps what keeps a tote, By George, I've had enough,     One tried to cut my bloomin' throat, but thank the Lord it's tough.'     And whether he's believed or no, there's one thing to remark,     That flowing beards are all the go way up in Ironbark.          The Open Steeplechase           I had ridden over hurdles up the country once or twice,     By the side of Snowy River with a horse they called 'The Ace'.     And we brought him down to Sydney, and our rider Jimmy Rice,     Got a fall and broke his shoulder, so they nabbed me in a trice --     Me, that never wore the colours, for the Open Steeplechase.       'Make the running,' said the trainer, 'it's your only chance whatever,     Make it hot from start to finish, for the old black horse can stay,     And just think of how they'll take it, when they hear on Snowy River     That the country boy was plucky, and the country horse was clever.     You must ride for old Monaro and the mountain boys to-day.'       'Are you ready?' said the starter, as we held the horses back,     All ablazing with impatience, with excitement all aglow;     Before us like a ribbon stretched the steeplechasing track,     And the sun-rays glistened brightly on the chestnut and the black     As the starter's words came slowly, 'Are -- you -- ready?  Go!'       Well, I scarcely knew we'd started, I was stupid-like with wonder     Till the field closed up beside me and a jump appeared ahead.     And we flew it like a hurdle, not a baulk and not a blunder,     As we charged it all together, and it fairly whistled under,     And then some were pulled behind me and a few shot out and led.       So we ran for half the distance, and I'm making no pretences     When I tell you I was feeling very nervous-like and queer,     For those jockeys rode like demons;       you would think they'd lost their senses     If you saw them rush their horses at those rasping five foot fences --     And in place of making running I was falling to the rear.       Till a chap came racing past me on a horse they called 'The Quiver',     And said he, 'My country joker, are you going to give it best?     Are you frightened of the fences? does their stoutness make you shiver?     Have they come to breeding cowards by the side of Snowy River?     Are there riders on Monaro?  ----' but I never heard the rest.       For I drove the Ace and sent him just as fast as he could pace it,     At the big black line of timber stretching fair across the track,     And he shot beside the Quiver.  'Now,' said I, 'my boy, we'll race it.     You can come with Snowy River if you're only game to face it,     Let us mend the pace a little and we'll see who cries a crack.'       So we raced away together, and we left the others"]]]
