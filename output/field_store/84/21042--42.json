You would, of course, rather have two subjects than a  repetition of one.    Well, supposing them sculptors, will not the same rule hold? You  naturally conclude at once that it will; but you will have hard work to  convince your modern architects of that. They will put twenty men to  work, to carve twenty capitals; and all shall be the same. If I could  show you the architects' yards in England just now, all open at once,  perhaps you might see a thousand clever men, all employed in carving the  same design. Of the degradation and deathfulness to the art-intellect of  the country involved in such a habit, I have more or less been led to  speak before now; but I have not hitherto marked its definite tendency  to increase the price of _work_, as such. When men are employed  continually in carving the same ornaments, they get into a monotonous  and methodical habit of labour--precisely correspondent to that in which  they would break stones, or paint house-walls. Of course, what they do  so constantly, they do easily; and if you excite them temporarily by an  increase of wages, you may get much work done by them in a little time.  But, unless so stimulated, men condemned to a monotonous exertion,  work--and always, by the laws of human nature, _must_ work--only at a  tranquil rate, not producing by any means a maximum result in a given  time. But if you allow them to vary their designs, and thus interest  their heads and hearts in what they are doing, you will find them become  eager, first, to get their ideas expressed, and then to finish the  expression of them; and the moral energy thus brought to bear on the  matter quickens, and therefore cheapens, the production in a most  important degree. Sir Thomas Deane, the architect of the new Museum at  Oxford, told me, as I passed through Oxford on my way here, that he  found that, owing to this cause alone, capitals of various design could  be executed cheaper than capitals of similar design (the amount of hand  labour in each being the same) by about 30 per cent.      33. Well, that is the first way, then, in which you will employ your  intellect well; and the simple observance of this plain rule of  political economy will effect a noble revolution in your architecture,  such as you cannot at present so much as conceive. Then the second way  in which we are to guard against waste is by setting our men to the  easiest, and therefore the quickest, work which will answer the purpose.  Marble, for instance, lasts quite as long as granite, and is much softer  to work; therefore, when you get hold of a good sculptor, give him  marble to carve--not granite.      34. That, you say, is obvious enough. Yes; but it is not so obvious how  much of your workmen's time you waste annually in making them cut glass,  after it has got hard, when you ought to make them mould it while it is  soft. It is not so obvious how much expense you waste in cutting  diamonds and rubies, which are the hardest things you can find, into  shapes that mean nothing, when the same men might be cutting sandstone  and freestone into shapes that meant something. It is not so obvious how  much of the artists' time in Italy you waste, by forcing them to make  wretched little pictures for you out of crumbs of stone glued together  at enormous cost, when the tenth of the time would make good and noble  pictures for you out of water-colour.      35. I could go on giving you almost numberless instances of this great  commercial mistake; but I should only weary and confuse you. I therefore  commend also this head of our subject to your own meditation, and  proceed to the last I named--the last I shall task your patience with  to-night. You know we are now considering how to apply our genius; and  we were to do it as economists, in three ways:--    To _various_ work;    To _easy_ work;    To _lasting_ work.      36. This lasting of the work, then, is our final question.    Many of you may perhaps remember that Michael Angelo was once commanded  by Pietro di Medici to mould a statue out of snow, and that he obeyed  the command.[6] I am glad, and we have all reason to be glad, that such  a fancy ever came into the mind of the unworthy prince, and for this  cause: that Pietro di Medici then gave, at the period of one great epoch  of consummate power in the arts, the perfect, accurate, and intensest  possible type of the greatest error which nations and princes can  commit, respecting the power of genius entrusted to their guidance. You  had there, observe, the strongest genius in the most perfect obedience;  capable of iron independence, yet wholly submissive to the patron's  will; at once the most highly accomplished and the most original,  capable of doing as much as man could do, in any direction that man  could ask. And its governor, and guide, and patron sets it to build a  statue in snow--to put itself into the service of annihilation--to make  a cloud of itself, and pass away from the earth.    [Note 6: See the noble passage on this tradition in \"Casa Guidi  Windows.\"]      37. Now this, so precisely and completely done by Pietro di Medici, is  what we are all doing, exactly in the degree in which we direct the  genius under our patronage to work in more or less perishable materials.  So far as we induce painters to work in fading colours, or architects to  build with imperfect structure, or in any other way consult only  immediate ease and cheapness in the production of what we want, to the  exclusion of provident thought as to its permanence and serviceableness  in after ages; so far we are forcing our Michael Angelos to carve in  snow. The first duty of the economist in art is, to see that no  intellect shall thus glitter merely in the manner of hoar-frost; but  that it shall be well vitrified, like a painted window, and shall be set  so between shafts of stone and bands of iron, that it shall bear the  sunshine upon it, and send the sunshine through it, from generation to  generation.      38. I can conceive, however, some political economist to interrupt me  here, and say, \"If you make your art wear too well, you will soon have  too much of it; you will throw your artists quite out of work. Better  allow for a little wholesome evanescence--beneficent destruction: let  each age provide art for itself, or we shall soon have so many good  pictures that we shall not know what to do with them.\"    Remember, my dear hearers, who are thus thinking, that political  economy, like every other subject, cannot be dealt with effectively if  we try to solve two questions at a time instead of one. It is one  question, how to get plenty of a thing; and another, whether plenty of  it will be good for us. Consider these two matters separately; never  confuse yourself by interweaving one with the other. It is one question,  how to treat your fields so as to get a good harvest; another, whether  you wish to have a good harvest, or would rather like to keep up the  price of corn. It is one question, how to graft your trees so as to grow  most apples; and quite another, whether having such a heap of apples in  the storeroom will not make them all rot.      39. Now, therefore, that we are talking only about grafting and growing,  pray do not vex yourselves with thinking what you are to do with the  pippins. It may be desirable for us to have much art, or little--we will  examine that by-and-bye; but just now, let us keep to the simple  consideration how to get plenty of good art if we want it. Perhaps it  might be just as well that a man of moderate income should be able to  possess a good picture, as that any work of real merit should cost  500_l._ or 1,000_l._; at all events, it is certainly one of the branches  of political economy to ascertain how, if we like, we can get things in  quantities--plenty of corn, plenty of wine, plenty of gold, or plenty of  pictures.    It has just been said, that the first great secret is to produce work  that will last. Now, the conditions of work lasting are twofold: it must  not only be in materials that will last, but it must be itself of a  quality that will last--it must be good enough to bear the test of time.  If it is not good, we shall tire of it quickly, and throw it aside--we  shall have no pleasure in the accumulation of it. So that the first  question of a good art-economist respecting any work is, Will it lose  its flavour by keeping? It may be very amusing now, and look much like a  work of genius; but what will be its value a hundred years hence?    You cannot always ascertain this. You may get what you fancy to be work  of the best quality, and yet find to your astonishment that it won't  keep. But of one thing you may be sure, that art which is produced  hastily will also perish hastily; and that what is cheapest to you now,  is likely to be dearest in the end.      40. I am sorry to say, the great tendency of this age is to expend its  genius in perishable art of this kind, as if it were a triumph to burn  its thoughts away in bonfires. There is a vast quantity of intellect and  of labour consumed annually in our cheap illustrated publications; you  triumph in them; and you think it so grand a thing to get so many  woodcuts for a penny. Why, woodcuts, penny and all, are as much lost to  you as if you had invested your money in gossamer. More lost, for the  gossamer could only tickle your face, and glitter in your eyes; it could  not catch your feet and trip you up: but the bad art can, and does; for  you can't like good woodcuts as long as you look at the bad ones. If we  were at this moment to come across a Titian woodcut, or a Duerer woodcut,  we should not like it--those of us at least who are accustomed to the  cheap work of the day. We don't like, and can't like, _that_ long; but  when we are tired of one bad cheap thing, we throw it aside and buy  another bad cheap thing; and so keep looking at bad things all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19998"],[0,"Rural Architecture (#6)"],[1," with  which to fill up and complete the design.          HOME EMBELLISHMENTS.      A discussion of the objects by way of embellishment, which may be  required to give character and effect to a country residence, would  embrace a range too wide, in all its parts, for a simply practical  treatise like this; and general hints on the subject are all indeed,  that will be required, as no specific rules or directions can be given  which would be applicable, indiscriminately, to guide the builder in the  execution of his work. A dwelling house, no matter what the style,  standing alone, either on hill or plain, apart from other objects, would  hardly be an attractive sight. As a mere representation of a particular  style of architecture, or as a model of imitation, it might excite our  admiration, but it would not be an object on which the eye and the  imagination could repose with satisfaction. It would be incomplete  unless accompanied by such associates as the eye is accustomed to  embrace in the full gratification of the sensations to which that organ  is the conductor. But assemble around that dwelling subordinate  structures, trees, and shrubbery properly disposed, and it becomes an  object of exceeding interest and pleasure in the contemplation. It is  therefore, that the particular style or outward arrangement of the house  is but a part of what should constitute the general effect, and such  style is to be consulted only so far as it may in itself please the  taste, and give benefit or utility in the purposes for which it is  intended. Still, the architectural design should be in harmony with the  features of the surrounding scenery, and is thus important in completing  the effect sought, and which cannot be accomplished without it.    A farm with its buildings, or a simple country residence with the  grounds which enclose it, or a cottage with its door-yard and garden,  should be finished sections of the landscape of which it forms a part,  or attractive points within it; and of consequence, complete each within  itself, and not dependent upon distant accessories to support it--an  _imperium in imperio_, in classic phrase. A tower, a monument, a  steeple, or the indistinct outline of a distant town may form a striking  feature in a pictorial design and the associations connected with them,  or, the character in which they are contemplated may allow them to stand  naked and unadorned by other objects, and still permit them to fill up  in perfect harmony the picture. This idea will illustrate the importance  of embellishment, not only in the substitution of trees as necessary  appendages to a complete rural establishment, but in the erection of all  the buildings necessary for occupation in any manner, in form and  position, to give effect from any point of view in which the homestead  may be seen. General appearance should not be confined to one quarter  alone, but the house and its surroundings on every side should show  completeness in design and harmony in execution; and although humble,  and devoted to the meanest purposes, a portion of these erections may  be, yet the character of utility or necessity which they maintain, gives  them an air of dignity, if not of grace. Thus, a house and out-buildings  flanked with orchards, or a wood, on which they apparently fall back for  support, fills the eye at once with not only a beautiful group, in  themselves combined, but associate the idea of repose, of comfort, and  abundance--indispensable requisites to a perfect farm residence. They  also seem to connect the house and out-buildings with the fields beyond,  which are of necessity naked of trees, and gradually spread the view  abroad over the farm until it mingles with, or is lost in the general  landscape.    These remarks may seem too refined, and as out of place here, and  trenching upon the subject of Landscape Gardening, which is not designed  to be a part, or but an incidental one of the present work, yet they are  important in connection with the subject under discussion. The proper  disposition of trees and shrubbery around, or in the vicinity of  buildings is far too little understood, although tree planting about our  dwellings is a practice pretty general throughout our country. Nothing  is more common than to see a man build a house, perhaps in most  elaborate and expensive style, and then plant a row of trees close upon  the front, which when grown will shut it almost entirely out of view;  while he leaves the rear as bald and unprotected as if it were a barn or  a horse-shed--as if in utter ignorance, as he probably is, that his  house is more effectively set off by a _flanking_ and _background_ of  tree and shrubbery, than in front. And this is called good taste! Let us  examine it. Trees near a dwelling are desirable for shade; _shelter_  they do not afford except in masses, which last is always better given  to the house itself by a veranda. Immediately adjoining, or within  touching distance of a house, trees create dampness, more or less  litter, and frequently vermin. They injure the walls and roofs by their  continual shade and dampness. They exclude the rays of the sun, and  prevent a free circulation of air. Therefore, _close_ to the house,  trees are absolutely pernicious, to say nothing of excluding all its  architectural effect from observation; when, if planted at proper  distances, they compose its finest ornaments.    If it be necessary to build in good taste at all, it is quite as  necessary that such good taste be kept in view throughout. A country  dwelling should always be a conspicuous object in its full character and  outline, from one or more prominent points of observation; consequently  all plantations of tree or shrubbery in its immediate vicinity should be  considered as aids to show off the house and its appendages, instead of  becoming the principal objects of attraction in themselves. Their  disposition should be such as to create a perfect and agreeable whole,  when seen in connection with the house itself. They should also be so  placed as to open the surrounding landscape to view in its most  attractive features, from the various parts of the dwelling. Much in the  effective disposition of trees around the dwelling will thus depend upon  the character of the country seen from it, and which should control to a  great extent their position. A single tree, of grand and stately  dimensions, will frequently give greater effect than the most studied  plantations. A ledge of rock, in the clefts of which wild vines may  nestle, or around which a mass of shrubbery may cluster, will add a  charm to the dwelling which an elaborate cultivation would fail to  bestow; and the most negligent apparel of nature in a thousand ways may  give a character which we might strive in vain to accomplish by our own  invention. In the efforts to embellish our dwellings or grounds, the  strong natural objects with which they are associated should be  consulted, always keeping in view an _expression_ of the chief character  to which the whole is applied.          MATERIAL FOR FARM BUILDINGS.      In a country like ours, containing within its soils and upon its surface  such an abundance and variety of building material, the composition of  our farm erections must depend in most cases upon the ability or the  choice of the builder himself.    Stone is the most durable, in the long run the cheapest, and as a  consequence, the _best_ material which can be furnished for the walls of  a dwelling. With other farm buildings circumstances may govern  differently; still, in many sections of the United States, even stone  cannot be obtained, except at an expense and inconvenience altogether  forbidding its use. Yet it is a happy relief that where stone is  difficult, or not at all to be obtained, the best of clay for bricks,  is abundant; and in almost all parts of our country, even where building  timber is scarce, its transportation is so comparatively light, and the  facilities of removing it are so cheap, that wood is accessible to every  one. Hence we may indulge in almost every fitting style of architecture  and arrangement, to which either kind of these materials are best  adapted. We shall slightly discuss them as applicable to our purposes.    Stone is found either on the surface, or in quarries under ground.  On the surface they lie chiefly as bowlders of less or greater size,  usually of hard and durable kinds. Large bowlders may be either blasted,  or split with wedges into sufficiently available shapes to lay in walls  with mortar; or if small, they may with a little extra labor, be fitted  by the aid of good mortar into equally substantial wall as the larger  masses. In quarries they are thrown out, either by blasting or splitting  in layers, so as to form regular courses when laid up; and all their  varieties may, _unhammered_, except to strike off projecting points or  angles, be laid up with a sufficiently smooth face to give fine effect  to a building. Thus, when easily obtained, aside from the greater  advantages of their durability, stone is as cheap in the first instance  as lumber, excepting in new districts of country where good building  lumber is the chief article of production, and cheaper than brick in any  event. Stone requires no paint. Its color is a natural, therefore an  agreeable one, be it usually what it may, although some shades are more  grateful to the eye than others; yet it is always in harmony with  natural objects, and particularly so on the farm where everything ought  to wear the most substantial appearance. The outer walls of a stone  house should always be _firred_ off inside for _lathing_ and plastering,  to keep them thoroughly dry. Without that, the rooms are liable to  dampness, which would penetrate through the stone into the inside  plastering unless cut off by an open space of air between.    Bricks, where stone is not found, supply its place"]]]
