In  the first place, we always do so somehow; and in the next, as our fleet  is commanded by one of the best admirals we have, there is no fear of  their being beaten. The only fear is that the fleet mayn't fall in with  the French until they have landed their troops.\"    \"The troops could not stand against our Mamelukes,\" Sidi said  scornfully. \"They would soon drive them into the sea.\"    \"I am not so sure of that,\" Edgar said. \"No doubt the Mamelukes are  splendid horsemen. I suppose they are as good as any in the world; but  horsemen cannot win a battle alone. The French infantry are very fine,  and I doubt whether any number of horsemen could break their squares.  Then their artillery is immensely superior to that of the Egyptians;  that will give them a very great advantage.\"    \"But if your fleet meets theirs and beats it, how could they ever get  back again?\"    \"I expect they mean to stay here and hold the country,\" Edgar said. \"I  don't know what good it would do to them; still I suppose they think it  would, or they would not take the trouble to come over. But if they  should take the country, it would be very bad for men like my father,  for they would be sure to put all the English in prison, and it would be  the ruin of their business.\"    \"Would they put you in prison?\"    \"I don't know; I expect so. They would hold all the English as  prisoners.\"    \"You would come out to us. You will be quite safe there. If their  soldiers came, they would never catch us; we could move about anywhere,  we know all the places where water is to be found, and they would only  die of thirst if they went after us into the desert.\"    \"Well, I hope that it is not going to be so, Sidi; but if the French  should land here I should like it very much. I suppose you would fight  against the French.\"    \"If they came to take Egypt, of course we should, and then you could see  it all, and fight with us against them.\"    \"It would be very jolly, Sidi, and I should like nothing better; but of  course I shall have to do as my father tells me. I expect he would shut  up his place, and get all his goods on board a ship and go away till it  was all over, if he was able. No doubt he would want me to go with him.\"    That evening Edgar learned that he had rightly guessed the steps that  his father would take in case a French army landed.    \"It is an awkward business, lad,\" he said. \"Of course if Nelson comes up  with the French fleet, we may hope that it will come out right; but if,  before he catches it, they manage to land twenty or thirty thousand  troops, our position here would be a most serious one. I intend to  charter the _Petrel_, which has just discharged the cargo she brought  here. I shall put all my most valuable goods on board at once,  especially all the Egyptian carpets and other oriental work, so that  within a few hours of hearing that their fleet was off the coast, I  should be ready to sail for England. Of course there would be an end to  the business here, so long as the French remained in Egypt; and no doubt  any British subjects they could lay their hands on would be thrown into  prison, just as was the case when they occupied Holland.    \"I should not, however, propose to shut up the house altogether, for  although we, as English, would be seized, and thrown into prison, and  the place closed, France is not at war with Germany, and Muller could  carry on the shipping business without interruption, his own name being  substituted for mine. I should instruct him to do no trade with the  interior; everything will be turned topsy-turvy, and all trade of that  sort would be at an end. On the other hand, with the French masters  here, a considerable number of French and Italian ships will be coming  in with stores of all kinds, these will often need supplies, repairs,  and so on; and as we have men capable of doing anything in the way of  refitting, Muller could keep things going, and carry on a business that  should pay all expenses, and would probably leave a margin of profit. At  any rate, the house would not go to wreck and ruin, and the business be  entirely lost.    \"I don't think the French occupation would be likely to last very many  months. You may be sure that there would be great efforts made at home.  A tremendous fleet would be sent out here, and the difficulties of  bringing in stores and reinforcements for the army would be enormous.  Possibly we too may land an army. Certainly we could nowhere fight the  French so advantageously as here; it would be the case of India over  again, as long as we are superior at sea, as we could bring troops here  more safely and more expeditiously than they could. However, that seems  to me the best arrangement we can make if the French land. To me it  would make no great difference, for, as you know, I had arranged to sail  in three weeks for England.    \"The only alteration would be that you must accompany me instead of  staying here. Even putting aside the fact that you would be made a  prisoner, you would, if you stayed here, be a hindrance rather than a  help to the business. Muller would carry it on as a purely German firm,  while if you were here it would be evident that I had merely left  temporarily, and that you were my representative. That would be fatal to  Muller doing business with the French.\"    \"I see that, father, although I must say that I would rather stop to see  the fun.\"    Mr. Blagrove smiled.    \"I don't suppose you would see much of it in any case, Edgar. However,  that is out of the question. I daresay my correspondents in London will  be able to take you into their office, or get you a situation of the  same kind elsewhere, so that if you stop in England a year you will not  be wasting your time. However, the French have not come yet, and I can  hardly think that they can intend to undertake an expedition, where,  even if our fleet is not strong enough to do so at once, it will ere  long certainly be raised to a point when it will completely cut them off  from France.\"    \"But even if they come, father, they may not succeed in conquering  Egypt. Don't you think that the Mamelukes will be able to make head  against them?\"    \"We don't know how strong the French are, but even if they come in great  force, if the Mamelukes were well handled, Edgar, they ought to be able  to prevent them from advancing far inland. They ought to hang in clouds  round them, driving in their cavalry whenever they ventured to leave the  shelter of their infantry fire. They ought to harass them night and day,  and prevent them obtaining supplies of any sort. I am afraid that  nothing of that kind will be done. The Mamelukes have been spoilt, and  they are so puffed up that they believe themselves to be invincible, and  that they have only to make a grand charge to sweep the French away.    \"However, it will make no great difference to us when we are once  fairly away, for of course I shall not think of returning here until  matters have settled down again. The French traders have had a bad time  of it since the war began, and most of them left long ago, for it was so  seldom that a vessel got through our cruisers that they could not rely  upon any regular supplies of goods. Of course, there are many small  shopkeepers who take their goods of me, and retail them out to the  natives, but all the importers left. I am afraid it is going to be our  turn now; that is, unless Nelson manages to intercept their fleet--no  very easy matter, for they might land anywhere along the coast between  this and Syria. But I imagine that their descent will take place near  this town, for from it they could follow the fresh-water canal to the  point where it flows from the Nile, and so on to Cairo.    \"They may, however, land at either the Damietta or Rosetta mouths of the  river; still, I think that they are more likely to come here, seeing  that the ships could more closely approach the shore.\"    The British fleet remained but a few hours off Alexandria. The short  Peace of Campo-Formio had caused the greater portion of the British  fleet to be recalled from the Mediterranean; and it was not until the  French preparations were almost complete that the news reached England  that a vast number of transports had been collected by the French at  various ports, that provisions of all kinds were being put on board, and  it was rumoured that an army was about to embark for some unknown  destination.    Nelson was at once sent off with a fleet to blockade Toulon, from which  port it was evident that the men-of-war intended to guard this great  fleet of transports would start. It arrived there on the first of June,  only to learn that the French fleet had set out three days previously.  The idea that Egypt was its destination had not entered the minds of the  British ministers, and although Nelson had been furnished with  instructions as to the course to be taken in the case of almost every  contingency, this had never been even discussed.    The French fleet consisted of 13 vessels of the line, 9 frigates, and 11  corvettes and despatch-boats. All of these, with the exception of a few  of the smaller vessels, were furnished by Toulon. Here, too, 20,500 men  had embarked in 106 transports. They were to be joined by 30 transports  from Marseilles, 20 from Corsica, 35 from Genoa, and 41 from Civita  Vecchia, bringing up the total to 232 transports, carrying 32,300 men.    In one arm the army was extremely deficient, as only 680 horses could be  put on board. Of these 300 were for the cavalry,--all of whom, however,  took with them saddles and bridles,--the rest were for the artillery and  train.

I grant that to ride  on a clear morning through the streets of a great city, or bowl along  the velvet roads of a picturesque countryside as one frequently does in  England is very delightful. To read Dickens' descriptions of journeys up  to London is to long to don a greatcoat, wind a muffler about one's  neck, and amid the cracking of whips and tooting of horns dash off  behind the horses for the fairy city his pen portrays. Who would not  have liked, for example, to set out with Mr. Pickwick for the Christmas  holidays at Dingley Dell? Why, you cannot even read about it without  seeing in your mind's eye the envious throng that crowded the inn yard  and watched while the stableboys loosed the heads of the leaders and the  steeds galloped away! And those marvelous country taverns he depicts,  with their roaring fires, their steaming roasts, their big platters of  fowl deluged in gravy, and their hot puddings! Was there ever writer  more tantalizing?\"    \"You will have us all hungry in two minutes, Dad, if you keep on,\"  exclaimed Stephen.    \"And Dickens has us hungry, too,\" declared Mr. Tolman. \"Nevertheless we  must not forget that he paints but one side of the picture. He fails to  emphasize what such a trip meant when the weather was cold and stormy,  and those outside the coach as well as those inside it were often  drenched with rain or snow, and well-nigh frozen to death. Moreover,  while it is true that many of the inns along the turnpike were clean and  furnished excellent fare, there were others that could boast nothing  better than chilly rooms, damp beds, and only a very limited  hospitality.\"    \"I believe you are a realist, Henry,\" said his wife playfully.    Her husband laughed.    \"Nor must we lose sight of the time consumed by making a trip by coach,\"  he went on. \"Business in those days was not such a rushing matter as it  is now, of course; yet even when issues of importance were at stake, or  crises of life and death were to be met, there was no hurrying things  beyond a certain point. Physical impossibility prohibited it. Horses  driven at their liveliest pace could cover only a comparatively small  number of miles an hour; and at the points where the relays were  changed, or the horses fed and rested; the mails deposited or taken  aboard; and passengers left or picked up, there were unavoidable delays.  In fact, the strongest argument against the stagecoach, and the one that  influenced public opinion the most, was this so-called fast-mail  service; for in order to make connections with other mail coaches along  the route and not forfeit the money paid for doing so, horses were often  driven at such a merciless rate of speed that the poor creatures became  total wrecks within a very short time. Many a horse fell in its tracks  in the inn yards, having been lashed along to make the necessary ten  miles an hour and reach a specified town on schedule. Other horses were  maimed for life. It is tragic to consider that in England before the  advent of the railroad about thirty thousand horses were annually either  killed outright or injured so badly that they were of little use  afterward.\"    \"Great Scott, Dad!\" ejaculated Stephen.    \"And England was no more guilty in this respect than was America, for in  the early days of our own country when people were demanding quicker  transportation and swifter mail service thousands of noble beasts  offered up their last breath in making the required rate of speed.\"    \"I suppose nobody thought about the horses,\" murmured the boy. \"I am  sure I didn't.\"    \"If the public thought at all it was too selfish to care, I am afraid,  until threatened by the possibility of the total extermination of these  creatures,\" was his father's reply. \"This danger, blended with a humane  impulse which rose from the gentler-minded portion of the populace, was  the decisive factor in urging men to seek out some other method of  travel. Then, too, the world was waking up commercially and it was  becoming imperative to find better ways for transporting the ever  increasing supplies of merchandise. The quick moving of troops from one  point to another was also an issue. Although the canals of England  enabled the government to carry quite a large body of men, the method  was a slow one. In 1806, for instance, it took exactly a week to shift  troops from Liverpool to London, a distance of thirty-four miles.\"    \"Why, they could have marched it in less time than that, couldn't they?\"  questioned Doris derisively.    \"Yes, the journey might easily have been made on foot in two days,\"  nodded her father. \"But in war time a long march which exhausts the  soldiers is frequently an unwise policy, for the men are in no condition  when they arrive to go into immediate action, as reenforcements often  must.\"    \"I see,\" answered Doris.    \"When the Liverpool and Manchester Railroad was opened in 1830 this  thirty-four miles was covered in two hours,\" continued Mr. Tolman. \"Of  course the quick transportation of troops was then, as now, of very  vital importance. We have had plenty of illustrations of that in our  recent war against Germany. Frequently the fate of a battle has hung on  large reenforcements being speedily dispatched to a weak point in the  line. Moreover, by means of the railroads, vast quantities of food,  ammunition and supplies of all sorts can constantly be sent forward to  the men in action. During the late war our American engineers laid miles  and miles of track under fire, thereby keeping open the route to the  front so that there was no danger of the fighters being cut off and left  unequipped. It was a service for which they, as well as our nation, won  the highest praise. And not only was there a constant flow of supplies  but it was by means of these railroads that hospital trains were enabled  to carry to dressing stations far behind the lines thousands of wounded  men whose lives might otherwise have been lost.\"    \"I suppose the slightly wounded could be made more comfortable in this  way, too,\" Mrs. Tolman suggested.    \"Yes, indeed,\" was the reply. \"Not only were the men better cared for in  the roomier hospitals behind the lines, but as there was more space  there the peril from contagion, always a menace when large numbers of  sick are packed closely together, was greatly lessened; for there is  nothing army doctors dread so much as an epidemic of disease when there  is not enough room to isolate the patients.\"    \"When did England adopt railroads in place of stagecoaches, Dad?\" asked  Doris presently.    At the question her father laughed.    \"See here!\" he protested good-humoredly, \"what do you think I am? Just  because I happen to be a superintendent do you think me a volume of  railroad history, young woman? The topic, I confess, is a fascinating  one; but I am off for a vacation to-day.\"    \"Oh, tell us, Dad, do!\" urged the girl.    \"Nonsense! What is the use of spoiling a fine morning like this talking  business?\" objected her father.    \"But it is not business to us,\" interrupted Mrs. Tolman. \"It is simple a  story--a sort of fairy tale.\"    \"It is not unlike a fairy tale, that's a fact,\" reflected her husband  gravely. \"Imagine yourself back, then, in 1700, before steam power was  in use in England. Now you must not suppose that steam had never been  heard of, for an ancient Alexandrian record dated 120 B. C. describes a  steam turbine, steam fountain, and steam boiler; nevertheless, Hero, the  historian who tells us of them, leaves us in doubt as to whether these  wonders were actually worked out, or if they were, whether they were  anything but miniature models. Still the fact that they are mentioned  goes to prove that there were persons in the world who at a very early  date vaguely realized the possibilities of steam as a force, whether  turned to practical uses or not. For years the subject remained an  alluring one which led many a scientist into experiments without number.  In various parts of the world men played with the idea and wrote about  it; but no one actually produced any practical steam contrivance until  1650, when the second Marquis of Worcester constructed a steam fountain  that could force the water from the moat around his castle as high as  the top of one of the towers. The feat was looked upon as a marvel and  afterward a larger fountain, similar in principle, was constructed at  Vauxhall and from that time on the future of steam as a motive power was  assured.\"    \"Did the Marquis of Worcester go on with his experiments and make other  things?\" demanded Stephen.    \"Apparently not,\" replied his father. \"He did, nevertheless, furnish a  basis for others to work on. Scientists were encouraged to investigate  with redoubled zeal this strange vapor which, when controlled and  directed, could carry water to the top of a castle tower. When in 1698  Savery turned Worcester's crude steam fountain to draining mines and  carrying a water supply, every vestige of doubt that this mighty power  could be applied to practical uses vanished.\"    \"Did the steam engine come soon afterward?\" queried Doris, who had  become interested in the story.    \"No, not immediately,\" answered Mr. Tolman, pausing to shift the gear of  the car. \"Before the steam engine, as we know it, saw the light, there  had to be more experimenting and improving of the steam fountain. It was  not until 1705 that Thomas Newcomen and his partner, John Calley,  invented and patented the first real steam engine. Of course it was not  in the least like the engines we use now. Still, it was a steam device  with moving parts which would pump water, a tremendous advance over the  mechanisms of the past where all the power had been secured by the  alternate filling and emptying of a vacuum, or vacant receptacle,  attached to the pump.
