Some of  these guns of about .44 cal. are exceedingly accurate and reliable  performers.    In one case this small bore shotgun has been combined with a rifle, and  the light weight and portability of this little arm makes it about the  last word in guns for collecting all small specimens.    [Illustration: MARBLE'S SHOT GUN AND RIFLE COMBINED.]    It as well as other single guns of the same bore, is built to use a  round ball in the shot barrel, making them capable of stopping deer or  bear at short ranges. However, choosing a gun is like choosing a wife,  every one has their own tastes.    I would advise the would-be collector to load his own shotgun shells, at  least those for small birds and animals, as it is almost impossible to  get factory loaded shells but what are charged too heavily.    For the collection of animals for taxidermic purposes the use of traps  will probably yield some of the best as well as the more rare and  unusual varieties. Such styles of traps as least injure the appearance  of the finished specimen are preferred.    The old-fashioned snare, dead-fall and box trap are as good as any in  this respect. The wire spring or choke traps of Stop Thief style are  ahead of the common steel trap in this respect, but like the homemade  traps cannot be used in so many various situations.    [Illustration: THE \"STOP THIEF\" OR CHOKE TRAP.]    Water animals taken in steel traps may usually be quickly drowned. If  set on land they should be tended often to prevent suffering and usually  mutilation of the trapped game. Full information on this subject will be  found in Science of Trapping and other books on special animals by same  publisher.    The naturalist uses more small traps than large ones in most cases;  many, many more specimens being taken in No. 1's than in bear traps.  Several styles of mouse and rat traps are useful in collecting the  smaller mammals, such as mice, rats and ground squirrels of various  species.    Fish are to be collected any way you can get 'em, (legally at least).  Many varieties of these are to be bought at the large markets and many  rare and hideous specimens are discarded by market fishermen when  culling their catches. A few years ago before much restriction was  imposed on the sale of game it was possible to purchase many desirable  things at the markets of Washington, D. C. Not only bear and deer, but  elk, ptarmigan, arctic hares, sage and prairie grouse, fox squirrels,  pileated woodpeckers and many other odds and ends were offered for sale  as well as all the usual land and water game.    However you take your specimens or how badly damaged they may be when  they reach your hands it behooves you to see that no further damage  befalls them.    Specimens when shot should have all possible blood and dirt brushed or  washed from feathers or fur and all shot holes, as well as mouth and  nostrils plugged with a wisp of cotton to prevent further soiling. An  awl, or piece of wire will be useful for this. Blood should be removed  from white fur or feathers as soon as possible or it will be stained  more or less. Small birds should be dropped head first into a paper  cone, and laid in a basket or box if possible, the common hunting coat  pocket is apt to break delicate feathers, though if the bird is well  wrapped it may do.    Fur bearers will stand more rough usage and may be tied together by  heads or feet or packed in game bag or pocket. Fish should be wrapped in  paper to protect the scales.    It goes without saying that specimens which it is planned to preserve  should be kept cool if possible until work can be started on them. Some  varieties spoil more quickly than others; fish eating birds need quick  attention; most birds of the hawk and owl family keep well, as do the  pheasants, grouse, etc. Frozen animals keep perfectly in that state but  spoil quickly after thawing.    Keep away from blow flies. Specimens are often sent to the taxidermists  in apparent good order and when received are entirely ruined by fly  maggots; the eggs being deposited before packing and shipping.          CHAPTER VI.    SKINNING AND PRESERVING SKINS.      With a suitable specimen at hand it is for us to decide if we shall  mount it or preserve it as a skin temporarily or indefinitely. To  illustrate we will presume that we have a muskrat just from the trap  which is to be mounted at once.    Before skinning it is best to get some measurements to guide us in the  later work. In this case where the skin is to be mounted immediately a  simple outline is sufficient, as we will have the body in the flesh and  all the leg bones, etc., to guide us in rebuilding the creature.    To get such outline, lay the animal on its side on a piece of blank  paper, put the feet and legs in some natural position, fasten them in  place with a few pins and mark around the entire animal with a pencil.  The eye, hip and shoulder joints, and base of skull may be indicated on  this outline sheet. Our muskrat is a trapped and drowned one so we will  not have to replace the shot hole plugs with fresh ones, as would be  best if it had been killed with the gun. Also it has been dead long  enough for the rigor mortis to prevent the free flow of blood and body  juices which bother the operator if it has been killed but an hour or  less.    [Illustration: OUTLINE OF MUSKRAT. HIP AND SHOULDER JOINTS MARKED]    Laying the animal on its back, make the opening cut by pushing the knife  point through the skin at the juncture of neck and chest. Run the blade  down between skin and flesh, separating the skin in a long clean cut to  the root of the tail. Open the tail also along the under side from the  tip to within an inch or so of its base. Slit open the sole of each foot  from the middle toe to the heel and further if necessary so the leg skin  may be turned down over the foot.    Beginning at this central cut, skin back each side until the shoulder  and hip joints are encountered. Bending the limb will show the exact  joint where the muscles are cut apart and the legs severed from the  body. Cut off the tail near its base, leaving it in the skin for the  present. Loosen the skin from back and shoulders and turn it wrong side  out over the head. Skin down until the ears are reached, cutting them  off close down to the head and continue on to the eyes. Work carefully  around these and cut close to the skull to avoid hacking the eyelids.  Cut through the nose cartilage, and when the lips are reached cut them  away close to the gums, leaving both their inner and outer skin on the  pelt. Cutting them off at the edge of the hair is a frequent cause of  trouble as they are full and fleshy and should be split, pared down on  the inside and when mounted, filled out to their natural shape to  perfect the anatomy.    [Illustration: SKINNING SMALL ANIMAL FOR MOUNTING. CUT ON DOTTED LINES.]    Now the skin of each leg may be turned wrong side out down to the toes  and all flesh and muscle cut away from the leg bones with knife and  scissors. The tail also is to be removed from its skin and the ears  turned wrong side out to their tips. In skinning no flesh of any  consequence should be left adhering to the skin and it should never be  pulled off by main strength, but rather separated by the knife or  fingers, pushing the flesh away from the skin rather than the reverse.  The skull should now be cleaned as the leg bones were and if a number of  specimens are being prepared at the same time the heads may be put in a  kettle and boiled a short time, when on trying with a fork or awl the  flesh becomes tender and may be rapidly removed with a knife.    The brain may be removed with a hooked wire, the skull well rinsed  inside and out and given a good coat of arsenical paste or other  preservative. The next step is determined by what you intend doing with  the skin. If it is to be kept for purposes of study without mounting it  should be made up as a scientific skin. If to be mounted at once or in  the near future it should be put in the jar of salt and acid or alum. It  can of course be mounted at once without this bath but I believe it is  well worth any extra work it entails.    Some young furred animals and others with very delicate skins do not  work up well from the bath and had best be mounted without it, being  handled more as bird skins are.    In skinning the larger quadrupeds we make two additional cuts, from the  right to the central line and out to the left fore foot and a similar  cut connecting the hind feet. These opening cuts are on the back and  inside of the legs, you will understand.    With most large subjects another cut from the shoulders up the back of  the neck is necessary. On animals having horns or antlers this is  terminated in a Y or T shape, reaching the base of the antlers. After  loosening the skin around the antlers the head is removed through this  incision. As it is hardly possible to make an outline sketch of a large  animal, as full a set of measurements as possible is useful in all  cases.    [Illustration: SKINNING LARGE ANIMAL FOR MOUNTING. CUT ON DOTTED LINES.]    The bones of the legs will be in the way attached to the skin and the  two upper bones of each leg may be detached and if lack of space or  transportation make it necessary, thrown away, though if the bones of  one hind leg and one front leg are preserved artificial duplicates may  be carved.    [Illustration: SKINNING BIRD-BREAST CUT.]    In skinning birds, after fresh cotton plugs have been put in place the  feathers are parted and the opening incision made through the skin only  from the middle of the breast to the root of the tail. Separate the skin  and flesh on each side until the knee is reached, push this up until the  knife or scissors can be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23280"],[0,"The Shirley Letters from California Mines in 1851-52 (#6)"],[1,"in the ministrations of good. Then this dependable friend,  Dr. Ewer, was discovered, with the result that he was called to a  church in New York at a salary of ten thousand dollars a year.    In addition to her daily teaching, Shirley, by request, established  evening classes in art and literature, for men and women, and once a  week she held her _salon_, drawing the best minds about her. She  appreciated the privilege of having a home in Mr. John Swett's family,  because of its intellectual atmosphere. Here scholarly notabilities  from near and far were entertained, among them Emerson, Agassiz, and  Julia Ward Howe.    Childless, Shirley took her niece, Genevieve Stebbins, and reared her  from babyhood to a splendid womanhood. She contributed freely to  entertainments for charity, by her Shakespearean readings and other  recitations, and happily prepared whole parties for private  theatricals. With such mental strain, she kept herself fit by Saturday  outings, in which were graciously included some of her pupils. At times  we went across the bay, in various directions, but oftenest we strove  through the sand to the ocean beach, stopping here and there to  botanize, and gather the sweet yellow and purple lupin, and to rest on  the limbs of the scrub-oaks. On the beach we roasted potatoes and made  coffee, and then ate ravenously. A happy gipsying it was, and she, the  queen, forgot her cares. Not a pebble at our feet, nor a floating  seaweed, nor a shell, nor a seal on the rock, but opened up an  instructive talk from our teacher, or started Charley Stoddard reciting  a poem, or set a girl singing. Before starting homeward, the whole  party, including Shirley, shoes and stockings off, waded into the surf,  and afterwards rested on the warm beds of sand. A fine comradeship,  that, and one that never died.    Shirley, I should also mention, wrote some respectable poetry. I have  fondly preserved, treasured, and cherished the original manuscript of a  poem written by her at the time Margaret Fuller Ossoli was lost by  shipwreck in 1850. This poem was included in my collection of  California poetry, but was not printed in Outcroppings. I append it to  this paper, of which it can hardly be considered an essential part.    I married and went to the mines, and our home was on the Mariposa  Grant. We lived on a bed of gold. Once, upon a visit to the city, I  found Shirley nervous and worn. Her vacation was about to begin. She  went home with me, and stayed in bed the first three days. Then she was  daily swung in a hammock under an oak. Soon we had horseback-rides, and  up the creek she again panned out gold. Later we set out in the  stage-coach for the hotel at the big Mariposa Grove. Mr. Lawrence put  us in charge of Mr. Galen Clark, a rare scholar, and the guardian of  the Big Tree Grove and of the Yosemite Valley. This charming man was  much interested in Shirley. From the hotel we took daily rides with him  through the great forest, and then made the twenty-five-mile  horseback-ride and found Mr. James M. Hutchings, of the Illustrated  California Magazine, awaiting us at the entrance to the valley. He  escorted us to his picturesque hotel, where he and his interesting wife  made our three weeks' stay most delightful. Down in the meadows we came  upon John Muir sawing logs. He dropped his work, and we three went  botanizing, and soon were learning all about the valley's formation as  he entrancingly talked. We met many tourists of distinction, and  Shirley forgot that she ever had a care, and on our way back she  galloped along recklessly.    At our home in Mariposa we invited friends to come and enjoy Shirley's  Shakespearean readings, chiefly comedy. In these Mr. Lawrence had a  happy part.    In time Shirley went to New York, to her niece, Genevieve Stebbins, who  was successful in a delightful line of art-work. Before leaving San  Francisco, her faithful pupils and other friends gave a musicale and  realized about two thousand dollars, which was presented her as a  loving gift. In the great metropolis her genius was recognized soon  after her arrival, and she was importuned to give lectures on art and  literature. The Field family, who delightedly discovered her, took her  to Europe, where she visited all the art-galleries, a treat that had  been a lifelong heart's desire. In New York she had at once made her  home with Dr. Ewer's widow and children, but, in the end, she went to  Morristown, New Jersey, where, it was said, she again happily met and  renewed her friendship with Bret Harte's accomplished and delightful  wife and her attractive children, while Bret Harte himself was  sojourning in Europe, a successful author. Mrs. John F. Swift, her  long-time appreciative friend, Charley Stoddard, myself, and others,  contributed to her pleasure by letters till the close of her perfect  life at Morristown, New Jersey, on February 9, 1906. No other woman has  left a more lasting impress on the California community. But back to  Rich Bar! Back to the gold-fields!

The starry crown of genius could not save          From woman's gift of grief;      The moaning billows o'er thy breast that have          Emblem thy life too brief.        O Margaret! my weak heart-pulses shiver          In wordless woe for thee,      Thy wasted tenderness, thy love that never          Might its fruition see.        Thou hadst no youth, O wondrous child! no youth          Haloed thy later life;      Sternly thy girl heart sought its solemn truth          In battle and in strife.        In thine own Northern home didst thou not live          \"Alone,\" always \"alone\"?      What heart to thine uplifted heart could give          Ever an answering tone?        In suffering, labor, strife, we saw thee stand          With lips that would not moan,      While shone thy regal brow and eyes with grand          Aspirings all thine own.        At last among thy Romans thou didst find          A shrine for that large heart;      It understood thee not, the Northern mind,          But coldly shrunk apart,        When those pale lips--from whence, an hour agone,          Flew out, like rifted light,      Winged words of wit--murmured their wailed \"Alone\"          To the pitying midnight.        And I have read thy life, its mournful story          Of loneliness and blight;      But o'er its close there shines a solemn glory,          A setting star's trailed light.        Margaret! white-robed, thy hair unbound, thy veil,          Most like a bride wert thou      When Ocean clasped thee, and, with lips all pale          And icy, kissed thy brow.        And lovely as a white unfolded blossom          Lay the child Angelo,      Hushed to his dreamless flower-sleep on that bosom          Which would not let him go.
