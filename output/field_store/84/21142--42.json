[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21840"],[0,"Woman (#6)"],[1," bent or flexed backward upon itself  the condition is called _retroflexion_. An extreme degree of  anteversion or anteflexion, or retroversion or retroflexion, may  interfere with impregnation, as the spermatozoa may find it  difficult or impossible to reach the opening of the womb--the external  os.        [Illustration: (Female Reproductive Organs)]    The entire cavity of the uterus is lined by a mucous membrane;[1] this  mucous membrane is called the endometrium (endo--within;  metra--uterus). An inflammation of the endometrium is called  _endometritis_. It is the endometrium that is principally concerned in  menstruation--that is, it is from it that the monthly discharge of  blood comes.    =The Vagina= [vagina in Latin--a sheath]. The vagina is the tube or  canal which serves as a passage-way between the uterus and the outside  of the body. It extends from the external genitals or vulva to the  neck of the womb, embracing the latter for some distance. It is a  strong, fibromuscular canal, lined with mucous membrane. It is not  smooth inside, but arranged in folds, or _rugae_, so that when  necessary, as during childbirth, it can stretch enormously and permit  the passage of a child's head. The length of the vaginal canal is  between three and five inches, but it is in general much more  capacious in women that have borne one or more children than in those  who have not borne any.    Near the vaginal entrance are situated two small glands; they are  about the size of a pea, and secrete mucus. They are called  Bartholin's glands; occasionally they become inflamed and give a good  deal of trouble.        [Illustration: ANTEVERSION OF THE UTERUS.]        [Illustration: ANTEFLEXION OF THE UTERUS.]        [Illustration: RETROVERSION OF THE UTERUS.]        [Illustration: RETROFLEXION OF THE UTERUS.]    =The Hymen= [hymen in Greek--a membrane]. The external opening of the  vagina, in virgins, that is, in girls or women who have not had sexual  intercourse, is almost entirely closed by a membrane called the hymen.  The vulgar name for hymen is \"maidenhead.\" The hymen may be of various  shapes, and of different consistency. In some girls it is a very thin  membrane, which tears very readily; in others it is quite tough. On  the upper margin or in the center of the hymen there is an opening  which permits any secretion from the vagina and the blood from the  uterus to come through. In rare cases there is no opening in the  hymen, that is, the vagina is entirely closed. Such a hymen is called  _imperforate_ (not perforated). When the girl begins to menstruate,  the blood cannot come out and it accumulates in the vagina. In such  cases the hymen must be opened or slit by a doctor. In some cases the  hymen is congenitally absent; that is, the girl is born without any  hymen. While the hymen is usually ruptured during the first  intercourse, it, in some cases, being elastic and stretchable,  persists untorn after sexual intercourse. It will therefore be seen  that just as the presence of the hymen is no absolute proof of  virginity, so is the absence of the hymen no absolute proof that the  girl has had sexual relations, She might have been born without any  hymen, or it might have been ruptured by vaginal examination, by a  vaginal douche, by scratching to relieve itching, or by some accident.    The remains of the hymen after it is ruptured shrink and form little  elevations which can be easily felt; they are known as caruncles.  [In Latin, _carunculae myrtiformes_, which means in English  myrtleberry-shaped caruncles; caruncle is a small fleshy elevation;  derived from _caro_, which in Latin means flesh.]      SUBCHAPTER B    THE EXTERNAL GENITALS    =The Vulva.= The external genitals of the female are called the  _vulva_. The vulva consists of the labia majora (meaning the larger  lips), which are on the outside and which in the grown-up girl are  covered with hair, and the labia minora (the smaller lips), which are  on the inside and which are usually only seen when the labia majora  are taken apart.    [Vulva in Latin means folding-door. The ancients Were fond of giving  fancy names to things.]    =The Mons Veneris.= The elevation above the vulva, which during  puberty becomes covered with hair, is called by the fanciful name,  _mons Veneris_, or Venus' mountain. It is usually well padded with  fatty tissue.    =The Clitoris.= The clitoris is a small body about an inch in length,  situated beneath the mons Veneris and partly or entirely covered by  the upper borders of the labia minora.    =The Urethra.= Between the clitoris above and the opening of the  vagina below is situated the opening of the _urethra_, or the urinary  meatus, through which the urine passes. Many women are so ignorant,  or, let us say innocent, that they think the urine passes out through  the vagina. This is not so. The vagina has nothing to do with the  process of urination.    Again enumerating the female sex organs, but in the reverse order,  from before backward, or from out inward, we have: The mons Veneris  and the labia majora, or the external lips of the vulva; these are the  plainly visible parts of the female genital organs. When the labia  majora are taken apart we see the labia minora; when the labia majora  and minora are taken apart we can see or feel the clitoris and the  hymen, or the remains of the hymen. We then have the vagina, a large,  stretchable musculo-membranous canal, in the upper portion of which  the neck of the womb, or the cervix, can be seen (when a speculum is  used), or felt by the finger. Only the cervix, or neck of the womb,  can be seen, but the rest of the womb, the broader portion, can be  easily felt and examined by one hand in the vagina and the other hand  over the abdomen. Continuous with the uterus are the Fallopian tubes,  and below the trumpet-shaped ends of the Fallopian tubes are the  ovaries, embedded in the broad ligaments, one on each side.    =The Breasts.= The breasts, also called mammary glands, or mammae  [mamma in Latin, breast], may be considered as accessory organs of  reproduction. They are of no importance in the male, in whom they are  usually rudimentary, but they are of great importance in the female.  They manufacture milk, which is necessary for the proper nutrition of  the infant, and they add a great deal to the beauty and attractiveness  of the woman. They are thus a help to the woman in getting a mate or a  husband. The projecting elevation of the breast, which the child takes  in his mouth when nursing, is called the nipple; the darker colored  area surrounding the nipple is called the areola.        [Illustration: THE PELVIS OF THE MALE.]        [Illustration: THE PELVIS OF THE FEMALE.]      SUBCHAPTER C    THE PELVIS    The internal sex organs are situated in the lower part of the  abdominal cavity, the part that is called the _pelvis_, or pelvic  cavity. The meaning of the word pelvis in Latin is basin. The pelvis,  also referred to as the pelvic girdle or pelvic arch, forms a bony  basin, and is composed of three powerful bones: the sacrum, consisting  of five vertebrae fused together and constituting the solid part of the  spine, or vertebral column, in the back, and the two hipbones, one on  each side. The two hipbones meet in front, forming the _pubic arch_.    The hipbones are called in Latin the ossa innominata (nameless bones)  and each hipbone is composed of three bones: the ilium, the ischium,  and the os pubis. The thighs are attached to the hipbones, and to the  hipbones are also attached the large _gluteal_ muscles, which form the  buttocks, or the \"seat.\"    The pelvis of the female differs considerably from the pelvis of the  male. The female pelvis is shallower and wider, less massive, the  margins of the bones are more widely separated, thus giving greater  prominence to the hips; the sacrum is shorter and less curved, and the  pubic arch is wider and more rounded. All this is necessary in order  to permit the child's head to pass through. If the female pelvis were  exactly like the male pelvis, a full-term living child could never  pass through it. The two illustrations show the differences between  the male and female pelvis very clearly.    Note particularly the differences in the pubic arches: in the male  pelvis it is really more of an angle than an arch. Also note how much  longer and more solid the sacrum (with its attached bone, called the  coccyx[2]) is in the male pelvis. The differences in the pelves (the  plural of pelvis is pelves) of the male and female become fully marked  at puberty, but they are present as early as the fourth month of  intra-uterine life.    FOOTNOTES:    [1] Mucous membrane--briefly a membrane which secretes mucus or some  other fluid.    [2] The coccyx consists of three rudimentary vertebrae; it is the  vestige of an organ which we once possessed in common with many other  animals, namely--a tail.

The importance of an organ depends upon its _function_, upon what it  does, and not so much upon what it is. It is important to know the  size, structure and location of an organ, but it is still more  important to know its function; in other words, for our purpose it is  more important to know the _physiology_ than the anatomy of the sex  organs.

Ponscarme, his pupil, now professor in the  Ecole des Beaux-Arts, the _maquettes_, or lead proofs, of many of  Dupre's works. A few days later, M. Ponscarme showed me a _maquette_  of the obverse of the Diplomatic medal, and at last M. Narcisse Dupre  sent me a photograph of the reverse. I thus obtained proof of the  correctness of the engraved plate.                       [Footnote 16: Among his most noted works is the                     bronze statue of the Emperor Napoleon I., placed by                     Napoleon III. on the column in the Place Vendome,                     Paris, which was overthrown by the Communists. The                     statue has since been replaced on the reconstructed                     column. M. Dumont, who is a professor in the Ecole                     des Beaux-Arts, is a member of the Institute,                     Commander of the Legion of Honor, etc.]    While in Washington, in February, 1872, I was fortunate enough to  find, in the office of Rear-Admiral Joseph Smith, then chief of the  Bureau of Yards and Docks, in the Navy Department, where they were  used as paperweights, the original dies of the medal voted to  Commodore Edward Preble for his naval operations against Tripoli. I  immediately brought this to the notice of the chief clerks of     (p. xxxi)  the Navy and of the Treasury Departments, and also to that of Captain  (now Rear-Admiral) George H. Preble, a connection of the commodore's,  and these dies are now where they belong, in the Mint in Philadelphia.  Shortly afterward I was also instrumental in having restored to the  mint the dies of the Vanderbilt medal, which were lying in the cellar  of one of the New York city banks.    I have found it impossible to obtain any trustworthy information  respecting the designer and the engraver of the medal, voted on March  29, 1800, in honor of Captain Thomas Truxtun. As there were no  competent medallists in the United States at the period, and as we  were then at war with France, it is presumable that the dies were made  in England. If so, they were probably cut at the private mint of  Matthew Boulton, of Birmingham, who furnished the United States  Government for a long time with planchets for its copper coinage.    The work now offered to the public consists of two volumes: Volume I.,  Text; Volume II., Plates.    The text is subdivided into eighty-six sections, corresponding to the  number of the medals, in each of which is included, besides the  descriptive matter, all the documents that could be obtained relating  to the respective piece, and arranged according to the following plan:    1. The number of the medal, its date, and its number in the book of  plates. The medals are arranged chronologically: those voted by  Congress according to the dates of the several resolutions or acts  awarding them, and not in the order of the events which they  commemorate; the unofficial ones in the order of events which they  commemorate; and the presidential pieces according to the date   (p. xxxii)  of inauguration of each President.    2. The descriptive titles of each medal, in the following order: 1st,  the legends of the obverse and of the reverse; 2d, the name of the  person honored, or of the title by which the piece is known; 3d, the  event commemorated.    3. A description of the medal, beginning with the obverse: 1st, the  whole legend; 2d, the description of the emblems and devices; 3d, the  legend of the exergue; 4th, the names of the designer and of the  engraver. The same order has been followed for the reverse. The  legends are copied exactly from the medals, and when in Latin,  translated; the abbreviations are explained, and are, like the  translations, placed between parentheses. The words, \"facing the  right\" and \"facing the left\" mean the right or the left of the person  looking at the piece.    4. A short biographical sketch of the designers and of the engravers.    5. A short biographical sketch of the person in whose honor the medal  was struck, or of the President of the United States, in case of the  Indian peace tokens.    6. Original documents, such as Resolutions or Acts of Congress, the  official reports of the events commemorated, and letters of interest.    The original documents have been given in the belief that the reader  would prefer them to a mere recital of the events of which they treat.  Many of these are now printed for the first time.    It is interesting to note that Mr. Jefferson, as early as 1789,  entertained the idea of publishing an account of all the        (p. xxxiii)  American medals struck up to that time, as will be seen from the  following letter;         To         M. DUPRE,            Engraver of Medals, Paris.         Mr. Jefferson is going to have a description of all the medals       printed, in order to send them, with copies of the medals, to the       sovereigns of Europe. The one of Mr. Franklin, made by M. Dupre,       is wanting; he begs you to lend him a copy, and to communicate to       him the description also, if any has been made, as is probable.         February 23, 1789[17].                       [Footnote 17: The original of this letter, which is                     in French, and which was communicated to me in                     Paris by M. Narcisse Dupre, is undoubtedly in the                     handwriting of Mr. Jefferson. I have sought in vain                     for the document mentioned in it. See I, page 1.]    No mention is made of the size of the medals, as the plates show their  exact dimensions.    Being desirous that the execution of the engravings should be as  perfect as possible, I invited M. Jules Jacquemart, of Paris, to  undertake the whole of them. M. Jacquemart needs no praise. All  amateurs know his etchings from Van der Meer, Franz Hals, Rembrandt,  etc., and his plates for the \"History of Porcelain,\" by M. Albert  Jacquemart, his father, for the \"Gems and Jewels of the Crown,\"  published by M. Barbet de Jouy, and for the \"Collection of Arms\" of  Count de Nieuwerkerke. The American public has had, moreover, an  opportunity of admiring the works of this eminent artist at the  Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York city. His collaboration adds  great value to the artistic portion of this work.          ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS                                               (p. xxxiv)    REFERRED TO IN THE INTRODUCTION.    A                                              Mount Vernon, November, 1787.       To         THE PRINTER OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM (Mr. CAREY.)         Sir: I understand that a part, if not all, of the medals which,       in the course of the late war, were voted by Congress to officers       of distinguished merit, and for the execution of which I       contracted with artists at Paris, have lately arrived in America.       But, not having seen any account published of the devices and       inscriptions, I presume it will not be ungrateful to the public       to receive some authentic information respecting these memorials       of national glory. However superfluous the publication of the       correspondence[18] on this subject with the Perpetual Secretary       of the Royal Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres might be       deemed, it will not, I conceive, be improper it should be known       that this learned society, to whom a reference was made, entered       on the discussion with the same alacrity as if the subject had       been designed to illustrate the actions of their compatriots, or       to immortalize some glorious events in the annals of their own       nation. You will be at liberty to insert in your _Museum_ the       result of their deliberations.         In our free republics certainly nothing should be suppressed that       can tend to awaken a noble spirit of emulation, to cherish the       fine feelings of patriotism, to exhibit alluring examples for       imitation, or to extend and perpetuate the remembrance of those       heroic achievements which have ennobled the era of the American       Revolution. Few inventions could be more happily calculated to       diffuse the knowledge and preserve the memory of illustrious       characters and splendid events than medals--whether we take into       consideration the imperishable nature of the substance whence       they are formed, the facility of multiplying copies, or the       practice of depositing them in the cabinets of the curious.       Perhaps one improvement might be made. The sage and venerable Dr.       Franklin, whose patriotic genius is active in old age, and ever       prolific in projects of public utility, once suggested,[19] in       conversation with me, as an expedient for propagating still more       extensively the knowledge of facts designed to be perpetuated in       medals, that their devices should be impressed on the current       coin of the nation.         Under influence of such ideas, I shall claim the indulgence  (p. xxxv)       of my countrymen for bringing forward a communication which might       possibly have come more satisfactorily from some other quarter.       An apprehension that the subject might remain unnoticed is my       apology.         I am, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,                                               David HUMPHREYS.
