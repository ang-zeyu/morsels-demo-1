The space between the valve and its seat is made as shallow as possible,  so that the space may be quickly filled and exhausted. The piston may be  adjusted to regulate this space. This invention was recently patented by  Messrs. Samuel B. Connor and Henry Dods, of Virginia City, Nevada.           *       *       *       *       *          IMPROVED SAFETY VALVE.      In the annexed cut we have represented a steam safety valve, which is  the invention of M. Schmidt, M. E., of Zurich, Switzerland. It consists  of a lever terminating in two prongs, one of which extends downward and  rests upon the cap, closing the top of the tube through which the steam  escapes. The other prong extends upward and catches under a projection  of the steam tube, and forms the fulcrum for the lever. The opposite end  of this lever is provided with an adjustable screw pressing upon a plate  that rests on the top of a spiral spring, which keeps the valve closed  by pressing the outer end of the lever upward. As soon as the pressure  of the steam overcomes the pressure of the spiral spring the valve will  be raised, permitting the steam to escape. The apparatus is contained in  a case having a central aperture for the escape of steam.    [Illustration: IMPROVED SAFETY VALVE.]           *       *       *       *       *          RAISING SUNKEN VESSELS.      An experiment recently took place in the East India Dock Basin,  Blackwall, London, by permission of Mr. J. L. du Plat Taylor, the  secretary of the Dock Company, for the purpose of testing and  illustrating the mode of raising sunken ships by means of the apparatus  patented by Mr. William Atkinson, naval engineer, of Sheffield. The  machinery employed consists of the necessary number and size, according  to the power required, of oval or egg-shaped buoys constructed of sheet  iron, having an internal valve of a simple and effective character.  Captain Hales Dutton, the dock master, who assisted during the  operations, had placed his small yacht at the inventor's service for the  occasion. The vessel was moored in the basin, and a set of four buoys  were attached to it, one on each side near the bow and the stern. Air  was supplied from a pump on the quay by a pipe communicating with a  small copper globe resting on the deck of the vessel, and from which  place proceeded four other flexible tubes, one to each buoy, thus  distributing the air to each one equally. The vessel being flooded and  in a sinking condition, the buoys were attached and the valves opened;  they rapidly filled with water, and the vessel immediately sank in about  30 feet. Upon the first attempt an air chamber in the stern had been  lost sight of, causing the vessel to come up to the surface stern  uppermost; this being rectified, the vessel was again sent to the  bottom, and allowed to remain a short time to allow her to settle down.  When the order was given to work the pump, the vessel was brought to the  surface, perfectly level, in about three minutes. The apparatus used,  although only models, and on a comparatively diminutive scale (the buoys  measuring 3 feet 4 inches in height and 2 feet 6 inches in diameter),  was estimated to be capable of lifting a weight of nearly 20 tons, and  that it needed, as represented by the patentee, only a corresponding  increase in the lifting power to deal successfully with vessels of any  tonnage.           *       *       *       *       *          NEW HAND POWER BAND SAW.      The engraving shows a new hand power band saw made by Frank & Co., of  Buffalo, N. Y., and designed to be used in shops where there is no power  and where a larger machine would be useless. It is calculated to meet  the wants of a large class of mechanics, including carpenters and  builders, cabinet makers, and wagon makers. It is capable of sawing  stuff six inches thick, and has a clear space of thirty inches between  the saw and the frame. The upper wheel is adjusted by a screw pressing  against a rubber spring which compensates for the expansion and  contraction of the saw.    The machine has a very complete device for raising, lowering, and  adjusting the wheel, and all of the parts are made with a view to  obtaining the best results in the simplest and most desirable way.    The machine is six feet wide and five feet high, and weighs 380 lb. The  wheels are covered with pure rubber bands well cemented.

Y.           *       *       *       *       *          THE HARBOR OF MONTREAL.      A plan for the improvement of the harbor of Montreal, Canada, has been  submitted to the City Board of Trade by James Shearer, a well known  citizen. Mr. Shearer's plan is to divert the current of the St. Lawrence  opposite the city into the channels between St. Helen's Island and the  southern shore, and by having various obstructions removed from the  channel, and running a dam, or \"peninsula,\" as he calls it, built from  Point St. Charles, in the west end of the city, to St. Helen's Island,  midway in the river, thus stopping the current from running through the  present main channel between the city and St. Helen's Island.    Among the practical advantages that will accrue to the city and harbor  from the carrying out of this project, Mr. Shearer sets forth the  following: The dam will prevent the shoring of ice opposite the city,  and the consequent flooding of the Griffintown district, which is  annually very destructive to property, and will make a still harbor,  where vessels may lie during the winter. It is estimated that the  construction of the dam, which would be 2,700 feet long and 900 feet  broad, would raise the water two feet in the river and lower it ten feet  in the harbor. This would give a head of twenty-five feet for mills,  elevators, and factories, and the transportation of freight. The dam  would afford a roadway across the river, upon the construction of a  bridge from St. Helen's Island to St. Lambert, thus removing the  necessity of a tunnel. The roadway could be utilized for a railway, a  road for carriages and foot passengers. The estimated cost of the  improvement is $7,000,000.           *       *       *       *       *          APPARATUS FOR REMOVING ICE FROM RAILROADS.      The engraving shows an improved apparatus for removing snow and ice from  railroads and streets by means of heat. The invention consists of a  double furnace mounted on wheels, which are incased in the fire boxes of  the furnace, so that in use the entire apparatus, including the wheels,  will become highly heated, so that the snow and ice will not only be  melted by radiant heat, but by the actual contact of the hot surfaces of  the furnace and wheels. This apparatus was recently patented by the late  E. H. Angamar, of New Orleans, La.    [Illustration: APPARATUS FOR REMOVING ICE FROM RAILROADS.]           *       *       *       *       *          ERICSSON'S NEW SUBMARINE GUN.      The protracted trials conducted on board the Destroyer to test its  submarine gun terminated last week. Having, says the _Army and Navy  Journal_, in a previous issue described this novel type of naval  artillery, it will suffice to remind our readers that its caliber is 16  inches, length of bore 30 feet, and that it is placed at the bottom of  the vessel, the muzzle passing through an opening formed in the wrought  iron stem.    We have hitherto, in discussing the properties of the Destroyer,  referred to its offensive weapon as a \"torpedo,\" a term not altogether  inappropriate while it was actuated by compressed air. But Capt.  Ericsson having in the meantime wholly abolished compressed air in his  new system of naval attack, substituting guns and gunpowder as the means  of producing motive energy, it will be proper to adopt the constructor's  term, _projectile_. It will not surprise those who are acquainted with  the laws of hydrostatics and the enormous resistance offered to bodies  moving swiftly through water, that the determination of the proper form  of projectile for the submarine gun has demanded protracted experiments,  commencing at the beginning of June and continued up to last week, as  before stated. The greater portion of these experiments, it should be  observed, has been carried out with a gun 30 feet long, 15 inches  caliber--not a breech-loader, however, as in the Destroyer, but a  muzzle-loader, suspended under the bottom of two wrecking scows, the gun  being lifted above the water, after each shot, by shears and suitable  tackle. The present projectile of the Destroyer is the result of the  extended trials referred to; its length is 25 feet 6 inches, diameter 16  inches, and its weight 1,500 pounds, including 250 pounds of explosive  materials. We are not at liberty at present to describe its form, but we  may mention that the great length of the body and the absence of all  internal machinery enable the constructor to carry the stated enormous  quantity of explosive matter. With minimum charge of powder in the  chamber of the gun, the speed attained by the projectile reaches 310  feet in the first three seconds.    The question may be asked, in view of these facts, whether the boasted  costly steam ram is not superseded by the cheap aggressive system  represented by the Destroyer. Evidently the most powerful of the English  steam rams could not destroy an armored ship as effectually as the  projectile from the submarine gun, the explosion of which is capable of  shattering any naval structure.    It should be borne in mind, also, that being protected by heavy inclined  transverse armor, the Destroyer, attacking bows on, can defy ordnance of  all calibers.

At Liverpool he made his  famous declaration that his political allegiance was buried in Pitt's  grave. At one at least of these performances the youthful William  Gladstone was present, but it was at home that he learned Canningite  doctrine. At Seaforth House Canning spent the days between the death of  Castlereagh and his own recall to power, while he was waiting for the  date fixed for his voyage to take up the viceroyalty of India.                                  CANNING    As from whig John Gladstone turned Canningite, so from presbyterian  also he turned churchman. He paid the penalty of men who change their  party, and was watched with a critical eye by old friends; but he was a  liberal giver for beneficent public purposes, and in 1811 he was  honoured by the freedom of Liverpool. His ambition naturally pointed to  parliament, and he was elected first for Lancaster in 1818, and next for  Woodstock in 1820, two boroughs of extremely easy political virtue.  Lancaster cost him twelve thousand pounds, towards which his friends in  Liverpool contributed one-half. In 1826 he was chosen at Berwick, but  was unseated the year after. His few performances in the House were not  remarkable. He voted with ministers, and on the open question of  catholic emancipation he went with Canning and Plunket. He was one of  the majority who by six carried Plunket's catholic motion in 1821, and  the matter figures in the earliest of the hundreds of surviving letters  from his youngest son, then over eleven, and on the eve of his departure  for Eton:--         _Seaforth, Mar._ 10, 1821.         I address these few lines to you to know how my dear mother is, to       thank you for your kind letter, and to know whether Edward may get       two padlocks for the wicket and large shore gate. They are now       open, and the people make a thoroughfare of the green walk and the       carriage road. I read Mr. Plunket's speech, and I admire it       exceedingly. I enclose a letter from Mr. Rawson to you. He told me       to-day that Mrs. R. was a great deal better. Write to me again as       soon as you can.--Ever your most affectionate and dutiful son, W.       E. GLADSTONE.    In after years he was fond of recalling how the Liverpool with which he  had been most familiar (1810-20), though the second commercial town in  the kingdom, did not exceed 100,000 of population, and how the silver  cloud of smoke that floated above her resembled that which might now  appear over any secondary borough or village of the country. 'I have  seen wild roses growing upon the very ground that is now the centre of  the borough of Bootle. All that land is now partly covered with  residences and partly with places of business and industry; but in my  time but one single house stood upon the space between Primrose brook  and the town of Liverpool.' Among his early recollections was 'the  extraordinarily beautiful spectacle of a dock delivery on the Mersey  after a long prevalence of westerly winds followed by a change.  Liverpool cannot imitate that now [1892], at least not for the eye.'                                       III                       JOHN GLADSTONE AS SLAVEHOLDER    The Gladstone firm was mainly an East India house, but in the last ten  years of his mercantile course John Gladstone became the owner of  extensive plantations of sugar and coffee in the West Indies, some in  Jamaica, others in British Guiana or Demerara. The infamy of the  slave-trade had been abolished in 1807, but slave labour remained, and  the Liverpool merchant, like a host of other men of equal respectability  and higher dignity, including many peers and even some bishops, was a  slaveholder. Everybody who has ever read one of the most honourable and  glorious chapters in our English history knows the case of the  missionary John Smith.[14] In 1823 an outbreak of the slaves occurred in  Demerara, and one of John Gladstone's plantations happened to be its  centre. The rising was stamped out with great cruelty in three days.  Martial law, the savage instrument of race passion, was kept in force  for over five months. Fifty negroes were hanged, many were shot down in  the thickets, others were torn in pieces by the lash of the cart-whip.  Smith was arrested, although he had in fact done his best to stop the  rising. Tried before a court in which every rule of evidence was  tyrannically set aside, he was convicted on hearsay and condemned to  death. Before the atrocious sentence could be commuted by the home  authorities, the fiery heat and noisome vapours of his prison killed  him. The death of the Demerara missionary, it has been truly said, was  an event as fatal to slavery in the West Indies, as the execution of  John Brown was its deathblow in the United States.[15] Brougham in 1824  brought the case before the House of Commons, and in the various  discussions upon it the Gladstone estates made rather a prominent  figure. John Gladstone became involved in a heated and prolonged  controversy as to the management of his plantations; as we shall see, it  did not finally die down till 1841. He was an indomitable man. In a  newspaper discussion through a long series of letters, he did not defend  slavery in the abstract, but protested against the abuse levelled at the  planters by all 'the intemperate, credulous, designing, or interested  individuals who followed the lead of that well-meaning but mistaken man,  Mr. Wilberforce.' He denounced the missionaries as hired emissaries,  whose object seemed to be rather to revolutionise the colonies than to  diffuse religion among the people.    In 1830 he published a pamphlet, in the form of a letter to Sir Robert  Peel,[16] to explain that negroes were happier when forced to work;  that, as their labour was essential to the welfare of the colonies, he  considered the difficulties in the way of emancipation insurmountable;  that it was not for him to seek to destroy a system that an over-ruling  Providence had seen fit to permit in certain climates since the very  formation of society; and finally with a Parthian bolt, he hinted that  the public would do better to look to the condition of the lower classes  at home than to the negroes in the colonies. The pamphlet made its mark,  and was admitted by the abolitionists to be an attempt of unusual  ingenuity to varnish the most heinous of national crimes. Three years  later, when emancipation came, and the twenty million pounds of  compensation were distributed, John Gladstone appears to have received,  individually and apart from his partnerships, a little over seventy-five  thousand pounds for 1609 slaves.[17]    It is as well, though in anticipation of the order of time, to complete  our sketch. In view of the approach of full abolition, John Gladstone  induced Lord Glenelg, the whig secretary of state, to issue an order in  council (1837) permitting the West Indian planters to ship coolies from  India on terms drawn up by the planters themselves. Objections were made  with no effect by the governor at Demerara, a humane and vigorous man,  who had done much work as military engineer under Wellington, and who,  after abolishing the flogging of female slaves in the Bahamas, now set  such an iron yoke upon the planters and their agents in Demerara, that  he said 'he could sleep satisfied that no person in the colony could be  punished without his knowledge and sanction.'[18] The importation of  coolies raised old questions in new forms. The voyage from India was  declared to reproduce the horrors of the middle passage of the vanished  Guinea slavers; the condition of the coolie on the sugar plantations was  drawn in a light only less lurid than the case of the African negro; and  John Gladstone was again in hot water. Thomas Gladstone, his eldest son,  defended him in parliament (Aug. 3, 1839), and commissioners sent to  inquire into the condition of the various Gladstone plantations reported  that the coolies on Vreedestein appeared contented and happy on the  whole; no one had ever maltreated or beaten them except in one case; and  those on Vreedenhoop appeared perfectly contented. The interpreter, who  had abused them, had been fined, punished, and dismissed. Upon the  motion of W. E. Gladstone, these reports were laid upon the table of the  House in 1840.[19]    We shall have not unimportant glimpses, as our story unfolds itself, of  all these transactions. Meanwhile, it is interesting to note that the  statesman whose great ensign was to be human freedom, was thus born in a  family where the palliation of slavery must have made a daily topic. The  union, moreover, of fervid evangelical religion with antagonism to  abolition must in those days have been rare, and in spite of his devoted  faith in his father the youthful Gladstone may well have had uneasy  moments. If so, he perhaps consoled himself with the authority of  Canning. Canning, in 1823, had formally laid down the neutral principles  common to the statesmen of the day: that amelioration of the lot of the  negro slave was the utmost limit of action, and that his freedom as a  result of amelioration was the object of a pious hope, and no more.  Canning described the negro as a being with the form of a man and the  intellect of a child. 'To turn him loose in the manhood of his physical  strength, in the maturity of his physical passions, but in the infancy  of his uninstructed reason, would be to raise up a creature resembling  the splendid fiction of a recent romance,[20] the hero of which  constructs a human form with all the corporal capabilities of a man, but  being unable to impart to the work of his hands a perception of right  and wrong, he finds too late that he has only created a more than mortal  power of doing mischief.' 'I was bred,' said Mr. Gladstone when risen to  meridian splendour, 'under the shadow of the great name of Canning;  every influence connected with"]]]
