Some dogs heard the fox, and came tearing through the thick underbrush.  They saw the fox and started after him.    The fox slyly led them on to the frozen river toward the bear. The bear  saw them coming, and called to the fox to go around some other way. The  fox made believe he did not hear, and came straight on to the bear to  ask him what he had said.    The dogs leaped upon the bear. The bear struggled. He gave one great  pull, and freed himself from the ice. He struck at the dogs so fiercely  with his great paws, that they soon left him, and went on after the fox.    Dogs have been running after foxes ever since.    When the bear got his breath, he stood up and looked around at his tail.  He found he had only a small piece left. Most of his tail had been left  in the ice.    This is why bears have short tails, and why dogs still love to chase the  fox.          WHY HERMIT THRUSH IS SO SHY      [Illustration]    Some moons after the council when the birds chose their feathered suits,  a second council was called. The purpose of this council was to see  which bird could fly to heaven, and bring a song to earth.    When all the birds had arrived and were perched upon the council tree,  the wise old owl spoke.    \"Friends and brothers, listen,\" said the owl. \"Many of you have strong  wings, but your voices are not beautiful. High, high up in the sky, a  long trail beyond the clouds, is the Happy Hunting Ground.    \"There live all our brothers of the wood, whom the Great Spirit has  called. They sing songs more beautiful than any heard on earth.    \"The bird that can fly beyond the clouds will hear that singing. He  shall bring a song to earth. Who will fly the Great Sky Trail, and bring  a song to earth? Who-whoo! Who-whoo! Who-whoo!\"    At this, all the birds that were swift of wing flew high in the air.  They circled round and round to show their skill. Then they disappeared  in the clouds.    But one by one they dropped to earth; for when they had reached the  Great Sky Trail beyond the clouds, they were too tired to take it.    At last the eagle arose and stretched his great wings.    \"Listen,\" he said, \"for the Chief of Birds speaks. No other bird is so  swift and so strong as the eagle. He has circled the earth. He has flown  to the rim of the world. The eagle will fly the Great Sky Trail and  bring the song to earth.\"    A little brown thrush sat near the eagle.    \"Oh,\" he thought, \"how I would like to bring that song to earth!\"    But he was so small, and his wings were so tired!    Then an idea popped into the little brown head of the thrush. He hopped  softly to the back of the eagle, and hid in the thick feathers near the  neck. So small and light was the thrush, that the eagle did not feel his  weight. He did not know that the little brown thrush was on his  back,--and the other birds did not tell him.    The eagle spread his great wings. Up, and up, and up, they soared. The  council wood became a little speck and then was seen no more. Over, and  under, and through the clouds, on, and on, and on, they sailed, along  the Great Sky Trail.    [Illustration]    At last the eagle's strength began to fail. He could go no further. The  great wings of the chief of birds could beat the air no longer. They  fell at his side.    The little brown thrush felt the eagle quiver and begin to drop toward  the earth.    Then away flew the little brown thrush. The air was so light it seemed  easy to fly. On and on he went, for he was not tired. He had had a ride  almost to heaven.    \"Now,\" he thought, \"I will go on and will get the song.\"    For some time, the little brown thrush flew along the Great Sky Trail.  All at once the air seemed full of song. He knew he was nearing the  Happy Hunting Ground.    He listened. One song seemed more beautiful to him than the rest. Again  and again he listened. He caught the notes. He sang them many times,  until he was sure that he could carry the song to earth.    Then down, and down, and down, he floated, through clouds and storms and  sunshine, back to Mother Earth.    Very happy, he flew toward the council wood. He was so full of his  beautiful song and the wonderful Sky Trail, he thought he must pour out  his song at once.    But when he reached the council wood, he dared not open his mouth! He  remembered that he had stolen his ride part way to heaven,--and he knew  the other birds knew it.    But that song! he must sing it! He thought his throat would burst, if he  did not sing!    So the little brown thrush flew off by himself, into a deep, dark part  of the wood. There, hidden by the brush and the bushes, he poured forth  the song he had heard on the Great Sky Trail.    Men hearing it to-day, say, \"Listen, a hermit thrush! What a beautiful  song! But he is such a shy bird, one seldom can catch a glimpse of him.\"    They do not know why he keeps so close under cover.          HOW GOOD AND EVIL CAME TO BE      Every boy has wondered how there came to be two of him.    Every girl has puzzled over how she happened to be twins. Sometimes she  is the good girl,--sometimes a naughty one.    The Indians say this is how it happened.    The world was very young. There was no earth, only a cloud-like sea.    The sea was filled with water animals, and water birds flew over it. All  was dark. Light had not yet come.    Then the cloud-sea began to call for light. The Great Spirit heard, and  said, \"It shall be so. I will make a new place for man to live in.\"    The Great Spirit called the beautiful Sky Mother to Him. Her face was  like the sun, she was so light of heart.    The Great Spirit told the Sky Mother to look down. She, too, heard the  cloud-sea calling, and she said, \"I will go.\"    As she began to descend, the animals saw her coming. \"See the light,\"  they cried. \"Where will it rest?\"    One of the water animals said, \"I will go to the bottom of the sea and  get something for it to rest on.\"    He went down, but he never came back.    Other animals followed him. But they, too, did not come back.    Then the muskrat said, \"I will go. I will be the earth bringer.\"    He returned, with some mud in his mouth and claws.    \"It will grow fast,\" he cried, in a weak voice. \"Who will carry it?\"    The turtle offered his back. As the muskrat placed the mud on the  turtle's shell he died. But the beaver came and slapped the mud down  with his tail.    The mud on the turtle's back grew very fast. Soon it was a small island.  The turtle became the earth bearer. He has continued to hold up the  earth ever since.    Now, when the sea rises in great waves, or the earth shakes, the Indians  say, \"The turtle is stretching. He is wiggling his back!\"    Now, since there was a place for the light to rest on, the birds flew up  to meet it. They found that the light was the beautiful Sky Mother.    Then the birds spread wide their great wings, and bore the Sky Mother  through the air to the cloud-sea. They placed her on the island on the  turtle's back. There the Sky Mother had rested some time, when she felt  something stirring beneath her heart. She heard voices. One was soft and  kind and full of love, the other was harsh and quarrelsome.    Soon the Sky Mother looked into the faces of the first-born of earth,  for she had borne the twin brothers, the spirits of Good and Evil. As  she looked into the face of the Good Mind, she said, \"You shall be  called the Light One.\"    Then she looked into the face of his brother, and said, \"You shall be  named the Dark One.\"    The island became a beautiful land.    The twin brother Light One grew up happy, loving, peaceful, and kind. He  wanted to make the new land the most beautiful place in which to live.  The twin brother Dark One grew up sullen, quarrelsome, hateful, and  unkind. He tried to make the land the worst place in which to live.    From his mother's beautiful face the Light One made the sun. He set it  in the eastern sky, that it might shine forever. Then the Dark One put  darkness in the west to drive the sun from the sky.    The Light One gave his mother's body to the earth, the Great Mother from  which springs all life. He made great mountains, and covered them with  forests from which beautiful rivers ran. The Dark One threw down the  mountains, gnarled the forests, and bent the rivers which his brother  had made.    Every beautiful thing which the good brother Light One made, the bad  brother Dark One tried to destroy and ruin.    And because the first-born of earth were the twin spirits, the Good Mind  and the Evil Mind, there has been a good and bad spirit born into every  boy and girl who has come into the world since.    So the Indians say!          HOW A BOY WAS CURED OF BOASTING      There was once an Indian boy, who thought he knew more and could do more  than anyone else. He was so proud of himself that he walked around like  a great chief, who wears a war shirt with many scalp locks on it.    The other Indian boys and girls called him Spread Feather, because he  strutted about like a big turkey or a peacock.    One day, Spread Feather was playing ball with the other boys. Not once  had he failed to drive or catch the ball with his crosse stick. Twice he  had thrown the ball with such force that some one had been hurt.    Spread Feather grew more and more pleased with himself, as he played. He  began to use tricks and to talk very large.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    \"No one can play ball as I,\" he said. \"I can catch the swiftest ball  that can be thrown. I can throw the ball to the sky. I can run faster  than the deer.\"    Spread Feather boasted so loudly that a rabbit heard him. The rabbit  came out of the bushes and sat up on his hind legs. He watched Spread  Feather play, and listened to his boasting.    Soon a strange boy was standing where the rabbit had sat.    The stranger said to Spread Feather, \"I would like to play ball with  you.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/221"],[0,"The Return of Sherlock Holmes (#6)"],[1,"indication, and yet it was enough to tell me  that the great malignant brain was there, as the gentlest tremors of  the edges of the web remind one of the foul spider which lurks in the  centre. Petty thefts, wanton assaults, purposeless outrage--to the man  who held the clue all could be worked into one connected whole. To the  scientific student of the higher criminal world no capital in Europe  offered the advantages which London then possessed. But now----\" He  shrugged his shoulders in humorous deprecation of the state of things  which he had himself done so much to produce.    At the time of which I speak Holmes had been back for some months, and  I, at his request, had sold my practice and returned to share the old  quarters in Baker Street. A young doctor, named Verner, had purchased my  small Kensington practice, and given with astonishingly little demur the  highest price that I ventured to ask--an incident which only explained  itself some years later when I found that Verner was a distant relation  of Holmes's, and that it was my friend who had really found the money.    Our months of partnership had not been so uneventful as he had stated,  for I find, on looking over my notes, that this period includes the case  of the papers of Ex-President Murillo, and also the shocking affair of  the Dutch steamship FRIESLAND, which so nearly cost us both our lives.  His cold and proud nature was always averse, however, to anything in the  shape of public applause, and he bound me in the most stringent terms  to say no further word of himself, his methods, or his successes--a  prohibition which, as I have explained, has only now been removed.    Mr. Sherlock Holmes was leaning back in his chair after his whimsical  protest, and was unfolding his morning paper in a leisurely fashion,  when our attention was arrested by a tremendous ring at the bell,  followed immediately by a hollow drumming sound, as if someone were  beating on the outer door with his fist. As it opened there came a  tumultuous rush into the hall, rapid feet clattered up the stair, and an  instant later a wild-eyed and frantic young man, pale, dishevelled, and  palpitating, burst into the room. He looked from one to the other of us,  and under our gaze of inquiry he became conscious that some apology was  needed for this unceremonious entry.    \"I'm sorry, Mr. Holmes,\" he cried. \"You mustn't blame me. I am nearly  mad. Mr. Holmes, I am the unhappy John Hector McFarlane.\"    He made the announcement as if the name alone would explain both his  visit and its manner; but I could see by my companion's unresponsive  face that it meant no more to him than to me.    \"Have a cigarette, Mr. McFarlane,\" said he, pushing his case across.  \"I am sure that with your symptoms my friend Dr. Watson here would  prescribe a sedative. The weather has been so very warm these last few  days. Now, if you feel a little more composed, I should be glad if you  would sit down in that chair and tell us very slowly and quietly who you  are and what it is that you want. You mentioned your name as if I should  recognise it, but I assure you that, beyond the obvious facts that  you are a bachelor, a solicitor, a Freemason, and an asthmatic, I know  nothing whatever about you.\"    Familiar as I was with my friend's methods, it was not difficult for me  to follow his deductions, and to observe the untidiness of attire, the  sheaf of legal papers, the watch-charm, and the breathing which had  prompted them. Our client, however, stared in amazement.    \"Yes, I am all that, Mr. Holmes, and in addition I am the most  unfortunate man at this moment in London. For Heaven's sake don't  abandon me, Mr. Holmes! If they come to arrest me before I have finished  my story, make them give me time so that I may tell you the whole  truth. I could go to gaol happy if I knew that you were working for me  outside.\"    \"Arrest you!\" said Holmes. \"This is really most grati--most interesting.  On what charge do you expect to be arrested?\"    \"Upon the charge of murdering Mr. Jonas Oldacre, of Lower Norwood.\"    My companion's expressive face showed a sympathy which was not, I am  afraid, entirely unmixed with satisfaction.    \"Dear me,\" said he; \"it was only this moment at breakfast that I was  saying to my friend, Dr. Watson, that sensational cases had disappeared  out of our papers.\"    Our visitor stretched forward a quivering hand and picked up the DAILY  TELEGRAPH, which still lay upon Holmes's knee.    \"If you had looked at it, sir, you would have seen at a glance what the  errand is on which I have come to you this morning. I feel as if my name  and my misfortune must be in every man's mouth.\" He turned it over to  expose the central page. \"Here it is, and with your permission I  will read it to you. Listen to this, Mr. Holmes. The head-lines are:  'Mysterious Affair at Lower Norwood. Disappearance of a Well-known  Builder. Suspicion of Murder and Arson. A Clue to the Criminal.' That is  the clue which they are already following, Mr. Holmes, and I know that  it leads infallibly to me. I have been followed from London Bridge  Station, and I am sure that they are only waiting for the warrant to  arrest me. It will break my mother's heart--it will break her heart!\"  He wrung his hands in an agony of apprehension, and swayed backwards and  forwards in his chair.    I looked with interest upon this man, who was accused of being the  perpetrator of a crime of violence. He was flaxen-haired and handsome  in a washed-out negative fashion, with frightened blue eyes and a  clean-shaven face, with a weak, sensitive mouth. His age may have been  about twenty-seven; his dress and bearing that of a gentleman. From the  pocket of his light summer overcoat protruded the bundle of endorsed  papers which proclaimed his profession.    \"We must use what time we have,\" said Holmes. \"Watson, would you  have the kindness to take the paper and to read me the paragraph in  question?\"    Underneath the vigorous head-lines which our client had quoted I read  the following suggestive narrative:--      Late last night, or early this morning, an incident occurred at Lower  Norwood which points, it is feared, to a serious crime. Mr. Jonas  Oldacre is a well-known resident of that suburb, where he has carried  on his business as a builder for many years. Mr. Oldacre is a bachelor,  fifty-two years of age, and lives in Deep Dene House, at the Sydenham  end of the road of that name. He has had the reputation of being a  man of eccentric habits, secretive and retiring. For some years he has  practically withdrawn from the business, in which he is said to have  amassed considerable wealth. A small timber-yard still exists, however,  at the back of the house, and last night, about twelve o'clock, an alarm  was given that one of the stacks was on fire. The engines were soon upon  the spot, but the dry wood burned with great fury, and it was impossible  to arrest the conflagration until the stack had been entirely consumed.  Up to this point the incident bore the appearance of an ordinary  accident, but fresh indications seem to point to serious crime. Surprise  was expressed at the absence of the master of the establishment from  the scene of the fire, and an inquiry followed, which showed that he had  disappeared from the house. An examination of his room revealed that the  bed had not been slept in, that a safe which stood in it was open,  that a number of important papers were scattered about the room, and,  finally, that there were signs of a murderous struggle, slight traces  of blood being found within the room, and an oaken walking-stick, which  also showed stains of blood upon the handle. It is known that Mr. Jonas  Oldacre had received a late visitor in his bedroom upon that night, and  the stick found has been identified as the property of this person, who  is a young London solicitor named John Hector McFarlane, junior partner  of Graham and McFarlane, of 426, Gresham Buildings, E.C. The police  believe that they have evidence in their possession which supplies  a very convincing motive for the crime, and altogether it cannot be  doubted that sensational developments will follow.    LATER.--It is rumoured as we go to press that Mr. John Hector McFarlane  has actually been arrested on the charge of the murder of Mr. Jonas  Oldacre. It is at least certain that a warrant has been issued. There  have been further and sinister developments in the investigation at  Norwood. Besides the signs of a struggle in the room of the unfortunate  builder it is now known that the French windows of his bedroom (which is  on the ground floor) were found to be open, that there were marks as  if some bulky object had been dragged across to the wood-pile, and,  finally, it is asserted that charred remains have been found among the  charcoal ashes of the fire. The police theory is that a most sensational  crime has been committed, that the victim was clubbed to death in his  own bedroom, his papers rifled, and his dead body dragged across to  the wood-stack, which was then ignited so as to hide all traces of the  crime. The conduct of the criminal investigation has been left in  the experienced hands of Inspector Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, who is  following up the clues with his accustomed energy and sagacity.      Sherlock Holmes listened with closed eyes and finger-tips together to  this remarkable account.    \"The case has certainly some points of interest,\" said he, in his  languid fashion. \"May I ask, in the first place, Mr. McFarlane, how  it is that you are still at liberty, since there appears to be enough  evidence to justify your arrest?\"    \"I live at Torrington Lodge, Blackheath, with my parents, Mr. Holmes;  but last night, having to do business very late with Mr. Jonas Oldacre,  I stayed at an hotel in Norwood, and came to my business from there. I  knew nothing of this affair until I was in the train, when I read "]]]
