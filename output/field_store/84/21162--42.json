(1) There are the remnants of the Turks who at one time threatened the  conquest of all Europe. Back from the walls of Vienna they have been  driven little by little until now they occupy the toe only of the Balkan  Peninsula. But the days have not far departed when they held almost all  the Peninsula, and the present smallness of their portion dates back  only from 1913.    (2) There are the Greeks, heirs of the traditions of Philip and  Alexander, and of the old Roman Empire. For centuries their national but  not their racial existence was dormant under the heel of the Turk. Greek  independence was restored recently, and since the war of 1912-1913 has  established itself vigorously.    (3) There are the Roumanians, descendants of the old Roman colony of  Trajan in Dacia.    (4) There are the Bulgars, originally a Tartar people coming from the  banks of the Volga, who entered Bulgaria in the seventh century as the  Normans entered England at a later date, and who mingled with a Slav  race they found there--at first as conquerors, afterwards becoming the  absorbed race.    (5) There are the Serbs, somewhat akin to the Bulgars, whose original  home seems to have been that of the Don Cossacks, who also came into the  Peninsula in the seventh century. They are of purer Slav blood than the  Bulgars.    (6) There are the Montenegrins, an off-shoot of the Serbs, who in the  fourteenth century, when the Servian Empire fell, took to the hills and  maintained their independence.    Those are the six main racial elements. But there are other scraps of  peoples--the Albanians, for example, and the Macedonians, and tribes of  Moslem Bulgars, and some Asiatic elements brought in by the Turks.    So far, then, the answer to the question, \"Why are the Balkans so often  at war?\" is easy of answer. Given the existence on one peninsula of six  different races, four of which have past great traditions of Empire, and  there is certain to be uneasy house-keeping. But the inquiry has to be  pushed further. Why is it that this unhappy Peninsula should have been  made thus a scrap-heap for bits of nations, a refuge for sore-headed  remnants of Imperial peoples? The answer to that is chiefly  geographical.    A study of the map will show that when there was a great movement from  the north of Europe to the south, its easiest line of march was down the  valley of the Danube along the Balkan Peninsula. In prehistoric times  the peoples around the European shores of the Mediterranean brought to  accomplishment a very advanced type of civilisation. It owed its  foundations to Egypt or to the Semitic peoples, such as the Phoenicians,  the Tyrians, and the Carthaginians, whose race-home was Asia Minor.  Whilst this Mediterranean civilisation was being shaped in the south--in  the north, in the forests or plains along the shores of the Baltic and  of the North Sea, the fecund Teutonic people were swelling to a mighty  host and overflowing their boundaries. A flood of these people in time  came surging south searching for new lands. The natural course of that  flood was by the valley of the Danube to the Balkan Peninsula. Down that  peninsula they cut their path--not without bloodshed one may guess--and  founded the Grecian civilisation. Of this prehistoric movement there is  no written evidence; but it is accepted by anthropologists as certain.  Thus Sir Harry Johnston records, not as a surmise but as a fact:          The Nordic races, armed with iron or steel swords, spears and      arrow-heads, descended on the Alpine, Iberian, Lydian, and      Aegean peoples of Southern Europe with irresistible strength. It      was iron against bronze, copper, and stone; and iron won the      day.        Prehistoric invasions of the Balkan Peninsula brought in the      fair-haired, blue-eyed Greeks, the semi-barbarian conquerors of      the Mukenaian and Minoan kingdoms. Tribes nearly allied to the      Ancient Greeks diverged from them in Illyria, invaded the      Italian Peninsula, and became the ancestors of the Sabines,      Oscans, Latins, etc.        The parent ancestral speech of the German tribes about four to      five thousand years ago was probably closely approximated in      syntax, and in the form and pronunciation of words, to the other      progenitors of European Aryan languages, especially the      Lithuanian, Slav, Greek, and Italic dialects. Keltic speech was      perhaps a little more different owing to its absorption of      non-Aryan elements; but if we can judge of prehistoric German      from what its eastern sister, the Gothic language, was like as      late as the fifth century B.C., we can, without too much      straining of facts, say that the prehistoric Greeks, when they      passed across Hungary into the mountainous regions of the      Balkans, and equally the early Italic invaders of Italy, were      simply another branch of the Teutonic peoples later in      separation than the Kelts, with whom, however, both the Italic      and the Hellenic tribes were much interwoven.... Very English or      German in physiognomy were most of the notabilities in the palmy      days of Greece, to judge by their portrait-busts and the types      of male and female beauty most in favour--as far south as      Cyprus--in the periods when Greek art had become realistic and      was released from the influence of an Aegean standard of beauty.    [Illustration: SISTOV, ON THE DANUBE]    The invasion from the North of people flowing south by way of the  Balkan Peninsula began that unhappy area's record of race-struggles and  constant warfare. The Greek civilisation had scarcely established itself  before it was attacked by an Asiatic Power--Persia. Again the Balkan  Peninsula was inevitably the scene of the conflict, and such battles as  Thermopylae and Marathon made names to resound for ever in the mouths of  men. The peril from Persia over, the Balkan Peninsula, after seeing the  struggles between the different Greek states for supremacy, was given  another great ordeal of blood by Philip of Macedonia and Alexander the  Great. Alexander carried a great invasion from Greece into the very  heart of Asia, but founded no permanent empire.    The next phase of Balkan history was under the Roman Power. When the  Roman strength had reached its zenith and entered upon the curve of  decay, it was on the Balkan boundaries of the Empire that the main  attack came. Finally, the rulers of the Roman Empire found it necessary  to concentrate their strength close to the point of attack, and the  capital was moved from Rome to Constantinople: the Roman Empire became  the Greek Empire. Thus, as we have seen in the previous chapter, the  Balkan Peninsula was chosen as the arena in which an Empire founded in  the Italian Peninsula was to die its long, uneasy death. The fate of  this Greek Empire had been hardly decided when a new racial element came  on the scene, and over the tottering Empire, already fighting fiercely  with Bulgar and Serb for its small surviving patch of territory, strode  the Turk in the full flush of his youthful strength, giving the last  blow to the rule of the Caesars, and threatening all Christian Europe  with conquest.    Made thus by the Fates the cockpit of the great struggles for  World-Empire, the Balkan Peninsula was doomed to a bloody history: and  the doom has not yet passed away. Perhaps it is some unconscious effect  on the mind of the pity of this that makes the traveller to the Balkans  feel so often a sympathy, almost unreasonable in intensity, for the  Balkan peoples. The Balkan acres which they till are home to them. To  civilisation those acres are the tournament field for the battles of  races and nations.    What is now Bulgaria was in the days of Herodotus inhabited by Thracian  and Illyrian tribes. They were united under the strong hand of Philip  of Macedonia, and Bulgaria counts him the first great figure in her  confused national history, and makes a claim to be the heir of his  Macedonian Empire. The Romans appeared in Bulgaria during the period of  the second war against Carthage. The Roman conquest of the Balkan  country was slow, but shortly before the Christian era the Roman  provinces of Moesia and Thracia comprised most of what is now Bulgaria.    In the days of Constantine, who removed the capital of his Empire to the  Balkan Peninsula, Roman civilisation in what is now Bulgaria was already  being swamped by barbarian invasions. The Goths and the Huns ravaged the  land fiercely without attempting to colonise it. The Slavs were invaders  of another type. They came to stay. It was at the beginning of the third  century that the Slavs made their first appearance, and, crossing the  Danube, began to settle in the great plains between the river and the  Balkan Mountains. Later, they went south-wards and formed colonies among  the Thraco-Illyrians, the Roumanians, and the Greeks. This Slav  occupation went on for several centuries. In the seventh century of the  Christian era a Hunnish tribe reached the banks of the Danube. It is  known that this tribe came from the Volga and, crossing Russia,  proceeded towards ancient Moesia, where it took possession of the whole  north-east territory of the Balkans between the Danube and the Black  Sea. These were the Bulgars, or Bolgars. The Slavs had already imposed  on the races they had found in the Peninsula their language and customs.  The Bulgars, too, assumed the language of the Slavs, and some of their  customs. The Bulgars, however, gave their name to the mixed race, and  assumed the political supremacy.    The analogy I have before suggested of the Norman invasion of England  and the Bulgar invasion of Bulgaria generally holds good. The Slavs were  a people who tilled the soil, cherished free institutions, fought on  foot, were gentle in character. The Bulgars "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22260"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Abbey Church of Tewkesbury (#6)"],[1,"2) put up for sale, but it  was withdrawn, and eventually given to the church. This lot was known  as the _Vaulted Chamber_, and formed a portion of the south aisle of  the nave which had been cut off from the rest of the building, and to  which access was given by a stone staircase outside the church and a  doorway in the wall by the nave.    Very few traces of the old monastic buildings are to be found, for  when the neighbouring ground has been levelled at various times large  quantities of stone have been dug up from the old foundations, and  utilised partly in constructing boundary walls, partly in repairs to  the building. The Abbey Gateway, which is well worth inspection, is  Perpendicular work, and is in surprisingly good repair, mainly owing  to the fact that for many years it was in private hands. It stands  very solid and square, and looks formidable with its battlements, but  the view through the open doorway is very fine--the foliage on the  trees beyond showing up the stonework. The work in the arches is good,  and the gargoyles are worthy of notice. The gateway was restored in  1849-50, and the gates are of about the same date.    In the cloister there are traces at the west of the outer parlour of  the monks, and the size of the cloisters is clearly seen to have been  eighty feet.    Of the place of this glorious Abbey in our own English history much  might be written, and in fact it has been a difficult task to steer a  course which, while avoiding too much history, should show that the  history is there. In all the great events of history down to the end  of the fifteenth century Tewkesbury Abbey has its place, and like the  Abbey of St. Peter at Westminster and the Cathedrals at Canterbury and  at Winchester, is in every respect a representative structure. \"It  represents all the greatest influences in our social development, it  directly embodies in its memories both the Crown, at the time when the  Crown was a _primum mobile_ in politics, and all the estates of the  realm. It shows the Church as the keystone in which the various  thrusts of those contending masses met and balanced each other. It  exhibits in the Church patron the official link between things  spiritual and temporal. Its great lay potentates, Saxon or Norman,  either deduce their lineage from royal blood, or at once mix their own  with it, and renew again and again their touch of royalty by fresh  inter-marriages until the pedigree is absorbed into that of the  reigning or rival sovereign. The House, after blazoning a leading  name, often _the_ leading name of each successive period, after  scoring repeated Plantagenet affinities, at length shares the  internecine havoc of the York and Lancaster factions, and its last  scions which survived that havoc are cut off on the scaffold for the  crime of being too near the throne. But the almost princely rank of  these founders, patrons, and benefactors is their least claim to  historical remembrance. They are always to be found grouped in the  very focus where the light of history falls strongest, men of the  foremost mark for high trust and safe counsel for foreign strife, or  civil broil\" (_Hayman_).       [Illustration: _Photo. R.W. Dugdale._     THE ABBEY GATEWAY.]    Thus in the four centuries after the Conquest we find Fitz-Hamon, the  second founder, connected by marriage with the great Norman soldier.  In the civil wars of Stephen, Robert Earl of Gloucester and Lord of  Tewkesbury, and his half-sister, Maud or Matilda, played the parts we  know so well. Again, Gilbert de Clare, who is buried in the Abbey, was  one of the chief signatories of Magna Charta. The last of the three  Gilberts de Clare fell at Bannockburn in 1314, at the age of  twenty-three. The heiress of the latter married a Despenser, a family  closely connected with Tewkesbury, two prominent members of which,  viz., the favoured ministers of Edward II., will be remembered as  by-words in history. Sir Guy de Brien, the valiant standard-bearer of  Edward III., was the second husband of the widow of the fifth Lord  Despenser, and, with her, helped to rebuild the choir, in the  ambulatory of which his splendid monument is still to be seen. The  Despensers in turn passed away, the last heiress marrying in  succession two cousins, each named Richard Beauchamp. Of her second  marriage were born two children--a son, who married the sister of  Warwick the king-maker, and a daughter, who became the wife of the  Earl of Warwick himself. The king-maker's two daughters were  unfortunate in their husbands, one of them having been married to the  luckless Duke of Clarence, and the other to the young Prince Edward,  who fell in 1471 at the battle of Tewkesbury. Of these noble patrons  of the Abbey from the first Tewkesbury De Clare to the time of the  ill-fated Duke of Clarence, all save two, _i.e._, the second Richard  Beauchamp and the great king-maker, Richard Neville, who are both  buried at Warwick, found their last resting-place in Tewkesbury.       [Illustration: TILE SHOWING THE ARMS OF FITZ-HAMON AND THE ABBEY     IMPALED.]       [Illustration: _Photo. D. Gwynne._     TEWKESBURY ABBEY, FROM THE NORTH.]    FOOTNOTES:    [1] The original stone is in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford.    [2] Mr. Blunt, in his \"Tewkesbury and its Associations,\" assigns the  northernmost chapel to St. James, and the one between it and the choir  aisle to St. Nicholas, but in his plan he reverses them. The plan in  the _Builder_ of December, 1894, follows Mr. Blunt's plan in so naming  the two chapels. Some have thought the present Northern Chapel to be  that dedicated to St. Eustachius.          CHAPTER II.    THE EXTERIOR.      One of the most characteristic views of the exterior is to be got from  the iron gates which give admission to the churchyard. The view thus  obtained presents to us, with the exception of the windows and the  pinnacles on the tower, features almost entirely Norman.    As it is impossible to make a complete circuit of the church, it is as  well to begin at the north transept. Here a wall will be found  projecting from the north-east corner, of which the western face is in  a very dilapidated condition. This wall contains a good Early English  pointed arch, which is now filled up with stonework and contains a  modern window. At the sides of the arch are Purbeck marble shafts with  a central shaft of the same, which divides it into two subordinate  arches, with an opening in the spandril between them. The base of the  dividing shaft is a block of marble, curiously carved, representing  four cats playing round the column. Each of the cats has in its mouth  the tail of the cat immediately in front.    On each side are the remains of a smaller recessed arch, and the only  portion of the north wall which is still standing contains one bay of  a trefoil-headed arcading which formerly was carried round the walls  of this chapel.    On the north wall of the transept the four bays of the vaulted roof  are discernible, and a fine Early English doorway in the wall (lately  restored) used to give admission to the main building. Originally,  when the church was perfect, this was an open arch. At the last  restoration a wall was built up inside, so that the arch might be left  clear. This chapel can hardly have been the one mentioned on p. 13,  which was dedicated to St. Eustachius, and was consecrated in 1246 by  Prior Henry de Banbury. It is much more likely to have been the nave  of the Early English Lady Chapel, of which the enclosed chapel to the  east was the choir. Bristol Cathedral has its elder Lady Chapel in a  similar position, though it was no doubt originally quite detached  from the main building. The corner buttress at the north-west angle of  the north transept was erected about the year 1720, and there is a  corresponding support to the south transept at its south-west angle.    The clerestory on this north side of the nave has a Norman arcade,  supported on short shafts, which extends from the tower to the west  front. The insertion of the later windows, which presumably were  enlarged when the nave was vaulted, has destroyed the regularity of  the arcading.    A flying buttress of very slight proportions will be seen on the north  side between the north transept and the north porch.    =North Porch.=--For a porch of Norman construction this is of unusual  dimensions, measuring 24 feet by 20 feet and 39 feet high. It is  extremely simple in character inside and out. The roof is a plain  barrel vault of stone.    Both the internal and the external doorway have a circular arch  composed of a series of mouldings supported by shafting, just as in  the arch of the great west window.    Over the outside door of the porch stood an image of the Virgin Mary  with the infant Christ, typical of the Incarnation, but it has  suffered much at the hands of would-be zealots. Over the porch is a  room or parvise, very difficult of access and badly lighted.    This north porch was in all probability built on to the church soon  after the completion of the rest of the Norman building, and this may  account for the difficult means of access.    Between the porch and the west end there are traces of some earlier  building, abutting on to the north wall of the church.    The iron gates at the main entrance to the churchyard near the \"Bell  Hotel\" were formerly mounted in the external doorway of the porch.  They were given to the church by Lord Gage in 1750.    =The Tower.=--This is generally considered to be one of the finest and  most perfect Norman towers in existence. Its massive size (each side  measuring 46 feet) takes off from its actual height. It stands well,  and is impressive from its proportions and the simplicity of its  ornament. It is 132 feet high from the ground to the battlements  inclusive, and 148 to the top of the pinnacles. The pinnacles and  battlements were added in 1660, as the inscription on the north-we"]]]
