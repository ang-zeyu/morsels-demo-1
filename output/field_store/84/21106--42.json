If my own servant  could not believe my innocence, how could I hope to make it good before  twelve foolish tradesmen in a jury-box?  Lal Chowdar and I disposed of  the body that night, and within a few days the London papers were full  of the mysterious disappearance of Captain Morstan.  You will see from  what I say that I can hardly be blamed in the matter.  My fault lies in  the fact that we concealed not only the body, but also the treasure,  and that I have clung to Morstan's share as well as to my own.  I wish  you, therefore, to make restitution.  Put your ears down to my mouth.  The treasure is hidden in--'  At this instant a horrible change came  over his expression; his eyes stared wildly, his jaw dropped, and he  yelled, in a voice which I can never forget, 'Keep him out!  For  Christ's sake keep him out!'  We both stared round at the window behind  us upon which his gaze was fixed.  A face was looking in at us out of  the darkness.  We could see the whitening of the nose where it was  pressed against the glass.  It was a bearded, hairy face, with wild  cruel eyes and an expression of concentrated malevolence. My brother  and I rushed towards the window, but the man was gone.  When we  returned to my father his head had dropped and his pulse had ceased to  beat.    \"We searched the garden that night, but found no sign of the intruder,  save that just under the window a single footmark was visible in the  flower-bed.  But for that one trace, we might have thought that our  imaginations had conjured up that wild, fierce face.  We soon, however,  had another and a more striking proof that there were secret agencies  at work all round us.  The window of my father's room was found open in  the morning, his cupboards and boxes had been rifled, and upon his  chest was fixed a torn piece of paper, with the words 'The sign of the  four' scrawled across it.  What the phrase meant, or who our secret  visitor may have been, we never knew.  As far as we can judge, none of  my father's property had been actually stolen, though everything had  been turned out.  My brother and I naturally associated this peculiar  incident with the fear which haunted my father during his life; but it  is still a complete mystery to us.\"    The little man stopped to relight his hookah and puffed thoughtfully  for a few moments.  We had all sat absorbed, listening to his  extraordinary narrative.  At the short account of her father's death  Miss Morstan had turned deadly white, and for a moment I feared that  she was about to faint.  She rallied however, on drinking a glass of  water which I quietly poured out for her from a Venetian carafe upon  the side-table.  Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair with an  abstracted expression and the lids drawn low over his glittering eyes.  As I glanced at him I could not but think how on that very day he had  complained bitterly of the commonplaceness of life.  Here at least was  a problem which would tax his sagacity to the utmost.  Mr. Thaddeus  Sholto looked from one to the other of us with an obvious pride at the  effect which his story had produced, and then continued between the  puffs of his overgrown pipe.    \"My brother and I,\" said he, \"were, as you may imagine, much excited as  to the treasure which my father had spoken of.  For weeks and for  months we dug and delved in every part of the garden, without  discovering its whereabouts.  It was maddening to think that the  hiding-place was on his very lips at the moment that he died.  We could  judge the splendor of the missing riches by the chaplet which he had  taken out.  Over this chaplet my brother Bartholomew and I had some  little discussion.  The pearls were evidently of great value, and he  was averse to part with them, for, between friends, my brother was  himself a little inclined to my father's fault.  He thought, too, that  if we parted with the chaplet it might give rise to gossip and finally  bring us into trouble.  It was all that I could do to persuade him to  let me find out Miss Morstan's address and send her a detached pearl at  fixed intervals, so that at least she might never feel destitute.\"    \"It was a kindly thought,\" said our companion, earnestly.  \"It was  extremely good of you.\"    The little man waved his hand deprecatingly.  \"We were your trustees,\"  he said.  \"That was the view which I took of it, though Brother  Bartholomew could not altogether see it in that light.  We had plenty  of money ourselves.  I desired no more. Besides, it would have been  such bad taste to have treated a young lady in so scurvy a fashion. 'Le  mauvais gout mene au crime.'  The French have a very neat way of  putting these things. Our difference of opinion on this subject went so  far that I thought it best to set up rooms for myself:  so I left  Pondicherry Lodge, taking the old khitmutgar and Williams with me.  Yesterday, however, I learn that an event of extreme importance has  occurred.  The treasure has been discovered.  I instantly communicated  with Miss Morstan, and it only remains for us to drive out to Norwood  and demand our share.  I explained my views last night to Brother  Bartholomew:  so we shall be expected, if not welcome, visitors.\"    Mr. Thaddeus Sholto ceased, and sat twitching on his luxurious settee.  We all remained silent, with our thoughts upon the new development  which the mysterious business had taken.  Holmes was the first to  spring to his feet.    \"You have done well, sir, from first to last,\" said he.  \"It is  possible that we may be able to make you some small return by throwing  some light upon that which is still dark to you.  But, as Miss Morstan  remarked just now, it is late, and we had best put the matter through  without delay.\"    Our new acquaintance very deliberately coiled up the tube of his  hookah, and produced from behind a curtain a very long befrogged  topcoat with Astrakhan collar and cuffs.  This he buttoned tightly up,  in spite of the extreme closeness of the night, and finished his attire  by putting on a rabbit-skin cap with hanging lappets which covered the  ears, so that no part of him was visible save his mobile and peaky  face.  \"My health is somewhat fragile,\" he remarked, as he led the way  down the passage.  \"I am compelled to be a valetudinarian.\"    Our cab was awaiting us outside, and our programme was evidently  prearranged, for the driver started off at once at a rapid pace.  Thaddeus Sholto talked incessantly, in a voice which rose high above  the rattle of the wheels.    \"Bartholomew is a clever fellow,\" said he.  \"How do you think he found  out where the treasure was?  He had come to the conclusion that it was  somewhere indoors:  so he worked out all the cubic space of the house,  and made measurements everywhere, so that not one inch should be  unaccounted for.  Among other things, he found that the height of the  building was seventy-four feet, but on adding together the heights of  all the separate rooms, and making every allowance for the space  between, which he ascertained by borings, he could not bring the total  to more than seventy feet. There were four feet unaccounted for.  These  could only be at the top of the building.  He knocked a hole,  therefore, in the lath-and-plaster ceiling of the highest room, and  there, sure enough, he came upon another little garret above it, which  had been sealed up and was known to no one.  In the centre stood the  treasure-chest, resting upon two rafters.  He lowered it through the  hole, and there it lies.  He computes the value of the jewels at not  less than half a million sterling.\"    At the mention of this gigantic sum we all stared at one another  open-eyed.  Miss Morstan, could we secure her rights, would change from  a needy governess to the richest heiress in England. Surely it was the  place of a loyal friend to rejoice at such news; yet I am ashamed to  say that selfishness took me by the soul, and that my heart turned as  heavy as lead within me.  I stammered out some few halting words of  congratulation, and then sat downcast, with my head drooped, deaf to  the babble of our new acquaintance.  He was clearly a confirmed  hypochondriac, and I was dreamily conscious that he was pouring forth  interminable trains of symptoms, and imploring information as to the  composition and action of innumerable quack nostrums, some of which he  bore about in a leather case in his pocket.  I trust that he may not  remember any of the answers which I gave him that night.  Holmes  declares that he overheard me caution him against the great danger of  taking more than two drops of castor oil, while I recommended  strychnine in large doses as a sedative. However that may be, I was  certainly relieved when our cab pulled up with a jerk and the coachman  sprang down to open the door.    \"This, Miss Morstan, is Pondicherry Lodge,\" said Mr. Thaddeus Sholto,  as he handed her out.        Chapter V    The Tragedy of Pondicherry Lodge    It was nearly eleven o'clock when we reached this final stage of our  night's adventures.  We had left the damp fog of the great city behind  us, and the night was fairly fine.  A warm wind blew from the westward,  and heavy clouds moved slowly across the sky, with half a moon peeping  occasionally through the rifts.  It was clear enough to see for some  distance, but Thaddeus Sholto took down one of the side-lamps from the  carriage to give us a better light upon our way.    Pondicherry Lodge stood in its own grounds, and was girt round with a  very high stone wall topped with broken glass.  A single narrow  iron-clamped door formed the only means of entrance. On this our guide  knocked with a peculiar postman-like rat-tat.    \"Who is there?\" cried a gruff voice from within.    \"It is I, McMurdo.  You surely know my knock by this time.\"    There was a grumbling sound and a clanking and jarring of keys. The  door swung heavily back, and a short, deep-chested man stood in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20987"],[0,"Story of the War in South Africa, 1899-1900 (#6)"],[1,"right and left sending a rapid continuous iron fire  over their heads upon the hill-top, whence the Boers rained down lead  upon their advance. Few dropped here; but in the wood, where for quite  a while they halted, concealed rather than covered, many were struck  down, and here it was that death found General Symons, who had  galloped up to tell the men the hill _must_ be taken. He had asked  much of his men, but he spared not himself. He fell honoured and  beloved; man cannot die better.    It was about 10 that Symons received his wound. Obedient to his last  commands, the troops broke cover and worked their way from the wood to  the wall, step by step; a few feet onward, rushed and down; again a  rush and again down. Below the terrace they stopped, protected by the  wall but unable to advance; for did man show head or hand, down swept  the deadly fire from above. Men, however, are not of iron; eyes and  hands weary; the brain and the nerves feel strain; and it is of the  essence of defence that it exhausts quicker than does offence.  {p.045} It lacks intrinsically the moral tension that sustains; when  the forward impulse is removed, the evil spirit of backwardness finds  room to enter. As hours pass, this difference in moral conditions  affects those which are external--saps physical endurance.    Whatever the reason, toward noon the Boer fire slackened; possibly the  necessity of husbanding ammunition was felt. The British scaled the  wall, crossed rapidly the terrace, and gained the foot of the last  steep climb which lay between them and the enemy's position. Their  artillery also moved forward, to sustain the final perilous attempt by  keeping down the enemy's fire; but, despite all it could do, the loss  here was great and fell especially heavily upon the officers, who  exposed themselves freely. Out of seventeen of the latter that went  into action with one battalion, five were killed and seven wounded;  and the other regiments suffered in like manner, if not to the same  degree. As the assailants got near the top, the batteries had to cease  firing, unable longer to assure their aim between friend and foe. The  last rush was then made with the bayonet, but, as is usual, {p.046}  the defendants did not await the shock of immediate contact. They  broke and fled as the British advance crowned the summit, leaving  there some thirty dead and wounded, besides seventy wounded in a field  hospital on the reverse side of the hill. The artillery of the attack  continued to move forward to Smith's Nek, whence the enemy's force was  visible in full retreat. It was at 1.30 P.M. that the position, which  General Yule, Symons's successor, styled \"almost inaccessible,\" was  finally carried.    The precise numbers engaged can as yet be only a matter of estimate,  but there is little doubt that the assailants were inferior in number  to the defenders. The former were about 2,000; the latter were by  General Yule thought to be about 4,000, many of whom, doubtless, were  not on the hill itself. The satisfaction of the victors, in what was  certainly a splendid feat of arms, was somewhat marred by the  disappearance of a body of cavalry, which at the opening of the day  had been sent to work round the enemy's right--northern--flank. They  had been taken prisoners, apparently by the co-operating Boer {p.047}  force which had failed to come up in time for the fighting.    The following afternoon--Saturday, the 21st--a demonstration was made  by this force; but it was not pushed home, being confined to a  bombardment by two heavy guns--40-pounders--at a range of 6,000 yards.  In prevision of such an attempt, Yule had already shifted some of his  equipage, and now, finding that the hostile guns outranged his own, he  removed the camp two miles to the southward, on high ground. On the  22nd, news being received of the enemy's defeat at Elandslaagte the  day before, he endeavoured to cut off the fugitives at Glencoe, but  the nearness of the northern Boers compelled him to desist, and  finally to resume his last position. Realising from all the conditions  that Dundee could not be held, unless reinforced, and that  reinforcement was improbable, he decided now to retreat upon  Ladysmith.    At 9 P.M. that night the British marched out, taking their transport  trains, but necessarily leaving the wounded behind them. The road  followed diverges from the railroad to the {p.048} eastward, crossing  the Biggarsberg, and coming out at a place called Beith. There it  forks, the right-hand branch trending toward Ladysmith, parallel to  the railroad and distant from it eight to ten miles. The march was  severe, for the pace was necessarily rapid and sustained, and the  roads heavy from recent rains; nor was it without serious risk from  the nearness of the enemy, although the battle of Talana Hill had done  much to free the eastern flank, and that of Elandslaagte the western.  No molestation was experienced.    It is necessary now to narrate the operations of the Ladysmith  garrison, which cannot in effect be dissociated from those of its  dependant at Dundee.    The demonstrations of the Boers, in various directions, kept Sir  George White in doubt as to their immediate intentions until Thursday,  the 19th, when Elandslaagte was occupied by the force under General  Koch. The same day word was received of the enemy's approach to  Dundee. Both movements threatened to isolate the latter. On the 20th a  reconnaissance toward Elandslaagte {p.049} was made by General  French, who had arrived the day before from England. Thick weather  prevented precise determination of the hostile numbers or position,  but the general fact was established. That evening the successful  results of the day's action at Dundee became known, and the next  morning--Saturday, October 21--the reconnaissance was resumed under  better atmospheric conditions. From a cliff between two and three  miles from Elandslaagte a clear view of the enemy was obtained, and  their fire drawn, which proved that both numerically and in artillery  they were superior to the detachment before them. They had expected  reinforcements, and those engaged in the ensuing affair were probably  nearer 2,000 than to the 1,000 of two days before.    French telegraphed to Ladysmith and received a promise of more troops,  the last of which arrived--the infantry by train--about 3 P.M.  Meantime the enemy had quitted Elandslaagte for a ridge of rocky hills  about a mile and a half south-east of the station--a position  characterised as exceptionally strong by Sir George White, who  witnessed {p.050} the affair, but left its management in French's  hands. More in detail, the ridge is described as being about 800 feet  high, 800 to 1,000 yards long, and in a general sense perpendicular to  the railroad; lying, therefore, south-east and north-west. At the  latter extremity, nearer the road, are two marked elevations, with a  neck between them, in which was the Boers' laager. Of these the  westernmost is the higher, but both commanded the rest of the ridge  throughout its full extent to the south-east. In front of the ridge  the country, of general rolling contour, presents a shallow valley  some two or three miles wide. The near side of this to the British,  when the latter first advanced, was occupied by a few Boers, but these  fell back quickly to their main body. In making their dispositions the  Boers occupied in chief force the western elevations, intrenching  their artillery on the inner and lower of the two. A thinner firing  line was developed thence to the eastward, along the summit of the  ridge covering the approach from the front. A flank being usually the  weakest part of a line, the natural course for the assailant would  {p.051} be to attack in flank at the lower--eastern--extremity of the  ridge, and to advance thence toward the main positions, supported in  so doing by a secondary front attack by riflemen and artillery. To  impede such an attempt the Boers had set up at intervals barbed wire  fences. Through these, and over a broken rocky surface, the attacking  column must fight its way, step by step, till the final hills were  reached and could be rushed as Talana had been by their countrymen the  day before.    The plan above outlined was the one adopted by General French; seven  companies of infantry being allotted to the front attack, a regiment  and five companies to that upon the flank. A few squadrons of cavalry  accompanied the latter movement, as well to protect it when in  performance as to profit by any mishap befalling the enemy. The troops  formed just below and under cover of the rising ground on the hither  side of the valley fronting the hostile line. The fire of the latter  was drawn, and the situation of their artillery thus discovered--despite  the use of smokeless powder--by the flashes of their {p.052} guns,  which showed the more clearly against the blackness of a big thunder  cloud rising behind the Dutch positions, which enabled the British  also to see distinctly the bursting of their own shrapnel over the  enemy.    The usual artillery duel succeeded at a distance of 4,500 yards--two  miles and a half--but from the lateness of the hour, and the amount of  work ahead, no time could be lost, so the infantry operation began as  quickly as possible. The front attack moved down into the valley, a  firing line of three hundred men covering the space of 500 yards from  end to end, its remaining companies following at intervals to support  it, and to replace those who fell--to \"feed\" the line, keeping it at  full strength.    The first part of this advance was, on account of the distance,  resisted chiefly by artillery fire, which, though accurate, was seen  to cause there few casualties. At 1,200 yards from the enemy's  positions, being there well within rifle range, the line halted, lay  down, and opened fire. The smooth surface of the ground gave little"]]]
