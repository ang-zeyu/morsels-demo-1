There was a man in our town,      And he was wondrous wise;    He jumped into a bramble bush,      And scratch'd out both his eyes;      And when he saw his eyes were out,      With all his might and main,    He jump'd into another bush,      And scratch'd them in again.

And so the teacher turned it out, but still it lingered near,    And waited patiently about till Mary did appear.    \"Why does the lamb love Mary so,\" the eager children cry,    \"Why, Mary loves the lamb, you know!\" the teacher did reply.

The king was in his counting-house,      Counting out his money;    The queen was in the parlor,      Eating bread and honey.      The maid was in the garden,      Hanging out the clothes;    Down came a blackbird,      And pecked off her nose.

It was  twenty years ago that he had been coming to the house--this same  house--and she had thought that he was coming to see her, had never  thought of Lily at all till Lily had told her of her own betrothal to  him. It hurt yet. It had hurt freshly when he had died, seven years ago.  Now Lily was dead, and Adam's eldest son, John, wanted to send this  little brother to her, to have.    \"I won't take him,\" she said a great many times, and kept reading the  letter and staring out into the snow.    For Lily she had no tears--she seldom had tears at all. But after a  little while she was conscious of a weight through her and in her,  aching in her throat, her breast, her body. She rose and went near to  the warmth of the fire, then to the freedom of the window against which  the snow lay piled, then she sat down in the place where she worked,  beside her patterns. The gray shawl still bound her head, and it was  still in her mind that she must go to the barn and lock it. But she did  not go--she sat in the darkening room with all her past crowding it....    ... That first day with Adam at the Blood's picnic, given at his  home-coming. They had met with all that perilous, ready-made intimacy  which a school friendship of years before had allowed. As she had walked  beside him she had known well what he was going to mean to her. She  remembered the moment when he had contrived to ask her to wait until the  others went, so that he might walk home with her. And when they had  reached home, there on the porch--where she had just shaken the rugs in  the snow--Lily had been sitting, a stool--one of the stools now at  length banished to the shed--holding the hurt ankle that had kept her  from the picnic. Adam had stayed an hour, and they had sat beside Lily.  He had come again and again, and they had always sat beside Lily. Mary  remembered that those were the days when she was happy in _things_--in  the house and the look of the rooms and of the little garden from the  porch, and of the old red-cushioned rocking-chairs on the tiny \"stoop.\"  She had loved her clothes and her little routines, and all these things  had seemed desirable and ultimate because they two were sharing them.  Then one day Mary had joined Lily and Adam there on the porch, and Lily  had been looking up with new eyes, and Mary had searched her face, and  then Adam's face; and they had all seemed in a sudden nakedness; and  Mary had known that a great place was closed against her.    Since then house and porch and garden and routines had become like those  of other places. She had always been shut outside something, and always  she had borne burdens. The death of her parents, gadflys of need, worst  of all a curious feeling that the place closed against her was somehow  herself--that, so to say, she and herself had never once met. She used  to say that to herself sometimes, \"There's two of me, and we don't  meet--we don't meet.\"    \"And now he wants me to take her boy and Adam's,\" she kept saying; \"I'll  never do such a thing--never.\"    She thought that the news of Lily's death was what gave her the strange,  bodily hurt that had seized her--the news that what she was used to was  gone; that she had no sister; that the days of their being together and  all the tasks of their upbringing were finished. Then she thought that  the remembering of those days of her happiness and her pain, and the  ache of what might have been and of what never was, had come to torture  her again. But the feeling was rather the weight of some imminent thing,  the ravage of something that grew with what it fed on, the grasp upon  her of something that would not let her go....    She had never seen them after their marriage, and so she had never seen  either of the children. Lily had once sent her a picture of John, but  she had never sent one of this other little boy. Mary tried to recall  what they had ever said of him. She could not even remember his  baptismal name, but she knew that they had called him \"Yes\" because it  was the first word he had learned to say, and because he had said it to  everything. \"The baby can say 'Yes,'\" Lily had written once; \"I guess  it's all he'll ever be able to say. He says it all day long. He won't  try to say anything else.\" And once later: \"We've taken to calling the  baby 'Yes,' and now he calls himself that. 'Yes wants it,' he says, and  'Take Yes,' and 'Yes is going off now.' His father likes it. He says yes  is everything and no is nothing. I don't think that means much, but we  call him that for fun....\" But Mary could not remember what the child's  real name was. What difference did it make? As if she could have a child  meddling round the house while she was sewing. But of course this was  not the real reason. The real reason was that she could not bring up a  child--did she not know that?    \"... He's six years old now and Aunt Mary this ain't a place for him.  He's a nice little fellow and I hate for him to get rough and he will if  he stays here....\"    She tried to think who else could take him. They had no one. Adam, she  knew, had no one. Some of the neighbours there by the ranch ... it was  absurd to send him that long journey ... so she went through it all,  denying with all the old denials. And all the while the weight in her  body grew and filled her, and she was strangely conscious of her breath.    \"What ails me?\" she said aloud, and got up to kindle a light. She was  amazed to see that it was seven o'clock, and long past her supper hour.  As she took from the clock shelf the key to the barn, some one rapped at  the back door and came through the cold kitchen with friendly  familiarity. It was Jenny, a shawl over her head, her face glowing with  the cold, and in her mittened hands a flat parcel.    \"My hand's most froze,\" Jenny admitted. \"I didn't want to roll this  thing, so I carried it flat out, and it blew consider'ble. It's the  picture.\"    \"Get yourself warm,\" Mary bade her. \"I'll undo it. Who is it of?\" she  added, as the papers came away.    \"That's what I don't know,\" said Jenny, \"but I've always liked it  around. I thought maybe you'd know.\"    It was a picture which, in those days, had not before come to Old Trail  Town. The figure was that of a youth, done by a master of the times--the  head and shoulders of a youth who seemed to be looking passionately at  something outside the picture.    \"There it is, anyhow,\" Jenny added. \"If you like it enough to hang it  up, hang it up. It's a Christmas present!\" Jenny laughed elfishly.    Mary Chavah held the picture out before her.    \"I do,\" she said; \"I could take a real fancy to it. I'll have it up on  the wall. Much obliged, I'm sure. Set down a minute.\"    But Jenny could not do this, and Mary, the key to the barn still in her  hands, followed her out. They went through the cold kitchen where the  refrigerator and the ironing board and the clothes bars and all the  familiar things stood in the dark. To Mary these were sunk in a great  obscurity and insignificance, and even Jenny being there was unimportant  beside the thing that her letter had brought to think about. They  stepped out into the clear, glittering night, with its clean, white  world, and its clean, dark sky on which some story was written in stars.  Capella was shining almost overhead--and another star was hanging bright  in the east, as if the east were always a dawning place for some new  star.    \"Mary!\" said Jenny, there in the dark.    \"Yes,\" Mary answered.    \"You know I said I just couldn't bear not to have any Christmas--_this_  Christmas?\"    \"Yes,\" Mary said.    \"Did you know why?\"    \"I thought because it's your and Bruce's first--\"    \"No,\" Jenny said, \"that isn't all why. It's something else.\"    She slipped her arm within Mary's and stood silent. And, Mary still not  understanding,--    \"It's somebody else,\" Jenny said faintly.    Mary stirred, turned to her in the dimness.    \"Why, Jenny!\" she said.    \"Soon,\" said Jenny.    The two women stood for a moment, Jenny saying a little, Mary quiet.    \"It'll be late in December,\" Jenny finished. \"That seems so wonderful to  me--so wonderful. Late in December, like--\"    The cold came pricking about them, and Jenny moved to go. Mary, the  shawled figure on the upper step, looked down on the shawled figure  below her, and abruptly spoke.    \"It's funny,\" Mary said, \"that you should tell me that--now. I haven't  told you what's in my letter.\"    \"What was?\" asked Jenny.    Mary told her. \"They want I should have the little boy,\" she ended it.    \"Oh....\" Jenny said. \"Mary! How wonderful for you! Why, it's almost next  as wonderful as mine!\"    Mary hesitated for a breath. But she was profoundly stirred by what  Jenny had told her--the first time, so far as she could recall, that  news like this had ever come to her directly, as a secret and a marvel.  News of the village births usually came in gossip, in commiseration, in  suspicion. Falling as did this confidence in a time when she was  re-living her old hope, when Adam's boy stood outside her threshold, the  moment quite suddenly put on its real significance.    \"We can plan together,\" Jenny was saying. \"Ain't it wonderful?\"    \"Ain't it?\" Mary said then, simply, and kissed Jenny, when Jenny came  and kissed her. Then Jenny went away.    Mary went on to the barn, and opened the door, and listened. She had  brought no lantern, but the soft stillness within needed no vigilance.  The hay smell from the loft and the mangers, the even breath of the  cows, the quiet safety of the place, met her. She was wondering at  herself, but she was struggling not at all. It was as if concerning the  little boy, something had decided for her, in a soft, fierce rush of  feeling not her own. She had committed herself to Jenny almost without  will. But Mary felt no exultation, and the weight within her did not  lift.    \"I really couldn't do anything else but take him,"]]]
