With boots clogged and heavy with filth, a hundred people like ravenous  birds of prey yelling in your ears (and picking your pockets if they have  a chance), with your luggage being mercilessly dragged in the mud, with  everybody demanding backshish on all sides, tapping you on the shoulder  or pulling your coat,--thus one lands in real Persia.    In the country of Iran one does not travel for pleasure nor is there any  pleasure in travelling. For study and interest, yes. There is plenty of  both everywhere.    Personally, I invariably make up my mind when I start for the East that  no matter what happens I will on no account get out of temper, and this  self-imposed rule--I must admit--was never, in all my travels, tried to  the tantalising extent that it was in the country of the Shah. The  Persian lower classes--particularly in places where they have come in  contact with Europeans--are well-nigh intolerable. There is nothing that  they will not do to annoy you in every possible way, to extort backshish  from you. In only one way do Persians in this respect differ from other  Orientals. The others usually try to obtain money by pleasing you and  being useful and polite, whereas the Persian adopts the quicker, if not  safer, method of bothering you and giving you trouble to such an  unlimited degree that you are compelled to give something in order to get  rid of him. And in a country where no redress can be obtained from the  police, where laws do not count, and where the lower classes are as  corrupt and unscrupulous as they are in the more civilised parts of  Persia (these remarks do not apply to the parts where few or no Europeans  have been) the only way to save one's self from constant worry and  repressed anger--so bad for one's health--is to make up one's mind at  once to what extent one is prepared to be imposed upon, and leave the  country after. That is to say, if one does not wish to adopt the only  other and more attractive alternative of inflicting summary justice on  two-thirds of the natives one meets,--too great an exertion, to be sure,  in so hot a climate.    They say that Persia is the country that our stock came from. It is quite  possible, and if so we are indeed to be congratulated upon having morally  improved so much since, or the Persians to be condoled with on their sad  degeneration. The better classes, however, are very different, as we  shall see later.    Personally, I adopted the first method suggested above, the easier of the  two, and I deliberately put by what I thought was a fair sum to be  devoted exclusively to extortion. On leaving the country several months  later, much to my astonishment I found that I had not been imposed upon  half as much as I expected, although I had stayed in Persia double the  time I had intended. Maybe this can be accounted for by my having spent  most of my time in parts not so much frequented by Europeans. Indeed, if  the Persian is to-day the perfidious individual he is, we have to a great  extent only ourselves to blame for making him so.    Keeping my temper under control, and an eye on my belongings, I next  hired a carriage to convey me to the town of Resht, seven miles distant.  In damp heat, that made one's clothes moist and unpleasant, upon a road  muddy to such an extent that the wheels sank several inches in it and  splashed the passenger all over, we galloped through thick vegetation and  patches of agriculture, and entered the city of Resht. Through the narrow  winding streets of the bazaar we slowed down somewhat in some places, the  carriage almost touching the walls of the street on both sides. The  better houses possess verandahs with banisters painted blue, while the  walls of the buildings are generally white.    One is struck by the great number of shoe shops in the bazaar, displaying  true Persian shoes with pointed turned-up toes,--then by the brass and  copper vessel shops, the ancient and extremely graceful shapes of the  vessels and amphoras being to this date faithfully preserved and  reproduced. More pleasing still to the eye are the fruit shops, with huge  trays of water-melons, cucumbers, figs, and heaps of grapes. The latter  are, nevertheless, not so very tasty to the palate and do not compare  with the delicate flavour of the Italian or Spanish grapes.    Somewhat incongruous and out-of-place, yet more numerous than truly  Persian shops, are the semi-European stores, with cheap glass windows  displaying inside highly dangerous-looking kerosene lamps, badly put  together tin goods, soiled enamel tumblers and plates, silvered glass  balls for ceiling decoration, and the vilest oleographs that the human  mind can devise, only matched by the vileness of the frames. Small  looking-glasses play an important part in these displays, and  occasionally a hand sewing-machine. Tinned provisions, wine and liquor  shops are numerous, but unfortunate is the man who may have to depend  upon them for his food. The goods are the remnants of the oldest stocks  that have gradually drifted, unsold, down to Baku, and have eventually  been shipped over for the Persian market where people do not know any  better. Resht is the chief city in the Ghilan province.    Ghilan's trade in piece-goods is about two-thirds in the hands of Russia,  while one-third (or even less) is still retained by England,--Manchester  goods. This cannot well be helped, for there is no direct route from  Great Britain to Resht, and all British goods must come through Bagdad,  Tabriz, or Baku. The two first routes carry most of the trade, which  consists principally of shirtings, prints, cambrics, mulls, nainsooks,  and Turkey-reds, which are usually put down as of Turkish origin, whereas  in reality they come from Manchester, and are merely re-exported, mainly  from Constantinople, by native firms either in direct traffic or in  exchange for goods received.    One has heard a great deal of the enormous increase in trade in Persia  during the last couple of years or so. The increase has not been in the  trade itself, but in the collection of Customs dues, which is now done in  a regular and business like fashion by competent Belgian officials,  instead of by natives, to whom the various collecting stations were  formerly farmed out.    It will not be very easy for the British trader to compete successfully  with the Russian in northern Persia, for that country, being  geographically in such close proximity, can transport her cheaply made  goods at a very low cost into Iran. Also the Russian Government allows  enormous advantages to her own traders with Persia in order to secure the  Persian market, and to develop her fast-increasing industrial  progress,--advantages which British traders do not enjoy. Still,  considering all the difficulties British trade has to contend with in  order to penetrate, particularly into Ghilan, it is extraordinary how  some articles, like white Manchester shirtings, enjoy practically a  monopoly, being of a better quality than similar goods sent by Russia,  Austria, Hungary, Germany, Italy or Holland.    Loaf sugar, which came at one time almost entirely from France, has been  cut out by Russian sugar, which is imported in large quantities and  eventually finds its way all over Persia. It is of inferior quality, but  very much cheaper than sugar of French manufacture, and is the chief  Russian import into Ghilan.    Tobacco comes principally from Turkey and Russia. In going on with our  drive through the bazaar we see it sold in the tiny tobacco shops, where  it is tastily arranged in heaps on square pieces of blue paper, by the  side of Russian and Turkish cigarettes.    [Illustration: Persian Wrestling.]    And now for the Resht Hotels. Here is an Armenian hotel--European style.  From the balcony signs and gesticulations and shouts in English, French,  and Russian endeavour to attract the passer-by--a youth even rushes to  the horses and stops them in order to induce the traveller to alight and  put up at the hostelry; but after a long discussion, on we go, and slowly  wind our way through the intricate streets crowded with men and women and  children--all grumbling and making some remark as one goes by. At one  point a circle of people squatting in the middle of a road round a pile  of water-melons, at huge slices of which they each bit lustily, kept us  waiting some time, till they moved themselves and their melons out of the  way for the carriage to pass. Further on a soldier or two in rags lay  sleeping flat on the shady side of the road, with his pipe (kalian) and  his sword lying by his side. Boys were riding wildly on donkeys and  frightened women scrambled away or flattened themselves against the side  walls of the street, while the hubs of the wheels shaved and greased  their ample black silk or cotton trousers made in the shape of sacks, and  the horses' hoofs splashed them all over with mud. The women's faces were  covered with a white cloth reaching down to the waist. Here, too, as in  China, the double basket arrangement on a long pole swung across the  shoulders was much used for conveying loads of fruit and vegetables on  men's shoulders;--but least picturesque of all were the well-to-do  people of the strong sex, in short frock-coats pleated all over in the  skirt.    One gets a glimpse of a picturesque blue-tiled pagoda-like roof with a  cylindrical column upon it, and at last we emerge into a large  quadrangular square, with European buildings to the west side.    A little further the British flag flies gaily in the wind above H.M.'s  Consulate. Then we come upon a larger building, the Palace of the  Governor, who, to save himself the trouble and expense of having sentries  at the entrances, had life-size representations of soldiers with drawn  swords painted on the wall. They are not all represented wearing the same  uniform, as one would expect with a guard"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22125"],[0,"The Venetian Painters of the Renaissance (#6)"],[1,"  saints were impressed for the same purpose--happily for us, for while  the portraits in the Great Hall have perished, several altar-pieces  still preserve to us the likenesses of some of the Doges.    Early in the sixteenth century, when people began to want pictures in  their own homes as well as in their public halls, personal and  religious motives combined to dictate the choice of subjects. In the  minds of many, painting, although a very familiar art, was too much  connected with solemn religious rites and with state ceremonies to be  used at once for ends of personal pleasure. So landscape had to slide in  under the patronage of St. Jerome; while romantic biblical episodes,  like the \"Finding of Moses,\" or the \"Judgment of Solomon,\" gave an  excuse for _genre_, and the portrait crept in half hidden under the  mantle of a patron saint. Its position once secure, however, the  portrait took no time to cast off all tutelage, and to declare itself  one of the most attractive subjects possible. Over and above the obvious  satisfaction afforded by a likeness, the portrait had to give pleasure  to the eye, and to produce those agreeable moods which were expected  from all other paintings in Giorgione's time. Portraits like that of  Scarampo are scarcely less hard to live with than such a person himself  must have been. They tyrannize rather than soothe and please. But  Giorgione and his immediate followers painted men and women whose very  look leads one to think of sympathetic friends, people whose features  are pleasantly rounded, whose raiment seems soft to touch, whose  surroundings call up the memory of sweet landscapes and refreshing  breezes. In fact, in these portraits the least apparent object was the  likeness, the real purpose being to please the eye and to turn the mind  toward pleasant themes. This no doubt helps to account for the great  popularity of portraits in Venice during the sixteenth century. Their  number, as we shall see, only grows larger as the century advances.      =X. The Young Titian.=--Giorgione's followers had only to exploit the vein  their master hit upon to find ample remuneration. Each, to be sure,  brought a distinct personality into play, but the demand for the  Giorgionesque article, if I may be allowed the phrase, was too strong to  permit of much deviation. It no longer mattered what the picture was to  represent or where it was going to be placed; the treatment had to be  always bright, romantic, and joyous. Many artists still confined  themselves to painting ecclesiastical subjects chiefly, but even among  these, such painters as Lotto and Palma, for example, are fully as  Giorgionesque as Titian, Bonifazio, or Paris Bordone.    Titian, in spite of a sturdier, less refined nature, did nothing for a  generation after Giorgione's death but work on his lines. A difference  in quality between the two masters shows itself from the first, but the  spirit that animated each is identical. The pictures Titian was painting  ten years after his companion's death have not only many of the  qualities of Giorgione's, but something more, as if done by an older  Giorgione, with better possession of himself, and with a larger and  firmer hold on the world. At the same time, they show no diminution of  spontaneous joy in life, and even an increased sense of its value and  dignity. What an array of masterpieces might be brought to witness! In  the \"Assumption,\" for example, the Virgin soars heavenward, not helpless  in the arms of angels, but borne up by the fulness of life within her,  and by the feeling that the universe is naturally her own, and that  nothing can check her course. The angels seem to be there only to sing  the victory of a human being over his environment. They are embodied  joys, acting on our nerves like the rapturous outburst of the orchestra  at the end of \"Parsifal.\" Or look at the \"Bacchanals\" in Madrid, or at  the \"Bacchus and Ariadne\" in the National Gallery. How brimful they are  of exuberant joy! you see no sign of a struggle of inner and outer  conditions, but life so free, so strong, so glowing, that it almost  intoxicates. They are truly Dionysiac, Bacchanalian triumphs--the  triumph of life over the ghosts that love the gloom and chill and hate  the sun.    The portraits Titian painted in these years show no less feeling of  freedom from sordid cares, and no less mastery over life. Think of \"The  Man with the Glove\" in the Louvre, of the \"Concert,\" and \"Young  Englishman\" in Florence, and of the Pesaro family in their altar-piece  in the Frari at Venice--call up these portraits, and you will see that  they are true children of the Renaissance whom life has taught no  meannesses and no fears.      =XI. Apparent Failure of the Renaissance.=--But even while such pictures  were being painted, the spirit of the Italian Renaissance was proving  inadequate to life. This was not the fault of the spirit, which was the  spirit of youth. But youth cannot last more than a certain length of  time. No matter how it is spent, manhood and middle age will come. Life  began to show a sterner and more sober face than for a brief moment it  had seemed to wear. Men became conscious that the passions for  knowledge, for glory, and for personal advancement were not at the  bottom of all the problems that life presented. Florence and Rome  discovered this suddenly, and with a shock. In the presence of  Michelangelo's sculptures in San Lorenzo, or of his \"Last Judgment,\" we  still hear the cry of anguish that went up as the inexorable truth  dawned upon them. But Venice, although humiliated by the League of  Cambrai, impoverished by the Turk, and by the change in the routes of  commerce, was not crushed, as was the rest of Italy, under the heels of  Spanish infantry, nor so drained of resource as not to have some wealth  still flowing into her coffers. Life grew soberer and sterner, but it  was still amply worth the living, although the relish of a little  stoicism and of earnest thought no longer seemed out of place. The  spirit of the Renaissance had found its way to Venice slowly; it was  even more slow to depart.    We therefore find that toward the middle of the sixteenth century, when  elsewhere in Italy painting was trying to adapt itself to the hypocrisy  of a Church whose chief reason for surviving as an institution was that  it helped Spain to subject the world to tyranny, and when portraits were  already exhibiting the fascinating youths of an earlier generation  turned into obsequious and elegant courtiers,--in Venice painting kept  true to the ripened and more reflective spirit which succeeded to the  most glowing decades of the Renaissance. This led men to take themselves  more seriously, to act with more consideration of consequences, and to  think of life with less hope and exultation. Quieter joys were sought,  the pleasures of friendship and of the affections. Life not having  proved the endless holiday it had promised to be, earnest people began  to question whether under the gross masque of the official religion  there was not something to console them for departed youth and for the  failure of hopes. Thus religion began to revive in Italy, this time not  ethnic nor political, but personal,--an answer to the real needs of the  human soul.      =XII. Lotto.=--It is scarcely to be wondered at that the Venetian artist  in whom we first find the expression of the new feelings, should have  been one who by wide travel had been brought in contact with the  miseries of Italy in a way not possible for those who remained sheltered  in Venice. Lorenzo Lotto, when he is most himself, does not paint the  triumph of man over his environment, but in his altar-pieces, and even  more in his portraits, he shows us people in want of the consolations of  religion, of sober thought, of friendship and affection. They look out  from his canvases as if begging for sympathy.    But real expression for the new order of things was not to be found by  one like Lotto, sensitive of feeling and born in the heyday of the  Renaissance, to whom the new must have come as a disappointment. It had  to come from one who had not been brought in personal contact with the  woes of the rest of Italy, from one less conscious of his environment,  one like Titian who was readier to receive the patronage of the new  master than to feel an oppression which did not touch him personally; or  it had to come from one like Tintoretto, born to the new order of things  and not having to outlive a disappointment before adapting himself to  it.      =XIII. The Late Renaissance and Titian.=--It is as impossible to keep  untouched by what happens to your neighbours as to have a bright sky  over your own house when it is stormy everywhere else. Spain did not  directly dominate Venice, but the new fashions of life and thought  inaugurated by her nearly universal triumph could not be kept out. Her  victims, among whom the Italian scholars must be reckoned, flocked to  Venice for shelter, persecuted by a rule that cherished the Inquisition.  Now for the first time Venetian painters were brought in contact with  men of letters. As they were already, fortunately for themselves, too  well acquainted with the business of their own art to be taken in tow by  learning or even by poetry, the relation of the man of letters to the  painter became on the whole a stimulating and at any rate a profitable  one, as in the instance of two of the greatest, where it took the form  of a partnership for mutual advantage. It is not to our purpose to speak  of Aretino's gain, but Titian would scarcely have acquired such fame in  his lifetime if that founder of modern journalism, Pietro Aretino, had  not been at his side, eager to trumpet his praises and to advise him  whom to court.    The overwhelming triumph of Spain entailed still another consequence. It  brought home to all Italians, even to the Venetians, the sense of the"]]]
