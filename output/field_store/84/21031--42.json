It is the night before Christmas and the scene is on a big ocean-going  vessel many miles out at sea. Down in the lower part of the ship, in  the steerage, is a group of poor little immigrant children who are  leaving the trials and troubles of the old world behind them and are  looking forward to the golden promises held out by our own \"land of  the free and the home of the brave.\" But the hearts of the little  immigrants are sad. It is the night before Christmas, and how could  Santa Claus ever hope to reach them away out in the middle of the  ocean? Even the sleigh and the magical reindeers could never be  expected to make such a trip.    Anita, a little Italian girl, alone has faith in the coming of the  good Saint. She is wandering around the ship when all of a sudden,  much to her surprise, she hears a mysterious noise in a great big  barrel, and who should jump out but little Jack Frost himself. Jack  assures her that Santa Claus really is coming to visit the ship, and  more than that, he is going to make an especial trip in an air ship!  And this is little Anita's secret. The children all fall asleep, but  Anita keeps watch for the mysterious aeroplane that will bring joy to  every little heart in the steerage, and, sure enough, just a little  before midnight Anita and Jack Frost look through a telescope and see  the lights of the approaching air ship.    Soon Santa Claus himself is on board, and such a time as he and Anita  and jolly Jack Frost have in arranging a wonderful Christmas surprise  for the children. As an especial favor the good Saint decides to  awaken the children himself very early on Christmas morning. The clock  strikes twelve and it is Christmas Day. The bells of merry Christmas  are heard chiming in the distance, and Santa Claus and jolly Jack  Frost hold a Christmas morning revel with the little immigrant  children away down in the steerage of the big vessel.           *       *       *       *       *    SCENE: _The steerage of a large ocean-going vessel.

The ship is sail-ing ver-y fast,       We can't go out to play;       But Christmas Day is com-ing soon,       It is-n't far a-way.         2. We're sail-ing to A-mer-i-ca,       So far a-cross the sea,       We're hap-py lit-tle im-mi-grants,       Our hearts are light and free.         3. We're hap-py lit-tle for-eign-ers,       From far a-cross the way,       But soon we will be cit-i-zens       Of dear old U.S.A.         Then clap, clap, clap to-geth-er,       Clap, clap, a-way;       The steer-age is a hap-py place--       Tomorrow's Christmas Day.]    (_On the words \"clap, clap, clap together,\" the children hold left  hand horizontally in front of their chests, palm upward, raising the  right hand and bringing it down on the left with a sharp clap._    _Sing the first verse seated around stage. On the first four lines of  the second verse nod heads and smile at audience. On the line \"We're  happy little immigrants,\" each one points to chest, nods head and  smiles broadly._    _For the third verse all rise and stand in couples in small groups all  around stage. On the first two lines of the third verse each one faces  his partner slightly, nods at him and shakes index finger of right  hand at partner. On \"dear, old U.S.A.\" all make a deep bow to  audience. After third verse is completed, all form a circle and skip  around in time to the music, repeating the third verse. On \"clap,  clap, clap together,\" they stand still and clap hands as before. When  the song is ended all resume former positions, as at the rise of the  curtain, but the boys do not play leapfrog._)    TOMASSO (_seated on floor at C._). Tomorrow comes the great, grand  festival of Christmas, is it not, Paddy Mike?    PADDY MIKE (_seated near him, nods his head_). Sure and it is. This is  the holy Christmas Eve.    MEENY (_seated down L., knitting stocking_). The night of the day  behind Christmas is always Christmas Eve, ain't it? (_Nods head._)  Sure it is.    SCHWILLIE. Und tomorrow we gets lots of Christmas presents always, me  und Klinker; don't we, Klinker?    KLINKER. Sure we do. Leedle horses and pictures und candy und other  things also; don't we, Schwillie Willie Winkum?    HULDA. That was when we were at home in Holland. It's different,  maybe, out here in this great big boat. Ven we get by the city of New  York next week then maybe we'll get some presents already.    KLINKER. But good Saint Nicholas always comes the night before  Christmas; don't he, Schwillie Willie Winkum?    SCHWILLIE. Sure. Won't he come tonight, Hulda?    HULDA. How could he get way out here on the ocean already? Do you  think he is a fish? We ain't living at home in Holland no more. We're  way out on the Atlantic Ocean in a great big ship.    MEENY. Ja, und I wish I was back at home already. So much have I been  seasick, mit der ship going oop und down, oop und down! Ach, it's  awful. (SERGIUS, TOMASSO, YAKOB, PADDY MIKE _and_ AH GOO _play  jack-stones._)    KLINKER. But Saint Nicholas ought to come tonight, Hulda. I been a  awfully good boy, isn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?    SCHWILLIE. Sure you is. Und I've been a awfully good boy, too. Isn't  I, Klinker?    KLINKER. Sure. We've been awfully good boys.    HULDA. Maybe even if Saint Nicholas don't come tonight, you can see  the great, big whale tomorrow. If he's a good whale he'll surely let  the leedle Dutch twins see him on Christmas Day.    MEENY. Oh, I vant to see der whale. I've looked und I've looked und  I've looked, but I ain't even so much as seen his leedle tail yet  already. Und it makes me seasick to look so much, too.    BIDDY MARY. Are ye sure it was a whale ye saw that day, Sergius boy?    SERGIUS. Of course I'm sure. It was awful big. The biggest fish I ever  saw. Even in Russia we do not have such big fish as whales. Paddy Mike  saw it, too.    PADDY MIKE. Sure and I did. And me two eyes nearly fell out of me head  with lookin' at it, it was that wonderful. He shot a big stream of  water right up out of his head, he did, and then he dived down in the  ocean again, and we didn't see him any more at all, at all. (MIEZE  _and_ SANO SAN _turn backs to audience and look over the railing into  the water._)    HULDA (_to the twins_). There! Now if you get to see the great big  whale, that's almost as good as having old Saint Nicholas come, ain't  it?    SCHWILLIE. Whales can't bring you no Christmas presents, can they,  Klinker?    KLINKER. Und whales you can see any time. I'd rather have Saint  Nicholas, wouldn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?    SERGIUS. Who is this Saint Nicholas they are looking for, Hulda?    HULDA (_astonished_). Why, don't you know who he is yet? He's the best  old man that ever was. Und he comes the night before Christmas und  visits all the little children in Holland.    MEENY (_proudly_). Und in Germany, too. (SERGIUS _goes to_ HULDA.)    KLINKER. Und if they're good they get candy und oranges und toys und  things, don't they, Schwillie Willie Winkum?    SCHWILLIE. Und if they're bad, they get a good big birch stick. But I  ain't been bad. I've been awfully good, isn't I, Klinker?    KLINKER. Sure. Und me also.    HULDA (_to_ SERGIUS). On Christmas Eve in Holland all the children  march around the streets, following one who carries a big silver star.  And the people who meet us give us money and gifts to help the poor.  Oh, Christmas time is just grand in Holland!    KLINKER. Und we set out our leedle wooden shoes und old Saint Nicholas  fills 'em with candy.    SCHWILLIE. Und we put a leedle bit of hay in our shoes for his good  old horsie, Sleipner. Dot makes him happy.    MEENY. In Germany we call him Santa Claus, und he comes riding in a  sleigh drawn through the sky mit reindeers. Und we have Christmas  trees all lighted mit candles und things, und full of toys und paper  stars und angels und apples. But Santa Claus could never get out here  in der middle of der ocean. If he did maybe he'd get seasick already,  und all der reindeers would get drownded in der water.    SERGIUS (_standing R.C._). In Russia there is an old woman named  Babouska who visits all the children on the night before Christmas.  She carries a big basket full of good things.    TOMASSO (_seated on floor at C._). In sunny Italy the children all go  to midnight church on Christmas Eve, and when we make ourselves awake  on Christmas morning, our shoes are all full of candy and chestnuts  and figs and oranges.
