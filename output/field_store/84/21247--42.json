That movement, particularly on  its political side, I shall treat in the next chapter. At present let  us examine the other aspects of the Mohammedan Revival, with special  reference to its religious and cultural phases.    The Wahabi movement was a strictly puritan reformation. Its aim was the  reform of abuses, the abolition of superstitious practices, and a return  to primitive Islam. All later accretions--the writings and  interpretations of the mediaeval theologians, ceremonial or mystical  innovations, saint worship, in fact every sort of change, were  condemned. The austere monotheism of Mohammed was preached in all its  uncompromising simplicity, and the Koran, literally interpreted, was  taken as the sole guide for human action. This doctrinal simplification  was accompanied by a most rigid code of morals. The prayers, fastings,  and other practices enjoined by Mohammed were scrupulously observed. The  most austere manner of living was enforced. Silken clothing, rich food,  wine, opium, tobacco, coffee, and all other indulgences were sternly  proscribed. Even religious architecture was practically tabooed, the  Wahabis pulling down the Prophet's tomb at Medina and demolishing the  minarets of mosques as godless innovations. The Wahabis were thus,  despite their moral earnestness, excessively narrow-minded, and it was  very fortunate for Islam that they soon lost their political power and  were compelled thenceforth to confine their efforts to moral teaching.    Many critics of Islam point to the Wahabi movement as a proof that Islam  is essentially retrograde and innately incapable of evolutionary  development. These criticisms, however, appear to be unwarranted. The  initial stage of every religious reformation is an uncritical return to  the primitive cult. To the religious reformer the only way of salvation  is a denial of all subsequent innovations, regardless of their  character. Our own Protestant Reformation began in just this way, and  Humanists like Erasmus, repelled and disgusted by Protestantism's  puritanical narrowness, could see no good in the movement, declaring  that it menaced all true culture and merely replaced an infallible Pope  by an infallible Bible.    As a matter of fact, the puritan beginnings of the Mohammedan Revival  presently broadened along more constructive lines, some of these  becoming tinged with undoubted liberalism. The Moslem reformers of the  early nineteenth century had not dug very deeply into their religious  past before they discovered--Motazelism. We have already reviewed the  great struggle which had raged between reason and dogma in Islam's early  days, in which dogma had triumphed so completely that the very memory of  Motazelism had faded away. Now, however, those memories were revived,  and the liberal-minded reformers were delighted to find such striking  confirmation of their ideas, both in the writings of the Motazelite  doctors and in the sacred texts themselves. The principle that reason  and not blind prescription was to be the test opened the door to the  possibility of all those reforms which they had most at heart. For  example, the reformers found that in the traditional writings Mohammed  was reported to have said: \"I am no more than a man; when I order you  anything respecting religion, receive it; when I order you about the  affairs of the world, then I am nothing more than man.\" And, again, as  though foreseeing the day when sweeping changes would be necessary. \"Ye  are in an age in which, if ye abandon one-tenth of that which is  ordered, ye will be ruined. After this, a time will come when he who  shall observe one-tenth of what is now ordered will be redeemed.\"[9]    Before discussing the ideas and efforts of the modern Moslem reformers,  it might be well to examine the assertions made by numerous Western  critics, that Islam is by its very nature incapable of reform and  progressive adaptation to the expansion of human knowledge. Such is the  contention not only of Christian polemicists,[10] but also of  rationalists like Renan and European administrators of Moslem  populations like Lord Cromer. Lord Cromer, in fact, pithily summarizes  this critical attitude in his statement: \"Islam cannot be reformed; that  is to say, reformed Islam is Islam no longer; it is something else.\"[11]    Now these criticisms, coming as they do from close students of Islam  often possessing intimate personal acquaintance with Moslems, deserve  respectful consideration. And yet an historical survey of religions, and  especially a survey of the thoughts and accomplishments of Moslem  reformers during the past century, seem to refute these pessimistic  charges.    In the first place, it should be remembered that Islam to-day stands  just about where Christendom stood in the fifteenth century, at the  beginning of the Reformation. There is the same supremacy of dogma over  reason, the same blind adherence to prescription and authority, the same  suspicion and hostility to freedom of thought or scientific knowledge.  There is no doubt that a study of the Mohammedan sacred texts,  particularly of the \"sheriat\" or canon law, together with a glance over  Moslem history for the last thousand years, reveal an attitude on the  whole quite incompatible with modern progress and civilization. But was  not precisely the same thing true of Christendom at the beginning of the  fifteenth century? Compare the sheriat with the Christian canon law. The  spirit is the same. Take, for example, the sheriat's prohibition on the  lending of money at interest; a prohibition which, if obeyed, renders  impossible anything like business or industry in the modern sense. This  is the example oftenest cited to prove Islam's innate incompatibility  with modern civilization. But the Christian canon law equally forbade  interest, and enforced that prohibition so strictly, that for centuries  the Jews had a monopoly of business in Europe, while the first  Christians who dared to lend money (the Lombards) were regarded almost  as heretics, were universally hated, and were frequently persecuted.  Again, take the matter of Moslem hostility to freedom of thought and  scientific investigation. Can Islam show anything more revolting than  that scene in Christian history when, less than three hundred years  ago,[12] the great Galileo was haled before the Papal Inquisition and  forced, under threat of torture, to recant the damnable heresy that the  earth went round the sun?    As a matter of fact, Mohammed reverenced knowledge. His own words are  eloquent testimony to that. Here are some of his sayings:    \"Seek knowledge, even, if need be, on the borders of China.\"    \"Seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave.\"    \"One word of knowledge is of more value than the reciting of a hundred  prayers.\"    \"The ink of sages is more precious than the blood of martyrs.\"    \"One word of wisdom, learned and communicated to a Moslem brother,  outweighs the prayers of a whole year.\"    \"Wise men are the successors of the Prophet.\"    \"God has created nothing better than reason.\"    \"In truth, a man may have prayed, fasted, given alms, made pilgrimage,  and all other good works; nevertheless, he shall be rewarded only in the  measure that he has used his common sense.\"    These citations (and there are others of the same tenor) prove that the  modern Moslem reformers have good scriptural backing for their liberal  attitude. Of course I do not imply that the reform movement in Islam,  just because it is liberal and progressive, is thereby _ipso facto_  assured of success. History reveals too many melancholy instances to the  contrary. Indeed, we have already seen how, in Islam itself, the  promising liberal movement of its early days passed utterly away. What  history does show, however, is that when the times favour progress,  religions are adapted to that progress by being reformed and  liberalized. No human society once fairly on the march was ever turned  back by a creed. Halted it may be, but if the progressive urge persists,  the doctrinal barrier is either surmounted, undermined, flanked, or  swept aside. Now there is no possibility that the Moslem world will  henceforth lack progressive influences. It is in close contact with  Western civilization, and is being increasingly permeated with Western  ideas. Islam cannot break away and isolate itself if it would.  Everything therefore portends its profound modification. Of course  critics like Lord Cromer contend that this modified Islam will be Islam  no longer. But why not? If the people continue to call themselves  Mohammedans and continue to draw spiritual sustenance from the message  of Mohammed, why should they be denied the name? Modern Christianity is  certainly vastly different from mediaeval Christianity, while among the  various Christian churches there exist the widest doctrinal variations.  Yet all who consider themselves Christians are considered Christians by  all except bigots out of step with the times.    Let us now scrutinize the Moslem reformers, judging them, not by texts  and chronicles, but by their words and deeds; since, as one of their  number, an Algerian, very pertinently remarks, \"men should be judged,  not by the letter of their sacred books, but by what they actually  do.\"[13]    Modern Moslem liberalism, as we have seen, received its first  encouragement from the discovery of the old Motazelite literature of  nearly a thousand years before. To be sure, Islam had never been quite  destitute of liberal minds. Even in its darkest days a few voices had  been raised against the prevailing obscurantism. For example, in the  sixteenth century the celebrated El-Gharani had written: \"It is not at  all impossible that God may hold in reserve for men of the future  perceptions that have not been vouchsafed to the men of the past. Divine  munificence never ceases"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2412"],[0,"The Categories (#6)"],[1,"irascible in virtue of these. Similarly those abnormal psychic states  which are not inborn, but arise from the concomitance of certain other  elements, and are difficult to remove, or altogether permanent, are  called qualities, for in virtue of them men are said to be such and  such.    Those, however, which arise from causes easily rendered ineffective are  called affections, not qualities. Suppose that a man is irritable when  vexed: he is not even spoken of as a bad-tempered man, when in such  circumstances he loses his temper somewhat, but rather is said to be  affected. Such conditions are therefore termed, not qualities, but  affections.    The fourth sort of quality is figure and the shape that belongs to a  thing; and besides this, straightness and curvedness and any other  qualities of this type; each of these defines a thing as being such and  such. Because it is triangular or quadrangular a thing is said to have  a specific character, or again because it is straight or curved; in  fact a thing's shape in every case gives rise to a qualification of it.    Rarity and density, roughness and smoothness, seem to be terms  indicating quality: yet these, it would appear, really belong to a  class different from that of quality. For it is rather a certain  relative position of the parts composing the thing thus qualified  which, it appears, is indicated by each of these terms. A thing is  dense, owing to the fact that its parts are closely combined with one  another; rare, because there are interstices between the parts; smooth,  because its parts lie, so to speak, evenly; rough, because some parts  project beyond others.    There may be other sorts of quality, but those that are most properly  so called have, we may safely say, been enumerated.    These, then, are qualities, and the things that take their name from  them as derivatives, or are in some other way dependent on them, are  said to be qualified in some specific way. In most, indeed in almost  all cases, the name of that which is qualified is derived from that of  the quality. Thus the terms 'whiteness', 'grammar', 'justice', give us  the adjectives 'white', 'grammatical', 'just', and so on.    There are some cases, however, in which, as the quality under  consideration has no name, it is impossible that those possessed of it  should have a name that is derivative. For instance, the name given to  the runner or boxer, who is so called in virtue of an inborn capacity,  is not derived from that of any quality; for both those capacities have  no name assigned to them. In this, the inborn capacity is distinct from  the science, with reference to which men are called, e.g. boxers or  wrestlers. Such a science is classed as a disposition; it has a name,  and is called 'boxing' or 'wrestling' as the case may be, and the name  given to those disposed in this way is derived from that of the  science. Sometimes, even though a name exists for the quality, that  which takes its character from the quality has a name that is not a  derivative. For instance, the upright man takes his character from the  possession of the quality of integrity, but the name given him is not  derived from the word 'integrity'. Yet this does not occur often.    We may therefore state that those things are said to be possessed of  some specific quality which have a name derived from that of the  aforesaid quality, or which are in some other way dependent on it.    One quality may be the contrary of another; thus justice is the  contrary of injustice, whiteness of blackness, and so on. The things,  also, which are said to be such and such in virtue of these qualities,  may be contrary the one to the other; for that which is unjust is  contrary to that which is just, that which is white to that which is  black. This, however, is not always the case. Red, yellow, and such  colours, though qualities, have no contraries.    If one of two contraries is a quality, the other will also be a  quality. This will be evident from particular instances, if we apply  the names used to denote the other categories; for instance, granted  that justice is the contrary of injustice and justice is a quality,  injustice will also be a quality: neither quantity, nor relation, nor  place, nor indeed any other category but that of quality, will be  applicable properly to injustice. So it is with all other contraries  falling under the category of quality.    Qualities admit of variation of degree. Whiteness is predicated of one  thing in a greater or less degree than of another. This is also the  case with reference to justice. Moreover, one and the same thing may  exhibit a quality in a greater degree than it did before: if a thing is  white, it may become whiter.    Though this is generally the case, there are exceptions. For if we  should say that justice admitted of variation of degree, difficulties  might ensue, and this is true with regard to all those qualities which  are dispositions. There are some, indeed, who dispute the possibility  of variation here. They maintain that justice and health cannot very  well admit of variation of degree themselves, but that people vary in  the degree in which they possess these qualities, and that this is the  case with grammatical learning and all those qualities which are  classed as dispositions. However that may be, it is an incontrovertible  fact that the things which in virtue of these qualities are said to be  what they are vary in the degree in which they possess them; for one  man is said to be better versed in grammar, or more healthy or just,  than another, and so on.    The qualities expressed by the terms 'triangular' and 'quadrangular' do  not appear to admit of variation of degree, nor indeed do any that have  to do with figure. For those things to which the definition of the  triangle or circle is applicable are all equally triangular or  circular. Those, on the other hand, to which the same definition is not  applicable, cannot be said to differ from one another in degree; the  square is no more a circle than the rectangle, for to neither is the  definition of the circle appropriate. In short, if the definition of  the term proposed is not applicable to both objects, they cannot be  compared. Thus it is not all qualities which admit of variation of  degree.    Whereas none of the characteristics I have mentioned are peculiar to  quality, the fact that likeness and unlikeness can be predicated with  reference to quality only, gives to that category its distinctive  feature. One thing is like another only with reference to that in  virtue of which it is such and such; thus this forms the peculiar mark  of quality.    We must not be disturbed because it may be argued that, though  proposing to discuss the category of quality, we have included in it  many relative terms. We did say that habits and dispositions were  relative. In practically all such cases the genus is relative, the  individual not. Thus knowledge, as a genus, is explained by reference  to something else, for we mean a knowledge of something. But particular  branches of knowledge are not thus explained. The knowledge of grammar  is not relative to anything external, nor is the knowledge of music,  but these, if relative at all, are relative only in virtue of their  genera; thus grammar is said be the knowledge of something, not the  grammar of something; similarly music is the knowledge of something,  not the music of something.    Thus individual branches of knowledge are not relative. And it is  because we possess these individual branches of knowledge that we are  said to be such and such. It is these that we actually possess: we are  called experts because we possess knowledge in some particular branch.  Those particular branches, therefore, of knowledge, in virtue of which  we are sometimes said to be such and such, are themselves qualities,  and are not relative. Further, if anything should happen to fall within  both the category of quality and that of relation, there would be  nothing extraordinary in classing it under both these heads.        Section 3      Part 9    Action and affection both admit of contraries and also of variation of  degree. Heating is the contrary of cooling, being heated of being  cooled, being glad of being vexed. Thus they admit of contraries. They  also admit of variation of degree: for it is possible to heat in a  greater or less degree; also to be heated in a greater or less degree.  Thus action and affection also admit of variation of degree. So much,  then, is stated with regard to these categories.    We spoke, moreover, of the category of position when we were dealing  with that of relation, and stated that such terms derived their names  from those of the corresponding attitudes.    As for the rest, time, place, state, since they are easily  intelligible, I say no more about them than was said at the beginning,  that in the category of state are included such states as 'shod',  'armed', in that of place 'in the Lyceum' and so on, as was explained  before.        Part 10    The proposed categories have, then, been adequately dealt with. We must  next explain the various senses in which the term 'opposite' is used.  Things are said to be opposed in four senses: (i) as correlatives to  one another, (ii) as contraries to one another, (iii) as privatives to  positives, (iv) as affirmatives to negatives.    Let me sketch my meaning in outline. An instance of the use of the word  'opposite' with reference to correlatives is afforded by the  expressions 'double' and 'half'; with reference to contraries by 'bad'  and 'good'. Opposites in the sense of 'privatives' and 'positives' are  'blindness' and 'sight'; in the sense of affirmatives and negatives, the  propositions 'he sits', 'he does not sit'.    (i) Pairs of opposites which fall under the category of relation are  explained by a reference of the one to the other, the reference being"]]]
