[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20203"],[0,"Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin (#6)"],[1," I had caught it by reading my father's books of dispute  about religion. Persons of good sense, I have since observed, seldom  fall into it, except lawyers, university men, and men of all sorts  that have been bred at Edinborough.    A question was once, somehow or other, started between Collins and me,  of the propriety of educating the female sex in learning, and their  abilities for study. He was of opinion that it was improper, and that  they were naturally unequal to it. I took the contrary side, perhaps a  little for dispute's sake. He was naturally more eloquent, had a ready  plenty of words, and sometimes, as I thought, bore me down more by his  fluency than by the strength of his reasons. As we parted without  settling the point, and were not to see one another again for some  time, I sat down to put my arguments in writing, which I copied fair  and sent to him. He answered, and I replied. Three or four letters of  a side had passed, when my father happened to find my papers and read  them. Without entering into the discussion, he took occasion to talk  to me about the manner of my writing; observed that, though I had the  advantage of my antagonist in correct spelling and pointing (which I  ow'd to the printing-house), I fell far short in elegance of  expression, in method and in perspicuity, of which he convinced me by  several instances. I saw the justice of his remarks, and thence grew  more attentive to the manner in writing, and determined to endeavor at  improvement.    About this time I met with an odd volume of the _Spectator_.[18] It was  the third. I had never before seen any of them. I bought it, read it  over and over, and was much delighted with it. I thought the writing  excellent, and wished, if possible, to imitate it. With this view I  took some of the papers, and, making short hints of the sentiment in  each sentence, laid them by a few days, and then, without looking at  the book, try'd to compleat the papers again, by expressing each  hinted sentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressed  before, in any suitable words that should come to hand. Then I  compared my _Spectator_ with the original, discovered some of my  faults, and corrected them. But I found I wanted a stock of words, or  a readiness in recollecting and using them, which I thought I should  have acquired before that time if I had gone on making verses; since  the continual occasion for words of the same import, but of different  length, to suit the measure, or of different sound for the rhyme,  would have laid me under a constant necessity of searching for  variety, and also have tended to fix that variety in my mind, and make  me master of it. Therefore I took some of the tales and turned them  into verse; and, after a time, when I had pretty well forgotten the  prose, turned them back again. I also sometimes jumbled my collections  of hints into confusion, and after some weeks endeavored to reduce  them into the best order, before I began to form the full sentences  and compleat the paper. This was to teach me method in the arrangement  of thoughts. By comparing my work afterwards with the original, I  discovered many faults and amended them; but I sometimes had the  pleasure of fancying that, in certain particulars of small import, I  had been lucky enough to improve the method of the language, and this  encouraged me to think I might possibly in time come to be a tolerable  English writer, of which I was extremely ambitious. My time for these  exercises and for reading was at night, after work or before it began  in the morning, or on Sundays, when I contrived to be in the  printing-house alone, evading as much as I could the common attendance  on public worship which my father used to exact of me when I was under  his care, and which indeed I still thought a duty, thought I could  not, as it seemed to me, afford time to practise it.        [18] A daily London journal, comprising satirical essays      on social subjects, published by Addison and Steele in      1711-1712. The _Spectator_ and its predecessor, the      _Tatler_ (1709), marked the beginning of periodical      literature.    When about 16 years of age I happened to meet with a book, written by  one Tryon, recommending a vegetable diet. I determined to go into it.  My brother, being yet unmarried, did not keep house, but boarded  himself and his apprentices in another family. My refusing to eat  flesh occasioned an inconveniency, and I was frequently chid for my  singularity. I made myself acquainted with Tryon's manner of preparing  some of his dishes, such as boiling potatoes or rice, making hasty  pudding, and a few others, and then proposed to my brother, that if he  would give me, weekly, half the money he paid for my board, I would  board myself. He instantly agreed to it, and I presently found that I  could save half what he paid me. This was an additional fund for  buying books. But I had another advantage in it. My brother and the  rest going from the printing-house to their meals, I remained there  alone, and, dispatching presently my light repast, which often was no  more than a bisket or a slice of bread, a handful of raisins or a tart  from the pastry-cook's, and a glass of water, had the rest of the time  till their return for study, in which I made the greater progress,  from that greater clearness of head and quicker apprehension which  usually attend temperance in eating and drinking.    And now it was that, being on some occasion made asham'd of my  ignorance in figures, which I had twice failed in learning when at  school, I took Cocker's book of Arithmetick, and went through the  whole by myself with great ease. I also read Seller's and Shermy's  books of Navigation, and became acquainted with the little geometry  they contain; but never proceeded far in that science. And I read  about this time Locke _On Human Understanding_,[19] and the _Art of  Thinking_, by Messrs. du Port Royal.[20]        [19] John Locke (1632-1704), a celebrated English      philosopher, founder of the so-called \"common-sense\"      school of philosophers. He drew up a constitution for      the colonists of Carolina.        [20] A noted society of scholarly and devout men      occupying the abbey of Port Royal near Paris, who      published learned works, among them the one here      referred to, better known as the _Port Royal Logic_.    While I was intent on improving my language, I met with an English  grammar (I think it was Greenwood's), at the end of which there were  two little sketches of the arts of rhetoric and logic, the latter  finishing with a specimen of a dispute in the Socratic[21] method; and  soon after I procur'd Xenophon's Memorable Things of Socrates, wherein  there are many instances of the same method. I was charm'd with it,  adopted it, dropt my abrupt contradiction and positive argumentation,  and put on the humble inquirer and doubter. And being then, from  reading Shaftesbury and Collins, become a real doubter in many points  of our religious doctrine, I found this method safest for myself and  very embarrassing to those against whom I used it; therefore I took a  delight in it, practis'd it continually, and grew very artful and  expert in drawing people, even of superior knowledge, into  concessions, the consequences of which they did not foresee,  entangling them in difficulties out of which they could not extricate  themselves, and so obtaining victories that neither myself nor my  cause always deserved. I continu'd this method some few years, but  gradually left it, retaining only the habit of expressing myself in  terms of modest diffidence; never using, when I advanced anything that  may possibly be disputed, the words _certainly_, _undoubtedly_, or any  others that give the air of positiveness to an opinion; but rather  say, I conceive or apprehend a thing to be so and so; it appears to  me, or _I should think it so or so_, for such and such reasons; or _I  imagine it to be so_; or _it is so, if I am not mistaken_. This habit,  I believe, has been of great advantage to me when I have had occasion  to inculcate my opinions, and persuade men into measures that I have  been from time to time engaged in promoting; and, as the chief ends of  conversation are to _inform_ or to be _informed_, to _please_ or to  _persuade_, I wish well-meaning, sensible men would not lessen their  power of doing good by a positive, assuming manner, that seldom fails  to disgust, tends to create opposition, and to defeat everyone of  those purposes for which speech was given to us, to wit, giving or  receiving information or pleasure. For, if you would inform, a  positive and dogmatical manner in advancing your sentiments may  provoke contradiction and prevent a candid attention. If you wish  information and improvement from the knowledge of others, and yet at  the same time express yourself as firmly fix'd in your present  opinions, modest, sensible men, who do not love disputation, will  probably leave you undisturbed in the possession of your error. And by  such a manner, you can seldom hope to recommend yourself in _pleasing_  your hearers, or to persuade those whose concurrence you desire.  Pope[22] says, judiciously:      _\"Men should be taught as if you taught them not,     And things unknown propos'd as things forgot;\"_    farther recommending to us      \"To speak, tho' sure, with seeming diffidence.\"    And he might have coupled with this line that  which he has coupled with another, I think,  less properly,      \"For want of modesty is want of sense.\"    If you ask, Why less properly? I must repeat the lines,      \"Immodest words admit of no defense,     For want of modesty is want of sense.\"    Now, is not _want of sense_ (where a man is so unfortunate as to want  it) some apology for his _want of modesty_? and would not the lines  stand more justly thus?      \"Immodest words admit _but_ this defense,     That want of modesty"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20220"],[0,"The Mind and Its Education (#6)"],[1,"and easily allows us to  measure the rhythm for this particular sensation.      4. POINTS OF FAILURE IN ATTENTION    LACK OF CONCENTRATION.--There are two chief types of inattention whose  danger threatens every person. _First_, we may be thinking about the  right things, but not thinking _hard_ enough. We lack mental pressure.  Outside thoughts which have no relation to the subject in hand may not  trouble us much, but we do not attack our problem with vim. The current  in our stream of consciousness is moving too slowly. We do not gather up  all our mental forces and mass them on the subject before us in a way  that means victory. Our thoughts may be sufficiently focused, but they  fail to \"set fire.\" It is like focusing the sun's rays while an eclipse  is on. They lack energy. They will not kindle the paper after they have  passed through the lens. This kind of attention means mental dawdling.  It means inefficiency. For the individual it means defeat in life's  battles; for the nation it means mediocrity and stagnation.    A college professor said to his faithful but poorly prepared class,  \"Judging from your worn and tired appearance, young people, you are  putting in twice too many hours on study.\" At this commendation the  class brightened up visibly. \"But,\" he continued, \"judging from your  preparation, you do not study quite half hard enough.\"    Happy is the student who, starting in on his lesson rested and fresh,  can study with such concentration that an hour of steady application  will leave him mentally exhausted and limp. That is one hour of triumph  for him, no matter what else he may have accomplished or failed to  accomplish during the time. He can afford an occasional pause for rest,  for difficulties will melt rapidly away before him. He possesses one key  to successful achievement.    MENTAL WANDERING.--_Second_, we may have good mental power and be able  to think hard and efficiently on any one point, but lack the power to  think in a straight line. Every stray thought that comes along is a  \"will-o'-the-wisp\" to lead us away from the subject in hand and into  lines of thought not relating to it. Who has not started in to think on  some problem, and, after a few moments, been surprised to find himself  miles away from the topic upon which he started! Or who has not read  down a page and, turning to the next, found that he did not know a word  on the preceding page, his thoughts having wandered away, his eyes only  going through the process of reading! Instead of sticking to the _a_,  _b_, _c_, _d_, etc., of our topic and relating them all up to A, thereby  reaching a solution of the problem, we often jump at once to _x_, _y_,  _z_, and find ourselves far afield with all possibility of a solution  gone. We may have brilliant thoughts about _x_, _y_, _z_, but they are  not related to anything in particular, and so they pass from us and are  gone--lost in oblivion because they are not attached to something  permanent.    Such a thinker is at the mercy of circumstances, following blindly the  leadings of trains of thought which are his master instead of his  servant, and which lead him anywhere or nowhere without let or hindrance  from him. His consciousness moves rapidly enough and with enough force,  but it is like a ship without a helm. Starting for the intellectual port  _A_ by way of _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, he is mentally shipwrecked at last on  the rocks _x_, _y_, _z_, and never reaches harbor. Fortunate is he who  can shut out intruding thoughts and think in a straight line. Even with  mediocre ability he may accomplish more by his thinking than the  brilliant thinker who is constantly having his mental train wrecked by  stray thoughts which slip in on his right of way.      5. TYPES OF ATTENTION    THE THREE TYPES OF ATTENTION.--Attention may be secured in three ways:  (1) It is demanded by some sudden or intense sensory stimulus or  insistent idea, or (2) it follows interest, or (3) it is compelled by  the will. If it comes in the first way, as from a thunderclap or a flash  of light, or from the persistent attempt of some unsought idea to secure  entrance into the mind, it is called _involuntary_ attention. This form  of attention is of so little importance, comparatively, in our mental  life that we shall not discuss it further.    If attention comes in the second way, following interest, it is called  _nonvoluntary_ or spontaneous attention; if in the third, compelled by  the will, _voluntary_ or active attention. Nonvoluntary attention has  its motive in some object external to consciousness, or else follows a  more or less uncontrolled current of thought which interests us;  voluntary attention is controlled from within--_we_ decide what we shall  attend to instead of letting interesting objects of thought determine it  for us.    INTEREST AND NONVOLUNTARY ATTENTION.--In nonvoluntary attention the  environment largely determines what we shall attend to. All that we have  to do with directing this kind of attention is in developing certain  lines of interest, and then the interesting things attract attention.  The things we see and hear and touch and taste and smell, the things we  like, the things we do and hope to do--these are the determining factors  in our mental life so long as we are giving nonvoluntary attention. Our  attention follows the beckoning of these things as the needle the  magnet. It is no effort to attend to them, but rather the effort would  be to keep from attending to them. Who does not remember reading a  story, perhaps a forbidden one, so interesting that when mother called  up the stairs for us to come down to attend to some duty, we replied,  \"Yes, in a minute,\" and then went on reading! We simply could not stop  at that place. The minute lengthens into ten, and another call startles  us. \"Yes, I'm coming;\" we turn just one more leaf, and are lost again.  At last comes a third call in tones so imperative that it cannot be  longer ignored, and we lay the book down, but open to the place where we  left off, and where we hope soon to begin further to unravel the  delightful mystery. Was it an effort to attend to the reading? Ah, no!  it took the combined force of our will and of mother's authority to  drag the attention away. This is nonvoluntary attention.    Left to itself, then, attention simply obeys natural laws and follows  the line of least resistance. By far the larger portion of our attention  is of this type. Thought often runs on hour after hour when we are not  conscious of effort or struggle to compel us to cease thinking about  this thing and begin thinking about that. Indeed, it may be doubted  whether this is not the case with some persons for days at a time,  instead of hours. The things that present themselves to the mind are the  things which occupy it; the character of the thought is determined by  the character of our interests. It is this fact which makes it vitally  necessary that our interests shall be broad and pure if our thoughts are  to be of this type. It is not enough that we have the strength to drive  from our minds a wrong or impure thought which seeks entrance. To stand  guard as a policeman over our thoughts to see that no unworthy one  enters, requires too much time and energy. Our interests must be of such  a nature as to lead us away from the field of unworthy thoughts if we  are to be free from their tyranny.    THE WILL AND VOLUNTARY ATTENTION.--In voluntary attention there is a  conflict either between the will and interest or between the will and  the mental inertia or laziness, which has to be overcome before we can  think with any degree of concentration. Interest says, \"Follow this  line, which is easy and attractive, or which requires but little  effort--follow the line of least resistance.\" Will says, \"Quit that line  of dalliance and ease, and take this harder way which I direct--cease  the line of least resistance and take the one of greatest resistance.\"  When day dreams and \"castles in Spain\" attempt to lure you from your  lessons, refuse to follow; shut out these vagabond thoughts and stick to  your task. When intellectual inertia deadens your thought and clogs your  mental stream, throw it off and court forceful effort. If wrong or  impure thoughts seek entrance to your mind, close and lock your mental  doors to them. If thoughts of desire try to drive out thoughts of duty,  be heroic and insist that thoughts of duty shall have right of way. In  short, see that _you_ are the master of your thinking, and do not let it  always be directed without your consent by influences outside of  yourself.    It is just at this point that the strong will wins victory and the weak  will breaks down. Between the ability to control one's thoughts and the  inability to control them lies all the difference between right actions  and wrong actions; between withstanding temptation and yielding to it;  between an inefficient purposeless life and a life of purpose and  endeavor; between success and failure. For we act in accordance with  those things which our thought rests upon. Suppose two lines of thought  represented by _A_ and _B_, respectively, lie before you; that _A_ leads  to a course of action difficult or unpleasant, but necessary to success  or duty, and that _B_ leads to a course of action easy or pleasant, but  fatal to success or duty. Which course will you follow--the rugged path  of duty or the easier one of pleasure? The answer depends almost wholly,  if not entirely, on your power of attention. If your will is strong  enough to pull your thoughts away from the fatal but attractive _B_ and  hold them resolutely on the less attractive _A_, then _A_ will dictate  your course of action, and you will respond to the call for endeavor,  self-denial, and duty; but if your thoughts break away from the  domination of your will and allow the beckoning of your interests  alone, then _B_ will dictate your course of "]]]
