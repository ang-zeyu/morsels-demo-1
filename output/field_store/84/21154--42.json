The nervous person is often morose and unsocial--perhaps because he is  not understood, perhaps because he falls so short of his own ideals.  Often he does not find kindred spirits anywhere. I do not think we  should drive such a man into conditions that hurt, but I do believe that  if he is truly artistic, and not a snob, he may lead himself into a  larger social life without too much sacrifice.    The sensitive, high-strung spirit that does not give of its own best  qualities to the world of its acquaintance, that does not express itself  in some concrete way, is always in danger of harm. Such a spirit turned  in upon itself is a consuming fire. The spirit will burn a long time and  suffer much if it does not use its heat to warm and comfort the world of  need.    Real illness makes the nervous temperament a much more formidable  difficulty--all the sensitive faculties are more sensitive--irritability  becomes an obsession and idleness a terror.    The nervous temperament under irritation is very prone to become  selfish--and very likely to hide behind this selfishness, calling it  temperament. The man who flies into a passion when he is disturbed, or  who spends his days in torment from the noises of the street; the woman  of high attainment who has retired into herself, who is moody and  unresponsive,--these unfortunates have virtually built a wall about  their lives, a wall which shuts out the world of life and happiness.  From the walls of this prison the sounds of discord and annoyance are  thrown back upon the prisoner intensified and multiplied. The wall is  real enough in its effect, but will cease to exist when the prisoner  begins to go outside, when he begins to realize his selfishness and his  mistake. Then the noises and the irritations will be lost in the wider  world that is open to him. After all, it is only through unselfish  service in the world of men that this broadening can come.    There is no lack of opportunity for service. Perhaps the simplest and  most available form of service is charity,--the big, professional kind,  of course,--and beyond that the greater field of intimate and personal  charity. I know a girl of talent and ability--herself a nervous  invalid--sick and helpless for the lack of a little money which would  give her a chance to get well. I do not mean money for luxuries, for  foolish indulgences, but money to buy opportunity--money that would lift  her out of the heavy morass of poverty and give her a chance. She falls  outside the beaten path of charity. She is not reached by the usual  philanthropies. I also know plenty of people who could help that girl  without great sacrifice. They will not do it because they give money to  the regular charities--they will not do it because sometimes generosity  has been abused. So they miss the chance of broadening and developing  their own lives.    I know well enough that objective interest can rarely be forced--it  must usually come the other way about--through the broadening of life  which makes it inevitable. Sometimes I wish I could force that kind of  development, that kind of charity. Sometimes I long to take the rich  neurasthenic and make him help his brother, make him develop a new art  that shall save people from sorrow and loss. We are all together in this  world, and all kin; to recognize it and to serve the needs of the  unfortunate as we would serve our own children is the remedy for many  ills. It is the new art, the final and greatest of all artistic  achievements; it warms our hearts and opens our lives to all that is  wholesome and good. This is one of the crises in which my theory of  \"inspiration first\" may fail. Here the charity may have to come first,  may have to be insisted upon before there can be any inspiration or any  further joy in life. It is not always charity in the usual sense that is  required; sometimes the charity that gives something besides money is  best. But charity in any good sense means self-forgetfulness, and that  is a long way on the road to nervous health. Give of yourself, give of  your substance, and you will cease to be troubled with the penalties of  selfishness. Then take the next step--that gives not because life has  come back, but because the world has become larger and warmer and  happier. When the giver gives of his sympathy and of his means because  he wants to,--not because he has to do so,--he will begin to know what I  mean when I say it is better to have the inspiration first.          VII    SELF-CONTROL          He only earns his freedom and existence      Who daily conquers them anew.                  GOETHE.    A good many writers on self-control and kindred subjects insist that we  shall conscientiously and consciously govern our mental lives. They say,  \"You must get up in the morning with determination to be cheerful.\" They  insist that in spite of annoyance or trouble you shall keep a smiling  face, and affirm to yourself over and over again the denial of  annoyance.    I do not like this kind of self-control. I wish I could admire it and  approve it, but I find I cannot because it seems to me self-conscious  and superficial. It is better than nothing and unquestionably adds  greatly to the sum of human happiness. But I do not think we ought to be  cheerful if we are consumed with trouble and sorrow. The fact is we  ought not to be for long beyond a natural cheerfulness that comes from  the deepest possible sources. While we are sad, let us be so, simply and  naturally; but we must pray that the light may come to us in our sorrow,  that we may be able soon and naturally to put aside the signs of  mourning.    The person who thinks little of his own attitude of mind is more likely  to be well controlled and to radiate happiness than one who must  continually prompt himself to worthy thoughts. The man whose heart is  great with understanding of the sorrow and pathos of life is far more  apt to be brave and fine in his own trouble than one who must look to a  motto or a formula for consolation and advice. Deep in the lives of  those who permanently triumph over sorrow there is an abiding peace and  joy. Such peace cannot come even from ample experience in the material  world. Despair comes from that experience sometimes, unless the heart  is open to the vital spirit that lies beyond all material things, that  creates and renews life and that makes it indescribably beautiful and  significant. Experience of material things is only the beginning. In it  and through it we may have experience of the wider life that surrounds  the material.    Our hearts must be opened to the courage that comes unbidden when we  feel ourselves to be working, growing parts of the universe of God. Then  we shall have no more sorrow and no more joy in the pitiful sense of the  earth, but rather an exaltation which shall make us masters of these and  of ourselves. We shall have a sympathy and charity that shall need no  promptings, but that flow from us spontaneously into the world of  suffering and need.    Beethoven was of a sour temper, according to all accounts, but he wrote  his symphonies in the midst of tribulations under which few men would  have worked at all. When we have felt something of the spirit that makes  work inevitable, it will be as though we had heard the eternal harmonies.  We shall write our symphonies, build our bridges, or do our lesser tasks  with dauntless purpose, even though the possessions that men count dear  are taken from us. Suppose we can do very little because of some  infirmity: if that little has in it the larger inspiration, it will be  enough to make life full and fine. The joy of a wider life is not  obtainable in its completeness; it is only through a lifetime of service  and experience that we can approach it. That is the proof of its divine  origin--its unattainableness. \"God keep you from the she wolf and from  your heart's deepest desire,\" is an old saying of the Rumanians. If we  fully obtain our desires, we prove their unworthiness. Does any one  suppose that Beethoven attained his whole heart's desire in his music?  He might have done so had he been a lesser man. He was not a cheerful  companion. That is unfortunate, and shows that he failed in complete  inspiration and in the ordinary kind of self-control. He was at least  sincere, and that helped not a little to make him what he was. I would  almost rather a man would be morose and sincere than cheerful from a  sense of duty.    Our knowledge of the greater things of life must always be substantiated  and worked out into realities of service, or else we shall be weak and  ineffective. The charity that balks at giving, reacts upon a man and  deadens him. I am always insisting that we must not live and serve  through a sense of duty, but that we must find the inspiration first. It  is better to give ourselves to service not for the sake of finding God,  but because we have found Him and because our souls have grown in the  finding until we cannot help giving. If we have grown to such a stature  we shall be able to meet sorrow and loss bravely and simply. We shall  feel for ourselves and for others in their troubles as Forbes Robertson  did when he wrote to his friend who had met with a great loss: \"I pray  that you may never, never, never get over this sorrow, but through it,  into it, into the very heart of God.\" All this is very unworldly, no  doubt, and yet I will venture the assertion that such a standard and  such a method will come nearer to the mark of successful and  well-controlled living than the most carefully planned campaign of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22114"],[0,"A Plain Cookery Book for the Working Classes (#6)"],[1,"together, and put the  giblets into a pie-dish; cover this over with a dripping crust, and bake  it for about an hour and a quarter.      No. 63. A FISH PIE.    Cut up any kind of fish into pieces the size of an egg; season these  with chopped parsley, thyme, a little onion, pepper and salt, and put  them into a pie-dish, with a pint of water, well mixed with three  ounces of flour and a little mushroom ketchup; cover the pie with a  flour crust, or else with stiff mashed potatoes, and bake it for an hour  and a quarter.      No. 64. POTATO PIE.    Slice up four onions and boil them in a saucepan with two ounces of  butter, a quart of water, and pepper and salt, for five minutes; then  add four pounds of potatoes, peeled and cut in slices; stew the whole  until the potatoes are done, and pour them into a pie-dish; cover this  with stiff mashed potatoes, and bake the pie of a light brown colour.      No. 65. BACON ROLL-PUDDING.    Boil a pound of fat bacon for half an hour, and then cut it up into thin  slices. Peel six apples and one onion, and cut them in slices. Make two  pounds of flour into a stiff dough, roll it out thin; first lay the  slices of bacon out all over this, and then upon the slices of bacon  spread out the slices of apples and the slices of onion; roll up the  paste so as to secure the bacon, etc., in it; place the bolster pudding  in a cloth, tied at each end, and let it boil for two hours in a  two-gallon pot, with plenty of water.      No. 66. RABBIT PUDDING.    Skin and wash the rabbit, and cut it up in pieces; fry these brown with  a bit of butter, season with chopped onions, parsley, and winter savory,  pepper and salt, shake in a good spoonful of flour, moisten with a  little ketchup and a gill of water; toss the saucepan about on the fire  while the pieces of rabbit boil for about ten minutes, and then pour the  whole into a proper sized basin lined with a suet or dripping crust; let  the pudding be covered in with some of the paste, put into a  baking-dish half full of hot water, and placed in the oven, to bake for  an hour and a-half.      No. 67. STEWED OX KIDNEY.    Cut up the kidney in thin slices, fry them brown with a bit of butter or  fat in a frying-pan, over a brisk fire, season with chopped parsley,  shalot, pepper and salt, shake in a good table-spoonful of flour, add a  few drops of vinegar, and nearly half a pint of water; stir the whole on  the fire, while it boils, very gently, for a quarter of an hour; this,  with a dish of well-boiled or baked potatoes, will produce a cheap and  excellent dinner sufficient for six persons.      No. 68. BAKED BULLOCK'S HEART.    Wash and wipe the heart, cut it into four pieces, season these with  pepper and salt, chopped thyme, and bay-leaves, add about two ounces of  dripping, eight onions cut in slices, and four parsnips cut also in  slices; let all this be placed in an earthen pot, with a pint of water,  and the lid being put on, set the stew in the oven to bake for two  hours.      No. 69. BULLOCK'S HEART STUFFED.    Chop fine four onions and twelve sage-leaves; put these into a saucepan  with a bit of fat or butter, and fry them for a few minutes on the fire;  then add eight ounces of crumb of bread, soaked in milk or water, pepper  and salt; stir this stuffing on the fire for a few minutes, add one egg,  put the stuffing inside the bullock's heart, place a round of greased  paper on the stuffing, and fasten it on with four wooden twigs. Next,  put the stuffed heart upon an iron trivet in a baking dish, containing  peeled potatoes, two ounces of dripping or butter, and half a pint of  water; season well with pepper and salt, and while baking let the heart  be frequently basted with the fat from the dish. In case you have no  oven, send it to the baker's.      No. 70. STEWED SHEEP'S TROTTERS.    Sheep's trotters are sold ready cleaned and very cheap at all tripe  shops. When about to cook them, by way of a treat, for supper, or  otherwise, let them be put on in two quarts of water and milk, seasoned  with peppercorns, salt, a good sprig of thyme, and a wine-glassful of  vinegar, and set them to boil very gently on the fire for three hours,  at least. When the trotters are done quite tender, skim off all the  grease, and boil down the liquor to a pint; then add two ounces of  flour, mixed with a gill of milk, some chopped parsley, and one ounce of  butter; stir all together while boiling on the fire for ten minutes, and  pour out into the dish.      No. 71. BAKED SHEEP'S HEADS.    Buy a couple of sheep's heads, get the butcher to split them for you,  place them in an earthen baking-dish, with two ounces of dripping, some  chopped shalots, thyme, bay-leaf, winter savory, pepper and salt, and a  good pinch of allspice; moisten with a quart of cider, or water, strew a  coating of bread-raspings all over the surface of the heads, and bake  them for two hours.      No. 72. SHEEP'S PLUCK.    A sheep's pluck, properly cooked, will furnish a meat dinner enough for  twelve persons, at a very moderate cost. Cut the whole of the pluck,  consisting of the heart, liver, lights, etc., into rather thick slices,  and season them well with pepper, salt, allspice, thyme, and winter  savory; grease the bottom of a baking-dish with two ounces of dripping,  lay a bed of slices of onions upon this, and then place the slices of  pluck, already seasoned, upon the onions; moisten with water enough to  reach half-way up the meat, strew a thick coating of bread-raspings all  over the top, and bake the savoury mess for an hour and a-half.      No. 73. BELGIAN FAGGOTS.    These may be prepared with sheep's pluck, or even with bullock's liver,  and other similar parts of meat; but a pig's pluck is preferable for the  purpose. Chop up the heart, liver, lights, and the fat crow; season well  with pepper, salt, allspice, thyme, sage, and shalots, and divide this  sausage-meat into balls the size of an apple, which must be each secured  in shape with a piece of pig's caul fastened with a wooden twig, or  skewer, and placed in rows in a tin baking-dish, to be baked for about  half an hour in a brisk oven. When the faggots are done, place them on  some well-boiled cabbages, chopped up, in an earthen dish, and having  poured the grease from the faggots over all, set them in the oven to  stew gently for half an hour.      No. 74. FRIED STEAKS AND ONIONS.    Season the steaks with pepper and salt, and when done brown on both  sides, without being overdone, place them in a dish before the fire  while you fry some sliced onions in the fat which remains in the pan; as  soon as the onions are done, and laid upon the steaks, shake a spoonful  of flour in the pan, add a gill of water and a few drops of vinegar;  give this gravy a boil up on the fire, and pour it over the steaks, etc.      No. 75. STEWED STEAKS.    Fry the steaks brown over a very brisk fire, without allowing them to be  hardly half done, and place them in a saucepan with onions, carrots,  turnips, and celery, all cut in pieces about the size of a pigeon's egg;  season with thyme, pepper, and salt, and two ounces of flour; moisten  with a quart of water, and stir the stew on the fire till it boils, and  then set it by the side of the fire on the hob, to simmer very gently  for an hour and a-half. It will then be ready for dinner.      No. 76. STEWED SAUSAGES.    First, prick your sausages well all over with a fork, and soak them in  very hot water, for two or three minutes, to swell them out; next, roll  them in flour, and fry them brown without overdoing them, as that  renders them dry, and spoils them. When the sausages are done and put on  a plate, fry some slices of bread, and put these on a dish; then put the  sausages on the fried bread, and shake a spoonful of flour in the pan;  add a pennyworth of chopped mixed pickles, a gill of water, and a little  pepper and salt; give this gravy a boil up, and pour it over the  sausages.      No. 77. PIG'S FRY.    A pig's fry consists of the heart, liver, lights, and some of the  chitterlings; these are to be first cut up in slices, then seasoned with  pepper and salt, rolled in a little flour, and fried with some kind of  grease in the frying-pan. As the pieces are fried, place them on their  dish to keep hot before the fire, and when all is done, throw some  chopped onions and sage leaves into the pan, to be fried of a light  colour; add a very little flour, pepper, and salt, a gill of water, and  a few drops of vinegar; boil up this gravy, and pour it over the pig's  fry.      No. 78. BEEFSTEAKS, PLAIN.    When you happen to have a clear fire, the steaks may be cooked on a  gridiron over the fire; the steaks must be turned on the gridiron every  two or three minutes. This precaution assists very much in rendering the  meat more palatable and tender, as it is by this frequent turning over  of the meat while broiling, that the juices are not allowed to run off  in waste, but are re-absorbed by the meat. When the steaks are cooked,  rub them over with a small bit of butter, season with pepper and salt. A  little chopped shalot sprinkled over steaks, imparts an extra relish.      No. 79. MUTTON CHOPS, OR STEAKS.    Mutton chops, properly speaking, are an expensive affair; but what I  recommend you to buy is, the chump end of the loin of mutton, which is  always to be had much cheaper. This weighs about one pound, at 6_d._,  and would cut into about three, or perhaps four steaks or chops; let  these be broiled in the same manner as recommended for beefsteaks.      No. 80. KIDNEY PUDDING.    Prepare an ox kidney as shown in No. 67, and use this to fill a good  sized pudding basin, which you shall have previously lined with a  dripping or suet crust; cover the meat in by placing a rolled-out piece  of the paste on the top, fasten it by pressing the two edges of the  paste together, tie the pudding up in a cloth, and take care to place  the bottom of the pudding-bas"]]]
