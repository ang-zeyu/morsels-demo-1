It is,  however, a well-known fact, that the dairies of London are stocked  chiefly with short horns and Yorkshires, or high grades between them,  which, after being milked as long as profitable, feed equal, or nearly  so, to pure-bred short horns. It has been said, by very good authority,  that the short horns improve every breed with which they cross.    The desirable characteristics of the short horn bull may be summed up,  according to the judgment of the best breeders, as follows: He should  have a short but fine head, very broad across the eyes, tapering to the  nose, with a nostril full and prominent; the nose itself should be of a  rich flesh color; eyes bright and mild; ears somewhat large and thin;  horns slightly covered and rather flat, well set on; a long, broad,  muscular neck; chest wide, deep, and projecting; shoulders fine,  oblique, well formed into the chine; fore legs short, with upper arm  large and powerful; barrel round, deep, well-ribbed horns; hips wide and  level; back straight from the withers to the setting on of the tail, but  short from hips to chine; skin soft and velvety to the touch; moderately  thick hair, plentiful, soft, and mossy. The cow has the same points in  the main, but her head is finer, longer, and more tapering; neck thinner  and lighter, and shoulders more narrow across the chine.    The astonishing precocity of the short horns, their remarkable aptitude  to fatten, the perfection of their forms, and the fineness of their bony  structure, give them an advantage over most other races when the object  of breeding is for the shambles. No animal of any other breed can so  rapidly transform the stock of any section around him as the improved  short horn bull.    It does not, however, follow that the high-bred short horns are  unexceptionable, even for beef. The very exaggeration, so to speak, of  the qualities which make them so valuable for the improvement of other  and less perfect races, may become a fault when wanted for the table.  The very rapidity with which they increase in size is thought by some  to prevent their meat from ripening up sufficiently before being hurried  off to the butcher. The disproportion of the fatty to the muscular  flesh, found in this to a greater extent than in races coming more  slowly to maturity, makes the meat of the thorough-bred short horn, in  the estimation of some, less agreeable to the taste, and less profitable  to the consumer; since the nitrogenous compounds, true sources of  nutriment, are found in less quantity than in the meat of animals not so  highly bred.    In sections where the climate is moist, and the food abundant and rich,  some families of the short horns may be valuable for the dairy; but they  are most frequently bred exclusively for beef in this country, and in  sections where they have attained the highest perfection of form and  beauty, so little is thought of their milking qualities that they are  often not milked at all, the calf being allowed to run with the dam.      THE DUTCH.    This short horned race, in the opinion of many--as has been previously  remarked--contributed largely, about a century ago, to build up the  Durham or Teeswater stock. It has been bred with special reference to  dairy qualities, and is eminently adapted to supply the wants of the  dairy farmer. The cows of North Holland not only give a large quantity,  but also a very good quality, so that a yield of sixteen to twenty-five  quarts, wine measure, at every milking, is not rare.    The principles upon which the inhabitants of Holland practise, in  selecting a cow from which to breed, are as follows: She should have,  they say, considerable size--not less than four and a half or five feet  girth, with a length of body corresponding; legs proportionally short; a  finely formed head, with a forehead or face somewhat concave; clear,  large, mild and sparkling eyes, yet with no expression of wildness;  tolerably large and stout ears, standing out from the head; fine, well  curved horns; a rather short, than long, thick, broad neck, well set  against the chest and withers; the front part of the breast and  shoulders must be broad and fleshy; the low-hanging dewlap must be soft  to the touch; the back and loins must be properly projected, somewhat  broad, the bones not too sharp, but well covered with flesh; the animal  should have long curved ribs, which form a broad breast bone; the body  must be round and deep, but not sunken into a hanging belly; the rump  must not be uneven, the hip-bones should not stand out too broad and  spreading, but all the parts should be level and well filled up; a fine  tail, set moderately high up and tolerably long, but slender, with a  thick, bushy tuft of hair at the end, hanging down below the hocks; the  legs must be short and low, but strong in the bony structure; the knees  broad, with flexible joints; the muscles and sinews must be firm and  sound, the hoofs broad and flat, and the position of the legs natural,  not too close and crowded; the hide, covered with fine glossy hair, must  be soft and mellow to the touch, and set loose upon the body. A large,  rather long, white and loose udder, extending well back, with four long  teats, serves also as a characteristic mark of a good milch cow. Large  and prominent milk-veins must extend from the navel back to the udder;  the belly of a good milch cow should not be too deep and hanging. The  color of the North Dutch cattle is mostly variegated. Cows with only one  color are no favorites. Red or black variegated, gray and blue  variegated, roan, spotted and white variegated cows, are especially  liked.      THE HEREFORD.    These cattle derive their name from a county in the western part of  England. Their general characteristics are a white face, sometimes  mottled; white throat, the white generally extending back on the neck,  and sometimes, though rarely, still further along on the back. The color  of the rest of the body is red, generally dark, but sometimes light.  Eighty years ago the best Hereford cattle were mottled or roan all over;  and some of the best herds, down to a comparatively recent period, were  either all mottled, or had the mottled or speckled face.    The expression of the face is mild and lively; the forehead open, broad,  and large; the eyes bright and full of vivacity; the horns glossy,  slender and spreading; the head small, though larger than, and not quite  so clear as, that of the Devons; the lower jaw fine; neck long and  slender; chest deep; breast-bone large, prominent, and very muscular;  the shoulder-blade light; shoulder full and soft; brisket and loins  large; hips well developed, and on a level with the chine; hind quarters  long and well filled in; buttocks on a level with the back, neither  falling off nor raised above the hind quarters; tail slender, well set  on; hair fine and soft; body round and full; carcass deep and well  formed, or cylindrical; bone small; thigh short and well made; legs  short and straight, and slender below the knee; as handlers very  excellent, especially mellow to the touch on the back, the shoulder, and  along the sides, the skin being soft, flexible, of medium thickness,  rolling on the neck and the hips; hair bright; face almost bare, which  is characteristic of pure Herefords.    They belong to the middle horned division of the cattle of Great  Britain, to which they are indigenous, and have been improved within the  last century by careful selections.    Hereford oxen are excellent animals, less active but stronger than the  Devons, and very free and docile. The demand for Herefords for beef  prevents their being much used for work in their native county, and the  farmers there generally use horses instead of oxen.    It is generally conceded that the qualities in which Herefords stand  pre-eminent among the middle-sized breeds are in the production of oxen  and their superiority of flesh. On these points there is little chance  of their being excelled. It should, however, be borne in mind that the  best oxen are not produced from the largest cows; nor is a superior  quality of flesh, such as is considered very soft to the touch, with  thin skin. It is the union of these two qualities which often  characterizes the short horns; but Hereford breeders--as a recent writer  remarks--should endeavor to maintain a higher standard of  excellence--that for which the best of the breed have always been  esteemed--a moderately thick, mellow hide, with a well apportioned  combination of softness with elasticity. A sufficiency of hair is also  desirable, and if accompanied with a disposition to curl moderately, it  is more in esteem; but that which has a harsh and wiry feel is  objectionable.    In point of symmetry and beauty of form, the well bred Herefords may be  classed with the improved short horns, though they arrive somewhat more  slowly at maturity, and never attain such weight. Like the improved  short horns, they are chiefly bred for beef, and their beef is of the  best quality in the English markets, commanding the highest price of  any, except perhaps, the West Highlanders. The short horn produces more  beef at the same age than the Hereford, but consumes more food in  proportion.    The Herefords are far less generally spread over England than the  improved short horns. They have seldom been bred for milk, as some  families of the latter have; and it is not very unusual to find  pure-bred cows incapable of supplying milk sufficient to nourish their  calves. They have been imported to this country to some extent, and  several fine herds exist in different sections; the earliest  importations being those of Henry Clay, of Kentucky, in 1817.    The want of care and attention to the udder, soon after calving,  especially if the cow be on luxuriant grass, often injures her milking  properties exceedingly. The practice in the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22775"],[0,"Psychotherapy (#6)"],[1,"the other fades away, why this  impression stands out with clearness as an attended object while the  other lacks vividness and disappears, why this volition grows out of  that emotion, why this feeling leads to this imaginative thought.    The first step towards such explanation is, of course, in psychology, as  in all other sciences, the careful observation of regularities. It  quickly leads us to formulate some general laws. Psychology has known,  for instance, for two thousand years, that if we have perceived two  things together, and later we see the one again, the new perception  brings us a memory image of the other thing. If we saw a man's face and  heard at the same time his name, seeing his face may later awaken in us  the memory of his name, or the hearing of his name may later awaken in  us a reproduced memory image of his face. On such a basis, for instance,  we formulate some general laws of association of ideas, and as soon as  we have such laws laid down, we consider the appearance of such a memory  image by association as sufficiently explained. We feel that it gives us  sufficient basis to predict that in the future this idea will stir up in  us the other idea. Psychology has formulated plenty of such general  statements, and they serve well for a first orientation.    Yet can this ever be considered as a last word of scientific explanation  of psychical facts? Can psychology really in this way reach an ideal  similar to that of scientific astronomy or chemistry? Would the  scientist of nature ever be satisfied with this kind of explanation,  which is nothing but generalization of certain sequences? Does not the  explanation of the naturalist contain an entirely different element? He  does not merely want to say that this effect has sometimes been observed  and that there is thus probability that it will come again, when similar  causes are given. No, the physicist wants to understand those  connections of cause and effect as necessary ones. He tries to find  sequences which cannot be otherwise because they cannot be thought in  any other way. Therefore he is not satisfied with complex regularities,  but analyzes them until he can bring them down to simple physical  connections, and these physical connections finally to mechanical  processes, which realize for us logical necessities. That matter lasts  and cannot disappear is such a presupposition, which comes to us with  the necessity of logical thinking. We simply cannot think it otherwise.  And the whole idea of natural science is to conceive the physical  universe in such a way that all changes in the outer world can be  understood as the movements of its parts in accordance with such  necessary physical axioms. If we knew all the atoms of the present  status of the universe, and we knew every present movement of every  atom, we should be able to foresee the position of every atom in the  next moment and in the following moment and in all following moments,  and all that by the necessary continuation of the substance and its  energies. That alone is the background of all special physical inquiry,  and we rely on the special laws of physics and chemistry, because we  trust that this universe, as a whole, could be ultimately understood as  such a system of necessary changes in the positions of the lasting  atoms.    For the psychologist there is no hope of finding such necessity in the  mental processes. The point is not that psychology is to-day too far  removed from the fulfillment of such an ideal, the point is rather that  such an ideal would be meaningless for the psychologist. His materials,  the psychical contents of consciousness, are by their nature unfit to  enter into such necessary connections; they cannot do it because they  cannot last. The physical object, we saw, is the object which is common  property, which we all feel in common, which must thus exist for all  time. The things in nature may burn down or decay, but no atom of them  can ever disappear from the universe, each must enter into new and ever  new combinations and last through all changes. The psychical thing, on  the other hand, can exist only for the one immediate experience. Every  sensation which enters into my ideas or volitions or emotions is a new  creation of the instant which cannot last; each one flashes up and is  lost with the moment's experience. My will to-day may have the same aim  as my will of yesterday, but as psychical object, my will to-day is a  new will, is a new creation in every pulse beat of my life. I must will  it again, I cannot store it up. And my joy of to-day can never be as  psychical fact the same joy which I may have to-morrow. Mental objects  as such, as psychological material, are not destined to last. It has no  meaning whatever to think of their being kept over until another time.  It is a coarse materialism to conceive the mental contents like pebbles  which may remain on the road from one day to another. Our ideas and  feelings are mental appearances which have their existence in the act of  the one experience; each new experience must be an entirely new  creation.    If I remember my last year's perception, I do not dig it out from an  under-mind, in which it was stored up and buried, but I create an  entirely new memory picture, just as I may make to-day a speech which  says the same thing which I said last year, and yet my action of  speaking is not last year's speech movement. It is a new action, and the  movement did not lie over somewhere during the interval. Mental life is  produced anew in every moment. When the first experience is gone and the  second comes, nothing of the stuff from which the first was made still  has existence in the content of consciousness. By this fact it becomes  entirely impossible ever to conceive necessary connections in the sense  of physical necessity in the world of consciousness. The one idea may  bring to me another idea by association, but as long as I consider both  strictly as mental facts, I can never understand why this association  happens, I can never grasp the real mechanism of the connection, I can  never see necessity between the disappearance of the one and the  appearance of the other. It remains a mystery which does not justify any  expectation that the same sequence will result again. Whatever belongs  to the psychical world can never be linked by a real insight into  necessity. Causality there remains an empty name without promise of a  real explanation.    Only when we have recognized this fundamental difficulty in the efforts  for psychological explanation, can we understand the way which modern  psychology has taken most successfully. The end of this way is simply  this: every psychical fact is to be thought of as an accompaniment of a  physical process and the necessary connections of these physical  processes determine, then, the connections of the mental facts. Indeed  this has become the method of modern psychology. It has brought about  the intimate relation between psychology and the physiology of the  brain, and has given us, as foundation, the theory of psychophysical  parallelism; the theory that there is no psychical process without a  parallel brain process. But the real center of the theory lies indeed in  the fact which we discussed; it lies in the fact that we cannot have any  explanation of mental states as such at all, if we do not link them with  physical processes.    Is it necessary to express again the assurance that such statements of a  parallelism between mind and brain in no way interfere with an  idealistic view of inner life? Have we not seen clearly enough that  these mental facts which are conceived parallel to physiological brain  processes do not represent the immediate reality of our inner life, that  our life reality is purposive and as such outside of all causal  explanation, and that we have to take a special, almost artificial,  point of view to consider inner life at all as objects, as contents of  consciousness, and thus as psychological material? But since we have  seen that for certain purposes such a point of view is necessary, as  soon as we have taken it we must be consistent. Our inner life in its  purposive reality has therefore nothing to do with brain processes, but  if we are on the psychological track and consider man as a system of  psychological phenomena, then to be sure, we must see that our only  possible interest lies in the finding of necessary causal connections.  But these cannot be found otherwise than by linking the mental facts  with the physical ones, the psychological material with the processes of  the brain.    Of course, that mental experience stands in intimate relations to the  body is a knowledge which does not wait for such philosophical  arguments. That mind and body come in contact is a conviction which goes  with every single sense perception. I see and hear because light and  sound stimulate my sense organs, and the sense organs stimulate my  brain. The explanation of perception through causes in the physical  system seems the more natural as it is evident that in such cases there  are no psychical causes which might have brought forward the perception.  If I suddenly hear bells ringing, there was on the mental side nothing  preceding which could be responsible for my sound perception. And the  same holds true if the physical source lies in my own body, if perhaps  my tooth begins to ache, although no expectation preceded it.    In the same way it seems a matter of course that mind and body are  connected wherever an action is performed. I have the will to grasp for  the book before me, and obediently my arm performs the movement; the  muscles contract themselves, the whole physical apparatus comes into  motion through the preceding mental fact. The same holds true where no  special will act arouses the muscles. If a thought is in my mind and it  discharges itself in appropriate words, those "]]]
