The day, though bright,  was not hot; and the appearance of the country, if I had not seen the  Peak, would have been wholly new.  We went upon a surface so hard and  level, that we had little care to hold the bridle, and were therefore at  full leisure for contemplation.  On the left were high and steep rocks  shaded with birch, the hardy native of the North, and covered with fern  or heath.  On the right the limpid waters of Lough Ness were beating  their bank, and waving their surface by a gentle agitation.  Beyond them  were rocks sometimes covered with verdure, and sometimes towering in  horrid nakedness.  Now and then we espied a little cornfield, which  served to impress more strongly the general barrenness.    Lough Ness is about twenty-four miles long, and from one mile to two  miles broad.  It is remarkable that Boethius, in his description of  Scotland, gives it twelve miles of breadth.  When historians or  geographers exhibit false accounts of places far distant, they may be  forgiven, because they can tell but what they are told; and that their  accounts exceed the truth may be justly supposed, because most men  exaggerate to others, if not to themselves: but Boethius lived at no  great distance; if he never saw the lake, he must have been very  incurious, and if he had seen it, his veracity yielded to very slight  temptations.    Lough Ness, though not twelve miles broad, is a very remarkable diffusion  of water without islands.  It fills a large hollow between two ridges of  high rocks, being supplied partly by the torrents which fall into it on  either side, and partly, as is supposed, by springs at the bottom.  Its  water is remarkably clear and pleasant, and is imagined by the natives to  be medicinal.  We were told, that it is in some places a hundred and  forty fathoms deep, a profundity scarcely credible, and which probably  those that relate it have never sounded.  Its fish are salmon, trout, and  pike.    It was said at fort Augustus, that Lough Ness is open in the hardest  winters, though a lake not far from it is covered with ice.  In  discussing these exceptions from the course of nature, the first question  is, whether the fact be justly stated.  That which is strange is  delightful, and a pleasing error is not willingly detected.  Accuracy of  narration is not very common, and there are few so rigidly philosophical,  as not to represent as perpetual, what is only frequent, or as constant,  what is really casual.  If it be true that Lough Ness never freezes, it  is either sheltered by its high banks from the cold blasts, and exposed  only to those winds which have more power to agitate than congeal; or it  is kept in perpetual motion by the rush of streams from the rocks that  inclose it.  Its profundity though it should be such as is represented  can have little part in this exemption; for though deep wells are not  frozen, because their water is secluded from the external air, yet where  a wide surface is exposed to the full influence of a freezing atmosphere,  I know not why the depth should keep it open.  Natural philosophy is now  one of the favourite studies of the Scottish nation, and Lough Ness well  deserves to be diligently examined.    The road on which we travelled, and which was itself a source of  entertainment, is made along the rock, in the direction of the lough,  sometimes by breaking off protuberances, and sometimes by cutting the  great mass of stone to a considerable depth.  The fragments are piled in  a loose wall on either side, with apertures left at very short spaces, to  give a passage to the wintry currents.  Part of it is bordered with low  trees, from which our guides gathered nuts, and would have had the  appearance of an English lane, except that an English lane is almost  always dirty.  It has been made with great labour, but has this  advantage, that it cannot, without equal labour, be broken up.    Within our sight there were goats feeding or playing.  The mountains have  red deer, but they came not within view; and if what is said of their  vigilance and subtlety be true, they have some claim to that palm of  wisdom, which the eastern philosopher, whom Alexander interrogated, gave  to those beasts which live furthest from men.    Near the way, by the water side, we espied a cottage.  This was the first  Highland Hut that I had seen; and as our business was with life and  manners, we were willing to visit it.  To enter a habitation without  leave, seems to be not considered here as rudeness or intrusion.  The old  laws of hospitality still give this licence to a stranger.    A hut is constructed with loose stones, ranged for the most part with  some tendency to circularity.  It must be placed where the wind cannot  act upon it with violence, because it has no cement; and where the water  will run easily away, because it has no floor but the naked ground.  The  wall, which is commonly about six feet high, declines from the  perpendicular a little inward.  Such rafters as can be procured are then  raised for a roof, and covered with heath, which makes a strong and warm  thatch, kept from flying off by ropes of twisted heath, of which the  ends, reaching from the center of the thatch to the top of the wall, are  held firm by the weight of a large stone.  No light is admitted but at  the entrance, and through a hole in the thatch, which gives vent to the  smoke.  This hole is not directly over the fire, lest the rain should  extinguish it; and the smoke therefore naturally fills the place before  it escapes.  Such is the general structure of the houses in which one of  the nations of this opulent and powerful island has been hitherto content  to live.  Huts however are not more uniform than palaces; and this which  we were inspecting was very far from one of the meanest, for it was  divided into several apartments; and its inhabitants possessed such  property as a pastoral poet might exalt into riches.    When we entered, we found an old woman boiling goats-flesh in a kettle.  She spoke little English, but we had interpreters at hand; and she was  willing enough to display her whole system of economy.  She has five  children, of which none are yet gone from her.  The eldest, a boy of  thirteen, and her husband, who is eighty years old, were at work in the  wood.  Her two next sons were gone to Inverness to buy meal, by which  oatmeal is always meant.  Meal she considered as expensive food, and told  us, that in Spring, when the goats gave milk, the children could live  without it.  She is mistress of sixty goats, and I saw many kids in an  enclosure at the end of her house.  She had also some poultry.  By the  lake we saw a potatoe-garden, and a small spot of ground on which stood  four shucks, containing each twelve sheaves of barley.  She has all this  from the labour of their own hands, and for what is necessary to be  bought, her kids and her chickens are sent to market.    With the true pastoral hospitality, she asked us to sit down and drink  whisky.  She is religious, and though the kirk is four miles off,  probably eight English miles, she goes thither every Sunday.  We gave her  a shilling, and she begged snuff; for snuff is the luxury of a Highland  cottage.    Soon afterwards we came to the General's Hut, so called because it was  the temporary abode of Wade, while he superintended the works upon the  road.  It is now a house of entertainment for passengers, and we found it  not ill stocked with provisions.          FALL OF FIERS      Towards evening we crossed, by a bridge, the river which makes the  celebrated fall of Fiers.  The country at the bridge strikes the  imagination with all the gloom and grandeur of Siberian solitude.  The  way makes a flexure, and the mountains, covered with trees, rise at once  on the left hand and in the front.  We desired our guides to shew us the  fall, and dismounting, clambered over very rugged crags, till I began to  wish that our curiosity might have been gratified with less trouble and  danger.  We came at last to a place where we could overlook the river,  and saw a channel torn, as it seems, through black piles of stone, by  which the stream is obstructed and broken, till it comes to a very steep  descent, of such dreadful depth, that we were naturally inclined to turn  aside our eyes.    But we visited the place at an unseasonable time, and found it divested  of its dignity and terror.  Nature never gives every thing at once.  A  long continuance of dry weather, which made the rest of the way easy and  delightful, deprived us of the pleasure expected from the fall of Fiers.  The river having now no water but what the springs supply, showed us only  a swift current, clear and shallow, fretting over the asperities of the  rocky bottom, and we were left to exercise our thoughts, by endeavouring  to conceive the effect of a thousand streams poured from the mountains  into one channel, struggling for expansion in a narrow passage,  exasperated by rocks rising in their way, and at last discharging all  their violence of waters by a sudden fall through the horrid chasm.    The way now grew less easy, descending by an uneven declivity, but  without either dirt or danger.  We did not arrive at Fort Augustus till  it was late.  Mr. Boswell, who, between his father's merit and his own,  is sure of reception wherever he comes, sent a servant before to beg  admission and entertainment for that night.  Mr. Trapaud, the governor,  treated us with that courtesy which is so closely connected with the  military character.  He came out to meet us beyond the gates, and  apologized that, at so late an hour, the rules of a garrison suffered him  to give us entrance only at the postern.          FORT AUGUSTUS      In the morning we viewed the fort, which is much less than that of St.  George, and is said to be commanded by the neighbouring hills.

It seemed to be his great delight during supper to keep a  young girl next him in a continual agony of stifled laughter, in spite  of her awe of the reproving looks of her mother, who sat opposite.  Indeed, he was the idol of the younger part of the company, who laughed  at everything he said or did, and at every turn of his countenance. I  could not wonder at it; for he must have been a miracle of  accomplishments in their eyes. He could imitate Punch and Judy; make an  old woman of his hand, with the assistance of a burnt cork and  pocket-handkerchief; and cut an orange into such a ludicrous caricature,  that the young folks were ready to die with laughing.    [Illustration]    I was let briefly into his history by Frank Bracebridge. He was an old  bachelor of a small independent income, which by careful management was  sufficient for all his wants. He revolved through the family system like  a vagrant comet in its orbit; sometimes visiting one branch, and  sometimes another quite remote; as is often the case with gentlemen of  extensive connections and small fortunes in England. He had a chirping,  buoyant disposition, always enjoying the present moment; and his  frequent change of scene and company prevented his acquiring those rusty  unaccommodating habits with which old bachelors are so uncharitably  charged. He was a complete family chronicle, being versed in the  genealogy, history, and intermarriages of the whole house of  Bracebridge, which made him a great favourite with the old folks; he was  a beau of all the elder ladies and superannuated spinsters, among whom  he was habitually considered rather a young fellow, and he was a master  of the revels among the children; so that there was not a more popular  being in the sphere in which he moved than Mr. Simon Bracebridge. Of  late years he had resided almost entirely with the Squire, to whom he  had become a factotum, and whom he particularly delighted by jumping  with his humour in respect to old times, and by having a scrap of an old  song to suit every occasion. We had presently a specimen of his  last-mentioned talent; for no sooner was supper removed, and spiced  wines and other beverages peculiar to the season introduced, than Master  Simon was called on for a good old Christmas song. He bethought himself  for a moment, and then, with a sparkle of the eye, and a voice that was  by no means bad, excepting that it ran occasionally into a falsetto,  like the notes of a split reed, he quavered forth a quaint old ditty,--                Now Christmas is come,              Let us beat up the drum,            And call all our neighbours together;              And when they appear,              Let us make them such cheer,            As will keep out the wind and the weather, etc.    The supper had disposed every one to gaiety, and an old harper was  summoned from the servants' hall, where he had been strumming all the  evening, and to all appearance comforting himself with some of the  Squire's home-brewed. He was a kind of hanger-on, I was told, of the  establishment, and though ostensibly a resident of the village, was  oftener to be found in the Squire's kitchen than his own home, the old  gentleman being fond of the sound of \"harp in hall.\"    [Illustration]    The dance, like most dances after supper, was a merry one; some of the  older folks joined in it, and the Squire himself figured down several  couples with a partner with whom he affirmed he had danced at every  Christmas for nearly half-a-century. Master Simon, who seemed to be a  kind of connecting link between the old times and the new, and to be  withal a little antiquated in the taste of his accomplishments,  evidently piqued himself on his dancing, and was endeavouring to gain  credit by the heel and toe, rigadoon, and other graces of the ancient  school; but he had unluckily assorted himself with a little romping  girl from boarding-school, who, by her wild vivacity, kept him  continually on the stretch, and defeated all his sober attempts at  elegance;--such are the ill-assorted matches to which antique gentlemen  are unfortunately prone!    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    The young Oxonian, on the contrary, had led out one of his maiden aunts,  on whom the rogue played a thousand little knaveries with impunity; he  was full of practical jokes, and his delight was to tease his aunts and  cousins; yet, like all madcap youngsters, he was a universal favourite  among the women. The most interesting couple in the dance was the young  officer and a ward of the Squire's, a beautiful blushing girl of  seventeen. From several shy glances which I had noticed in the course of  the evening, I suspected there was a little kindness growing up between  them; and, indeed, the young soldier was just the hero to captivate a  romantic girl. He was tall, slender, and handsome, and, like most young  British officers of late years, had picked up various small  accomplishments on the Continent--he could talk French and Italian--draw  landscapes, sing very tolerably--dance divinely; but, above all, he had  been wounded at Waterloo:--what girl of seventeen, well read in poetry  and romance, could resist such a mirror of chivalry and perfection!    [Illustration]    The moment the dance was over, he caught up a guitar, and lolling  against the old marble fireplace, in an attitude which I am half  inclined to suspect was studied, began the little French air of the  Troubadour. The Squire, however, exclaimed against having anything on  Christmas eve but good old English; upon which the young minstrel,  casting up his eye for a moment, as if in an effort of memory, struck  into another strain, and, with a charming air of gallantry, gave  Herrick's \"Night-Piece to Julia:\"--              Her eyes the glow-worm lend thee,            The shooting stars attend thee,              And the elves also,              Whose little eyes glow            Like the sparks of fire, befriend thee.              No Will-o'-the-Wisp mislight thee;            Nor snake or glow-worm bite thee;              But on, on thy way,              Not making a stay,            Since ghost there is none to affright thee.              Then let not the dark thee cumber;            What though the moon does slumber,              The stars of the night              Will lend thee their light,            Like tapers clear without number.              Then, Julia, let me woo thee,            Thus, thus to come unto me;              And when I shall meet              Thy silvery feet,            My soul I'll pour into thee.    The song might have been intended in compliment to the fair Julia, for  so I found his partner was called, or it might not; she, however, was  certainly unconscious of any such application, for she never looked at  the singer, but kept her eyes cast upon the floor. Her face was  suffused, it is true, with a beautiful blush, and there was a gentle  heaving of the bosom, but all that was doubtless caused by the exercise  of the dance; indeed, so great was her indifference, that she was  amusing herself with plucking to pieces a choice bouquet of hothouse  flowers, and by the time the song was concluded, the nosegay lay in  ruins on the floor.    The party now broke up for the night with the kind-hearted old custom of  shaking hands. As I passed through the hall, on the way to my chamber,  the dying embers of the _Yule-clog_ still sent forth a dusky glow; and  had it not been the season when \"no spirit dares stir abroad,\" I should  have been half tempted to steal from my room at midnight, and peep  whether the fairies might not be at their revels about the hearth.    [Illustration: \"Indeed, so great was her indifference, that she was  amusing herself with plucking to pieces a choice bouquet of hot-house  flowers.\"--PAGE 72.]    My chamber was in the old part of the mansion, the ponderous furniture  of which might have been fabricated in the days of the giants. The room  was panelled with cornices of heavy carved-work, in which flowers and  grotesque faces were strangely intermingled; and a row of black-looking  portraits stared mournfully at me from the walls. The bed was of rich  though faded damask, with a lofty tester, and stood in a niche opposite  a bow-window. I had scarcely got into bed when a strain of music seemed  to break forth in the air just below the window. I listened, and found  it proceeded from a band, which I concluded to be the waits from some  neighbouring village. They went round the house, playing under the  windows. I drew aside the curtains, to hear them more distinctly. The  moonbeams fell through the upper part of the casement, partially  lighting up the antiquated apartment. The sounds, as they receded,  became more soft and aerial, and seemed to accord with quiet and  moonlight. I listened and listened--they became more and more tender  and remote, and, as they gradually died away, my head sank upon the  pillow and I fell asleep.
