From his youth, Josephus had carefully prepared  himself for public life, mastering the doctrines of the three  leading sects among the Jews--the Pharisees, Sadducees, and  Essenes--and having spent three years in the desert, with Banus the  Ascetic. The fact that, at only twenty-six years of age, he had  gone as the leader of a deputation to Rome, on behalf of some  priests sent there by Felix, shows that he was early looked upon as  a conspicuous person among the Jews; and he was but thirty when he  was intrusted with the important position of Governor of Galilee.    Contrary to the custom of the times, he had sought to make no gain  from his position. He accepted neither presents, nor bribes; but  devoted himself entirely to ameliorating the condition of the  people, and in repressing the turbulence of the lower classes of  the great towns; and of the robber chieftains who, like John of  Gischala, took advantage of the relaxation of authority, caused by  the successful rising against the Romans, to plunder and tyrannize  over the people.    The expression of the face of Josephus was lofty and, at the same  time, gentle. His temper was singularly equable and, whatever the  circumstances, he never gave way to anger, but kept his passions  well under control. His address was soft and winning, and he had  the art of attracting respect and friendship from all who came in  contact with him. Poppaea, the wife of Nero, had received him with  much favor and, bravely as he fought against them, Vespasian and  Titus were, afterwards, as much attached to him as were the Jews of  Galilee. There can be no doubt that, had he been otherwise placed  than as one of a people on the verge of destruction, Josephus would  have been one of the great figures of history.    John had been accustomed to hear his father and his friends speak  in tones of such admiration for Josephus, as the man who was  regarded not only as the benefactor of the Jews of Galilee, but as  the leader and mainstay of the nation, that he had long ardently  desired to see him; and to find that he had now been rescued from  death by him, and that he was now talking to him face to face,  filled him with confusion.    \"You are a brave lad,\" Josephus said, \"for you kept your head well,  in a time when older men might have lost their presence of mind.  You must have kept your boat dead before the wind; and you were  quick and ready, in seizing the rope and knotting it round  yourself, and the maid with you. I feared you might try and fasten  it to the boat. If you had, full of water as she was, and fast as  we were sailing before the wind, the rope would barely have stood  the strain.\"    \"The clouds are breaking,\" the captain of the boat said, coming up  to Josephus, \"and I think that we are past the worst of the gale.  And well it is so for, even in so staunch a craft, there is much  peril in such a sea as this.\"    The vessel, although one of the largest on the lake, was indeed  pitching and rolling very heavily; but she was light and buoyant  and, each time that she plunged bows under, as the following waves  lifted her stern high in the air, she rose lightly again; and  scarce a drop fell into her deep waist, the lofty erections, fore  and aft, throwing off the water.    \"Where do you belong, my lad?\" Josephus asked. \"I fear that it is  impossible for us to put you ashore, until we reach Capernaum; but  once there, I will see that you are provided with means to take you  home.\"    \"Our farm lies three miles above Hippos.\"    \"That is unfortunate,\" Josephus said, \"since it lies on the  opposite side of the lake to Capernaum. However, we shall see. If  the storm goes down rapidly, I may be able to get a fishing boat to  take you across, this evening; for your parents will be in sore  trouble. If not, you must wait till early morning.\"    In another hour they reached Capernaum. The wind had, by this time,  greatly abated; although the sea still ran high. The ship was soon  alongside a landing jetty, which ran out a considerable distance,  and formed a breakwater protecting the shipping from the heavy sea  which broke there when the wind was, as at present, from the south.    Mary came out from the cabin, as the vessel entered the harbor,  wrapped up from head to foot in the woolen cloths with which she  had been furnished. John sprang to her side.    \"Are you quite well, Mary?\"    \"Quite well,\" she said, \"only very ashamed of having fainted, and  very uncomfortable in these wrappings. But, oh! John, how thankful  we ought to be, to God, for having sent this ship to our aid, just  when all seemed lost!\"    \"We ought, indeed, Mary. I have been thanking him, as I have been  standing here watching the waves; and I am sure you have been doing  the same, in the cabin.\"    \"Yes, indeed, John. But what am I to do, now? I do not like going  on shore like this, and the officer told me I was, on no account,  to put on my wet clothes.\"    \"Do you know, it is Josephus himself, Mary--think of that--the  great Josephus, who has saved us! He marked our boat before the  storm broke and, seeing that we could not reach the shore, had his  vessel steered so as to overtake us.\"    Mary was too surprised to utter more than an exclamation. The  thought that the man, who had been talking so kindly and pleasantly  to her, was the great leader of whom she had heard so much, quite  took away her breath.    At that moment Josephus, himself, came up.    \"I am glad to see you have got your color again, maiden,\" he said.  \"I am just going to land. Do you, with your cousin, remain on board  here. I will send a woman down, with some attire for you. She will  conduct you both to the house where I shall be staying.    \"The sea is going down, and the captain tells me that he thinks, in  another three or four hours, I shall be able to get a boat to send  you across to your home. It will be late, but you will not mind  that; for they are sure not to retire to rest, at home, but to be  up all night, searching for you.\"    A crowd had assembled on the jetty, for Josephus was expected, and  the violent storm had excited the fears of all for his safety; and  the leading inhabitants had all flocked down to welcome him, when  his vessel was seen approaching.    \"Isn't he kind and good?\" Mary said, enthusiastically, as she  watched the greeting which he received, as he landed. \"He talked to  me, just as if he had been of my own family.\"    \"He is grand!\" John agreed, with equal enthusiasm. \"He is just what  I pictured to myself that a great leader would be; such as Joshua,  or Gideon, or the Prince of the Maccabees.\"    \"Yes; but more gentle, John.\"    \"Brave men should always be gentle,\" John said, positively.    \"They ought to be, perhaps,\" Mary agreed, \"but I don't think they  are.\"    They chatted, then, about the storm and the anxiety which they  would be feeling, at home; until an officer, accompanied by a woman  carrying attire for Mary, came on board. Mary soon came out of the  cabin, dressed; and the officer conducted them to the house which  had been placed at the disposal of Josephus. The woman led them up  to a room, where a meal had been prepared for them.    \"Josephus is in council, with the elders,\" she said. \"He bade me  see that you had all that you required. He has arranged that a bark  shall start with you, as soon as the sea goes down; but if, by  eight o'clock, it is still too rough, I shall take the maiden home  to my house, to sleep; and they will arouse you, as soon as it is  safe to put out, whatever the hour may be, as your friends will be  in great anxiety concerning you.\"    The sun had already set and, just as they finished their meal, the  man belonging to the boat came to say that it would be midnight  before he could put out.    Mary then went over with the woman; and John lay down on some mats,  to sleep, until it was time to start. He slept soundly, until he  was aroused by the entry of someone, with lights. He started to his  feet, and found that it was Josephus, himself, with an attendant.    \"I had not forgotten you,\" he said, \"but I have been, until now, in  council. It is close upon midnight, and the boat is in readiness. I  have sent to fetch the damsel, and have bidden them take plenty of  warm wraps, so that the night air may do her no harm.\"    Mary soon arrived; and Josephus, himself, went down with them to  the shore, and saw them on board the boat--which was a large one,  with eight rowers. The wind had died away to a gentle breeze, and  the sea had gone down greatly. The moon was up, and the stars  shining brightly. Josephus chatted kindly to John, as they made  their way down to the shore.    \"Tell your father,\" he said, \"that I hope he will come over to see  me, ere long; and that I shall bear you in mind. The time is coming  when every Jew who can bear arms will be needed in the service of  his country and, if your father consents, I will place you near my  person; for I have seen that you are brave and cool, in danger, and  you will have plenty of opportunities of winning advancement.\"    With many thanks for his kindness, John and Mary took their places  in the stern of the boat. Mary enveloped herself in the wraps that  had been prepared for her, for the nights were chilly. Then the  sail was hoisted, and the boat sailed away from the land. The wind  had shifted round, somewhat, to the west, and they were able to lay  their course across towards Hippos; but their progress was slow,  and the master bade the crew get out their oars, and aid the sail.    In three hours they neared the land, John pointing out the exact  position of the village; which was plainly enough marked out, by a  great fire blazing on the shore. As they approached it, they could  see several figures and, presently, there came a shout, which John  recognized as that of Isaac.    \"Any news?\"    \"Here we"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21615"],[0,"Curiosities of Literature, Vol. 1 (#6)"],[1," a club, it was only to go into the library. In the  country, he scarcely ever left his room but to saunter in abstraction  upon a terrace; muse over a chapter, or coin a sentence. He had not a  single passion or prejudice: all his convictions were the result of his  own studies, and were often opposed to the impressions which he had  early imbibed. He not only never entered into the politics of the day,  but he could never understand them. He never was connected with any  particular body or set of men; comrades of school or college, or  confederates in that public life which, in England, is, perhaps, the  only foundation of real friendship. In the consideration of a question,  his mind was quite undisturbed by traditionary preconceptions; and it  was this exemption from passion and prejudice which, although his  intelligence was naturally somewhat too ingenious and fanciful for the  conduct of close argument, enabled him, in investigation, often to show  many of the highest attributes of the judicial mind, and particularly to  sum up evidence with singular happiness and ability.    Although in private life he was of a timid nature, his moral courage as  a writer was unimpeachable. Most certainly, throughout his long career,  he never wrote a sentence which he did not believe was true. He will  generally be found to be the advocate of the discomfited and the  oppressed. So his conclusions are often opposed to popular impressions.  This was from no love of paradox, to which he was quite superior; but  because in the conduct of his researches, he too often found that the  unfortunate are calumniated. His vindication of King James the First, he  has himself described as \"an affair of literary conscience:\" his greater  work on the Life and Times of the son of the first Stuart arose from the  same impulse. He had deeply studied our history during the first moiety  of the seventeenth century; he looked upon it as a famous age; he was  familiar with the works of its great writers, and there was scarcely one  of its almost innumerable pamphlets with which he was not acquainted.  During the thoughtful investigations of many years, he had arrived at  results which were not adapted to please the passing multitude, but  which, because he held them to be authentic, he was uneasy lest he  should die without recording. Yet strong as were his convictions,  although, notwithstanding his education in the revolutionary philosophy  of the eighteenth century, his nature and his studies had made him a  votary of loyalty and reverence, his pen was always prompt to do justice  to those who might be looked upon as the adversaries of his own cause:  and this was because his cause was really truth. If he has upheld Laud  under unjust aspersions, the last labour of his literary life was to  vindicate the character of Hugh Peters. If, from the recollection of the  sufferings of his race, and from profound reflection on the principles  of the Institution, he was hostile to the Papacy, no writer in our  literature has done more complete justice to the conduct of the English  Romanists. Who can read his history of Chidiock Titchbourne unmoved? or  can refuse to sympathise with his account of the painful difficulties of  the English Monarchs with their loyal subjects of the old faith? If in  a parliamentary country he has dared to criticise the conduct of  Parliaments, it was only because an impartial judgment had taught him,  as he himself expresses it, that \"Parliaments have their passions as  well as individuals.\"    He was five years in the composition of his work on the \"Life and Reign  of Charles the First,\" and the five volumes appeared at intervals  between 1828 and 1831. It was feared by his publisher, that the  distracted epoch at which this work was issued, and the tendency of the  times, apparently so adverse to his own views, might prove very  injurious to its reception. But the effect of these circumstances was  the reverse. The minds of men were inclined to the grave and national  considerations that were involved in these investigations. The  principles of political institutions, the rival claims of the two Houses  of Parliament, the authority of the Established Church, the demands of  religious sects, were, after a long lapse of years, anew the theme of  public discussion. Men were attracted to a writer who traced the origin  of the anti-monarchical principle in modern Europe; treated of the arts  of insurgency; gave them, at the same time, a critical history of the  Puritans, and a treatise on the genius of the Papacy; scrutinised the  conduct of triumphant patriots, and vindicated a decapitated monarch.  The success of this work was eminent; and its author appeared for the  first and only time of his life in public, when amidst the cheers of  under-graduates, and the applause of graver men, the solitary student  received an honorary degree from the University of Oxford, a fitting  homage, in the language of the great University, \"OPTIMI REGIS OPTIMO  VINDICI.\"    I cannot but recall a trait that happened on this occasion. After my  father returned to his hotel from the theatre, a stranger requested an  interview with him. A Swiss gentleman, travelling in England at the  time, who had witnessed the scene just closed, begged to express the  reason why he presumed thus personally and cordially to congratulate  the new Doctor of Civil Law. He was the son of my grandfather's chief  clerk, and remembered his parent's employer; whom he regretted did not  survive to be aware of this honourable day. Thus, amid all the strange  vicissitudes of life, we are ever, as it were, moving in a circle.    Notwithstanding he was now approaching his seventieth year, his health  being unbroken and his constitution very robust, my father resolved  vigorously to devote himself to the composition of the history of our  vernacular Literature. He hesitated for a moment, whether he should at  once address himself to this greater task, or whether he should first  complete a Life of Pope, for which he had made great preparations, and  which had long occupied his thoughts. His review of \"Spence's Anecdotes\"  in the Quarterly, so far back as 1820, which gave rise to the celebrated  Pope Controversy, in which Mr. Campbell, Lord Byron, Mr. Bowles, Mr.  Roscoe, and others less eminent broke lances, would prove how well  qualified, even at that distant date, the critic was to become the  biographer of the great writer, whose literary excellency and moral  conduct he, on that occasion, alike vindicated. But, unfortunately as it  turned out, my father was persuaded to address himself to the weightier  task. Hitherto, in his publications, he had always felt an extreme  reluctance to travel over ground which others had previously visited. He  liked to give new matter, and devote himself to detached points, on  which he entertained different opinions from those prevalent. Thus his  works are generally of a supplementary character, and assume in their  readers a certain degree of preliminary knowledge. In the present  instance he was induced to frame his undertaking on a different scale,  and to prepare a history which should be complete in itself, and supply  the reader with a perfect view of the gradual formation of our language  and literature. He proposed to effect this in six volumes; though, I  apprehend, he would not have succeeded in fulfilling his intentions  within that limit. His treatment of the period of Queen Anne would have  been very ample, and he would also have accomplished in this general  work a purpose which he had also long contemplated, and for which he had  made curious and extensive collections, namely, a History of the English  Freethinkers.    But all these great plans were destined to a terrible defeat. Towards  the end of the year 1839, still in the full vigour of his health and  intellect, he suffered a paralysis of the optic nerve; and that eye,  which for so long a term had kindled with critical interest over the  volumes of so many literatures and so many languages, was doomed to  pursue its animated course no more. Considering the bitterness of such a  calamity to one whose powers were otherwise not in the least impaired,  he bore on the whole his fate with magnanimity, even with cheerfulness.  Unhappily, his previous habits of study and composition rendered the  habit of dictation intolerable, even impossible to him. But with the  assistance of his daughter, whose intelligent solicitude he has  commemorated in more than one grateful passage, he selected from his  manuscripts three volumes, which he wished to have published under the  becoming title of \"A Fragment of a History of English Literature,\" but  which were eventually given to the public under that of \"Amenities of  Literature.\"    He was also enabled during these last years of physical, though not of  moral, gloom, to prepare a new edition of his work on the Life and Times  of Charles the First, which had been for some time out of print. He  contrived, though slowly, and with great labour, very carefully to  revise, and improve, and enrich these volumes. He was wont to say that  the best monument to an author was a good edition of his works: it is my  purpose that he should possess this memorial. He has been described by a  great authority as a writer sui generis; and indeed had he never  written, it appears to me, that there would have been a gap in our  libraries, which it would have been difficult to supply. Of him it might  be added that, for an author, his end was an euthanasia, for on the day  before he was seized by that fatal epidemic, of the danger of which, to  the last moment, he was unconscious, he was apprised by his publishers,  that all his works were out of print, and that their re-publication  could no longer be delayed.    In this notice of the career of my father, I have ventured to draw  attention to three circumstances which I thought would be"]]]
