Far away, so faint and far, is flaming London, fevered Paris,      That I fancy I have gained another star;     Far away the din and hurry, far away the sin and worry,      Far away -- God knows they cannot be too far.     Gilded galley-slaves of Mammon -- how my purse-proud brothers taunt me!      I might have been as well-to-do as they     Had I clutched like them my chances,       learned their wisdom, crushed my fancies,      Starved my soul and gone to business every day.       Well, the cherry bends with blossom and the vivid grass is springing,      And the star-like lily nestles in the green;     And the frogs their joys are singing, and my heart in tune is ringing,      And it doesn't matter what I might have been.     While above the scented pine-gloom, piling heights of golden glory,      The sun-god paints his canvas in the west,     I can couch me deep in clover, I can listen to the story      Of the lazy, lapping water -- it is best.       While the trout leaps in the river, and the blue grouse thrills the cover,      And the frozen snow betrays the panther's track,     And the robin greets the dayspring with the rapture of a lover,      I am happy, and I'll nevermore go back.     For I know I'd just be longing for the little old log cabin,      With the morning-glory clinging to the door,     Till I loathed the city places, cursed the care on all the faces,      Turned my back on lazar London evermore.       So send me far from Lombard Street, and write me down a failure;      Put a little in my purse and leave me free.     Say:  \"He turned from Fortune's offering to follow up a pale lure,      He is one of us no longer -- let him be.\"     I am one of you no longer; by the trails my feet have broken,      The dizzy peaks I've scaled, the camp-fire's glow;     By the lonely seas I've sailed in -- yea, the final word is spoken,      I am signed and sealed to nature.  Be it so.          The Low-Down White           This is the pay-day up at the mines, when the bearded brutes come down;     There's money to burn in the streets to-night,       so I've sent my klooch to town,     With a haggard face and a ribband of red entwined in her hair of brown.       And I know at the dawn she'll come reeling home       with the bottles, one, two, three --     One for herself, to drown her shame, and two big bottles for me,     To make me forget the thing I am and the man I used to be.       To make me forget the brand of the dog, as I crouch in this hideous place;     To make me forget once I kindled the light of love in a lady's face,     Where even the squalid Siwash now holds me a black disgrace.       Oh, I have guarded my secret well!  And who would dream as I speak     In a tribal tongue like a rogue unhung, 'mid the ranch-house filth and reek,     I could roll to bed with a Latin phrase and rise with a verse of Greek?       Yet I was a senior prizeman once, and the pride of a college eight;     Called to the bar -- my friends were true!       but they could not keep me straight;     Then came the divorce, and I went abroad and \"died\" on the River Plate.       But I'm not dead yet; though with half a lung there isn't time to spare,     And I hope that the year will see me out, and, thank God, no one will care --     Save maybe the little slim Siwash girl with the rose of shame in her hair.       She will come with the dawn, and the dawn is near; I can see its evil glow,     Like a corpse-light seen through a frosty pane in a night of want and woe;     And yonder she comes by the bleak bull-pines,       swift staggering through the snow.          The Little Old Log Cabin           When a man gits on his uppers in a hard-pan sort of town,      An' he ain't got nothin' comin' an' he can't afford ter eat,     An' he's in a fix for lodgin' an' he wanders up an' down,      An' you'd fancy he'd been boozin', he's so locoed 'bout the feet;     When he's feelin' sneakin' sorry an' his belt is hangin' slack,      An' his face is peaked an' gray-like an' his heart gits down an' whines,     Then he's apt ter git a-thinkin' an' a-wishin' he was back      In the little ol' log cabin in the shadder of the pines.       When he's on the blazin' desert an' his canteen's sprung a leak,      An' he's all alone an' crazy an' he's crawlin' like a snail,     An' his tongue's so black an' swollen that it hurts him fer to speak,      An' he gouges down fer water an' the raven's on his trail;     When he's done with care and cursin' an' he feels more like to cry,      An' he sees ol' Death a-grinnin' an' he thinks upon his crimes,     Then he's like ter hev' a vision, as he settles down ter die,      Of the little ol' log cabin an' the roses an' the vines.       Oh, the little ol' log cabin, it's a solemn shinin' mark,      When a feller gits ter sinnin' an' a-goin' ter the wall,     An' folks don't understand him an' he's gropin' in the dark,      An' he's sick of bein' cursed at an' he's longin' fer his call!     When the sun of life's a-sinkin' you can see it 'way above,      On the hill from out the shadder in a glory 'gin the sky,     An' your mother's voice is callin', an' her arms are stretched in love,      An' somehow you're glad you're goin', an' you ain't a-scared to die;     When you'll be like a kid again an' nestle to her breast,      An' never leave its shelter, an' forget, an' love, an' rest.          The Younger Son           If you leave the gloom of London and you seek a glowing land,      Where all except the flag is strange and new,     There's a bronzed and stalwart fellow who will grip you by the hand,      And greet you with a welcome warm and true;     For he's your younger brother, the one you sent away      Because there wasn't room for him at home;     And now he's quite contented, and he's glad he didn't stay,      And he's building Britain's greatness o'er the foam.       When the giant herd is moving at the rising of the sun,      And the prairie is lit with rose and gold,     And the camp is all abustle, and the busy day's begun,      He leaps into the saddle sure and bold.     Through the round of heat and hurry, through the racket and the rout,      He rattles at a pace that nothing mars;     And when the night-winds whisper and camp-fires flicker out,      He is sleeping like a child beneath the stars.       When the wattle-blooms are drooping in the sombre she-oak glade,      And the breathless land is lying in a swoon,     He leaves his work a moment, leaning lightly on his spade,      And he hears the bell-bird chime the Austral noon.     The parrakeets are silent in the gum-tree by the creek;      The ferny grove is sunshine-steeped and still;     But the dew will gem the myrtle in the twilight ere he seek      His little lonely cabin on the hill.       Around the purple, vine-clad slope the argent river dreams;      The roses almost hide the house from view;     A snow-peak of the Winterberg in crimson splendor gleams;      The shadow deepens down on the karroo.     He seeks the lily-scented dusk beneath the orange tree;      His pipe in silence glows and fades and glows;     And then two little maids come out and climb upon his knee,      And one is like the lily, one the rose.       He sees his white sheep dapple o'er the green New Zealand plain,      And where Vancouver's shaggy ramparts frown,     When the sunlight threads the pine-gloom he is fighting might and main      To clinch the rivets of an Empire down.     You will find him toiling, toiling, in the south or in the west,      A child of nature, fearless, frank, and free;     And the warmest heart that beats for you is beating in his breast,      And he sends you loyal greeting o'er the sea.       You've a brother in the army, you've another in the Church;      One of you is a diplomatic swell;     You've had the pick of everything and left him in the lurch,      And yet I think he's doing very well.     I'm sure his life is happy, and he doesn't envy yours;      I know he loves the land his pluck has won;     And I fancy in the years unborn, while England's fame endures,      She will come to bless with pride -- The Younger Son.          The March of the Dead           The cruel war was over -- oh, the triumph was so sweet!      We watched the troops returning, through our tears;     There was triumph, triumph, triumph down the scarlet glittering street,      And you scarce could hear the music for the cheers.     And you scarce could see the house-tops for the flags that flew between;      The bells were pealing madly to the sky;     And everyone was shouting for the Soldiers of the Queen,      And the glory of an age was passing by.       And then there came a shadow, swift and sudden, dark and drear;      The bells were silent, not an echo stirred.     The flags were drooping sullenly, the men forgot to cheer;      We waited, and we never spoke a word.     The sky grew darker, darker, till from out the gloomy rack      There came a voice that checked the heart with dread:     \"Tear down, tear down your bunting now, and hang up sable black;      They are coming -- it's the Army of the Dead.\"       They were coming, they were coming, gaunt and ghastly, sad and slow;      They were coming, all the crimson wrecks of pride;     With faces seared, and cheeks red smeared, and haunting eyes of woe,      And clotted holes the khaki couldn't hide.     Oh, the clammy brow of anguish! the livid, foam-flecked lips!      The reeling ranks of ruin swept along!     The limb that trailed, the hand that failed, the bloody finger tips!      And oh, the dreary rhythm of their song!       \"They left us on the veldt-side, but we felt we couldn't stop      On this, our England's crowning festal day;     We're the men of Magersfontein, we're the men of Spion Kop,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2070"],[0,"To the Last Man (#6)"],[1," his way.  He wondered at it.  Moreover, he wondered at the significance he placed  upon it.  After all, was it not merely an accident?  Why should he  remember?  Why should he ponder?  What was the faint, deep, growing  thrill that accompanied some of his thoughts?    Riding along with busy mind, Jean almost crossed a well-beaten trail,  leading through a pine thicket and down over the Rim.  Jean's pack mule  led the way without being driven.  And when Jean reached the edge of  the bluff one look down was enough to fetch him off his horse. That  trail was steep, narrow, clogged with stones, and as full of sharp  corners as a crosscut saw.  Once on the descent with a packed mule and  a spirited horse, Jean had no time for mind wanderings and very little  for occasional glimpses out over the cedar tops to the vast blue hollow  asleep under a westering sun.    The stones rattled, the dust rose, the cedar twigs snapped, the little  avalanches of red earth slid down, the iron-shod hoofs rang on the  rocks. This slope had been narrow at the apex in the Rim where the  trail led down a crack, and it widened in fan shape as Jean descended.  He zigzagged down a thousand feet before the slope benched into  dividing ridges.  Here the cedars and junipers failed and pines once  more hid the sun.  Deep ravines were black with brush.  From somewhere  rose a roar of running water, most pleasant to Jean's ears.  Fresh deer  and bear tracks covered old ones made in the trail.    Those timbered ridges were but billows of that tremendous slope that  now sheered above Jean, ending in a magnificent yellow wall of rock,  greened in niches, stained by weather rust, carved and cracked and  caverned.  As Jean descended farther the hum of bees made melody, the  roar of rapid water and the murmur of a rising breeze filled him with  the content of the wild.  Sheepmen like Colter and wild girls like  Ellen Jorth and all that seemed promising or menacing in his father's  letter could never change the Indian in Jean.  So he thought.  Hard  upon that conclusion rushed another--one which troubled with its  stinging revelation.  Surely these influences he had defied were just  the ones to bring out in him the Indian he had sensed but had never  known.  The eventful day had brought new and bitter food for Jean to  reflect upon.    The trail landed him in the bowlder-strewn bed of a wide canyon, where  the huge trees stretched a canopy of foliage which denied the sunlight,  and where a beautiful brook rushed and foamed.  Here at last Jean  tasted water that rivaled his Oregon springs.  \"Ah,\" he cried, \"that  sure is good!\"  Dark and shaded and ferny and mossy was this streamway;  and everywhere were tracks of game, from the giant spread of a grizzly  bear to the tiny, birdlike imprints of a squirrel.  Jean heard familiar  sounds of deer crackling the dead twigs; and the chatter of squirrels  was incessant.  This fragrant, cool retreat under the Rim brought back  to him the dim recesses of Oregon forests.  After all, Jean felt that  he would not miss anything that he had loved in the Cascades.  But what  was the vague sense of all not being well with him--the essence of a  faint regret--the insistence of a hovering shadow?  And then flashed  again, etched more vividly by the repetition in memory, a picture of  eyes, of lips--of something he had to forget.    Wild and broken as this rolling Basin floor had appeared from the Rim,  the reality of traveling over it made that first impression a deceit of  distance.  Down here all was on a big, rough, broken scale.  Jean did  not find even a few rods of level ground.  Bowlders as huge as houses  obstructed the stream bed; spruce trees eight feet thick tried to lord  it over the brawny pines; the ravine was a veritable canyon from which  occasional glimpses through the foliage showed the Rim as a lofty  red-tipped mountain peak.    Jean's pack mule became frightened at scent of a bear or lion and ran  off down the rough trail, imperiling Jean's outfit.  It was not an easy  task to head him off nor, when that was accomplished, to keep him to a  trot.  But his fright and succeeding skittishness at least made for  fast traveling.  Jean calculated that he covered ten miles under the  Rim before the character of ground and forest began to change.    The trail had turned southeast.  Instead of gorge after gorge,  red-walled and choked with forest, there began to be rolling ridges,  some high; others were knolls; and a thick cedar growth made up for a  falling off of pine.  The spruce had long disappeared.  Juniper  thickets gave way more and more to the beautiful manzanita; and soon on  the south slopes appeared cactus and a scrubby live oak.  But for the  well-broken trail, Jean would have fared ill through this tough brush.    Jean espied several deer, and again a coyote, and what he took to be a  small herd of wild horses.  No more turkey tracks showed in the dusty  patches.  He crossed a number of tiny brooklets, and at length came to  a place where the trail ended or merged in a rough road that showed  evidence of considerable travel.  Horses, sheep, and cattle had passed  along there that day.  This road turned southward, and Jean began to  have pleasurable expectations.    The road, like the trail, led down grade, but no longer at such steep  angles, and was bordered by cedar and pinyon, jack-pine and juniper,  mescal and manzanita.  Quite sharply, going around a ridge, the road  led Jean's eye down to a small open flat of marshy, or at least grassy,  ground.  This green oasis in the wilderness of red and timbered ridges  marked another change in the character of the Basin.  Beyond that the  country began to spread out and roll gracefully, its dark-green forest  interspersed with grassy parks, until Jean headed into a long, wide  gray-green valley surrounded by black-fringed hills.  His pulses  quickened here.  He saw cattle dotting the expanse, and here and there  along the edge log cabins and corrals.    As a village, Grass Valley could not boast of much, apparently, in the  way of population.  Cabins and houses were widely scattered, as if the  inhabitants did not care to encroach upon one another.  But the one  store, built of stone, and stamped also with the characteristic  isolation, seemed to Jean to be a rather remarkable edifice.  Not  exactly like a fort did it strike him, but if it had not been designed  for defense it certainly gave that impression, especially from the  long, low side with its dark eye-like windows about the height of a  man's shoulder.  Some rather fine horses were tied to a hitching rail.  Otherwise dust and dirt and age and long use stamped this Grass Valley  store and its immediate environment.    Jean threw his bridle, and, getting down, mounted the low porch and  stepped into the wide open door.  A face, gray against the background  of gloom inside, passed out of sight just as Jean entered.  He knew he  had been seen.  In front of the long, rather low-ceiled store were four  men, all absorbed, apparently, in a game of checkers.  Two were playing  and two were looking on.  One of these, a gaunt-faced man past middle  age, casually looked up as Jean entered.  But the moment of that casual  glance afforded Jean time enough to meet eyes he instinctively  distrusted. They masked their penetration.  They seemed neither curious  nor friendly. They saw him as if he had been merely thin air.    \"Good evenin',\" said Jean.    After what appeared to Jean a lapse of time sufficient to impress him  with a possible deafness of these men, the gaunt-faced one said,  \"Howdy, Isbel!\"    The tone was impersonal, dry, easy, cool, laconic, and yet it could not  have been more pregnant with meaning.  Jean's sharp sensibilities  absorbed much.  None of the slouch-sombreroed, long-mustached  Texans--for so Jean at once classed them--had ever seen Jean, but they  knew him and knew that he was expected in Grass Valley.  All but the  one who had spoken happened to have their faces in shadow under the  wide-brimmed black hats.  Motley-garbed, gun-belted, dusty-booted, they  gave Jean the same impression of latent force that he had encountered  in Colter.    \"Will somebody please tell me where to find my father, Gaston Isbel?\"  inquired Jean, with as civil a tongue as he could command.    Nobody paid the slightest attention.  It was the same as if Jean had  not spoken.  Waiting, half amused, half irritated, Jean shot a rapid  glance around the store.  The place had felt bare; and Jean, peering  back through gloomy space, saw that it did not contain much.  Dry goods  and sacks littered a long rude counter; long rough shelves divided  their length into stacks of canned foods and empty sections; a low  shelf back of the counter held a generous burden of cartridge boxes,  and next to it stood a rack of rifles.  On the counter lay open cases  of plug tobacco, the odor of which was second in strength only to that  of rum.    Jean's swift-roving eye reverted to the men, three of whom were  absorbed in the greasy checkerboard.  The fourth man was the one who  had spoken and he now deigned to look at Jean.  Not much flesh was  there stretched over his bony, powerful physiognomy.  He stroked a lean  chin with a big mobile hand that suggested more of bridle holding than  familiarity with a bucksaw and plow handle.  It was a lazy hand.  The  man looked lazy.  If he spoke at all it would be with lazy speech, yet  Jean had not encountered many men to whom he would have accorded more  potency to stir in him the instinct of self-preservation.    \"Shore,\" drawled this gaunt-faced Texan, \"old Gass lives aboot a mile  down heah.\"  With slow sweep of the big hand he indicated a general  direction to the south; then, appearing to forget his questioner, he  turned his attention to the game.    Jean muttered his thanks and, striding out, he mounted again, and drove  the pack mule down the road.  \"Reckon I've ran into"]]]
