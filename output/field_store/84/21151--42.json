He rushed many  times, knocking off piece after piece of the tree, until very little  was left.    Then the frightened Indians lighted some tinder, and threw it far off  into the tall grass. The fire scorched the Buffalo Being's eyes, and  injured his horns. The hard part of the horn slipped off, leaving only  the softer part, so that he could no longer injure any one.    But the Buffalo Being was still dangerous. At last one of the Indians  slipped down the tree, with his bow and arrow. He killed the Buffalo  Being. Then all the men came down the tree and skinned the animal and  cut up the flesh. Into the buffalo-skin robe they placed the body of  the dead Indian. But suddenly another Buffalo Being appeared. The  Indians again climbed the tree. But this Being only walked four times  around the dead Indian. Then he said, \"Arise to your feet.\"    At once the dead man came to life. The Buffalo Being said to him,  \"Hereafter you shall be mysterious. The sun, the moons, the four  winds, day and night shall be your slaves.\"    Then it was so. The Indian could take the form of a fine plume, which  was blown against a tree. It would stick to the tree and wave many  times in the breeze.          [Notes: GERMAN KNIGHTS AND INDIAN WARRIORS    _The German knights are from a sketch in a Ms., dated 1220, in the  University of Leipzig. The sketch was copied from Rudolph Cronau's  \"Geschichte der Solinger Klingenindustrie.\" They are Knights of the  13th century._    _The Indian warriors were drawn by an Apache Indian at Anadarko, in  1884, though the insignia is really that of the Cheyenne Indians._    _The comparison and contrast are made by the Bureau of Ethnology._]    [Illustration: _Courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution_]          THE YOUTH AND THE UNDERGROUND PEOPLE    _Omaha_      There were some villages which were very populous. The chief's son and  his daughter were unmarried. There were two sons. They surrounded the  herds of buffaloes. They used to kill buffaloes.    One of the sons of this chief attacked a buffalo when far apart from  the rest. He shot it; but the buffalo had gone out of sight into the  ground. The man and his horse, too, went headlong; but the buffalo  went down first.    Now the father sent out criers. \"He says that his son reached the  buffaloes, but he has not come home. He says that ye who have seen his  son will please tell it,\" shouted the criers.    One said he had seen him. \"I saw him very distinctly. He went in  pursuit. Perhaps he went headlong into a sunken place, for when on  very level ground he vanished altogether. I did not see him again,\" he  said.    The father commanded the people to join him in seeking his son. When  the man who had seen him said, \"It was just here,\" the people  scattered far and wide, seeking the chief's son. All the people sought  him. Behold, he had gone down the pit some time before. The buffalo  had gone down, having kicked off a piece of the soil. The horse, too,  had gone down, having kicked off a piece of the soil.    There was no trail beyond the pit. All the people went directly to it,  without hesitation.    The pit was very large and extended far downward. The chief spoke of  removing the village there, at once. So there they camped. They camped  around the pit.    Then the chief implored the young men and those who had been his  friends. If there was one man who was stout-hearted, one who had a  firm heart, the father wished him to enter the pit and go after the  young man. So he implored them.    At length one rode round and round the village. Then he promised to  enter the pit and go after the missing son.    \"Tell his father. He must also collect cords,\" he said.    Having cut buffalo hides in strips, he collected the cords.    \"Make a round piece of skin for me, and tie the long line of cord to  it,\" he said. So they finished it.    \"Now it matters not to what place I go, I will put the body in the  skin bucket. I go to take hold of him. When I reach the ground at the  bottom, I will pull suddenly on the cord. When I pull on it many  times, you will draw it up.\" Thus he said.    At last he reached the ground inside the pit. It was very dark. When  he felt around in the dark, the buffalo was lying alone, being killed  by the fall. The horse, too, was lying by itself, having been killed  by the fall. And the man lay apart from them, having been killed by  the fall.    Picking up the body of the chief's son, he put it in the hollow skin.  Then he pulled many times on the cord.    But when the young man went down, strange to say, he did not ask  favors for himself. And they rejoiced because he had put the chief's  son in the hollow skin. Having brought up the dead man they forgot the  living one.    Though he sat waiting for the hollow skin to come down again, he was  not drawn up. So he sat wailing.    Now the chief had promised him his daughter to go down into the pit.  \"If you bring my son back, you shall marry her,\" he had said.    The young man wandered about in the darkness. At length when walking  along the trail, he came suddenly upon an old woman.    \"Venerable woman, though this land is very difficult to reach, I have  come hither. I came to the hole in the ground above. One person came  hither, having fallen into this pit. I came to take him back. They  have not drawn me up; and I have no way of going back. Venerable  woman, help me.\" So he spoke.    \"There is nothing that I can do to help you,\" she said. \"A person is  in that place, out of sight. Go there. He is the one who will do it  for you.\"    He went there. When he arrived, he knocked repeatedly on the door.  Though he stood hearing them speaking, they did not open the door for  him.    The woman said, \"Fie! A person has come. Open the door for him.\"    Behold! The man's child was dead, and therefore he sat without  speaking. He sat still, being sad. Then the young man arrived within  the lodge, the woman having opened the door for him. Yet her husband  sat without speaking. The young man was impatient from hunger. The  husband questioned him:    \"From what place have you walked?\" he asked.    The young man told his story. \"I walked up above, but a man headed off  the herd, and having fallen, he came here. I came here to take him  back. They did not take me back; I have no way of going back. Help  me,\" he said.    The man said, \"We had a child, but it died. We will treat you just  like the child who died.\" He meant he would adopt him. \"All things  which I have are yours,\" said the father.    The young man did not speak. He wished to go homeward.    \"Whatever you say I will do it for you,\" said the father. \"Even if you  desire to go homeward, it shall be so,\" he said.    At last the young man spoke of going homeward.    \"If you say, 'I will go homeward riding a horse of such a color, O  father!' it shall be so,\" said the father.    \"Fie!\" said the woman. \"Heretofore we were deprived of our child. The  young man who has just come home is like him. Give him one thing which  you have.\"    \"I make you my child. I will give you something. Whatever I desire I  always make with it, when I wish to have anything,\" said the father.  He had a piece of iron and when he wished anything he used to point at  the iron.    \"O father, I wish to go homeward riding a horse with very white hair.  I also desire a mule with very white hair, and a good saddle,\" said  the young man.    \"Come, go there. Open the door of that stable. When you wish to see  us again, you shall see us. When you will go homeward, you will say,  'Come, O father, I desire to go homeward,'\" said the father.    The young man went homeward. He made the rocks open suddenly by  pointing at them with the iron. He went up, making the ground echo  under the horse's feet. When he pushed aside a very large rock which  was in his way, he found himself again on the surface of the earth.  The horse and mule were very sudden in their movements. They shied at  every step. They sniffed the odor of a bad land.    The young man found his nation that he had left. Behold! they had  recently removed and departed. After they waited some time for him to  appear, they had removed their camp and departed. The horse and mule  went along, fearing the sight of the old camping ground. They followed  the trail of the departing village.    Then the young man saw two people on a large hill, walking in the  trail. They were the head chief and his wife who were walking along,  mourning for the dead.    They looked behind and said, \"Yonder comes one on horseback, following  the trail made by the departing village.\"    He drew near. They sat waiting for him to appear. The horse and mule  feared the sight of them; they sniffed a bad odor.    \"Why! Of what nation are you?\" asked the chief.    \"It is I,\" said the young man.    \"But which one are you?\" said the chief.    \"Your son went headlong into a pit when they surrounded the herd,\"  said the young man. \"And I went down to get him. You did not bring me  back. It is I.\"    As he was very much changed, the old man doubted.    \"Fie! Tell the truth about yourself.\"    \"When they surrounded the herd, your son went headlong as well as the  buffalo, and he was killed by falling into a pit. When you commanded  them to get him, they drew back through fear. I am he who went to get  him when you offered your daughter as a reward,\" said the young man.  \"I have hardly been able to come again to the surface.\"    Then they recognized him. The two men stood talking together on the  large hill. The chief's son looked back from the camp.    \"Why! The chief and his wife have come as far as the large hill and a  man on horseback has come, too. He stands talking to them. I will go  thither. Let me see! I will go to see them.\"    He went back on horseback and came to his father.    \"With what person do you talk?\" said the son.    \"Why!

I would not live alway; I ask not to stay,  Where I must bear the burden and heat of the day:  Where my body is cut with the lash or the cord,  And a hovel and hunger are all my reward.

OUR PILGRIM FATHERS.    Words by Pierpont. Music from \"Minstrel Boy,\" by G.W.C.      [Music]    Our Pilgrim Fathers--where are they?    The waves that brought them o'er,  Still roll in the bay, and throw their spray    As they break along the shore;  Still roll in the bay, as they rolled that day,    When the Mayflower moored below;  When the sea around was black with storms,    And white the shore with snow.    The mists that wrapped the Pilgrim's sleep,    Still brood upon the tide;  And his rocks yet keep their watch by the deep,    To stay its waves of pride.  But the snow-white sail, that she gave to the gale    When the heavens looked dark, is gone;  As an angel's wing, through an opening cloud,    Is seen, and then withdrawn.    The Pilgrim exile--sainted name!    The hill, whose icy brow  Rejoiced when he came in the morning's flame,    In the morning's flame burns now.  And the moon's cold light, as it lay that night,    On the hill-side and the sea,  Still lies where he laid his houseless head;    But the Pilgrim--where is he?    The Pilgrim Fathers are at rest;    When Summer's throned on high,  And the world's warm breast is in verdure dressed,    Go, stand on the hill where they lie.  The earliest ray of the golden day,    On that hallowed spot is cast;  And the evening sun as he leaves the world,    Looks kindly on that spot last.    The Pilgrim _spirit_ has not fled--    It walks in noon's broad light;  And it watches the bed of the glorious dead,    With the holy stars, by night.  It watches the bed of the brave who have bled,    And shall guard this ice-bound shore,  Till the waves of the bay, where the Mayflower lay,    Shall foam and freeze no more.          STANZAS FOR THE TIMES.    Words by J.G. Whittier. Music by G.W.C.      [Music]    Is this the land our fathers loved,    The freedom which they toiled to win?  Is this the soil whereon they moved?    Are these the graves they slumber in?  Are we the sons by whom are borne,  The mantles which the dead have won?    And shall we crouch above these graves,    With craven soul and fettered lip?  Yoke in with marked and branded slaves,    And tremble at the driver's whip?  Bend to the earth our pliant knees,  And speak--but as our masters please?    Shall outraged Nature cease to feel?    Shall Mercy's tears no longer flow?  Shall ruffian threats of cord and steel--    The dungeon's gloom--th' assassin's blow,  Turn back the spirit roused to save  The Truth--our Country--and the Slave?    Of human skulls that shrine was made,    Round which the priests of Mexico  Before their loathsome idol prayed--    Is Freedom's altar fashioned so?  And must we yield to Freedom's God  As offering meet, the negro's blood?    Shall tongues be mute, when deeds are wrought    Which well might shame extremest Hell?  Shall freemen lock th' indignant thought?    Shall Mercy's bosom cease to swell?  Shall Honor bleed?--Shall Truth succumb?  Shall pen, and press, and soul be dumb?    No--by each spot of haunted ground,    Where Freedom weeps her children's fall--  By Plymouth's rock--and Bunker's mound--    By Griswold's stained and shattered wall--  By Warren's ghost--by Langdon's shade--  By all the memories of our dead!    By their enlarging souls, which burst    The bands and fetters round them set--  By the free Pilgrim spirit nursed    Within our inmost bosoms, yet,--  By all above--around--below--  Be ours the indignant answer--no!    No--guided by our country's laws,    For truth, and right, and suffering man,  Be ours to strive in Freedom's cause,    As Christians may--as freemen can!  Still pouring on unwilling ears  That truth oppression only fears.          TO THOSE I LOVE.    Words by Miss E.M. Chandler. Music from an old air by G.W.C.      [Music]    Oh, turn ye not displeased away, though I should sometimes seem  Too much to press upon your ear, an oft repeated theme;  The story of the negro's wrongs is heavy at my heart,  And can I choose but wish from you a sympathizing part?    I turn to you to share my joy,--to soothe me in my grief--  In wayward sadness from your smiles, I seek a sweet relief:  And shall I keep this burning wish to see the slave set free,  Locked darkly in my secret heart, unshared and silently?    If I had been a friendless thing--if I had never known,  How swell the fountains of the heart beneath affection's tone,  I might have, careless, seen the leaf torn rudely from its stem,  But clinging as I do to you, can I but feel for them?    I could not brook to list the sad sweet music of a bird,  Though it were sweeter melody than ever ear hath heard,  If cruel hands had quenched its light, that in the plaintive song,  It might the breathing memory of other days prolong.    And can I give my lip to taste the life-bought luxuries, wrung  From those on whom a darker night of anguish has been flung--  Or silently and selfishly enjoy my better lot,  While those whom God hath bade me love, are wretched and forgot?    Oh no!--so blame me not, sweet friends, though I should sometimes seem  Too much to press upon your ear an oft repeated theme;  The story of the negro's wrongs hath won me from my rest,--  And I must strive to wake for him an interest in your breast!          WE'RE COMING! WE'RE COMING!    Air, \"Kinloch of Kinloch.\"      [Music]    We're coming, we're coming, the fearless and free,  Like the winds of the desert, the waves of the sea!  True sons of brave sires who battled of yore,  When England's proud lion ran wild on our shore!  We're coming, we're coming, from mountain and glen,  With hearts to do battle for freedom again;  Oppression is trembling as trembled before,  The Slavery which fled from our fathers of yore.    We're coming, we're coming, with banners unfurled,  Our motto is FREEDOM, our country the world;  Our watchword is LIBERTY--tyrants beware!  For the liberty army will bring you despair!  We're coming, we're coming, we'll come from afar,  Our standard we'll nail to humanity's car;  With shoutings we'll raise it, in triumph to wave,  A trophy of conquest, or shroud for the brave.    Then arouse ye, brave hearts, to the rescue come on!  The man-stealing army we'll surely put down;  They are crushing their millions, but soon they must yield,  For _freemen_ have _risen_ and taken the field.  Then arouse ye! arouse ye! the fearless and free,  Like the winds of the desert, the waves of the sea;  Let the north, west, and east, to the sea-beaten shore,  _Resound_ with a _liberty triumph_ once more.          ROUSE UP, NEW ENGLAND.    Words by a Yankee. Music by G.W.C.      [Music]    Rouse up, New England! Buckle on your mail of proof sublime,  Your stern old hate of tyranny, your deep contempt of crime;  A traitor plot is hatching now, more full of woe and shame,  Than ever from the iron heart of bloodiest despot came.    Six slave States added at a breath! One flourish of a pen,  And fetters shall be riveted on millions more of men!  One drop of ink to sign a name, and slavery shall find  For all her surplus flesh and blood, a market to her mind!    A market where good Democrats their fellow men may sell!  O, what a grin of fiendish glee runs round and round thro' hell!  How all the damned leap up for joy and half forget their fire,  To think men take such pains to claim the notice of God's ire.    Is't not enough that we have borne the sneer of all the world,  And bent to those whose haughty lips in scorn of us are curled?  Is't not enough that we must hunt their living chattels back,  And cheer the hungry bloodhounds on, that howl upon their track?    Is't not enough that we must bow to all that they decree,--  These cotton and tobacco lords, these pimps of slavery?  That we must yield our conscience up to glut Oppression's maw,  And break our faith with God to keep the letter of Man's law?    But must we sit in silence by, and see the chain and whip  Made firmer for all time to come in Slavery's bloody grip!  Must we not only half the guilt and all the shame endure,  But help to make our tyrant's throne of flesh and blood secure?    Is water running in our veins? Do we remember still  Old Plymouth rock, and Lexington, and glorious Bunker Hill?  The debt we owe our Father's graves? and to the yet unborn,  Whose heritage ourselves must make a thing of pride or scorn?    Grey Plymouth rock hath yet a tongue, and Concord is not dumb,  And voices from our father's graves, and from the future come;  They call on us to stand our ground, they charge us still to be  Not only free from chains ourselves, but foremost to make free!
