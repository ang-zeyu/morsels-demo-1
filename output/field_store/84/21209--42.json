Still we could not tell what might happen, and the  time was an anxious one.  At last, when I found how beautifully the  schooner was behaving, I determined to call my wife and daughters up,  that they might witness a sight which I certainly hoped they might never  have to look on again.  I slid back the companion hatch and called them.  My wife would not venture to move, but Mary and Susan came up.  They  stood for a minute or more with their eyes opening and very pale; Mary  holding my arm, Susan her brother's.    \"I called you girls to show you what the ocean is like sometimes,  happily not very often.\"    Mary continued silent for some time.  At last she gasped out, \"Oh,  father, what nothings we are!\"    \"That's what many a seaman feels, even on board a line-of-battle ship,  when in a sea like this, though he doesn't say it,\" I remarked.  \"Yes,  Mary, we are indeed nothing, but we are in the hands of God, and He it  is with His wise laws governs the movement of every one of those vast  mountain billows.  Let but one of them in our track go out of its  course, and this little craft, ay, and the biggest afloat, would be  utterly overwhelmed and driven down by the tremendous weight of water  which would fall over her.\"    Mary stood gazing, lost in wonder, and not a little fear also, and  unable to speak.  However, when I proposed her going below again, she  was very unwilling to quit the deck.  \"I shall dream of this for many a  night,\" she said.    While I was speaking, I caught sight of a sail to the eastward.  I  looked for her again, as we rose to the top of the next sea, and pointed  her out to Peter.  \"Yes, father, sure enough there is a sail, and a  large craft too, though she has but little canvas set: we are nearing  her, I fancy.\"    The stranger was, however, nearing us, and as we occasionally got a  glimpse of her through our glasses, we saw that she had carried away her  main-topmast and mizzenmast, and that she was labouring much, running  before the wind with only a close-reefed fore-topsail set.  As far as we  could judge she looked indeed in some distress.  On she came towards us.  The wind now again increased, and the seas became more dangerous.  Fearing that one might break over us, I sent Mary and Susan and the boys  below again, and secured the hatches over them; which done, we passed  life lines fore and aft, to give us a holdfast in case of accidents.  The stranger drew nearer and nearer.  We now saw how deep she was in the  water, and how terribly she was labouring.  I watched her with double  anxiety, on her account as well as on our own.  In another ten minutes  she would be down upon us, and from the course she was steering, it  would be a miracle if we escaped destruction.  Just then a signal of  distress was run up, but the flag was instantly blown away, and the next  minute she gave a plunge forward, and before she rose her remaining mast  went over the bows, where the spars hung seemingly engaged in battering  them in.  Scarcely had this occurred than she broached to, and lay like  a helpless log in the trough of the seas.  Still she was fearfully near,  and I was far from satisfied that she would not drive down upon us, and  if so, inevitably with one touch send us to the bottom.  Our only chance  of escape was to make sail, but the alternative was a dangerous one.  I  was preparing to do this when we saw those on board stretching out their  hands towards us imploring help.  It was a piteous sight, for none could  we afford, and all her own boats had, we saw, been washed away.  Now, as  we mounted to the summit of a sea, she began, it seemed, to climb up  another watery height, but a still vaster billow came rolling on, and  thundering over her deck; down she went beneath it, and the next moment,  when we looked, not a trace of her was to be seen except a few planks  and spars, which rose to the surface out of the vortex she formed as she  sank.  Yes, as we continued to gaze, between us and where she had been  floated a grating, and to it clung a human form.  He was alive, for he  turned his head towards us, as if beseeching us to save him.  It is  strange that we felt more eager to do so than we had been to save all  the poor beings who had just gone down before our eyes.  The reason was  plain; in the first instance we knew that we could not help them; there  seemed a possibility that we might rescue the person now floating so  close to us.  He was being cast by the sea nearer and nearer to us.  We  got ropes ready at either end of the vessel to heave to him.  Peter  fastened one round his own waist.  \"Take care, Peter,\" said I.    \"He may not be able to seize a rope, father, as he drives by, and I may  have a chance of getting hold of him,\" he answered.    I couldn't deny him, but I trembled for my son's safety; still, when a  right thing is to be done, when life is to be saved, we must not be too  nice about calculating the loss we may suffer.  Now we thought that the  stranger would be driven away from us, now again he was washed towards  the schooner; if our feelings of anxiety were intense, how much greater  must his have been?  Now he appeared on the foaming summit of a sea far  above us, then he went sinking down deep into the gulf below.  Truly  there seemed to be a power above guiding him.  I can have no doubt there  was.  Suddenly a sea drove him close to the schooner; I thought for a  moment that it would have actually washed him on board.  \"Hold on,\"  cried Peter, springing into the foaming water; and before the drowning  man was carried away again he had grasped him by the shoulders, the man  still holding to the raft.  Thus together they were towed alongside, and  Peter holding on to the man with a strength which I scarcely supposed he  possessed, they were hauled up on deck.  The stranger immediately  fainted, and Peter was in a very little better condition for a short  time; however, he soon recovered.  The stranger we took below, and by  rubbing his body with hot flannels, putting bags of sand made hot to his  feet and hands, and pouring a little weak brandy and water down his  throat, he at length, to our great satisfaction, came round.  He  remained in bed all that day and the next, and I wouldn't let him say  anything, not even to tell us who he was, greatly to the disappointment  of my wife and daughters, who were naturally curious to know.        CHAPTER FIVE.    CHARLEY WHITE.    One thought the stranger was a cabin passenger--another, an officer of  the ship--another, a seaman; and Mary observed, that supposing he was a  steerage passenger without a farthing in the world, it was equally our  duty to take the best care we could of him.    \"I hope that he isn't quite a gentleman,\" said Susan, \"because, if he  is, he'll be thinking himself above us.\"    \"Not if he has right feeling,\" remarked Mary.  \"I cannot see why we  should fancy that people are always considering whether they are above  or below each other, or better or worse than one another.  I know that  the Bible tells us to consider each person better than ourselves, and,  in another place, not to mind high things, but to condescend to men of  low estate.  If people obeyed that rule, there wouldn't be the disputes  and quarrels there are between neighbours.  I wonder if we shall find  that sort of thing out in Australia.\"    \"I am afraid that a voyage half round the world won't change people's  hearts,\" said I; \"the only difference is, that people have so much to do  and think of, they have no time to attend to the private concerns of  others; and so I hope that they keep on good terms at all events with  their neighbours.\"    \"Do you think, father, that a voyage quite round the world, or twice  round, would change a man's heart?\" asked John; \"I should think it  ought.\"    \"No, John, I am very certain that it would not,\" remarked his mother,  now first joining in the conversation; \"there is but one way by which a  man's heart can change, and that is through God's Holy Spirit, to be  obtained through His grace by earnest prayer.\"    My wife knew the truth, and showed that she did, not only by her words  but by her life.    \"Well, sisters, to relieve your minds about the young stranger whom I  hauled out of the water,\" said Peter; \"I'm pretty certain that he is a  gentleman, judging by a few words he uttered as I caught hold of him.  His first object seemed to be to thank me for the risk I was running to  save him.  However, we shall see.\"    The young stranger recovered sufficiently to talk without risk before  the gale was over, and he then told us that his name was Charles White,  that he was fourth officer of the ship we had seen go down--a homeward  bound Indiaman--that he was an orphan, with very few friends in England  or anywhere else; \"Indeed,\" he added, \"had I shared the fate of my  shipmates, there would have been but a small quantity of salt tears shed  or crape worn for me; but I am wrong,--there is one who would have  mourned for me; oh, if you knew her, such a good creature--Aunt  Priscilla; she was my mother's aunt; she has never married; Miss Beamish  she is called.  I believe that I am the only human male-being she cares  for, except two tom cats and a dog, and one of them isn't a tom; at  least, it had kittens, and they are not human either.  Whenever I go  home, I always go and see Aunt Priscilla, and carry her all sorts of  things, and feed the cats, and take the little dog out to walk; but when  I went, I never intended to stay there long, because, you see, she and I  are not much of companions to each other, and yet, somehow or other,  what with telling her my adventures, and reading to her, and playing  backgammon and such like"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2306"],[0,"Uncle Remus, His Songs and His Sayings (#6)"],[1," de gals a smokin' er his seegyar wid  mo' proudness dan w'at you mos' ever see.

But he des might ez well er rastle wid his own shadder.  Every time he hump hisse'f Brer Rabbit slap de spurrers in 'im,  en dar dey had it, up en down.

In the country districts, order was kept on the     plantations at night by the knowledge that they were liable     to be visited at any moment by the patrols. Hence a song     current among the negroes, the chorus of which was:         \"Run, nigger, run; patter-roller ketch you--        Run, nigger, run; hit's almos' day.\"      VIII. MR. FOX IS \"OUTDONE\" BY MR. BUZZARD    \"EF I don't run inter no mistakes,\" remarked Uncle Remus, as the  little boy came tripping in to see him after supper, \"Mr. Tukkey  Buzzard wuz gyardin' de holler whar Brer Rabbit went in at, en  w'ich he come out un.\"    The silence of the little boy verified the old man's  recollection.    \"Well, Mr. Buzzard, he feel mighty lonesome, he did, but he done  prommust Brer Fox dat he'd stay, en he 'termin' fer ter sorter  hang 'roun' en jine in de joke. En he ain't hatter wait long,  nudder, kase bimeby yer come Brer Fox gallopin' thoo de woods wid  his axe on his shoulder.    \"'How you speck Brer Rabbit gittin' on, Brer Buzzard?' sez Brer  Fox, sezee.    \"'Oh, he in dar,' sez Brer Buzzard, sezee. 'He mighty still,  dough. I speck he takin' a nap,' sezee.    \"'Den I'm des in time fer ter wake im up, sez Brer Fox, sezee. En  wid dat he fling off his coat, en spit in his han's, en grab de  axe. Den he draw back en come down on de tree--pow! En eve'y time  he come down wid de axe--pow!--Mr. Buzzard, he step high, he did,  en holler out:    \"'Oh, he in dar, Brer Fox. He in dar, sho.'    \"En eve'y time a chip ud fly off, Mr. Buzzard, he'd jump, en  dodge, en hol' his head sideways, he would, en holler:    \"'He in dar, Brer Fox. I done heerd 'im.

Den Mr. Buzzard squall out,  sezee:    \"'Lemme 'lone, Brer Fox. Tu'n me loose,' sezee; 'Brer Rabbit 'll  git out. You er gittin' close at 'im,' sezee, 'en leb'm mo'  licks'll fetch 'im,' sezee.    \"'I'm nigher ter you, Brer Buzzard,' sez Brer Fox, sezee, 'dan  I'll be ter Brer Rabbit dis day,' sezee.

You'll year whar he went en how he come out. Dish yer  col' snap rastles wid my bones, now,\" continued the old man,  putting on his hat and picking up his walking-stick. \"Hit rastles  wid me monstus, en I gotter rack 'roun' en see if I kin run up  agin some Chris'mus leavin's.\"      IX.  MISS COW FALLS A VICTIM TO MR. RABBIT    \"UNCLE REMUS,\" said the little boy, \"what became of the Rabbit  after he fooled the Buzzard, and got out of the hollow tree?\"    \"Who? Brer Rabbit?
