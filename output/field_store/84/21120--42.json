BUENA VISTA BATTLEFIELD        On Buena Vista battlefield    A dying soldier lay,    His thoughts were on his mountain home    Some thousand miles away.    He called his comrade to his side,    For much he had to say,    In briefest words to those who were    Some thousand miles away.      \"My father, comrade, you will tell    About this bloody fray;    My country's flag, you'll say to him,    Was safe with me to-day.    I make a pillow of it now    On which to lay my head,    A winding sheet you'll make of it    When I am with the dead.      \"I know 'twill grieve his inmost soul    To think I never more    Will sit with him beneath the oak    That shades the cottage door;    But tell that time-worn patriot,    That, mindful of his fame,    Upon this bloody battlefield    I sullied not his name.      \"My mother's form is with me now,    Her will is in my ear,    And drop by drop as flows my blood    So flows from her the tear.    And oh, when you shall tell to her    The tidings of this day,    Speak softly, comrade, softly speak    What you may have to say.      \"Speak not to her in blighting words    The blighting news you bear,    The cords of life might snap too soon,    So, comrade, have a care.    I am her only, cherished child,    But tell her that I died    Rejoicing that she taught me young    To take my country's side.      \"But, comrade, there's one more,    She's gentle as a fawn;    She lives upon the sloping hill    That overlooks the lawn,    The lawn where I shall never more    Go forth with her in merry mood    To gather wild-wood flowers.      \"Tell her when death was on my brow    And life receding fast,    Her looks, her form was with me then,    Were with me to the last.    On Buena Vista's bloody field    Tell her I dying lay,    And that I knew she thought of me    Some thousand miles away.\"          WESTWARD HO        I love not Colorado    Where the faro table grows,    And down the desperado    The rippling Bourbon flows;      Nor seek I fair Montana    Of bowie-lunging fame;    The pistol ring of fair Wyoming    I leave to nobler game.      Sweet poker-haunted Kansas    In vain allures the eye;    The Nevada rough has charms enough    Yet its blandishments I fly.      Shall Arizona woo me    Where the meek Apache bides?    Or New Mexico where natives grow    With arrow-proof insides?      Nay, 'tis where the grizzlies wander    And the lonely diggers roam,    And the grim Chinese from the squatter flees    That I'll make my humble home.      I'll chase the wild tarantula    And the fierce cayote I'll dare,    And the locust grim, I'll battle him    In his native wildwood lair.      Or I'll seek the gulch deserted    And dream of the wild Red man,    And I'll build a cot on a corner lot    And get rich as soon as I can.          A HOME ON THE RANGE        Oh, give me a home where the buffalo roam,    Where the deer and the antelope play,    Where seldom is heard a discouraging word    And the skies are not cloudy all day.        Home, home on the range,      Where the deer and the antelope play;      Where seldom is heard a discouraging word      And the skies are not cloudy all day.      Where the air is so pure, the zephyrs so free,    The breezes so balmy and light,    That I would not exchange my home on the range    For all of the cities so bright.      The red man was pressed from this part of the West,    He's likely no more to return    To the banks of Red River where seldom if ever    Their flickering camp-fires burn.      How often at night when the heavens are bright    With the light from the glittering stars,    Have I stood here amazed and asked as I gazed    If their glory exceeds that of ours.      Oh, I love these wild flowers in this dear land of ours,    The curlew I love to hear scream,    And I love the white rocks and the antelope flocks    That graze on the mountain-tops green.      Oh, give me a land where the bright diamond sand    Flows leisurely down the stream;    Where the graceful white swan goes gliding along    Like a maid in a heavenly dream.      Then I would not exchange my home on the range,    Where the deer and the antelope play;    Where seldom is heard a discouraging word    And the skies are not cloudy all day.        Home, home on the range,      Where the deer and the antelope play;      Where seldom is heard a discouraging word      And the skies are not cloudy all day.        Home on the Range (Mus. Not.)        Oh, give me a home where the buf-fa-lo roam,    Where the deer and the an-te-lope play;...    Where sel-dom is heard a dis-cour-ag-ing word    And the skies are not cloud-y all day.    Home, home on the range, Where the deer and the antelope play;    Where sel-dom is heard a dis-cour-ag-ing word    And the skies are not cloud-y all day.          TEXAS RANGERS        Come, all you Texas rangers, wherever you may be,    I'll tell you of some troubles that happened unto me.    My name is nothing extra, so it I will not tell,--    And here's to all you rangers, I am sure I wish you well.      It was at the age of sixteen that I joined the jolly band,    We marched from San Antonio down to the Rio Grande.    Our captain he informed us, perhaps he thought it right,    \"Before we reach the station, boys, you'll surely have to fight.\"      And when the bugle sounded our captain gave command,    \"To arms, to arms,\" he shouted, \"and by your horses stand.\"    I saw the smoke ascending, it seemed to reach the sky;    The first thought that struck me, my time had come to die.      I saw the Indians coming, I heard them give the yell;    My feelings at that moment, no tongue can ever tell.    I saw the glittering lances, their arrows round me flew,    And all my strength it left me and all my courage too.      We fought full nine hours before the strife was o'er,    The like of dead and wounded I never saw before.    And when the sun was rising and the Indians they had fled,    We loaded up our rifles and counted up our dead.      And all of us were wounded, our noble captain slain,    And the sun was shining sadly across the bloody plain.    Sixteen as brave rangers as ever roamed the West    Were buried by their comrades with arrows in their breast.      'Twas then I thought of mother, who to me in tears did say,    \"To you they are all strangers, with me you had better stay.\"    I thought that she was childish, the best she did not know;    My mind was fixed on ranging and I was bound to go.      Perhaps you have a mother, likewise a sister too,    And maybe you have a sweetheart to weep and mourn for you;    If that be your situation, although you'd like to roam,    I'd advise you by experience, you had better stay at home.      I have seen the fruits of rambling, I know its hardships well;    I have crossed the Rocky Mountains, rode down the streets of hell;    I have been in the great Southwest where the wild Apaches roam,    And I tell you from experience you had better stay at home.      And now my song is ended; I guess I have sung enough;    The life of a ranger I am sure is very tough.    And here's to all you ladies, I am sure I wish you well,    I am bound to go a-ranging, so ladies, fare you well.          THE MORMON BISHOP'S LAMENT        I am a Mormon bishop and I will tell you what I know.    I joined the confraternity some forty years ago.    I then had youth upon my brow and eloquence my tongue,    But I had the sad misfortune then to meet with Brigham Young.      He said, \"Young man, come join our band and bid hard work farewell,    You are too smart to waste your time in toil by hill and dell;    There is a ripening harvest and our hooks shall find the fool    And in the distant nations we shall train them in our school.\"      I listened to his preaching and I learned all the role,    And the truth of Mormon doctrines burned deep within my soul.    I married sixteen women and I spread my new belief,    I was sent to preach the gospel to the pauper and the thief.      'Twas in the glorious days when Brigham was our only Lord and King,    And his wild cry of defiance from the Wasatch tops did ring,    'Twas when that bold Bill Hickman and that Porter Rockwell led,    And in the blood atonements the pits received the dead.      They took in Dr. Robertson and left him in his gore,    And the Aiken brothers sleep in peace on Nephi's distant shore.    We marched to Mountain Meadows and on that glorious field    With rifle and with hatchet we made man and woman yield.      'Twas there we were victorious with our legions fierce and brave.    We left the butchered victims on the ground without a grave.    We slew the load of emigrants on Sublet's lonely road    And plundered many a trader of his then most precious load.      Alas for all the powers that were in the by-gone time.    What we did as deeds of glory are condemned as bloody crime.    No more the blood atonements keep the doubting one in fear,    While the faithful were rewarded with a wedding once a year.      As the nation's chieftain president says our days of rule are o'er    And his marshals with their warrants are on watch at every door,    Old John he now goes skulking on the by-roads of our land,    Or unknown he keeps in hiding with the faithful of our band.      Old Brigham now is stretched beneath the cold and silent clay,    And the chieftains now are fallen that were mighty in their day;    Of the six and twenty women that I wedded long ago    There are two now left to cheer me in these awful hours of woe.    The rest are scattered where the Gentile's flag's unfurled    And two score of my daughters are now numbered with the world.      Oh, my poor old bones are aching and my head is turning gray;    Oh, the scenes were black and awful that I've witnessed in        my day.    Let my spirit seek the mansion where old Brigham's gone to dwell,    For there's no place for Mormons but the lowest pits"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2131"],[0,"An Account of Egypt (#6)"],[1,"if it has been cut with the knife of a Hellene. And the cattle of  this kind which die they bury in the following manner:--the females they  cast into the river, but the males they bury, each people in the suburb  of their town, with one of the horns, or sometimes both, protruding to  mark the place; and when the bodies have rotted away and the appointed  time comes on, then to each city comes a boat from that which is called  the island of Prosopitis (this is in the Delta, and the extent of its  circuit is nine _schoines_). In this island of Prosopitis is situated,  besides many other cities, that one from which the boats come to take up  the bones of the oxen, and the name of the city is Atarbechis, and in  it there is set up a holy temple of Aphrodite. From this city many go  abroad in various directions, some to one city and others to another,  and when they have dug up the bones of the oxen they carry them off, and  coming together they bury them in one single place. In the same manner  as they bury the oxen they bury also their other cattle when they die;  for about them also they have the same law laid down, and these also  they abstain from killing.    Now all who have a temple set up to the Theban Zeus or who are of the  district of Thebes, these, I say, all sacrifice goats and abstain from  sheep: for not all the Egyptians equally reverence the same gods,  except only Isis and Osiris (who they say is Dionysos), these they all  reverence alike: but they who have a temple of Mendes or belong to the  Mendesian district, these abstain from goats and sacrifice sheep. Now  the men of Thebes and those who after their example abstain from sheep,  say that this custom was established among them for the cause which  follows:--Heracles (they say) had an earnest desire to see Zeus, and  Zeus did not desire to be seen of him; and at last when Heracles was  urgent in entreaty Zeus contrived this device, that is to say, he flayed  a ram and held in front of him the head of the ram which he had cut off,  and he put on over him the fleece and then showed himself to him. Hence  the Egyptians make the image of Zeus with the face of a ram; and the  Ammonians do so also after their example, being settlers both from  the Egyptians and from the Ethiopians, and using a language which is a  medley of both tongues: and in my opinion it is from this god that the  Egyptians call Zeus _Amun_. The Thebans then do not sacrifice rams but  hold them sacred for this reason; on one day however in the year, on the  feast of Zeus, they cut up in the same manner and flay one single ram  and cover with its skin the image of Zeus, and then they bring up to  it another image of Heracles. This done, all who are in the temple beat  themselves in lamentation for the ram, and then they bury it in a sacred  tomb.    About Heracles I heard the account given that he was of the number of  the twelve gods; but of the other Heracles whom the Hellenes know I was  not able to hear in any part of Egypt: and moreover to prove that the  Egyptians did not take the name of Heracles from the Hellenes, but  rather the Hellenes from the Egyptians,--that is to say those of the  Hellenes who gave the name Heracles to the son of Amphitryon,--of that,  I say, besides many other evidences there is chiefly this, namely that  the parents of this Heracles, Amphitryon and Alcmene, were both of Egypt  by descent, and also that the Egyptians say that they do not know  the names either of Poseidon or of the Dioscuroi, nor have these been  accepted by them as gods among the other gods; whereas if they had  received from the Hellenes the name of any divinity, they would  naturally have preserved the memory of these most of all, assuming that  in those times as now some of the Hellenes were wont to make voyages  and were seafaring folk, as I suppose and as my judgment compels me to  think; so that the Egyptians would have learnt the names of these gods  even more than that of Heracles. In fact however Heracles is a very  ancient Egyptian god; and (as they say themselves) it is seventeen  thousand years to the beginning of the reign of Amasis from the time  when the twelve gods, of whom they count that Heracles is one, were  begotten of the eight gods. I moreover, desiring to know something  certain of these matters so far as might be, made a voyage also to  Tyre of Phenicia, hearing that in that place there was a holy temple  of Heracles; and I saw that it was richly furnished with many votive  offerings besides, and especially there were in it two pillars, the one  of pure gold and the other of an emerald stone of such size as to shine  by night: and having come to speech with the priests of the god, I asked  them how long a time it was since their temple had been set up: and  these also I found to be at variance with the Hellenes, for they said  that at the same time when Tyre was founded, the temple of the god also  had been set up, and that it was a period of two thousand three hundred  years since their people began to dwell at Tyre. I saw also at Tyre  another temple of Heracles, with the surname Thasian; and I came  to Thasos also and there I found a temple of Heracles set up by the  Phenicians, who had sailed out to seek for Europa and had colonised  Thasos; and these things happened full five generations of men before  Heracles the son of Amphitryon was born in Hellas. So then my inquiries  show clearly that Heracles is an ancient god, and those of the Hellenes  seem to me to act most rightly who have two temples of Heracles set  up, and who sacrifice to the one as an immortal god and with the  title Olympian, and make offerings of the dead to the other as a hero.  Moreover, besides many other stories which the Hellenes tell without  due consideration, this tale is especially foolish which they tell about  Heracles, namely that when he came to Egypt, the Egyptians put on him  wreaths and led him forth in procession to sacrifice him to Zeus; and he  for some time kept quiet, but when they were beginning the sacrifice of  him at the altar, he betook himself to prowess and slew them all. I for  my part am of opinion that the Hellenes when they tell this tale are  altogether without knowledge of the nature and customs of the Egyptians;  for how should they for whom it is not lawful to sacrifice even beasts,  except swine and the males of oxen and calves (such of them as are  clean) and geese, how should these sacrifice human beings? Besides this,  how is it in nature possible that Heracles, being one person only and  moreover a man (as they assert), should slay many myriads? Having said  so much of these matters, we pray that we may have grace from both the  gods and the heroes for our speech.    Now the reason why those of the Egyptians whom I have mentioned do not  sacrifice goats, female or male, is this:--the Mendesians count Pan to  be one of the eight gods (now these eight gods they say came into being  before the twelve gods), and the painters and image-makers represent in  painting and in sculpture the figure of Pan, just as the Hellenes do,  with goat's face and legs, not supposing him to be really like this but  to resemble the other gods; the cause however why they represent him in  this form I prefer not to say. The Mendesians then reverence all goats  and the males more than the females (and the goatherds too have  greater honour than other herdsmen), but of the goats one especially  is reverenced, and when he dies there is great mourning in all the  Mendesian district: and both the goat and Pan are called in the Egyptian  tongue _Mendes_. Moreover in my lifetime there happened in that district  this marvel, that is to say a he-goat had intercourse with a woman  publicly, and this was so done that all men might have evidence of it.    The pig is accounted by the Egyptians an abominable animal; and first,  if any of them in passing by touch a pig, he goes into the river and  dips himself forthwith in the water together with his garments; and then  too swineherds, though they may be native Egyptians, unlike all others,  do not enter any of the temples in Egypt, nor is anyone willing to give  his daughter in marriage to one of them or to take a wife from among  them; but the swineherds both give in marriage to one another and take  from one another. Now to the other gods the Egyptians do not think it  right to sacrifice swine; but to the Moon and to Dionysos alone at the  same time and on the same full-moon they sacrifice swine, and then eat  their flesh: and as to the reason why, when they abominate swine at all  their other feasts, they sacrifice them at this, there is a story told  by the Egyptians; and this story I know, but it is not a seemly one for  me to tell. Now the sacrifice of the swine to the Moon is performed as  follows:--when the priest has slain the victim, he puts together the  end of the tail and the spleen and the caul, and covers them up with the  whole of the fat of the animal which is about the paunch, and then he  offers them with fire; and the rest of the flesh they eat on that day of  full moon upon which they have held sacrifice, but on any day after this  they will not taste of it: the poor however among them by reason of the  scantiness of their means shape pigs of dough and having baked them they  offer these as a sacrifice. Then for Dionysos on the eve of the festival  each one kills a pig by cutting its throat before his own doors, and  after that he gives the pig to the swineherd who sold it to him, to  carry away again; and the rest of the feast of Dionysos is celebrated  by the Egyptians in the same way as by the Hellenes in almost all things  except choral dances, but instead of the _phallos_ they have invented  another contrivance, namely figures of about a cubit in height worked  by strings, which women carry about the villages, with the privy member  made to move and not much less in size than the rest of the body:"]]]
