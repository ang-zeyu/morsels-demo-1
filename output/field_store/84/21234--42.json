At that time salt-mining was the great industry in that part of West  Virginia, and the little town of Malden was right in the midst of  the salt-furnaces. My stepfather had already secured a job at a  salt-furnace, and he had also secured a little cabin for us to live  in. Our new house was no better than the one we had left on the  old plantation in Virginia. In fact, in one respect it was worse.  Notwithstanding the poor condition of our plantation cabin, we were at  all times sure of pure air. Our new home was in the midst of a cluster  of cabins crowded closely together, and as there were no sanitary  regulations, the filth about the cabins was often intolerable. Some of  our neighbours were coloured people, and some were the poorest and most  ignorant and degraded white people. It was a motley mixture. Drinking,  gambling, quarrels, fights, and shockingly immoral practices were  frequent. All who lived in the little town were in one way or another  connected with the salt business. Though I was a mere child, my  stepfather put me and my brother at work in one of the furnaces. Often I  began work as early as four o'clock in the morning.    The first thing I ever learned in the way of book knowledge was while  working in this salt-furnace. Each salt-packer had his barrels marked  with a certain number. The number allotted to my stepfather was \"18.\"  At the close of the day's work the boss of the packers would come around  and put \"18\" on each of our barrels, and I soon learned to recognize  that figure wherever I saw it, and after a while got to the point where  I could make that figure, though I knew nothing about any other figures  or letters.    From the time that I can remember having any thoughts about anything,  I recall that I had an intense longing to learn to read. I determined,  when quite a small child, that, if I accomplished nothing else in life,  I would in some way get enough education to enable me to read common  books and newspapers. Soon after we got settled in some manner in our  new cabin in West Virginia, I induced my mother to get hold of a book  for me. How or where she got it I do not know, but in some way she  procured an old copy of Webster's \"blue-back\" spelling-book, which  contained the alphabet, followed by such meaningless words as \"ab,\"  \"ba,\" \"ca,\" \"da.\" I began at once to devour this book, and I think that  it was the first one I ever had in my hands. I had learned from somebody  that the way to begin to read was to learn the alphabet, so I tried  in all the ways I could think of to learn it,--all of course without a  teacher, for I could find no one to teach me. At that time there was not  a single member of my race anywhere near us who could read, and I was  too timid to approach any of the white people. In some way, within a few  weeks, I mastered the greater portion of the alphabet. In all my efforts  to learn to read my mother shared fully my ambition, and sympathized  with me and aided me in every way that she could. Though she was totally  ignorant, she had high ambitions for her children, and a large fund of  good, hard, common sense, which seemed to enable her to meet and master  every situation. If I have done anything in life worth attention, I feel  sure that I inherited the disposition from my mother.    In the midst of my struggles and longing for an education, a young  coloured boy who had learned to read in the state of Ohio came to  Malden. As soon as the coloured people found out that he could read, a  newspaper was secured, and at the close of nearly every day's work  this young man would be surrounded by a group of men and women who were  anxious to hear him read the news contained in the papers. How I used to  envy this man! He seemed to me to be the one young man in all the world  who ought to be satisfied with his attainments.    About this time the question of having some kind of a school opened for  the coloured children in the village began to be discussed by members  of the race. As it would be the first school for Negro children that had  ever been opened in that part of Virginia, it was, of course, to be a  great event, and the discussion excited the wildest interest. The most  perplexing question was where to find a teacher. The young man from  Ohio who had learned to read the papers was considered, but his age was  against him. In the midst of the discussion about a teacher, another  young coloured man from Ohio, who had been a soldier, in some way found  his way into town. It was soon learned that he possessed considerable  education, and he was engaged by the coloured people to teach their  first school. As yet no free schools had been started for coloured  people in that section, hence each family agreed to pay a certain  amount per month, with the understanding that the teacher was to \"board  'round\"--that is, spend a day with each family. This was not bad for the  teacher, for each family tried to provide the very best on the day the  teacher was to be its guest. I recall that I looked forward with an  anxious appetite to the \"teacher's day\" at our little cabin.    This experience of a whole race beginning to go to school for the  first time, presents one of the most interesting studies that has ever  occurred in connection with the development of any race. Few people who  were not right in the midst of the scenes can form any exact idea of the  intense desire which the people of my race showed for an education. As  I have stated, it was a whole race trying to go to school. Few were too  young, and none too old, to make the attempt to learn. As fast as any  kind of teachers could be secured, not only were day-schools filled, but  night-schools as well. The great ambition of the older people was to try  to learn to read the Bible before they died. With this end in view men  and women who were fifty or seventy-five years old would often be found  in the night-school. Some day-schools were formed soon after  freedom, but the principal book studied in the Sunday-school was the  spelling-book. Day-school, night-school, Sunday-school, were always  crowded, and often many had to be turned away for want of room.    The opening of the school in the Kanawha Valley, however, brought to me  one of the keenest disappointments that I ever experienced. I had been  working in a salt-furnace for several months, and my stepfather had  discovered that I had a financial value, and so, when the school opened,  he decided that he could not spare me from my work. This decision seemed  to cloud my every ambition. The disappointment was made all the more  severe by reason of the fact that my place of work was where I could see  the happy children passing to and from school mornings and afternoons.  Despite this disappointment, however, I determined that I would learn  something, anyway. I applied myself with greater earnestness than ever  to the mastering of what was in the \"blue-back\" speller.    My mother sympathized with me in my disappointment, and sought to  comfort me in all the ways she could, and to help me find a way to  learn. After a while I succeeded in making arrangements with the teacher  to give me some lessons at night, after the day's work was done. These  night lessons were so welcome that I think I learned more at night  than the other children did during the day. My own experiences in the  night-school gave me faith in the night-school idea, with which, in  after years, I had to do both at Hampton and Tuskegee. But my boyish  heart was still set upon going to the day-school, and I let no  opportunity slip to push my case. Finally I won, and was permitted to go  to the school in the day for a few months, with the understanding that  I was to rise early in the morning and work in the furnace till nine  o'clock, and return immediately after school closed in the afternoon for  at least two more hours of work.    The schoolhouse was some distance from the furnace, and as I had to work  till nine o'clock, and the school opened at nine, I found myself in  a difficulty. School would always be begun before I reached it, and  sometimes my class had recited. To get around this difficulty I yielded  to a temptation for which most people, I suppose, will condemn me; but  since it is a fact, I might as well state it. I have great faith in the  power and influence of facts. It is seldom that anything is permanently  gained by holding back a fact. There was a large clock in a little  office in the furnace. This clock, of course, all the hundred or more  workmen depended upon to regulate their hours of beginning and ending  the day's work. I got the idea that the way for me to reach school on  time was to move the clock hands from half-past eight up to the nine  o'clock mark. This I found myself doing morning after morning, till the  furnace \"boss\" discovered that something was wrong, and locked the clock  in a case. I did not mean to inconvenience anybody. I simply meant to  reach that schoolhouse in time.    When, however, I found myself at the school for the first time, I also  found myself confronted with two other difficulties. In the first place,  I found that all the other children wore hats or caps on their heads,  and I had neither hat nor cap. In fact, I do not remember that up to  the time of going to school I had ever worn any kind of covering upon  my head, nor do I recall that either I or anybody else had even thought  anything about the need of covering for my head. But, of course, when  I saw how all the other boys were dressed, I began to feel quite  uncomfortable. As usual, I put the case before my mother, and she  explained to me that she had no money with which to buy a \"store hat,\"  which was a rather new institution at that time among the members of my  race and was considered quite the thing for young and old to own,  but that she would find a way to help me out of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23770"],[0,"Mission Furniture: How to Make It, Part 1 (#6)"],[1,"es, blacking and a shoe rest, is shown in the  illustration. The stock can be secured mill-planed, sandpapered and in  lengths almost ready to be assembled. The stock list consists of the  following pieces:      4 posts, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 17 in.    4 side rails, 1 by 6-1/2 by 9-1/2 in.    2 top pieces, 1 by 8-1/4 by 16-1/2 in.    1 bottom, 1/4 by 9-1/2 by 9-1/2 in.    1 cleat, 1 by 1 by 18 in.    The posts and cleat are surfaced on four sides, while the other pieces  are surfaced on only two sides. The allowance of 1/2 in. on the side  rails, top and bottom, is for fitting the joints. Be sure the surfaces  of the pieces for the posts are square and the ends sawed square off,  making the posts exactly the same length when they come from the mill.    [Illustration: Details of Shoe Rest]    Square up the four side rails to 6 by 9 in. Cut one end of each post  tapering with a chisel; face and sandpaper the posts and side rails  before making the joints. The side rails are attached to the posts with  three dowels to each joint. The place for each dowel is located by  making a line exactly in the middle lengthwise on each end of each side  rail. Three lines are made to intersect this middle line, as shown in  the detail. Drive a 1/2-in. brad in each intersection allowing a small  portion of each brad to project, and cut off the heads. Gauge a line in  the middle of each post at the top where the joints are to be made and  press the end of a side rail containing the brads against the post. This  will mark the places to bore holes for the dowels. Pull out the brads  and bore holes for the dowel pins.    [Illustration: Details of Tabouret Construction]    When gluing up the side rails and posts, first put on a coat of glue on  the ends of the side rails and let it dry. This will fill up the pores  in the end grain of the wood which will make a strong joint when  finally glued together. The dowel pins are made 3/8 in. square with a  slight taper at the ends. These can be easily forced into the holes,  when the ends of the side rails are coated with glue and ready to be put  together, by clamps pressing on the outside of the posts.    The bottom is held in position with narrow strips tacked on the lower  edge of the side rails. Square up the top pieces to 8 by 16 in. and  fasten one piece to the top with cleats and screws as shown in the  drawing. The other piece is hinged to the first one with two 2-in.  hinges.    The shoe rest can be made from a block of wood and covered with sheet  tin, copper or brass, or a cast-iron rest can be purchased. The rest is  fastened to the under side of the hinged top. Stain the wood any dark  color and apply a very thin coat of shellac. Put on wax and you will  have a finish that can be renewed at any time by wiping with a little  turpentine and rewaxing.          HOW TO MAKE A ROLL TOP DESK      [Illustration: The Desk Complete]    The materials for this roll top desk can be purchased from a mill  dressed and sandpapered so the hardest part of the work will be  finished. The wood must be selected to suit the builder and to match  other articles of furniture. The following list of materials will be  required:       68 lineal ft. of 1 by 3 in. hardwood.     65 lineal ft. of 1 by 2 in. hardwood.      3 lineal ft. of 1/4 by 24 in. hardwood.     45 lineal ft. of 1/4 by 10-1/2 in. hardwood.     36 lineal ft. of 1 by 12 in. hardwood.     35 lineal ft. of 3/8 by 9 in. soft wood.    100 sq. ft. of 1/2 by 12 in. soft wood.      1 piece 34 in. wide and 54 in. long hardwood.     30 pieces 1 by 1 in. 48 in. long.    [Illustration]    The upper and lower back panels are constructed very similar, the only  difference being in the height. The inside edge of the 3-in. pieces is  plowed with a 1/4-in. plow 3/8 in. deep exactly in the center and also  both edges of each 2-in. piece. The 16-in. pieces in the upper back  panel and the 24-in. pieces in the lower back panel must be cut 1/2 in.  longer and a 1/4-in. tongue made on each end to fit into the plowed  groove and form a mortise joint.    The upper back panel is filled in with four boards 9-1/2 in. wide and  16-1/2 in. long, while the four boards in the lower back panel are 9-1/2  in. wide and 24-1/2 in. long cut from the 1/4-in. hard wood. When the  grooves are cut properly, the joints made perfect and the boards fitted  to the right size, these two panels can be assembled and pressed  together in cabinet clamps. This will make the outside dimensions as  given in the drawing.    The end panels are made very similar to the lower back panel, the only  difference being in the width of the filling boards, which are 10-1/2  in. for the outside end panels and 10 in. for the inside panels. One end  panel and one inside panel make the sides of one pedestal. As the end  panels are 1 in. wider than the inside panels they overlap the back  panel and cover up the rough ends of the boards. A 1-in. piece 2 in.  wide is fastened at the top and bottom of each end and inside panels as  shown by the dotted lines. The lower back panel is fastened on by  turning screws through the back and into the ends of these pieces. The  bottom pieces have 2-in. notches cut out, as shown, into which to fit  two crosspieces across the bottom of the pedestal for holding the  casters. The top end panels are made as shown in the drawing, the  inside edge of the pieces being plowed out, making a groove the same  size as in the other pieces of the panels. The panel board is cut to the  proper shape from the 1/4-by 24-in. material. The length given in the  material list will be sufficient if the pointed ends are allowed to pass  each other when laying out the design.    [Illustration]    Instead of cutting a groove for the roll top curtain, one is made by  fastening a 1/2-by 3/4-in. strip 7/8 in. down from the edge and on the  inside of the panel. A thin 1/4-by 1-3/4-in. strip is bent to form the  shape of the edge and fastened with round-headed brass screws. A 1-in.  piece is fastened at the back and a groove cut into it as shown by the  dotted line into which to slide a 1/4-in. back board. The top is a  12-in. board 54 in. long.    As both pedestals are made alike, the detail of only one is shown. The  partitions upon which the drawers slide are made up from 1-in. square  material with a 2-in. end fitted as shown. Dimensions are given for the  divisions of each drawer, but these can be changed to suit the builder.  The detail of one drawer is shown, giving the length and width, the  height being that of the top drawer. The roll top curtain is made up  from 1-in. pieces 3/4 in. thick and 48 in. long, cut in an oval shape on  the outside, tacked and glued to a piece of strong canvas on the inside.  The end piece is 2 in. wide, into which two lift holes or grooves are  cut and a lock attached in the middle of the edge. A drawer lock can be  made as shown and attached to the back panel and operated by the back  end of the roll top curtain when it is opened and closed.    The top board, which is 34 by 54 in., can be fitted with end pieces as  shown or left in one piece with the edges made rounding.    At this point in the construction of the parts they can be put together.  The sides of each pedestal are fastened together by screws passed  through the 1-in. square pieces forming the partition and into the sides  of the panels. When each pedestal is put together the lower back panel  is fastened to them with screws turned into the pieces provided as  stated in making the end panels. The top board is now adjusted with  equal edges projecting and fastened in position with finishing nails. As  the top panels cover directly over where the nails are driven, the heads  will not show. The upper back panel is fastened to the curved ends and  the whole top held to the top board with cast corner brackets that can  be purchased at any hardware store. The top should not be drawn  together too close before the 1/4-in. back board is put in the grooves  and the roll top curtain placed in position.    [Illustration]    The detail showing the pigeon holes gives sizes for 30 openings 3 by 4  in., two book stalls at the ends, 3 in. wide, and two small drawers.  This frame is built up as shown from the 3/8-in. soft wood, and fastened  in the back part of the top with small brads.          HOW TO MAKE A ROMAN CHAIR      In making this roman chair, as well as other articles of mission  furniture, the materials can be ordered from the mill with much of the  hard work completed. Order the stock to make this chair as follows:      4 posts, 1-7/8 by 1-7/8 by 30 in.    2 top rails, 7/8 by 2-3/4 by 20 in.    2 bottom rails, 7/8 by 2-1/4 by 20 in.    2 rails, 7/8 by 4 by 16 in.    2 side rails, 7/8 by 4 by 28 in.    1 stretcher, 7/8 by 3 by 30 in.    [Illustration: The Roman Chair]    Have all these pieces mill planed on the four sides straight and square,  also have them sandpapered on the four sides of each. Plain sawed white  or red oak finishes nicely and is easily obtained. The sizes are  specified exact as to thickness and width, but the lengths are longer  than is needed. This is to allow for cutting and fitting.    Begin by squaring one end of each post; measure the length 28 in. and,  placing all of them side by side, square a line across the four, saw,  then plane these ends square. The top and bottom side rails are treated  in a similar manner, their length being 19-1/8 in. each. These pieces  extend right through the posts projecting 5/8 in. beyond the surface.  The mortises in the posts must be cut smoothly and of exact size. Wood  pins fasten these rails and posts together. The other rails have tenons  1/2 by 3 in. shouldered on the two edges and one side. The mortise in  the post is placed central. On the ends of the chair the shouldered side  is turned in (see photograph), while on the front and back they are  turned out.
