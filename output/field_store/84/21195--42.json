He had done this work for some years in spare time, so he had  acquired considerable proficiency.    I would fain be able to describe some of the human interest, on such a  vessel as this; there is enough for many novelists to study for many a  day. Of each class at home we know individuals, soldiers and civilians,  and their women folk, and they are interesting as others or more so; but  when you see them like this on board their ship in their numbers, going  East to their various duties, the interest becomes quite a big thing.  There is the girl going to her future husband in a native regiment, not  to return for years, and there is a couple sitting beside us to-night in  the smoking-room--a white-haired Colonel and his young protege, a  budding soldier--they talk of mother at home, and cousins and aunts.  Then there's The-most-beautiful-girl-in-the-ship, but she is not  typical, and I think she goes farther East than India: she has chummed  already with the best set-up man on board, so that's as it should  be--and what an occasion it is for chumming! I'd like to know what is  the average number of engagements made and broken on these P. & O.'s per  voyage. R. tells me of one made in his last trip home; I forget on what  line. The passengers were eleven young men and one lady, and she  favoured one of them, so there were ten disappointed suitors. They found  He and She could sing a little, so one of the ten played accompaniments,  and the others encouraged the devoted pair to sing tender ditties, which  they did and for all they were worth. He sang, \"I want you, my Honey,\"  and put his back into it, as R. says, very slangily I think, and the  suitors thought they had great subject for much mirth when they retired  to the smoking-room--I think it was almost profane.... But it is time  for one pipe on deck and a last look at the somewhat uncongenial sea,  then to a bed, three or four inches too narrow.    [Illustration]    These two ladies here depicted are the sole survivors of their sex this  morning at breakfast, for it blows hard outside; but it's an ill wind  that blows nobody good, so these two young things, fresh as roses, made  each other's acquaintance at the empty table. They have been an hour on  deck, and like the movement, and the breakfast; and possibly their  irrepressible joyous sense of superiority is flavoured with pity for  their sisters lying low and pale. You see, the fiddles are on the table,  and even with these you have to hang on to your cup occasionally. The  fiddle makes such a comfortable rest for my elbows, so I scribble this  on the back of the breakfast menu (no one wants it) without being seen.  I remember that neither the position nor the occupation were allowed in  the nursery, and I hear of people to-day in quite good society so dead  to art that they will not allow you to draw on the table cloth! I  sometimes think how many lovely ideas must have been lost by this! It  was the Correggio brothers, was it not? who used to draw during  meal-time; they were very enthusiastic, but they died--possibly of  indigestion!    We are getting into the Straits of Gibraltar--a nice blustery day, the  black tramps coming out of the Mediterranean bury their noses deep in  foam, and roll up and show all the beauty of steamers' lines! To  starboard we get a glimpse of the serrated African mountains above  Tangiers and the Atlas Mountains beyond. They are green in spring, but  now they are brown. I used to think the African Coast was flat and  sandy; I wonder if school boys do so still. It is a pleasant surprise at  first sight to find it so like our own mountainous country. Both the  African hills and the Spanish hills are veiled at times with passing  rain columns that sweep in from the Atlantic.    Here is a little finger-nail jotting of Gibraltar; you see the parts  where the masts are--that is the harbour. The Rock or Mountain, 1,200  feet high, is to the south and right; all its side is bristling with  guns; to the left of the ships a long spit of land joins the rock to  Spain proper. If the cumulous clouds to the north and east, in the  direction of Granada, would lift a little we would see the white tops of  the Sierra Nevada.       .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .    [Illustration]    This has been a most splendid day! We have been on Spanish soil--I  suppose I may call it Spanish soil though it is held by Britain--have  seen fair Spanish women, had sun, wind, rain, wet decks, and dry decks,  and the bustle and interest of dropping anchor in Port, with all the  movement of tugs and boats and people going and coming to and from  shore--the roadstead blustery and fluttering with flags, and everything  afloat bobbing and moving, excepting the great grey men-of-war.    We got away in the first shore boat. How it rained--G.'s hat ruined--but  anything to be in Spain once more. The launch rolls and umbrellas drip,  and we have hundreds of yards along splashing wet pier, G. balancing on  timbers and wire cables to keep a little out of the mud--one umbrella  for the two. Then a jog up the town in a funny little victoria with  yellow oiled canvas curtains, past little gardens with great red flowers  on one tree, and trumpet-shaped white flowers hanging on the next, past  soldiers in khaki, and turbaned Moors huddled in their draperies. The  Moors look so out of place in Europe; they seem to have aimed at being  picturesque and have failed, and know it and stick to it. The Spaniards  you pass are pure joy to the artist; the women have such nice ivory  colouring with the faintest tint of pink, and such eyes, brown and dark,  and kind, and such eye-lashes--it's easy colour to paint too in Henner's  way, Prussian blue, bitumen and ochre and a breath of rose! Look at the  bloom on their hair, blue as the light on raven's wing, and the flour on  their faces, hanging thick on their black eyebrows. I think they must  have a little of the Indian in them. There's a far-away kinship in the  expression of the Ayahs on board and the Spaniards on shore, a queer  penetrating look, and kindly. The mens' expressions are also pleasant  enough, I think--very quiet--but they have your eye and your measure  before you realise, with a glance quick as the glint that a pointer  gives you from the corner of his eye as he ranges past.... Here is a  jotting of one of the natives, perhaps a little heavy in expression, but  fairly typical Spanish face. She is my cousin's cook; he is an R. E. and  lives in quite a big house for Gibraltar; you can stand upright in any  room and stretch yourself in the drawing-room, which has a balcony; I  painted her as she stood in it. My cousin's wife had discharged her, but  there was no ill-feeling, so she came to pay a complimentary call, in  black lace mantilla and pink blouse. She was called Barbara, and loved a  baker over the way, and when she should have been regarding the soup,  she was throwing glances to the baker in his shop, so she had to go!  \"Poor Barbara\"--and lucky baker, to receive such cordite glances!    A dainty lady of Saxon type, with face like china, hair fine gold, and  eyes of Neapolitan violet, looked over my shoulder whilst I sketched.  She is just out, and is enjoying Gibraltar hugely. But I should not have  said violet eyes, for one was black as a thunder-cloud; she hunted  yesterday and got dragged poor thing, and was bruised all over, but she  was going about and hunts again in two or three days.    [Illustration: A Spanish Woman.]          CHAPTER IV      [Illustration: Sunday parade of Lascars.]    Our first day with a blue sky at sea--my word it is blue, impossibly  blue, and the sun is beaming! We have had a quiet night, so everyone is  very contented. On our left the Spanish coast is very mountainous, and  little cloudlets are throwing shadows over the mountain sides. G. and I  study our Spanish grammar; but perhaps \"study\" is hardly the word, dream  over it would be more exact, and wonder at the blueness of the sea and  the blue reflected lights on the hurricane deck above us. We have  managed to get our chairs into a patch of sun; we rather court its rays  just now, by the time we come home again I daresay we will take the  shady side of the street. So close are we to the coast that, looking  through the glasses, we can see into the glens and make out cottages  where we know the people are speaking Spanish; and we plan a voyage  through these hills some day; therefore our Spanish exercises. What a  country it is both for castles and voyages, and how many ways there are  to travel in it. In the train or on horseback, or with mules or a  donkey, or a coach and four, as did Theophile Gautier. But not on foot  for choice, that would be so undignified as to be barely safe in Spain.  We arrange to have mules--for there is such a distinguished and  aristocratic appearance about a train of mules, and an air of romance  about them and their gay caparisons. We will trek over these mountains,  and through the cork woods and brackens in the glens, live on figs and  Vino Riojo carried in black skins on our sumpter mules, and camp at  night on the dry ground under the brown trunks of the cork  trees--another book, _mes amis_, and pictures, I vow! It will be in the  South of Spain, this voyage of ours, amongst the elegant, fiery  Andalusians, and we might combine the treking with a little coasting to  Cadiz and Malaga, then inland by the Rhonda Valley, where travelling on  mules would be almost rapid compared with the train. There are such  lovely villages there, embowered in foliage and flowers at the bottom of  rocky glens, and such pleasant peasants, with quiet, gentle manners.  Just this last word before we lose sight of Spain. Why do women at home  not adopt Spanish dancing? I am quite sure it is the secret of the  Andalusian's poise and walk.
