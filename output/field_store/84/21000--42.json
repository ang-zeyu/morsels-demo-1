Feast of Naurooz, March 21, 1909.          \"For the information of those who know little or nothing...\"      For the information of those who know little or nothing of the Bahai  Revelation, we quote the following account translated from the (French)  Encyclopaedia of Larousse:--    Bahaism the religion of the disciples of Baha'o'llah, an outcome of  Babism.--Mirza Husain Ali Nuri Baha'o'llah was born at Teheran in 1817 A.  D. From 1844 he was one of the first adherents of the Bab, and devoted  himself to the pacific propagation of his doctrine in Persia. After the  death of the Bab he was, with the principal Babis, exiled to Baghdad, and  later to Constantinople and Adrianople, under the surveillance of the  Ottoman Government. It was in the latter city that he openly declared his  mission. He was \"He whom God would make manifest,\" whom the Bab had  announced in his writings, the great Manifestation of God, promised for  the last days; and in his letters to the principal Rulers of the States of  Europe he invited them to join him in establishing religion and universal  peace. From this time, the Babis who acknowledged him became Bahais. The  sultan then exiled him (1868 A. D.) to Acca in Palestine, where he  composed the greater part of his doctrinal works, and where he died in  1892 A. D. (May 29). He had confided to his son, Abbas Effendi Abdul-Baha,  the work of spreading the religion and continuing the connection between  the Bahais of all parts of the world. In point of fact, there are Bahais  everywhere, not only in Mohammedan countries, but also in all the  countries of Europe, as well as in the United States, Canada, Japan,  India, etc. This is because Baha'o'llah has known how to transform Babism  into a universal religion, which is presented as the fulfillment and  completion of all the ancient faiths. The Jews await the Messiah, the  Christians the return of Christ, the Moslem the Mahdi, the Buddhists the  fifth Buddha, the Zoroastrians Shah Bahran, the Hindoos the reincarnation  of Krishna, and the Atheists--a better social organization! Baha'o'llah  represents all these, and thus destroys the rivalries and the enmities of  the different religions; reconciles them in their primitive purity, and  frees them from the corruption of dogmas and rites. For Bahaism has no  clergy, no religious ceremonial, no public prayers; its only dogma is  belief in God and in his Manifestations (Zoroaster, Moses, Jesus, et al.,  Baha'o'llah). The principal works of Baha'o'llah are the Kitab-ul-Ighan,  the Kitab-ul-Akdas, the Kitab-ul-Ayd, and numerous letters or tablets  addressed to sovereigns or to private individuals. Ritual holds no place  in the religion, which must be expressed in all the actions of life, and  accomplished in neighborly love. Every one must have an occupation. The  education of children is enjoined and regulated. No one has the power to  receive confession of sins, or to give absolution. The priests of the  existing religions should renounce celibacy, and should preach by their  example, mingling in the life of the people. Monogamy is universally  recommended, etc. Questions not treated of are left to the civil law of  each country, and to the decisions of the Bait-ul-Adl, or House of  Justice, instituted by Baha'o'llah. Respect toward the Head of the State  is a part of respect toward God. A universal language, and the creation of  tribunals of arbitration between nations, are to suppress wars. \"You are  all leaves of the same tree, and drops of the same sea,\" Baha'o'llah has  said. Briefly, it is not so much a new religion as Religion renewed and  unified, which is directed today by Abdul-Baha.--(Nouveau Larousse  Illustre, supplement, p. 66.)          \"Just as this book was going to press the introduction to...\"      Just as this book was going to press the introduction to it appearing on  the following page was received from Abdul-Baha.          \"He is God!...\"      He is God!    O Thou Almighty Lord!    Strengthen all mankind that they may do according to the instructions and  teachings recorded in these writings, so that wars and strifes may be  eliminated from the world of man; that the roots of enmity may be  destroyed and the foundations of love and affection be established; that  the hearts may be filled with love and the souls be attracted; that wisdom  may advance and the faces become brightened and illumined; that there be  no more wars and strifes and that reconciliation and peace appear; that  the Unity of the world of man may pitch its tent on the \"apex of the  horizons,\" so that peoples and parties become as one nation, that  different continents become as one continent and the whole earth as one  land; that the sects of antagonizing and dogmatic religions be unified;  that the world of creation be adorned and all the people of the earth  abide in unity and peace.

TABLETS OF ABDUL-BAHA          \"O thou party who art assisted by the hosts of the Kingdom...\"      O thou party(5) who art assisted by the hosts of the Kingdom of El-Abha!    Blessed are ye who are assembled in the shadow of the Word of God, who are  abiding in the cave of the Covenant of God, who are comforted by dwelling  in the Paradise of El-Abha(6), who are cheerfully moved with the breezes  which blow from the point of the providence of God, and who have arisen to  render service to the Cause of God, to promulgate the Religion of God, to  promote the Word of God and to hoist the standards of sanctity in those  regions and climes.    By the life of El-Baha! Verily, the perfect and divine power will breathe  in you with bounties from the Holy Spirit and enable you to accomplish a  thing the like of which hath never been seen by the eye of existence.    O party of the Covenant! Verily, the Beauty of El-Abha hath promised the  most great assistance to the beloved who are firm in the Covenant and to  confirm them through the mightiest power. Ye will surely find in your  luminous assembly such signs as will shine within hearts and souls. Adhere  to the hem of the robe of the Lofty One and do your best to spread the  Covenant of God and to kindled with the fire of the love of God, so that  your hearts may move with joy through the fragrances of humbleness which  are being diffused from the heart of Abdul-Baha. Make feet firm,  strengthen hearts and rely upon the everlasting bounties which will  successively pour on your from the Kingdom of El-Abha. Know, verily, the  lights of Baha' will shine forth onto you during your gathering together  in the brilliant Paradise.    It is incumbent on you to have union and harmony. It is incumbent upon you  to have affinity and accord, so that ye may become united in body and soul  as the Pleiades, and as strings of brilliant pearls. Thereby your  foundation will be laid, your argument will become manifest, your stars  will beam forth and your souls will be comforted.    When ye enter the spiritual meeting of Consultation, chant the following  commune, your hearts beating with the love of God and your tongues  purified from aught else save the commemoration of God; so that the Most  Might Power may confirm you by the greatest assistance:          \"O my God! O my God! We are servants who...\"      O my God! O my God! We are servants who have sincerely turned our faces  unto Thy grand face, severed ourselves from all else save Thee in this  great day and are assembled together in this glorious meeting, of one  accord and desire, and unanimous in thought to promulgate Thy Word amid  Thy creatures.    O my Lord! O my Lord! Suffer us to be signs of guidance, standards of Thy  manifest Religion throughout the world, servants of Thy Great Covenant--O  our exalted Lord! --appearances of Thy oneness in Thy Kingdom, the El-Abha,  and stars which dawn forth unto all regions.    O Lord! Make us as seas rolling with the waves of Thy great abundance,  rivers flowing from the mountains of Thy glorious Kingdom, pure fruits on  the tree of Thy illustrious Cause, plants refreshed and moved by the  breeze of Thy gift in Thy wonderful vineyard.    O Lord! Cause our souls to depend upon the signs of Thy Oneness, our  hearts to be dilated with the bounties of Thy Singleness, so that we may  become united as are ripples on a waving sea; become harmonized as are the  rays which shine forth from a brilliant light; so that our thoughts,  opinions and feelings become as one reality from which the spirit of  accord may be diffused throughout all regions.    Verily Thou art the Beneficent, the Bestower! Verily Thou art the Giver,  the Mighty, the Loving, the Merciful!          \"O ye who are sincere! O ye who are attracted! O ye...\"      O ye(7) who are sincere! O ye who are attracted! O ye who are yearning! O  ye who are arising for service to the Cause of God, for the promotion of  the Word of God and the spreading of the Fragrances of God!    Verily, I read your excellent letter, its beautiful composition, eloquent  words and deep meanings. I praised God and gave glory to Him for that He  hath strengthened you and confirmed you in serving His glorious vineyard.  Your faces shall be enlightened with the radiance of supplication to God,  invocation to Him, Humbleness and submissiveness to the friends  (believers), and your assembly will be made a magnet for the lights of  assistance"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19317"],[0,"Gallipoli Diary,  Volume 1 (#6)"],[1,"in the folds of the ground there, not to speak of several field  Batteries.\" Therefore, I conclude, \"If it eventually becomes necessary  to take the Gallipoli Peninsula by military force, we shall have to  proceed bit by bit.\" This will vex him no doubt. He likes plans to move  as fast as his own wishes and is apt to forget, or to pretend he has  forgotten, that swiftness in war comes from slow preparations. It is  fairer to tell K. this now, when the question has not yet arisen, than  hereafter if it does then arise.    Passing the mouth of the Dardanelles we got a wonderful view of the  stage whereon the Great Showman has caused so many of his amusing  puppets to strut their tiny hour. For the purpose it stands matchless.  No other panorama can touch it. There, Hero trimmed her little lamp;  yonder the amorous breath of Leander changed to soft sea form. Far away  to the Eastwards, painted in dim and lovely hues, lies Mount Ida. Just  so, on the far horizon line she lay fair and still, when Hector fell and  smoke from burning Troy blackened the mid-day sun. Against this  enchanted background to deeds done by immortals and mortals as they  struggled for ten long years five thousand years ago,--stands forth  formidably the Peninsula. Glowing with bright, springtime colours it  sweeps upwards from the sea like the glacis of a giant's fortress.    So we sailed on Northwards, giving a wide berth to the shore. When we  got within a mile of the head of the Gulf of Saros, we turned, steering  a South-westerly course, parallel to, and one to two miles distant from,  the coastline. Then my first fears as to the outworks of the fortress  were strengthened. The head of the Gulf is filled in with a horrible  marsh. No landing there. Did we land far away to the Westward we must  still march round the marsh, or else we must cross it on one single road  whose long and easily destructible bridges we could see spanning the bog  holes some three miles inland. Opposite the fortified lines we stood in  to within easy field gun range, trusting that the Turks would not wish  prematurely to disclose their artillery positions. So we managed a peep  at close quarters, and were startled to see the ramifications and extent  of the spider's web of deep, narrow trenches along the coast and on  either front of the lines of Bulair. My Staff agree that they must have  taken ten thousand men a month's hard work from dark to dawn. In advance  of the trenches, Williams in the crow's nest reported that with his  strong glasses he could pick out the glitter of wire over a wide expanse  of ground. To the depth of a mile the whole Aegean slope of the neck of  the Peninsula was scarred with spade work and it is clear to a tiro that  to take these trenches would take from us a bigger toll of ammunition  and life than we can afford: especially so seeing that we can only see  one half of the theatre; the other half would have to be worked out of  sight and support of our own ships and in view of the Turkish Fleet.  Only one small dent in the rockbound coast offered a chance of landing  but that was also heavily dug in. In a word, if Bulair had been the only  way open to me and I had no alternative but to take it or wash my hands  of the whole business, I should have to go right about turn and cable  my master he had sent me on a fool's errand.    Between Bulair and Suvla Bay the coastline was precipitous; high cliffs  and no sort of creeks or beaches--impracticable. Suvla Bay itself seems  a fine harbour but too far North were the aim to combine a landing there  together with an attack on the Southern end of the Peninsula. Were we,  on the other hand, to try to work the whole force ashore from Suvla Bay,  the country is too big; it is the broadest part of the Peninsula; also,  we should be too far from its waist and from the Narrows we wish to  dominate. Merely to hold our line of Communications we should need a  couple of Divisions. All the coast between Suvla Bay and for a little  way South of Gaba Tepe seems feasible for landing. I mean we could get  ashore on a calm day if there was no enemy. Gaba Tepe itself would be  ideal, but, alas, the Turks are not blind; it is a mass of trenches and  wire. Further, it must be well under fire of guns from Kilid Bahr  plateau, and is entirely commanded by the high ridge to the North of it.  To land there would be to enter a defile without first crowning the  heights.    Between Gaba Tepe and Cape Helles, the point of the Peninsula, the  coastline consists of cliffs from 100 to 300 feet high. But there are,  in many places, sandy strips at their base. Opinions differ but I  believe myself the cliffs are not unclimbable. I thoroughly believe also  in going for at least one spot that _seems_ impracticable.    Sailing Southwards we are becoming more and more conscious of the  tremendous bombardment going on in the Straits. Now and then, too, we  can see a huge shell hit the top of Achi Baba and turn it into the  semblance of a volcano. Everyone excited and trying to look calm.    At 4 p.m., precisely, we rounded Cape Helles. I had promised de Robeck  not to take his fastest cruiser, fragile as an egg, into the actual  Straits, but the Captain and the Commander (Cameron and Rosomore), were  frightfully keen to see the fight, and I thought it fair to allow one  mile as being the _mouth_ of the Straits and not _the_ Straits. Before  we had covered that mile we found ourselves on the outskirts of--dream  of my life--a naval battle! Nor did the reality pan out short of my  hopes. Here it was; we had only to keep on at thirty knots; in one  minute we should be in the thick of it; and who would be brave enough to  cry halt!    The world had gone mad; common sense was only moonshine after all; the  elephant and the whale of Bismarckian parable were at it tooth and nail!  Shells of all sizes flew hissing through the skies. Before my very eyes,  the graves of those old Gods whom Christ had risen from the dead to  destroy were shaking to the shock of Messrs. Armstrong's patent thunder  bolts!    Ever since the far-away days of Afghanistan and Majuba Hill friends have  been fond of asking me what soldiers feel when death draws close up  beside them. Before he charged in at Edgehill, Astley (if my memory  serves me) exclaimed, \"O, God, I've been too busy fixing up this battle  to think much about you, but, for Heaven's sake, don't you go and  forget about me,\" or words to that effect.    The Yankee's prayer for fair play just as he joined issue with the  grizzly bear gives another glimpse of these secrets between man and his  Maker. As for myself, there are two moments; one when I think I would  not miss the show for millions; another when I think \"what an ass I am  to be here\"; and between these two moments there _is_ a border land when  the mind runs all about Life's workshop and tries to do one last bit of  stock-taking.    But the process can no more be fixed in the memory than the sequence of  a dream when the dew is off the grass. All I remember is a sort of  wonder:--why these incredible pains to seek out an amphibious battle  ground whereon two sets of people who have no cause of quarrel can blow  one another to atoms? Why are these Straits the cockpit of the world?  What is it all about? What on earth has happened to sanity when the  whale and elephant are locked in mortal combat making between them a  picture which might be painted by one of H.M.'s Commissioners in Lunacy  to decorate an asylum for homicides.    Whizz--flop--bang--what an ass I am to be here. If we keep on another  thirty seconds we are in for a visit to Davy Jones's Locker.    Now above the _Queen Elizabeth_, making slowly backwards and forwards up  in the neck of the Narrows, were other men-o'-war spitting tons of hot  metal at the Turks. The Forts made no reply--or none that we could make  out, either with our ears or with glasses. Perhaps there was an attempt;  if so, it must have been very half-hearted. The enemy's fixed defences  were silenced but the concealed mobile guns from the Peninsula and from  Asia were far too busy and were having it all their own way.    Close to us were steam trawlers and mine-sweepers steaming along with  columns of spray spouting up close by them from falling field gun  shells, with here and there a biggish fellow amongst them, probably a  five or six inch field howitzer. One of them was in the act of catching  a great mine as we drew up level with her. Some 250 yards from us was  the _Inflexible_ slowly coming out of the Straits, her wireless cut away  and a number of shrapnel holes through her tops and crow's nest.  Suddenly, so quickly did we turn that, going at speed, the decks were at  an angle of 45 deg. and several of us (d'Amade for one) narrowly escaped  slipping down the railless decks into the sea. The _Inflexible_ had  signalled us she had struck a mine, and that we must stand by and see  her home to Tenedos. We spun round like a top (escaping thereby a salvo  of four from a field battery) and followed as close as we dared.    My blood ran cold--for sheer deliberate awfulness this beat everything.  We gazed spellbound: no one knew what moment the great ship might not  dive into the depths. The pumps were going hard. We fixed our eyes on  marks about the water line to see if the sea was gaining upon them or  not. She was very much down by the bows, that was a sure thing. Crew and  stokers were in a mass standing strictly at attention on the main deck.  A whole bevy of destroyers crowded round the wounded warrior. In the  sight of all those men standing still, silent, orderly in their ranks,  facing the imminence of death, I got my answer to the hasty moralizings  about war, drawn from me (really) by a regret that I would very soon be  drowned. On the deck of that battleship staggering along at a stone's  throw was a vindication of war in itself; of war, the state of being,  quite apart from war"]]]
