[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2233"],[0,"A Damsel in Distress (#6)"],[1,"the  vehicle nearest the kerb was with George the work of a moment. Then  he leaned out of the centre window in such a manner as completely  to screen the interior of the cab from public view.    \"Thank you so much,\" murmured a voice behind him. It seemed to come  from the floor.    \"Not at all,\" said George, trying a sort of vocal chip-shot out of  the corner of his mouth, designed to lift his voice backwards and  lay it dead inside the cab.    He gazed upon Piccadilly with eyes from which the scales had  fallen. Reason told him that he was still in Piccadilly. Otherwise  it would have seemed incredible to him that this could be the same  street which a moment before he had passed judgment upon and found  flat and uninteresting. True, in its salient features it had  altered little. The same number of stodgy-looking people moved up  and down. The buildings retained their air of not having had a bath  since the days of the Tudors. The east wind still blew. But,  though superficially the same, in reality Piccadilly had altered  completely. Before it had been just Piccadilly. Now it was a golden  street in the City of Romance, a main thoroughfare of Bagdad, one  of the principal arteries of the capital of Fairyland. A  rose-coloured mist swam before George's eyes. His spirits, so low  but a few moments back, soared like a good niblick shot out of the  bunker of Gloom. The years fell away from him till, in an instant,  from being a rather poorly preserved, liverish greybeard of  sixty-five or so, he became a sprightly lad of twenty-one in a  world of springtime and flowers and laughing brooks. In other  words, taking it by and large, George felt pretty good. The  impossible had happened; Heaven had sent him an adventure, and he  didn't care if it snowed.    It was possibly the rose-coloured mist before his eyes that  prevented him from observing the hurried approach of a faultlessly  attired young man, aged about twenty-one, who during George's  preparations for ensuring privacy in his cab had been galloping in  pursuit in a resolute manner that suggested a well-dressed  bloodhound somewhat overfed and out of condition. Only when this  person stopped and began to pant within a few inches of his face  did he become aware of his existence.    \"You, sir!\" said the bloodhound, removing a gleaming silk hat,  mopping a pink forehead, and replacing the luminous superstructure  once more in position. \"You, sir!\"    Whatever may be said of the possibility of love at first sight, in  which theory George was now a confirmed believer, there can be no  doubt that an exactly opposite phenomenon is of frequent  occurrence. After one look at some people even friendship is  impossible. Such a one, in George's opinion, was this gurgling  excrescence underneath the silk hat. He comprised in his single  person practically all the qualities which George disliked most. He  was, for a young man, extraordinarily obese. Already a second  edition of his chin had been published, and the perfectly-cut  morning coat which encased his upper section bulged out in an  opulent semi-circle. He wore a little moustache, which to George's  prejudiced eye seemed more a complaint than a moustache. His face  was red, his manner dictatorial, and he was touched in the wind.  Take him for all in all he looked like a bit of bad news.    George had been educated at Lawrenceville and Harvard, and had  subsequently had the privilege of mixing socially with many of New  York's most prominent theatrical managers; so he knew how to behave  himself. No Vere de Vere could have exhibited greater repose of  manner.    \"And what,\" he inquired suavely, leaning a little further out of  the cab, \"is eating you, Bill?\"    A messenger boy, two shabby men engaged in non-essential  industries, and a shop girl paused to observe the scene. Time was  not of the essence to these confirmed sightseers. The shop girl was  late already, so it didn't matter if she was any later; the  messenger boy had nothing on hand except a message marked  \"Important: Rush\"; and as for the two shabby men, their only  immediate plans consisted of a vague intention of getting to some  public house and leaning against the wall; so George's time was  their time. One of the pair put his head on one side and said:  \"What ho!\"; the other picked up a cigar stub from the gutter and  began to smoke.    \"A young lady just got into your cab,\" said the stout young man.    \"Surely not?\" said George.    \"What the devil do you mean--surely not?\"    \"I've been in the cab all the time, and I should have noticed it.\"    At this juncture the block in the traffic was relieved, and the cab  bowled smartly on for some fifty yards when it was again halted.  George, protruding from the window like a snail, was entertained by  the spectacle of the pursuit. The hunt was up. Short of throwing  his head up and baying, the stout young man behaved exactly as a  bloodhound in similar circumstances would have conducted itself. He  broke into a jerky gallop, attended by his self-appointed  associates; and, considering that the young man was so stout, that  the messenger boy considered it unprofessional to hurry, that the  shop girl had doubts as to whether sprinting was quite ladylike,  and that the two Bohemians were moving at a quicker gait than a  shuffle for the first occasion in eleven years, the cavalcade made  good time. The cab was still stationary when they arrived in a  body.    \"Here he is, guv'nor,\" said the messenger boy, removing a bead of  perspiration with the rush message.    \"Here he is, guv'nor,\" said the non-smoking Bohemian. \"What oh!\"    \"Here I am!\" agreed George affably. \"And what can I do for you?\"    The smoker spat appreciatively at a passing dog. The point seemed  to him well taken. Not for many a day had he so enjoyed himself. In  an arid world containing too few goes of gin and too many  policemen, a world in which the poor were oppressed and could  seldom even enjoy a quiet cigar without having their fingers  trodden upon, he found himself for the moment contented, happy, and  expectant. This looked like a row between toffs, and of all things  which most intrigued him a row between toffs ranked highest.    \"R!\" he said approvingly. \"Now you're torkin'!\"    The shop girl had espied an acquaintance in the crowd. She gave  tongue.    \"Mordee! Cummere! Cummere quick! Sumfin' hap'nin'!\" Maudie,  accompanied by perhaps a dozen more of London's millions, added  herself to the audience. These all belonged to the class which will  gather round and watch silently while a motorist mends a tyre. They  are not impatient. They do not call for rapid and continuous  action. A mere hole in the ground, which of all sights is perhaps  the least vivid and dramatic, is enough to grip their attention for  hours at a time. They stared at George and George's cab with  unblinking gaze. They did not know what would happen or when it  would happen, but they intended to wait till something did happen.  It might be for years or it might be for ever, but they meant to be  there when things began to occur.    Speculations became audible.    \"Wot is it? 'Naccident?\"    \"Nah! Gent 'ad 'is pocket picked!\"    \"Two toffs 'ad a scrap!\"    \"Feller bilked the cabman!\"    A sceptic made a cynical suggestion.    \"They're doin' of it for the pictures.\"    The idea gained instant popularity.    \"Jear that? It's a fillum!\"    \"Wot o', Charlie!\"    \"The kemerer's 'idden in the keb.\"    \"Wot'll they be up to next!\"    A red-nosed spectator with a tray of collar-studs harnessed to his  stomach started another school of thought. He spoke with decision  as one having authority.    \"Nothin' of the blinkin' kind! The fat 'un's bin 'avin' one or two  around the corner, and it's gorn and got into 'is 'ead!\"    The driver of the cab, who till now had been ostentatiously unaware  that there was any sort of disturbance among the lower orders,  suddenly became humanly inquisitive.    \"What's it all about?\" he asked, swinging around and addressing  George's head.    \"Exactly what I want to know,\" said George. He indicated the  collar-stud merchant. \"The gentleman over there with the portable  Woolworth-bargain-counter seems to me to have the best theory.\"    The stout young man, whose peculiar behaviour had drawn all this  flattering attention from the many-headed and who appeared  considerably ruffled by the publicity, had been puffing noisily  during the foregoing conversation. Now, having recovered sufficient  breath to resume the attack, he addressed himself to George once  more.    \"Damn you, sir, will you let me look inside that cab?\"    \"Leave me,\" said George, \"I would be alone.\"    \"There is a young lady in that cab. I saw her get in, and I have  been watching ever since, and she has not got out, so she is there  now.\"    George nodded approval of this close reasoning.    \"Your argument seems to be without a flaw. But what then? We  applaud the Man of Logic, but what of the Man of Action? What are  you going to do about it?\"    \"Get out of my way!\"    \"I won't.\"    \"Then I'll force my way in!\"    \"If you try it, I shall infallibly bust you one on the jaw.\"    The stout young man drew back a pace.    \"You can't do that sort of thing, you know.\"    \"I know I can't,\" said George, \"but I shall. In this life, my dear  sir, we must be prepared for every emergency. We must distinguish  between the unusual and the impossible. It would be unusual for a  comparative stranger to lean out of a cab window and sock you one,  but you appear to have laid your plans on the assumption that it  would be impossible. Let this be a lesson to you!\"    \"I tell you what it is--\"    \"The advice I give to every young man starting life is 'Never  confuse the unusual with the impossible!' Take the present case,  for instance. If you had only realized the possibility of somebody  some day busting you on the jaw when you tried to get into a cab,  you might have thought out"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22344"],[0,"Remarks on the Subject of Lactation (#6)"],[1,"lactation, and hence supposed that cases of disease from suckling, when  continued for only a moderate period, were rarely if ever met with. More  enlarged experience, however, has now convinced me, that not only are  ill effects occasioned in children when lactation is protracted to a  very unusual extent, but that they occur sometimes, when its duration  has been merely a few months beyond what I conceive is right. Besides  which, we shall find that when from any cause whatever the nurse's milk  becomes impoverished and deteriorated, even if this take place at an  early period after delivery, the injurious effects already referred to  may be produced in the child: for improper food, whether it be bad milk  or any other inappropriate article of diet, is always calculated to  derange the functions of the stomach, bowels, and other chylopoietic  viscera, and in consequence to occasion disease.    It matters not whether the mother be originally unhealthy, and thus her  milk possess bad qualities; or whether from accidental circumstances, or  her continuing to give suck too long it becomes so: in either case the  same effect, namely, _deteriorated milk_, is produced, with the  concomitant evils to which I have alluded. This view of the matter is  corroborated by Case LII., in which true Meningitis attacked a child,  aged only nine months, who, therefore, was not suckled _too long_,--but  then the nurse of that child had been delivered _twenty-one months_,  having suckled another infant previously:--hence we may reasonably  conclude that her milk being from the beginning deteriorated, and  unadapted to the age of the child, the ill effects in this case were  produced at a much earlier period than usual.    It will be observed that I have only given _one_ instance of this latter  description; but, on considering how very rare it must be to find any  mother capable of abandoning her newly-born infant to the breast of a  woman who has already suckled another child one year, any surprise that  might be felt at the circumstance will, I am sure, immediately cease. It  must also be noticed that only among the lowest grades of society do we  find women so long after delivery performing the office of wet-nurse at  all, and those who entrust their infants to the latter are often so  peculiarly situated as to feel no interest whatever in the preservation  of their offspring: indeed I cannot but suspect that, among such,  criminal motives frequently lead to the adoption of the unnatural and  baneful practice in question.    I do not recollect to have seen a case of Meningitis from suckling  except when this process had been _protracted_, either as respects the  child or the nurse; though I by no means doubt the possibility of its  occurrence under other circumstances: but I have met with numerous  instances of other diseases produced by the palpable deterioration of  the mother's or nurse's milk at various periods after delivery; in by  far the greater number, however, of such cases, lactation had been  continued for an unusual length of time.    Vomiting, griping, and diarrh[oe]a, are so common among infants, and  arise in general from causes apparently so evident, that, unless severe  or of long duration, they rarely form the subject of minute inquiry.  Hence these complaints are, perhaps, not so often attributed to  deteriorated milk as they ought to be, although the fact of their  occasionally originating from a morbid condition of this fluid, (and  therefore from protracted lactation as one cause of the latter effect,)  is too well established to be questioned. Dr. Underwood observes, 'has  not every Physician of experience seen infants frequently thrown into  tormina immediately after coming from the _breast of an unhealthy  mother, or one who has but little milk_?'[N] and Mr. Burns states, that  if the usual periodical appearance should return, 'the milk is liable to  disagree with the child, and produce vomiting or purging;' while Dr.  Hamilton expressly mentions that diarrh[oe]a is 'not unfrequently  _occasioned by the depraved quality of the nurse's milk_.'    The two former authors merely testify to the fact of diseases being  produced by the milk, while the latter more explicitly mentions the  cause from which they proceed.    Debility, Tabes Mesenterica, and Scrofula, may also be traced to the  same origin, as every practitioner of experience must have repeatedly  observed: so may that intractable disease, termed Rickets; and it is  worthy of notice, that among the worst instances of this malady I have  seen, were two sisters, _who had been suckled for a very unusual  period_. Neither do I doubt the probability of Epilepsy being similarly  occasioned; and although, I must candidly own, I cannot produce numerous  cases in proof of the correctness of such hypothesis, yet I recollect  that of a girl affected with this complaint, respecting whom the mother  stated (and I recorded the fact at the time) that she had been '_suckled  for two years_;' and, to use her own expression, had 'never been well  since.'[O]    Convulsions arising from protracted suckling, or simply from the nurse's  milk becoming deteriorated at any period, are very common, and I have  kept notes of many such cases that have occurred in the course of my own  practice; which, however, I abstain from here inserting, being anxious  to prevent the present publication from swelling into a volume. Indeed,  the occurrence of convulsions from this cause (diseased milk) has been  mentioned by several of the best authors. Mr. North, in particular,  (whose excellent work on Convulsions should be in the hands of every  practitioner) observes--'It cannot be doubted that children suffer, that  their health is destroyed, and the foundation laid for convulsive  diseases, by _sucking unhealthy nurses_.' 'A predisposition to  convulsive affections in children may be originally produced in  consequence of their being suckled by a nurse addicted to the frequent  use of spirituous liquors. In several instances I have known children  rapidly recover their health when the nurse was changed, who had  exhibited most of the premonitory symptoms of convulsions while they  were suckled by a woman who indulged in the common vice of  gin-drinking.' And Mr. Burns also makes the following remark--'Violent  passions of the mind affect the milk still more;--it often becomes thin  and yellowish, and _causes_ colic, or even _fits_.' It is needless,  however, to say more on this topic, since it is one which no longer  admits of discussion.    The reader may now, perhaps, expect that I shall introduce a series of  practical deductions from the foregoing facts and observations; but  such is not my object upon the present occasion. I merely wish to call  the attention of practitioners and the public to the subject of these  pages, and shall thus discharge, as I conceive, an imperative duty to  society. Having mentioned what I am induced to consider a frequent cause  of inflammation of the investing membranes of the brain in children, my  undertaking is completed. The Profession does not require, and the  public would not be benefited, by the addition of lengthened  therapeutical rules; for I am convinced, there is not a greater  imposition to be found than the doctrine that non-medical persons can  treat diseases with success by means of popular systems of medicine,  '_practical_' treatises, &c. Such books have often done irreparable  mischief--certainly much more harm than good; and so far from injuring  the profits of medical practitioners (as some appear to suppose), have  greatly added to the number of their patients.    I avail myself also of this opportunity to enter my protest against the  ill-judged and mischievous practice of those patients who confide upon  many occasions in the opinion of their nurse, rather than that of their  medical attendant, and who, in consequence, often injure themselves  essentially by deceiving the latter. With respect to this mistaken  preference, Dr. Dewes has well observed--'Let it not be hastily assumed  that there is more safety in following the directions of a nurse than  those of the physician, because she may have had some experience; for it  must be quickly perceived that the calculation is much in favour of the  latter, since the nurse can attend but twelve patients per annum, while  the physician may visit many hundreds in the same period--besides, his  knowledge of the laws of the human system gives him a very decided  superiority.'    In conclusion, it is right to observe, that protracted suckling being a  custom much more prevalent among females of the lower orders than those  of a superior rank, it must follow as a necessary consequence, that  _Meningitis, and other disorders resulting from this cause, are  proportionably less frequent in private than in public practice_. This  remark, it is evident, should be remembered, in order to obviate  apparent discrepancies which otherwise might appear irreconcilable with  the opinions I have expressed. In the truth of those opinions I feel the  most perfect confidence, and cannot but hope that their promulgation  will hereafter prove extensively beneficial, since precautionary, and  even therapeutical measures may be founded upon them, which, if  uniformly adopted, will not only prevent much ill-health and suffering  to mothers, but will also afford the means of saving many children from  perishing by one of the most painful and fatal diseases to which they  are subject.          POSTSCRIPT.      Being anxious to obtain additional evidence with respect to the  production of Meningitis in children by protracted suckling, rather from  the experience of others than my own, I shall feel greatly obliged to  any practitioners who will favour me (free of postage) with either facts  or cases tending to corroborate the truth of the doctrine contained in  the preceding pages; and should I be"]]]
