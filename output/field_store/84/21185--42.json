The book-hunter has, however, his good traits, which sometimes require a  good deal of finding, it is true. We need not dwell at great length on  his apparently unconquerable habit of beating down the prices, for the  custom is too well known to require much explanation; but a view of the  other side of the picture is only fair. A few years ago a well-known  bookseller catalogued a copy of the 'Book of Job' at a very low figure.  A wealthy collector, whose purchases were generally closed on the  judgment of a distinguished bookman, asked to have the copy sent on  approval. It was despatched; but came back within a few days. No  explanation was volunteered: when, however, the collector came into the  shop a short time after, he was asked why he had returned the book. His  answer was to the effect that he could not persuade himself that the  illustrations were really by Blake, particularly as the price asked was  so low. A week or so after this a distinguished art-critic, hearing of  the whereabouts of this copy, asked to have it on approval: in sending  it the bookseller enclosed a note to the effect that some doubt had been  expressed as to the genuineness of the plates. In a few days came a  cheque from the man of art for L10 over and above the catalogue price,  and a note to the effect that the illustrations were not only  unquestionably by Blake, but in the finest possible state.    Last summer a certain bookseller sold, after some considerable amount of  haggling, a very fine Missal for L65, which was L5 less than its  catalogue price. A few weeks after the purchaser called and paid the  additional L5, explaining that a friend of his had taken a violent fancy  to the book, and begged to be allowed to possess it at L70. Another  honest book-collector, discovering that he had bought a book  considerably cheaper than an example had been sold at Sotheby's, and L2  less than Mr. Quaritch had asked for a similar copy, sent his bookseller  a present of a parcel of books to make up the difference in the two  amounts.    With these few introductory and perhaps desultory pages, the reader is  invited to the more solid feast provided for his delectation in the  following pages.      FOOTNOTES:    [xxix-A] Mr. Stainforth's collection ranged over 300 years, and, amid  much utter rubbish, there were a few things of considerable rarity,  notably one of only three complete copies known of T. Bentley's  'Monument of Matrones,' 1582, formerly in the libraries of Herbert,  Woodhouse, Heber and Bliss. It included two autograph letters of the  Right Hon. T. Grenville, and realized L63; Anne Bradstreet's 'Tenth Muse  lately sprung up in America,' 1650, L12 10s.; and a copy of Dame Juliana  Berners' 'Booke of Hauking,' etc., L13. Nearly fifty items appear under  the name of Aphra Behn; whilst there are twenty-one editions of Jane  Porter's 'Poems,' which realized the grand total of 14s. The library  comprised 3,076 lots (representing, perhaps, twenty times that number of  volumes), and realized the total of L792 5s.          [Illustration]    THE BOOK-HUNTER IN LONDON          EARLY BOOK-HUNTING.      THOSE who have studied the earlier phases of English history will  readily understand that the terms book-hunting in England and  book-hunting in London are by no means synonymous. The passion for books  had manifested itself in various and remote parts of this country long  before London had developed into a place of importance; when, indeed, it  was battling from without and within with conflicts which seemed to  predict complete annihilation. But the growth of London is essentially  typical of the growth of the nation, and of the formation of the  national character. When it was laying the foundation of its future  greatness London had no thought of intellectual pursuits, even if  Londoners themselves had any conception of an intellectual life. For any  trace of such unthought-of, and perhaps, indeed, unheard-of, articles as  books, we must go to localities far remote from London--to spots where,  happily, the strife and din of savage warfare scarcely made themselves  heard. The monasteries were the sole repositories of literature; to the  monk alone had the written book any kind of intelligence, any species of  pleasure. To him it was as essential as the implements of destruction to  the warrior, or the plough to the husbandman. The one had no sympathy,  no connection, with the other, only in so far that the events which  transpired in the battlefield had to be recorded in the _scriptorium_.  Although London was a place of importance at a very early stage of the  Roman occupation, it was not in any sense an intellectual centre for  centuries after that period.    [Illustration: _In a Scriptorium._]    Indeed, it might be laid down as a general principle that the farther  the seeker went from London the more likelihood there was of meeting  with books. To Northumbria, from the end of the sixth to the end of the  seventh century, we shall have to look for the record of book-buying,  for during that period books were imported in very considerable  quantities; abbeys arose all along the coast, and scholars  proportionately increased. In a letter to Charlemagne, Alcuin speaks of  certain 'exquisite books' which he studied under Egbert at York. At  Wearmouth, Benedict Biscop (629-690) was amassing books with all the  fury of half a dozen ordinary bibliomaniacs. He collected everything,  and spared no cost. At York, Egbert had a fine library in the minster.  St. Boniface, the Saxon missionary, was a zealous collector. There were  also collections--and consequently collectors--of books at places less  remote from London--such as Canterbury, Salisbury, Glastonbury, and even  St. Albans; but of London itself there is no mention.    Scarcely any such thing as book-hunting or book-selling could possibly  have existed in London before the accession of Alfred, who, among the  several ways in which he encouraged literature, is said to have given an  estate to the author of a book on cosmography. Doubtless, it was after  the rebuilding of the city by Alfred that, in the famous letter to  Wulfseg, Bishop of London, he takes a retrospective view of the times in  which they lived, as affording 'churches and monasteries filled with  libraries of excellent books in several languages.' Bede describes  London, even at the beginning of the eighth century, as a great market  which traders frequented by land and sea; and from a passage in Gale we  learn that books were brought into England for sale as early as 705.  With the reconstruction of London, the wise government, and the  enthusiastic love for letters which animated the great Saxon King, the  commerce of the capital not only increased with great rapidity, but the  commerce in books between England and other countries, particularly from  such bibliopolic centres as Paris and Rome, began to assume very  considerable proportions. If, as is undoubtedly the case, books were  continually being imported, it follows that they found purchasers. By  the beginning of the eleventh century there were many private and  semi-private collections of books in or near London. The English  book-collectors of the seventh century include Theodore, Archbishop of  Canterbury, Benedict, Abbot of Wearmouth, and Bede; those of the eighth  century, Ina, King of the West Saxons, and Alcuin, Abbot of Tours;  whilst the tenth century included, in addition to Alfred, Scotus  Erigena, Athelstan, and St. Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury.    But it cannot be said, with due regard to truth, that London was in any  sense a seat of learning, or a popular resort for learned men, until  well on into the thirteenth century. Doubtless many consignments of  books passed through the city on the way to their respective  destinations.    Edward I. may be regarded as the first English monarch who took any  interest in collecting books; most of his, however, were service books.  They are mentioned in the Wardrobe Accounts (1299-1300) of this King,  and are only eleven in number. These he may have purchased in 1273 in  France, through which he passed on his way home from Palestine. But it  is much more probable that he had no thought of books when hurrying home  to claim the crown of his father. Contemporary with Edward was another  book-collector of a very different type, an abbot of Peterborough,  Richard of London, who had a 'private library' of ten books, including  the 'Consolation of Philosophy,' which he may have formed in London. But  quite the most interesting book-collector (so far as we are concerned  just now) of this period is Richard de Gravesend, Bishop of London. A  minute catalogue of this collection is among the treasures of St. Paul's  Cathedral, and has been privately printed. In this case, the price of  each book is affixed to its entry; the total number of volumes is one  hundred, their aggregate value being L116 14s. 6d., representing,  according to Milman's estimate, L1,760 of our present money. Twenty-one  Bibles and parts of Bibles were valued at L19 5s. Twenty-two volumes in  this collection deal with canon and civil law, four with ecclesiastical  history, and about an equal number with what may be designated science  and arts, the rest being of a theological character. The entries run  thus:         'Tractatus fr'is Dertti'i de proprietatibus rerum.        Libellus instructionum.        Liber Avicennae.        Liber naturalis.'    The two last-named are respectively the highest and lowest priced items  in the list--for books of a single volume only--the 'Liber Avicennae'  being valued at the very high figure of L5, and the 'Liber Naturalis' at  3s. A Bible in thirteen volumes is valued at L10; and a 'little Bible'  at L1. The total value of the property of this Bishop was scheduled at  about L3,000.    In spite of civil strife and foreign complications, the taste for  literature made great strides"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22608"],[0,"A Book for All Readers (#6)"],[1,"from lack of funds. Yet some of them buy a great many that are valueless  in spite of this lack. Can any thing be conceived more valueless than a  set of Sylvanus Cobb's novels, reprinted to the number of thirty-five to  forty, from the New York Ledger? Yet these have been bought for scores of  libraries, which could not afford the latest books in science and art, or  biography, history, or travel. There are libraries in which the latest  books on electricity, or sewerage, or sanitary plumbing, might have saved  many lives, but which must go without them, because the money has been  squandered on vapid and pernicious literature.    In almost every library, while some branches of knowledge are fairly  represented, others are not represented at all. Nearly all present  glaring deficiencies, and these are often caused by want of systematic  plan in building up the collection. Boards of managers are frequently  changed, and the policy of the library with them. All the more important  is it that the librarian should be so well equipped with a definite aim,  and with knowledge and skill competent to urge that aim consistently, as  to preserve some unity of plan.    I need not add that a librarian should be always wide awake to the needs  of his library in every direction. It should be taken for granted that  its general aim is to include the best books in the whole range of human  knowledge. With the vast area of book production before him, he should  strengthen every year some department, taking them in order of  importance.    Some scholarly writers tell us that very few books are essential to a  good education. James Russell Lowell named five, which in his view  embraced all the essentials; namely, Homer, Dante, Shakespeare,  Cervantes, and Goethe's Faust. Prof. Charles E. Norton of Harvard  remarked that this list might even be abridged so as to embrace only  Homer, Dante and Shakespeare. I can only regard such exclusiveness as  misleading, though conceding the many-sidedness of these great writers.  To extend the list is the function of all public libraries, as well as of  most of the private ones. Next after the really essential books, that  library will be doing its public good service which acquires all the  important works that record the history of man. This will include  biography, travels and voyages, science, and much besides, as well as  history.    Special pains should be taken in every library to have every thing  produced in its own town, county, and State. Not only books, but all  pamphlets, periodicals, newspapers, and even broadsides or circulars,  should be sought for and stored up as memorials of the present age,  tending in large part rapidly to disappear.    In selecting editions of standard authors, one should always  discriminate, so as to secure for the library, if not the best, at least  good, clear type, sound, thick paper, and durable binding. Cheap and  poor editions wear out quickly, and have to be thrown away for better  ones, which wise economy should have selected in the first place. For  example, a widely circulated edition of Scott's novels, found in most  libraries, has the type so worn and battered by the many large editions  printed from the plates, that many letters and words are wanting, thus  spoiling not only the pleasure but abridging the profit of the reader in  perusing the novels. The same is true of one edition of Cooper. Then  there are many cheap reprints of English novels in the Seaside and other  libraries which abound in typographical errors. A close examination of a  cheap edition of a leading English novelist's works revealed more than  3,000 typographical errors in the one set of books! It would be  unpardonable carelessness to buy such books for general reading because  they are cheap.    Librarians should avoid what are known as subscription books, as a rule,  though some valid exceptions exist. Most of such books are profusely  illustrated and in gaudy bindings, gotten up to dazzle the eye. If works  of merit, it is better to wait for them, than to subscribe for an  unfinished work, which perhaps may never reach completion.    A librarian or book collector should be ever observant of what he may  find to enrich his collection. When in a book-store, or a private or  public library, he should make notes of such works seen as are new to  him, with any characteristics which their custodian may remark upon. Such  personal examination is more informing than any catalogue.    I think each public library should possess, besides a complete set of the  English translations of the Greek and Latin classics, a full set of the  originals, for the benefit of scholarly readers. These classic texts can  be had complete in modern editions for a very moderate price.    How far duplicate volumes should be bought should depend upon demand, and  the views of the purchasing powers. There is a real need of more than one  copy of almost every standard work, else it will be perpetually out,  giving occasion for numerous complaints from those who use the library.  It would be a good rule to keep one copy always in, and at the service of  readers, of every leading history, standard poet, or popular novel. Then  the duplicate copies for circulation may be one or more, as experience  and ability to provide may determine. A library which caters to the  novel-reading habit as extensively as the New York Mercantile (a  subscription library) has to buy fifty to one hundred copies of \"Trilby,\"  for example, to keep up with the demand. No such obligation exists for  the free public libraries. They, however, often buy half a dozen to a  dozen copies of a very popular story, when new, and sell them out after  the demand has slackened or died away.    The methods of selection and purchase in public libraries are very  various. In the Worcester (Mass.) Public Library, the librarian makes a  list of desiderata, has it manifolded, and sends a copy to each of the  thirteen members of the Board of directors. This list is reported on by  the members at the next monthly meeting of the Board, and generally, in  the main, approved. Novels and stories are not bought until time has  shown of what value they may be. The aim is mainly educational at the  Worcester library, very special pains being taken to aid all the pupils  and teachers in the public schools, by careful selection, and providing  duplicate or more copies of important works.    In the Public Library of Cleveland, Ohio, there is appointed out of the  governing Board a book-committee of three. To one of these are referred  English books wanted, to another French, and to the third German books.  This sub-committee approves or amends the Librarian's recommendations,  at its discretion; but expensive works are referred to the whole board  for determination.    In the New York Mercantile Library, which must keep continually up to  date in its supply of new books, the announcements in all the morning  papers are daily scanned, and books just out secured by immediate order.  Many publishers send in books on approval, which are frequently bought.  An agent in London is required to send on the day of publication all new  books on certain subjects.    The library boards of management meet weekly in New York and  Philadelphia, but monthly in most country libraries. The selection of  books made by committees introduces often an element of chance, not quite  favorable to the unity of plan in developing the resources of the  library. But with a librarian of large information, discretion, and  skill, there need seldom be any difficulty in securing approval of his  selections, or of most of them. In some libraries the librarian is  authorized to buy at discretion additions of books in certain lines, to  be reported at the next meeting of the board; and to fill up all  deficiencies in periodicals that are taken. This is an important  concession to his judgment, made in the interest of completeness in the  library, saving a delay of days and sometimes weeks in waiting for the  board of directors.    All orders sent out for accessions should previously be compared with the  alphabeted order-card list, as well as with the general catalogue of the  library, to avoid duplication. After this the titles are to be  incorporated in the alphabet of all outstanding orders, to be withdrawn  only on receipt of the books.    The library should invite suggestions from all frequenting it, of books  recommended and not found in the collection. A blank record-book for this  purpose, or an equivalent in order-cards, should be always kept on the  counter of the library.          CHAPTER 2.    BOOK BUYING.      The buying of books is to some men a pastime; to others it is a passion;  but to the librarian and the intelligent book collector it is both a  business and a pleasure. The man who is endowed with a zeal for knowledge  is eager to be continually adding to the stores which will enable him to  acquire and to dispense that knowledge. Hence the perusal of catalogues  is to him an ever fresh and fascinating pursuit. However hampered he may  be by the lack of funds, the zest of being continually in quest of some  coveted volumes gives him an interest in every sale catalogue, whether of  bookseller or of auctioneer. He is led on by the perennial hope that he  may find one or more of the long-wished for and waited-for _desiderata_  in the thin pamphlet whose solid columns bristle with book-titles in  every variety of abbreviation and arrangement. It is a good plan, if one  can possibly command the time, to read every catalogue of the book  auctions, and of the second-hand book dealers, which comes to hand. You  will thus find a world of books chronicled and offered which you do not  want, because you have got them already: you will find many, also, which  you want, but which you know you cannot have; and you may find some of  the very volumes which you have sought through"]]]
