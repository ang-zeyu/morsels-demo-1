Then he saw she  really meant it, and he seized his prize. Nodding his thanks to her,  he ate the most luxurious meal he had ever had in all his life. Heidi  was watching the goats in the meantime, and asked Peter for their  names.    The boy could tell them all to her, for their names were about the  only thing he had to carry in his head. She soon knew them, too, for  she had listened attentively. One of them was the Big Turk, who tried  to stick his big horns into all the others. Most of the goats ran away  from their rough comrade. The bold Thistlefinch alone was not afraid,  and running his horns three or four times into the other, so  astonished the Turk with his great daring that he stood still and gave  up fighting, for the Thistlefinch had sharp horns and met him in the  most warlike attitude. A small, white goat, called Snowhopper, kept up  bleating in the most piteous way, which induced Heidi to console it  several times. Heidi at last went to the little thing again, and  throwing her arms around its head, she asked, \"What is the matter with  you, Snowhopper? Why do you always cry for help?\" The little goat  pressed close to Heidi's side and became perfectly quiet. Peter was  still eating, but between the swallows he called to Heidi: \"She is so  unhappy, because the old goat has left us. She was sold to somebody in  Mayenfeld two days ago.\"    \"Who was the old goat?\"    \"Her mother, of course.\"    \"Where is her grandmother?\"    \"She hasn't any.\"    \"And her grandfather?\"    \"Hasn't any either.\"    \"Poor little Snowhopper!\" said Heidi, drawing the little creature  tenderly to her. \"Don't grieve any more; see, I am coming up with you  every day now, and if there is anything the matter, you can come to  me.\"    Snowhopper rubbed her head against Heidi's shoulder and stopped  bleating. When Peter had finally finished his dinner, he joined Heidi.    The little girl had just been observing that Schwaenli and Baerli were  by far the cleanest and prettiest of the goats. They evaded the  obtrusive Turk with a sort of contempt and always managed to find the  greenest bushes for themselves. She mentioned it to Peter, who  replied: \"I know! Of course they are the prettiest, because the uncle  washes them and gives them salt. He has the best stable by far.\"    All of a sudden Peter, who had been lying on the ground, jumped up and  bounded after the goats. Heidi, knowing that something must have  happened, followed him. She saw him running to a dangerous abyss on  the side. Peter had noticed how the rash Thistlefinch had gone nearer  and nearer to the dangerous spot. Peter only just came in time to  prevent the goat from falling down over the very edge. Unfortunately  Peter had stumbled over a stone in his hurry and was only able to  catch the goat by one leg. The Thistlefinch, being enraged to find  himself stopped in his charming ramble, bleated furiously. Not being  able to get up, Peter loudly called for help. Heidi immediately saw  that Peter was nearly pulling off the animal's leg. She quickly picked  some fragrant herbs and holding them under the animal's nose, she said  soothingly: \"Come, come, Thistlefinch, and be sensible. You might fall  down there and break your leg. That would hurt you horribly.\"    The goat turned about and devoured the herbs Heidi held in her hand.  When Peter got to his feet, he led back the runaway with Heidi's help.  When he had the goat in safety, he raised his rod to beat it for  punishment. The goat retreated shyly, for it knew what was coming.  Heidi screamed loudly: \"Peter, no, do not beat him! look how scared he  is.\"    \"He well deserves it,\" snarled Peter, ready to strike. But Heidi,  seizing his arm, shouted, full of indignation: \"You mustn't hurt him!  Let him go!\"    Heidi's eyes were sparkling, and when he saw her with her commanding  mien, he desisted and dropped his rope. \"I'll let him go, if you give  me a piece of your cheese again to-morrow,\" he said, for he wanted a  compensation for his fright.    \"You may have it all to-morrow and every day, because I don't need  it,\" Heidi assured him. \"I shall also give you a big piece of bread,  if you promise never to beat any of the goats.\"    \"I don't care,\" growled Peter, and in that way he gave his promise.    Thus the day had passed, and the sun was already sinking down behind  the mountains. Sitting on the grass, Heidi looked at the bluebells and  the wild roses that were shining in the last rays of the sun. The  peaks also started to glow, and Heidi suddenly called to the boy: \"Oh,  Peter, look! everything is on fire. The mountains are burning and the  sky, too. Oh, look! the moon over there is on fire, too. Do you see  the mountains all in a glow? Oh, how beautiful the snow looks! Peter,  the eagle's nest is surely on fire, too. Oh, look at the fir-trees  over there!\"    Peter was quietly peeling his rod, and looking up, said to Heidi:  \"This is no fire; it always looks like that.\"    \"But what is it then?\" asked Heidi eagerly, gazing about her  everywhere.    \"It gets that way of itself,\" explained Peter.    \"Oh look! Everything is all rosy now! Oh, look at this mountain over  there with the snow and the sharp peaks. What is its name?\"    \"Mountains have no names,\" he answered.    \"Oh, see, how beautiful! It looks as if many, many roses were growing  on those cliffs. Oh, now they are getting grey. Oh dear! the fire has  gone out and it is all over. What a terrible shame!\" said Heidi quite  despondently.    \"It will be the same again tomorrow,\" Peter reassured her. \"Come now,  we have to go home.\"    When Peter had called the goats together, they started downwards.    \"Will it be like that every day when we are up?\" asked Heidi, eagerly.    \"It usually is,\" was the reply.    \"What about tomorrow?\" she inquired.    \"Tomorrow it will be like that, I am sure,\" Peter affirmed.    That made Heidi feel happy again. She walked quietly by Peter's side,  thinking over all the new things she had seen. At last, reaching the  hut, they found the grandfather waiting for them on a bench under the  fir-trees. Heidi ran up to him and the two goats followed, for they  knew their master. Peter called to her: \"Come again tomorrow!  Good-night!\"    Heidi gave him her hand, assuring him that she would come, and finding  herself surrounded by the goats, she hugged Snowhopper a last time.    When Peter had disappeared, Heidi returned to her grandfather. \"Oh  grandfather! it was so beautiful! I saw the fire and the roses on the  rocks! And see the many, many flowers I am bringing you!\" With that  Heidi shook them out of her apron. But oh, how miserable they looked!  Heidi did not even know them any more.    \"What is the matter with them, grandfather? They looked so different!\"  Heidi exclaimed in her fright.    \"They are made to bloom in the sun and not to be shut up in an apron,\"  said the grandfather.    \"Then I shall never pick them any more! Please, grandfather, tell me  why the eagle screeches so loudly,\" asked Heidi.    \"First go and take a bath, while I go into the shed to get your milk.  Afterwards we'll go inside together and I'll tell you all about it  during supper-time.\"    They did as was proposed, and when Heidi sat on her high chair before  her milk, she asked the same question as before.    \"Because he is sneering at the people down below, who sit in the  villages and make each other angry. He calls down to them:--'If you  would go apart to live up on the heights like me, you would feel much  better!'\" The grandfather said these last words with such a wild  voice, that it reminded Heidi of the eagle's screech.    \"Why do the mountains have no names, grandfather?\" asked Heidi.    \"They all have names, and if you tell me their shape I can name them  for you.\"    Heidi described several and the old man could name them all. The child  told him now about all the happenings of the day, and especially about  the wonderful fire. She asked how it came about.    \"The sun does it,\" he exclaimed. \"Saying good-night to the mountains,  he throws his most beautiful rays to them, that they may not forget  him till the morning.\"    Heidi was so much pleased with this explanation, that she could hardly  wait to see the sun's good-night greetings repeated. It was time now  to go to bed, and Heidi slept soundly all night. She dreamt that the  little Snowhopper was bounding happily about on the glowing mountains  with many glistening roses blooming round her.          IV    IN THE GRANDMOTHER'S HUT      Next morning Peter came again with his goats, and Heidi went up to the  pasture with them. This happened day after day, and in this healthy  life Heidi grew stronger, and more sunburnt every day. Soon the autumn  came and when the wind was blowing across the mountainside, the  grandfather would say: \"You must stay home to-day, Heidi; for the wind  can blow such a little thing as you down into the valley with a single  gust.\"    It always made Peter unhappy when Heidi did not come along, for he saw  nothing but misfortunes ahead of him; he hardly knew how to pass his  time, and besides, he was deprived of his abundant dinner. The goats  were so accustomed to Heidi by this time, that they did not follow  Peter when she was not with him.    Heidi herself did not mind staying at home, for she loved nothing  better than to watch her grandfather with his saw and hammer.  Sometimes the grandfather would make small round cheeses on those  days, and there was no greater pleasure for Heidi than to see him stir  the butter with his bare arms. When the wind would howl through the  fir-trees on those stormy days, Heidi would run out to the grove,  thrilled and happy by the wondrous roaring in the branches. The sun  had lost its vigor, and the child had to put on her shoes and  stockings and her little dress.    The weather got colder and colder, and when Peter came up in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20785"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#6)"],[1,"to visit my master and my pappy  and mammy met and got married, 'though my pappy only seen my mammy in  the summer when his masters come to visit our master and dey took him  right back. I had three sisters and two brothers and none of dem was  my whole brothers and sisters. I stayed in the Big House all the time,  but my sisters and brothers was gived to the master's sons and  daughters whey dey got married and dey was told to send back for some  more when dem died. I didn't never stay with my mammy doing of  slavery. I stayed in the Big House. I slept under the dining room  table with three other darkies. The flo' was well carpeted. Don't  remembah my grandmammy and grandpappy, but my master was they master.    I waited on the table, kept flies off'n my mistress and went for the  mail. Never made no money, but dey did give the slaves money at  Christmas time. I never had over two dresses. One was calico and one  gingham. I had such underclothes as dey wore then.    Master Manley and Mistress had six sons an' six darters. Dey raised  dem all till dey was grown too. Dey lived in a great big house 'cross  from the mansion, right in town before Master was 'lected Governor,  den dey all moved in dat mansion.    Plantation folks had barbecues and \"lay crop feasts\" and invited the  city darkies out. When I first come here I couldn't understand the  folks here, 'cause dey didn't quit work on Easter Monday. That is some  day in North Carolina even today. I doesn't remember any play songs,  'cause I was almost in prison. I couldn't play with any of the darkies  and I doesn't remember playing in my life when I was a little girl and  when I got grown I didn't want to. I wasn't hongry, I wasn't naked and  I got only five licks from the white folks in my life. Dey was for  being such a big forgitful girl. I saw 'em sell niggers once. The only  pusson I ever seen whipped at dat whipping post was a white man.    I never got no learning; dey kept us from dat, but you know some of  dem darkies learnt anyhow. We had church in the heart of town or in  the basement of some old building. I went to the 'piscopal church most  all the time, till I got to be a Baptist.    The slaves run away to the North 'cause dey wanted to be free. Some of  my family run away sometime and dey didn't catch 'em neither. The  patrollers sho' watched the streets. But when dey caught any of  master's niggers without passes, dey jest locked him up in the guard  house and master come down in the mawnin' and git 'em out, but dem  patrollers better not whip one.    I know when the War commenced and ended. Master Manley sent me from  the Big House to the office about a mile away. Jest as I got to the  office door, three men rid up in blue uniforms and said, \"Dinah, do  you have any milk in there?\" I was sent down to the office for some  beans for to cook dinner, but dem men most nigh scared me to death.  They never did go in dat office, but jest rid off on horseback about a  quarter a mile and seem lak right now, Yankees fell out of the very  sky, 'cause hundeds and hundeds was everywhere you could look to save  your life. Old Mistress sent one of her grandchillun to tell me to  come on, and one of the Yankees told dat child, \"You tell your  grandmother she ain't coming now and never will come back there as a  slave.\" Master was setting on the mansion porch. Dem Yankees come up  on de porch, go down in cellar and didn't tech one blessed thing. Old  Mistress took heart trouble, 'cause dem Yankees whipped white folks  going and coming.    I laid in my bed a many night scared to death of Klu Klux Klan. Dey  would come to your house and ask for a drink and no more want a drink  than nothing.    After the War, I went to mammy and my step-pappy. She done married  again, so I left and went to Warrington and Halifax, North Carolina,  jest for a little while nursing some white chillun. I stayed in  Raleigh, where I was born till 7 years ago, when I come to Oklahoma to  live with my only living child. I am the mother of 4 chillun and 11  grandchillun.    When I got married I jumped a broomstick. To git unmarried, all you  had to do was to jump backwards over the same broomstick.    Lincoln and Booker T. Washington was two of the finest men ever lived.  Don't think nothing of Jeff Davis, 'cause he was a traitor. Freedom  for us was the best thing ever happened. Prayer is best thing in the  world. Everybody ought to pray, 'cause prayer got us out of slavery.          Oklahoma Writer's Project  Ex-Slaves    POLLY COLBERT  Age 83 yrs.  Colbert, Oklahoma      I am now living on de forty-acre farm dat de Government give me and it  is just about three miles from my old home on Master Holmes Colbert's  plantation where I lived when I was a slave.    Lawsy me, times sure has changed since slavery times! Maybe I notice  it more since I been living here all de time, but dere's farms 'round  here dat I've seen grown timber cleared off of twice during my  lifetime. Dis land was first cleared up and worked by niggers when dey  was slaves. After de War nobody worked it and it just naturally growed  up again wid all sorts of trees. Later, white folks cleared it up  again and took grown trees off'n it and now dey are still cultivating  it but it is most wore out now. Some of it won't even sprout peas. Dis  same land used to grow corn without hardly any work but it sure won't  do it now.    I reckon it was on account of de rich land dat us niggers dat was  owned by Indians didn't have to work so hard as dey did in de old  states, but I think dat Indian masters was just naturally kinder any  way, leastways mine was.    My mother, Liza, was owned by de Colbert family and my father, Tony,  was owned by de Love family. When Master Holmes and Miss Betty Love  was married dey fathers give my father and mother to dem for a wedding  gift. I was born at Tishomingo and we moved to de farm on Red River  soon after dat and I been here ever since. I had a sister and a  brother, but I ain't seen dem since den.    My mother died when I was real small, and about a year after dat my  father died. Master Holmes told us children not to cry, dat he and  Miss Betsy would take good care of us. Dey did, too. Dey took us in de  house wid dem and look after us jest as good as dey could colored  children. We slept in a little room close to them and she allus seen  dat we was covered up good before she went to bed. I guess she got a  sight of satisfaction from taking care of us 'cause she didn't have no  babies to care for.    Master Holmes and Miss Betsy was real young folks but dey was purty  well fixed. He owned about 100 acres of land dat was cleared and ready  for de plow and a lot dat was not in cultivation. He had de woods full  of hogs and cows and he owned seven or eight grown slaves and several  children. I remember Uncle Shed, Uncle Lige, Aunt Chaney, Aunt Lizzie,  and Aunt Susy just as well as if it was yesterday. Master Holmes and  Miss Betsy was both half-breed Choctaw Indians. Dey had both been away  to school somewhere in de states and was well educated. Dey had two  children but dey died when dey was little. Another little girl was  born to dem after de War and she lived to be a grown woman.    Dey sure was fine young folks and provided well for us. He allus had a  smokehouse full of meat, lard, sausage, dried beans, peas, corn,  potatoes, turnips and collards banked up for winter. He had plenty of  milk and butter for all of us, too.    Master Holmes allus say, \"A hungry man caint work.\" And he allus saw  to it that we had lots to eat.    We cooked all sorts of Indian dishes: Tom-fuller, pashofa, hickory-nut  grot, Tom-budha, ash-cakes, and pound cakes besides vegetables and  meat dishes. Corn or corn meal was used in all de Indian dishes. We  made hominy out'n de whole grains. Tom-fuller was made from beaten  corn and tasted sort of like hominy.    We would take corn and beat it like in a wooden mortar wid a wooden  pestle. We would husk it by fanning it and we would den put it on to  cook in a big pot. While it was cooking we'd pick out a lot of  hickory-nuts, tie 'em up in a cloth and beat 'em a little and drop 'em  in and cook for a long time. We called dis dish hickory-nut grot. When  we made pashofa we beat de corn and cook for a little while and den we  add fresh pork and cook until de meat was done. Tom-budha was green  corn and fresh meat cooked together and seasoned wid tongue or  pepper-grass.    We cooked on de fire place wid de pots hanging over de fire on racks  and den we baked bread and cakes in a oven-skillet. We didn't use soda  and baking powder. We'd put salt in de meal and scald it wid boiling  water and make it into pones and bake it. We'd roll de ash cakes in  wet cabbage leaves and put 'em in de hot ashes and bake 'em. We cooked  potatoes, and roasting ears dat way also. We sweetened our cakes wid  molasses, and dey was plenty sweet too.    Dey was lots of possums and coons and squirrels and we nearly always  had some one of these to eat. We'd parboil de possum or coon and put  it in a pan and bake him wid potatoes 'round him. We used de broth to  baste him and for gravy. Hit sure was fine eating dem days.    I never had much work to do. I helped 'round de house when I wanted to  and I run errands for Miss Betsy. I liked to do things for her. When I  got a little bigger my brother and I toted cool water to de field for  de hands.    Didn't none of Master Holmes' niggers work when dey was sick. He allus  saw dat dey had medicine and a doctor iffen dey needed one. 'Bout de  only sickness we had was chills and fever. In de old days we made lots  of our own medicine and I still does it yet. We used polecat grease  for croup and rheumatism. Dog-fennel, butterfly-root, and  life-everlasting boiled and mixed and made into a syrup will cure  pneumonia and pleurisy. Pursley-weed, called squirrel physic, boiled  into a syrup will cure chills and fever. Snake-root steeped for a "]]]
