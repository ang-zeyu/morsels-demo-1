What has been self-acquired by any one, as an increment, without  diminishing the paternal estate, likewise a gift from a friend or a  marriage-gift, does not belong to the coheirs.[180]    119. If one have recovered ancestral property which had been  purloined, he has not to give it up to the coheirs;[181] nor shall a  man share the earnings of science.[182]    120. If however the common property be augmented, equal division is  enjoined.[183] In making division among several grandsons, regard  should be had to the respective [portions of their deceased] fathers;    121. inasmuch as the ownership of father and son is co-equal in the  acquisitions of the grandfather, whether land, any settled income, or  moveables.    122. If a son be born of a wife of equal cast, after partition made,  he is to share; or a share may be allotted him from the estate as it  is, after allowing for income and expenditure.[184]    123. Whatever property may be given by the parents to any child,  shall belong to that child. If partition be made after the father's  death, the mother shall also have an equal share.[185]    124. Those of the brothers whose ritual ceremonies have not been  accomplished, shall have them completed by the others whose ritual is  gone through: so in like manner as to the ritual of sisters, [each of  the brethren] devoting a fourth part of his share.[186]    125. The sons of a brahman, shall receive, according to their  [mother's] cast, four parts, or three, or two, or one: the sons of a  kshattriya [in like manner], three, or two, or one: and the sons of a  vaisya, two, or one.[187]    126. Whatever, after partition has taken place, may be discovered to  have been wrongly appropriated by one of the sharers,[188] shall be  equally divided among them all: this is enjoined.    127. A son begotten by one who is without male issue, in obedience to  precept,[189] upon another man's wife, becomes by law heir to both,  and presents the death-oblations of both.[190]    128. (I) \"An _aurasa_[191] son,\" is one born of a _dharma_[192] wife;  equal with him is    (II) \"A daughter's son.\"[193]    (III) \"A wife's son,\" is a son begotten by    a relative[194] [of the husband] or by another [duly authorised].    129 (iv) \"A son of hidden birth,\" is one brought forth in private, in  the [husband's] dwelling.[195]    (v) \"A girl's son,\" is one born of an unmarried girl;[196] he is  considered the son of the maternal grandfather.    130 (vi) \"A son of the twice-married,\" is one born of a woman [by a  second marriage], whether she be [at the time of that marriage] a maid  or not.[197]    (vii) \"A son by gift,\" is one who is made a gift of, either by his  father or his mother.[198]    131 (viii) \"A son by purchase,\" is one sold by his parents.[199]    (ix) \"A son made,\" is a son [born of parents deceased,] selected by  any one for himself.    (x) \"A self-given son,\" is one who has given himself [as a son to  another.][200]    (xi) \"A son with the bride,\" is one of whom the mother is already  pregnant [by another than her husband] when she marries.[201]    132 (xii) \"A deserted son,\" is one adopted upon being forsaken [by his  own parents.[202]]    The first in order that there may be, of the sons above described,  shall present the oblation cake[203] and take the inheritance.[204]    133. Such is the rule enjoined by me for sons where there is equality  of cast. Even the son begotten by a Sudra, on a slave-woman, shall  have such share as [the father] may allot.[205]    134. [But if there be no partition till] after the father's death,  then the brothers [born in marriage] are to assign him half a share:  if there be no brothers nor daughters' sons, he then takes the whole.    135, 136. If a man depart this life without male issue; (i) his wife, (ii)  his daughters, (iii) his parents,[206] (iv) his brothers,[207] (v) the  sons of brothers,[208] (vi) others of the same _gotra_,[209] (vii) kindred  more remote,[210] (viii) a pupil, (ix) a fellow-student[211]--these succeed  to the inheritance; each class upon failure of the one preceding. This  rule applies to all the casts.    137. The heirs of a hermit, of a religious ascetic, of a professed  _brahmachari_,[212] are successively, the preceptor, the disciple, and  an associate dwelling in the same religious retreat.    138. One reunited[213] shall take the portion of his deceased reunited  co-sharer, and shall give it up to a [son, if one be afterwards]  born.[214] This is always so with uterine brothers.    139. A reunited half-brother shall take the property; not a  [separated] half-brother: but a [uterine brother] whether reunited or  not, shall take; this not being so with the half-brother.[215]    140. An impotent, an outcast as well as his son,[216] a cripple, a  madman, an idiot, one blind, one incurably diseased, and such  like,[217] are to be maintained, but do not share in the inheritance.    141. The _aurasa_ sons of those [disqualified] persons, also their  wives' sons,[218] if themselves free from defect,[219] succeed to  shares; and their daughters[220] are to be maintained until provided  with husbands.    142. [So] their childless wives shall be maintained, if of good  conduct; but shall be cast off, if of vicious habits, or of an evil  nature.[221]    143. What has been given [to a woman] by her father, her mother, her  husband, or her brother, or received by her before the nuptial fire,  or on occasion of her husband's marriage with another wife, and such  like,[222] is called _stridhana._    144. Gifts from her kindred, from the bridegroom [before marriage],  also subsequent gifts, descend to her own kindred, should she die  without issue.    145. The _stridhana_ of a wife dying without issue, who has been  married in one of the four forms of marriage designated _brahma_  &c.,[223] belongs to the husband; if she have issue, then the  _stridhana_ goes to her daughters; should she have been married in  another form,[224] then her _stridhana_ goes to her parents.[225]    146. Whoso withholds his daughter,[226] after having promised to give  her [in marriage], shall be amerced, and shall reimburse all expenses  incurred with interest. If she die [after being affianced] he [_i. e._  the bridegroom] shall receive back what he has given, deduction being  made for the expenditure on both sides.    147. A husband need not return to his wife _stridhana_ appropriated by  him, during a famine, or in order to perform sacred rites,[227] or  when suffering from disease,[227] or when in prison.[227]    148. If he marry another wife, he shall give to the one he has, as a  consideration for superseding her, should she not already have  received _stridhana_, what is equivalent [to his gifts on the second  marriage]: but, should she have already received _stridhana_, then, it  is declared, [she is entitled to only] half the amount.[228]    149. If the fact of a partition be denied, the matter shall be  ascertained by [reference to] relatives, near or remote, witnesses,  and writings, also [by enquiry as to] separate possession of messuage  and land.[229]    150. When there is a dispute as to boundaries, the neighbours of the  [disputed] land, old men and the like,[230] cowherds, cultivators of  the soil close to the [disputed] boundary, and all whose business is  in forests--[231]    151.--these shall determine the boundaries, as they are indicated by  elevated ground, by charcoal [-remnants],[232] by husks,[233] by  trees, by a causeway, by ant-hills, by depressions of the soil, by  bones, by memorials,[234] and such like.[235]    152. Otherwise,[236] four, eight, or ten neighbours of the same  village, wearing a red wreath and red garments, and carrying earth,  shall settle the boundary.[237]    153. And if any falsehood be uttered, upon each one [speaking falsely]  the monarch shall impose the medium fine.[238]    In the absence of any persons having knowledge of the matter, and of  any indicatory signs, the monarch shall mark the boundary.[239]    154. The same rule applies to fruit-gardens, to out-houses, to  villages,[240] to wells or tanks, to pleasure-gardens, and to  dwellings, as well as to watercourses caused by the rain.[241]    155. If the boundary be broken, or be overstepped,[242] if a  field[243] be taken away; the lowest, the highest and the medium  fines shall be imposed.[244]    156. [Constructing] a useful dam, if it occasion but slight damage [to  individuals], is not to be prevented; nor is a well[245] which takes  from another's land, if having an abundant supply of water and not of  large extent.    157. If one construct a dam in a field, without notice to the owner  thereof, the right to use it, when complete, shall belong to the owner  of the field: if the field be without owner, then the user belongs to  the monarch.    158. Whoso fails to complete the cultivation of a field which he has  partially ploughed, shall be made to pay [to the landowner] the value  of the [expected] crop. He[246] shall complete the cultivation by  means of another.    159. If a female buffalo spoil corn,[247] [her owner] shall be fined  eight _mashas_,[248] if a cow, the half [of that sum]; if a goat or a  sheep, the half of the latter.    160. If, after having grazed, they repose there, the fine shall be  double what is above specified.    The same [rule applies] to land kept for pasture. An ass and a camel  are [in this respect] the same as a female buffalo.    161. There shall be an indemnity for the owner of the field equal in  value to the corn destroyed.[249] The herdsmen shall receive a  beating, but the cattle-owner be punished by fine, as before  mentioned.    162. No guilt attaches[250] [to the cattle-owner,] if the field[251]  be close to the public road, or to the village pasture lands,[252] and  he do not intend [the trespass]; if he do"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21948"],[0,"Little Busybodies: The Life of Crickets, Ants, Bees, Beetles, and Other (#6)"],[1,"as they travelled up grade; quick water was growing more  frequent and the pools deeper.    At last they came to a deep, round pool, and the guide said, \"Now, Jim,  you've the first try.\"    Jimmie cast his fly, there was a strike, a plunge, and out, out, out ran  Jimmie's line. The boy's face turned quite pale. \"What shall I do, sir?\"    \"You have a big one,\" answered Ben, calmly. \"If you can play him long  enough we may get him; otherwise he'll get your fly and line. Steady  there, steady; let out a little more line, and now reel in a bit.\"    It seemed like hours to Jimmie as he let the line out and reeled it in  again. Really, it was only a few minutes before the guide said: \"Seems  to be getting a little tired; bring him in closer. That's it. There!\"    They had no landing-net with them, so at the last moment Ben Gile seized  the line, and out came a two-pound trout. Jimmie's eyes were popping  nearly out of his head, and Betty was jumping about and clapping her  hands.    [Illustration:  _A._ Front view of dragon-fly nymph.  _B._ Top view of damsel-fly nymph.  _C._ Adult dragon-fly.]    \"Tired?\" asked the old man.    \"Some,\" said the boy.    \"Well, this is the best place we shall find to eat our luncheon. We'll  camp here. Now for the fire! Boys, get the wood and a small strip of  birch bark! Then these two stones will hold the frying-pan. Now for the  fish; we'll keep that big one of yours and I'll mount it for you, if  you'd like me to. We'll eat the little fellows. After luncheon we must  catch more for your mother, Betty, and for Jack to take home with him.\"    Soon the frying-pan was hot, and the trout were sizzling and curling up  with the bacon in the pan. Never did a luncheon taste so good as that,  with fried trout and bacon, and hard-boiled eggs, soda biscuits, and a  mammoth apple pie. They listened to the fire crackling; they looked up  into the shining trees; they watched the water beyond the pool go  tumbling downhill.    Finally the old man said, \"It's going to be a clear day to-morrow.\"    The children gazed up into the sky.    At this Ben Gile laughed. \"Don't look at the sky, look at your plates.\"    Puzzled by this, the children did look at their plates.    \"But there's nothing left to look at,\" said Jack.    \"That's just it. There's an old saying that people who eat all their  food make a clear day for the morrow. Now,\" he continued, \"I'll smoke my  pipe of peace before we go on. Just look at that fellow darting about  over the pool!\"    \"Oh!\" cried Betty, \"it's a darning-needle, and it will sew up my mouth  and my eyes--oh, oh!\"    \"Nonsense, child, that's silly. The dragon-fly is a very useful and a  very harmless fellow. It's a pity that there are so many superstitions  about it.\"    \"There's another name for it,\" said Jack--\"devil's darning-needle.\"    \"And in the South the darkies call it the mule-killer, and believe it  has power to bring snakes to life. It's all nonsense. They are not only  harmless to human beings but also very useful, for they eat flies and  mosquitoes at a great rate. Once upon a time I fed a dragon-fly forty  house flies in two hours. And they eat beetles and spiders and  centipedes. And sometimes they eat one another.\"    \"Like the crickets?\" said Betty.    \"Yes, like the crickets. Just see that fellow dart about. The sharpest  sort of angles. There, it has something! It caught that lace-wing in its  leg-basket.\"    \"Leg-basket!\" exclaimed the children.    \"Yes; it draws its six legs together, and makes a sort of basket right  under its head. Then the dragon-fly devours what it catches by these  strong-toothed jaws. It is a hungry fellow, it is.\"    The old man puffed away quietly for a few minutes, while the children  watched the darning-needle and hoped Ben Gile would say something soon.    \"Those scientists,\" he continued, \"who are working on flying-machines  could learn a good deal from this fellow. The dragon-fly is made for  flight. A long, slender, tapering body that cuts the air, moved by four  narrow, gauzy wings, and steered by that pointed abdomen. They eat,  mate, and lay their eggs while they are flying. I don't know that they  are still for more than a few seconds.\"    \"Can you find their eggs?\" asked Betty.    \"Yes; their eggs are laid in the water or fastened to the stems of water  plants. See that damsel fly, the slender, smaller, pretty-colored  darning-needle? Well, it goes entirely under water, cuts a slit in the  stem with the sharp end of the abdomen, and lays the eggs in the groove  it has made. And they lay thousands of eggs.\"    \"When they hatch out, what do they look like?\" asked Jack, who grew  daily more interested in the creatures about him, and who, in the years  to come, was destined to be a great scientist.    \"It looks a little like the mother,\" said Ben Gile, taking out his pipe,  \"but not much. It goes through a great many changes before it is really  grown up. All told, the growth takes from a few months to a whole year.  The young one, called a nymph, is an ugly little fellow, dingy black  with six sprawling legs, two staring eyes, and a big lower lip which  covers up its cruel face like a mask. It is a true ogre, lurking under  stones and in rubbish at the bottom of the pond seeking whom it may  devour. It eats the smaller and weaker nymphs.\"    \"Oh,\" said Betty, studying the picture the guide had drawn, \"what an  ugly, ugly fellow!\"    \"It changes its skin a good many times, and sometimes it looks a little  better while the skin is still clean and light gray. But it soon turns  dingy again. See these three little leaf-shaped gills I've drawn?\"    \"They are like the screw on a steamer,\" commented Jimmie.    \"They are, a little. Well, this chap uses these gills for the same  purpose as the steamer uses its screw--to scull through the water.\"    \"What happens when it changes?\" asked Jack.    \"After the nymph has its full growth, some sunny morning soon after  daylight, it makes its way up out of the water on to a stem and waits  quietly for the old dark skin to split. Then out crawls a soft-skinned  creature with gauzy wings. But the body is so moist and weak it has to  wait awhile for the warm sunshine to harden the skin and strengthen the  muscle. When this is done the new dragon-fly, with its glistening body,  flies out from the pond in the bright, warm light.\"    \"Then does it live forever?\" asked Betty.    \"No; it dies after twenty-five to forty-five days of its flight. Here,  Jack, catch that fellow!\"    There was a wild scramble, but every time Jack just missed the  dragon-fly. Finally Betty lent him her broad hat, and at last Jack  caught the insect.    \"Gee! aren't its eyes big?\"    \"And beautiful, too,\" said the guide. \"They are made up of thousands of  facets (a facet is just a small, plain surface) as many as thirty  thousand facets in one eye. Some look up, some look down, some look out,  some look in; so that there is nothing that escapes the sight of this  hawk of the air. Look at the wings on this fellow, and look at the  picture I drew for you of the nymph. Well, this fellow's wings begin in  the nymph as tiny sacs, or pads, made by the pushing out of the wall of  the body. Running all through between the two layers of the wing are  thickened lines of chitin, which divide and subdivide, forming this fine  network. In the new wing, protected by these thickenings, are air-tubes,  which divide and branch into all parts of the wing. But as the wing  reaches its full growth most of the air-tubes die.\" The guide paused.  \"We are talking too much and fishing too little. Time to go on. Put out  the fire, boys. Be sure that it's out. Run water all around it. Now  we're off!\" And up, up, up the brook they went.          VII    THE SWIMMING-POOL      Two or three days after the fishing expedition the boys had gathered  together at the swimming-pool, Ben Gile with them. They had been racing,  and climbing trees, and were very warm. \"Come, boys,\" said the guide,  \"let's sit down a minute before you go into the water. It won't do to  bathe when you're too warm. Look round on the stones under the water and  see what you can find.\"    \"Look at this,\" called Peter; \"it's just like a sponge.\"    \"It is a fresh-water sponge.\"    \"I didn't suppose sponges grew in these parts at all,\" said Jimmie.    \"Oh yes, there are many of them in the ponds.\"    \"See this, sir,\" shouted Jack; \"what funny little legs it has!\"    \"That's a May-fly or shad-fly nymph. He was hiding carefully under that  stone and keeping out of the way of the dragon-fly nymph, who would so  gladly gobble him up.\"    \"It's prettier,\" said Jimmie, \"than that dragon-fly nymph you drew a  picture of.\"    \"So it is. See, here on each side of its body are these fine little  gill-plates, moving, moving, moving, so that they may get as much fresh  air as possible out of the water. Each gill-plate is a tiny sac, and  within these are the fine branches of the air-tubes. It's wonderful the  way these creatures breathe.\"    \"Don't they breathe just the way we do?\" asked Jack.    \"No; throughout the body of an insect is a system of tiny white tubes.  Some day we'll look at these tubes under the microscope, and you will  see that they are made up of rings. From end to end of the tube is a  fine thread of chitin twisted in a close spiral like a spring. It is  these little coils which look like rings. The coiled thread holds the  little tube open so that the air may pass readily. But your little  fellow, Jack, cannot have pores on the sides of the body like the last  nymph. It lives under water, and the water would get into its tubes;  instead, it has tracheal gills.\"    [Illustration:  _A._ May-fly.  _B._ Nymph of May-fly.]    \"That's a pretty big word,\" said Peter, looking up at the guide. He was  growing impatient, and wished to begin the swim. If he had known what  that swim was to mean to him, probably he would not have been so  anxious.    \"They aren't so hard"]]]
