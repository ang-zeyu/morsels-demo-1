With a little hunting, specimens in various stages of division may    be found. The division takes place in two ways. In the first    (Fig. 11, _B_), known as fission, a wall is formed across the cell,    dividing it into two cells, which may separate immediately or may    remain united until they have undergone further division. In this    case the original cell wall remains as part of the wall of the    daughter cells. Fission is the commonest form of cell multiplication    throughout the vegetable kingdom.      The second form of cell division or internal cell division is shown    at _C_. Here the protoplasm and nucleus repeatedly divide until a    number of small cells are formed within the old one. These develop    cell walls, and escape by the breaking of the old cell wall, which    is left behind, and takes no part in the process. The cells thus    formed are sometimes provided with two cilia, and are capable of    active movement.      Internal cell division, as we shall see, is found in most plants,    but only at special times.      Closely resembling _Protococcus_, and answering quite as well for    study, are numerous aquatic forms, such as _Chlorococcum_ (Fig. 12).    These are for the most part destitute of a firm cell wall, but are    imbedded in masses of gelatinous substance like many _Cyanophyceae_.    The chloroplasts are smaller and less distinct than in    _Protococcus_. The cells are here oval rather than round, and often    show a clear space at one end.    [Illustration: FIG. 12.--_Chlorococcum_, a plant related to  _Protococcus_, but the naked cells are surrounded by a colorless  gelatinous envelope. _A_, motionless cells. _B_, a cell that has  escaped from its envelope and is ciliated, x 300.]      Owing to the absence of a definite membrane, a distinction between    fission and internal cell division can scarcely be made here. Often    the cells escape from the gelatinous envelope, and swim actively by    means of two cilia at the colorless end (Fig. 12, _B_). In this    stage they closely resemble the individuals of a _Volvox_ colony, or    other green _Flagellata_, to which there is little doubt that they    are related.      There are a number of curious forms common in fresh water that are    probably related to _Protococcus_, but differ in having the cells    united in colonies of definite form. Among the most striking are    the different species of _Pediastrum_ (Fig. 11, _D_, _E_), often met    with in company with other algae, and growing readily in aquaria when    once established. They are of very elegant shapes, and the number of    cells some multiple of four, usually sixteen.      The cells form a flat disc, the outer ones being generally provided    with a pair of spines.      New individuals arise by internal division of the cells, the    contents of each forming as many parts as there are cells in the    whole colony. The young cells now escape through a cleft in the wall    of the mother cell, but are still surrounded by a delicate membrane    (Fig. 11, _E_). Within this membrane the young cells arrange    themselves in the form of the original colony, and grow together,    forming a new colony.      A much larger but rarer form is the water net (Fig. 11, _G_), in    which the colony has the form of a hollow net, the spaces being    surrounded by long cylindrical cells placed end to end. Other common    forms belong to the genus _Scenedesmus_ (Fig. 11, _F_), of which    there are many species.      ORDER II.--_Confervaceae_.    Under this head are included a number of forms of which the simplest  ones approach closely, especially in their younger stages, the  _Protococcaceae_. Indeed, some of the so-called _Protococcaceae_ are  known to be only the early stages of these plants.    A common member of this order is _Cladophora_, a coarse-branching  alga, growing commonly in running water, where it forms tufts,  sometimes a metre or more in length. By floating out a little of it in  a saucer, it is easy to see that it is made up of branching filaments.      The microscope shows (Fig. 13, _A_) that these filaments are rows of    cylindrical cells with thick walls showing evident stratification.    At intervals branches are given off, which may in turn branch,    giving rise to a complicated branching system. These branches begin    as little protuberances of the cell wall at the top of the cell.    They increase rapidly in length, and becoming slightly contracted at    the base, a wall is formed across at this point, shutting it off    from the mother cell.      The protoplasm lines the wall of the cell, and extends in the form    of thin plates across the cavity of the cell, dividing it up into a    number of irregular chambers. Imbedded in the protoplasm are    numerous flattened chloroplasts, which are so close together as to    make the protoplasm appear almost uniformly green. Within the    chloroplasts are globular, glistening bodies, called \"pyrenoids.\"    The cell has several nuclei, but they are scarcely evident in the    living cell. By placing the cells for a few hours in a one per cent    watery solution of chromic acid, then washing thoroughly and    staining with borax carmine, the nuclei will be made very evident    (Fig. 13, _B_). Such preparations may be kept permanently in dilute    glycerine.    [Illustration: FIG. 13.--_Cladophora._ _A_, a fragment of a plant,  x 50. _B_, a single cell treated with chromic acid, and stained with  alum cochineal. _n_, nucleus. _py._ pyrenoid, x 150. _C_, three stages  in the division of a cell. i, 1.45 p.m.; ii, 2.55 p.m.; iii,  4.15 p.m., x 150. _D_, a zooespore x 350.]      If a mass of actively growing filaments is examined, some of the    cells will probably be found in process of fission. The process is    very simple, and may be easily followed (Fig. 13, _C_). A ridge of    cellulose is formed around the cell wall, projecting inward, and    pushing in the protoplasm as it grows. The process is continued    until the ring closes in the middle, cutting the protoplasmic body    completely in two, and forms a firm membrane across the middle of    the cell. The protoplasm at this stage (_C_ iii.) is somewhat    contracted, but soon becomes closely applied to the new wall. The    whole process lasts, at ordinary temperatures (20 deg.-25 deg. C.), from    three to four hours.      At certain times, but unfortunately not often to be met with, the    contents of some of the cells form, by internal division, a large    number of small, naked cells (zooespores) (Fig. 13, _D_), which    escape and swim about actively for a time, and afterwards become    invested with a cell wall, and grow into a new filament. These cells    are called zooespores, from their animal-like movements. They are    provided with two cilia, closely resembling the motile cells of the    _Protococcaceae_ and _Volvocineae_.    There are very many examples of these simple _Confervaceae_, some like  _Conferva_ being simple rows of cells, others like _Stigeoclonium_  (Fig. 14, _A_), _Chaetophora_ and _Draparnaldia_ (Fig. 14, _B_, _C_),  very much branched. The two latter forms are surrounded by masses of  transparent jelly, which sometimes reach a length of several  centimetres.    [Illustration: FIG. 14.--_Confervaceae_. _A_, _Stigeoclonium_. _B_,  _Draparnaldia_, x 50. _C_, a piece of _Draparnaldia_, x 2. _D_, part  of a filament of _Conferva_, x 300.]    Among the marine forms related to these may be mentioned the sea  lettuce (_Ulva_), shown in Figure 15. The thin, bright-green,  leaf-like fronds of this plant are familiar to every seaside student.    [Illustration: FIG. 15.--A plant of sea lettuce (_Ulva_). One-half  natural size.]    Somewhat higher than _Cladophora_ and its allies, especially in the  differentiation of the reproductive parts, are the various species of  _OEdogonium_ and its relatives. There are numerous species of  _OEdogonium_ not uncommon in stagnant water growing in company with  other algae, but seldom forming masses by themselves of sufficient size  to be recognizable to the naked eye.      The plant is in structure much like _Cladophora_, except that it is    unbranched, and the cells have but a single nucleus (Fig. 16, _E_).    Even when not fruiting the filaments may usually be recognized by    peculiar cap-shaped structures at the top of some of the cells.    These arise as the result of certain peculiarities in the process of    cell division, which are too complicated to be explained here.      There are two forms of reproduction, non-sexual and sexual. In the    first the contents of certain cells escape in the form of large    zooespores (Fig. 16, _C_), of oval form, having the smaller end    colorless and surrounded by a crown of cilia. After a short period    of active motion, the zooespore comes to rest, secretes a cell wall    about itself, and the transparent end becomes flattened out into a    disc (_E_, _d_), by which it fastens itself to some object in the    water. The upper part now rapidly elongates, and dividing repeatedly    by cross walls, develops into a filament like the original one. In    many species special zooespores are formed, smaller than the ordinary    ones, that attach themselves to the filaments bearing the female    reproductive organ (ooegonium), and grow into small plants bearing    the male organ (antheridium), (Fig. 16, _B_).    [Illustration: FIG. 16.--_A_, portion of a filament of _OEdogonium_,  with two ooegonia (_og._).

The measures which the Government are  about to adopt have for their object to avoid a trial, and without a  trial no one can be condemned to death. The Armenian was tried at  the Mehkemé called that of the Stambol Effendi, before being sent to  the Porte. The Kiatib who is in prison for having uttered  blasphemies against Mahomet, was judged at the Mehkemé of Salonica,  before he was sent to Constantinople; and the Supreme Council has  declared him worthy of death, although he has not yet been  judicially and formally condemned here. The circumstance of the  Kiatib having already been tried and convicted of uttering blasphemy  against the name of Mahomet puts his life in the most imminent  danger.    I have, &c.,    (Signed) FREDERICK PISANI.              No. 10.      _Sir Stratford Canning to the Earl of Aberdeen.--(Received December  5_.)    (Extract.)                        _Buyukderé, November_ 17, 1843.    I am happy to state that a serious and salutary impression has been  made upon the Turkish Government by the communication of your  Lordship's instruction respecting the Armenian decapitated in the  streets of Constantinople. Preceded as that communication was by the  delivery of M. Guizot's impressive note, and followed, as I believe  it to have been, by the presentation of Baron Bülow's instruction to  M. de Le Coq, the Porte has felt, even in the absence of any similar  declaration from the Austrian and Russian Legations, that she cannot  with prudence or safety repeat an atrocity tending so directly to  excite the indignant feelings of Christendom against her. I have not  received, nor indeed have I yet demanded, an official answer to my  remonstrance. M. de Bourqueney, though, like myself, without  instructions on that point, has made the demand, but, at my request,  he has abstained from pressing it, agreeing, on reflection, with me,  that it would be advisable at all events to afford time for M. de  Titow to hear from his Government, and to take a step more or less  in harmony with ours. It remains indeed to be considered whether it  would be prudent, even with that advantage, to insist upon receiving  a formal answer. I have already forwarded to your Lordship's office  the substance of Rifaat Pasha's remarks, and they convey an  assurance that the Porte will in future find means to avoid the  application of the law in cases like that which proved fatal to the  unfortunate Armenian.    The apparent consequences of what has been done in this matter are,  a Ministerial understanding that occasions of calling the law into  action as to religious offences involving a capital punishment are  for the future to be avoided, and a proclamation addressed to the  Turkish authorities in Roumelia for the better treatment and  protection of the Sultan's Christian subjects.    I venture to believe that your Lordship will derive the same  gratification which I do from this result.              No. 11.      _Sir Stratford Canning to the Earl of Aberdeen_.--(_Received  December_ 18.)    My Lord,                          _Buyukderé, November_ 20, 1843.    I have the satisfaction to state, that the Russian Envoy has  informed me of his having received an instruction from his Court on  the subject of the Armenian youth decapitated at Constantinople. His  Excellency has given me to understand that the terms of this  instruction are in harmony with the sentiments of Her Majesty's  Government; and I presume that he will make me a more complete  communication of its contents the first time we meet.    I have, &c.,    (Signed) STRATFORD CANNING.              No. 12.      _Sir Stratford Canning to the Earl of Aberdeen_.--(_Received  December_ 24.)    (Extract.)                        _Constantinople, December_ l, 1843.    Having sounded Rifaat Pasha as to his intention of answering the  representations of the Five Powers concerning the late religious  execution, I was told by his Excellency that, although the Porte  wished to avoid any recurrence of that atrocity, yet, as such  executions, divested of the objectionable forms which accompanied  the Armenian's death, were obligatory under the law considered by  Mahomedans divine, and might be forced incidentally upon the  Government, it would be embarrassing to give an official declaration  to that effect. Some ostensible record of the Porte's intention to  avoid religious exeutions [sic] in future would, I humbly conceive,  be satisfactory to Her Majesty's Government, and it would not  perhaps be impossible to frame a reply, which might convey the  required security without coming into collision with the Mussulman  faith. There is reason otherwise to apprehend that the advantage now  obtained will be of very short duration.    P.S.--There is reason to fear that another religious execution has  recently taken place in the Pashalic of Brussa.              No. 13.      _Sir Stratford Canning to the Earl of Aberdeen_.--(_Received  January_ 5, 1844.)    (Extract.)                        _Buyukderé, December_ 17, 1843.    I have the honour to state, and I do so with much concern, that the  rumour, which has for some time prevailed, of another execution,  similar to that of the Armenian youth, having taken place by order  of the Porte, is now confirmed. The statements inclosed herewith  describe the circumstances as far they are known. One of them is an  extract of a despatch addressed to me by Her Majesty's Consul at  Brussa, which is at no great distance from Biligik where the Greek  was executed. The other was communicated to me by one of my  diplomatic colleagues.    Rifaat Pasha in conversing with me some time ago alluded to this  execution, of which I had then scarcely heard the rumour, and he  spoke of it as a kind of accident, which had occurred prior to the  late remonstrances respecting the Armenian, and which was not to be  taken in proof of an objectionable policy at the Porte. With a  variation of terms, and in some degree of facts also, he has offered  the same kind of vague excuse to others, and I believe in particular  to the Internuncio.    I presume that your Lordship would not approve of such an occurrence  being thrown into oblivion without an attempt at explanation, and I  am persuaded that any backwardness under such circumstances would  only serve to confirm the Porte in her present infatuated course of  policy. I have, therefore, communicated upon the subject with my  colleagues of Austria, France, Russia, and Prussia, and finding them  all substantially of the same mind, I have drawn up the instruction  of which a copy is here inclosed, and sent it to Rifaat Pasha by M.  Pisani. Similar instructions were sent in by the others, though  neither collectively, nor simultaneously, and perhaps not in writing  by the Austrian and Russian Ministers.    Your Lordship will observe that we ask for a distinct assurance from  the Porte that measures shall be taken to prevent the recurrence of  such revolting punishments in future. In proposing to make this  demand I had in view the corresponding passage in your Lordship's  instruction, communicated to Rifaat Pasha, and I thought to satisfy  M. de Bourqueney, who had presented an official note in the former  instance and applied for an answer, without exceeding the limits  which my other colleagues were prepared to observe. Their joint  acceptance of the suggestion, and their engagements to make the same  demand, induce me to hope that the Porte's reply will prove  satisfactory, though I cannot yet speak with confidence in that  respect.

A fresh instance, I learn, has unfortunately occurred about a week  ago of the sanguinary spirit of the Turkish law and people against  relapsed proselytes. A young Greek at Biligik in the adjoining  district, who had become a Mussulman and returned to his own creed,  has been put to death by hanging. He must have been a willing victim  from what my informant states, as his profession of Islamism had  been complete according to the usual rites.    P.S.--The execution of the Greek at Biligik took place, I further  learn, after the return of an answer from the Turkish Government to  a report on the case from the municipality of Biligik.

Un jeune Grec s'était fait Turc dans un moment de mauvaise humeur;  revenu a lui, il était allé trouver un prêtre et avait témoigné le  désir de rentrer dans sa croyance. L'ecclésiastique, approuvant sa  pensée, lui dit qu'il devait réparer sa faute en revenant  publiquement sur son erreur. Le jeune homme, âgé de 22 ans, fit la  chose comme elle lui était ordonnée. Aussitôt les autorités Turques  s'emparent de lui et le mettent au secret: ceci se passe aux  environs de Brousse. L'on rapporte le fait à Constantinople: ici, en  dépit des notes Française, Anglaise, &c., on tient conseil, et  l'ordre est envoyé de l'exécuter, et en effet il y a quatorze à  quinze jours cet infortuné a été pendu publiquement à Biligik.  L'effet qui cet événement a produit sur les habitans Turcs du lieu a  été tel que le Gouverneur a dû prendre les plus grandes précautions  pour empêcher le massacre de tous les habitans.
