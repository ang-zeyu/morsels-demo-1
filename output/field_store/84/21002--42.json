The darkness and the mist  had vanished with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with the  snow upon the ground.    \"Good Heaven!\" said Scrooge, clasping his hands together as he looked  about him. \"I was bred in this place. I was a boy here!\"    The Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch, though it had been  light and instantaneous, appeared still present to the old man's sense  of feeling. He was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air,  each one connected with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and  cares long, long forgotten!    \"Your lip is trembling,\" said the Ghost. \"And what is that upon your  cheek?\"    Scrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice, that it was a  pimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him where he would.    \"You recollect the way?\" inquired the Spirit.    \"Remember it!\" cried Scrooge with fervour; \"I could walk it blindfold.\"    \"Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!\" observed the Ghost.  \"Let us go on.\"    [Illustration: _\"You recollect the way?\" inquired the spirit. \"Remember  it!\" cried Scrooge with fervour; \"I could walk it blindfold.\"_]    They walked along the road, Scrooge recognising every gate, and post,  and tree, until a little market-town appeared in the distance, with its  bridge, its church, and winding river. Some shaggy ponies now were seen  trotting towards them with boys upon their backs, who called to other  boys in country gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All these boys were  in great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the broad fields were  so full of merry music, that the crisp air laughed to hear it.    \"These are but shadows of the things that have been,\" said the Ghost.  \"They have no consciousness of us.\"    The jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge knew and named  them every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them? Why  did his cold eye glisten, and his heart leap up as they went past? Why  was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry  Christmas, as they parted at cross-roads and by-ways for their several  homes? What was merry Christmas to Scrooge? Out upon merry Christmas!  What good had it ever done to him?    \"The school is not quite deserted,\" said the Ghost. \"A solitary child,  neglected by his friends, is left there still.\"    Scrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.    They left the high-road by a well-remembered lane, and soon approached a  mansion of dull red brick, with a little weather-cock surmounted cupola  on the roof and a bell hanging in it. It was a large house, but one of  broken fortunes: for the spacious offices were little used, their walls  were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their gates decayed.  Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables; and the coach-houses and  sheds were overrun with grass. Nor was it more retentive of its ancient  state within; for, entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the  open doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished, cold, and  vast. There was an earthly savour in the air, a chilly bareness in the  place, which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by  candle-light, and not too much to eat.    They went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the  back of the house. It opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare,  melancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and  desks. At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and  Scrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as  he had used to be.    Not a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice  behind the panelling, not a drip from the half-thawed water-spout in the  dull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent  poplar, not the idle swinging of an empty storehouse door, no, not a  clicking in the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with softening  influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.    The Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his younger self,  intent upon his reading. Suddenly a man in foreign garments: wonderfully  real and distinct to look at: stood outside the window, with an axe  stuck in his belt, and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.    \"Why, it's Ali Baba!\" Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. \"It's dear old  honest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know. One Christmas-time when yonder  solitary child was left here all alone, he _did_ come, for the first  time, just like that. Poor boy! And Valentine,\" said Scrooge, \"and his  wild brother, Orson; there they go! And what's his name, who was put  down in his drawers, asleep, at the gate of Damascus; don't you see him?  And the Sultan's Groom turned upside down by the Genii: there he is upon  his head! Serve him right! I'm glad of it. What business had _he_ to be  married to the Princess?\"    To hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such  subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and  to see his heightened and excited face; would have been a surprise to  his business friends in the City, indeed.    [Illustration: _\"Why, it's Ali Baba!\" Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy.  \"It's dear old honest Ali Baba.\"_]    \"There's the Parrot!\" cried Scrooge. \"Green body and yellow tail, with  a thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head; there he is!  Poor Robin Crusoe he called him, when he came home again after sailing  round the island. 'Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin  Crusoe?' The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn't. It was the  Parrot, you know. There goes Friday, running for his life to the little  creek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!\"    Then, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character,  he said, in pity for his former self, \"Poor boy!\" and cried again.    \"I wish,\" Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his pocket, and looking  about him, after drying his eyes with his cuff: \"but it's too late now.\"    \"What is the matter?\" asked the Spirit.    \"Nothing,\" said Scrooge. \"Nothing. There was a boy singing a Christmas  Carol at my door last night. I should like to have given him something:  that's all.\"    The Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand: saying, as it did so,  \"Let us see another Christmas!\"    Scrooge's former self grew larger at the words, and the room became a  little darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk, the windows cracked;  fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were  shown instead; but how all this was brought about Scrooge knew no more  than you do. He only knew that it was quite correct: that everything had  happened so; that there he was, alone again, when all the other boys had  gone home for the jolly holidays.    He was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly. Scrooge  looked at the Ghost, and, with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced  anxiously towards the door.    It opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting  in, and, putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him,  addressed him as her \"dear, dear brother.\"    \"I have come to bring you home, dear brother!\" said the child, clapping  her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh. \"To bring you home, home,  home!\"    \"Home, little Fan?\" returned the boy.    \"Yes!\" said the child, brimful of glee. \"Home for good and all. Home for  ever and ever. Father is so much kinder than he used to be, that home's  like Heaven! He spoke so gently to me one dear night when I was going to  bed, that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home;  and he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach to bring you. And  you're to be a man!\" said the child, opening her eyes; \"and are never to  come back here; but first we're to be together all the Christmas long,  and have the merriest time in all the world.\"    \"You are quite a woman, little Fan!\" exclaimed the boy.    She clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; but,  being too little, laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him.  Then she began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the door;  and he, nothing loath to go, accompanied her.    A terrible voice in the hall cried, \"Bring down Master Scrooge's box,  there!\" and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who glared on  Master Scrooge with a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a  dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him  and his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best parlour  that ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial and  terrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold. Here he produced  a decanter of curiously light wine, and a block of curiously heavy cake,  and administered instalments of those dainties to the young people: at  the same time sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of  \"something\" to the postboy who answered that he thanked the gentleman,  but, if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had rather not.  Master Scrooge's trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the  chaise, the children bade the schoolmaster good-bye right willingly;  and, getting into it, drove gaily down the garden sweep; the quick  wheels dashing the hoar frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the  evergreens like spray.    \"Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered,\" said  the Ghost. \"But she had a large heart!\"    \"So she had,\" cried Scrooge. \"You're right. I will not gainsay it,  Spirit. God forbid!\"    \"She died a woman,\" said the Ghost, \"and had, as I think, children.\"    \"One child,\" Scrooge returned.    \"True,\" said the Ghost. \"Your nephew!\"    Scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind; and answered briefly, \"Yes.\"    Although they had but that moment left the school behind them, they were  now in the busy thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19354"],[0,"Lessons in Music Form (#6)"],[1,"preparatory,--the changeable  material which flutters about the fixed center.  Therefore the  preliminary tones do not indicate the _essential_ or actual beginning  of the motive, but its apparent or conditional beginning only; or what  might be called its _melodic_ beginning.  For this reason, also, the  actual \"first measure\" of a motive or phrase or sentence of any kind is  always the first FULL measure,--the measure which contains the first  primary accent; that is to say, the preliminary tone or tones do not  count as first measure.  For this reason, further, it is evident that  preliminary tones are invariably to be regarded as borrowed from the  final measure of the preceding motive or phrase; they must be accounted  for in someway,--must derive their metric pulse from some group,--and  as they cannot be a part of the first measure, they obviously form a  borrowed portion of the (preceding) last measure.  This will be better  understood by reference to Ex. 14, No. 3; the two 16ths at the end of  the 4th measure (preliminary tones of the following phrase) are  borrowed from the _f_ which precedes,--the final tone of the first  phrase, that would, but for this reduction, have been the full  half-note necessary to complete the four measures (like the final _g_).    Perhaps the most striking feature of this rule of preliminary tones is  the absolute freedom of its application.   It is _always_ wholly  optional with the composer to begin his figure or motive at whatever  part of the measure he may elect; at the accent or not; with or without  preliminary tones; to borrow beats from the preceding ending or not, as  his judgment or taste, or possibly some indirect requirement, may  decide.  So valid is this license, that it is by no means unusual to  find consecutive members of the same phrase beginning at different  points in the measure.  This results, apparently, in motives of  irregular, unsymmetric lengths; but no confusion is possible if the  student will recollect and apply the rule that the objective point (the  heart, so to speak) of each motive is the first primary accent it  contains; counting from these points, all irregularities of melodic  extent become purely accidental and harmless.  For illustration (the  preliminary tones are marked _a_):--    [Illustration: Example 14.  Fragments of Mozart, Beethoven, and  Mendelssohn.]    In No. 1, the first motive evidently ends with the longer tone,  _g_-sharp.  In No. 2, each one of the four motives differs from the  others in length; the sum of them is, however, exactly 24 beats, or 8  measures; hence, each one is _actually_ a two-measure motive, counting  from accent to accent.  The upper numbers indicate the _actual, vital_  beginning of each motive.    This very natural, and fairly common, inequality increases the  difficulty of analysis somewhat.  A knowledge of the principal chords,  and familiarity with their manner of employment in composition, greatly  facilitates the task, because the harmonic design furnishes in many  cases the only unmistakable clue to the extremities of the melodic  members.  The difficulty finally vanishes only when the student has  learned to appreciate the declamatory quality of all good melody, and  can detect its inflections, its pauses; can _feel_ which (and how many)  of its tones are coherent and inseparable, and where the points of  repose interrupt the current, and thus divulge the sense of the melodic  sentence.      LESSON 3.--Analyze the third Song Without Words of Mendelssohn (A  major, the so-called Hunting Song); first of all, locate the principal  melody,--it is not always the uppermost line of tones; then divide this  melody into its melodic motives, marking the \"breaks\" which separate  each from the following one; the figures may be noted, also, but only  mentally.  No. 35 may also be analyzed in the same manner.          CHAPTER IV.  THE PHRASE.    THE PHRASE.--It is not altogether easy to give a precise definition of  the phrase.  Like so many of the factors which enter into the  composition of this most abstract, ideal, and intangible of the arts,  the phrase demands considerable latitude of treatment, and will not  readily submit to strict limitations or absolute technical conditions.  Perhaps the most correct definition is, that the term phrase is  equivalent to \"sentence,\" and represents the smallest musical section  that expresses a _complete_ idea; not necessarily wholly finished, and  therefore independent of other adjoining phrases, but at least as  complete _in itself_ as is an ordinary brief sentence in grammar, with  its subject, predicate, and object.  It should be sufficiently long to  establish the sense of tonality, the consciousness of beginning,  course, and ending, and should exhibit a certain (though limited)  amount of palpable and satisfying melodic and harmonic contents.  For  this reason, the Phrase, and nothing smaller, should be regarded as the  structural basis of musical form.    The factors defined in the preceding chapter (the figure and motive)  are, as a rule, decidedly less than is demanded of a complete phrase,  which--as has been intimated--usually consists in the union of two  (possibly more) motives,--just as the motive is compounded of figures,  and the latter of single tones.    In some, comparatively rare, cases the composer gives a phrase an  independent place upon his page, as complete miniature sentence, not  directly connected with other phrases.  This may be seen, very plainly,  at the beginning (the first four or five measures) of the Songs Without  Words, Nos. 28, 41, 35, 3, 4, 16.  Examine each, carefully, and the  nature of the phrase in its most definite form will become apparent.    Such independent phrases are most likely to be found, like the above,  at the beginning or end of a larger composition, to which they are  related indirectly, as isolated introduction, or postlude.  Thus, the  following complete phrase appears at the beginning of a song:    [Illustration: Example 15.  Fragment of Schubert.]    Its division into two melodic motives, and the subdivision of these  into figures, is plainly marked.    When the phrase assumes such a conspicuous position, and is so complete  and definite in its effect as the ones just seen, there is naturally no  difficulty in recognizing and defining its extremities.  But the task  of phrase analysis is by no means always thus easy.      LENGTH OF THE REGULAR PHRASE.--Fortunately for the work of analysis,  there are certain established landmarks of forms, so conscientiously  observed, and so firmly grounded in the practices of classic writing  (because the necessary consequences of natural law), that it is  generally practicable to fix fairly regular and plausible boundaries to  the phrase, notwithstanding the freedom and elasticity which  characterize the application of the syntactic principle in music.    Therefore the student will find that a phrase, in the great majority of  cases, covers exactly _four measures_, and will seldom be misled if he  looks for the end of his phrase four measures beyond its beginning.  This refers, be it understood, only to measures of average size (in the  ordinary time denominations, 3-4, 4-4, 6-8 measure).  If the measures  are uncommonly large (9-8, 12-8), the phrase will probably cover no  more than two of them; or, if small (2-4, or 3-4 in rapid tempo), the  phrase may extend to the eighth measure.  The operation of this  four-measure rule is exhibited with striking regularity and persistence  in the _Jugend Album_ of Schumann (op. 68); throughout its forty-three  numbers there are probably no more than a half-dozen phrases whose  length differs from this standard.  For example:    [Illustration: Example 16.  Fragment of Schumann, Op. 68, No. 11.]      It will be observed that the first (and also the third) of these  phrases consists of two exactly similar two-measure motives.  This  seems to lend some confirmation to the idea of a two-measure phrase;  but the student is warned against deviating from his four-measure  standard, upon such evidence as this.  Many instances will be found,  like these, in which the impression of a complete phrase is not gained  until the motive of two measures has been thus repeated; _the  repetition is necessary_, in order to finish the sentence, and this  proves that the two measures alone do not constitute the \"complete  idea\" which we expect the phrase to represent.    The same regularity of dimension will usually be found in all kinds of  dance music; in technical exercises (for instance, the etudes of Czerny  and others); and in all music of a simple or popular character.          *       *       *       *       *       *    EXCEPTIONS.--In its ordinary, normal condition the phrase is a musical  sentence four measures in length.  But this rule has its necessary  exceptions; necessary because, as we have learned, the principle of  Variety is quite as vital as that of Unity or symmetry.  The phrase is  not always regular; by various means and for various reasons, it  occasionally assumes an irregular form.  When such irregular phrases  are encountered (phrases of less or more than four measures) the  student will best distinguish them by defining their extremities, their  beginning and ending--as \"beginning\" and \"ending,\" without reference to  their length.  This should not be attended with any serious difficulty;  at least not to the observant student who reads his musical page  thoughtfully, and attaches some meaning to the figures and motives of  the melody; who endeavors to recognize the extent to which the  successive tones appear to cling together (like the letters in a word)  and constitute an unbroken melodic number,--and, in so doing, also  recognizes the points where this continuity is broken, and a new number  is announced.  Much assistance may be derived from the fact--striking  in its simplicity--that the ending of one"]]]
