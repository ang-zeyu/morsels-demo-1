Sit:  thou art my best of wishes.  Prithee, tell me    What trick didst thou invent to come to Rome    Without thy husband?      JULIA.                Why, my lord, I told him    I came to visit an old anchorite[61]    Here for devotion.      CARDINAL.           Thou art a witty false one,--    I mean, to him.      JULIA.  You have prevail'd with me    Beyond my strongest thoughts; I would not now    Find you inconstant.      CARDINAL.             Do not put thyself    To such a voluntary torture, which proceeds    Out of your own guilt.      JULIA.                  How, my lord!      CARDINAL.                              You fear    My constancy, because you have approv'd[62]    Those giddy and wild turnings in yourself.      JULIA.  Did you e'er find them?      CARDINAL.                        Sooth, generally for women,    A man might strive to make glass malleable,    Ere he should make them fixed.      JULIA.                          So, my lord.      CARDINAL.  We had need go borrow that fantastic glass    Invented by Galileo the Florentine    To view another spacious world i' th' moon,    And look to find a constant woman there.      JULIA.  This is very well, my lord.      CARDINAL.                            Why do you weep?    Are tears your justification?  The self-same tears    Will fall into your husband's bosom, lady,    With a loud protestation that you love him    Above the world.  Come, I 'll love you wisely,    That 's jealously; since I am very certain    You cannot make me cuckold.      JULIA.                       I 'll go home    To my husband.      CARDINAL.       You may thank me, lady,    I have taken you off your melancholy perch,    Bore you upon my fist, and show'd you game,    And let you fly at it.--I pray thee, kiss me.--    When thou wast with thy husband, thou wast watch'd    Like a tame elephant:--still you are to thank me:--    Thou hadst only kisses from him and high feeding;    But what delight was that?  'Twas just like one    That hath a little fing'ring on the lute,    Yet cannot tune it:--still you are to thank me.      JULIA.  You told me of a piteous wound i' th' heart,    And a sick liver, when you woo'd me first,    And spake like one in physic.[63]      CARDINAL.

Madam, a gentleman,    That 's come post from Malfi, desires to see you.      CARDINAL.  Let him enter:  I 'll withdraw.         Exit.      SERVANT.

JULIA.                    Sure, your own experience    Will satisfy you no:  our Roman prelates    Do not keep lodging for ladies.      DELIO.                           Very well:    I have brought you no commendations from your husband,    For I know none by him.      JULIA.                   I hear he 's come to Rome.      DELIO.  I never knew man and beast, of a horse and a knight,    So weary of each other.  If he had had a good back,    He would have undertook to have borne his horse,    His breech was so pitifully sore.      JULIA.                             Your laughter    Is my pity.      DELIO.  Lady, I know not whether    You want money, but I have brought you some.      JULIA.  From my husband?      DELIO.                    No, from mine own allowance.      JULIA.  I must hear the condition, ere I be bound to take it.      DELIO.  Look on 't, 'tis gold; hath it not a fine colour?      JULIA.  I have a bird more beautiful.      DELIO.                                 Try the sound on 't.      JULIA.  A lute-string far exceeds it.    It hath no smell, like cassia or civet;    Nor is it physical,[64] though some fond doctors    Persuade us seethe 't in cullises.[65] I 'll tell you,    This is a creature bred by----           [Re-enter Servant]      SERVANT.

Sir, you hear:    Pray, let me know your business and your suit    As briefly as can be.      DELIO.  With good speed:  I would wish you,    At such time as you are non-resident    With your husband, my mistress.      JULIA.  Sir, I 'll go ask my husband if I shall,    And straight return your answer.         Exit.      DELIO.                            Very fine!    Is this her wit, or honesty, that speaks thus?

Rogues do not whisper 't now, but seek to publish 't    (As servants do the bounty of their lords)    Aloud; and with a covetous searching eye,    To mark who note them.  O, confusion seize her!    She hath had most cunning bawds to serve her turn,    And more secure conveyances for lust    Than towns of garrison for service.      CARDINAL.                            Is 't possible?    Can this be certain?      FERDINAND.            Rhubarb, O, for rhubarb    To purge this choler!  Here 's the cursed day    To prompt my memory; and here 't shall stick    Till of her bleeding heart I make a sponge    To wipe it out.      CARDINAL.        Why do you make yourself    So wild a tempest?      FERDINAND.          Would I could be one,    That I might toss her palace 'bout her ears,    Root up her goodly forests, blast her meads,    And lay her general territory as waste    As she hath done her honours.      CARDINAL.                      Shall our blood,    The royal blood of Arragon and Castile,    Be thus attainted?      FERDINAND.          Apply desperate physic:    We must not now use balsamum, but fire,    The smarting cupping-glass, for that 's the mean    To purge infected blood, such blood as hers.    There is a kind of pity in mine eye,--    I 'll give it to my handkercher; and now 'tis here,    I 'll bequeath this to her bastard.      CARDINAL.                            What to do?      FERDINAND.  Why, to make soft lint for his mother's wounds,    When I have hew'd her to pieces.      CARDINAL.                         Curs'd creature!    Unequal nature, to place women's hearts    So far upon the left side![69]      FERDINAND.                  Foolish men,    That e'er will trust their honour in a bark    Made of so slight weak bulrush as is woman,    Apt every minute to sink it!      CARDINAL.  Thus ignorance, when it hath purchas'd honour,    It cannot wield it.      FERDINAND.           Methinks I see her laughing,--    Excellent hyena!  Talk to me somewhat quickly,    Or my imagination will carry me    To see her in the shameful act of sin.      CARDINAL.  With whom?      FERDINAND.             Happily with some strong-thigh'd bargeman,    Or one o' th' wood-yard that can quoit the sledge[70]    Or toss the bar, or else some lovely squire    That carries coals up to her privy lodgings.      CARDINAL.  You fly beyond your reason.      FERDINAND.                              Go to, mistress!    'Tis not your whore's milk that shall quench my wild-fire,    But your whore's blood.      CARDINAL.  How idly shows this rage, which carries you,    As men convey'd by witches through the air,    On violent whirlwinds!  This intemperate noise    Fitly resembles deaf men's shrill discourse,    Who talk aloud, thinking all other men    To have their imperfection.      FERDINAND.                   Have not you    My palsy?      CARDINAL.    Yes, [but] I can be angry    Without this rupture.  There is not in nature    A thing that makes man so deform'd, so beastly,    As doth intemperate anger.  Chide yourself.    You have divers men who never yet express'd    Their strong desire of rest but by unrest,    By vexing of themselves.  Come, put yourself    In tune.      FERDINAND.  So I will only study to seem    The thing I am not.  I could kill her now,    In you, or in myself; for I do think    It is some sin in us heaven doth revenge    By her.      CARDINAL.

The act  was desperate, but it was chivalric. The Free State, hitherto happy,  prosperous and peaceful, had nothing to gain and everything to lose. Few  of her statesmen can have doubted that Britain must prevail and that  their Republic would share the ruin which awaited the Transvaal Dutch.  Nevertheless honour and the sense of kinship prevailed. It is to be  hoped that the excited language in which the passionate feelings of the  Free State have found expression will not prevent Englishmen from  recognizing in the conduct of this little community a heroic quality  which they would admire if they met it in the annals of ancient Greece.    It has been suggested that the question of responsibility for the war is  really a trivial one, because the negotiations were all along, on one  side or on both, unreal and delusive, masking the conviction of both  parties that they must come to blows at last. It is said that a conflict  for supremacy between the English and Dutch races in South Africa was  inevitable, and it is even alleged that there was a long-standing  conspiracy among the Dutch, as well in the Colonies as in the Republics,  to overmaster the British element and oust Britain from the country.    On this hypothesis several observations may be made.    One is that it seems to be an afterthought, intended to excuse the  failure of diplomacy to untie the knot. No one who studies the  despatches can think that either the Transvaal Government or the British  Government regarded war as inevitable when the one made, and the other  sent a reply intended to accept, the proposals of August 19th. Nothing  is easier than to bring charges of bad faith, but he who peruses these  despatches with an impartial mind will find little or nothing to justify  any such imputation on either party. Another is, that the allegation  that a calamity was inevitable is one so easy to make and so hard to  refute that it is constantly employed to close an embarrassing  discussion. You cannot argue with a fatalist, any more than with a  prophet. Nations whose conscience is clear, statesmen who have foresight  and insight, do not throw the blame for their failures upon Destiny. The  chieftain in Homer, whose folly has brought disaster, says, \"It is not I  who am the cause of this: it is Zeus, and Fate, and the Fury that  walketh in darkness.\" \"It could not have been helped anyhow,\" \"It was  bound to come\"--phrases such as these are the last refuge of despairing  incompetence.    The hypothesis that the Dutch all over South Africa were leagued for the  overthrow of British power is so startling that it needs to be supported  by wide and weighty evidence. Is such evidence forthcoming? It has not  been produced. One who has not been in South Africa since 1895 dare not  rely on his own observation to deny the allegation. But neither can  Englishmen at home accept the assertions of partisans in South Africa,  the extravagance of whose language shows that they have been carried  away by party passion.    The probabilities of the case are altogether against the hypothesis, and  support the view of a temperate writer in the _Edinburgh Review_ for  October, who describes it as \"a nightmare.\" What are these  probabilities?    The Dutch in the Cape had been loyal till December 1895, and had indeed  been growing more and more loyal during the last fifteen years. The  Africander Bond had shaken itself free from the suspicions once  entertained of its designs. Its leader, Mr. Hofmeyr, was conspicuously  attached to the Imperial connection, and was, indeed, the author of a  well-known scheme for an Imperial Customs Union. Even after December,  1895, its indignation at the attack on the Transvaal had not affected  the veneration of the Dutch party for the British Crown, so warmly  expressed in 1897. In 1898 the Cape Assembly, in which there was a Dutch  majority led by a Ministry supported by the Bond, voted unanimously a  large annual contribution to Imperial naval defence. Every effort was  made by Mr. Hofmeyr and by the Prime Minister of the Cape to induce the  Transvaal to make concessions which might avert war. As regards the Free  State, its Dutch burghers had been for many years on the best terms with  their English fellow-burghers and with the British Government. They had  nothing to gain by a racial conflict, and their President, who is  understood to have suggested the Bloemfontein Conference, as well as Mr.  Fischer, one of their leading statesmen, strove hard to secure peace  till immediately before war broke out.    There was, moreover, no prospect of success for an effort to overthrow  the power of Britain. The Dutch in the Colony were not fighting men  like their Transvaal brethren, and were, except for voting purposes,  quite unorganized. Those of the Free State were a mere militia, with no  experience of war, and had possessed, at least down to 1895, when I  remember to have seen their tiny arsenal, very little in the way of war  munitions. The Transvaal Boers were no doubt well armed and good  fighters, but there were after all only some twenty or twenty-five  thousand of them, a handful to contend against the British Empire. The  Transvaal Government was, moreover, from its structure and the capacity  of the men who composed it, if not indisposed to indulge in day-dreams,  at any rate unfit to prosecute so vast an enterprise.    There seems therefore to be no foundation in any facts which have so far  been made public for the belief in this \"conspiracy of the Dutch race,\"  or for the inevitableness of the imagined conflict.    The truth would appear to be that the Transvaal people did at one time  cherish the hope of extending their Republic over the wide interior.  They were stopped on the west in 1884. They were stopped on the north in  1890. They were stopped in their effort to reach the sea in 1894. After  that year British territory surrounded them on all sides except where  they bordered the Portuguese on the north-east. Many of them, including  the President, doubtless cherished the hope of some time regaining a  complete independence such as that of the Free State. Some ardent  spirits dreamt of a Dutch South African Republic with Pretoria for its  future capital; and there were probably a few men of the same visionary  type in the Colony and the Free State who talked in the same wild way,  especially after the Jameson invasion had stirred Dutch feeling to its  depths. But from such dreams and such talk it is a long step to a  \"conspiracy of the Dutch over all South Africa.\" The possibility that  the Dutch element would some day or other prevail, a possibility to  which the slowness of British immigration and the natural growth of the  Dutch population gave a certain substance in it down to 1885, was in  that year destroyed by the discovery of gold in the Witwatersrand, which  brought a new host of English-speaking settlers into South Africa, and  assured the numerical and economic preponderance of the English in the  progressive and expanding regions of the country. It is also true that  the Transvaal Government made military preparations and imported arms on  a large scale. They expected a rising even before 1895; and after 1895  they also expected a fresh invasion. But there is not, so far as the  public know, any shred of evidence that they contemplated an attack upon  Britain. The needs of defence, a defence in which they doubtless counted  on the aid of the Free State and of a section of their own Uitlanders,  sufficiently explain the accumulation of warlike munitions on which so  much stress has been laid.    The conclusion to which an examination of the matter leads is that no  evidence whatever has been produced either that there was any such  conspiracy as alleged, or that a conflict between Dutch and English was  inevitable. Such a conflict might, no doubt, have possibly some day  arisen. But it is at least equally probable that it might have been  avoided. The Transvaal people were not likely to provoke it, and every  year made it less likely that they could do so with any chance of  success. The British element was increasing, not only around their  State, but within it. The prospect of support from a great European  Power had vanished. When their aged President retired from the scene,  their old dissensions, held in check only by the fear of Britain, would  have reappeared, and their vicious system of government would have  fallen to pieces. So far as Britain was concerned, the way to avert a  conflict was to have patience. Haste had been her bane in South Africa.  It was haste which annexed the Transvaal in 1877, when a few months'  delay might have given her the country. It was haste which in 1880  wrecked the plan of South African Confederation. It was haste which  brought about that main source of recent troubles, the invasion by the  South Africa Company's police in 1895.    In these reflections upon recent events nothing has been said, because  nothing could now be profitably said, upon two aspects of the  matter--the character and conduct of the persons chiefly concerned, and  the subterranean forces which are supposed to have been at work on both  sides. These must be left to some future historian, and they will form  an interesting chapter in his book. He will have proof positive of many  things which can now only be conjectured, and of some things which,  though they may be known to a few, ought not to be stated until proof of  them can be produced.    It is right, however, even while war is raging, to consider the  circumstances that have led to war, so far as these can be discussed  from the information which we all possess, because a fair consideration  of those circumstances ought to influence the view which Englishmen take  of their antagonists, and ought to affect their judgment of the measures  proper to be taken when war comes to "]]]
