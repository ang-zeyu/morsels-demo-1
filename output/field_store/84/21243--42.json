The  Spirit must have heard him thinking, for it said immediately--    'Your reclamation, then. Take heed!'    It put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him gently by the  arm.    'Rise! and walk with me!'    It would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the weather and the  hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes; that bed was warm, and the  thermometer a long way below freezing; that he was clad but lightly in  his slippers, dressing-gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold upon  him at that time. The grasp, though gentle as a woman's hand, was not  to be resisted. He rose; but, finding that the Spirit made towards the  window, clasped its robe in supplication.    'I am a mortal,' Scrooge remonstrated, 'and liable to fall.'    'Bear but a touch of my hand _there_,' said the Spirit, laying it upon  his heart, 'and you shall be upheld in more than this!'    As the words were spoken, they passed through the wall, and stood upon  an open country road, with fields on either hand. The city had entirely  vanished. Not a vestige of it was to be seen. The darkness and the mist  had vanished with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow  upon the ground.    'Good Heaven!' said Scrooge, clasping his hands together, as he looked  about him. 'I was bred in this place. I was a boy here!'    The Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch, though it had been  light and instantaneous, appeared still present to the old man's sense  of feeling. He was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air,  each one connected with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and  cares long, long forgotten!    'Your lip is trembling,' said the Ghost. 'And what is that upon your  cheek?'    Scrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice, that it was a  pimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him where he would.    'You recollect the way?' inquired the Spirit.    'Remember it!' cried Scrooge with fervour; 'I could walk it blindfold.'    'Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!' observed the Ghost.  'Let us go on.'    They walked along the road, Scrooge recognising every gate, and post,  and tree, until a little market-town appeared in the distance, with its  bridge, its church, and winding river. Some shaggy ponies now were seen  trotting towards them with boys upon their backs, who called to other  boys in country gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All these boys were  in great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the broad fields were  so full of merry music, that the crisp air laughed to hear it.    'These are but shadows of the things that have been,' said the Ghost.  'They have no consciousness of us.'    The jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge knew and named  them every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them? Why  did his cold eye glisten, and his heart leap up as they went past? Why  was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry  Christmas, as they parted at cross-roads and by-ways for their several  homes? What was merry Christmas to Scrooge? Out upon merry Christmas!  What good had it ever done to him?    'The school is not quite deserted,' said the Ghost. 'A solitary child,  neglected by his friends, is left there still.'    Scrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.    They left the high-road by a well-remembered lane and soon approached a  mansion of dull red brick, with a little weather-cock surmounted cupola  on the roof, and a bell hanging in it. It was a large house, but one of  broken fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls  were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their gates decayed.  Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables; and the coach-houses and  sheds were overrun with grass. Nor was it more retentive of its ancient  state within; for, entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the  open doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished, cold, and  vast. There was an earthy savour in the air, a chilly bareness in the  place, which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by  candle light and not too much to eat.    They went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the back  of the house. It opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare,  melancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and  desks. At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and  Scrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as  he had used to be.    Not a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice  behind the panelling, not a drip from the half-thawed waterspout in the  dull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent  poplar, not the idle swinging of an empty storehouse door, no, not a  clicking in the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with softening  influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.    The Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his younger self,  intent upon his reading. Suddenly a man in foreign garments, wonderfully  real and distinct to look at, stood outside the window, with an axe  stuck in his belt, and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.    'Why, it's Ali Baba!' Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. 'It's dear old  honest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know. One Christmas-time, when yonder  solitary child was left here all alone, he _did_ come, for the first  time, just like that. Poor boy! And Valentine,' said Scrooge, 'and his  wild brother, Orson; there they go! And what's his name, who was put  down in his drawers, asleep, at the gate of Damascus; don't you see him?  And the Sultan's Groom turned upside down by the Genii; there he is upon  his head! Serve him right! I'm glad of it. What business had he to be  married to the Princess?'    To hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such  subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and  to see his heightened and excited face; would have been a surprise to  his business friends in the City, indeed.    'There's the Parrot!' cried Scrooge. 'Green body and yellow tail, with a  thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head; there he is!  Poor Robin Crusoe he called him, when he came home again after sailing  round the island. \"Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin  Crusoe?\" The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn't. It was the  Parrot, you know. There goes Friday, running for his life to the little  creek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!'    Then, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character,  he said, in pity for his former self, 'Poor boy!' and cried again.    'I wish,' Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his pocket, and looking  about him, after drying his eyes with his cuff; 'but it's too late now.'    'What is the matter?' asked the Spirit.    'Nothing,' said Scrooge. 'Nothing. There was a boy singing a Christmas  carol at my door last night. I should like to have given him something:  that's all.'    The Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand, saying as it did so,  'Let us see another Christmas!'    Scrooge's former self grew larger at the words, and the room became a  little darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk, the windows cracked;  fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were  shown instead; but how all this was brought about Scrooge knew no more  than you do. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything had  happened so; that there he was, alone again, when all the other boys had  gone home for the jolly holidays.    He was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly. Scrooge  looked at the Ghost, and, with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced  anxiously towards the door.    It opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting  in, and, putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him,  addressed him as her 'dear, dear brother.'    'I have come to bring you home, dear brother!' said the child, clapping  her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh. 'To bring you home, home,  home!'    'Home, little Fan?' returned the boy.    'Yes!' said the child, brimful of glee. 'Home for good and all. Home for  ever and ever. Father is so much kinder than he used to be, that home's  like heaven! He spoke so gently to me one dear night when I was going to  bed, that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home;  and he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach to bring you. And  you're to be a man!' said the child, opening her eyes; 'and are never to  come back here; but first we're to be together all the Christmas long,  and have the merriest time in all the world.'    'You are quite a woman, little Fan!' exclaimed the boy.    She clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; but,  being too little laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him. Then  she began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the door; and  he, nothing loath to go, accompanied her.    A terrible voice in the hall cried, 'Bring down Master Scrooge's box,  there!' and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who glared on  Master Scrooge with a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a  dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him  and his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best parlour  that ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial and  terrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold. Here he produced  a decanter of curiously light wine, and a block of curiously heavy cake,  and administered instalments of those dainties to the young people; at  the same time sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of  'something' to the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman,  but, if it was the same tap as he had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24025"],[0,"The New Girl at St. Chad's: A Story of School Life (#6)"],[1,"a wet  sponge full in Honor's face, while at the same moment Maisie wrenched  back the bed-clothes with a relentless hand.    \"We're doing you a real kindness, so you needn't be cross, Miss Paddy  Pepper-box!\" said Lettice. \"Just wait till you've seen Miss Maitland  scowl at a late-comer, and you'll give us a vote of thanks.\"    \"I'm not cross,\" said Honor, laughing in spite of the violation of her  slumbers. Lettice spoke so merrily, it was impossible to take offence,  even at the nickname. \"But I think you use rather summary measures. The  sponge was horribly cold and nasty.\"    \"It's the only way to get people to bestir themselves,\" said Lettice  complacently. \"I've had experience with sleepy room-mates before.\"    \"We always try the water cure at St. Chad's,\" added Maisie. \"We've  given you quite mild treatment, as it was a first case; we might have  used your bedroom jug, instead of a sponge.\"    Owing to her companions' efforts, Honor was in time for breakfast--a  fortunate circumstance for her, as, after the episode at the tea-table  on the preceding evening, her house-mistress would not have been ready  to overlook any deficiency in punctuality.    There was always a short recess between breakfast and chapel, which the  girls called a \"breathing space\", and during which they could revise  exercises, sharpen lead pencils, and take a last peep at lessons. This  morning everybody seemed to be assembling in the dressing-room for this  brief interval, and there Honor repaired with the others.    \"I hear you've been put in the Lower Third, Paddy,\" said Lettice  Talbot. \"Vivian Holmes told me so just now. It's my form. Maisie and  Pauline are in it too.\"    \"Isn't Maisie above you?\" asked Honor, looking at the sisters, the  elder of whom overtopped the younger by nearly a head. \"She is in  inches, at any rate.\"    \"I'm only a year older than Lettice, though I am so much taller,\"  explained Maisie. \"I suppose I ought to be in a higher form, but she  always manages to catch me up. I make up my mind every term I'm going  to win a double remove and leave her behind, yet somehow it never  happens to come off. I'm much better at cricket and hockey than at  French and algebra. But after all, it's rather convenient to have her  in the same form: she's sure to remember what the lesson is when I  forget, and I can borrow her books if I lose my own.\"    \"Yes, I have to work for both,\" complained Lettice. \"Maisie won't even  copy her exercise questions; she always relies on me.\"    Maisie certainly made her younger sister useful. She expected her to  fetch and carry, tidy both their cubicles, and generally maintain a  very subservient and inferior position. On the other hand, though she  tyrannized over Lettice herself, she would not allow anybody else to do  so, and was ready to take her part and fight her battles against the  whole school.    \"I'm glad we're in the same class,\" remarked Honor, with an approving  glance at Lettice's round, smiling face. \"Perhaps I shall ask you to  copy the exercise questions too. My memory is not particularly good  where lessons are concerned. Who else is in the Lower Third?\"    \"Ruth Latimer, my greatest chum.\"    \"We allow ourselves chums,\" put in Maisie, \"but we're not at all  romantic at Chessington. We don't swear eternal friendships, and  exchange locks of hair, and walk about the College with our arms  clasped round each other's necks, and write each other sentimental  notes, with 'sweetest' and 'darling' and 'fondest love' in them. That's  what Miss Maitland calls 'early Victorian'. We're very matter of fact  here. Still, when we choose a chum we generally stick to her, and don't  go in for all that nonsense of 'getting out of friends', or not  speaking, as they do at some schools.\"    Honor was about to ask more questions, but at that moment Vivian  Holmes, the monitress and head girl of the house, came bustling into  the room.    \"You haven't got your sailor and jersey yet, Honor Fitzgerald,\" she  said. \"Miss Maitland asked me to give them to you. Here they are, both  marked with your name, so that they needn't be mixed up with anybody  else's. You're to take this hook, and this compartment for your shoes,  and this locker to keep your books in. I've put labels on them all.\"    Honor looked without enthusiasm at the knitted woollen coat, and with  marked disfavour at the white sailor hat, with its band of orange  ribbon.    \"I can't wear that!\" she ejaculated.    \"Why not?\" enquired Vivian, in surprise.    \"There's an orange band round it.\"    \"Orange is the St. Chad's colour,\" explained Vivian. \"We all have  exactly the same hats at Chessington, but each house has its own  special ribbon--blue for the School House, pink for St. Aldwyth's,  scarlet for St. Hilary's, and violet for St. Bride's. I thought you  knew that already.\"    \"If I had, I'd have insisted upon going to another house,\" declared  Honor tragically. \"You ask me to wear orange? Why, the very name of  'Orangeman' sets my teeth on edge. I'm a Nationalist to the last drop  of my blood; we all are, down in Kerry.\"    Vivian smiled.    \"Don't be absurd!\" she said, in rather an off-hand manner. \"Our hats  have nothing whatever to do with politics. Here are two long pins, but  if you prefer an elastic you can stitch one on,\" and without deigning  to argue further she walked away.    Honor stood turning the hat round and round, with a very queer  expression on her face. She was a devoted daughter of Erin. Her  country's former glories and the possible brilliance of its future as a  separate kingdom could always provoke her wildest enthusiasm; to be  asked, therefore, to don the colour which in her native land stood as  the symbol of the union with England, and for direct opposition to  national independence, seemed to her little short of an insult to her  dear Emerald Isle. There were still five minutes left before she need  start for chapel, so, making up her mind suddenly, she rushed upstairs  to her bedroom. She would show these Saxons that she was a true Celt!  They might compel her to wear their emblem of bondage, but it should be  with an addition that would proclaim her patriotic sentiments to the  world.    Hurriedly hunting in her top drawer, she produced a yard of vivid green  ribbon and the bunch of imitation shamrock that old Mary O'Grady had  given her as a parting present. Then she set to work on a piece of  amateur millinery. There was little time to use needle and thread, but  with the aid of pins she managed to twist the ribbon into several  loops, and to fasten the shamrock conspicuously in front. She looked at  the result of her labours with great approval.    \"One could almost imagine it was St. Patrick's Day,\" she said to  herself. \"Nobody could possibly mistake me now for a Unionist. I'm  labelled 'Home Rule' as plainly as can be.\" Then, hastily pinning on  her hat before the mirror, she ran downstairs, humming under her breath:        \"So we'll bide our time; our banner yet        And motto shall be seen,      And voices shout the chorus out,        'The Wearin' o' the Green'!\"    The girls at Chessington College were all dressed exactly alike, in a  uniform costume of blue serge skirts, with blue or white cotton blouses  for summer, and flannel ones for winter. On Sundays they wore white  serge coats and skirts, and for evenings white muslin or nuns' veiling.  They were allowed a little latitude in the way of embroideries with  respect to best frocks, but their everyday, ordinary clothes were  required to be of the school pattern, with the addition of sailor hats  and knitted coats, for use in running across the quadrangle on wet or  cold days. Miss Cavendish considered that this rule encouraged  simplicity, and provided against any undue extravagance in the matter  of dress. She did not allow rings or bracelets to be worn, and the sole  vanity permitted to the girls was in the choice of their hair ribbons.    Punctually at twenty-five minutes past eight each morning the bell in  the little chapel began to give warning, and by half-past every member  of the school was expected to have taken her seat, and to be ready for  the short service held there daily by the senior curate of the parish  church at Dunscar. In twos and threes and small groups the girls came  hurrying in answer to the call of the tinkling bell. Though they  laughed and talked as they ran across the quadrangle, they sobered down  as they neared the door, and, each taking a Prayer Book from a pile  laid ready in the porch, passed silently and reverently into the  chapel. Every house had its own special rows of seats, and the sailor  hats that mingled like a kaleidoscope in the grounds were here divided  into their several sets of colours, though sometimes varied by a gleam  of ruby or amber falling from the stained-glass windows above. The  singing was musical and the responses hearty, while into his five  minutes' explanation of the lesson for the day the clergyman generally  managed to compress much helpful thought, sending away some, at least,  of his hearers braced up for the duties that awaited them.    On this particular morning anyone accustomed to the ordinary atmosphere  of the place might have been aware that something of an unusual  character was in the air.    There was an undercurrent of unrest, a turning of heads, a subdued  rustling, even an occasional whisper; and the head mistress, realizing  at last that some outside cause must be distracting the minds of her  pupils, glanced up, and, following the direction of all eyes, saw a  sight that filled her with unfeigned astonishment. Among the neat rows  of orange-banded sailor hats in the benches marked \"St. Chad's\" was one  trimmed with large and obtrusive knots of emerald-green ribbon, which  drooped over the brim, while a bunch of imitation shamrock finished the  front. It seemed to stand out so conspicuously from its fellows that it  resembled a succulent"]]]
