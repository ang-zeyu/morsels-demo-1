It was seated on a twig that overhung Peterkin's head, and I  was speedily lost in admiration of its bright-green plumage, which was  mingled with other gay colours.  While I looked I observed that the bird  turned its head slowly from side to side and looked downwards, first  with the one eye and then with the other.  On glancing downwards I  observed that Peterkin's mouth was wide open, and that this remarkable  bird was looking into it.  Peterkin used to say that I had not an atom  of fun in my composition, and that I never could understand a joke.  In  regard to the latter, perhaps he was right; yet I think that, when they  were explained to me, I understood jokes as well as most people.  But in  regard to the former, he must certainly have been wrong, for this bird  seemed to me to be extremely funny; and I could not help thinking that  if it should happen to faint, or slip its foot, and fall off the twig  into Peterkin's mouth, he would perhaps think it funny too!  Suddenly  the paroquet bent down its head and uttered a loud scream in his face.  This awoke him, and with a cry of surprise, he started up, while the  foolish bird flew precipitately away.    \"Oh, you monster!\" cried Peterkin, shaking his fist at the bird.  Then  he yawned, and rubbed his eyes, and asked what o'clock it was.    I smiled at this question, and answered that, as our watches were at the  bottom of the sea, I could not tell, but it was a little past sunrise.    Peterkin now began to remember where we were.  As he looked up into the  bright sky, and snuffed the scented air, his eyes glistened with  delight, and he uttered a faint \"Hurrah!\" and yawned again.  Then he  gazed slowly round, till, observing the calm sea through an opening in  the bushes, he started suddenly up as if he had received an electric  shock, uttered a vehement shout, flung off his garments, and rushing  over the white sands, plunged into the water.  The cry awoke Jack, who  rose on his elbow with a look of grave surprise; but this was followed  by a quiet smile of intelligence on seeing Peterkin in the water.  With  an energy that he only gave way to in moments of excitement, Jack  bounded to his feet, threw off his clothes, shook back his hair, and  with a lion-like spring, dashed over the sands and plunged into the sea  with such force as quite to envelop Peterkin in a shower of spray.  Jack  was a remarkably good swimmer and diver, so that after his plunge we saw  no sign of him for nearly a minute, after which he suddenly emerged,  with a cry of joy, a good many yards out from the shore.  My spirits  were so much raised by seeing all this that I, too, hastily threw off my  garments and endeavoured to imitate Jack's vigorous bound; but I was so  awkward that my foot caught on a stump, and I fell to the ground.  Then  I slipped on a stone while running over the sand and nearly fell again,  much to the amusement of Peterkin, who laughed heartily and called me a  \"slow coach;\" while Jack cried out, \"Come along, Ralph, and I'll help  you!\"  However, when I got into the water I managed very well; for I was  really a good swimmer and diver too.  I could not, indeed, equal Jack,  who was superior to any Englishman I ever saw; but I infinitely  surpassed Peterkin, who could only swim a little, and could not dive at  all.    While Peterkin enjoyed himself in the shallow water and in running along  the beach, Jack and I swam out into the deep water and occasionally  dived for stones.  I shall never forget my surprise and delight on first  beholding the bottom of the sea.  As I have before stated, the water  within the reef was as calm as a pond; and as there was no wind, it was  quite clear from the surface to the bottom, so that we could see down  easily even at a depth of twenty or thirty yards.  When Jack and I dived  into shallower water we expected to have found sand and stones, instead  of which we found ourselves in what appeared really to be an enchanted  garden.  The whole of the bottom of the lagoon, as we called the calm  water within the reef, was covered with coral of every shape, size, and  hue.  Some portions were formed like large mushrooms; others appeared  like the brain of a man, having stalks or necks attached to them; but  the most common kind was a species of branching coral, and some portions  were of a lovely pale-pink colour, others were pure white.  Among this  there grew large quantities of seaweed of the richest hues imaginable,  and of the most graceful forms; while innumerable fishes--blue, red,  yellow, green, and striped--sported in and out amongst the flower-beds  of this submarine garden, and did not appear to be at all afraid of our  approaching them.    On darting to the surface for breath after our first dive, Jack and I  rose close to each other.    \"Did you ever in your life, Ralph, see anything so lovely?\" said Jack as  he flung the spray from his hair.    \"Never,\" I replied.  \"It appears to me like fairy realms.  I can  scarcely believe that we are not dreaming.\"    \"Dreaming!\" cried Jack.  \"Do you know, Ralph, I'm half-tempted to think  that we really are dreaming!  But if so, I am resolved to make the most  of it and dream another dive; so here goes--down again, my boy!\"    We took the second dive together, and kept beside each other while under  water; and I was greatly surprised to find that we could keep down much  longer than I ever recollect having done in our own seas at home.  I  believe that this was owing to the heat of the water, which was so warm  that we afterwards found we could remain in it for two and three hours  at a time without feeling any unpleasant effects such as we used to  experience in the sea at home.  When Jack reached the bottom, he grasped  the coral stems and crept along on his hands and knees, peeping under  the seaweed and among the rocks.  I observed him, also, pick up one or  two large oysters and retain them in his grasp, as if he meant to take  them up with him; so I also gathered a few.  Suddenly he made a grasp at  a fish with blue and yellow stripes on its back, and actually touched  its tail, but did not catch it.  At this he turned towards me and  attempted to smile; but no sooner had he done so than he sprang like an  arrow to the surface, where, on following him, I found him gasping and  coughing and spitting water from his mouth.  In a few minutes he  recovered, and we both turned to swim ashore.    \"I declare, Ralph,\" said he, \"that I actually tried to laugh under  water!\"    \"So I saw,\" I replied; \"and I observed that you very nearly caught that  fish by the tail.  It would have done capitally for breakfast, if you  had.\"    \"Breakfast enough here,\" said he, holding up the oysters as we landed  and ran up the beach.--\"Hallo, Peterkin!  Here you are, boy! split open  these fellows while Ralph and I put on our clothes.  They'll agree with  the cocoa-nuts excellently, I have no doubt.\"    Peterkin, who was already dressed, took the oysters and opened them with  the edge of our axe, exclaiming, \"Now, that's capital!  There's nothing  I'm so fond of.\"    \"Ah! that's lucky,\" remarked Jack.  \"I'll be able to keep you in good  order now, Master Peterkin.  You know you can't dive any better than a  cat.  So, sir, whenever you behave ill you shall have no oysters for  breakfast.\"    \"I'm very glad that our prospect of breakfast is so good,\" said I, \"for  I'm very hungry.\"    \"Here, then, stop your mouth with that, Ralph,\" said Peterkin, holding a  large oyster to my lips.  I opened my mouth and swallowed it in silence,  and really it was remarkably good.    We now set ourselves earnestly about our preparations for spending the  day.  We had no difficulty with the fire this morning as our  burning-glass was an admirable one; and while we roasted a few oysters  and ate our cocoa-nuts, we held a long, animated conversation about our  plans for the future.  What those plans were, and how we carried them  into effect, the reader shall see hereafter.        CHAPTER SIX.    AN EXCURSION INTO THE INTERIOR IN WHICH WE MAKE MANY VALUABLE AND  INTERESTING DISCOVERIES--WE GET A DREADFUL FRIGHT--THE BREAD-FRUIT  TREE--WONDERFUL PECULIARITY OF SOME OF THE FRUIT-TREES--SIGNS OF FORMER  INHABITANTS.    Our first care, after breakfast, was to place the few articles we  possessed in the crevice of a rock at the farther end of a small cave  which we discovered near our encampment.  This cave, we hoped, might be  useful to us afterwards as a storehouse.  Then we cut two large clubs  off a species of very hard tree which grew near at hand.  One of these  was given to Peterkin, the other to me, and Jack armed himself with the  axe.  We took these precautions because we purposed to make an excursion  to the top of the mountains of the interior, in order to obtain a better  view of our island.  Of course we knew not what dangers might befall us  by the way, so thought it best to be prepared.    Having completed our arrangements and carefully extinguished our fire,  we sallied forth and walked a short distance along the sea-beach till we  came to the entrance of a valley, through which flowed the rivulet  before mentioned.  Here we turned our backs on the sea and struck into  the interior.    The prospect that burst upon our view on entering the valley was truly  splendid.  On either side of us there was a gentle rise in the land,  which thus formed two ridges, about a mile apart, on each side of the  valley.  These ridges--which, as well as the low grounds between them,  were covered with trees and shrubs of the most luxuriant kind--continued  to recede inland for about two miles, when they joined the foot of a  small mountain.  This hill rose rather abruptly from the head of the  valley, and was likewise entirely covered, even to the top, with trees--  except on one particular spot near the left shoulder, where was a bare  and rocky place of a broken and savage character.

In the first place, though in this equation no water appears, the  presence of the latter is found to be indispensable for saponification  to take place; in fact, the water must be regarded as actually  decomposing the oil or fat, caustic soda or potash merely acting as a  catalytic agent. Further, since in the glycerides there are three acid  radicles to be separated from glycerol, their saponification can be  supposed to take place in three successive stages, which are the  converse of the formation of mono- and diglycerides in the synthesis of  triglycerides from fatty acids and glycerine. Thus, the above equation  may be regarded as a summary of the following three:--                               _                        _                            | OR                     | OH            (i.)

This theory is not accepted, however, by all investigators. Balbiano and  Marcusson doubt the validity of Lewkowitsch's conclusions, and Fanto,  experimenting on the saponification of olive oil with caustic potash, is  unable to detect the intermediate formation of any mono- or diglyceride,  and concludes that in homogeneous solution the saponification is  practically quadrimolecular. Kreeman, on the other hand, from  physico-chemical data, supports the view of Geitel and Lewkowitsch that  saponification is bimolecular, and though the evidence seems to favour  this theory, the matter cannot be regarded as yet definitely settled.    Hydrolysis can be brought about by water alone, if sufficient time is  allowed, but as the process is extremely slow, it is customary in  practice to accelerate the reaction by the use of various methods, which  include (i.) the application of heat or electricity, (ii.) action of  enzymes, and (iii.) treatment with chemicals; the accelerating effect of  the two latter methods is due to their emulsifying power.    The most usual method adopted in the manufacture of soap is to hydrolyse  the fat or oil by caustic soda or potash, the fatty acids liberated at  the same time combining with the catalyst, _i.e._, soda or potash, to  form soap. Hitherto the other processes of hydrolysis have been employed  chiefly for the preparation of material for candles, for which purpose  complete separation of the glycerol in the first hydrolysis is not  essential, since the fatty matter is usually subjected to a second  treatment with sulphuric acid to increase the proportion of solid fatty  acids. The colour of the resulting fatty acids is also of no importance,  as they are always subjected to distillation.    During the last few years, however, there has been a growing attempt to  first separate the glycerol from the fatty acids, and then convert the  latter into soap by treatment with the carbonates of soda or potash,  which are of course considerably cheaper than the caustic alkalies, but  cannot be used in the actual saponification of a neutral fat. The two  processes chiefly used for this purpose are those in which the reaction  is brought about by enzymes or by Twitchell's reagent.    I. _Application of Heat or Electricity._--Up to temperatures of 150 deg. C.  the effect of water on oils and fats is very slight, but by passing  superheated steam through fatty matter heated to 200 deg.-300 deg. C. the  neutral glycerides are completely decomposed into glycerol and fatty  acids according to the equation--        C_{3}H_{5}(OR)_{3} + 3H.OH = C_{3}H_{5}(OH)_{3} + 3ROH.    The fatty acids and glycerol formed distil over with the excess of  steam, and by arranging a series of condensers, the former, which  condense first, are obtained almost alone in the earlier ones, and an  aqueous solution of glycerine in the later ones. This method of  preparation of fatty acids is extensively used in France for the  production of stearine for candle-manufacture, but the resulting  product is liable to be dark coloured, and to yield a dark soap. To  expose the acids to heat for a minimum of time, and so prevent  discoloration, Mannig has patented (Germ. Pat. 160,111) a process  whereby steam under a pressure of 8 to 10 atmospheres is projected  against a baffle plate mounted in a closed vessel, where it mixes with  the fat or oil in the form of a spray, the rate of hydrolysis being  thereby, it is claimed, much increased.    Simpson (Fr. Pat. 364,587) has attempted to accelerate further the  decomposition by subjecting oils or fats to the simultaneous action of  heat and electricity. Superheated steam is passed into the oil, in which  are immersed the two electrodes connected with a dynamo or battery, the  temperature not being allowed to exceed 270 deg. C.    II. _Action of Enzymes._--It was discovered by Muntz in 1871 (_Annales  de Chemie_, xxii.) that during germination of castor seeds a quantity of  fatty acid was developed in the seeds, which he suggested might be due  to the decomposition of the oil by the embryo acting as a ferment.  Schutzenberger in 1876 showed that when castor seeds are steeped in  water, fatty acids and glycerol are liberated, and attributed this to  the hydrolytic action of an enzyme present in the seeds. No evidence of  the existence of such a ferment was adduced, however, till 1890, when  Green (_Roy. Soc. Proc._, 48, 370) definitely proved the presence in the  seeds of a ferment capable of splitting up the oil into fatty acid and  glycerol.    The first experimenters to suggest any industrial application of this  enzymic hydrolysis were Connstein, Hoyer and Wartenburg, who  (_Berichte_, 1902, 35, pp. 3988-4006) published the results of a lengthy  investigation of the whole subject. They found that tallow, cotton-seed,  palm, olive, almond, and many other oils, were readily hydrolysed by the  castor-seed ferment in the presence of dilute acid, but that cocoa-nut  and palm-kernel oils only decomposed with difficulty. The presence of  acidity is essential for the hydrolysis to take place, the most suitable  strength being one-tenth normal, and the degree of hydrolysis is  proportional to the quantity of ferment present. Sulphuric, phosphoric,  acetic or butyric acids, or sodium bisulphate, may be used without much  influence on the result. Butyric acid is stated to be the best, but in  practice is too expensive, and acetic acid is usually adopted. The  emulsified mixture should be allowed to stand for twenty-four hours, and  the temperature should not exceed 40 deg. C.; at 50 deg. C. the action is  weakened, and at 100 deg. C. ceases altogether.    Several investigators have since examined the hydrolysing power of  various other seeds, notably Braun and Behrendt (_Berichte_, 1903, 36,  1142-1145, 1900-1901, and 3003-3005), who, in addition to confirming  Connstein, Hoyer and Wartenburg's work with castor seeds, have made  similar experiments with jequirity seeds (_Abrus peccatorius_)  containing the enzyme abrin, emulsin from crushed almonds, the leaves of  _Arctostaphylos Uva Ursi_, containing the glucoside arbutin, myrosin  from black mustard-seed, gold lac (_Cheirantus cheiri_) and crotin from  croton seeds. Jequirity seeds were found to have a stronger decomposing  action on lanoline and carnauba wax than the castor seed, but only  caused decomposition of castor oil after the initial acidity was first  neutralised with alkali. Neither emulsin, arbutin nor crotin have any  marked hydrolytic action on castor oil, but myrosin is about half as  active as castor seeds, except in the presence of potassium myronate,  when no decomposition occurs.    S. Fokin (_J. russ. phys. chem. Ges._, 35, 831-835, and _Chem. Rev.  Fett. u. Harz. Ind._, 1904, 30 _et seq._) has examined the hydrolytic  action of a large number of Russian seeds, belonging to some thirty  different families, but although more than half of these brought about  the hydrolysis of over 10 per cent. of fat, he considers that in only  two cases, _viz._, the seeds of _Chelidonium majus_ and _Linaria  vulgaris_, is the action due to enzymes, these being the only two seeds  for which the yield of fatty acids is proportional to the amount of seed  employed, while in many instances hydrolysis was not produced when the  seeds were old. The seeds of _Chelidonium majus_ were found to have as  great, and possibly greater, enzymic activity than castor seeds, but  those of _Linaria_ are much weaker, twenty to thirty parts having only  the same lipolytic activity as four to five parts of castor seeds.    The high percentage of free acids found in rice oil has led C. A. Brown,  jun. (_Journ. Amer. Chem. Soc._, 1903, 25, 948-954), to examine the rice  bran, which proves to have considerable enzymic activity, and rapidly  effects the hydrolysis of glycerides.    The process for the utilisation of enzymic hydrolysis in the separation  of fatty acids from glycerine on the industrial scale, as originally  devised by Connstein and his collaborators, consisted in rubbing a  quantity of the coarsely crushed castor seeds with part of the oil or  fat, then adding the rest of the oil, together with acidified water  (N/10"]]]
