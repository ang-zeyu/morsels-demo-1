Very likely the saints would have got the  credit of helping them if they had helped themselves; but the poor  cowards never stirred a finger to clean out their close, reeking huts,  or rid the damp streets of the rotting accumulation of months. I think  their chief reliance was on \"the yellow woman from Jamaica with the  cholera medicine.\" Nor was this surprising; for the Spanish doctor,  who was sent for from Panama, became nervous and frightened at the  horrors around him, and the people soon saw that he was not familiar  with the terrible disease he was called upon to do battle with, and  preferred trusting to one who was.    It must be understood that many of those who could afford to pay for  my services did so handsomely, but the great majority of my patients  had nothing better to give their doctress than thanks. The best part  of my practice lay amongst the American store and hotel keepers, the  worst among the native boatmen and muleteers. These latter died by  scores, and among them I saw some scenes of horror I would fain  forget, if it were possible. One terrible night, passed with some of  them, has often haunted me. I will endeavour to narrate it, and should  the reader be supposed to think it highly coloured and doubtful, I  will only tell him that, terrible as it seems, I saw almost as fearful  scenes on the Crimean peninsula among British men, a few thousand  miles only from comfort and plenty.    It was late in the evening when the largest mule-owner in Cruces came  to me and implored me to accompany him to his kraal, a short distance  from the town, where he said some of his men were dying. One in  particular, his head muleteer, a very valuable servant, he was most  selfishly anxious for, and, on the way thither, promised me a large  remuneration if I should succeed in saving him. Our journey was not a  long one, but it rained hard, and the fields were flooded, so that it  took us some time to reach the long, low hut which he called his home.  I would rather not see such another scene as the interior of that hut  presented. Its roof scarcely sheltered its wretched inmates from the  searching rain; its floor was the damp, rank turf, trodden by the  mules' hoofs and the muleteers' feet into thick mud. Around, in dirty  hammocks, and on the damp floor, were the inmates of this wretched  place, male and female, the strong and the sick together, breathing  air that nearly choked me, accustomed as I had grown to live in impure  atmosphere; for beneath the same roof the mules, more valuable to  their master than his human servants, were stabled, their fore-feet  locked, and beside them were heaps of saddles, packs, and harness. The  groans of the sufferers and the anxiety and fear of their comrades  were so painful to hear and witness, that for a few minutes I felt an  almost uncontrollable impulse to run out into the stormy night, and  flee from this plague-spot. But the weak feeling vanished, and I set  about my duty. The mule-owner was so frightened that he did not  hesitate to obey orders, and, by my directions, doors and shutters  were thrown open, fires were lighted, and every effort made to  ventilate the place; and then, with the aid of the frightened women, I  applied myself to my poor patients. Two were beyond my skill. Death  alone could give them relief. The others I could help. But no words of  mine could induce them to bear their terrible sufferings like men.  They screamed and groaned, not like women, for few would have been so  craven-hearted, but like children; calling, in the intervals of  violent pain, upon Jesu, the Madonna, and all the saints of heaven  whom their lives had scandalised. I stayed with them until midnight,  and then got away for a little time. But I had not long been quiet,  before the mule-master was after me again. The men were worse; would I  return with him. The rain was drifting heavily on the thatched roof,  as it only does in tropical climates, and I was tired to death; but I  could not resist his appeal. He had brought with him a pair of tall,  thick boots, in which I was to wade through the flooded fields; and  with some difficulty I again reached the kraal. I found the worst  cases sinking fast, one of the others had relapsed, while fear had  paralysed the efforts of the rest. At last I restored some order; and,  with the help of the bravest of the women, fixed up rude screens  around the dying men. But no screens could shut out from the others  their awful groans and cries for the aid that no mortal power could  give them. So the long night passed away; first a deathlike stillness  behind one screen, and then a sudden silence behind the other, showing  that the fierce battle with death was over, and who had been the  victor. And, meanwhile, I sat before the flickering fire, with my last  patient in my lap--a poor, little, brown-faced orphan infant, scarce a  year old, was dying in my arms, and I was powerless to save it. It may  seem strange, but it is a fact, that I thought more of that little  child than I did of the men who were struggling for their lives, and  prayed very earnestly and solemnly to God to spare it. But it did not  please Him to grant my prayer, and towards morning the wee spirit  left this sinful world for the home above it had so lately left, and  what was mortal of the little infant lay dead in my arms. Then it was  that I began to think--how the idea first arose in my mind I can  hardly say--that, if it were possible to take this little child and  examine it, I should learn more of the terrible disease which was  sparing neither young nor old, and should know better how to do battle  with it. I was not afraid to use my baby patient thus. I knew its fled  spirit would not reproach me, for I had done all I could for it in  life--had shed tears over it, and prayed for it.    It was cold grey dawn, and the rain had ceased, when I followed the  man who had taken the dead child away to bury it, and bribed him to  carry it by an unfrequented path down to the river-side, and accompany  me to the thick retired bush on the opposite bank. Having persuaded  him thus much, it was not difficult, with the help of silver arguments  to convince him that it would be for the general benefit and his own,  if I could learn from this poor little thing the secret inner workings  of our common foe; and ultimately he stayed by me, and aided me in my  first and last _post mortem_ examination. It seems a strange deed to  accomplish, and I am sure I could not wield the scalpel or the  substitute I then used now, but at that time the excitement had  strung my mind up to a high pitch of courage and determination; and  perhaps the daily, almost hourly, scenes of death had made me somewhat  callous. I need not linger on this scene, nor give the readers the  results of my operation; although novel to me, and decidedly useful,  they were what every medical man well knows.    We buried the poor little body beneath a piece of luxuriant turf, and  stole back into Cruces like guilty things. But the knowledge I had  obtained thus strangely was very valuable to me, and was soon put into  practice. But that I dreaded boring my readers, I would fain give them  some idea of my treatment of this terrible disease. I have no doubt  that at first I made some lamentable blunders, and, may be, lost  patients which a little later I could have saved. I know I came  across, the other day, some notes of cholera medicines which made me  shudder, and I dare say they have been used in their turn and found  wanting. The simplest remedies were perhaps the best. Mustard  plasters, and emetics, and calomel; the mercury applied externally,  where the veins were nearest the surface, were my usual resources.  Opium I rather dreaded, as its effect is to incapacitate the system  from making any exertion, and it lulls the patient into a sleep which  is often the sleep of death. When my patients felt thirsty, I would  give them water in which cinnamon had been boiled. One stubborn attack  succumbed to an additional dose of ten grains of sugar of lead, mixed  in a pint of water, given in doses of a table-spoonful every quarter  of an hour. Another patient, a girl, I rubbed over with warm oil,  camphor, and spirits of wine. Above all, I never neglected to apply  mustard poultices to the stomach, spine, and neck, and particularly to  keep my patient warm about the region of the heart. Nor did I relax my  care when the disease had passed by, for danger did not cease when the  great foe was beaten off. The patient was left prostrate;  strengthening medicines had to be given cautiously, for fever, often  of the brain, would follow. But, after all, one great conclusion,  which my practice in cholera cases enabled me to come to, was the old  one, that few constitutions permitted the use of exactly similar  remedies, and that the course of treatment which saved one man, would,  if persisted in, have very likely killed his brother.    Generally speaking, the cholera showed premonitory symptoms; such as  giddiness, sickness, diarrhoea, or sunken eyes and distressed look;  but sometimes the substance followed its forecoming shadow so quickly,  and the crisis was so rapid, that there was no time to apply any  remedies. An American carpenter complained of giddiness and  sickness--warning signs--succeeded so quickly by the worst symptoms of  cholera, that in less than an hour his face became of an indigo tint,  his limbs were doubled up horribly with violent cramps, and he died.    To the convicts--and if there could be grades of wretchedness in  Cruces, these poor creatures were the lowest--belonged the terrible  task of burying the dead; a duty to which they showed the utmost  repugnance.

But he is at the same  time incomparably the coarsest.    The real quality of such a writer, it is evidently out of the question  to exhibit at all adequately here. But equally out of the question it is  to omit Rabelais altogether from an account of French literature.    Of the life of Francois Rabelais the man, these few facts will be  sufficient to know. In early youth he joined the monastic order of the  Franciscans. That order hated letters; but Rabelais loved them. He, in  fact, conceived a voracious ambition of knowledge. He became immensely  learned. This fact, with what it implies of long labor patiently  achieved, is enough to show that Rabelais was not without seriousness of  character. But he was much more a merry-andrew than a pattern monk. He  made interest enough with influential friends to get himself transferred  from the Franciscans to the Benedictines, an order more favorable to  studious pursuits. But neither among the Benedictines was this  roistering spirit at ease. He left them irregularly, but managed to  escape punishment for his irregularity. At last, after various  vicissitudes of occupation, he settled down as curate of Meudon, where  (the place, however, is doubtful, as also the date) in 1553 he died. He  was past fifty years of age before he finished the work which has made  him famous.    This work is \"The Life of Gargantua and Pantagruel,\" a grotesque and  nondescript production, founded, probably, on some prior romance or  traditionary tale of giants. The narrative of Rabelais is a tissue of  adventures shocking every idea of verisimilitude, and serving only as a  vehicle for the strange humor of the writer. The work is replete with  evidences of Rabelais's learning. It would be useless to attempt giving  any abstract or analysis of a book which is simply a wild chaos of  material jumbled together with little regard to logic, order, or method  of whatever sort. We shall better represent its character by giving a  few specimen extracts.    Rabelais begins his romance characteristically. According as you  understand him here, you judge the spirit of the whole work. Either he  now gives you a clew by which, amid the mazes of apparent sheer  frivolity on his part, you may follow till you win your way to some  veiled serious meaning that he had all the time, but never dared frankly  to avow; or else he is playfully misleading you on a false scent, which,  however long held to, will bring you out nowhere--in short, is quizzing  you. Let the reader judge for himself. Here is the opening passage,--the  \"Author's Prologue,\" it is called in the English translation executed by  Sir Thomas Urquhart and Motteux; a version, by the way, which, with  whatever faults of too much freedom, is the work of minds and  consciences singularly sympathetic with the genius of the original; the  English student is perhaps hardly at all at disadvantage, in comparison  with the French, for the full appreciation of Rabelais:--         Most noble and illustrious drinkers, and you thrice precious       pockified blades (for to you, and none else, do I dedicate my       writings), Alcibiades, in that dialogue of Plato's which is       entitled, \"The Banquet,\" whilst he was setting forth the praises of       his schoolmaster Socrates (without all question the prince of       philosophers), amongst other discourses to that purpose said that       he resembled the Sileni. Sileni of old were little boxes, like       those we now may see in the shops of apothecaries, painted on the       outside with wanton toyish figures, as harpies, satyrs, bridled       geese, horned hares, saddled ducks, flying goats, thiller harts,       and other such counterfeited pictures, at pleasure, to excite       people unto laughter, as Silenus himself, who was the foster-father       of good Bacchus, was wont to do; but within those capricious       caskets called Sileni, were carefully preserved and kept many rich       and fine drugs, such as balm, ambergreese, amomon, musk, civet,       with several kinds of precious stones, and other things of great       price. Just such another thing was Socrates; for to have eyed his       outside, and esteemed of him by his exterior appearance, you would       not have given the peel of an onion for him, so deformed he was in       body, and ridiculous in his gesture.... Opening this box, you would       have found within it a heavenly and inestimable drug, a more than       human understanding, an admirable virtue, matchless learning,       invincible courage, inimitable sobriety, certain contentment of       mind, perfect assurance, and an incredible disregard of all that       for which men commonly do so much watch, run, sail, fight, travel,       toil, and turmoil themselves.         Whereunto (in your opinion) doth this little flourish of a preamble       tend? For so much as you, my good disciples, and some other jolly       fools of ease and leisure,... are too ready to judge, that there is       nothing in them but jests, mockeries, lascivious discourse, and       recreative lies;... therefore is it, that you must open the book,       and seriously consider of the matter treated in it. Then shall you       find that it containeth things of far higher value than the box did       promise; that is to say, that the subject thereof is not so       foolish, as by the title at the first sight it would appear to be.         ...Did you ever see a dog with a marrow-bone in his mouth?... Like       him, you must, by a sedulous lecture [reading], and frequent       meditation, break the bone, and suck out the marrow; that is, my       allegorical sense, or the things I to myself propose to be       signified by these Pythagorical symbols;... the most glorious       doctrines and dreadful mysteries, as well in what concerneth our       religion, as matters of the public state and life economical.    Up to this point, the candid reader has probably been conscious of a  growing persuasion that this author must be at bottom a serious if also  a humorous man,--a man, therefore, excusably intent not to be  misunderstood as a mere buffoon. But now let the candid reader proceed  with the following, and confess, upon his honor, if he is not  scandalized and perplexed. What shall be said of a writer who thus plays  with his reader?         Do you believe, upon your conscience, that Homer, whilst he was       couching his Iliad and Odyssey, had any thought upon those       allegories which Plutarch, Heraclides Ponticus, Eustathius,       Phornutus, squeezed out of him, and which Politian filched again       from them? If you trust it, with neither hand nor foot do you come       near to my opinion, which judgeth them to have been as little       dreamed of by Homer, as the gospel sacraments were by Ovid, in his       Metamorphoses; though a certain gulligut friar, and true       bacon-picker, would have undertaken to prove it, if, perhaps, he       had met with as very fools as himself, and, as the proverb says, \"a       lid worthy of such a kettle.\"         If you give any credit thereto, why do not you the same to these       jovial new Chronicles of mine? Albeit, when I did dictate them, I       thought thereof no more than you, who possibly were drinking the       whilst, as I was. For, in the composing of this lordly book, I       never lost nor bestowed any more, nor any other time, than what was       appointed to serve me for taking of my bodily refection; that is,       whilst I was eating and drinking. And, indeed, that is the fittest       and most proper hour, wherein to write these high matters and deep       sentences; as Homer knew very well, the paragon of all philologues,       and Ennius, the father of the Latin poets, as Horace calls him,       although a certain sneaking jobbernol alleged that his verses       smelled more of the wine than oil.    Does this writer quiz his reader, or, in good faith, give him a needed  hint? Who shall decide?    We have let our first extract thus run on to some length, both for the  reason that the passage is as representative as any we could properly  offer of the quality of Rabelais, and also for the reason that the key  of interpretation is here placed in the hand of the reader, for  unlocking the enigma of this remarkable book. The extraordinary  horse-play of pleasantry, which makes Rabelais unreadable for the  general public of to-day, begins so promptly, affecting the very  prologue, that we could not present even that piece of writing entire in  our extract. We are informed that the circulation in England of the  works of Rabelais, in translation, has been interfered with by the  English government, on the ground of their indecency. We are bound to  admit, that, if any writings whatever were to be suppressed on that  ground, the writings of Rabelais are certainly entitled to be of the  number. It is safe to say that never, no, not even in the boundless  license of the comedy of Aristophanes, was more flagrant indecency, and  indecency proportionately more redundant in volume, perpetrated in  literature, than was done by Rabelais. Indecency, however, it is, rather  than strict lasciviousness. Rabelais sinned against manners, more than  he sinned against morals. But his obscenity is an ocean, without bottom  or shore. Literally, he sticks at nothing that is coarse. Nay, this is  absurdly short of expressing the fact. The genius of Rabelais teems with  invention of coarseness, beyond what any one could conceive as possible,  who had not taken his measure of possibility from Rabelais himself. And  his diction was as opulent as his invention.    Such is the character of Rabelais the author. What, then, was it, if not  fondness for paradox, that could prompt Coleridge to say, \"I could write  a treatise in praise of the moral elevation of Rabelais' works, which  would make the church stare and the conventicle groan,"]]]
