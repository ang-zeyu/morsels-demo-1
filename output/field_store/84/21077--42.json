Philip did not know what nation most of the dresses belonged  to--to him it was a brilliant patchwork of gold and gay colours. It  reminded him of the fancy-dress party he had once been to with Helen,  when he wore a Pierrot's dress and felt very silly in it. He noticed  that not a single boy in all that crowd was dressed as he was--in what  he thought was the only correct dress for boys. Lucy walked beside him.  Once, just after they started, she said, 'Aren't you frightened,  Philip?' and he would not answer, though he longed to say, 'Of course  not. It's only girls who are afraid.' But he thought it would be more  disagreeable to say nothing, so he said it.    When they got to the Hall of Justice, she caught hold of his hand, and  said:    'Oh!' very loud and sudden, 'doesn't it remind you of anything?' she  asked.    Philip pulled his hand away and said 'No' before he remembered that he  had decided not to speak to her. And the 'No' was quite untrue, for the  building did remind him of something, though he couldn't have told you  what.    The prisoners and their guard passed through a great arch between  magnificent silver pillars, and along a vast corridor, lined with  soldiers who all saluted.    'Do all sorts of soldiers salute you?' he asked the captain, 'or only  just your own ones?'    'It's _you_ they're saluting,' the captain said; 'our laws tell us to  salute all prisoners out of respect for their misfortunes.'    The judge sat on a high bronze throne with colossal bronze dragons on  each side of it, and wide shallow steps of ivory, black and white.    Two attendants spread a round mat on the top of the steps in front of  the judge--a yellow mat it was, and very thick, and he stood up and  saluted the prisoners. ('Because of your misfortunes,' the captain  whispered.)    The judge wore a bright yellow robe with a green girdle, and he had no  wig, but a very odd-shaped hat, which he kept on all the time.    The trial did not last long, and the captain said very little, and the  judge still less, while the prisoners were not allowed to speak at all.  The judge looked up something in a book, and consulted in a low voice  with the crown lawyer and a sour-faced person in black. Then he put on  his spectacles and said:    'Prisoners at the bar, you are found guilty of trespass. The punishment  is Death--if the judge does not like the prisoners. If he does not  dislike them it is imprisonment for life, or until the judge has had  time to think it over. Remove the prisoners.'    'Oh, _don't_!' cried Philip, almost weeping.    'I thought you weren't afraid,' whispered Lucy.    'Silence in court,' said the judge.    Then Philip and Lucy were removed.    They were marched by streets quite different from those they had come  by, and at last in the corner of a square they came to a large house  that was quite black.    'Here we are,' said the captain kindly. 'Good-bye. Better luck next  time.'    The gaoler, a gentleman in black velvet, with a ruff and a pointed  beard, came out and welcomed them cordially.    'How do you do, my dears?' he said. 'I hope you'll be comfortable here.  First-class misdemeanants, I suppose?' he asked.    'Of course,' said the captain.    'Top floor, if you please,' said the gaoler politely, and stood back to  let the children pass. 'Turn to the left and up the stairs.'    [Illustration: 'Top floor, if you please,' said the gaoler politely.]    The stairs were dark and went on and on, and round and round, and up and  up. At the very top was a big room, simply furnished with a table,  chairs, and a rocking-horse. Who wants more furniture than that?    'You've got the best view in the whole city,' said the gaoler, 'and  you'll be company for me. What? They gave me the post of gaoler because  it's nice, light, gentlemanly work, and leaves me time for my writing.  I'm a literary man, you know. But I've sometimes found it a trifle  lonely. You're the first prisoners I've ever had, you see. If you'll  excuse me I'll go and order some dinner for you. You'll be contented  with the feast of reason and the flow of soul, I feel certain.'    The moment the door had closed on the gaoler's black back Philip turned  on Lucy.    'I hope you're satisfied,' he said bitterly. 'This is all _your_ doing.  They'd have let me off if you hadn't been here. What on earth did you  want to come here for? Why did you come running after me like that?  You know I don't like you?'    'You're the hatefullest, disagreeablest, horridest boy in all the  world,' said Lucy firmly--'there!'    Philip had not expected this. He met it as well as he could.    'I'm not a little sneak of a white mouse squeezing in where I'm not  wanted, anyhow,' he said.    And then they stood looking at each other, breathing quickly, both of  them.    'I'd rather be a white mouse than a cruel bully,' said Lucy at last.    'I'm not a bully,' said Philip.    Then there was another silence. Lucy sniffed. Philip looked round the  bare room, and suddenly it came to him that he and Lucy were companions  in misfortune, no matter whose fault it was that they were imprisoned.  So he said:    'Look here, I don't like you and I shan't pretend I do. But I'll call it  Pax for the present if you like. We've got to escape from this place  somehow, and I'll help you if you like, and you may help me if you can.'    'Thank you,' said Lucy, in a tone which might have meant anything.    'So we'll call it Pax and see if we can escape by the window. There  might be ivy--or a faithful page with a rope ladder. Have you a page at  the Grange?'    'There's two stable-boys,' said Lucy, 'but I don't think they're  faithful, and I say, I think all this is much more magic than you  think.'    'Of course I know it's magic,' said he impatiently; 'but it's quite real  too.'    'Oh, it's real enough,' said she.    They leaned out of the window. Alas, there was no ivy. Their window was  very high up, and the wall outside, when they touched it with their  hand, felt smooth as glass.    '_That's_ no go,' said he, and the two leaned still farther out of the  window looking down on the town. There were strong towers and fine  minarets and palaces, the palm trees and fountains and gardens. A white  building across the square looked strangely familiar. Could it be like  St. Paul's which Philip had been taken to see when he was very little,  and which he had never been able to remember? No, he could not remember  it even now. The two prisoners looked out in a long silence. Far below  lay the city, its trees softly waving in the breeze, flowers shining in  a bright many-coloured patchwork, the canals that intersected the big  squares gleamed in the sunlight, and crossing and recrossing the  squares and streets were the people of the town, coming and going about  their business.    'Look here!' said Lucy suddenly, 'do you mean to say you don't know?'    'Know what?' he asked impatiently.    'Where we are. What it is. Don't you?'    'No. No more do you.'    'Haven't you seen it all before?'    'No, of course I haven't. No more have you.'    'All right. I _have_ seen it before though,' said Lucy, 'and so have  you. But I shan't tell you what it is unless you'll be nice to me.' Her  tone was a little sad, but quite firm.    'I _am_ nice to you. I told you it was Pax,' said Philip. 'Tell me what  you think it is.'    'I don't mean that sort of grandish standoffish Pax, but real Pax. Oh,  don't be so horrid, Philip. I'm dying to tell you--but I won't if you go  on being like you are.'    '_I'm_ all right,' said Philip; 'out with it.'    'No. You've got to say it's Pax, and I will stand by you till we get out  of this, and I'll always act like a noble friend to you, and I'll try my  best to like you. Of course if you can't like me you can't, but you  ought to try. Say it after me, won't you?'    Her tone was so kind and persuading that he found himself saying after  her, 'I, Philip, agree to try and like you, Lucy, and to stand by you  till we're out of this, and always to act the part of a noble friend to  you. And it's real Pax. Shake hands.'    'Now then,' said he when they had shaken hands, and Lucy uttered these  words:    'Don't you see? It's your own city that we're in, your own city that you  built on the tables in the drawing-room? It's all got big by magic, so  that we could get in. Look,' she pointed out of the window, 'see that  great golden dome, that's one of the brass finger-bowls, and that white  building's my old model of St. Paul's. And there's Buckingham Palace  over there, with the carved squirrel on the top, and the chessmen, and  the blue and white china pepper-pots; and the building we're in is the  black Japanese cabinet.'    Philip looked and he saw that what she said was true. It _was_ his city.    'But I didn't build insides to my buildings,' said he; 'and when did  _you_ see what I built anyway?'    'The insides are part of the magic, I suppose,' Lucy said; 'and I saw  the cities you built when Auntie brought me home last night, after you'd  been sent to bed. And I did love them. And oh, Philip, I'm so glad it's  Pax because I do think you're so _frightfully_ clever, and Auntie  thought so too, building those beautiful things. And I knew nurse was  going to pull it all down. I begged her not to, but she was addymant,  and so I got up and dressed and came down to have another look by  moonlight. And one or two of the bricks and chessmen had fallen down. I  expect nurse knocked them down. So I built them up again as well as I  could--and I was loving it all like anything; and then the door opened  and I hid under the table, and you came in.'    'Then you were there--did you notice how the magic began?'    'No, but it all changed to grass; and then I saw you a long way off,  going up a ladder. And so I went after you. But I didn't let you see me.  I knew you'd be so cross.
