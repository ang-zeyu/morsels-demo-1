In this matter I have the  support of Mr. Shenstone's experience.    (6) A wire nail, about 2 inches long, mounted very accurately in a  thin cylindrical wooden handle about 5 inches long by one-quarter of  an inch diameter, or, better still, a bit of pinion wire 6 inches  long, of which 1.5 inches are turned down as far as the cylindrical  core, An old dentists' chisel or filling tool is also a very good  form of instrument.    (7) A bit of charcoal about 3.5 inches long and 2 wide, and of any  thickness, will be found very useful in helping to heat a very large  tube.  The charcoal block is provided with a stout wire handle, bent  in such a manner that the block can be held close above a large glass  tube on which the flames impinge.  In some cases it is conveniently  held by a clip stand.  By the use of such a slab of charcoal the  temperature obtainable over a large surface can be considerably  increased.    I have seen a wine-glass (Venetian sherry-glass) worked on a table  with four blow-pipes, such as is here described, with the help of a  block of hard wood held over the heated glass, and helping the  attainment of a high temperature by its own combustion.    (8) Several retort stands with screw clips.    (9) Some blocks of wood about 5\" X 2\" X 2\" with V-shaped notches cut  in from the top.    (10) A strong pair of pliers.    (11) An apparatus for cleaning and drying the breath, when blowing  directly by the mouth is not allowable.  The apparatus consists of a  solid and heavy block of wood supporting a calcium-chloride tube  permanently connected with a tube of phosphorus pentoxide divided into  compartments by plugs of glass wool.  Care should be taken to arrange  these tubes so as to occupy the smallest space, and to have the stand  particularly stable.  The exit tube from the phosphorus pentoxide  should be drawn down to form a nozzle, from, say, half an inch to  one-eighth of an inch in diameter, so as to easily fit almost any bit  of rubber tube.  The entry to the calcium chloride should be  permanently fitted to about a yard of fine soft rubber tubing, as  light as possible.  The ends of this tube should terminate in a glass  mouthpiece, which should not be too delicate.    As an additional precaution against dust, I sometimes add a tube  containing a long plug of glass wool, between the phosphorus pentoxide  and the delivery tube, and also a tube containing stick potash on the  entry side of the calcium chloride tube, but it may safely be left to  individual judgment to determine when these additions require to be  made.  In practice I always keep the affair set up with these  additions.  The communication between all the parts should be  perfectly free, and the tubes should be nearly filled with reagents,  so as to avoid having a large volume of air to compress before a  pressure can be got up.    The arrangement will be clear by a reference to Fig.  8, which  illustrates the apparatus in use for joining two long tubes.  I have  tried blowing-bags, etc, but, on the whole, prefer the above  arrangement, for, after a time, the skill one acquires in regulating  the pressure by blowing by the mouth and lips is such an advantage  that it is not to be lightly foregone.    Fig. 8.    Sec. 18.  The Table.    The system of four blow-pipes is, of course, a fixture.  In this case  the table may be about a yard square, and may be covered with asbestos  mill-board neatly laid down, but this is not essential.  The table  should have a rim running round it about a quarter of an inch high.  The tools should be laid to the right of the worker, and for this  purpose the blow-pipes are conveniently fixed rather to the left of  the centre of the table, but not so far as to make the leg of the  table come so close to the operator as to make him uncomfortable, for  a cheerful and contented spirit ought to be part of the glass-worker's  outfit.    The most convenient height for a blow-pipe table--with the blow-pipes  about 2 inches above the table top--is 3 feet 2 inches.  Nothing is  so convenient to sit upon as a rough music-stool with a good range of  adjustment.  The advantage of an adjustable seat lies in the fact that  for some operations one wants to be well over the work, while in  others the advantage of resting the arms against the table is more  important.    Sec. 19.  Special Operations.    The preliminary to most operations before the blow-pipe, is to draw  down a tube and pull it out to a fine point.  This is also the  operation on which a beginner should exercise himself in the first  instance.  I will suppose that it is desired to draw out a tube about  one-quarter of an inch in diameter, with the object of closing it,  either permanently or temporarily, and leaving a handle for future  operations in the shape of the point, thin enough to cool quickly and  so not delay further work.    For this simple operation most of the glass-blower's skill is  required.  The tube must be grasped between the first finger and thumb  of both hands, and held so that the part to be operated on lies evenly  between the two hands.  The distance between the operator's thumbs may  conveniently vary from 2.5 to 4 inches.  Releasing the grip of the  left hand, let the operator assure himself of his ability to easily  rotate the tube about its axis--by the right thumb and finger--he  will incidentally observe by the \"feel\" whether the tube is straight  or not.    A good deal of progress can be made from this point before the tube is  heated at all.  The operator can acquire a habit of instinctively  rotating the tube by both hands, however the tube itself be moved  about in space, or however it be pushed or pulled.  The habit of  constant and instinctive rotation is literally about one-third of the  whole art of glassblowing.  It is unlikely, however, that the beginner  will discover that he has not got this habit, until a few failures  draw his attention to it.    The glass tube being held in position lightly yet firmly, and the  operator being sure that he feels comfortable and at his ease, and  that the blow-pipe flame (a single flame in this instance) is well  under control, the preliminary heating may be commenced.  With a tube  of the dimensions given this is a very simple affair.  Turn the air  partly off, or blow gently, to get a partly luminous gas flame; hold  the tube about an inch from the end of this flame, and turn it round  and round till it commences to soften.    In the case of soda glass it is usual to employ the gas flame only,  but I find that it is better in most cases to use the hot air of a  gently-blown flame, rather than have the disadvantage of the soot  deposited in the alternative operation.  When the glass begins to  soften, or even before, it may be moved right into the blow-pipe  flame, and the latter may be properly urged.    It is not possible to give quite explicit and definite instructions,  applicable to every case, as to when the time is ripe for passing the  work into the flame, but the following notes will indicate the general  rules to be observed:-    (1) A thick tube must be warmed more slowly and raised to a higher  temperature than a thin tube.    (2) The same remark applies to a tube of large diameter, as compared  with one of small diameter, whatever the thickness.    (3) In the case of very large or thick tubes the hot air is  advantageously employed at first, and to complete the preliminary  heating, the luminous flame alone may be used.  The object of this is  to enable the operator to judge, by the presence of soot, its  inability to deposit--or its burning off if deposited--of the  temperature of the glass, and of the equality of this temperature all  over the surface, for a large and thick tube might be heated quite  enough to enable it to be safely exposed to the full heat before it is  appreciably yielding to the fingers.  In general, when the soot burns  off freely, or lead glass begins to show the faintest sign of  reduction, or soda glass begins to colour the flame, it is more than  safe to proceed.    In order to turn on the full flame the operator will form a habit of  holding the work in the left hand only, and he will also take care not  to let anything his right hand may be doing cause him to stop rotating  the tube with his left thumb and finger.    The preliminary adjustment of air or oxygen supply will enable the  change to a flame of maximum power to be made very quickly.  The tube  having been introduced with constant rotation, it will soon soften  sufficiently to be worked.  The beginner will find it best to decide  the convenient degree of softness by trial.    With soda glass it does not much matter how soft the glass becomes,  for it remains viscous, but with lead glass the viscosity persists for  a longer time and then suddenly gives place to a much greater degree  of fluidity.  [Footnote: This is only drawn from my impressions  acquired in glass-working.  I have never explicitly tested the matter  experimentally.]    It is just at this point that a beginner will probably meet with his  first difficulty.  As soon as the glass gets soft he will find that he  no longer rotates the glass at the same speed by the right and left  hand, and, moreover, he will probably unconsciously bend the tube, and  even deform it, by pushing or pulling.    The second third of the art of the glass-blower consists in being able  to move both hands about, rotating a tube with each thumb and finger,  and keeping the distance between the hands, and also the speed of  rotation, constant.  Nothing but long practice can give this facility,  but it is essential that it be acquired to some extent, or no progress  can be made.  Some people acquire a moderate proficiency very quickly,  others, of whom the writer is one, only become reasonably proficient  by months, or even"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22790"],[0,"The accomplisht cook (#6)"],[1,"of the dish, make marrow pies made like round  Chewets but not so high altogether, then have sweet-breads of veal  cut like small dice, some pistaches, and Marrow, some Potato's, or  Artichocks cut like Sweetbreads: as also some enterlarded Bacon;  Yolks of hard Eggs, Nutmeg, Salt, Goosberries, Grapes, or  Barberries, and some minced Veal in the bottom of the Pie minced  with some Bacon or Beef-suit, Sparagus and Chesnuts, with a little  musk; close them up, and bast them with saffron water, bake them,  and liquor it with beaten butter, and set them about the dish side  or brims, with some bottoms of Artichocks, and yolks of hard Eggs,  Lemons in quarters, Poungarnets and red Beets boil'd, and carved.        _Other Marrow Pies._    Otherways for variety, you may make other Marrow Pies of minced Veal  and Beef-suit, seasoned with Pepper, Salt, Nutmegs and boiled  Sparagus, cut half an inch long, yolks of hard Eggs cut in quarters,  and mingled with the meat and marrow: fill your Pies, bake them not  too hard, musk them, _&c._        _Other Marrow Pies._    Otherways, Marrow Pies of bottoms of little Artichocks, Suckers,  yolks of hard eggs, Chesnuts, Marrow, and interlarded Bacon cut like  dice, some Veal sweet-breads cut also, or Lamb-stones, Potato's, or  Skirrets, and Sparagus, or none; season them lightly with Nutmeg,  Pepper and Salt, close your Pies, and bake them.        __Olio_, Marrow Pies._      _Butter three pound, Flower one quart, Lamb-Stones three pair,    Sweet-Breads six, Marrow-bones eight, large Mace, Cock-stones    twenty, interlarded Bacon one pound, knots of Eggs twelve,    Artichocks twelve, Sparagus one hundred, Cocks-Combs twenty,    Pistaches one pound, Nutmegs, Pepper, and Salt._    Season the aforesaid lightly, and lay them in the Pie upon some  minced veal or mutton, your interlarded Bacon in thin slices of half  an inch long, mingled among the rest, fill the Pie, and put in some  Grapes, and slic't Lemon, Barberries or Goosberries.      1.

Then have all manner of sweet herbs, as Parsley, Time, Savory,  Marjorim, Sorrel, Sage; these being finely picked, bruise them with  the back of a ladle, and a little before you dish up your boil'd  meat, put them to your broth, and give them a walm or two.    Again, for the top of your boil'd meat or garnish, have a pound of  interlarded Bacon in thin slices, put them in a pipkin with six  marrow-bones, and twelve bottoms of yong Artichocks, and some six  sweet-breads of veal, strong broth, Mace, Nutmeg, some Goosberries  or Barberries, some Butter and Pistaches.    These things aforesaid being ready, and dinner called for, take a  fine clean scoured dish and garnish it with Pistaches and  Artichocks, carved Lemon, Grapes, and large Mace.    Then have sippets finely carved, and some slices of _French_ bread  in the bottom of the dish, dish three pieces of Mutton, and one in  the middle, and between the mutton three Chickens, and up in the  middle, the Partridge, and pour on the broth with your herbs, then  put on your pipkin over all, of Marrow, Artichocks, and the other  materials, then Carved Lemon, Barberries and beaten Butter over all,  your carved sippets round the dish.        _Another made Dish in the French Fashion, called an      _Entre de Table_, Entrance to the Table._    Take the bottoms of boil'd Artichocks, the yolks of hard Eggs, yong  Chicken-peepers, or Pidgeon-peepers, finely trust, Sweetbreads of  Veal, Lamb-stones, blanched, and put them in a Pipkin, with  Cockstones, and combs, and knots of Eggs; then put to them some  strong broth, white-wine, large Mace, Nutmeg, Pepper, Butter, Salt,  and Marrow, and stew them softly together.
