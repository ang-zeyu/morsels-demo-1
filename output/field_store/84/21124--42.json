The _dooty_ of the place refused to give him or  his companions food, so he lay down supperless to sleep.  Their host,  however, relented, and about midnight he was awakened with the joyful  information that victuals were prepared.    Next day his fellow-travellers, having better horses, went on ahead, and  he was walking barefoot, driving his own poor animal before him, when he  met a coffle, or caravan, of about seventy slaves coming from Sego.  They were tied together by their necks with thongs of bullock's hide  twisted like a rope, seven slaves upon a thong, and a man with a musket  between every seven.  They were bound for Morocco.    On arriving at the next place he found that his companions had gone on  without him, but he fell in, the following day, with two negroes going  to Sego, who afforded him their company.    In the village through which he passed he was constantly taken for a  Moor.  The people jeered at him, laughing at his tattered and forlorn  appearance.  He, however, again overtook the Kaartans, who promised to  introduce him to the king.    As they were riding along over some marshy ground, and he was anxiously  looking around for the river which he now supposed to be near, one of  his companions called out, \"_Geo affilli_!\"  (\"See water!\") and, looking  forward, he saw with infinite pleasure the great object of his mission--  the long-sought-for majestic Niger, glittering in the morning sun, as  broad as the Thames at Westminster, and flowing slowly to the east.  He  hastened to the brink, and having drunk of the water, offered up his  fervent thanks in prayer to the Great Ruler of all things for having  thus far crowned his endeavours with success.    Sego, the capital of Bambarra--at which he had now arrived--consists,  properly speaking, of four distinct towns: two on the north and two on  the south bank of the Niger.  They are surrounded by high mud walls.  The houses are built of clay, of a square form with flat roofs--some of  them of two stories, and many of them are whitewashed.  Moorish mosques  are seen in every quarter; and the streets, though narrow, are broad  enough for every useful purpose in a country where wheel-carriages are  unknown.  It contains about thirty thousand inhabitants.    While waiting to cross the river, a messenger arrived, informing him  that the king could not possibly see him until he knew what had brought  him into the country, and that he must not venture to cross the river  without his majesty's permission.  He was directed to pass the night in  a distant village; but when he reached it, no one would admit him.  He  was regarded with astonishment and fear, and was obliged to sit all day  without food in the shade of a tree.  He fully expected to have to pass  the night in the same place; but about sunset, after he had turned his  horse loose, a woman, perceiving that he was weary and dejected,  enquired into his situation.  Casting looks of pity upon him, she took  up his saddle and bridle, and told him to follow her.  Having conducted  him into her hut, she lighted her lamp, spread a mat on the floor and  signified that he might remain there for the night.  Finding that he was  very hungry, she brought him a fine fish for supper.  Having thus  attended to the stranger, telling him that he might sleep in safety she  called her women around her and desired them to resume their task of  spinning cotton, in which they continued to employ themselves the  greater part of the night, lightening their labours by songs, some of  which had reference to their white visitor.    Several days passed, when a messenger arrived from Mansong with a bag in  his hands.  He told Park that it was his Majesty's pleasure he should  forthwith depart from the neighbourhood of Sego, but that the king,  wishing to relieve a white man in distress, had sent him five thousand  cowries.  From the conversation Park had with the guide, he ascertained  that Mansong would willingly have seen him, but that he was apprehensive  of being unable to protect him against the blind and inveterate malice  of the Moorish inhabitants.  His conduct, therefore, was at once prudent  and liberal.    He was the same evening conducted to a village about seven miles to the  eastward, where he was well received.  His guide told him that if Jenne  was really the place of his destination, the journey was one of greater  danger than he might suppose; for, although that town was nominally a  part of the King of Bambarra's dominions, it was in fact a city of the  Moors--the chief part of the inhabitants being Bushreens, a fanatical  Mahommedan sect.  He heard, too, that Timbuctoo, the great object of his  search, was entirely in possession of that savage and merciless people,  who allow no Christian to live there.  He had, however, advanced too far  to think of returning with uncertain information, and he determined to  proceed.    Being provided with a guide, he left the village on the morning of the  24th, travelling through a highly cultivated country, the scenery  bearing a greater resemblance to that of England than he had expected to  find in the middle of Africa.    The people were everywhere employed in collecting the fruit of the shea  trees, from which they prepared vegetable butter.  In the evening he  reached the large town of Sansanding, the resort of numerous Moorish  caravans from the shores of the Mediterranean.  In the harbour he  observed twenty large canoes, and others arrived while he was there.  He  was received into the house of the _dooty_, Counti Mamadi.  Scarcely had  he arrived when hundreds of people surrounded him, all speaking  different dialects, several of them declaring that they had seen him in  various parts of the continent.  It was evident that they mistook him  for somebody else.  One of them, a _shereef_, from Suat, declared that  if he refused to go to the mosque he would carry him there.  He had  little doubt that the Moor would have put his threat into execution had  not his host interposed in his behalf.  The latter said that, if he  would let his guest alone for the night, in the morning he should be  sent about his business.  This somewhat appeased them, but even after he  had retired to his hut the people climbed over the pailings to look at  him.    At midnight, when the Moors had retired, Mamadi paid him a visit and  earnestly desired him to write a _saphie_, or charm, observing, \"If a  Moor's _saphie_ is good, a white man's must needs be better.\"  Park  readily furnished him with one, which was in reality the Lord's Prayer,  a reed serving for a pen, charcoal and gum-water for ink and a thin  board for paper.    Allowed to proceed, as he and his guide were crossing an open plain with  a few scattered bushes, the guide wheeled his horse round, called loudly  to him and, warning him that a lion was at hand, made signs that he  should ride away.  His horse was too much fatigued to do this, so they  rode slowly past the bush, and he, not seeing anything himself, thought  the guide had been mistaken.  Suddenly the Foulah put his hand to his  mouth exclaiming, \"God preserve us!\"  To his great surprise he then  perceived a large red lion a short distance from the bush, his head  couched between his fore paws.  Park expected that the creature would  instantly spring upon him, and instinctively pulled his foot from the  stirrups to throw himself on the ground, that his horse might become the  victim rather than himself; but probably the lion was not hungry, for he  quietly allowed the traveller to pass though fairly within his reach.    The next day his horse completely broke down, and the united strength of  himself and his guide could not place the animal again upon his legs.  He sat down for some time beside the worn-out associate of his  adventures; but, finding him still unable to rise, he took off the  saddle and bridle and placed a quantity of grass before him.  While he  surveyed his poor steed as he lay panting on the ground, he could not  suppress the sad apprehension that he should himself in a short time lie  down and perish in the same manner from fatigue and hunger.  With this  foreboding he left his horse, and with great reluctance followed his  guide on foot along the banks of the river until he reached the small  village of Kea.    Here he parted from his Foulah guide, whom he requested to look after  his horse on his return, which he promised to do.    From Kea he went down the river in a canoe, and thence to Moorzan, a  fishing town on the northern bank, and was then conveyed across the  stream to Silla, a large town.  Here, after much entreaty, the _dooty_  allowed him to enter his house to avoid the rain, but the place was damp  and he had a smart attack of fever.  Worn down by sickness, exhausted  with hunger, and fatigued, half-naked, without any article of value by  which he could procure provisions, clothes, or lodgings, he began to  reflect seriously on his situation, and was convinced by painful  experience that the obstacles to his further progress were  insurmountable.  The _dooty_ approved of the resolution he had arrived  at of returning, and procured a fisherman to carry him across to  Moorzan, whence he got back to Kea.  The brother of the _dooty_ was  starting for Modiboo.  He took his saddle, which he had left at Kea,  intending to present it to the king of Bambarra.    Travelling along the banks of the river, the footprints of a lion quite  fresh in the mud were seen.  His companion, therefore, proceeded with  great circumspection, insisting that Park should walk before him.  This  he declined doing, when his guide threw down the saddle and left him  alone.  He therefore continued his course along the bank, and believing  that the lion was at no great distance, he became much alarmed, and took  a long"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21400"],[0,"Style in Singing (#6)"],[1,"between  sacrificing the words or the music. The former alternative is  generally preferable, the musical phrase in many such cases being of  the greater relative importance. Another way is, to meet the  difficulty boldly by supplying another text which mates itself more  happily with the musical phrase. Personally, I adopt the latter  alternative without hesitation, when preparing artists to sing these  works.           *       *       *       *       *    Some minor effects utilized in Style in singing may be briefly alluded  to: _Portamento_; variations of _Tempo_.      PORTAMENTO    This is effected by the voice gliding from one tone to another, and is  equally available on stringed instruments, the violin or 'cello, the  mandoline or zither. It is a grace of style much abused by inartistic  singers. Being an ornament, good taste dictates that it be used  sparingly. A frequent sliding from one tone to another is a grave  fault, and most disagreeable to a cultivated ear. To sing _legato_ is  one thing; to sing _strisciato_ is another. Hence, its use on two  consecutive occasions is rarely admissible. But without a sober and  discreet use of the _portamento_, the style of the singer appears  stiff, angular--lacking, as it were, in graceful curves.    It must always be performed by carrying the tone and syllable to the  next tone; never by anticipating the latter:    [Music: Mozart (Nozze di Figaro)    Do Fa Deh vieni, non tardar,]    But it sometimes happens that, while desiring this grace, the composer  does not indicate his wish quite correctly. Here is an instance by F.  Thome:    [Music: Et nous dansions un bolero.]    Were it performed as printed, it would be very bad style, as it  violates the rule that the succeeding syllable shall not be  anticipated. Undoubtedly, what the author wished is the following:    [Music: Et nous dansions]    Sometimes the composer himself indicates clearly his intention that  this effect should be used, as in the following examples:    [Music: Reyer (La Statue)    Pour s'evanouir, au reveil.]    [Music: Celeste Aida    (Aida: Act I)    Verdi    Del mio pensiero tu sei regina, tu di mia vita sei lo splendor.]    [Music: Song \"Heure du Soir\" for Tenor    Leo Delibes    Partout s'eleve un chant bien doux, un chant bien doux,  Sous la brise toute embaumee.]    [Music: From \"La Boheme,\" Act I    Puccini    Mi chiamano Mimi, ma il mio nome e Lucia.]    (Notice the phrases marked _a_ and _b_.)    The words and indications for the use of the _portamento_ in each of  these last four examples are by the respective composers, and as  printed in the published editions.    A _portamento_ should never be sung so slowly as to convey the idea of  a badly executed chromatic scale; and, as a rule, it is best not to  use one between any lesser interval than a third, unless for some  particular effect, or at the close of a slow movement, as in the aria  \"He was despised,\" in _The Messiah_:    [Music: and acquainted with grief.]    It is also effective in connecting syllables in phrases of a smooth,  lyric character:    [Music: Nozze di Figaro: Act II    Mozart    (as printed)    in braccio al idol mio.    (should be sung)    in braccio al idol mio.]    The _portamento_ being an embellishment that pertains to the  _cantabile_, it is very little used in declamatory singing.    But frequently in the Recitatives of classic works occur phrases of  declamatory recitative, interspersed with passages that are purely  lyric in structure. To each of these divisions must be given its  appropriate style. For instance, after the opening phrases of  Obadiah's exhortation, \"Ye people, rend your hearts,\" in _Elijah_, up  to the end of the phrase \"Return to God,\" all is purely lyric  declamation. But at the words, \"For He is slow to anger, and  merciful,\" this should cease, and the succeeding phrases be given with  all the graces that are permissible in _cantabile_ singing; not in the  hard, dry manner affected by some of the modern tenors in oratorio.    [Music: I therefore say to ye, Forsake your idols, return to God; for  He is slow to anger, and merciful.]           *       *       *       *       *    VARIATIONS OF TEMPO    These are of value in bringing out the musical and poetic significance  of certain compositions; notably the operas of Bellini, Donizetti, and  the earlier works of Verdi. But I would caution singers to exercise  discretion in this much-abused effect. Variations of Tempo, the  _ritardando_, _accelerando_, and _tempo rubato_, are all legitimate  aids demanded by Expression. But unless their use is determined by  sound judgment and correct musicianly taste, the effect speedily  becomes vulgar and monotonous. Knowledge, and a taste formed in good  schools, must be the guide of the vocalist in the use of variations of  tempo.    I have said that the operas of Bellini, Donizetti and Verdi abound in  instances requiring the hastening or slackening of the tempo. But the  device is also highly esteemed by the ultra-modern Italian school, as  may be seen in studying the scores of Puccini, Mascagni and  Leoncavallo.    Here is an illustration of its effective use in the air \"Connais-tu le  pays?\" from _Mignon_ (Act II), by Ambroise Thomas. Madame Christine  Nilsson (Countess Casa Miranda), who \"passed\" the role with the  composer, always sang the phrase thus, although these indications do  not appear in the published version:    [Music: Helas! que ne puis-je te suivre, vers ce rivage heureux, d'ou  le sort m'exila!]    Again, in the fine song _Der Asra_, by Rubinstein, the musical, as  well as the dramatic, effect of the poem is heightened by the use of  the _accelerando_, which interprets with musical vividness the  impetuous avowal by the slave of his passion for the princess, after  his calm answer to her questions as to his name and birthplace.    \"_Ich heisse Mahomet, ich bin aus Yemen, und mein Stamm sind jene  Asra, welche sterben, wenn sie lieben._\" (HEINE.)    [Music: und mein Stamm sind jene Asra, welche sterben, wenn sie  lieben.]          CHAPTER IV    TRADITION      Tradition plays a more important part, perhaps, in the interpretation  of the classic composers' writings for the voice than it does in their  purely instrumental works. The old masters left few--sometimes not  any--indications as to the manner in which their music should be  rendered. Thus its proper performance is largely determined by  received oral tradition. The printed scores of the classics, except  those that have been specially edited, throw little light on their  proper interpretation, or even at times on the actual notes to be  sung. To perform exactly as written the operas of Gluck, notably  _Armide_ and _Orphee_, the operas of Mozart, the Italian operas and  English oratorios of Handel, the oratorios of Bach, Haydn, and  Mendelssohn, would be to do the greatest injustice to these composers  and their works.    It is a prevalent idea that all departures from the published text are  due either to caprice, or to vanity and a desire for personal display  on the part of the soloist. As though singers had a monopoly of these  defects!    Let us consider some of the principal causes of such changes in the  text, and the reasons why these modifications do not always appear in  the published versions.    In the original editions of many of the earlier operas, as those of  Mozart, etc., the unaccompanied recitative (_recitativo secco_) is  not barred. As with the plain-chant of the church, only the _pitch_ of  the tone is indicated. Its _length_ was left to the discretion of the  artist, who was supposed to be familiar with the accepted style of  delivery termed \"_recitativo parlante_.\" The example is from the  recitative \"Dove sono,\" in Act III of _Le Nozze di Figaro_, by Mozart:    [Music: E Susanna non vien! Sono ansiosa di saper]    This should be sung as below:    [Music: E Susanna non vien! Sono ansiosa di saper]    The substitution of another note for the one actually written, both in  Recitative and Aria, was also strictly regulated under the system or  convention then in vogue, one perfectly understood both by composer  and singer.    In all the earlier Italian operas, and in the English oratorios of  Handel, this system was followed:    [Music: Recit. \"Behold, a Virgin shall conceive\"    Messiah    Handel    (sung)    Emmanuel;    (printed)    and shall call his name Emmanuel;]    [Music: Aria. \"I know that my Redeemer liveth\"    Messiah    Handel    (sung)    liveth    (printed)    I know that my Redeemer liveth]    [Music: Recit. \"Non piu di fiori\"    La Clemenza di Tito    Mozart    (sung)    Vitellia! costanza    (printed)    Ecco il punto, o Vitellia! d'esaminar la tua costanza]    [Music: \"In questa tomba\"    Beethoven    (sung)    oscura    (printed)    In questa tomba oscura]    This substitution, therefore, of another note--a tone or semitone  higher or lower, according to the phrase--is not only legitimate but  essential in all music written in the Italian manner.    Another cause of changes being necessary in the vocal part of many of  the older classic writers, particularly of oratorio, is the frequently  faulty syllabic accentuation. I have already mentioned this defect in  the chapter on Accent. Handel, for instance, although living nearly  all his life in England, never became quite master of its language;  hence the numerous cases of the misplacing of syllables in his  oratorios. This defect is also noticeable, but not in the same degree,  in his Italian operas. The books of _Elijah_ and _St. Paul_  (Mendelssohn), and _The Creation_ (Haydn), were originally written in  German, and therefore suffer somewhat in this respect when the  translated English version is given. This fault is also noticeable in  the English versions of Bach's _Passion_ (St. Matthew), and  Mendelssohn's _Psalm CXIV_. In the first quoted of these two works, in  the response for Double Chorus to the question, \"Whe"]]]
