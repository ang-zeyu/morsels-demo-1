You boys certainly came in the nick of time.\"    \"And we are glad of it,\" declared Fred, and the others nodded in  approval.    The elderly man said that his name was Jed Kessler, and that he lived  on the outskirts of Haven Point. He knew very little about Colby  Hall, however, for previous to being employed by the Hasley Shell  Loading Company he had worked around the docks at Hixley, at one end  of the lake. So much the boys learned from him when they had rowed out  of the pall of smoke and the rain of fire and could breathe freely and  in comfort.    \"Have you any idea what started that fire?\" questioned Jack, when they  were headed for one of the docks at Haven Point.    \"I've got my idea, yes. But I don't know whether it's correct or not,\"  replied Jed Kessler. \"Of course, any kind of a slight accident in a  place like that might set things to going. But I know one thing, and  that is very important, I think.\"    \"What is that?\" questioned Randy.    \"The first explosion took place down the railroad track, in one of the  cars loaded with shells, while the second explosion, which came less  than half a minute later, occurred in one of the supply houses.\"    \"Was the supply house near the car where the first explosion  happened?\" queried Jack.    \"No. The two places are at least five hundred feet apart.\"    \"In that case, it isn't likely that the first explosion brought on  the second, is it?\" questioned Andy.    \"It didn't!\" was the prompt answer. \"Those two explosions had nothing  to do with each other--except in one way,--and that is that they were  both started by the same person or persons,\" declared Jed Kessler  emphatically.    \"Gee! do you suppose there were German spies around?\" ejaculated  Randy.    \"I am sure there were,\" went on the old dockman.    \"But I supposed your guards kept all strangers away from the plant,\"  said Jack.    \"They were supposed to. But you know how it is. Those fellows aren't  on the watch all the time. They get tired of their job, and sometimes  they take it easy. Besides that, it is rather easy to reach the plant  from the water front, and it is almost equally easy to come down  through the woods on the hill behind the place. Of course, we've got a  big wire fence up all around, but it doesn't take much to go through  that if a fellow has a good pair of wire cutters.\"    \"Did you ever see anybody suspicious?\"    \"Lots of times. But, of course, most of the people who looked  suspicious proved to be nothing but men who had an idle curiosity  regarding the plant. But I saw some fellows around there two weeks  ago and again a couple of days ago, and they looked mighty suspicious  to me. They were a couple of heavy-set looking fellows, with strong  German faces, and I heard 'em at a distance talking in a language that  I'm pretty sure was German.\"    \"Why didn't you report this to the guard?\"    \"I did. But they were a lot of fresh young fellows, and they only  laughed at me and said I was too suspicious,\" grumbled Jed Kessler.  \"But that is where I made a mistake. I should have gone right to the  offices and reported to the head boss.\"    \"Do you suppose you'd know those fellows again if you saw them?\"  questioned Jack.    \"I think I would--although I'm not sure. They were both fellows with  heavy black hair and heavy black beards, and one of them walked with  his right foot kind of turned out.\"    \"You certainly ought to report this as soon as possible,\" declared the  oldest Rover boy. \"It may furnish the authorities with an important  clue. If I were you, I would get into communication with one of your  bosses without delay.\"    Leaving the old man and his rowboat at the dock, the four Rovers rowed  up the lake once more in the direction of the Clearwater Hall  boathouse. By this time the explosions at the shell-loading plant had  practically ceased, and only a small amount of smoke was now coming  from the ruins.    When the Rovers arrived at the boathouse connected with the girls'  school, they found that Mary and Martha had come down to the place,  accompanied by a number of the other girls. All had heard that the  Rovers had taken the rowboat, and were wondering if the lads were  safe.    \"You've given us a terrible scare,\" declared Martha to her brother.  \"You shouldn't have taken such a risk!\"    \"Well, it was worth while,\" answered Fred, and then told of the rescue  of Jed Kessler.    \"Well, we've had a surprise since you went away,\" said Ruth Stevenson  presently.    \"A thoroughly disagreeable surprise, too,\" added May Powell. \"You'll  never guess who was here only a few minutes ago!\"    \"Some of our folks from New York?\" questioned Jack quickly.    \"No such luck,\" answered his sister.    \"They were two persons we didn't care to see,\" said Ruth. \"They were  Slugger Brown and Nappy Martell!\"          CHAPTER V    MEETING OLD ENEMIES      \"Slugger Brown and Nappy Martell!\" The cry came from all of the Rover  boys simultaneously.    \"What were those fellows doing here?\" continued Jack.    \"Did they dare to speak to you?\" demanded Fred.    \"Of course they spoke to us--you can't stop fellows like Brown and  Martell from doing that,\" answered Ruth. \"But you can be sure we gave  them both the cold shoulder.\"    \"What did they want here?\" questioned Jack.    \"I don't know what they wanted or where they came from,\" continued  Ruth. \"Their appearance gave us such a shock we didn't know what to do  at first.\"    \"We were on our way from the school to the boathouse, and were just  crossing the roadway when Slugger and Nappy came along in a runabout,\"  said May. \"The minute they saw us they stopped and jumped out. They  asked us a whole lot of questions about how we were getting along at  school and if your sisters were here.\"    \"Our sisters!\" cried Fred. \"What business have they got to ask about  Martha and Mary?\"    \"Of course we didn't answer their questions, and Martha and Mary had  gone on ahead, so Brown and Martell didn't see them,\" said Ruth. \"They  tried to act in a friendly manner, but we gave them to understand that  we wanted nothing to do with them. Then they jumped into the runabout  again and drove off.\"    \"Did they go toward Haven Point?\" questioned Randy.    \"Yes.\"    \"Those fellows certainly have their nerve with them--to show  themselves anywhere near Colby Hall after what happened!\" burst out  Andy.    \"One would think they wouldn't want any of their old classmates to see  them,\" remarked Fred.    \"They are not that kind,\" replied Jack. \"Both of them are too  thick-skinned to be sensitive. More than likely they have been telling  their friends that we did our best to get them into trouble and that  they were not to blame.\"    \"Oh, Jack! if you go back to Colby Hall by way of the town, I hope you  don't get into any trouble with those horrid fellows,\" said his  sister.    \"Don't worry about that, Martha,\" answered her brother quickly. \"I'm  not afraid of Slugger or Nappy either. They have got to behave  themselves; otherwise we may bring up one of the old charges against  them.\"    Of course the girls wanted to know more concerning what had happened  to the Rover boys while they were out on the lake, and they related  many of the particulars.    \"And do you really think those two Germans that that Jed Kessler spoke  about set fire to the munition plant?\" questioned Ruth.    \"I don't know what to think, Ruth,\" answered Jack. \"One thing is  certain: If the first explosions weren't accidental, then they must  have been due to some underhand work.\"    During the time the boys spent with the girls at the boathouse there  were no more explosions, and now the fire on the opposite shore of the  lake was dying out, while only a small part of the pall of  curious-colored smoke remained.    \"I guess it's about over,\" was Randy's comment.    Feeling that those at Clearwater Hall would be safe, at least for the  time being, the Rovers decided to return to Colby Hall, knowing that  Colonel Colby and his assistants would be anxious concerning the  welfare of all the cadets.    Spouter and those with him had taken one automobile, but the other  remained, and, bidding the girls good-bye, the Rover boys jumped into  this and were soon off. Jack was at the wheel, and in spite of the  numerous machines on the road, for the blowing-up of the shell-loading  plant had caused great excitement for many miles around, he drove the  car with considerable speed in the direction of Haven Point.    \"Let us stop at the town for a few minutes and find out, if we can,  just how bad this affair has been,\" said Fred.    \"That's it!\" returned Randy. \"I'd like to know if anyone has been  killed or seriously hurt.\"    They stopped on the main street close to where were located a number  of the stores and also the moving-picture theater where the cadets had  first met Ruth Stevenson and her chums.    \"It's a pretty bad affair,\" said one of the storekeepers, with whom in  the past the boys had done some trading. \"I was just down to police  headquarters, and they say there that two workmen were killed and  about fifteen injured. It certainly is a rascally piece of business,  and the fellows who did it ought to be strung up.\"    \"Then they are pretty certain that it is the work of some German  sympathizers?\" questioned Jack quickly.    \"They can't figure it out any other way. The boss of the plant, and  likewise two of his head foremen, have been closely questioned, and  they declare that every possible precaution against accidents was  taken. More than that, they say that there were two separate  explosions occurring almost at the same time--one down on the railroad  tracks and another in a storehouse quite a distance away.\"    \"Yes, we heard that, too, from one of the dockmen of the plant,\"  answered Fred. \"He said he thought two men who looked like Germans and  who had been hanging around the plant might be guilty.\"    \"Yes, I've heard "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2330"],[0,"Religions of Ancient China (#6)"],[1,"before the departure of the  mission, and has left it on record that he himself actually heard the  voices of spirits.        CHAPTER III -- TAOISM    Lao Tzu.--Meanwhile, other influences had been helping to divert the  attention of the Chinese people from the simple worship of God and of  the powers of nature. The philosophy associated with the name of Lao  Tzu, who lived nobody knows when,--probably about B.C. 600--which is  popularly known as Taoism, from Tao, the omnipresent, omnipotent, and  unthinkable principle on which it is based, operated with Confucianism,  though in an opposite direction, in dislimning the old faith while  putting nothing satisfactory in its place. Confucianism, with its  shadowy monotheistic background, was at any rate a practical system for  everyday use, and it may be said to contain all the great ethical truths  to be found in the teachings of Christ. Lao Tzu harped upon a doctrine  of Inaction, by virtue of which all things were to be accomplished,--a  perpetual accommodation of self to one's surroundings, with the minimum  of effort, all progress being spontaneous and in the line of least  resistance. Such a system was naturally far better fitted for the study,  where in fact it has always remained, than for use in ordinary life.    In one of the few genuine utterances of Lao Tzu which have survived the  wreck of time, we find an allusion to a spiritual world. Unfortunately,  it is impossible to say exactly what the passage means. According to Han  Fei (died B.C. 233), who wrote several chapters to elucidate the sayings  of Lao Tzu, the following is the correct interpretation:--    \"Govern a great nation as you would cook a small fish (i.e. do not  overdo it).    \"If the empire is governed according to Tao, evil spirits will not be  worshipped as good ones.    \"If evil spirits are not worshipped as good ones, good ones will do no  injury. Neither will the Sages injure the people. Each will not injure  the other. And if neither injures the other, then there will be mutual  profit.\"    The latter portion is explained by another commentator as follows:--    \"Spirits do not hurt the natural. If people are natural, spirits have  no means of manifesting themselves; and if spirits do not manifest  themselves, we are not conscious of their existence as such. Likewise,  if we are not conscious of the existence of spirits as such, we must be  equally unconscious of the existence of inspired teachers as such; and  to be unconscious of the existence of spirits and of inspired teachers  is the very essence of Tao.\"    Adumbrations of Heracleitus.--In the hands of Lao Tzu's more immediate  followers, Tao became the Absolute, the First Cause, and finally One in  whose obliterating unity all seemingly opposed conditions of time and  space were indistinguishably blended. This One, the source of human  life, was placed beyond the limits of our visible universe; and in order  for human life to return thither at death and to enjoy immortality, it  was only necessary to refine away corporeal grossness according to the  doctrines of Lao Tzu. Later on, this One came to be regarded as a fixed  point of dazzling luminosity, in remote ether, around which circled for  ever and ever, in the supremest glory of motion, the souls of those who  had successfully passed through the ordeal of life, and who had left the  slough of humanity behind them.    The final state is best described by a poet of the ninth century A.D.:--         Like a whirling water-wheel,       Like rolling pearls,--       Yet how are these worthy to be named?       They are but illustrations for fools.       There is the mighty axis of Earth,       The never-resting pole of Heaven;       Let us grasp their clue,       And with them be blended in One,       Beyond the bounds of thought,       Circling for ever in the great Void,       An orbit of a thousand years,--       Yes, this is the key to my theme.    Debased Taoism.--This view naturally suggested the prolongation of  earthly life by artificial means; hence the search for an elixir,  carried on through many centuries by degenerate disciples of Taoism. But  here we must pass on to consider some of the speculations on God, life,  death, and immortality, indulged in by Taoist philosophers and others,  who were not fettered, as the Confucianists were, by traditional  reticence on the subject of spirits and an unseen universe.    Spirits must exist.--Mo Tzu, a philosopher of the fourth and fifth  centuries B.C., was arguing one day for the existence of spirits with a  disbelieving opponent. \"All you have to do,\" he said, \"is to go into  any village and make enquiries. From of old until now the people have  constantly seen and heard spiritual beings; how then can you say they do  not exist? If they had never seen nor heard them, could people say that  they existed?\" \"Of course,\" replied the disbeliever, \"many people have  seen and heard spirits; but is there any instance of a properly verified  appearance?\" Mo Tzu then told a long story of how King Hsuan, B.C.  827-781, unjustly put to death a Minister, and how the latter had said  to the King, \"If there is no consciousness after death, this matter will  be at an end; but if there is, then within three years you will hear  from me.\" Three years later, at a grand durbar, the Minister descended  from heaven on a white horse, and shot the King dead before the eyes of  all.    Traces of Mysticism.--Chuang Tzu, the famous philosopher of the third  and fourth centuries B.C., and exponent of the Tao of Lao Tzu, has the  following allusions to God, of course as seen through Taoist glasses:--    \"God is a principle which exists by virtue of its own intrinsicality,  and operates spontaneously without self-manifestation.    \"He who knows what God is, and what Man is, has attained. Knowing what  God is, he knows that he himself proceeded therefrom. Knowing what Man  is, he rests in the knowledge of the known, waiting for the knowledge of  the unknown.    \"The ultimate end is God. He is manifested in the laws of nature. He is  the hidden spring. At the beginning of all things, He was.\"    Taoism, however, does not seem to have succeeded altogether, any more  than Confucianism, in altogether estranging the Chinese people from  their traditions of a God, more or less personal, whose power was the  real determining factor in human events. The great general Hsiang Yu,  B.C. 233-202, said to his charioteer at the battle which proved fatal  to his fortunes, \"I have fought no fewer than seventy fights, and have  gained dominion over the empire. That I am now brought to this pass is  because God has deserted me.\"        CHAPTER IV -- MATERIALISM    Yang Hsiung.--Yang Hsiung was a philosopher who flourished  B.C. 53 - A.D. 18. He taught that the nature of man at birth is neither  good nor evil, but a mixture of both, and that development in either  direction depends wholly upon environment. To one who asked about God,  he replied, \"What have I to do with God? Watch how without doing  anything He does all things.\" To another who said, \"Surely it is God who  fashions and adorns all earthly forms,\" he replied, \"Not so; if God in  an earthly sense were to fashion and adorn all things, His strength  would not be adequate to the task.\"    Wang Ch'ung.--Wang Ch'ung, A.D. 27-97, denies that men after death live  again as spiritual beings on earth. \"Animals,\" he argues, \"do not become  spirits after death; why should man alone undergo this change? . . .  That which informs man at birth is vitality, and at death this vitality  is extinguished. Vitality is produced by the pulsations of the blood;  when these cease, vitality is extinguished, the body decays, and becomes  dust. How can it become a spirit? . . . When a man dies, his soul  ascends to heaven, and his bones return (_kuei_) to earth; therefore he  is spoken of as a disembodied spirit (_kuei_), the latter word really  meaning that which has returned. . . . Vitality becomes humanity, just  as water becomes ice. The ice melts and is water again; man dies  and reverts to spirituality. . . . The spirits which people see are  invariably in the form of human beings, and that very fact is enough of  itself to prove that these apparitions cannot be the souls of dead men.  If a sack is filled with grain, it will stand up, and is obviously a  sack of grain; but if the sack is burst and the grain falls out, then it  collapses and disappears from view. Now, man's soul is enfolded in his  body as grain in a sack. When he dies his body decays and his vitality  is dissipated; and if when the grain is taken away the sack loses its  form, why, when the vitality is gone, should the body obtain a new shape  in which to appear again in the world? . . . The number of persons who  have died since the world began, old, middle-aged, and young, must run  into thousands of millions, far exceeding the number of persons alive at  the present day. If every one of these has become a disembodied spirit,  there must be at least one to every yard as we walk along the road; and  those who die must now suddenly find themselves face to face with vast  crowds of spirits, filling every house and street. . . . People say that  spirits are the souls of dead men. That being the case, spirits should  always appear naked, for surely it is not contended that clothes have  souls as well as men. . . . It can further be shown not only that dead  men never become spirits, but also that they are without consciousness,  by the fact that before birth they are without consciousness. Before  birth man rests in the First Cause; when he dies he goes back to the  First Cause. The First Cause is vague and without form, and man's soul  is there in a state of unconsciousness. At death the soul reverts to its  original state: how then can it possess consciousness? . . . As a matter  of fact, the universe is full of disembodied spirits, but these are not  the"]]]
