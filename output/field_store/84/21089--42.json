The remarks on this shanty in  the Preface will show the absurdity of both titles. That is all the  explanation I am at liberty to give in print. Whall gives the shanty  on page 118, his version differing but slightly from Capt.  Robertson's.      12. THE WILD GOOSE SHANTY    This I learnt from Capt. John Runciman. Allusions to 'The Wild Goose  Nation' occur in many shanties, but I never obtained any clue to the  meaning (if any) of the term. The verse about 'huckleberry hunting'  was rarely omitted, but I never heard that particular theme further  developed. Whall gives another version (in six-eight time) on page  131.      13. WE'RE ALL BOUND TO GO    I used to hear this tune constantly on the Tyne. It is one of the few  shanties which preserved a definite narrative, but each port seems to  have offered variants on the names of the ships that were 'bound for  Amerikee.' 'Mr. Tapscott' was the head of a famous line of emigrant  ships. The last word in verse 5 was always pronounced _male_. This has  led to many shantymen treating it not as _meal_, but as the _mail_  which the ship carried. As the shanty is full of Irish allusions, the  probabilities are that the word was _meal_, to which the sailor gave  what he considered to be the Irish pronunciation. Whenever I heard the  shanty it was given with an attempt at Irish pronunciation throughout.  Capt. Whall (page 79) gives additional colour to the supposition that  this was a general practice, for his version of verse 6 runs:         'Bad luck unto them _say_-boys,          Bad luck to them I say;        They broke into me _say_-chest          And they stole me clothes away.'      14. WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH THE DRUNKEN SAILOR?    This fine tune--in the first Mode--was always a great favourite.  Although mostly used for windlass or capstan, Sir Walter Runciman  tells me that he frequently sang to it for 'hand-over-hand' hauling.  Whall gives it on page 107 under the title 'Early in the morning.' It  is one of the few shanties that were sung in quick time.      15. BLOW, MY BULLY BOYS    This shanty has been included in every collection that I know of. (See  Whall, page 91.) Most of my sailor relatives sang the last line thus:    [Music illustration: Her masts and yards they shine like silver.]    Spotless decks, and 'masts and yards that shone like silver,' were the  distinguishing marks of a Yankee Packet, and this immaculate condition  was the result of a terrible discipline, in which the belaying pin was  a gruesome factor.      16. BLOW THE MAN DOWN    This is the shanty which is perhaps the best known among landsmen.  'Winchester Street' is in South Shields, and in the old days was the  aristocratic quarter where only persons of high distinction--such as  shipowners, and 'Southspainer' skippers--lived. Whall gives the shanty  on page 92.      17. CHEER'LY, MEN    This is a very well-known shanty, and the variants of it are endless.  This particular version was sung to me by Capt. R.W. Robertson. It  differs but slightly from the version which I originally learnt from  Sir Walter Runciman. Very few of the words were printable, and old  sailors who read my version will no doubt chuckle over the somewhat  pointless continuation of the verses concerning Kitty Carson and Polly  Riddle. They will, of course, see the point of my having supplied a  Chopinesque accompaniment to such a shanty.      18. GOOD MORNING, LADIES ALL    The title belongs to other shanties as well; but, so far as I know,  this tune has never been printed until now. I learnt it from  Northumbrian sailors when a very small boy, and have never heard of  its use in any other than Blyth and Tyne ships. It may be a  Northumbrian air, but from such knowledge as I have gleaned of  Northumbrian folk-tunes, I incline to the conjecture that it may have  been picked up in more southern latitudes by some Northumbrian seaman.      19. HANGING JOHNNY    This cheery riot of gore is wedded to the most plaintive of tunes, and  is immortalized by Masefield in his 'Sailor's Garland.' Nowadays one  occasionally meets unhumorous longshore sailormen who endeavour to  temper its fury to the shorn landsman by palming off a final verse,  which gives one to understand that the previous stanzas have been only  'Johnny's' little fun, and which makes him bleat:         'They said I hanged for money,        But I never hanged nobody.'    I also possess a shanty collection where the words have so clearly  shocked the editor that he has composed an entirely fresh set. These  exhibit 'Johnny' as a spotless moralist, who would never _really_ hang  his parents, but would only operate (in a Pickwickian sense of course)  on naughty and unworthy people:         'I'd hang a noted liar,        I'd hang a bloated friar.         'I'd hang a brutal mother,        I'd hang her and no other.         'I'd hang to make things jolly,        I'd hang all wrong and folly.'    Imagine a shantyman (_farceur_ as he ever was) making for edification  in that style!      20. HILO SOMEBODY    This is another of the shanties I learnt as a boy from Blyth sailors,  and which has never been printed before. I fancy that 'blackbird' and  'crew' must be a perversion of 'blackbird and _crow_,' as the latter  figure of speech occurs in other shanties.      21. OH, RUN, LET THE BULLGINE RUN    The reference to the 'Bullgine' seems to suggest Transatlantic origin.  There were endless verses, but no attempt at narrative beyond a  recital of the names of places from which and to which they were  'running.' This version was sung to me by Mr. F.B. Mayoss, a seaman  who sailed in the old China Clippers.      22. REUBEN RANZO    Alden gives this version, and I fancy it may have once been fairly  general, as several of my relatives used to sing it. The version I  mostly heard from other sailors, however, began:    [Music illustration: Oh, pity poor Reuben Ranzo etc.]    But from Mr. Morley Roberts I had the following:    [Music illustration: Oh, pity poor Reuben Ranzo etc.]    Capt. Robertson's version ran thus:    [Music illustration:         Oh, poor old Reuben Ranzo,       Ranzo, boys, Ranzo,       Oh, poor old Reuben Ranzo,       Ranzo, boys, Ranzo.]    Whall gives another version on page 84.    Who Ranzo was must ever remain a mystery. Capt. Whall suggests that  the word might be a corruption of Lorenzo, since Yankee Whalers took  many Portuguese men from the Azores, where Lorenzo would have been a  common enough name. He adds that in his time the shanty was always  sung to the regulation words, and that 'when the story was finished  there was no attempt at improvization; the text was, I suppose,  considered sacred.' He further says that he never heard any variation  from the words which he gives.    I think he is right about the absence of improvization on extraneous  topics, but I used to hear a good deal of improvization on the subject  of Ranzo himself. I knew at least three endings of the story: (1)  where the captain took him into the cabin, 'larned him navigation,'  and eventually married him to his daughter; (2) where Ranzo's hatred  of ablutions caused the indignant crew to throw him overboard; (3)  where the story ended with the lashes received, not for his dirty  habits, but for a theft:         'We gave him lashes thirty        For stealin' the captain's turkey.'    I have also heard many extemporaneous verses relating his adventures  among the denizens of the deep after he was thrown overboard.      23. THE DEAD HORSE    This shanty was used both for hauling and for pumping ship. It seems  to have had its origin in a rite which took place after the crew had  'worked off the dead horse.' The circumstances were these: Before any  voyage, the crew received a month's pay in advance, which, needless to  say, was spent ashore before the vessel sailed. Jack's first month on  sea was therefore spent in clearing off his advance, which he called  working off the dead horse. The end of that payless period was  celebrated with a solemn ceremony: a mass of straw, or whatever other  combustibles were to hand, was made up into a big bundle, which  sometimes did, and more often did not, resemble a horse. This was  dragged round the deck by all hands, the shanty being sung meanwhile.  The perambulation completed, the dead horse was lighted and hauled up,  usually to the main-yardarm, and when the flames had got a good hold,  the rope was cut and the blazing mass fell into the sea, amid shouts  of jubilation.      24. TOM'S GONE TO HILO    This beautiful tune was very popular. I have chosen the version sung  to me by Mr. George Vickers, although in the first chorus it differs  somewhat from the version I learnt as a boy:    [Music illustration: Away down Hilo etc.]    It will be seen how closely the above resembles the version given by  Whall on page 74. (It will be noted that he entitled it '_John's_ gone  to Hilo.') I give Mr. Vickers's verses about 'The Victory' and  'Trafalgar,' as I had never heard them sung by any other seaman. I  have omitted the endless couplets containing the names of places to  which Tommy is supposed to have travelled. As Capt. Whall says: 'A  good shantyman would take Johnny all round the world to ports with  three syllables, Montreal, Rio Grande Newfoundland, or any such as  might occur to him.'      25. WHISKY JOHNNY    This Bacchanalian chant was a prime favourite. Every sailor knew it,  and every collection includes some version of it.      26. BONEY WAS A WARRIOR    I never met a seaman who has not hoisted topsails to this shanty. Why  Jack should have made a hero of Boney (he frequently pronounced it  'Bonny') is a mystery, except perhaps that, as a sailor, he realized  the true desolation of imprisonment on a sea-girt island, and his  sympathies went out to the lonely exile accordingly. Or it may have  been the natural liking of the Briton for any enemy who proved himself  a 'bonny fechter."]]]
