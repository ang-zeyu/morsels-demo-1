And Romanes, the great animal authority,  thought the same thing. He had a terrier, which accompanied him when he  sang, and actually succeeded in following the prolonged notes of the  human voice with a certain approximation to unison. Dr. Higgins, a  musician, claimed that his large mastiff could sing to the accompaniment  of the organ.    Alix gives such positive examples that they are really marvellous: \"Pere  Pardies cites the case of two dogs that had been taught to sing, one of  them taking a part with his master. Pierquin de Gembloux also speaks of  a poodle that could run the scale in tune and sing very agreeably a fine  composition of Mozart's _My Heart It Sings at Eve_.\" All the scientists  in Paris, according to the same authority, went to see the dog belonging  to Dr. Bennati, and hear it sing the scale, which it could do perfectly.    Monkeys and apes most nearly approximate human musicians. In central  Africa these animal tribes have musical centres where they congregate  regularly for \"concerts.\" Prof. Richard S. Garner, the noted authority  on apes and monkeys, believes that the time has already come for the  establishment of a school for their education. He would have the courses  beginning with a kindergarten and advancing through as many grades as  the students required. Prof. Garner furthermore believes that we have  little understanding of the gorilla, and points out that these animals  have a very happy and harmonious home life, the father being highly  domestic and delighting in the company of his wife and children. It is  not uncommon to find five or six generations in a certain district of  the jungle.    Their near kin, the chimpanzees, are equally clannish, but more musical.  They come down from the branches of the trees, seating themselves on the  dry leaves and assembling like an orchestra. After all are ready, they  begin beating the leaves with their hands, at first very slowly, like  the quiet prelude to a symphony, and gradually increasing in tempo until  the grand crescendo is reached. Then, as if by the direction of an  invisible leader, the music suddenly ceases. To deny that this is to  them a real concert would lead us into extreme absurdities. In this  connection it is interesting to note that when a baby is expected in the  village, all music ceases until after its birth, when they again resume  their periodic musical festivals. Hensel verifies this observation, and  tells us of having seen apes come from their shelter in the early  morning and congregate for a musical concert. \"They repair,\" he says,  \"to the shelter of some gigantic monarch of the forest whose limbs offer  facilities for walking exercises. The head of the family appropriates  one of these branches and advances along it seriously, with elevated  tail, while the others group themselves about him. Soon he gives forth  soft single notes, as the lion likes to do when he tests the capacity of  his lungs. This sound, which seems to be made by drawing the breath in  and out, becomes deeper and in more rapid succession as the excitement  of the singer increases. At last, when the highest pitch is reached, the  intervals cease and the sound becomes a continuous roar, and at this  point all the others, male and female, join in, and for fully ten  seconds at a time the awful chorus sounds through the quiet forest. At  the close the leader begins again with the detached sounds.\"    Perhaps the most remarkable evidence of animals showing a comprehensive  intelligence of musical pitch is demonstrated by cavalry horses. That  they thoroughly understand it is clearly demonstrated by the fact that  they will obey the calls of the bugle for cavalry evolutions without a  moment's hesitation and with no suggestion from outside sources. These  bugle calls are produced by a combination of four notes, each of a  different pitch, and it is rarer to find a horse making a mistake in the  musical orders given than it is for their masters.    Rats and mice have a decided liking for music, as is attested by the  fact that they appear as uninvited guests and also come as near the  performer as possible. Mice, one would believe, love church music, for  they often build their nests in pipe organs, thus being able to rear  their children in both a musical and religious atmosphere! There is more  truth than imagination in the story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, which  illustrates how they respond to the simple charms of music.    Even donkeys betray tendencies toward musical efforts, and seem to be  aroused by music at least temporarily to a higher mental plane than  Balaam was inclined to ascribe to his wise ass. Not all of them sing  equally well, but in Arizona the donkey is known as the \"desert canary.\"  If you were to spend a few glorious days in the Hopi village of Araibi,  you would hear through the still, silent night their long nasal bray or  song, and you would be convinced that the term is quite appropriate. You  may not exactly like the tune, but you will concede that they sing!    Society is just awakening to the joy and the significance of community  art. This is everywhere indicated by the great growing group of people  who come together for a common music, either as a chorus or an orchestra  or both. But in this field man has not yet attained such unity of  communal effort as have the frogs. In the great swamps of the world  myriads of them gather from miles around, conscious of one purpose, and  by a marvellous understanding and co-operation create for themselves a  symphony with beauties and harmonies of its own, and such as to stand  unrivalled in man's musical world. In the great chorus are voices from  the lowest bass of the croaking bullfrog, squatting in the marshes, to  the myriads of tiny green tree tenors, between which are millions of  altos, contraltos, sopranos, coloraturas and other voices not yet in our  musical vocabulary. These are accompanied by all the sounds of our  orchestra and innumerable others of such delicate shades and gradations  as to defy the ear of man. If we listen to one of these concerts, we  will quickly recognise the tones of every familiar instrument, such as  the drum, pipe, horn, trombone, oboe, piccolo, 'cello, and violin. The  greatest of these musical festivals directly precedes the mating season,  and is a dramatic instance of a manifestation of an inner rhythm which  corresponds to an external periodicity.    Among the oldest traditions of the Eastern world are those of  snake-charming by means of music. I have long been interested in this  strange phenomenon of Nature, and in company with a brilliant young  violinist visited a zoological park recently, and after securing  permission from the head keeper, entered the snake-house. The violinist  began by playing a few most sympathetic chords, first delicate and soft,  then sad, then gay, slow or tremulous. Near us, coiled in his immense  cage, was a large cobra--the snake which all legend claims is most  easily influenced by music. Almost immediately after the music began,  the cobra raised himself in a listening attitude, steadily gazed at us  as though he were viewing the future, spread his immense hood, and  slowly began to shake his head from side to side, as if he were trying  to keep time to the music. As soon as the music would change, his  attitude changed accordingly. Only after the music had ceased did he  resume his normal position.    The Indians agree that under the influence of various musical  instruments, especially bagpipes, snake-charmers are able to get the  snakes to come out from their homes among the old rocks and walls, and  when they appear they seem perfectly dazed so that they can be easily  captured.    It is not well to have any kind of musical instrument played, when in a  forest at night where there are dangerous snakes, lest they come to hear  it. Snake-hunters always carry with them some kind of musical  instrument, depending upon the kind of snakes they wish to capture. It  seems that all are not equally fascinated by it. I have experimented  with little effect upon a large rattler; it may have been that he was  deaf. But he gave little evidence of being interested.    We need not feel humiliated, then, for our animal kinspeople with their  primitive music: we were monkeys, and before them we were reptiles,  birds, fishes, even worms. But that was ages ago, and we have grown up  and become better musicians. Evolution has chosen us as its favourites  and given us every advantage in the struggle up the ladder of life. Our  musical rivals of yesterday are as chorus people compared to  Metropolitan Opera stars, with us. On this earth we reign supreme, we  have conquered the earth, air, and water, annihilating time and  distance. What more is there for us to learn of Nature's secrets? Only  an understanding of our lower brothers, the animals.          III    ANIMALS AT PLAY      _\"... _About them frisking, played    All beasts of the earth, since wild, and of all chase    In wood or wilderness, forest or den;    Sporting the lion romped, and in his paw    Dandled the kid; bears, tigers, ounces, pards,    Gambled before them; the unwieldy elephant,    To make them mirth, used all his might, and wreathed    His light proboscis.\"_      _--Paradise Lost._      That \"one touch of Nature makes the whole world kin\" is shown in no  clearer way than by the games and play of animals. Recreation is as  common among them as it is among our own children; and they seem always  to be artistic and even skilled in their play. Young goats and lambs  skip, jump, run races, throw flips in the air, and gambol; calves have  interesting frolics; young colts and mules have biting and kicking  games; bears wrestle and tumble; puppies delight in biting and tussling;  while kittens chase everything from spools of thread to their own  tails.

CHAPTER III.      For some time before Louis' arrival at Ashfield House, preparations  had been making in the doctor's domestic _menage_ for the approaching  marriage of Miss Wilkinson, the doctor's only daughter. The young  gentlemen had, likewise, their preparations for the auspicious event,  the result of which was a Latin Epithalamium, composed by the seniors,  and three magnificent triumphal arches, erected on the way from the  house-door to the gate of the grounds. Much was the day talked of,  and eagerly were plans laid, both by masters and pupils, for the proper  enjoyment of the whole holiday that had been promised on the occasion,  and which, by the way--whatever young gentlemen generally may think of  their masters' extreme partiality for teaching--was now a greater boon  to the wearied and over-fagged ushers, than to the party for whose  enjoyment it was principally designed.    The bridal day came.--No need to descant on the weather. The sun shone  as brightly as could be desired, and as the interesting procession passed  under the green bowers, cheer after cheer rose on the air, handfuls of  flowers were trodden under the horses' feet, and hats, by common consent,  performed various somersaults some yards above their owners' heads.    There was a long watch till the carriages returned, and the same scene  was enacted and repeated, when the single vehicle rolled away from the  door; and the last mark of honor having been paid, the party dispersed  over the large playground, each one in search of his own amusement. Louis  wandered away by himself, and enjoyed a quiet hour unmolested, and tried,  with the help of his little hymn-book, and thinking over old times, to  bring back some of his former happy thoughts. There were more than  ordinary temptations around him, and he felt less able to resist them;  and this little rest from noise and hurry was to him very grateful.  When, at length, a little party found out his retreat and begged him  to join in a game of \"hocky,\" he complied with a light and merry heart,  freer from that restless anxiety to which he had been lately so much  subject.    In the afternoon, determining to let nothing interfere with the learning  of his lessons, Louis sat down in the school-room to business. There were  but two persons besides himself in the room, one of whom was an usher,  who was writing a letter, and the other, his school-fellow Ferrers. The  latter was sitting on the opposite side of the same range of desks Louis  had chosen, very intently engaged in the same work which had brought  Louis there.    Louis felt very happy in the consciousness that he was foregoing  the pleasure of the merry playground for the stern business that his  duty had imposed on him; and the noise of his companions' voices,  and the soft breezes that came in through the open door leading into  the playground, only spurred him on to finish his work as quickly  as possible.    Ferrers and his younger _vis-a-vis_ pursued their work in silence,  apparently unconscious of the presence of each other, until the  former, raising his head, asked Louis to fetch him an atlas out  of the study.    \"With pleasure,\" said Louis, jumping up and running into the study;  he returned almost immediately with a large atlas, and laid it down  on Ferrers' books. He had once more given his close attention to his  difficult exercises, when a movement from his companion attracted  his notice.    \"Did you speak?\" he said.    \"Will you--oh, never mind, I'll do it myself,\" muttered Ferrers,  rising and going into the class-room himself.    Louis had become again so intent upon his study, that he was hardly  aware of the return of his school-fellow, nor did he notice the  precipitation with which he hurried into his place, and half hid  the book he had brought with him, a book that he imagined to be a  key to his exercises, but which, in fact, was a counterpart to that  taken away from Harrison, though bound exactly like the one Ferrers  had gone for, and so nearly the same size as easily to be mistaken  for it in the confusion attendant on the abstraction of it.    Just at this moment, Hamilton, Trevannion, and Salisbury, with one or  two more of the first class, entered from the playground, and walked  directly across to Ferrers.    Alive to all the disgrace of being found by his class-fellows in  possession of a key, and unable to return it unobserved, Ferrers,  in the first moment of alarm, tried to push it into the desk at  which he was writing, but finding it locked, he stood up with as  much self-possession as he could assume, and pretending to be  looking among his books and papers, managed, unobserved, to pass  the obnoxious volume over to Louis' heap of books, laying it half  under one of them. Louis was wholly unconscious of the danger so  near him, and did not raise his held from his absorbing occupation  when the fresh comers approached the desk.    \"Ferrers,\" said Salisbury, as they came up, \"we want your advice on  a small matter; come with us into the class-room.\"    Accordingly Ferrers obeyed, glad to leave the dangerous spot, and Louis  was left in undisturbed possession of the apartment for more than half  an hour, at the end of which time the party returned from the inner  room laughing, and all walked out of doors. Just as they passed out,  Mr. Witworth, the usher, approached Louis, and asked him if he could  lend him a pencil. Louis laid his pen down, and began to search his  pockets for a pencil he knew should be there, when he was startled by  the ejaculation of the master:    \"Hey!--what!--This is it, is it? So I have found you out, sir.\"    Louis looked up in alarm. \"Found me out, sir?\" he said, in a terrified  tone: \"what have I done?\"    \"Done!\" exclaimed Mr. Witworth,--\"done, indeed: what are you doing there?\"    \"My exercise, sir.\"    \"To be sure, to be sure. What's the meaning of this, sir?\" and he held  up the key. \"What have you done, indeed!--you hoped that it was nicely  concealed, I dare say. I wonder how you can be so artful.\"    \"I am sure I don't know any thing about that book,\" said Louis,  in great agitation.    \"Admirably acted,\" said Mr. Witworth. \"It wouldn't walk here, however,  Master Mortimer: some one must have brought it.\"    \"I am sure I don't know who did--I don't indeed,\" said poor Louis,  despairingly.    \"Perhaps you'll try to make me believe you don't know what it is,  and that you never saw the book before,\" remarked Mr. Witworth,  scornfully.    \"I do know what it is, but I never used it, I do assure you, sir,  and I did not bring it here. Will you not believe me?\"    \"It is very likely that I should believe you, is it not? Well, sir,  this book goes up with you to-morrow to Dr. Wilkinson, and we shall  see how much he will believe of your story. This accounts for your  apparent industry lately.\" So saying, Mr. Witworth walked off with  the book in his hand, leaving Louis in the greatest distress.    \"And all my pains are quite lost!\" he exclaimed, as he burst into tears.  \"The doctor is sure not to believe me, and there will be--oh, who could  have left it there?\"    \"Louis, are you coming out this afternoon; what's the matter?\"  exclaimed the welcome voice of his brother.    \"What, Lady Louisa in tears! Here's the ink bottle; do let me catch the  crystal drops,\" said Frank Digby, who accompanied Reginald in search of  his brother.    \"Oh, Reginald!\" exclaimed Louis, regardless of Frank's nonsense, \"some  one has left a key to my exercises on my books, and Mr. Witworth has  just found it. What shall I do?\"    \"_Some one has left_,\" ejaculated Frank. \"That's a good story, Louis;  only one can't quite swallow it, you know. Who would leave it, eh?\"    \"How? where, Louis?\" said Reginald.    \"It was just here it was found. I am sure I cannot think who put  it there.\"    \"Well of all the\"--began Frank; \"my astonishment positively chokes me.  Louis, are you not ashamed of yourself?\"    \"Oh, Frank! I am speaking the truth; I am, indeed, I am--Reginald,  I am, you know I am.\"    \"It is very strange,\" remarked Reginald, who was standing with a  clouded, unsatisfied brow, and did not exhibit that enthusiasm  respecting his innocence which Louis expected from him. Reginald  knew too much, and dared not yet be certain when appearances were  so sadly against him.    \"Reginald, dear Reginald, tell me,\" cried Louis, almost frantically;  \"surely you believe me?\"    \"Believe you!\" echoed Frank, scornfully; \"he knows you too well,  and so do I. Remember last year, Louis: you'd better have thought  of it sooner.\"    Reginald cast a threatening glance on his cousin, who undauntedly  replied to it.    \"You can't gainsay that, at any rate, Reginald.\"    \"Reginald, dear Reginald,\" cried Louis, with streaming eyes, \"you know  I always spoke the truth to you; I declare solemnly that I am speaking  only the truth now.\"    Reginald looked gloomily at his brother.    \"Indeed it is. If you will not believe me, who will?\"    \"Who, indeed?\" said Frank.    \"I do believe you, Louis,\" said Reginald, quickly, \"I do believe you;  but this matter must be sifted. It is very strange, but I will make all  the inquiries I can. Who sat with you?\"    \"Ferrers was sitting there,\" replied Louis.    \"Any one else?\"    \"No,\" replied Louis.    \"I'll answer for it, it was Ferrers,\" said Reginald.    \"A likely story,\" said Frank.    \"I think it very likely,\" said Reginald, firmly, \"and woe be to him  if he has.\"    As he finished speaking, Reginald ran off in search of Ferrers,  whom he found in a group of the head boys, into the midst of which  he burst without the smallest ceremony.    \"Manners!\" exclaimed Hamilton; \"I beg your pardon, Mr. Mortimer,  for"]]]
