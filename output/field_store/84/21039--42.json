[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1995"],[0,"The Divine Comedy, Volume 1, Hell (#6)"],[1," good Master began to say, \"Look at him  with that sword in hand who cometh before the three, even as  lord. He is Homer, the sovereign poet; the next who comes is  Horace, the satirist; Ovid is the third, and the last is Lucan.  Since each shares with me the name that the single voice sounded,  they do me honor, and in that do well\"    Thus I saw assembled the fair school of that Lord of the loftiest  song which above the others as an eagle flies. After they had  discoursed somewhat together, they turned to me with sign of  salutation; and my Master smiled thereat. And far more of honor  yet they did me, for they made me of their band, so that I was  the sixth amid so much wit. Thus we went on as far as the light,  speaking things concerning which silence is becoming, even as was  speech there where I was.    We came to the foot of a noble castle, seven times circled by  high walls, defended round about by a fair streamlet. This we  passed as if hard ground; through seven gates I entered with  these sages; we came to a meadow of fresh verdure. People were  there with eyes slow and grave, of great authority in their  looks; they spake seldom, and with soft voices. Thus we drew  apart, on one side, into a place open, luminous, and high, so  that they all could be seen. There opposite upon the green enamel  were shown to me the great spirits, whom to have seen I inwardly  exalt myself.    I saw Electra with many companions, among whom I knew both Hector  and Aeneas, Caesar in armor, with his gerfalcon eyes; I saw  Camilla and Penthesilea on the other side, and I saw the King  Latinus, who was seated with Lavinia his daughter. I saw that  Brutus who drove out Tarquin; Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and  Cornelia; and alone, apart, I saw the Saladin. When I raised my  brow a little more, I saw the Master of those who know, seated  amid the philosophic family; all regard him, all do him honor.  Here I saw both Socrates and Plato, who before the others stand  nearest to him; Democritus, who ascribes the world to chance;  Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Thales, Empedocles, Heraclitus, and  Zeno; and I saw the good collector of the qualities, Dioscorides,  I mean; and I saw Orpheus, Tully, and Linus, and moral Seneca,  Euclid the geometer, and Ptolemy, Hippocrates, Avicenna, Galen,  and Averrhoes, who made the great comment. I cannot report of all  in full, because the long theme so drives me that many times  speech comes short of fact.    The company of six is reduced to two. By another way the wise  guide leads me, out from the quiet, into the air that trembles,  and I come into a region where is nothing that can give light.        CANTO V. The Second Circle, that of Carnal Sinners.--Minos.--  Shades renowned of old.--Francesca da Rimini.    Thus I descended from the first circle down into the second,  which girdles less space, and so much more woe that it goads to  wailing. There abides Minos horribly, and snarls; he examines the  sins at the entrance; he judges, and he sends according as he  entwines himself. I mean, that, when the miscreant spirit comes  there before him, it confesses itself wholly, and that discerner  of sins sees what place of Hell is for it; he girdles himself  with his tail so many times as the degrees he wills it should be  sent down. Always before him stand many of them. They go, in  turn, each to the judgment; they speak, and hear, and then are  whirled below.    \"O thou that comest to the woeful inn,\" said Minos to me, when he  saw me, leaving the act of so great an office, \"beware how thou  enterest, and to whom thou trustest thyself; let not the  amplitude of the entrance deceive thee.\" And my Leader to  him, \"Why then dost thou cry out? Hinder not his fated going;  thus is it willed there where is power to do that which is  willed; and ask thou no more.\"    Now the woeful notes begin to make themselves heard; now am I  come where much lamentation smites me. I had come into a place  mute of all light, that bellows as the sea does in a tempest, if  it be combated by opposing winds. The infernal hurricane that  never rests carries along the spirits in its rapine; whirling and  smiting it molests them. When they arrive before its rushing  blast, here are shrieks, and bewailing, and lamenting; here they  blaspheme the power divine. I understood that to such torment are  condemned the carnal sinners who subject reason to appetite. And  as their wings bear along the starlings in the cold season in a  troop large and full, so that blast the evil spirits; hither,  thither, down, up it carries them; no hope ever comforts them,  not of repose, but even of less pain.    And as the cranes go singing their lays, making in air a long  line of themselves, so saw I come, uttering wails, shades borne  along by the aforesaid strife. Wherefore I said, \"Master, who are  those folk whom the black air so castigates?\" \"The first of these  of whom thou wishest to have knowledge,\" said he to me then, \"was  empress of many tongues. To the vice of luxury was she so  abandoned that lust she made licit in her law, to take away the  blame she had incurred. She is Semiramis, of whom it is read that  she succeeded Ninus and had been his spouse; she held the land  which the Soldan rules. That other is she who, for love, killed  herself, and broke faith to the ashes of Sichaeus. Next is  Cleopatra, the luxurious. See Helen, for whom so long a time of  ill revolved; and see the great Achilles, who at the end fought  with love. See Paris, Tristan,--\" and more than a thousand shades  he showed me with his finger, and named them, whom love had  parted from our life.    After I had heard my Teacher name the dames of eld and the  cavaliers, pity overcame me, and I was well nigh bewildered. I  began, \"Poet, willingly would I speak with those two that go  together, and seem to be so light upon the wind.\" And he to me,  \"Thou shalt see when they shall be nearer to us, and do thou then  pray them by that love which leads them, and they will come.\"  Soon as the wind sways them toward us I lifted my voice, \"O weary  souls, come speak to us, if One forbid it not.\"    As doves, called by desire, with wings open and steady, fly  through the air to their sweet nest, borne by their will, these  issued from the troop where Dido is, coming to us through the  malign air, so strong was the compassionate cry.    \"O living creature, gracious and benign, that goest through the  lurid air visiting us who stained the world blood-red,--if the  King of the universe were a friend we would pray Him for thy  peace, since thou hast pity on our perverse ill. Of what it  pleaseth thee to hear, and what to speak, we will hear and we  will speak to you, while the wind, as now, is hushed for us. The  city where I was born sits upon the sea-shore, where the Po, with  its followers, descends to have peace. Love, that on gentle heart  quickly lays hold, seized him for the fair person that was taken  from me, and the mode still hurts me. Love, which absolves no  loved one from loving, seized me for the pleasing of him so  strongly that, as thou seest, it does not even now abandon me.  Love brought us to one death. Caina awaits him who quenched our  life.\" These words were borne to us from them.    Soon as I had heard those injured souls I bowed my face, and held  it down, until the Poet said to me, \"What art thou thinking?\"  When I replied, I began, \"Alas! how many sweet thoughts, how  great desire, led these unto the woeful pass.\" Then I turned me  again to them, and I spoke, and began, \"Francesca, thy torments  make me sad and piteous to weeping. But tell me, at the time of  the sweet sighs by what and how did love concede to you to know  the dubious desires?\" And she to me, \"There is no greater woe  than in misery to remember the happy time, and that thy Teacher  knows. But if to know the first root of our love thou hast so  great a longing, I will do like one who weeps and tells.    \"We were reading one day, for delight, of Lancelot, how love  constrained him. We were alone and without any suspicion. Many  times that reading made us lift our eyes, and took the color from  our faces, but only one point was that which overcame us. When we  read of the longed-for smile being kissed by such a lover, this  one, who never from me shall be divided, kissed my mouth all  trembling. Galahaut was the book, and he who wrote it. That day  we read in it no farther.\"[1]    [1] In the Romance, it was Galahaut that prevailed on Guinevere  to give a kiss to Lancelot.      While one spirit said this the other was weeping so that through  pity I swooned, as if I had been dying, and fell as a dead body  falls.        CANTO VI. The Third Circle, that of the Gluttonous.--Cerberus.--  Ciacco.    When the mind returned, which closed itself before the pity of  these two kinsfolk, that had all confounded me with sadness, new  torments and new tormented souls I see around me wherever I move,  and howsoever I turn, and wherever I gaze.    I am in the third circle, that of the rain eternal, accursed,  cold, and heavy. Its rule and quality are never new. Coarse hail,  and foul water and snow pour down through the tenebrous air; the  earth that receives them stinks. Cerberus, a beast cruel and  monstrous, with three throats barks doglike above the people that  are here submerged. He has vermilion eyes, and a greasy and black  beard, and a big belly, and hands armed with claws: he tears the  spirits, flays them, and rends them. The rain makes them howl  like dogs; of one of their sides they make a screen for the  other; the profane wretches often turn themselves.    When Cerberus, the great worm, observed us he opened his mouths,  and showed his fangs to us; not a limb had he that he kept quiet.  And my Leader opened wide his hands, took some earth, and with  full fists threw it into the ravenous gullets. As the dog that  barking craves, and becomes quiet when he bites his food, and is  intent and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19950"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part III (Tertia Pars) (#6)"],[1,"in living things the principle of  generation is an intrinsic principle, this word \"nature\" was further  employed to signify any intrinsic principle of motion: thus the  Philosopher says (Phys. ii) that \"nature is the principle of motion  in that in which it is essentially and not accidentally.\" Now this  principle is either form or matter. Hence sometimes form is called  nature, and sometimes matter. And because the end of natural  generation, in that which is generated, is the essence of the  species, which the definition signifies, this essence of the species  is called the \"nature.\" And thus Boethius defines nature (De Duab.  Nat.): \"Nature is what informs a thing with its specific difference,  \"--i.e. which perfects the specific definition. But we are now  speaking of nature as it signifies the essence, or the \"what-it-is,\"  or the quiddity of the species.    Now, if we take nature in this way, it is impossible that the union  of the Incarnate Word took place in the nature. For one thing is made  of two or more in three ways. First, from two complete things which  remain in their perfection. This can only happen to those whose form  is composition, order, or figure, as a heap is made up of many stones  brought together without any order, but solely with juxtaposition;  and a house is made of stones and beams arranged in order, and  fashioned to a figure. And in this way some said the union was by  manner of confusion (which is without order) or by manner of  commensuration (which is with order). But this cannot be. First,  because neither composition nor order nor figure is a substantial  form, but accidental; and hence it would follow that the union of the  Incarnation was not essential, but accidental, which will be  disproved later on (A. 6). Secondly, because thereby we should not  have an absolute unity, but relative only, for there remain several  things actually. Thirdly, because the form of such is not a nature,  but an art, as the form of a house; and thus one nature would not be  constituted in Christ, as they wish.    Secondly, one thing is made up of several things, perfect but  changed, as a mixture is made up of its elements; and in this way  some have said that the union of the Incarnation was brought about by  manner of combination. But this cannot be. First, because the Divine  Nature is altogether immutable, as has been said (I, Q. 9, AA. 1, 2),  hence neither can it be changed into something else, since it is  incorruptible; nor can anything else be changed into it, for it  cannot be generated. Secondly, because what is mixed is of the same  species with none of the elements; for flesh differs in species from  any of its elements. And thus Christ would be of the same nature  neither with His Father nor with His Mother. Thirdly, because there  can be no mingling of things widely apart; for the species of one of  them is absorbed, e.g. if we were to put a drop of water in a flagon  of wine. And hence, since the Divine Nature infinitely exceeds the  human nature, there could be no mixture, but the Divine Nature alone  would remain.    Thirdly, a thing is made up of things not mixed nor changed, but  imperfect; as man is made up of soul and body, and likewise of divers  members. But this cannot be said of the mystery of the Incarnation.  First, because each nature, i.e. the Divine and the human, has its  specific perfection. Secondly, because the Divine and human natures  cannot constitute anything after the manner of quantitative parts, as  the members make up the body; for the Divine Nature is incorporeal;  nor after the manner of form and matter, for the Divine Nature cannot  be the form of anything, especially of anything corporeal, since it  would follow that the species resulting therefrom would be  communicable to several, and thus there would be several Christs.  Thirdly, because Christ would exist neither in human nature nor in  the Divine Nature: since any difference varies the species, as unity  varies number, as is said (Metaph. viii, text. 10).    Reply Obj. 1: This authority of Cyril is expounded in the Fifth Synod  (i.e. Constantinople II, coll. viii, can. 8) thus: \"If anyone  proclaiming one nature of the Word of God to be incarnate does not  receive it as the Fathers taught, viz. that from the Divine and human  natures (a union in subsistence having taken place) one Christ  results, but endeavors from these words to introduce one nature or  substance of the Divinity and flesh of Christ, let such a one be  anathema.\" Hence the sense is not that from two natures one results;  but that the Nature of the Word of God united flesh to Itself in  Person.    Reply Obj. 2: From the soul and body a double unity, viz. of nature  and person--results in each individual--of nature inasmuch as the  soul is united to the body, and formally perfects it, so that one  nature springs from the two as from act and potentiality or from  matter and form. But the comparison is not in this sense, for the  Divine Nature cannot be the form of a body, as was proved (I, Q. 3,  A. 8). Unity of person results from them, however, inasmuch as there  is an individual subsisting in flesh and soul; and herein lies the  likeness, for the one Christ subsists in the Divine and human natures.    Reply Obj. 3: As Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 6, 11), the  Divine Nature is said to be incarnate because It is united to flesh  personally, and not that It is changed into flesh. So likewise the  flesh is said to be deified, as he also says (De Fide Orth. 15, 17),  not by change, but by union with the Word, its natural properties  still remaining, and hence it may be considered as deified, inasmuch  as it becomes the flesh of the Word of God, but not that it becomes  God.  _______________________    SECOND ARTICLE [III, Q. 2, Art. 2]    Whether the Union of the Incarnate Word Took Place in the Person?    Objection 1: It would seem that the union of the Incarnate Word did  not take place in the person. For the Person of God is not distinct  from His Nature, as we said (I, Q. 39, A. 1). If, therefore, the  union did not take place in the nature, it follows that it did not  take place in the person.    Obj. 2: Further, Christ's human nature has no less dignity than ours.  But personality belongs to dignity, as was stated above (I, Q. 29, A.  3, ad 2). Hence, since our human nature has its proper personality,  much more reason was there that Christ's should have its proper  personality.    Obj. 3: Further, as Boethius says (De Duab. Nat.), a person is an  individual substance of rational nature. But the Word of God assumed  an individual human nature, for \"universal human nature does not  exist of itself, but is the object of pure thought,\" as Damascene  says (De Fide Orth. iii, 11). Therefore the human nature of Christ  has its personality. Hence it does not seem that the union took place  in the person.    _On the contrary,_ We read in the Synod of Chalcedon (Part ii, act.  5): \"We confess that our Lord Jesus Christ is not parted or divided  into two persons, but is one and the same only-Begotten Son and Word  of God.\" Therefore the union took place in the person.    _I answer that,_ Person has a different meaning from \"nature.\" For  nature, as has been said (A. 1), designates the specific essence  which is signified by the definition. And if nothing was found to be  added to what belongs to the notion of the species, there would be no  need to distinguish the nature from the suppositum of the nature  (which is the individual subsisting in this nature), because every  individual subsisting in a nature would be altogether one with its  nature. Now in certain subsisting things we happen to find what does  not belong to the notion of the species, viz. accidents and  individuating principles, which appears chiefly in such as are  composed of matter and form. Hence in such as these the nature and  the suppositum really differ; not indeed as if they were wholly  separate, but because the suppositum includes the nature, and in  addition certain other things outside the notion of the species.  Hence the suppositum is taken to be a whole which has the nature as  its formal part to perfect it; and consequently in such as are  composed of matter and form the nature is not predicated of the  suppositum, for we do not say that this man is his manhood. But if  there is a thing in which there is nothing outside the species or its  nature (as in God), the suppositum and the nature are not really  distinct in it, but only in our way of thinking, inasmuch it is  called \"nature\" as it is an essence, and a suppositum as it is  subsisting. And what is said of a suppositum is to be applied to a  person in rational or intellectual creatures; for a person is nothing  else than \"an individual substance of rational nature,\" according to  Boethius. Therefore, whatever adheres to a person is united to it in  person, whether it belongs to its nature or not. Hence, if the human  nature is not united to God the Word in person, it is nowise united  to Him; and thus belief in the Incarnation is altogether done away  with, and Christian faith wholly overturned. Therefore, inasmuch as  the Word has a human nature united to Him, which does not belong to  His Divine Nature, it follows that the union took place in the Person  of the Word, and not in the nature.    Reply Obj. 1: Although in God Nature and Person are not really  distinct, yet they have distinct meanings, as was said above,  inasmuch as person signifies after the manner of something  subsisting. And because human nature is united to the Word, so that  the Word subsists in it, and not so that His Nature receives  therefrom any addition or change, it follows that the union of human  nature to the Word of God took place in the person, and not in the  nature.    Reply Obj. 2: Personality pertains of necessity to the dignity of a  thing, and to its perfection so far as it pertains to the"]]]
