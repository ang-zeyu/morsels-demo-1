[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24001"],[0,"The Physical Life of Woman: Advice to the Maiden, Wife and Mother (#6)"],[1," have reached this  conclusion: In the middle portion of the temperate zone, the average age  when the first period appears in healthy girls is fourteen years and six  months. If it occurs more than six months later or earlier than this,  then it is likely something is wrong, or, at least, the case is  exceptional.    Exceptional cases, where this average is widely departed from in  apparently perfect health, are rare. But they do occur. We have known  instances where the solicitude of parents has been excited by the long  delay of this constitutional change, and others in which it has taken  place at an almost tender age, without causing any perceptible injury to  the general health.    There is an instance recorded, on good authority, where a French child  but three years old underwent all the physical changes incident to  puberty, and grew to be a healthy woman. But what children can surpass  the American in precocity? This French child-woman is quite left in the  shade by one described in a recent number of a western medical journal,  who _from her birth_ had regular monthly changes, and the full physical  development which marks the perfect woman!    Thus, sometimes, a wide deviation from the average age we have stated  occurs, without having any serious meaning. Yet at no time is such a  deviation to be neglected. In nine out of ten instances it is owing to  some fault in the constitution, the health, or formation, which should  be ascertained and corrected. Otherwise years of broken health and  mental misery may be the sad results. Mothers, teachers, it is with you  this responsibility rests. The thousands of wretched wives, who owe  their wretchedness to a neglect of proper attention at this  turning-point of their lives, warn you how serious is this  responsibility.    The foundation of old age, says a distinguished author, is laid in  childhood; but the health of middle-life depends upon puberty. Never was  there a truer maxim. The two years which change the girl to the woman  often seal for ever the happiness or the hopeless misery of her whole  life. They decide whether she is to become a healthy, helpful, cheerful  wife and mother, or a languid, complaining invalid, to whom marriage is  a curse, children an affliction, and life itself a burden.    We reiterate our warning: Mothers, teachers, you to whom children are  confided at this crisis of their lives, look well to it that you  appreciate, understand, and observe the duties you have assumed. Let no  false modesty prevent you from learning and enforcing those precautions,  so necessary at this period of life.      WHAT HASTENS AND WHAT RETARDS PUBERTY?    As a rule, we find that those who develope early, fade early. A short  childhood portends a premature old age. It often foreshadows, also, a  feeble middle-life.    Having ascertained, therefore, what is the average age at which puberty  takes place with us, let us see what conditions anticipate or retard  this age.    The most important is _climate._    In hot climates, man, like the vegetation, has a surprising rapidity of  growth. Marriages are usual at twelve or fourteen years of age. Puberty  comes to both sexes as early as at ten and eleven years. We even read in  the life of Mohammed, that one of his wives, when but ten years of age,  bore him a son. Let another dozen years pass, and these blooming maidens  have been metamorphosed into wrinkled, faded old women. The beauty of  their precocious youth has withered almost literally like a flower which  is plucked.    Very different is it in the cold and barren regions of the far north.  There man, once more partaking of the nature of his surroundings, yields  as slowly to the impulses of his passions as does the ice-bound earth to  the slanting rays of the summer sun. Maturity, so quick to come, so  swift to leave in the torrid heats, arrives, chilled by the long  winters, to the girls of Lapland, Norway, and Siberia, only when they  are eighteen and nineteen years of age. But, in return for this, they  retain their vigor and good looks to a green old age.    Between these extremes, including as they do the whole second decade of  existence, this important change takes place normally in different  latitudes. We have said that in the middle temperate zone the proper age  is fourteen years and six months. Let us now see what conditions lead to  deviations from this age in our climate.    First on the list is that sacred fire handed down to us from our  ancestors, which we call, in our material language, the _constitution._    The females of certain races, certain families, it is often noticed,  mature earlier than their neighbours. Jewesses, for example, are always  precocious, earlier by one or two years. So are colored girls, and those  of creole lineage. We can guess the reasons here. No doubt these  children still retain in their blood the tropic fire which, at  comparatively recent periods, their forefathers felt under the vertical  rays of the torrid zone.    Nor is this all. It is well ascertained, from numerous observations,  that brunettes develope sooner than their blonde sisters; that those who  will grow to be large women are slower than those whose stature will be  small; that the dark-haired and black-eyed are more precocious in this  respect than the light-haired and blue-eyed; that the fat, sluggish girl  is more tardy than the slender, active one; that, in general, what is  known as the nervo-bilious temperament is ever ahead of that called the  lymphatic or phlegmatic.    It is a familiar fact, that it is not a good sign to see this change  before the usual average time. It betokens a weakly, excitable,  diminutive frame. Hard labor, vigorous, regular muscular exertion--prime  health, in other words--never tends to anticipate this epoch, but rather  to retard it.    With this warning fresh in our ears, let us now rehearse what causes  constantly incline unduly to hasten puberty, and thus to forestall wise  Nature in her plans for health and beauty. They are of two  kinds,--physical and mental.    Idleness of body, highly-seasoned food, stimulating beverages, such as  beer, wine, liqueurs, and, in a less degree, coffee and tea, irregular  habits of sleep,--these are the physical causes of premature  development. But the mental causes are still more potent.    Whatever _stimulates the emotions_ leads to an unnaturally early sexual  life. Late hours, children's parties, sensational novels, 'flashy'  papers, love stories, the drama, the ball-room, talk of beaux, love, and  marriage,--that atmosphere of riper years which is so often and so  injudiciously thrown around childhood,--all hasten the event which  transforms the girl into the woman. A particular emphasis has been laid  by some physicians on the power of music to awaken the dormant  susceptibilities to passion, and on this account its too general or  earnest cultivation by children has been objected to. Educators would do  well to bear this caution in mind.    How powerfully these causes work is evident when we compare the average  age of puberty in large cities and in country districts. The females in  the former mature from six to eight months sooner than those in the  latter. This is unquestionably owing to their mode of life,--physically  indolent, mentally over-stimulated. The result, too, is seen with  painful plainness in comparing the sturdy, well-preserved farm-wife of  thirty, with the languid, pale, faded city lady of the same age.      THE CHANGES IT WORKS.    Two short years change the awkward and angular girl of fourteen into the  trim and graceful maiden of sweet sixteen. Wonderful metamorphosis! The  magic wand of the fairy has touched her, and she comes forth a new  being, a vision of beauty to bewitch the world.    Let us analyze this change.    The earliest sign of approaching puberty is a deposit of fat in the  loose cellular tissue under the skin. This gives roundness to the form,  and grace to the movements. According to a distinguished naturalist  (Buffon), it is first observable by a slight swelling of the groins.  Thence it extends over the whole body. The breasts especially receive  additions, and develope to form the perfect bust.    Parts of the body previously free from hair become covered with a soft  growth, and that which covers the head acquires more vigor and gloss,  usually becoming one or two shades darker. The eyes brighten, and  acquire unwonted significance. These windows of the soul betray to the  close observer the novel emotions which are arising in the mind within.    The voice, too, shares in the transformation. The piping, slender  articulation of the child gives way to the rich, melodious, soft voice  of woman--the sweetest music man ever hears. To the student of humanity,  to the observant physician, nothing is more symbolical of the whole  nature than the voice. Would you witness a proof of its power? Watch  how a person born blind unerringly discriminates the character of those  he meets by this alone.    Beyond all external modifications, we find others, which indicate how  profound is the alteration now taking place. The internal organs of the  body assume new functions and new powers. The taste for food changes,  hinting that the system has demands hitherto unknown. Those organs we  have adverted to, called the ovaries, increase in size, as also does the  uterus. The very framework of the structure does not escape. The bones  increase in weight, and those around the hips expand, and give the  female her distinctive form, upon the perfection of which her life and  that of her children depend.      MENTAL CHANGES.    Such are the changes which strike the eye. But there are others which  are not less significant, and which demand far more urgently our  watchful heed. New thoughts, strange desires, are invading the soul. A  novel relation is assumed to the world. It is vague, misunderstood, but  disturbing all the same.  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24003"],[0,"Confessions of a Book-Lover (#6)"],[1,"he \"takes  it out\" of those unreasonable people who would not accept his mission  has always been a great delight to me!    Under the spell of his writing, it was a pleasure to pick out the phases  of his history--a history that even then seemed to be so very modern,  and to a boy, with an unspoiled imagination, so very real. It seemed  only natural that he should be converted by a blast of illumination from  God. It is not hard for young people to accept miracles. All life is a  miracle, and the rising and setting of the sun was to me no more of a  miracle than the conversion of this fierce Jew, who was a Roman citizen.  He seemed so very noble and yet so very humble. He could command and  plead and weep and denounce; and he made you feel that he was generally  right. And then he was a tentmaker who understood Greek and who could  speak to the Greeks in their own language.    Late in the seventies when nearly every student I knew was a disciple of  Huxley and Tyndal and devoted to that higher criticism of the Bible  which was Germanizing us all, I fortified myself with St. Paul, and with  the belief that, if he could break the close exclusiveness of the Jews,  and take in the Gentiles, if he could throw off, not contemptuously,  many of the rigid ceremonies of his people, Christianity, in the modern  time, could very well afford to accept the new geological interpretation  of the story of Genesis without destroying in any way the faith which  St. Paul preached.    Somewhat later, too, when I read constantly and with increasing delight  the letters of Madame de S['e]vign['e], I put her second as a writer of  letters to the great St. Paul. The letters of Lord Chesterfield to his  sons came next, I think; long after, Andrew Lang's \"Letters to Dead  Authors,\" and a very great letter I found in an English translation of  Balzac's \"Le Lys dans la Vall['e]e.\"    It must not be understood that I put St. Paul in the same category with  these mundane persons. Nevertheless, I found St. Paul very often  reasonably mundane. He preferred to work as a tentmaker rather than take  money from his clients, and one could imagine him as preaching while he  worked. He frankly made collections for needy churches, and he was very  grateful to Phoebe for remembering that he was a hungry man and in  need of homely hospitality. He was interested in his fellow passengers  Aquilla and Priscilla whom he met on board the ship that was taking them  from Corinth to Ephesus. It was evident that they had not been able to  make their salt in Corinth, where, however, their poverty had not  interfered with their zeal in the cause of Christ. Any tent marked  \"Ephesus\" was sure to have a good sale anywhere. The tents from Ephesus  were as fashionable as the purple from Tyre, and St. Paul was pleased  that his two disciples should have a chance of being more prosperous. I  always felt, too, that, in his practical way, he knew that Ephesus would  give him a better chance of supporting himself.    That Saul of Tarsus had not lacked for luxuries in his youth, one easily  guessed. It was plain, too, that he had had the best possible  instructors, and I liked to believe, when I was young, that his muscles  had been well trained in the sports of gentlemen of his class.  Altogether, so graphic were his descriptions and so potent his  personality that, while Julius Caesar and Brutus receded, he filled the  foreground, and all the more because at this time I picked up an English  translation of Suetonius, just by chance one dark winter day, and as I  had not yet discovered that Suetonius was a \"yellow\" gossip, my idols,  some of the Roman heroes, received a great shock.    The constant reading of St. Paul led me to the Acts of the Apostles, and  I found St. Luke very good reading, though I often wished that, as I  understood he had some reputation as an artist, he had adorned his  writings with illustrations.    It was a great shock to discover that none of the Apostles wrote in  English, for it seemed to me that their styles were as different from  one another as any styles could be, and as I, having lived a great part  of my time in classes where Nepos and Caesar were translated by my dear  young friends, had very little confidence in the work of any translator,  I came to the conclusion that God had taken special care of the  translators of the Bible, for I could not help believing that He had no  interest whatever in the translations which we made daily for the  impatient ears of our instructors!    One could not help loving St. Paul, too, because he was such a good  fighter. When he said he fought with beasts, I was quite sure that these  beasts were the unreasonable and unrighteous persons who persecuted and  contradicted him. No obstacle deterred him, and he was gentle, too,  although he called things by their right names and his denunciations  were so vivid and mouthfilling that you knew his enemies must have been  afraid to open their lips while he was near them, whatever they might  have said behind his back.    My devotion to St. Paul brought me into disrepute one Friday at school  when discipline was relaxed, and the teacher condescended to  conversation. We were asked who was our favourite hero, and when it came  to my turn I answered \"St. Paul.\" As George Washington, Abraham Lincoln,  Thomas Jefferson, General Grant, General Lee, Napoleon, and Alexander  the Great, had walked in procession before I produced my hero, I was  looked on as rather weakminded. The teacher, too, seemed astonished, and  he asked me on what grounds I founded my worship. This question, coming  suddenly, petrified me for a moment, and I answered, \"He fought with  beasts.\" This was taken as a personal allusion by some of my dear  comrades with whom I had had altercations, and I was made to suffer for  it as much as these dear comrades deemed prudent. However, they  discovered that I had \"language\" on my side, for on the next composition  day, when we read aloud the work of our brains, I accused them of \"being  filled with all iniquity,\" and other evil things which brought down a  horrified remonstrance from the teacher, who was unaccustomed to such  plain English, but he was knocked high and dry by the proof that I was  only quoting St. Paul to the Romans.    Perhaps I became too familiar with St. Paul. Be that as it may, I  regarded him as a very good friend indeed, for some of his \"language,\"  quoted in times of crisis, produced a much better effect on one's  enemies than any swear word that could be invented. I am not excusing my  attitude toward the Bible, but merely explaining how it affected my  youthful mind. There was something extremely romantic in the very  phrase, \"the tumult of the silversmiths\" at Ephesus. It seemed to mean a  whole chapter of a novel in itself.    And there was the good centurion--Christ always seemed to have a  sympathy for soldiers--who was willing to save Paul when the ship, on  its way to Rome, was run aground. So he reached Melita where the amiable  barbarians showed him no small courtesy. And one could not help liking  the Romans; that is, the official Romans, even Felix, whose wife was a  Jew like St. Paul, and who, disgusted when the Apostle spoke to him of  chastity and of justice to come, yet hoped that money would be given him  by Paul, and frequently sent for, and often spoke with him. And how fine  seemed the Apostle's belief in his nobility as a Roman citizen! He  rendered unto Caesar the things that were Caesar's. And one could easily  imagine the pomp and circumstance when Agrippa and Bernice entered into  the hall of audience with the tribunes and principal men of the city!  And one could hear St. Paul saying, protecting himself nobly, through  the nobility of a Roman law:         For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not to       signify the things laid to his charge,    and Agrippa's answer, after Paul's apologia:         In a little thou persuadest me to become a Christian!    But the story did not end then. I rehearsed over and over again what the  King Agrippa might have said to his sister, the noble and beautiful  Bernice--I knew nothing of the lady's reputation then--and how finally  they did become Christians. In my imagination, princely dignity and  exquisite grace were added to the external beauty of religion; and Paul  went to Rome protected by the law of the Romans. And yet the very  fineness of his attitude was the cause of his further imprisonment.  \"This man,\" I often repeated with Agrippa, \"might have been set at  liberty, if he had not appealed to Caesar.\"    It was St. Paul who sent me back to the Prophet Micheas, who had  previously struck me as of no importance at all, and I read:         And Thou, Bethlehem Ephrata, art a little one among the thousands       of Juda; out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be the       ruler in Israel; and his going forth is from the beginning, from       the days of eternity.    And back again to St. Matthew--         But they said to him: In Bethlehem of Juda; For so it is written by       the prophet; And thou, Bethlehem, the land of Juda, art not the       least among the princes of Juda; for out of thee shall come forth       the captain, who shall rule my people Israel.    These exercises in completing the prophecies of the Old Testament with  the fulfilments of the New were interesting, and I found great pleasure  in them. And this led me to a greater appreciation of the Old Testament,  against which I had been once rather prejudiced. One day, I was led, by  some reference or other in another book, to read the twenty-third psalm  of David, in the King James version. It struck me as much more simple  and appealing than the version in the Douai Bible, which begins in Latin  \"_Dominus regit me_.\" It runs:         The Lord ruleth me: and I shall want nothing.         2 He hath set me in a place of pasture.         He hath brought me"]]]
