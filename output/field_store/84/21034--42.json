Nor is there any  special cause mentioned for abandoning their dwellings there; probably,  however, a sufficient reason was the cessation of springs in their  vicinity. Traces of former large springs are seen at all of them, but no  water flows from them at the present time. Whatever their motive, the  Bears left Antelope Canyon, and moved over to the village of Walpi,  on the terrace below the point of the mesa. They were received kindly  there, and were apparently placed on an equal footing with the Walpi,  for it seems the Snake, Horn, and Bear have always been on terms of  friendship. They built houses at that village, and lived there for some  considerable time; then they moved a short distance and built again  almost on the very point of the mesa. This change was not caused by any  disagreement with their neighbors; they simply chose that point as a  suitable place on which to build all their houses together. The site of  this Bear house is called Kisákobi, the obliterated house, and the name  is very appropriate, as there is merely the faintest trace here and  there to show where a building stood, the stones having been used in the  construction of the modern Walpi. These two villages were quite close  together, and the subsequent construction of a few additional groups of  rooms almost connected them, so that they were always considered and  spoken of as one.    It was at this period, while Walpi was still on this lower site, that  the Spaniards came into the country. They met with little or no  opposition, and their entrance was marked by no great disturbances.  No special tradition preserves any of the circumstances of this event;  these first coming Spaniards being only spoken of as the \"Kast´ilumuh  who wore iron garments, and came from the south,\" and this brief mention  may be accounted for by the fleeting nature of these early visits.    The zeal of the Spanish priests carried them everywhere throughout their  newly acquired territory, and some time in the seventeenth century a  band of missionary monks found their way to Tusayan. They were  accompanied by a few troops to impress the people with a due regard for  Spanish authority, but to display the milder side of their mission, they  also brought herds of sheep and cattle for distribution. At first these  were herded at various springs within a wide radius around the villages,  and the names still attaching to these places memorize the introduction  of sheep and cattle to this region. The Navajo are first definitely  mentioned in tradition as occupants of this vicinity in connection with  these flocks and herds, in the distribution of which they gave much  undesirable assistance by driving off the larger portion to their own  haunts.    The missionaries selected Awatubi, Walpi, and Shumopavi as the sites for  their mission buildings, and at once, it is said, began to introduce a  system of enforced labor. The memory of the mission period is held in  great detestation, and the onerous toil the priests imposed is still  adverted to as the principal grievance. Heavy pine timbers, many of  which are now pointed out in the kiva roofs, of from 15 to 20 feet in  length and a foot or more in diameter, were cut at the San Francisco  Mountain, and gangs of men were compelled to carry and drag them to the  building sites, where they were used as house beams. This necessitated  prodigious toil, for the distance by trail is a hundred miles, most of  the way over a rough and difficult country. The Spaniards are said to  have employed a few ox teams in this labor, but the heaviest share was  performed by the impressed Hopituh, who were driven in gangs by the  Spanish soldiers, and any who refused to work were confined in a prison  house and starved into submission.    The \"men with the long robes,\" as the missionaries were called, are said  to have lived among these people for a long time, but no trace of their  individuality survives in tradition.    Possibly the Spanish missionaries may have striven to effect some social  improvement among these people, and by the adoption of some harsh  measures incurred the jealous anger of the chiefs. But the system of  labor they enforced was regarded, perhaps justly, as the introduction of  serfdom, such as then prevailed in the larger communities in the Rio  Grande valleys. Perhaps tradition belies them; but there are many  stories of their evil, sensual lives--assertions that they violated  women, and held many of the young girls at their mission houses, not as  pupils, but as concubines.      [Illustration: Plate VI. Adobe fragment in Awatubi.]    In any case, these hapless monks were engaged in a perilous mission in  seeking to supplant the primitive faith of the Tusayan, for among the  native priests they encountered prejudices even as violent as their own.  With too great zeal they prohibited the sacred dances, the votive  offerings to the nature-deities, and similar public observances, and  strove to suppress the secret rites and abolish the religious orders and  societies. But these were too closely incorporated with the system of  gentes and other family kinships to admit of their extinction.  Traditionally, it is said that, following the discontinuance of the  prescribed ceremonies, the favor of the gods was withdrawn, the clouds  brought no rain, and the fields yielded no corn. Such a coincidence in  this arid region is by no means improbable, and according to the  legends, a succession of dry seasons resulting in famine has been of not  infrequent occurrence. The superstitious fears of the people were thus  aroused, and they cherished a mortal hatred of the monks.    In such mood were they in the summer of 1680, when the village Indians  rose in revolt, drove out the Spaniards, and compelled them to retreat  to Mexico. There are some dim traditions of that event still existing  among the Tusayan, and they tell of one of their own race coming from  the river region by the way of Zuñi to obtain their cooperation in the  proposed revolt. To this they consented.    Only a few Spaniards being present at that time, the Tusayan found  courage to vent their enmity in massacre, and every one of the hated  invaders perished on the appointed day. The traditions of the massacre  center on the doom of the monks, for they were regarded as the  embodiment of all that was evil in Spanish rule, and their pursuit,  as they tried to escape among the sand dunes, and the mode of their  slaughter, is told with grim precision; they were all overtaken and  hacked to pieces with stone tomahawks.    It is told that while the monks were still in authority some of the  Snake women urged a withdrawal from Walpi, and, to incite the men to  action, carried their mealing-stones and cooking vessels to the summit  of the mesa, where they desired the men to build new houses, less  accessible to the domineering priests. The men followed them, and two or  three small house groups were built near the southwest end of the  present village, one of them being still occupied by a Snake family, but  the others have been demolished or remodeled. A little farther north,  also on the west edge, the small house clusters there were next built by  the families of two women called Tji-vwó-wati and Si-kya-tcí-wati.  Shortly after the massacre the lower village was entirely abandoned, and  the building material carried above to the point which the Snakes had  chosen, and on which the modern Walpi was constructed. Several beams of  the old mission houses are now pointed out in the roofs of the kivas.    There was a general apprehension that the Spaniards would send a force  to punish them, and the Shumopavi also reconstructed their village in a  stronger position, on a high mesa overlooking its former site. The other  villages were already in secure positions, and all the smaller  agricultural settlements were abandoned at this period, and excepting at  one or two places on the Moen-kopi, the Tusayan have ever since confined  themselves to the close vicinity of their main villages.    The house masses do not appear to bear any relation to division by  phratries. It is surprising that even the social division of the  phratries is preserved. The Hopituh certainly marry within phratries,  and occasionally with the same gens. There is no doubt, however, that in  the earlier villages each gens, and where practicable, the whole of the  phratry, built their houses together. To a certain extent the house of  the priestess of a gens is still regarded as the home of the gens. She  has to be consulted concerning proposed marriages, and has much to say  in other social arrangements.    While the village of the Walpi was still upon the west side of the mesa  point, some of them moved around and built houses beside a spring close  to the east side of the mesa. Soon after this a dispute over planting  ground arose between them and the Sikyátki, whose village was also on  that side of the mesa and but a short distance above them. From this  time forward bad blood lay between the Sikyátki and the Walpi, who took  up the quarrel of their suburb. It also happened about that time, so  tradition says, more of the Coyote people came from the north, and the  Pikyás nyu-mu, the young cornstalk, who were the latest of the Water  people, came in from the south. The Sikyátki, having acquired their  friendship, induced them to build on two mounds, on the summit of the  mesa overlooking their village. They had been greatly harrassed by the  young slingers and archers of Walpi, who would come across to the edge  of the high cliff and assail them with impunity, but the occupation of  these two mounds by friends afforded effectual protection to their  village. These knolls are about 40 yards apart, and about 40 feet above  the level of the mesa which is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19870"],[0,"Illuminated Manuscripts (#6)"],[1,"decoration had become a fashionable  craze. No expense was spared in the search for costly materials. Colours  were imported from India, Persia, and Spain, including vermilion and  ultramarine, while the renowned Byzantine gold ink was manufactured from  imported Indian gold. Persian calligraphers had taught its use afresh to  the Byzantine scribes.    If, as we may believe, the first object of the Roman miniatores was  distinctness combined with beauty, we may now believe that the object of  the Byzantine scribes was splendour. The progress had been from mere  \"cheirography\" to calligraphy; now it was from calligraphy to  chrysography and arguriography.    This employment of gold and silver inks may be looked upon as the first  step in the art of illumination as practised in the Middle Ages. And the  preliminary to the use of metallic inks was attention to the tint of the  vellum. The pioneers in this career of luxury no doubt had observed that  very white vellum fatigued the eye. Hence, at first, they tinted or  stained it with saffron, on one side at least, sometimes on both. Once  begun, the tinting of the vellum extended to other colours. For works of  the highest rank the favourite was a fine purple, the imperial colour of  the Roman and Greek emperors. For chrysography, or gold-writing, the  tint was nearly what we call crimson. For arguriography, or  silver-writing, it became the bluish hue we call grape-purple. On the  cooled purples vermilion ink was used instead of, or together with, the  gold or silver. As the usage began with the Greeks, we may be sure that  it came originally from Asia.    The Emperor Nero, once having heard that an Olympic Ode of Pindar in  letters of gold was laid up in one of the temples at Athens, desired  that certain verses of his own should be similarly written and dedicated  on the Altar of Jupiter Capitolinus at Rome. This was an imperial luxury  several times repeated by other princes.    After the official establishment of Christianity it became a common  practice to have the greater liturgical books executed in the same  costly fashion. And between the time of Constantine and that of Basil  the Macedonian many a burning homily was directed against the custom,  denounced as a sinful extravagance, which no doubt it was, but in vain  until the fashion had worn itself out.    It might fairly be expected, this being the case, that many examples of  this kind of codex would still be in existence. But owing to war, fire,  robbery, and other misfortunes but very few remain. One of the oldest  and finest is the so-called _Codex Argenteus_, or Silver-book, now kept  at Upsala, in Sweden, containing portions of the Gospels of the  Mæsogothic Bishop Ulfilas. Originally the effect of the stamped or  burnished silver on the rich purple of the vellum must have been very  splendid, but now the action of the air has blackened it, as it has done  in many other instances where silver was used in illumination. Even gold  will gather tarnish, and in several such MSS. has turned of a rusty red.  Gold ink was not invariably confined to tinted vellum; it was often used  on the plain ground. The copy of the Old Testament in Greek, presented  by the high priest Eleazar to King Ptolemy Philadelphus, was a roll of  fine white vellum, upon which the text was written in letters of gold.    To enter upon the antiquities of Greek palæography would lead us too far  from our track in view of the brevity of our present survey. We  therefore with some reluctance turn from this interesting topic to our  more immediate subject. We may remark, however, that the great majority  of Greek MSS. are written on vellum. In the eleventh century are found  instances of what is called _charta bombycina_, or cotton-paper,  appearing more plentifully in the twelfth century, but on the whole  vellum is the chief material of Byzantine illuminated books. Much has  been said about the want of life and total lack of variety of treatment  in this school of art. To a very great extent the charge is just, yet it  could scarcely be otherwise. The one circumstance which compelled  Byzantine work to remain so long as if cast in one unalterable mould,  and thus to differ so strangely from that of Western artists, was due to  the fact that in very early Christian times the scribes and illuminators  were enrolled into a minutely organised corporation originating  primarily in monasticism, but by no means confined to the monastic  Orders. Lay guilds existed, the regulations and methods of which were  rigid beyond modern belief. So that, as a class, Byzantine art has  acquired the reputation of a soulless adherence to mechanical rules and  precedents, depriving it of originality and even of individuality, and  therefore excluding the remotest scintilla of artistic genius. Of the  great crowd of examples of ordinary work this may be true, but it  certainly is not true of the best, by which it has the right to be  judged, as we shall see from the examples referred to by-and-by.  Certainly there is one invaluable particular in which Greek MSS. are  superior to those of the West, Latin or otherwise. That is, they are  much more frequently signed with the names, localities, and dates of the  copyists and illuminators.    It will be some help towards our knowledge of this school if we divide  its existence into chronological sections or periods.    1. From præ-Christianity to the Age of Justinian, _i.e._ down to the  year 535. (Justinian reigned from 526 to 564.)    This period marks the decadence of ancient art, but carries with it the  characteristics and methods of the ancient Greek painters.    2. From the Age of Justinian to the Iconoclastic paralysis of art under  Leo III. the Isaurian, _i.e._ 564 to 726. (Leo reigned from 717 to 741.)    During this period vast numbers of illuminated liturgical books were  destroyed for religious or fanatical reasons, just as in our own  Cromwellian times numbers of _Horæ_, Missals, etc., were destroyed as  papistical and superstitious.    This Edict of 726 did not absolutely put an end to all art in MSS. It  only had the effect of excluding images of God, Christ, and the saints,  as in Arabian and Persian MSS., leaving the artist the free use of  flowers, plants, and line ornament, after the manner of the Mohammedan  arabesques.    3. From Leo III. to the Empress Irene, who restored the worship of  images in part, _i.e._ from 741 to 785. (Irene ruled from 780 to 801.)    This was a period of stagnation, though by no means of extinction of  art.    4. From Irene to Basil I. the Macedonian, _i.e._ from 801 to 867.    A half-century and more of rapid renaissance to the most brilliant epoch  of Byzantine art since the time of Justinian, if not the zenith of the  school.    Basil I. was a great builder--building, in fact, was his ruling  passion--so that it may be said that he took Justinian for his model  both as a ruler and as a patron of the arts. (He reigned from 867 to  886.)    5. From Basil the Macedonian to the Fall of Constantinople, _i.e._ from  886 to 1453.    Allowing for a few flashes of expiring skill in various reigns, this may  be considered as a period of gradual but certain decline to a state  worse than death, for though the monks of Greek and Russian convents  still kept up the execution of MSS., it was only with the driest and  most lifeless adhesion to the Manual. This so-called art still exists,  but more like a magnetised corpse than a living thing.    Examples of the first period are seldom met with. We have one signal  specimen in the British Museum Add. MS. 5111, being two leaves only of a  Gospel-book, and containing part of the Eusebian canons, or  contents-tables of the Four Gospels, etc. The work is attributed to the  time of Justinian himself. It is of the kind already referred to as  probably affording the model of work to the early illuminators of France  and Ireland, and as being like the Gospel-book of Hormisdas and those  brought to England by Augustine in 596. Another example of the same  Eusebian canons is found in Roy. MS. 1 E. vi.    Of the fourth period--_i.e._ the ninth century--perhaps the most typical  example is the Menologium (a sort of compound of a calendar and lives of  the saints), now in the Vatican Library (MS. Gr. 1613). This MS. shows  that the revival under Basil the Macedonian was a return not to Roman,  but to ancient Greek art, the facial types being of the purest classical  character.    [Illustration:  EVANG. GRÆCA  6TH CENT.  _Brit. Mus. Add. MS. 5111, fol. 13_]    [Illustration:  EVANG. GRÆCA  9TH CENT.  _Brit. Mus. Burney MS. 19 fol. 1 v._]    In some of them we see the horizontal frown of the Homeric heroes  ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH  TONOS~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK  SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER  UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER  OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER  UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK  SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER  FINAL SIGMA~}), and of the Georgian and Armenian races shown in the  features of the Emperor Johannes Ducas. We have, too, the large Hera-  like eye with its mystic gaze, which, in later Byzantine work, becomes  first a gaze of lofty indifference, as in the portraits of the emperors  and empresses, and lastly a stony and expressionless stare; still, if  possible, more stony and glaring when transferred to Celtic and  Carolingian Gospel-books. (See chapter on Carolingian Illumination.)    Of this fourth period we might indeed point to many examples. One must  suffice. It is the beautiful Greek Psalter, now at Paris (MS., p. 139),  containing lovely examples of antique design, including remarkable  personifications or allegorical figures. In this MS. is one of the"]]]
