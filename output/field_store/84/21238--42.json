Feel better?\"    \"Dan, please, sir.  My mates never put any `yel' at the end of my name.\"    \"That isn't the end,\" said Mark sharply.  \"That's the middle.  Well, do  you feel better?\"    \"Feel better, sir?\" said the man, whose miserably pallid face was  overspread for the moment by a warm glow, while the tears of gratitude  stood in his eyes.  \"Why, every morning since we came up I have seemed  to be coming to life again.\"    \"Well, don't cry about it,\" said Mark shortly.    \"Oh, that's nothing, sir,\" said the man, using the back of both fists to  brush away the signs of his emotion.  \"That's only being so weak, sir.  Don't you take any notice of that.  You see, I have been going backwards  and getting quite like a kid again.  And oh, gentlemen, it was a lucky  day for me when I run against you two.\"    \"Stop!\" cried Mark angrily.  \"This is the third time you have begun  talking to us like this, and we won't stand it; will we, Dean?\"    \"No, that we won't,\" cried his cousin.  \"Here, Daniel--Dan, I mean--\"    \"Thank you, sir.  That's better.\"    \"You wait a bit.  I had not finished,\" continued Mark.  \"If ever you say  another word to us, whether we are together or whether we are alone,  about being grateful, and that sort of thing, I shall say you are a  canting humbug--at least, my cousin will; I shouldn't like to be so  harsh.\"    Dean dug his elbow into his cousin's ribs at this.    \"And we don't want to think that of you,\" continued Mark.  \"I say,  though, you do look a lot better.\"    \"I am, sir,\" said the man, smiling.  \"And now we have got up here, sir,  I want you to ask Sir James and the doctor to set me to work.\"    \"Why, you are too weak yet.\"    \"Weak, sir?  Not so weak as that.  'Sides, doing a bit of hauling or  something of that kind will help to get me in sailing trim once more.  Why, arter all these long weeks lying by and feeling that I should never  be a man again--why, the very sound of doing something sets one  longing.\"    \"Well, you go on getting better.\"    \"Better, sir!  I am better,\" cried the man sharply.  \"I know I don't  look thin and like a fellow on the sick list, but the time I overhauled  you down there at the port I felt like a walking shadder.\"    \"Ah, that's the doctor's physic,\" said Dean.    \"Physic, sir?  Why, he never give me none--nothing but some white  stuff--ten drips as he let drop carefully out of a little bottle.  No,  sir, it warn't that, but getting up here where one could breathe, and  now instead of lying awake in the dark with the mysture running off  one's face in drops, I just put my head down of a night feeling the cold  air blowing over one, and the next minute I am fast asleep.\"    \"Yes, one can sleep here,\" said Mark, \"sound as a top.\"    \"Yes, sir; same here, sir.  Oh, I shall be all right in a day or two,  sir, if I can get to work.  I don't hold with hanging about with them  two men of yourn looking at me as if I warn't worth my salt.\"    \"Do they?\" said Mark sharply.    \"Well, perhaps it arn't that, sir, but that's what I feel.\"    \"But look here,\" cried Mark; \"aren't they civil to you?  Because we are  not going to stand that; are we, Dean?\"    \"Certainly not.\"    \"Beg pardon, sir; please don't you go a-thinking that I'm a-finding  fault.\"    \"You look here,\" said Mark.  \"If they--\"    \"Oh, I beg your pardon, sir,\" said the man.  \"You see, it's like this;  you picked me up, quite a stranger, and it's quite nat'ral that they  shouldn't like a chap on the sick list stuck along with them all at  once.\"    \"It's no business of theirs,\" said Mark shortly.  \"They have come out  here with us to do their duty; and just now it's their duty to do what's  right by you, and if my father or the doctor knew that--what?\"    \"Well, sir, I daresay I'm wrong, but I've got it into my head that one  of them feels a bit jealous like that I'm going to step into his shoes  and that he'll be dismissed his ship.\"    \"Pshaw!\" ejaculated Mark angrily.  \"He has no right to think anything of  the kind.  You three have got to work together and be like messmates, as  you sailors call it.\"    \"That's right, sir; messmates is the word; but--\" The man stopped.    \"Well, out with it,\" said Mark.  \"What were you going to say?\"    \"Well, sir,\" said the man, hesitating, and he turned now to look half  appealingly at Dean, \"you see, sir, I am a bit weak still in the head.\"    \"Of course you are!  Then go on getting strong.\"    \"Thankye, sir; that's what I am doing,\" said the man; \"but I can't help  every now and then thinking that all this 'ere is too good to be true,  and that as soon as Sir James and the doctor thinks that I'm all right  again they will say, `There, my lad, you are about fit to shift for  yourself, and you can go.'\"    \"Oh, I see,\" said Mark sarcastically.    \"Yes, sir, that's it,\" said the man, with a sigh.    \"Now, let's see,\" said Mark, and he gave his cousin a peculiar look; \"I  suppose, fairly speaking, it will take about a month before you are  quite right again.\"    \"Bless your heart, sir, not it!  Fortnight, more likely; I should say  about a week.\"    \"Well, I hope that in a month's time--for that's what I'll give you; eh,  Dean?\"    \"Oh, quite,\" said his cousin decisively.    \"Well, I will put it at three weeks,\" said Mark, \"and by that time I  hope we shall be a couple of hundred miles farther up the country, with  the ponies and the waggons and the teams of oxen all with us in  travelling trim, right away in the wild country, where there's no  settlement--not a house--nothing but here and there one of the blacks'  camps--kraals, as they call them; eh, Dean?\"    \"Yes, that's right.\"    \"Well, then, at the end of that time--oh, I shall make it a month--\"    The man drew a deep breath.    \"And then my father will have a quiet chat with the doctor and take his  opinion.  He always goes by Dr Robertson's opinion, doesn't he, Dean?\"    \"Always,\" said his cousin.    \"And then he'll what slang people call sack you.  You sailors don't say  sack, do you?\"    \"No, sir,\" said the man sadly.  \"When I was in the Royal Navy we used to  call it being paid off.\"    \"Well, it doesn't matter,\" said Mark.  \"Then of course when we are  hundreds of miles from everywhere my father will pay you off.\"    \"Oh, no, sir,\" said the man earnestly, \"I don't expect no pay.\"    \"Never mind what you expect.  My father, I say, will tell you to be off  and shift for yourself and get back to that moist oven of a port the  best way you can.  Won't he, Dean?\"    Dean caught his cousin's eye, and said decisively, \"Yes, of course.  That's just like uncle;\" and by means of an effort he kept his face  straight, looking, as Mark afterwards told him, like a badly carved  piece of solid mahogany.    \"Yes, sir,\" said the man sadly; \"and I daresay I shall be able to steer  my way right enough, and for all his kindness I shall be very thankful,  and--\"    \"Yah!\" shouted Mark.  \"Didn't I tell you that if ever you spoke again  like that I'd--I'd--\"    \"I beg your pardon, sir.\"    \"This chap's very weak still in his head, Dean, or else he would not  dare to think that an English gentleman would behave like a cad.  There,  man Dan--no, I mean Dan Mann--just make up your mind that you are in for  this trip with all its troubles and hard work.\"    \"Do you mean it, sir?\" cried the man, and he looked from one to the  other.    \"Mean it?  Why, of course we do.  So never say anything about it again.  Ah, here come father and the doctor.  Would you like to ask them if what  we say is true?\"    \"Not now, sir,\" said the man.  \"I am a bit weak still, more shaky than I  thought.\"    The poor fellow's voice sounded very husky during the last few words,  and he hurried away, watched by the boys.    \"I say, Dean, he's better,\" said Mark.  \"He could not walk like that a  fortnight ago.  Do you know, I begin to like that chap.  He's rather  comic looking, but he is such a regular sailor.\"    \"Yes,\" said Dean, \"with quite a sailor's frank boyish sort of way.\"    \"Like you, eh?\" said Mark.    \"Get out!  Don't chaff.  Present company always excepted.  I wasn't  thinking about you.  But I say, didn't he take it all in as innocent as  could be about uncle setting him adrift out in the wilds?\"    \"Yes.--Well, father, how many bullocks have you bought?\"    \"Forty-eight, my boy.  Fine ones.\"    \"Forty-eight!\" cried the boys, in a breath.  \"Twenty-four in a span.\"    \"Precious long span, uncle,\" said Dean, laughing, as he stretched from  thumb tip to little finger measuring along his arm.    \"Yes, rather,\" said the doctor.  \"They are long spans; but we are  obliged to provide against loss.  Like to come and see them, boys?\"    \"Of course!\" they cried, in a breath.        CHAPTER SIX.    HOW TO HANDLE A WHIP.    Sir James turned back with the doctor, and soon after the boys were  intently examining the drove of nearly fifty beautiful, sleek, well-bred  oxen in their kraal, where they were in charge of their drivers, one a  big, bluff, manly-looking fellow, well bronzed by the sun, and with  Englishman stamped upon every feature, forming a striking contrast to  his companion, a flat-nosed, half-bred Hottentot, who grinned at them  stupidly.    \"We just want another look round, my lad,\" said the doctor.    \"All right, sir,\" said the big driver, endorsing his appearance by his  speech; and taking the lead, he showed the little party and expatiated  upon the qualities of the leading and pole oxen, upon how sleek and well  they looked, and gave to each its name, while the Hottentot driver, who  confined himself to Dutch, helped to call up bullock after bullock, all  of which answered sluggishly to their names.    Then the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2393"],[0,"His Dog (#6)"],[1,"arms about the dog's furry neck  and kiss him. But he  steadied himself and chirped to the collie to  come nearer. Slowly, with queer reluctance, Chum obeyed.    \"Listen,\" mumbled Link incoherently, \"I saved you from dying from a  bust leg and hunger the night I fust met you, Chummie. An' tonight you  squared the bill by saving me from drownin'. But I'm still a whole lot  in your debt, friend. I owe you for all the cash in my pocket an'--an'  for a pint of the Stuff that Killed Father--an'--an' maybe for a  beatin' that might of killed me. Chum, I guess God did a real day's  work when He built you. I--I--Let it go at that. Only I ain't  forgettin'. Nor yet I ain't li'ble to forget. Come on home. I'm  a-gittin' the chatters!\"    He had been stroking the oddly unresponsive dog's head as he spoke.  Now, for the first time, Link realized that the night was cool, that  his drenched clothes were like ice on him, and that the cold and the  shock reaction were giving him a sharp congestive chill. Walking fast  to restore circulation to his numbed body he made off for his distant  farmhouse, Chum pattering along at his heels.    The rapid walk set him into a glow. But by the time he had reached home  and had stripped off his wet clothes and swathed himself in a rough  blanket, his racked nerves reasserted themselves. He craved a drink--a  number of drinks--to restore his wonted poise. Lighting the kitchen  lamp, he set the whisky bottle on the table and put a thick tumbler  alongside it. Chum was lying at his master's feet. In front of Ferris  was a pint of good cheer. The lamplight made the kitchen bright and  cozy. Link felt a sense of utter well-being pervade him.    This was home--this was the real thing. Three successive and man-size  drinks of whisky presently made it seem more and more the real thing.  They made all things seem possible, and most things highly desirable.  Link wanted to sing. And after two additional drinks he gratified this  taste by lifting his voice in a hiccup-punctuated ditty addressed to  one Jenny, whom the singer exhorted to wait till the clouds rolled by.    He was following this appeal by a rural lyric which recited in somewhat  wearisome tonal monotony the adventures of a Little Black Bull that  came Over the Mountain, when he observed that Chum was no longer lying  at his feet. Indeed, the dog was in a far corner of the room, pressed  close to the closed outer door, and with crest and ruff a-droop.    Puzzled by his pet's defection, Link imperiously commanded Chum to  return to his former place. The collie, in most unwilling obedience,  turned about and came slowly toward the drinker.    Every line of Chum's splendid body told of reluctance to approach his  master. The deep-set, dark eyes were eloquent of a frightened disgust.  He looked at Ferris as at some loathely stranger. The glad light of  loyalty, which always had transfigured his visage when Link called to  him, was woefully lacking. Drunk as he was Ferris could not help  noticing the change. And he marveled at it.    \"Whasser matter?\" he demanded truculently. \"What ails yer? C'm here,  I'm tellin' you!\"    He stretched out his hand in rough caress to the slowly approaching  collie. Chum shrank back from the touch as a child from a dose of  castor oil. There was no fear now in his aspect. Only disgust and a  poignant unhappiness.    And, all suddenly, Link Ferris understood.    He himself did not know how the knowledge came to him. A canine  psychologist might perhaps have told him that there is always an occult  telepathy between the mind of a thoroughbred dog and its master, a  power which gives them a glimpse into each other's processes of  thought. But there was no such psychologist there to explain the thing.  Nor did Link need it explained. It was enough for him that he knew.    He knew, as by revelation, that his adoring dog now shunned him because  Link was drunk.    From the first, Chum's look of utter worship and his eagerly happy  obedience had been a joy to Link. The subtly complete change in his  worshiper's demeanor jarred sharply on the man's raw nerves. He felt  vaguely unclean--shamed.    The contempt of such of his pious human neighbors as had passed him in  the road during his sprees had affected Link not at all. Nor now could  he understand the queer feeling of humiliation that swept over him at  sight of the horrified repugnance in the eyes of this mere brute beast.  It roused him to a gust of hot vexation.    \"Shamed of me, are you?\" he grunted fiercely. \"A dirty four-legged  critter's 'shamed of a he-man, hey? Well, we'll lick that out of you,  dam' soon!\"    Lurching to his feet, he snatched up a broom handle. He waved it  menacingly over the dog. Chum gave back not an inch. Under the threat  of a beating he stood his ground, his brave eyes steadfast, and,  lurking in their mystic depths, that same glint of sorrowful wonder and  disgust.    Up whirled the broomstick. But when it fell it did not smite athwart  the shoulders of the sorrowing dog. Instead, it clattered harmlessly to  the board floor. And to the floor also slumped Link Ferris, his nerve  all gone, his heart soggy with sudden remorse.    To his knees thudded the man, close beside the collie. From Link's  throat were bursting great strangled sobs which tortured his whole body  and made his speech a tangled jumble that was not pretty to hear.    \"Chum!\" he wailed brokenly, clutching the dog's huge ruff in both shaky  hands. \"Chum, old friend! Gawd forgive me! You saved me from drowndin'  an' from goin' broke, this night! You been the only friend that ever  cared a hang if I was alive or dead! An'--an' I was goin' to lick you!  I was goin' to lambaste you. Because I was a beastlier beast than YOU  be. I was goin' to do it because you was so much better than me that  you was made sick by my bein' a hawg. An' I was mad at you fer it.  I'm--oh, I'm shameder than you are! Chum! Honest to Gawd, I am! Won't  you make friends again? PLEASE, Chum!\"    Now, of course, this was a most ridiculous and maudlin way to talk.  Moreover, no man belongs on his knees beside a dog, even though the man  be a sot and the dog a thoroughbred. In his calmer moments  Link Ferris  would have known this. A high-bred collie, too, has no use for sloppy  emotion, but shuns its exhibition well-nigh as disgustedly as he shuns  a drunkard.    Yet, for some illogical reason, Chum did not seek to withdraw his  aristocratic self from the shivering clutch of the repentant souse.  Instead, the expression of misery  and repugnance fled as if by magic  from his brooding eyes. Into them in its place leaped a light of keen  solicitude. He pressed closer to the swayingly kneeling  man, and with  upthrust muzzle sought to kiss the blubbering face.    The whisky reek was as strong as ever. But something in Chum's soul was  stronger. He seemed to know that the maudlin Unknown had vanished, and  that his dear master was back again--his dear master who was in  grievous trouble and who must be comforted.    Wherefore, the sickening liquor fumes no longer held him aloof from  Link. Just as the icy lake had not deterred him from springing into the  water after his drowning god, although, like most collies, Chum hated  to swim.    Link, through his own nervous collapse, recognized the instant change  in Chum's demeanor, and read it aright. It strengthened the old bond  between himself and the dog. It somehow gave him a less scornful  opinion of himself.    Presently he got to his feet, and with the collie at his side went back  to the table, where stood the threeparts-empty flask. His face working,  Link opened the window and poured what was left of the whisky out on  the ground. There was nothing dramatic about his action. Rather it was  tinged by very visible regret. Turning back to Chum, he said sheepishly:    \"There it goes. An' I ain't sayin' I'm tickled at wastin' such good  stuff. But--somehow I guess we've come to a showdown, Chum; you an' me.  If I stick to booze, I'm li'ble to see you looking at me that queer way  an' sidlin' away from me all the time; till maybe at last you'd get  plumb sick of me for keeps, an' light out. An'--I'd rather have YOU  than the booze, since I can't have both of you. Bein' only a dawg and  never havin' tasted good red liquor, you can't know what a big bouquet  I'm a-throwin' at you when I say that, neither. I--Oh, let's call it a  day and go to sleep.\"      Next morning, in the course of nature, Link Ferris worked with a  splitting headache. He carried it and a bad taste in his mouth, for the  best part of the day.    But it was the last drink headache which marred his labor, all that  long and happy summer. His work showed the results of the change. So  did the meager hill farm. So did Link's system and his pocketbook.    As he was a real, live human and not a temperance tract hero, there  were times when he girded bitterly at his self-enforced abstinence.  Where were times, too--when he had a touch of malaria and again when  the cutworms slaughtered two rows of his early tomatoes--when he  yearned unspeakably for the solace of an evening at the Hampton tavern.    He had never been a natural drinker. Like many a better man he had  drunk less for what he sought to get than for what he sought to forget.  And with the departure of loneliness and the new interest in his home,  he felt less the need for wet conviviality and for drugging his fits of  melancholy.    The memory of Chum's grieving repulsion somehow stuck in Ferris's mind.  And it served as a brake, more than once, to his tavernward impulses.  Two or three times, also, when Link's babyish gusts of destructive bad  temper boiled to the surface at some setback or annoyance, much the  same wonderingly distressed look would creep into the collie's  glance--a look as of one who is revolted by a dear friend's failure to  play up to form. And to his own amused surprise, Ferris found himself  trying"]]]
