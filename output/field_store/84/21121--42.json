The camel was not an attractive creature, for, in addition to its  natural peculiarities of shape, it was the time of year for shedding its  long hairy coat, and this was hanging in ragged ungainly locks and  flakes all along its flanks and about its loping, unhealthy-looking  hump.    This was something to look at, and the excited boys shouted, cheered,  and gave forth remark after remark such as must have been painful to the  dignity of the melancholy-looking beast, which kept on turning its  half-closed, plaintive-looking eyes at the noisy groups, wincing and  seeming to protest against the unkindly and insulting remarks.    \"Oh, I say, isn't he a beauty?\" cried one.    \"Yes; it's just like a four-legged bird,\" shouted another.    \"That's right.  They've caught Sindbad's roc and clipped his wings.\"    \"Cut them right off,\" said Glyn laughingly, joining in the mirth.  \"Poor  fellow, look how he's moulting!\"    There was a burst of laughter at this, and as it ceased another boy  shouted:    \"Ought its hump to wobble like that, and hang over all on one side?\"    \"That isn't its hump,\" cried Burney; \"that's its cistern in which it  carries its drinking-water.  Don't you know they can go for days without  wanting any more?  Can't you see it's empty now?\"    \"Poor camel!\" said one of the boys.    \"Yes, poor, and no mistake!  Why, it's all in rags,\" cried Burney, and  the unhappy-looking beast went mincing on, to be followed by another van  labelled \"Birds.\"  Then came one labelled ominously and in very large  letters, \"Serpents;\" those next in succession containing antelopes,  nylghaus, crocodiles, eagles, rhinoceroses, zebras, monkeys,  orang-outangs, chimpanzees, rib-nosed baboons, and so on, and so on,  cage after cage, den after den, a procession of so many painted yellow  vans drawn by very unsatisfactory-looking horses, till, as the last one  came into sight far on the right, it was observed by the boys as they  stood leaning their elbows on the wall that there was something special  being kept for the finale, for the crowd was closing in behind and  coming on surrounding this last van.    \"Oh, I shall be so glad when it's all over,\" said Singh.  \"I would have  said let's go away ever so long ago, only the Doctor might think it  disagreeable after he had given us leave to see.\"    \"Yes, it would have looked bad,\" replied Glyn.  \"It seems to me such a  shame,\" he continued, \"getting us all here to see a procession of wild  beasts, and all we have seen is a camel.\"    \"But don't you see--\" began Singh.    \"Of course; I said so.  I have seen a camel.  But if the man let the  people see all his wild beasts they wouldn't pay to go into his show.\"    \"Oh,\" cried Singh, \"that's it.  I never thought of that.  Of course.  But what are the people all crowding up for behind that last van?\"    \"Because it's the end,\" said the small boy who had spoken before.    \"No; but there's something they can see, for they are all pressing close  up, and the boys are stooping down to look underneath.\"    \"Yes, and there's a man with a whip trying to keep them back.\"    That was all plain enough to view as the great van, drawn by four stout  cart-horses, came nearer, with the whip-armed carter who walked by their  side varying his position to cross round by the back, making-believe to  use his whip and keep the boys from getting too close.    \"Well, they can see something,\" said Glyn, as the great vehicle came  nearly abreast; and as it did the lad gripped his companion by the  shoulder.    \"Look, look!\" he cried.  \"My word, it is queer!\"    \"What is?\" said Singh excitedly.    \"Two pairs of giants' trousers walking underneath the van.  There, can't  you see?  Oh, isn't it comic.  And they don't fit.\"    \"Nonsense,\" cried Singh excitedly.  \"It's a big elephant underneath  there, and he's so heavy he has broken through the bottom of the wagon.\"    It certainly gave a stranger that impression; but the young Indian was  not right.  It was only the showman's ingenious device to convey his  huge attraction from town to town unseen save just so much as would whet  the spectator's curiosity and make him wish to see more.    \"Dear me,\" said a rich, unctuous voice just behind the lads; and the  boys started round at the familiar tones, to see the benignant-looking  Doctor blinking through his gold-rimmed spectacles and commenting upon  the spectacle for the benefit of his younger pupils.  \"You see, my dear  lads,\" he began, \"a monstrous animal like that must weigh tons, and  would be too heavy for the horses to--\"    The Doctor's words were drowned by the roar of laughter that arose from  behind the wall, for Glyn's comment had been taken up quickly, and ran  from end to end of the line, with the result that, like a chorus  dominating their laughter, the boys joined in one insane shout of:    \"Trousers! trousers!\"    The next moment it was over the wall and running through the crowd, who  caught it up and began to yell out the name of the familiar object of  attire, staid elderly men holding their sides and laughing, boys  shrieking with delight and pointing under the van at the two pairs of  huge pillar-like legs with the loose skin hanging about them like some  specimen of giant frieze, till, as the van moved on, the driver grew  frantic and began to smack his whip; while, to add to the tumult, there  arose from within a peculiar hoarse trumpeting roar that can only be put  into print by the words: _Phoomp! phoomp! phoomp_!    \"Ha!\" cried Singh excitedly, and he gripped at Glyn's arm so sharply  that he made him wince.  \"Hark at him!  Hark at him!\" he whispered  hoarsely in the boy's ear.  \"The jungle! the jungle!  Why, it must be a  big bull elephant.  Oh, we must go and see him to-night!\"    Singh saw him the next minute; for, startled by the terrific roar behind  them, and probably knowing well the power of the utterer, the four  draught horses began to suffer from panic.  One began to rear and  plunge, and before the driver, who was close to the hind wheels, could  force his way through the crowd and seize its rein, it made a dash for  the sidewalk farthest from the Doctor's wall.  Like gregarious beasts,  its companions went with it; the front of the van was wrenched round and  the off fore-wheel ascended the path, while at the same moment, as the  furious trumpeting continued, there was a crash, one side of the van was  heaved up as if by an internal earthquake, and the next moment, amidst  the noise of splintering wood, the plunging of horses, and the  elephant's deafening roar, the great yellow vehicle lay over on its  side, and the monstrous beast, fully ten feet high, stood panting and  trumpeting with uplifted trunk by the side of the ruins, glaring round  as if seeking which enemy to charge.        CHAPTER FIVE.    AN AL-FRESCO LUNCH.    There were plenty of those whom the great beast looked upon as foes  lying prostrate, for with yells of dismay the crowd dashed off  helter-skelter, trampling each other down in their efforts to escape,  clearing the way as rapidly as they could; but the only object that  offered itself for attack was one of the big van horses, which had swung  round in the alarm, to stand right in the elephant's way.    And now, flapping its ears, giving its miserable little tail a twist in  the air, and uttering a pig-like squeak, the elephant charged, catching  the horse in the ribs and knocking it over on to its side; and then,  without stopping to trample upon the poor animal, the monster indulged  in a peculiar caper resembling a triumphant war-dance, a movement which  but for the suggestion of danger would have been comical in the extreme.  Then, stopping short as if to make a survey of its position with its  piercing eyes, the elephant looked at the ruined van, then at the villa  residences opposite the Doctor's great mansion, then at the blank wall  (which seemed to puzzle it, with what looked like a palisade of boys'  heads), and next up the road.    At last, turning sharply round to point with uplifted trunk down the  road in the direction from which it had come, it went off in its curious  shuffling shamble as if in pursuit of the flying crowd; while, now in a  state of the greatest excitement, about a score of the wild-beast  van-drivers, headed by the man who had the elephant in charge, cracking  his whip and shouting for it to come back, started in pursuit.    The Doctor's pupils, evidently feeling that they were safe behind the  wall, for the elephant displayed no intention of using his trunk to pick  their heads as if they were gigantic cherries, all stood fast, most  probably too much startled to stir; and having an excellent view of this  unexpected episode in the procession, had the satisfaction of seeing the  principal actor trotting away the whole length of the playground wall,  his hind-quarters looking more than ever like an enormous pair of  ill-made, ill-fitting trousers.    \"Will he catch them--overtake any of them?\" cried Glyn, as the elephant  passed the spot where he and Singh were watching the proceedings, the  latter with his dark eyes glittering and nostrils quivering, as the  whole business brought back something he had once seen in his native  state.

You tie his ankles, one each side,  tightly to the ladder, and one of you bind his arms same way to the  ladder sides.  Cut the rope.  Mr Christmas will not mind.\"    The men grinned, and set to work so handily that in a few moments Mike  was securely bound.    \"Now then,\" said the constable, \"I'll have one round his middle; give me  a piece of rope; I'll soon do that.\"    He seized the rope, and, without rising, rapidly secured it to one side  of the ladder.    \"Now,\" he said, \"raise that end.\"    This was done, the rope passed under Mike, drawn up on the other side,  hauled upon till Mike yelled for mercy, and then knotted twice.    \"There, my lads,\" said the constable, rising; \"now turn him over.\"    The ladder was seized, turned, and there lay Mike on his back, safely  secured.    \"Here, undo these,\" he said, sullenly.  \"I'll walk.\"    \"Too late, Mike, my boy.  Now then, a couple of men head and tail.  Let  the ladder hang at arm's length.  Best have given in quietly, and not  have made yourself a show, Mike.\"    \"Don't I tell you I'll walk?\" growled the prisoner.  \"And let us have  all our trouble for nothing?  No, my lad, it's too late.  Ready there!  Up with him.  Good morning, sir.  March!\"    The men lent themselves eagerly to the task, for Mike was thoroughly  disliked; and a few minutes later there was a crowd gathering and  following Mike Bannock as he was borne off, spread-eagled and half  tipsy, to ponder on the theft and his chances in the cold damp place  known in Bristol as the lock-up.    Don Lavington stood in the office, waiting for his uncle to speak.        CHAPTER FIVE.    A STUBBORN DISPOSITION.    \"Stop!\"    Don had taken his hat, and, seeing his uncle apparently immersed in a  letter, was about to yield to his curiosity and follow the constable,  when, as he reached the door, his uncle's word thundered out and made  him turn and go on with his writing in response to a severe look and a  pointing finger.    From time to time the boy looked up furtively as he sat, and wondered  why his uncle did not say anything more about the money.    But the time glided on, and the struggle between his desire to speak out  frankly and his indignant wounded pride continued.    A dozen times over he was on the point of crossing to the stern-looking  old man, and begging him to listen and believe, but Uncle Josiah sat  there with the most uncompromising of expressions on his face, and Don  dared not speak.  He dared not trust himself for very shame, as the  incident had so upset him, that he felt sure that he must break down and  cry like a child if he attempted to explain.    After a time there was the sound of voices talking and laughing, and the  click of the heavy latch of the gate.  Then through the open windows  came the deep _burr burr_ of Jem's bass, and the shrill inquiring tones  of Sally Wimble, as she eagerly questioned her lord.    Then there were steps, some of which passed the office door; and Don, as  he sat with his head bent over a ledger, knew exactly whose steps those  were, and where the makers of those steps were going to the different  warehouses in the great yard.    Directly after Jem's foot was heard, and he tapped at the door, pushed  it a little way, and waited.    \"Come in,\" said Uncle Josiah, sharply.    Jem entered, doffing his cocked hat, and casting a sympathising look at  Don, who raised his head.  Then seeing that his employer was deeply  immersed in the letter he was writing, Jem made a series of  gesticulations with his hat, supplemented by some exceedingly queer  grimaces, all meant as a kind of silent language, which was very  expressive, but quite incomprehensible to Don.    \"Well?\" said Uncle Josiah, sharply.    \"Beg pardon, sir!  Thought you'd like to hear how we got on?\"    \"Well?\"    \"Went pretty quiet, sir, till we got about half-way there, and then he  begun kicking like mad--leastways he didn't kick, because his legs was  tied, but he let go all he could, and it was hard work to hold the  ladder.\"    \"And he is now safely locked up?\"    \"Yes, sir, and I've been thinking, sir, as he must have took that money  when Master Don here was up in the warehouse along o' me.\"    \"I daresay we shall find all out by-and-by, Wimble,\" said the old  merchant, coldly.  \"That will do, now.\"    Jem looked uneasily at Don, as he turned his hat round to make sure  which was the right way on, and moved slowly toward the door.    \"Which, begging your pardon, sir, you don't think now as--\"    \"Well?\" said the old merchant, sharply, for Jem had stopped.    \"Think as Mrs Wimble picked up any of the money, sir?\"    \"No, no, my man, of course not.\"    \"Thankye, sir, I'm glad of that; and if I might make so bold, sir, about  Master Don--\"    \"What do you wish to say, man?\"    \"Oh, nothing, sir, only I'm quite sure, sir, as it was all Mike  Bannock's doing, and--\"    \"I think you had better go on with your work, Wimble, which you do  understand, and not meddle with things that are beyond you.\"    \"Certainly, sir, certainly,\" said Jem, quickly.  \"Just going, sir;\" and  giving Don a sympathetic look, he hurried out, but had hardly closed the  door before he opened it again.    \"Beg pardon, sir, Mrs Lavington, sir, and Miss Kitty.\"    Don started from his stool, crimson with mortification.  His mother!  What would Uncle Josiah say?    Jem Wimble gave Don another look full of condolence before he closed the  door, leaving Mrs Lavington and her niece in the office.    Mrs Lavington's face was full of anxiety and care, as she glanced from  her son to her brother and back again, while Kitty's was as full of  indignant reproof as she darted an angry look at Don, and then frowned  and looked straight down at the floor.    \"Well?\" said the old merchant, coldly, \"why have you come?  You know I  do not like you to bring Kitty here to the business place.\"    \"I--I heard--\" faltered Mrs Lavington, who stood in great awe of her  brother when he was in one of his stern moods.    \"Heard?  Well, what did you hear?\"    \"Such terrible news, Josiah.\"    \"Well, well, what?\"    \"Oh, my brother!\" she exclaimed, wildly, as she stepped forward and  caught his hand, \"tell me it is not true.\"    \"How can I tell you what is not true when I don't know what you are  talking about,\" cried the old man, impatiently.  \"My dear Laura, do you  think I have not worries enough without your coming here?\"    \"Yes, yes; I know, dear.\"    \"And you ought to know that I shall do what is just and right.\"    \"I am sure of that, Josiah, but I felt obliged to come.  Kitty and I  were out shopping, and we met a crowd.\"    \"Then you should have turned down a side street.\"    \"But they were your men in the midst, and directly after I saw little  Sally Wimble following.\"    \"Oh, she was, was she?\" cried the old man, glad of some one on whom to  vent his spleen.  \"That woman goes.  How dare she leave the gates when  her husband is out?  I shall be having the place robbed again.\"    \"Yes, that is what she said, Josiah--that you had been robbed, and that  Don--my boy--oh, no, no, no; say it is not true.\"    Mrs Lavington looked wildly from one to the other, but there was a dead  silence, and in a few minutes the poor woman's manner had entirely  changed.  When she first spoke it was as the timid, shrinking,  affectionate woman; now it was as the mother speaking in defence of her  child.    \"I say it is not true,\" she cried.  \"You undertook to be a father to my  poor boy, and now you charge him with having robbed you.\"    \"Laura, be calm,\" said the old merchant, quietly; \"and you had better  take Kitty back home and wait.\"    \"You have always been too stern and harsh with the poor boy,\" continued  Mrs Lavington, without heeding him.  \"I was foolish ever to come and  trust to you.  How dare you charge him with such a crime?\"    \"I did not charge him with any crime, my dear Laura,\" said the old  merchant, gravely.    \"Then it is not true?\"    \"It is true that I have been robbed, and that the man whom Lindon has  persisted in making his companion, in spite of all I have said to the  contrary, has charged him with the base, contemptible crime of robbing  the master who trusted him.\"    \"But it is not true, Josiah; and that is what you always do, treat my  poor boy as if he were your servant instead of your nephew--your  sister's boy.\"    \"I treat Lindon as if he were my son when we are at home,\" said the old  man, quietly.  \"When we are here at the office I treat him as my clerk,  and I trust him to look after my interests, and to defend me from  dishonest people.\"    Don looked up, and it was on his lips to say, \"Indeed, uncle, I always  have done so,\" when the old man's next words seemed to chill and harden  him.    \"But instead of doing his duty by me, I have constantly had to reprove  him for making a companion of a man whom I weakly, and against my better  judgment, allowed in the yard; and the result is I have been robbed, and  this man accuses Lindon of committing the robbery, and bribing him to  silence.\"    \"But it is not true, Josiah.  My son could not be guilty of such a  crime.\"    \"He will have every opportunity of disproving it before the  magistrates,\" said Uncle Josiah, coldly.    \"Magistrates!--my boy?\" exclaimed Mrs Lavington, wildly.  \"Oh, no, no,  no, brother; you will not proceed to such extremities as these.  My boy  before the magistrates.  Impossible!\"    \"The matter is out of my hands, now,\" said the old merchant, gravely.  \"I was bound to charge that scoundrel labourer with the theft.  I could  not tell that he would accuse your son of being the principal in the  crime.\"    \"But you will stop it now for my sake, dear.  Don, my boy, why do you  not speak, and beg your uncle's forgiveness?\"    Don remained silent, with his brow wrinkled, his chin upon his breast,  and a stubborn look of anger in his eyes, as he stood with his"]]]
