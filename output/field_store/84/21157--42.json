In dealing with his  pagan subjects Constantine showed so much tact and impartiality as to  cast doubts upon the sincerity of his conversion. He has been accused  of having accepted from the people of Hispellum (Spello, in Umbria),  the honor of a temple, and from the inhabitants of Roman Africa that  of a priesthood for the worship of his own family (_sacerdotium Flaviae  gentis_). The exculpation is given by Constantine himself in his  address of thanks to the Hispellates: \"We are pleased and grateful for  your determination to raise a temple in honor of our family and of  ourselves; and we accept it, provided you do not contaminate it with  superstitious practices.\" The honor of a temple and of a priesthood,  therefore, was offered and accepted as a political demonstration, as  an act of loyalty, and as an occasion for public festivities, both  inaugural and anniversary.    [Illustration: Picture of Orpheus found in the Catacombs of  Priscilla.]    In accepting rites and customs which were not offensive to her  principles and morality, the Church showed equal tact and foresight,  and contributed to the peaceful accomplishment of the transformation.  These rites and customs, borrowed from classical times, are nowhere so  conspicuous as in Rome. Giovanni Marangoni, a scholar of the last  century, wrote a book on this subject which is full of valuable  information.[16] The subject is so comprehensive, and in a certain  sense so well known, that I must satisfy myself by mentioning only a  few particulars connected with recent discoveries. First, as to  symbolic images allowed in churches and cemeteries. Of Orpheus playing  on the lyre, while watching his flock, as a substitute for the Good  Shepherd, there have been found in the catacombs four paintings, two  reliefs on sarcophagi, one engraving on a gem. Here is the latest  representation discovered, from the Catacombs of Priscilla (1888).    [Illustration: The Four Seasons, from the Imperial Palace, Ostia.]    The belief that the sibyls had prophesied the advent of Christ made  their images popular. The church of the Aracoeli is particularly  associated with them, because tradition refers the origin of its name  to an altar--ARA PRIMOGENITI DEI--raised to the son of God by the  emperor Augustus, who had been warned of his advent by the sibylline  books. For this reason the figures of Augustus and of the Tiburtine  sibyl are painted on either side of the arch above the high altar.  They have actually been given the place of honor in this church; and  formerly, when at Christmas time the _Presepio_ was exhibited in the  second chapel on the left, they occupied the front row, the sibyl  pointing out to Augustus the Virgin and the Bambino who appeared in  the sky in a halo of light. The two figures, carved in wood, have now  disappeared; they were given away or sold thirty years ago, when a new  set of images was offered to the _Presepio_ by prince Alexander  Torlonia. Prophets and sibyls appear also in Renaissance monuments;  they were modelled by della Porta in the Santa Casa at Loretto,  painted by Michelangelo in the Sistine chapel, by Raphael in S. Maria  della Pace, by Pinturicchio in the Borgia apartments, engraved by  Baccio Baldini, a contemporary of Sandro Botticelli, and \"graffite\" by  Matteo di Giovanni in the pavement of the Duomo at Siena.    The images of the Four Seasons are not uncommon on Christian  sarcophagi. The latest addition to this class of subjects is to be  found in the church of S. Paolo alle Tre Fontane. Four medallions of  polychrome mosaic, representing the _Hiems_, _Ver_, _AEstas_, and  _Autumnus_, discovered in the so-called imperial palace at Ostia, were  inserted in the pavement of this church by order of Pius IX. Galenus  and Hippokrates, manipulating medicines and cordials, were painted in  the lower basilica at Anagni, Hermes Trismegistos was represented in  mosaic in the Duomo of Siena, the labors of Hercules were carved in  ivory in the cathedra of S. Peter's. Montfaucon describes the tomb of  the poet Sannazzaro in the church of the Olivetans, Naples, as  ornamented with the statues of Apollo and Minerva, and with groups of  satyrs. In the eighteenth century the ecclesiastical authorities tried  to give a less profane aspect to the composition, by engraving the  name of David under the Apollo, and of Judith under the Minerva.  Another mixture of sacred and profane conceptions is to be found in  the names of some of our Roman churches,--as S. Maria in Minerva, S.  Stefano del Cacco (Kynokephalos), S. Lorenzo in Matuta, S. Salvatore  in Tellure, all conspicuous landmarks in the history of the  transformation of Rome.    I shall mention one more instance. The portrait bust of S. Paul, of  silver gilt, from the chapel of the Sancta Sanctorum, was loaded with  gems and intaglios of Greek or Graeco-Roman workmanship, among which  was a magnificent cameo with the portrait-head of Nero, which had been  worn, most probably, by the very murderer of the apostle.[17]    [Illustration: Ancient Candelabrum in the church of SS. Nereo ed  Achilleo.]    In the next chapter I shall speak of ancient temples as museums of  statuary, galleries of pictures, and cabinets of precious objects. I  need not describe the acceptance and development of this tradition by  the Church. To it we are indebted for the inexhaustible wealth in  works of art of every kind, of which Italy is so proud. But in the  period which elapsed between the fall of the empire and the foundation  of the Cosmati school, the Christians were compelled, by the want of  contemporary productions, to borrow works of art and decorative  fragments from temples, palaces, and tombs. The gallery of the  Candelabra, in the Vatican museum, has been formed mostly of  specimens formerly set up in churches. The accompanying cut represents  the candelabrum still existing in the church of SS. Nereo ed Achilleo,  one of the most exquisite and delicate works of the kind. The Biga, or  two-horse chariot, in the Vatican, was used for centuries as an  episcopal throne in the choir of S. Mark's. In the church of the  Aracoeli there was an altar dedicated to Isis by some one who had  returned safely from a perilous journey. This bore the conventional  emblem of two footprints, which were believed by the Christians to be  the footprints of the angel seen by Gregory the Great on the summit of  Hadrian's tomb. Philip de Winghe describes them as those of a _puer  quinquennis_, a boy five years old.[18] This curious relic has been  removed to the Capitoline Museum.    The indifference with which these profane and sometimes offensive  works were admitted within sacred edifices is astonishing. The high  altar in the church of S. Teodoro was supported, until 1703, by a  round _ara_, on the rim of which the following words are now engraved:  \"On this marble of the gentiles incense was offered to the gods.\"  Another altar, in the church of S. Michele in Borgo, was covered with  bas-reliefs and legends belonging to the superstition of Cybele and  Atys; a third, in the church of the Aracoeli, had been dedicated to  the goddess Annona by an importer of wheat. The pavement of the  basilica of S. Paul was patched with nine hundred and thirty-one  miscellaneous inscriptions; and so were those of S. Martino ai Monti,  S. Maria in Trastevere, SS. Giovanni e Paolo, etc. We have one  specimen left of these inscribed pavements in the church of SS.  Quattro Coronati on the Caelian, which may be called an epigraphic  museum.    [Illustration: The Templum Sacrae Urbis (SS. Cosma e Damiano).]    In the third chapter I shall have occasion to describe the  transformation of nearly all the great public buildings of imperial  Rome into places of Christian worship, but it falls within the scope  of this chapter to remark that, in many instances, the pagan  decorations of those buildings were not affected by the change. When  Felix IV. took possession of the _templum sacrae urbis_, and dedicated  it to SS. Cosma and Damianus, the walls of the building were covered  with incrustations of the time of Septimius Severus representing the  wolf and other profane emblems. Pope Felix not only accepted them as  an ornament to his church, but tried to copy them in the apse which he  rebuilt. The same process was followed by Pope Simplicius (A. D.  468-483), in transforming the basilica of Junius Bassus on the  Esquiline into the church of S. Andrea.[19] The faithful, raising  their eyes towards the tribune, could see the figures of Christ and  his apostles in mosaic; turning to the side walls, they could see  Nero, Galba, and six other Roman emperors, Diana hunting the stag,  Hylas stolen by the nymphs, Cybele on the chariot drawn by lions, a  lion attacking a centaur, the chariot of Apollo, figures performing  mysterious Egyptian rites, and other such profanities, represented in  _opus sectile marmoreum_, a sort of Florentine mosaic. This unique set  of intarsios was destroyed in the sixteenth century by the French  Antonian monks for a reason worth relating. They believed that the  glutinous substance by which the layer of marble or mother-of-pearl  was kept fast was an excellent remedy against the ague; hence every  time one of them was attacked by fever, a portion of those marvellous  works was sacrificed. Fever must have raged quite fiercely among the  French monks, because when this wanton practice was stopped, only  four pictures were left. Two are now preserved in the church of S.  Antonio, in the chapel of the saint; two in the Palazzo Albani del  Drago alle Quattro Fontane, on the landing of the stairs.[20]    [Illustration: Mosaic from the church of S. Andrea.]    Intarsios of the same kind have been seen and described in the  basilica of S. Croce in Gerusalemme, in the church of S. Stefano  Rotondo, in that of S. Adriano, etc. When the offices adjoining the  Senate Hall were transformed into the church of S."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22157"],[0,"Lectures on Stellar Statistics (#6)"],[1,"ound, so that it formed a  narrow dark line perceptible at star illumination. Perpendicular to this  diameter (the \"hour-line\") were 10 lines, at each side of a middle line,  drawn at a distance of 7'. These lines were drawn with black oil colour  on the glass.    The observations are performed by the observer A and his assistant B. A  is in a dark room, lies on a chair having the eye at the ocular and can  easily look over 2 deg. in declination. The assistant sits in the room  below, separated by a board floor, at the _Thiede_ clock.    From the beginning of the observations the declination circle is fixed  at a certain declination (whole degrees). All stars passing the field at  a distance smaller than one degree from the middle line are observed.  Hence the name \"Durchmusterung\". When a star passes the \"hour line\" the  magnitude is called out by A, and noted by B together with the time of  the clock. Simultaneously the declination is noted by A in the darkness.  On some occasions 30 stars may be observed in a minute.    The first observation was made on Febr. 25, 1852, the last on March 27,  1859. In all there were 625 observation nights with 1841 \"zones\". The  total number of stars was 324198.    The catalogue was published by ARGELANDER in three parts in the years  1859, 1861 and 1862[7] and embraces all stars between the pole and 2 deg.  south of the equator brighter than 9m.5, according to the scale of  ARGELANDER (his aim was to register all stars up to the 9th magnitude).  To this scale we return later. The catalogue is arranged in accordance  with the declination-degrees, and for each degree according to the right  ascension. Quotations from B. D. have the form B. D. 23 deg..174, which  signifies: Zone +23 deg., star No. 174.    ARGELANDER's work was continued for stars between [delta] = -2 deg. and  [delta] = -23 deg. by SCHOeNFELD, according to much the same plan, but with a  larger instrument (aperture 159 mm, focal length 1930 mm, magnifying  power 26 times). The observations were made in the years 1876 to 1881  and include 133659 stars.[8]    The positions in B. D. are given in tenths of a second in right  ascension and in tenths of a minute in declination.      20. _The Cape Photographic Durchmusterung_[9] (C. P. D.). This embraces  the whole southern sky from -18 deg. to the south pole. Planned by GILL, the  photographs were taken at the Cape Observatory with a DALLMEYER lens  with 15 cm. aperture and a focal-length of 135 cm. Plates of 30 x 30 cm.  give the coordinates for a surface of 5 x 5 square degrees. The  photographs were taken in the years 1885 to 1890. The measurements of  the plates were made by KAPTEYN in Groningen with a \"parallactic\"  measuring-apparatus specially constructed for this purpose, which  permits of the direct obtaining of the right ascension and the  declination of the stars. The measurements were made in the years 1886  to 1898. The catalogue was published in three parts in the years 1896 to  1900.    The positions have the same accuracy as in B. D. The whole number of  stars is 454875. KAPTEYN considers the catalogue complete to at least  the magnitude 9m.2.    In the two great catalogues B. D. and C. P. D. we have all stars  registered down to the magnitude 9.0 (visually) and a good way below  this limit. Probably as far as to 10m.    A third great Durchmusterung has for some time been in preparation at  Cordoba in Argentina.[10] It continues the southern zones of SCHOeNFELD  and is for the present completed up to 62 deg. southern declination.    All these Durchmusterungs are ultimately based on star catalogues of  smaller extent and of great precision. Of these catalogues we shall not  here speak (Compare, however, Sec.23).    A great \"Durchmusterung\", that will include all stars to the 11th  magnitude, has for the last thirty years been in progress at different  observatories proposed by the congress in Paris, 1888. The observations  proceed very irregularly, and there is little prospect of getting the  work finished in an appreciable time.      21. _Star charts._ For the present we possess two great photographic  star charts, embracing the whole heaven:--The _Harvard Map_ (H. M.) and  the _FRANKLIN-ADAMS Charts_ (F. A. C.).    _The Harvard Map_, of which a copy (or more correctly two copies) on  glass has kindly been placed at the disposal of the Lund Observatory by  Mr. PICKERING, embraces all stars down to the 11th magnitude. It  consists of 55 plates, each embracing more than 900 square degrees of  the sky. The photographs were taken with a small lens of only 2.5 cms.  aperture and about 32.5 cms. focal-length. The time of exposure was one  hour. These plates have been counted at the Lund Observatory by Hans  HENIE. We return later to these counts.    The _FRANKLIN-ADAMS Charts_ were made by an amateur astronomer  FRANKLIN-ADAMS, partly at his own observatory (Mervel Hill) in England,  partly in Cape and Johannesburg, Transvaal, in the years 1905-1912. The  photographs were taken with a _Taylor_ lens with 25 cm. aperture and a  focal-length of 114 cm., which gives rather good images on a field of 15  x 15 square degrees.    The whole sky is here reproduced on, in all, 206 plates. Each plate was  exposed for 2 hours and 20 minutes and gives images of the stars down to  the 17th magnitude. The original plates are now at the observatory in  Greenwich. Some copies on paper have been made, of which the Lund  Observatory possesses one. It shows stars down to the 14th-15th  magnitudes and gives a splendid survey of the whole sky more complete,  indeed, than can be obtained, even for the north sky, by direct  observation of the heavens with any telescope at present accessible in  Sweden.    The F. A. C. have been counted by the astronomers of the Lund  Observatory, so that thus a complete count of the number of stars for  the whole heaven down to the 14th magnitude has been obtained. We shall  later have an opportunity of discussing the results of these counts.    A great star map is planned in connection with the Paris catalogue  mentioned in the preceding paragraph. This _Carte du Ciel_ (C. d. C.) is  still unfinished, but there seems to be a possibility that we shall one  day see this work carried to completion. It will embrace stars down to  the 14th magnitude and thus does not reach so far as the F. A. C., but  on the other hand is carried out on a considerably greater scale and  gives better images than F. A. C. and will therefore be of a great value  in the future, especially for the study of the proper motions of the  stars.      22. _Distance of the stars._ As the determination, from the annual  parallax, of the distances of the stars is very precarious if the  distance exceeds 5 sir. ([pi] = 0\".04), it is only natural that the  catalogues of star-distances should be but few in number. The most  complete catalogues are those of BIGOURDAN in the Bulletin astronomique  XXVI (1909), of KAPTEYN and WEERSMA in the publications of Groningen Nr.  24 (1910), embracing 365 stars, and of WALKEY in the \"Journal of the  British Astronomical Association XXVII\" (1917), embracing 625 stars.  Through the spectroscopic method of ADAMS it will be possible to enlarge  this number considerably, so that the distance of all stars, for which  the spectrum is well known, may be determined with fair accuracy. ADAMS  has up to now published 1646 parallax stars.      23. _Proper motions._ An excellent catalogue of the proper motions of  the stars is LEWIS BOSS's \"Preliminary General Catalogue of 6188 stars\"  (1910) (B. P. C.). It contains the proper motions of all stars down to  the sixth magnitude (with few exceptions) and moreover some fainter  stars. The catalogue is considered by the editor only as a preliminary  to a greater catalogue, which is to embrace some 25000 stars and is now  nearly completed.      24. _Visual magnitudes._ The Harvard observatory has, under the  direction of PICKERING, made its principal aim to study the  magnitudes of the stars, and the history of this observatory is at the  same time the history of the treatment of this problem. PICKERING, in  the genuine American manner, is not satisfied with the three thirds of  the sky visible from the Harvard observatory, but has also founded a  daughter observatory in South America, at Arequipa in Peru. It is  therefore possible for him to publish catalogues embracing the whole  heaven from pole to pole. The last complete catalogue (1908) of the  magnitudes of the stars is found in the \"Annals of the Harvard  Observatory T. 50\" (H. 50). It contains 9110 stars and can be considered  as complete to the magnitude 6m.5. To this catalogue are generally  referred the magnitudes which have been adopted at the Observatory of  Lund, and which are treated in these lectures.    A very important, and in one respect even still more comprehensive,  catalogue of visual magnitudes is the \"Potsdam General Catalogue\" (P. G.  C.) by MUeLLER and KEMPF, which was published simultaneously with H. 50.  It contains the magnitude of 14199 stars and embraces all stars on the  northern hemisphere brighter than 7m.5 (according to B. D.). We have  already seen that the zero-point of H. 50 and P. G. C. is somewhat  different and that the magnitudes in P. G. C. must be increased by  -0m.16 if they are to be reduced to the Harvard scale. The difference  between the two catalogues however is due to some extent to the colour  of the stars, as has been shown by Messrs. MUeLLER and KEMPF.      25. _Photographic magnitudes._ Our knowledge of this subject is still  rather incomplete. The most comprehensive catalogue is the  \"Actinometrie\" by SCHWARZSCHILD (1912), containing the photographic  magnitudes of all stars in B. D. down to the magnitude 7m.5 between the  equator and a declination of +20 deg.. In all, 3522 stars. The photographic  magnitudes are however not reduced for the zero-point (compare Sec.6).
