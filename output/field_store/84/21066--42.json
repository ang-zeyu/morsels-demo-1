[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20439"],[0,"Susan B. Anthony (#6)"],[1," acquisition of free Oregon could not offset. She read antislavery  tracts and copies of William Lloyd Garrison's _Liberator_, borrowed  from Quaker friends; and on long winter evenings, as she sat by the  fire sewing, she talked over with her father the issues they raised.    When spring came and the trees and bushes leafed out, she took more  interest in the farm, discovering its good points one by one--the  flowering quince along the driveway, the pinks bordering the walk to  the front door, the rosebushes in the yard, and cherry trees, currant  and gooseberry bushes in abundance. Her father planted peach and apple  orchards and worked the \"sixpenny farm,\"[24] as he called it, to the  best of his ability, but the thirty-two acres seemed very small  compared with the large Anthony and Read farms in the Berkshires, and  he soon began to look about for more satisfying work. This he found a  few years later with the New York Life Insurance Company, then  developing its business in western New York. Very successful in this  new field, he continued in it the rest of his life, but he always kept  the farm for the family home.           *       *       *       *       *    The first member of the family to leave the Rochester farm was Susan.  The cherry trees were in bloom when she received an offer from  Canajoharie Academy to teach the female department. As Canajoharie was  across the river from Uncle Joshua Read's home in Palatine Bridge and  he was a trustee of the academy, she read between the lines his kindly  interest in her. He was an influential citizen of that community, a  bank director and part owner of the Albany-Utica turnpike and the  stage line to Schenectady. Accepting the offer at once, she made the  long journey by canal boat to Canajoharie, and early in May 1846 was  comfortably settled in the home of Uncle Joshua's daughter, Margaret  Read Caldwell.    She soon loved Margaret as a sister and was devoted to her children.  None of her new friends were Quakers and she enjoyed their social life  thoroughly, leaving behind her forever the somber clothing which she  had heretofore regarded as a mark of righteousness. She began her  school with twenty-five pupils and a yearly salary of approximately  $110. This was more than she had ever earned before, and for the first  time in her life she spent her money freely on herself.    Her first quarterly examination, held before the principal, the  trustees, and parents, established her reputation as a teacher, and in  addition everyone said, \"The schoolmarm looks beautiful.\"[25] She had  dressed up for the occasion, wearing a new plaid muslin, purple,  white, blue, and brown, with white collar and cuffs, and had hung a  gold watch and chain about her neck. She wound the four braids of her  smooth brown hair around her big shell comb and put on her new  prunella gaiters with patent-leather heels and tips. She looked so  pretty, so neat, and so capable that many of the parents feared some  young man would fall desperately in love with her and rob the academy  of a teacher. She did have more than her share of admirers. She soon  saw her first circus and went to her first ball, a real novelty for  the young woman who had sat demurely along the wall in the attic room  of her Center Falls home while her more worldly friends danced.    In spite of all her good times, she missed her family, but because of  the long trip to Rochester, she did not return to the farm for two  years. She spent her vacations with Guelma and Hannah, who lived only  a few hours away, or in Albany with her former teacher at Deborah  Moulson's seminary, Lydia Mott, a cousin by marriage of Lucretia Mott.  In anticipation of a vacation at home, she wrote her parents,  \"Sometimes I can hardly wait for the day to come. They have talked of  building a new academy this summer, but I do not believe they will. My  room is not fit to stay in and I have promised myself that I would not  pass another winter in it. If I must forever teach, I will seek at  least a comfortable house to do penance in. I have a pleasant school  of twenty scholars, but I have to manufacture the interest duty  compels me to exhibit.... Energy and something to stimulate is  wanting! But I expect the busy summer vacation spent with my dearest  and truest friends will give me new life and fresh courage to  persevere in the arduous path of duty. Do not think me unhappy with my  fate, no not so. I am only a little tired and a good deal lazy. That  is all. Do write very soon. Tell about the strawberries and peaches,  cherries and plums.... Tell me how the yard looks, what flowers are in  bloom and all about the farming business.\"[26]           *       *       *       *       *    During her visits in Albany with Lydia Mott, who was now an active  abolitionist, Susan heard a great deal about antislavery work. At this  time, however, Canajoharie took little interest in this reform  movement, but temperance was gaining a foothold. Throughout the  country, Sons of Temperance were organizing and women wanted to help,  but the men refused to admit them to their organizations, protesting  that public reform was outside women's sphere. Unwilling to be put off  when the need was so great, women formed their own secret temperance  societies, and then, growing bolder, announced themselves as Daughters  of Temperance.    Canajoharie had its Daughters of Temperance, and Susan, long an  advocate of temperance, gladly joined the crusade, and made her first  speech when the Daughters of Temperance held a supper meeting to  interest the people of the village. Few women at this time could have  been persuaded to address an audience of both men and women, believing  this to be bold, unladylike, and contrary to the will of God; but the  young Quaker, whose grandmother and aunts had always spoken in  Meeting when the spirit moved them, was ready to say her word for  temperance, taking it for granted that it was not only woman's right  but her responsibility to speak and work for social reform.    About two hundred people assembled for the supper, and entering the  hall, Susan found it festooned with cedar and red flannel and to her  amazement saw letters in evergreen on one of the walls, spelling out  Susan B. Anthony.    \"I hardly knew how to conduct myself amidst so much kindly  regard,\"[27] she confided to her family.    She had carefully written out her speech and had sewn the pages  together in a blue cover. Now in a clear serious voice, she read its  formal flowery sentences telling of the weekly meetings of \"this now  despised little band\" which had awakened women to the great need of  reform.    \"It is generally conceded,\" she declared, \"that our sex fashions the  social and moral state of society. We do not assume that females  possess unbounded power in abolishing the evil customs of the day; but  we do believe that were they en masse to discontinue the use of wine  and brandy as beverages at both their public and private parties, not  one of the opposite sex, who has any claim to the title of gentleman,  would so insult them as to come into their presence after having  quaffed of that foul destroyer of all true delicacy and refinement....  Ladies! There is no neutral position for us to assume....\"[28]    The next day the village buzzed with talk of the meeting; only a few  criticized Susan for speaking in public, and almost all agreed that  she was the smartest woman in Canajoharie.    While she was busy with her temperance work, there were stirrings  among women in other parts of New York State in the spring and early  summer of 1848. Through the efforts of a few women who circulated  petitions and the influence of wealthy men who saw irresponsible  sons-in-law taking over the property they wanted their daughters to  own, a Married Women's Property Law passed the legislature; this made  it possible for a married woman to hold real estate in her own name.  Heretofore all property owned by a woman at marriage and all received  by gift or inheritance had at once become her husband's and he had had  the right to sell it or will it away without her consent and to  collect the rents or the income. The new law was welcomed in the  Anthony household, for now Lucy Anthony's inheritance, which had  bought the Rochester farm, could at last be put in her own name and  need no longer be held for her by her brother.    In the newspapers in July, Susan read scornful, humorous, and  indignant reports of a woman's rights convention in Seneca Falls, New  York, at which women had issued a Declaration of Sentiments,  announcing themselves men's equals. They had protested against legal,  economic, social, and educational discriminations and asked for the  franchise. A woman's rights convention in the 1840s was a startling  event. Women, if they were \"ladies\" did not attend public gatherings  where politics or social reforms were discussed, because such subjects  were regarded as definitely out of their sphere. Much less did they  venture to call meetings of their own and issue bold resolutions.    Susan was not shocked by this break with tradition, but she did not  instinctively come to the defense of these rebellious women, nor  champion their cause. She was amused rather than impressed. Yet  Lucretia Mott's presence at the convention aroused her curiosity.  Among her father's Quaker friends in Rochester, she had heard only  praise of Mrs. Mott, and she herself, when a pupil at Deborah  Moulson's seminary, had been inspired by Mrs. Mott's remarks at  Friends' Meeting in Philadelphia.    So far Susan had encountered few barriers because she was a woman. She  had had little personal contact with the hardships other women  suffered because of their inferior legal status. To be sure, it had  been puzzling to her as child that Sally Hyatt, the most skillful  weaver in her father's mill, had never been made overseer, but the  fact that her mother had not the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20461"],[0,"German Culture Past and Present (#6)"],[1," disappear, or to change fundamentally the character of his  activity.    The feudal orders saw their own position seriously threatened by the  new development of things economic in the cities. The guilds were  becoming crystallized into close corporations of wealthy families,  constituting a kind of second _Ehrbarkeit_ or town patriciate; the  numbers of the landless and unprivileged, with at most a bare footing  in the town constitution, were increasing in an alarming proportion;  the journeyman workman was no longer a stage between apprentice and  master craftsman, but a permanent condition embodied in a large and  growing class. All these symptoms indicated an extraordinary economic  revolution, which was making itself at first directly felt only in the  larger cities, but the results of which were dislocating the social  relations of the Middle Ages throughout the whole empire.    Perhaps the most striking feature in this dislocation was the transition  from direct barter to exchange through the medium of money, and the  consequent suddenly increased importance of the role played by usury in  the social life of the time. The scarcity of money is a perennial theme  of complaint for which the new large capitalist-monopolists are made  responsible. But the class in question was itself only a symptom of the  general economic change. The seeming scarcity of money, though but the  consequence of the increased demand for a circulating medium, was  explained, to the disadvantage of the hated monopolists, by a crude form  of the \"mercantile\" theory. The new merchant, in contradistinction to  the master craftsman working _en famille_ with his apprentices and  assistants, now often stood entirely outside the processes of  production, as speculator or middleman; and he, and still more the  syndicate who fulfilled the like functions on a larger scale (especially  with reference to foreign trade), came to be regarded as particularly  obnoxious robbers, because interlopers to boot. Unlike the knights, they  were robbers with a new face.    The lawyers were detested for much the same reason (cf. _German  Society at the Close of the Middle Ages_, pp. 219-28). The  professional lawyer class, since its final differentiation from the  clerk class in general, had made the Roman or civil law its  speciality, and had done its utmost everywhere to establish the  principles of the latter in place of the old feudal law of earlier  mediaeval Europe. The Roman law was especially favourable to the  pretensions of the princes, and, from an economic point of view, of  the nobility in general, inasmuch as land was on the new legal  principles treated as the private property of the lord; over which he  had full power of ownership, and not, as under feudal and canon law,  as a _trust_ involving duties as well as rights. The class of jurists  was itself of comparatively recent growth in Central Europe, and its  rapid increase in every portion of the empire dated from less than  half a century back. It may be well understood, therefore, why these  interlopers, who ignored the ancient customary law of the country, and  who by means of an alien code deprived the poor freeholder or  copyholder of his land, or justified new and unheard-of exactions on  the part of his lord on the plea that the latter might do what he  liked with his own, were regarded by the peasant and humble man as  robbers whose depredations were, if anything, even more resented than  those of their old and tried enemy--the plundering knight.    The priest, especially of the regular orders, was indeed an old foe,  but his offence had now become very rank. From the middle of the  fifteenth century onwards the stream of anti-clerical literature waxes  alike in volume and intensity. The \"monk\" had become the object of  hatred and scorn throughout the whole lay world. This view of the  \"regular\" was shared, moreover, by not a few of the secular clergy  themselves. Humanists, who were subsequently ardent champions of the  Church against Luther and the Protestant Reformation--men such as  Murner and Erasmus--had been previously the bitterest satirists of the  \"friar\" and the \"monk.\" Amongst the great body of the laity, however,  though the religious orders came in perhaps for the greater share of  animosity, the secular priesthood was not much better off in popular  favour, whilst the upper members of the hierarchy were naturally  regarded as the chief blood-suckers of the German people in the  interests of Rome. The vast revenues which both directly in the shape  of _pallium_ (the price of \"investiture\"), _annates_ (first year's  revenues of appointments), _Peter's-pence_, and recently of  _indulgences_--the latter the by no means most onerous exaction, since  it was voluntary--all these things, taken together with what was  indirectly obtained from Germany, through the expenditure of German  ecclesiastics on their visits to Rome and by the crowd of parasitics,  nominal holders of German benefices merely, but real recipients of  German substance, who danced attendance at the Vatican--obviously  constituted an enormous drain on the resources of the country from all  the lay classes alike, of which wealth the papal chair could be  plainly seen to be the receptacle.    If we add to these causes of discontent the vastness in number of the  regular clergy, the \"friars\" and \"monks\" already referred to, who  consumed, but were only too obviously unproductive, it will be  sufficiently plain that the Protestant Reformation had something very  much more than a purely speculative basis to work upon. Religious  reformers there had been in Germany throughout the Middle Ages, but  their preachings had taken no deep root. The powerful personality of  the Monk of Wittenberg found an economic soil ready to hand in which  his teachings could fructify, and hence the world-historic result. The  peasant revolts, sporadic the Middle Ages through, had for the  half-century preceding the Reformation been growing in frequency and  importance, but it needed nevertheless the sudden impulse, the  powerful jar given by a Luther in 1517, and the series of blows with  which it was followed during the years immediately succeeding, to  crystallize the mass of fluid discontent and social unrest in its  various forms and give it definite direction. The blow which was  primarily struck in the region of speculative thought and  ecclesiastical relations did not stop there in its effects. The attack  on the dominant theological system--at first merely on certain  comparatively unessential outworks of that system--necessarily of its  own force developed into an attack on the organization representing  it, and on the economic basis of the latter. The battle against  ecclesiastical abuses, again, in its turn, focussed the  ever-smouldering discontent with abuses in general; and this time, not  in one district only, but simultaneously over the whole of Germany.  The movement inaugurated by Luther gave to the peasant groaning under  the weight of baronial oppression, and the small handicraftsman  suffering under his _Ehrbarkeit_, a rallying-point and a rallying cry.    In history there is no movement which starts up full grown from the  brain of any one man, or even from the mind of any one generation of  men, like Athene from the head of Zeus. The historical epoch which  marks the crisis of the given change is, after all, little beyond a  prominent landmark--a parting of the ways--led up to by a long  preparatory development. This is nowhere more clearly illustrated than  in the Reformation and its accompanying movements. The ideas and  aspirations animating the social, political, and intellectual revolt  of the sixteenth century can each be traced back to, at least, the  beginning of the fifteenth century, and in many cases farther still.  The way the German of Luther's time looked at the burning questions of  the hour was not essentially different from the way the English  Wyclifites and Lollards, or the Bohemian Hussites and Taborites viewed  them. There was obviously a difference born of the later time, but  this difference was not, I repeat, essential. The changes which, a  century previously, were only just beginning, had, meanwhile, made  enormous progress.    The disintegration of the material conditions of mediaeval social life  was now approaching its completion, forced on by the inventions and  discoveries of the previous half-century. But the ideals of the mass  of men, learned and simple, were still in the main the ideals that had  been prevalent throughout the whole of the later Middle Ages. Men  still looked at the world and at social progress through mediaeval  spectacles. The chief difference was that now ideas which had  previously been confined to special localities, or had only had a  sporadic existence among the people at large, had become general  throughout large portions of the population. The invention of the art  of printing was, of course, largely instrumental in effecting this  change.    The comparatively sudden popularization of doctrines previously  confined to special circles was the distinguishing feature of the  intellectual life of the first half of the sixteenth century. Among  the many illustrations of the foregoing which might be given, we are  specially concerned here to note the sudden popularity during this  period of two imaginary constitutions dating from early in the  previous century. From the fourteenth century we find traces, perhaps  suggested by the Prester John legend, of a deliverer in the shape of  an emperor who should come from the East, who should be the last of  his name; should right all wrongs; should establish the empire in  universal justice and peace; and, in short, should be the forerunner  of the kingdom of Christ on earth. This notion or mystical hope took  increasing root during the fifteenth century, and is to be found in  many respects embodied in the"]]]
