It is  possible that some prestige went with the possession of Glastonbury,  which was like a piece of the Holy Land; but behind Glastonbury there  was an even grander and more impressive power. There irradiated to all  Europe at that time the glory of the golden age of Ireland. There the  Celts were the classics of Christian art, opened in the Book of Kels  four hundred years before its time. There the baptism of the whole  people had been a spontaneous popular festival which reads almost like a  picnic; and thence came crowds of enthusiasts for the Gospel almost  literally like men running with good news. This must be remembered  through the development of that dark dual destiny that has bound us to  Ireland: for doubts have been thrown on a national unity which was not  from the first a political unity. But if Ireland was not one kingdom it  was in reality one bishopric. Ireland was not converted but created by  Christianity, as a stone church is created; and all its elements were  gathered as under a garment, under the genius of St. Patrick. It was the  more individual because the religion was mere religion, without the  secular conveniences. Ireland was never Roman, and it was always  Romanist.    But indeed this is, in a lesser degree, true of our more immediate  subject. It is the paradox of this time that only the unworldly things  had any worldly success. The politics are a nightmare; the kings are  unstable and the kingdoms shifting; and we are really never on solid  ground except on consecrated ground. The material ambitions are not only  always unfruitful but nearly always unfulfilled. The castles are all  castles in the air; it is only the churches that are built on the  ground. The visionaries are the only practical men, as in that  extraordinary thing, the monastery, which was, in many ways, to be the  key of our history. The time was to come when it was to be rooted out of  our country with a curious and careful violence; and the modern English  reader has therefore a very feeble idea of it and hence of the ages in  which it worked. Even in these pages a word or two about its primary  nature is therefore quite indispensable.    In the tremendous testament of our religion there are present certain  ideals that seem wilder than impieties, which have in later times  produced wild sects professing an almost inhuman perfection on certain  points; as in the Quakers who renounce the right of self-defence, or the  Communists who refuse any personal possessions. Rightly or wrongly, the  Christian Church had from the first dealt with these visions as being  special spiritual adventures which were to the adventurous. She  reconciled them with natural human life by calling them specially good,  without admitting that the neglect of them was necessarily bad. She took  the view that it takes all sorts to make a world, even the religious  world; and used the man who chose to go without arms, family, or  property as a sort of exception that proved the rule. Now the  interesting fact is that he really did prove it. This madman who would  not mind his own business becomes the business man of the age. The very  word \"monk\" is a revolution, for it means solitude and came to mean  community--one might call it sociability. What happened was that this  communal life became a sort of reserve and refuge behind the individual  life; a hospital for every kind of hospitality. We shall see later how  this same function of the common life was given to the common land. It  is hard to find an image for it in individualist times; but in private  life we most of us know the friend of the family who helps it by being  outside, like a fairy godmother. It is not merely flippant to say that  monks and nuns stood to mankind as a sort of sanctified league of aunts  and uncles. It is a commonplace that they did everything that nobody  else would do; that the abbeys kept the world's diary, faced the plagues  of all flesh, taught the first technical arts, preserved the pagan  literature, and above all, by a perpetual patchwork of charity, kept the  poor from the most distant sight of their modern despair. We still find  it necessary to have a reserve of philanthropists, but we trust it to  men who have made themselves rich, not to men who have made themselves  poor. Finally, the abbots and abbesses were elective. They introduced  representative government, unknown to ancient democracy, and in itself a  semi-sacramental idea. If we could look from the outside at our own  institutions, we should see that the very notion of turning a thousand  men into one large man walking to Westminster is not only an act or  faith, but a fairy tale. The fruitful and effective history of  Anglo-Saxon England would be almost entirely a history of its  monasteries. Mile by mile, and almost man by man, they taught and  enriched the land. And then, about the beginning of the ninth century,  there came a turn, as of the twinkling of an eye, and it seemed that all  their work was in vain.    That outer world of universal anarchy that lay beyond Christendom heaved  another of its colossal and almost cosmic waves and swept everything  away. Through all the eastern gates, left open, as it were, by the first  barbarian auxiliaries, burst a plague of seafaring savages from Denmark  and Scandinavia; and the recently baptized barbarians were again flooded  by the unbaptized. All this time, it must be remembered, the actual  central mechanism of Roman government had been running down like a  clock. It was really a race between the driving energy of the  missionaries on the edges of the Empire and the galloping paralysis of  the city at the centre. In the ninth century the heart had stopped  before the hands could bring help to it. All the monastic civilization  which had grown up in Britain under a vague Roman protection perished  unprotected. The toy kingdoms of the quarrelling Saxons were smashed  like sticks; Guthrum, the pirate chief, slew St. Edmund, assumed the  crown of East England, took tribute from the panic of Mercia, and  towered in menace over Wessex, the last of the Christian lands. The  story that follows, page after page, is only the story of its despair  and its destruction. The story is a string of Christian defeats  alternated with victories so vain as to be more desolate than defeats.  It is only in one of these, the fine but fruitless victory at Ashdown,  that we first see in the dim struggle, in a desperate and secondary  part, the figure who has given his title to the ultimate turning of the  tide. For the victor was not then the king, but only the king's younger  brother. There is, from the first, something humble and even accidental  about Alfred. He was a great understudy. The interest of his early life  lies in this: that he combined an almost commonplace coolness, and  readiness for the ceaseless small bargains and shifting combinations of  all that period, with the flaming patience of saints in times of  persecution. While he would dare anything for the faith, he would  bargain in anything except the faith. He was a conqueror, with no  ambition; an author only too glad to be a translator; a simple,  concentrated, wary man, watching the fortunes of one thing, which he  piloted both boldly and cautiously, and which he saved at last.    He had disappeared after what appeared to be the final heathen triumph  and settlement, and is supposed to have lurked like an outlaw in a  lonely islet in the impenetrable marshlands of the Parret; towards those  wild western lands to which aboriginal races are held to have been  driven by fate itself. But Alfred, as he himself wrote in words that are  his challenge to the period, held that a Christian man was unconcerned  with fate. He began once more to draw to him the bows and spears of the  broken levies of the western shires, especially the men of Somerset; and  in the spring of 878 he flung them at the lines before the fenced camp  of the victorious Danes at Ethandune. His sudden assault was as  successful as that at Ashdown, and it was followed by a siege which was  successful in a different and very definite sense. Guthrum, the  conqueror of England, and all his important supports, were here penned  behind their palisades, and when at last they surrendered the Danish  conquest had come to an end. Guthrum was baptized, and the Treaty of  Wedmore secured the clearance of Wessex. The modern reader will smile at  the baptism, and turn with greater interest to the terms of the treaty.  In this acute attitude the modern reader will be vitally and hopelessly  wrong. He must support the tedium of frequent references to the  religious element in this part of English history, for without it there  would never have been any English history at all. And nothing could  clinch this truth more than the case of the Danes. In all the facts that  followed, the baptism of Guthrum is really much more important than the  Treaty of Wedmore. The treaty itself was a compromise, and even as such  did not endure; a century afterwards a Danish king like Canute was  really ruling in England. But though the Dane got the crown, he did not  get rid of the cross. It was precisely Alfred's religious exaction that  remained unalterable. And Canute himself is actually now only remembered  by men as a witness to the futility of merely pagan power; as the king  who put his own crown upon the image of Christ, and solemnly surrendered  to heaven the Scandinavian empire of the sea.          V    ST. EDWARD AND THE NORMAN KINGS      The reader may be surprised at the disproportionate importance given to  the name which stands first in the title of this chapter.

They were like the cherubs  of the anecdote, who had--morally, at any rate--nothing to whack! I  remember feeling with Miles in especial as if he had had, as it were, no  history. We expect of a small child a scant one, but there was in  this beautiful little boy something extraordinarily sensitive, yet  extraordinarily happy, that, more than in any creature of his age I have  seen, struck me as beginning anew each day. He had never for a second  suffered. I took this as a direct disproof of his having really been  chastised. If he had been wicked he would have \"caught\" it, and I should  have caught it by the rebound--I should have found the trace. I found  nothing at all, and he was therefore an angel. He never spoke of his  school, never mentioned a comrade or a master; and I, for my part, was  quite too much disgusted to allude to them. Of course I was under the  spell, and the wonderful part is that, even at the time, I perfectly  knew I was. But I gave myself up to it; it was an antidote to any  pain, and I had more pains than one. I was in receipt in these days of  disturbing letters from home, where things were not going well. But with  my children, what things in the world mattered? That was the question  I used to put to my scrappy retirements. I was dazzled by their  loveliness.    There was a Sunday--to get on--when it rained with such force and for so  many hours that there could be no procession to church; in consequence  of which, as the day declined, I had arranged with Mrs. Grose that,  should the evening show improvement, we would attend together the late  service. The rain happily stopped, and I prepared for our walk, which,  through the park and by the good road to the village, would be a matter  of twenty minutes. Coming downstairs to meet my colleague in the hall,  I remembered a pair of gloves that had required three stitches and that  had received them--with a publicity perhaps not edifying--while I sat  with the children at their tea, served on Sundays, by exception, in that  cold, clean temple of mahogany and brass, the \"grown-up\" dining room.  The gloves had been dropped there, and I turned in to recover them.  The day was gray enough, but the afternoon light still lingered, and it  enabled me, on crossing the threshold, not only to recognize, on a chair  near the wide window, then closed, the articles I wanted, but to become  aware of a person on the other side of the window and looking straight  in. One step into the room had sufficed; my vision was instantaneous;  it was all there. The person looking straight in was the person who had  already appeared to me. He appeared thus again with I won't say  greater distinctness, for that was impossible, but with a nearness that  represented a forward stride in our intercourse and made me, as I met  him, catch my breath and turn cold. He was the same--he was the same,  and seen, this time, as he had been seen before, from the waist up, the  window, though the dining room was on the ground floor, not going down  to the terrace on which he stood. His face was close to the glass,  yet the effect of this better view was, strangely, only to show me how  intense the former had been. He remained but a few seconds--long enough  to convince me he also saw and recognized; but it was as if I had been  looking at him for years and had known him always. Something, however,  happened this time that had not happened before; his stare into my face,  through the glass and across the room, was as deep and hard as then, but  it quitted me for a moment during which I could still watch it, see it  fix successively several other things. On the spot there came to me the  added shock of a certitude that it was not for me he had come there. He  had come for someone else.    The flash of this knowledge--for it was knowledge in the midst of  dread--produced in me the most extraordinary effect, started as I stood  there, a sudden vibration of duty and courage. I say courage because  I was beyond all doubt already far gone. I bounded straight out of the  door again, reached that of the house, got, in an instant, upon the  drive, and, passing along the terrace as fast as I could rush, turned  a corner and came full in sight. But it was in sight of nothing now--my  visitor had vanished. I stopped, I almost dropped, with the real relief  of this; but I took in the whole scene--I gave him time to reappear. I  call it time, but how long was it? I can't speak to the purpose today  of the duration of these things. That kind of measure must have left me:  they couldn't have lasted as they actually appeared to me to last. The  terrace and the whole place, the lawn and the garden beyond it, all I  could see of the park, were empty with a great emptiness. There were  shrubberies and big trees, but I remember the clear assurance I felt  that none of them concealed him. He was there or was not there: not  there if I didn't see him. I got hold of this; then, instinctively,  instead of returning as I had come, went to the window. It was  confusedly present to me that I ought to place myself where he had  stood. I did so; I applied my face to the pane and looked, as he had  looked, into the room. As if, at this moment, to show me exactly what  his range had been, Mrs. Grose, as I had done for himself just before,  came in from the hall. With this I had the full image of a repetition of  what had already occurred. She saw me as I had seen my own visitant; she  pulled up short as I had done; I gave her something of the shock that  I had received. She turned white, and this made me ask myself if I had  blanched as much. She stared, in short, and retreated on just MY lines,  and I knew she had then passed out and come round to me and that I  should presently meet her. I remained where I was, and while I waited  I thought of more things than one. But there's only one I take space to  mention. I wondered why SHE should be scared.          V      Oh, she let me know as soon as, round the corner of the house, she  loomed again into view. \"What in the name of goodness is the matter--?\"  She was now flushed and out of breath.    I said nothing till she came quite near. \"With me?\" I must have made a  wonderful face. \"Do I show it?\"    \"You're as white as a sheet. You look awful.\"    I considered; I could meet on this, without scruple, any innocence. My  need to respect the bloom of Mrs. Grose's had dropped, without a rustle,  from my shoulders, and if I wavered for the instant it was not with what  I kept back. I put out my hand to her and she took it; I held her hard  a little, liking to feel her close to me. There was a kind of support in  the shy heave of her surprise. \"You came for me for church, of course,  but I can't go.\"    \"Has anything happened?\"    \"Yes. You must know now. Did I look very queer?\"    \"Through this window? Dreadful!\"    \"Well,\" I said, \"I've been frightened.\" Mrs. Grose's eyes expressed  plainly that SHE had no wish to be, yet also that she knew too well her  place not to be ready to share with me any marked inconvenience. Oh,  it was quite settled that she MUST share! \"Just what you saw from the  dining room a minute ago was the effect of that. What _I_ saw--just  before--was much worse.\"    Her hand tightened. \"What was it?\"    \"An extraordinary man. Looking in.\"    \"What extraordinary man?\"    \"I haven't the least idea.\"    Mrs. Grose gazed round us in vain. \"Then where is he gone?\"    \"I know still less.\"    \"Have you seen him before?\"    \"Yes--once. On the old tower.\"    She could only look at me harder. \"Do you mean he's a stranger?\"    \"Oh, very much!\"    \"Yet you didn't tell me?\"    \"No--for reasons. But now that you've guessed--\"    Mrs. Grose's round eyes encountered this charge. \"Ah, I haven't  guessed!\" she said very simply. \"How can I if YOU don't imagine?\"    \"I don't in the very least.\"    \"You've seen him nowhere but on the tower?\"    \"And on this spot just now.\"    Mrs. Grose looked round again. \"What was he doing on the tower?\"    \"Only standing there and looking down at me.\"    She thought a minute. \"Was he a gentleman?\"    I found I had no need to think. \"No.\" She gazed in deeper wonder. \"No.\"    \"Then nobody about the place? Nobody from the village?\"    \"Nobody--nobody. I didn't tell you, but I made sure.\"    She breathed a vague relief: this was, oddly, so much to the good. It  only went indeed a little way. \"But if he isn't a gentleman--\"    \"What IS he? He's a horror.\"    \"A horror?\"    \"He's--God help me if I know WHAT he is!\"    Mrs. Grose looked round once more; she fixed her eyes on the duskier  distance, then, pulling herself together, turned to me with abrupt  inconsequence. \"It's time we should be at church.\"    \"Oh, I'm not fit for church!\"    \"Won't it do you good?\"    \"It won't do THEM--! I nodded at the house.    \"The children?\"    \"I can't leave them now.\"    \"You're afraid--?\"    I spoke boldly. \"I'm afraid of HIM.\"    Mrs. Grose's large face showed me, at this, for the first time, the  faraway faint glimmer of a consciousness more acute: I somehow made out  in it the delayed dawn of an idea I myself had not given her and that  was as yet quite obscure to me. It comes back to me that I thought  instantly of this as something I could get from her; and I felt it to be  connected with the desire she presently showed to know more. \"When was  it--on the tower?\"    \"About the middle of the month. At this same hour.\"    \"Almost at dark,\" said Mrs. Grose.    \"Oh, no, not nearly. I saw him as I see you.\"    \"Then how did he get in?\"    \"And how did he get out?\" I laughed. \"I had no opportunity to ask him!  This evening, you see,\" I pursued, \"he has not been able to get in.\"    \"He only peeps?\"    \"I hope it will be confined to that!\" She had now let go my hand; she  turned away a little. I waited an"]]]
