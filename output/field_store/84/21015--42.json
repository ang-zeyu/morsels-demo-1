Dr. Woods' study of the royal families of Europe  is more decisive.[11]    In the latter group, the environment must be admitted--on the whole--to  be uniformly favorable. It has varied, naturally, in each case, but  speaking broadly it is certain that all the members of this group have  had the advantage of a good education, of unusual care and attention. If  such things affect achievement, then the achievements of this class  ought to be pretty generally distributed among the whole class. If  opportunity is the cause of a man's success, then most of the members of  this class ought to have succeeded, because to every one of royal blood,  the door of opportunity usually stands open. One would expect the heir  to the throne to show a better record than his younger brothers,  however, because his opportunity to distinguish himself is naturally  greater. This last point will be discussed first.    Dr. Woods divided all the individuals in his study into ten classes for  intellectuality and ten for morality, those most deficient in the  qualities being put in class 1, while the men and women of preeminent  intellectual and moral worth were put in class 10. Now if preeminent  intellect and morality were at all linked with the better chances that  an inheritor of succession has, then heirs to the throne ought to be  more plentiful in the higher grades than in the lower. Actual count  shows this not to be the case. A slightly larger percentage of  inheritors is rather to be found in the lower grades. The younger sons  have made just as good a showing as the sons who succeeded to power; as  one would expect if intellect and morality are due largely to heredity,  but as one would not expect if intellect and morality are due largely to  outward circumstances.    Are \"conditions of turmoil, stress and adversity\" strong forces in the  production of great men, as has often been claimed? There is no evidence  from facts to support that view. In the case of a few great commanders,  the times seemed particularly favorable. Napoleon, for example, could  hardly have been Napoleon had it not been for the French revolution. But  in general there have been wars going on during the whole period of  modern European history; there have always been opportunities for a  royal hero to make his appearance; but often the country has called for  many years in vain. Circumstances were powerless to produce a great man  and the nation had to wait until heredity produced him. Spain has for  several centuries been calling for genius in leadership in some lines;  but in vain. England could not get an able man from the Stuart line,  despite her need, and had to wait for William of Orange, who was a  descendant of a man of genius, William the Silent. \"Italy had to wait  fifty years in bondage for her deliverers, Cavour, Garibaldi and Victor  Emmanuel.\"    \"The upshot of it all,\" Dr. Woods decides, \"is that, as regards  intellectual life, environment is a totally inadequate explanation. If  it explains certain characters in certain instances, it always fails to  explain many more, while heredity not only explains all, or at least  90%, of the intellectual side of character in practically every  instance, but does so best when questions of environment are left out of  discussion.\"    Despite the good environment almost uniformly present, the geniuses in  royalty are not scattered over the surface of the pedigree chart, but  form isolated little groups of closely related individuals. One centers  in Frederick the Great, another in Queen Isabella of Spain, a third in  William the Silent, and a fourth in Gustavus Adolphus. Furthermore, the  royal personages who are conspicuously low in intellect and morality are  similarly grouped. Careful study of the circumstances shows nothing in  the environment that would produce this grouping of genius, while it is  exactly what a knowledge of heredity leads one to expect.    In the next place, do the superior members of royalty have  proportionately more superior individuals among their close relatives,  as was found to be the case among the Americans in the Hall of Fame? A  count shows at once that they do. The first six grades all have about an  equal number of eminent relatives, but grade 7 has more while grade 8  has more than grade 7, and the geniuses of grade 10 have the highest  proportion of nearer relatives of their own character. Surely it cannot  be supposed that a relative of a king in grade 8 has on the average a  much less favorable environment than a relative of a king in grade 10.  Is it not fair, then, to assume that this relative's greater endowment  in the latter case is due to heredity?    Conditions are the same, whether males or females be considered. The  royal families of Europe offer a test case because for them the  environment is nearly uniformly favorable. A study of them shows great  mental and moral differences between them, and critical evidence  indicates that these differences are largely due to differences in  heredity. Differences of opportunity do not appear to be largely  responsible for the achievements of the individuals.    But, it is sometimes objected, opportunity certainly is responsible for  the appearance of much talent that would otherwise never appear. Take  the great increase in the number of scientific men in Germany during the  last half century, for example. It can not be pretended that this is due  to an increased birth-rate of such talent; it means that the growth of  an appreciation of scientific work has produced an increased amount of  scientific talent. J. McKeen Cattell has argued this point most  carefully in his study of the families of one thousand American men of  science (_Popular Science Monthly_, May, 1915). \"A Darwin born in China  in 1809,\" he says, \"could not have become a Darwin, nor could a Lincoln  born here on the same day have become a Lincoln had there been no Civil  War. If the two infants had been exchanged there would have been no  Darwin in America and no Lincoln in England.\" And so he continues,  urging that in the production of scientific men, at least, education is  more important than eugenics.    This line of argument contains a great deal of obvious truth, but is  subject to a somewhat obvious objection, if it is pushed too far. It is  certainly true that the exact field in which a man's activities will  find play is largely determined by his surroundings and education. Young  men in the United States are now becoming lawyers or men of science, who  would have become ministers had they been born a century or two ago. But  this environmental influence seems to us a minor one, for the man who is  highly gifted in some one line is usually, as all the work of  differential psychology shows, gifted more than the average in many  other lines. Opportunity decides in just what field his life work shall  lie; but he would be able to make a success in a number of fields.  Darwin born in America would probably not have become the Darwin we  know, but it is not to be supposed that he would have died a \"mute,  inglorious Milton\": it is not likely that he would have failed to make  his mark in some line of human activity. Dr. Cattell's argument, then,  while admissible, can not properly be urged against the fact that  ability is mainly dependent on inheritance.    We need not stop with the conclusion that equality of training or  opportunity is unable to level the inborn differences between men. We  can go even farther, and produce evidence to show that equality of  training _increases the differences_ in results achieved.    This evidence is obtained by measuring the effects of equal amounts of  exercise of a function upon individual differences in respect to  efficiency in it. Suppose one should pick out, at random, eight  children, and let them do problems in multiplication for 10 minutes.  After a number of such trials, the three best might average 39 correct  solutions in the 10 minutes, and the three poorest might average 25  examples. Then let them continue the work, until each one of them has  done 700 examples. Here is equality in training; does it lead to uniform  results?    Dr. Starch made the actual test which we have outlined and found that  the three best pupils gained on the average 45 in the course of doing  700 examples; while the three poorest gained only 26 in the same course  of time.    Similar tests have been made of school children in a number of  instances, and have shown that equality of training fails to bring about  equality of performance. All improve to some extent; but those who are  naturally better than their comrades usually become better still, when  conditions for all are the same. E. L. Thorndike gives[12] the following  tabular statement of a test he conducted:    THE EFFECT OF EQUAL AMOUNTS OF PRACTICE UPON INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES  IN THE MENTAL MULTIPLICATION OF A THREE-PLACE BY A THREE-PLACE  NUMBER                                               Amount done           Percentage of                                           per unit of           correct figures                                           time                  in answers                                          Hours of Practice                                        |                                        |   First 5 Examples   First 5 Examples                                        |   |                  |                                        |   |    Last 5 or 10  |   Last 5 or 10                                        |   |    Examples      |   Examples                                        |   |    |             |   |                                        |   |    |   Gain      |   |   Gain      Initial highest five individuals   5.1  85  147  61       70  78   18      \"      next   five     \"         5.1  56"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19562"],[0,"Napoleon and the Queen of Prussia (#6)"],[1,"revile us!\"    \"Who will dare to do so?\" exclaimed the youth, in an outburst of  generous anger. \"Do you forget, then, that you are in Germany, and that  you have shed your blood for your country? Your German brethren will not  deride you; they will not rejoice at your sufferings; they will hope  with you for a better and more fortunate day when you will get even with  that insolent and hateful enemy, for the battles of Jena and Auerstadt.\"    \"Pray to God, my young friend, that that day may speedily dawn!\" said  Count Pueckler, heaving a sigh.    \"Pray!\" ejaculated the young man, impetuously. \"In times like ours it is  not sufficient to pray and to hope for divine assistance; we ought  rather to act and toil, and, instead of folding our hands, arm them  either with the sword or with the dagger.\"    \"With the dagger?\" asked Schill. \"The dagger is the weapon of  assassins.\"    \"Was Moeros an assassin because he wanted to stab Dionysius the tyrant?\"  asked the youth. \"Was he not rather a generous and high-minded man, whom  our great Schiller deemed worthy of becoming the hero of one of his  finest poems? When the fatherland is in danger, every weapon is sacred,  and every way lawful which a bold heart desires to pursue, to deliver  the country.\"    \"Well, I see already that your heart will choose the right, and not  shrink back from dangers,\" said Pueckler, kindly. \"But, in the first  place, tell us which way you are now going to take, that we may know  whether we shall be allowed to accompany you or not.\"    \"I come from Erfurt, where my parents are living,\" said the young man;  \"last night I was at Weimar, and now I am going to do what I have sworn  a solemn oath to my father to do. I am on my way to Leipsic.\"    \"And may I inquire what you are going to do in Leipsic?\"    The young man was silent, and a flaming blush mantled for a moment his  delicate, innocent face. \"According to my father's wishes, I shall  become there a merchant's apprentice,\" he said, in a low and embarrassed  voice.    \"What! Feeling so generous an enthusiasm for the fatherland and its  soldiers, you want to become a merchant?\" asked Schill, in surprise.    The youth raised his blue eyes to him; they were filled with tears.    \"I am ordered to become a merchant,\" he said in a low voice. \"My father  is a pious preacher, and hates and detests warfare; he says it is sinful  for men to raise their weapons against their brethren, as though they  were wild beasts, against which you cannot defend yourself but by  killing them. My mother, in former days, became familiar with the  horrors of war; she fears, therefore, lest her only son should fall prey  to them, and wishes to protect him from such a fate. With bitter tears,  with folded hands, nay, almost on her knees, she implored me to desist  from my purpose of becoming a soldier, and not to break her heart with  grief and anguish. My mother begged and wept, my father scolded and  threatened, and thus I was obliged to yield and be a dutiful son. Three  days ago my father administered the sacrament to me, and I swore an oath  to him at the altar to remain faithful to the avocation he had selected  for me, and never to become a soldier!\"    He paused, and the tears which had filled his eyes rolled like pearls  over his cheeks.    \"Poor friend!\" murmured Pueckler.    \"Poor brother!\" said Schill, indignantly. \"To be doomed to wield the  yardstick in place of the sword! How can a father be so cruel as to make  his son take such a pledge at the present time?\"    \"My father is not cruel,\" said the youth, gently; \"his only aim is my  happiness, but he wishes to bring it about in his own way, and not in  mine. It behooves a son to yield and obey. Accordingly, I shall not  become a soldier, but God knows whether it will be conducive to my  happiness. Many a one has already been driven to commit a crime by his  despair at having chosen an unsuitable avocation. But let us speak no  more of myself,\" he added, shaking his head indignantly, as if he wanted  to drive the tears from his eyes; \"let us speak no more of my petty,  miserable grief, but of your great sorrow, which all Germany shares with  you. You know now every thing concerning my affairs, and it only remains  for me to mention my name. It is Staps; 'Frederick Staps' will be my  firm one day, if I should live to see it.\"    \"Your name is Frederick, like that of Prussia's great king,\" said  Schill, comfortingly, \"and who knows whether you will not one day become  a great soldier like him?\"    \"But I have told you already that I have sworn at the altar never to  become a soldier,\" said Frederick Staps, sighing. \"I shall never break  the oath I have sworn to my father, nor the one either which I have  sworn to myself!\"    \"The oath that you will become a good and honest man, I suppose?\" asked  Pueckler.    \"It is unnecessary to take such an oath, because that is a matter of  course,\" said Frederick Staps, quickly. \"I swore another oath, but  nobody but God must know it. When the time has come, you shall be  informed of it. Do not forget my name, and when you hear from me one  day, remember this hour and the tears you saw me shed for being  compelled to choose an avocation that is repugnant to me.\"    \"And in order to remember us, you must know who we are,\" exclaimed Count  Pueckler, stating his name.    \"And my name is Schill,\" said the lieutenant. \"We fought at Auerstadt  and Jena, and are now wandering about, and seeking for a place where we  may spend the coming night.\"    \"You will find it in the village in the rear of the wood,\" said  Frederick Staps. \"Come, I will guide you back to the village and to the  country parson, to whom I have on my way just presented my father's  respects. He is a good and generous man. You will be kindly received and  nursed by him and his wife; and if French soldiers should come to his  house, he would not betray, but conceal you.\"    \"Oh, what delightful words you have just uttered!\" exclaimed Schill,  joyously. \"Blessed be your lips which have announced to us that we shall  be saved, for, let me tell you, we should prefer death to French  captivity!\"    \"I understand that,\" said Frederick Staps, quietly. \"Come, I will guide  you thither.\"    \"And we accept your offer, as friends ought to accept that of a friend,\"  said Count Pueckler. \"We do not say: 'We cause you trouble and loss of  time; let us therefore try to find our way alone;' but we say: 'In these  days of affliction we are all brethren, and we must rely on each other's  assistance.' Come, therefore, brother, and be our guide.\"    They walked slowly toward the small wood from which Staps had issued.    \"You stated you had been in Weimar, and spent a night there,\" asked  Count Pueckler. \"How does the place look--what do people say, and who is  there?\"    \"It looks like a pandemonium,\" replied Staps. \"Nothing is to be heard  but curses, shouts, threats, and screams: nothing to be seen but faces  pale with terror, and fleeing from the pursuing soldiers. The streets  are crowded with men, wagons, and horses. The inhabitants want to leave  the city; they know not whither to escape, and are forced back at the  gates by French soldiers making their entry, or by vehicles filled with  wounded.\"    \"And how is it at the palace? The duchess has fled from the wrath of the  conqueror, I suppose?\"    \"No, the duchess has remained to beg Napoleon to have mercy on her state  and her husband.\"    \"But is Napoleon already in Weimar?\"    \"Yes; he came over from Jena this morning. The duchess received him at  the foot of the palace staircase, and did not avert her eyes from his  angry and haughty glances, but looked at him with the proud calmness of  a noble German lady. 'You have not fled, then?' asked Napoleon, harshly.  'Then you do not fear my anger at the senseless and hostile conduct of  your husband?' The duchess looked quietly at him. 'You see, sire, I have  remained because I have confided in your generosity, and wished to  intercede for my husband and my people.' Napoleon looked at her during a  long pause, and her quiet dignity seemed to impress him very favorably.  'That was well done,' he said at last, 'and for your sake, and because  you have reposed confidence in me, I will forgive your husband.'[5] I do  not know what occurred afterward, for I left the palace when Napoleon  had retired to the rooms reserved for his personal use. My cousin, who  is lady's maid of the duchess, told me what I have just related to you.\"    [Footnote 5: Napoleon's own words.--Vide \"Memoires de Constant,\" vol.  iv., and \"History of Napoleon,\" by * * * r, vol. ii., p. 109.]    \"And you did not hear any thing about our king and his consort?\"    \"Both are said to be on the way to Magdeburg, where they will remain, if  the pursuing enemy will permit them. Napoleon's hatred and wrath are not  yet satiated, and his latest bulletin is written in the same vulgar  guard-room style as all the recent manifestoes in which he dares to  revile the noble and beautiful queen.\"    \"Then another bulletin has appeared?\"    \"It was just distributed among the troops when I left Weimar. A soldier,  whom I asked for his copy, gave it to me. Do you wish to read it?\"    \"Read it to us,\" said Count Pueckler. \"Let us rest a little in the shade  of these trees, for I confess I feel greatly exhausted, and my feet  refuse to carry me any farther. And how do you feel, comrade?\"    \"Do you believe,\" asked Schill, in a faint voice, \"do you believe that I  should not have given vent to my anger at the impudence of that Corsican  who dares to revile our noble queen, if I had had sufficient strength to  speak? Let us sit down and rest. See, there is a splendid old oak. Let  us take breath under its shade.\"    They walked toward a large oak, which stood at the entrance of the wood,  and the foot of which was overgrown with fragrant green moss. Assisted  by Staps, the two officers seated themselves, and the roots, "]]]
