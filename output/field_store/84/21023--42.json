Take them.\"    Danilo opened the chest and took out his own five bags of gold.    \"Is that all?\" he asked.    [Illustration: _The Magic Pitcher_]    \"Yes, that is all.\"    Danilo gave her some of the red grape conserve and of course, instead of  the horns already on her head falling off, more grew on.    \"You're not telling me the truth,\" Danilo said, \"and I can't cure you.  There's no use my treating you further.\"    He turned to go and Peerless Beauty, in great fright, begged him to  stay.    \"I do remember another misdeed,\" she confessed. \"I took by trickery a  magic pitcher from the same foolish young man.\"    She gave Danilo the pitcher and he hid it in his shirt.    \"Is that all?\"    \"Yes, that is all.\"    Danilo gave her some more of the red grape conserve and, of course, more  horns grew out on her head. Then he pretended to get angry.    \"How can you expect to be cured when you don't tell me the truth? I told  you I could not cure you unless you confessed all!\"    Peerless Beauty wanted much to keep the magic cap but when the strange  physician thundered and scowled and threatened again to leave her, more  horned than ever, she acknowledged that she had taken the cap, too, and  handed it over.    This time Danilo gave her some of the white grape conserve and as soon  as she had eaten it all the horns fell off and her head shimmered and  shone as of old with her beautiful hair.    Then Danilo told her who he was and at once the maiden sought to ensnare  him again with her wiles.    \"What a wonderful man you are, Danilo! I could love you now if you loved  me, but I know of course that you will never love me again after the  cruel way I have treated you!\"    \"But I do love you!\" Danilo cried. \"I do love you!\"    \"No, you don't!\" she said, and she pretended to weep. \"If you did love  me, you'd tell me where you found those red grapes and what this magic  conserve is made of. But of course you don't love me enough to tell me.\"    Because she looked more beautiful than ever with the tears on her lovely  cheeks, Danilo was about to tell her what she wanted to know when he  remembered the old woman's warning. That was enough. He hardened his  heart and declared:    \"No! I'll never tell you! Do you hear me: I'll never tell you!\"    She wept and implored him and used all her wiles, but Danilo remembering  the past was firm. And presently he had the reward that a man always has  when he's firm, for as soon as it was evident that she could no longer  befool him, the evil enchantment that bound her broke with a snap and  Peerless Beauty became a human maiden as gentle and sweet and loving as  she was beautiful.    She knelt at Danilo's feet and humbly begged his pardon and promised, if  he would still marry her, to make him the most dutiful wife in the  world.    So Danilo married Peerless Beauty and with the servants of the magic  pitcher transported her and her castle and her riches together with the  old woman who had befriended them both to his own native village. There  he still lives happy and prosperous.    His uncle and all the old men in the village take credit to themselves  for the success of his adventures.    \"It is due entirely to us,\" they tell any one who will listen to them,  \"that Danilo went out in search of Peerless Beauty in the first place.  When he came to us and asked our advice we said to him: 'Go, by all  means! You're young and brave and of course you'll win her!' If we  hadn't urged him to go, he would probably have settled down here at  home, married some quiet village girl, and never be heard of again!\"    That's how the old men talk now, but we know what they really did say at  the time!    Yet after all that doesn't matter. All that matters is that Danilo and  Peerless Beauty love each other and are happy.    [Illustration]          THE PIGEON'S BRIDE      [Illustration]    _The Story of a Princess Who Kissed and Told_          THE PIGEON'S BRIDE      There was once a King who had an only daughter. She was as lovely as a  princess ought to be and by the time she reached a marriageable age the  fame of her beauty had spread far and wide over all the world.  Neighboring kings and even distant ones were already sending envoys to  her father's court begging permission to offer their sons as suitors to  the Princess's hand. As he had no son of his own the Princess's father  was delighted that the day was fast approaching when he might have a  son-in-law, and long before even the name of any particular prince was  discussed the Princess's mother had planned the wedding down to its last  detail.    The Princess alone was uninterested.    \"I'm not ready to get married yet,\" she'd say to her parents every day  when they'd begin telling her about the various princes who were anxious  to gain her favor. \"Why such haste? I'm young and there's plenty of  time. Besides, just now I'm too busy with my embroidery to be bothered  with a crowd of young men.\"    With that, before the King could reprove her, the Princess would throw  her arms about his neck, kiss him under the corner of his mustache, and  go flying off to the tower-room where she had her embroidery frame.    Her mother, the Queen, was much upset by the Princess's attitude.    \"In my youth,\" she said, \"girls were not like this. We were brought up  to think that courtship and marriage were the most important events in  our lives. I don't know what's getting into the heads of the young girls  nowadays!\"    But the King, who was still smiling from the tickling little kiss which  the Princess had planted under the corner of his mustache, always  answered:    \"Tut! Tut! We needn't worry yet! Take my word for it when some  particular young man comes along she'll be interested fast enough!\"    At this the Queen, ending the discussion every day with the same words,  would shake her head and declare:    \"I tell you it isn't natural for a girl to be more interested in  embroidery than in a long line of handsome young suitors!\"    The Princess was interested in her embroidery--there's no doubt about  that. She spent every moment she could in the tower-room, working and  singing. The tower was high up among the treetops. It was reached by  winding stairs so narrow and so many that no one any older than the  Princess would care to climb them. The Princess flew up them like a  bird, scarcely pausing for breath. At the top of the stairs was a  trap-door which was the only means of entrance into the tower-room. Once  in the tower-room with the bolt of the trap-door securely fastened, the  Princess was safe from interruption and could work away at her  embroidery to her heart's content. The tower had windows on all sides,  so the Princess as she sat at her embroidery frame could look out north,  east, south, and west.    The clouds sailed by in the sky, the wind blew and at once the leaves in  the treetops began murmuring and whispering among themselves, and the  birds that went flying all over the world would often alight on some  branch near the tower and sing to the Princess as she worked or chatter  some exciting story that she could almost understand.    \"What!\" the Princess would think to herself as she looked out north,  east, south, and west. \"Leave my tower and my beautiful embroidery to  become the wife of some conceited young man! Never!\"    From this remark you can understand perfectly well that the particular  young man of whom her father spoke had not yet come along. And I'm sure  you'll also know that shutting herself up in the tower-room and bolting  the trap-door was not going to keep him away when it was time for him to  come. Yet I don't believe that you'd have recognized him when he did  come any more than the Princess did. This is how it happened:    One afternoon when as usual she was working at her embroidery and  singing as she worked, suddenly there was a flutter of wings at the  eastern window and a lovely Pigeon came flying into the room. It circled  three times about the Princess's head and then alighted on the  embroidery frame. The Princess reached out her hand and the bird,  instead of taking fright, allowed her to stroke its gleaming neck. Then  she took it gently in her hands and fondled it to her bosom, kissing its  bill and smoothing its plumage with her lips.    \"You beautiful thing!\" she cried. \"How I love you!\"    \"If you really love me,\" the Pigeon said, \"have a bowl of milk here at  this same hour to-morrow and then we'll see what we'll see.\"    With that the bird spread its wings and flew out the western window.    The Princess was so excited that for the rest of the afternoon she  forgot her embroidery.    \"Did the Pigeon really speak?\" she asked herself as she stood staring  out the western window, \"or have I been dreaming?\"    The next day when she climbed the winding stairs she went slowly for she  carried in her hands a brimming bowl of milk.    \"Of course it won't come again!\" she said, and she made herself sit down  quietly before the embroidery frame and work just as though she expected  nothing.    But exactly at the same hour as the day before there was a flutter of  wings at the eastern window, the sound of a gentle _coo! coo!_ and there  was the Pigeon ready to be loved and caressed.    \"You beautiful creature!\" the Princess cried, kissing its coral beak and  smoothing its neck with her lips, \"how I love you! And see, I have  brought you the bowl of milk that you asked for!\"    The bird flew over to the bowl, poised for a moment on its brim, then  splashed into the milk as though to take a bath.    The Princess laughed and clapped her hands and then, as she looked, she  saw a strange thing happen. The bird's feathers opened like a shirt and  out of the feather shirt stepped a handsome youth.

Six of my best journeymen will work all night at  the clothes; and even should his majesty send for you by ten, I  trust that you will be able to make a proper appearance before him,  though at present I cannot guarantee that some trifling alteration  will not be found necessary, when you try the uniforms on.\"    Fergus supped with the marshal, who had now time to ask him many  more questions about his home life, and the state of things in  Scotland.    \"'Tis a sore pity,\" he said, \"that we Scotchmen and Irishmen, who  are to be found in such numbers in every European army, are not all  arrayed under the flag of our country. Methinks that the time is  not far distant when it will be so. I am, as you know, a Jacobite;  but there is no shutting one's eyes to the fact that the cause is a  lost one. The expedition of James the Third, and still more that of  Charles Edward, have caused such widespread misery among the  Stuarts' friends that I cannot conceive that any further attempt of  the same kind will be made.    \"In fact, there is no one to make it. The prince has lost almost  all his friends, by his drunken habits and his quarrelsome and  overbearing disposition. He has gone from court to court as a  suppliant, but has everywhere alienated the sympathies of those  most willing to befriend him. I may say that as a King of England  and Scotland he is now impossible, and his own habits have done  more to ruin his cause than even the defeat of Culloden. There are  doubtless many, in both countries, who consider themselves  Jacobites, but it is a matter of sentiment and not of passion.    \"At any rate, there is no head to the cause now, and cannot  possibly be unless the prince had a son; therefore, for at least  five-and-twenty years, the cause is dead. Even if the prince leaves  an heir, it would be absurd to entertain the idea that, after the  Stuarts have been expelled from England a hundred years, any  Scotchman or Englishman would be mad enough to risk life and  property to restore them to the throne.    \"Another generation and the Hanoverians will have become  Englishmen, and the sentiment against them as foreigners will have  died out. Then there will be no reason why Scotchmen and Irishmen  should any longer go abroad, and all who wish it will be able to  find employment in the army of their own country.    \"This, indeed, might have happened long before this, had the  Georges forgotten that they were Electors of Hanover as well as  Kings of Great Britain; and had surrounded themselves with  Englishmen instead of filling their courts with Germans, whose  arrogance and greed made them hateful to Englishmen, and kept  before their eyes the fact that their kings were foreigners.  Hanover is a source of weakness instead of strength to Great  Britain, and its loss would be an unmixed benefit to her; for as  long as it remains under the British crown, so long must Britain  play a part in European politics--a part, too, sometimes absolutely  opposed to the interests of the country at large.\"    After supper was over, two general officers dropped in for a chat  with the marshal. He introduced Fergus to them, and the latter then  retired and joined the little party of Scottish officers at  Lindsay's quarters. Lindsay introduced him to them, and he was very  heartily received, and it was not until very late that they turned  into bed.    At half-past eight next morning Fergus went to the tailor's, and  found that he had kept his promise, to the letter. The uniforms  fitted admirably, and were complete in every particular. As Marshal  Keith had, the evening before, informed him that he had received  his appointment to the 3rd Royal Dragoon Guards, he had no  hesitation in putting on a uniform when, a quarter of an hour  later, it arrived at his quarters. Donald went out and fetched a  hairdresser, who combed, powdered, and tied up his hair in proper  military fashion. When he left, Donald took him in hand, attired  him in his uniform, showed him the exact angle at which his belt  should be worn, and the military salute that should be given.    It was fortunate that he was in readiness, for at half-past ten  Lindsay came in with a message from the marshal that he was, at  once, to repair to the palace, with or without a uniform; as the  king had sent to say that he should visit Keith at eleven, and that  he could then present his cousin to him.    It could not be said that Fergus felt comfortable, as he started  from his quarters. Accustomed to a loose dress and light shoes, he  felt stiff and awkward in his tight garments, closely buttoned up,  and his heavy jack boots; and he found himself constrained to walk  with the same stiffness and precision that had amused him in the  Prussian officers, on the previous day.    \"So you have got your uniform,\" the marshal said, as Fergus entered  and saluted, as Donald had instructed him. \"It becomes you well,  lad, and the king will be pleased at seeing you in it. He could not  have blamed you had it not been ready, for the time has been short,  indeed; but he will like to see you in it, and will consider that  it shows alacrity and zeal.\"    Presently the door opened and, as the marshal rose and saluted,  Fergus knew that it was the king. He had never had the king  described to him, and had depicted to himself a stiff and somewhat  austere figure; but the newcomer was somewhat below middle height,  with a kindly face, and the air rather of a sober citizen than of a  military martinet. The remarkable feature of his face were his  eyes, which were very large and blue, with a quick piercing glance  that seemed to read the mind of anyone to whom he addressed  himself. So striking were they that the king, when he went about  the town in disguise, was always obliged to keep his eyes somewhat  downcast; as, however well made up, they would have betrayed him at  once, had he looked fixedly at anyone who had once caught sight of  his face.    \"Good morning, marshal!\" he said, in a friendly tone. \"So this is  my last recruit--a goodly young fellow, truly.\"      [Illustration: The king walked round Fergus as if he were  examining a lay figure]      He walked round Fergus as if he were examining a lay figure,  closely scrutinizing every article of his appointment, and then  gave a nod of approbation.    \"Always keep yourself like that, young sir. An officer is unfit to  take charge of men, unless he can set an example of exactness in  dress. If a man is precise in little things, he will be careful in  other matters.    \"Although he is going to be your aide-de-camp, Keith, he had better  go to his regimental barracks, and drill for a few hours a day, if  you can spare him.\"    \"He shall certainly do so, sire. I spoke to his colonel yesterday  evening, and told him that I would myself take the lad down to him,  this morning, and present him to his comrades of the regiment. It  would be well if he could have six months' drilling, for an  aide-de-camp should be well acquainted with the meaning of the  orders he carries; as he is, in that case, far less likely to make  mistakes than he would otherwise be. Your majesty has nothing more  to say to him?\"    \"Nothing. I hope he is not quarrelsome. But there, it is of no use  my hoping that, Keith; for your Scotchman is a quarrelsome creature  by nature, at least so it seems to me. Of the duels that, in spite  of my orders, take place--I know you all try to hide them from me,  Keith--I hear of a good many between these hot-headed countrymen of  yours and my Prussian officers.\"    \"With deference to your majesty, I don't think that that proves  much. It would be as fair to say that these duels show how  aggressive are your Prussian officers towards my quiet and patient  countrymen.    \"Now you can retire, cornet.\"    Fergus gave the military salute, and retired to the anteroom.    \"Have you passed muster?\" Lindsay asked with a laugh.    \"Yes; at least the king found nothing wrong. He was not at all what  I thought he would be.\"    \"No; I was astonished myself, the first time I saw him. He is a  capital fellow, in spite of his severity in matters of military  etiquette and discipline. He is very kind hearted, does not stand  at all upon his dignity, bears no malice, and very soon remits  punishment he has given in the heat of the moment. I think that he  regards us Scots as being a people for whom allowances must be  made, on the ground of our inborn savagery and ignorance of  civilized customs. He does not mind plain speaking on our part and,  if in the humour, will talk with us much more familiarly than he  would do to a Prussian officer.\"    In a few minutes the bell in the next room sounded. Lindsay went  in.    \"Are the horses at the door?\"    \"Yes, marshal.\"    \"Then we will mount at once. I told the colonel of the 3rd that I  should be at the barracks by twelve o'clock, unless the king wanted  me on his business.\"    Fergus had already put on his helmet, and he and Lindsay followed  Keith downstairs. In the courtyard were the horses, which were held  by orderlies.    \"That is yours, Fergus,\" Keith said. \"It has plenty of bone and  blood, and should carry you well for any distance.\"    Fergus warmly thanked the marshal for the gift. It was a very fine  horse, and capable of carrying double his weight. It was fully  caparisoned with military bridle and saddle and horse cloth.    They mounted at once. The orderlies ran to their horses, which were  held by a mounted trooper, and the four fell in behind the  officers. Lindsay and Fergus rode half a length behind the marshal,  but the latter had some difficulty in keeping his horse in that  position.    The marshal smiled.    \"It does not understand playing second fiddle, Fergus. You see, it  has been accustomed to head the"]]]
