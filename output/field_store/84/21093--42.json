Comte Jean, however, had passed a very different night; for once, the  whisperings of ambition had overcome even his natural indifference and  carelessness, and tired of tossing upon a sleepless pillow, he arose  at the first break of day, reproached me for slumbering so long, and  allowed me neither peace nor rest till I joined him dressed for our  journey. At length, we set out according to our agreement with Lebel; I  was closely muffled up in my large _caleche_--the carriage rolled along  till we reached Versailles, where we had for the last month engaged a  lodging, which might be useful to us in all events; we alighted, and  after vainly seeking a few moments' repose, proceeded on foot to Lebel,  in whose apartments we were to attire ourselves in a suitable manner.    \"You are welcome,\" said the comte, \"pray consider yourself as at home.\"    \"I accept your augury,\" replied I, \"it would be amusing enough to find  that my young prophet had predicted rightly.\"    \"Well then,\" said my conductor, laughing, \"I recommend you to manage a  slip on the staircase, it would be taking possession after the manner of  the ancients.\"    \"No, no, I thank you,\" answered I; \"no falls if you please, they are not  propitious in France.\"    Whilst we were thus speaking, we were crossing a long suite of chambers,  and reached the one at which we were expected. We knocked cautiously  at a door, which was opened to us with equal caution. Scarcely had we  entered, than Lebel came eagerly forward to receive us.    \"Ah, madame!\" cried he, \"I began to fear you might not come, you have  been looked for with an impatience--\"    \"Which can hardly equal mine,\" interrupted I; \"for you were prepared  for your visitor, whilst I have yet to learn who is the friend that so  kindly desires to see me.\"    \"It is better it should be so,\" added Lebel; \"do not seek either to  guess or discover more, than that you will here meet with some cheerful  society, friends of mine, who will sup at my house, but with whom  circumstances prevent my sitting down at table.\"    \"How!\" said I, with affected surprise, \"not sup with us?\"    \"Even so,\" replied Lebel; and then added with a laugh, \"_He_ and I sit  down to supper together! What an idea! No! you will find that just as  the guests are about to sit down at table, I shall suddenly be called  out of the room, and shall only return at the close of the repast.\"    All this was but of small import to me. Nevertheless, I affected to  regret the unavoidable absence of Lebel. In fact, I believe that the  first breath inspired at court is fraught with falsehood and deceit,  entirely destructive to every feeling of natural candor.    Lebel, with the most ceremonious gallantry, conducted me to a private  dressing-room, where I found several females waiting to assist me at  my toilet; I abandoned myself to their cares, which were, indeed, most  skilfully exercised in my behalf. They wrought wonders in my appearance,  bathing me after the Eastern fashion, adorning my hair and person, till  I issued from their hands blooming and beauteous as an houri.    When I returned to the room in which Lebel was expecting me, his  surprise was almost overpowering.    \"You are, indeed,\" exclaimed he, \"the new sun which is to rise upon  Versailles.\"    \"Excellent!\" cried I, laughing extravagantly, \"but like the planet you  are pleased to compare me with, I must reserve my splendid rising till I  have obtained fresh powers from the aid of night.\"*         *_Mais avant de me lever il faut que je me couche_,       is the witty reply in the original, but which it is       impossible to render fully and piquantly through the       dilution of a translation.--tr.    The comte entered, and joined his congratulations upon the beauty of my  appearance; all at once the hasty, sound of a bell, violently pulled,  was heard.    \"The object of your attack approaches,\" said Lebel to me, \"it would be  as well to reconnoitre a little. Remember, not a word of his rank, no  cast down, timid looks at his sovereign power; no bending of knees, or  faltering of voice.\"    The advice thus given was useless. Comte Jean, who bore the reputation  of, at least, a man of much cool impudence, was, I am certain, more  deficient than myself in courage upon the occasion, and I verily  believe, asked himself several times whether he dared appear before his  prince with one whom he was falsely asserting to be his sister-in-law.  However these thoughts might or might not have disturbed him, we  proceeded onwards till we reached the apartment where our invited  friends were expecting us; and here I will, with the reader's  permission, digress awhile, in order to say a few introductory words  respecting the four personages with whom I had the honor of supping.    And first, Louis XVth, king of France (or as he was upon the present  occasion styled the baron de Gonesse), was one of those sentimental  egotists who believed he loved the whole world, his subjects, and his  family; while in reality, the sole engrossing object was _self_.  Gifted with many personal and intellectual endowments, which might have  disputed the palm with the most lively and engaging personages of the  court, he was yet devoured by ennui, and of this he was well aware,  but his mind was made up to meet this ennui, as one of the necessary  accompaniments of royalty. Devoid of taste in literary matters, he  despised all connected with the _belles-lettres_, and esteemed men only  in proportion to the number and richness of their armorial bearings. M.  de Voltaire ranked him beneath the lowest country-squire; and the very  mention of a man of letters was terrifying to his imagination from its  disturbing the current of his own ideas; he revelled in the plenitude  of power, yet felt dissatisfied with the mere title of king. He ardently  desired to signalize himself as the first general of the age, and  prevented from obtaining this (in his opinion) highest of honors,  entertained the utmost jealousy of Frederick II, and spoke with  undisguised spleen and ill-humor of the exploits of his brother of  Prussia.    The habit of commanding, and the prompt obedience he had ever met  with, had palled upon his mind, and impressed him with feelings of  indifference for all things which thus appeared so easily obtained;  and this satiety and consequent listlessness was by many construed into  melancholy of disposition. He disliked any appearance of opposition to  his will; not that he particularly resented the opposition itself, but  he knew his own weakness, and feared lest he should be compelled to make  a show of a firmness he was conscious of not possessing. For the clergy  he entertained the most superstitious veneration; and he feared God  because he had a still greater awe and dread of the devil. In the hands  of his confessor he confidently believed was lodged the absolute power  to confer on him unlimited license to commit any or every sin. He  greatly dreaded pamphlets, satires, epigrams, and the opinion of  posterity and yet his conduct was that of a man who scoffs at the  world's judgment. This hasty sketch may with safety be taken as the  portrait of Louis XV, although much might be added; yet for the present  I will confine myself to the outline of my picture, which I shall have  frequent occasion to retouch in the course of my journal; it is my  intention to present him in all possible lights before the reader, and  I flatter myself I shall produce a perfect resemblance of the man I seek  to depict. Let us now proceed to consider the duc de Richelieu.    This nobleman, when in his seventy-second year, had preserved, even in  so advanced an age, all his former pretensions to notice; his success in  so many love affairs, a success which he never could have merited, had  rendered him celebrated; he was now a superannuated coxcomb, a wearisome  and clumsy butterfly; when however, he could be brought to exercise his  sense by remembering that he was no longer young, he became fascinating  beyond idea, from the finished ease and grace of his manner, and the  polished and piquant style of his discourse; still I speak of him as  a mere man of outward show, for the duke's attainments were certainly  superficial, and he possessed more of the jargon of a man of letters  than the sound reality. Among other proofs of consummate ignorance he  was deficient even in orthography, and was fool enough to boast of  so disgraceful a fact, as though it conferred honor on him; perhaps,  indeed, he found that the easiest way of getting over the business.    He possessed a most ignoble turn of mind; all feelings of an elevated  nature were wanting within him. A bad son, an unkind husband, and a  worse father, he could scarcely be expected to become a steady friend.  All whom he feared, he hesitated not to trample under foot; and his  favorite maxim, which he has a hundred times repeated to me, was, that  \"we should never hesitate to set our foot upon the necks of all those  who might in any way interfere with our projects--dead men [he would  further add] tell no tales!\" There was one person, nevertheless, whom he  detested and flattered at the same time, and this was Voltaire, who well  repaid him in like coin. He called the duc de Richelieu, the tyrant of  the tennis-court* (_tripot_), and the duke returned the compliment  by invariably designating him \"Scoundrel\" and \"Poetaster\"; the only  difference was that the duc de Richelieu only treated the poet thus in  _sotto voce_, whilst M. de Voltaire sought not to conceal, either in his  writings or conversation, his candid opinion of the illustrious duke  and peer; and he might justly accuse the duke of ingratitude, for he,  no doubt, owed a considerable portion of the reputation he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20839"],[0,"The Mountain Chant, A Navajo Ceremony (#6)"],[1,"fruitless  attempts to get on the rainbow. After he had enjoyed this sport  sufficiently the ye (Anglicized, gay or yay) blew another strong breath,  when at once the rainbow became as hard as ice and they both crossed it  with ease. When they reached the opposite wall of the caÃ±on QastcÃ¨Ã«lÃ§i  pointed to a very small hole in the cliff and said, \"This is the door of  my lodge; enter!\" By this time the shouts of the Ute sounded very loud  in the ears of the terrified fugitive and it seemed to him that his  pursuers must have reached the edge of the opposite cliff, where they  would not be long before they would see him; still, hard as he tried to  enter the cave, he could not succeed; the hole was not big enough for  him to put his head in. The YÃ ybichy roared with laughter and slapped  his hands together as he witnessed the abject fear and the fruitless  efforts of the Navajo. When he had laughed enough he blew on the little  hole and it spread instantly into a large orifice, through which they  both entered with ease. They passed through three rooms and stopped in  the fourth. Here QastcÃ¨Ã«lÃ§i took the bags from the back of the Navajo,  opened them, and drew from them some beautifully garnished  clothing--a pair of moccasins, a pair of long-fringed leggings, and a  shirt. He arrayed himself in these and went out, leaving the Navajo in  the cave. As soon as his rescuer was gone the fugitive heard loud noises  without and the sound of many angry voices, which continued for a long,  long time. At last they died away and were heard no more. The Ute had  tracked him to the edge of the cliff where he got on the tree; but there  they lost his trail and searched all the neighborhood to see if they  could regain it; hence the noises. When all was silent QastcÃ¨Ã«lÃ§i  returned and said, \"Your enemies have departed; you can leave in  safety.\" So, taking a tanned elk skin to cover his back and a pair of  new moccasins to protect his feet, the Navajo set out from the cave.    35. It was nightfall when he emerged. He turned his face in the  direction of his home and walked rapidly all the night. As day dawned he  began to feel hopeful; but, ere the sun rose, distant sounds, which grew  louder and louder, reached his ear. He knew them to be the voices of his  pursuers and again he became sorely afraid. He hurried on and came near  the foot of a high isolated pinnacle of rock, whose top appeared to be  inaccessible. Glancing to the summit, however, he beheld standing there  a black mountain sheep. Thinking that this singular vision was sent to  him as a sign from the yays (gods) and boded well for him, he came to  the base of the rock, when the sheep addressed him, saying: \"My  grandson, come around to the other side of the rock and you will find a  place where you may ascend.\" He went around as he was bidden and saw the  cleft in the rock, but it was too narrow for him to climb in it. Then  the sheep blew into the cleft and it spread out so wide that he entered  it easily and clambered to the summit. Here he found the sheep standing  in four tracks, marked or sunken in the rock, one hoof in each track,  and under the center of his body was a small hole in the rock. Into this  hole the sheep bade him enter; but he replied that the hole was too  small. Then the sheep blew on the hole and it spread so wide open that  both the man and the sheep entered easily and descended into the heart  of the rock. Here there were again four apartments; two of them were  blue and two were black; rainbows extended in all directions through  them. In the fourth room, which was black, the sheep left the Navajo to  rest, and departed. Soon the fugitive heard, as on the previous day,  when he lay hidden in the cave of QastcÃ¨Ã«lÃ§i, the voices of the angry  Ute calling and haranguing all around the rock, and he continued to hear  them for a very long time. Soon after the clamor ceased the sheep  returned to him to notify him that his enemies had withdrawn and that he  could set out on his journey again without fear.    36. He journeyed homeward all the night, and when daylight began to  appear he found himself on the banks of the stream where the Ute slept  the night before they reached their tents, when they bore him home a  captive. Here again he heard in the distance the voices of his pursuers  and he hastened his steps. Presently he met a little old man sitting on  the ground and cleaning cactus fruit. The old man had a sharp nose,  little bright eyes, and a small moustache growing on each side of his  upper lip. At once the Navajo recognized him as the Bushrat (_Neotoma  mexicana_). The latter asked the traveler where he came from. \"Oh, I am  just roaming around here,\" was the answer. But the rat, not satisfied,  repeated his question three times, in a manner which gave the Navajo to  understand that his answer was not credited. So at last he answered  truthfully that he was a Navajo who had been captured by the Ute, and  that he was fleeing homeward from his captors, who were at that moment  close behind him in pursuit. \"It is well,\" said the rat, \"that you have  told me this, for I think I can save you. On yonder hillside there is a  flat rock, and round about it are piled many little sticks and stones.  It is my home, and I will guide you thither.\" He led the Indian to the  rock and, showing him a small hole under it, bade him stoop low and  place his head near the hole. As the Navajo obeyed the rat blew a strong  breath on the hole, which at once opened wide enough to let the visitor  in. The rat followed immediately behind him as he entered. Inside of the  den there were an old woman, two young men, and two young women. These  constituted the family of the Bush-rat, who left the den as soon as the  stranger was safely housed. Soon the voices of the pursuing Ute were  again heard around the rock and at the mouth of the den, and the Navajo  sat a long time in silence listening to them. After a while the rat  woman said to him, \"You seem to be tired and hungry. Will you have  something to eat?\" and he answered, \"Yes; I am very hungry and would  like some food.\" On hearing this she went into one corner of her  dwelling, where were many chips and bones and shells of seeds and skins  of fruits, and she brought him some of these and offered them to him;  but at this moment the wind god whispered into his ear and warned him  not to partake of the refuse; so he said to the woman; \"My mother, I can  not eat these things.\" Then she went to another corner of the den, where  there was another pile of debris; but again the wind god prompted him  and again he refused. After this she visited in turn two other piles of  trash in the corners of her lodge and tried to make him accept it as  food, but he still rejected it. Now, while he had been sitting in the  lodge he had not failed to look around him, and he had observed a long  row of wicker jars standing at one side. At one end of the row was a  black vessel and at the other end a white vessel. When she at length  asked him, \"What food is it that you would have, my son?\" the wind god  whispered to him, \"Ask her for that which is in the jars at the end of  the row,\" and he replied, \"I will take some food from the black jar and  some from the white jar.\" She removed the stopples from the jars. From  the black vessel she took nuts of the piÃ±on and fruit of the yucca and  from the white vessel she took cherries and cactus fruit, all of which  he received in the folded corner of his elk robe. He was just about to  partake of some of the nice fruit when again he heard the low voice of  the wind god. This time it said, \"Eat not the food of the rats in the  home of the rats, if you would not become a rat; wait till you go out  to-night.\" Much, as he longed for the food, after hearing this, he  tasted it not, but held it in the fold of the elk skin. Late in the day  they were all astonished by hearing a loud rattling noise at the mouth  of the cave, and, looking in that direction, saw the end of a big stick,  which was thrust viciously from time to time into the opening and poked  around in different directions; but it was not long enough to reach to  the place where they sat. \"What is that?\" said the woman. \"Oh,\" answered  the Navajo, \"that is the Ute, who have trailed me to this hole and hope  to kill me by poking that stick in here.\" The old rat watched from a  secret place outside all the actions of the Ute, and when he came home  at night he asked his family if the stick had hurt any of them. \"We saw  only the end of it,\" they replied. He then turned to the Navajo and  said, \"Your pursuers have disappeared; you may go out without fear.\"    37. He trudged wearily on all night, and at dawn he was beside the high  volcanic rocks at ÃÃ²tsosi, another place where his captors had halted  with him. There is one place where the rocky wall is quite smooth. As he  was passing this place he heard a voice saying, \"Sh!\" He looked all  around him, but saw nothing that could have made the sound. He was about  to pass on when he again heard the voice, and, looking around, he again  saw no one. The fourth time that this happened, however, he observed in  the smooth part of the rock a door standing open and a little animal  called Kleyatcini looking out at him. As he stood gazing at the sharp  nose and the bright eyes the distant voices of his pursuers sounded  again in his ears and the little animal bade him enter and hide himself.  As the Navajo entered the Kleyatcini passed out and closed the door  behind him. The fugitive was not long in his place of concealment when  the clamor made by the foiled pursuers was again heard, but it ceased  sooner than usual. It was not yet sunset when the little animal returned  to announce that the Ute had gone from the neighborhood. When the Navajo  stepped out of the hole in the rock, Kleyatcini pointed out to him the  mountains in which his home lay and counseled him to"]]]
