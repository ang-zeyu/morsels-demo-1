He could not help it, and though his own heart was torn, commanded  that the empress should be buried to her breast in the earth and so  remain before the eyes of the world, in token of what befell those  who tried to deceive an emperor.    The next day the step-mother's wish was fulfilled. The emperor married  a second time, and again the wedding festivities lasted three days and  three nights.    But God's blessing does not rest upon unjust deeds.    The two princes found no rest in the earth. Two beautiful aspens  sprang up where they were buried, but when the step-mother saw them  she ordered them to be pulled up by the roots. The emperor, however,  said: \"Let them grow, I like to see them before the window. I never  beheld such aspens before.\"    So the trees grew, grew as no other aspens ever had grown, every day a  year's growth, every night another year's growth, but in the dawn of  morning, when the stars were paling in the sky, three years' growth in  a single moment. When three days and three nights had passed, the two  aspens were lofty trees, lifting their boughs to the emperor's window,  and when the wind stirred the branches, he listened to their rustling  all day long.    The step-mother suspected what they were, and pondered all day trying  to find some way to get rid of the trees at any cost. It was a  difficult task, but a woman's will can squeeze milk from a stone, a  woman's cunning conquers heroes--what force can not accomplish, fair  words win, and when these fail, hypocritical tears succeed.    One morning the empress sat down on the side of her husband's bed and  began to overwhelm him with loving words and tender caresses. It was  a long time before the thread broke, but at last--even emperors are  mortal!    \"Very well,\" he said, reluctantly, \"have your own way; order the  aspens to be cut down, but one must be made into a bedstead for me,  the other for you.\"    This satisfied the empress. The aspens were cut down, and before night  the beds were standing in the emperor's room.    When he lay down, he felt as if he had become a hundred times heavier,  yet he had never rested so well; but it seemed to the empress as if  she were lying on thorns and nettles, so that she could not sleep all  night long.    When the emperor had fallen asleep, the beds began to creak, and amid  this creaking the empress fancied she heard words that no one else  understood.    \"Is it hard for you, brother?\" asked one of the beds.    \"No, it isn't hard for me,\" replied the bed in which the emperor was  sleeping, \"I am happy, for my beloved father rests upon me.\"    \"It's hard for me,\" replied the other, \"for on me lies a wicked soul.\"    So the beds talked on in the empress's ears until the dawn of morning.    When daylight came, the empress planned how she could destroy the  beds. At last she ordered two bedsteads exactly like them, and when  the emperor went hunting, placed them in his room without his  knowledge; but the aspen beds, down to the very smallest splinter, she  threw into the fire.    When they were burned so entirely that not even a bit of charcoal  remained, the empress collected the ashes and scattered them to the  winds, that they might be strewn over nine countries and seas, and not  an atom find another atom through all eternity.    But she had not noticed that just when the fire was burning brightest  two sparks rose, and soaring upward, fell again into the midst of the  deep river that flowed through the empire, where they were changed  into two little fishes with golden scales, so exactly alike that  nobody could help knowing they were twin brothers.    One day the imperial fishermen went out early in the morning, and  threw their nets into the water. Just at the moment the last stars  were fading, one of the men drew up his net and beheld what he had  never seen before: two tiny fishes with golden scales.    The other fishermen assembled to see the miracle, but when they had  beheld and admired it, determined to carry the fish alive to the  emperor for a gift.    \"Don't take us there, we've just come from there, and it will be our  destruction,\" said one of the fishes.    \"But what shall I do with you?\" asked the fisherman.    \"Go and gather the dew from the leaves, let us swim in it, put us in  the sun, and don't come back again till the sunbeams have dried the  dew,\" said the second little fish.    The fisherman did as he was told, gathered the dew from the leaves,  put the little fish into it, placed them in the sun, and did not come  back till the dew was all dried up.    But what had happened! What did he see?    Two boys, handsome princes with golden hair and a golden star on their  foreheads, so exactly alike that no one who saw them could help  knowing that they were twin brothers.    The children grew very rapidly. Every day enough for a year, and every  night enough for another year, but in the dawn of morning when the  stars paled in the sky, enough for three years in a single moment.  Besides, they grew as no other children ever had grown, three times as  fast in age, strength, and wisdom. When three days and nights had  passed, they were twelve years in age, twenty-four in strength, and  thirty-six in wisdom.    \"Now let us go to our father,\" said one of the princes to the  fisherman.    The fisherman dressed the lads in beautiful clothing, and made each a  lambskin cap, which the boys drew low over their faces, that no one  might see their golden hair and the golden star on their foreheads,  and then took the princes to the imperial palace.    It was broad daylight when they arrived.    \"We want to speak to the emperor,\" said one of the princes to the  guard, who stood armed at the door of the palace.    \"That can't be done, he's at table,\" replied the soldier.    \"Just because he _is_ at table,\" said the second prince, passing  through the door.    The guards ran up and tried to drive the boys out of the court-yard,  but the boys slipped through their fingers like quicksilver. Three  paces forward, three up, and they were standing before the great hall,  where the emperor was dining with all his court.    \"We want to come in,\" said one of the princes sharply, to the servants  who stood at the door.    \"That can't be done,\" one of the lackeys answered.    \"Indeed! We'll see whether it can be done or not,\" cried the other  prince, pushing the men aside right and left.    But there were a great many lackeys, and only two princes. A tumult  and uproar arose outside, that resounded through the palace.    \"What is going on out there?\" asked the emperor angrily.    The princes stopped when they heard their father's voice.    \"Two boys are trying to enter by force,\" said an attendant,  approaching the emperor.    \"By force? Who seeks to enter my palace by force? Who are these boys?\"  cried the emperor in the same breath.    \"We know not, your majesty,\" replied the lackey, \"but there must be  something uncommon about them, for the lads are as strong as young  lions, they overpowered the guard at the gate, and have given us  plenty to do. Besides, they are proud, they don't lift their caps from  their heads.\"    The emperor flushed scarlet with rage.    \"Throw them out!\" he cried. \"Set the dogs on them.\"    \"Never mind, we will go,\" said the princes, weeping at the harsh  words, as they went down the steps again.    As they reached the gate, they were stopped by a servant, who was out  of breath from running to overtake them.    \"The emperor has commanded you to come back, the empress wants to see  you.\"    The princes hesitated, then turned, climbed the stairs, and still with  their caps on their heads appeared before the emperor.    There stood a long, wide table, at which sat all the imperial guests;  at the head was the emperor, and beside him the empress, reclining on  twelve silk cushions.    As the princes entered, one of these twelve cushions fell to the  floor, only eleven remaining under the royal lady.    \"Take off your caps!\" cried a courtier.    \"To wear the head covered is a token of rank among men. We wish to be  what we are.\"    \"Why, yes!\" exclaimed the emperor, softened by the musical words that  fell from the boys' lips. \"Remain what you are, but who are you?  Whence do you come, and what do you want?\"    \"We are twin brothers, members of a family that is broken in twain,  half in the earth, half at the head of the table; we come from whence  we went, and have reached the place whence we came; we have had a  long journey, have spoken in the sighing of the wind, given a voice to  wood, sang in the ripples of the water, but now we wish to chant in  human language a song you know without knowing it.\"    A second cushion fell from under the empress.    \"Let them go home with their nonsense!\" she said to her husband.    \"Oh! no, let them sing,\" replied the emperor. \"You only wanted to see  them, but I wish to hear them. Sing, boys!\"    The empress was silent, and the princes began to sing the story of  their lives.    \"There was once an emperor,\" they began, and a third cushion fell from  under the empress.    When they described the emperor's departure to the war, three cushions  fell at once, and when the princes had finished their song not a  single one remained. But when they took off their caps and showed  their golden hair and the golden star on their foreheads, guests,  courtiers and emperor closed their eyes, that they might not be  dazzled by so much radiance.           *       *       *       *       *    Afterward, what ought to have been from the beginning, happened.    Laptitza sat at the head of the table beside her husband, but the  step-mother's daughter served as the humblest maid in the palace, and  the wicked step-mother was fastened to the tail of a wild mare and  dragged around the earth seven times, that the whole world might know  and never forget, that whoever plans evil comes to a bad end.

(Professor G. T. Hamy, _Les Derniers Jours du Jardin du Roi_, etc.,  p. 3.) Buffon, after nearly fifty years of service as Intendant, died  April 16, 1788.          CHAPTER III    LAMARCK'S SHARE IN THE REORGANIZATION OF THE JARDIN DES PLANTES AND  MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY      Even in his humble position as keeper of the herbarium, with its  pitiable compensation, Lamarck, now an eminent botanist, with a European  reputation, was by no means appreciated or secure in his position. He  was subjected to many worries, and, already married and with several  children, suffered from a grinding poverty. His friend and supporter,  La Billarderie, was a courtier, with much influence at the Tuileries,  but as Intendant of the Royal Garden without the least claim to  scientific fitness for the position; and in 1790 he was on the point of  discharging Lamarck.[22] On the 20th of August the Finance Committee  reduced the expenses of the Royal Garden and Cabinet, and, while raising  the salary of the professor of botany, to make good the deficiency thus  ensuing suppressed the position of keeper of the herbarium, filled by  Lamarck. Lamarck, on learning of this, acted promptly, and though in  this cavalier way stricken off from the rolls of the Royal Garden, he  at once prepared, printed, and distributed among the members of the  National Assembly an energetic claim for restoration to his office.[23]  His defence formed two brochures; in one he gave an account of his life,  travels, and works, and in the other he showed that the place which he  filled was a pressing necessity, and could not be conveniently or  usefully added to that of the professor of botany, who was already  overworked.    This manly and able plea in his own defence also comprised a broad,  comprehensive plan for the organization and development of a great  national museum, combining both vast collections and adequate means of  public instruction. The paper briefly stated, in courteous language,  what he wished to say to public men, in general animated with good  intentions, but little versed in the study of the sciences and the  knowledge of their application. It praised, in fit terms, the work of  the National Assembly, and gave, without too much emphasis, the  assurance of an entire devotion to the public business. Then in a very  clear and comprehensive way were given all the kinds of service which an  establishment like the Royal Garden should render to the sciences and  arts, and especially to agriculture, medicine, commerce, etc. Museums,  galleries, and botanical gardens; public lectures and demonstrations in  the museum and school of botany; an office for giving information, the  distribution of seeds, etc.--all the resources already so varied, as  well as the facilities for work at the Jardin, passed successively in  review before the representatives of the country, and the address ended  in a modest request to the Assembly that its author be allowed a few  days to offer some observations regarding the future organization of  this great institution.    The Assembly, adopting the wise views announced in the manifest which  had been presented by the officers of the Jardin and Cabinet, sent the  address to the Committee, and gave a month's time to the petitioners to  prepare and present a plan and regulations which should establish the  organization of their establishment.[24]    It was in 1790 that the decisive step was taken by the officers of the  Royal Garden[25] and Cabinet of Natural History which led to the  organization of the present Museum of Natural History as it is to-day.  Throughout the proceedings, Lamarck, as at the outset, took a prominent  part, his address having led the Assembly to invite the officers of the  double establishment to draw up rules for its government.    The officers met together August 23d, and their distrust and hostility  against the Intendant were shown by their nomination of Daubenton, the  Nestor of the French savants, to the presidency, although  La Billarderie, as representing the royal authority, was present at the  meeting. At the second meeting (August 24th) he took no part in the  proceedings, and absented himself from the third, held on August 27,  1790. It will be seen that even while the office of Intendant lasted,  that official took no active part in the meetings or in the work of the  institution, and from that day to this it has been solely under the  management of a director and scientific corps of professors, all of them  original investigators as well as teachers. Certainly the most practical  and efficient sort of organization for such an establishment.[26]    Lamarck, though holding a place subordinate to the other officers, was  present, as the records of the proceedings of the officers of the Jardin  des Plantes at this meeting show.    During the middle of 1791, the Intendant, La Billarderie, after \"four  years of incapacity,\" placed his resignation in the hands of the king.  The Minister of the Interior, instead of nominating Daubenton as  Intendant, reserved the place for a _protege_, and, July 1, 1791, sent  in the name of Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, the  distinguished author of _Paul et Virginie_ and of _Etudes sur la  Nature_. The new Intendant was literary in his tastes, fond of nature,  but not a practical naturalist. M. Hamy wittily states that \"Bernardin  Saint-Pierre contemplated and dreamed, and in his solitary meditations  had imagined a system of the world which had nothing in common with that  which was to be seen in the Faubourg Saint Victor, and one can readily  imagine the welcome that the officers of the Jardin gave to the singular  naturalist the Tuileries had sent them.\"[27]    Lamarck suffered an indignity from the intermeddling of this second  Intendant of the Jardin. In his budget of expenses[28] sent to the  Minister of the Interior, Bernardin de Saint-Pierre took occasion to  refer to Lamarck in a disingenuous and blundering way, which may have  both amused and disgusted him.    But the last days of the Jardin du Roi were drawing to a close, and a  new era in French natural science, signalized by the reorganization of  the Jardin and Cabinet under the name of the _Museum d'Histoire  Naturelle_, was dawning. On the 6th of February, 1793, the National  Convention, at the request of Lakanal,[29] ordered the Committees of  Public Instruction and of Finances to at once make a report on the new  organization of the administration of the Jardin des Plantes.    Lakanal consulted with Daubenton, and inquired into the condition and  needs of the establishment; Daubenton placed in his hands the brochure  of 1790, written by Lamarck. The next day Lakanal, after a short  conference with his colleagues of the Committee of Public Instruction,  read in the tribune a short report and a decree which the Committee  adopted without discussion.    Their minds were elsewhere, for grave news had come in from all  quarters. The Austrians were bombarding Valenciennes, the Prussians had  invested Mayence, the Spanish were menacing Perpignan, and bands of  Vendeans had seized Saumur after a bloody battle; while at Caen, at  Evreux, at Bordeaux, at Marseilles, and elsewhere, muttered the thunders  of the outbreaks provoked by the proscription of the Girondins. So that  under these alarming conditions the decree of the 10th of June, in  spite of its importance to science and higher learning in France, was  passed without discussion.    In his _Lamarck_ De Mortillet states explicitly that Lamarck, in his  address of 1790, changed the name of the Jardin du Roi to Jardin des  Plantes.[30] As the article states, \"Entirely devoted to his studies,  Lamarck entered into no intrigue under the falling monarchy, so he  always remained in a position straitened and inferior to his merits.\" It  was owing to this and his retired mode of life that the single-minded  student of nature was not disturbed in his studies and meditations by  the Revolution. And when the name of the Jardin du Roi threatened to be  fatal to this establishment, it was he who presented a memoir to  transform it, under the name of Jardin des Plantes, into an institution  of higher instruction, with six professors. In 1793, Lakanal adopted  Lamarck's plan, and, enlarging upon it, created twelve chairs for the  teaching of the natural sciences.    Bourguin thus puts the matter:      \"In June, 1793, Lakanal, having learned that 'the Vandals' (that is    his expression) had demanded of the tribune of the Convention the    suppression of the Royal Garden, as being an annex of the king's    palace, recurred to the memoirs of Lamarck presented in 1790 and    gave his plan of organization. He inspired himself with Lamarck's    ideas, but enlarged upon them. Instead of six positions of    professors-administrative, which Lamarck asked for, Lakanal    established twelve chairs for the teaching of different branches of    natural science.\"[31]      FOOTNOTES:    [22] Another intended victim of La Billarderie, whose own salary had  been at the same time reduced, was Faujas de Saint-Fond, one of the  founders of geology. But his useful discoveries in economic geology  having brought him distinction, the king had generously pensioned him,  and he was retained in office on the printed _Etat_ distributed by the  Committee of Finance.
