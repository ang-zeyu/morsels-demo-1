The latter, indeed, is  preferable in all cases, several pigments being slightly affected by  iron, cadmium yellow among the number.    Numerous colours are likewise injured by _lime_ and _fire_, and cannot  therefore be employed in fresco, or enamel painting.    Of substances which may act deleteriously on colours, there remain the  _vehicles and varnishes_ with which they are mixed. Many of these have  been blamed, and often with justice, for their injurious effects on  pigments. The reputation of the most permanent colour may be ruined, if  the vehicle, &c., employed with it be untrustworthy. The presence of  lead, for instance, in such materials renders them liable to be  blackened by foul air, and by consequence the pigments used therewith.    Time produces in many cases a mellow and harmonious change in pictures,  but occasionally alterations altogether unfavourable. To ensure the  former and prevent the latter, the attention of the artist in the course  of his colouring should be to the employment of such pigments and  colours as are prone to adapt themselves, in changing, to the intended  key of his colouring, and the right effect of his picture. Thus, if he  design a cool effect, ultramarine has a tendency through time to  predominate and aid the natural key of blue. He will, therefore,  compromise the permanence of this effect, if in such case he employ a  declining or changeable blue, or if he introduce such reds and yellows  as have a tendency to warmth or foxiness, by which the colouring of  many pictures has been destroyed. In a glowing or warm key, the case is  in some measure reversed--not wholly so, for it is observable that those  pictures have best preserved their colouring and harmony in which the  blue has been most lasting, by the pigment counteracting the change of  colour in the vehicle, and that suffusion of dusky yellow which time is  wont to bestow upon pictures even of the best complexion.    Unless introduced and guaranteed by houses of acknowledged reputation,  newly discovered pigments are to be used with caution. Good colours have  ever been prized with so true an estimation of their value, that to  produce such, after so many ages of research is no ordinary  accomplishment. But too many resplendent pigments, fruits of the  fecundity of modern chemistry, have been found deficient. The yellow and  orange chromates of lead, for instance, withstanding as they do the  action of the sunbeam, become by time, foul air, and the influence of  other pigments, inferior to the ochres. So the dazzling scarlet of  iodine and mercury must yield the palm of excellence to the more sober  vermilion, being a chameleon colour, subject to the most sudden and  opposite changes. And the blues of cobalt, as always tending to  greenness and obscurity, cannot rank beside ultramarine.    We are far from asserting, however, that all modern pigments are  inferior, or that pigments should be looked upon with suspicion because  they are modern. Several most valuable colours have lately claimed  attention, notably the permanent transparent yellow called _Aureolin_.  Seeing that, until its introduction, a yellow combining transparency  with a perfect stability was unknown to the palette, the importance of  such an addition, so long wanted and wished for, cannot be overrated.  Equal in beauty and durability with the preceding, but possessing  greater richness and depth, and of a semi-opacity, another yellow of the  highest order merits regard, _Orient Yellow_, distinguished for its  lustrous golden hue, resembling a bright Indian yellow. Dazzling in  brilliancy, and absolute in permanency. _Cadmium Red_ next attracts  notice. This new aspirant for artistic fame is a most vivid  orange-scarlet, the latter colour predominating, of intense fire, but  with no approach to rankness or harshness, yielding delicate pale  washes, and blending happily with white in the formation of flesh tints.  With it may be coupled _Cadmium Orange_, a colour equally brilliant and  stable, and equally without rankness or harshness, but of a true orange  hue, admirably adapted for sunsets and the like. Last of all the fresh  pigments of whose thorough durability there is _no_ doubt, comes the  splendid _Viridian_, a green nothing but fire will change, and no  mixture of blue and yellow will afford. Clear, bright, and transparent  as the emerald, it rivals velvet in its soft gorgeous richness. With  this and Aureolin a series of beautiful foliage tints may be formed,  sparkling with sunshine, as it were.    Other colours there are which have been brought forward within the last  few years, not possessing the absolute permanency of the five foregoing,  but equal, or superior, to many formerly used. It were folly, therefore,  and a silly conservatism on the part of the artist to limit himself to  such pigments only as were employed by his forefathers, especially as  their merits were often more than doubtful. New colours, it is true,  have to be _learnt_, for each pigment has its own peculiar habitudes,  chemical, physical, artistic; but if they be good and durable, no amount  of time and study spent upon them is thrown away. To think less of the  quality of one's materials than of the effects which can be produced  with them is mistaken policy; and to be content with that quality when  better can be had, shows no real love of art, but rather indolence and  apathy.    Perhaps one reason why freshly introduced pigments have not as fair a  chance as they are entitled to, is due to the fashion which prevails of  exclaiming against the fugacity of modern colours. If their detractors  would confine themselves to certain colours, there could be no denial;  but to assert, as is often done, that the cause of modern pictures not  standing is owing to modern pigments generally, is unjust. It is not  the materials which should be blamed, but those who use them. The fact  is, that the artist's knowledge has not increased in proportion to the  greater variety of colours at his command. In the early periods of art,  when the palette was chiefly confined to native pigments, the painter  could not very well go wrong. Now-a-days but too many, wanting the skill  of the old masters, seek to make amends for it by brilliancy of  colouring: with imperfect knowledge of their materials the result is  obvious. The palette, we admit, wants weeding; not only of the bad new  colours, but of the bad old colours. This, however, must be a work of  time, and depend, not upon the colourman--for where there is a demand  there will be a supply--but upon the artists themselves. To this end an  increased acquaintance with the properties of pigments is required,  whereby they may be able to choose the fast from the fugitive. It may be  fairly assumed that the painter will be assisted in his task by the  progress of chemical science, which will doubtless add from time to time  to the list of stable pigments. We have heard it remarked that there are  too many colours already--to which we reply, there are not too many good  colours, and scarcely can be. The more crowded the palette is with  reliable pigments, the more likely are the worthless to be pushed from  their places. In our opinion, there is ample room for fresh colours,  provided they be durable; and we have as little sympathy with the  stereotyped cry of there being too many, as with the fashionable  unbelief in modern pigments. Certainly, the artist who seeks for  permanence among the whites, reds, or blues, will not be troubled with a  superfluity. Certainly, too, colours are as good as ever they were, and  better--better made, better ground, better prepared for use. But, fast  and fugitive, pigments are more numerous, and for that reason need more  careful selection.          CHAPTER V.    ON THE GENERAL QUALITIES OF PIGMENTS.      The general attributes of a perfect pigment are beauty of colour,  comprehending pureness and richness, brilliancy and intensity, delicacy  and depth,--truth of hue--transparency or opacity, well-working,  crispness, setting up, or keeping its place, and desiccation, or drying  well. To all of these must be superadded _durability_ when used, a  quality to which the health and vitality of a picture belong, and one so  essential that all other properties put together without it are of no  esteem with the artist who merits reputation. We have, therefore, given  it a previous distinct consideration.    It must be observed that no pigment possesses all the foregoing  qualifications in perfection, some being naturally at variance or  opposed; nor is there any, perhaps, that cannot boast excellence in one  or more of them.    _Beauty_ commonly comprises in the same pigment delicacy, purity, and  brilliancy; or depth, richness, and intensity. Delicacy and depth in  the beauty of colours are at variance in the production of all pigments,  so that perfect success in producing the one is attended with more or  less of failure in the other, and when they are united--as they  occasionally are--it is with some sacrifice of both. Hence the judicious  artist purveys for his palette at least two pigments of each colour, one  eminent for delicate beauty, the other for richness and depth.    _Truth of hue_ is a relative quality in all colours, except the extreme  primaries, in the relations of which, blue, being of nearest affinity to  black or shade, has properly but one other relation, in which it  inclines to red and becomes purple-blue: it is, therefore, faulty or  false, when, tending to yellow, it becomes of a green hue. But red,  which is of equal affinity to light and shade, has two relations, by one  of which it verges upon blue and becomes a purple-red or crimson; and by  the other it leans to yellow, and becomes an orange-red or scarlet,  neither of which is individually false or discordant. Yet yellow, which  is of nearest affinity to white or light, has strictly but one true"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20916"],[0,"The Arabian Nights: Their Best-known Tales (#6)"],[1,"was transformed into a stone, as Prince Perviz and the princess were  talking together in the evening, as usual, the prince desired his sister  to pull out the knife to know how their brother did. The princess  readily complied, and seeing the blood run down the point was seized  with so much horror that she threw it down. \"Ah! my dear brother,\" cried  she, \"I have been the cause of your death, and shall never see you more!  Why did I tell you of the Talking Bird, Singing Tree, and Golden Water;  or rather, of what importance was it to me to know whether the devout  woman thought this house ugly or handsome, or complete or not? I wish  to Heaven she had never addressed herself to me!\"    Prince Perviz was as much afflicted at the death of Prince Bahman as the  princess, but not to waste time in needless regret, as he knew that she  still passionately desired possession of the marvellous treasures, he  interrupted her, saying: \"Sister, our regret for our brother is vain;  our lamentations cannot restore him to life; it is the will of God; we  must submit and adore the decrees of the Almighty without searching into  them. Why should you now doubt of the truth of what the holy woman told  you? Do you think she spoke to you of three things that were not in  being, and that she invented them to deceive you who had received her  with so much goodness and civility? Let us rather believe that our  brother's death is owing to some error on his part, or some accident  which we cannot conceive. It ought not therefore to prevent us from  pursuing our object. I offered to go this journey, and am now more  resolved than ever; his example has no effect upon my resolution;  to-morrow I will depart.\"    The princess did all she could to dissuade Prince Perviz, conjuring him  not to expose her to the danger of losing two brothers; but he was  obstinate, and all the remonstrances she could urge had no effect upon  him. Before he went, that she might know what success he had, he left  her a string of a hundred pearls, telling her that if they would not run  when she should count them upon the string, but remain fixed, that would  be a certain sign he had undergone the same fate as his brother; but at  the same time told her he hoped it would never happen, but that he  should have the delight of seeing her again.    Prince Perviz, on the twentieth day after his departure, met the same  dervish in the same place as his brother Bahman had done before him. He  went directly up to him, and after he had saluted, asked him if he  could tell him where to find the Talking Bird, the Singing Tree, and the  Golden Water. The dervish urged the same remonstrances as he had done to  Prince Bahman, telling him that a young gentleman, who very much  resembled him, was with him a short time before; that, overcome by his  importunity, he had shown him the way, given him a guide, and told him  how he should act to succeed, but that he had not seen him since, and  doubted not but he had shared the same fate as all other adventurers.    \"Good dervish,\" answered Prince Perviz, \"I know whom you speak of; he  was my elder brother, and I am informed of the certainty of his death,  but know not the cause.\" \"I can tell you,\" replied the dervish; \"he was  changed into a black stone, as all I speak of have been; and you must  expect the same transformation, unless you observe more exactly than he  has done the advice I gave him, in case you persist in your resolution,  which I once more entreat you to renounce.\"    \"Dervish,\" said Prince Perviz, \"I cannot sufficiently express how much I  am obliged for the concern you take in my life, who am a stranger to  you, and have done nothing to deserve your kindness; but I thoroughly  considered this enterprise before I undertook it; therefore I beg of you  to do me the same favour you have done my brother. Perhaps I may have  better success in following your directions.\" \"Since I cannot prevail  with you,\" said the dervish, \"to give up your obstinate resolution, if  my age did not prevent me, and I could stand, I would get up to reach  you a bowl I have here, which will show you the way.\"    Without giving the dervish time to say more, the prince alighted from  his horse and went to the dervish, who had taken a bowl out of his bag,  in which he had a great many, and gave it him, with the same directions  he had given Prince Bahman; and after warning him not to be discouraged  by the voices he should hear, however threatening they might be, but to  continue his way up the hill till he saw the cage and bird, he let him  depart.    Prince Perviz thanked the dervish, and when he had remounted and taken  leave, threw the bowl before his horse, and spurring him at the same  time, followed it. When the bowl came to the bottom of the hill it  stopped, the prince alighted, and stood some time to recollect the  dervish's directions. He encouraged himself, and began to walk up with a  resolution to reach the summit; but before he had gone above six steps,  he heard a voice, which seemed to be near, as of a man behind him, say  in an insulting tone: \"Stay, rash youth, that I may punish you for your  presumption.\"    Upon this affront the prince, forgetting the dervish's advice, clapped  his hand upon his sword, drew it, and turned about to revenge himself;  but had scarcely time to see that nobody followed him before he and his  horse were changed into black stones.    In the meantime the Princess Periezade, several times a day after her  brother's departure, counted her chaplet. She did not omit it at night,  but when she went to bed put it about her neck, and in the morning when  she awoke counted over the pearls again to see if they would slide.    The day that Prince Perviz was transformed into a stone she was counting  over the pearls as she used to do, when all at once they became  immovably fixed, a certain token that the prince, her brother, was dead.  As she had determined what to do in case it should so happen, she lost  no time in outward demonstrations of grief, which she concealed as much  as possible, but having disguised herself in man's apparel, she mounted  her horse the next morning, armed and equipped, having told her servants  she should return in two or three days, and took the same road that her  brothers had done.    The princess, who had been used to ride on horseback in hunting,  supported the fatigue of so long a journey better than most ladies could  have done; and as she made the same stages as her brothers, she also met  with the dervish on the twentieth day. When she came near him, she  alighted from her horse, leading him by the bridle, went and sat down by  the dervish, and after she had saluted him, said: \"Good dervish, give me  leave to rest myself; and do me the favour to tell me if you have not  heard that there are somewhere in this neighbourhood a Talking Bird, a  Singing Tree, and Golden Water.\"    \"Princess,\" answered the dervish, \"for so I must call you, since by your  voice I know you to be a woman disguised in man's apparel, I know the  place well where these things are to be found; but what makes you ask me  this question?\"    \"Good dervish,\" replied the princess, \"I have had such a flattering  relation of them given me, that I have a great desire to possess them.\"  \"Madam,\" replied the dervish, \"you have been told the truth. These  curiosities are more singular than they have been represented, but you  have not been made acquainted with the difficulties which must be  surmounted in order to obtain them. If you had been fully informed of  these, you would not have undertaken so dangerous an enterprise. Take my  advice, return, and do not urge me to contribute toward your ruin.\"    \"Good father,\" said the princess, \"I have travelled a great way, and  should be sorry to return without executing my design. You talk of  difficulties and danger of life, but you do not tell me what those  difficulties are, and wherein the danger consists. This is what I desire  to know, that I may consider and judge whether I can trust my courage  and strength to brave them.\"    The dervish repeated to the princess what he had said to the Princes  Bahman and Perviz, exaggerating the difficulties of climbing up to the  top of the mountain, where she was to make herself mistress of the Bird,  which would inform her of the Singing Tree and Golden Water. He  magnified the din of the terrible threatening voices which she would  hear on all sides of her, and the great number of black stones alone  sufficient to strike terror. He entreated her to reflect that those  stones were so many brave gentlemen, so metamorphosed for having omitted  to observe the principal condition of success in the perilous  undertaking, which was not to look behind them before they had got  possession of the cage.    When the dervish had done, the princess replied: \"By what I comprehend  from your discourse, the difficulties of succeeding in this affair are,  first, the getting up to the cage without being frightened at the  terrible din of voices I shall hear; and, secondly, not to look behind  me. For this last, I hope I shall be mistress enough of myself to  observe it; as to the first, I own that voices, such as you represent  them to be, are capable of striking terror into the most undaunted; but  as in all enterprises and dangers every one may use stratagem, I desire  to know of you if I may use any in one of so great importance.\" \"And  what stratagem is it you would employ?\" said the dervish. \"To stop my  ears with cotton,\" answered the princess, \"that the voices, however  terrible, may make the less impression upon my imagination, and my mind  remain free from that disturbance which might cause me to lose the use  of my reason.\"    \"Princess,\" replied the dervish, \"of all the persons who have addressed  themselves to me for information, I do not know that ever one made use  of the contrivance you propose. All I know is that"]]]
