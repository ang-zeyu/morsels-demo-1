Just then a knock was heard at the chamber-door.    \"Come in!\" said Dick, pausing a moment in his labors.    Mr. Clifton, a fellow-boarder, entered with a cigar in his mouth.    \"Holloa,\" said he, \"what's up? Going to the theatre, Hunter?\"    \"No,\" said Dick. \"I'm goin' out to spend the evening with some friends  up in Madison Avenue.\"    \"So I heard you say at the table, but I thought you were joking.\"    \"No,\" said Dick; \"it's a fact.\"    \"Seems to me you handle the brush pretty skilfully,\" remarked Mr.  Clifton. \"I should almost think you had served a regular apprenticeship  at it.\"    \"So I have,\" answered Dick. \"Didn't you ever see me when I blacked boots  on Chatham Square?\"    \"Good joke!\" said the young man, who was far from supposing that Dick  was in earnest. \"Oh, yes, of course I've seen you often! Did you make  money at it?\"    \"I retired on a fortun',\" said Dick, \"and now I've invested my capital  in mercantile pursuits. There,\" and he took up one boot, and showed it  to his visitor, \"did you ever see a better shine than that?\"    \"No, I didn't, that's a fact,\" said Clifton, admiringly. \"You beat the  young rascal I employ all hollow. I say, Hunter, if you ever go into the  'shine' business again, I'll be a regular customer of yours.\"    \"He little thinks I've blacked his boots before now,\" thought Dick.    \"All right,\" said he, aloud. \"When a commercial crisis comes, and I fail  in business, I think I'll remember your encouragin' offer, and remind  you of it.\"    \"Have a cigar either of you?\" asked Clifton, drawing out a case. \"Excuse  my not offering it before.\"    \"No, thank you,\" said Fosdick.    \"Don't smoke, eh? Won't you have one, Hunter?\"    \"No, thank you. Fosdick is my guardian, and he don't allow it.\"    \"So you're a good boy. Well, I wish you a pleasant evening,\" and Clifton  sauntered out to find some other companion.    \"He wouldn't believe I'd been a boot-black,\" said Dick, \"even after I  told him. I knew he wouldn't, or I wouldn't have said so. Is my hair  parted straight?\"    \"Yes, it's all right.\"    \"How's my cravat?\"    \"It'll do. You're getting to be quite a dandy, Dick.\"    \"I want to look respectable; got it right that time. When I visit Turkey  I want to look as the turkeys do. Won't you go with me,--as far as the  door, I mean?\"    \"Yes, if you're going to walk.\"    \"I'd rather. I feel kind of nervous, and perhaps I'll walk it off.\"    The two boys got their caps, and walked up Broadway on the west side.  The lights were already lit, and the shop windows made a brilliant  display. At intervals places of amusement opened wide their hospitable  portals, and large placards presented tempting invitations to enter.    They reached Union Square, and, traversing it, again walked up Broadway  to Madison Park. At the upper end of this park commences the beautiful  avenue which bears the same name. Only about half a dozen blocks now  required to be passed, when the boys found themselves opposite a  residence with a very imposing front.    \"This is the place,\" said Dick. \"I wish you were going in with me.\"    \"I hope you will have a pleasant time, Dick. Good-by till I see you  again.\"    Dick felt a little nervous, but he summoned up all his courage, and,  ascending the broad marble steps, rang the bell.          CHAPTER V.    DICK RECEIVES TWO VALUABLE PRESENTS.      At the end of the last chapter we left Dick standing on the steps of Mr.  Rockwell's residence in Madison Avenue. He had rung the bell and was  waiting to have his summons answered. To say that Dick expected to enjoy  his visit would not be strictly true. He knew very well that his street  education had not qualified him to appear to advantage in fashionable  society, and he wished that Fosdick were with him to lend him  countenance.    While under the influence of these feelings the door was thrown open,  and a servant looked at him inquiringly.    \"Is Mr. Rockwell at home?\" asked Dick.    \"Yes. Would you like to see him?\"    \"He asked me to call this evening.\"    \"What! Are you the boy that saved Master Johnny from drowning?\" asked  the servant, her face brightening up, for Johnny was a great favorite in  the house.    \"I jumped into the water after him,\" said Dick, modestly.    \"I heard Mr. Rockwell say he was expecting you to-night. Come right in.  Mistress is very anxious to see you.\"    Placed a little at his ease by this cordial reception, Dick followed the  servant upstairs to a pleasant sitting-room on the second floor. Mr. and  Mrs. Rockwell were seated at a centre-table reading the evening papers,  while Johnny and his sister Grace were constructing a Tower of Babel  with some blocks upon the carpet before the fire.    Dick entered, and stood just within the door, with his cap in his hand,  feeling a little embarrassed.    \"I am glad to see you, Richard,\" said Mr. Rockwell, rising from his  seat, and advancing to our hero with a pleasant smile. \"Mrs. Rockwell  has been anxious to see you. My dear, this is the brave boy who saved  our little Johnny.\"    Mrs. Rockwell, a tall, graceful lady, with a smile that quite captivated  Dick, offered her hand, and said, earnestly, \"My brave boy, I have been  wishing to see you. I shudder to think that, but for your prompt  courage, I should now be mourning the loss of my dear little Johnny.  Accept a mother's thanks for a favor so great that she can never hope to  repay it.\"    Now this acknowledgment was very pleasant to Dick, but it was also very  embarrassing. It is difficult to receive praise gracefully. So our hero,  not knowing what else to say, stammered out that she was very welcome.    \"I understand that you have entered my husband's employment,\" said Mrs.  Rockwell.    \"Yes,\" said Dick. \"He was kind enough to take me.\"    \"I hope to make a man of business of our young friend,\" said Mr.  Rockwell. \"He will soon feel at home in his new position, and I hope we  may find the connection mutually satisfactory.\"    \"Have you a pleasant boarding-place?\" asked Mrs. Rockwell.    \"Tip-top,\" said Dick. \"I mean pretty good,\" he added, in a little  confusion.    \"Where is it?\"    \"In Bleecker Street,\" said Dick, very glad that he was not obliged to  say Mott Street.    \"That is quite a good location,\" said Mr. Rockwell. \"How do you spend  your evenings, Richard?\"    \"In studying with a friend of mine,\" said Dick. \"I want to know  something by the time I grow up.\"    \"That is an excellent resolution,\" said his employer, with warm  approval. \"I wish more boys of your age were equally sensible. You may  depend upon it that a good education is the best preparation for an  honorable and useful manhood. What is your friend's name?\"    \"Henry Fosdick. He rooms with me.\"    \"I am glad you have a friend who shares your tastes. But perhaps you  would like to renew your acquaintance with the young gentleman to whom  you have rendered so great a service. Johnny has been allowed to stay up  beyond his usual bedtime because you were coming. Johnny, come here!\"    Johnny rose from his blocks, and came to his mother's side. He was a  pleasant-looking little fellow, with a pair of bright eyes, and round,  plump cheeks. He looked shyly at Dick.    \"Did you ever see this young man?\" asked his mother.    \"Yes,\" said Johnny.    \"When was it?\"    \"When I was in the river,\" said Johnny. \"He pulled me out.\"    \"Are you glad to see him?\"    \"Yes,\" said Johnny. \"What is his name?\"    \"Dick,\" said our hero, who somehow could not help feeling, when called  Richard, that some other boy was meant.    \"Won't you come and help me build a house?\" asked little Johnny.    Dick accepted the invitation with pleasure, feeling more at home with  children than with older persons.    \"This is sister Grace,\" said Johnny, with an offhand introduction.    \"I saw you on the boat,\" said Dick.    \"Yes,\" said Grace, \"I was there. Oh, how frightened I was when Johnny  fell into the water! I don't see how you dared to jump in after him.\"    \"Oh, I've been in swimming many a time. I don't mind it,\" said Dick.    \"I s'pose you're used to it, like the fishes,\" said Johnny. \"I'm glad  I'm not a fish. I shouldn't like to live in the water.\"    \"I don't think I should, either,\" said Dick. \"Now, what do you think the  fishes do when it rains?\"    \"I do not know.\"    \"They go down to the bottom of the sea to get out of the wet.\"    \"Isn't it wet down at the bottom of the sea?\" asked Johnny, in good  faith.    \"Of course it is, you little goose,\" said Grace, with an air of superior  wisdom.    \"Will you make me a house?\" said Johnny.    \"What kind of a house do you want?\" said Dick, seating himself on the  carpet, and taking up the blocks.    \"Any kind,\" said Johnny.    Dick, beginning to feel quite at home with the children, erected an  imposing-looking house, leaving little spaces for the doors and windows.    \"That's better than the house Grace made,\" said Johnny, looking at it  with complacency.    \"But it won't last very long,\" said Dick. \"You'd better sell it before  it tumbles over.\"    \"Do you own any houses?\" asked Johnny.    \"Not many,\" said Dick, smiling.    \"My father owns this house,\" said Johnny, positively. \"He paid fifty  dollars for it.\"    \"I didn't think houses were so cheap,\" said Dick. \"I'd like to buy one  at that price.\"    \"You're a little goose, Johnny,\" said Grace. \"He gave as much as five  hundred dollars.\"    \"Grace doesn't know much more about the price of real estate than  Johnny,\" said Mr. Rockwell.    \"Didn't the house cost as much as five hundred dollars?\" asked Grace.    \"As much as that certainly, my dear.\"    Just then, by an unguarded movement of Johnny's foot, the edifice of  blocks reared by Dick became a confused ruin.    \"I've got tired of building houses,\" he announced, \"Won't you tell me a  story, Dick?\"    \"I don't think I know any,\" said our hero.    \"Here is a book of pictures,\" said his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21653"],[0,"The Eurhythmics of Jaques-Dalcroze (#6)"],[1,"movement, insert an extra accent  either with arm or foot, or do any similar thing previously agreed on.  By repeated practice of such exercises complete automatic control of the  limbs is obtained and the ground prepared for more advanced work. It is  at this stage that the simple movements to indicate times and notes are  learnt; they may be likened to the alphabet of the method, the  elementary exercises as a whole being its accidence, the more advanced  stages, including plastic expression, its syntax.        [Sidenote: =TRAINING IN METRE=]    This group of exercises is a natural extension of those preceding.    The pupil learns a series of movements which together form a rhythm,  first practising them singly, then in groups, the signal for the change  being always the word _hopp_. By means of such exercises the component  movements required in the physical expression of a rhythm can be learnt,  first individually, then in series, until the complete rhythm can be  expressed and the use of _hopp_ be dropped, each change of movement  becoming itself the signal for the next.    Again, the pupil learns to realize[1] a rhythm played on the piano or  indicated by the movements of another person. This is something quite  apart from mere imitation; trained by previous exercises, the pupil  first forms clear mental images of the movements corresponding to the  rhythm in question and then gives physical expression to those images.  In other words, he does not reproduce until he has understood; in fact,  without understanding, correct reproduction of a lengthy series of such  movements is impossible. In the same way, an individual cannot easily  remember and repeat a succession of words which he does not understand,  but can repeat without difficulty a long series of words of which he  understands the sense. Indeed, the importance of many of these exercises  becomes clearer when the way in which children are taught to read and  write is remembered.        [1] _Realize_ is used in rhythmic gymnastics in the      sense _express by movements of the body_.    Oral and visual images of letters and words are impressed on the child  by reading aloud, and in this way the young brain easily masters the  difficult work of reading and writing. The Jaques-Dalcroze method  proceeds in exactly the same manner as regards the elements of music.    When we have once realized this point, we are bound to wonder why music  teaching has not always been based on this elementary and unfailing  form. What would be said to teachers who tried to teach children to read  and write without letting them spell and read aloud? But this is what  has often been done in the teaching of music, and if children generally  show but little pleasure and interest in their first music lessons, the  fault does not lie with them but with our wrong method of making the  elements clear to them.    As a matter of fact we generally do not make the latter clear to them,  and fail in the most important duty of the educator and teacher, namely,  that of making the child really experience what he is to learn.        [Sidenote: =DEVELOPMENT OF MENTAL RESPONSE=]    A rhythm in music consists of a regularly recurring series of accented  sounds, unaccented sounds, and rests, expressed in rhythmic gymnastics  by movements and inhibitions of movements. Individuals who are  rhythmically uncertain generally have a muscular system which is  irregularly responsive to mental stimuli; the response may be too rapid  or too slow; in either case impulse or inhibition falls at the wrong  moment, the change of movement is not made to time, and the physical  expression of the rhythm is blurred.    Although feeling for rhythm is more or less latent in us all and can be  developed, few have it naturally perfect. The method has many exercises  which are of use in this connexion. By means of these the pupil is  taught how to arrest movement suddenly or slowly, to move alternately  forwards or backwards, to spring at a given signal, to lie down or stand  up in the exact time of a bar of music--in each case with a minimum of  muscular effort and without for a moment losing the feeling for each  time-unit of the music.        [Sidenote: =MENTAL HEARING. CONCENTRATION=]    Physical movements repeatedly performed create corresponding images in  the brain; the stronger the feeling for the movement, i.e., the more the  pupil concentrates while making that movement, the clearer will be the  corresponding mental image, and the more fully will the sense for metre  and rhythm be developed.    We might say that these movement images store up the innervations which  bring about the actual movement. They are for the body and its movements  what formulae are for the mathematician.    Developed out of many movements they become a complete symbol for the  rhythm expressed by the series of movements in question. Thus the pupil  who knows how to march in time to a given rhythm has only to close his  eyes and recall a clear image of the corresponding movements to  experience the rhythm as clearly as if he were expressing it by  marching. He simply continues to perform the movements mentally. If,  however, his movements when actually realizing the rhythm are weak or  confused, the corresponding mental images will be vague or incorrect,  whilst movements which are dynamically clear guarantee the accuracy of  the corresponding mental images and nerve-impulses.    In practice the exercise consists in first mastering a rhythm played,  marching and beating time in the usual manner, then at _hopp_  discontinuing all movement, either for a number of bars previously  agreed upon or until the signal to resume is given by a second _hopp_.  In this exercise the teacher ceases to play at the first _hopp_.        [Sidenote: =ANALYSIS AND DIVISION OF TIME VALUES=]    The exercises of this group are designed to teach how to subdivide units  of time into parts of varying number. At _hopp_ the crotchet must be  divided into quavers, triplets, semiquavers, etc., as may have been  previously arranged, or instead of _hopp_ the teacher may call _three_,  _four_, etc., to indicate the subdivision which is to be expressed by  the corresponding number of steps. Apart from their direct object, the  exercises of this group are of value for the training which they give in  poise; they might be classed equally well with the group under  _Development of Mental Response_.    Here, too, belong exercises in the realization of syncopation in which,  as the note is represented by the usual step, it comes off the beat, the  latter being indicated by a knee-bend which, in quick time, becomes a  mere suggestion of movement or is omitted, e.g., {Music}    These exercises in syncopation are perhaps some of the most difficult in  the method, as they demand an extraordinary control of inhibition.  Individuals of musical ability often find them difficult at first, and  their easy performance may be taken as evidence of a developed feeling  for rhythm. As a rule children find these exercises easier than do  adults.        [Illustration: Beating 5/4 in canon without      expression.]        [Illustration: Beating 5/4 in canon with expression.]        [Sidenote: =REALIZATION OF TIME AND RHYTHM=]    The object here is to express by rhythmic movements and without  hesitation rhythms perceived by the ear. The exactness of such  expression will be in proportion to the number of movements of which the  pupil has acquired automatic control. There is not time to analyse the  music heard; the body must _realize_ before the mind has a clear  impression of the movement image, just as in reading, words are  understood and pronounced without a clear mental image of them being  formed.    When the realization of a rhythm heard has become relatively easy, the  pupil is taught to concentrate, by listening to, and forming a mental  image of, a fresh rhythm while still performing the old one. In this  manner he obtains facility in rendering automatic, groups of movements  rhythmically arranged, and in keeping the mind free to take a fresh  impression which in its turn can be rendered automatic.    Here again the process is analagous to that of reading, in which, while  we are grasping the meaning of a sentence, the eye is already dealing  with the next, preparing it in turn for comprehension.        [Sidenote: =DEVELOPMENT OF INDEPENDENT CONTROL OF THE LIMBS=]    Characteristic exercises of this group are: beating the same time with  both arms but in canon, beating two different tempi with the arms while  the feet march to one or other or perhaps march to yet a third time,  e.g., the arms 3/4 and 4/4, the feet 5/4. There are, also,  exercises in the analysis of a given time unit into various fractions  simultaneously, e.g., in a 6/8 bar one arm may beat three to the bar,  the other arm two, while the feet march six.        [Sidenote: =DOUBLE OR TRIPLE DEVELOPMENT OF RHYTHMS=]    These exercises are a physical preparation for what is known in music as  the development of a theme. While the composers of fugues always use a  double or quadruple development, the method introduces an entirely fresh  element--the triple development, exercises in which are difficult but  extremely valuable.        [Sidenote: =PLASTIC COUNTERPOINT AND COMPOUND RHYTHMS=]    In plastic counterpoint the arms realize the theme, i.e., make as many  movements as there are notes, whilst the feet mark the counterpoint in  crotchets, quavers, triplets or semiquavers.    A compound rhythm may be realized by the arms taking one rhythm, the  feet another; or the rhythms of a three part canon may be expressed by  simultaneous singing, beating with the arms and marching.    These exercises correspond in the sphere of physical expression to the  technical exercises of instrumental work, for they teach the pupil to  express simultaneously impressions of the most varying nature.
