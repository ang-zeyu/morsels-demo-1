I `sign on' at the shipping office the day after to-  morrow, and have to be on board by eight o'clock the same evening in  readiness to haul out of dock at daylight on the following morning.\"        CHAPTER THREE.    BEFORE THE MAST.    The remainder of Dick Maitland's time in England was pretty fully  occupied in comforting and encouraging his mother, in view of the  pending separation, and in getting his somewhat slender wardrobe ready  and packed for the voyage.  The first-mentioned part of his task proved  very much more difficult than the other, for Mrs Maitland was rather a  helpless kind of person, and had already come to look to Dick for advice  and help in every sort of difficulty, whether great or small; the  prospect, therefore, of being henceforth obliged to look after herself  and manage her affairs unaided filled her at first with dismay.  Besides, there was the separation from her son, the feeling that she  knew not whether she would ever again set eyes on him in this world, and  the terrible uncertainty generally of the future, to further distract  her; but at length the buoyancy and unquenchable hopefulness of Dick's  spirit had its effect upon her; and, finally, when the moment of parting  came, she had been brought to a frame of mind that enabled her to say  the last words of farewell almost with calmness.  As for Dick, he had  already received Humphreys' assurance that he would keep in touch with  Mrs Maitland, and see, in conjunction with his friend Graham, the  solicitor, that she came to no harm; therefore he had few fears for her  immediate future; while, for the rest, he was confident that before his  mother's little capital became exhausted he would have found means to  replenish it.  He spent with her the remainder of the day upon which he  had interviewed the skipper of the _Concordia_, and practically the  whole of that which succeeded it, finally bidding her farewell about six  o'clock in the evening, in order that he might spend the remainder of  the day with Humphreys, with whom he had still much of importance to  discuss.    Upon Dick's return to Number 19 Paradise Street he found the genial  Doctor so busily engaged in dispensing drugs and advice that the two had  time for little more than a mutual nod of greeting; but later on, when  the last patient had departed and business had been brought to a close  for the night, they sat down together for a chat over a cup of coffee  and--so far as Humphreys was concerned--a pipe.  Dick had not yet taken  to tobacco, and Humphreys, although an inveterate smoker himself, so far  from urging his young friend to adopt the habit, had strongly dissuaded  him from having anything to do with the weed, at least until he had  reached his twenty-first birthday, learnedly descanting upon the  injurious effects of nicotine upon the immature constitution, and  incidentally warning him to eschew narcotics generally, which, he  insisted, were always injurious, and only to be resorted to, even  medically, when it became a choice between a narcotic and some greater  evil.    \"Well, my boy,\" remarked the Doctor, when they were at length  comfortably settled in their respective chairs, \"so you have parted with  your mother.  I hope you were able to cheer the poor lady and reconcile  her to the separation.  It is of course very hard upon her that at her  time of life she should be left absolutely alone, but necessity is a  pitiless jade, exacting her tribute of sorrow and suffering from all  alike, from the monarch to the pauper, and when she lays her hand upon  us there is no escape.  But do not allow anxiety on behalf of your dear  mother to worry you for a moment, lad, for I have promised to keep an  eye upon her, and, as you know, I am a man of my word, and no harm shall  befall her so long as I have the power to avert it.  No, don't thank me,  Dick, there is no need; the satisfaction and pleasure that I shall  derive from helping your dear mother will be reward enough for me, for I  regard her as a personal friend, and shall consider it a privilege to be  allowed to do all that I can for her.\"    \"And now, to pass on to another topic, let me show you the medicine  chest which I intend shall be my parting gift to you.  Here it is,\"--  producing a stout case measuring about eighteen inches long by fourteen  inches wide and twelve inches high.  \"It is not inconveniently bulky or  heavy, but it contains a practically complete assortment of drugs,  sufficient in quantity to enable you to fight successfully about half a  dozen cases of almost every known disease.  More than that it would be  inconvenient to carry about with you; and when any particular drug shows  signs of exhaustion you must take timely steps to replenish your supply.  And, with reference to that same replenishment, you will find a little  manuscript book, written by myself, containing full instructions in the  art of preparing several of the drugs from their parent plants, which I  believe you will find exceedingly useful.\"  Here Humphreys' talk became  professional and his speech surcharged with technicalities--for he was  an enthusiast in everything relating to the combating and cure of  disease, and far into the small hours he descanted learnedly upon his  beloved science, confiding to and instructing Dick in many valuable  secrets that, by dint of laborious research and much consumption of  midnight oil, he had wrung from Dame Nature.  And on many an occasion in  the not-far-distant future Dick Maitland had ample cause to look back  with gratitude upon that long midnight conversation.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    With exemplary punctuality young Maitland presented himself at the  shipping office at ten o'clock in the morning, and duly \"signed on\" as  ordinary seaman in the good ship _Concordia_, bound for Natal; Mr  Sutcliffe, the chief mate, privately congratulating Captain Roberts, the  skipper of the ship, immediately afterwards, upon his good fortune in  securing so \"likely\" a hand for the small sum of one shilling per month,  and expressing his fixed determination to \"make a man of him\" before  they reached the Line.  At the private suggestion of the said chief  mate, Dick lost no time in conveying his belongings to the ship and  depositing his bedding in the best-sheltered bunk in the forecastle;  after which he returned to Number 19 Paradise Street, where he spent the  few hours of freedom remaining to him in assisting his friend the  Doctor, and absorbing further knowledge from him.  Finally, as the  clocks in the immediate neighbourhood were striking the hour of eight in  the evening, Dick stepped over the rail of the _Concordia_ and formally  reported himself to the chief mate, thereafter repairing to the  forecastle and making his preparations for the night.  He was the first  hand to join the ship, notwithstanding the fact that the entire crew had  been ordered to be on board not later than eight o'clock that evening;  and it was not until close upon midnight that the remainder found their  way down from the neighbouring public houses, all of them as surly and  quarrelsome as bears at the termination of their short period of  liberty.  Fortunately for Dick, all hands were too far gone in drink to  admit of their quarrelsomeness going further than words, and eventually,  by about one o'clock in the morning, he was able to compose himself to  sleep, to the accompaniment of the snores and mutterings of his  companions--thirteen in number.    Many lads in Dick Maitland's position, and brought up amid refined  surroundings, as he had been, would have regarded with horror and  loathing such a situation as that in which he now found himself, and  would have been overwhelmed with self-pity at the cruelly hard luck  which forced them to herd with such uncongenial companions in such a pig  sty of a place as the _Concordia's_ forecastle just then presented; but  Dick was something of a philosopher, and was, moreover, full of \"grit\".  He held the doctrine that a man can make what he chooses of his  surroundings, and always find in them something of amusement or  interest, if he cares to look for it; and now he consoled himself with  the reminder that life in that forecastle, and among those men, whose  highest ideal of happiness seemed to be helpless intoxication, would  after all be but a brief experience, out of which it would be hard  indeed if he could not learn some useful lesson.  With this philosophic  reflection, he curled himself up in his blankets and dropped into a  sound, dreamless sleep.    At six o'clock next morning the mate came thundering upon the fore  scuttle with a handspike, following up the resounding blows with a yell  of:    \"All hands ahoy! tumble up there, you sleepers, and don't wait to curl  your hair.  Hurry up, now, and give me a chance to see who are the  `smarties' among you!\"    With low growls of disgust at such rude and untimely disturbance of  their slumbers the fourteen occupants of the forecastle rolled  unwillingly out of their bunks and proceeded to scramble into their  garments, most of them anathematising the sea life generally, and their  present ship in particular.  For forecastle Jack is a curious creature,  and, if you are to believe him, \"last voyage\" is invariably the supreme  period of his life, wherein has been crowded the utmost comfort and  pleasure and the most remarkable adventures, while the ship on board  which he happens to be at the moment is, as invariably, the slowest,  ugliest, most uncomfortable, and most rotten tub that he ever had the  ill luck to ship in.  And all this, mind you, as likely as not before  the much-maligned craft has passed out through the dock gates,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21070"],[0,"A Middy of the Slave Squadron: A West African Story (#6)"],[1,"lers, leaving a  narrow channel of unbroken water, wide enough to enable a couple of  craft of moderate tonnage to pass each other comfortably.    And well was it for us that this was the case; for as we approached the  river's mouth we saw that the ground-swell was rapidly increasing in  weight, and that the surf was breaking upon the beach with such violence  that if it happened to be also breaking upon the bar it would be quite  useless for us to attempt to enter the river.  Indeed, so formidable did  the appearance of the surf at length become that the captain ordered the  rest of the boats to heave-to, while we in the gig went ahead to  reconnoitre and inspect the condition of the bar.  This was a bit of  work for which the gig was peculiarly well adapted, for she was a  beautifully modelled boat, double-ended, with a long flat floor--a  splendid sailer, and a boat which would claw off a lee shore in almost  any weather, the skipper having had her fitted with a good, deep, false  keel.    The wind was blowing a moderately fresh breeze from the westward at the  time, thus, the rest of the boats having hove-to, it did not take us  very long to run in far enough to get a sight of the bar.  This was a  rather trying experience for the nerves of us all; for the surf was  pounding on the beach ahead of us in a constant succession of towering  walls of water, that reared themselves to a height of fully thirty feet  ere they curled over and broke in thunder so deafening that we presently  found it impossible to make our voices heard above its continuous roar.  But the skipper, standing up in the stern-sheets, soon detected the  smooth, narrow strip of unbroken water, and directed the coxswain to  shift his helm for it.  I sprang up on a thwart and waved a small white  flag as a signal to the other boats to fill away and follow us; and as  soon as we had reached the very middle of the channel we rounded-to and  lowered our sail, remaining where we were to act as a guide to the other  boats.    Keeping our position with the aid of a couple of oars thrown over to  enable us to stem the out-flowing current, which we now began to feel,  we allowed the other boats to pass in over the bar and reach the smooth  water before us; then, hoisting our sail again, we followed them in and  presently resumed our position at the head of the line.    The change from the scene of wind-flecked blue sea, stately march of the  swell, and thunderous roar and creaming froth of the breakers outside to  the oil-smooth, mud-laden, strong-smelling river, with its tiny,  swirling eddies here and there, its mangrove-lined banks, and its  silence, through which the roar of the surf came to us over the  intervening sand spit, mellowed and subdued by distance, was so marked  that, although this was by no means my first experience of that kind of  thing, I found myself rubbing my eyes as though I were by no means  certain that I was awake; and I noticed others doing the same.  A sharp  word from the skipper, however, cautioning all hands to maintain a smart  look-out, soon brought to us the realisation of our surroundings; for  the river here was narrow, being not more than half a mile wide, with a  number of small islets dotted about it, any one of which might prove to  be the hiding-place of a formidable foe.  When at length we had passed  these without interference, and had reached the point where the river  began to widen out somewhat, we were no better off, but rather the  worse; for here the stream was encumbered with extensive sandbanks, to  avoid which we were compelled to approach the margin of the river so  closely that a well-arranged ambush might have practically annihilated  us before we could have effected a landing through the thick, viscid mud  and the almost impenetrable growth of mangroves that divided the waters  of the river from the solid ground of the shore.  Fortunately for us,  the slavers appeared unaccountably to have overlooked the admirable  opportunities thus afforded for frustrating an attack; or possibly, as  we thought, it was that they had fully relied upon the power of the  decoy schooner to draw us away from the coast, and thus leave the way  free for them to escape.    The passage of this part of the river occupied us until noon, and was  rather trying to the nerves of all hands, for not only were we  constantly exposed to attack by the slavers, but there were the natives  also to be reckoned with; and these, as we all knew, had a most  objectionable habit of using poisoned arrows, the slightest wound from  which was invariably followed by death after some eight to twelve hours  of dreadful suffering.  Shortly after noon we emerged from these natural  entanglements into a long reach of the river where the stream expanded  to a width of some three and a half miles, with a narrow deep-water  channel running about midway between the banks.  Here we were quite free  from any possibility of ambush of any kind; and with a sigh of intense  relief the captain gave the word to pipe to dinner.    About four o'clock in the afternoon we arrived at a point where the  river again narrowed to a width of about a mile; but some two miles  farther on it again widened out, and changed its direction, trending  away almost due east, or about at right angles to its former course; and  this, according to the information in the skipper's possession,  indicated that we were nearing our destination.  Drawing from his pocket  a sketch chart which he had already consulted several times during our  passage up the river, he again studied it intently for several minutes,  carefully comparing the configurations delineated upon it with our  actual surroundings; then, apparently satisfied with the result, he  refolded the paper, returned it to his pocket, and directed the coxswain  to bear away a couple of points toward a projecting point--which we  afterwards discovered to be the western extremity of an islet--on the  far side of the river.  As we approached the spot for which we were  heading it became apparent that there were two islets instead of one  between us and the river bank; and a quarter of an hour later the gig,  with the rest of the flotilla following her, glided in between these two  islets, and, lowering her sails, made the signal for the other boats to  anchor.    The boats were now completely concealed from all possible observation,  for we soon saw that the islets between which we were anchored consisted  merely of mud-banks thickly overgrown with mangroves, and absolutely  uninhabitable even by natives; for there did not appear to be an inch of  ground upon either of the islets sufficiently solid to support even a  reed hut, while the mangroves were tall enough and grew densely enough  to hide the boats from all possible observation from the mainland.  The  only question which now troubled us was whether the presence of the  boats in the river had already been observed.  If the slavers had placed  absolute confidence in the success of their plan to draw us away from  the coast by means of the decoy schooner, they might not have troubled  to keep a look-out; but if they were as cautious as such gentry usually  are, and had left nothing to chance, it would be scarcely possible for  the approach of the boats to have passed undetected.  This was the  question to which the captain was now going to seek an answer.        CHAPTER THREE.    AT THE CAMMA LAGOON.    Distant about a mile from our hiding-place, there was, according to the  captain's rough sketch map, a small peninsula enclosing a little bay, or  creek, at the inner extremity of which was situated King Olomba's town;  and it was here that we were led to believe we should find the slavers  busily engaged in shipping their human cargoes.  And truly, as seen from  the boats, the ingenuity of man could scarcely have devised a more  perfect spot whereat to conduct the infamous traffic; for the  configuration of the land was such that boats, entering the river merely  on an exploring expedition, without having first obtained, like  ourselves, special information, would never have suspected the existence  of the creek, or of the town which lay concealed within it.  Nor would  it have been possible to detect the presence of slave craft in the  creek; for the peninsula which masked it was thickly overgrown with  lofty trees which would effectually conceal all but the upper spars of a  ship, and these would doubtless be struck or housed while she was lying  in the creek.    The skipper having explained to the officers in command of the other  boats what he intended to do, and given them instructions how to act in  the event of certain contingencies arising, the gig's crew manned their  oars, and we pulled away in the direction of the peninsula, which we  reached in the course of a few minutes.  Now our real troubles began,  for our object was not only to reach the peninsula but also to land upon  and walk across it until a spot could be found from which, unseen  ourselves, we could obtain a clear view of the creek and everything in  it, and upon approaching the shore of the peninsula we discovered that,  in common with as much of the river bank as we had yet seen, it  consisted, first of all, of a wide belt of soft, fathomless mud  overgrown with mangrove trees; the mud being of such a consistency that  to attempt to walk upon it would mean being swallowed up and suffocated  in it, for a sixteen-foot oar could be thrust perpendicularly into it  with scarcely any effort, although when one of the men incautiously  tried the experiment, it was only with the utmost difficulty that he was  able to withdraw the oar, so tenaciously did the mud cling to it.  Yet  it was not sufficiently liquid to allow of the gig being forced through  it, even if the thickly clustering mangrove roots would have permitted  of such a proceeding.  The only alternative left to us, therefore, was  to"]]]
