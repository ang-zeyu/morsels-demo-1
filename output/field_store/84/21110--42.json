Charlie did his best to attend to what the invisible and inarticulate  voice was saying, and tried to recall what his father had told him about  not letting new scenes and new companions tempt him to forget of neglect  the lessons of duty and religion which he had learned at his parents'  home; but it was not easy work, and to him it was a relief when all was  over, and the boys proceeded to file out of the chapel.    \"Where are they all going?\" he inquired, turning round to where Tom  Drift had been standing.    That young man, however, was no longer there.  He had gone off to enjoy  the questionable luxury of roast potatoes in a friend's study, entirely  forgetting his young and forlorn charge.    Charlie was puzzled.  He was sure he could never find his way back to  Mrs Packer's through such a maze of passages, and he knew not where  else to go.    As he stood watching in despair the last remnant of his fellow-  worshippers passing out, and wondering what was to become of him, he  became aware of two big boys stopping in front of him and looking at  him.    \"That's him!\" said one, whose grammar was perhaps not his strongest  point at this moment.    \"Why, he's only a kid!\" said the other, who, being sixteen, felt fully  justified in so designating my young master.    \"I can't help that, I know it's him,\" said the first.    \"I say, you fellow,\" added he, addressing Charlie, \"wasn't it you drove  up to the front door in a cab this afternoon?\"    Charlie trembled in his shoes.  More than once had his heart misgiven  him, he had committed an unpardonable offence in the mode of his advent  to Randlebury; and now, with these two awful accusers before him, he  felt as if his doom was come.    \"I'm very sorry,\" he began; \"yes, it was--I didn't mean, I'm sure.\"    \"What did you do it for, if you didn't mean, you young muff?--why don't  you go off to bed?\"    \"Because I don't know where to go, and Tom Drift--\"    \"Do you know Tom Drift?\"    \"Yes--that is, I met his mother,\" stammered Charlie, becoming more and  more embarrassed.    Both the big boys burst out laughing.  \"What a treat for his mother!\"  said one.  \"I suppose she told you Tom was a real nice boy?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I thought so; so he is, isn't he, Joe?\" and both boys laughed again.    \"And she gave you a kiss to take to him?\"    \"No,\" said Charlie, blushing scarlet; \"she did give me a kiss, but not  for him.\"    It was a hard effort for the poor boy to come out with this admission,  but candour compelled it.    \"Oh, she gave you one for yourself, did she?\" and again they laughed.  \"What a dear old noodle she must be!\"    \"She was very kind to me,\" said Charlie, not liking to hear his friend  made fun of.    Just then a master came by.    \"What are you three boys doing here?\" he asked.    \"Please, sir, this is a new boy,\" replied he who had been called Joe,  \"and he doesn't know where to go.\"    \"Hum!\" said the master, \"I thought Mrs Packer would have seen after  that.  Let me see.  You had better take him to your dormitory to-night,  Halliday; there's a vacant bed there.  Bring him to the doctor's room  after breakfast to-morrow,\" and he passed on.    \"Here's a treat!\" exclaimed Joe, with a not ill-natured grin.  \"This  comes of stopping and talking to young scarecrows.  Come along,  youngster; think yourself lucky you've been handed over to me.  I wear  patent leather boots, and they don't need as much blacking as some of  the fellows'.\"    Charlie was at a loss to understand what the material of Master  Halliday's boots had to do with his own alleged good fortune in falling  into the hands of such a guardian; but he said nothing, and, reassured  by the good-humoured face of his conductor, followed him cheerfully from  the chapel.    \"Hullo, Joe! got a donkey at last?\" cried some one, as the two wended  their way up the stairs leading to the dormitories.    \"Looks like it,\" was Joe's reply.    It was not very long before Charlie learned that the four-footed beast  thus vaguely referred to was a polite term which the big boys at  Randlebury used to designate their fags.    \"Come in here,\" said his conductor, turning in at a small door.    Charlie found himself inside a small apartment, measuring about ten feet  square, lighted by a small window, warmed by a small fire, decorated  with a small bookcase, and furnished with a small table, two small  chairs, and a small cupboard.    \"This is my den; and mind when you clean the window you don't crack that  pane more than it is; and when you brush my things, you know, see the  shelf isn't dirty, because I sometimes keep my worms there--do you hear?  And now come along to bed; they put out lights at half-past nine.\"    The mention of the time recalled me instinctively to Charlie's thoughts.  He could not resist the temptation, suggested half by anxiety and half  by vanity, of taking me out and looking at me.    \"Hullo!  What, have you got a watch?\"    \"Yes,\" said Charlie meekly, not exactly knowing whether his companion  would be admiring or indignant with him.    \"More than I have,\" was all Joe's rejoinder.    Charlie's generosity was at once touched.    \"Oh, never mind, we can go shares sometimes, if you like, you know,\"  said he, not without an effort.    \"I don't want your watch,\" was Master Halliday's somewhat ungracious  reply.  \"Let's have a look at it, will you?\"    He took me, and examined me; and evidently would not have objected to be  the possessor of a watch himself, though he tried to make it appear it  was a matter of indifference to him.    \"Why don't you get your father to give you one?\" asked Charlie  innocently.    \"Because I haven't got a father.\"    \"Not got a father!  Oh, I am sorry!\" and the starting tears in the  little fellow's eyes testified only too truly to his sincerity.  \"Look  here,\" he added, \"do take the watch, please; perhaps you would like it,  and my father would give me another.\"    Joe Halliday gazed at his young fag in amazement.    \"Why, you are a queer chap,\" he said.  \"I wouldn't take your watch for  anything; but I tell you what, I'll ask you the time whenever I want to  know.\"    \"Will you really?\" cried the delighted Charlie.  \"How jolly!\"    \"And look here,\" continued Halliday, \"take my advice, and don't go  offering your watch to everybody who hasn't got a father, or some of  them might take you at your word, and then you'd look foolish.  Come  along now.\"    And he led the boy into the dormitory, where there were about twenty  beds, most of them already occupied by boys, and the rest waiting for  occupants, who were rapidly undressing in different parts of the room.    \"Look sharp and tumble in,\" said Joe, pointing out the bed Charlie was  to have.  \"There's only five minutes more.\"    Charlie, with all the naturalness of innocence, knelt, as he was always  used to do, and said his prayers, adding a special petition for his dear  absent parents, and another for the poor boy who hadn't got a father.    He was wholly unaware of the curiosity he had excited by his entrance  into the dormitory, still less did he imagine the sensation which his  simple act of devotion was creating.  Twenty pairs of eyes stared at the  unwonted spectacle of a boy saying his prayers, and many were the  whispered comments which passed from lip to lip.  No one however (had  any been so inclined) stirred either to disturb or molest him--an  immunity secured to him as much perhaps by the fact of his being under  the protection of so redoubtable a champion as Halliday as by any  special feeling of sympathy for his act.    The good example was not, however, wholly lost, for that same night,  after the lights were out, and when silence reigned in the room, more  than one boy covered his head with his sheet and tried to recall one of  the early prayers of his childhood.    As for Charlie, with me and the knife under his pillow, he slept the  sleep of the just, and dreamt of home; and I can answer for it his weary  head never turned once the livelong night.        CHAPTER FIVE.    HOW MY MASTER ENTERED AND QUITTED THE HEAD MASTER'S STUDY TWICE IN ONE  MORNING.    Charlie's first care in the morning was, as I need hardly say, to pull  me out from under his pillow, and consult me as to the time.  None of  his companions were astir, so that, not having anything particular to  do, he lay still, and abandoned himself to the luxury of an idle half-  hour in bed.    His spirits were so greatly revived by his night's rest that he forgot  both the novelty and the loneliness of his position, and fell to  polishing first his knife and then me as merrily as if he were at home.  What a difference a sound sleep often makes in the aspect of our  affairs!  Twelve hours ago he had felt as if he could never be  sufficiently bold as to whistle within the walls of Randlebury, and now  the first sight and sound which greeted Halliday's returning senses, as  he sat up and rubbed his eyes, was his young _protege_ whistling to  himself like a lark, and brightening me up with all his might with the  corner of his blanket till I glowed again at nearly a red heat.    \"Who's that kicking up that row whistling?\" growled a voice from the far  end of the room; \"because I'd like to shy a boot at his head.\"    At this Charlie subsided, not desiring to gratify his unknown auditor in  his benevolent desire, and very soon after jumped up and dressed  himself.    \"Look here, youngster,\" said Joe, \"you'd better do my study now, as you  mayn't have time after breakfast to-day.  You know which room it is--the  sixth on your right when you get downstairs.  Cut along, look sharp,  you've a good half-hour.\"    Charlie made his way down to the lion's den, meeting on his way several  other discontented fags, bound on similar errands.  He set himself to  clean the window, tidy the cupboard, and generally put things"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21036"],[0,"My Friend Smith: A Story of School and City Life (#6)"],[1," dreary day seemed as if it would never come to an end.  My spirits  sank when, after \"preparation,\" we were ordered up stairs to tea.  How  _could_ one enjoy tea poured out by Miss Henniker?  Some people call it  the \"cup that cheers.\"  Let them take tea one afternoon at Stonebridge  House, and they will soon be cured of that notion!  I got another bad  mark during the meal for scooping up the sugar at the bottom of my cup  with my spoon.    \"Surely,\" thought I, \"they'll let us read or play, or do as we like,  after tea for a bit?\"    Vain hope!  The meal ended, we again went down to our desks, where  sheets of paper were distributed to each, and we were ordered to \"write  home\"!  Write home under Miss Henniker's eye!  That was worse than  anything!    I began, however, as best I could.  Of course, my letter was to Mrs  Hudson.  Where she was, was the only home I knew.  I was pretty certain,  of course, the letter would be looked over, but for all that I tried not  to let the fact make any difference, and, as I warmed up to my task, I  found my whole soul going out into my letter.  I forgot all about its  contents being perused, and was actually betrayed into shedding a few  tears at the thought of my dear absent protectress.    \"I wish I was back with you,\" I wrote.  \"It's _miserable_ here.  The  sweets you gave me have been stolen by that horrid old--\"    At this interesting juncture I was conscious of somebody standing behind  me and looking over my shoulder.  It was Miss Henniker!    \"Give me that,\" she said.    I snatched the letter up and tore it into pieces.  I could stand a good  deal, as I have said, but even a boy of twelve must draw the line  somewhere.    Miss Henniker stood motionless as I destroyed my letter, and then said,  in icy tones--    \"Follow me, Batchelor.\"    I rose meekly, and followed her--I cared not if it was to the gallows!  She led me to her parlour, and ordered me to stand in the corner.  Then  she rang her bell.    \"Tell Mr Ladislaw I should like to see him,\" said she to the servant.    In due time Mr Ladislaw appeared, and the case for the prosecution  forthwith opened.  My misdemeanours for the entire day were narrated,  culminating with this last heinous offence.    \"Batchelor,\" said Miss Henniker, \"repeat to Mr Ladislaw word for word  what you were writing when I came to you.\"    I know not what spirit of meekness came over me.  I did as I was told,  and repeated the sentence verbatim down to the words, \"The sweets you  gave me have been stolen by that horrid old--\"    \"Old what?\" said Mr Ladislaw.    \"Old what?\" said Miss Henniker, I hesitated.    \"Come, now, say what you were going to write,\" demanded Mr Ladislaw.    \"Old what, Batchelor?\" reiterated the Henniker, keeping her eyes on me.    I must be honest!    \"Old beast,\" I said in a low tone.    \"I thought so,\" said the lady.  \"Batchelor has called me a beast twice  since he came here, Mr Ladislaw.\"    \"Batchelor must be punished,\" said Mr Ladislaw, who, I could not help  privately thinking, was a little afraid of Miss Henniker himself.  \"Come  to my study, sir.\"    I came, followed of course by the Henniker; and in Mr Ladislaw's study  I was caned on both hands.  Miss Henniker would, I fancy, have laid it  on a little harder than the master did.  Still, it was enough to make me  smart.    But the smart within was far worse than that without.    \"Return to the class-room now, and write at once to your uncle, Mr  Jakeman,\" said Miss Henniker, \"and to no one else.\"    I returned to the room, where I found an eager whispered discussion  going on.  When a boy was taken off for punishment by the Henniker,  those who were left always had a brief opportunity for conversation.    The subject of discussion, I found, was Smith, who sat apart, with no  paper before him, apparently exempt from the general task.  As usual, he  was looking solemnly round him, but in no way to explain the mystery.  At last Hawkesbury, the \"pet\" of the school--in other words, the only  boy who seemed to get on with Miss Henniker and Mr Ladislaw--had walked  up to Mr Hashford's desk, where the usher sat in temporary authority,  and had said, \"Oh, Smith, the new boy, hasn't any paper, Mr Hashford.\"    \"No, I was told not to give him any,\" said the usher, terrified lest the  Henniker should return.    \"I wonder why?\" said Hawkesbury.    \"Yes, it is strange,\" replied Mr Hashford; \"but please go to your  place, Hawkesbury; Miss Henniker will return.\"    Hawkesbury had reported this brief conversation to his fellows, and this  was what had given rise to the discussion I found going on when I  returned from my caning.  It was soon cut short by the Henniker's  reappearance; but the mystery became all the greater when it was seen  that no notice was taken of the new boy's idleness, and that at the  close of the exercise, when we were all called upon to bring up our  letters, his name was distinctly omitted.    My effusion to my uncle was brief and to the point.    Dear Uncle Jakeman,--Miss Henniker wishes me to say that I have had five  bad marks to-day.  I have also been caned hard on both hands for writing  to dear Mrs Hudson, and for calling Miss Henniker bad names.  I hope  you are very well.  Believe me, dear uncle, your affectionate nephew,--    Fred.  Batchelor.    With the exception of striking out the \"dear\" before Mrs Hudson this  letter was allowed to pass.    In due time and to my great relief the bell rang for bed, and glad of  any chance of forgetting the hateful place, I went up stairs to the  dormitory.    The new boy, I found, was to occupy the bed next mine, at which I was  rather pleased than otherwise.  I could not make out why I should take a  fancy to Smith, but somehow I did; and when once during the night I  happened to wake, and heard what sounded very much like a smothered sob  in the bed next mine, I at least had the consolation of being sure I was  not the only miserable boy at Stonebridge House.        CHAPTER FOUR.    HOW SMITH AND I TOOK A BREATH OF FRESH AIR AND PAID FOR IT.    As \"circumstances over which I had no control\" prevented my joining my  fellow troublesome and backward boys in their daily retreat to the  playground for the next few days, I had only a limited opportunity of  seeing how the new boy settled down to his new surroundings.    Inside Stonebridge House we were all alike, all equally subdued and  \"Henpecked.\"  The playground was really the only place where any display  of character could be made; and as for three days I was a prisoner,  Smith remained as much a mystery to me at the end of the week as he had  been on the day of his arrival.    I could, however, guess from his looks and the looks of the others that  he was having rather a bad time of it out there.  Hawkesbury used to  come in with such a gracious smile every afternoon that I was certain  something was wrong; and Philpot's flushed face, and Rathbone's scowl,  and Flanagan's unusual gravity, all went to corroborate the suspicion.  But Smith's face and manner were the most tell-tale.  The first day he  had seemed a little doubtful, but gradually the lines of his mouth  pulled tighter at the corners, and his eyes flashed oftener, and I could  guess easily enough that he at least had not found his heart's content  at Stonebridge House.    My term of penal servitude expired on Sunday; and in some respects I  came out of it better than I had gone in.  For Mr Hashford had the  charge of all detained boys, and he, good-hearted, Henniker-dreading  usher that he was, had spent the three days in drilling me hard in  decimal fractions; and so well too, that I actually came to enjoy the  exercise, and looked upon the \"repeating dot\" as a positive pastime.  Even Miss Henniker could not rob me of that pleasure.    \"Batchelor,\" whispered Flanagan to me, as we walked two and two to  church behind the Henniker that Sunday, \"that new fellow's an awfully  queer cove.  I can't make him out.\"    \"Nor can I.  But how's he been getting on the last day or two?\"    \"Getting on!  You never knew such scenes as we've had.  He's afraid of  nobody.  He licked Philpot to fits on Thursday--smashed him, I tell you.  You never saw such a demon as he is when his dander's up.  Then he  walked into Rathbone; and if Rathbone hadn't been a foot taller than  him, with arms as long as windmills, he'd have smashed Rathbone.\"    \"Did he try it on you?\"  I inquired.    \"No--why should he?\" said the sturdy Flanagan; \"time enough for that  when I make a brute of myself to him.  But I dare say he'd smash me too.  It's as good as a play, I tell you.  That time he did for Philpot he  was as quick with his right, and walked in under his man's guard, and  drove up at him, and took him on the flank just like--\"    \"A bad mark to Flanagan for talking, and to Batchelor for listening,\"  rose the voice of Miss Henniker in the street.    This public award made us both jump, and colour up too, for there were a  lot of ladies and gentlemen and young ladies close at hand, all of whom  must have distinctly heard the Henniker's genial observation.  However,  I was most curious to hear more of Smith.  Flanagan and I both had colds  the rest of the way and finished our conversation behind our  handkerchiefs.    \"Have you heard any more about him?\" asked I.  \"Not a word.  He's as  close as an owl.  Hawkesbury says Hashford told him he came here  straight from another school.  By the way--keep your handkerchief up,  man!--by the way, when I said he's afraid of no one, he _is_ afraid of  Hawkesbury, I fancy.  I don't know why--\"    \"I don't think I like Hawkesbury, either.  He's got such an everlasting  grin.\"    \"So will you have if you don't talk lower, you young idiot,\" said  Flanagan.  \"Yes, it's the grin that fetches Smith, I fancy.  I grinned  at him one day, meaning to be friendly, but he didn't half like it.\"    I laughed at this, greatly to Flanagan's wrath.  Luckily, however, no  evil consequences"]]]
