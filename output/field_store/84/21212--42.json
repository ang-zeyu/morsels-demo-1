Lee (#6)"],[1,"that peace would have been preserved; that  some way would have been found to save the country from the calamities  of war; and I then had no other intention than to pass the remainder of  my life as a private citizen. Two days afterward, upon the invitation  of the Governor of Virginia, I repaired to Richmond; found that the  Convention then in session had passed the ordinance withdrawing the  State from the Union; and accepted the commission of commander of its  forces, which was tendered me.    \"These are the ample facts of the case, and they show that Mr. Cameron  has been misinformed.    \"I am with great respect,    \"Your obedient servant,    \"R. E. Lee.\"    My father reached Richmond April 22, 1861. The next day he was  introduced to the Virginia Convention, and offered by them the command  of the military forces of his State. In his reply to Mr. John Janney,  the President, who spoke for the Convention, he said:    \"Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Convention: Deeply impressed  with the solemnity of the occasion on which I appear before you, and  profoundly grateful for the honour conferred upon me, I accept the  position your partiality has assigned me, though I would greatly have  preferred your choice should have fallen on one more capable.    \"Trusting to Almighty God, an approving conscience, and the aid of my  fellow citizens, I will devote myself to the defense and service of my  native State, in whose behalf alone would I have ever drawn my sword.\"    On April 26th, from Richmond, he wrote to his wife:    \"...I am very anxious about you. You have to move and make arrangements  to go to some point of safety, which you must select. The Mount Vernon  plate and pictures ought to be secured. Keep quiet while you remain and  in your preparation. War is inevitable, and there is no telling when  it will burst around you. Virginia, yesterday, I understand, joined the  Confederate States. What policy they may adopt I cannot conjecture. May  God bless and preserve you, and have mercy upon all our people, is the  constant prayer of your affectionate husband,    \"R. E. Lee.\"    On April 30th:    \"On going to my room last night I found my trunk and sword there, and  opening them this morning discovered the package of letters and was very  glad to learn you were all well and as yet peaceful. I fear the latter  state will not continue long.... I think therefore you had better  prepare all things for removal, that is, the plate, pictures, etc., and  be prepared at any moment. Where to go is the difficulty. When the war  commences no place will be exempt, in my opinion, and indeed all the  avenues into the State will be the scenes of military operations.    \"There is no prospect or intention of the Government to propose a truce.  Do not be deceived by it.... May God preserve you all and bring peace to  our distracted country.\"    Again to my mother at Arlington:    \"Richmond, May 2, 1861.    \"My dear Mary: I received last night your letter of the 1st, with  contents. It gave me great pleasure to learn that you are all well  and in peace. You know how pleased I should be to have you and my dear  daughters with me. That I fear can not be. There is no place that I can  expect to be but in the field, and there is no rest for me to look  to, but I want you to be in a place of safety.... We have only to  be resigned to God's will and pleasure, and do all we can for our  protection.... I have just received Custis's letter of the 30th,  inclosing the acceptance of my resignation. It is stated that it will  take effect April 25th. I resigned on the 20th, and wished it to take  effect that day. I cannot consent to its running on further, and he  must receive no pay, if they tender it, beyond that day, but return the  whole, if need be....\"    From another letter to my mother, dated May 8th:    \"...I grieve at the necessity that drives you from your home. I can  appreciate your feelings on the occasion, and pray that you may receive  comfort and strength in the difficulties that surround you. When I  reflect upon the calamity impending over the country, my own sorrows  sink into insignificance.... Be content and resigned to God's will. I  shall be able to write seldom. Write to me, as you letters will be my  greatest comfort. I send a check for $500; it is all I have in bank. Pay  the children's school expenses....\"    To my mother, still at Arlington:    \"Richmond, May 11, 1861.    \"I have received your letter of the 9th from Arlington. I had supposed  you were at Ravensworth.... I am glad to hear that you are at peace,  and enjoying the sweet weather and beautiful flowers. You had better  complete your arrangements and retire further from the scene of war. It  may burst upon you at any time. It is sad to think of the devastation,  if not ruin, it may bring upon a spot so endeared to us. But God's  will be done. We must be resigned. May He guard and keep you all, is my  constant prayer.\"    All this time my father was very hard at work organising and equipping  the volunteers who were pouring into Richmond from the Southern States,  but he was in constant correspondence with my mother, helping her all he  could in her arrangements for leaving her home. His letters show that he  thought of everything, even the least, and he gave the most particular  directions about his family, their effects, the servants, the horses,  the farm, pictures, plate, and furniture. Being called to Norfolk  suddenly, before going he wrote to my mother:    \"Richmond, May 16, 1861.    \"My Dear Mary: I am called down to Norfolk and leave this afternoon. I  expect to return Friday, but may be delayed. I write to advise you of my  absence, in case you should not receive answers to any letters that  may arrive. I have not heard from you since I last wrote; nor have I  anything to relate. I heard from my dear little Rob, who had an  attack of chills and fever. He hoped to escape the next paroxysm.... I  witnessed the opening of the convention [The Episcopal Convention of  the Diocese of Virginia] yesterday, and heard the good Bishop's [Bishop  Meade, of Virginia] sermon, being the 50th anniversary of his ministry.  It was a most impressive scene, and more than once I felt the tears  coming down my cheek. It was from the text, 'and Pharoh said unto Jacob,  how old art thou?' It was full of humility and self-reproach. I saw  Mr. Walker, Bishop Johns, Bishop Atkinson, etc. I have not been able  to attend any other services, and presume the session will not be  prolonged. I suppose it may be considered a small attendance. Should  Custis arrive during my absence, I will leave word for him to take my  room at the Spotswood till my return. Smith [His brother, S. S. Lee, C.  S. N.] is well and enjoys a ride in the afternoon with Mrs. Stannard.  The charming women, you know, always find him out. Give much love to  Cousin Anna, Nannie, and dear daughters. When Rob leaves the University  take him with you.    \"Truly and affectionately, R. E. Lee.\"    By this time my mother and all the family had left Arlington. My  brother, Custis, had joined my father in Richmond, the girls had gone to  Fauquier county, to visit relatives, and my mother to Ravensworth, about  ten miles from Arlington towards Fairfax Court House, where her aunt,  Mrs. A. M. Fitzhugh, lived. Always considerate of the happiness  and comfort of others, my father feared that his wife's presence at  Ravensworth might possibly bring annoyance to \"Cousin Anna,\" as he  called our aunt, and he wrote to my mother, urging her not to remain  there. He sympathised with her in having to leave her home, which she  never saw again.    \"Richmond, May 25, 1861.    \"I have been trying, dearest Mary, ever since the receipt of your letter  by Custis, to write to you. I sympathise deeply in your feelings at  leaving your dear home. I have experienced them myself, and they are  constantly revived. I fear we have not been grateful enough for the  happiness there within our reach, and our Heavenly Father has found  it necessary to deprive us of what He has given us. I acknowledge my  ingratitude, my transgressions, and my unworthiness, and submit with  resignation to what he thinks proper to inflict upon me. We must trust  all then to him, and I do not think it prudent or right for you to  return there, while the United States troops occupy that country. I have  gone over all this ground before, and have just written Cousin Anna on  the subject.    \"While writing, I received a telegram from Cousin John Goldsborough [a  cousin of Mrs. Fitzhugh], urging your departure 'South.' I suppose he is  impressed with the risk of your present position, and in addition to the  possibility, or probability, of personal annoyance to yourself, I fear  your presence may provoke annoyance in Cousin Anna. But unless Cousin  Anna goes with you, I shall be distressed about her being there alone.  If the girls went to 'Kinloch' or 'Eastern View,' you and Cousin Anna  might take care of yourselves, because you could get in the carriage and  go off in an emergency. But I really am afraid that you may prove more  harm than comfort to her. Mr. Wm. C. Rives has just been in to say that  if you and Cousin Anna will go to his house, he will be very glad for  you to stay as long as you please. That his son has a commodious house  just opposite his, unoccupied, partially furnished; that you could, if  you prefer, take that, bring up servants and what you desire, and remain  there as independent as at home.... I must now leave the matter to you,  and pray that God may guard you. I have no time for more. I know and  feel the discomfort of your position, but it cannot be helped, and we  must bear our trials like Christians.... If you and Cousin Anna choose  to come here, you know how happy we shall be to see you. I shall take  the field as soon now as I can....    \"Ever yours truly and devotedly,    \"R. E. Lee\"    Three days later he was at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23245"],[0,"Ancient Ballads and Legends of Hindustan (#6)"],[1,"own worst and direst foe        If it choose evil, and in tracks      Forbidden, for its pleasure go.

Satyavan's life I may not grant,        Nor take before its term thy life,      But I am not all adamant,        I feel for thee, thou faithful wife!      Ask thou aught else, and let it be        Some good thing for thyself or thine,      And I shall give it, child, to thee,        If any power on earth be mine.\"        \"Well be it so. My husband's sire,        Hath lost his sight and fair domain,      Give to his eyes their former fire,        And place him on his throne again.\"      \"It shall be done. Go back, my child,        The hour wears late, the wind feels cold,      The path becomes more weird and wild,        Thy feet are torn, there's blood, behold!      Thou feelest faint from weariness,        Oh try to follow me no more;      Go home, and with thy presence bless        Those who thine absence there deplore.\"        \"No weariness, O Death, I feel,        And how should I, when by the side      Of Satyavan? In woe and weal        To be a helpmate swears the bride.      This is my place; by solemn oath        Wherever thou conductest him      I too must go, to keep my troth;        And if the eye at times should brim,      'Tis human weakness, give me strength        My work appointed to fulfil,      That I may gain the crown at length        The gods give those who do their will.        \"The power of goodness is so great        We pray to feel its influence      For ever on us. It is late,        And the strange landscape awes my sense;      But I would fain with thee go on,        And hear thy voice so true and kind;      The false lights that on objects shone        Have vanished, and no longer blind,      Thanks to thy simple presence. Now        I feel a fresher air around,      And see the glory of that brow        With flashing rubies fitly crowned.        \"Men call thee Yama--conqueror,        Because it is against their will      They follow thee,--and they abhor        The Truth which thou wouldst aye instil.      If they thy nature knew aright,        O god, all other gods above!      And that thou conquerest in the fight        By patience, kindness, mercy, love,      And not by devastating wrath,        They would not shrink in childlike fright      To see thy shadow on their path,        But hail thee as sick souls the light.\"        \"Thy words, Savitri, greet mine ear        As sweet as founts that murmur low      To one who in the deserts drear        With parched tongue moves faint and slow,      Because thy talk is heart-sincere,        Without hypocrisy or guile;      Demand another boon, my dear,        But not of those forbad erewhile,      And I shall grant it, ere we part:        Lo, the stars pale,--the way is long,      Receive thy boon, and homewards start,        For ah, poor child, thou art not strong.\"        \"Another boon! My sire the king        Beside myself hath children none,      Oh grant that from his stock may spring        A hundred boughs.\" \"It shall be done.      He shall be blest with many a son        Who his old palace shall rejoice.\"      \"Each heart-wish from thy goodness won,        If I am still allowed a choice,      I fain thy voice would ever hear,        Reluctant am I still to part,      The way seems short when thou art near        And Satyavan, my heart's dear heart.        \"Of all the pleasures given on earth        The company of the good is best,      For weariness has never birth        In such a commerce sweet and blest;      The sun runs on its wonted course,        The earth its plenteous treasure yields,      All for their sake, and by the force        Their prayer united ever wields.      Oh let me, let me ever dwell        Amidst the good, where'er it be,      Whether in lowly hermit-cell        Or in some spot beyond the sea.        \"The favours man accords to men        Are never fruitless, from them rise      A thousand acts beyond our ken        That float like incense to the skies;      For benefits can ne'er efface,        They multiply and widely spread,      And honour follows on their trace.        Sharp penances, and vigils dread,      Austerities, and wasting fasts,        Create an empire, and the blest      Long as this spiritual empire lasts        Become the saviours of the rest.\"        \"O thou endowed with every grace        And every virtue,--thou whose soul      Appears upon thy lovely face,        May the great gods who all control      Send thee their peace. I too would give        One favour more before I go;      Ask something for thyself, and live        Happy, and dear to all below,      Till summoned to the bliss above.        Savitri ask, and ask unblamed.\"--      She took the clue, felt Death was Love,        For no exceptions now he named,        And boldly said,--\"Thou knowest, Lord,        The inmost hearts and thoughts of all!      There is no need to utter word,        Upon thy mercy sole, I call.      If speech be needful to obtain        Thy grace,--oh hear a wife forlorn,      Let my Satyavan live again        And children unto us be born,      Wise, brave, and valiant.\" \"From thy stock        A hundred families shall spring      As lasting as the solid rock,        Each son of thine shall be a king.\"        As thus he spoke, he loosed the knot        The soul of Satyavan that bound,      And promised further that their lot        In pleasant places should be found      Thenceforth, and that they both should live        Four centuries, to which the name      Of fair Savitri, men would give,--        And then he vanished in a flame.      \"Adieu, great god!\" She took the soul,        No bigger than the human thumb,      And running swift, soon reached her goal,        Where lay the body stark and dumb.        She lifted it with eager hands        And as before, when he expired,      She placed the head upon the bands        That bound her breast which hope new-fired,      And which alternate rose and fell;        Then placed his soul upon his heart      Whence like a bee it found its cell,        And lo, he woke with sudden start!      His breath came low at first, then deep,        With an unquiet look he gazed,      As one awaking from a sleep        Wholly bewildered and amazed.      PART V.        As consciousness came slowly back        He recognised his loving wife--      \"Who was it, Love, through regions black        Where hardly seemed a sign of life      Carried me bound? Methinks I view        The dark face yet--a noble face,      He had a robe of scarlet hue,        And ruby crown; far, far through space      He bore me, on and on, but now,\"--        \"Thou hast been sleeping, but the man      With glory on his kingly brow,        Is gone, thou seest, Satyavan!        \"O my beloved,--thou art free!        Sleep which had bound thee fast, hath left      Thine eyelids. Try thyself to be!        For late of every sense bereft      Thou seemedst in a rigid trance;        And if thou canst, my love, arise,      Regard the night, the dark expanse        Spread out before us, and the skies.\"      Supported by her, looked he long        Upon the landscape dim outspread,      And like some old remembered song        The past came back,--a tangled thread.        \"I had a pain, as if an asp        Gnawed in my brain, and there I lay      Silent, for oh! I could but gasp,        Till someone came that bore away      My spirit into lands unknown:        Thou, dear, who watchedst beside me,--say      Was it a dream from elfland blown,        Or very truth,--my doubts to stay.\"      \"O Love, look round,--how strange and dread        The shadows of the high trees fall,      Homeward our path now let us tread,        To-morrow I shall tell thee all.        \"Arise! Be strong! Gird up thy loins!        Think of our parents, dearest friend!      The solemn darkness haste enjoins,        Not likely is it soon to end.      Hark! Jackals still at distance howl,        The day, long, long will not appear,      Lo, wild fierce eyes through bushes scowl,        Summon thy courage, lest I fear.      Was that the tiger's sullen growl?        What means this rush of many feet?      Can creatures wild so near us prowl?        Rise up, and hasten homewards, sweet!\"        He rose, but could not find the track,        And then, too well, Savitri knew      His wonted force had not come back.        She made a fire, and from the dew      Essayed to shelter him. At last        He nearly was himself again,--      Then vividly rose all the past,        And with the past, new fear and pain.      \"What anguish must my parents feel        Who wait for me the livelong hours!      Their sore wound let us haste to heal        Before it festers, past our powers:        \"For broken-hearted, they may die!        Oh hasten dear,--now I am strong,      No more I suffer, let us fly,        Ah me! each minute seems so long.      They told me once, they could not live        Without me, in their feeble age,      Their food and water I must give        And help them in the last sad stage      Of earthly life, and that Beyond        In which a son can help by rites.      Oh what a love is theirs--how fond!        Whom now Despair, perhaps, benights.        \"Infirm herself, my mother dear        Now guides, methinks, the tottering feet      Of my blind father, for they hear        And hasten eagerly to meet      Our fancied steps. O faithful wife        Let us on wings fly back again,      Upon their safety hangs my life!\"        He tried his feelings to restrain,"]]]
