Iron duties were put up in 1818 and again in 1824,  from which date for ten years they ranged between forty and one hundred  per cent. The whole tendency of tariff rates was strongly upward. The  duty upon all dutiables averaged between 1816 and 1824 only twenty-four  and a half per cent; from 1824 to 1828 the average was thirty-two and a  half per cent. Importation remained copious, notwithstanding, which made  the cry for protection louder than ever.    [1828]    From Quincy Adams's presidency the tariff question becomes on the one  hand political, dividing Whigs from Democrats about exactly, which had  never been the case before, and on the other, sectional, the West, the  Centre, and now also the East, pitted against the solid South, except  Louisiana. The year 1824 heard Webster's last speech for free trade and  saw Calhoun's and Jackson's last vote for protection. However, so strong  was the protectionist sentiment in the XXth Congress, though democratic,  that free-traders could hope to defeat the new tariff bill of 1828 only  by rendering it odious to New England. They therefore conspired to make  prohibitive its rates for Smyrna wool, and nearly so those on iron,  hemp, and cordage for ship-building; also on molasses, the raw material  for rum, whereon no drawback was longer to be allowed if it was  exported.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  John Quincy Adams. From a picture by Gilbert Stuart.      The Whigs had arranged, to be now passed, a series of minimum rates on  woollens, by which all costing over fifty cents a square yard were to  pay as if costing $2.50, and all over this as if costing $4.00. The rate  was to be forty per cent. the first year, forty-five the second, and  fifty thereafter.    This illustrates the famous \"minimum principle,\" which has played such a  figure in all our tariff history since 1816, its effect being always to  make the tariff much higher than it seems. Thus in the case before us,  most of the woollens then imported cost about ninety cents. If based on  this price, the tariff would be thirty-six per cent., but if based on  $2.50 as the price, it would mount up to one hundred and ten per cent.  To prevent this and to render the bill still more unpalatable to the  Whigs, the Democrats introduced a dollar \"minimum,\" so that the tariff  on the bulk of our imported woollens, costing, as just stated, about  ninety cents, would come in at forty-four and four-tenths per cent.    But as this was after all more vigorous protection than woollens had  before received, amounting, through minima, in some cases to over one  hundred per cent., sixteen out of the thirty-nine New England members,  led by Webster, accepted this universally odious tariff bill--the Tariff  of Abominations, it was called--as the preferable evil, and, aided by a  few Democrats in each house, made it a law. The average duty on  dutiables was now about forty-three and a third per cent.    No one can question that this high tariff worked injustice to the South.  It forced from her an undue share of the national taxes, as well as  extensive tribute to northern manufacturers. But in resenting the evil  she exaggerated it, mistakenly referring all the relative decrease in  her prosperity to tariff legislation, when a great part of it was due  simply to slavery. The South complained that selfishness and political  ambition, not patriotism or reason, determined the dominant policy, and  there was of course some truth in this. Moreover, as New England now  favored it, this policy bade fair to become permanent, and since the  tariff bills did not announce protection as their purpose, the  constitutionality of them could not be gotten before the courts.    [1830]    Nearly all the southern Legislatures consequently denounced the tariff  as unjust and as hostile to our fundamental law. Most of them were,  however, prudent enough to suggest no illegal remedies. Not so with  fiery South Carolina, where a large party, inspired by Calhoun, proposed  a bold nullification of the tariff act, virtually amounting to  secession. At a dinner in this interest at Washington, April 13, 1830,  Calhoun offered the toast: \"The Union; next to our liberty the most  dear; only to be preserved by respecting the rights of the States.\"    [1832]    John C. Calhoun was now, except, perhaps, Clay, the ablest and most  influential politician in all the South. Born in South Carolina in 1782,  of Irish-Presbyterian parentage, though poor and in youth ill-educated  like Clay and Jackson, his energy carried him through Yale College, and  through a course of legal study at Litchfield, Conn., where stood the  only law school then in America. November, 1811, found him a member of  Congress, on fire for war with Britain. Monroe's Secretary of War for  seven years from 1817, he was in 1825 elected Vice-President, and  reelected in 1828. He had meantime turned an ardent free-trader, and  seeing the North's predominance in the Union steadily increasing, had  built up a nullification theory based upon that of the Virginia and  Kentucky resolutions and the Hartford Convention, and upon the history  of the formation of our Constitution. He had worked out to his own  satisfaction the untenable view that each State had the right, not in  the way of revolution but under the Constitution itself--as a contract  between parties that had no superior referee--to veto national laws upon  its own judgment of their unconstitutionality.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  John C. Calhoun  From a picture by King at the Corcoran Art Gallery.      On this doctrine South Carolina presently proceeded to act. November 24,  1832, the convention of that State passed its nullification ordinance,  declaring the tariff acts of 1828 and 1832 \"null, void, and no law,\"  defying Congress to execute them there, and agreeing, upon the first use  of force for this purpose, to form a separate government.    This was the quintessence of folly even had good theory been behind it.  The tone of the proceeding was too hasty and peremptory. The decided  turn of public opinion and of congressional action in favor of large  reduction in duties was ignored. But the theory appealed to was clearly  wrong, and along with its advocates was sure to be reprobated by the  nation. A precious opportunity effectively to redress the evil  complained of was wantonly thrown away. Worst of all, from a tactical  point of view, South Carolina had miscalculated the spirit of President  Jackson. At the dinner referred to, his toast had been the memorable  words: \"Our Federal Union; it must be preserved.\" Men now saw that Old  Hickory was in earnest. General Scott, with troops and warships, was  ordered to Charleston.    The nullifiers receded, a course made easier by Clay's \"compromise  tariff\" of  1833, gradually reducing duties for the next ten years, and  enlarging the free list. From all duties of over twenty per cent. by the  act of 1832, one-tenth of the excess was to be stricken off on September  30, 1835, and another tenth every other year till 1841. Then one-half  the excess remaining was to fall, and in 1842 the rest, so that the end  of the last named year should find no duty over twenty per cent.    This episode, threatening as it was for a time, drew in its train  results the most happy, revealing with unprecedented vividness to most,  both the original nature of the Constitution as not a compact, and also  the might which national sentiment had attained since the War of 1812.  The doctrine of state rights was seen to have gradually lost, over the  greater part of the country, all its old vitality. Nearly every State  Legislature condemned the South Carolina pretensions, Democrats as  hearty in this as Whigs. Jackson's proclamation against them--impressive  and unanswerable--ran thus: \"The Constitution of the United States  forms a government, not a league; and whether it be formed by compact  between the States, or in any other manner, its character is the same  . . . . I consider the power to annul a law of the United States  incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by  the letter of the Constitution, and destructive of the great object for  which it was formed. . . . Our Constitution does not contain the  absurdity of giving power to make laws, and another power to resist  them. To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union is to  say that the United States are not a nation.\"      [Illustration: Small room with a desk, fireplace, and bookshelf.]  Calhoun's Library and Office.      The congressional debates which the nullification question evoked, among  the ablest in our parliamentary history, held the like high national  tenor. Calhoun's idea, though advocated by him with consummate skill,  was shown to be wholly chimerical. The doughty South Carolinian, from  this moment a waning force in American politics, was supported by Hayne  almost alone, the arguments of both melting into air before Webster's  masterful handling of constitutional history and law. Not questioning  the right of revolution, admitting the general government to be one of  \"strictly limited,\" even of \"enumerated, specified, and particularized  powers,\" the Massachusetts orator made it convincingly apparent that the  Calhoun programme could lead to nothing but anarchy. It was seen that  general and state governments emanate from the people with equal  immediacy, and that the language of the clause, \"the Constitution and  the laws of the United States made in pursuance thereof\" are \"the  supreme law of the land, anything in the constitution or laws of any  State to the contrary notwithstanding,\" means precisely what it says. To  this language little attention had apparently been paid till this time.        CHAPTER V.    MINOR PUBLIC QUESTIONS OF JACKSON'S \"REIGN\"    [1828]    Andrew Jackson was born March 15, 1767. His parents"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23755"],[0,"Birds of the Indian Hills (#6)"],[1," the sides of the  head and neck are black. There is a good deal of white in the tail,  which is short in this and in all species of nuthatch. The under-parts  are of a chestnut hue. The Himalayan nuthatch is very partial to the  red berries of _Arisaema jacque-montii_--a small plant of the family  to which the arums and the \"lords and ladies\" belong. Half a dozen  nuthatches attacking one of the red spikes of this plant present a  pretty sight. The berries ripen in July and August, and at Naini Tal  one rarely comes across a complete spike because the nuthatches pounce  upon every berry the moment it is ripe.      THE DICRURIDAE OR DRONGO FAMILY    The famous black drongo or king-crow (_Dicrurus ater_) is the type  of this well-marked family of passerine birds. The king-crow is about  the size of a bulbul, but he has a tail 6 or 7 inches long, which  is gracefully forked. His whole plumage is glossy jet black. He loves  to sit on a telegraph wire or other exposed perch, and thence make  sallies into the air after flying insects. He is one of the commonest  birds in India. His cheery call--half-squeak, half-whistle--must be  familiar to every Anglo-Indian. As to his character, I will repeat  what I have said elsewhere: \"The king-crow is the Black Prince of  the bird world--the embodiment of pluck. The thing in feathers of  which he is afraid has yet to be evolved. Like the mediaeval knight,  he goes about seeking those on whom he can perform some small feat  of arms. In certain parts of India he is known as the kotwal--the  official who stands forth to the poor as the impersonation of the  might and majesty of the British raj.\"    The king-crow is fairly abundant in the hills. On the lower ranges,  and especially at Almora, it is nearly as common as in the plains.  On the higher slopes, however, it is largely replaced by the ashy  drongo (_Dicrurus longicaudatus_). At most hill stations both  species occur. The note of the ashy drongo differs considerably from  that of the king-crow: otherwise the habits of the two species are  very similar. Take thirty-three per cent. off the pugnacity of the  king-crow and you will arrive at a fair estimate of that of the ashy  drongo. The latter looks like a king-crow with an unusually long tail,  a king-crow of which the black plumage has worn grey like an old  broadcloth coat.    The handsome _Bhimraj_ or larger racket-tailed drongo (_Dissemurus  paradiseus_), a glorified king-crow with a tail fully 20 inches in  length, is a Himalayan bird, but he dwells far from the madding crowd,  and is not likely to be seen at any hill station except as a captive.      THE CERTHIIDAE OR WREN FAMILY    The only member of this family common about our hill stations is the  Himalayan tree-creeper (_Certhia himalayana_). This is a small brown  bird, striped and barred with black, which spends the day creeping  over the trunks of trees seeking its insect quarry. It is an  unobtrusive creature, and, as its plumage assimilates very closely  to the bark over which it crawls, it would escape observation more  often than it does, but for its call, which is a shrill one.      THE SYLVIIDAE OR WARBLER FAMILY    The sylviidae comprise a large number of birds of small size and,  with a few exceptions, of plain plumage. The result is that the great  majority of them resemble one another so closely that it is as  difficult to identify them when at large as it is to see through a  brick wall. Small wonder, then, that field naturalists fight rather  shy of this family. Of the 110 species of warbler which exist in India,  I propose to deal with only one, and that favoured bird is Hodgson's  grey-headed flycatcher-warbler (_Cryptolopha xanthoschista_). My  reasons for raising this particular species from among the vulgar  herd of warblers are two. The first is that it is the commonest bird  in our hill stations. The second is that it is distinctively coloured,  and in consequence easy to identify.    It is impossible for a human being to visit any hill station between  Murree and Naini Tal in spring without remarking this warbler. I do  not exaggerate when I say that its voice issues from every second  tree.    This species may be said to be _the_ warbler of the Western Himalayas,  and, as such, it has been made the subject of a separate essay.      THE LANIIDAE OR SHRIKE FAMILY    The butcher-birds are the best-known members of this fraternity.  Undoubtedly passerine in structure, shrikes are as indubitably  raptores by nature. They are nothing less than pocket hawks.    Their habit is to sit on an exposed perch and pounce from thence on  to some insect on the ground. The larger species attack small birds.    Four species of butcher-bird may perhaps be classed among the common  birds of the Himalayas; but they are inhabitants of the lower ranges  only. It is unusual to see a shrike at as high an elevation as 6000  feet. In consequence they are seldom observed at hill stations.    It is true that the grey-backed shrike does occur as high as 9000  feet, but this species, being confined mainly to the inner ranges,  does not occur at most hill stations.    The bay-backed shrike (_Lanius vittatus_) is a bird rather smaller  than a bulbul. Its head is grey except for a broad black band running  through the eye. The wings and tail are black and white. The back  is chestnut red and the rump white.    The rufous-backed shrike (_L. erythronotus_) is very like the last  species, but it is a larger bird. It has no white in the wings and  tail, and its rump is red instead of being white.    The grey-backed shrike (_L. tephronotus_) is very like the  rufous-backed species, but may be distinguished by the fact that the  grey of the head extends more than half-way down the back.    As its name indicates, the black-headed shrike (_L. nigriceps_) has  the whole head black; but the cheeks, chin, and throat are white.    Butcher-birds are of striking rather than beautiful appearance. They  have some very handsome relatives which are known as minivets. Every  person must have seen a company of small birds with somewhat long  tails, clothed in bright scarlet and black--birds which flit about  among the trees like sparks driven before the wind. These are cock  minivets. The hens, which are often found in company with them, are  in their way equally beautiful and conspicuous, for they are bright  yellow in those parts of the plumage where the cocks are scarlet.  It is impossible to mistake a minivet, but it is quite another matter  to say to which species any particular minivet belongs. The species  commonly seen about our hill stations are _Pericrocotus speciosus_,  the Indian scarlet minivet, and _P. brevirostris_, the short-billed  minivet. The former is 9 inches long, while the latter is but 7-1/2.  Again, the red of the former is scarlet and that of the latter crimson  rather than scarlet. These distinctions are sufficiently apparent  when two species are seen side by side, but are scarcely sufficient  to enable the ordinary observer to determine the species of a flock  seen flitting about amid the foliage. This, however, need not disturb  us. Most people are quite satisfied to know that these exquisite  little birds are all called minivets.      THE ORIOLIDAE OR ORIOLE FAMILY    The beautiful orioles are birds of the plains rather than of the hills.  One species, however, the Indian Oriole (_Oriolus kundoo_) is a summer  visitor to the Himalayas. The cock is a bright yellow bird with a  pink bill. There is some black on his cheeks and wing feathers. The  hen is less brilliantly coloured, the yellow of her plumage being  dull and mixed with green. Orioles are a little larger than bulbuls.  They rarely, if ever, descend to the ground. I do not remember having  seen the birds at Murree, Mussoorie, or Naini Tal, but they are common  at Almora in summer.      THE STURNIDAE OR STARLING FAMILY    The Himalayan starling (_Sturnus humii_) is so like his European  brother in appearance that it is scarcely possible to distinguish  between the two species unless they are seen side by side. Is it  necessary to describe the starling? Does an Englishman exist who is  not well acquainted with the vivacious bird which makes itself at  home in his garden or on his housetop in England? We have all admired  its dark plumage, which displays a green or bronze sheen in the  sunlight, and which is so curiously spotted with buff.    The Himalayan species is, I think, common only in the more westerly  parts of the hills.    The common myna (_Acridotheres tristis_) is nearly as abundant in  the hills as it is in the plains. I should not have deemed it necessary  to describe this bird, had not a lady asked me a few days ago whether  a pair of mynas, which were fighting as only mynas can fight, were  seven sisters.    The myna is a bird considerably smaller than a crow. His head, neck,  and upper breast are black, while the rest of his plumage is quaker  brown, save for a broad white wing-bar, very conspicuous during flight,  and some white in the tail. The legs and bill look as though they  had been dipped in the mustard pot, and there is a bare patch of  mustard-coloured skin on either side of the head. This sprightly bird  is sociably inclined. Grasshoppers form its favourite food. These  it seeks on the grass, over which it struts with as much dignity as  a stout raja. In the spring the mynas make free with our bungalows,  seizing on any convenient holes or ledges as sites for their nests.  The nest is a conglomeration of straw, rags, paper, and any rubbish  that comes to beak. The eggs are a beautiful blue.    The only other myna commonly seen in Himalayan hill stations is the  jungle myna (_AEthiopsar fuscus_). This is so like the species just  described, that nine out of ten people fail to differentiate between  the two birds. Close inspection shows that this species has a little  tuft of feathers on the forehead, which the common myna"]]]
