To Phaeton the Italian Naiades reared a tomb, and inscribed on the  stone these words:        \"Driver of Phoebus' chariot, Phaeton,      Struck by Jove's thunder, rests beneath this stone,      He could not rule his father's car of fire,      Yet was it much, so nobly to aspire.\"            Ovid.          ENDYMION      To the modern popular mind perhaps none of the goddesses of  Greece--not even Venus herself--has more appeal than has the huntress  goddess, Diana. Those who know but little of ancient statuary can  still brighten to intelligent recognition of the huntress with her  quiver and her little stag when they meet with them in picture gallery  or in suburban garden. That unlettered sportsman in weather-worn pink,  slowly riding over the fragrant dead leaves by the muddy roadside on  this chill, grey morning, may never have heard of Artemis, but he is  quite ready to make intelligent reference to Diana to the handsome  young sportswoman whom he finds by the covert side; and Sir Walter's  Diana Vernon has helped the little-read public to realise that the  original Diana was a goddess worthy of being sponsor to one of the  finest heroines of fiction.    But not to the sportsman alone, but also to the youth or maid who  loves the moon--they know not why--to those whom the shadows of the  trees on a woodland path at night mean a grip of the heart, while  \"pale Dian\" scuds over the dark clouds that are soaring far beyond the  tree-tops and is peeping, chaste and pale, through the branches of the  firs and giant pines, there is something arresting, enthralling, in  the thought of the goddess Diana who now has for hunting-ground the  blue firmament of heaven where the pale Pleiades        \"Glitter like a swarm of fire-flies tangled in a silver braid.\"            Tennyson.        \"She gleans her silvan trophies; down the wold      She hears the sobbing of the stags that flee      Mixed with the music of the hunting roll'd,      But her delight is all in archery,      And naught of ruth and pity wotteth she      More than her hounds that follow on the flight;      The goddess draws a golden bow of might      And thick she rains the gentle shafts that slay.      She tosses loose her locks upon the night,      And through the dim wood Dian threads her way.\"            Andrew Lang.    Again and again in mythological history we come on stories of the  goddess, sometimes under her best known name of Diana, sometimes under  her older Greek name of Artemis, and now and again as Selene, the  moon-goddess, the Luna of the Romans. Her twin brother was Apollo, god  of the sun, and with him she shared the power of unerringly wielding a  bow and of sending grave plagues and pestilences, while both were  patrons of music and of poetry.    When the sun-god's golden chariot had driven down into the west, then  would his sister's noiseless-footed silver steeds be driven across the  sky, while the huntress shot from her bow at will silent arrows that  would slay without warning a joyous young mother with her newly-born  babe, or would wantonly pierce, with a lifelong pain, the heart of  some luckless mortal.    Now one night as she passed Mount Latmos, there chanced to be a  shepherd lad lying asleep beside his sleeping flock. Many times had  Endymion watched the goddess from afar, half afraid of one so  beautiful and yet so ruthless, but never before had Diana realised the  youth's wonderful beauty. She checked her hounds when they would have  swept on in their chase through the night, and stood beside Endymion.  She judged him to be as perfect as her own brother, Apollo--yet more  perfect, perhaps, for on his upturned sleeping face was the silver  glamour of her own dear moon. Fierce and burning passion could come  with the sun's burning rays, but love that came in the moon's pale  light was passion mixed with gramarye. She gazed for long, and when,  in his sleep, Endymion smiled, she knelt beside him and, stooping,  gently kissed his lips. The touch of a moonbeam on a sleeping rose was  no more gentle than was Diana's touch, yet it was sufficient to wake  Endymion. And as, while one's body sleeps on, one's half-waking mind,  now and again in a lifetime seems to realise an ecstasy of happiness  so perfect that one dares not wake lest, by waking, the wings of one's  realised ideal should slip between grasping fingers and so escape  forever, so did Endymion realise the kiss of the goddess. But before  his sleepy eyes could be his senses' witnesses, Diana had hastened  away. Endymion, springing to his feet, saw only his sleeping flock,  nor did his dogs awake when he heard what seemed to him to be the  baying of hounds in full cry in a forest far up the mountain. Only to  his own heart did he dare to whisper what was this wonderful thing  that he believed had befallen him, and although he laid himself  down, hoping that once again this miracle might be granted to him, no  miracle came; nor could he sleep, so great was his longing.    [Illustration: SHE CHECKED HER HOUNDS, AND STOOD BESIDE ENDYMION]    All the next day, through the sultry hours while Apollo drove his  chariot of burnished gold through the land, Endymion, as he watched  his flocks, tried to dream his dream once more, and longed for the day  to end and the cool, dark night to return. When night came he tried to  lie awake and see what might befall, but when kind sleep had closed  his tired eyes,        \"There came a lovely vision of a maid,      Who seemed to step as from a golden car      Out of the low-hung moon.\"            Lewis Morris.    Always she kissed him, yet when her kiss awoke him he never could see  anything more tangible than a shaft of silver moonlight on the moving  bushes of the mountain side, never hear anything more real than the  far-away echo of the baying of pursuing hounds, and if, with eager,  greatly-daring eyes, he looked skywards, a dark cloud, so it seemed to  him, would always hasten to hide the moon from his longing gaze.    In this manner time passed on. The days of Endymion were filled by  longing day-dreams. His sleeping hours ever brought him ecstasy. Ever,  too, to the goddess, the human being that she loved seemed to her to  grow more precious. For her all the joy of day and of night was  concentrated in the moments she spent by the side of the sleeping  Endymion. The flocks of the shepherd flourished like those of no other  herd. No wild beast dared come near them; no storm nor disease  assailed them. Yet for Endymion the things of earth no longer held any  value. He lived only for his dear dream's sake. Had he been permitted  to grow old and worn and tired, and still a dreamer, who knows how his  story might have ended? But to Diana there came the fear that with age  his beauty might wane, and from her father, Zeus, she obtained for the  one she loved the gifts of unending youth and of eternal sleep.    There came a night when the dreams of Endymion had no end. That was a  night when the moon made for herself broad silver paths across the  sea, from far horizon to the shore where the little waves lapped and  curled in a radiant, ever-moving silver fringe. Silver also were the  leaves of the forest trees, and between the branches of the solemn  cypresses and of the stately dark pines, Diana shot her silver arrows.  No baying of hounds came then to make Endymion's flocks move uneasily  in their sleep, but the silver stars seemed to sing in unison  together. While still those gentle lips touched his, hands as gentle  lifted up the sleeping Endymion and bore him to a secret cave in Mount  Latmos. And there, for evermore, she came to kiss the mouth of her  sleeping lover. There, forever, slept Endymion, happy in the perfect  bliss of dreams that have no ugly awaking, of an ideal love that knows  no ending.          ORPHEUS        \"Orpheus with his lute made trees,      And the mountain tops that freeze,      Bow themselves when he did sing;      To his music plants and flowers      Ever sprung, as sun and showers      There had made a lasting spring.      Everything that heard him play,      Even the billows of the sea,      Hung their heads, and then lay by,      In sweet music is such art,      Killing care and grief of heart      Fall asleep, or hearing die.\"            Shakespeare.        \"Are we not all lovers as Orpheus was, loving what is      gone from us forever, and seeking it vainly in the      solitudes and wilderness of the mind, and crying to      Eurydice to come again? And are we not all foolish as      Orpheus was, hoping by the agony of love and the ecstasy      of will to win back Eurydice; and do we not all fail, as      Orpheus failed, because we forsake the way of the other      world for the way of this world?\"            Fiona Macleod.      It is the custom nowadays for scientists and for other scholarly  people to take hold of the old myths, to take them to pieces, and to  find some deep, hidden meaning in each part of the story. So you will  find that some will tell you that Orpheus is the personification of  the winds which \"tear up trees as they course along, chanting their  wild music,\" and that Eurydice is the morning \"with its short-lived  beauty.\" Others say that Orpheus is \"the mythological expression of  the delight which music gives to the primitive races,\" while yet  others accept without hesitation the idea that Orpheus is the sun  that, when day is done, plunges into the black abyss of night, in the  vain hope of overtaking his lost bride, Eurydice, the rosy dawn. And,  whether they be right or wrong, it would seem that the sadness that  comes to us sometimes as the day dies and the last of the sun's rays  vanish to leave the hills and valleys dark and cold, the sorrowful  feeling that we cannot understand when, in country places, we"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22694"],[0,"The International Magazine, Volume 2, No. 2, January, 1851 (#6)"],[1,",\" with which he has had nothing to do,  and which have none of his wise and genial spirit.    Besides his writings under this pseudonym, Mr. Goodrich has produced  several works of a more ambitious character, which have been eminently  popular. Among them is a series entitled \"The Cabinet Library,\"  embracing histories, biographies, and essays in science; \"Universal  Geography,\" in an octavo volume of one thousand pages; and a \"History of  all Nations,\" in two large octavos, in which he has displayed such  research, analysis, and generalization, as should insure for him an  honorable rank among historians. We cannot better illustrate his  popularity than by stating the fact, that more than four hundred  thousand volumes of his various productions are now annually sold in  this country and Europe. No living writer is, therefore, as much read,  and in the United States hardly a citizen now makes his first appearance  at the polls, or a bride at the altar, to whose education he has not in  a large degree contributed. For twenty years he has preserved the  confidence of parents and teachers of every variety of condition and  opinion, by the indefectible morality and strong practical sense, which  are universally understood and approved.    Like many other eminent persons, Mr. Goodrich lets sought occasional  relaxation from the main pursuits of his life in poetry, and the volume  before us contains some forty illustrations of his abilities, as a  worshipper of the muse whose temples are most thronged, but who is most  coy and most chary of her inspiration. They have for the most part been  previously printed in \"The Token,\" or in literary journals, but a few  are now published the first time. In typographical and pictorial  elegance the book is unique. It is an exhibition of the success of the  first attempt to rival the London and Paris publishers in woodcut  embellishment and general beauty of execution.    That Mr. Goodrich possesses the poetical faculty in an eminent degree,  no one has doubted who has read his fine lines \"To Lake Superior:\"    [Illustration]        Father of Lakes! thy waters bend,        Beyond the eagle's utmost view,      When, throned in heaven, he sees thee send        Back to the sky its world of blue.        Boundless and deep the forests weave        Their twilight shade thy borders o'er,      And threatening cliffs, like giants, heave        Their rugged forms along thy shore.        Nor can the light canoes, that glide        Across thy breast like things of air,      Chase from thy lone and level tide,        The spell of stillness deepening there.        Yet round this waste of wood and wave,        Unheard, unseen, a spirit lives,      That, breathing o'er each rock and cave,        To all, a wild, strange aspect gives.        The thunder-riven oak, that flings        Its grisly arms athwart the sky,      A sudden, startling image brings        To the lone traveller's kindled eye.        The gnarled and braided boughs that show        Their dim forms in the forest shade,      Like wrestling serpents seem, and throw        Fantastic horrors through the glade.        The very echoes round this shore,        Have caught a strange and gibbering tone,      For they have told the war-whoop o'er,        Till the wild chorus is their own.        Wave of the wilderness, adieu--        Adieu, ye rocks, ye wilds, ye woods!      Roll on, thou Element of blue,        And fill these awful solitudes!        Thou hast no tale to tell of man.        God is thy theme. Ye sounding caves,      Whisper of Him, whose mighty plan,        Deems as a bubble all your waves!    The \"Birth Night of the Humming Birds\" has been declared by the London  _Athenaeum_ equal to Dr. Drake's \"Culprit Fay,\" and it may be regarded as  in its way the best specimen of Mr. Goodrich's talents. It is too long  to be quoted in these paragraphs. In descriptions of nature he is  uniformly successful, presenting his picture with force and  distractness.    There are many examples of this in one of his longest poems, \"The  Mississippi,\" in which the traditions that cluster around the Father of  Waters, and the advances of civility along his borders, are graphically  presented. The river is described as rising.    [Illustration]        \"Far in the west, where snow-capt mountain's rise,        Like marble shafts beneath heaven's stooping dome,      And sunset's charming curtain drapes the skies        As if Enchantment there would build her home.    The bard laments that                \"though these scenes are fair      As fabled Arcady, the sylph and fay,        And all their gentle kindred, shun the air,      Where car and steamer make their stormy way;\"    Yet trusts that in a future time,        \"Perchance some Cooper's magic art may wake        The sleeping legends of this mighty vale,      And twine fond memories round the lawn and lake,        Where Warrior fought or Lover told his tale.    In the volume are several allegorical pieces of much merit, of which the  most noticeable are the \"Two Windmills,\" \"The Bubble Chase,\" and \"The  Rainbow Bridge.\" Several smaller poems are distinguished for a quaint  simplicity, reminding us of the old masters of English verse; and  others, for refined sentiment, as the \"Old Oak,\" of which the key-note  is in the lines,        Here is the grassy knoll I used to seek        At summer noon, beneath the spreading shade,      And watch the flowers that stooped, with glowing cheek,        To meet the romping ripples as they played.    [Illustration]    The longest of Mr. Goodrich's poems is \"The Outcast.\" It was first  published many years ago, and it appears now with the improvements  suggested by reflection and criticism. Its fault is, a certain  _intensity_, but it has noble passages, betraying a careful study and  profound appreciation of the subtler operations of the mind,  particularly, when, in its most excited action, it is influenced by the  observation of nature.    The volume will take its place in the cabinets of our choice literature,  and will be prized the more for the fact that by selecting American  themes for his most elaborate compositions, Mr. Goodrich has made  literature subservient to the purposes of patriotism.    FOOTNOTES:    [8] _Poems: by S. G. Goodrich._ New York, G. P. Putnam. [The  designs--about forty--are by Mr. Billings, the engravings by Bobbett &  Edmonds, Lossing & Barrett, Hartwell, and others, and the printing by  Mr. John F. Trow.]          [Illustration]    RICHARD B. KIMBALL.      The author of \"_St. Leger_\" was by that admirable work placed in the  leading rank of the new generation of American writers. The appearance  in the _Knickerbocker_ for the present month, of the commencement of a  sequel to \"St. Leger,\" makes it a fit occasion for some notice of his  life and genius.    Mr. Kimball is by inheritance of the first class of New-England men,  numbering in his family a signer of the Declaration of Independence, a  President of the Continental Congress, and several other persons  honorably distinguished in affairs. He is a native of Lebanon, in New  Hampshire, where his father is still living--the centre of a circle  bound to him by their respect for every public and private virtue.  Though he had completed his preparatory studies before he was eleven  years of age, he did not enter college until he was nearly thirteen.  Four years after, in 1834, he graduated at Dartmouth, and upon devoting  one year to the study of the law, he went abroad; travelled in England,  Scotland, and Germany; and resided some time in Paris, where he attended  the lectures of Majendie, Broussais, and Louis, in medicine, and those  of the elder Dupin, and Coulanges, in law. Returning, he entered upon  the practice of the law, at Waterford, in this state, but soon removed  to New-York, where a year's devotion to his profession made him familiar  with its routine. In 1842 he went a second time to Europe, renewing the  associations of his travel and student-life in Great Britain and on the  continent. Since, for seven years, he has been an industrious and  successful lawyer in New-York.    Although but few works are known to be from the pen of Mr. Kimball, he  has been a voluminous author. The vigorous and polished style of his  avowed compositions, is never attained but by long practice. He has  been, we believe, a contributor to every volume of the _Knickerbocker_  published since 1842. He printed in that excellent magazine his  \"Reminiscences of an Old Man,\" \"The Young Englishman,\" and the  successive chapters of \"St. Leger, or the Threads of Life.\" This last  work was published by Putnam, and by Bentley in London, about one year  ago, and it passed rapidly through two English and three American  editions. It was not raised into an ephemeral popularity, as so many  works of fiction easily are, for their lightness, by careless applauses;  it arrested the attention of the wisest critics; commanded their study,  and received their verdict of approval as a book of learning and  reflection in the anatomy of human life.    Mr. Kimball had been eminent in his class at college for a love of Greek  literature, and he studied the Roman also with reverent attention. It  was his distinction that he had thoroughly acquainted himself with the  philosophy of the ancients. At a later day he was attracted by the  speculation of the Germans, and a mastery of their language enabled him  to enter fully into the spirit of Spinosa, Kant, and Fichte, as he did  into that of the finer intelligences, Goeethe and Richter, and pervading  he found the passion to know Whence are we? What are we? Whither do we  go? In \"St. Leger,\" a mind predisposed to superstition by some vague  prophecies respecting the destiny of his family--a mind inquisitive,  quick, and earnest, but subject to occasional melancholy, as the  inherited spell obtains a mastery of the reason--is exposed to the  influences of a"]]]
