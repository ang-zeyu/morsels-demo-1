[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22169"],[0,"The Story of the Barbary Corsairs (#6)"],[1," all that a Corsair could wish. The Goletta  in those days was but slightly fortified, and the principal building,  besides the castle, was the custom-house, where the wealth of many  nations was taxed by the Sultan of the House of Hafs. The very sight  of such an institution was stimulating to a pirate. Ur[=u]j paid his  court to the King of Tunis, and speedily came to an understanding  with him on the subject of royalties on stolen goods. The ports of  Tunis were made free to the Corsair, and the king would protect him  from pursuit, for the consideration of a fixed share--a fifth--of the  booty. The policy of the enlightened rulers of Tunis evidently no  longer suited their latest representative.    The base of operations thus secured, Ur[=u]j did not keep his new ally  long waiting for a proof of his prowess. One day he lay off the island  of Elba, when two galleys-royal, belonging to his Holiness Pope Julius  II., richly laden with goods from Genoa, and bound for Civita Vecchia,  hove in sight. They were rowing in an easy, leisurely manner, little  dreaming of Turkish Corsairs, for none such had ever been seen in  those waters, nor anything bigger than a Moorish brigantine, of which  the Papal marines were prepared to give a good account. So the two  galleys paddled on, some ten leagues asunder, and Ur[=u]j Reis marked  his prey down. It was no light adventure for a galleot of eighteen  banks of oars to board a royal galley of perhaps twice her size, and  with no one could tell how many armed men inside her. The Turkish crew  remonstrated at such foolhardiness, and begged their captain to look  for a foe of their own size: but for reply Ur[=u]j only cast most of  the oars overboard, and thus made escape impossible. Then he lay to  and awaited the foremost galley She came on, proudly, unconscious of  danger. Suddenly her look-out spied Turkish turbans--a strange sight  on the Italian coast--and in a panic of confusion her company beat to  arms. The vessels were now alongside, and a smart volley of shot and  bolts completed the consternation of the Christians. Ur[=u]j and his  men were quickly on the poop, and his Holiness's servants were soon  safe under hatches.    Never before had a galley-royal struck her colours to a mere galleot.  But worse was to follow. Ur[=u]j declared he must and would have her  consort. In vain his officers showed him how temerarious was the  venture, and how much more prudent it would be to make off with one  rich prize than to court capture by overgreediness. The Corsair's will  was of iron, and his crew, inflated with triumph, caught his audacious  spirit. They clothed themselves in the dresses of the Christian  prisoners, and manned the subdued galley as though they were her own  seamen. On came the consort, utterly ignorant of what had happened,  till a shower of arrows and small shot aroused her, just in time to be  carried by assault, before her men had collected their senses.    Ur[=u]j brought his prizes into the Goletta. Never was such a sight  seen there before. \"The wonder and astonishment,\" says Haedo,[6] \"that  this noble exploit caused in Tunis, and even in Christendom, is not to  be expressed, nor how celebrated the name of Ur[=u]j Reis was become  from that very moment; he being held and accounted by all the world as  a most valiant and enterprizing commander. And by reason his beard was  extremely red, or carroty, from thenceforwards he was generally called  Barba-rossa, which in Italian signifies Red-Beard.\"[7]    [Illustration: GALLEY OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.    (_Jurien de la Graviere._)]    The capture of the Papal galleys gave Ur[=u]j what he wanted--rowers.  He kept his Turks for fighting, and made the Christian prisoners work  the oars; such was the custom of every Corsair down to the present  century, and the Christian navies were similarly propelled by  Mohammedan slaves. The practice must have lent a strange excitement to  the battle; for then, assuredly, a man's foes were of his own  household. A Venetian admiral knew well that his two or three hundred  galley slaves were panting to break their irons and join the enemy;  and the Turkish Corsair had also his unwilling subjects, who would  take the first chance to mutiny in favour of the Christian adversary.  Thus it often happened that a victory was secured by the strong arms  of the enemy's chained partizans, who would have given half their  lives to promote a defeat. But the sharp lash of the boatswain, who  walked the bridge between the banks of rowers, was a present and acute  argument which few backs could withstand.    Ur[=u]j had made his first _coup_, and he did not hesitate to follow  it up. Next year he captured a Spanish ship with five hundred soldiers  on board, who were all so sea-sick, or spent with pumping out the  leaky vessel, that they fell an easy prey to his galleots. Before five  years were out, what with cruising, and building with the timber of  his many prizes, he had eight good vessels at his back, with two of  his brothers to help. The port of Tunis now hardly sufficed his wants,  so he established himself temporarily on the fertile island of Jerba,  and from its ample anchorage his ships issued forth to harry the  coasts of Italy.    To be king of Jerba was all too small a title for his ambition. He  aimed at sovereignty on a large scale, and, Corsair as he was by  nature, he wished for settled power almost as much as he delighted in  adventure. In 1512 the opportunity he sought arrived. Three years  before, the Mohammedan King of Buj[=e]ya had been driven out of his  city by the Spaniards, and the exiled potentate appealed to the  Corsair to come and restore him, coupling the petition with promises  of the free use of Buj[=e]ya port, whence the command of the Spanish  sea was easily to be held. Ur[=u]j was pleased with the prospect, and  as he had now twelve galleots with cannon, and one thousand Turkish  men-at-arms, to say nothing of renegades and Moors, he felt strong  enough for the attempt. The renown of his exploits had spread far and  wide, and there was no lack of a following from all parts of the  Levant when it was known that Ur[=u]j Reis was on the war-path. His  extraordinary energy and impetuosity called forth a corresponding zeal  in his men, and, like other dashing commanders, he was very popular.    [Illustration: J[=I]JIL, 1664.    (_From a Map in the British Museum._)]    Well supported, and provided with such a siege-train as the times  permitted, he landed before Buj[=e]ya in August, 1512, and found the  dethroned king expecting him at the head of three thousand mountain  Berbers. The Spanish garrison was collected in the strong bastion,  which the Count Don Pedro Navarro had fortified when he took the city,  and for eight days the fortress withstood the battering of the  Corsair's ordnance. Just when a breach began to be opened, Ur[=u]j was  disabled; a shot took his left arm away above the elbow. In the  absence of their leader's heroic example, the Turks felt little  confidence in their superiority to Spanish steel; they preferred  carrying their wounded captain to the surgeons at Tunis. Buj[=e]ya for  the moment escaped, but the Corsairs enjoyed some little consolation  in the capture of a rich Genoese galleot which they met on its voyage  to the Lomellini's mart at Tabarka. With this spoil Ur[=u]j returned  to recover from his wound, while his brother, Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n, kept  guard over the castle of the Goletta, and began to bring the galleots  and prizes through the canal into the Lake of Tunis, where they would  be safe from pursuit.    He was too late, however. The Senate of Genoa was highly incensed at  the loss of the galleot, and Andrea Doria, soon to be known as the  greatest Christian admiral of his time, was despatched with twelve  galleys to exact reparation. He landed before the Goletta, and drove  Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n before him into Tunis. The fortress was sacked, and  half Barbarossa's ships were brought in triumph to Genoa. Thus ended  the first meeting between Doria and Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n: the next was less  happy for the noble Genoese.    Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n, well aware of his brother's fierce humour, did not  dare to face him after this humiliation, but left him to fume  impotently in his sickroom, while he stole away to Jerba, there to  work night and day at shipbuilding. Ur[=u]j joined him in the  following spring--the King of Tunis had probably had enough of  him--and they soon had the means of wiping out their disgrace. The  attempt was at first a failure; a second assault on the ominous forts  of Buj[=e]ya (1514) was on the point of success, when reinforcements  arrived from Spain. The Berber allies evinced more interest in getting  in their crops after the rain than in forcing the bastion; and  Barbarossa, compelled to raise the siege, in a frantic rage, tearing  his red beard like a madman, set fire to his ships that they might not  fall into the hands of the Spaniards.    He would not show himself now in Tunis or Jerba. Some new spot must  shelter him after this fresh reverse. On his way to and from Buj[=e]ya  he had noticed the very place for his purpose--a spot easy to defend,  perched on inaccessible rocks, yet furnished with a good harbour,  where the losses of recent years might be repaired. This was J[=i]jil,  some sixty miles to the east of Buj[=e]ya; whose sturdy inhabitants  owed allegiance to no Sultan, but were proud to welcome so renowned,  although now so unfortunate, a warrior as Barbarossa. So at J[=i]jil  Ur[=u]j dwelt, and cultivated the good-will of the people with spoils  of corn and goods from his cruisers, till those \"indomitable African  mountaineers,\" who had never owned a superior, chose him by  acclamation their king.    FOOTNOTES:    [5] The differences between the Turkish authority, H[=a]jji Khal[=i]fa,  who wrote in the middle of the seventeenth century and used \"Memoirs\"  partly inspired by Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22217"],[0,"My Reminiscences (#6)"],[1,"coming out of the  estate offices on the ground floor, after a conquering expedition  against the officers, we came across the editor of \"The National Paper,\"  Nabagopal Mitter, who had just stepped into the house. My brother  tackled him without further ado: \"Look here, Nabagopal Babu! won't you  listen to a poem which Rabi has written?\" The reading forthwith  followed.    My works had not as yet become voluminous. The poet could carry all his  effusions about in his pockets. I was writer, printer and publisher, all  in one; my brother, as advertiser, being my only colleague. I had  composed some verses on The Lotus which I recited to Nabagopal Babu then  and there, at the foot of the stairs, in a voice pitched as high as my  enthusiasm. \"Well done!\" said he with a smile. \"But what is a  _dwirepha_?\"[11]    How I had got hold of this word I do not remember. The ordinary name  would have fitted the metre quite as well. But this was the one word in  the whole poem on which I had pinned my hopes. It had doubtless duly  impressed our officers. But curiously enough Nabagopal Babu did not  succumb to it--on the contrary he smiled! He could not be an  understanding man, I felt sure. I never read poetry to him again. I have  since added many years to my age but have not been able to improve upon  my test of what does or does not constitute understanding in my hearer.  However Nabagopal Babu might smile, the word _dwirepha_, like a bee  drunk with honey, stuck to its place, unmoved.          (7) _Various Learning_      One of the teachers of the Normal School also gave us private lessons at  home. His body was lean, his features dry, his voice sharp. He looked  like a cane incarnate. His hours were from six to half-past-nine in the  morning. With him our reading ranged from popular literary and science  readers in Bengali to the epic of Meghnadvadha.    My third brother was very keen on imparting to us a variety of  knowledge. So at home we had to go through much more than what was  required by the school course. We had to get up before dawn and, clad in  loin-cloths, begin with a bout or two with a blind wrestler. Without a  pause we donned our tunics on our dusty bodies, and started on our  courses of literature, mathematics, geography and history. On our return  from school our drawing and gymnastic masters would be ready for us. In  the evening Aghore Babu came for our English lessons. It was only after  nine that we were free.    On Sunday morning we had singing lessons with Vishnu. Then, almost every  Sunday, came Sitanath Dutta to give us demonstrations in physical  science. The last were of great interest to me. I remember distinctly  the feeling of wonder which filled me when he put some water, with  sawdust in it, on the fire in a glass vessel, and showed us how the  lightened hot water came up, and the cold water went down and how  finally the water began to boil. I also felt a great elation the day I  learnt that water is a separable part of milk, and that milk thickens  when boiled because the water frees itself as vapour from the connexion.  Sunday did not feel Sunday-like unless Sitanath Babu turned up.    There was also an hour when we would be told all about human bones by a  pupil of the Campbell Medical School, for which purpose a skeleton, with  the bones fastened together by wires was hung up in our schoolroom. And  finally, time was also found for Pandit Heramba Tatwaratna to come and  get us to learn by rote rules of Sanscrit grammar. I am not sure which  of them, the names of the bones or the _sutras_ of the grammarian, were  the more jaw-breaking. I think the latter took the palm.    We began to learn English after we had made considerable progress in  learning through the medium of Bengali. Aghore Babu, our English tutor,  was attending the Medical College, so he came to teach us in the  evening.    Books tell us that the discovery of fire was one of the biggest  discoveries of man. I do not wish to dispute this. But I cannot help  feeling how fortunate the little birds are that their parents cannot  light lamps of an evening. They have their language lessons early in the  morning and you must have noticed how gleefully they learn them. Of  course we must not forget that they do not have to learn the English  language!    The health of this medical-student tutor of ours was so good that even  the fervent and united wishes of his three pupils were not enough to  cause his absence even for a day. Only once was he laid up with a broken  head when, on the occasion of a fight between the Indian and Eurasian  students of the Medical College, a chair was thrown at him. It was a  regrettable occurrence; nevertheless we were not able to take it as a  personal sorrow, and his recovery somehow seemed to us needlessly swift.    It is evening. The rain is pouring in lance-like showers. Our lane is  under knee-deep water. The tank has overflown into the garden, and the  bushy tops of the Bael trees are seen standing out over the waters. Our  whole being, on this delightful rainy evening, is radiating rapture like  the _Kadamba_ flower its fragrant spikes. The time for the arrival of  our tutor is over by just a few minutes. Yet there is no certainty...!  We are sitting on the verandah overlooking the lane[12] watching and  watching with a piteous gaze. All of a sudden, with a great big thump,  our hearts seem to fall in a swoon. The familiar black umbrella has  turned the corner undefeated even by such weather! Could it not be  somebody else? It certainly could not! In the wide wide world there  might be found another, his equal in pertinacity, but never in this  little lane of ours.    Looking back on his period as a whole, I cannot say that Aghore Babu was  a hard man. He did not rule us with a rod. Even his rebukes did not  amount to scoldings. But whatever may have been his personal merits, his  time was _evening_, and his subject _English_! I am certain that even an  angel would have seemed a veritable messenger of Yama[13] to any Bengali  boy if he came to him at the end of his miserable day at school, and  lighted a dismally dim lamp to teach him English.    How well do I remember the day our tutor tried to impress on us the  attractiveness of the English language. With this object he recited to  us with great unction some lines--prose or poetry we could not tell--out  of an English book. It had a most unlooked for effect on us. We laughed  so immoderately that he had to dismiss us for that evening. He must  have realised that he held no easy brief--that to get us to pronounce in  his favour would entail a contest ranging over years.    Aghore Babu would sometimes try to bring the zephyr of outside knowledge  to play on the arid routine of our schoolroom. One day he brought a  paper parcel out of his pocket and said: \"I'll show you to-day a  wonderful piece of work of the Creator.\" With this he untied the paper  wrapping and, producing a portion of the vocal organs of a human being,  proceeded to expound the marvels of its mechanism.    I can still call to mind the shock this gave me at the time. I had  always thought the whole man spoke--had never even imagined that the act  of speech could be viewed in this detached way. However wonderful the  mechanism of a part may be, it is certainly less so than the whole man.  Not that I put it to myself in so many words, but that was the cause of  my dismay. It was perhaps because the tutor had lost sight of this truth  that the pupil could not respond to the enthusiasm with which he was  discoursing on the subject.    Another day he took us to the dissecting room of the Medical College.  The body of an old woman was stretched on the table. This did not  disturb me so much. But an amputated leg which was lying on the floor  upset me altogether. To view man in this fragmentary way seemed to me so  horrid, so absurd that I could not get rid of the impression of that  dark, unmeaning leg for many a day.    After getting through Peary Sarkar's first and second English readers we  entered upon McCulloch's Course of Reading. Our bodies were weary at the  end of the day, our minds yearning for the inner apartments, the book  was black and thick with difficult words, and the subject-matter could  hardly have been more inviting, for in those days, Mother  Saraswati's[14] maternal tenderness was not in evidence. Children's  books were not full of pictures then as they are now. Moreover, at the  gateway of every reading lesson stood sentinel an array of words, with  separated syllables, and forbidding accent marks like fixed bayonets,  barring the way to the infant mind. I had repeatedly attacked their  serried ranks in vain.    Our tutor would try to shame us by recounting the exploits of some other  brilliant pupil of his. We felt duly ashamed, and also not well-disposed  towards that other pupil, but this did not help to dispel the darkness  which clung to that black volume.    Providence, out of pity for mankind, has instilled a soporific charm  into all tedious things. No sooner did our English lessons begin than  our heads began to nod. Sprinkling water into our eyes, or taking a run  round the verandahs, were palliatives which had no lasting effect. If by  any chance my eldest brother happened to be passing that way, and caught  a glimpse of our sleep-tormented condition, we would get let off for the  rest of the evening. It did not take our drowsiness another moment to  get completely cured.          (8) _My First Outing_      Once, when the dengue fever was raging in Calcutta, some portion of our  extensive family had to take shelter in Chhatu Babu's river-side villa.  We were among them.    This was my first outing. The bank of the Ganges welcomed me into its  lap like a friend of a former birth. There, in front of the servants'  quarters, was a grove of guava trees; and, sitting in the verandah under  the shade of these, gazing at the flowing current"]]]
