[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22557"],[0,"Canada (#6)"],[1," that John Cabot is said in 1497 to have heard the Indians of  northeastern America speak of Baccalaos, or Basque for cod--a name  afterwards applied for a century and longer to the islands and  countries around the Gulf.  It is certainly not improbable that the  Normans, Bretons, or Basques, whose lives from times immemorial have  been passed on the sea, should have been driven by the winds or by some  accident to the shores of Newfoundland or Labrador or even Cape Breton,  but such theories are not {22} based upon sufficiently authentic data  to bring them under the consideration of the serious historian.    It is unfortunate that the records of history should be so wanting in  definite and accurate details, when we come to the voyages of John  Cabot, a great navigator, who was probably a Genoese by birth and a  Venetian by citizenship.  Five years after the first discovery by  Columbus, John Cabot sailed to unknown seas and lands in the Northwest  in the ship _Matthew_ of Bristol, with full authority from the King of  England, Henry the Seventh, to take possession in his name of all  countries he might discover.  On his return from a successful voyage,  during which he certainly landed on the coast of British North America,  and first discovered the continent of North America, he became the hero  of the hour and received from Henry, a very economical sovereign, a  largess of ten pounds as a reward to \"hym that founde the new ile.\"  In  the following year both he and his son Sebastian, then a very young  man, who probably also accompanied his father in the voyage of 1497,  sailed again for the new lands which were believed to be somewhere on  the road to Cipango and the countries of gold and spice and silk.  We  have no exact record of this voyage, and do not even know whether John  Cabot himself returned alive; for, from the day of his sailing in 1498,  he disappears from the scene and his son Sebastian not only becomes  henceforth a prominent figure in the maritime history of the period,  but has been given by his admirers even the place which his father  alone fairly won as the leader in the two voyages on which {23} England  has based her claim of priority of discovery on the Atlantic coast of  North America.  The weight of authority so far points to a headland of  Cape Breton as the _prima tierra vista_, or the landfall which John  Cabot probably made on a June day, the four hundredth anniversary of  which arrived in 1897, though the claims of a point on the wild  Labrador coast and of Bonavista, an eastern headland of Newfoundland,  have also some earnest advocates.  It is, however, generally admitted  that the Cabots, in the second voyage, sailed past the shores of Nova  Scotia and of the United States as far south as Spanish Florida.  History here, at all events, has tangible, and in some respects  irrefutable, evidence on which to dwell, since we have before us a  celebrated map, which has come down from the first year of the  sixteenth century, and is known beyond doubt to have been drawn with  all the authority that is due to so famous a navigator as Juan de la  Cosa, the Basque pilot.  On this map we see delineated for the first  time the coast apparently of a continental region extending from the  peninsula of Florida as far as the present Gulf of St. Lawrence, which  is described in Spanish as _mar descubierta por los Ingleses_ (sea  discovered by the English), on one headland of which there is a _Cavo  de Ynglaterra_, or English Cape.  Whether this sea is the Gulf of St.  Lawrence and the headland is Cape Race, the south-eastern extremity of  Newfoundland, or the equally well-known point which the Bretons named  on the southeastern coast of Cape Breton, are among the questions which  enter into the domain of {24} speculation and imagination.  Juan de la  Cosa, however, is conclusive evidence in favour of the English claim to  the first discovery of Northern countries, whose greatness and  prosperity have already exceeded the conceptions which the Spanish  conquerors formed when they won possession of those rich Southern lands  which so long acknowledged the dominion of Spain.    But Cabot's voyages led to no immediate practical results.  The Bristol  ships brought back no rich cargoes of gold or silver or spices, to tell  England that she had won a passage to the Indies and Cathay.  The idea,  however, that a short passage would be discovered to those rich regions  was to linger for nearly two centuries in the minds of maritime  adventurers and geographers.    [Illustration: Sketch of Juan de la Cosa's map, A.D. 1500.]    If we study the names of the headlands, bays, and other natural  features of the islands and countries which inclose the Gulf of St.  Lawrence we find many memorials of the early Portuguese and French  voyagers.  In the beginning of the sixteenth century Gaspar Cortereal  made several voyages to the northeastern shores of Newfoundland and  Labrador, and brought back with him a number of natives whose sturdy  frames gave European spectators the idea that they would make good  labourers; and it was this erroneous conception, it is generally  thought, gave its present name to the rocky, forbidding region which  the Norse voyagers had probably called Helluland five hundred years  before.  Both Gaspar Cortereal and his brother Miguel disappeared from  history somewhere in the waters of Hudson's {26} Bay or Labrador; but  they were followed by other adventurous sailors who have left mementos  of their nationality on such places as Cape Raso (Race), Boa Ventura  (Bonaventure), Conception, Tangier, Porto Novo, Carbonear (Carboneiro),  all of which and other names appear on the earliest maps of the  north-eastern waters of North America.    Some enterprising sailors of Brittany first gave a name to that Cape  which lies to the northeast of the historic port of Louisbourg.  These  hardy sailors were certainly on the coast of the island as early as  1504, and Cape Breton is consequently the earliest French name on  record in America.  Some claim is made for the Basques--that primeval  people, whose origin is lost in the mists of tradition--because there  is a Cape Breton on the Biscayan coast of France, but the evidence in  support of the Bretons' claim is by far the strongest.  For very many  years the name of Bretons' land was attached on maps to a continental  region, which included the present Nova Scotia, and it was well into  the middle of the sixteenth century, after the voyages of Jacques  Cartier and Jehan Alfonce, before we find the island itself make its  appearance in its proper place and form.    It was a native of the beautiful city of Florence, in the days of  Francis the First, who gave to France some claim to territory in North  America.  Giovanni da Verrazano, a well-known corsair, in 1524,  received a commission from that brilliant and dissipated king, Francis  the First, who had become jealous of the enormous pretensions of Spain  and Portugal in the new world, and had on one occasion sent word to  {27} his great rival, Charles the Fifth, that he was not aware that  \"our first father Adam had made the Spanish and Portuguese kings his  sole heirs to the earth.\"  Verrazano's voyage is supposed on good  authority to have embraced the whole North American coast from Cape  Fear in North Carolina as far as the island of Cape Breton.  About the  same time Spain sent an expedition to the northeastern coasts of  America under the direction of Estevan Gomez, a Portuguese pilot, and  it is probable that he also coasted from Florida to Cape Breton.  Much  disappointment was felt that neither Verrazano nor Gomez had found a  passage through the straits which were then, and for a long time  afterwards, supposed to lie somewhere in the northern regions of  America and to lead to China and India.  Francis was not able to send  Verrazano on another voyage, to take formal possession of the new  lands, as he was engaged in that conflict with Charles which led to his  defeat at the battle of Pavia and his being made subsequently a  prisoner.  Spain appears to have attached no importance to the  discovery by Gomez, since it did not promise mines of gold and silver,  and happily for the cause of civilisation and progress, she continued  to confine herself to the countries of the South, though her fishermen  annually ventured, in common with those of other nations, to the banks  of Newfoundland.  However, from the time of Verrazano we find on the  old maps the names of Francisca and Nova Gallia as a recognition of the  claim of France to important discoveries in North America.  It is also  from the Florentine's voyage that we may date the {28} discovery of  that mysterious region called Norumbega, where the fancy of sailors and  adventurers eventually placed a noble city whose houses were raised on  pillars of crystal and silver, and decorated with precious stones.  These travellers' tales and sailors' yarns probably originated in the  current belief that somewhere in those new lands, just discovered,  there would be found an El Dorado.  The same brilliant illusion that  led Ralegh to the South made credulous mariners believe in a Norumbega  in the forests of Acadia.  The name clung for many years to a country  embraced within the present limits of New England, and sometimes  included Nova Scotia.  Its rich capital was believed to exist somewhere  on the beautiful Penobscot River, in the present State of Maine.  A  memorial of the same name still lingers in the little harbours of  Norumbec, or Lorambeque, or Loran, on the southeastern coast of Cape  Breton.  Enthusiastic advocates of the Norse discovery and settlement  have confidently seen in Norumbega, the Indian utterance of Norbega,  the ancient form of Norway to which Vinland was subject, and this  belief has been even emphasised on a stone pillar which stands on some  ruins unearthed close to the Charles River in Massachusetts."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22566"],[0,"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz (#6)"],[1,"in the ordinary way.  There were no stairs in their houses, because they did not need them,  but on a level surface they generally walked just as we do.    The little party of strangers now followed the Prince across a few more  of the glass bridges and along several paths until they came to a garden  enclosed by a high hedge. Jim had refused to leave the field of grass,  where he was engaged in busily eating; so the Wizard got out of the  buggy and joined Zeb and Dorothy, and the kitten followed demurely at  their heels.    Inside the hedge they came upon row after row of large and handsome  plants with broad leaves gracefully curving until their points nearly  reached the ground. In the center of each plant grew a daintily dressed  Mangaboo, for the clothing of all these creatures grew upon them and was  attached to their bodies.    The growing Mangaboos were of all sizes, from the blossom that had just  turned into a wee baby to the full-grown and almost ripe man or woman.  On some of the bushes might be seen a bud, a blossom, a baby, a  half-grown person and a ripe one; but even those ready to pluck were  motionless and silent, as if devoid of life. This sight explained to  Dorothy why she had seen no children among the Mangaboos, a thing she  had until now been unable to account for.    \"Our people do not acquire their real life until they leave their  bushes,\" said the Prince. \"You will notice they are all attached to the  plants by the soles of their feet, and when they are quite ripe they are  easily separated from the stems and at once attain the powers of motion  and speech. So while they grow they cannot be said to really live, and  they must be picked before they can become good citizens.\"    \"How long do you live, after you are picked?\" asked Dorothy.    \"That depends upon the care we take of ourselves,\" he replied. \"If we  keep cool and moist, and meet with no accidents, we often live for five  years. I've been picked over six years, but our family is known to be  especially long lived.\"    \"Do you eat?\" asked the boy.    \"Eat! No, indeed. We are quite solid inside our bodies, and have no need  to eat, any more than does a potato.\"    \"But the potatoes sometimes sprout,\" said Zeb.    \"And sometimes we do,\" answered the Prince; \"but that is considered a  great misfortune, for then we must be planted at once.\"    \"Where did you grow?\" asked the Wizard.    \"I will show you,\" was the reply. \"Step this way, please.\"    He led them within another but smaller circle of hedge, where grew one  large and beautiful bush.    \"This,\" said he, \"is the Royal Bush of the Mangaboos. All of our Princes  and Rulers have grown upon this one bush from time immemorial.\"    They stood before it in silent admiration. On the central stalk stood  poised the figure of a girl so exquisitely formed and colored and so  lovely in the expression of her delicate features that Dorothy thought  she had never seen so sweet and adorable a creature in all her life.  The maiden's gown was soft as satin and fell about her in ample folds,  while dainty lace-like traceries trimmed the bodice and sleeves. Her  flesh was fine and smooth as polished ivory, and her poise expressed  both dignity and grace.    \"Who is this?\" asked the Wizard, curiously.    The Prince had been staring hard at the girl on the bush. Now he  answered, with a touch of uneasiness in his cold tones:    \"She is the Ruler destined to be my successor, for she is a Royal  Princess. When she becomes fully ripe I must abandon the sovereignty of  the Mangaboos to her.\"    \"Isn't she ripe now?\" asked Dorothy.    He hesitated.    \"Not quite,\" said he, finally. \"It will be several days before she needs  to be picked, or at least that is my judgment. I am in no hurry to  resign my office and be planted, you may be sure.\"    \"Probably not,\" declared the Wizard, nodding.    \"This is one of the most unpleasant things about our vegetable lives,\"  continued the Prince, with a sigh, \"that while we are in our full prime  we must give way to another, and be covered up in the ground to sprout  and grow and give birth to other people.\"    \"I'm sure the Princess is ready to be picked,\" asserted Dorothy, gazing  hard at the beautiful girl on the bush. \"She's as perfect as she can  be.\"    \"Never mind,\" answered the Prince, hastily, \"she will be all right for a  few days longer, and it is best for me to rule until I can dispose of  you strangers, who have come to our land uninvited and must be attended  to at once.\"    \"What are you going to do with us?\" asked Zeb.    \"That is a matter I have not quite decided upon,\" was the reply. \"I  think I shall keep this Wizard until a new Sorcerer is ready to pick,  for he seems quite skillful and may be of use to us. But the rest of you  must be destroyed in some way, and you cannot be planted, because I do  not wish horses and cats and meat people growing all over our country.\"    \"You needn't worry,\" said Dorothy. \"We wouldn't grow under ground, I'm  sure.\"    \"But why destroy my friends?\" asked the little Wizard. \"Why not let them  live?\"    \"They do not belong here,\" returned the Prince. \"They have no right to  be inside the earth at all.\"    \"We didn't ask to come down here; we fell,\" said Dorothy.    \"That is no excuse,\" declared the Prince, coldly.    The children looked at each other in perplexity, and the Wizard sighed.  Eureka rubbed her paw on her face and said in her soft, purring voice:    \"He won't need to destroy _me_, for if I don't get something to eat  pretty soon I shall starve to death, and so save him the trouble.\"    \"If he planted you, he might grow some cat-tails,\" suggested the Wizard.    \"Oh, Eureka! perhaps we can find you some milk-weeds to eat,\" said the  boy.    \"Phoo!\" snarled the kitten; \"I wouldn't touch the nasty things!\"    \"You don't need milk, Eureka,\" remarked Dorothy; \"you are big enough now  to eat any kind of food.\"    \"If I can get it,\" added Eureka.    \"I'm hungry myself,\" said Zeb. \"But I noticed some strawberries growing  in one of the gardens, and some melons in another place. These people  don't eat such things, so perhaps on our way back they will let us get  them.\"    \"Never mind your hunger,\" interrupted the Prince. \"I shall order you  destroyed in a few minutes, so you will have no need to ruin our pretty  melon vines and berry bushes. Follow me, please, to meet your doom.\"          CHAPTER 5.    DOROTHY PICKS THE PRINCESS      The words of the cold and moist vegetable Prince were not very  comforting, and as he spoke them he turned away and left the enclosure.  The children, feeling sad and despondent, were about to follow him when  the Wizard touched Dorothy softly on her shoulder.    \"Wait!\" he whispered.    \"What for?\" asked the girl.    \"Suppose we pick the Royal Princess,\" said the Wizard. \"I'm quite sure  she's ripe, and as soon as she comes to life she will be the Ruler, and  may treat us better than that heartless Prince intends to.\"    \"All right!\" exclaimed Dorothy, eagerly. \"Let's pick her while we have  the chance, before the man with the star comes back.\"    So together they leaned over the great bush and each of them seized one  hand of the lovely Princess.    \"Pull!\" cried Dorothy, and as they did so the royal lady leaned toward  them and the stems snapped and separated from her feet. She was not at  all heavy, so the Wizard and Dorothy managed to lift her gently to the  ground.    The beautiful creature passed her hands over her eyes an instant, tucked  in a stray lock of hair that had become disarranged, and after a look  around the garden made those present a gracious bow and said, in a sweet  but even toned voice:    \"I thank you very much.\"    \"We salute your Royal Highness!\" cried the Wizard, kneeling and kissing  her hand.    Just then the voice of the Prince was heard calling upon them to hasten,  and a moment later he returned to the enclosure, followed by a number of  his people.    Instantly the Princess turned and faced him, and when he saw that she  was picked the Prince stood still and began to tremble.    \"Sir,\" said the Royal Lady, with much dignity, \"you have wronged me  greatly, and would have wronged me still more had not these strangers  come to my rescue. I have been ready for picking all the past week, but  because you were selfish and desired to continue your unlawful rule,  you left me to stand silent upon my bush.\"    \"I did not know that you were ripe,\" answered the Prince, in a low  voice.    \"Give me the Star of Royalty!\" she commanded.    Slowly he took the shining star from his own brow and placed it upon  that of the Princess. Then all the people bowed low to her, and the  Prince turned and walked away alone. What became of him afterward our  friends never knew.    The people of Mangaboo now formed themselves into a procession and  marched toward the glass city to escort their new ruler to her palace  and to perform those ceremonies proper to the occasion. But while the  people in the procession walked upon the ground the Princess walked in  the air just above their heads, to show that she was a superior being  and more exalted than her subjects.    No one now seemed to pay any attention to the strangers, so Dorothy and  Zeb and the Wizard let the train pass on and then wandered by themselves  into the vegetable gardens. They did not bother to cross the bridges  over the brooks, but when they came to a stream they stepped high and  walked in the air to the other side. This was a very interesting  experience to them, and Dorothy said:    \"I wonder why it is that we can walk so easily in the air.\"    \"Perhaps,\" answered the Wizard, \"it is because we are close to the  center of the earth, where the attraction of gravitation is very slight.  But I've noticed that many queer things happen in fairy countries.\"    \"Is this a fairy country?\" asked the boy.    \"Of course it is,\" returned Dorothy, promptly. \"Only a fairy country  could have veg'table people;"]]]
