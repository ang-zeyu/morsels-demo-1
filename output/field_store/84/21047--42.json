On the whole  therefore--although I am not ignorant that, in many popularly elected  School Boards, there is a reaction in favour of \"the cheap system\" as  it is called--I am myself disposed to think that this is one of the  many cases in which expense is the truest economy.    But I must not allow questions of School Board politics to divert me  from my subject.  Enough has been said, I trust, to shew that  Recognition by Feeling is not so tedious or indecisive a process as  might have been supposed; and it is obviously more trustworthy than  Recognition by hearing.  Still there remains, as has been pointed out  above, the objection that this method is not without danger.  For this  reason many in the Middle and Lower classes, and all without exception  in the Polygonal and Circular orders, prefer a third method, the  description of which shall be reserved for the next section.          Section 6.  Of Recognition by Sight        I am about to appear very inconsistent.  In previous sections I have  said that all figures in Flatland present the appearance of a straight  line; and it was added or implied, that it is consequently impossible  to distinguish by the visual organ between individuals of different  classes:  yet now I am about to explain to my Spaceland critics how we  are able to recognize one another by the sense of sight.    If however the Reader will take the trouble to refer to the passage in  which Recognition by Feeling is stated to be universal, he will find  this qualification--\"among the lower classes\".  It is only among the  higher classes and in our temperate climates that Sight Recognition is  practised.    That this power exists in any regions and for any classes is the result  of Fog; which prevails during the greater part of the year in all parts  save the torrid zones.  That which is with you in Spaceland an unmixed  evil, blotting out the landscape, depressing the spirits, and  enfeebling the health, is by us recognized as a blessing scarcely  inferior to air itself, and as the Nurse of arts and Parent of  sciences.  But let me explain my meaning, without further eulogies on  this beneficent Element.    If Fog were non-existent, all lines would appear equally and  indistinguishably clear; and this is actually the case in those unhappy  countries in which the atmosphere is perfectly dry and transparent.  But wherever there is a rich supply of Fog objects that are at a  distance, say of three feet, are appreciably dimmer than those at a  distance of two feet eleven inches; and the result is that by careful  and constant experimental observation of comparative dimness and  clearness, we are enabled to infer with great exactness the  configuration of the object observed.    An instance will do more than a volume of generalities to make my  meaning clear.    Suppose I see two individuals approaching whose rank I wish to  ascertain.  They are, we will suppose, a Merchant and a Physician, or  in other words, an Equilateral Triangle and a Pentagon: how am I to  distinguish them?

CA and AB), so that I shall contemplate the two impartially, and  both will appear of the same size.    Now in the case of (1) the Merchant, what shall I see?  I shall see a  straight line DAE, in which the middle point (A) will be very bright  because it is nearest to me; but on either side the line will shade  away RAPIDLY INTO DIMNESS, because the sides AC and AB RECEDE RAPIDLY  INTO THE FOG and what appear to me as the Merchant's extremities, viz.  D and E, will be VERY DIM INDEED.    On the other hand in the case of (2) the Physician, though I shall here  also see a line (D'A'E') with a bright centre (A'), yet it will shade  away LESS RAPIDLY into dimness, because the sides (A'C', A'B') RECEDE  LESS RAPIDLY INTO THE FOG:  and what appear to me the Physician's  extremities, viz. D' and E', will not be NOT SO DIM as the extremities  of the Merchant.    The Reader will probably understand from these two instances how--after  a very long training supplemented by constant experience--it is  possible for the well-educated classes among us to discriminate with  fair accuracy between the middle and lowest orders, by the sense of  sight.  If my Spaceland Patrons have grasped this general conception,  so far as to conceive the possibility of it and not to reject my  account as altogether incredible--I shall have attained all I can  reasonably expect.  Were I to attempt further details I should only  perplex.  Yet for the sake of the young and inexperienced, who may  perchance infer--from the two simple instances I have given above, of  the manner in which I should recognize my Father and my Sons--that  Recognition by sight is an easy affair, it may be needful to point out  that in actual life most of the problems of Sight Recognition are far  more subtle and complex.    If for example, when my Father, the Triangle, approaches me, he happens  to present his side to me instead of his angle, then, until I have  asked him to rotate, or until I have edged my eye round him, I am for  the moment doubtful whether he may not be a Straight Line, or, in other  words, a Woman.  Again, when I am in the company of one of my two  hexagonal Grandsons, contemplating one of his sides (AB) full front, it  will be evident from the accompanying diagram that I shall see one  whole line (AB) in comparative brightness (shading off hardly at all at  the ends) and two smaller lines (CA and BD) dim throughout and shading  away into greater dimness towards the extremities C and D.      [Illustration 4]    [ASCII approximation follows]               /\\ -  _  C         /    \\    ||  _       /        \\  ||     -  _     /            \\||           -  _    |            A ||                 -  _    |              ||                       -+(> (Eye)    |            B ||                 _  -     \\            /||           _  -       \\        /  ||     _  -         \\    /    ||  -           \\/ _  -  D      But I must not give way to the temptation of enlarging on these topics.  The meanest mathematician in Spaceland will readily believe me when I  assert that the problems of life, which present themselves to the  well-educated--when they are themselves in motion, rotating, advancing  or retreating, and at the same time attempting to discriminate by the  sense of sight between a number of Polygons of high rank moving in  different directions, as for example in a ball-room or  conversazione--must be of a nature to task the angularity of the most  intellectual, and amply justify the rich endowments of the Learned  Professors of Geometry, both Static and Kinetic, in the illustrious  University of Wentbridge, where the Science and Art of Sight  Recognition are regularly taught to large classes of the ELITE of the  States.    It is only a few of the scions of our noblest and wealthiest houses,  who are able to give the time and money necessary for the thorough  prosecution of this noble and valuable Art.  Even to me, a  Mathematician of no mean standing, and the Grandfather of two most  hopeful and perfectly regular Hexagons, to find myself in the midst of  a crowd of rotating Polygons of the higher classes, is occasionally  very perplexing.  And of course to a common Tradesman, or Serf, such a  sight is almost as unintelligible as it would be to you, my Reader,  were you suddenly transported into our country.    In such a crowd you could see on all sides of you nothing but a Line,  apparently straight, but of which the parts would vary irregularly and  perpetually in brightness or dimness.  Even if you had completed your  third year in the Pentagonal and Hexagonal classes in the University,  and were perfect in the theory of the subject, you would still find  that there was need of many years of experience, before you could move  in a fashionable crowd without jostling against your betters, whom it  is against etiquette to ask to \"feel\", and who, by their superior  culture and breeding, know all about your movements, while you know  very little or nothing about theirs.  In a word, to comport oneself  with perfect propriety in Polygonal society, one ought to be a Polygon  oneself.  Such at least is the painful teaching of my experience.    It is astonishing how much the Art--or I may almost call it  instinct--of Sight Recognition is developed by the habitual practice of  it and by the avoidance of the custom of \"Feeling\".  Just as, with you,  the deaf and dumb, if once allowed to gesticulate and to use the  hand-alphabet, will never acquire the more difficult but far more  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20102"],[0,"The International Monthly Magazine - Volume V - No II (#6)"],[1,"here, better than in any      other land in the world, ultimately attain to happiness and      fortune. In times like ours, when every branch of industry is      crowded, when tender parents think with grief and trouble on the      future prospects of their children, there are for the emigrant no      other resources save those held out by a full and bountiful      nature, and no means of livelihood which may be so certainly      depended upon as those afforded by agriculture. Here it is that      industry throws open the widest field, and affords the fullest      opportunity of doing good.\"      In the following extract, our author proceeds to set forth the national  character of the American:          \"The national character of the American has been greatly      misunderstood; few travellers seem, in fact, to have understood      it, since they mention it as something as new and unfounded as the      country itself, and yet it is so well confirmed--so well      established in every elevated and noble characteristic of the      human race, that it may confidently be placed in comparison with      that of the most celebrated nations of antiquity. Springing      originally from England, they have the pride and manly confidence      of the Briton, for through their ancestry they claim an equal      share of all which gives dignity to those inheriting glory and a      great name. Their forefathers were those brave religious pilgrims      who were transferred by British laws (or rather by old German) and      British genius to the shores of the new world--to there give to      those laws and genius an immortality. Building still further on      this new land, they opened the temple of the Lord to all his      followers, and received with open arms all the unfortunate or      oppressed exiles of Europe. For the first time in reality in this      world they flung wide the flag of truth and freedom--fought under      its folds an unequal fight against the mightiest power in the      world--and overcame it. And when a second time they armed      themselves to combat with England, they again came forth      unconquered from the contest. Reason enough this for the national      pride of the American, for nothing could more naturally cause a      certain degree of self-content than to belong to a nation whose      brilliant deeds in war as in politics, in commerce as in      manufactures, have astonished the world. A second and not less      characteristic trait of the American is seen in a certain      earnestness, which appears to strangers to indicate a want of      sociable feeling--and yet perhaps in _no_ country is true noble      sociability as developed in domestic life, so much at home, as in      America.        \"Accustomed from his cradle to reflect on himself and his      circumstances, the American from the first instant of his entry      into active life is ever on the watch to improve their condition.      Is he rich, and consequently more directly interested in the      common wealth, then every new law, every change in the personal      direction of the government, awakes in him a new care for the      future, while on the other hand, if poor, then every change in the      state may perhaps afford him a new opportunity of bettering his      condition. Therefore he is ever wide awake--ever looking out for      the future, not as a mere spectator, but as one playing a part and      occupied in maintaining the present state of affairs, or in      improving them. The entire mass of the population is continually      in a state of political agitation, and, urged by hope of their aid      or fear of their power, we see every one continually seeking for      expressions of public opinion. No man is so rich or powerful that      he need not fear them--none so wretched and poor but that he may      venture to entertain the hope of being through them aided and      relieved. Public opinion is in America the mightiest organ of      justice--shielding no one, from the president to the simplest      citizen, and proceeds, mowing, casting down, or grinding to powder      all things which oppose it and deserve its condemnation.        \"This condition of perpetual agitation gives the American an      appearance of ceaseless restlessness, but it is in reality the      true ground of peace and content. _The American has no time to be      discontented_, and this is the most praiseworthy point of their      constitution and popular life. The republican has necessarily as      many severe and arduous duties to fulfil as the inhabitants of any      monarchy--but their fulfilment is gratifying and consoling--for it      is allied to the consciousness of power. The American has no      desire for the quiet temper of the European, and least of all for      the silent happiness of the German, which last, alas! appears      since the dissipation of the intoxication of the Revolution of      March, 1848, to consist, as far as the great mass of the      population is concerned, merely in the egotistic repose of      self-sufficiency, weakness, and ignorance. The American finds      repose only in his house, in his family circle, and among his      children; all without the walls of that home is an incessant      working and striving, in politics as in trade--by the streets and      canals, as in the woods of the West. Different as the elements are      from which the inhabitants of the United States are formed, and      different as the circumstances may be under which they live, there      still prevails among them a certain unity of character, an      equanimity of feeling, which it would be difficult to parallel,      resulting perhaps from the very heterogeneousness and mixture of      elements itself, since no one element allows to another      pre-eminence. They have all something in common in their      appearance, which gives them the air almost of relations--something      in their gait and manners which declares them to be other than      English, Germans, or French. Through the entire land, through      every class, there is disseminated a certain refinement of manner,      an appreciation of decency and nobility of character, which      springs from a consciousness of their own rights and respect for      mankind. Even emigrants, in America, soon learn to cast aside      their rough prejudices as regards caste, for the proud affability      of the aristocratic, the vanity of the small citizen, the want of      confidence and ease in the mechanic, the slavish servitude and      snappish insolence of liveried servants, find in America no place.      _Man_ is there esteemed only as _man_--only ability gains honor--and      where _that_ is, and there alone, can true nobility be found. No      one there inquires who a man is, or who were his parents, but      'What can he _do_, what are his capabilities, and what can he      produce?' Rank and caste are in America unknown. Every man feels      his freedom and independence, and expresses himself accordingly.      Even the servant is a free man, who has, it is true, hired his      service, but not his entire existence. The American is polite, but      over-refined, unmeaning compliments form no part of his manners,      nor does he expect them from others. No man vexes or troubles      himself for another, in consequence of which we find in American      society very little stiffness and reserve, yet we find in every      respect that the very highest regard is there paid to propriety      and decency--particularly as regards the female sex, since in no      country, not even in England, do ladies enjoy such respect and      regard as in the United States. Ever depending upon, and confiding      in himself, the American is in his manners free, open, and      unreserved. The mass of the people is possessed of intelligence      and spirit, though not so scientifically educated as in Europe,      and a higher degree of intelligence penetrates even the lower      class, who consequently form a marked and singular contrast with      those of like rank in Europe. It is not from being versed in the      higher branches of abstract learning and science, but from the      great amount of that direct practical knowledge which exerts the      greatest influence in making life happy, that the Americans are      distinguished from other nations, and for the acquisition of which      they have made better provision and preparation than any other      people. As yet too deeply occupied with the Needful and Important,      they are compelled to leave the development of the higher branches      to the care and noble generosity of individuals. But a glance at      the sums which are annually devoted to the establishment and      maintenance of schools and universities, will suffice to evidence      the liberality with which the proper education of the people is      cared for in the United States. Knowledge is indeed esteemed, but      only according to its use and applicability to the wants of life;      so that a practical tanner is there worth more than a learned      pedant. _Wealth, or rather wealth allied to ability and      universality of talent, is there more highly esteemed than      learning,_ while hospitality, patriotism, and toleration, allowing      every one to think and feel as he likes, are universal      characteristics. So that in the United States nothing is wanting      to the attainment of a true civil and social freedom, even though      the means thereto are not invariably correctly understood or      admitted (as is indeed the case by us), and though--since men are      every where subject to the same weaknesses--they measure happiness      rather by the standard of their own intelligence and virtues, than      by fortune and nature, which latter, impartially considered, is      the basis of the physical happiness of the American. That,      however, which"]]]
