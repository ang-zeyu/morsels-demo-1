Americans were sometimes made prisoners and kept in the prisons of  England.    Mr. Morse tried to help some of them.    You have heard of the great French general, Napoleon.    You know of the many wars he had.    In 1815, Napoleon met his enemies, the English and Prussians.    They had a battle at Waterloo.    Napoleon was defeated.    The people of England were anxious for news.    But how slowly news came in those days!    It took many days to carry the good tidings.    The battle was fought on the 18th day of June.    It was not until July that the news came of the victory of the  English general.    Mr. Morse wrote about it to his parents.    He told how anxiously the people had waited.    Finally the people heard the booming of cannon.    The bells were rung.    People laughed and cried for joy.    Would it not seem strange to us now to wait for our news so long?    Yet the inventor of the telegraph had to wait often very long.    But at last the time came for Mr. Morse to return to America.    He sailed in August, 1815.    He bore with him the good wishes of his many friends in London.    He had a stormy voyage.    A ship signaled his ship for help.    The captain did not wish to send help.    He said he had all he could do to attend to his own ship.    Mr. Morse told him that, if he did not help them, he would publish  the facts when they reached America.    So the captain thought better of it.    He helped to save the ship.    When he landed on his return Mr. Morse found that the people of  America had heard of him.    They knew of the fine pictures he had painted.    He was now but twenty-four years of age.    He set up a studio in Boston.    But the people of America were not as interested in art then as now.    He waited many months for something to do.    But nobody came for a picture.    He left Boston almost penniless.    Then he began painting portraits in different places.    He received fifteen dollars for each portrait.    He went to Concord, New Hampshire.    There he met a beautiful young lady.    Her name was Lucretia P. Walker.    She had a very sweet temper.    She always used good sense.    Mr. Morse became more and more successful with his portraits.    He received more money for them.    He went on a journey to the South.    There he found much to do.    He made three thousand dollars.    Then he came back to Concord.    There he married Miss Walker.    Mr. and Mrs. Morse lived for a few years in South Carolina.    Then they came to New Haven, Connecticut.    His father came to live with them there.    Mr. Morse began to paint a great picture at Washington.    It was called \"The House of Representatives.\"    Washington is the capital city of the United States.    The picture, when finished, was very beautiful.    It was sold at last to an Englishman.    About this time a great friend of America visited Washington.    Have you heard of General La Fayette?    You can read what great things he did for our country.    Every American loved him then.    Even the people who live now, love his memory.    Mr. Morse was engaged to paint the portrait of General La Fayette.    He began the picture.    Before he had finished, he received dreadful news from home.    His loved wife had died very suddenly.    He hastened home.    It seemed too hard to bear.    Not long afterwards he lost his father.    He then went to live in New York.    There he worked hard at his art.    His artist friends made him president of their society.    This was the National Academy.    While in New York he heard some lectures about electricity.    He thought about it and talked much with his friends.    He wished to visit beautiful Italy.    So, in 1829, he sailed for Europe.    His friends there gave him a hearty welcome.    He visited many cities.    He met General La Fayette again.    He visited him in his home.    Mr. Morse had always been fond of inventions.    He himself invented a pump at one time.    At another, he tried his hand at making a machine for cutting  marble.    He was always experimenting with colors, and other things used by  artists.    The year 1832 had arrived.    You will see, by and by, that it is a good date to remember.    People knew almost nothing about speed in traveling.    In that year the longest railroad was in the southern part of the  United States.    It was one hundred thirty-five miles long.    The next longer was in England.    It was thirty miles long.    The next was in Massachusetts.    It was ten miles long.    The mails were carried in coaches.    On the first day of October, 1832, Mr. Morse sailed for America.    The name of this ship was the \"Sully.\"    The passengers were much interested in some things which had lately  been found out about electricity.    People had long known that lightning and electricity were the same.    Signals had been made with electricity.    But the thought which came to Mr. Morse had never entered the mind  of man before.    He could think of nothing but a telegraph.    He thought night and day.    He seemed to see the end from the beginning.    As he sat upon the deck of the ship after dinner, he drew out a  little note book.    He began his plan in this little book.    From the beginning he said, \"If a message will go ten miles without  dropping, I can make it go around the globe.\"    And he said this again and again during the years that came after.    Sleep forsook him.    But one morning at the breakfast table he announced his plan.    He showed it to the passengers.    And five years after, when the model was built, it was found to be  like the one shown that morning on board the ship \"Sully.\"        \"The steed called Lightning (say the Fates)      Was tamed in the United States;      'Twas Franklin's hand that caught the horse,      'Twas harnessed by Professor Morse.\"    Upon landing in America a long struggle began.    For twelve long years, Mr. Morse worked to get people to notice his  invention.      [Illustration: DIAGRAM SHOWING THE MORSE ALPHABET AND    ARRANGEMENT OF THE TELEGRAPH LINE.]    It would take much money to construct a real telegraph.    But money Mr. Morse did not have.    He had three motherless children to provide for.    He lived in a room in a fifth story of a building belonging to his  brothers.    This room was his study, studio, bed chamber, parlor, kitchen,  drawing room and work shop.    On one side of the room was his cot bed.    On the other were his tools.    He brought his simple food to his room at night.    This he did, that no one might see how little he had to eat.    He often gave lessons in painting.    One pupil did not pay promptly.    Mr. Morse asked to be paid.    The pupil gave him ten dollars, asking if he would accept it.    He said it would keep him from starving.    He had had nothing to eat for twenty-four hours.    The government, at this time, was giving some work to American  artists.    Mr. Morse knew he deserved to have a picture to paint.    But, through a mistake, he was not given one.    He felt much hurt by this.    But perhaps he would not have pushed his telegraph through, if he  had been given plenty of painting to do.    As it was, Morse, the painter, became Morse, the inventor.    It was not until 1837 that Mr. Morse had his wonderful invention  ready to exhibit.    During that year many people saw it.    Many thought it a silly toy.    Few dreamed of its importance.    Mr. Alfred Vail, whose father and brother had large brass and iron  works, was one of those who believed in it.    Mr. Vail decided to assist Mr. Morse.    He was young and liked machinery.    Long after, Mr. Morse said that much of the success of the telegraph  was due to Mr. Vail.    In 1838, Mr. Morse asked Congress to give him aid.    He wished to build a telegraph between Baltimore and Washington.    The President and others saw the telegraph exhibited.    A gentleman, named Mr. F.O.J. Smith, helped Mr. Morse with money.    But many Congressmen laughed at the idea.    Do you not think they felt ashamed when they found how great a thing  they had been laughing at?    While waiting for Congress to decide, Mr. Morse went to Europe  again.    He tried to get a patent in London, but it was refused him.    The French people gave him a paper which didn't mean much.    He met some great men, however, who did all they could for him.    Did you ever see a daguerreotype?    It is an old fashioned portrait.    Perhaps you can find some at home.    Mr. Morse met in Paris the man who first took these pictures.    His name was Mr. Daguerre.    You see how the pictures were named.    He was exhibiting his pictures at this time.    So the two greatest things in Paris in those days were the  electro-magnetic telegraph and daguerreotypes.    Mr. Daguerre and Mr. Morse became fast friends.    Mr. Daguerre taught Mr. Morse how to take daguerreotypes.    When Mr. Morse returned to America, he took some portraits of this  kind.    He also taught others how to do so.    Having returned to America, he found plenty to do.    He wished to try the telegraph under water.    He arranged about two miles of wire.    He put it into New York Harbor.    A row boat was used in placing it.    It was a beautiful moonlight night.    People walking along the shore might well wonder what kind of fish  were to be caught with such a long line.    At day break Professor Morse was ready for his experiment.    Two or three characters were sent on the line.    Then no more could be sent.    Some sailors, in pulling up their anchor, had caught the wire.    They pulled in about two hundred feet.    Then they cut the wire.    So ended the first cable.    The Vails had been good friends to Mr. Morse.    But they became afraid to spend any more money.    Then, indeed, Mr. Morse was in despair.    A bill had been brought before Congress, asking for thirty thousand  dollars."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19549"],[0,"The Mind of the Child, Part II (#6)"],[1,", throwing away of  playthings is rare (50).    _Interpretation of what is seen._--Anxiety on seeing man dressed in  black (64).
