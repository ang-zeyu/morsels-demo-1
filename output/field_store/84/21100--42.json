What these men did there, and how Balboa rose to further  prominence, his great exploits, and finally how unkind Fate also  overtook him, will form the subject of the next paper.        [1] At least, the assertion is gravely made by the ancient chroniclers.  I wonder what kind of an outfielder he would have made today.    [2] From the Spanish word \"bachiller,\" referring to an inferior degree  in the legal profession.    [3] In the absence of particular information, I suppose the ships to be  small caravels of between fifty and sixty tons, and the brigantines  much smaller, open, flat-bottomed boats with but one mast--although a  modern brigantine is a two-masted vessel.    [4] The castellano was valued at two dollars and fifty-six cents, but  the purchasing power of that sum was much greater then than now.  The  maravedi was the equivalent of about one-third of a cent.    [5] Evidently he was quoting the exquisite measures of the Eightieth  Psalm, one of the most touching appeals of David the Poet-King, in  which he says over and over again, \"Turn us again, O God, and cause Thy  Face to shine, and we shall be saved.\"          {31}    II    Panama, Balboa and a Forgotten Romance      I. The Coming of the Devastator    This is the romantic history of Vasco Nunez de Balboa, the most  knightly and gentle of the Spanish discoverers, and one who would fain  have been true to the humble Indian girl who had won his heart, even  though his life and liberty were at stake.  It is almost the only love  story in early Spanish-American history, and the account of it,  veracious though it is, reads like a novel or a play.    After Diego de Nicuesa had sailed away from Antigua on that enforced  voyage from which he never returned, Vasco Nunez de Balboa was supreme  on the Isthmus.  Encisco, however, remained to make trouble.  In order  to secure internal peace before prosecuting some further expeditions,  Balboa determined to send him back to Spain, as the easiest way of  getting rid of his importunities and complaints.    A more truculent commander would have no difficulty in inventing a  pretext for taking off his head.  A more prudent captain would have  realized that Encisco with his trained mouth could do very much more  harm to him in Spain than he could in Darien.  Balboa thought to  nullify that possibility, however, by sending Valdivia, with a present,  to Hispaniola, and Zamudio {32} with the Bachelor to Spain to lay the  state of affairs before the King.  Encisco was a much better advocate  than Balboa's friend Zamudio, and the King of Spain credited the one  and disbelieved the other.  He determined to appoint a new governor for  the Isthmus, and decided that Balboa should be proceeded against  rigorously for nearly all the crimes in the decalogue, the most serious  accusation being that to him was due the death of poor Nicuesa.  For by  this time everybody was sure that the poor little meat-carver was no  more.    An enterprise against the French which had been declared off filled  Spain with needy cavaliers who had started out for an adventure and  were greatly desirous of having one.  Encisco and Zamudio had both  enflamed the minds of the Spanish people with fabulous stories of the  riches of Darien.  It was curiously believed that gold was so plentiful  that it could be fished up in nets from the rivers.  Such a piscatorial  prospect was enough to unlock the coffers of a prince as selfish as  Ferdinand.  He was willing to risk fifty thousand ducats in the  adventure, which was to be conducted on a grand scale.  No such  expedition to America had ever been prepared before as that destined  for Darien.    Among the many claimants for its command, he picked out an old cavalier  named Pedro Arias de Avila, called by the Spaniards Pedrarias.[1]    This Pedrarias was seventy-two years old.  He was of good birth and  rich, and was the father of a large and interesting family, which he  prudently left behind him in Spain.  His wife, however, insisted on  going {33} with him to the New World.  Whether or not this was a proof  of wifely devotion--and if it was, it is the only thing in history to  his credit--or of an unwillingness to trust Pedrarias out of her sight,  which is more likely, is not known.  At any rate, she went along.    Pedrarias, up to the time of his departure from Spain, had enjoyed two  nick-names, El Galan and El Justador.  He had been a bold and dashing  cavalier in his youth, a famous tilter in tournaments in his middle  age, and a hard-fighting soldier all his life.  His patron was Bishop  Fonseca.  Whatever qualities he might possess for the important work  about to be devolved upon him would be developed later.    His expedition included from fifteen hundred to two thousand souls, and  there were at least as many more who wanted to go and could not for  lack of accommodations.  The number of ships varies in different  accounts from nineteen to twenty-five.  The appointments both of the  general expedition and the cavaliers themselves were magnificent in the  extreme.  Many afterward distinguished in America went in Pedrarias's  command, chief among them being De Soto.  Among others were Quevedo,  the newly appointed Bishop of Darien, and Espinosa, the judge.    The first fleet set sail on the 11th of April, 1514, and arrived at  Antigua without mishap on the 29th of June in the same year.  The  colony at that place, which had been regularly laid out as a town with  fortifications and with some degree at least of European comfort,  numbered some three hundred hard-bitten soldiers.  The principle of the  survival of the fittest had resulted in the selection of the best men  from all the previous expeditions.  They would have been a {34}  dangerous body to antagonize.  Pedrarias was in some doubt as to how  Balboa would receive him.  He dissembled his intentions toward him,  therefore, and sent an officer ashore to announce the meaning of the  flotilla which whitened the waters of the bay.    The officer found Balboa, dressed in a suit of pajamas engaged in  superintending the roofing of a house.  The officer, brilliant in silk  and satin and polished armour, was astonished at the simplicity of  Vasco Nunez's appearance.  He courteously delivered his message,  however, to the effect that yonder was the fleet of Don Pedro Arias de  Avila, the new Governor of Darien.    [Illustration: \"Balboa . . . Engaged in Superintending the Roofing of a  House\"]    Balboa calmly bade the messenger tell Pedrarias that he could come  ashore in safety and that he was very welcome.  Balboa was something of  a dissembler himself on occasion, as you will see.  Pedrarias thereupon  debarked in great state with his men, and, as soon as he firmly got  himself established on shore, arrested Balboa and presented him for  trial before Espinosa for the death of Nicuesa.      II. The Greatest Exploit since Columbus's Voyage    During all this long interval, Balboa had not been idle.  A singular  change had taken place in his character.  He had entered upon the  adventure in his famous barrel on Encisco's ship as a reckless,  improvident, roisterous, careless, hare-brained scapegrace.  Responsibility and opportunity had sobered and elevated him.  While he  had lost none of his dash and daring and brilliancy, yet he had become  a wise, a prudent and a most successful captain.  Judged by the high  standard of the modern times, Balboa was {35} cruel and ruthless enough  to merit our severe condemnation.  Judged by his environments and  contrasted with any other of the Spanish conquistadores he was an angel  of light.      [Illustration: \"The Expedition Had to Fight Its Way Through Tribes of  Warlike and Ferocious Mountaineers\"]    He seems to have remained always a generous, affectionate, open-hearted  soldier.  He had conducted a number of expeditions after the departure  of Nicuesa to different parts of the Isthmus, and he amassed much  treasure thereby, but he always so managed affairs that he left the  Indian chiefs in possession of their territory and firmly attached to  him personally.  There was no indiscriminate murder, outrage or plunder  in his train, and the Isthmus was fairly peaceable.  Balboa had tamed  the tempers of the fierce soldiery under him to a remarkable degree,  and they had actually descended to cultivating the soil between periods  of gold-hunting and pearl-fishing.  The men under him were devotedly  attached to him as a rule, although here and there a malcontent, unruly  soldier, restless under the iron discipline, hated his captain.    Fortunately he had been warned by a letter from Zamudio, who had found  means to send it via Hispaniola, of the threatening purpose of  Pedrarias and the great expedition.  Balboa stood well with the  authorities in Hispaniola.  Diego Columbus had given him a commission  as Vice-Governor of Darien, so that as Darien was clearly within Diego  Columbus's jurisdiction, Balboa was strictly under authority.  The news  in Zamudio's letter was very disconcerting.  Like every Spaniard, Vasco  Nunez knew that he could expect little mercy and scant justice from a  trial conducted under such auspices as Pedrarias's.  He determined,  therefore, to secure himself in his position by some splendid  achievement, which would so work upon the {36} feelings of the King  that he would be unable, for very gratitude, to press hard upon him.    The exploit that he meditated and proposed to accomplish was the  discovery of the ocean upon the other side of the Isthmus.  When  Nicuesa came down from Nombre de Dios, he left there a little handful  of men.  Balboa sent an expedition to rescue them and brought them down  to Antigua.  Either on that expedition or on another shortly afterward,  two white men painted as Indians discovered themselves to Balboa in the  forest.  They proved to be Spaniards who had fled from Nicuesa to  escape punishment for some fault "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20912"],[0,"The Daffodil Mystery (#6)"],[1,"off the possibility as absurd, and,  walking to the door, called his Chinese servant.    Ling Chu came silently at his bidding.    \"Ling Chu,\" he said, \"the white-faced man is dead.\"    Ling Chu raised his imperturbable eyes to his master's face.    \"All men die some time,\" he said calmly. \"This man quick die. That is  better than long die.\"    Tarling looked at him sharply.    \"How do you know that he quick die?\" he demanded.    \"These things are talked about,\" said Ling Chu without hesitation.    \"But not in the Chinese language,\" replied Tarling, \"and, Ling Chu, you  speak no English.\"    \"I speak a little, master,\" said Ling Chu, \"and I have heard these things  in the streets.\"    Tarling did not answer immediately, and the Chinaman waited.    \"Ling Chu,\" he said after awhile, \"this man came to Shanghai whilst we  were there, and there was trouble-trouble. Once he was thrown out from  Wing Fu's tea-house, where he had been smoking opium. Also there was  another trouble--do you remember?\"    The Chinaman looked him straight in the eyes.    \"I am forgetting,\" he said. \"This white-face was a bad man. I am glad he  is dead.\"    \"Humph!\" said Tarling, and dismissed his retainer.    Ling Chu was the cleverest of all his sleuths, a man who never lifted his  nose from the trail once it was struck, and he had been the most loyal  and faithful of Tarling's native trailers. But the detective never  pretended that he understood Ling Chu's mind, or that he could pierce the  veil which the native dropped between his own private thoughts and the  curious foreigner. Even native criminals were baffled in their  interpretation of Ling Chu's views, and many a man had gone to the  scaffold puzzling the head, which was soon to be snicked from his body,  over the method by which Ling Chu had detected his crime.    Tarling went back to the table and picked up the newspaper, but had  hardly begun to read when the telephone bell rang. He picked up the  receiver and listened. To his amazement it was the voice of Cresswell,  the Assistant Commissioner of Police, who had been instrumental in  persuading Tarling to come to England.    \"Can you come round to the Yard immediately, Tarling?\" said the voice. \"I  want to talk to you about this murder.\"    \"Surely,\" said Tarling. \"I'll be with you in a few minutes.\"    In five minutes he was at Scotland Yard and was ushered into the office  of Assistant Commissioner Cresswell. The white-haired man who came across  to meet him with a smile of pleasure in his eyes disclosed the object of  the summons.    \"I'm going to bring you into this case, Tarling,\" he said. \"It has  certain aspects which seem outside the humdrum experience of our own  people. It is not unusual, as you know,\" he said, as he motioned the  other to a chair, \"for Scotland Yard to engage outside help, particularly  when we have a crime of this character to deal with. The facts you know,\"  he went on, as he opened a thin folder. \"These are the reports, which you  can read at your leisure. Thornton Lyne was, to say the least, eccentric.  His life was not a particularly wholesome one, and he had many  undesirable acquaintances, amongst whom was a criminal and ex-convict  who was only released from gaol a few days ago.\"    \"That's rather extraordinary,\" said Tarling, lifting his eyebrows. \"What  had he in common with the criminal?\"    Commissioner Cresswell shrugged his shoulders.    \"My own view is that this acquaintance was rather a pose of Lyne's. He  liked to be talked about. It gave him a certain reputation for character  amongst his friends.\"    \"Who is the criminal?\" asked Tarling.    \"He is a man named Stay, a petty larcenist, and in my opinion a much more  dangerous character than the police have realised.\"    \"Is he----\" began Tarling. But the Commissioner shook his head.    \"I think we can rule him out from the list of people who may be suspected  of this murder,\" he said. \"Sam Stay has very few qualities that would  commend themselves to the average man, but there can be no doubt at all  that he was devoted to Lyne, body and soul. When the detective  temporarily in charge of the case went down to Lambeth to interview Stay,  he found him lying on his bed prostrate with grief, with a newspaper  containing the particulars of the murder by his side. The man is beside  himself with sorrow, and threatens to 'do in' the person who is  responsible for this crime. You can interview him later. I doubt whether  you will get much out of him, because he is absolutely incoherent. Lyne  was something more than human in his eyes, and I should imagine that the  only decent emotion he has had in his life is this affection for a man  who was certainly good to him, whether he was sincere in his philanthropy  or otherwise. Now here are a few of the facts which have not been made  public.\" Cresswell settled himself back in his chair and ticked off on  his fingers the points as he made them.    \"You know that around Lyne's chest a silk night-dress was discovered?\"    Tarling nodded.    \"Under the night-dress, made into a pad, evidently with the object of  arresting the bleeding, were two handkerchiefs, neatly folded, as though  they had been taken from a drawer. They were ladies' handkerchiefs, so we  may start on the supposition that there is a woman in the case.\"    Tarling nodded.    \"Now another peculiar feature of the case, which happily has escaped the  attention of those who saw the body first and gave particulars to the  newspapers, was that Lyne, though fully dressed, wore a pair of thick  felt slippers. They were taken out of his own store yesterday evening, as  we have ascertained, by Lyne himself, who sent for one of his assistants  to his office and told him to get a pair of very soft-soled slippers.    \"The third item is that Lyne's boots were discovered in the deserted  motor-car which was drawn up by the side of the road a hundred yards from  where the body was lying.    \"And the fourth feature--and this explains why I have brought you into  the case--is that in the car was discovered his bloodstained coat and  waistcoat. In the right-hand pocket of the latter garment,\" said  Cresswell, speaking slowly, \"was found this.\" He took from his drawer a  small piece of crimson paper two inches square, and handed it without  comment to the detective.    Tarling took the paper and stared. Written in thick black ink were four  Chinese characters, \"_tzu chao fan nao_\"--\"He brought this trouble  upon himself.\"          CHAPTER VI    THE MOTHER OF ODETTE RIDER      The two men looked at one another in silence.    \"Well?\" said the Commissioner at last.    Tarling shook his head.    \"That's amazing,\" he said, and looked at the little slip of paper between  his finger and thumb.    \"You see why I am bringing you in,\" said the Commissioner. \"If there is a  Chinese end to this crime, nobody knows better than you how to deal with  it. I have had this slip translated. It means 'He brought this trouble  upon himself.'\"    \"Literally, 'self look for trouble,'\" said Tarling. \"But there is one  fact which you may not have noticed. If you will look at the slip, you  will see that it is not written but printed.\"    He passed the little red square across the table, and the Commissioner  examined it.    \"That's true,\" he said in surprise. \"I did not notice that. Have you seen  these slips before?\"    Tarling nodded.    \"A few years ago,\" he said. \"There was a very bad outbreak of crime in  Shanghai, mostly under the leadership of a notorious criminal whom I was  instrumental in getting beheaded. He ran a gang called 'The Cheerful  Hearts'--you know the fantastic titles which these Chinese gangs adopt.  It was their custom to leave on the scene of their depredations the  _Hong_, or sign-manual of the gang. It was worded exactly as this slip,  only it was written. These visiting cards of 'The Cheerful Hearts' were  bought up as curios, and commanded high prices until some enterprising  Chinaman started printing them, so that you could buy them at almost any  stationer's shop in Shanghai--just as you buy picture post-cards.\"    The Commissioner nodded.    \"And this is one of those?\"    \"This is such a one. How it came here, heaven knows,\" he said. \"It is  certainly the most remarkable discovery.\"    The Commissioner went to a cupboard, unlocked it and took out a  suit-case, which he placed upon the table and opened.    \"Now,\" said the Commissioner, \"look at this, Tarling.\"    \"This\" was a stained garment, which Tarling had no difficulty in  recognising as a night-dress. He took it out and examined it. Save for  two sprays of forget-me-nots upon the sleeves it was perfectly plain and  was innocent of lace or embroidery.    \"It was found round his body, and here are the handkerchiefs.\" He pointed  to two tiny squares of linen, so discoloured as to be hardly  recognisable.    Tarling lifted the flimsy garment, with its evidence of the terrible  purpose for which it had been employed, and carried it to the light.    \"Are there laundry marks?\"    \"None whatever,\" said the Commissioner.    \"Or on the handkerchiefs?\"    \"None,\" replied Mr. Cresswell.    \"The property of a girl who lived alone,\" said Tarling. \"She is not very  well off, but extremely neat, fond of good things, but not extravagant,  eh?\"    \"How do you know that?\" asked the Commissioner, surprised.    Tarling laughed.    \"The absence of laundry marks shows that she washes her silk garments at  home, and probably her handkerchiefs also, which places her amongst the  girls who aren't blessed with too many of this world's goods. The fact  that it is silk, and good silk, and that the handkerchiefs are good  linen, suggests a woman who takes a great deal of trouble, yet whom one  would not expect to find over-dressed. Have you any other clue?\"    \"None,\" said the Commissioner. \"We have discovered that Mr. Lyne had  rather a serious quarrel with one of his employees, a Miss Odette  Rider----\""]]]
