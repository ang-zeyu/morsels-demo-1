[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21534"],[0,"Textiles and Clothing (#6)"],[1," thread of both warp and filling  passes alternately over and under the threads at right angles. This  makes a comparatively open cloth, requiring the smallest amount of yarn  for the surface covered. This weave is used in nearly all cotton goods,  as in muslins, sheetings, calicoes, ginghams, and thin woolen goods.  Even in the plain weave variety is obtained by having some of the  threads larger than others, either in warp or filling or both, thus  producing stripes and checked effects.      [Illustration: SECTIONS OF WEAVES    _a_--Plain weave; _b_--Prunella twill; _c_--Cassimere twill;  _d_--Swansdown twill.]      [Sidenote: Twills]    After the plain weave the twill is the most common, being much used for  dress goods, suitings, etc., as well as some of the thicker cottons. In  this weave the intersections of the threads produce characteristic lines  diagonally across the fabric, most often at an angle of 45 deg.. The twill  may be hardly visible or very pronounced. The simplest twills are the  so-called \"doeskin\" and \"prunella.\" In the doeskin the filling threads  pass over one and under two of the warp threads and in the prunella  twill over two and under one. The most common twill is the cassimere  twill in which both the warp and filling run over two and under two of  the threads at right angles.      [Illustration: DIAGRAM OF RIB AND BASKET WEAVE AND DOUBLE CLOTH]      [Sidenote: Uneven Twills]    A twill made by running both warp and filling under one and over three  threads is called a swansdown twill and the reverse is known as the crow  weave. In these the diagonal twilled effect is much more marked. Various  twills are often combined with each other and with plain weave, making a  great variety of texture. Numerous uneven twills are made, two over and  three under, etc., etc.    [Sidenote: Sateen Weave]    In the sateen weave, nearly all of either the warp or the filling  threads are on the surface, the object being to produce a smooth surface  fabric like sateen. With this weave it is possible to use a cotton warp  and silk filling, having most of the silk appear on the surface of the  fabric.      [Illustration: TEXTILE DESIGN    _A_--On cross-section paper; _B_--Graphic diagram.]      [Sidenote: Rib and Basket Weaves]    The rib and basket weaves are derivatives of the plain weave, two or  more threads replacing the single strand. In the rib weave, either the  warp or the filling threads run double or more, thus making a corded  effect. In the basket weave, both warp and filling are run double or  treble, giving a coarse texture. This weave is sometimes called the  panama weave.    [Sidenote: Double Cloth]    In the thicker fabrics like men's suitings and overcoatings, there may  be a double series of warp threads, only one series appearing on the  face of the goods, and in the still thicker fabrics, there may be a  double set of both warp and filling threads, making double cloth, the  two sides of which may be entirely different in color and design.    [Sidenote: Velvet]    In weaving plush, velvet and velveteen, loops are made in the filling or  warp threads which are afterwards cut, producing the pile.          BLEACHING, DYEING, PRINTING, FINISHING      When the cloth comes from the loom it is by no means ready for the  market. Nearly all kinds are washed and pressed and in some classes of  goods the finishing process is very elaborate.      BLEACHING AND DYEING    The fiber may be dyed in a loose or unspun state, as is customary with  wool; after it has been spun and is in the form of yarn, as in the case  of silk and linen; and when it has been woven to form cloth, as is most  commonly the case with cotton.    [Sidenote: Madder Bleach]    The bleaching of cotton involves a number of steps, the most thorough  process being called the \"madder bleach,\" in which the cloth is (1) wet  out, (2) boiled with lime water, (3) rinsed, (4) treated with acid, (5)  rinsed, (6) boiled with soap and alkali, (7) rinsed, (8) treated with  bleaching powder solution, (9) rinsed, (10) treated with acid, (11)  finally rinsed again. All this is done by machines and hundreds of yards  go through the process at a time. The product is a pure white cloth  suitable for dyeing light shades and for white goods. When cloth is to  be dyed a dark shade the treatment is less elaborate.    [Sidenote: Singeing and Shearing]    If the cloth is to be printed for calicoes, before bleaching it is  singed by passing through gas flames or over a red hot plate and then  sheared in a shearing machine constructed somewhat on the principle of  the lawn mower, the cloth being run close to the rapidly revolving  knives.    Although cotton is usually dyed in the piece, it may be dyed in the form  of yarn, as for ginghams, and sometimes before being woven, in the loose  state.    [Sidenote: Mordant Colors]    Cotton is more difficult to dye than wool or silk. Although there are  now what are called \"direct\" cotton colors, the usual process is to  first treat the cotton goods with a \"mordant\"--various salts of  aluminum, chromium, iron, tin and copper, fixing these on the fiber by  means of tannin or alkali. The mordanted cloth is then entered into the  dye bath and boiled for an hour or longer, until the desired shade is  obtained or the dye bath exhausted. The salts of aluminum are used as  mordants for the lighter shades, the salts of chromium for the medium  shades, and iron for the dark shades. In general, chromium mordants give  the fastest dyes.    [Sidenote: Aniline Dyes]    The discovery of the so-called aniline dyes has greatly increased the  variety of colors available. Although some of the first aniline dyes to  be made were not fast to washing or to light and they thus received a  bad reputation, they are now to be obtained which compare favorably in  fastness with the natural dye stuffs such as cochineal, madder, etc.,  provided sufficient time and care are given to dyeing. The chief trouble  is that in the endeavor to furnish cheap goods, processes are hurried  and results are unsatisfactory.    [Sidenote: Home Dyeing]    Home dyeing is practically confined to the use of direct aniline colors.  These are put up in small quantities and sold in many places. Directions  for their use are given on the packages. The chief precautions are to  have the goods perfectly clean and thoroughly wet before entering into  the dye bath (this is by no means as easy as one might think), and to  keep the goods in motion while dyeing so as to prevent unevenness of  shade. Wool and silk dyes cannot be used for cotton and linen, nor the  reverse. Of course cloth already colored cannot be dyed a lighter shade  of the same color and the original shade must be very light to enable  one to change the color, say from red to blue, etc. The original color  always modifies that of the dye somewhat and it is best to experiment  first with a small portion of the dye and cloth. Rather dark shades are  apt to be most successful.    [Sidenote: Natural Dyestuffs]    Indigo for blue, madder for Turkey red, logwood with fustic for black,  cutch or gambia for browns on cotton are about all the natural dyestuffs  which are used to any extent commercially at the present time. The  artificial product alizerin, the active principle of madder, has about  superseded the natural dyestuff, and artificial indigo is gaining on the  natural product.    Linen is bleached and dyed in much the same manner as cotton, although  the process is more difficult. The process of bleaching weakens linen  more than cotton.    [Sidenote: Dyeing Woolen and Silk]    Woolen and silk may be dyed directly with a great variety of dyes  without the addition of a mordant, although they are often mordanted.  Both must be well washed or scoured before dyeing. When white or  delicate shades on woolen or silk are desired they are bleached. The  bleaching is usually done with sulphurous acid gas, the cloth or yarn  being exposed in a damp condition to the fumes of burning sulphur.    Were it not for the expense, hydrogen peroxide would be the ideal  bleaching agent for the animal fibers.      PRINTING    A great variety of colored designs are produced on the loom by using  different colored warp and filling yarns and different weaves, but in  all these the designs are easily made only in somewhat rectangular  patterns.    [Sidenote: Block and Machine Printing]    Print goods have doubtless evolved from the decoration of fabrics with  the brush. Block printing was first used, the design being engraved in  relief on blocks of wood. These are dipped in the colored paste, spread  thinly, and applied to successive portions of the cloth by hand. These  blocks are now replaced in the printing machine by engraved copper  rolls, the design being such that it is repeated once or a number of  times in each revolution of the cylinder. There is a printing roll for  each color of the design. Sometimes both the background and the design  are printed on the cloth, but the more common process is for the design  only to be printed on the cloth which may be dyed afterwards. In the  paste of the printed design there is some chemical which prevents the  portions printed from taking the dye, consequently these remain white or  a different color. This is called the \"resist\" process. Another process  is to first dye the cloth and then print on some chemical which, when  the calico is steamed, discharges the color. This is called the  \"discharge\" process. Sometimes this weakens the goods in the places  where the color has been discharged.    [Sidenote: Fixing the Print]    The color paste used for printing contains both the dye and the mordant.  After the calico has been printed it is steamed to develop and fix the  color, washed, sometimes very slightly bleached, to clear the whites,  and usually given a sizing of starch or gum, and then pressed and dried  by passing over slowly revolving, steam-heated drums.

Women are not abortive  men; they are a distinct creation. The eye and the ear, though both  belonging to the same body, are each, in a certain sense, a distinct  creation. A body endowed with four ears might hear remarkably well; but  without eyes it would be of little use in the world. A body with four  eyes would have a fourfold power of vision, and would consequently  become nearly as sharp-sighted as a spider; but without hearing its  powers of sight would avail little. In both cases, half the functions  of the human being, whether physical or mental, would be very  imperfectly performed. Thus it is with men and women; each has a  distinct position to fill in the great social body, and is especially  qualified for it. These distinct positions are each highly important.  And it is reasonable to believe that, by filling their own peculiar  position thoroughly well, women can best serve their Creator, their  fellow-creatures, and themselves. No doubt you may, if you choose, by  especial education from childhood upward, make your girls very  respectable politicians, as much so as the majority of your sons. But  in that case you must give up your womanly daughters--you must be  content with manly daughters. This essential difference between the  sexes is a very striking fact; yet the advocates of female suffrage  constantly lose sight of it; they talk and write as if it had no  existence. It is not lack of intellect on the part of women, but  difference of intellect, or rather a difference of organization and  affinities giving a different bias to the intellect, which is the cause  of their distinct mental character as a sex. And, owing to this  essential difference, the great majority of women are naturally  disinclined to politics, and partially unfitted for action in that  field.          FEMALE SUFFRAGE.    A LETTER TO THE CHRISTIAN WOMEN OF AMERICA.        Part II.    LET us now look for a moment at the actual condition of women in  America, in connection with the predicted elevation. We are told they  are to be elevated by the suffrage--and that by hanging on to the  election tickets in the hands of their wives, the men are to be  elevated with them. What, therefore, is the ground women now occupy,  and from whence they are to soar upward on the paper wings of the  ballot? The principal facts connected with that position are  self-evident; there is nothing vague or uncertain here; we have but to  look about us and the question is answered. We already know, for  instance, from daily observation and actual experience, that, as a  general rule, the kindness and consideration of American men have been  great, both in public and in private life. We know that in American  society women have been respected, they have been favored, they have  been protected, they have been beloved. There has been a readiness to  listen to their requests, to redress grievances, to make changes  whenever these have become necessary or advisable. Such, until very  recently, has been the general current of public feeling, the general  tendency of public action, in America. If there appear to-day  occasional symptoms of a change in the tone of men on this point, it is  to be attributed to the agitation of the very question we are now  discussing. Whenever women make ill-judged, unnatural, extravagant  demands, they must prepare to lose ground. Yes, even where the  particular points in dispute are conceded to their reiterated  importunity, they must still eventually lower their general standing  and consideration by every false step. There are occasions where  victory is more really perilous than a timely defeat; a temporary  triumph may lead to ground which the victors can not permanently hold  to their own true and lasting advantage. On the other hand, every just  and judicious demand women may now make with the certainty of  successful results. This is, indeed, the great fact which especially  contributes to render the birthright of American women a favorable one.  If the men of the country are already disposed to redress existing  grievances, where women are concerned, as we know them to be, and if  they are also ready, as we know them to be, to forward all needful  future development of true womanly action, what more, pray, can we  reasonably ask of them? Where lies this dim necessity of thrusting upon  women the burdens of the suffrage? And why should the entire nation be  thrown into the perilous convulsions of a revolution more truly  formidable than any yet attempted on earth? Bear in mind that this is a  revolution which, if successful in all its aims, can scarcely fail to  sunder the family roof-tree, and to uproot the family hearth-stone. It  is the avowed determination of many of its champions that it shall do  so; while with another class of its leaders, to weaken and undermine  the authority of the Christian faith in the household is an object if  not frankly avowed yet scarcely concealed. The great majority of the  women enlisted in this movement--many of them, it is needless to say,  very worthy persons as individuals--are little aware of all the perils  into which some of their most zealous male allies would lead them.  Degradation for the sex, and not true and lasting elevation, appear to  most of us likely to be the end to which this movement must necessarily  tend, unless it be checked by the latent good sense, the true wisdom,  and the religious principle of women themselves, aroused, at length, to  protest, to resist. If we are called upon for proof of the assertion,  that American men are already prepared to redress actual grievances, we  find that proof in their course at the present moment. Observe the  patience with which our legislative bodies are now considering the  petitions of a clamorous minority demanding the redress of a fictitious  grievance--a minority demanding a political position which the majority  of their sex still utterly reject--a position repugnant to the habits,  the feelings, the tastes, and the principles of that majority. If men  are willing to give their attention to these querulous demands of a  small minority of our sex, how much more surely may we rely on their  sympathy, and their efficient support, when some measure in which the  interests of the whole sex are clearly involved shall be brought before  them by all their wives and mothers?    And again: they are not only already prepared to redress grievances,  but also to forward all needed development of true womanly action.  Take, in proof of this, assertion, the subject of education. This is,  beyond all doubt the vital question of the age, embracing within its  limits all others. Education is of far more importance than the  suffrage, which is eventually subject to it, controlled by it. This is,  indeed, a question altogether too grave, too comprehensive, and too  complicated in some of its bearings to be more than briefly alluded to  here. But let us consider education for a moment as the mere  acquirement of intellectual knowledge. This is but one of its phases,  and that one not the most important; but such is the popular, though  very inadequate, idea of the subject in America. Observe how much has  already been done in this sense for the instruction of the woman of our  country. In the common district schools, and even in the high schools  of the larger towns, the same facilities are generally offered to both  sexes; in the public schools brother and sister have, as a rule, the  same books and the same teachers. And we may go much further and say  that every woman in the country may already--IF SHE IS DETERMINED TO DO  SO--obtain very much the same intellectual instruction which her own  brother receives. If that education is a highly advanced one she will,  no doubt, have some special difficulties to contend against; but those  difficulties are not insurmountable. The doors of most colleges and  universities are closed, it is true, against women, and we can not  doubt that this course is taken for sound reasons, pointed out by good  sense and true sagacity. It is impossible not to believe that between  the ages of fifteen and five-and-twenty young men and young women will  carry on their intellectual training far more thoroughly and  successfully apart than thrown into the same classes. At that age of  vivid impressions and awakening passions, the two sexes are  sufficiently thrown together in family life and in general society for  all purposes of mutual influence and improvement. Let them chat, walk,  sing, dance together, at that period of their lives; but if you wish to  make them good scholars, let them study apart. Let their loves and  jealousies be carried on elsewhere than in the college halls. But  already female colleges, exclusively adapted to young women, are talked  of--nay, here and there one or two such colleges now exist. There is  nothing in which American men more delight, nothing more congenial to  their usual modes of thought and action, than to advance the  intellectual instruction of the whole nation, daughters as well as  sons. We may rest assured that they will not fail to grant all needful  development in this direction. One female college, of the very highest  intellectual standard, would probably be found sufficient for a  population of some millions. The number of women desiring a full  college education will always, for many different reasons, be much  smaller than the number of male students. But there is no good reason  why such colleges, when found desirable, should not enter into our  future American civilization. Individual American women may yet, by  these means, make high progress in science, and render good service to  the country and the race. Every branch of study which may be carried on  thoroughly and successfully, without impairing womanly modesty of mind  and manner, should be so far opened to the sex as to allow those  individuals to whom Providence has"]]]
