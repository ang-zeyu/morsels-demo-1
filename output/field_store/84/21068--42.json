[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20470"],[0,"Etiquette (#6)"],[1,"broken to give distinction  to the several ideas, and the wording made as terse as possible.  The  formula is nearly unvarying:                    MR. AND MRS. GEORGE LATHROP              request the pleasure of your company                (or the honor of your presence)               at the marriage of their daughter,                        MARY ADELAIDE,                              to                   MR. WILLIAM HENRY BISHOP,                    at St. Philip's Church,    On Wednesday evening, October twelfth, at seven o'clock.      If the marriage is to be solemnized at home the date follows the names  in succession, and the place of residence is given last.  The  invitation may vary, \"the wedding reception of their daughter,\" etc.  Or, accompanying the church wedding invitation may be a square card  bearing the lines: \"Reception from half-past seven until nine o'clock,\"  with place of residence on the line below.    Also, to avoid a crowd at the church, a smaller card is sometimes sent  with the invitations bearing, for example, the words: \"Please present  this card at St. Philip's Church, Wednesday evening, October twelfth,  at seven o'clock.\"  This card of admission is also given to  dependents--the domestics of the family or such persons as may be  entitled to the kind notice, but who are not, strictly speaking,  invited guests.  The number of such cards should never be greater than  the comfortable capacity of the church, lest their original purpose be  defeated.    In case the ceremony is private the immediate family and chosen friends  are invited verbally.  It is then optional whether or not a formal  announcement shall be made to a wider circle of friends by sending out  engraved cards the day after the ceremony.  These are, like the  invitations, printed on note sheets, and are phrased briefly, as            MR. AND MRS. GEORGE LATHROP    announce the marriage of their daughter,               MARY ADELAIDE,                     to           MR. WILLIAM HENRY BISHOP,      Wednesday evening, October twelfth,             St. Philip's Church.      \"At Home\" cards sometimes accompany this announcement, or they may be  sent out later by the young couple themselves, if a long wedding trip  intervenes.    The private wedding and after announcement is often the most  suitable--in fact, the only appropriate method to adopt when a bride is  comparatively alone in the world, or has no near relatives to take  charge of wedding formalities.  In such a case the announcement is  worded: \"Mr. William Henry Bishop and Miss Mary Adelaide Lathrop,  married, Wednesday, October twelfth, 149 Willow St.\"  If no other place  is given this is understood to be the place where to address cards of  congratulation.  If the young couple are to receive later, in a new  home, that address, with date of the \"at home,\" is also given, thus,  \"At home, after November fifteenth, 1129 Lake St.\"  If the change of  residence is to another town, the name of the town is also given.    For the proper style of \"displaying\" the phrases of an invitation or  announcement one may apply to a first-class stationer.  Plain script  and the finest white paper are always correct.  Any show of  ornamentation is out of taste.    When the circle of acquaintances is very large and invitations must be  limited to a certain number, the announcement cards may be sent to  others.    A wedding invitation, unless it includes a wedding breakfast, limited  in number, requires no reply.  Cards sent afterward are all that is  necessary.  These cards, and whatever congratulations are sent, are  addressed to the ones in whose name the invitation or announcement was  sent out--usually the parents of the bride.  A congratulatory note to  the bride is always in order among intimate friends, _but this bears no  relation to a response to the invitation_.      WEDDING ANNIVERSARY INVITATIONS are simply, \"Mr. and Mrs. George  Lathrop, at home,\" etc., with date and residence.  They are printed on  cards or note sheets, preferably the latter, and the character of the  occasion is indicated by a monogram at the top of the page, in the  centre, flanked by the two annual dates, as \"1837 [monogram] 1887.\"  If  for a golden wedding this heading is lettered in gold; if for a silver  wedding, in silver, the invitation being, as usual, printed in black  ink.  It is good form to engrave \"No presents\" in the lower left  corner, if such is the wish of \"the bride and groom.\"      DINNER CARDS OF INVITATION may have this form:           MR. AND MRS. GEORGE LATHROP             request the pleasure    Of ....................................        company at dinner on Thursday,      ................ at seven o'clock.               95 Willow Street.      The above form may be engraved for perennial use by a host or hostess  who frequently give dinners, and always on the same day of the week.  Blanks are left to be filled in with the name of the invited guest and  the exact date.  Or for a single occasion the form may be without any  blank spaces, and the phrasing read, \"Request the pleasure of your  company.\"    A dinner given in honor of some distinguished guest requires an  invitation card specially engraved.  This form is most deferential:                   To meet            GENERAL LA FAYETTE,        MR. AND MRS. GEORGE LATHROP            request the honor    of ........................ company                 at dinner          on Wednesday, May tenth,              at eight o'clock.              95 Willow Street.      If the honored guest is esteemed on the score of personal friendship  rather than public distinction his name will be given last, instead of  first, on the card, the phrasing of the invitation remaining the same.    Invitations to dinner should be answered at once, and no one should  accept if there is the least doubt about being able to be present.  Only the most serious detentions suddenly arising will excuse a failure  to keep a dinner engagement once made.  If such contingency does occur  at the eleventh hour an explanation and apology should be sent to the  host or hostess without delay in order to give opportunity for securing  \"the fourteenth man.\"      FOR A FORMAL LUNCHEON OR BREAKFAST the invitation cards are similar in  form to dinner cards.  But since the manner of serving, the numbers  invited, etc., are not so definitely fixed it is proper to add R.S.V.P.  on cards that especially call for a reply in the judgment of the  hostess.  Otherwise many people with vague ideas of the \"informality\"  of these occasions might omit to send replies.          THE CONDUCT OF A CHURCH WEDDING    The sexton should be duly informed what preparations to make at the  church; the awning at the entrance, the ribbon barrier across the  aisle, the floral decorations, etc., by whomever arranged and executed  are under the supervision of this functionary, who is responsible for  having everything in order.    It is no longer good form for a bride to be late at her own wedding.  Now, when the invitation says \"seven o'clock\" it is expected that the  ceremony will begin at that hour precisely, accidents aside.    The organist is engaged by some one interested in making the  arrangements, and is supposed to be in his place for a half-hour or so  before the hour of the ceremony; and while the guests are assembling he  discourses music appropriate to the occasion--a rambling, meditative  _pot-pourri_ of sweet and pathetic sentimental songs being a popular  and effective choice.  In churches having a vested choir it is possible  to secure very beautiful effects in the musical adjuncts, the  processional adding greatly to the grace and dignity of the ceremonial.    The sexton, or his deputy, stands at the door, salver in hand, to  receive the admission cards as people enter the church.  The invited  guests are met at the foot of the centre aisle by the ushers.  An usher  offers his arm to a lady and conducts her to a seat, the friends of the  bride being seated at the left and the friends of the groom at the  right of the middle aisle.  When, as often happens, the groom is \"from  a distance,\" and few of his far-away acquaintances can be present, this  separation of guests is not observed.    At the appointed hour, the clergyman appears at the altar rail; the  groom, accompanied by his best man, emerges from the vestry, and takes  his place at the right, awaiting the arrival of the bride.  At this  instant, the organist stops dreaming, wakes up, and starts boldly into  the wedding march, as the bridal party move up the aisle, in the  following order: First, the ushers, in pairs, then the bridesmaids,  also in pairs.  Sometimes a little \"maid of honor,\" carrying flowers,  precedes the bride.  The bride, leaning on the arm of her father, comes  last.  The ushers and the bridesmaids separate as they reach the altar,  and go to the right and to the left.  At the altar the groom receives  the bride from her father's hand.  The latter steps back a few paces,  but remains near enough to \"give away the bride.\"  When this point in  the ceremony has been passed, the father quietly joins the mother in  the front pew.    If the processional has been the \"Lohengrin\" march, it is thought by  many to be very effective for the organist, all through the ceremony,  to continue on the swell organ a dreamy _sotto voce_ improvisation, in  the course of which a varied reiteration of \"Faithful and true\" serves  as an affecting expression of the sentiment of the hour.  The most  enjoyable tears are shed by the emotional under this inspiration.  But  other people prefer the solemn stillness, broken only by the voice of  the priest and the responses of the high contracting parties.  It is a  matter of taste and feeling; and those interested are at liberty to  indulge either fancy.    The bride stands at the left of the groom during the ceremony; and also  takes his left arm at the close.  When the ceremony is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20472"],[0,"Grace Harlowe's Plebe Year at High School (#6)"],[1," departed for  town by another road. Seeing that escape was impossible, since, if some  got away, others would be caught--and no girl was willing to desert her  friends--the frightened plebes paused again and clustered about their  leader.    \"What do you want?\" asked Grace of one of the men.    \"First your money, then your jewelry,\" answered the tramp, insolently  leering at her.    \"But suppose we haven't any money or jewelry,\" replied Grace.    \"So much the worse for you, then,\" answered the tramp in a threatening  tone.    \"He can have this gold bracelet,\" exclaimed Jessica, slipping the band  from her arm.    But Grace was not listening. Her attention was absorbed by a group of  people passing in a straggling line on the road. Lifting up her voice  she gave the High School yell, which had been familiar to every High  School boy and girl for the last twenty years:    \"Hi-hi-hi; hi-hi-hi; Oakdale, Oakdale, HIGH SCHOOL!\"    As she expected, the call was answered immediately, and some of the  loiterers along the highway vaulted the fence at one bound.    \"Help!\" cried all the girls in chorus. \"Help! Help!\"    \"It's some of the High School boys!\" exclaimed Nora, in a relieved voice  as the rescuers came bounding through the orchard.    The tramps looked irresolute for a moment, but when they saw that the  newcomers were five boys they held their ground.    \"What do you want?\" said the tallest boy, with a flaming head of red  hair, as he confronted one of the tramps.    \"Thank heaven it's Reddy Brooks, pitcher on the sophomore baseball  team!\" whispered Grace, unable to conceal her joy.    \"Is that any of your business, young man?\" demanded the tramp, showing  his teeth like an angry dog.    \"It's my business to protect these young ladies,\" answered Reddy Brooks,  \"and I'll do it if I have to shed somebody's blood in the attempt.\"    \"Ho, ho, ho!\" laughed the big tramp, clapping his hands to his sides and  almost dancing a jig in his amusement.    In the meantime Reddy had cast his eyes about for some kind of a weapon.  There was not a stick nor stone in sight. The only thing he could find  was a pile of winter apples that had evidently been collected by the  owner of the orchard to be barreled next day.    Reddy made a rush for the pile, to the amazement of his fellow-students,  who imagined for a moment that he was running away. They soon found out  his purpose, however, when the apples came whizzing through the air with  well-aimed precision.    The first one hit the biggest tramp squarely on the chin and almost  stunned him. Each boy then chose his man and the five ruffians were soon  running across the orchard to the wood, the boys after them, their  pockets bulging with apples. Laughing and yelling like wild Indians,  they pelted their victims until the men disappeared in the forest.    The girls, who had forgotten their fright in the excitement of the  chase, were laughing, too, and urging on the attacks exactly as they  would have done at one of the college football games. Perhaps they had  had a narrow escape, but it was great fun, now, especially when Reddy  Brooks threw one of his famous curved balls and hit a tramp plump on the  back of the head.    \"Oh,\" cried Nora, wiping tears of laughter from her eyes, \"I never had  such a good time in all my life! Wasn't it great?\"    \"Wasn't it though?\" grinned Reddy, as the boys returned from the field  of victory. \"Lots more fun than throwing balls at dummies at the county  fair, wasn't it, fellows?\"    \"You girls ought to be careful how you walk out here alone at this time  of the year,\" said Jimmie Burke. \"There are a great many tramps around  now, going south in bunches to spend the winter in Palm Beach, no  doubt.\"    \"We'll never do it again,\" answered Grace.    \"Never again!\" exclaimed Nora, raising her right hand to heaven.    \"I suppose Farmer Smithson will wonder what became of his apples,\"  observed Reddy.    \"Oh, well, he has so many acres of orchards, I don't suppose he'll miss  this one little pile.\"    And the crowd started gayly off to town.    But the girls of the freshman class had not forgotten--or forgiven--the  Black Monks of Asia.    All along the walk Grace was turning over and over in her mind some  scheme of revenge. Nothing seemed feasible, however. The sophomores were  so well up in tricks that it would be difficult to deceive them.    \"Suppose,\" Grace proposed suddenly, aloud, \"we ask David Nesbit's advice  to-morrow night, when we go to the flying machine exhibition.\"    After that she dismissed the subject from her mind for the time being.          CHAPTER V    ANNE HAS A SECRET      On the night of the flying machine exhibition, the four chums, for Anne  had now been formally adopted by Grace and her friends, arrived somewhat  early at the great arched doorway leading into the gymnasium.    They were all somewhat excited over this new experience. There had been  many balloon ascensions at the State Fair, and once a dirigible airship  had sailed over the town of Oakdale. But to see a real flying machine  with all its grace and elegance and lightness was like stepping onto  another planet where progress had advanced much faster than it had on  this.    At least, so thought Anne as she followed her friends into the building.  There was a sound of puffing and churning, during which David arrived in  a cloud of smoke on his motor cycle.    \"I mean to learn to ride one of those queer machines,\" exclaimed Grace  from the doorway, never dreaming what an important part that very  machine was one day to play in the history of Oakdale.    \"All right, you're welcome to,\" replied David, jumping off as he stopped  the motor. \"Come over to the campus to-morrow afternoon, and I'll give  you your first lesson.\"    \"Is that really an invitation?\" asked Grace. \"For I shall accept it, if  it is.\"    \"It certainly is,\" answered the young man, \"and I shall expect you to  make a very excellent prize pupil, not like Reddy Brooks, who tumbled  off and smashed his nose because he suddenly forgot how to manage the  brakes.\"    A few other people gathered in the roomy gymnasium to see the  exhibition, but the girls could see that it was a very exclusive company  they had been invited to join. There were, in fact, no other girls,  except Miriam Nesbit, who came late with her mother, a handsome, quiet  woman to whom her son David bore a marked resemblance.    Grace and her friends spoke to Mrs. Nesbit cordially, while Miriam bowed  coldly and confined all her attentions to Miss Leece, the unpopular  teacher of mathematics. Miriam ignored Anne entirely.    \"And now, ladies, if you will all be seated, the show will begin,\"  announced David, leading them to the spectators' benches ranged against  the wall. \"Don't expect anything wonderful of mine,\" he added. \"It's  only in the first stages so far. I'm afraid she'll break down, but she's  a great little machine, just the same. Isn't she, mother?\"    \"She is wonderful, I think, David,\" replied Mrs. Nesbit, who was a very  shy, quiet woman, almost entirely wrapped up in her only son. Miriam had  always been too much for her, and she had long since given up attempting  to rule or direct her brilliant, willful daughter.    \"Mrs. Nesbit,\" said Grace, \"this is Anne Pierson, one of the brightest  girls in the freshman class.\"    \"How do you do?\" said Mrs. Nesbit cordially, giving the girl her hand.  \"You are a newcomer, are you not? I haven't heard Miriam speak of you.\"    \"She is a newcomer, mother, but I hear she's giving your daughter Miriam  a stiff pull for first place,\" said David teasingly.    \"I wish you'd keep quiet, David,\" exclaimed his sister angrily. \"You  always talk too much.\"    \"Miriam!\" remonstrated her mother.    \"Miss Nesbit,\" said Miss Leece in a disagreeable, harsh voice, \"will  have no trouble, I think, in holding her own.\"    The teacher gave Anne such a glare from her pale blue eyes that the poor  child shrank behind Grace in embarrassment.    \"Dear, dear,\" murmured Mrs. Nesbit helplessly. She disliked exceedingly  the scenes to which her daughter often subjected the family.    David only laughed good-naturedly.    \"The exhibition is about to begin,\" he said, and disappeared into the  room where the ships were to be put through their performances.    In a few moments six young airship builders appeared, each carrying in  his arms the result of his summer's labors. There was vigorous applause  from everybody except Miriam, who was too angry with her brother to  enjoy the spectacle.    The aeroplanes were all copies of well-known models, except David's,  which was of an entirely new and original design of his own invention.  It looked something like a flying fish, the girls thought, with its  slender, oblong body, gauzy fins at the sides and a funny little forked  tail at the stern.    The models were too light for machinery, so rubber bands, secured  cris-cross in the bows, when suddenly released with a snap gave the  little ships the impetus they needed to fly the length of the gymnasium.    Only four of the six, however, were destined to fly that evening. They  soared straight down the big room, as easily and gracefully as great  white birds, and dropped gently when they hit the curtain at the other  end, their builders running after them as eagerly as boys sailing kites.  One of the models fluttered and settled down before it reached the other  side, and David's machine, which had commanded most attention because it  was different, started out bravely enough, its little propeller making a  busy humming as it skimmed along. But it had gone hardly ten yards  before it collapsed and ignominiously crashed to the floor.    \"I'm glad of it,\" said Miriam above the din, for everyone had gathered  about the young man to offer sympathy and congratulations at the same  time.    \"It's very, very clever, my boy,\" said Professor Blitz, \"and you'll  succeed yet, if you keep at it.\"    \"She wouldn't go far,"]]]
