To know  that my work must be lost made me intolerably wretched. I believed  in prayer, and to make my appeals pure and strong, like you,  my brethren, I went out of the beaten ways, I went where man  had not been, where only God was. Above the fifth cataract,  above the meeting of rivers in Sennar, up the Bahr el Abiad,  into the far unknown of Africa, I went. There, in the morning,  a mountain blue as the sky flings a cooling shadow wide over the  western desert, and, with its cascades of melted snow, feeds a  broad lake nestling at its base on the east. The lake is the  mother of the great river. For a year and more the mountain gave  me a home. The fruit of the palm fed my body, prayer my spirit.  One night I walked in the orchard close by the little sea. 'The world  is dying. When wilt thou come? Why may I not see the redemption,  O God?' So I prayed. The glassy water was sparkling with stars.  One of them seemed to leave its place, and rise to the surface,  where it became a brilliancy burning to the eyes. Then it moved  towards me, and stood over my head, apparently in hand's reach.  I fell down and hid my face. A voice, not of the earth, said,  'Thy good works have conquered. Blessed art thou, O son of Mizraim!  The redemption cometh. With two others, from the remotenesses of  the world, thou shalt see the Saviour, and testify for him. In the  morning arise, and go meet them. And when ye have all come to the  holy city of Jerusalem, ask of the people, Where is he that is born  King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the East and are  sent to worship him. Put all thy trust in the Spirit which will  guide thee.'    \"And the light became an inward illumination not to be doubted,  and has stayed with me, a governor and a guide. It led me down the  river to Memphis, where I made ready for the desert. I bought my  camel, and came hither without rest, by way of Suez and Kufileh,  and up through the lands of Moab and Ammon. God is with us, O my  brethren!\"    He paused, and thereupon, with a prompting not their own, they all  arose, and looked at each other.    \"I said there was a purpose in the particularity with which we  described our people and their histories,\" so the Egyptian  proceeded. \"He we go to find was called 'King of the Jews;'  by that name we are bidden to ask for him. But, now that we  have met, and heard from each other, we may know him to be  the Redeemer, not of the Jews alone, but of all the nations  of the earth. The patriarch who survived the Flood had with him  three sons, and their families, by whom the world was repeopled.  From the old Aryana-Vaejo, the well-remembered Region of Delight in  the heart of Asia, they parted. India and the far East received the  children of the first; the descendant of the youngest, through the  North, streamed into Europe; those of the second overflowed the  deserts about the Red Sea, passing into Africa; and though most  of the latter are yet dwellers in shifting tents, some of them  became builders along the Nile.\"    By a simultaneous impulse the three joined hands.    \"Could anything be more divinely ordered?\" Balthasar continued.  \"When we have found the Lord, the brothers, and all the generations  that have succeeded them, will kneel to him in homage with us. And  when we part to go our separate ways, the world will have learned  a new lesson--that Heaven may be won, not by the sword, not by  human wisdom, but by Faith, Love, and Good Works.\"    There was silence, broken by sighs and sanctified with tears;  for the joy that filled them might not be stayed. It was the  unspeakable joy of souls on the shores of the River of Life,  resting with the Redeemed in God's presence.    Presently their hands fell apart, and together they went out of  the tent. The desert was still as the sky. The sun was sinking  fast. The camels slept.    A little while after, the tent was struck, and, with the remains of  the repast, restored to the cot; then the friends mounted, and set  out single file, led by the Egyptian. Their course was due west,  into the chilly night. The camels swung forward in steady trot,  keeping the line and the intervals so exactly that those following  seemed to tread in the tracks of the leader. The riders spoke not  once.    By-and-by the moon came up. And as the three tall white figures sped,  with soundless tread, through the opalescent light, they appeared like  specters flying from hateful shadows. Suddenly, in the air before  them, not farther up than a low hill-top flared a lambent flame;  as they looked at it, the apparition contracted into a focus of  dazzling lustre. Their hearts beat fast; their souls thrilled;  and they shouted as with one voice, \"The Star! the Star! God is  with us!\"          CHAPTER VI      In an aperture of the western wall of Jerusalem hang the \"oaken  valves\" called the Bethlehem or Joppa Gate. The area outside of  them is one of the notable places of the city. Long before David  coveted Zion there was a citadel there. When at last the son of  Jesse ousted the Jebusite, and began to build, the site of the  citadel became the northwest corner of the new wall, defended by  a tower much more imposing than the old one. The location of the  gate, however, was not disturbed, for the reasons, most likely,  that the roads which met and merged in front of it could not  well be transferred to any other point, while the area outside  had become a recognized market-place. In Solomon's day there was  great traffic at the locality, shared in by traders from Egypt  and the rich dealers from Tyre and Sidon. Nearly three thousand  years have passed, and yet a kind of commerce clings to the spot.  A pilgrim wanting a pin or a pistol, a cucumber or a camel, a house  or a horse, a loan or a lentil, a date or a dragoman, a melon or  a man, a dove or a donkey, has only to inquire for the article at  the Joppa Gate. Sometimes the scene is quite animated, and then  it suggests, What a place the old market must have been in the  days of Herod the Builder! And to that period and that market  the reader is now to be transferred.    Following the Hebrew system, the meeting of the wise men described  in the preceding chapters took place in the afternoon of the  twenty-fifth day of the third month of the year; that is say,  on the twenty-fifth day of December. The year was the second of  the 193d Olympiad, or the 747th of Rome; the sixty-seventh of  Herod the Great, and the thirty-fifth of his reign; the fourth  before the beginning of the Christian era. The hours of the day,  by Judean custom, begin with the sun, the first hour being the  first after sunrise; so, to be precise; the market at the Joppa  Gate during the first hour of the day stated was in full session,  and very lively. The massive valves had been wide open since dawn.  Business, always aggressive, had pushed through the arched entrance  into a narrow lane and court, which, passing by the walls of  the great tower, conducted on into the city. As Jerusalem is  in the hill country, the morning air on this occasion was not a  little crisp. The rays of the sun, with their promise of warmth,  lingered provokingly far up on the battlements and turrets of the  great piles about, down from which fell the crooning of pigeons  and the whir of the flocks coming and going.    As a passing acquaintance with the people of the Holy City, strangers  as well as residents, will be necessary to an understanding of some  of the pages which follow, it will be well to stop at the gate and  pass the scene in review. Better opportunity will not offer to get  sight of the populace who will afterwhile go forward in a mood very  different from that which now possesses them.    The scene is at first one of utter confusion--confusion of action,  sounds, colors, and things. It is especially so in the lane and court.  The ground there is paved with broad unshaped flags, from which each  cry and jar and hoof-stamp arises to swell the medley that rings  and roars up between the solid impending walls. A little mixing  with the throng, however, a little familiarity with the business  going on, will make analysis possible.    Here stands a donkey, dozing under panniers full of lentils,  beans, onions, and cucumbers, brought fresh from the gardens  and terraces of Galilee. When not engaged in serving customers,  the master, in a voice which only the initiated can understand,  cries his stock. Nothing can be simpler than his costume--sandals,  and an unbleached, undyed blanket, crossed over one shoulder  and girt round the waist. Near-by, and far more imposing and  grotesque, though scarcely as patient as the donkey, kneels a  camel, raw-boned, rough, and gray, with long shaggy tufts of  fox-colored hair under its throat, neck, and body, and a load  of boxes and baskets curiously arranged upon an enormous saddle.  The owner is an Egyptian, small, lithe, and of a complexion which  has borrowed a good deal from the dust of the roads and the  sands of the desert. He wears a faded tarbooshe, a loose gown,  sleeveless, unbelted, and dropping from the neck to the knee.  His feet are bare. The camel, restless under the load, groans and  occasionally shows his teeth; but the man paces indifferently to  and fro, holding the driving-strap, and all the time advertising  his fruits fresh from the orchards of the Kedron--grapes, dates,  figs, apples, and pomegranates.    At the corner where the lane opens out into the court, some women  sit with their backs against the gray stones of the wall. Their dress  is that common to the humbler classes of the country--a linen  frock extending the full length of the person, loosely gathered  at the waist, and a veil or wimple broad enough, after covering  the head, to wrap the shoulders. Their merchandise is contained  in a number of earthen jars, such as are still used in the East for  bringing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/215"],[0,"The Call of the Wild (#6)"],[1,"thirty-five miles to the Big Salmon; the next day thirty-five more to  the Little Salmon; the third day forty miles, which brought them well up  toward the Five Fingers.    Buck's feet were not so compact and hard as the feet of the huskies.  His had softened during the many generations since the day his last  wild ancestor was tamed by a cave-dweller or river man. All day long he  limped in agony, and camp once made, lay down like a dead dog. Hungry as  he was, he would not move to receive his ration of fish, which Francois  had to bring to him. Also, the dog-driver rubbed Buck's feet for half  an hour each night after supper, and sacrificed the tops of his own  moccasins to make four moccasins for Buck. This was a great relief, and  Buck caused even the weazened face of Perrault to twist itself into a  grin one morning, when Francois forgot the moccasins and Buck lay on his  back, his four feet waving appealingly in the air, and refused to budge  without them. Later his feet grew hard to the trail, and the worn-out  foot-gear was thrown away.    At the Pelly one morning, as they were harnessing up, Dolly, who had  never been conspicuous for anything, went suddenly mad. She announced  her condition by a long, heartbreaking wolf howl that sent every dog  bristling with fear, then sprang straight for Buck. He had never seen a  dog go mad, nor did he have any reason to fear madness; yet he knew  that here was horror, and fled away from it in a panic. Straight away he  raced, with Dolly, panting and frothing, one leap behind; nor could she  gain on him, so great was his terror, nor could he leave her, so great  was her madness. He plunged through the wooded breast of the island,  flew down to the lower end, crossed a back channel filled with rough ice  to another island, gained a third island, curved back to the main river,  and in desperation started to cross it. And all the time, though he  did not look, he could hear her snarling just one leap behind. Francois  called to him a quarter of a mile away and he doubled back, still one  leap ahead, gasping painfully for air and putting all his faith in that  Francois would save him. The dog-driver held the axe poised in his hand,  and as Buck shot past him the axe crashed down upon mad Dolly's head.    Buck staggered over against the sled, exhausted, sobbing for breath,  helpless. This was Spitz's opportunity. He sprang upon Buck, and twice  his teeth sank into his unresisting foe and ripped and tore the flesh to  the bone. Then Francois's lash descended, and Buck had the satisfaction  of watching Spitz receive the worst whipping as yet administered to any  of the teams.    \"One devil, dat Spitz,\" remarked Perrault. \"Some dam day heem keel dat  Buck.\"    \"Dat Buck two devils,\" was Francois's rejoinder. \"All de tam I watch dat  Buck I know for sure. Lissen: some dam fine day heem get mad lak hell  an' den heem chew dat Spitz all up an' spit heem out on de snow. Sure. I  know.\"    From then on it was war between them. Spitz, as lead-dog and  acknowledged master of the team, felt his supremacy threatened by this  strange Southland dog. And strange Buck was to him, for of the many  Southland dogs he had known, not one had shown up worthily in camp and  on trail. They were all too soft, dying under the toil, the frost, and  starvation. Buck was the exception. He alone endured and prospered,  matching the husky in strength, savagery, and cunning. Then he was a  masterful dog, and what made him dangerous was the fact that the club of  the man in the red sweater had knocked all blind pluck and rashness out  of his desire for mastery. He was preeminently cunning, and could bide  his time with a patience that was nothing less than primitive.    It was inevitable that the clash for leadership should come. Buck wanted  it. He wanted it because it was his nature, because he had been  gripped tight by that nameless, incomprehensible pride of the trail and  trace--that pride which holds dogs in the toil to the last gasp, which  lures them to die joyfully in the harness, and breaks their hearts  if they are cut out of the harness. This was the pride of Dave as  wheel-dog, of Sol-leks as he pulled with all his strength; the pride  that laid hold of them at break of camp, transforming them from sour and  sullen brutes into straining, eager, ambitious creatures; the pride  that spurred them on all day and dropped them at pitch of camp at night,  letting them fall back into gloomy unrest and uncontent. This was the  pride that bore up Spitz and made him thrash the sled-dogs who blundered  and shirked in the traces or hid away at harness-up time in the morning.  Likewise it was this pride that made him fear Buck as a possible  lead-dog. And this was Buck's pride, too.    He openly threatened the other's leadership. He came between him and the  shirks he should have punished. And he did it deliberately. One night  there was a heavy snowfall, and in the morning Pike, the malingerer,  did not appear. He was securely hidden in his nest under a foot of snow.  Francois called him and sought him in vain. Spitz was wild with wrath.  He raged through the camp, smelling and digging in every likely  place, snarling so frightfully that Pike heard and shivered in his  hiding-place.    But when he was at last unearthed, and Spitz flew at him to punish him,  Buck flew, with equal rage, in between. So unexpected was it, and so  shrewdly managed, that Spitz was hurled backward and off his feet. Pike,  who had been trembling abjectly, took heart at this open mutiny,  and sprang upon his overthrown leader. Buck, to whom fair play was a  forgotten code, likewise sprang upon Spitz. But Francois, chuckling at  the incident while unswerving in the administration of justice, brought  his lash down upon Buck with all his might. This failed to drive Buck  from his prostrate rival, and the butt of the whip was brought into  play. Half-stunned by the blow, Buck was knocked backward and the lash  laid upon him again and again, while Spitz soundly punished the many  times offending Pike.    In the days that followed, as Dawson grew closer and closer, Buck still  continued to interfere between Spitz and the culprits; but he did it  craftily, when Francois was not around, With the covert mutiny of Buck,  a general insubordination sprang up and increased. Dave and Sol-leks  were unaffected, but the rest of the team went from bad to worse.  Things no longer went right. There was continual bickering and jangling.  Trouble was always afoot, and at the bottom of it was Buck. He kept  Francois busy, for the dog-driver was in constant apprehension of the  life-and-death struggle between the two which he knew must take place  sooner or later; and on more than one night the sounds of quarrelling  and strife among the other dogs turned him out of his sleeping robe,  fearful that Buck and Spitz were at it.    But the opportunity did not present itself, and they pulled into Dawson  one dreary afternoon with the great fight still to come. Here were many  men, and countless dogs, and Buck found them all at work. It seemed the  ordained order of things that dogs should work. All day they swung up  and down the main street in long teams, and in the night their jingling  bells still went by. They hauled cabin logs and firewood, freighted up  to the mines, and did all manner of work that horses did in the Santa  Clara Valley. Here and there Buck met Southland dogs, but in the main  they were the wild wolf husky breed. Every night, regularly, at nine, at  twelve, at three, they lifted a nocturnal song, a weird and eerie chant,  in which it was Buck's delight to join.    With the aurora borealis flaming coldly overhead, or the stars leaping  in the frost dance, and the land numb and frozen under its pall of snow,  this song of the huskies might have been the defiance of life, only it  was pitched in minor key, with long-drawn wailings and half-sobs, and  was more the pleading of life, the articulate travail of existence. It  was an old song, old as the breed itself--one of the first songs of the  younger world in a day when songs were sad. It was invested with the woe  of unnumbered generations, this plaint by which Buck was so strangely  stirred. When he moaned and sobbed, it was with the pain of living that  was of old the pain of his wild fathers, and the fear and mystery of the  cold and dark that was to them fear and mystery. And that he should be  stirred by it marked the completeness with which he harked back through  the ages of fire and roof to the raw beginnings of life in the howling  ages.    Seven days from the time they pulled into Dawson, they dropped down the  steep bank by the Barracks to the Yukon Trail, and pulled for Dyea and  Salt Water. Perrault was carrying despatches if anything more urgent  than those he had brought in; also, the travel pride had gripped him,  and he purposed to make the record trip of the year. Several things  favored him in this. The week's rest had recuperated the dogs and put  them in thorough trim. The trail they had broken into the country was  packed hard by later journeyers. And further, the police had arranged  in two or three places deposits of grub for dog and man, and he was  travelling light.    They made Sixty Mile, which is a fifty-mile run, on the first day; and  the second day saw them booming up the Yukon well on their way to Pelly.  But such splendid running was achieved not without great trouble and  vexation on the part of Francois. The insidious revolt led by Buck  had destroyed the solidarity of the team. It no longer was as one dog  leaping in the traces. The encouragement Buck gave the rebels led them  into all kinds of petty misdemeanors. No more was Spitz a leader greatly  to be feared. The old awe departed, and they grew equal to challenging  his authority. Pike robbed him of half a fish one night, and gulped  it down under the protection of Buck. Another night"]]]
