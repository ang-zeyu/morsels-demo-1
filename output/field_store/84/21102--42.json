The first Prior after this alteration was Vincent, and there followed  in succession thirty-six others, the last of whom, Robert Wells  otherwise Steward, surrendered the monastery, with its goods and  possessions, into the hands of King Henry the Eighth, at the general  dissolution in November, 1539. Agreeably to the powers vested in him  by Parliament, the king, by letters patent dated September 10th, 1541,  \"did grant his royal charter for erecting the Cathedral Church of the  late monastery of _St. Peter and St. Etheldreda_ at Ely into a  Cathedral Church, by the name and title of \"_The Cathedral Church of  the Holy and Undivided Trinity of Ely_\" to consist of one Dean, a  priest, and eight Prebendaries,[15] priests, with other ministers  necessary for the celebrating Divine service therein.\" And \"did ordain  the said Cathedral Church to be the Episcopal See of the Bishop of Ely  and his successors, with all the honours and privileges of an  Episcopal See and Cathedral Church. And that the said Dean and  Prebendaries be one body corporate, have perpetual succession, one  common seal, be the Chapter of the then Bishop of Ely, and his  successors, and be called '_The Dean and Chapter of the Cathedral  Church of the Holy and Undivided Trinity of Ely_:' also did give and  grant unto them the whole site of the late dissolved monastery, with  all the ancient privileges, liberties, and free customs of the same,  and nearly all the revenues thereof.\" Robert Steward, the late Prior,  was made the first Dean, since whose time twenty-three others have  held the office exclusive of the present Dean, who was appointed in  December, 1869.    [Footnote 15: By an Act of Parliament passed in 1840, the number of  Prebendaries was in future to be reduced to six, two of which stalls  were to be attached respectively to the Regius Professorships of Greek  and Hebrew in the University of Cambridge.]    We append a list of the Priors and Deans of Ely.

At this time neither party dreamed of the  complications destined subsequently to arise in reference to the  position of this meridian on the other side of the globe.    [Illustration: Vasco da Gama; From an old print.]    The meridian of the Tordesillas convention had been supposed still to  give Spain all the American discoveries likely to be made, it being  ascertained only later that by it Portugal had obtained a considerable  part of the South American mainland Brazil, we know, was, till in 1822  it became independent, a Portuguese dependency. Spain, however, retained  both groups of the Antilles with the entire main about the Gulf of  Mexico, and became the earliest great principality in the western world.    [1506-1513]    Before the death of Columbus, Spain had taken firm possession of Cuba,  Porto Rico, and St. Domingo, and she stood ready to seize any of the  adjoining islands or lands so soon as gold, pearls, or aught else of  value should be found there. Cruises of discovery were made in every  direction, first, indeed, in Central and South America. In 1506 de Solis  sailed along the eastern coast of Yucatan. In 1513 the governor of a  colony on the Isthmus of Darien, Vasco Nunez de Balboa, from the top of  a lofty mountain on the isthmus, saw what is now called the Pacific  Ocean. He designated it the South Sea, a name which it habitually bore  till far into the eighteenth century. From this time the exploration and  settlement of the western coast, both up and down, went on with little  interruption, but this history, somewhat foreign to our theme, we cannot  detail.    [Illustration: Balboa discovering the Pacific Ocean.]    [Illustration: Ponce de Leon]    The same year, 1513, Ponce de Leon, an old Spanish soldier in the wars  with the Moors, a companion of Columbus in his second voyage, and till  now governor of Porto Rico, began exploration to the northward. Leaving  Porto Rico with three ships, he landed on the coast of an unknown  country, where he thought to find not only infinite gold but also the  much-talked-about fountain of perpetual youth. His landing occurred on  Easter Sunday, or Pascua Florida, March 27, 1513, and so he named the  country Florida. The place was a few miles north of the present town of  St. Augustine. Exploring the coast around the southern extremity of the  peninsula, he sailed among a group of islands, which he designated the  Tortugas. Returning to Porto Rico, he was appointed governor of the new  country. He made a second voyage, was attacked by the natives and  mortally wounded, and returned to Cuba to die.    [1518-1520]    Juan de Grijalva explored the south coast of the Gulf of Mexico, from  Yucatan toward the Panuco. Interest attaches to this enterprise mainly  because the treasure which Grijalva collected aroused the envy and greed  of the future conqueror of Mexico, Hernando Cortez.    In 1518, Velasquez, governor of Cuba, sends Cortez westward, with eleven  ships and over six hundred men, for the purpose of exploration. He  landed at Tabasco, thence proceeded to the Island of San Juan de Ulua,  nearly opposite Vera Cruz, where he received messengers and gifts from  the Emperor Montezuma. Ordered to leave the country, he destroyed his  ships and marched directly upon the capital. He seized Montezuma and  held him as a hostage for the peaceable conduct of his subjects. The  Mexicans took up arms, only to be defeated again and again by the  Spaniards. Montezuma became a vassal of the Spanish crown, and  covenanted to pay annual tribute. Attempting to reconcile his people to  this agreement he was himself assailed and wounded, and, refusing all  nourishment, soon after died. With re-enforcements, Cortez completed  the conquest of the country, and Mexico became a province of Spain.    [Illustration: Hernando Cortes. From an old print.]    Vasquez de Ayllon, one of the auditors of the Island of Santo Domingo,  sent two ships from that island to the Bahamas for Indians to be sold as  slaves. Driven from their course by the wind, they at length reached the  shore of South Carolina, at the mouth of the Wateree River, which they  named the Jordan, calling the country Chicora. Though kindly treated by  the natives, the ruthless adventurers carried away some seventy of  these. One ship was lost, and most of the captives on the others died  during the voyage. Vasquez was, by the Emperor Charles V., King of  Spain, made governor of this new province, and again set sail to take  possession. But the natives, in revenge for the cruel treatment which  they had previously received, made a furious attack upon the invaders.  The few survivors of the slaughter returned to Santo Domingo, and the  expedition was abandoned. These voyages were in 1520 and 1526.    In connection with the subject of Spanish voyages, a passing notice  should be given to one, who, though not of Spanish birth, yet did much  to further the progress of discovery on the part of his adopted country.  Magellan was a Portuguese navigator who had been a child when Columbus  came back in triumph from the West Indies. Refused consideration from  King Emmanuel, of Portugal, for a wound received under his flag during  the war against Morocco, he renounced his native land and offered his  services to the sagacious Charles V., of Spain, who gladly accepted  them, With a magnificent fleet, Magellan, in 1519, set sail from  Seville, cherishing Columbus's bold purpose, which no one had yet  realized, of reaching the East Indies by a westward voyage, After  touching at the Canaries, he explored the coast of South America, passed  through the strait now called by his name, discovered the Ladrone  Islands, and christened the circumjacent ocean the Pacific.    [Illustration: Montezuma mortally wounded by his own subjects.]    The illustrious navigator now sailed for the Philippine Islands, so  named from Philip, son of Charles V., who succeeded that monarch as  Philip II. By the Tordesillas division above described, the islands were  properly in the Portuguese hemisphere, but on the earliest maps, made by  Spaniards, they were placed twenty-five degrees too far east, and this  circumstance, whether accidental or designed, has preserved them to  Spain even to the present time. At the Philippine Islands Magellan was  killed in an affray with the natives. One of his ships, the Victoria,  after sailing around the Cape of Good Hope, arrived in Spain, having  been the first to circumnavigate the globe. The voyage had taken three  years and twenty-eight days.    [1528-1540]    The disastrous failure of the expedition of Vasquez de Ayllon to Florida  did not discourage attempts on the part of others in the same direction.  Velaspuez, governor of Cuba, jealous of the success of Cortez in Mexico,  had sent Pamphilo de Narvaez to arrest him. In this attempt Narvaez had  been defeated and taken prisoner. Undeterred by this failure he had  solicited and received of Charles V. the position of governor over  Florida, a territory at that time embracing the whole southern part of  what is now the United States, and reaching from Cape Sable to the  Panuco, or River of Palms, in Mexico. With three hundred men he, in  1528, landed near Appalachee Bay, and marched inland with the hope of  opening a country rich and populous. Bitterly was he disappointed.  Swamps and forests, wretched wigwams with their squalid inmates  everywhere met his view, but no gold was to be found. Discouraged, he  and his followers returned to the coast, where almost superhuman toil  and skill enabled them to build five boats, in which they hoped to work  westward to the Spanish settlements. Embarking, they stole cautiously  along the coast for some distance, but were at last driven by a storm  upon an island, perhaps Galveston, perhaps Santa Rosa, where Narvaez and  most of his men perished. Four of his followers survived to cross Texas  to the Gulf of California and reach the town of San Miguel on the west  coast of Mexico. Here they found their countrymen, searching as usual  for pearls, gold, and slaves, and by their help they made a speedy  return to Spain, heroes of as remarkable an adventure as history  records. These unfortunates were the first Europeans to visit New  Mexico. Their narrative led to the exploration of that country by  Coronado and others, and to the discoveries of Cortez in Lower  California.    [Illustration: Death of Magellan.]    [Illustration: Ferdinand de Soto.]    Ferdinand de Soto, eager to rival the exploits of Cortez in Mexico, and  of his former commander, Pizarro, in Peru, offered to conquer Florida at  his own expense. Appointed governor-general of Florida and of Cuba, he  sailed with seven large and three small vessels. From Espiritu Santo Bay  he, in 1539, marched with six hundred men into the country of the  Appalachians and discovered the harbor of Pensacola. After wintering at  Appalachee he set out into the interior, said to abound in gold and  silver. Penetrating northeasterly as far as the Savannah, he found only  copper and mica. From here he marched first northwest into northern  central Georgia, then southwest into Alabama. A battle was fought with  the natives at Mavila, or Mobile, in which the Spaniards suffered  serious loss. Ships that he had ordered arrived at Pensacola, but de  Soto determined not to embark until success should have crowned his  efforts. He turned back into the interior, into the country of the  Chickasaws, marched diagonally over the present State of Mississippi to  its northwest corner, and crossed the Mississippi River near the lowest  Chickasaw Bluff. From this point the general direction of the Spanish  progress was southwest, through what is "]]]
