To which  side will she cling? Is not her people going to take the arms against  their secular enemy, the Turks?    This solution would be the most satisfactory for Bulgaria. Now a  chance is given her to fulfill her obligations to Russia, who made her  free. Let the Bulgarian sword be thrust against the secular enemy of  Slavdom and the petty differences be forgotten.    Bulgaria, under the Russian wing, will enter the Slav family united,  strong, and beloved. If she remains inactive she will drag herself  poor and forgotten by all and full of regrets.      A PEASANT'S ANSWER.    _As illustrating the popular feeling in Bulgaria the following letter  from a peasant to Mr. Maringovich appeared in the official organ of  the Bulgarian Government, Echo de Bulgarie, published in French:_    Your Excellency: I am a plain peasant from the Danube country. While  born on the shores of the beautiful blue Lake of Ochrida, and really,  I cannot understand what is the meaning of your factum, (sic.) What  have you come to do among us? Nobody knows you any more in Sofia. You  are Servian and consequently a foreigner to us Bulgarians. There are  certain pains that nothing can alleviate, nor heal, and there are  wounds that nothing can cicatrize.    Since your entry in Ochrida, in my father's house, you, the Servian  Army, behaved like enemies. You profaned the church, that Bulgarian  church where I took my first communion. You have despoiled the  archives and burned our libraries; you ordered closed our national  school where I learned to mumble the alphabet of my mother tongue.    I have seen the epic struggle of my compatriots against Greeks and  Turks, and I took part with them in order to obtain these national  institutions. And did you come there in Ochrida, and everywhere in  Macedonia protected by our valiant army of Lule Bourgas and Chataldja,  to perform the duty of allies--of Slav brethren?    You established yourselves as conquerors of the country, as vandals,  with the manifest purpose of extinguishing every vestige of our  national culture. You associated yourselves with the non-Slavs  (Rumanians and Greeks) against us, your allies, in order to reach your  end. Why, then, do you call us Slavs? We were called Tartars until  just before you arrived in Sofia.    You treated as villains our Bishops, whom the Turks and the Greeks  were forced to restore us after a struggle of seventy-five years. You  burned our Bulgarian books, and you forbade, under penalty of death,  our people from calling themselves Bulgars. You tortured my parents  with all the refinements of torture that you have invented.    Why, I beg of you? Because you were Servians? I will not go so far as  to injure you with the belief that the Servians are capable of crimes  against nature. Then, because we were Bulgarians; because those poor  people, taking you for their brethren, for Christians, for Slavs, at  least had the courage to say they were Bulgarians and to think  themselves such.    And this continues today with increased intensity. Ah, Mr.  Maringovich! You have committed there and you persist in committing a  crime against humanity that nothing will ever efface. You stabbed us  to the heart, with premeditation, and the wound is still bleeding; you  killed our faith in the Slav brotherhood. You morally assassinated us.    In the face of these crimes, Bregainitza and Slivnitza are pale  figures. These odious crimes will not be left unpunished. The day of  chastisement will come whether you look for it or not.    Your Excellency, I permit myself to repeat the question: What have you  come to do among us?    Really you must have a good cheek--permit me this undiplomatic  expression--and a Servian cheek, in order to have the audacity to come  here and tell us tales. It is not only this; but you make sport of our  sacredest and deepest sentiments, you reopen our wounds, and you  purely and simply abuse us. You ought to have thought of all this  before you set out for Sofia. Today there is an abyss dividing Serbs  and Bulgars. It is an open precipice which will serve for you as a  grave. You wish to fill it? To succeed you must employ other means  than words.    Sir: You are a foreigner to us; there is not an honest man in all  Bulgaria who can consider you a welcome guest. Nobody knows you. For  every Bulgar there is only one word and one gesture for you. We stake  our liberty in giving you the answer and in making the gesture.    Sir: You may take the train which brought you here from Nish. There is  the depot. Farewell! Kindly accept the assurance of my consideration  for your person, whom I had not the advantage to know.      THE MINISTRY'S POSITION.    _The statement by the new Servian Cabinet in the Skuptschina on Dec.  8, 1914, follows:_    The new Ministry has made in the Skuptschina the following  declarations: The Government that has the honor to appear before you  has been constituted with the purpose of manifesting to the end of  this great crisis the union of the wills, the forces, and the  intentions of all political parties of our country.    This Government is convinced of the confidence of the Skuptschina, as  it puts all of its forces to the service of the great cause of the  Servian Nation, and of the Serbo-Croatian-Slovenian family.    The Government considers its first duty to bow low before the heroic  sacrifices voluntarily made on the altar of the fatherland.    The Government sends to the entire army and to all the military, from  commanders down to simple privates, the expression of its confidence,  its admiration and its gratitude for their efforts and their  sacrifices to the common fatherland.    Our little and young army, conserving the good reputation it had  acquired in the past years, has put itself worthily on the side of the  glorious and veteran armies of our great allies, who are struggling  together with us for the cause of justice and liberty.    There is no doubt that in the end of these painful days of war our  historic nation will be recognized and appreciated.    The Government is convinced that all the Servian people are united  until the end of this hallowed war, to defend their hearths and their  liberty; that their sole duty is to assure an army proportionate to  this great war, which from the very beginning has been a struggle for  the emancipation and the union of all our brother Serbo-Croato-Slovaks,  who now suffer under foreign rule.    The brilliant success which will crown this war will compensate  largely the great sacrifices of the present Servian generation. In  this struggle the Servian people have not to choose, because in a  question of life and death there is no choice.    This people is forced to struggle and will do its duty with the same  unflinching energy of a century ago for the redemption of the tomb of  Kossovo.    The Government will try faithfully to represent this national  decision; and, faithful to its powerful and heroic allies, it will  with confidence await the hour of victory.    The Government, conscious of the pains and hardships suffered by the  army and in large part by the nation, will do all that human strength  can do for the amelioration of the present situation and will  energetically try all measures for refitting the army and bettering  the sanitary service, as in this cause no sacrifices shall be spared.    In concert with you, gentlemen, the Government will take all the  necessary measures for helping the population to recuperate after the  war.    Now, while the enemy is yet at the gates of our country, the  Government cries: Forward, with God's help, against the enemy! Forward  in the struggle against the enemy!    [All the Deputies, without party distinction, repeated the last words  of Premier Nicola Pashitch, and immense applause greeted the  manifesto.]      STATEMENT TO GREECE.    _The Servian Minister at Athens, Mr. Baluhtchich, caused this  announcement to be made on Nov. 29, 1914:_    On Nov. 29 the Servian Minister at Athens declared that all talk of  Servian concessions of any kind in favor of Bulgaria was premature.    The Servian Government, the Minister said, finds it impossible to  proceed to any concession territorial or moral, so long as Servia is  in a state of war.    The Bulgarian Government has not made, and it is impossible to  formulate, her demands directly to Servia, because it is impossible to  foresee the outcome of a struggle so violent and apparently destined  to be long. For Servia it is impossible to enter negotiations of  indemnity or concessions for the neutrality of Bulgaria before an end  is put to the present situation. The only certain thing is that the  Governments of the Triple Entente are endeavoring to reconstitute the  Balkan League, which is to be made of three Balkan States, namely,  Servia, Greece, and Bulgaria.    But, as I had the occasion of stating some time ago, the Bulgarian  territorial demands, with regard to the reconstitution of the league,  have been so preposterous that neither Greece nor Servia could begin  discussions on such a basis.    I deny, in the most emphatic manner, Mr. Baluhtchich said, the news  that Servia was to cede, or that Bulgaria directly and formally  demanded from my Government, any strip whatever of Macedonian  territory, at least for the time being.    Likewise it is untrue that the Bulgarian Prime Minister, Mr.  Radoslavoff, demanded from the Ambassadors of the Triple Entente that  the compensation for her neutrality be guaranteed to her from now for  the future. It is true that a disturbing political ferment is going on  now in the Balkan Peninsula, the Servian Minister said in conclusion,  but it is a difficult thing to express opinions at this time.    However, before the war is over, neither concessions nor"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20523"],[0,"Religion and Art in Ancient Greece (#6)"],[1,", indeed, learnt from the  Elgin marbles that the Greek sculptors in the fifth century possessed a  nobility in their conception of the human form, a mastery in the  treatment of the nude and of drapery, and a skill in marble technique of  which only a faint reflection can be traced in the later Graeco-Roman  tradition; but the great statues in which the sculptors of the fifth  century embodied their ideals of the gods were either entirely lost or  preserved only in inadequate copies; and it is only in recent years that  the discovery of originals or the identification of trustworthy copies  has enabled us to appreciate the intensity of expression and of inner  life which distinguished the work of the great sculptors of the fourth  century, such as Scopas, Praxiteles, and Lysippus. Still, if Mr. Ruskin  had, like Brunn in his _Gotteridealen_, selected heads like those of the  Demeter of Cnidus or the Hera Farnese to illustrate his theme, instead  of a series of heads on coins magnified to many times the size for which  they were designed, he could hardly have written the passages just  quoted. But the second of those passages itself supplies us with another  clue. In this estimate of Greek sculpture there is throughout implied a  comparison with Christian, and above all with Florentine art, and its  desire to           \"... bring the invisible full into play;    Let the visible go to the dogs; what matters?\"    It is evident that the expression of the invisible, of character and  individuality, will be more striking and obvious in an art which lets  them \"shine through the flesh they fray\" than in the case of the Greek  sculptors whose respect and even passionate admiration for the human  body would not allow them thus to transfigure it, at least in their  statues of the gods, and led them to seek for subtler methods of  expression by means of the flesh and in harmony with its nature. Their  expression of character and emotion is rendered in terms of a beautiful  and healthy body. How this end was attained we must consider later on;  but there is yet another current prejudice in favour of this  exaggeration of individuality which has its influence especially upon  modern artists. It is sometimes said nowadays that a departure from the  individual model is an attempt to \"improve upon nature,\" and is  therefore an artistic mistake. Now the Greek sculptor, as a rule, did  not work from an individual model at all. He trusted partly, especially  in earlier times, to the tradition which familiarised him with a few  fixed types, on which he made variations, partly to his observation and  memory trained for generations, and daily supplied with new material in  the gymnasium where nude youths and men were constantly exercising, or  in the marketplace where he met his fellow-citizens. To see before him,  whether draped or nude, the figures he wanted for his art, he had no  need to pose a model in a studio; his models were at all times around  him in his daily life. The result was that when he wished to represent a  youth or a maiden, or even to make a portrait of a statesman, he tended  to reproduce the type with certain personal modifications rather than to  produce a portrait in the modern sense. But when he came to making  statues of the gods, his freedom of hand was of incalculable service to  him in giving a bodily form to his imagination; it enabled him to create  after nature, without being dependent on an individual model or having  to fall back upon such vague and generalised forms as are sometimes  associated with an academic or classical art; for it was his own trained  observation and memory that he called into play, not a mere mechanical  system he had learnt from his predecessors. In the more individualistic  art of the fourth century, as we shall see, it is probable that the  personal model was of more importance, especially in female statues; but  even then it was still modified by the tradition and style which makes a  harmonious whole, not only of each Greek statue, but of the development  of Hellenic sculpture generally. In typical examples of the sculpture of  the fourth century we find not only this harmony and restraint, and the  beauty of bodily form in figure as well as in features which is  generally recognised as characteristic of Greek art, but also an  expression of character and individuality, of mood and temperament, of  pathos and passion, which is none the less intense and real because it  is expressed by means of the perfection of physical form, not as wasting  or deforming it.    It may be asked how the invisible, mental, or spiritual qualities can be  portrayed in visible form, especially if that visible form be not  overmuch distorted or modified, and in a more general way, how the  expression of a statue, and the impression it produces, can be analysed  or discussed. For examples of the way this can be done, the reader may  be referred once more to Brunn's _Gotteridealen_, a study of a few  selected representations of Greek gods in which the character of each is  brought out by a subtle and discriminating analysis of the visible  forms. Here it may suffice to quote Brunn's own words from the  Introduction to that work: \"The spiritual effect produced on us by a  work of sculpture cannot be comprehended as a moral or a metaphysical  peculiarity, completely independent of corporeal phenomena; it can  become intelligible to us only by means of tangible sculptural forms, as  the exponents of spiritual expression.\" And again: \"The spiritual  understanding of ideal artistic creations can only be attained on the  basis of a thorough analysis of their forms\"; hence in such a study we  have to do with \"no subjective fancies, but an investigation of  objective artistic principles, according to the method of scientific  work.\"    There are various ways in which spiritual qualities, mood, and character  may be given material expression in harmony with the bodily forms, not  in combat with the flesh. There are, for instance, certain bodily  peculiarities that usually accompany, and therefore suggest by  association, various temperaments or mental qualities; and, moreover,  the actual effect upon the features and bearing of certain emotions or  moods often leaves permanent traces, from which a habitual or repeated  tendency to such emotions or moods can be inferred. That certain types  of face and certain expressions are usually associated with certain  spiritual or mental qualities will hardly be denied; and here the method  of the Greek artist, in observing and working from memory rather than  from a posed model, gave him a great advantage in variety and freedom in  the expression of character no less than in the rendering of bodily  form. If he realised clearly the individuality of his gods, his skill  and mastery over his material and his store of observation gave him a  facility in giving this individuality a visible form which may not be so  obvious at first sight as the individuality of a Florentine or of a  modern head, but which is none the less there for those who have eyes to  see it, and who can accustom themselves to the subtle atmosphere of  ancient art, and to the moderation and restraint which are seldom, if  ever, violated in its most characteristic productions.          CHAPTER IV    ANTHROPOMORPHISM      We have already noticed the religious conceptions and impulses which led  to the substitution of images in human shape for the rude stocks and  stones of primitive worship. The beginning of the change seems to have  taken place at an early stage in the development of Greek art. In  pre-Hellenic times we find representation of gods and goddesses in human  form upon gems and other small works of art, and also in statuettes that  were either objects of worship or dedicated in shrines; but we have at  present no evidence as to whether monumental images of the gods were  made in human form, though some objects of worship, such as the  double-axe, were certainly set up in regular shrines. We know too little  about the religious beliefs and customs of this prehistoric age to be  able to judge whether such objects were regarded merely as symbols of  the deity or as having immanent in them some divine or superhuman power;  but survivals, especially of an early tree and pillar cult, are probably  to be traced in historic Greece, and even to the present day.    The Homeric poems, on the other hand, supply us with little or no  evidence as to the existence of any sculptural representation of the  gods. Although temples are frequently mentioned, we are not informed  that any of them contained a sacred image, with the apparent exception  of the temple of Athena at Troy. There we are told that the Trojan  matrons, in a time of stress, brought a robe to offer to the goddess,  and that the priestess Theano placed it \"upon the knees of  beauteous-haired Athene.\" Unless, as is possible, this is a purely  metaphorical expression, it would seem to imply a seated statue; but it  is to be noted that the Palladium of Troy, the sacred image of Athena  which was stolen by Ulysses and Diomed, and which was preserved,  according to conflicting traditions, in one or another shrine in later  Greece, was a standing statue of a primitive type. The inconsistency is  not of great importance, except as showing that the supposed mention of  the statue of Athena in the Iliad had little, if any, influence on later  tradition; and in any case it is isolated, and does not refer to a  Greek, but a foreign temple. On the other hand, we find frequent mention  in later writers of primitive statues of the gods which were said to  have been set up or dedicated by various persons in the heroic age. An  example is offered by the Trojan Palladium already mentioned; another  was the statue of Artemis carried off from Tauris by Iphigenia and  Orestes; rival claimants to this identification existed at Sparta and at  Brauron in"]]]
