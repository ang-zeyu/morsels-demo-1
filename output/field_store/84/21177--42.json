[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22522"],[0,"Artists' Wives (#6)"],[1,"Romeo and Juliet linger in the dawning light of day:    \"It was the nightingale, and not the lark.\"    And softly it caught Faust and Marguerite in a ray of moonlight, that  rose from the rustic bench to the shutters of their little chamber, amid  the entangled ivy and blossoming roses:    \"Let me once more gaze upon thy face.\"    Soon all Paris knew their love and became interested in it. It was the  wonder of the season. The world came to admire the two splendid stars  gently gravitating towards each other in the musical firmament of the  Opera House. At last one evening, after an enthusiastic recall, as the  curtain fell, separating the house full of noisy applause and the  stage littered with bouquets, where the white gown of Juliet swept  over scattered camellia blossoms, the two singers were seized with an  irresistible impulse, as though their love, a shade artificial, had but  awaited the emotion of a splendid success to reveal itself.    [Illustration: p077-088]    Hands were clasped, vows exchanged, vows consecrated by the distant  and persistent plaudits of the house. The two stars had made their  conjunction.    After the wedding, some time passed before they were again seen on the  stage. Then, when their holiday was ended, they reappeared in the  same piece. This reappearance was a revelation. Until then, of the two  singers, the man had been the most prized. Older and more accustomed to  the public, whose foibles and preferences he had studied, he held the  pit and boxes under the spell of his voice. Beside him, the other one  seemed but an admirably gifted pupil, the promise of a future genius;  but her voice was young and had angles in it, just as her shoulders were  too slight and thin. And when on her return she appeared in one of her  former parts, and the full rich, powerful sound poured out in the very  first notes, abundant and pure, like the water of some sparkling spring,  there ran through the house such a thrill of delight and surprise, that  all the interest of the evening was concentrated on her. For the young  woman, it was one of those happy days, in which the ambient atmosphere  becomes limpid, light and vibrating, wafting towards one all the  radiance and adulations of success. As for the husband, they almost  forgot to applaud him, and as a dazzling light ever seems to make the  shade around it darker, so he, found himself relegated, as it were, to  the most insignificant part of the stage, as if he were neither more nor  less than a mere walking gentleman.    After all, the passion that was revealed in the songstress's acting, in  her voice full of charm and tenderness, was inspired by him. He alone  lent fire to the glances of those deep eyes, and that idea ought to have  made him proud, but the comedian's vanity proved stronger. At the end  of the performance he sent for the leader of the _claque_ and rated him  soundly. They had missed his entry and his exit, forgotten the recall at  the third act; he would complain to the manager, &c.    Alas! In vain he struggled, in vain did the paid applause greet him,  the good graces of the public, henceforth bestowed on his wife, remained  definitively acquired to her. She was fortunate too in a choice of parts  appropriate to her talent and her beauty, in which she appeared with all  the assurance of a woman of the world entering a ball-room, dressed in  the colours best suited to her, and certain of an ovation. At each fresh  success the husband was depressed, nervous, and irritable. This vogue  which left him and so absolutely became hers only, seemed to him a kind  of robbery. For a long while he strove to hide from every one, more  especially from his wife, this unavowable anguish; but one evening, as  she was going up the stairs leading to her dressing-room, holding up  with both hands her skirt-laden with bouquets, carried away by her  triumphal success, she said to him with a voice still overcome by the  excitement of applause: \"We have had a magnificent house to-night.\" He  replied: \"You think so!\" in such an ironical and bitter tone, that the  young wife suddenly understood all.    Her husband was jealous! Not with the jealousy of a lover, who will  only allow his wife to be beautiful for him, but with the jealousy of an  artist, cold, furious, implacable. At times, when she stopped at the end  of an air and multitudes of bravos were thrown to her from outstretched  hands, he affected an indifferent and absent manner, and his listless  gaze seemed to say to the spectators: \"When you have finished  applauding, I'll sing.\"    Ah! the applause, that sound like hail reechoing so delightfully through  the lobbies, the house, and the side scenes, once the sweets of it are  tasted, it is impossible to live without it. Great actors do not die of  illness or old age, they cease to exist when applause no longer greets  them. At the indifference of the public, this one was really seized with  a feeling of despair. He grew thin, became peevish and bad-tempered. In  vain did he reason with himself, look his incurable folly well in the  face, repeat to himself before he came on the stage:    \"And yet she is my wife, and I love her!\"    In the artificial atmosphere of the stage the true sentiment of life  vanished at once. He still loved the wife, but detested the singer. She  realized it, and as one nurses an invalid, watched the sad mania. At  first she thought of lessening her success, of making a sparing use and  not giving the full power of her voice and talent; but her resolutions  like those of her husband could not withstand the glare of the  footlights. Her talent, almost unconsciously, overstepped her will. Then  she humbled herself before him, belittled herself. She asked his advice,  inquired if he thought her interpretation correct, if he understood the  part in that way.    Of course he was never satisfied. With assumed goodnature, in the tone  of false friendship that comedians use so much amongst each other, he  would say, on the evenings of her greatest successes:    \"You must watch yourself, dear, you are not doing very well just now,  not improving.\"    At other times he tried to prevent her singing:    \"Take care, you are lavishing yourself. You are doing too much. Don't  wear out your luck. Believe me, you ought to take a holiday.\"    He even condescended to the most paltry pretexts. Said she had a cold,  was not in good voice. Or else he would try to pick some mean stage  quarrel:    \"You took up the end of the duet too quickly; you spoilt my effect. You  did it on purpose.\"    He never saw, poor wretch, that it was he who hindered her bye play,  hurrying on with his cue in order to prevent any applause, and in his  anxiety to regain the public ear, monopolizing the front of the stage,  leaving his wife in the background. She never complained, for she loved  him too well; moreover success makes us indulgent and every evening  she was compelled to quit the shade in which she strove to conceal and  efface herself, to obey the summons enthusiastically calling her to the  footlights. This singular jealousy was soon noticed at the theatre, and  their fellow actors made fun of it. They overwhelmed the singer with  compliments about his wife's singing. They thrust under his eyes the  newspaper article in which after four long columns devoted to the star,  the critic bestowed a few lines to the fast fading vogue of the husband.  One day, having just read one of these articles, he rushed into his  wife's dressing-room, holding the open paper in his hand and said to  her, pale with rage:    \"The fellow must have been your lover.\" He had indeed reached this  degree of injustice. In fact the unhappy woman, praised and envied,  whose name figured in large type on the play bills and might be read on  all the walls of Paris, who was seized upon as a successful advertising  medium and placed on the tiny gilt labels of the confectioner or  perfumer, led the saddest and most humiliating of lives. She dared not  open a paper for fear of reading her own praises, wept over the flowers  that were thrown to her and which she left to die in a corner of her  dressing-room, that she might avoid perpetuating at home the cruel  memories of her triumphant evenings. She even wanted to quit the stage,  but her husband objected.    [Illustration: p084-095]    \"It will be said that I make you leave it.\" And the horrible torture  continued for both.    One night of a first representation, the songstress was going to the  front, when somebody said to her: \"Mind what you are about. There is  a cabal in the house against you.\" She laughed at the idea. A cabal  against her? And for what reason, Good Heavens! She who only met with  sympathy, who did not belong to any coterie! It was true however. In  the middle of the opera, in a grand duet with her husband, at the moment  when her magnificent voice had reached the highest pitch of its compass,  finishing the sound in a succession of notes, even and pure like the  rounded pearls of a necklace, a volley of hisses cut her short. The  audience was as much moved and surprised as herself. All remained  breathless, as though each one felt prisoner within them the passage  she had not been able to finish. Suddenly a horrible, mad idea flashed  across her mind. He was alone on the stage, in front of her. She gazed  at him steadily and saw in his eyes the passing gleam of a cruel smile.  The poor woman understood all. Sobs suffocated her.    She could only burst into tears and blindly disappear through the  crowded side scenes.    It was her own husband who had had her hissed!    [Illustration: p086-097]    [Illustration: p088-099]          A MISUNDERSTANDING -- THE WIFE'S VERSION.    What can be the matter with him? What can he complain of? I cannot  understand it. And yet I have done all I could to make him happy. To be  sure, I don't say that instead of a poet I would not rather have married  a notary or "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22523"],[0,"The History of the American Expedition Fighting the Bolsheviki (#6)"],[1,"attacks. Then the Bolos were supposed to run away and a French company  supported by a section of American machine guns and a \"Hq.\" section that  had been trained hastily into a Stokes mortar section, were to rush in  and assist in consolidating the positions gained.    But this hurriedly contrived advance was doomed to failure before it  started. There had not been proper preparations. The main force  consisting of \"M\" Company and two platoons of \"I\" Company and a small  detachment of Engineers to blow the track in rear of the Bolo position  at 455 was to march many miles by the flank in the afternoon and night  but were not provided with even a map that showed anything but the  merest outlines. The other detachment consisting of two remaining  platoons of \"I\" Company were little better off only they had no such  great distance to go. Both detachments after long hours were unable to  reach the objective.    This was so memorable a night march and so typical of the fall  operations everywhere that space has been allowed to describe it. No one  had been over the proposed route of march ordered by Col. Sutherland. No  Russian guide could be provided. We must follow the blazed trail of an  east-and-west forest line till we came to a certain broad  north-and-south cutting laid out in the days of Peter the Great. Down  this cutting we were to march so many versts, told by the decaying old  notched posts, till we passed the enemy's flank at 455, then turn in  toward the railroad, camp for the night in the woods and attack him in  the rear at 6:00 a. m.    At five o'clock in the afternoon the detachment struck into the woods.  Lieut. Chantrill, the pleasant British intelligence officer who acted as  interpreter, volunteered to go as guide although he had no familiarity  with the swamp-infested forest area. It was dark long before we reached  the broad cutting. No one will forget the ordeal of that night march.  Could not see the man ahead of you. Ears told you he was tripping over  fallen timber or sloshing in knee-deep bog hole. Hard breathing told the  story of exertion. Only above and forward was there a faint streak of  starlight that uncertainly led us on and on south toward the vicinity of  the Bolo positions.    Hours later we emerge from the woods cutting into a great marsh. Far in  the dark on the other side we must hit the cutting in the heavy pine  woods. For two hours we struggle on. We lose our direction. The marsh is  a bog. To the right, to the left, in front the tantalizing optical  illusion lures us on toward an apparently firmer footing. But ever the  same, or worse, treacherous mire. We cannot stand a moment in a spot. We  must flounder on. The column has to spread. Distress comes from every  side. Men are down and groggy. Some one who is responsible for that body  of men sweats blood and swears hatred to the muddler who is to blame.  How clearly sounds the exhaust of the locomotives in the Bolo camp on  the nearby railroad. Will their outguards hear us? Courage, men, we must  get on.    This is a fine end. D-- that unverified old map the Colonel has. It did  not show this lake that baffles our further struggles to advance. Detour  of the unknown lake without a guide, especially in our present exhausted  condition, is impossible. (Two weeks later with two Russian guides and  American officers who had explored the way, we thought it a wonderful  feat to thread our way around with a column). Judgment now dictates that  it is best to retrace our steps and cut in at 461 to be in position to  be of use in the reserve or in the consolidation. We have failed to  reach our objective but it is not our fault. We followed orders and  directions but they were faulty. It is a story that was to be duplicated  over and over by one American force after another on the various fronts  in the rainy fall season, operating under British officers who took  desperate chances and acted on the theory that \"You Americans,\" as Col.  Sutherland said, \"can do it somehow, you know.\" And as to numbers, why,  \"Ten Americans are as good as a hundred Bolos, aren't they?\"    But how shall we extricate ourselves? Who knows where the cutting may be  found? Can staggering men again survive the treacherous morass? It is  lighter now. We will pick our way better. But where is the cutting?  Chantrill and the Captain despair. Have we missed it in, the dark? Then  we are done for. Where is the \"I\" Co. detachment again? Lost? Here  Corporal Grahek, and you, Sgt. Getzloff, you old woodsmen from north  Michigan pines, scout around here and find the cutting and that rear  party. Who is it that you men are carrying?    No trace of the rear part of the column nor of the cutting! One thing  remains to do. We must risk a shout, though the Reds may hear.    \"Danley! eeyohoh!\"    \"Yes, h-e-e-e-r-r-e on the c-u-t-t-i-n-g!\"    Did ever the straight and narrow way seem so good. The column is soon  united again and the back trail despondingly begun. Daylight of a Sunday  morning aids our footsteps. We cross again the stream we had waded waist  deep in the pitch dark and wondered that no one had been drowned.    Zero hour arrives and we listen to the artillery of both sides and for  the rat-tat-tat of the Bolo machine guns when our forces move on the  bridgehead. We hurry on. The battle is joined. Pine woods roar and  reverberate with roar. By taking a nearer blazed trail we may come out  to the railway somewhere near the battle line.    At 8:40 a. m. we emerge from the woods near our armored train. At field  headquarters, Major Nichols, who in the thick of the battle has arrived  to relieve Major Young, orders every man at once to be made as  comfortable as possible. Men build fires and warm and dry their clammy  water-soaked feet, picture of which is shown in this volume. Bully and  tea and hard tack revive a good many. It is well they do, for the fight  is going against us and two detachments of volunteers from these men are  soon, to be asked for to go forward to the battle line.    Considerable detail has been given about this march of \"I\" and \"M\"  because writer was familiar with it, but a similar story might be told  of \"H\" in the swamps on the Onega, or of \"K\" or \"L\" and \"M. G.\" at  Kodish, or of \"A,\" \"B,\" \"C\" or \"D\" on the River Fronts, and with equal  praise for the hardihood of the American doughboy hopelessly mired in  swamps and lost in the dense forests, baffled in his attempts because of  no fault of his own, but ready after an hour's rest to go at it again,  as in this case when a volunteer platoon went forward to support the  badly suffering line. The Red Guards composed of the Letts and sailors  were fiercely counter-attacking and threatening to sweep back the line  and capture field-headquarters.    During the preceding hours the French company had pressed in gallantly  after the artillery and machine gun barrage and captured the bridgehead,  and, supported by the American machine gun men and the trench mortar  men, had taken the Bolo's first trench line, seeking to consolidate the  position.    Lieut. Keith of \"Hq.\" Company with twenty-one men and three Stokes  mortars had gone through the woods and taking a lucky direction, avoided  the swamp and cut in to the railroad, arriving in the morning just after  the barrage and the French infantry attack had driven the Reds from  their first line. They took possession of three Bolshevik shacks and a  German machine gun, using hand grenades in driving the Reds out. Then  they placed their trench mortars in position to meet the Bolo  counter-attack.    The Bolos came in on the left flank under cover of the woods, the French  infantry at that time being on the right flank in the woods, and two  platoons of Americans being lost somewhere on the left in the swamp.  This counterattack of the Reds was repulsed by the trench mortar boys  who, however, found themselves at the end of the attack with no more  ammunition for their mortars, Col. Sutherland not having provided for  the sending of reserve ammunition to the mortars from Obozerskaya.  Consequently the second attack of the Reds was waited with anxiety. The  Reds were in great force and well led. They came in at a new angle and  divided the Americans and French, completely overwhelming the trench  mortar men's rifle fire and putting Costello's valiant machine guns out  of action, too. Lieut Keith was severely wounded, one man was killed,  four wounded and three missing. Sgt. Kolbe and Pvt. Driscoll after  prodigies of valor with their machine guns were obliged to fall back  with the French. Kolbe was severely wounded. So the Bolo yells that day  sounded in triumph as they won back their positions from the Americans  and French.    The writer knows, for he heard those hellish yells. Under cover of the  single \"M\" Company platoon rushed up to the bridge, the Americans and  French whose gallant efforts had gone for naught because Col.  Sutherland's battle plan was a \"dud,\" retired to field headquarters at  461. A half platoon of \"I\" men hurried up to support. The veteran Alliez  encouraged the American officer Captain Moore, to hang on to the bridge.  Lieut. Spitler came on with a machine gun and the position was  consolidated and held in spite of heavy shelling by the Bolo armored  trains and his desperate raids at night and in the morning, for the  purpose of destroying the bridge. His high explosive tore up the track  but did no damage to the bridge. His infantry recoiled from the Lewis  gun and machine gun fire of the Americans that covered the bridge and  its approaches.    The day's operations had been costly. The French had lost eight, killed  and wounded and missing. The Americans had lost four killed, fourteen  wounded, among whom were Lieuts. Lawrence Keith and James R. Donovan,  and five missing. Many of these casualties were suffered by the resolute  platoon at the bridge. There Lieut. Donovan was caught by machine gun  fire"]]]
