Roman ladies in fact  acquired considerable proficiency, worthy of a Borgia or  Brinvilliers, in the art of poisoning and in the use of drugs.  The reputed witch, both in ancient and modern times, very often  belonged, like the Ovidian Dipsas, to the real and detestable  class of panders: wrinkled hags were experienced in the arts of  seduction, as well as in the employment of poison and drugs more  familiar to the wealthier class (_Sat._ vi.). The great Satirist  wrote in the latter half of the first century of Christianity;  but even in the Augustan period such crimes were prevalent enough  to make Ovid enumerate them among the universal evils introduced  by the Iron age (_Metamorphoses_, i.). The despotic will of the  princes themselves was exerted in vain; the mischief was too  deep-rooted to succumb even to the decrees of the masters of the  world. Nor did the _divi_ themselves disdain to be initiated in  the infernal or celestial science. Nigidius Figulus and the two  Thrasylli are magical or mathematical names closely connected  with the destinies of the two first imperial princes. Nigidius  predicted, and perhaps promoted, the future elevation of  Octavianus; and the elder Thrasyllus, the famous Rhodian  astrologer, skilfully identified his fate with the life of his  credulous dupe but tyrannical pupil. Thrasyllus' art is stated to  have been of service in preventing the superstitious tyrant from  executing several intended victims of his hatred or caprice, by  making _their_ safety the condition of _his_ existence. The  historian of the early empire tells of the incantations which  could 'affect the mind and increase the disease' of Germanicus,  Tiberius' nephew. 'There were discovered,' says Tacitus, 'dug up  from the ground and out of the walls of the house, the remains of  human corpses, charms and spells, and the name of Germanicus  inscribed on leaden tablets, ashes half consumed covered with  decaying matter, and other practices by which it is believed that  souls are devoted to the deities of hell.'[26]      [25] 'The Canidia of Horace,' Gibbon pronounces, 'is a    vulgar witch. The Erichtho of Lucan is tedious, disgusting,    but sometimes sublime.' The love-charms of Canidia and Medea    are chiefly indebted to the _Pharmakeutria_ of Theocritus.      [26] _Annales_, ii. 69. Writing of the mathematicians and    astrologers in the time of Galba, who urged the governor of    Lusitania on the perilous path to the supreme dignity, the    historian characterises them truly, in his inimitable    language and style, as 'a class of persons not to be trusted    by those in power, deceptive to the expectant; a class which    will always be proscribed and preserved in our state.'    In the fourth century, the first Christian emperor limited the  lawful exercise of magic to the beneficial use of preserving or  restoring the fruits of the earth or the health of the human  body, while the practice of the noxious charms is capitally  punished. The science of those, proclaims the imperial convert,  who, immersed in the arts of magic, are detected either in  attempts against the life and health of their fellow-men, or in  _charming_ the minds of modest persons to the practice of  debauchery, is to be avenged and punished deservedly by severest  penalties. But in no sorts of criminal charges are those remedies  to be involved which are employed for the good of individuals, or  are harmlessly employed in remote places to prevent premature  rains, in the case of vineyards, or the injurious effects of  winds and hailstorms, by which the health and good name of no one  can be injured; but whose practices are of laudable use in  preventing both the gifts of the Deity and the labours of men  from being scattered and destroyed.[27]      [27] _Cod. Justinian_, lib. ix. tit. 18.    Constantine, in distinguishing between good and bad magic,  between the _theurgic_ and _goetic_, maintains a distinction made  by the pagans--a distinction ignored in the later Christian  Church, in whose system 'all demons are infernal spirits, and all  commerce with them is idolatry and apostasy.' Christian zeal has  accused the imperial philosopher and apostate Julian of having  had recourse--not to much purpose--to many magical or necromantic  rites; of cutting up the dead bodies of boys and virgins in the  prescribed method; and of raising the dead to ascertain the event  of his Eastern expedition against the Persians.    Not many years after the death of Julian the Christian Empire  witnessed a persecution for witchcraft that for its ferocity, if  not for its folly, can be paralleled only by similar scenes in  the fifteenth or seventeenth century. It began shortly after the  final division of the East and West in the reigns of Valentinian  and Valens, A.D. 373. The unfortunate accused were pursued with  equal fury in the Eastern and Western Empires; and Rome and  Antioch were the principal arenas on which the bloody tragedy was  consummated. Gibbon informs us that it was occasioned by a  criminal consultation, when the twenty-four letters of the  alphabet were ranged round a magic tripod; a dancing ring placed  in the centre pointed to the first four letters in the name of  the future prince. 'The deadly and incoherent mixture of treason  and magic, of poison and adultery, afforded infinite gradations  of guilt and innocence, of excuse and aggravation, which in these  proceedings appear to have been confounded by the angry or  corrupt passions of the judges. They easily discovered that the  degree of their industry and discernment was estimated by the  imperial court according to the number of executions that were  furnished from their respective tribunals. It was not without  extreme reluctance that they pronounced a sentence of acquittal;  but they eagerly admitted such evidence as was stained with  perjury or procured by torture to prove the most improbable  charges against the most respectable characters. The progress of  the inquiry continually opened new subjects of criminal  prosecution; the audacious informers whose falsehood was detected  retired with impunity: but the wretched victim who discovered his  real or pretended accomplices was seldom permitted to receive the  price of his infamy. From the extremity of Italy and Asia the  young and the aged were dragged in chains to the tribunals of  Rome and Antioch. Senators, matrons, and philosophers expired in  ignominious and cruel tortures. The soldiers who were appointed  to guard the prisons declared, with a murmur of pity and  indignation, that their numbers were insufficient to oppose the  flight or resistance of the multitude of captives. The wealthiest  families were ruined by fines and confiscations; the most  innocent citizens trembled for their safety: and we may form some  notion of the magnitude of the evil from the extravagant  assertion of an ancient writer [Ammianus Marcellinus], that in  the obnoxious provinces the prisoners, the exiles, and the  fugitives formed the greatest part of the inhabitants. The  philosopher Maximus,' it is added, 'with some justice was  involved in the charge of magic; and young Chrysostom, who had  accidentally found one of the proscribed books, gave himself up  for lost.'[28]      [28] _The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman    Empire_, xxv.    The similarity of this to the horrible catastrophe of Arras,  recorded by the chroniclers of the fifteenth century, excepting  the grosser absurdities of the latter, is almost perfect.  Valentinian and Valens, who seem to have emulated the atrocious  fame of the Caesarean family, with their ministers, concealed, it  is probable, under the disguise of a simulated credulity the real  motives of revenge and cupidity.    The Roman world, Christian and pagan, was subject to the  prevailing fear. That portion of the globe, however, comprehended  but a small part of the human race. The records of history are  incomplete and imperfect; nor are they more confined in point of  time than of extent. History is little more at any period than an  imperfect account of the life of a few particular peoples.  Necessarily limited almost entirely to an acquaintance with the  history of that portion of the globe included in the 'Roman  Empire,' we almost forget our profound ignorance of that vastly  larger proportion of the earth's surface, the extra-Roman world,  embracing then, as now, civilised as well as barbarous nations.  The Chinese empire (the most extraordinary, perhaps, and whose  antiquity far surpasses that of any known), comprehending within  its limits two-thirds of the population of the globe; the refined  and ingenious people of Hindustan, an immense population, in the  East: in the Western hemisphere nations in existence whose  remains excited the admiration of the Spanish invaders; the  various savage tribes of the African continent; the nomad  populations of Northern Asia and Europe; nearly all these more or  less, on the testimony of past and present observation,  experienced the tremendous fears of the vulgar demonism.[29]      [29] It may be safely affirmed, according to a celebrated    modern philosopher, that popular religions are really, in    the conception of their more vulgar votaries, a species of    demonism. 'Primus in orbe deos fecit timor,' or, in the    fuller expression of a modern, 'Fear made the devils, and    weak Hope the gods.'    With the tribes who, in the time of Caesar or Tacitus, inhabited  the forests of Germany, and, perhaps, amongst the Scandinavians,  some more elevated ideas obtained, the germ, however, of a  degenerated popular prejudice. By all the German tribes, on  the testimony of cotemporary writers, women were held in  high respect, and were believed to have something even divine  in their mental or spiritual faculties. 'Very many of their  women they regard in the light of prophetesses, and when  superstitious fear"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22829"],[0,"No Animal Food; and Nutrition and Diet; with Vegetable Recipes (#6)"],[1,"shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh  is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.'--Lev.  xvii., 14.    'The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down  with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together;  and a little child shall lead them.... They shall not hurt nor destroy  in all my holy mountain.'--Isaiah lxv.    'He that killeth an ox is as he that slayeth a man.'--Isaiah lxvi., 3.    'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.'--Matt. ix., 7.    'It is good not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor to do anything  whereby thy brother stumbleth.'--Romans xiv., 21.    'Wherefore, if meat maketh my brother to stumble I will eat no flesh for  evermore, that I make not my brother stumble.'--1 Cor. viii., 13.    The verse from Isaiah is no fanciful stretch of poetic imagination. The  writer, no doubt, was picturing a condition of peace and happiness on  earth, when discord had ceased and all creatures obeyed Nature and lived  in harmony. It is not absurd to suppose that someday the birds and  beasts may look upon man as a friend and benefactor, and not the  ferocious beast of prey that he now is. In certain parts of the world,  at the present day--the Galapagos Archipelago, for instance--where man  has so seldom been that he is unknown to the indigenous animal life,  travellers relate that birds are so tame and friendly and curious, being  wholly unacquainted with the bloodthirsty nature of man, that they will  perch on his shoulders and peck at his shoe laces as he walks.    It may be said that Jesus did not specifically forbid flesh-food. But  then he did not specifically forbid war, sweating, slavery, gambling,  vivisection, cock and bull fighting, rabbit-coursing, trusts, opium  smoking, and many other things commonly looked upon as evils which  should not exist among Christians. Jesus laid down general principles,  and we are to apply these general principles to particular  circumstances.    The sum of all His teaching is that love is the most beautiful thing in  the world; that the Kingdom of Heaven is open to all who really and  truly love. The act of loving is the expression of a desire to make  others happy. All beings capable of experiencing pain, who have nervous  sensibilities similar to our own, are capable of experiencing the effect  of our love. The love which is unlimited, which is not confined merely  to wife and children, or blood relations and social companions, or one's  own nation, or even the entire human race, but is so comprehensive as to  include all life, human and sub-human; such love as this marks the  highest point in moral evolution that human intelligence can conceive of  or aspire to.    Eastern religions have been more explicit than Christianity about the  sin of killing animals for food.    In the _Laws of Manu_, it is written: 'The man who forsakes not the law,  and eats not flesh-meat like a bloodthirsty demon, shall attain  goodness in this world, and shall not be afflicted with maladies.'    'Unslaughter is the supreme virtue, supreme asceticism, golden truth,  from which springs up the germ of religion.' _The Mahabharata._    '_Non-killing_, truthfulness, non-stealing, continence, and  non-receiving, are called Yama.' _Patanjalis' Yoga Aphorisms._    'A Yogi must not think of injuring anyone, through thought, word or  deed, and this applies not only to man, but to all animals. Mercy shall  not be for men alone, but shall go beyond, and embrace the whole world.'  _Commentary of Vivekananda._    'Surely hell, fire, and repentance are in store for those who for their  pleasure and gratification cause the dumb animals to suffer pain.' _The  Zend Avesta._    Gautama, the Buddha, was most emphatic in discountenancing the killing  of animals for food, or for any other unnecessary purpose, and Zoroaster  and Confucius are said to have taught the same doctrine.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 2: See _Sartor Resartus_, Book I., chap. xi.: Book III., chap.  vii. Also an article by Prof. W. P. Montague, Ph.D.: 'The Evidence of  Design in the Elements and Structure of the Cosmos,' in the _Hibbert  Journal_, Jan., 1904.]          IV    THE AESTHETIC POINT OF VIEW      St. Paul tells us to think on whatsoever things are pure and lovely  (Phil. iv., 8). The implication is that we should love and worship  beauty. We should seek to surround ourselves by beautiful objects and  avoid that which is degrading and ugly.    Let us make some comparisons. Look at a collection of luscious fruits  filling the air with perfume, and pleasing the eye with a harmony of  colour, and then look at the gruesome array of skinned carcasses  displayed in a butcher's shop; which is the more beautiful? Look at the  work of the husbandman, tilling the soil, pruning the trees, gathering  in the rich harvest of golden fruit, and then look at the work of the  cowboy, branding, castrating, terrifying, butchering helpless animals;  which is the more beautiful? Surely no one would say a corpse was a  beautiful object. Picture it (after the axe has battered the skull, or  the knife has found the heart, and the victim has at last ceased its  dying groans and struggles), with its ghastly staring eyes, its  blood-stained head or throat where the sharp steel pierced into the  quivering flesh; picture it when the body is opened emitting a sickening  odour and the reeking entrails fall in a heap on the gore-splashed  floor; picture this sight and ask whether it is not the epitome of  ugliness, and in direct opposition to the most elementary sense of  beauty.    Moreover, what effect has the work of a slayer of animals upon his  personal character and refinement? Can anyone imagine a  sensitive-minded, finely-wrought _aesthetic_ nature doing anything else  than revolt against the cold-blooded murdering of terrorised animals? It  is significant that in some of the States of America butchers are not  allowed to sit on a jury during a murder trial. Physiognomically the  slaughterman carries his trade-mark legibly enough. The butcher does not  usually exhibit those facial traits which distinguish a person who is  naturally sympathetic and of an aesthetic temperament; on the contrary,  the butcher's face and manner generally bear evidence of a life spent  amid scenes of gory horror and violence; of a task which involves  torture and death.    A plate of cereal served with fruit-juice pleases the eye and  imagination, but a plate smeared with blood and laden with dead flesh  becomes disgusting and repulsive the moment we consider it in that  light. Cooking may disguise the appearance but cannot alter the reality  of the decaying _corpse_; and to cook blood and give it another name  (gravy) may be an artifice to please the palate, but it is blood, (blood  that once coursed through the body of a highly sensitive and nervous  being), just the same. Surely a person whose olfactory nerves have not  been blunted prefers the delicate aroma of ripe fruit to the sickly  smell of mortifying flesh,--or fried eggs and bacon!    Notice how young children, whose taste is more or less unperverted,  relish ripe fruits and nuts and clean tasting things in general. Man,  before he has become thoroughly accustomed to an unnatural diet, before  his taste has been perverted and he has acquired by habit a liking for  unwholesome and unnatural food, has a healthy appetite for Nature's  sun-cooked seeds and berries of all kinds. Now true refinement can only  exist where the senses are uncorrupted by addiction to deleterious  habits, and the nervous system by which the senses act will remain  healthy only so long as it is built up by pure and natural foods; hence  it is only while man is nourished by those foods desired by his  unperverted appetite that he may be said to possess true refinement.  Power of intellect has nothing whatever to do _necessarily_ with the  _aesthetic instinct_. A man may possess vast learning and yet be a boor.  Refinement is not learnt as a boy learns algebra. Refinement comes from  living a refined life, as good deeds come from a good man. The nearer we  live according to Nature's plan, and in harmony with Her, the healthier  we become physically and mentally. We do not look for refinement in the  obese, red-faced, phlegmatic, gluttonous sensualists who often pass as  gentlemen because they possess money or rank, but in those who live  simply, satisfying the simple requirements of the body, and finding  happiness in a life of well-directed toil.           *       *       *       *       *    The taste of young children is often cited by vegetarians to demonstrate  the liking of an unsophisticated palate, but the primitive instinct is  not wholly atrophied in man. Before man became a tool-using animal, he  must have depended for direction upon what is commonly termed instinct  in the selection of a diet most suitable to his nature. No one can  doubt, judging by the way undomesticated animals seek their food with  unerring certainty as to its suitability, but that instinct is a  trustworthy guide. Granting that man could, in a state of absolute  savagery, and before he had discovered the use of fire or of tools,  depend upon instinct alone, and in so doing live healthily, cannot _what  yet remains_ of instinct be of some value among civilized beings? Is not  man, even now, in spite of his abused and corrupted senses, when he sees  luscious fruits hanging within his reach, tempted to pluck them, and  does he not eat them with relish? But when he sees the grazing ox, or  the wallowing hog, do similar gustatory desires affect him? Or when he  sees these animals lying dead, or when skinned and cut up in small  pieces, does this same natural instinct stimulate him to steal and eat  this food as it stimulates a boy to steal apples and nuts from an  orchard and eat them surreptitiously beneath the hedge or behind the  haystack?    Very different is it"]]]
