Perhaps twenty-five or thirty Americans  had been in Nairobi on their way to the rich game fields that lie in all  directions from the town, but beyond these few outsiders the place was  unknown. Now it is decidedly on the map, thanks to our gallant and  picturesque Theodore. It has been mentioned in book and magazine to a  degree that nearly everybody can tell in a general way where and what it  is, even if he can not pronounce it.    Before coming to Nairobi I had read a lot about it, and yet when I  reached the place it seemed as though the descriptions had failed to  prepare me for what I saw. We arrived under unusual conditions. Files of  native soldiers were lined up on the platform of the station to welcome  the new governor, and the whole white population of the town, several  hundred in number, were massed in front of the building. The roofs and  trees were filled with natives and the broad open space beyond the  station was fringed with pony carts, bullock carts, rickshaws, cameras,  and some hotel 'buses. Several thousand people, mostly East Indians and  natives, were among those present. Lord Delamere, who has adopted East  Africa as his home, and who owns a hundred thousand acres or so of game  preserves, read an address of welcome, and Sir Percy, in white uniform  and helmet, responded with a speech that struck a popular note. There  were dozens of cameras snapping and the whole effect was distinctly  festive in appearance.    [Drawing: _In the Back Yard of Nairobi_]    [Photograph: By courtesy of W.D. Boyce. Dressed to Kill]    [Photograph: Courtesy of Boyce Balloonagraph Expedition. The Balloon  Ascension]    [Photograph: Courtesy of Boyce Balloonagraph Expedition. The Norfolk  Hotel, Nairobi]    The town lies on the edge of the Athi Plains, a broad sweep of  sun-bleached grass veldt many miles in extent. From almost any part of  the town one may look out on plains where great herds of wild game are  constantly in sight. In an hour's leisurely walk from the station a man  with a gun can get hartebeest, zebra, Grant's gazelle, Thompson's  gazelle, impalla, and probably wildebeest. One can not possibly count  the number of animals that feed contentedly within sight of the town of  Nairobi, and it is difficult to think that one is not looking out upon a  collection of domesticated game. Sometimes, as happened two nights  before we reached Nairobi, a lion will chase a herd of zebra and the  latter in fright will tear through the town, destroying gardens and  fences and flowers in a mad stampede. We met one man who goes out ten  minutes from town every other day and kills a kongoni (hartebeest) as  food for his dogs. If you were disposed to do so you could kill dozens  every day with little effort and almost no diminution of the visible  supply.    Nairobi is new and unattractive. There is one long main thoroughfare,  quite wide and fringed with trees, along which at wide intervals are the  substantial looking stone building of the Bank of India, the business  houses, the hotels, and numbers of cheap corrugated iron, one-story  shacks used for government purposes. A native barracks with low iron  houses and some more little iron houses used for medical experiments and  still some more for use as native hospitals are encountered as one takes  the half-mile ride from the station to the hotel. A big square filled  with large trees marks the park, and a number of rather pretentious  one-story buildings display signs that tell you where you may buy almost  anything, from a suit of clothes to a magazine rifle.    [Drawing: _The Main Street Is a Busy Place_]    Goanese, East Indian, and European shops are scattered at intervals  along this one long, wide street. Rickshaws, pedestrians, bullock carts,  horsemen, and heavily burdened porters are passing constantly back and  forth, almost always in the middle of the street. Bicycles, one or two  motorcycles, and a couple of automobiles are occasionally to be seen.  The aspect of the town suggests the activity of a new frontier place  where everybody is busy. At one end the long street loses itself in the  broad Athi Plains, at the other it climbs up over some low hills and  enters the residence district on higher ground. Here the hills are  generously covered with a straggly growth of tall, ungraceful trees,  among which, almost hidden from view, are the widely scattered bungalows  of the white population.    [Photograph: An Embo Apollo]      [Photograph: The Askari Patrols the Camp]    Branching off from the main street are side streets, some of them  thronged with East Indian bazaars, about which may be found all the  phases of life of an Indian city. Still beyond and parallel with the one  main street are sparsely settled streets which look ragged with their  tin shacks and scattered gardens.    Nairobi is not a beautiful place, but it is new and busy, and the people  who live there are working wonders in changing a bad location into what  some day will be a pretty place. It is over five thousand feet high,  healthy, and cold at night. Away off in the hills a mile or more from  town is Government House, where the governor lives, and near by is the  club and a new European hospital, looking out over a sweep of country  that on clear days includes Kilima-Njaro, over a hundred miles to the  southeast, and Mount Kenia, a hundred miles northeast.    You are still in civilization in Nairobi. Anything you want you may buy  at some of the shops, and almost anything you may want to eat or drink  may easily be had. There are weekly newspapers, churches, clubs, hotels,  and nearly all the by-products of civilization. One could live in  Nairobi, only a few miles from the equator, wear summer clothes at noon  and winter clothes at night, keep well, and not miss many of the  luxuries of life. The telegraph puts you in immediate touch with the  whole wide world, and on the thirtieth of September you can read the  Chicago _Tribune_ of August thirty-first.    At present the chief revenue of the government is derived from shooting  parties, and the officials are doing all they can to encourage the  coming of sportsmen. Each man who comes to shoot must pay two hundred  and fifty dollars for his license as well as employ at least thirty  natives for his transport. He must buy supplies, pay ten per cent.  import and export tax, and in many other ways spend money which goes  toward paying the expenses of government. The government also is  encouraging various agricultural and stock raising experiments, but  these have not yet passed the experimental stage. Almost anything may be  grown in British East Africa, but before agriculture can be made to pay  the vast herds of wild game must either be exterminated or driven away.  No fence will keep out a herd of zebra, and in one rush a field of grain  is ruined by these giant herds. Experiments have failed satisfactorily  to domesticate the zebra, and so he remains a menace to agriculture and  a nuisance in all respects except as adding a picturesque note to the  landscape.    Colonel Roosevelt, in a recent speech in Nairobi, spoke of British East  Africa as a land of enormous possibilities and promise, but in talks  with many men here I found that little money has been made by those who  have gone into agriculture in a large way. Drought and predatory herds  of game have introduced an element of uncertainty which has made  agriculture, as at present developed, unsatisfactory.    Colonel Roosevelt has become a popular idol in East Africa. Everywhere  one meets Englishmen who express the greatest admiration for him. He has  shrewdly analyzed conditions as they now exist and has picked out the  weak spots in the government. For many years prior to the arrival of Sir  Percy Girouard the country has been administered by weak executives, and  its progress has been greatly retarded thereby. The last governor was  kind, but inefficient, and some months ago was sent to the West Indies,  where he is officially buried. Roosevelt came, sized up the situation,  and made a speech at a big banquet in Nairobi. Nearly two hundred white  men in evening clothes were there. They came from all parts of East  Africa, and listened with admiration to the plain truths that Theodore  Roosevelt told them in the manner of a Dutch uncle. Since then he has  owned the country and could be elected to any office within the gift of  the people. He talked for over an hour, and it must have been a great  speech, if one may judge by the enthusiastic comments I have heard about  it. When an Englishman gets enthusiastic about a speech by an American  it must be a pretty good speech.    Newland and Tarlton is the firm that outfits most shooting parties that  start out from Nairobi. They do all the preliminary work and relieve you  of most of the worry. If you wish them to do so, they will get your  complete outfit, so you need not bring anything with you but a suitcase.  They will get your guns, your tents, your food supplies, your mules,  your head-man, your cook, your gunbearers, your askaris (native  soldiers), your interpreter, your ammunition, and your porters. They  will have the whole outfit ready for you by the time you arrive in  Nairobi. When you arrive in British East Africa, a-shooting bent, you  will hear of Newland and Tarlton so often that you will think they own  the country.    Mr. Newland met us in Mombasa, and through his agents sent all of our  London equipment of tents and guns and ammunition and food up to  Nairobi. When we arrived in Nairobi he had our porters ready, together  with tent boys, gunbearers, and all the other members of our _safari_,  and in three days we were ready to march. The firm has systematized  methods so much that it is simple for them to do what would be matters  of endless worry to the stranger. In course of time you pay the price,  and in our case it seemed reasonable, when one considers the work and  worry involved."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2126"],[0,"The Quest of the Sacred Slipper (#6)"],[1,"manner.    The old man lowered his eyes, and saluted me with graceful gravity.    \"Wa-'aleykum!\" he said (\"And on you!\").  I conducted him to the  door and closed it upon his exit.  In his last salute I had noticed  the flashing of a ring which he wore upon his left hand, and he was  gone scarce ten seconds ere my heart began to beat furiously.  I  snatched up \"Assyrian Mythology\" and with trembling fingers turned  to a certain page.    There I read--    Each Sheikh of the Assassins is said to be invested with the \"Ring  of the Prophet.\"  It bears a green stone, shaped in the form of a  scimitar or crescent.    My dreadful suspicion was confirmed.  I knew who my visitor had  been.    \"God in heaven!\" I whispered.  \"It was Hassan of Aleppo!\"          CHAPTER VII    FIRST ATTEMPT ON THE SAFE      On the following morning I was awakened by the arrival of Bristol.  I hastened to admit him.    \"Your visitor of yesterday,\" he began, \"has wasted no time!\"    \"What has happened?\"    He tugged irritably at his moustache.  \"I don't know!\" he replied.  \"Of course it was no surprise to find that there isn't a Mohammedan  who'll lay his little finger on Professor Deeping's safe!  There's  no doubt in my mind that every lascar at the docks knows Hassan of  Aleppo to be in England.  Some other arrangement will have to be  arrived at, if the thing is ever to be taken to the Antiquarian  Museum.  Meanwhile we stand to lose it.  Last night--\"    He accepted a cigarette, and lighted it carefully.    \"Last night,\" he resumed, \"a member of P Division was on point  duty outside the late Professor's house, and two C.I.D. men were  actually in the room where the safe is.  Result--someone has put  in at least an hour's work on the lock, but it proved too tough a  job!\"    I stared at him amazedly.    \"Someone has been at the lock!\" I cried.  \"But that is impossible,  with two men in the room--unless--\"    \"They were both knocked on the head!\"    \"Both!  But by whom!  My God!  They are not--\"    \"Oh, no!  It was done artistically.  They both came round about  four o'clock this morning.\"    \"And who attacked them?\"    \"They had no idea.  Neither of them saw a thing!\"    My amazement grew by leaps and bounds.  \"But, Bristol, one of them  must have seen the other succumb!\"    \"Both did!  Their statements tally exactly!\"    \"I quite fail to follow you.\"    \"That's not surprising.  Listen: When I got on the scene about five  o'clock, Marden and West, the two C.I.D. men, had quite recovered  their senses, though they were badly shaken, and one had a cracked  skull.  The constable was conscious again, too.\"    \"What!  Was he attacked?\"    \"In exactly the same way!  I'll give you Marden's story, as he gave  it to me a few minutes after the surgeon had done with him.  He said  that they were sitting in the study, smoking, and with both windows  wide open.  It was a fearfully hot night.\"    \"Did they have lights?\"    \"No.  West sat in an armchair near the writing-table; Marden sat by  the window next to the door.  I had arranged that every hour one of  them should go out to the gate and take the constable's report.  It  was just after Marden had been out at one o'clock that it happened.    \"They were sitting as I tell you when Marden thought he heard a  curious sort of noise from the gate.  West appeared to have heard  nothing; but I have no doubt that it was the sound of the constable's  fall.  West's pipe had gone out, and he struck a match to relight  it.  As he did so, Marden saw him drop the match, clench both fists,  and with eyes glaring in the moonlight and his teeth coming together  with a snap, drop from his chair.    \"Marden says that he was half up from his seat when something struck  him on the back of the head with fearful force.  He remembered  nothing more until he awoke, with the dawn creeping into the room,  and heard West groaning somewhere beside him.  They both had badly  damaged skulls with great bruises behind the ear.  It is instructive  to note that their wounds corresponded almost to a fraction of an  inch.  They had been stunned by someone who thoroughly understood  his business, and with some heavy, blunt weapon.  A few minutes  later came the man to relieve the constable; and the constable was  found to have been treated in exactly the same way!\"    \"But if Marden's account is true--\"    \"West, as he lost consciousness, saw Marden go in exactly the same  way.\"    \"Marden was seated by the open window, but I cannot conjecture how  any one can have got at West, who sat by the table!\"    \"The case of Marden is little less than remarkable; he was some  distance from the window.  No one could possibly have reached him  from outside.\"    \"And the constable?\"    \"The constable can give us no clue.  He was suddenly struck down,  as the others were.  I examined the safe, of course, but didn't  touch it, according to instructions.  Someone had been at work on  the lock, but it had defied their efforts.  I'm fully expecting  though that they'll be back to-night, with different tools!\"    \"The place is watched during the day, of course?\"    \"Of course.  But it's unlikely that anything will be attempted in  daylight.  Tonight I am going down myself.\"    \"Could you arrange that I join you?\"    \"I could, but you can see the danger for yourself?\"    \"It is extraordinarily mysterious.\"    \"Mr. Cavanagh, it's uncanny!\" said Bristol.  \"I can understand that  one of these Hashishin could easily have got up behind the man on  duty out in the open.  I know, and so do you, that they're past  masters of that kind of thing; but unless they possess the power to  render themselves invisible, it's not evident how they can have got  behind West whilst he sat at the table, with Marden actually  watching him!\"    \"We must lay a trap for them to-night.\"    \"Rely upon me to do so.  My only fear is that they may anticipate it  and change their tactics.  Hassan of Aleppo apparently knows as much  of our plans as we do ourselves.\"    Inspector Bristol, though a man of considerable culture, clearly was  infected with a species of supernatural dread.          CHAPTER VIII    THE VIOLET EYES AGAIN      At four o'clock in the afternoon I had heard nothing further from  Bristol, but I did not doubt that he would advise me of his  arrangements in good time.  I sought by hard work to forget for a  time the extraordinary business of the stolen slipper; but it  persistently intruded upon my mind.  Particularly, my thoughts  turned to the night of Professor Deeping's murder, and to the  bewitchingly pretty woman who had warned me of the impending tragedy.  She had bound me to secrecy--a secrecy which had proved irksome,  for it had since appeared to me that she must have been an  accomplice of Hassan of Aleppo.  At the time I had been at a loss  to define her peculiar accent, now it seemed evidently enough to  have been Oriental.    I threw down my pen in despair, for work was impossible, went  downstairs, and walked out under the arch into Fleet Street.  Quite  mechanically I turned to the left, and, still engaged with idle  conjectures, strolled along westward.    Passing the entrance to one of the big hotels, I was abruptly  recalled to the realities--by a woman's voice.    \"Wait for me here,\" came musically to my ears.    I stopped, and turned.  A woman who had just quitted a taxi-cab was  entering the hotel. The day was hot and thunderously oppressive,  and this woman with the musical voice wore a delicate costume of  flimsiest white.  A few steps upward she paused and glanced back.  I had a view of a Greek profile, and for one magnetic instant looked  into eyes of the deepest and most wonderful violet.    Then, shaking off inaction, I ran up the steps and overtook the  lady in white as a porter swung open the door to admit her.  We  entered together.    \"Madame,\" I said in a low tone, \"I must detain you for a moment.  There is something I have to ask.\"    She turned, exhibiting the most perfect composure, lowered her  lashes and raised them again, the gaze of the violet eyes sweeping  me from head to foot with a sort of frigid scorn.    \"I fear you have made a mistake, sir.  We have never met before!\"    Her voice betrayed no trace of any foreign accent!    \"But,\" I began--and paused.    I felt myself flush; for this encounter in the foyer of an hotel,  with many curious onlookers, was like to prove embarrassing if my  beautiful acquaintance persisted in her attitude.  I fully realized  what construction would be put upon my presence there, and foresaw  that forcible and ignominious ejection must be my lot if I failed  to establish my right to address her.    She turned away, and crossed in the direction of the staircase.  A sunbeam sought out a lock of hair that strayed across her brow,  and kissed it to a sudden glow like that which lurks in the heart  of a blush rose.    That wonderful sheen, which I had never met with elsewhere in  nature, but which no artifice could lend, served to remove my last  frail doubt which had survived the evidence of the violet eyes.  I  had been deceived by no strange resemblance; this was indeed the  woman who had been the harbinger of Professor Deeping's death.  In  three strides I was beside her again.  Curious glances were set  upon me, and I saw a servant evidently contemplating approach; but  I ignored all save my own fixed purpose.    \"You must listen to what I have to say!\" I whispered.  \"If you  decline, I shall have no alternative but to call in the detective  who holds a warrant for your arrest!\"    She stood quite still, watching me coolly.  \"I suppose you would  wish to avoid a scene?\" I added.    \"You have already made me the object of much undesirable attention,\"  she replied scornfully.  \"I do not need your assurance that you  would disgrace me utterly!  You are talking nonsense, as you must  be aware--unless you are insane.  But if your object be to force  your acquaintance upon me, your methods are"]]]
