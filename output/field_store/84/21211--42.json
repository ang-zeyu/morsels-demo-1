She bounded  forward amid thunders of applause, and, lighting on one foot, remained  poised in the air. Heavens! was this the great enchantress that had  drawn monarchs at her chariot-wheels? Those heavy, muscular limbs,  those thick ankles, those cavernous eyes, that stereotyped smile, those  crudely painted cheeks! Where were the vermeil blooms, the liquid,  expressive eyes, the harmonious limbs of Animula?    The Signorina danced. What gross, discordant movements! The play of  her limbs was all false and artificial. Her bounds were painful athletic  efforts; her poses were angular and distressed the eye. I could bear it  no longer; with an exclamation of disgust that drew every eye upon me,  I rose from my seat in the very middle of the Signorina's  _pas-de-fascination_ and abruptly quitted the house.    I hastened home to feast my eyes once more on the lovely form of  my sylph. I felt that henceforth to combat this passion would be  impossible. I applied my eyes to the lens. Animula was there--but what  could have happened? Some terrible change seemed to have taken place  during my absence. Some secret grief seemed to cloud the lovely features  of her I gazed upon. Her face had grown thin and haggard; her limbs  trailed heavily; the wondrous lustre of her golden hair had faded. She  was ill--ill, and I could not assist her! I believe at that moment I  would have forfeited all claims to my human birthright if I could only  have been dwarfed to the size of an animalcule, and permitted to console  her from whom fate had forever divided me.    I racked my brain for the solution of this mystery. What was it that  afflicted the sylph? She seemed to suffer intense pain. Her features  contracted, and she even writhed, as if with some internal agony. The  wondrous forests appeared also to have lost half their beauty. Their  hues were dim and in some places faded away altogether. I watched  Animula for hours with a breaking heart, and she seemed absolutely to  wither away under my very eye. Suddenly I remembered that I had not  looked at the water-drop for several days. In fact, I hated to see it;  for it reminded me of the natural barrier between Animula and myself.  I hurriedly looked down on the stage of the microscope. The slide was  still there--but, great heavens, the water drop had vanished! The awful  truth burst upon me; it had evaporated, until it had become so minute  as to be invisible to the naked eye; I had been gazing on its last atom,  the one that contained Animula--and she was dying!    I rushed again to the front of the lens and looked through. Alas! the  last agony had seized her. The rainbow-hued forests had all melted away,  and Animula lay struggling feebly in what seemed to be a spot of dim  light. Ah! the sight was horrible: the limbs once so round and lovely  shriveling up into nothings; the eyes--those eyes that shone like  heaven--being quenched into black dust; the lustrous golden hair now  lank and discolored. The last throe came. I beheld that final struggle  of the blackening form--and I fainted.    When I awoke out of a trance of many hours, I found myself lying amid  the wreck of my instrument, myself as shattered in mind and body as it.  I crawled feebly to my bed, from which I did not rise for many months.    They say now that I am mad; but they are mistaken. I am poor, for I have  neither the heart nor the will to work; all my money is spent, and I  live on charity. Young men's associations that love a joke invite me to  lecture on optics before them, for which they pay me, and laugh at me  while I lecture. \"Linley, the mad microscopist,\" is the name I go by. I  suppose that I talk incoherently while I lecture. Who could talk sense  when his brain is haunted by such ghastly memories, while ever and anon  among the shapes of death I behold the radiant form of my lost Animula!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23186"],[0,"The Handbook to English Heraldry (#6)"],[1,"same ensigns on their shields,--and  they called them _Shields-of-Arms_: and in their Armorial Banners and  Pennons they again displayed the very same insignia, floating in the  wind high above their heads, from the shafts of their lances.    The Heraldry or Armory of England, an honourable and honoured member of  the illustrious family of mediæval European Heraldry, may be defined as  a symbolical and pictorial language, in which figures, devices, and  colours are employed instead of letters. Each heraldic composition has  its own definite and complete significance, conveyed through its direct  connection with some particular individual, family, dignity, or office.  Every such heraldic composition, also, is a true legal possession, held  and maintained by an express right and title: and it is hereditary, like  other real property, in accordance with certain laws and precedents of  inheritance. But in this respect heraldic insignia are singular and  unlike other property, inasmuch as it is a general rule that they cannot  be alienated, exchanged, or transferred otherwise than by inheritance or  other lawful succession. Exceptions to this rule, when they are observed  occasionally to have occurred, show clearly their own exceptional  character, and consequently they confirm the true authority of the rule  itself. It will be understood, as a necessary quality of its hereditary  nature, that the significance of an heraldic composition, while  \"definite and complete\" in itself, admits of augmentation and expansion  through its association with successive generations. Thus, the Royal  Shield of EDWARD III. is \"complete\" as the heraldic symbol of that great  monarch, and of the realm under his rule: and yet this same shield,  equally \"complete\" (with one simple modification) as the heraldic symbol  of each successive Sovereign till the death of ELIZABETH, has its  significance infinitely augmented and expanded through its hereditary  association with all the Sovereigns of the Houses of Plantagenet and  Tudor.    Until the concluding quarter of the twelfth century, the traces of the  existence of Heraldry are faint and few in number. Early in the  thirteenth century the new science began to establish itself firmly  amongst our ancestors of that age; and it is certain that, as soon as  its character and capabilities were in any degree understood aright, it  grew speedily into favour; so that in the reign of HENRY III. (A.D.  1216-1272) Heraldry in England had confirmed its own claims to be  regarded as a Science, by being in possession of a system, and a  classification of its own.    The Crusades, those extraordinary confederacies without a parallel in  the history of civilised nations, were themselves so thoroughly a matter  of religious chivalry, that it was only an inevitable result of their  existence that they should give a powerful impulse to the establishment  and development of Heraldry in its early days.    But Heraldry, from the time of its first appearance in England, was  found to be valuable for other uses besides those which so intimately  connected it with both real and imitative warfare, with the fierce  life-and-death conflict of the battle-field, and with the scarcely less  perilous struggle for honour and renown in the lists. Very soon after  the Norman Conquest, in consequence of their presence being required to  give validity to every species of legal document, SEALS became  instruments of the greatest importance; and it was soon obvious that  heraldic insignia, with a representation of the knightly shield upon  which they were displayed, were exactly suited to satisfy every  requirement of the seal-engraver. By such means Heraldry became  interwoven as well with the peaceful concerns of everyday life, as with  the display of martial splendour and the turmoil of war.    Many attempts have been made to set aside the opinion that the Heraldry  of the Middle Ages in England was a fresh creation, a production of  indigenous growth: and great is the ingenuity that has been brought into  action to carry back the Heraldry of our own country from the  commencement of the thirteenth century through the previous elementary  stages of its existence, in order to trace its direct lineal descent  from certain decorative and symbolical devices that were in use at much  earlier periods. The careful and diligent researches, however, of the  most learned Heralds have at present led them almost unanimously to  reject all such theories as these, as speculative and uncertain. At the  same time, it is an indisputable fact that, in all ages of the world,  and amongst all races of men, some form of symbolical expression has  been both in use and in favour. And it is equally true that this  symbolism, whatever it may have been, has generally been found in some  way associated with a military life and with the act of warfare.  Soldiers, and particularly those in high command, have always delighted  to adorn their shields with devices that sometimes were significant of  their own condition or exploits, or sometimes had reference to their  country, or even to their families; and, in like manner, it has been a  universal custom to display similar devices and figures in military  standards of all kinds. At the time of the Conquest, as is shown in the  famous Bayeux Tapestry of the Conqueror's Consort, the shields and  standards of both Normans and Anglo-Saxons were painted, and perhaps the  latter were embroidered, with various figures and devices; but certainly  without any heraldic significance or any personal associations being  indicated by these figures and devices, which bear a general resemblance  to the insignia of the Legions and Cohorts of Imperial Rome. Figures  Nos. 5 and 6 give representations of the standards that are introduced  into the Bayeux Tapestry. The same species of decoration, consisting  chiefly of painted patterns, with discs, stars, crescents, and some  other figures, continued in use in our own country until superseded by a  true Heraldry; and may also be assumed to have prevailed in England in  much earlier times.      [Illustration: Nos. 5 and 6.--Lance Flags--Bayeux Tapestry.]    In still more remote ages a more decided heraldic system was displayed  upon signets, coins, shields, and standards. In this ancient Heraldry,  if so it may be termed, occasionally the important and characteristic  quality of hereditary association in certain devices is apparent. Thus,  Virgil (Æneid, vii. 657) assigns to Aventinus \"_insigne paternum_\" upon  his shield--his hereditary device, derived by him from his father. But  these devices generally appear to have their significance in a greater  or a less degree restricted, amongst the ancients, to certain particular  incidents; consequently in all these examples there is nothing to show  that the man who bore one device at one time, did not bear another  device at another time.[1] For example, Æschylus, the Greek tragedian  (B.C. 600), has recorded that Capaneus, when attacking the city of  Thebes, bore on his shield the figure of a warrior carrying a lighted  torch, with the motto, \"I will fire the city!\" But, on another occasion,  we have reason to believe that the same Capaneus bore quite a different  device, applicable to that other occasion; and this deprives these  ancient devices, heraldic as they are in their general character, of  that special personal association which true Heraldry requires and,  indeed, implies. The beautiful painted vases, the works of Greek  artists, that are discovered in such extraordinary numbers and in  perfect preservation in some parts of Italy, constantly give most  striking representations of the shields of ancient Greek warriors and  other personages, with what appear heraldic devices displayed upon them.  These shields illustrate, in a remarkable manner, both the appropriate  significance of particular devices, and the usage then prevalent for a  variety of devices to be borne on different occasions by the same  individual. Shields upon vases in the collections in the Museum of the  Louvre at Paris, and in the British Museum, where they are easy of  access, contain a great variety of devices. The examples, Nos. 7, 8, 9,  and 10, are from our own National Collections. No. 7, the shield black,  the border and the pegasus red; No. 8, the shield black, and the two  dolphins white; No. 9, the shield black, with a border adorned with red  discs, the serpent white; No. 10, the shield black, with purple border,  the three human legs conjoined white. The shields, Nos. 9 and 10, are  both borne by the goddess +ATHÊNÊ+ (Minerva); and the remarkable device  displayed on No. 10 is also found on the coins of ancient Sicily. Other  similar shields display lions, horses, dogs, wild boars, fish, birds,  clusters of leaves, chariots and chariot-wheels, votive tripods,  serpents, scorpions, with many others, including occasional examples  of human figures. In another collection I have seen an anchor and an  Amazon's bow. A device differing from that in No. 10 only in having the  conjoined limbs in armour, will be found in our own English Heraldry to  be the armorial ensign of the Isle of Man.        [Footnote 1: In his \"Hand-book of Engraved Gems,\" Mr. King maintains      that \"the devices on the signets of the ancients were both      hereditary and unalterable, like our armorial bearings;\" but, at the      same time, he admits that the \"armorial bearings,\" which appear \"on      the shields of the Grecian heroes in the most ancient pictures      extant, the Vase-paintings,\" \"seem to have been assumed at the      caprice of the individual, like the knight's _cognisances_ at      tournaments in the days of chivalry, and not to have been      hereditary.\" --\"Hand-book,\" page 216. Almost immediately, however,      Mr. King adds, that traditions exist which represent the mythic      heroes bearing \"engraved on their signets the same devices"]]]
