Here the telegraph was set  in motion, asking Hurst Castle for news of the _Aurania_. But there was  no news, so, as it would take her two hours to reach Southampton after  passing the Castle, we went on past green promontories that dip into the  sea, right up to where the trees clothe them, past the towers of  Osborne, to Ryde. Again the telegraph asked the question, and again  there was a negative answer. Then we cut across the Solent towards  Southsea, watching the weird evolutions of a 35-knot torpedo-boat. It  darted about, annihilating the small distances of the Solent and making  a strange, buzzing noise like some foul fly. Vomiting flames and sparks,  it trailed a cloud in the air and snow upon the water. While we were  crawling across the river it had made a dozen journeys. Now it would be  down near Cowes, and now half-way up Southampton Water, and when one  looked again a few minutes afterwards it would be close astern,  overtaking us with the speed of a nightmare. I escaped from it at  Southsea, for there the wires told me something that sent me doubling to  the railway station, and thanking my stars that I was in time for a fast  train to Southampton. It arrived at half-past three, and at four the  _Aurania_ showed her nose round the corner of a dock shed. Ten minutes  later she was alongside and berthed, and the disembarkation began.    The total absence of any kind of popular demonstration was most  impressive. There was no crowd at all, and the barriers that had been  provided were not needed. This neglect of a welcome seemed sadly to  discount the value of the great hysterical demonstrations made when the  troops departed. They were men who were perhaps going to suffer for  their country. These invalids had suffered for it, and no one came to  cheer them up. Of course some of the men's own friends were there, and  the few strangers who were present shook hands with the men as they came  limping and hopping and stumbling down the gangway. But it was all very  quiet, very sad, very tame from a spectator's point of view, but deeply  significant. One could hardly imagine a greater contrast than was  presented by the same shed on a day of departure and on a day of arrival  like this. In the one case great crowds hurrahing and shouting and  cheering, bands playing, and bottles going busily round. In the other a  great quietness, a few people standing in little knots and speaking  almost in undertones. And the men themselves were very different. No  excitement, of course; no drunkenness; no yelling for \"Kroojer's  whiskers.\" Oh, no!--something very different from that. About a hundred  men with pain-worn faces, bandaged arms and legs, slings and splints  everywhere, and talking, when they talked at all, of the horrors of the  war, of the death of comrades, and of the seriousness of the news we  gave them, in the light of their own experiences at the front. The men  were speedily disembarked and taken into the dock shed where a train  with some ambulance coaches was waiting, but they preferred to stand and  talk for a little while before taking their seats. A really kind and  useful work was done by members of the Southampton branch of the  \"Absent-minded Beggars\" relief corps, who provided hot coffee and buns  for the men, and in addition provided each with a stamped telegraph  form, so that he might reassure his friends at home.    Of course there was another beside the serious aspect of this scene.  Nothing could exceed the interest in their ailments displayed by the men  who had partly recovered from them, and those whose wounds had healed  could not tire of giving demonstrations to their friends and relations,  or even to strangers. An illness or a wound is often the first view an  ignorant man gets of Nature's ingenuity displayed in the construction of  his own person, and when one of these invalids got hold of some medical  or surgical word he would cherish and roll it on his tongue like a man  tasting wine. One of them--a man who looked as strong as a horse--was  explaining to an admiring group how he came to be alive at all. A bullet  had passed through the rim of his helmet, entered his left temple,  passed behind his nose, through the roof of his mouth, and out through  the lower part of his right cheek. First he would show us the dent in  his temple; then describe, with many strange words, the inward passage  of the bullet; and then, emerging into the sphere of common things, wind  up with, \"and came out of my blooming cheek.\" Then he would show the  dent in his cheek, and pass his helmet round for all to see, as a  conjurer does. I moved round with this man and heard him recite his tale  three times, and every time he used just the same form of words, which  he repeated pat like a lesson. His corruption of \"cerebral\" was amusing.  \"Nearly scattered the cerveral nerve, so help me!\" he said. One could  have understood it if he had been in the Spanish-American war. Another  soldier used a word which I cannot explain. He was showing a mate how a  bullet had entered his shoulder, \"and,\" said he, \"it penetrated me  agamemnon.\" What is an agamemnon? It has been puzzling me ever since.    Only a few of the more robust men were going on in this way, and there  was enough of the pathetic even in the man with the \"cerveral\" nerve and  him with the \"agamemnon.\" The men looked tired and serious, and seemed  to lack interest in anything but their own afflictions. It is almost a  pity that the public will not witness such scenes as this, for I fear  that it is still sadly in need of having even the most elementary fruits  of war brought home to it. One might, of course, easily overdraw the  picture of the men's condition; it is difficult to describe it  faithfully. Many of them seemed happy and contented to be home again,  and forgot past pains in present joy. As I turned away from the carriage  window I heard a confused drone of conversation, in which such terms as  \"ligature,\" \"suppuration,\" \"cavity of the hear'ole,\" \"styptic,\" and  \"prelatic\" were prominent. The last thing I heard was--\"He hadn't got no  fraxur at all, leastways only a simple un. Mine was a compound fraxur.\"  One can understand these things. But what is an \"agamemnon\"?    It was dark when the train went away, and there was nothing more for me  to see on that day, but I had another sensation and a memorable one.  After dinner a little group, composed mainly of naval and military  officers on embarkation duty, was established round the smoke-room fire  in the South Western Hotel. We were all talking about the war, and all  wishing that we were out in the thick of it. In the midst of this chorus  of aspiration a telegram was handed to me inviting me to go to South  Africa as a war correspondent for the _Manchester Guardian_. The chorus  continued while I read, but it sounded far away; I was trying to realise  what acquiescence in the request contained on the pink paper might mean.  When I had decided I handed the telegram to my neighbour, and in a  moment it had made the circuit of the group, trailing exclamations in  its wake and changing the melancholy chorus to one of whole-hearted  envy. I went to bed in some doubt as to whether I had received  congratulations or condolences. In a few hours I was on my way to  London; in a few days the flying wheels had carried me back to  Southampton; but I thought that the busy docks wore a different face.          PART II    IN THE WAKE OF THE ARMY          IV    THE LONG SEA ROAD      In the terms of the street, you make for Madeira from the Needles as  straight as Ushant and Finisterre will permit, keep to the left until  you catch the flare of the solitary light on Cape Verde, go on past that  for about ten days, and Cape Town is the last place on the left. In the  terms of the sea, your course is west-south-west until the Bay is open,  then south-south-west, then south, and then south by east a half-east  for the long stretch. But for most of us the way to the war lay through  a stranger region than that. Years ago (as it seems) on a rainy winter  evening, we watched the buoys of the Solent Channel streaming past us  all aslope on the strong ebb-tide, and as the Trinity Brothers began to  open their eyes for an all-night watch on the south coast, we closed  ours to the world behind.    A day and night of dust and tumble in the Bay, and we awoke on a summer  morning to find the wind blowing softly through the open ports and the  water chiming on the ship's side. After that we lived in a world all our  own; ourselves the sum and centre of it; a blue world that slid through  degrees of latitude and longitude, but held us, its inhabitants, at ever  the same distance from realities. The past was miles away at the end of  the white path astern; the future did not yet so much as smudge the  forward horizon; we were adrift, lost in the present.    Since we were, for the most part, Englishmen, we played games. At first  we had walked about eyeing one another mistrustfully; but Time, the  surest of teachers, soon convinced us of the essential harmlessness of  our fellows. And then we played quoits, and danced and listened to the  band, forgetting the things which were behind and disregarding (for the  moment) the things which were before. Disregarding, but not quite  forgetting. When the last game was over and the last pipe lighted, and  the good, cool hours drew on, men used to sit in little groups watching  the flash of waves tripping and spilling over smooth black furrows; and  then they talked. The C.I.V. officers talked of Lee-Enfields,  trajectories, mass and volley firing; the Indian Staff Corps men, who  were going out on special service, spoke of commissariat and transport,  of standing patrols and Cossack posts, of bivouacks, entrenchments,  vedettes, contact squadrons, tactical sub-units,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2388"],[0,"The Song Celestial; Or, Bhagavad-Gîtâ (from the Mahâbhârata) (#6)"],[1," ascetics, higher than the wise,    Beyond achievers of vast deeds! Be thou    Yogi Arjuna! And of such believe,    Truest and best is he who worships Me    With inmost soul, stayed on My Mystery!      HERE ENDETH CHAPTER VI. OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,    Entitled \"Atmasanyamayog,\"    Or \"The Book of Religion by Self-Restraint.\"            CHAPTER VII        Krishna.    Learn now, dear Prince! how, if thy soul be set    Ever on Me--still exercising Yog,    Still making Me thy Refuge--thou shalt come    Most surely unto perfect hold of Me.    I will declare to thee that utmost lore,    Whole and particular, which, when thou knowest,    Leaveth no more to know here in this world.      Of many thousand mortals, one, perchance,    Striveth for Truth; and of those few that strive--    Nay, and rise high--one only--here and there--    Knoweth Me, as I am, the very Truth.      Earth, water, flame, air, ether, life, and mind,    And individuality--those eight    Make up the showing of Me, Manifest.      These be my lower Nature; learn the higher,    Whereby, thou Valiant One! this Universe    Is, by its principle of life, produced;    Whereby the worlds of visible things are born    As from a Yoni. Know! I am that womb:    I make and I unmake this Universe:    Than me there is no other Master, Prince!    No other Maker! All these hang on me    As hangs a row of pearls upon its string.    I am the fresh taste of the water; I    The silver of the moon, the gold o' the sun,    The word of worship in the Veds, the thrill    That passeth in the ether, and the strength    Of man's shed seed. I am the good sweet smell    Of the moistened earth, I am the fire's red light,    The vital air moving in all which moves,    The holiness of hallowed souls, the root    Undying, whence hath sprung whatever is;    The wisdom of the wise, the intellect    Of the informed, the greatness of the great.    The splendour of the splendid. Kunti's Son!    These am I, free from passion and desire;    Yet am I right desire in all who yearn,    Chief of the Bharatas! for all those moods,    Soothfast, or passionate, or ignorant,    Which Nature frames, deduce from me; but all    Are merged in me--not I in them! The world--    Deceived by those three qualities of being--    Wotteth not Me Who am outside them all,    Above them all, Eternal! Hard it is    To pierce that veil divine of various shows    Which hideth Me; yet they who worship Me    Pierce it and pass beyond.      I am not known    To evil-doers, nor to foolish ones,    Nor to the base and churlish; nor to those    Whose mind is cheated by the show of things,    Nor those that take the way of Asuras.[FN#12]      Four sorts of mortals know me: he who weeps,    Arjuna! and the man who yearns to know;    And he who toils to help; and he who sits    Certain of me, enlightened.      Of these four,    O Prince of India! highest, nearest, best    That last is, the devout soul, wise, intent    Upon \"The One.\" Dear, above all, am I    To him; and he is dearest unto me!    All four are good, and seek me; but mine own,    The true of heart, the faithful--stayed on me,    Taking me as their utmost blessedness,    They are not \"mine,\"but I--even I myself!    At end of many births to Me they come!    Yet hard the wise Mahatma is to find,    That man who sayeth, \"All is Vasudev!\"[FN#13]      There be those, too, whose knowledge, turned aside    By this desire or that, gives them to serve    Some lower gods, with various rites, constrained    By that which mouldeth them. Unto all such--    Worship what shrine they will, what shapes, in faith--    'Tis I who give them faith! I am content!    The heart thus asking favour from its God,    Darkened but ardent, hath the end it craves,    The lesser blessing--but 'tis I who give!    Yet soon is withered what small fruit they reap:    Those men of little minds, who worship so,    Go where they worship, passing with their gods.    But Mine come unto me! Blind are the eyes    Which deem th' Unmanifested manifest,    Not comprehending Me in my true Self!    Imperishable, viewless, undeclared,    Hidden behind my magic veil of shows,    I am not seen by all; I am not known--    Unborn and changeless--to the idle world.    But I, Arjuna! know all things which were,    And all which are, and all which are to be,    Albeit not one among them knoweth Me!      By passion for the \"pairs of opposites,\"    By those twain snares of Like and Dislike, Prince!    All creatures live bewildered, save some few    Who, quit of sins, holy in act, informed,    Freed from the \"opposites,\"and fixed in faith,    Cleave unto Me.      Who cleave, who seek in Me    Refuge from birth[FN#14] and death, those have the Truth!    Those know Me BRAHMA; know Me Soul of Souls,    The ADHYATMAN; know KARMA, my work;    Know I am ADHIBHUTA, Lord of Life,    And ADHIDAIVA, Lord of all the Gods,    And ADHIYAJNA, Lord of Sacrifice;    Worship Me well, with hearts of love and faith,    And find and hold me in the hour of death.      HERE ENDETH CHAPTER VII. OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,    Entitled \"Vijnanayog,\"    Or \"The Book of Religion by Discernment.\"            CHAPTER VIII        Arjuna.    Who is that BRAHMA? What that Soul of Souls,    The ADHYATMAN? What, Thou Best of All!    Thy work, the KARMA? Tell me what it is    Thou namest ADHIBHUTA? What again    Means ADHIDAIVA? Yea, and how it comes    Thou canst be ADHIYAJNA in thy flesh?    Slayer of Madhu! Further, make me know    How good men find thee in the hour of death?      Krishna.    I BRAHMA am! the One Eternal GOD,    And ADHYATMAN is My Being's name,    The Soul of Souls! What goeth forth from Me,    Causing all life to live, is KARMA called:    And, Manifested in divided forms,    I am the ADHIBHUTA, Lord of Lives;    And ADHIDAIVA, Lord of all the Gods,    Because I am PURUSHA, who begets.    And ADHIYAJNA, Lord of Sacrifice,    I--speaking with thee in this body here--    Am, thou embodied one! (for all the shrines    Flame unto Me!) And, at the hour of death,    He that hath meditated Me alone,    In putting off his flesh, comes forth to Me,    Enters into My Being--doubt thou not!    But, if he meditated otherwise    At hour of death, in putting off the flesh,    He goes to what he looked for, Kunti's Son!    Because the Soul is fashioned to its like.      Have Me, then, in thy heart always! and fight!    Thou too, when heart and mind are fixed on Me,    Shalt surely come to Me! All come who cleave    With never-wavering will of firmest faith,    Owning none other Gods: all come to Me,    The Uttermost, Purusha, Holiest!      Whoso hath known Me, Lord of sage and singer,       Ancient of days; of all the Three Worlds Stay,    Boundless,--but unto every atom Bringer       Of that which quickens it: whoso, I say,      Hath known My form, which passeth mortal knowing;      Seen my effulgence--which no eye hath seen--    Than the sun's burning gold more brightly glowing,      Dispersing darkness,--unto him hath been      Right life! And, in the hour when life is ending,      With mind set fast and trustful piety,    Drawing still breath beneath calm brows unbending,      In happy peace that faithful one doth die,--      In glad peace passeth to Purusha's heaven.       The place which they who read the Vedas name    AKSHARAM, \"Ultimate;\" whereto have striven       Saints and ascetics--their road is the same.      That way--the highest way--goes he who shuts    The gates of all his senses, locks desire    Safe in his heart, centres the vital airs    Upon his parting thought, steadfastly set;    And, murmuring OM, the sacred syllable--    Emblem of BRAHM--dies, meditating Me.      For who, none other Gods regarding, looks    Ever to Me, easily am I gained    By such a Yogi; and, attaining Me,    They fall not--those Mahatmas--back to birth,    To life, which is the place of pain, which ends,    But take the way of utmost blessedness.      The worlds, Arjuna!--even Brahma's world--    Roll back again from Death to Life's unrest;    But they, O Kunti's Son! that reach to Me,    Taste birth no more. If ye know Brahma's Day    Which is a thousand Yugas; if ye know    The thousand Yugas making Brahma's Night,    Then know ye Day and Night as He doth know!    When that vast Dawn doth break, th' Invisible    Is brought anew into the Visible;    When that deep Night doth darken, all which is    Fades back again to Him Who sent it forth;    Yea! this vast company of living things--    Again and yet again produced--expires    At Brahma's Nightfall; and, at Brahma's Dawn,    Riseth, without its will, to life new-born.    But--higher, deeper, innermost--abides    Another Life, not like the life of sense,    Escaping sight, unchanging. This endures    When all created things have passed away:    This is that Life named the Unmanifest,    The Infinite! the All! the Uttermost.    Thither arriving none return. That Life    Is Mine, and I am there! And, Prince! by faith    Which wanders not, there is a way to come    Thither. I, the PURUSHA, I Who spread    The Universe around me--in Whom dwell    All living Things--may so be reached and seen!      .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    . [FN#14]      Richer than holy fruit on Vedas growing,       Greater than gifts, better than prayer or fast,    Such wisdom is! The Yogi, this way knowing,       Comes to the Utmost Perfect Peace at last.      HERE ENDETH CHAPTER VIII. OF THE  BHAGAVAD-GITA,    Entitled  \"Aksharaparabrahmayog,\"    Or \"The book of Religion by Devotion to the One Supreme God.\"            CHAPTER IX        Krishna.    Now will I open unto thee--whose heart    Rejects not--that last lore, deepest-concealed,    That farthest secret of My Heavens and Earths,    Which but to know shall set thee free from ills,--    A royal lore! a Kingly mystery!    Yea! for the soul such light as purgeth it    From every sin; a light of holiness    With inmost splendour shining; plain to see; "]]]
