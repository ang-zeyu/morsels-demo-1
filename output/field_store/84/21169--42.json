All those who    saw her stood for a time terror-struck; and then they found the    babe was dead.[25]    The second story will serve as an illustration of one of the Russian  customs with respect to the dead, and also of the ideas about  witchcraft, still prevalent in Russia. We may create for it the title  of--        THE DEAD WITCH.[26]      There was once an old woman who was a terrible witch, and    she had a daughter and a granddaughter. The time came for    the old crone to die, so she summoned her daughter and gave    her these instructions:      \"Mind, daughter! when I'm dead, don't you wash my body    with lukewarm water; but fill a cauldron, make it boil its very    hottest, and then with that boiling water regularly scald me all    over.\"      After saying this, the witch lay ill two or three days, and    then died. The daughter ran round to all her neighbors, begging    them to come and help her to wash the old woman, and    meantime the little granddaughter was left all alone in the cottage.    And this is what she saw there. All of a sudden there    crept out from beneath the stove two demons--a big one and    a tiny one--and they ran up to the dead witch. The old demon    seized her by the feet, and tore away at her so that he stripped    off all her skin at one pull. Then he said to the little demon:      \"Take the flesh for yourself, and lug it under the stove.\"      So the little demon flung his arms round the carcase, and    dragged it under the stove. Nothing was left of the old woman    but her skin. Into it the old demon inserted himself, and then    he lay down just where the witch had been lying.      Presently the daughter came back, bringing a dozen other    women with her, and they all set to work laying out the corpse.      \"Mammy,\" says the child, \"they've pulled granny's skin off    while you were away.\"      \"What do you mean by telling such lies?\"      \"It's quite true, Mammy! There was ever such a blackie    came from under the stove, and he pulled the skin off, and got    into it himself.\"      \"Hold your tongue, naughty child! you're talking nonsense!\"    cried the old crone's daughter; then she fetched a big cauldron,    filled it with cold water, put it on the stove, and heated it till it    boiled furiously. Then the women lifted up the old crone, laid    her in a trough, took hold of the cauldron, and poured the whole    of the boiling water over her at once. The demon couldn't    stand it. He leaped out of the trough, dashed through the    doorway, and disappeared, skin and all. The women stared:      \"What marvel is this?\" they cried. \"Here was the dead    woman, and now she isn't here. There's nobody left to lay out    or to bury. The demons have carried her off before our very    eyes!\"[27]    A Russian peasant funeral is preceded or accompanied by a  considerable amount of wailing, which answers in some respect to the  Irish \"keening.\" To the _zaplachki_,[28] or laments, which are uttered  on such occasions--frequently by hired wailers, who closely resemble  the Corsican \"vociferators,\" the modern Greek \"myrologists\"--allusions  are sometimes made in the Skazkas. In the \"Fox-wailer,\"[29] for  example--one of the variants of the well-known \"Jack and the  Beanstalk\" story--an old man puts his wife in a bag and attempts to  carry her up the beanstalk to heaven. Becoming tired on the way, he  drops the bag, and the old woman is killed. After weeping over her  dead body he sets out in search of a Wailer. Meeting a bear, he cries,  \"Wail a bit, Bear, for my old woman! I'll give you a pair of nice  white fowls.\" The bear growls out \"Oh, dear granny of mine! how I  grieve for thee!\" \"No, no!\" says the old man, \"you can't wail.\" Going  a little further he tries a wolf, but the wolf succeeds no better than  the bear. At last a fox comes by, and on being appealed to, begins to  cry aloud \"Turu-Turu, grandmother! grandfather has killed thee!\"--a  wail which pleases the widower so much that he hands over the fowls to  the fox at once, and asks, enraptured, for \"that strain again!\"[30]    One of the most curious of the stories which relate to a village  burial,--one in which also the feeling with which the Russian  villagers sometimes regard their clergy finds expression--is that  called--        THE TREASURE.[31]      In a certain kingdom there lived an old couple in great poverty.    Sooner or later the old woman died. It was in winter, in severe    and frosty weather. The old man went round to his friends and    neighbors, begging them to help him to dig a grave for the old    woman; but his friends and neighbors, knowing his great poverty,    all flatly refused. The old man went to the pope,[32] (but in that    village they had an awfully grasping pope, one without any    conscience), and says he:--      \"Lend a hand, reverend father, to get my old woman buried.\"      \"But have you got any money to pay for the funeral? if    so, friend, pay up beforehand!\"      \"It's no use hiding anything from you. Not a single copeck    have I at home. But if you'll wait a little, I'll earn some, and    then I'll pay you with interest--on my word I'll pay you!\"      The pope wouldn't so much as listen to the old man.      \"If you haven't any money, don't you dare to come here,\"    says he.      \"What's to be done?\" thinks the old man. \"I'll go to the    graveyard, dig a grave as I best can, and bury the old woman    myself.\" So he took an axe and a shovel, and went to the graveyard.    When he got there he began to prepare a grave. He    chopped away the frozen ground on the top with the axe, and    then he took to the shovel. He dug and dug, and at last he dug    out a metal pot. Looking into it he saw that it was stuffed full    of ducats that shone like fire. The old man was immensely delighted,    and cried, \"Glory be to Thee, O Lord! I shall have    wherewithal both to bury my old woman, and to perform the    rites of remembrance.\"      He did not go on digging the grave any longer, but took the    pot of gold and carried it home. Well, we all know what money    will do--everything went as smooth as oil! In a trice there    were found good folks to dig the grave and fashion the coffin.    The old man sent his daughter-in-law to purchase meat and    drink and different kind of relishes--everything there ought to    be at memorial feasts--and he himself took a ducat in his hand    and hobbled back again to the pope's. The moment he reached    the door, out flew the pope at him.      \"You were distinctly told, you old lout, that you were not to    come here without money; and now you've slunk back again.\"      \"Don't be angry, batyushka,\"[33] said the old man imploringly.    \"Here's gold for you. If you'll only bury my old woman, I'll    never forget your kindness.\"      The pope took the money, and didn't know how best to    receive the old man, where to seat him, with what words to    smooth him down. \"Well now, old friend! Be of good cheer;    everything shall be done,\" said he.      The old man made his bow, and went home, and the pope    and his wife began talking about him.      \"There now, the old hunks!\" they say. \"So poor, forsooth,    so poor! And yet he's paid a gold piece. Many a defunct    person of quality have I buried in my time, but I never got so    from anyone before.\"      The pope got under weigh with all his retinue, and buried    the old crone in proper style. After the funeral the old man    invited him to his house, to take part in the feast in memory of    the dead. Well, they entered the cottage, and sat down to table--and    there appeared from somewhere or other meat and drink    and all sorts of snacks, everything in profusion. The (reverend)    guest sat down, ate for three people, looked greedily at what    was not his. The (other) guests finished their meal, and separated    to go to their homes; then the pope also rose from the    table. The old man went to speed him on his way. As soon    as they got into the farmyard, and the pope saw they were alone    at last, he began questioning the old man: \"Listen, friend!    confess to me, don't leave so much as a single sin on your soul--it's    just the same before me as before God! How have you    managed to get on at such a pace? You used to be a poor    moujik, and now--marry! where did it come from? Confess,    friend, whose breath have you stopped? whom have you    pillaged?\"      \"What are you talking about, batyushka? I will tell you the    exact truth. I have not robbed, nor plundered, nor killed anyone.    A treasure tumbled into my hands of its own accord.\"      And he told him how it all happened. When the pope    heard these words he actually shook all over with greediness.    Going home, he did nothing by night and by day but think,    \"That such a wretched lout of a moujik should have come in    for such a lump of money! Is there any way of tricking him    now, and getting this pot of money out of him?\" He told his    wife about it, and he and she discussed the matter together, and    held counsel over it.      \"Listen, mother,\" says he; \"we've a goat, haven't we?\"      \"Yes.\"      \"All right, then; we'll wait until it's night, and then we'll do    the job properly.\"      Late in the evening the pope dragged the goat indoors, killed    it, and took off its skin--horns, beard, and all complete. Then    he pulled the goat's skin over himself and said to his wife:      \"Bring a needle and thread, mother, and fasten up the skin    all round, so that it mayn't slip off.\"      So she took a strong needle, and some tough thread, and    sewed him up in the goatskin. Well, at the dead of night, the    pope went straight to the old man's cottage, got under the window,    and began knocking and scratching. The old man hearing    the noise, jumped up and asked:      \"Who's there?\"      \"The Devil!\"      \"Ours is a holy spot!["]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22381"],[0,"Myths and Legends of Ancient Greece and Rome (#6)"],[1,"under-bolts, just ready to be hurled,  whilst in the other he holds the lightning. The head is frequently  encircled with a wreath of oak-leaves.    [Illustration]    The most celebrated statue of the Olympian Zeus was that by the famous  Athenian sculptor Phidias, which was forty feet high, and stood in the  temple of Zeus at Olympia. It was formed of ivory and gold, and was {29}  such a masterpiece of art, that it was reckoned among the seven wonders of  the world. It represented the god, seated on a throne, holding in his right  hand a life-sized image of Nike (the goddess of Victory), and in his left a  royal sceptre, surmounted by an eagle. It is said that the great sculptor  had concentrated all the marvellous powers of his genius on this sublime  conception, and earnestly entreated Zeus to give him a decided proof that  his labours were approved. An answer to his prayer came through the open  roof of the temple in the shape of a flash of lightning, which Phidias  interpreted as a sign that the god of heaven was pleased with his work.    Zeus was first worshipped at Dodona in Epirus, where, at the foot of Mount  Tomarus, on the woody shore of Lake Joanina, was his famous oracle, the  most ancient in Greece. Here the voice of the eternal and invisible god was  supposed to be heard in the rustling leaves of a giant oak, announcing to  mankind the will of heaven and the destiny of mortals; these revelations  being interpreted to the people by the priests of Zeus, who were called  Selli. Recent excavations which have been made at this spot have brought to  light the ruins of the ancient temple of Zeus, and also, among other  interesting relics, some plates of lead, on which are engraved inquiries  which were evidently made by certain individuals who consulted the oracle.  These little leaden plates speak to us, as it were, in a curiously homely  manner of a by-gone time in the buried past. One person inquires what god  he should apply to for health and fortune; another asks for advice  concerning his child; and a third, evidently a shepherd, promises a gift to  the oracle should a speculation in sheep turn out successfully. Had these  little memorials been of gold instead of lead, they would doubtless have  shared the fate of the numerous treasures which adorned this and other  temples, in the universal pillage which took place when Greece fell into  the hands of barbarians.    Though Dodona was the most ancient of his shrines, the great national seat  of the worship of Zeus was at Olympia in Elis, where there was a  magnificent temple {30} dedicated to him, containing the famous colossal  statue by Phidias above described. Crowds of devout worshippers flocked to  this world-renowned fane from all parts of Greece, not only to pay homage  to their supreme deity, but also to join in the celebrated games which were  held there at intervals of four years. The Olympic games were such a  thoroughly national institution, that even Greeks who had left their native  country made a point of returning on these occasions, if possible, in order  to contend with their fellow-countrymen in the various athletic sports  which took place at these festivals.    It will be seen on reflection that in a country like Greece, which  contained so many petty states, often at variance with each other, these  national gatherings must have been most valuable as a means of uniting the  Greeks in one great bond of brotherhood. On these festive occasions the  whole nation met together, forgetting for the moment all past differences,  and uniting in the enjoyment of the same festivities.    It will doubtless have been remarked that in the representations of Zeus he  is always accompanied by an eagle. This royal bird was sacred to him,  probably from the fact of its being the only creature capable of gazing at  the sun without being dazzled, which may have suggested the idea that it  was able to contemplate the splendour of divine majesty unshrinkingly.    The oak-tree, and also the summits of mountains, were sacred to Zeus. His  sacrifices consisted of white bulls, cows, and goats.    Zeus had seven immortal wives, whose names were Metis, Themis, Eurynome,  Demeter, Mnemosyne, Leto, and Hera.    METIS, his first wife, was one of the Oceanides or sea-nymphs. She was the  personification of prudence and wisdom, a convincing proof of which she  displayed in her successful administration of the potion which caused  Cronus to yield up his children. She was endowed with the gift of prophecy,  and foretold to Zeus that one of their children would gain ascendency over  {31} him. In order, therefore, to avert the possibility of the prediction  being fulfilled he swallowed her before any children were born to them.  Feeling afterwards violent pains in his head, he sent for Hephaestus, and  ordered him to open it with an axe. His command was obeyed, and out sprang,  with a loud and martial shout, a beautiful being, clad in armour from head  to foot. This was Athene (Minerva), goddess of Armed Resistance and Wisdom.    THEMIS was the goddess of Justice, Law, and Order.    EURYNOME was one of the Oceanides, and the mother of the Charites or  Graces.    DEMETER,[13] the daughter of Cronus and Rhea, was the goddess of  Agriculture.    MNEMOSYNE, the daughter of Uranus and Gaea, was the goddess of Memory and  the mother of the nine Muses.    LETO (Latona) was the daughter of Coeus and Phoebe. She was gifted with  wonderful beauty, and was tenderly loved by Zeus, but her lot was far from  being a happy one, for Hera, being extremely jealous of her, persecuted her  with inveterate cruelty, and sent the dreadful serpent Python[14] to  terrify and torment her wherever she went. But Zeus, who had observed with  the deepest compassion her weary wanderings and agonized fears, resolved to  create for her some place of refuge, however humble, where she might feel  herself safe from the venomous attacks of the serpent. He therefore brought  her to Delos, a floating island in the AEgean Sea, which he made stationary  by attaching it with chains of adamant to the bottom of the sea. Here she  gave birth to her twin-children, Apollo and Artemis (Diana), two of the  most beautiful of the immortals.    According to some versions of the story of Leto, Zeus transformed her into  a quail, in order that she might thus elude the vigilance of Hera, and she  is said to have {32} resumed her true form when she arrived at the island  of Delos.    HERA, being the principal wife of Zeus and queen of heaven, a detailed  account will be given of her in a special chapter.    In the union of Zeus with most of his immortal wives we shall find that an  allegorical meaning is conveyed. His marriage with Metis, who is said to  have surpassed both gods and men in knowledge, represents supreme power  allied to wisdom and prudence. His union with Themis typifies the bond  which exists between divine majesty and justice, law, and order. Eurynome,  as the mother of the Charites or Graces, supplied the refining and  harmonizing influences of grace and beauty, whilst the marriage of Zeus  with Mnemosyne typifies the union of genius with memory.           *       *       *       *       *    In addition to the seven immortal wives of Zeus, he was also allied to a  number of mortal maidens whom he visited under various disguises, as it was  supposed that if he revealed himself in his true form as king of heaven the  splendour of his glory would cause instant destruction to mortals. The  mortal consorts of Zeus have been such a favourite theme with poets,  painters, and sculptors, that it is necessary to give some account of their  individual history. Those best known are Antiope, Leda, Europa, Callisto,  Alcmene, Semele, Io, and Danae.    ANTIOPE, to whom Zeus appeared under the form of a satyr, was the daughter  of Nicteus, king of Thebes. To escape the anger of her father she fled to  Sicyon, where king Epopeus, enraptured with her wonderful beauty, made her  his wife without asking her father's consent. This so enraged Nicteus that  he declared war against Epopeus, in order to compel him to restore Antiope.  At his death, which took place before he could succeed in his purpose,  Nicteus left his kingdom to his brother Lycus, commanding him, at the same  time, to carry on the war, and execute his vengeance. Lycus invaded Sicyon,  defeated and killed Epopeus, and brought back {33} Antiope as a prisoner.  On the way to Thebes she gave birth to her twin-sons, Amphion and Zethus,  who, by the orders of Lycus, were at once exposed on Mount Cithaeron, and  would have perished but for the kindness of a shepherd, who took pity on  them and preserved their lives. Antiope was, for many years, held captive  by her uncle Lycus, and compelled to suffer the utmost cruelty at the hands  of his wife Dirce. But one day her bonds were miraculously loosened, and  she flew for shelter and protection to the humble dwelling of her sons on  Mount Cithaeron. During the long period of their mother's captivity the  babes had grown into sturdy youths, and, as they listened angrily to the  story of her wrongs, they became all impatience to avenge them. Setting off  at once to Thebes they succeeded in possessing themselves of the town, and  after slaying the cruel Lycus they bound Dirce by the hair to the horns of  a wild bull, which dragged her hither and thither until she expired. Her  mangled body was cast into the fount near Thebes, which still bears her  name. Amphion became king of Thebes in his uncle's stead. He was a friend  of the Muses, and devoted to music and poetry. His brother, Zethus, was  famous for his skill in archery, and was passionately fond of the chase. It  is said that when Amphion wished to inclose the town of Thebes with walls  and towers, he had but to play a sweet melody on the lyre, given to him by  Hermes, and the huge stones began to move, and obediently fitted themselves  together.
