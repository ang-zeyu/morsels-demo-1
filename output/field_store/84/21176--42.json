Did you never hear of the beaver that  clomb the tree?\"    \"No! Tell--\"    \"Yes, some other time.\"    \"But how _could_ it get across so quick? Just one day!\"    \"Well, perhaps it was a year. Maybe it was the _next_ Christmas after  that when it got to San Francisco.\"    The papa set the little girl down, and started to run out of the room,  and both of the children ran after him, to pound him.    When they were in bed the boy called down-stairs to the papa, \"Well,  anyway, I didn't put up my lip.\"          THE PUMPKIN-GLORY    [Illustration]      The papa had told the story so often that the children knew just exactly  what to expect the moment he began. They all knew it as well as he knew  it himself, and they could keep him from making mistakes, or forgetting.  Sometimes he would go wrong on purpose, or would pretend to forget, and  then they had a perfect right to pound him till he quit it. He usually  quit pretty soon.    The children liked it because it was very exciting, and at the same time  it had no moral, so that when it was all over, they could feel that they  had not been excited just for the moral. The first time the little girl  heard it she began to cry, when it came to the worst part; but the boy  had heard it so much by that time that he did not mind it in the least,  and just laughed.    The story was in season any time between Thanksgiving and New Years; but  the papa usually began to tell it in the early part of October, when the  farmers were getting in their pumpkins, and the children were asking  when they were going to have any squash pies, and the boy had made his  first jack-o'-lantern.    \"Well,\" the papa said, \"once there were two little pumpkin seeds, and  one was a good little pumpkin seed, and the other was bad--very proud,  and vain, and ambitious.\"    The papa had told them what ambitious was, and so the children did not  stop him when he came to that word; but sometimes he would stop of his  own accord, and then if they could not tell what it meant, he would  pretend that he was not going on; but he always did go on.    \"Well, the farmer took both the seeds out to plant them in the  home-patch, because they were a very extra kind of seeds, and he was not  going to risk them in the cornfield, among the corn. So before he put  them in the ground, he asked each one of them what he wanted to be when  he came up, and the good little pumpkin seed said he wanted to come up a  pumpkin, and be made into a pie, and be eaten at Thanksgiving dinner;  and the bad little pumpkin seed said he wanted to come up a  morning-glory.    \"'Morning-glory!' says the farmer. 'I guess you'll come up a  pumpkin-glory, first thing _you_ know,' and then he haw-hawed, and told  his son, who was helping him to plant the garden, to keep watch of that  particular hill of pumpkins, and see whether that little seed came up a  morning-glory or not; and the boy stuck a stick into the hill so he  could tell it. But one night the cow got in, and the farmer was so mad,  having to get up about one o'clock in the morning to drive the cow out,  that he pulled up the stick, without noticing, to whack her over the  back with it, and so they lost the place.    \"But the two little pumpkin seeds, they knew where they were well  enough, and they lay low, and let the rain and the sun soak in and swell  them up; and then they both began to push, and by-and-by they got their  heads out of the ground, with their shells down over their eyes like  caps, and as soon as they could shake them off and look round, the bad  little pumpkin vine said to his brother:    \"'Well, what are you going to do now?'    \"The good little pumpkin vine said, 'Oh, I'm just going to stay here,  and grow and grow, and put out all the blossoms I can, and let them all  drop off but one, and then grow that into the biggest and fattest and  sweetest pumpkin that ever was for Thanksgiving pies.'    [Illustration: TWO LITTLE PUMPKIN SEEDS.]    \"'Well, that's what I am going to do, too,' said the bad little pumpkin  vine, 'all but the pies; but I'm not going to stay here to do it. I'm  going to that fence over there, where the morning-glories were last  summer, and I'm going to show them what a pumpkin-glory is like. I'm  just going to cover myself with blossoms; and blossoms that won't shut  up, either, when the sun comes out, but 'll stay open, as if they hadn't  anything to be ashamed of, and that won't drop off the first day,  either. I noticed those morning-glories all last summer, when I was  nothing but one of the blossoms myself, and I just made up my mind that  as soon as ever I got to be a vine, I would show them a thing or two.  Maybe I _can't_ be a morning-glory, but I can be a pumpkin-glory, and I  guess that's glory enough.'    \"It made the cold chills run over the good little vine to hear its  brother talk like that, and it begged him not to do it; and it began to  cry--    \"What's that?\" The papa stopped short, and the boy stopped whispering in  his sister's ear, and she answered:    \"He said he bet it was a girl!\" The tears stood in her eyes, and the boy  said:    \"Well, anyway, it was _like_ a girl.\"    \"Very well, sir!\" said the papa. \"And supposing it was? Which is better:  to stay quietly at home, and do your duty, and grow up, and be eaten in  a pie at Thanksgiving, or go gadding all over the garden, and climbing  fences, and everything? The good little pumpkin vine was perfectly  right, and the bad little pumpkin would have been saved a good deal if  it had minded its little sister.    \"The farmer was pretty busy that summer, and after the first two or  three hoeings he had to leave the two pumpkin vines to the boy that had  helped him to plant the seed, and the boy had to go fishing so much, and  then in swimming, that he perfectly neglected them, and let them run  wild, if they wanted to; and if the good little pumpkin vine had not  been the best little pumpkin vine that ever was, it _would_ have run  wild. But it just stayed where it was, and thickened up, and covered  itself with blossoms, till it was like one mass of gold. It was very  fond of all its blossoms, and it couldn't bear hardly to think of losing  any of them; but it knew they couldn't every one grow up to be a very  large pumpkin, and so it let them gradually drop off till it only had  one left, and then it just gave all its attention to that one, and did  everything it could to make it grow into the kind of pumpkin it said it  would.    \"All this time the bad little pumpkin vine was carrying out its plan of  being a pumpkin-glory. In the first place it found out that if it  expected to get through by fall it couldn't fool much putting out a lot  of blossoms and waiting for them to drop off, before it began to devote  itself to business. The fence was a good piece off, and it had to reach  the fence in the first place, for there wouldn't be any fun in being a  pumpkin-glory down where nobody could see you, or anything. So the bad  little pumpkin vine began to pull and stretch towards the fence, and  sometimes it thought it would surely snap in two, it pulled and  stretched so hard. But besides the pulling and stretching, it had to  hide, and go round, because if it had been seen it wouldn't have been  allowed to go to the fence. It was a good thing there were so many  weeds, that the boy was too lazy to pull up, and the bad little pumpkin  vine could hide among. But then they were a good deal of a hinderance,  too, because they were so thick it could hardly get through them. It had  to pass some rows of pease that were perfectly awful; they tied  themselves to it and tried to keep it back; and there was one hill of  cucumbers that acted ridiculously; they said it was a cucumber vine  running away from home, and they would have kept it from going any  farther, if it hadn't tugged with all its might and main, and got away  one night when the cucumbers were sleeping; it was pretty strong,  anyway. When it got to the fence at last, it thought it was going to  die. It was all pulled out so thin that it wasn't any thicker than a  piece of twine in some places, and its leaves just hung in tatters. It  hadn't had time to put out more than one blossom, and that was such a  poor little sickly thing that it could hardly hang on. The question was,  How can a pumpkin vine climb a fence, anyway?    \"Its knees and elbows were all worn to strings getting there, or that's  what the pumpkin thought, till it wound one of those tendrils round a  splinter of the fence, without thinking, and happened to pull, and then  it was perfectly surprised to find that it seemed to lift itself off the  ground a little. It said to itself, 'Let's try a few more,' and it  twisted some more of the tendrils round some more splinters, and this  time it fairly lifted itself off the ground. It said, 'Ah, I see!' as if  it had somehow expected to do something of the kind all along; but it  had to be pretty careful getting up the fence not to knock its blossom  off, for that would have been the end of it; and when it did get up  among the morning-glories it almost killed the poor thing, keeping it  open night and day, and showing it off in the hottest sun, and not  giving it a bit of shade, but just holding it out where it could be seen  the whole time. It wasn't very much of a blossom compared with the  blossoms on the good little pumpkin vine, but it was bigger than any of  the morning-glories, and that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22521"],[0,"The Young Acrobat of the Great North American Circus (#6)"],[1,"t,\" began his uncle.    \"I hope you are well, Mr. Bickford,\" said Kit, politely.    The blacksmith gazed at Kit with earnest scrutiny.    \"Humph!\" said he; \"are you strong and muscular?\"    \"Pretty fair,\" answered Kit, with a smile.    \"Kit,\" said his uncle, clearing his throat, \"in your circumstances I  have thought it desirable that you should learn a trade, and have spoken  to Mr. Bickford about taking you as an apprentice.\"    \"In what business?\" asked Kit.    \"I'm a blacksmith,\" said Mr. Bickford, taking it upon himself to reply,  \"and it's a good, healthy business as any you'd want to follow.\"    \"I have no doubt of it,\" said Kit, quietly, \"but I don't think I should  like it all the same. Uncle Stephen, how does it happen that you have  selected such a business for me?\"    \"I heard that Mr. Bickford needed an apprentice, and I have arranged  matters with him to take you, and teach you his trade.\"    \"Yes,\" put in Mr. Bickford, \"I've agreed to give you your board and a  dollar a week the first year. That's more than I got when I was  'prentice. My old master only paid me fifty cents a week.\"    Kit turned to his uncle.    \"Do you think my education has fitted me for a blacksmith's trade?\" he  asked.    \"It won't interfere,\" replied Mr. Watson, a little uneasily.    \"Wouldn't it have been well to consult me in the matter? It seems to me  I am rather interested.\"    \"Oh, I supposed you would object, as you had been looking forward to  being a gentleman, but I can't afford to keep you in idleness any  longer, and so have arranged matters with Mr. Bickford.\"    \"Suppose I object to going with him?\" said Kit, calmly.    \"Then I shall overrule your objections, and compel you to do what I  think is for your good.\"    Kit's eye flashed with transient anger, but as he had no idea of  acceding to his uncle's order, he did not allow himself to become unduly  excited. Indeed he had a plan, which made temporary submission a matter  of policy.    \"What's the boy's name?\" asked Aaron Bickford.    \"I am generally called Kit. My right name is Christopher.\"    \"Then, Kit, you'd better be getting your traps together, for I can't  stop long away from the shop.\"    \"I have arranged to have you go back with Mr. Bickford to-day,\" said  Stephen Watson.    \"That's rather short notice, isn't it?\" Kit rejoined.    \"The sooner the matter is arranged, the better!\" answered his uncle.    \"Very well,\" said Kit, with unexpected submission. \"I'll go and pack up  my clothes.\"    Mr. Watson looked relieved. He had expected to have more trouble with  his nephew.    In twenty minutes Kit reappeared with his school valise. He had packed  up a supply of shirts, socks, handkerchiefs, and underclothing.    \"I am all ready,\" he said.    \"Then we'll be going,\" said the blacksmith, rising with alacrity.    Kit took his place on the seat beside Mr. Bickford.    \"Good-by, uncle!\" he said; \"it may be some time before we meet again.\"    \"What does the boy mean?\" asked Stephen Watson, turning to Ralph with a  puzzled look.    \"I don't know. He's been acting queer all the morning.\"    So Kit rode away with Aaron Bickford, but he had not the slightest  intention of becoming blacksmith. Instead of blacksmith's forges,  visions of a circus ring and acrobatic feats were dancing before his  mind.          CHAPTER VIII.    KIT'S RIDE TO OAKFORD.      Oakford was six miles away. The blacksmith's horse was seventeen years  old, and did not make very good speed. Kit was unusually busy thinking.  He had taken a decisive step; he had, in fact, made up his mind to enter  upon a new life. He had not objected to going away with the blacksmith,  because it gave him an excuse for packing up his clothes, and leaving  the house quietly.    It may be objected that he had deceived Mr. Bickford. This was true, and  the thought of it troubled him, but he hardly knew how to explain  matters.    Not much conversation took place till they were within a mile of  Oakford. Aaron Bickford had filled his pipe at the beginning of the  journey, and he had smoked steadily ever since. At last he removed his  pipe from his mouth, and put it in his pocket.    \"Were you ever in Oakford?\" he asked.    \"Yes,\" answered Kit. \"I know the place very well.\"    \"How do you think you'll like livin' there?\"    \"I don't think I shall like it.\"    Mr. Bickford looked surprised.    \"I'll keep you at work so stiddy you won't mind where you are,\" he  remarked dryly.    \"Not if I know it,\" Kit said to himself.    He knew Mr. Bickford by reputation. He was a close-fisted, miserly man,  who was not likely to be a very desirable employer, for he expected  every one who worked for him to labor as hard as himself. Moreover, he  and his wife lived in a very stingy manner, and few of the luxuries of  the season appeared on their table. The fact that complaints upon this  score had been made by some of Kit's predecessors in his employ, led Mr.  Bickford to make inquiries with a view to ascertaining whether Kit was  particular about his food.    \"Are you partic'lar about your vittles?\" he asked abruptly.    \"I have been accustomed to good food,\" answered Kit.    \"You can't expect to live as you have at your uncle's,\" continued the  blacksmith. \"Me and my wife have enough to eat, but we think it best to  eat plain food. Some of my help have had stuck up notions, and expected  first class hotel fare, but they didn't get it at my house.\"    \"I believe you,\" said Kit.    Mr. Bickford eyed him sharply, not being sure but this might be a  sarcastic observation, but Kit's face was straight, and betrayed  nothing.    \"You'll live as well as I do myself,\" he proceeded, after a pause. \"I  don't pamper my appetite by no means.\"    Kit was quite ready to believe this also, but did not say so.    \"What time did you get up at your uncle's?\" asked the blacksmith.    \"We have breakfast a little before eight. I get up in time for  breakfast.\"    \"You do, hey?\" ejaculated the blacksmith, scornfully. \"Wa'al, I declare!  You must be tuckered out gettin' up so airly.\"    \"O no, I stand it very well, Mr. Bickford,\" said Kit, amused.    \"Do you know what time I get up?\" asked Mr. Bickford, with a touch of  indignation in his tone.    \"I would like to know,\" answered Kit meekly.    \"Wa'al, I get up at five o'clock. What do you say to that, hey?\"    \"I think it is very early.\"    \"I suppose you couldn't get up so early as that?\"    \"I might, if there was any need of it.\"    \"I reckon there will be need of it if you're goin' to work for me.\"    Kit cleared his throat. He felt that the time had come for an  explanation.    \"Mr. Bickford,\" he said, \"I owe you an apology.\"    \"What?\" said Bickford, regarding his young companion in surprise.    \"I have deceived you.\"    \"I don't know what you're talkin' about.\"    \"I don't think I did right to come with you to day.\"    \"I can't make out what you're talkin' about. Your uncle has engaged to  let you work for me.\"    \"But I haven't engaged to work for you, Mr. Bickford.\"    \"Hey?\" and the blacksmith eyed our hero in undisguised amazement.    \"I may as well say that I don't intend to work for you.\"    \"You don't mean to work for me?\" repeated Bickford slowly.    \"Just so. I have no intention of becoming a blacksmith.\"    \"Is the boy crazy?\" ejaculated Aaron Bickford.    \"No, Mr. Bickford; I have full command of my senses. You will have to  look out for another apprentice.\"    \"Then why did you agree to come with me?\"    \"That is what I have to apologize for. I wanted to get away from my  uncle's house quietly, and I thought it the best way to pretend to agree  to his plan.\"    Aaron Bickford was not a sweet tempered man. He had a pretty strong will  of his own, and was called, not without reason, obstinate. He began to  feel angry.    \"Well, boy, have you got through with what you had to say?\" he asked.    \"I believe so--for the present.\"    \"Then I guess it's about time for me to say something.\"    \"Very well, sir.\"    \"You'll find me a tough customer to deal with, young man.\"    \"Then perhaps it is just as well that I do not propose to work for you.\"    \"But you are goin' to work for me!\" said the blacksmith, nodding his  head.    \"Whether I want to or not?\" interrogated Kit, placidly.    \"Yes, whether you want to or not, willy nilly, as the lawyers say.\"    \"I think, Mr. Bickford, you will find that it takes two to make a  bargain.\"    \"So it does, and there's two that's made this bargain, your uncle and  me.\"    Mr. Bickford was not always strictly grammatical in his language, as the  reader will observe.    \"I don't admit my uncle's right to make arrangements for me without my  consent.\"    \"You know more'n he does, I reckon?\"    \"No, but this matter concerns me more than it does him.\"    \"Maybe you expect to live without workin'!\"    \"No; if it is true, as my uncle says, that I have no money, I shall have  to make my living, but I prefer to choose my own way of doing it.\"    \"You're a queer boy. Bein' a blacksmith is too much work for you, I  reckon.\"    \"At any rate it isn't the kind of work I care to undertake.\"    \"What's all this rigmarole comin' to? Here we are 'most at my house. If  you ain't goin' to work for me, what are you goin' to do?\"    \"I should like to pass the night at your house, Mr. Bickford. After  breakfast I will pay you for your accommodations, and go----\"    \"Where?\"    \"You must excuse my telling you that. I have formed some plans, but I do  not care to have my uncle know them.\"    \"Are you going to work for anybody?\" asked the blacksmith, whose  curiosity was aroused.    \"Yes, I have a place secured.\"    \"Is it on a farm?\"    \"No.\"    \"You're mighty mysterious, it seems to me. Now you've had your say, I've  got something to tell you.\"    \"Very well, Mr. Bickford.\"    \"You say you're not goin' to work for me?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Then I say you _are_ goin' to work for me. I've got your uncle's  authority to set you to work, and I'm goin' to do it.\"    Kit heard this"]]]
