[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22925"],[0,"The Story of Young Abraham Lincoln (#6)"],[1,"had brought up Nancy Hanks, and she was now a  foster-mother to Dennis, her nephew. Dennis became the constant  companion of the two Lincoln children. He has told most of the stories  that are known of this sad time in the Lincoln boy's life.    The two families had lived there for nearly a year when Thomas and Betsy  Sparrow were both seized with a terrible disease known to the settlers  as the \"milk-sick\" because it attacked the cattle. The stricken uncle  and aunt died, early in October, within a few days of each other. While  his wife was ill with the same dread disease, Thomas Lincoln was at  work, cutting down trees and ripping boards out of the logs with a long  whipsaw with a handle at each end, which little Abe had to help him use.  It was a sorrowful task for the young lad, for Abe must have known that  he would soon be helping his father make his mother's coffin. They  buried the Sparrows under the trees \"without benefit of clergy,\" for  ministers came seldom to that remote region.    Nancy Lincoln did not long survive the devoted aunt and uncle. She had  suffered too much from exposure and privation to recover her strength  when she was seized by the strange malady. One who was near her during  her last illness wrote, long afterward:    \"She struggled on, day by day, like the patient Christian woman she was.  Abe and his sister Sarah waited on their mother, and did the little jobs  and errands required of them. There was no physician nearer than  thirty-five miles.    \"The mother knew that she was going to die, and called the children to  her bedside. She was very weak and the boy and girl leaned over her  while she gave them her dying message. Placing her feeble hand on little  Abe's head, she told him to be kind and good to his father and sister.    \"'Be good to one another,' she said to them both. While expressing her  hope that they might live, as she had taught them to live, in the love  of their kindred and the service of God, Nancy Hanks Lincoln passed from  the miserable surroundings of her poor life on earth to the brightness  of the Beyond, on the seventh day after she was taken sick.\"    To the motherless boy the thought of his blessed mother being buried  without any religious service whatever added a keen pang to the  bitterness of his lot. Dennis Hanks once told how eagerly Abe learned to  write:    \"Sometimes he would write with a piece of charcoal, or the p'int of a  burnt stick, on the fence or floor. We got a little paper at the country  town, and I made ink out of blackberry juice, briar root and a little  copperas in it. It was black, but the copperas would eat the paper after  a while. I made his first pen out of a turkey-buzzard feather. We hadn't  no geese them days--to make good pens of goose quills.\"    As soon as he was able Abe Lincoln wrote his first letter. It was  addressed to Parson Elkin, the Baptist preacher, who had sometimes  stayed over night with the family when they lived in Kentucky, to ask  that elder to come and preach a sermon over his mother's grave. It had  been a long struggle to learn to write \"good enough for a  preacher\"--especially for a small boy who is asking such a favor of a  man as \"high and mighty\" as a minister of the Gospel seemed to him.    It was a heartbroken plea, but the lad did not realize it. It was a  short, straightforward note, but the good preacher's eyes filled with  tears as he read it.    The great undertaking was not finished when the letter was written. The  postage was a large matter for a little boy. It cost sixpence (equal to  twelve-and-a-half cents today) to send a letter a short distance--up to  thirty miles. Some letters required twenty-five cents--equal to fifty in  modern money. Sometimes, when the sender could not advance the postage,  the receiver had to pay it before the letter could be opened and read.  On this account letters were almost as rare and as expensive as  telegrams are today. When the person getting a letter could not pay the  postage, it was returned to the writer, who had to pay double to get it  back.    In those days one person could annoy another and put him to expense by  writing him and forcing him to pay the postage--then when the letter  was opened, it was found to be full of abuse, thus making a man pay for  insults to himself!    There was a great general who had suffered in this way, so he made a  rule that he would receive no letters unless the postage was prepaid.  One day there came to his address a long envelope containing what seemed  to be an important document. But it was not stamped, and the servant had  been instructed not to receive that kind of mail. So it was returned to  the sender. When it came back it was discovered that it had been mailed  by mistake without a stamp. That letter announced to General Zachary  Taylor that he had been nominated by a great convention as candidate for  President of the United States!    All this seems very strange now that a letter can be sent around the  world for a few cents. Besides, the mails did not go often and were  carried on horseback. For a long time one half-sick old man carried the  mail on a good-for-nothing horse, once a week, between New York and  Philadelphia, though they were the largest cities in the country.    So it was many months before Abe received an answer to his letter.  Elder Elkin may have been away from home on one of the long circuits  covered by pioneer preachers. As the days and weeks went by without the  lad's receiving any reply he was filled with misgivings lest he had  imposed upon the good man's former friendship.    At last the answer came and poor Abe's anxiety was turned to joy. The  kind elder not only said he would come, but he also named the Sunday  when it would be, so that the Lincoln family could invite all their  friends from far and near to the postponed service--for it often  happened in this new country that the funeral could not take place for  months after the burial.    It was late in the following Summer, nearly a year after Nancy's death,  that the devoted minister came. The word had gone out to all the region  round about. It was the religious event of the season. Hundreds of  people of all ages came from twenty miles around on horseback--a father,  mother and two children on one horse--also in oxcarts, and on foot. They  sat in groups in the wagons, and on the green grass, as at the feeding  of the multitudes in the time of the Christ. But these people brought  their own refreshments as if it were a picnic.    They talked together in low, solemn tones while waiting for the poor  little funeral procession to march out from the Lincoln cabin to the  grass-covered grave. Pioneer etiquette required the formalities of a  funeral. Elder Elkin was followed by the widowed husband, with Abraham  and Sarah and poor Cousin Dennis, also bereaved of his foster-parents,  and now a member of the Lincoln family.    There were tender hearts behind those hardened faces, and tears  glistened on the tanned cheeks of many in that motley assemblage of  eager listeners, while the good elder was paying the last tribute of  earth to the sweet and patient memory of his departed friend of other  days.    The words of the man of God, telling that assembled multitude what a  lovely and devoted girl and woman his mother had been, gave sweet and  solemn joy to the soul of the little Lincoln boy. It was all for her  dear sake, and she was, of all women, worthy of this sacred respect. As  he gazed around on the weeping people, he thought of the hopes and fears  of the months that had passed since he wrote his first letter to bring  this about.    \"God bless my angel mother!\" burst from his lonely lips--\"how glad I am  I've learned to write!\"      THE COMING OF ANOTHER MOTHER    All that a young girl of twelve could do, assisted by a willing brother  of ten, was done by Sarah and Abraham Lincoln to make that desolate  cabin a home for their lonesome father, and for cousin Dennis Hanks,  whose young life had been twice darkened by a double bereavement. But  \"what is home without a mother?\" Thomas Lincoln, missing the balance and  inspiration of a patient wife, became more and more restless, and, after  a year, wandered back again to his former homes and haunts in Kentucky.    While visiting Elizabethtown he saw a former sweetheart, the Sally Bush  of younger days, now Mrs. Daniel Johnston, widow of the county jailer  who had recently died, leaving three children and considerable property,  for that time and place. Thomas renewed his suit and won the pitying  heart of Sarah Johnston, and according to the story of the county clerk:    \"The next morning, December 2, 1819, I issued the license, and the same  day they were married, bundled up, and started for home.\"    Imagine the glad surprise of the three children who had been left at  home for weeks, when they saw a smart, covered wagon, drawn by four  horses, driven up before the cabin door one bright winter day, and their  father, active and alert, spring out and assist a pleasant-looking woman  and three children to alight! Then they were told that this woman was to  be their mother and they had two more sisters and another brother!    To the poor forlorn Lincoln children and their still more desolate  cousin, it seemed too good to be true. They quickly learned the names of  their new brother and sisters. The Johnston children were called John,  Sarah and Matilda, so Sarah Lincoln's name was promptly changed to Nancy  for her dead mother, as there were two Sarahs already in the combined  family.    Mrs. Sarah Bush Johnston Lincoln lost no time in taking poor Abe and  Nancy Lincoln to her great motherly heart, as if they were her own. They  were dirty, for they had been neglected, ill-used and deserted. She  washed their wasted bodies clean and dressed them in nice warm clothing  provided for her own children, till she, as she expressed it, \"made  them look more human.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22965"],[0,"Ten Thousand Miles with a Dog Sled (#6)"],[1," mail-carrier was at  that time occupying it at the end of his day's run.    The dogs stayed with the sled; dogs will usually stay with their sled;  they seem to recognise their first allegiance to the load they haul,  probably because they know their food forms part of it.    Our cache reached, we made a fire, thawed out the iron-like armour of my  leather breeches, and cutting a spare woollen scarf in two, wrapped the  dry, warm pieces about my numbed thighs. Then we pushed on the eighteen  miles or so to Circle, keeping a steady pace despite the drowsiness that  oppressed us, and that oppressed me particularly owing to the chill of  my ducking. About five in the morning we reached the town, and the  clergyman, the Reverend C. E. Rice, turned out of his warm bed and I  turned in, none the worse in body for the experience, but much humbled  in spirit. My companion, Mr. E. J. Knapp, whose thoughtful care for me I  always look back upon with gratitude, as well as upon Mr. Rice's  kindness, froze his nose and a toe slightly, being somewhat neglectful  of himself in his solicitude for me.    We had been out about twenty hours in a temperature ranging from 52 deg. to  60 deg. below zero, had walked about forty-four miles, labouring incessantly  as well as walking, what time we were with the sled, with nothing to  eat--it was too cold to stop for eating--and, in addition to this, one  of us had been in water to the waist, yet none of us took any harm. It  was a providential overruling of blundering foolhardiness for which we  were deeply thankful.    The next day a native with a fast team and an empty toboggan was sent  down to take our load on to the cabin and bring the dogs back.  Meanwhile, the mail-carrier had passed the spot, had seen the abandoned  sled standing by recently broken ice, and had come on into town while we  slept and none knew of our return, with the news that some one had been  drowned. The mail for Fairbanks did but await the mail from Fort Yukon,  and the town rumour, instantly identifying the abandoned sled, was  carried across to Fairbanks, to my great distress and annoyance. The  echoes of the distorted account of this misadventure which appeared in a  Fairbanks newspaper still reverberate in \"patent insides\" of the  provincial press of the United States.    [Sidenote: FORT YUKON ]    The next Monday we started again, this time with a toboggan and with a  man instead of a boy for guide, and in three days of only moderate  difficulty we reached Fort Yukon.    Fort Yukon, though it holds no attraction for the ordinary visitor or  the summer tourist on the river, is a place of much interest to those  who know the history of Alaska. While it is purely a native village,  with no white population save the traders and the usual sprinkling of  men that hang around native villages, it is yet the oldest white man's  post on the Yukon River, save the post established by the Russians at  Nulato, five or six hundred miles lower down. The Hudson Bay Company  established itself here in 1846, and that date serves as the year one  in making calculations and determining ages to this day. It is a fixed  point in time that every native knows of. Any old man can tell you  whether he was born before or after that date, and, if before, can pick  out some boy that is about the age he was when the event occurred. The  massacre at Nulato in 1851 serves in a similar way for the lower river.    After the Purchase, and the determination of the longitude of Fort Yukon  by Mr. Raymond in 1869--who made the first steamboat journey up the  Yukon on that errand--the Hudson Bay Company moved three times before  they succeeded in getting east of the 141st meridian, and at the point  reached on the third move, the New Rampart House on the Porcupine River,  only a few hundred yards beyond the boundary-line, they remained until  the gold excitement on the Yukon and the journeying of the natives to  new posts on that river rendered trading unprofitable; then they  withdrew to the Mackenzie. The oldest white men's graves in Alaska,  again with the exception of Nulato, are those in the little Hudson Bay  cemetery near Fort Yukon.    [Sidenote: ARCHDEACON MACDONALD ]    Fort Yukon is also the site of the oldest missionary station on the  river, unless there were earlier visits of Russian priests to the lower  river, of which there seems no record, for in 1862 there was a clergyman  of the Church of England at this place. Archdeacon MacDonald was a  remarkable man. Married to a native wife, he translated the whole Bible  and the Book of Common Prayer into the native tongue, and his  translations are in general use on the upper river to this day. He  reduced the language to writing, extracted its grammar, taught the  Indians to read and write their own tongue, and dignified it by the gift  of the great literature of the sacred books. The language is, of course,  a dying one--English is slowly superseding it--but it seems safe to say  that for a generation or two yet to come it will be the basis of the  common speech of the people and the language of worship. It is chiefly  in matters of trading and handicrafts that English is taking its place,  though here as elsewhere it stands to the discredit of the civilised  race that blackguard English is the first English that is learned.    There seems ground to question whether the substitution of a smattering  of broken English for the flexibility and picturesque expressiveness of  an indigenous tongue, thoroughly understood, carries with it any great  intellectual gain, though to suggest such a doubt is treason to some  minds. The time threatens when all the world will speak two or three  great languages, when all little tongues will be extinct and all little  peoples swallowed up, when all costume will be reduced to a dead level  of blue jeans and shoddy and all strange customs abolished. The world  will be a much less interesting world then; the spice and savour of the  ends of the earth will be gone. Nor does it always appear unquestionable  that the world will be the better or the happier. The advance of  civilisation would be a great thing to work for if we were quite sure  what we meant by it and what its goal is. To the ordinary government  school-teacher in Alaska, with some notable exceptions, it seems to  mean chiefly teaching the Indians to call themselves Mr. and Mrs. and  teaching the women to wear millinery, with a contemptuous attitude  toward the native language and all native customs. The less intelligent  grade of missionary sometimes falls into the same easy rut. So letters  pass through the post-offices addressed: \"Mr. Pretty Henry,\" \"Mrs.  Monkey Bill,\" \"Miss Sally Shortandirty\"; so, occasionally, the grotesque  spectacle may present itself, to the passengers on a steamer, of a  native woman in a \"Merry Widow\" hat and a blood-stained parkee gutting  salmon on the river bank.    The nobler ideal, as it seems to some of us, is to labour for  God-fearing, self-respecting Indians rather than imitation white men and  white women. An Indian who is honest, healthy and kindly, skilled in  hunting and trapping, versed in his native Bible and liturgy, even  though he be entirely ignorant of English and have acquired no taste for  canned fruit and know not when Columbus discovered America, may be very  much of a man in that station of life in which it has pleased God to  call him.    Christmas and the Fourth of July are the Indian's great holidays, the  one just after the best moose hunting and the other just before the  salmon run. It may be supposed that there were always great feasts at  the winter and summer solstices, though now he is sufficiently devout at  the one and patriotic at the other. At these seasons, and for weeks  before and after, Fort Yukon gathers a large number of Indians. It is  the native metropolis of the country within a radius of a hundred  miles, and what may be termed its permanent population of one hundred  and fifty is doubled and sometimes trebled by contingents from the  Chandalar, the Porcupine, and the Black Rivers, from that long river  called Birch Creek, and all the intervening country. Many families of  the \"uncivilised,\" self-respecting kind, to which reference has been  made, come in from outlying points, and the contrast between them and  their more sophisticated kinfolk of the town is all in their favour.    [Sidenote: JIMMY]    Such a gathering had already taken place in preparation for the  Christmas holidays when we reached Fort Yukon on the 15th of December.  It would have been pleasant to spend Christmas with them, but we were  due two hundred and fifty miles away, at Bettles, for that feast, if by  any means we could get there. So we lingered but the two days necessary  to equip ourselves. Jimmy had torn our bedding to pieces on the night of  the mishap; it was lashed on the outside of the load, and he had  scratched and clawed it to make a nest for himself until fur from the  robe and feathers from the quilts were all over the trail. The other  dogs, not so warmly coated as he, had been content to sleep in the snow.  Jimmy's character was gradually revealing itself. A well-bred trail dog  will not commit the canine sacrilege of invading the sled. That is a  \"Siwash\" dog's trick. So there was fresh bedding to manufacture, as well  as supplies for two hundred miles to get together.    A mail once a month went at that time from Fort Yukon to the Koyukuk,  and there was little other travel. The course lay fifty or sixty miles  across country to the Chandalar River, about one hundred miles up that  stream, and then across a divide to the South Fork of the Koyukuk, and  across another to the Middle Fork, on which Coldfoot is situated. It is  not possible to procure any supplies, save sometimes a little fish for  dog food and that not certainly, between Fort Yukon and Coldfoot, so  that provision for the whole journey must be taken.
