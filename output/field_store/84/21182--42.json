[Footnote 19: John Jay, _Correspondence and Public Papers_, Vol. 1, p.  144.]    [Footnote 20: John Jay, _Correspondence and Public Papers_, Vol. 1, p.  146.]    Clinton's inauguration occurred on July 30, 1777. He stood in front of  the courthouse at Kingston on top of the barrel from which the  Constitution had been published in the preceding April, and in the  uniform of his country, with sword in hand, he took the oath of  office. Within sixty days thereafter Sir Henry Clinton had carried the  Highland forts, scattered the Governor's troops, dispersed the first  Legislature of the State, burned Kingston to the ground, and very  nearly captured the Governor himself, the latter, under cover of  night, having made his escape by crossing the river in a small  rowboat. Among the captured patriots was Colonel McClaughry, the  Governor's brother-in-law. \"Where is my friend George?\" asked Sir  Henry. \"Thank God,\" replied the Colonel, \"he is safe and beyond the  reach of your friendship.\"          CHAPTER IV    CLINTON AND HAMILTON    1777-1789      During the war Governor Clinton's duties were largely military. Every  important measure of the Legislature dealt with the public defence,  and the time of the Executive was fully employed in carrying out its  enactments and performing the work of commander-in-chief of the  militia. A large proportion of the population of the State was either  avowedly loyal to the Crown or secretly indisposed to the cause of  independence. \"Of all the Colonies,\" wrote William Jay, \"New York was  probably the least unanimous in the assertion and defence of the  principles of the Revolution. The spirit of disaffection was most  extensive on Long Island, and had probably tainted a large majority of  its inhabitants. In Queens County, in particular, the people had, by a  formal vote, refused to send representatives to the colonial congress  or convention, and had declared themselves neutral in the present  crisis.\"[21]    [Footnote 21: William Jay, _Life of John Jay_, Vol. 1, p. 41.]    The Governor sought to crush this spirit by methods much in vogue in  the eighteenth century. At the outset of his career he declared that  he had \"rather roast in hell to all eternity than be dependent upon  Great Britain or show mercy to a damned Tory.\" To add to his fame, he  enforced this judgment with heavy fines, long imprisonments, summary  banishments, and frequent coats of tar and feathers.    Very soon after the adoption of the Constitution, the Legislature  passed a law requiring an oath of allegiance to the State; and under  the vigorous enforcement of this act the Governor sent many Tories  from the rural districts into the city of New York or expelled them  from the State. Others were required to give a pledge, with security,  to reside within prescribed limits. At times even the churches were  filled with prisoners, some of whom were sent to jails in Connecticut,  or exchanged for prisoners of war. In 1779 the Legislature increased  the penalty of disloyalty to the State, by passing the Confiscation  Act, declaring \"the forfeiture and sale of the estates of persons who  had adhered to the enemy.\"    Up to this time only one political party had existed among the Whig  colonists. The passage of the Confiscation Act, however, encountered  the opposition of many sincere lovers of the cause of independence,  who favoured a more moderate policy toward loyalists, since they were  probably as sincere in their opinions as those opposed to them.  Besides, a generous and magnanimous course, it was argued, would  induce the return of many desirable citizens after hostilities had  ceased. To this the ultra-Whigs replied that the law of  self-preservation made a severe policy necessary, and if any one  suffered by its operation he must look to the government of his choice  for comfort and reimbursement. As for the return of the Tories, the  ultras declared that only citizens sincerely loyal to an independent  country would be acceptable.    This division into moderate and ultra Whigs was emphasised in 1781 by  the legislative grant to Congress of such import duties as accrued at  the port of New York, to be levied and collected \"under such penalties  and regulations, and by such officers, as Congress should from time to  time make, order, and appoint.\" Governor Clinton did not cordially  approve the act at the time of its passage, and as the money began  flowing into the national treasury, he opposed the method of its  surrender. In his opinion, the State, as an independent sovereignty,  had associated itself with other Colonies only for mutual protection,  and not for their support. At his instance, therefore, the Legislature  substituted for the law of 1781 the act of March, 1783, granting the  duties to Congress, but directing their collection by officers of the  State. Although this act was subsequently amended, making collectors  amenable to Congress, another law was enacted in 1786 granting  Congress the revenue, and reserving to the State, as in the law of  1783, \"the sole power of levying and collecting the duties.\" When  Congress asked the Governor to call a special session of the  Legislature, that the right to levy and collect might be yielded as  before, he refused to do so.    Governor Clinton understood the commercial advantages of New York's  geographical location, which were greatly enhanced by the navigation  acts of other States. The peace treaty had made New York the port of  entry for the whole region east of the Delaware, and into its coffers  poured a revenue so marvellous as to excite hopes of a prospective  wealth which a century, remarkable as was its productiveness, did  little more than realise. If any State, therefore, could survive  without a union with other Colonies, it was New York, and it is not  surprising that many, perhaps a majority of its people, under the  leadership of George Clinton, settled into a policy unfriendly to a  national revenue, and later to a national government.    The Governor had gradually become mindful of an opposition as stubborn  as it was persistent. He had encountered it in his treatment of the  Tories, but not until Alexander Hamilton became an advocate of amnesty  and oblivion, did Clinton recognise the centre and future leader of  the opposing forces. Hamilton did not appear among those interested in  the election of governor in 1777. His youth shut him out of Assembly  and Congress, out of committees and conventions, but it did not shut  him out of the army; and while Governor Clinton was wrestling with new  problems of government in the formation of a new State, Hamilton was  acting as secretary, aide, companion, and confidant of Washington,  accepting suggestions as commands, and acquiescing in his chief's  judgment with a fidelity born of love and admiration. In the history  of war nothing is more beautiful than the friendship existing between  the acknowledged leader of his country and this brave young officer,  spirited and impulsive, brilliant and able, yet frank and candid,  without ostentation and without egotism. It recalls a later-day  relationship between Ulysses S. Grant and John A. Rawlins, his chief  of staff.    In July, 1781, Hamilton, in command of a corps, accompanied Washington  in the forced march of the American army from New York to Yorktown.  This afforded him the opportunity, so long and eagerly sought, of  handling an independent command at a supreme moment of danger, and  before the sun went down on the 14th of October, he had led his troops  with fixed bayonets, under a heavy and constant fire, over abatis,  ditch, and palisades; then, mounting the parapet, he leaped into the  redoubt. Washington saw the impetuosity of the attack in the face of  the murderous fire, the daring leap to the parapet with three of his  soldiers, and the almost fatal spring into the redoubt. \"Few cases,\"  he says, \"have exhibited greater proofs of intrepidity, coolness, and  firmness.\" Three days later Cornwallis surrendered.    In the summer of 1782 Hamilton was admitted to the bar in Albany, but  soon afterward settled in New York City, where he seems to have come  into practice and into fame by defending the rights of Tories. For  four years after the war ended, the treatment of British sympathisers  was the dominant political issue in New York. Governor Clinton  advocated disfranchisement and banishment, and the Legislature enacted  into law what he advised; so that when the British troops, under the  peace treaty, evacuated New York, in November, 1783, loyalists who had  thus far escaped the wrath of this patriot Governor, flocked to Nova  Scotia and New Brunswick like birds seeking a more congenial clime,  recalling the flight of the Huguenots after the revocation of the  Edict of Nantes one hundred years earlier. It is not easy to estimate  the number who fled before this savage and violent action of the  Legislature. Sir Guy Carleton, in command at New York, fixes the  emigration at one hundred thousand souls. For many years the \"Landing  of the Loyalists\" was annually commemorated at St. John, and in the  cemeteries of England and Scotland are found the tombstones of these  unfortunate devotees of the mother country.    It is likely Clinton was too intolerant, but it was the intolerance  that follows revolution. Hamilton, on the other hand, became an early  advocate of amnesty and oblivion, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22594"],[0,"Colonial Records of Virginia (#6)"],[1,"the Assembly that concerned  him, he pleaded lardgely for himself[142] to them both and  indevoured[143] to answere some other thinges[144] that were objected  against[145] his Patente.
