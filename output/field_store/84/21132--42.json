Most of the aristocratic ladies of Fifth Avenue had not  the least inkling that the amiable manager who so entertainingly  discussed philosophy, drama, and literature at their five o'clock  teas, was the \"notorious\" Emma Goldman.  If the latter should some  day write her autobiography, she will no doubt have many interesting  anecdotes to relate in connection with these experiences.    The weekly Anarchist publication, FREE SOCIETY, issued by the Isaak  family, was forced to suspend in consequence of the nation-wide fury  that swept the country after the death of McKinley.  To fill out the  gap Emma Goldman, in co-operation with Max Baginski and other  comrades, decided to publish a monthly magazine devoted to the  furtherance of Anarchist ideas in life and literature.  The first  issue of MOTHER EARTH appeared in the month of March, 1906, the  initial expenses of the periodical partly covered by the proceeds of  a theater benefit given by Orleneff, Mme. Nazimova, and their  company, in favor of the Anarchist magazine.  Under tremendous  difficulties and obstacles the tireless propagandist has succeeded in  continuing MOTHER EARTH uninterruptedly since 1906--an achievement  rarely equalled in the annals of radical publications.    In May, 1906, Alexander Berkman at last left the hell of  Pennsylvania, where he had passed the best fourteen years of his  life.  No one had believed in the possibility of his survival.  His  liberation terminated a nightmare of fourteen years for Emma Goldman,  and an important chapter of her career was thus concluded.    Nowhere had the birth of the Russian revolution aroused such vital  and active response as among the Russians living in America.  The  heroes of the revolutionary movement in Russia, Tchaikovsky, Mme.  Breshkovskaia, Gershuni, and others visited these shores to waken the  sympathies of the American people toward the struggle for liberty,  and to collect aid for its continuance and support.  The success of  these efforts was to a considerable extent due to the exertions,  eloquence, and the talent for organization on the part of Emma  Goldman.  This opportunity enabled her to give valuable services to  the struggle for liberty in her native land.  It is not generally  known that it is the Anarchists who are mainly instrumental in  insuring the success, moral as well as financial, of most of the  radical undertakings.  The Anarchist is indifferent to acknowledged  appreciation; the needs of the Cause absorb his whole interest, and  to these he devotes his energy and abilities.  Yet it may be  mentioned that some otherwise decent folks, though at all times  anxious for Anarchist support and co-operation, are ever willing to  monopolize all the credit for the work done.  During the last several  decades it was chiefly the Anarchists who had organized all the great  revolutionary efforts, and aided in every struggle for liberty.  But  for fear of shocking the respectable mob, who looks upon the  Anarchists as the apostles of Satan, and because of their social  position in bourgeois society, the would-be radicals ignore the  activity of the Anarchists.    In 1907 Emma Goldman participated as delegate to the second Anarchist  Congress, at Amsterdam.  She was intensely active in all its  proceedings and supported the organization of the Anarchist  INTERNATIONALE.  Together with the other American delegate, Max  Baginski, she submitted to the congress an exhaustive report of  American conditions, closing with the following characteristic  remarks:      \"The charge that Anarchism is destructive, rather than constructive,  and that, therefore, Anarchism is opposed to organization, is one of  the many falsehoods spread by our opponents.  They confound our  present social institutions with organization; hence they fail to  understand how we can oppose the former, and yet favor the latter.  The fact, however, is that the two are not identical.    \"The State is commonly regarded as the highest form of organization.  But is it in reality a true organization?  Is it not rather an  arbitrary institution, cunningly imposed upon the masses?    \"Industry, too, is called an organization; yet nothing is farther  from the truth.  Industry is the ceaseless piracy of the rich against  the poor.    \"We are asked to believe that the Army is an organization, but a  close investigation will show that it is nothing else than a cruel  instrument of blind force.    \"The Public School!  The colleges and other institutions of learning,  are they not models of organization, offering the people fine  opportunities for instruction?  Far from it.  The school, more than  any other institution, is a veritable barrack, where the human mind  is drilled and manipulated into submission to various social and  moral spooks, and thus fitted to continue our system of exploitation  and oppression.    \"Organization, as WE understand it, however, is a different thing.  It is based, primarily, on freedom.  It is a natural and voluntary  grouping of energies to secure results beneficial to humanity.    \"It is the harmony of organic growth which produces variety of color  and form, the complete whole we admire in the flower.  Analogously  will the organized activity of free human beings, imbued with the  spirit of solidarity, result in the perfection of social harmony,  which we call Anarchism.  In fact, Anarchism alone makes  non-authoritarian organization of common interests possible, since it  abolishes the existing antagonism between individuals and classes.    \"Under present conditions the antagonism of economic and social  interests results in relentless war among the social units, and  creates an insurmountable obstacle in the way of a co-operative  commonwealth.    \"There is a mistaken notion that organization does not foster  individual freedom; that, on the contrary, it means the decay of  individuality.  In reality, however, the true function of  organization is to aid the development and growth of personality.    \"Just as the animal cells, by mutual co-operation, express their  latent powers in formation of the complete organism, so does the  individual, by co-operative effort with other individuals, attain his  highest form of development.    \"An organization, in the true sense, cannot result from the  combination of mere nonentities.  It must be composed of  self-conscious, intelligent individualities.  Indeed, the total of  the possibilities and activities of an organization is represented in  the expression of individual energies.    \"It therefore logically follows that the greater the number of  strong, self-conscious personalities in an organization, the less  danger of stagnation, and the more intense its life element.    \"Anarchism asserts the possibility of an organization without  discipline, fear, or punishment, and without the pressure of poverty:  a new social organism which will make an end to the terrible struggle  for the means of existence,--the savage struggle which undermines the  finest qualities in man, and ever widens the social abyss.  In short,  Anarchism strives towards a social organization which will establish  well-being for all.    \"The germ of such an organization can be found in that form of trades  unionism which has done away with centralization, bureaucracy, and  discipline, and which favors independent and direct action on the  part of its members.\"      The very considerable progress of Anarchist ideas in America can best  be gauged by the remarkable success of the three extensive lecture  tours of Emma Goldman since the Amsterdam Congress of 1907.  Each  tour extended over new territory, including localities where  Anarchism had never before received a hearing.  But the most  gratifying aspect of her untiring efforts is the tremendous sale of  Anarchist literature, whose propagandist effect cannot be estimated.  It was during one of these tours that a remarkable incident happened,  strikingly demonstrating the inspiring potentialities of the  Anarchist idea.  In San Francisco, in 1908, Emma Goldman's lecture  attracted a soldier of the United States Army, William Buwalda.  For  daring to attend an Anarchist meeting, the free Republic  court-martialed Buwalda and imprisoned him for one year.  Thanks to  the regenerating power of the new philosophy, the government lost a  soldier, but the cause of liberty gained a man.      A propagandist of Emma Goldman's importance is necessarily a sharp  thorn to the reaction.  She is looked upon as a danger to the  continued existence of authoritarian usurpation.  No wonder, then,  that the enemy resorts to any and all means to make her impossible.  A systematic attempt to suppress her activities was organized a year  ago by the united police force of the country.  But like all previous  similar attempts, it failed in a most brilliant manner.  Energetic  protests on the part of the intellectual element of America succeeded  in overthrowing the dastardly conspiracy against free speech.  Another attempt to make Emma Goldman impossible was essayed by the  Federal authorities at Washington.  In order to deprive her of the  rights of citizenship, the government revoked the citizenship papers  of her husband, whom she had married at the youthful age of eighteen,  and whose whereabouts, if he be alive, could not be determined for  the last two decades.  The great government of the glorious United  States did not hesitate to stoop to the most despicable methods to  accomplish that achievement.  But as her citizenship had never proved  of use to Emma Goldman, she can bear the loss with a light heart.      There are personalities who possess such a powerful individuality  that by its very force they exert the most potent influence over the  best representatives of their time.  Michael Bakunin was such a  personality.  But for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21630"],[0,"Bibliomania in the Middle Ages (#6)"],[1,"prodigality against works of loose morality or  heathen origin; nor did the monks feel much compassion--although they  loved to read them--for the old authors of antiquity. Pagans they were,  and therefore fit only to be named as infidels and dogs, so the monk was  directed for a secular book, \"which some pagan wrote after making the  general sign to scratch his ear with his hand, just as a dog itching  would do with his feet, because infidels are not unjustly compared to  such creatures--_quia nec immerito infideles tali animanti  contparantur_.\"[32] Wretched bigotry and puny malice! Yet what a sad  reflection it is, that with all the foul and heartburning examples which  those dark ages of the monks afford, posterity have failed to profit by  them--religious intolerance, with all its vain-glory and malice,  flourishes still, the cankering worm of many a Christian blossom! Besides  the duties which we have enumerated, there were others which it was the  province of the armarian to fulfil. He was particularly to inspect and  collate those books which, according to the decrees of the church, it was  unlawful to possess different from the authorized copies; these were the  bible, the gospels, missals, epistles, collects graduales, antiphons,  hymns, psalters, lessions, and the monastic rules; these were always to  be alike even in the most minute point.[33] He was moreover directed to  prepare for the use of the brothers short tables respecting the times  mentioned in the capitulary for the various offices of the church, to  make notes upon the matins, the mass, and upon the different orders.[34]  In fact, the monkish amanuensis was expected to undertake all those  matters which required care and learning combined. He wrote the letters  of the monastery, and often filled the office of secretary to my Lord  Abbot. In the monasteries of course the services of the librarian were  unrequited by any pecuniary remuneration, but in the cathedral libraries  a certain salary was sometimes allowed them. Thus we learn that the  amanuensis of the conventual church of Ely received in the year 1372  forty-three shillings and fourpence for his annual duties;[35] and  Oswald, Bishop of Worcester, in the tenth century, gave considerable  landed possessions to a monk of that church as a recompense for his  services as librarian.[36] In some monasteries, in the twelfth century,  if not earlier, they levied a tax on all the members of the community,  who paid a yearly sum to the librarian for binding, preserving, and  purchasing copies for the library. One of these rules, bearing date 1145,  was made by Udon, Abbot of St. Pere en Vallee a Chantres, and that it  might be more plausibly received, he taxed himself as well as all the  members of his own house.[37] The librarian sometimes, in addition to his  regular duties, combined the office of precentor to the monastery.[38]  Some of their account-books have been preserved, and by an inspection of  them, we may occasionally gather some interesting and curious hints, as  to the cost of books and writing materials in those times. As may be  supposed, the monkish librarians often became great bibliophiles, for  being in constant communication with choice manuscripts, they soon  acquired a great mania for them. Posterity are also particularly indebted  to the pens of these book conservators of the middle ages; for some of  the best chroniclers and writers of those times were humble librarians to  some religious house.    Not only did the bibliophiles of old exercise the utmost care in the  preservation of their darling books, but the religious basis of their  education and learning prompted them to supplicate the blessing of God  upon their goodly tomes. Although I might easily produce other instances,  one will suffice to give an idea of their nature: \"O Lord, send the  virtue of thy Holy Spirit upon these our books; that cleansing them from  all earthly things, by thy holy blessing, they may mercifully enlighten  our hearts and give us true understanding; and grant that by thy  teaching, they may brightly preserve and make full an abundance of good  works according to thy will.\"[39]    FOOTNOTES:    [16] Cap. xxi.

CHAPTER III.         _Scriptoria and the Scribes.--Care in copying.--Bible reading       among the monks.--Booksellers in the middle ages.--Circulating       libraries.--Calligraphic art, etc._      As the monasteries were the schools of learning, so their occupants were  the preservers of literature, and, as Herault observes, had they not  taken the trouble to transcribe books, the ancients had been lost to us  for ever; to them, therefore, we owe much. But there are many, however,  who suppose that the monastic establishments were hotbeds of superstition  and fanaticism, from whence nothing of a useful or elevated nature could  possibly emanate. They are too apt to suppose that the human intellect  must be altogether weak and impotent when confined within such narrow  limits; but truth and knowledge can exist even in the dark cells of a  gloomy cloister, and inspire the soul with a fire that can shed a light  far beyond its narrow precincts. Indeed, I scarce know whether to  regret, as some appear to do, that the literature and learning of those  rude times was preserved and fostered by the Christian church; it is  said, that their strict devotion and religious zeal prompted them to  disregard all things but a knowledge of those divine, but such is not the  case; at least, I have not found it so; it is true, as churchmen, they  were principally devoted to the study of divine and ecclesiastical lore;  but it is also certain that in that capacity they gradually infused the  mild spirit of their Master among the darkened society over which they  presided, and among whom they shone as beacons of light in a dreary  desert. But the church did more than this. She preserved to posterity the  profane learnings of Old Greece and Rome; copied it, multiplied it, and  spread it. She recorded to after generations in plain, simple language,  the ecclesiastical and civil events of the past, for it is from the terse  chronicles of the monkish churchmen that we learn now the history of what  happened then. Much as we may dislike the monastic system, the cold,  heartless, gloomy ascetic atmosphere of the cloister, and much as we may  deplore the mental dissipation of man's best attributes, which the system  of those old monks engendered, we must exercise a cool and impartial  judgment, and remember that what now would be intolerable and monstrously  inconsistent with our present state of intellectuality, might at some  remote period, in the ages of darkness and comparative barbarism, have  had its virtues and beneficial influences. As for myself, it would be  difficult to convince me, with all those fine relics of their deeds  before me, those beauteous fanes dedicated to piety and God, those  libraries so crowded with their vellum tomes, so gorgeously adorned, and  the abundant evidence which history bears to their known charity and  hospitable love, that these monks and their system was a scheme of dismal  barbarism; it may be so, but my reading has taught me different; but, on  the other hand, although the monks possessed many excellent qualities,  being the encouragers of literature, the preservers of books, and  promulgators of civilization, we must not hide their numerous and  palpable faults, or overlook the poison which their system of monachism  _ultimately_ infused into the very vitals of society. In the early  centuries, before the absurdities of Romanism were introduced, the  influence of the monastic orders was highly beneficial to our Saxon  ancestors, but in after ages the Church of England was degraded by the  influence of the fast growing abominations of Popedom. She drank  copiously of the deadly potion, and became the blighted and ghostly  shadow of her former self. Forgetting the humility of her divine Lord,  she sought rather to imitate the worldly splendor and arrogance of her  Sovereign "]]]
