[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21677"],[0,"Milton (#6)"],[1,"by appeal to a Court  where the success and the fame of this world are as straw in the furnace;  and then, having duly performed the obsequies of his friend, with  reinvigorated heart he turns once more to the future--\"To-morrow to fresh  woods and pastures new.\" A singular ending, no doubt, to an elegy! But it  is blind and hasty to conclude that therefore the precedent laments are  \"not to be considered as the effusion of real passion.\" A soldier's  burial is not the less honoured because his comrades must turn from his  grave to give their thought and strength and courage to the cause which  was also his. The maimed rites, interrupted by the trumpet calling to  action, are a loftier commemoration than the desolating laments of those  who \"weep the more because they weep in vain.\" And in this way Milton's  fierce tirade against the Church hirelings, and his preoccupation with  his own ambitions support and explain each other, and find a fit place in  the poem. He is looking to his equipment, if perchance he may live to do  that in poetry and politics, which Edward King had died leaving  unaccomplished. When his own time came he desired to be lamented in no  other way--      Come, come; no time for lamentation now,    Nor much more cause. Samson hath quit himself    Like Samson, and heroicly hath finished    A life heroic, on his enemies    Fully revenged.    This overmastering sense of the cause breathes through all his numerous  references to himself. He stands in the Forum,          Disturbed, yet comely, and in act    Raised, as of some great matter to begin;    and addresses himself, as he boasts in _The Second Defence of the People  of England_, to \"the whole collective body of people, cities, states, and  councils of the wise and eminent, through the wide expanse of anxious and  listening Europe.\" Having sacrificed the use of his eyes to the service  of the commonweal, he bates not a jot of heart or hope--              What supports me, dost thou ask?    The conscience, friend, to have lost them overplied    In Liberty's defence, my noble task,    Of which all Europe talks from side to side.    And while thus his fighting years are filled with the exaltation of  battle, as he plumes and lifts himself upon the cause that is going  forward, the story of his closing years has in it much of the pathos of a  lost cause. It was remarked by Johnson that there is in the _Paradise  Lost_ little opportunity for the pathetic; only one passage, indeed, is  allowed by him to be truly deserving of that name. But the description of  the remorse and reconcilement of Adam and Eve, which Johnson doubtless  intended, will not compare, for moving quality, with the matchless  invocation to the Seventh Book--      More safe I sing with mortal voice, unchanged    To hoarse or mute, though fallen on evil days,    On evil days though fallen, and evil tongues,    In darkness, and with dangers compassed round,    And solitude; yet not alone, while thou    Visit'st my slumbers nightly, or when Morn    Purples the East. Still govern thou my song,    Urania, and fit audience find, though few.    Then the noise that he had heard, in imagination only, thirty years  earlier, assails his bodily ears; as evening sets in, the wonted roar is  up, not in the wild woods of fancy inhabited by the sensual magician and  his crew, but in the unlighted streets of Restoration London, as a chorus  of cup-shotten brawlers goes roaring by. The king is enjoying his own  again; and the poet, hunted and harassed in his last retreat, raises his  petition again to the Muse whom he had invoked at the beginning of his  task,--not Clio nor her sisters, but the spirit of heavenly power and  heavenly wisdom; his mind reverts to that story of Orpheus which had  always had so singular and personal a fascination for him; of Orpheus,  who, holding himself aloof from the mad amorists of Thrace, was by them  torn to pieces during the orgy of the Dionysia, and sent rolling down the  torrent of the Hebrus; and he prays to his goddess and guardian--      But drive far off the barbarous dissonance    Of Bacchus and his revellers, the race    Of that wild rout that tore the Thracian bard    In Rhodope, where woods and rocks had ears    To rapture, till the savage clamour drowned    Both harp and voice; nor could the Muse defend    Her son. So fail not thou, who thee implores;    For thou art heavenly, she an empty dream.    Disappointed of all his political hopes, living on neglected and poor for  fourteen years after the Restoration, and dying a private citizen,  passably obscure, Milton yet found and took a magnanimous revenge upon  his enemies. They had crippled only his left hand in silencing the  politician, but his right hand, which had hung useless by his side for so  many years while he served the State, was his own still, and wielded a  more Olympian weapon. In prose and politics he was a baffled man, but in  poetry and vision he found his triumph. His ideas, which had gone  a-begging among the politicians of his time, were stripped by him of the  rags of circumstance, and cleansed of its dust, to be enthroned where  they might secure a hearing for all time. The surprise that he prepared  for the courtiers of the Restoration world was like Samson's revenge, in  that it fell on them from above; and, as elsewhere in the poem of _Samson  Agonistes_, Milton was thinking not very remotely of his own case when he  wrote that jubilant semi-chorus, with the marvellous fugal succession of  figures, wherein Samson, and by inference Milton himself, is compared to  a smouldering fire revived, to a serpent attacking a hen-roost, to an  eagle swooping on his helpless prey, and last, his enemies now silent for  ever, to the phoenix, self-begotten and self-perpetuating. The Philistian  nobility (or the Restoration notables) are described, with huge scorn, as  ranged along the tiers of their theatre, like barnyard fowl blinking on  their perch, watching, not without a flutter of apprehension, the vain  attempts made on their safety by the reptile grovelling in the dust  below--          But he, though blind of sight,    Despised, and thought extinguished quite,    With inward eyes illuminated,    His fiery virtue roused    From under ashes into sudden flame,    And as an evening dragon came,    Assailant on the perched roosts    And nests in order ranged    Of tame villatic fowl, but as an eagle    His cloudless thunder bolted on their heads.    So Virtue, given for lost,    Depressed and overthrown, as seemed,    Like that self-begotten bird    In the Arabian woods embost,    That no second knows nor third,    And lay erewhile a holocaust,    From out her ashy womb now teemed,    Revives, reflourishes, then vigorous most    When most unactive deemed;    And, though her body die, her fame survives.    A secular bird, ages of lives.          CHAPTER II  THE PROSE WORKS      It is customary for the friends of Milton to approach his prose works  with a sigh of apology. There is a deep-rooted prejudice among the  English people against a poet who concerns himself intimately with  politics. Whether this feeling has its origin in solicitude for the poet  or for the politics is hard to determine; indeed it is pretty generally  maintained that each is detrimental to the other. But seeing that for one  man in the modern world who cares for poets there are at least ten who  care for politics, it is safe to assume that the poets, when they are  deprived of the franchise, are deprived rather to maintain the purity and  efficiency of politics than for the good of their own souls. They have  been compared to birds of Paradise, which were long believed to have no  feet; and the common sense of the English people, with a touch of the  municipal logic of Dogberry, has enacted that whereas they have no feet,  and have moreover been proved to have no feet, it shall be forbidden  them, under the strictest pains and penalties, to alight and walk. Their  function is to beautify the distant landscape with the flash of wings.    For most men common-sense is the standard, and immediate utility the end,  whereby they judge political questions, great and small. Now common-sense  judges only the questions that are brought home to it by instant example;  and utility is appealed to for a verdict only amid the dense crowd of  actual conflicting interests. Neither the one nor the other is  far-sighted or imaginative. So it comes about that the political system,  in England, at least, is built up piecemeal; it is founded on appetites  and compromises, and mortared by immemorial habit. To explain this  process, and to transfigure it in the pure light of imagination, was the  work of the great poet-politician, Edmund Burke. But the poet usually  goes a hastier way to work. Looking at the whole domiciliary structure  from outside, he finds it shapeless and ugly, like an ant-heap; and  volunteers to play the architect. His design treats the details of  individual habit and happiness in strict subordination to the desired  whole. What he wants is consistency, symmetry, dignity; and to achieve  these he is willing to make a holocaust of human selfishnesses. He may be  a deep scholar and thinker, but he is apt to forget one point of ancient  wisdom,--that it is the wearer of the shoe, and not the cobbler, who best  knows where the shoe wrings him.    The speculations of the poet awaken no hostile resentment so long as they  are admittedly abstract. He is at liberty to build his Republic, his City  of the Sun, his Utopia, or his New Atlantis, amid the indifferent  applause of mankind. But when his aim becomes practical and immediate,  when he seeks to stir the heap by introducing into it the ruthless  discomfort of an idea, a million littlenesses assail him with deadly  enmity, and he is found sorrowfully protesting his amazement:--      I did but prompt the age to quit their clogs      By the known rules of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21687"],[0,"The Youngest Girl in the Fifth: A School Story (#6)"],[1,"a great sigh of relief. Miss Roscoe would receive her  parcel that night, and would be no wiser for what had happened.    \"We shall be very glad if you will do that,\" she said. \"And will you  please tell us what we have to pay extra?\"    The man took the bill which had been enclosed in the box and rapidly  glanced over the items.    \"Let me see--teapot, cream jug, three cups, four plates--the sugar  basin is all right--ah! but this saucer is cracked! Sixteen and six,  seventeen and nine--it will be exactly one pound two and sixpence,  please.\"    Gwen felt ready to sink through the floor. She had very little notion  of the value of things, and could hardly believe that china cost so  much. She looked blankly and helplessly at Netta, who after a moment's  pause met the emergency.    \"We haven't the money with us this afternoon, I'm afraid, but we'll  bring it to-morrow without fail. Will that do?\"    \"Yes, thank you, miss, I dare say it will be all right if you give me  the name.\"    \"Miss Gwen Gascoyne,\" said Netta promptly.    \"At Rodenhurst, I suppose?\"    \"Yes.\"    That ended the transaction, so the two girls left the shop.    \"Well, Gwen, my child, you've let yourself in for a nice little bill!\"  laughed Netta, when they found themselves in the street.    \"It's impossible! I can't pay it!\" gasped Gwen, with hot tears  trickling down her cheeks. \"What am I to do?\"    \"Turn along this quiet road immediately, and don't stand mopping your  eyes in the middle of High Street! Everybody's staring at you. I  believe the policeman's going to ask if you're lost!\"    And seizing her schoolmate by the arm, Netta hustled her away from the  unwelcome attention which she was attracting. The road led to the  promenade, where the girls found an unoccupied bench, and sat down to  talk matters over.    \"One pound two and sixpence!\" ejaculated Gwen, with a sob between the  words.    \"And five shillings we promised Emma, so that makes twenty-seven and  six,\" agreed Netta briskly. \"Of course it was you who broke the china,  so it's your business to pay for it, but I'll go shares in squaring  Emma.\"    \"I can't--I can't ever pay it! Oh, I wish I was at the bottom of the  sea!\" wailed Gwen.    \"Don't be an idiot! It must be managed somehow. How much have you got  at home?\"    \"I've about fifteen shillings in my money-box.\"    \"Well, look here, I'll lend you ten, and that will just do it. We'll  each give Emma half a crown to make her hold her tongue, and we'll  settle up Parker, and then the thing will be done with. You may pay me  back as soon as you can.\"    \"You're a white angel!\"    \"No, I'm not. I'm anything but a saintly person. I'm ready to help a  chum out of a hole, though. I'll bring the money to school with me  to-morrow morning. And now, for goodness sake, do wipe your eyes, and  put your hat on straight, and try and make yourself look respectable  enough to walk down the promenade. I want to go home.\"    \"So do I,\" said Gwen. \"What's the time? I mustn't miss the next bus.\"    \"It's twenty past five.\"    \"Oh, horrors! And the bus goes at half-past! Can I possibly catch it?\"    \"I'll say goodbye if you're going to pelt along the promenade. I hate  rushing.\"    \"Goodbye! And thank you a hundred thousand times!\"    It was only as Gwen was scurrying along the asphalted walk that it  struck her that, after all, Netta was getting rather easily out of the  scrape. Of course she, Gwen, had knocked over the box of china, but it  was Netta who had taken her into Miss Roscoe's room, and who was  therefore in a sense responsible for the whole affair. Well, she was  glad enough to find help on any terms; she did not know how she was  going to repay Netta the money, but that might wait. It was sufficient  for the present that the tea set could be replaced without any fear of  discovery. She hurried breathlessly on, fearing to miss the omnibus;  taking any short cuts she knew, and breaking into a run when she  reached the Ditton Road. She could see the omnibus standing at its  starting-place, and hoped it might be just possible to arrive in time.  As she tore along the footpath, she noticed a boy a few yards in front  of her who was running equally quickly, or even faster.    \"I wonder if he's trying to catch it too?\" she thought, and envied his  longer legs and freedom from hampering skirts. \"Oh! it's actually  going! What a shame!\"    The boy made a spurt, and shouted and whistled after the retreating  omnibus, but it was not of the slightest avail; neither the conductor  nor the driver took any notice. Realizing the hopelessness of his  efforts, the boy stopped and saw Gwen, who came panting up.    \"No use, it's gone too far!\" he exclaimed. \"It's an atrocious swindle!  Those men never look. I suppose you were trying to catch it too?\"    \"Yes. I always go by the 4.20.\"    \"So do I; so it's a nuisance to miss this. We're out of luck to-day.\"    Gwen knew the boy quite well by sight, as for the last few weeks he  had been a fellow passenger morning and evening in the omnibus. He was  a jolly-looking fellow, about her own age or perhaps a little older,  with a brown skin and very twinkling, brown eyes. He wore a  grammar-school cap, and carried some books, so she could guess his  occupation in Stedburgh.    \"I believe the next goes at half-past six,\" he remarked ruefully. \"But  you won't catch me waiting for it I shall walk.\"    \"So shall I,\" agreed Gwen. \"Walking's better fun any time than  standing waiting,\" and she suited her action to her words. The boy  kept by her side, evidently not unpleased to have a companion to talk  to.    \"You're one of the Gascoyne girls, aren't you?\" he began. \"I see the  whole lot of you every day cramming into the bus. Aren't you the one  they call Gwen?\"    \"I believe I am.\"    \"It's you who's generally left something behind, or lost something, or  got yourself into some kind of a pickle; then the one with her hair  turned up scolds.\"    \"That's Winnie,\" chuckled Gwen.    \"Those two youngsters are cheeky imps. Tell them they'll get their  heads smacked some day!\"    \"They often do at home.\"    \"Serve 'em right. I'm glad to hear it. How many more are there of you  at home?\"    \"Only two.\"    \"Quite enough, I should think!\"    \"Thank you! You've asked all about my family, but you haven't told me  who you are.\"    \"Why, I thought you knew. My name is Dick Chambers. My father is Dr.  Chambers, who's just taken Dr. Harrison's practice.\"    \"At North Ditton?\"    \"Yes, we only came six weeks ago. Dr. Harrison has gone to London.\"    [Illustration: GWEN MEETS DICK]    \"I knew Dr. Harrison,\" said Gwen. \"He came to see us when we had  scarlatina, and gave us some loathly medicine!\"    \"Dad can do a little in that line!\" laughed Dick. \"He once made me  drink asafoetida when I was a kid, to cure me of sampling bottles in  the surgery.\"    \"Is it nasty?\"    \"It smells like a defunct rat, so you can imagine the taste.\"    \"Ugh!\"    \"He doesn't give such bad things to his patients, though. There's some  quite decent stuff in the dispensary, and sometimes the bottles are  coloured pink, especially if they're for girls. I'm going to be a  doctor when I grow up.\"    \"I suppose you'll help your father. Have you any brothers and  sisters?\"    \"Not a single one.\"    \"Oh, I should think that's rather slow!\"    \"I don't find it so. There's always plenty to do.\"    \"Do you like North Ditton?\"    \"Oh, yes, pretty well! It's nicer than Essington, where we lived  before.\"    \"Do you like the Grammar School?\"    \"Fairly. The chaps are rather a rotten set, and the Head's  unspeakable.\"    Chatting thus, Gwen found the four miles to North Ditton wonderfully  short ones, but when she had said goodbye to her new friend, and was  trudging along the road to Skelwick by herself, she had time for many  unpleasant reflections. At one blow this afternoon, she had sacrificed  not only all the money in her savings box, but had got into debt as  well--a debt which she had no present prospect of paying. It was most  aggravating to have to empty her private bank; the contents were the  accumulation of several little gifts that had been sent by her uncles  and aunts on her last birthday, and even so far back as last  Christmas. How would she explain, if Beatrice asked what had become of  her money? She groaned as she splashed, recklessly through the puddles  left by the morning's rain. She could foresee many difficulties ahead,  especially at Christmas time.    The family had finished tea when she reached home, and Beatrice, grown  uneasy at her absence, greeted her with upbraidings.    \"Where have you been, Gwen? Why didn't you come with the others?  Winnie nearly lost the bus with going back to look for you. You know  quite well you mustn't stay behind like this. Answer me at once! Where  were you?\"    \"I went along the promenade with Netta Goodwin, then I missed the 5.30  and had to walk all the way home. That's where I've been, and you may  scold as much as you like--I don't care.\"    \"Oh, Gwen!\" exclaimed Winnie.    \"I don't. I'm not going to be ordered about by Beatrice, and treated  as if I were a baby. I'm surely old enough to manage my own affairs!\"    Gwen was tired out with her six-mile tramp, and hungry, and very  miserable, or I think she would not have talked in so lawless and  foolish a strain.    Beatrice gazed at her in amazement. Gwen had often been naughty, but  had never before ventured thus to wave the flag of defiance.    \"I shall have to get Father to speak to you,\" she replied gravely.  \"He's gone over to Hethersedge to take the temperance meeting. He  started at five o'clock. You'd better have tea now. Nellie has made  you some more, in the little blue pot, and we kept you a potato cake,  though you don't deserve it. Father will be very astonished and sorry  when I tell him what you've said.\"    Gwen ate her meal with a big lump in her throat. She had not meant to  rebel openly, but she had lost her temper, and"]]]
