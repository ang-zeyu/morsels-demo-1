So the people ceased to honor him during his lifetime, and quietly  forgot him after his decease. Once in a while, it is true, his memory  was brought up in connection with the magnificent palace which he had  built, and which had long ago been turned into a hotel for the  accommodation of strangers, multitudes of whom came, every summer, to  visit that famous natural curiosity, the Great Stone Face. The man of  prophecy was yet to come.      III    It so happened that a native-born son of the valley, many years before,  had enlisted as a soldier, and, after a great deal of hard fighting, had  now become an illustrious commander. Whatever he may be called in  history, he was known in camps and on the battlefield under the nickname  of Old Blood-and-Thunder. This war-worn veteran, being now weary of a  military life, and of the roll of the drum and the clangor of the  trumpet that had so long been ringing in his ears, had lately signified  a purpose of returning to his native valley, hoping to find repose where  he remembered to have left it. The inhabitants, his old neighbors and  their grown-up children, were resolved to welcome the [v]renowned  warrior with a salute of cannon and a public dinner; and all the more  enthusiastically because it was believed that at last the likeness of  the Great Stone Face had actually appeared. A friend of Old  Blood-and-Thunder, traveling through the valley, was said to have been  struck with the resemblance. Moreover, the schoolmates and early  acquaintances of the general were ready to testify, on oath, that, to  the best of their recollection, the general had been exceedingly like  the majestic image, even when a boy, only that the idea had never  occurred to them at that period. Great, therefore, was the excitement  throughout the valley; and many people, who had never once thought of  glancing at the Great Stone Face for years before, now spent their time  in gazing at it, for the sake of knowing exactly how General  Blood-and-Thunder looked.    On the day of the great festival, Ernest, and all the other people of  the valley, left their work and proceeded to the spot where the banquet  was prepared. As he approached, the loud voice of the Rev. Dr.  Battleblast was heard, beseeching a blessing on the good things set  before them, and on the distinguished friend of peace in whose honor  they were assembled. The tables were arranged in a cleared space of the  woods, shut in by the surrounding trees, except where a vista opened  eastward, and afforded a distant view of the Great Stone Face. Over the  general's chair, which was a relic from the home of Washington, there  was an arch of green boughs and laurel surmounted by his country's  banner, beneath which he had won his victories. Our friend Ernest  raised himself on his tiptoes, in hopes to get a glimpse of the  celebrated guest; but there was a mighty crowd about the tables anxious  to hear the toasts and speeches, and to catch any word that might fall  from the general in reply; and a volunteer company, doing duty as a  guard, pricked with their bayonets at any particularly quiet person  among the throng. So Ernest, being of a modest character, was thrust  quite into the background, where he could see no more of Old  Blood-and-Thunder's face than if it had been still blazing on the  battlefield. To console himself he turned toward the Great Stone Face,  which, like a faithful and long-remembered friend, looked back and  smiled upon him through the forest. Meantime, however, he could overhear  the remarks of various individuals who were comparing the features of  the hero with the face on the distant mountain side.    \"'Tis the same face, to a hair!\" cried one man, cutting a caper for joy.    \"Wonderfully like, that's a fact!\" responded another.    \"Like! Why, I call it Old Blood-and-Thunder himself, in a monstrous  looking-glass!\" cried a third. \"And why not? He's the greatest man of  this or any other age, beyond a doubt.\"    \"The general! The general!\" was now the cry. \"Hush! Silence! Old  Blood-and-Thunder's going to make a speech.\"    Even so; for, the cloth being removed, the general's health had been  drunk amid shouts of applause, and he now stood upon his feet to thank  the company. Ernest saw him. There he was, over the shoulders of the  crowd, from the two glittering epaulets and embroidered collar upward,  beneath the arch of green boughs with intertwined laurel, and the banner  drooping as if to shade his brow! And there, too, visible in the same  glance, appeared the Great Stone Face! And was there, indeed, such a  resemblance as the crowd had testified? Alas, Ernest could not recognize  it! He beheld a war-worn and weather-beaten countenance, full of energy,  and expressive of an iron will; but the gentle wisdom, the deep, broad,  tender sympathies were altogether wanting in Old Blood-and-Thunder's  visage.    \"This is not the man of prophecy,\" sighed Ernest to himself, as he made  his way out of the throng. \"And must the world wait longer yet?\"    The mists had gathered about the distant mountain side, and there were  seen the grand and awful features of the Great Stone Face, awful but  benignant, as if a mighty angel were sitting among the hills and  enrobing himself in a cloud vesture of gold and purple. As he looked,  Ernest could hardly believe but that a smile beamed over the whole  visage, with a radiance still brightening, although without motion of  the lips. It was probably the effect of the western sunshine, melting  the thin vapors that had swept between him and the object that he had  gazed at. But--as it always did--the aspect of his marvelous friend made  Ernest as hopeful as if he had never hoped in vain.    \"Fear not, Ernest,\" said his heart, even as if the Great Face were  whispering him--\"fear not, Ernest.\"      IV    More years sped swiftly and tranquilly away. Ernest still dwelt in his  native valley, and was now a man of middle age. By slow degrees he had  become known among the people. Now, as heretofore, he labored for his  bread, and was the same simple-hearted man that he had always been. But  he had thought and felt so much, he had given so many of the best hours  of his life to unworldly hopes for some great good to mankind, that it  seemed as though he had been talking with the angels, and had imbibed a  portion of their wisdom unawares. It was visible in the calm beneficence  of his daily life, the quiet stream of which had made a wide, green  margin all along its course. Not a day passed by that the world was not  the better because this man, humble as he was, had lived. He never  stepped aside from his own path, yet would always reach a blessing to  his neighbor. Almost involuntarily, too, he had become a preacher. The  pure and high simplicity of his thought, which took shape in the good  deeds that dropped silently from his hand, flowered also forth in  speech. He uttered truths that molded the lives of those who heard him.  His hearers, it may be, never suspected that Ernest, their own neighbor  and familiar friend, was more than an ordinary man; least of all did  Ernest himself suspect it; but thoughts came out of his mouth that no  other human lips had spoken.    When the people's minds had had a little time to cool, they were ready  enough to acknowledge their mistake in imagining a similarity between  General Blood-and-Thunder and the benign visage on the mountain side.  But now, again, there were reports and many paragraphs in the  newspapers, affirming that the likeness of the Great Stone Face had  appeared upon the broad shoulders of a certain eminent [v]statesman. He,  like Mr. Gathergold and Old Blood-and-Thunder, was a native of the  valley, but had left it in his early days, and taken up the trades of  law and politics. Instead of the rich man's wealth and the warrior's  sword he had but a tongue, and it was mightier than both together. So  wonderfully eloquent was he that, whatever he might choose to say, his  hearers had no choice but to believe him; wrong looked like right, and  right like wrong. His voice, indeed, was a magic instrument: sometimes  it rumbled like the thunder; sometimes it warbled like the sweetest  music. In good truth, he was a wondrous man; and when his tongue had  acquired him all other imaginable success,--when it had been heard in  halls of state and in the courts of princes,--after it had made him  known all over the world, even as a voice crying from shore to  shore,--it finally persuaded his countrymen to select him for the  presidency. Before this time,--indeed, as soon as he began to grow  celebrated,--his admirers had found out the resemblance between him and  the Great Stone Face; and so much were they struck by it that throughout  the country this distinguished gentleman was known by the name of Old  Stony Phiz.    While his friends were doing their best to make him President, Old Stony  Phiz, as he was called, set out on a visit to the valley where he was  born. Of course he had no other object than to shake hands with his  fellow-citizens, and neither thought nor cared about any effect which  his progress through the country might have upon the election.  Magnificent preparations were made to receive the [v]illustrious  statesmen; a cavalcade of horsemen set forth to meet him at the boundary  line of the State, and all the people left their business and gathered  along the wayside to see him pass. Among these was Ernest. Though more  than once disappointed, as we have seen, he had such a hopeful and  confiding nature that he was always ready to believe in whatever seemed  beautiful and good. He kept his heart continually open, and thus was  sure to catch the blessing from on high, when it should come. So now  again, as buoyantly as ever, he went forth "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19723"],[0,"The Cliff Ruins of Canyon de Chelly, Arizona (#6)"],[1,"its own village. Incursions by neighboring wild  tribes, or by hostile neighbors, and constant annoyance and loss at  their hands, gradually compelled the removal of these little villages to  sites more easily defended, and also forced the aggregation of various  related gentes into one group or village. At a still later period the  same motive, considerably emphasized perhaps, compelled a further  removal to even more difficult sites. The Tusayan villages at the time  of the Spanish discovery were located on the foothills of the mesas, and  many pueblo villages at that period occupied similar sites. Actuated by  fear of the Ute and Comanche, and perhaps of the Spaniards, the  inhabitants soon after moved to the top of the mesa, where they now are.  Many villages stopped at this stage. Some were in this stage at the time  of the discovery--Acoma, for example. Finally, whole villages whose  inhabitants spoke the same language combined to form one larger village,  which, depending now on size and numbers for defense, was again located  on a site convenient for horticulture.    The process sketched above was by no means continuous. The population  was in slow but practically constant movement, much the same as that now  taking place in the Zuni country; it was a slow migration. Outlying  settlements were established at points convenient to cultivable fields,  and probably were intended to be occupied only during the summer.  Sometimes these temporary sites might be found more convenient than that  of the parent village, and it would gradually come about that some of  the inhabitants would remain there all the year. Eventually the  temporary settlement might outgrow the parent, and would in turn put out  other temporary settlements. This process would be possible only during  prolonged periods of peace, but it is known to have taken place in  several regions. Necessarily hundreds of small settlements, ranging in  size from one room to a great many, would be established, and as the  population moved onward would be abandoned, without ever developing into  regular villages occupied all the year. It is believed that many of the  single house remains of Mr Bandelier's classification[12] belong to this  type, as do also many cavate lodges, and in the present paper it will be  shown that some at least of the cliff ruins belong to the same category.        [Footnote 12: See a paper by the author on \"Aboriginal remains in      Verde valley, Arizona,\" in 13th Ann. Rept. Bureau of Ethnology, p.      179 et seq.]    The cliff ruins are a striking feature, and the ordinary traveler is apt  to overlook the more important ruins which sometimes, if not generally,  are associated with them. The study of the ruins in Canyon de Chelly has  led to the conclusion that the cliff ruins there are generally  subordinate structures, connected with and inhabited at the same time as  a number of larger home villages located on the canyon bottom, and  occupying much the same relation to the latter that Moen-kapi does to  Oraibi, or that Nutria, Pescado, and Ojo Caliente do to Zuni; and that  they are the functional analogues of the \"watch towers\" of the San Juan  and of Zuni, and the brush shelters or \"kisis\" of Tusayan: in other  words, they were horticultural outlooks occupied only during the farming  season.    Mr G. Nordenskioeld, who examined a number of cliff and other ruins in  the Mancos canyon and the Mesa Verde region, adopts[13] a very simple  classification, as follows:       I. Ruins in the valleys, on the plains, or on the plateaus.    II. Ruins in caves in the walls of the canyons, subdivided as follows:        (a) Cave dwellings, or caves inhabited without the erection           of any buildings within them.        (b) Cliff dwellings, or buildings erected in caves.        [Footnote 13: The Cliff Dwellers of the Mesa Verde, pp. 9 and 114.]    From its topographic character it might be expected that the Canyon de  Chelly ruins would hardly come within a scheme of classification based  upon those found in the open country; and here, if anywhere, we should  find corroboration of the old idea that the cliff ruins were the homes  and last refuge of a race harassed by powerful enemies and finally  driven to the construction of dwellings in inaccessible cliffs, where a  last ineffectual stand was made against their foes; or the more recent  theory that they represent an early stage in the development of pueblo  architecture, when the pueblo builders were few in number and surrounded  by numerous enemies. Neither of these theories are in accord with the  facts of observation. The still later idea that the cliff dwellings were  used as places of refuge by various pueblo tribes who, when the occasion  for such use was passed, returned to their original homes, or to others  constructed like them, may explain some of the cliff ruins, but if  applicable at all to those of De Chelly, it applies only to a small  number of them.      [Illustration: Plate XLIII    Detailed Map of Part of Canyon De Chelly    Showing Areas of Cultivatable Land]    The ruins of De Chelly show unmistakably several periods of occupancy,  extending over considerable time and each fairly complete. They fall  easily into the classification previously suggested, and exhibit various  types, but the earliest and the latest forms are not found. In the  descriptions which follow the classification below has been employed:        I--Old villages on open sites.     II--Home villages on bottom lands.    III--Home villages located for defense.     IV--Cliff outlooks or farming shelters.      I--OLD VILLAGES ON OPEN SITES    In the upper part of the canyon, and extending into what we may call the  middle region, there are a number of ruins that seem to be out of place  in this locality. They are exactly similar to hundreds of ruins found in  the open country; such, for example, as the older villages of Tusayan,  located on low foothills at the foot of the mesa, and the peculiar  topographic characteristics of the location have not made the slightest  impression on them. These ruins are located on gentle slopes, the  foothills of the talus, as it were, away from the cliffs, and are now  marked only by scattered fragments of building stone and broken pottery.  The ground plans are in all cases indistinguishable; in only a few  instances can even a short wall line be traced. They seem to have been  located without special reference to large areas of cultivable land,  although they always command small areas of such land. There is a  remarkable uniformity in ruins of this type in character of site  occupied, outlook, and general appearance. They are always close to the  stream bed, seldom more than 10 or 12 feet above it, and the sites were  chosen apparently without any reference to their defensibility. A  typical example occurs at the point marked 60 on the detailed map (plate  XLIII), another occurs at 58, and another at 52. One of the largest  examples is in the lower part of the canyon. At the junction of Del  Muerto there is a large mass of rock standing out alone and extending  nearly to the full height of the canyon walls. On the south it is  connected with the main wall back of it by a low tongue of rock,  sparsely covered in places by soil and sand, and on the top of this  tongue or saddle there is a large ruin of the type described, but no  ground plan can now be made out. Possibly the obliterated appearance of  this ruin and of others of the same class is due to the use of the  material, ready to hand and of the proper size, in later structures. It  is known that a similar appearance was produced in Tusayan by such a  cause. The old village of Walpi, on a foothill below the mesa point and  the site of the village at the time of the Spanish conquest, presents an  appearance of great antiquity, although it was partly occupied so late  as fifty years ago. When the movement to the summit of the mesa became  general, the material of the old houses was utilized in the construction  of the new ones, and at the present day it can almost be said that not  one stone remains above another. So complete is the obliteration that no  ground plan can be made out.    If similar conditions prevailed in De Chelly, there might be many more  ruins of this class than those so far discovered. Even those found are  not easily distinguished and might easily be passed over. Possibly there  were small ruins of this type scattered over the whole canyon bottom. An  example which occurs at the point marked 12 on the map, and shown in  plate XLIV, presents no trace on the surface except some potsherds,  which in this locality mean nothing. The site is a low hill or end of a  slope, the top of which is perhaps 25 feet above the stream bed, but  separated from it by a belt of recent alluvium carpeted with grass. The  hill itself was formed of talus, covered with alluvium, all but a small  portion of which was subsequently cut away, leaving an almost vertical  face 15 or 18 feet high. In this face the ends or vertical sections of  several walls can be seen; one of them is nearly 3 feet thick and  extends 4 feet below the present ground surface.    The filling of these ruins to a depth of 4 or 5 feet and the almost  complete absence of surface remains or indications does not necessarily  imply a remote antiquity, although it suggests it. During the fall and  early winter months tremendous sand storms rage in the canyon; the wind  sweeps through the gorge with an almost irresistible power, carrying  with it such immense quantities of sand that objects a few hundred feet  distant can not be distinguished. These sand storms were and are potent  factors in producing the picturesque features of the red cliffs forming  the canyon walls; but they are constructive as well as destructive, and  cavities and hollow places in exposed situations such as the canyon  bottom are soon filled up.
