The series concludes with a  notice _Ad interventorem_, a person whom we may call _A talkative  intruder_:      Non patitur quenquam coram se scriba loquentem:      Non est hic quod agas, garrule, perge foras.    How useful such an admonition would be in modern libraries, if only it  could be enforced!    So late as the end of the twelfth century I find a Bishop who bequeathed  his library to a church describing it as \"the contents of my press  (_plenarium armarium meum_).\"    Gradually, however, other methods came into fashion, due probably to the  introduction of the handsome bindings of which I have already spoken. Some  particulars have fortunately been preserved of the cost of fitting up a  certain tower in the Louvre between 1364 and 1368, to contain the books  belonging to Charles the Fifth of France, from which much useful  information may be extracted. The fittings of the older library in the  palace on the Isle de la Cite were to be taken down and altered, and set  up in the new room. Two carpenters are paid for \"having taken to pieces  all the cases (_bancs_) and two wheels (_roes_), that is revolving desks,  which were in the king's library in the palace, and transported them to  the Louvre...; and for having put all together again, and hung up the  cases (_lettrins_) in the two upper stages of the tower that looks toward  the Falconry, to put the king's books in; and for having panelled ... the  first of those two stories all round inside.\" Next a wire-worker  (_cagetier_) is paid \"for having made trellises of wire in front of two  casements and two windows ... to keep out birds and other beasts  (_oyseaux et autres bestes_) by reason of, and protection for, the books  that shall be placed there.\"    The words _bancs_ and _lettrins_, which I have translated \"cases,\" are  both frequently used. The first commonly denotes the cases in monastic  libraries, and the second is the usual word for a reading-desk. I think,  therefore, that the two words were applied to describe the same piece of  furniture, as \"stall\" and \"desk\" were with us. I am now going to shew you  two pictures of rooms arranged for study, which fit the above description  very well. The first is from a French translation of Boccaccio, _Des cas  des maleureux nobles hommes et femmes_, written and illuminated in  Flanders for King Henry the Seventh[2]. Two gentlemen are studying at a  revolving desk, which can be raised or lowered by a screw. This is  evidently the \"wheel\" of the French king's library. Behind are their  books, either resting on a desk hung against the wall (which is  panelled), or lying on a shelf beneath the desk. The second is also  Flemish, of the same date, from a copy of the _Miroir historial_[3]. It  represents a monk, probably the author of the book, writing in his study.  Behind him are three desks, one above the other, hung against the wall,  with books, as in the first picture, resting upon them.    Some such arrangement as this must have been long in fashion. Libraries  such as those of Diane de Poitiers and Francis the First could not have  been bestowed in any other way; and in fact, when books are enriched with  metal-work, or have specially elaborate ornaments on their sides, a desk  of some sort is indispensable.    Humbler scholars had to content themselves with small cupboards  constructed in the thickness of the wall, or hung against it, as in the  picture I will next shew you, from a French translation of Valerius  Maximus, copied for King Edward the Fourth, and dated 1479[4]. You will  observe that the lower part of the window is fitted with trellises as in  the French king's library, not casements. The upper part only is glazed.    Another, and apparently very usual way of bestowing books, especially when  they were not numerous, was to place them in a sort of cupboard under the  sloping desk on which the owner read or wrote. An excellent specimen of  this device--which Richard de Bury specially commends, as being modelled  on the Ark, in the side of which the book of the Law was put--is to be  found in the _Ship of Fools_ (1498). Another, of a curiously modern type,  occurs in an _Hours_ in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, executed about  1445 for Isabel, Duchess of Brittany.    Sometimes this book-cupboard supported a revolving desk, which could be  raised or depressed by the help of a central screw--like those I shewed  you just now; sometimes the desk alone appears, with books laid on it.  The forms given to these pieces of furniture by the ingenuity of those who  made them are infinite; and they often include beautiful designs for  armchairs, fitted with desks for writing. I will shew you just one--not  because it is specially beautiful, but because it gives a quaint picture  of a scholar's room at the beginning of the fifteenth century[5].    Here Time--as represented by yonder clock--holds up his finger and bids me  stop. I would fain have shewn you more pictures--but I hope that you have  seen a sufficient number to give you some idea of the surroundings in  which our forefathers read and wrote. I am sure that only in this way can  we realise that they were real living people--not mere names. Their modes  of thought were far different from ours; they may have wasted their time  in verbal subtleties, and uncritical tales; but the more we study what  they did, the more we shall realise how laborious, how artistic, how  conscientious they were; and amid all the developments of the nineteenth  century, we shall gratefully confess that the Middle Ages rocked the  cradle of our knowledge, and that we \"See but their hope become reality.\"          ILLUSTRATIONS.    1.

Then all the Royalist members of  the Corporation were removed, and both the bishop, Williams, and the  dean, Scott, were deprived of their offices. They left the country, and  the dean died in a debtor's prison in 1646. Fairfax, however, who  remained as governor of the city, maintained the minster in scrupulous  repair, and paid all the salaries of the necessary officials. A short  time before the Restoration a large sum of money was spent on the bells.  It has been said, indeed, that the Puritans wished to pull down the  chapter-house, but there is no authority for the statement. But the  control of the minster was taken out of the hands of the chapter and  given to the Corporation, and this transference was only effected by the  interference of the troops. The organ given by Charles was also taken  down, and silver candlesticks and other ornaments, including the brass  about the shrine, perhaps, of St. William, and also the lectern in the  choir, were sold for the repair of the fabric and bells. In 1646 the  organ loft, the canopies over the altar in the side choir, and the font  were removed. In 1647 a cushion was made of the dossal. The library was  left untouched and thrown open to the public, and the keys of the  minster placed in charge of the Mayor and Corporation. In place of the  dean and chapter, the precentor, and chancellor--all removed--four city  preachers were chosen by the Assembly of Divines, and paid out of the  revenues of the minster. Meanwhile the churches in the city suffered far  more than the minster itself. In 1646 all \"superstitious pictures in  glass\" and images were ordered to be broken, and the fonts were removed.  In 1648 twenty-four churches in the city were without incumbents.    After the Restoration the Corporation did everything in their power to  resist a return to the old order of things, and in 1663 there was a  small rebellion, as a result of which twenty-one persons were executed  at York. Discontent, however, continued, and in 1682 it became necessary  to appoint Sir John Reresby governor of York, with a garrison of 500  men. The governor said that York was one of the most factious towns in  the kingdom. About this time, also, the dean and chapter caused a riot  by issuing a proclamation forbidding the nave to be used as a promenade.  They succeeded, however, in finally putting an end to the practice.    In 1686 Lady Strafford, daughter-in-law of the great Strafford, was  buried in the minster. Party spirit still ran very high, and the mob  rushed at the hearse and endeavoured to tear the coats of arms from it.  The military was called out, and there was a sharp struggle in the  minster itself.    The Catholic designs of James II. were ill received in York. His  proclamation for liberty of conscience was read in hardly any of the  York churches, and an attempt to stock the Corporation with Roman  Catholics was resisted. At last there came a crisis. The king appointed  James Smith, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Callipolis, one of his four  vicars-apostolic, and in August 1688 he appeared at York. The  archbishopric had been vacant for two years, and it was rumoured that  the king intended to appoint Smith to the see.    York, therefore, was ripe for the revolution, and it broke out there on  November 22. Lamplough of Exeter, a discreet and timely supporter of  both James and William, was appointed archbishop, and Smith was attacked  by the mob as he was passing through the streets in procession. His  silver-gilt crozier, which had been given to him by Catharine of  Braganza, was torn from him and sent to the vestry of the minster, where  it still remains. It is seven feet in length. Smith fled to  Wycliffe-on-Tees, where he spent the rest of his life.    [Illustration: The Shambles.]    Since the reign of James II., and the last serious attempt to establish  the Roman Catholic religion in the country, the history of both the city  and the see of York has been uneventful. The city itself has declined in  importance, and is now hardly even one of the larger towns in Yorkshire.  It is known and visited chiefly for its historic interest and its  minster. The see has experienced only peaceful changes, and its  archbishops are concerned more with questions of Church discipline than  with politics. The minster has suffered two serious fires, and a  restoration, carried out on the whole moderately and judiciously.          CHAPTER II    HISTORY OF THE BUILDING      The architectural history of the minster is somewhat vague and  uncertain, and has been the subject of several disputes. It will be as  well, perhaps, before entering into details, to give a table of  approximate dates, both of the different parts of the minster as it now  stands and of the buildings which preceded it. These dates are mostly  sanctioned by the authority of Professor Willis.    Edwin's Wooden Chapel                                   627 A.D.

The fact that a wooden chapel was erected for the baptism of Edwin  in 627 seems to show that no Christian church had remained at York from  Roman days, as at Canterbury; this chapel, therefore, is the first  Christian building in York of which we have any definite record. The  church of stone with which it was immediately replaced was finished by  Oswald, after the death of Edwin in battle; whose head was carried  thither and placed in the Chapel of St. Gregory. It has been supposed  that there are remains of this original stone church in the crypt.    In sixty years Edwin's church had fallen into great disrepair. It was  restored by Archbishop Wilfrid about 669. The following account of the  dilapidated condition of the building as he found it is taken from a  versified life of Wilfrid, ascribed to Frithegode, a monk of the tenth  century:--        Ecclesiae vero fundamina cassa vetustae,      Culmina dissuto violabant trabe palambes,      Humida contrito stillabant assere tecta;      Livida nudato suggrundia pariete passa      Imbricibus nullis, pluriae quacunque vagantur,      Pendula discissis fluitant laquearia tignis,      Fornice marcebant cataractae dilapidato.    Wilfrid glazed the windows, repaired the holes, painted and decorated,  and, strange to say, whitewashed the building.    We now come to the first disputed point in the history of the minster.  In the chronicle of Richard Hovenden it is stated that _Monasterium in  Eboraca Civitate Succensum est nono Kalendas Maii Feria prima_--that is  to say, that a church was burnt down in the city of York on Sunday the  23rd of April 741 A.D. It has been contended that the word _monasterium_  need not of necessity mean the minster, that the word _civitas_ may  perhaps mean the diocese, the ecclesiastical state, and not the city of  York, and that, therefore, the church mentioned may be not the minster,  but some other large church in the city or diocese of York. Professor  Willis is of opinion that this is probably the case.    In the poem of Alcuin or Flaccus Albinus, there is a passage speaking of  a church built by Albert (767-780), in the following terms:--        Ast nova Basilicae mirae structura diebus      Praesulis hujus erat jam caepta, peracta, sacrata,      Haec nimis alta domus solidis suffulta columnis      Suppositae quae slant curvatis arcubus, intus      Emicat egregiis laquearibus atque fenestris      Pulchraque porticibus fulget circumdata multis,      Plurima diversis retinens solaria tectis,      Quae triginta tenet variis ornatibus aras.    It is plain that this church, wherever it was, and the poem does not  mention its locality, was a very important one. It was very lofty, and  had many porches, or apses (_porticus_ may mean either), and thirty  altars.    Just before this passage in the poem there is an account of altars set  up by the archbishop, probably in the cathedral. Professor Willis thinks  that if the church referred to immediately after were the cathedral, an  account of altars set up in it would not be given before an account of  the building of the church itself. But, as Professor Freeman points out,  it is most improbable that two writers, the chronicler and"]]]
