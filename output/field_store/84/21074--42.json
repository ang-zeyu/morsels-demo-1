The mount Frank trotted out of the corral for me was a pure white,  beautiful mustang, nervous, sensitive, quivering. I watched Frank put  on the saddle, and when he called me I did not fail to catch a covert  twinkle in his merry brown eyes. Looking away toward Buckskin Mountain,  which was coincidentally in the direction of home, I said to myself:  \"This may be where you get on, but most certainly it is where you get  off!\"    Jones was already riding far beyond the corral, as I could see by a  cloud of dust; and I set off after him, with the painful consciousness  that I must have looked to Frank and Jim much as Central Park  equestrians had often looked to me. Frank shouted after me that he  would catch up with us out on the range. I was not in any great hurry  to overtake Jones, but evidently my horse's inclinations differed from  mine; at any rate, he made the dust fly, and jumped the little sage  bushes.    Jones, who had tarried to inspect one of the pools--formed of running  water from the corrals--greeted me as I came up with this cheerful  observation.    \"What in thunder did Frank give you that white nag for? The buffalo  hate white horses--anything white. They're liable to stampede off the  range, or chase you into the canyon.\"    I replied grimly that, as it was certain something was going to happen,  the particular circumstance might as well come off quickly.    We rode over the rolling plain with a cool, bracing breeze in our  faces. The sky was dull and mottled with a beautiful cloud effect that  presaged wind. As we trotted along Jones pointed out to me and  descanted upon the nutritive value of three different kinds of grass,  one of which he called the Buffalo Pea, noteworthy for a beautiful blue  blossom. Soon we passed out of sight of the cabin, and could see only  the billowy plain, the red tips of the stony wall, and the  black-fringed crest of Buckskin. After riding a while we made out some  cattle, a few of which were on the range, browsing in the lee of a  ridge. No sooner had I marked them than Jones let out another Comanche  yell.    \"Wolf!\" he yelled; and spurring his big bay, he was off like the wind.    A single glance showed me several cows running as if bewildered, and  near them a big white wolf pulling down a calf. Another white wolf  stood not far off. My horse jumped as if he had been shot; and the  realization darted upon me that here was where the certain something  began. Spot--the mustang had one black spot in his pure white--snorted  like I imagined a blooded horse might, under dire insult. Jones's bay  had gotten about a hundred paces the start. I lived to learn that Spot  hated to be left behind; moreover, he would not be left behind; he was  the swiftest horse on the range, and proud of the distinction. I cast  one unmentionable word on the breeze toward the cabin and Frank, then  put mind and muscle to the sore task of remaining with Spot. Jones was  born on a saddle, and had been taking his meals in a saddle for about  sixty-three years, and the bay horse could run. Run is not a felicitous  word--he flew. And I was rendered mentally deranged for the moment to  see that hundred paces between the bay and Spot materially lessen at  every jump. Spot lengthened out, seemed to go down near the ground, and  cut the air like a high-geared auto. If I had not heard the fast  rhythmic beat of his hoofs, and had not bounced high into the air at  every jump, I would have been sure I was riding a bird. I tried to stop  him. As well might I have tried to pull in the Lusitania with a thread.  Spot was out to overhaul that bay, and in spite of me, he was doing it.  The wind rushed into my face and sang in my ears. Jones seemed the  nucleus of a sort of haze, and it grew larger and larger. Presently he  became clearly defined in my sight; the violent commotion under me  subsided; I once more felt the saddle, and then I realized that Spot  had been content to stop alongside of Jones, tossing his head and  champing his bit.    \"Well, by George! I didn't know you were in the stretch,\" cried my  companion. \"That was a fine little brush. We must have come several  miles. I'd have killed those wolves if I'd brought a gun. The big one  that had the calf was a bold brute. He never let go until I was within  fifty feet of him. Then I almost rode him down. I don't think the calf  was much hurt. But those blood-thirsty devils will return, and like as  not get the calf. That's the worst of cattle raising. Now, take the  buffalo. Do you suppose those wolves could have gotten a buffalo calf  out from under the mother? Never. Neither could a whole band of wolves.  Buffalo stick close together, and the little ones do not stray. When  danger threatens, the herd closes in and faces it and fights. That is  what is grand about the buffalo and what made them once roam the  prairies in countless, endless droves.\"    From the highest elevation in that part of the range we viewed the  surrounding ridges, flats and hollows, searching for the buffalo. At  length we spied a cloud of dust rising from behind an undulating mound,  then big black dots hove in sight.    \"Frank has rounded up the herd, and is driving it this way. We'll  wait,\" said Jones.    Though the buffalo appeared to be moving fast, a long time elapsed  before they reached the foot of our outlook. They lumbered along in a  compact mass, so dense that I could not count them, but I estimated the  number at seventy-five. Frank was riding zigzag behind them, swinging  his lariat and yelling. When he espied us he reined in his horse and  waited. Then the herd slowed down, halted and began browsing.    \"Look at the cattalo calves,\" cried Jones, in ecstatic tones. \"See how  shy they are, how close they stick to their mothers.\"    The little dark-brown fellows were plainly frightened. I made several  unsuccessful attempts to photograph them, and gave it up when Jones  told me not to ride too close and that it would be better to wait till  we had them in the corral.    He took my camera and instructed me to go on ahead, in the rear of the  herd. I heard the click of the instrument as he snapped a picture, and  then suddenly heard him shout in alarm: \"Look out! look out! pull your  horse!\"    Thundering hoof-beats pounding the earth accompanied his words. I saw a  big bull, with head down, tail raised, charging my horse. He answered  Frank's yell of command with a furious grunt. I was paralyzed at the  wonderfully swift action of the shaggy brute, and I sat helpless. Spot  wheeled as if he were on a pivot and plunged out of the way with a  celerity that was astounding. The buffalo stopped, pawed the ground,  and angrily tossed his huge head. Frank rode up to him, yelled, and  struck him with the lariat, whereupon he gave another toss of his  horns, and then returned to the herd.    \"It was that darned white nag,\" said Jones. \"Frank, it was wrong to put  an inexperienced man on Spot. For that matter, the horse should never  be allowed to go near the buffalo.\"    \"Spot knows the buffs; they'd never get to him,\" replied Frank. But the  usual spirit was absent from his voice, and he glanced at me soberly. I  knew I had turned white, for I felt the peculiar cold sensation on my  face.    \"Now, look at that, will you?\" cried Jones. \"I don't like the looks of  that.\"    He pointed to the herd. They stopped browsing, and were uneasily  shifting to and fro. The bull lifted his head; the others slowly  grouped together.    \"Storm! Sandstorm!\" exclaimed Jones, pointing desert-ward. Dark yellow  clouds like smoke were rolling, sweeping, bearing down upon us. They  expanded, blossoming out like gigantic roses, and whirled and merged  into one another, all the time rolling on and blotting out the light.    \"We've got to run. That storm may last two days,\" yelled Frank to me.  \"We've had some bad ones lately. Give your horse free rein, and cover  your face.\"    A roar, resembling an approaching storm at sea, came on puffs of wind,  as the horses got into their stride. Long streaks of dust whipped up in  different places; the silver-white grass bent to the ground; round  bunches of sage went rolling before us. The puffs grew longer,  steadier, harder. Then a shrieking blast howled on our trail, seeming  to swoop down on us with a yellow, blinding pall. I shut my eyes and  covered my face with a handkerchief. The sand blew so thick that it  filled my gloves, pebbles struck me hard enough to sting through my  coat.    Fortunately, Spot kept to an easy swinging lope, which was the most  comfortable motion for me. But I began to get numb, and could hardly  stick on the saddle. Almost before I had dared to hope, Spot stopped.  Uncovering my face, I saw Jim in the doorway of the lee side of the  cabin. The yellow, streaky, whistling clouds of sand split on the cabin  and passed on, leaving a small, dusty space of light.    \"Shore Spot do hate to be beat,\" yelled Jim, as he helped me off. I  stumbled into the cabin and fell upon a buffalo robe and lay there  absolutely spent. Jones and Frank came in a few minutes apart, each  anathematizing the gritty, powdery sand.    All day the desert storm raged and roared. The dust sifted through the  numerous cracks in the cabin burdened our clothes, spoiled our food and  blinded our eyes. Wind, snow, sleet and rainstorms are discomforting  enough under trying circumstances; but all combined, they are nothing  to the choking stinging, blinding sandstorm.    \"Shore it'll let up by sundown,\" averred Jim. And sure enough the roar  died away about five o'clock, the wind abated and the sand settled.    Just before supper, a knock sounded heavily on the cabin door. Jim  opened it to admit one of Emmett's sons and a very tall man whom none  of us knew. He was a sand-man. All that was not sand seemed a space or  two of corduroy, a big bone-handled knife, a prominent square jaw and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20571"],[0,"Woman's Work in Music (#6)"],[1,"themselves to fiction and story, while their southern brethren  sang of love. The novel, used largely in the south, was a short poem  containing some brilliant anecdote of gallantry, couched in neat phrase.  The romance, or long narrative, was by reason of its size the most  permanent of all the poetry of this age. Though written by both  Troubadours and Trouveres, the latter were far superior in style and  invention, and it is mostly their work which has survived. These  romances were sometimes in prose, but more often in poetry of extremely  smooth and flowing metre.    The romances grouped themselves in three principal cycles,--first, the  Carlovingian, including the stories of Charlemagne, of Roland and the  twelve peers, of Fierabras, and so on; second, the Arthurian, dealing  with the legends of the Round Table; and third, the Alexandrian,  containing tales of antiquity, chiefly of Alexander the Great. In the  first group, \"Brut d'Angleterre\" contains the mythical story of all the  early English kings. It was adapted from lower Brittany by Robert Wace.  A Saxon Trouvere continued this to his own time, imbuing his work with  thorough hatred of the Normans. Walter Map, Archdeacon of Oxford under  Henry II., wrote many Arthurian tales, while Chretien de Troyes wrote  the greater part of \"Sir Perceval de Galles\" in Norman-French. \"Floriant  and Florete\" is another Arthurian tale, while \"Aucassin and Nicolette,\"  of unknown authorship, is a charming romance of love in Southern France  and captivity among the Saracens.    The life of the Troubadour forms a pleasing picture in the book of  mediaeval history. He was essentially a gentleman by birth, scorning to  take pay for his songs, and often distributing the gifts he received  among his servants. He had to maintain a large retinue, and give  sumptuous entertainments, with the result that he often used up his  entire patrimony. The usual course in such cases was a trip to Palestine  with the Crusaders, and a gallant death in battle with the infidel. But  before reaching that end, his career must have been decidedly pleasant.  He would pass the winter in his castle, training himself in feats of  arms and in musical composition. At the advent of spring, he would issue  forth, followed by a train of Jongleurs singing his songs, and proceed  through field and wood to the nearest castle. Here in the evening a  great feast would be arranged, with the Jongleurs in a special  minstrels' gallery. Next day there would be music on the ramparts, or in  fair weather brocade carpets would be spread in the meadows, and knights  and ladies would listen to more songs. Here the Troubadour himself at  times deigned to perform, thus affording his hearers an unusual  privilege. Here, too, the women had a chance to show their own skill;  for, if there were no woman Trouveres, there were plenty who were well  able to hold their own in the shorter forms of the Troubadours.    That kings and princes did not disdain to become Troubadours is proved  by the example of Richard of England and the Dauphin of Auvergne. But it  is more unexpected to find a queen among their ranks, and that no less a  queen than Eleanor, wife of Henry II. of England. Her grandfather,  William of Poitou, was one of the earliest patrons of the art, and she  inherited his tastes. Her career, like his, is one of boldness and  adventure. When wife of Louis VII., before her marriage with Henry, she  set an example to chivalry by going to the Crusades with that French  king, and not in the capacity of wife, but rather as an Amazon warrior.  She gathered around her a troupe of kindred spirits, and, equipped in  the most graceful array that armourers and milliners could devise,  started off at the head of her husband's knights. Her campaign was  conducted on principles of pleasure rather than of strategy. In Asia  Minor, where she led the van during the march, she chose her route  according to the beauty of the landscape rather than safety of position,  and more than once brought the army into grave danger. She varied the  monotony of the advance by several romantic love episodes, notably with  a young emir in the train of the Sultan Noureddin. She conducted her  career in much the same style as the light opera heroine of to-day, who  pauses in the midst of the action to sing a song, pursue an amour, or  bask in the favour of all beholders.    [Illustration: ELEANOR OF AQUITAINE]    Chief among her admirers was Bernard de Ventadour, whose verse has  received high praise from the poet Petrarch. Of humble birth, he won the  interest of the viscount of the castle, who gave him a good education.  In those days this training consisted in knowing how to be courteous and  well behaved, and how to compose a song and sing it. Bernard, after  exercising his growing powers on the beauties of spring, the fragrance  of flowers, and the music of the nightingale, turned his attentions to  the charms of the young viscountess, which he sung with such success  that one day the object of his praises, in a fit of rapture, bestowed a  kiss upon him. Enraptured by this, he sang his eulogies with still more  boldness, until he roused the jealousy of the lord of the castle, who  locked up his young spouse, and drove the Troubadour from the district.  He took refuge at the court of Eleanor, for whom he conceived a second  and more passionate adoration, and whom he followed to England. But  Henry was either more indulgent or more indifferent, and no further  quarrels came.    The atmosphere of refinement brought into the rude life of the castle by  the Troubadours is more than offset by the domestic infelicity they  caused. Each of these knight-errants of literature was supposed to  choose a lady-love, and it made no difference if she were already  married. Thus conjugal fidelity was at a very low ebb, while amorous  intrigues were openly encouraged by what amounted to a definite system  of civilization. To settle the many vexed questions arising from this  state of affairs, the Courts of Love were formed, at which noble ladies  decided all disputed points. Most famous of these courts was that of  Queen Eleanor herself, while among the others were those of the ladies  of Gascony, the Viscountess of Narbonne, the Countess of Champagne, and  the Countess of Flanders. Disputes before these courts usually took the  form of the tenson, or contention, already described.    Many are the legendary accounts of the laws upon which these courts  based their decisions. There are fables of knights riding in magic  forests and finding scrolls attached by golden chains to the necks of  fiery dragons, or the feet of fleet birds. These laws, if not applicable  in our present civilization, show in the most interesting fashion how  the subject of love was regarded in the twelfth century. Among them are  found the following startling statements:    \"Marriage cannot be pleaded as an excuse for refusing to love.\"    \"A person who cannot keep a secret can never be a lover.\"    \"No one can really love two people at the same time,\" says one rule; but  another adds, \"Nothing prevents one lady being loved by two gentlemen,  or one gentleman by two ladies.\"    Two years was the required period of mourning for a dead lover. But such  constancy may not have been demanded in the case of the living, for,  according to rule, \"A new love-affair banishes the old one completely.\"    Lovers in those days were expected to show the most definite symptoms of  their malady; for, according to law, \"Every lover is accustomed to grow  pale at the sight of his lady-love;\" \"At the sudden and unexpected  prospect of his lady-love, the heart of the true lover invariably  palpitates;\" and \"A real lover is always the prey of anxiety and  _malaise_.\" Also, \"A person who is the prey of love eats little and  sleeps little.\"    There are many maxims on the best way of keeping true love alive, and  many more on the subject of jealousy. That the love of the Troubadours  was none too permanent is indicated by the statement, \"A moderate  presumption is sufficient to justify one lover in entertaining grave  suspicions of the other.\"    Among the celebrated decisions is one given by the Countess of Champagne  upon the question, \"Can real love exist between married people?\" Basing  her decision on the fact that love implies a free granting of all  favours, while marriage enforces constraint, the fair arbiter decided  for the negative. Another decree, of wider application, was pronounced  by Queen Eleanor. A lover, after entreating his lady's favour in vain,  sent her a number of costly presents, which she accepted with much  delight. Yet even after this tribute to her charms, she remained  obdurate, and would not grant him the slightest encouragement. He  accordingly brought the case before the Court of Love, on the ground  that the lady, by accepting his presents, had inspired him with false  hopes. Eleanor gave the decision wholly in his favour, saying that the  lady must refuse to receive any gifts sent as love-tokens, or must make  compensation for them. The story does not tell whether the lady in  question accepted the suitor or returned the gifts.    The absurdity to which these laws were carried is shown by another  decision of Eleanor's. A gentleman became deeply smitten with a lady who  had given her love to another, but who would have been pleased to return  his devotion if ever deprived of her first lover. Soon after, the  original pair were married. The gentleman, citing the decision that real  love cannot exist between married people, claimed that the lady was now  free to reward his fidelity. The lady declared that she had not lost the  love of her first suitor by marrying him, but Queen Eleanor upheld the  decision cited, and ordered the lady to grant her new lover the favours  he desired.    The Troubadours at times treated subjects far different from the usual  short lyrics or"]]]
