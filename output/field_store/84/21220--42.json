Such was the bravery of these young men, that they succeeded where their  fathers had failed, and after a long struggle took the city of Thebes.  As Polynices was dead, and could not claim the scepter he had so longed  to possess, they put his son Ther-san'der upon the throne.    This young man ruled for a while in peace; but because his sons were  insane, the Thebans thought that the gods still hated the race of  OEdipus: so they drove these princes away, and chose another and less  unlucky family to rule over them instead.    Even the daughters of OEdipus were very unhappy; for Antigone, having  taken the part of her brother Polynices, was put to death, while her  sister Ismene died of grief.    Such was the end of the race of OEdipus,--a king who has been  considered the most unhappy man that ever lived, because, although he  meant to be good, he was forced by fate to commit the most horrible  crimes.          XIII. THE CHILDHOOD OF PARIS.      In those days, Pri'am and Hec'u-ba were King and Queen of Troy (or  Il'i-um),--a beautiful city near the coast of Asia Minor, almost  opposite Athens. They were the parents of a large family of sons and  daughters; and among the sons were Hec'tor and Par'is, young men of  remarkable strength and beauty.    Paris had had a very adventurous life. When he was but a little babe,  his mother dreamed that she saw a flaming brand in the cradle, in the  place where the child lay. This brand seemed to set fire to the cradle  and all the palace; and the queen, awaking with a start, was overjoyed  to find that it was nothing but a dream.    Men in those days believed that dreams were sent by the gods to warn  them of coming events, and so Hecuba was very anxious to know what the  burning brand meant. She told her husband all about it, and they finally  decided to ask an oracle to explain the dream.    A few days later the messenger they had sent to the oracle came home,  and Hecuba shed many tears when he brought word that the child Paris was  destined to bring destruction upon his native city.    To escape this calamity, Priam ordered that Paris should be carried out  of the city, and that he should be left in a forest, where the wild  beasts would eat him up, or where he would be sure to die from hunger  and cold.    Poor little Paris was therefore lifted out of his comfortable cradle,  and left alone in the woods, where he cried so hard that a passing  hunter heard him. This man was so sorry for the poor child, that he  carried him home to his wife, who brought the little stranger up with  her own children.    As he lived with hunters, Paris soon learned their ways; and he became  so active that when he was quite grown up he went to Troy to take part  in the athletic games, which were often held there in honor of the gods.  He was so strong that he easily won all the prizes, although Hector and  the other young princes were also striving for them.    When Paris went up to receive the crown of wild olive leaves which was  the victor's prize, every one noticed his likeness to the royal family;  and his sister Cas-san'dra, who was able to foretell future events, said  that he was the son of Priam and Hecuba, and that he would bring great  misfortunes upon Troy.    The king and queen paid no heed to these words, but gladly welcomed  Paris home, and lavished all kinds of gifts upon him to make up for  their cruelty and long neglect.    Paris was so fond of change and adventure, that he soon grew tired of  court life, and asked Priam for a ship, so that he might sail off to  Greece.    This request was readily granted, and Paris went away. The young prince  sailed from island to island, and came at last to the southern part of  the Peloponnesus, where the descendants of Hercules had founded the city  of Sparta. Here he was warmly welcomed by King Men-e-la'us; but this  king was obliged to leave home shortly after the arrival of Paris, and  he bade Helen, his wife, the most beautiful woman in the world, do all  she could to entertain the noble stranger.    Helen was so kind to Paris that he soon fell in love with her. His  greatest wish was to have her as his wife: so he began to tell her that  Ve'nus, the goddess of love, had promised him that he should marry the  most beautiful woman in the world.    Talking thus day after day, the handsome young Paris finally persuaded  Helen to leave her husband and home. She got on board of his vessel, and  went with him to Troy as his wife. Of course, this wrongdoing could not  bring happiness; and not only were they duly punished, but, as you will  soon see, the crime of Paris brought suffering and death to his friends  as well.    [Illustration: Menelaus.]    When Menelaus came home and found that his guest had run away with his  wife, he was very angry, and vowed that he would not rest until he had  punished Paris and won back the beautiful Helen.    He therefore made ready for war, and sent word to his friends and  relatives to come and help him, telling them to meet him at Au'lis, a  seaport, where they would find swift-sailing vessels to carry them  across the sea to Troy.          XIV. THE MUSTER OF THE TROOPS.      When the neighboring kings and chiefs received Menelaus' message, they  were delighted; for fighting was their only occupation, and they enjoyed  the din of battle more than anything else. They began to collect their  soldiers, polish their arms, and man their vessels. Then, inviting all  who wished to join them, they started out for Aulis, where they formed a  huge army.    Each of the parties was led by its own king or chief. Some of these  chiefs were very brave, and their names are still well known. The  leading ones among them were Nes'tor, the wisest man of his day, to whom  every one came for good advice; and U-lys'ses, the crafty or sly king,  who was so clever that he could easily outwit all men.    There were also A'jax, the strongest man of his time; Thersander, the  new king of Thebes, who came with the Epigoni; and Ag-a-mem'non, King of  Mycenae, Menelaus' brother, who was chosen chief of the whole army.    The Greeks never began any undertaking without consulting the oracles to  find out how it would end. Agamemnon, therefore, consulted one of these  soothsayers, who said that Troy would never be taken unless A-chil'les  fought with the Greeks.    When they heard this answer, the chiefs immediately asked who Achilles  was, and they soon learned all about him. He was a young prince of whom  it had been foretold at the time of his birth that he would be the  greatest warrior of his age, and that he would die young. His mother,  who loved him dearly, shed many tears when she heard these words, and  made up her mind to do all she could to prevent this prophecy from  coming true.    She first carried Achilles, when but a baby, to the river Styx, for it  was said that those who bathed in its waters could never be wounded.    Afraid to let go of her child for fear he might drown, but anxious to  make sure that the waters should touch every part of him, the mother  plunged him into the rushing tide, holding him fast by one heel.    This she held so tight that the waters never even wet it; and it was  only long after, when too late to remedy it, that an oracle told her  that Achilles could be wounded in his heel, which the waters of the Styx  had not touched. As soon as this good mother heard the first news of the  coming war, her heart was troubled; for she knew that Achilles, who was  now a young man, would want to join the army, and she was afraid of  losing him.    To prevent his hearing anything about the war, she persuaded him to  visit the King of Scyros. There, under pretext of a joke, he was induced  to put on girl's clothes, and to pretend that he was a woman.    The Greeks, after hearing the oracle's words, sent messengers for  Achilles; but they could not find him, as he had left home, and no one  would tell them where he had gone. As it was of no use to set out  without him, according to the oracle's answer, which they thoroughly  believed, the army lingered at Aulis in despair.    Ulysses, seeing that they would never start unless Achilles were found,  now offered to go and get him. Disguised as a peddler, with a pack upon  his back, he went first to Achilles' home, where the chattering maids  told him all he wished to know, and thence he went to the Island of  Scyros.    Achilles was so well disguised that Ulysses could not tell him from the  king's daughters and their maids: so he made use of a trick to find him  out. Among the trinkets in his pack, he put a sword of fine workmanship,  and, entering the palace, spread out his wares before the admiring  maidens. They all gathered about him; but, while the real girls went  into raptures over his ornaments, Achilles grasped the sword, drew it  from the scabbard, carefully tested the blade, and swung it with a  strong arm.    Of course, Ulysses then easily saw that he was not a girl, and, slipping  up to him, managed to whisper news of the coming war, and won his  promise to join the army at Aulis in a few days.          XV. THE SACRIFICE OF IPHIGENIA.      True to his promise, Achilles soon came to Aulis with his well-trained  soldiers, the Myr'mi-dons, and with him came his friend Pa-tro'clus. All  were now eager to start, and ready to embark; but unfortunately there  was no favorable wind to fill their sails and waft them over to Asia  Minor.    Day after day they waited, and offered sacrifices to the gods, but all  in vain. At last they again consulted the oracle, who said that the  wind would not blow until Iph-i-ge-ni'a, Agamemnon's daughter, were  offered up in sacrifice to Di-an'a, goddess of the moon and the chase,  whom this king had once offended.    Agamemnon at first said that he would not sacrifice his daughter, but  finally his companions persuaded him to do so. Just as the priest was  about to kill the maiden on the altar,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23499"],[0,"The Hunters' Feast: Conversations Around the Camp Fire (#6)"],[1,"are near, though they be  your jailers.  Lost on the prairie, you are alone; but you are free.  In  the islet, I felt that I was alone; that I was not free: in the islet I  experienced the feelings of the prairie and the prison combined.    \"I lay in a state of stupor--almost unconscious; how long I know not,  but many hours I am certain; I knew this by the sun--it was going down  when I awoke, if I may so term the recovery of my stricken senses.  I  was aroused by a strange circumstance: I was surrounded by dark objects  of hideous shape and hue--reptiles they were.  They had been before my  eyes for some time, but I had not seen them.  I had only a sort of  dreamy consciousness of their presence; but I heard them at length: my  ear was in better tune, and the strange noises they uttered reached my  intellect.  It sounded like the blowing of great bellows, with now and  then a note harsher and louder, like the roaring of a bull.  This  startled me, and I looked up and bent my eyes upon the objects: they  were forms of the _crocodilidae_, the giant lizards--they were  alligators.    \"Huge ones they were, many of them; and many were they in number--a  hundred at least were crawling over the islet, before, behind, and on  all sides around me.  Their long gaunt jaws and channelled snouts  projected forward so as almost to touch my body; and their eyes, usually  leaden, seemed now to glare.    \"Impelled by this new danger, I sprang to my feet, when, recognising the  upright form of man, the reptiles scuttled off, and plunging hurriedly  into the lake; hid their hideous bodies under the water.    \"The incident in some measure revived me.  I saw that I was not alone;  there was company even in the crocodiles.  I gradually became more  myself; and began to reflect with some degree of coolness on the  circumstances that surrounded me.  My eyes wandered over the islet;  every inch of it came under my glance; every object upon it was  scrutinised--the moulted feathers of wildfowl, the pieces of mud, the  fresh-water mussels (_unios_) strewed upon its beach--all were examined.  Still the barren answer--no means of escape.    \"The islet was but the head of a sand-bar, formed by the eddy, perhaps  gathered together within the year.  It was bare of herbage, with the  exception of a few tufts of grass.  There was neither tree nor bush upon  it: not a stick.  A raft indeed!  There was not wood enough to make a  raft that would have floated a frog.  The idea of a raft was but briefly  entertained; such a thought had certainly crossed my mind, but a single  glance round the islet dispelled it before it had taken shape.    \"I paced my prison from end to end; from side to side I walked it over.  I tried the water's depth; on all sides I sounded it, wading recklessly  in; everywhere it deepened rapidly as I advanced.  Three lengths of  myself from the islet's edge, and I was up to the neck.  The huge  reptiles swam around, snorting and blowing; they were bolder in this  element.  I could not have waded safely ashore, even had the water been  shallow.  To swim it--no--even though I swam like a duck, they would  have closed upon and quartered me before I could have made a dozen  strokes.  Horrified by their demonstrations, I hurried back upon dry  ground, and paced the islet with dripping garments.    \"I continued walking until night, which gathered around me dark and  dismal.  With night came new voices--the hideous voices of the nocturnal  swamp; the qua-qua of the night-heron, the screech of the swamp-owl, the  cry of the bittern, the cl-l-uk of the great water-toad, the tinkling of  the bell-frog, and the chirp of the savanna-cricket--all fell upon my  ear.  Sounds still harsher and more, hideous were heard around me--the  plashing of the alligator, and the roaring of his voice; these reminded  me that I must not go to sleep.  To sleep!  I durst not have slept for a  single instant.  Even when I lay for a few minutes motionless, the dark  reptiles came crawling round me--so close that I could have put forth my  hand and touched them.    \"At intervals, I sprang to my feet, shouted, swept my gun around, and  chased them back to the water, into which they betook themselves with a  sullen plunge, but with little semblance of fear.  At each fresh  demonstration on my part they showed less alarm, until I could no longer  drive them either with shouts or threatening gestures.  They only  retreated a few feet, forming an irregular circle round me.    \"Thus hemmed in, I became frightened in turn.  I loaded my gun and  fired; I killed none.  They are impervious to a bullet, except in the  eye, or under the forearm.  It was too dark to aim at these parts; and  my shots glanced harmlessly from the pyramidal scales of their bodies.  The loud report, however, and the blaze frightened them, and they fled,  to return again after a long interval.  I was asleep when they returned;  I had gone to sleep in spite of my efforts to keep awake.  I was  startled by the touch of something cold; and half-stilled by the strong  musky odour that filled the air.  I threw out my arms; my fingers rested  upon an object slippery and clammy: it was one of these monsters--one of  gigantic size.  He had crawled close alongside me, and was preparing to  make his attack; as I saw that he was bent in the form of a bow, and I  knew that these creatures assume that attitude when about to strike  their victim.  I was just in time to spring aside, and avoid the stroke  of his powerful tail, that the next moment swept the ground where I had  lain.  Again I fired, and he with the rest once more retreated to the  lake.    \"All thoughts of going to sleep were at an end.  Not that I felt  wakeful; on the contrary, wearied with my day's exertion--for I had had  a long pull under a hot tropical sun--I could have lain down upon the  earth, in the mud, anywhere, and slept in an instant.  Nothing but the  dread certainty of my peril kept me awake.  Once again before morning, I  was compelled to battle with the hideous reptiles, and chase them away  with a shot from my gun.    \"Morning came at length, but with it no change in my perilous position.  The light only showed me my island prison, but revealed no way of escape  from it.  Indeed, the change could not be called for the better, for the  fervid rays of an almost vertical sun poured down upon me until my skin  blistered.  I was already speckled by the bites of a thousand  swamp-flies and mosquitoes, that all night long had preyed upon me.  There was not a cloud in the heavens to shade me; and the sunbeams smote  the surface of the dead bayou with a double intensity.    \"Towards evening, I began to hunger; no wonder at that: I had not eaten  since leaving the village settlement.  To assuage thirst, I drank the  water of the lake, turbid and slimy as it was.  I drank it in large  quantities, for it was hot, and only moistened my palate without  quenching the craving of my appetite.  Of water there was enough; I had  more to fear from want of food.    \"What could I eat?  The ibis.  But how to cook it?  There was nothing  wherewith to make a fire--not a stick.  No matter for that.  Cooking is  a modern invention, a luxury for pampered palates.  I divested the ibis  of its brilliant plumage, and ate it raw.  I spoiled my specimen, but at  the time there was little thought of that: there was not much of the  naturalist left in me.  I anathematised the hour I had ever promised to  procure the bird.  I wished my friend up to his neck in a swamp.    \"The ibis did not weigh above three pounds, bones and all.  It served me  for a second meal, a breakfast; but at this _dejeuner sans fourchette_ I  picked the bones.    \"What next? starve?  No--not yet.  In the battles I had had with the  alligators during the second night, one of them had received a shot that  proved mortal.  The hideous carcass of the reptile lay dead upon the  beach.  I need not starve; I could eat that.  Such were my reflections.  I must hunger, though, before I could bring myself to touch the musky  morsel.    \"Two more days' fasting conquered my squeamishness.  I drew out my  knife, cut a steak from the alligator's tail, and ate it--not the one I  had first killed, but a second; the other was now putrid, rapidly  decomposing under the hot sun: its odour filled the islet.    \"The stench had grown intolerable.  There was not a breath of air  stirring, otherwise I might have shunned it by keeping to windward.  The  whole atmosphere of the islet, as well as a large circle around it, was  impregnated with the fearful effluvium.  I could bear it no longer.  With the aid of my gun, I pushed the half-decomposed carcass into the  lake; perhaps the current might carry it away.  It did: I had the  gratification to see it float off.    \"This circumstance led me into a train of reflections.  Why did the body  of the alligator float?  It was swollen--inflated with gases.  Ha!    \"An idea shot suddenly through my mind--one of those brilliant ideas,  the children of necessity.  I thought of the floating alligator, of its  intestines--what if I inflated them?  Yes, yes! buoys and bladders,  floats and life-preservers! that was the thought.  I would open the  alligators, make a buoy of their intestines, and that would bear me from  the islet!    \"I did not lose a moment's time; I was full of energy: hope had given me  new life.  My gun was loaded--a huge crocodile that swam near the shore  received the shot in his eye.  I dragged him on the beach; with my knife  I laid open his entrails.  Few they were, but enough for my purpose.  A  plume-quill from the wing of the ibis served me for a blow-pipe.  I saw  the bladder-like skin expand, until I was surrounded by objects like  great sausages.  Those were tied together, and fastened to my body, and  then, with a plunge, I entered the waters of the lake, and floated  downward.  I had tied on my life-preservers in such a way that I sat "]]]
