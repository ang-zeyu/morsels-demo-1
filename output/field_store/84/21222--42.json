'Swim fish, sing bird,      And sigh again,        I that am lost am lone,      Bee in the blossom never stirred        Locks hid beneath a stone!'--        Her eye was of the azure fire        That hovers in wintry flame;      Her raiment wild and yellow as furze        That spouteth out the same;        And in her hand she bore no flower,        But on her head a wreath      Of faded flag-flowers that did yet        Smell sweetly after death.        Clear was the light of loveliness        That lit her face like rain;      And sad the mouth that uttered        Her immemorial strain.            *     *     *     *        Gloomy with night the corridor        Is now that she is gone,      Albeit this solitary child        No longer seems alone.        Fast though her taper dwindles down,        Heavy and thick the tome,      A beauty beyond fear to dim        Haunts now her alien home.        Ghosts in the world malignant, grim,        Vex many a wood, and glen,      And house, and pool,--the unquiet ghosts        Of dead and restless men.        But in her grannie's house this spirit--        A child as lone as she--      Pining for love not found on earth,        Ann dreams again to see.        Seated upon her tapestry-stool,        Her fairy-book laid by,      She gazes in the fire, knowing        She hath sweet company.              THE MILLER AND HIS SON          A twangling harp for Mary,        A silvery flute for John,      And now we'll play the livelong day,        'The Miller and his Son.'        'The Miller went a-walking        All in the forest high,      He sees three doves a-flitting        Against the dark blue sky:        'Says he, \"My son, now follow        These doves so white and free,      That cry above the forest,        And surely cry to thee.\"        \"I go, my dearest Father,        But O! I sadly fear,      These doves so white will lead me far,        But never bring me near.\"        'He kisses the Miller,        He cries, \"Awhoop to ye!\"      And straightway through the forest        Follows the wood-doves three.        'There came a sound of weeping        To the Miller in his Mill;      Red roses in a thicket        Bloomed over near his wheel;        'Three stars shone wild and brightly        Above the forest dim:      But never his dearest son        Returns again to him.        'The cuckoo shall call \"Cuckoo!\"        In vain along the vale,      The linnet, and the blackbird,        The mournful nightingale;        'The Miller hears and sees not,        A-thinking of his son;      His toppling wheel is silent;        His grinding done.        '\"Ye doves so white,\" he weepeth,        \"Ye roses on the tree,      Ye stars that shine so brightly,        Ye shine in vain for me!\"        'I bade him follow, follow,        He said, \"O Father dear,      These doves so white will lead me far        But never bring me near!\"'        A twangling harp for Mary,        A silvery flute for John,      And now we'll play the livelong day,        'The Miller and his Son.'              DOWN-ADOWN-DERRY          Down-adown-derry,      Sweet Annie Maroon,      Gathering daisies      In the meadows of Doone,      Sees a white fairy      Skip buxom and free      Where the waters go brawling      In rills to the sea;          Singing down-adown-derry.        Down-adown-derry,      Sweet Annie Maroon      Through the green grasses      Runs fleetly and soon,      And lo! on a lily      She sees one recline      Whose eyes in her wee face      Like the water-sparks shine;          Singing down-adown-derry.        Down-adown-derry,      And shrill was her tune:--      'Come to my water-house,      Annie Maroon,      Come in your pink gown,      Your curls on your head,      To wear the white samite      And rubies instead';          Singing down-adown-derry.        'Down-adown-derry,      Lean fish of the sea,      Bring lanthorns for feasting      The gay Faerie;      And it's dancing on sand 'tis      That's smoother than wool;--      Foam-fruit and wild honey      To pleasure you full';          Singing down-adown-derry.        Down-adown-derry,      Sweet Annie Maroon      Looked large on the fairy      Curled wan as the moon;      And all the grey ripples      To the Mill racing by,      With harps and with timbrels      Did ringing reply;          Singing down-adown-derry.        'Down-adown-derry,'      Sang the Fairy of Doone,      Piercing the heart of      Sweet Annie Maroon;      And lo! when like roses      The clouds of the sun      Faded at dusk, gone      Was Annie Maroon;          Singing down-adown-derry.        Down-adown-derry,      The daisies are few;      Frost twinkles powd'ry      In haunts of the dew;      Only the robin      Perched on a white thorn,      Can comfort the heart of      A father forlorn;          Singing down-adown-derry.        Down-adown-derry,      There's snow in the air;      Ice where the lily      Bloomed waxen and fair;      He may call o'er the water,      Cry--cry through the Mill,      But Annie Maroon, alas!      Answer ne'er will;          Singing down-adown-derry.              THE SUPPER          A wolf he pricks with eyes of fire      Across the night's o'ercrusted snows,          Seeking his prey,          He pads his way      Where Jane benighted goes,        Where Jane benighted goes.        He curdles the bleak air with ire,      Ruffling his hoary raiment through,          And lo! he sees          Beneath the trees      Where Jane's light footsteps go,        Where Jane's light footsteps go.        No hound peals thus in wicked joy,      He snaps his muzzle in the snows,          His five-clawed feet          Do scamper fleet      Where Jane's bright lanthorn shows,        Where Jane's bright lanthorn shows.        Now his greed's green doth gaze unseen      On a pure face of wilding rose,          Her amber eyes          In fear's surprise      Watch largely as she goes,        Watch largely as she goes.        Salt wells his hunger in his jaws,      His lust it revels to and fro,          Yet small beneath          A soft voice saith,      'Jane shall in safety go,        Jane shall in safety go.'        He lurched as if a fiery lash      Had scourged his hide, and through and through,          His furious eyes          O'erscanned the skies,      But nearer dared not go,        But nearer dared not go.        He reared like wild Bucephalus,      His fangs like spears in him uprose,          Ev'n to the town          Jane's flitting gown      He grins on as she goes,        He grins on as she goes.        In fierce lament he howls amain,      He scampers, marvelling in his throes          What brought him there          To sup on air,      While Jane unarmed goes,        While Jane unarmed goes.              THE ISLE OF LONE          Three dwarfs there were which lived on an isle,        And the name of the isle was Lone,      And the names of the dwarfs were Alliolyle,        Lallerie, Muziomone.        Alliolyle was green of een,        Lallerie light of locks,      Muziomone was mild of mien,        As ewes in April flocks.        Their house was small and sweet of the sea,        And pale as the Malmsey wine;      Their bowls were three, and their beds were three,        And their nightcaps white were nine.        Their beds were of the holly-wood,        Their combs of the tortoiseshell,      Their mirrors clear as wintry flood,        Frozen dark and snell.        So each would lie on his plumpy pillow,        The moon for company,      And hear the parrot scream to the billow,        And the billow roar reply.--        Sulphur parrots, and parrots red,        Scarlet, and flame, and green;      And five-foot apes that jargoned        In feathery-tufted treen.        And oh, or ever the dawning shed        On dreams a narrow flame,      Three gaping dwarfs gat out of bed        And gazed upon the same.        At dawn they fished, at noon they snared        Young foxes in the dells,      At even on dew-berries they fared,        And blew in their twisted shells.        Dark was the sea they gambolled in,        And thick with silver fish,      Dark as green glass blown clear and thin        To be a monarch's dish.        They sate to sup in a jasmine bower,        Lit pale with flies of fire,      Their bowls the hue of the iris-flower,        And lemon their attire.        Sweet wine in little cups they sipped,        And golden honeycomb      Into their bowls of cream they dipped,        Whipt light and white as foam.        Alliolyle, where the salt sea flows,        Taught three old apes to sing,      And there to the moon, like a full-blown rose,        They capered in a ring.        But down to the shore skipped Lallerie,        His parrot on his thumb,      And the twain they scritched in mockery,        While the dancers go and come.        So, alas! in the evening, rosy and still,        Light-haired Lallerie      Bitterly quarrelled with Alliolyle        By the yellow-sanded sea.        The rising moon swam sweet and large        Before their furious eyes,      And they rolled and rolled to the coral marge        Where the surf for ever cries.        Too late, too late, comes Muziomone:        Clear in the clear green sea      Alliolyle lies not alone,        But clasped with Lallerie.        He blows on his shell plaintive notes;        Ape, parraquito, bee      Flock where a shoe on the salt wave floats,--        The shoe of Lallerie.        He fetches nightcaps, one and nine,        Grey apes he dowers three,      His house as fair as the Malmsey wine        Seems sad as cypress-tree.        Three bowls he brims with honeycomb        To feast the bumble bees,      Saying, 'O bees, be this your home,        For grief is on the seas!'        He sate him lone in a coral grot,        At the flowing of the tide;      When ebbed the billow, there was not,        Save coral, aught beside."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23580"],[0,"The Children's Bible (#6)"],[1," answered, \"Here am I.\" And he  said, \"Do not put your hand upon the boy, nor do anything to him, for  now I know that you love God, for you have not refused to give your son,  your only son, to him.\"    Then Abraham looked up, and he saw a ram caught in the thicket by his  horns. So Abraham took the ram and offered him up as a burnt-offering  instead of his son. And he named the place Jehovah-jireh, which means,  \"Jehovah will Provide.\"    The angel of Jehovah again called to Abraham and said, \"Jehovah  declares, 'Because you have done this thing and have not kept back your  son, your only son, I will surely bless you, and I will make your  children as many as the stars of the heavens and as the sand, which is  on the seashore, so that they shall conquer their enemies, and all the  nations of the earth shall ask for themselves a blessing like theirs,  because you have obeyed my command.'\"      HOW REBEKAH BECAME THE WIFE OF ISAAC    When Abraham was very old and Jehovah had blessed him in every way,  Abraham said to the eldest of his household servants, who had charge of  all his affairs, \"Put your hand under my hip, while I make you promise  by Jehovah, the God of heaven and earth, that you will not let my son  marry one of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live, but  that you will go to my own country and to my relatives and there get a  wife for my son Isaac.\" The servant said to him, \"Perhaps the woman will  not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I then take your son back  to the land from which you came?\" Abraham said to him, \"See to it that  you do not take my son back there. Jehovah, the God of heaven, who took  me from my father's house and from my native land and who solemnly  promised me, 'To your children I will give this land,' will send his  angel before you and there you will get a wife for my son. But if the  woman is not willing to come with you, then you will be free from this  promise to me; only never take my son back there.\" So the servant put  his hand under Abraham's hip and made the promise.    Then the servant took ten of his master's camels and set out with  precious gifts from his master. So he went to the town of Nahor. And he  made the camels kneel down outside the town by the well in the evening,  at the time when women go out to draw water. Then he said, \"O Jehovah,  the God of my master Abraham, give me, I pray thee, success to-day, and  show kindness to my master Abraham. Here I am standing by the spring of  water, and the daughters of the men of the town are coming out to draw  water. May that young woman to whom I shall say, 'Please let down your  water-jar that I may drink'; and who answers, 'Drink and I will also  water your camels,' may she be the one thou hast chosen for thy servant  Isaac. By this I shall know that thou hast shown kindness to my master.\"    Then even before he was through speaking, Rebekah, who was the  grand-daughter of Nahor, Abraham's brother, came out with her water-jar  upon her shoulder. She was very beautiful and unmarried. She went down  to the spring, filled her jar, and came up. Then the servant ran to meet  her and said, \"Please let me drink a little water from your jar.\" She  answered, \"Drink, sir,\" and quickly let down her water-jar from her  shoulder upon her hand and gave him a drink.    [Illustration: _The Testing of Abraham_ Painted by Fritz von Uhde]    When she had finished giving him a drink she said, \"I will draw water  for your camels also, until they have finished drinking.\" So she quickly  emptied her jar into the trough and ran again to the well to draw water,  and drew for all his camels. Meanwhile the man was silently gazing at  her in order to find out whether Jehovah had made his journey successful  or not.    As soon as the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold ring,  five ounces in weight, and put it in her nose, and put on her arms two  golden bracelets weighing five ounces, and said, \"Whose daughter are  you? Tell me, I beg of you. Is there room in your father's house for us  to spend the night?\" She answered, \"I am the grand-daughter of Milcah  and Nahor. We have plenty of straw and feed, and there is a place for  you to spend the night.\"    Then the man bowed his head and worshipped Jehovah, saying, \"Blessed be  Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who has continued to show his  mercy and his faithfulness toward my master. As for me, Jehovah has led  me on the way to the house of my master's relatives.\"    Then the young woman ran and told these things to her mother's family.  Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban; and Laban ran out to the man at  the spring. And when he saw the bracelets on his sister's hands and the  ring, and when he heard Rebekah say, \"This is what the man said to me,\"  he went to the man, who was still standing by the camels at the spring,  and said, \"Come in, you who are blessed by Jehovah! Why do you stand  outside? For I have cleared the house and have room for the camels.\" So  he brought the man into the house and took the packs off the camels and  furnished straw and feed for them, and water to wash his feet and the  feet of the men who were with him.    But when food was set before him to eat, he said, \"I will not eat until  I have made known my errand.\" They answered, \"Speak.\" He said, \"I am  Abraham's servant; and Jehovah has blessed my master greatly, so that he  has become very rich. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and  gold, servants, and camels and asses. Now Sarah, my master's wife, had a  son when she was old, and my master has given him all that he has. My  master also made me promise, saying, 'Do not let my son marry one of the  daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live, but go to my father's  home and to my relatives and there find a wife for my son.'    \"When I said to my master, 'What if the woman will not follow me?' he  said to me, 'Jehovah, whom I love and serve, will send his angel with  you and make you successful, and you will find for my son a wife from  among my relatives and my father's family. Then you shall be free from  your promise to me. But if you go to my family and they do not give her  to you, you shall also be free from your promise to me.' So I came  to-day to the spring and said, 'O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham,  see, I am standing by the spring of water, if thou wilt make the errand  on which I am going successful, then let the young woman who comes to  draw, to whom I say, Please give me a little water from your jar to  drink, and who shall say to me, Drink, and I will also draw for your  camels, let that one be the woman whom Jehovah has chosen for my  master's son.'    \"Even before I was through speaking, Rebekah came out with her water-jar  on her shoulder and went down to the spring and drew water. And when I  said to her, 'Please let me drink,' she quickly let down her water-jar  from her shoulder and answered, 'Drink, and I will also water your  camels.' So I drank, and she also watered the camels. Then I asked her,  'Whose daughter are you?' And she said, 'The grand-daughter of Nahor and  Milcah.' So I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms.  And I bowed my head and worshipped and blessed Jehovah the God of my  master Abraham who had led me on the right way to find the daughter of  my master's brother for his son. Tell me whether or not you will deal  kindly and truly with my master, so that I shall know what to do!\"    Then Laban and his family answered, \"The matter is in the hands of  Jehovah. We cannot say either 'yes' or 'no.' See, Rebekah is before you;  take her and go and let her be the wife of your master's son, as Jehovah  has said.\"    When Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed to the ground before  Jehovah. Then he brought out gold and silver ornaments and clothing and  gave them to Rebekah. He also gave costly gifts to her brother and to  her mother. And he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent  the night there.    When they rose in the morning, the servant said, \"Send me away to my  master.\" But Rebekah's brother and mother answered, \"Let the young woman  stay with us a month or at least ten days; after that she may go.\" But  he said to them, \"Do not delay me, for Jehovah has given me success.  Send me away that I may go to my master.\"    [Illustration: (C) _Curtis Publishing Company_    _Rebekah Comes to Isaac_ Painted by W. L. Taylor]    Then they said, \"We will call the young woman and ask her.\" So they  called Rebekah and said to her, \"Will you go with this man?\" She  answered, \"I will go.\" So they sent away their sister Rebekah and her  nurse with Abraham's servant and his men.    They also blessed Rebekah, saying to her, \"Our sister! may your children  and their children become thousands and thousands!\" Then Rebekah set out  with her maids and, riding upon the camels, they followed the man. So  the servant took Rebekah and went away.    Now Abraham had given all that he had to Isaac and had breathed his  last, dying in a good old age, satisfied with living. In the evening,  when Isaac had gone out in the field to meditate, he looked up and saw  camels coming. Rebekah too looked up, and when she saw Isaac, she  quickly alighted from the camel and said to the servant, \"Who is this  man walking in the field to meet us?\" When the servant said, \"It is my  master,\" she took her veil and covered her face. Then the servant told  Isaac all that he had done. And Isaac brought Rebekah to the tent of  Sarah his mother, and she became his wife; and he loved her.      HOW JACOB DECEIVED HIS FATHER    Now Isaac prayed to Jehovah for his wife, because she had no children;  and Jehovah heard his prayer, and Rebekah became the mother of twin  boys. They named one Esau and the other Jacob.    As they grew up, Esau became a skilful hunter, a man who lived out in  the fields; but Jacob was a quiet man who stayed about the tents. Isaac  loved Esau, for "]]]
