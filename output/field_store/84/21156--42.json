In the first affidavit it was deposed that Mr. Gourlay  had been domiciliated at Queenston for more than nine months, and that  the deponent verily believed him to be a natural-born subject of Great  Britain. By the second it appeared that deponent had known Mr. Gourlay  in Britain, where he was respected, esteemed, and taken to be a British  subject; \"and that he is so\"--thus ran the affidavit--\"this deponent  verily believes is notoriously true in this district.\" The prisoner's  own affidavit set forth that he was a British subject; that he had taken  the oath of allegiance, and that he had been an inhabitant of Upper  Canada for more than a year prior to the date of the warrant first  issued against him. There could hardly have been a clearer case. But the  prisoner's enlargement at this time would have been a triumph for him,  and would have made him a popular idol, which would not have comported  with the policy of the Unholy Inquisition at the capital. He was  remanded to jail, the Chief Justice indorsing judgment on the writ to  the effect that the warrant of commitment appeared to be regular, and  that the Act under which it was issued made no provision for bail or  main-prize.    When Mr. Gourlay was first placed in durance at Niagara he was possessed  of robust health, a vigorous frame, a seemingly unconquerable will, and  a perfervid enthusiasm for the cause of truth and justice. But his  sufferings during the ensuing six months were of a nature well  calculated to sap the health of the most robust, to rack the frame of an  athlete, to tame the wildest enthusiasm, and to subjugate the strongest  will. When we read of what the gentle and erudite John Fisher or the  eloquent and upright Sir John Eliot underwent in the Tower for  conscience sake, the heart's blood within us is stirred with righteous  indignation. But we are calmed by the reflection that these things took  place centuries ago, and in a far-distant country. In the case of Robert  Gourlay we can lay no such flattering unction to our souls. His slow  crucifixion was accomplished in our own land, and at a time well  remembered by many persons now living among us. Some idea of what he  passed through may be derived from his own words already quoted. Further  light on the subject may be obtained from noting his demeanour when  placed on trial, as the reader will presently have an opportunity of  doing.    For some months after his incarceration his fine state of health and  exuberant animal spirits kept him from utterly breaking down. His whole  nature was up in arms at the wrongs he had sustained, and his pugnacity  asserted itself as far as his circumstances would admit of. He obtained  the opinions of eminent English lawyers as to the legal aspect of his  case. The unanimous opinion of counsel was that his imprisonment was  wholly unjustifiable. Sir Arthur Piggott was clear that Chief Justice  Powell should have discharged the prisoner when brought before him under  the writ of _habeas corpus_, and that Dickson and Claus were liable to  actions for false imprisonment. This opinion was acted upon, and  proceedings were instituted against the two last-named personages. But  the contest was too unequal. Each of the defendants obtained an order  for security for costs, which security the plaintiff, being in  confinement, and subject to various disabilities, was unable to furnish.  The actions accordingly lapsed, and Dickson and Claus thus escaped all  civil liability for their most reprehensible deeds.    The thread of the narrative may now be resumed pretty nearly where it  was dropped a few pages back. It was, as has been said, the 20th of  August--nearly a year subsequent to the Kingston trial[12]--when the  prisoner was finally placed in the dock to undergo the semblance,  without the reality, of a judicial investigation into his conduct. He  was himself firmly persuaded that the jury empanelled in his case was a  packed one. We have no means of knowing all the circumstances whereby he  was led to this conclusion, but the idea is not in itself inherently  improbable. In those days, and for long after, no man tried in Upper  Canada for anything savouring of radicalism in politics could hope to  receive fair play. In Gourlay's case there were one or two suspicious  features which, to say the least, require explanation. The custom  ordinarily adopted by the sheriff, in selecting jurymen, was to draw  them in rotation from the various townships in the district. \"In my  case,\" says Mr. Gourlay, \"it was said that he had varied his course; and  not this only, but, instead of drawing from a square space of country,  he chose a line of nearly twenty miles, along which it was well known  that there were the greatest number of people prejudiced and influenced  against me.\"[13] Mr. Gourlay further declares that it was observed by  people in court that in the glass containing the folded transcripts from  the jury-list some of the folded papers were distinctly set apart, so as  to admit of their being drawn, apparently with fairness, in the ordinary  manner. These papers so set apart from the rest, as Mr. Gourlay informs  his readers, were \"caught hold of\" as the twelve which should decide his  fate. The names of the jurors, which, so far as I am aware, have not  hitherto appeared in print, are worthy of preservation. They were  William Pew, John Grier, William Servos, James B. Jones, Ralfe M. Long,  David Bastedo, John C. Ball, John Milton, James Lundy, William Powers,  Peter M. Ball and John Holmes.    The personal appearance of the prisoner had undergone a woful change  during his confinement. Had his own wife seen him at that moment it is  doubtful whether she would have recognized her lord. Could it be  possible that that frail, tottering, wasted form, and that blanched,  sunken-eyed, imbecile-looking countenance were all that were left of the  once formidable Robert Gourlay? The sight was one which might have moved  his bitterest enemy to tears. His clothing, a world too wide for so  shrunken a tenant, hung sloppy and slovenly about him, and it was  remarked by a spectator that he had aged fully ten years during the six  months that had elapsed since his journey to York in the previous  February. His limbs seemed too weak to support him where he stood, and  as he leaned with his hands upon the rail in front of him his fingers  twitched nervously, while his whole frame visibly trembled. The saddest  change of all had been wrought in his once fine eyes. They were of light  grey, and their ordinary expression had been more sharp and piercing  than is commonly found in eyes of that colour. They had been clear and  keen, and expressive of an active, vigorous brain behind them. At  present they were wandering, weak and watery, altogether lacking in  lustre or expression. They told their sad tale with piteous brevity. The  brain was active and vigorous no longer, or, if still active, was so to  no definite purpose. The spark of reason was for the time quenched  within him. His oratory and his writings were no longer to be dreaded.  The man whose large presence had once carried about with it unmistakable  evidences of physical and mental power had been reduced to a physical  and mental wreck. No man in that closely-packed court-room was now more  harmless than he. The Compact had indeed set an indelible mark upon  him--a mark which he was to carry to his grave, for during the  forty-four years of life that remained to him he was never again the  Robert Gourlay of old, and was subject to periodical seasons of mental  aberration.    And yet, as he stood there trembling and distraught, with that sea of  faces turned upon him, he was not altogether without some glimmering of  reason. He was at least passively conscious, like one in a troubled  dream, of what was going on around him. He realized, in a misty, dazed  sort of fashion that he was on his trial; but, cudgel his memory how he  would, he could not recall the nature of his alleged offence. The fact  is that, though no stimulant had passed his lips, he was in a state that  can only be characterized as one of intoxication. We know, on undoubted  authority, that very emotional persons are sometimes intoxicated by a  plate of soup, and that invalids have become tipsy upon eating their  first beefsteak after convalescence. Mr. Gourlay was endowed with an  enthusiastic, exuberant nature, which required to be kept in subjection  by abundant exercise. Up to the time of his imprisonment he had led an  active out-of-door life, whereby the demon of nervousness within him had  been kept at bay. But long-continued confinement in a close cell,  deprivation of fresh air and suitable exercise, had hindered his  exuberance from finding vent. His mind had been thrown back upon  itself. He had not been permitted to confer with his friends, except  under such restrictions as made converse intolerable. He had been kept  in such a state of nervous tension that he had had no appetite, and had  eaten scarcely any food. His sleep had been broken by mental discomfort,  and he had sometimes lain the whole night through without a minute's  unconsciousness. What wonder that his flesh had sunk away from his  bones, and that his frame had lost its elasticity! For some hours every  day he had lain prostrate on the bed in his cell, in a state of  feebleness pitiful to behold, unable to speak or move, and hardly able  to breathe. \"One morning,\" he writes, \"while gasping for breath, I  besought the gaoler to let me have more air, by throwing up the window.  'You are no gentleman,' said he; 'you gave that letter[14] out of the  window, and I will come presently to nail it down.' Happily a friend  soon after called upon me, and through his interference the window was  put up.

Now the       Widows' Fund, you know, when one has a widow, will be a very good       sort of thing--L80 per annum, I believe.

Tell Mr Alcock I am afraid I will never be able       to repay him his kindness in procuring me this sum upon my very       cavalier notice. With regard to yourself, you know, I suppose, we       have a pretty long account together, and the balance somewhat       against me, as it will always remain.         \"I suppose you will have received my hurried note of last night. I       thought you had entirely forgot my L20 amid the other weighty       matters you had to settle for me.

I am doing my best, and       if I do not use my utmost endeavour, after what has been done for       me by others, I will allow you to call me anything you please.         \"Still I beg you will not make yourself too sanguine of my success.

Do not be afraid that I will confuse or disturb myself much       about it. You know I have been accustomed to such things, as eels       are to be skinned.         \"While writing, I have been interrupted by a porter who has come       seething in with a large box.

I do not consider it at all necessary to write by post, as       this goes by a most careful hand; but should I not hear next week       of your having received it, then I _shall_ write by post. Perhaps I       may enclose a receipt to Mr Alcock. He 'hinted,' it seems, 'the       danger of placing so much money,' &c. I have not time to let my       imagination run loose just now, or else I might have pictured to       myself the thousand things which might be done with such a       treasure; but I assure you I never should have thought of anything       (as things now stand) but the intended destination of it, and of       _that_ I shall have enough to think.

It is just about a quarter of an hour since I       was examined, the time being deferred from yesterday to to-day. The       questions were very easy, at least I thought them so, and I think I       answered each. If there were any I did not answer, it was from       abstracting my attention from the more trifling to the more       difficult branches of the law. So far of my examinations are over;       but you must hold in mind that if I do not pass my SCOTS Law trial       in a year, the L50 must still be paid. One thing I have lost by       preparation, the chance of gaining the prize in the Civil Law       class. This is given by the greatest number of correct answers to       one hundred questions. Ten of these have already been answered. _I_       only accomplished _seven_ of them, and consider I have forfeited my       chance. Seven is a good proportion out of ten difficult questions;       but as the person who gains the prize is seldom deficient by above       two or three, I do not conceive I have a chance. You may now tell       whom you please that I have passed, but need not be publishing it       to all the world. Had I _not_ passed, I should have been called a       rash foolish fellow for attempting it; but as it is, it will be       said I have done quite right.

I go to a party at Mr       Constable's to-night, the only place (excepting Mr Dauney's) I have       been engaged at since I arrived. I have had nothing whatever to       interfere with my studies for this last fortnight. Tell James and       Mary I can now have time to read their letters. On Saturday Mr G.B.       called on me, asking me to attend a prayer-meeting, and finding I       was busy, told me if I saw things in as clear a light as he did, I       would see the vanity of attending to these earthly things. I trust,       without irreligion, one may say he is mistaken. I write from Mr       Constable's, which is near the Post-office. My dinner-hour is long       past, and the post is just going, so I must bid you adieu. Write me       soon, and inform me how you are pleased with the contents of this.

Since writing, I have been relaxing       myself a little, and going about making a few calls, a thing I have       neglected of late; but I beg you will not suppose this to be a hint       that I am to grow idle. I intend, indeed, to be very busy all       winter. I expect to hear from you soon, and to know what is doing       in Aberdeen. I called upon Mrs H. to-night, who told me my       grand-aunt had been very unwell lately. I trust this is a mistake;       but not having heard from your quarter for some days, the fact may       be so, without my having known it.... I just despatched the       oysters, and I would wish that you could send to Mr Dyce, and       inquire whether they have come free of expense, as I left money       with the seller to pay the coach-hire. I have not sent you any, as       they are rather dear--8s. 8d. for a barrel with two hundred. Now, I       presume you might buy the same number in Aberdeen for about quarter       the sum.         \"I live here in a sort of honourable solitude--few acquaintances,       and few annoyances; it is just the sort of life I like.

When I first heard the report       of the matter, I called on the librarian and requested information.       He told me that those who did not pass before 1832, had to pay it.       _I_ then said it was due at passing the Civil Law trials, and so,       &c.; and then the man shrugged his shoulders, and allowed I had       convinced him it was only payable by those who did not pass their       _Civil Law_ trials before 1832, and I said no more about the       matter. Dining, however, with Dauney on Tuesday fortnight last, I       heard an observation which led me to a different conclusion, so I       procured the Act as soon as might be, and saw how the matter lay.         \"Presuming I had a whole month before me, I determined to try the       thing, notwithstanding the shaking of heads of those to whom I was      "]]]
