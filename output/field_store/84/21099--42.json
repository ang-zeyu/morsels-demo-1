That is settled. The consternation here is very great.       Nevertheless I am glad, and always shall be, that the Negroes       are--virtually--free.[10]    It is some years before we find another reference so definite. Miss  Barrett in the meantime became Mrs. Browning and under the inspiration  of love and Italy gave herself anew to her work. The feeling for  liberty was constantly with her, as was to be seen from _Casa Guidi  Windows_ and _Poems before Congress_. About 1855, when she was on a  visit to England, through the work of Daniel D. Home, a notorious  American exponent of spiritualism, Mrs. Browning became interested in  the current fad, and gave to it vastly more serious attention than  most other initiates. Browning himself, while patient, was intolerably  irritated with those whom he regarded as imposing on his wife's  credulity, and delivered himself on the subject in _Mr. Sludge, 'the  Medium_.' Spiritualism, however, was a topic of never-failing interest  between Mrs. Browning and her American friend, Harriet Beecher Stowe,  whom she entertained in Italy. _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ made a profound  impression upon her. In 1853 this book was still in the great flush of  its first success. On April 12, 1853, Mrs. Browning wrote from  Florence to Mrs. Jameson as follows:         Not read Mrs. Stowe's book! _But you must_. Her book is quite a       sign of the times, and has otherwise and intrinsically       considerable power. For myself, I rejoice in the success, both as       a woman and a human being. Oh, and is it possible that you think       a woman has no business with questions like the question of       slavery? Then she had better use a pen no more. She had better       subside into slavery and concubinage herself, I think, as in the       times of old, shut herself up with the Penelopes in the \"women's       apartment,\" and take no rank among thinkers and speakers.       Certainly you are not in earnest in these things. A difficult       question--yes! All virtue is difficult. England found it       difficult. France found it difficult. But we did not make       ourselves an armchair of our sins. As for America, I honor       America in much; but I would not be an American for the world       while she wears that shameful scar upon her brow. The address of       the new president[11] exasperates me. Observe, I am an       abolitionist, not to the fanatical degree, because I hold that       compensation should be given by the North to the South, as in       England. The states should unite in buying off this national       disgrace.[12]    Under date Florence, December 11, 1854, Mrs. Browning wrote to Miss  Mitford as follows:         I am reading now Mrs. Stowe's _Sunny Memories_, and like the       naturalness and simplicity of the book much, in spite of the       provincialism of the tone of mind and education, and the really       wretched writing. It's quite wonderful that a woman who has       written a book to make the world ring should write so       abominably.[13]    More and more as the Civil War approached was Mrs. Browning depressed  by the thought of the impending conflict. Between June 7, 1860, and  July 25, 1861, she contributed to the recently established  _Independent_ eleven poems, chiefly on subjects of Italian liberty.  Sometimes, however, especially in the letters accompanying her poems,  she touched on themes somewhat closer to the American people. For the  issue of March 21, 1861, she wrote to the editor as follows:         My partiality for frenzies is not so absorbing, believe me, as to       exclude very painful consideration on the dissolution of your       great Union. But my serious fear has been, and is, not for the       dissolution of the body but the death of the soul--not of a       rupture of states and civil war, but at reconciliation and peace       at the expense of a deadly compromise of principle. Nothing will       destroy the Republic but what corrupts its conscience and       disturbs its fame--for the stain upon the honor must come off       upon the flag. _If, on the other hand, the North stands fast on       the moral ground, no glory will be like your glory_.... What       surprises me is that the slaves don't rise.    On this great subject Mrs. Browning found her husband in full sympathy  with her. Browning himself declared in a letter to an American,  September 11, 1861:         I have lost the explanation of American affairs, but I assure you       of my belief in the justice and my confidence in the triumph of       the great cause. For the righteousness of the principle I want no       information. God prosper it and its defenders.[14]    Two poems by Mrs. Browning at least have to do directly with the Negro  and American affairs. One was _A Curse for a Nation_ contributed to  the _Poems before Congress_ volume. The poet begins somewhat  self-consciously:        I heard an angel speak last night,              And he said \"Write!      Write a Nation's curse for me,      And send it over the Western Sea.\"    She protests her unwillingness to execute such a commission, for, she  says,        I am bound by gratitude              By love and blood,      To brothers of mine across the sea,      Who stretch out kindly hands to me.    The angel, however, beats down this unwillingness and the curse  follows, the second stanza reading:        Because yourselves are standing straight        In the state      Of Freedom's foremost acolyte,      Yet keep calm footing all the time      On writhing bond-slaves,--for this crime        This is the curse. Write.    At best, however, _A Curse for a Nation_ can hardly help impressing  one as a little forced. In rather higher poetic vein is the other  poem, _The Runaway Slave at Pilgrim's Point_. This was contributed to  _The Liberty Bell_, a publication issued by the Boston Anti-Slavery  Bazar in 1848. Mrs. Browning feared that the poem might be \"too  ferocious for the Americans to publish.\" The composition is  undoubtedly a strong one. It undertakes to give the story of a young  Negro woman who was bound in slavery, whose lover was crushed before  her face, who was forced to submit to personal violation, who killed  her child that so much reminded her of her white master's face, and  who at last at Pilgrim's Point defied her pursuers. With unusual  earnestness the poet has entered sympathetically into the subject. The  following stanzas are typical:        But _we_ who are dark, we are dark       Ah God, we have no stars!      About our souls in care and cark       Our blackness shuts like prison-bars;      The poor souls crouch so far behind      That never a comfort can they find       By reaching through the prison-bars.               *       *       *       *       *        Why, in that single glance I had       Of my child's face, ... I tell you all,      I saw a look that made me mad       The _master's_ look, that used to fall      On my soul like his lash ... or worse      And so, to save it from my curse,       I twisted it round in my shawl.               *       *       *       *       *        From the white man's house, and the black man's hut,       I carried the little body on;      The forest's arm did round us shut,       And silence through the trees did run:      They asked no question as I went,      They stood too high for astonishment,       They could see God sit on his throne.               *       *       *       *       *        (Man, drop that stone you dared to lift!--)       I wish you who stand there five abreast,      Each, for his own wife's joy and gift,       A little corpse as safely at rest      As mine in the mangoes: Yes, but _she_      My keep live babies on her knee,       And sing the song she likes the best.    In such a review as this of the connections between Mrs. Browning and  the Negro one can not help coming face to face with the question  whether her famous husband was not himself connected by blood with the  Negro race. The strain is hardly so pronounced as in men like  Alexandre Dumas or Leigh Hunt, and as in the case of Alexander  Hamilton, the point still seems to be waiting for final proof. The  assertion is persistent, however, and there can be little doubt that  such is the case. The standard life of Browning,[15] after wrestling  in vain with the problem, dismisses it as follows:         Dr. Furnivall has originated a theory, and maintains it as a       conviction, that Mr. Browning's grandmother was more than a       Creole in the strict sense of the term, that of a person born of       white parents in the West Indies, and that an unmistakable dash       of dark blood passed from her to her son and grandson. Such an       occurrence was, on the face of it, not impossible, and would be       absolutely unimportant to my mind, and, I think I may add, to       that of Mr. Browning's sister and son. The poet and his father       were what we know them, and if Negro blood had any part in their       composition, it was no worse for them, and so much the better for       the Negro.    Aside from this last point, from the evidence that has been given,  while this of course has its limitations, we may safely assert that  with her large humanity and her enthusiasm for liberty, Elizabeth  Barrett Browning was one of the sturdiest defenders in England of the  cause of the American Negro at the time of the beginning of the Civil  War. It is to be regretted that she did not live to read the  Emancipation Proclamation and to see the Negro started on an era of  self-relia"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20907"],[0,"The Best of the World's Classics,  Restricted to prose. Volume I (of X) - Greece (#6)"],[1," took  it, but put to death the priests who endeavored to prevent its  removal. Such was the magnificence of this temple, which contained  also many private offerings.    Of this Babylon there were several monarchs--as I shall mention in my  history of the Assyrians--who adorned the city and its temples. Among  these, two young women must be mentioned. The former, named  Semiramis,[8] reigned five generations before the latter. This queen  raised an embankment worthy of admiration through the plain to confine  the river, which heretofore often spread over the level like a lake.  The latter of these two queens, named Nitocris,[9] excelled the  former in intelligence: she left monuments, some of which I must  describe. Seeing the Medes already possest of extensive empire, and  restlessly extending their power, by taking city after city, among  which was Nineveh, she resolved in good time to secure herself against  them in the best manner possible. In the first place, therefore, as  the river Euphrates ran in a straight course through the city, she  formed excavations at a distance above it, by which means its course  became so tortuous that it three times passed a certain town of  Assyria, called Ardericca; travelers from our sea,[10] in descending  the Euphrates toward Babylon, three times arrive at that town in the  course of three days. She also raised both banks of the river to an  amazing height and thickness. At some distance above Babylon, and near  the river, she dug a reservoir in the marsh, of such depth as to drain  it. The width of this excavation was such as to make its circuit four  hundred and twenty stadia. The earth removed from it was taken to  raise the banks of the river; this done, she brought stones, with  which the sides of the lake were lined. Both these works--the  diverting of the river and the reservoir--were formed with the  intention of rendering the current less rapid by its many windings,  which broke its force, and at the same time made the navigation more  circuitous; so that those who descended toward Babylon by water might  have to make a long circuit around the lake. These works were  effective on that side which was exposed to the inroads of the Medes,  and where the distance between her dominions and theirs was the least;  for she wished to cut off all communication with them, and to keep  them in ignorance of her movements.    Thus did this princess raise from the depths a fortification, within  which she was included. The city being divided into two portions by  the river in former times, whoever wished to pass from one to the  other was obliged to take a boat, which manifestly was a great  inconvenience. This defect she supplied. When she had dug the lake in  the marsh, she availed herself of the occasion to construct another  monument also, by which her fame will be perpetuated. She caused  stones of great magnitude to be hewn, and when they were ready, the  lake being empty, she turned the waters of the Euphrates into it;  which, as it filled, left the old channel dry. Then she lined both  sides of the river and the descent from the gates with burnt bricks,  in like manner as the city walls; and with the stones already  mentioned she constructed, as near the middle of the city as possible,  a bridge, binding the stones together with iron and lead. During the  day, planks of wood were extended from pier to pier, so as to form a  pathway; these were withdrawn at night, to prevent the people from  passing over to plunder one another. This bridge was, as we have said,  formed by withdrawing the water of the Euphrates into the artificial  lake; when completed, the river was restored to its ancient channel;  the propriety of this mode of proceeding then become apparent, by  means of which the citizens obtained the accommodation of a bridge.    The same queen also executed the following machination: she  constructed for herself a tomb, aloft upon a gate in one of the most  frequented ways of the city; upon the sepulcher she engraved this  inscription: \"If any one of my successors, the kings of Babylon, shall  lack money, let him open the sepulcher, and take what treasures he  pleases. But let him beware of opening it from any other cause than  necessity; for in such a case it shall not turn to his advantage.\"  This sepulcher remained undisturbed till Darius ascended the throne.  To this king it seemed a grievance both that this gate should remain  useless, and that the wealth deposited in it, and which invited  research, should not be appropriated. The gate was not used, because  no one could pass through it without having a dead body over his head.  He therefore opened the tomb, in which he found--of treasures indeed  nothing, but the corpse, and an inscription to this effect: \"If thou  hadst not been insatiably eager for riches, and greedy of filthy  lucre, thou wouldst not have opened the depository of the dead.\" So  much for this queen and the reports that have been handed down  concerning her.    It was against the son of this woman that Cyrus made war; he was named  (like his father) Labynetus, and reigned over the Assyrians. When the  Great King[11] goes out to battle, he is attended by ample provisions  and cattle drawn from the home stock; and even water from the  Choaspian spring at Susa,[12] of which alone the king drinks, is  carried about for his use; for he can taste no other stream. This  Choaspian water, after having been boiled, is put into vases of  silver, which are transported in four-wheeled wagons drawn by mules,  following him wherever he goes.    Cyrus advancing toward Babylon arrived at the river Gyndes, which,  rising in the Matienian hills and running through the country of the  Dardanians (or Darnians), empties itself into the Tigris; and this  river, passing by the city Opis, discharges its waters into the Red  Sea.[13] When Cyrus attempted to pass this river Gyndes, which could  only be done by boats, one of the white horses called sacred, full of  mettle, plunged into the stream and endeavored to reach the opposite  bank; but, being submerged in the current, it was carried away. Cyrus,  enraged at the river for this injury, threatened to reduce it so low  that in future women should ford it with ease, not wetting their  knees. Having uttered this threat, he delayed the progress of his army  toward Babylon, and, dividing his forces into two bodies, measured out  one hundred and eighty channels to be cut from both banks of the  river, thus diverting the Gyndes on all sides. He enjoined upon his  army the work of digging these trenches, and by their numbers they  completed it; but the whole summer was spent there in the labor.    Cyrus having in this manner punished the river Gyndes, by distributing  its waters into three hundred and sixty trenches, as soon as the next  spring appeared, advanced toward Babylon. The Babylonians, coming out  in battle-array, waited his approach; when he drew nigh to the city  they engaged him, but, being defeated, retired within the walls. Some  time before, well knowing the restless intentions of Cyrus, and seeing  him attack one nation after another, they had brought into the city an  abundance of corn for many years. They therefore disregarded the  siege. But Cyrus, beset with difficulties, saw a long time pass away  without his making any progress toward the accomplishment of his  object.    At length, either at the suggestion of some one else or from a thought  of his own, he resorted to the following means: He disposed the whole  of his army, by placing one part above the city, where the river  enters it, and another part below, where it makes its exit, commanding  them as soon as they should perceive the river to be sufficiently  shallow to enter by that way. This order being given, he himself went  off with the inferior troops of the army. Arriving at the lake, he did  what had been done before by the queen of Babylon in the marsh; for,  by making a trench from the river to the empty reservoir, he diverted  the water from the ancient channel, till it so far subsided as to  become fordable.    As soon as this happened, the Persians who had been appointed for this  purpose entered Babylon by the bed of the river, the water of which  was little more than knee-deep. If the Babylonians had been before  apprized of the intentions of Cyrus, or if they had learned at the  moment what he was doing, they would not have suffered the Persians to  enter the city, nor would the Babylonians have perished so  shamefully; for if they had closed all the gates by the river's side,  and ascended the walls which ran along it, they might have taken the  Persians as in a net. But the Persians came upon their opponents quite  unexpectedly; and from the great extent of the city--as it has been  affirmed by some of the inhabitants--those who dwelt in the outskirts  of the city were made prisoners before the people in the center of  Babylon knew that the place was taken. But, as it happened, they were  celebrating a festival, and were dancing and feasting when they  learned what had happened. Thus was Babylon the first time taken.
