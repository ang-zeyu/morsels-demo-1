Vol. 1 (of 2) (#6)"],[1,"once went to kiss his Majesty's hand at Hampton  Court and convey tidings from Paris, King Charles 'being now in the  power of those execrable villains who not long after murder'd him.'  Thence he betook himself to Sayes Court, near Deptford in Kent, the  estate belonging to his father-in-law, where he 'had a lodging and some  bookes.' It was here that he was living when his first literary work was  published, _Of Liberty and Servitude_, a translation from the French of  Le Vayer, in January, 1649, though the dedication of it to his brother  George bears date 25th January, 1647. He was very near getting into  trouble about the preface to this, because in his own copy he noted that  'I was like to be call'd in question by the Rebells for this booke,  being published a few days before his Majesty's decollation.' Although  he took no prominent part in politics at this particular time, yet he  could hardly help playing with the fire. Thus, on 11th December, 'I got  privately into the council of ye rebell army at Whitehall, where I heard  horrid villanies.' Having money in hand, either from savings during the  four years' sojourn abroad, where his expenses (including all purchases  of objects of art and vertu) did not amount to more than L300 a year, or  else from his child-wife's dowry, he dabbled in land speculation with  the fairly satisfactory result that on the whole he does not appear to  have lost much by it.    On 17th January, 1649, he 'heard the rebell Peters incite the rebell  powers met in the Painted Chamber to destroy his Majesty, and saw that  archtraytor Bradshaw, who not long after condemn'd him.' But his loyalty  kept him from being present at the death-scene. 'The villanie of the  rebells proceeding now so far as to trie, condemne and murder our  excellent King on the 30th of this month, struck me with such horror  that I kept the day of his martyrdom a fast, and would not be present at  that execrable wickednesse, receiving the sad account of it from my  Brother George and Mr. Owen, who came to visite me this afternoone, and  recounted all the circumstances.'    While he 'went through a course of chymestrie at Sayes Court,' and  otherwise engaged in study and in the examination of works of art, he  became disquieted about the condition of affairs in Paris.  Communications with his wife appear to have been very few and far  between, although with his father-in-law he 'kept up a political  correspondence' in cipher 'with no small danger of being discovered.' In  April he touched 'suddaine resolutions' of going to France, before he  received the news that Conde's siege of Paris had ended by peace being  concluded. The immediate carrying out of this intention was hindered by  a rush of blood to the brain. 'I fell dangerously ill of my head: was  blistered and let blood behind ye ears and forehead: on the 23rd. began  to have ease by using the fumes of a cammomile on embers applied to my  eares after all the physicians had don their best.' On 17th June,  however, he 'got a passe from the rebell Bradshaw, then in greate  power,' and on 12th July went via Gravesend to Dover and Calais,  arriving at Paris on 1st. August. Curiously enough his Diary makes no  mention of the child-wife, from whom he had 'been absent.... about a  yeare and a halfe,' save that on 'Sept. 7th. Went with my Wife and dear  cosin to St. Germains, and kissed the Queene-mother's hand.' He remained  in Paris till the end of June, 1650, when he made a flying visit to  England, and again obtained a pass from Bradshaw to proceed to France.  On 30th August, he was back again in Paris, where he stayed till his  final return to England in February 1652. His life in Paris at this time  was that of a cultured _dilletante_. He studied, or at any rate dabbled  in, chemistry, philosophy, theology, and music; and he found amusement  in examining gardens and collections of all sorts of virtuosities and  antiquities. He had 'much discourse of chymical matters' with Sir Kenelm  Digby; 'but the truth is, Sir Kenelm was an arrant mountebank.' Here,  too, he wrote his second literary composition, _The State of France, as  it stood in the IXth yeer of this present monarch Lewis XIIII_, which  was published in England in 1652. Apart from these occupations, his time  was chiefly spent in the pleasures and amusements common to the court  of France and to the throng of exiles from Britain who formed the Court  of the uncrowned monarch, Charles II.    Evelyn longed for settlement in England, because he saw that the  Royalist cause was hopelessly lost for the time being. His  father-in-law's estate of Sayes Court had been seized and sold by the  rebels, but 'by the advice and endeavour of my friends I was advis'd to  reside in it, and compound with the soldiers. This I was besides  authoriz'd by his Majesty to do, and encourag'd with promise that what  was in lease from the Crowne, if ever it pleased God to restore him, he  would secure to us in fee-ferme.{xxxi:1} I had also addresses and cyfers  to correspond with his Majesty and Ministers abroad: upon all which  inducements I was persuaded to settle henceforth in England, having now  run about the world, most part out of my owne country, neere ten yeares.  I therefore now likewise meditated sending over for my Wife, whom as yet  I had left at Paris.' She arrived on 11th. June with her Mother; and as  small-pox was then raging in and about London they sojourned for some  time at Tunbridge Wells, drinking the waters. About the end of that  month Evelyn went to Sayes Court to prepare for their reception, but was  waylaid by footpads near Bromley and came near meeting his death from  them. Fortunately, however, 'did God deliver me from these villains, and  not onely so, but restor'd what they tooke, as twice before he had  graciously don, both at sea and land;... for which, and many signal  preservations, I am extreamly oblig'd to give thanks to God my Saviour.'    On 24th July, 1652, Mrs. Evelyn presented her husband with their first  child, their son, John, who predeceased his father in 1698. He now  busied himself in acquiring full possession of his father-in-law's and  the rebels' interests in Sayes Court, which he effected at a cost of  L3,500 early in 1653.    Then he began gardening and planting on a large scale, transforming the  almost bare fields around the house into fine specimens of the art of  horticulture, as then practised. Sayes Court was afterwards the  temporary residence of Peter the Great, who committed great havoc in the  gardens and hedges during his rough orgies. Here Evelyn lived quietly  till the time of the Restoration, spending his days in gardening and in  cultivating the acquaintance of men of cultured tastes like his own,  with occasional journeys to different parts of England. Thus he visited  Windsor, Marlborough, Bath, Oxford, Salisbury, Devizes, Gloucester,  Worcester, Warwick, Leicester, Doncaster, York, Cambridge, and many  other places, so that he probably saw a great deal more of England than  the majority of men in his position. Thus, too, he learned much about  the country and about all branches of rural economy. He had not yet  seriously given himself to literature, although his third work was  published in 1656, _An Essay on the First Book of T. Lucretius Cerus de  Rerum Natura. Interpreted and made English Verse_.    In January, 1658, heavy sorrow fell upon Evelyn by the death of his  younger son, an infant prodigy, and a sad and wonderful example of a  young brain being terribly overtaxed. 'After six fits of a quartan ague  with which it pleased God to visite him, died my dear Son Richard, to  our inexpressible grief and affliction, 5 yeares and 3 days old onely,  but at that tender age a prodigy for witt and understanding; for beauty  of body a very angel; for endowment of mind of incredible and rare  hopes. To give onely a little taste of them, and thereby glory to God,  he had learn'd all this catechisme who out of the mouths of babes and  infants does sometimes perfect his praises: at 2 years and a halfe old  he could perfectly read any of ye English, Latine, French, or Gothic  letters, pronouncing the first three languages exactly. He had before  the 5th yeare, or in that yeare, not onely skill to reade most written  hands, but to decline all the nouns, conjugate the verbs regular, and  most of ye irregular; learn'd out \"Puerilis,\" got by heart almost ye  entire vocabularie of Latine and French primitives and words, could make  congruous syntax, turne English into Latine, and _vice versa_, construe  and prove what he read, and did the government and use of relatives,  verbs, substantives, elipses, and many figures and tropes, and made a  considerable progress in Comenius's Janua; began himselfe to write  legibly, and had a stronge passion for Greeke. The number of verses he  could recite was prodigious, and what he remembered of the parts of  playes, which he would also act; and when seeing a Plautus in one's  hand, he ask'd what booke it was, and being told it was comedy, and too  difficult for him, he wept for sorrow. Strange was his apt and ingenious  application of fables and morals, for he had read AEsop; he had a  wonderful disposition to mathematics, having by heart divers  propositions of Euclid that were read to him in play, and he would make  lines and demonstrate them. As to his piety, astonishing were his  applications of Scripture upon occasion, and thus early, he understood  ye historical part of ye Bible and New Testament to a wonder, how Christ  came to redeeme mankind, and how comprehending these necessarys  himselfe, his godfathers were discharg'd of their promise. These and  like illuminations, far exceeding his age and experience, considering  the prettinesse of his adresse and behaviour, cannot but leave  impressions in me at the memory of him. When one told him how many days  a Quaker had fasted, he replied that was no wonder, for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2078"],[0,"Thais (#6)"],[1," a man should so calmly avow such  a sin. He expected to see the earth open, and Nicias swallowed up in  flames. But the earth remained solid, and the Alexandrian silent, his  forehead resting on his hand, and he smiling sadly at the memories of  his past youth. The monk rose, and continued in solemn tones--    \"Know then, O Nicias, that, with the aid of God, I will snatch this  woman Thais from the unclean affections of the world, and give her as  a spouse to Jesus Christ. If the Holy Spirit does not forsake me, Thais  will leave this city and enter a nunnery.\"    \"Beware of offending Venus,\" replied Nicias. \"She is a powerful goddess,  she will be angry with you if you take away her chief minister.\"    \"God will protect me,\" said Paphnutius. \"May He also illumine thy heart,  O Nicias, and draw thee out of the abyss in which thou art plunged.\"    And he stalked out of the room. But Nicias followed him, and overtook  him on the threshold, and placing his hand on his shoulder whispered  into his ear the same words--    \"Beware of offending Venus; her vengeance is terrible.\"    Paphnutius, disdainful of these trivial words, left without turning his  head. He felt only contempt for Nicias; but what he could not bear was  the idea that his former friend had received the caresses of Thais. It  seemed to him that to sin with that woman was more detestable than to  sin with any other. To him this appeared the height of iniquity, and he  henceforth looked upon Nicias as an object of execration. He had always  hated impurity, but never before had this vice appeared so heinous to  him; never before had it so seemed to merit the anger of Jesus Christ  and the sorrow of the angels.    He felt only a more ardent desire to save Thais from the Gentiles,  and that he must hasten to see the actress in order to save her.  Nevertheless, before he could enter her house, he must wait till the  heat of the day was over, and now the morning had hardly finished.  Paphnutius wandered through the most frequented streets. He had resolved  to take no food that day, in order to be the less unworthy of the  favours he had asked of the Lord. To the great grief of his soul, he  dared not enter any of the churches in the city, because he knew they  were profaned by the Arians, who had overturned the Lord's table. For,  in fact, these heretics, supported by the Emperor of the East, had  driven the patriarch Athanasius from his episcopate, and sown trouble  and confusion among the Christians of Alexandria.    He therefore wandered about aimlessly, sometimes with his eyes fixed on  the ground in humility, and sometimes raised to heaven in ecstasy. After  some time, he found himself on the quay. Before him lay the harbour,  in which were sheltered innumerable ships and galleys, and beyond them,  smiling in blue and silver, lay the perfidious sea. A galley, which bore  a Nereid at its prow, had just weighed anchor. The rowers sang as the  oars struck the water; and already the white daughter of the waters,  covered with humid pearls, showed no more than a flying profile to the  monk. Steered by her pilot, she cleared the passage leading from the  basin of the Eunostos, and gained the high seas, leaving a glittering  trail behind her.    \"I also,\" thought Paphnutius, \"once desired to embark singing on the  ocean of the world. But I soon saw my folly, and the Nereid did not  carry me away.\"    Lost in his thoughts, he sat down upon a coil of rope, and went to  sleep. During his sleep, he had a vision. He seemed to hear the sound of  a clanging trumpet, and the sky became blood red, and he knew that the  day of judgment had come. Whilst he was fervently praying to God, he saw  an enormous monster coming towards him, bearing on its forehead a cross  of light, and he recognised the sphinx of Silsile. The monster seized  him between its teeth, without hurting him, and carried him in its  mouth, as a cat carries a kitten. Paphnutius was thus conveyed across  many countries, crossing rivers and traversing mountains, and came at  last to a desert place, covered with scowling rocks and hot cinders. The  ground was rent in many places, and through these openings came a hot  air. The monster gently put Paphnutius down on the ground, and said--    \"Look!\"    And Paphnutius, leaning over the edge of the abyss, saw a river of fire  which flowed in the interior of the earth, between two cliffs of black  rocks. There, in a livid light, the demons tormented the souls of the  damned. The souls preserved the appearance of the bodies which had held  them, and even wore some rags of clothing. These souls seemed peaceful  in the midst of their torments. One of them, tall and white, his eyes  closed, a white fillet across his forehead, and a sceptre in his hand,  sang; his voice filled the desert shores with harmony; he sang of gods  and heroes. Little green devils pierced his lips and throat with red-hot  irons. And the shade of Homer still sang. Near by, old Anaxagoras, bald  and hoary, traced figures in the dust with a compass. A demon poured  boiling oil into his ear, yet failed, however, to disturb the sage's  meditations. And the monk saw many other persons, who, on the dark  shore by the side of the burning river, read, or quietly meditated, or  conversed with other spirits while walking,--like the sages and pupils  under the shadow of the sycamore trees of Academe. Old Timocles alone  had withdrawn from the others, and shook his head like a man who denies.  One of the demons of the abyss shook a torch before his eyes, but  Timocles would see neither the demon nor the torch.    Mute with surprise at this spectacle, Paphnutius turned to the monster.  It had disappeared, and, in place of the sphinx, the monk saw a veiled  woman, who said--    \"Look and understand. Such is the obstinacy of these infidels, that,  even in hell, they remain victims of the illusions which deluded them  when on earth. Death has not undeceived them; for it is very plain that  it does not suffice merely to die in order to see God. Those who are  ignorant of the truth whilst living, will be ignorant of it always. The  demons which are busy torturing these souls, what are they but agents of  divine justice? That is why these souls neither see them nor feel them.  They were ignorant of the truth, and therefore unaware of their own  condemnation, and God Himself cannot compel them to suffer.    \"God can do all things,\" said the Abbot of Antinoe.    \"He cannot do that which is absurd,\" replied the veiled woman. \"To  punish them, they must first be enlightened, and if they possessed the  truth, they would be like unto the elect.\"    Vexed and horrified, Paphnutius again bent over the edge of the abyss.  He saw the shade of Nicias smiling, with a wreath of flowers on his  head, sitting under a burnt myrtle tree. By his side was Aspasia of  Miletus, gracefully draped in a woollen cloak, and they seemed to talk  together of love and philosophy; the expression of her face was sweet  and noble. The rain of fire which fell on them was as a refreshing dew,  and their feet pressed the burning soil as though it had been tender  grass. At this sight Paphnutius was filled with fury.    \"Strike him, O God! strike him!\" he cried. \"It is Nicias! Let him weep!  let him groan! let him grind his teeth! He sinned with Thais!\"    And Paphnutius woke in the arms of a sailor, as strong as Hercules, who  cried--    \"Quietly! quietly! my friend! By Proteus, the old shepherd of the seals,  you slumber uneasily. If I had not caught hold of you, you would have  tumbled into the Eunostos. It is as true as that my mother sold salt  fish, that I saved your life.\"    \"I thank God,\" replied Paphnutius.    And, rising to his feet, he walked straight before him, meditating on  the vision which had come to him whilst he was asleep.    \"This vision,\" he said to himself, \"is plainly an evil one; it is an  insult to divine goodness to imagine hell is unreal. The dream certainly  came from the devil.\"    He reasoned thus because he knew how to distinguish between the dreams  sent by God and those produced by evil angels. Such discernment is  useful to the hermit, who lives surrounded by apparitions, and who,  in avoiding men, is sure to meet with spirits. The deserts are full of  phantoms. When the pilgrims drew near the ruined castle, to which the  holy hermit, Anthony, had retired, they heard a noise like that which  goes up from the public square of a large city at a great festival. The  noise was made by the devils, who were tempting the holy man.    Paphnutius remembered this memorable example. He also called to mind  St. John the Egyptian, who for sixty years was tempted by the devil.  But John saw through all the tricks of the demon. One day, however, the  devil, having assumed the appearance of a man, entered the grotto of the  venerable John, and said to him, \"John, you must continue to fast until  to-morrow evening.\" And John, believing that it was an angel who spoke,  obeyed the voice of the demon, and fasted the next day until the vesper  hour. That was the only victory that the Prince of Darkness ever gained  over St. John the Egyptian, and that was but a trifling one. It was  therefore not astonishing that Paphnutius knew at once that the vision  which had visited him in his sleep was an evil one.    Whilst he was gently remonstrating with God for having given him into  the power of the demons, he felt himself pushed and dragged amidst a  crowd of people who were all hurrying in the same direction. As he was  unaccustomed to walk in the streets of a city, he was shoved and knocked  from one passer to another like an inert mass; and being embarrassed by  the folds of his tunic, he was more than once on the point of falling.  Desirous of knowing where all these people could be going, he asked one  of them the cause of this hurry.    \"Do you not know, stranger,\" replied he, \"that the games are about to  begin, and that"]]]
