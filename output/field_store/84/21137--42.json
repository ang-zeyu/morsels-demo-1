A look of fierce  and deadly hate was on the robber's face, for, judging of others by  himself, he thought, no doubt, that his enemy meant to hasten his  destruction.    \"Here, catch hold--I'll save you!\" cried Lawrence, extending his strong  right hand.    A glance of surprise told that he was understood.  The bandit let go the  hold of one of his hands and made a convulsive grasp at his rescuer.  Their fingers touched, but at the same moment the branch gave way, and,  with a cry of wild despair, the wretched man went headlong down.    Not, however, to destruction.  The effort he had made threw him slightly  to one side of the line which his horse had taken in its fall.  The  difference was very slight indeed, yet it sufficed to send him towards  another bush lower down the cliff.  Still, the height he had to fall  would have ensured the breaking of all his bones if the bush had not  hurled him off with a violent rebound.    Lawrence almost felt giddy with horror.  Next moment a heavy plunge was  heard.  The man had fallen into a deep dark pool in the river, which was  scarce distinguishable from the cliffs above.  Being fringed with  bushes, it was impossible to note whether he rose again.  Lawrence was  still gazing anxiously at the pool, when something touched his cheek.  It was a lasso which Pedro had quietly dropped over his shoulders.    \"Hold fast to it, senhor, you'll never get up without it,\" he said, in  tones so earnest that the youth became suddenly alive to the great  danger of his position.  In the haste and anxiety of his descent he had  failed to note that one or two of the slight projections on which he had  placed his feet had broken away, and that therefore a return to the top  of the almost perpendicular precipice by the same route was  impracticable.  Even the slight ledge on which he stood, and from which  the little shrub grew, seemed to be crumbling away beneath his great  weight.  With that feeling of alarm which the sudden and unexpected  prospect of instant death brings, we presume, even to the stoutest  hearts, Lawrence clutched the line convulsively.  He was ignorant at  that time of the great strength of the South American lasso, and  hesitated to trust his life entirely to it.  Pedro guessed his feelings.    \"Don't fear to trust it,\" he said, \"many a wild bull it has held, four  times your size; but wait till Quashy and I get our feet well fixed--  we'll haul you up easily.\"    \"Have you made the end fast?\" cried Lawrence, looking up and  encountering the anxious gaze of the Indian maiden.    \"Yes, massa, all fast,\" answered Quashy, whose look of horror can be  more easily imagined than described.    \"Hold on, then, and _don't_ haul.\"    The two men obeyed, and the active youth pulled himself up hand over  hand, making good use in passing of any hollow or projection that  afforded the slightest hold for his toes.  At the top he was roughly  grasped by his rescuers and dragged into safety.    \"Poor fellow!\" he exclaimed, on reaching the top.    \"Well, massa,\" said Quashy, with a broad grin, \"das jist w'at I's agwine  to say, but you's too quick for me.\"    \"I meant the bandit, not myself,\" said Lawrence, looking over the cliff  at the pool with an expression of great pity.    \"Ha! don't be uneasy about him,\" said Pedro, with a short laugh, as he  resumed the binding of the stunned robber.  \"If he's killed or drowned  he's well out o' the way.  If he has escaped he'll be sure to recover  and make himself a pest to the neighbourhood for many a day to come.--  No, no, my good man, it's of no use, you needn't try it.\"    The latter part of this speech was in Spanish, and addressed to the  robber, who, having recovered consciousness, had made a sudden struggle  to shake off his captor.  As suddenly he ceased the effort on finding  that the strength of the guide was greatly superior to his own.    In another minute Pedro stood up, having bound the bandit's hands in  front of him in a manner that rendered any effort at self-liberation  impossible--at least in a short space of time.    \"There,\" said Pedro to Lawrence, \"I'll warrant him to lead a harmless  life until to-morrow at any rate.\"    As he spoke he drew the man's pistols, knife, and carbine, and handed  them to Quashy.    \"There,\" he said, \"you may find these useful.\"    Meanwhile the robber lay quietly on his back, glancing from one to  another of the party with looks of hatred that told clearly enough how  he would have acted had he been free.    Turning to him as he was about to remount and quit the scene, Pedro said  very sternly in Spanish--    \"You and I have met before, friend, and you know my powers with the  rifle at long-range.  If you offer to rise from the spot where you now  lie until we have disappeared round that rocky point half a mile along  the road, you are a dead man.  After we have turned the point, you may  go where you will and do what you please.  I might point out that in  refraining from cutting your throat I am showing mercy which you don't  deserve--but it is useless to throw pearls to swine.\"    The man spoke no word of reply, though he did look a little surprised as  the party left him and rode away.    \"Would it not have been safer to have bound his hands behind his back?\"  asked Lawrence.    \"No doubt it would, but he is secure enough for our purpose as he is.  If I had bound him as you suggest, he would have been almost certain to  perish, being quite unable to help himself.  As it is, he can use his  tied hands to some extent, and, by perseverance in sawing the lines  against sharp rocks, he will set himself free at last.  By that time,  however, we shall be beyond his reach.\"    From time to time they all glanced over their shoulders as they rode  along, but the bound man did not stir.  After they had passed beyond the  point of rock before referred to, Lawrence's curiosity prompted him to  turn back and peep round.    The bandit had already risen from the ground, and could be seen walking,  as quickly as circumstances permitted, up the track by which they had  just descended.    In a few minutes his tall figure was seen to pause for a brief space at  the summit of the pass.  Then it disappeared on the other side into the  gloomy recesses of the mountains.        CHAPTER FOUR.    IN WHICH QUASHY IS COMMUNICATIVE AND AN ENEMY IS TURNED INTO A FRIEND.    The pass which our travellers had just crossed merely led them over a  mountain chain which may be described as the Peruvian Cordillera.  Beyond it lay a fruitful valley of considerable extent, which terminated  at the base of the great range, or backbone, of the Andes.  Beyond this  again lay another valley of greater extent than the first, which was  bounded by a third range or cordillera of inferior height, the eastern  slopes of which descended on one hand in varying undulations to the  dense forests of equatorial Brazil, on the other, by easy gradations to  the level Pampas or plains which extend for hundreds of miles through  the lands of the Argentine Confederation to the Atlantic.    Two mountain passes, therefore, were still to be crossed, and Lawrence  Armstrong began to think that if things went on as they had begun a  pretty lively experience probably lay before them.    But in this he was mistaken, at least as regarded banditti, though in  some other respects the journey was not quite devoid of stirring  incidents--as we shall see.    We have said that the good-nature of the young Englishman induced him to  attempt conversation with the Indian girl, and at first Manuela appeared  to be amused, if not interested, by his unsuccessful efforts; but after  one of these futile attempts Pedro made some remarks to the girl in the  Indian tongue, and in a tone of remonstrance, which had the effect of  rendering her more silent and grave than before.  Lawrence, therefore,  finally ceased to address her, though his natural gallantry prompted him  to offer assistance when it seemed necessary, and to accost her with a  hearty good-night and good-morning each day.    As Pedro, in his capacity of guide, usually rode a few paces in advance,  and was frequently in a silent, abstracted mood, Lawrence was thus  thrown almost entirely on the negro for companionship.  Although the  young Englishman may not have estimated his company very highly, nothing  could have been more satisfactory to Quashy, who, with delight expressed  in every wrinkle and lineament of his black visage, fully availed  himself of his opportunities.    \"O Massa Lawrie!\" he exclaimed, at the close of one of their  conversations, \"how I does lub to talk ob de ole times when me an' you  was play togidder!\"    \"Yes, it's very nice to recall old times,\" answered Lawrence, with a  half-suppressed yawn, for they had by that time gone over the old times  so often that the novelty had rather worn off.    \"Yes, bery nice,\" repeated Quashy, with gleaming eyes, \"when I tink ob  de ole fadder an' de ole mill an' de ole fun what me an' you carried  on--oh! my heart goes like to bu'st.\"    \"Don't let it bu'st here, whatever you do, Quashy, for you'll need all  the heart you possess to carry you safely over these mountain passes.\"    Quashy opened his huge mouth, shut his eyes, and went off in a high  falsetto--his usual mode of laughing.  He always laughed at Lawrence's  little jokes, whether good or bad, insomuch that the youth finally  abstained from jesting as much as possible.    \"I did not know,\" continued Lawrence, \"that there were so many robbers  about.  Pedro tells me that the mountains are swarming with them just  now.\"    \"Ho yis, massa, plenty ob rubbers eberywhar,\" said Quashy, with a nod,  \"more nor 'nuff ob dem.  You see, massa, Chili an' Proo's a-fightin' wid  each oder jus' now.  What dey's fightin' about no mortial knows; an',  what's more, nobody cares.

Even landsmen can perceive that it must have required much faith to  trust a lifeboat in the circumstances.    \"The next sea that struck the lifeboat,\" continues the coxswain, \"landed  her within six feet of the foundation-stone of Tynemouth Dock, with a  quickness seldom witnessed.  The crew plied the remaining two oars to  leeward against the rudder and boathook.  We never saw anything till  coming near the three Shields lifeboats.  We asked them for oars to  proceed back to the Friendship, but they had none to spare.\"    Thus the brave Constance was baffled, and had to retire, severely  wounded, from the fight.  She drove, in her disabled and unmanageable  condition, into the harbour.  Of the four men thrown out of her, Grant  and Robson, who had found temporary refuge in the wrecked schooner,  perished.  The other two, Bell and Blackburn, were buoyed up by their  cork lifebelts, washed ashore, and saved.  The schooner itself was  afterwards destroyed, and her crew of four men and a boy were lost.    Meanwhile the screams of those on board of her and the Stanley were  borne on the gale to the vast crowds who, despite darkness and tempest,  lined the neighbouring cliffs, and the Shields lifeboats just referred  to made gallant attempts to approach the wrecks, but failed.  Indeed, it  seemed to have been a rash attempt on the part of the noble fellows of  the Constance to have made the venture at all.    The second cabin of the Stanley was on deck, and formed the bridge, or  outlook.  On this a number of the passengers and crew had taken refuge,  but a tremendous sea carried it, and all its occupants, bodily away.  After this the fury of the sea increased, and about an hour before  midnight the steamer, with a hideous crash, broke in two amidships.  The  after part remained fast; the fore part swung round.  All the people who  remained on the after part were swept away and drowned.  The new  position into which the fore part of the wreck had been forced was so  far an advantage to those who still clung to it, that the bows broke the  first violence of the waves, and thus partially protected the exhausted  people, thirty-five of whom still remained alive out of the sixty souls  originally on board.  Ten of these were passengers--two being ladies.    Meanwhile fresh preparations were being made by the rocket-men.  Messengers had been sent in hot haste to Cullercoats for more rockets,  those at Tynemouth having been exhausted.  They arrived at five o'clock  in the morning.  By that time the tide had fallen considerably,  admitting of a nearer approach to the wreck, and once more a gleam of  hope cheered the hearts of the perishing as they beheld the fiery  messenger of mercy rush fiercely towards them from the shore.  But hope  was still delayed.  Four of the rockets missed.  The fifth passed right  over them, dropping the lifeline on the wreck, and drawing from the poor  sufferers a feeble cheer, which was replied to lustily from the shore.  This time, fortunately, no mistakes were made by those on board.  The  blocks and tackle were drawn out, the hawser on which the sling-lifebuoy  traversed was fastened high up on the foremast to prevent the ropes  fouling the rocks, as they had done on the first attempt; then the  lifebuoy was run out, and, eventually, every soul was drawn in safety to  the shore.    Thus did that battle end, with much of disaster and death to regret,  indeed, but with upwards of thirty-five rescued lives to rejoice over.    I have now shown the action and bearing of our coast heroes, both in  circumstances of triumphant victory and of partial success.  Before  proceeding to other matters it is well to add that, when intelligence of  this disaster was telegraphed to the Lifeboat Institution, a new  lifeboat was immediately forwarded to Tynemouth, temporarily to replace  the damaged Constance.  Instructions were given for the relief of the  widows and children of the two lifeboat-men who had perished, and 26  pounds was sent to the crew of the boat.  At their next meeting the  committee of the Institution, besides recording their deep regret for  the melancholy loss of life, voted 100 pounds in aid of a fund raised  locally for the widows and seven children of the two men.  They likewise  bestowed their silver medal and a vote of thanks, inscribed on vellum,  to Mr Lawrence Byrne, of the coastguard, in testimony of his gallant  services on the occasion.  Contributions were also raised by a local  committee for the relief of the sufferers by these disasters, and a  Volunteer Corps was formed to assist in working the rocket apparatus on  future occasions of shipwreck.    Let me at this point earnestly request the reader who dwells in an  _inland_ home, and who never hears the roaring of the terrible sea,  carefully to note that in this case it was _men of the coast_ who did  the work, and _people of the coast town_ who gave subscriptions, who  sympathised with sufferers, and raised a Volunteer Corps.  Ponder this  well, good reader, and ask yourself the question, \"Is all as it should  be here?  Have I and my fellow-inlanders nothing to do but read, admire,  and say, Well done?\"  A hint is sufficient at this point.  I will return  to the subject hereafter.    Sometimes our gallant lifeboat-men when called into action go through a  very different and not very comfortable experience.  They neither gain a  glorious victory nor achieve a partial success, but, after all their  efforts, risks, and exposure, find that their services are not required,  and that they must return meekly home with nothing to reward them but an  approving conscience!    One such incident I once had the opportunity of observing.  I was living  at the time--for purposes of investigation, and by special permission--  on board of the Gull Lightship, which lies directly off Ramsgate  Harbour, close to the Goodwin Sands.  It was in the month of March.  During the greater part of my two weeks' sojourn in that lightship the  weather was reasonably fine, but one evening it came on to blow hard,  and became what Jack styles \"dirty.\"  I went to rest that night in a  condition which may be described as semi-sea-sick.  For some time I lay  in my bunk moralising on the madness of those who choose the sea for a  profession.  Suddenly I was roused--and the seasickness instantly  cured--by the watch on deck shouting down the hatchway to the mate,  \"South Sand Head Light is firing, sir, and sending up rockets!\"    The mate sprang from his bunk--just opposite to mine--and was on the  cabin floor before the sentence was well finished.  Thrusting the poker  with violence into the cabin fire, he rushed on deck.  I jumped up and  pulled on coat, nether garments, and shoes, as if my life depended on my  speed, wondering the while at the poker incident.  There was unusual  need for clothing, for the night was bitterly cold.    On gaining the deck I found the two men on duty actively at work, one  loading the lee gun, the other fitting a rocket to its stick.  A few  hurried questions by the mate elicited all that it was needful to know.  The flash of a gun from the South Sand Head Lightship, about six miles  distant, had been seen, followed by a rocket, indicating that a vessel  had got upon the fatal sands in her vicinity.  While the men were  speaking I saw the flash of another gun, but heard no report, owing to  the gale carrying the sound to leeward.  A rocket followed, and at the  same moment we observed the distress signal of the vessel in danger  flaring on the southern tail of the sands, but very faintly; it was so  far away, and the night so thick.    By this time our gun was charged and the rocket in position.    \"Look alive, Jack; fetch the poker!\" cried the mate, as he primed the  gun.    I was enlightened as to the poker!  Jack dived down the hatchway and  next moment returned with that instrument red-hot.  He applied it in  quick succession to gun and rocket.  A grand flash and crash from the  first was followed by a blinding blaze and a whiz as the second sprang  with a magnificent curve far away into surrounding darkness.  This was  our answer to the South Sand Head Lightship.  It was, at the same time,  our signal-call to the lookout on the pier of Ramsgate Harbour.    \"That's a beauty!\" said our mate, referring to the rocket.  \"Get up  another, Jack.  Sponge her well out, Jacobs; we'll give 'em another shot  in a few minutes.\"    Loud and clear were both our signals, but four and a half miles of  distance and a fresh gale neutralised their influence on that dark and  dismal night.  The lookout did not see them.  In a few minutes the gun  and rocket were fired again.  Still no answering signal came from  Ramsgate.    \"Load the weather gun!\" said the mate.    Jacobs obeyed, and I sought shelter under the lee of the weather  bulwarks, for the wind seemed to be made of pen-knives and needles!  The  sturdy Gull straining and plunging wildly at her huge cables, trembled  as our third gun thundered forth its summons, but the rocket struck the  rigging and made a low, wavering flight.  Another was therefore sent up,  but it had scarcely cut its bright line across the sky when we observed  the answering signal--a rocket from Ramsgate pier.    \"That's all right now, sir; _our_ work is done,\" said the mate to me, as  he went below and quietly turned in, while the watch, having sponged out  and re-covered the gun, resumed their active perambulations of the deck.    I confess that I felt somewhat disappointed at the sudden termination of  the noise and excitement.  I was told that the Ramsgate lifeboat could  not well be out in less than an hour.  There was nothing for it,  therefore, but patience, so I turned in, \"all standing,\" as sailors have  it, with a request that I should be called when the lights of the"]]]
