The lover of postage-stamps, small as his horizon  may be, does not hoard his colored bits of paper with the intent to  employ them in the mailing of letters. When some one complained to  Bedford that a book which he had bound did not shut properly, he  exclaimed, 'Why, bless me, sir, you've been _reading_ it!'\"    Herrick says that \"the truest owner of a library is he who has bought  each book for the love he bears to it; who is happy and content to  say, 'Here are my jewels, my choicest possessions!'\" Seneca, the great  Roman philologer, wrote: \"If you are fond of books, you will escape  the _ennui_ of life; you will neither sigh for evening, disgusted with  the occupations of the day, nor will you live dissatisfied with  yourself or unprofitable with others.\" \"I am quite transported and  comforted in the midst of my books,\" says the younger Pliny, who was  an ardent book-fancier; \"they give a zest to the happiest and assuage  the anguish of the bitterest moments of existence. Therefore, whether  distracted by the cares or losses of my family or my friends, I fly to  my library as the only refuge in distress: here I learn to bear  adversity with fortitude.\"    Southey thus immortalizes his speechless, yet beloved, library  companions:        My never failing friends are they,      With whom I converse day by day.    Balfour is no less eloquent in paying worthy tribute to his library:  \"The world may be kind or hostile; it may seem to us to be hastening  on the wings of enlightenment and progress to an imminent millennium,  or it may weigh us down with the sense of insoluble difficulty and  irremediable wrong; but whatever else it may be, so long as we have  good health and a library, it can never be dull.\"    \"Bookes,\" said the immortal Milton, \"demeane themselves as well as  men. Books are not absolutely dead things, but doe contain a potencie  of life in them to be as active as that soule was whose progeny they  are: nay they do preserve as in a violl the purest efficacie and  extraction of that living intellect that bred them. Unlesse warinesse  be us'd, as good almost kill a Man as kill a good Book; who kills a  man kills a reasonable creature, God's Image; but Hee who destroys a  good Booke, kills reason itselfe, kills the image of God, as it were  in the eye.\"    In the garnering of book-treasures, some collectors are prompted  wholly by mercenary motives--most of them, fortunately, are not. There  are biblio-mercenaries of such sordid inclinations that they would  readily part with almost any book in their possession,--even inscribed  presentation copies!--if lightly tempted with money considerations.  Verily, these parsimonious traders would barter their own souls, if  they possessed any value.    I am indebted to the Secretary of a well-known book club for the  following facts, to confirm which I saw all the correspondence. A  certain book-buyer joined the club some time ago, and subscribed for  the first publication issued after he became a member. Upon receiving  the work he wrote: \"I consider them among the most beautiful examples  of book-making that I have ever seen, and prize them above all other  books in my library.\" Six months later he sold the copy to a  book-agent for twice its original cost. He \"passed\" the next  publication issued by the club, as it did not interest him, but  appended a postscript to his letter, saying: \"If any member wants an  extra copy, I have no objection to one being issued upon my membership  and turned over to him, provided I receive the increase in price.\"    The following humorous incident is recorded in the (1903) Year Book  of another prominent book club. It may be explained that the club  issued a very elaborate and beautiful publication, printed upon deckle  edge handmade paper, illustrated with remarque proof copperplate  etchings on Japanese vellum, and in duplicate without remarque on  Whatman paper: \"One of the members upon receiving the first two  volumes of the ---- publication, writes: 'The Society starts out by  making the worst kind of a blunder. The man's picture in the front of  the volume is put in twice and on _two kinds of paper_. I could excuse  this error, but imagine my horror when upon turning to the back of the  volume I found the _same mistake repeated_. This is too much.' He  closed by expressing a desire to resign, saying that he did not know  he 'was joining a faddists club,' and takes occasion to remark further  that 'the books are cheaply finished, not even being trimmed and  gilded;' also that he 'can buy better books in the stores, _with full  gilt edges_, for less money.'\"    So much has been written about the vagaries of book-collectors and  bibliomaniacs that the subject has long since become threadbare, and  about the only unexplored field of labor left to the choice of him who  would gain a hearing with the reader--if one can be found who is not  already weary of reading what the wags think of his (or her) own  peculiar whims--is to fall in with the spirit of the age and compile  an \"International Library of the World's Greatest Gibberish about  Bibliomaniacs.\" We have the \"World's Greatest\" everything else in  book-lore, and I shall not be surprised if some enterprising publisher  gets out a \"definitive\" _de luxe_ edition of the \"World's Greatest  Dictionaries.\" Indeed, the Holy Bible itself has not escaped, for they  are now making a \"de luxe\" edition, in fourteen volumes! to be sold by  subscription. It will not be an \"Autograph Edition,\" however.    The freaks and fancies of capricious book-gatherers and bibliomaniacs  have undergone so few changes in the last hundred years that modern  writers on Bibliomania, after vainly searching the horizon for some new  development in the way of symptoms of the disease, or characteristics of  those afflicted, have wandered off into the verdure of adjacent fields  to avoid repetition. Some of them, from sheer lack of anything new to  say, have set upon each other in the most unflattering terms. Many of  the writers on the delectable \"Joys of a Book-buyer,\" or \"Habits of a  Bibliomaniac,\" etc., evidently appreciate the fact that these much  persecuted human beings have other pastimes and habits than collecting  books, and that they really inhabit the earth in all its civilized parts  and partake unstintedly of its many pleasurable diversions. But again,  there is another extreme, for I once read a book issued under the  misleading title of \"Pleasures of a Book-collector,\" or something of the  sort, which might have been more appropriately called the \"Pleasures of  a Single Man,\" seeing that the work had more to do with the hero's  hopeless love for a fair damsel, and his hours at clubs, cafes, and  other places of amusement in which I had no special interest, than it  did with the acquirement of literature. Thus, with the delusive idea  that I was to be ushered into some of the secret enjoyments of the  pleasing diversion of book-buying, I presently found myself more  familiar with the habits, vices, and various unimportant matters of the  author's conception--points, in short, having no bearing whatever upon  the subject under consideration--than with the pleasures of a  book-collector. The book was not badly written, nor wholly  uninteresting; but if a man buys a ticket to the opera, he doesn't go  prepared to see a cock-fight.    For literary scoffers and malcontents who find fault with everything  and everybody, who even scold publishers because their own books bring  but meagre royalties, who fuss and fume over the harmless foibles of  the very ones upon whom they depend for their audience, and like an  ungrateful dog fasten their teeth in the charitable hand that offers  them food, there can be but small sympathy. One is tempted to enlarge  upon this familiar type, but here I am digressing from my subject, and  am committing much the same offence as that of which I have elsewhere  accused others.    I have been asked to include within the scope of my article a few  remarks about Book Clubs and Book Societies. In presuming to trespass  upon sacred yet inviting ground of this character, I must be  understood as approaching the subject with due reverence and apology.  It is an indisputable fact that among the agencies that have  contributed to the advancement and ennobling of the bookmaker's art in  the past twenty years, the legitimate Book Club has been one of the  most potential. We have only to refer to _Growell's American Book  Clubs_ in order to learn of the many clubs and societies of this kind  which have arisen in the past few years, with varying degrees of  success and failure,--success, when intelligently conducted upon  honest cooeperative principles, and failure, if irrationally directed,  without regard to the maxims upon which successful clubs are managed.  The province of these worthy accessories in the world of fine  bookmaking has not been free from invasion by sharks and charlatans,  some of whom have succeeded for a time under the guise of honest and  reciprocal motives.    In this country there are private book clubs and societies that have  won places of enviable distinction both here and abroad, and naturally  among the foremost of these are the ones which have been pestered by  \"imitators.\" The following significant remarks are taken from the  president's annual address to the members of an old and honored book  club:--    \"Fame brings its penalties, and during the last year many of us have  suffered considerable annoyance, both individually and as members of  the Club, through the exploitation of books advertised sometimes as  publications of The ---- Club, and more often as publications of the  ---- Society. These have usually been offered in connection with works  of distinguished authors in numerous volumes, stated, as a rule, to be  limited to a thousand copies, and described as the contents of the  private library of a lady, which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22606"],[0,"The Booklover and His Books (#6)"],[1,"aries.    If the fortunes of a community in the modern world are bound up with the  use that it makes of books and libraries, no less are those of the  individual. This is true whether we refer to his private satisfaction or  to his public advancement. The animal is endowed with instinct, which is  sufficient for the guidance of his life, but it permits of no  development. Man must depend upon judgment, experience, reason--guides  that are often only too blind; but at least they admit of progress. In  fact it is only in the field of knowledge that human progress appears to  be possible. We have no better bodies than the ancient Greeks had--to  put the case very mildly. We have no better minds than they had--to make  an even safer assertion. But we _know_ almost infinitely more than they  did. In this respect the ancient Greeks were but as children compared  with ourselves. What makes this tremendous difference? Simply the fact  that we know all that was known by them and the Romans and the men of  the middle ages, and through this knowledge we have learned more by our  own discovery than they knew, all put together. The path to success for  men and races lies through the storehouse where this vast knowledge is  garnered--the library. But it is something more than a storehouse of  knowledge; it is an electrical battery of power. This knowledge, this  power, can be obtained in its fullness only through books. The man,  therefore, who aspires to lead his fellows, to command their respect or  their votes, must not rely on native talent alone; he must add to it the  stored-up talent of the ages.    There is an old proverb: \"No man ever got rich with his coat off.\" This  is a puzzling assertion, for it seems to contradict so many accepted  ideas. General Grant, for instance, when asked for his coat-of-arms,  replied: \"A pair of shirt sleeves.\" The answer showed an honorable pride  in labor; but we must remember that it was not General Grant's arms but  his brain that won his victories. Does not our proverb mean simply this:  that the great prizes of life--of which riches is the symbol, not the  sum--cannot be won by main strength and ignorance; that they can be won  only by energy making use of knowledge? But it is not only in the public  successes of life that books have a value for the individual. Public  successes are never the greatest that men win. It is in the expansion  and uplift of the inner self that books render their grandest service.  Emily Dickinson wrote of such a reader:        He ate and drank the precious words,        His spirit grew robust;      He knew no more that he was poor,        Nor that his frame was dust.      He danced along the dingy days,        And this bequest of wings      Was but a book. What liberty        A loosened spirit brings!    A final word on values. The philosophers make two great classes of  values, which may be entitled respectively Property and Possessions.  Under Property come money, houses, lands, carriages, clothing, jewels;  under Possessions come love, friendship, morality, knowledge, culture,  refinement. All are good things. There never were any houses or  carriages or clothes too good for a human being. But these obviously  belong to a different type of values from the other group--to a lower  type. What is the test, the touchstone, by which we can tell to which  class any value belongs? We shall find the test clearly stated in the  Sermon on the Mount. Is the treasure in question one that moth and rust  can corrupt or that thieves can break through and steal? If so, it  belongs to the lower class, to Property. But if it is one that cannot be  taken away, then it is a Possession and belongs to the higher type.  There is another test, which is really a part of this: Can you share it  without loss? If I own a farm, and give to another a half of it or a  year's crop from it, I deprive myself of just so much. But, if I have  knowledge or taste or judgment or affection, I can pour them all out  like water for the benefit of my fellows, and yet never have any the  less. On the contrary, I shall find that I have more; for they grow by  sharing. But we have not yet done with the superiority of Possessions  over Property. \"Shrouds have no pockets,\" says the grim old proverb; and  all Property must be laid down at the edge of the grave. But if man be  immortal, as the wise in all ages have believed, then we do not have to  lay down our Possessions with this mortal body. For, if the soul when  freed from the flesh is to remain the soul, the self--and only so can  immortality have any meaning--then it must keep all those inner  acquisitions of knowledge, culture, and character which it has gathered  on earth; nay, it then for the first time truly comes into the enjoyment  of them. What were our earthly Possessions become Treasures laid up for  ourselves in Heaven.          THE BOOK OF TO-DAY AND THE BOOK OF TO-MORROW      The book of to-day is not necessarily the parent of the book of  to-morrow, just as it is itself not necessarily the child of the book of  yesterday. The relation is apt to be one of succession and influence  rather than anything suggesting biological evolution. Nature, according  to Linnaeus's famous maxim, never goes by leaps, but the book is a human  product, and human nature takes its chief pride in its leaps, calling  them inventions and discoveries. Such a leap in book production was the  substitution of parchment for papyrus, of paper for parchment, of  mechanical for manual processes when writing was displaced by  typography, of higher for lower mechanism in the creation of the power  perfecting press. These inventions had behind them, to be sure, the  impetus of economic demand, but no such partial explanation can be given  for the advent of William Morris among the printers of the late  nineteenth century, unless an unrecognized artistic need may be said to  constitute an economic demand.    The book of to-day in its best examples resembles not so much the book  of yesterday as that of some earlier days, and we may count this fact a  fortunate one, since it relegates to oblivion the books made in certain  inartistic periods, notably of the one preceding the present revival. It  is rather the best of the whole past of the book, and not the book of  to-day alone, that influences the character to be taken by the book of  to-morrow. This element is a historical one and a knowledge of it may be  acquired by study; it is the possible inventions that baffle our  prophecies. We know that any time some new process may be discovered  that will transform the book into something as unlike its present  character as that is unlike the papyrus roll. But because the element of  invention is so uncertain we can only recognize it, we cannot take it  into account. Our advantage in considering the book of to-day in  connection with the book of to-morrow will be chiefly a negative one, in  making the book as it is, so far as we find it defective, our point of  departure in seeking the book as it ought to be.    To-day, for our present purposes, may be taken as beginning with the  great work of Morris. But its book includes the worst as well as the  best. It is not only the book by which we in our jealousy for the  reputation of our age should like to have our age remembered, but also  the more frequent book that we have to see and handle, however much  against our will, and sometimes even to buy. We may congratulate  ourselves that this book will perish by its own defects, leaving after  all only the best book to be associated with our age; but this does not  alter the fact that in the present the undesirable book is too much with  us, is vastly in the majority, is, in fact, the only book that the great  mass of our contemporaries know. How bad it is most book buyers do not  realize; if they did, a better book would speedily take its place. But,  until they do, our only chance of relief is the doubtful one of an  invention that shall make good books cheaper to make than poor ones, or  the difficult one of educating the public in the knowledge of what a  book should be. The latter is obviously our only rational hope; but  before we turn to consider it, let us first look at the book of to-day  to see exactly what it is.    The book of to-day is first of all a novel. It has other forms, to be  sure,--poetry, essays, history, travels, works of science and art,--but  these do not meet the eye of the multitude. We may disregard them for  the moment, and, in reply to the question, What is the book of to-day?  we may say: It is a one-volume novel, a rather clumsy duodecimo, with a  showy cover adorned with a colored picture of the heroine. It is printed  on thick paper of poor quality, with type too large for the page, and  ugly margins equal all around. Its binding is weak, often good for only  a dozen readings, though quite as lasting as the paper deserves. For  merits it can usually offer clear type, black ink, and good presswork.  But its great fault is that in addressing the buyer it appeals to the  primitive instinct for bigness rather than to the higher sense that  regards quality. Such is the book of to-day, emphatically what Franklin  over a hundred years ago called a \"blown\" book.    But though the novel fills the multitude's field of vision, it is after  all not the only contemporary book; there are others from which we may  be able to choose one worthier to be the book of to-day than the  self-elected novel. But we shall not find it where commercialism is  rife. In the presence of that element we find still only an appeal to  the many--which, if successful, means large profits--by an appearance of  giving much while really giving little. In this game of illusion the  sound principles of bookmaking are forsaken. Books are not designed on  the basis of what they are, but on the basis of what they can be made to  seem. The result is puffery, not merely in"]]]
