THE INFLUENCE OF WOMAN ON THE MORAL SENTIMENTS.--The influence of woman  on the moral sentiments of society is intimately connected with her  influence on its religious character; for religion and a pure and elevated  morality must ever stand in the relation to each other of effect and cause.  The heart of a woman is formed for the abode of sacred truth; and for the  reasons alike honorable to her character and to that of society. From the  nature of humanity this must be so, or the race would soon degenerate, and  moral contagion eat out the heart of society. The purity of home is the  safeguard to American manhood.           *       *       *       *       *      {31}    Personal Purity.     \"Self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control,    These three alone lead life to sovereign power.\"--TENNYSON.           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration]    1. WORDS OF THE GREAT TEACHER.--Mark the words of the Great Teacher: \"If  thy right hand or foot cause thee to fall, cut it off and cast it from  thee. If thy right eye cause thee to fall, pluck it out. It is better for  thee to enter into life maimed and halt, than having two eyes to be cast  into hell-fire, where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.\"    2. A MELANCHOLY FACT.--It is a melancholy fact, in human experience, that  the noblest gifts which men possess are constantly prostituted to other  purposes than those for which they are designed. The most valuable and  useful organs of the body are those which are capable of the greatest  dishonor, abuse, and corruption. What a snare the wonderful organism of the  eye may become, when used to read corrupt books, or to look upon licentious  pictures, or vulgar theater scenes, or when used to meet the fascinating  gaze of the harlot! What an instrument for depraving the whole man may be  found in the matchless powers of the brain, the hand, the mouth, or the  tongue! What potent instruments may these become in accomplishing the ruin  of the whole being, for time and eternity! {32}    3. ABSTINENCE.--Some can testify with thankfulness that they never knew the  sins of gambling, drunkenness, fornication, or adultery. In all these cases  abstinence has been, and continues to be, liberty. Restraint is the noblest  freedom. No man can affirm that self-denial ever injured him; on the  contrary, self-restraint has been liberty, strength and blessing. Solemnly  ask young men to remember this when temptation and passion strive as a  floodtide to move them from the anchorage and peace of self-restraint.  Beware of the deceitful stream of temporary gratification, whose eddying  current drifts towards license, shame, disease and death. Remember how  quickly moral power declines, how rapidly the edge of the fatal maelstrom  is reached, how near the vortex, how terrible the penalty, how fearful the  sentence of everlasting punishment!    4. FRANK DISCUSSION.--The time has arrived for a full and frank discussion  of those things which affect the personal purity. Thousands are suffering  to-day from various weaknesses, the causes of which they have never  learned. Manly vigor is not increasing with that rapidity which a Christian  age demands. Means of dissipation are on the increase. It is high time,  therefore, that every lover of the race should call a halt, and inquire  into the condition of things. Excessive modesty on this subject is not  virtue. Timidity in presenting unpleasant but important truths has  permitted untold damage in every age.    5. MAN IS A CARELESS BEING.--He is very much inclined to sinful things. He  more often does that which is wrong than that which is right, because it is  easier, and, for the moment, perhaps, more satisfying to the flesh. The  Creator is often blamed for man's weaknesses and inconsistencies. This is  wrong. God did not intend that we should be mere machines, but free moral  agents. We are privileged to choose between good and evil. Hence, if we  perseveringly choose the latter, and make a miserable failure of life, we  should blame only ourselves.    6. THE PULPIT.--Would that every pulpit in the land might join hands with  the medical profession and cry out with no uncertain sound against the  mighty evils herein stigmatized! It would work a revolution for which  coming society could never cease to be grateful.    7. STRIVE TO ATTAIN A HIGHER LIFE.--Strive to attain unto a higher and  better life. Beware of all excesses, of whatever nature, and guard your  personal purity with sacred determination. Let every aspiration be upward,  and be strong in every good resolution. Seek the light, for in light there  is life, while in darkness there is decay and death. {33}    [Illustration: CONFIDENCE THAT SOMETIMES MAKES TROUBLE.]           *       *       *       *       *      {34}    How to Write All Kinds of Letters.    [Illustration]    1. From the President in his cabinet to the laborer in the street; from the  lady in her parlor to the servant in her kitchen; from the millionaire to  the beggar; from the emigrant to the settler; from every country and under  every combination of circumstances, letter writing in all its forms and  varieties is most important to the advancement, welfare and happiness of  the human family.    2. EDUCATION.---The art of conveying thought through the medium of written  language is so valuable and so necessary, a thorough knowledge of the  practice must be desirable to every one. For merely to write a good letter  requires the exercise of much of the education and talent of any writer.    3. A GOOD LETTER.--A good letter must be correct in every mechanical  detail, finished in style, interesting in substance, and intelligible in  construction. Few there are who do not need write them; yet a letter  perfect in detail is rarer than any other specimen of composition.    4. PENMANSHIP.--It is folly to suppose that the faculty for writing a good  hand is confined to any particular persons. There is no one who can write  at all, but what can write well, if only the necessary pains are practiced.  Practice makes perfect. Secure a few copy books and write an hour each day.  You will soon write a good hand. {35}    5. WRITE PLAINLY.--Every word of even the most trifling document should be  written in such clear characters that it would be impossible to mistake it  for another word, or the writer may find himself in the position of the  Eastern merchant who, writing to the Indies for five thousand mangoes,  received by the next vessel five hundred monkies, with a promise of more in  the next cargo.    6. HASTE.--Hurry is no excuse for bad writing, because any one of sense  knows that everything hurried is liable to be ruined. Dispatch may be  acquired, but hurry will ruin everything. If, however, you must write  slowly to write well, then be careful not to hurry at all, for the few  moments you will gain by rapid writing will never compensate you for the  disgrace of sending an ill-written letter.    7. NEATNESS.--Neatness is also of great importance. A fair white sheet with  handsomely written words will be more welcome to any reader than a blotted,  bedaubed page covered with erasures and dirt, even if the matter in each be  of equal value and interest. Erasures, blots, interlineations always spoil  the beauty of any letter.    8. BAD SPELLING.--When those who from faulty education, or forgetfulness  are doubtful about the correct spelling of any word, it is best to keep a  dictionary at hand, and refer to it upon such occasions. It is far better  to spend a few moments in seeking for a doubtful word, than to dispatch an  ill-spelled letter, and the search will probably impress the spelling upon  the mind for a future occasion.    9. CARELESSNESS.--Incorrect spelling will expose the most important or  interesting letter to the severest sarcasm and ridicule. However perfect in  all other respects, no epistle that is badly spelled will be regarded as  the work of an educated gentleman or lady. Carelessness will never be  considered, and to be ignorant of spelling is to expose an imperfect  education at once.    10. AN EXCELLENT PRACTICE.--After writing a letter, read it over carefully,  correct all the errors and re-write it. If you desire to become a good  letter writer, improve your penmanship, improve your language and grammar,  re-writing once or twice every letter that you have occasion to write,  whether on social or business subjects.    11. PUNCTUATION.--A good rule for punctuation is to punctuate where the  sense requires it, after writing a letter and reading it over carefully you  will see where the punctuation marks are required, you can readily  determine where the sense requires it, so that your letter will convey the  desired meaning. {36}    [Illustration]    12. CORRESPONDENCE.--There is no better school or better source for  self-improvement than a pleasant correspondence between friends. It is not  at all difficult to secure a good list of correspondents if desired. The  young people who take advantage of such opportunities for self-improvement  will be much more popular in the community and in society. Letter writing  cultivates the habit of study; it cultivates the mind, the heart, and  stimulates self-improvement in general.    13. FOLDING.--Another bad practice with those unaccustomed to corresponding  is to fold the sheet of writing in such a fantastic manner as to cause the  receiver much annoyance in opening it. To the sender it may appear a very  ingenious performance, but to the receiver it is only a source of vexation  and annoyance, and may prevent the communication receiving the attention it  would otherwise merit.    14. SIMPLE STYLE.--The style of letter writing should be simple and  unaffected, not raised on stilts and indulging in pedantic displays which  are mostly regarded as cloaks of ignorance.

Shawnee was dying, but he was still on his feet, and he could be headed  away from the carnage in that water. Drew, his face sick and white,  turned the horse toward the railroad tracks.    \"Drew!\"    Croxton? No, but somehow Drew was not surprised to see Boyd trying to  keep his feet, being dragged along by two plunging horses, their eyes  white-rimmed with terror. The only wonder was that the scout had heard  that call through the din of screaming and shouting, the wild neighs of  the horses, and the continual crackle of small arms' fire.    \"Mount! Mount and ride!\" He mouthed the order, not daring to pull up  Shawnee, already past Boyd and his horses. The roan's hoofs spurned  gravel from the track line now. And Boyd drew level with him and mounted  one of the horses, continuing to lead the other. There was a cattle  guard ahead to afford some protection from the storm churning along the  river.    \"Where?\" Boyd called.    Drew, his thumb still planted in the hole which was becoming Shawnee's  death, nodded to the guard. They made it, and Drew kneed the roan closer  to the extra horse Boyd led, slinging his saddlebags across to the other  mount. Then he dismounted, releasing his hold on the roan's wound. For  the second time Shawnee cried, but this time it was no warrior's protest  against death; it was the nicker of a question. The answering shot from  Drew's Colt was lost in the battle din. He was upon the other horse  before Shawnee had stopped breathing.    \"Come on!\" Drew's voice was strident as he spurred, herding Boyd before  him. Two of them, then three, four, as they came out on the bank of a  millpond. Across that stretch of water there was safety, or at least the  illusion of safety.    \"Drew!\" For the second time he was hailed. It was Sam Croxton, holding  onto the saddle horn with both hands, a stream of red running from a  patch of blood-soaked hair over one ear. He swayed, his eyes wide open  as those of the frightened horses, but fastened now on Drew as if the  other were the one stable thing in a mad world.    \"Can you stick on?\" Drew leaned across to catch the reins the other had  dropped.    A small spark of understanding awoke in those wide eyes. \"I'll stick,\"  the words came thickly. \"I ain't gonna rot in that damned prison  again--never!\"    \"Boyd ... on his other side! We'll try gettin' him across together.\"    \"Yes, Drew.\" Boyd's voice sounded unsteady, but he did not hesitate to  bring his own mount in on Croxton's right.    \"You'd best let me take that theah jump first, soldier.\" The stranger  sent his horse in ahead of Drew's. \"It don't necessarily foller that  because that's water a man can jus' natcherly git hisself across in one  piece. I'll give it a try quicker'n you can spit and holler Howdy.\"    As if he were one with the raw-boned bay he bestrode, he jumped his  mount into the waiting pond. Still threshing about in the welter of  flying water, he glanced back and raised a hand in a come-ahead signal.    \"Bottom's a mite missin', but the drop ain't so much. Better make it  'fore them fast-shootin' hombres back theah come a-takin' you.\"    Though they did not move in the same reckless fashion as their guide,  somehow they got across the pond and emerged dripping on the other side.  The determination which had made Croxton try the escape, seemed to fade  as they rode on. He continued to hold to the horn, but he slumped  further over in a bundle of misery. Their pond guide took Boyd's station  to the right, surveying the half-conscious man critically.    \"This hoorawin' around ain't gonna do that scalpin' job no good,\" he  announced. \"He can't ride far 'less he gits him a spell of rest an'  maybe has a medicine man look at that knock--\"    Croxton roused. \"I stick an' I ride!\" He even got a measure of firmness  into his tone. \"I don't go to no Yankee prison....\" He tried to reach  for the reins, but Drew kept them firmly to hand.    There was a shot behind them, three or four more fugitives plunged down  to the millpond, and the last one in line fired back at some yet unseen  pursuer.    \"Then we git!\" But across Croxton's bowed shoulders the other shook his  head warningly at Drew.    He was young and as whipcord thin and tough as most of those over-weary  men from the badgered and now broken command, but he was not tense,  riding rather with the easy adjustment to the quickened pace of a man  more at home in the saddle than on foot. His weather-browned face was  seamed with a scar which ran from left temple to the corner of his  mouth, and his hair was a ragged, unkempt mop of brown-red which tossed  free as he rode, since he was hatless.    With Croxton boxed between them, Drew and the stranger matched pace at  what was a lope rather than a gallop as Boyd ranged ahead. Another  flurry of shots sounded from behind, and they cut across a field, making  for the doubtful cover of a hedge. There was no way, Drew decided after  a quick survey, for them to get back into town and join the general  retreat. The Yankees must be well between them and any of the force  across the Licking.    When they had pushed through the hedge they were faced by a lane running  in the general northwest direction. It provided better footing, and it  led away from the chaos at Cynthiana. With Croxton on their hands it was  the best they could hope for, and without more than an exchange of  glances they turned into it, the wounded man's horse still between them.    The cover of the hedge wall provided some satisfaction and Drew dared to  slow their pace. Under his tan Sam was greenish-white, his eyes half  closed, and he rode with his hands clamped about the saddle horn as if  his grip upon that meant the difference between life and death. But  Drew knew he could not hope to keep on much longer.    There might be Confederate sympathizers in the next farmhouse who would  be willing to take in the wounded scout. On the other hand, the  inhabitants could just as well be Union people. It was obvious that Sam  could not keep going, and it was just as obvious to Drew that they--or  at least he--could not just ride on and leave him untended by the side  of the road.    \"Boyd!\" So summoned, the youngster reined in to wait for them. \"You ride  on! You, too!\" Drew addressed the stranger.    Boyd shook his head, though he glanced at the winding road ahead. \"I  ain't leavin' you!\" His lip was sticking out in that stubborn pout.    At that moment Drew could have lashed out at him and enjoyed it, or at  least found a satisfaction in passing on some of his own exasperation  and frustration.    \"We got a far piece to travel,\" commented the stranger. \"An' I guess  I'll string along with you, 'less, of course, this heah is a closed game  an' you ain't sellin' any chips 'cross the table. Me, I'm up from Texas  way--Anson ... Anse Kirby, if you want a brand for the tally book. An'  most all a Yankee's good for anyway is to be shucked of his boots.\" He  freed one foot momentarily from the stirrup and surveyed a piece of very  new and shiny footware with open admiration. It was provided with a  highly ornate silver spur, not military issue but Mexican work, Drew  guessed.    \"You from Gano's Company?\" the scout asked.    Kirby nodded. \"Nowadays, but it was Terry's Rangers 'fore I stopped me a  saber with this heah tough old head of mine an' was removed for a  while. That Yankee almost fixed me so m' own folks wouldn't know me from  a fresh-skinned buffala--not that I got me any folks any more.\" He  grinned and that expression was a baring of teeth like a wolf's  uninhibited snarl. \"You one of Quirk's rough-string scout boys, ain't  you? We sure raised hell an' put a chunk under it back theah. Them  Yankees are gonna be as techy as teased rattlers. An' I don't see as how  we can belly through the brush with this heah hombre. He's got him a  middle full of guts to stick it this far. Long 'bout now he must have  him a horse-size headache....\"    Croxton swayed and only Drew's crowding their horses together kept the  now unconscious scout from falling into the road dust. Kirby steadied  the limp body from the other side.    \"Keep pullin' him 'round this way, amigo, an' he'll be planted  permanent, all neat an' pretty with a board up at his head.\"    \"There's a house--back there.\" Boyd pointed to the right, where a narrow  lane angled away from their road, a small house to be seen at its end.    Drew, Croxton's weight resting against his shoulder, studied the house.  The distant crackle of carbine fire rippled across the fields and came  as a rumble of warning. It was plain that Croxton could not ride on, not  at the pace they would have to maintain in order to outdistance pursuit;  nor could he be left to shift for himself. To visit the house might be  putting them straight into some Yankee's pocket, but it was the only  solution open now.    \"Hey, those mules!\" Boyd had already ventured several horse lengths down  the lane. Now he jerked a forefinger at two animals, heads up, ears  pointed suspiciously forward, that were approaching the fence at a  rocking canter. \"Those are Jim Dandy's! You remember Jim Dandy, Drew?\"    \"Jim Dandy--?\" the other echoed. And then he did recall the little  Englishman who had been a part of the Lexington horse country since long  before the war. Jim Dandy had been one of the most skillful jockeys ever  seen in the blue grass, until he took a bad spill back in '59 and  thereafter set himself up as a consultant trainer-vet to the comfort of  any stable with a hankering to win racing glory.    To a man like Jim Dandy politics or war might not be all-important. And  the fact that he had known the households of both Oak Hill and Red  Springs could count for a better reception now. At least they could try.    \"No use you"]]]
