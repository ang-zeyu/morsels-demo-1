I should say not, however.  But what do you mean by your five pounds of cinnamon?\"    \"Why, Mrs. Gildersleeve's little girl was in here this morning, and said  Mrs. Markham sent for five pounds of cinnamon and two of raisins.\"    \"Mrs. Gildersleeve's girl? I know Mrs. Markham never sent for no such  things. She knew I was coming down myself this afternoon.\"    He followed Mr. Hampshire down the store to the desk. There it was in  the day-book:--          \"Reub Markham, Dr., per Roxy Gildersleeve.      To 5 pounds cinnamon, 40c.,                       $2 00      \"  2   \"    raisins (layer), 20c.,                   40    That Mr. Reub Markham swore, must also be set down against him. He drove  home in a red rage. Through the open school-house door, little Roxy  Gildersleeve saw him pass; but her merry young heart boded no ill. Her  mouth was tingling pungently with the fine cinnamon, and in her pocket  yet were eight moist, fat, sugary raisins, to be slipped in her mouth  one by one, four during the geography lesson, four during the spelling  lesson.    As it happened, Mr. Gildersleeve was cultivating corn in a field that  fronted the highway. He and his wealthier neighbor were not on the best  of terms. A line fence and an unruly ox had made trouble. Mr.  Gildersleeve had sued Mr. Markham, and beat him; and Mr. Gildersleeve  didn't take any pains now to look up as he saw who was coming.    But Mr. Markham drew up his horses.    \"Hello, Gildersleeve!\"    \"Hello yourself, Mr. Markham!\"    \"I say, what you sending your young uns down to the store after things,  and charging them to me for? Mighty creditable that, Tom Gildersleeve!\"    \"Getting things and charging them to you!\" Gildersleeve stopped his  horse. \"What do you mean, Markham?\"    \"You better go down and ask Hampshire. If you don't, you may get it  explained in a way you won't fancy!\"    He whipped up his horses and drove off, leaving Mr. Gildersleeve  standing there, gazing after him as if he had lost his senses. After a  moment he unhitched his horse from the cultivator, mounted him, and rode  off toward the village.    School was out. Roxy had reached home. She was setting the table, and  whistling like a blackbird. Things had gone so happily at school!  Everything was so neat, and pleasant, and cosy at home! She saw her  father ride into the yard, and go to the barn. She whistled on.    She sat in the big rocking-chair, stoning cherries, and smelling the  roses by the window, when he came into the kitchen.    \"Where's Roxy?\" she heard him ask.    \"In the other room, I guess,\" said mother.    He came in where she was. She looked up; and her little stained hands  fell back into the pan. She knew the day of judgment had come. O, she  wished it was that other day, the day of death, instead! Her mouth  dropped open, the room turned dark.    Mr. Gildersleeve sank down on a chair. His child's face was too much for  him. He groaned aloud. \"That one of _my_ children should ever be talked  about as a thief! What possessed you, Roxy?\"    Roxy sat before him, trembling. Not at the prospect of punishment. But  she saw her father's eyes filling up with tears. \"Don't, father,\" she  said, hurriedly, trying not to cry. \"I've only eaten a little, and I  will carry it all back. If you will pay for what is gone, I'll sell  berries or something, and pay you back the money. Mr. Hampshire is a  good man; he won't tell, father, if you ask him not.\"    \"You poor, ignorant child!\"    He got up and went out, shutting the door after him. Not one word of  punishment; but he left Roxy trembling with a strange terror. She shook  with a presentiment of some unendurable public disgrace. Setting down  the pan of cherries, she crept to the door. She heard her father's  voice, her mother's sharp exclamations. Then her father said, \"To think  _our_ girl should sin in such a high-handed way! Mother, I'd rather laid  her in her grave any day! That hot-headed Markham will not rest until  he's published it from Dan to Beersheba. She's only a child, but this  thing will stick to her as long as she lives.\"    Her mother sobbed. \"Our poor Roxy! Tom, if the school children get hold  of it, she will never go another day. The child is so sensitive! I don't  know how to punish her as I ought. I can only think how to save her  from what is before her.\"    O, how Roxy, standing at the key-hole, trembled to see her mother lean  her head on her father's shoulder and sob, and to see tears on her  father's cheeks! O, what a wicked, wicked girl! It _was_ thieving; in  some way it was even worse than that; as if she had committed a--a  forgery, maybe, Roxy thought. She was conscious she had done something  unusually daring and dreadful.    She stole off up stairs, shut herself in, and cried as hard as she could  cry. Afterward her little brain began to busy itself in many directions.  She tried to fancy herself shamed and pointed at, afraid to go to  school, afraid to go down to the store, ashamed to go to the table, with  no right to laugh, and play, and stay around near her mother, never  again to dare ask her father to ride when he was going off with the  horses.    So lonely and gloomy, she tried to think what it was possible to do. At  last, as in the morning, a daring thought occurred to her suddenly. She  made up her mind in just one minute to do it.    When her mother called, she went down to supper at once. The boys were  gone. Nobody but she and father and mother; and the three had very red  eyes, and said nothing, but passed things to each other in a kind,  quiet way, that seemed to Roxy like folks after a funeral--perhaps it  did to the rest of them. Roxy was fanciful enough to think to herself,  \"Yes, it is _my_ funeral. We have just buried my good name.\"    Silently, one with a white face, the other with a red one, Roxy and her  mother did up the work. Then Roxy went up to her room again. She took a  sheet of foolscap, and made it into four sheets of note paper. She wrote  and printed something on each sheet, and folded all the sheets into  letters. Then she went down stairs. Two of the little letters she handed  to her mother. Then, bonnet in hand, she stole out the front door. At  the gate she looked down the road toward the village, up the road toward  Mr. Markham's. She started toward Mr. Markham's. She got over the road  marvelously; for the child was wild to get the thing over with. She was  going up the path to the house when she saw Mr. Markham hoeing in the  garden. She went to him, thrust a note into his hand, and was off like a  dart.    It was a long, hard, lonely run down to the village. How lonely in the  grove at the hollow tree! How like a thief, with the bundles openly on  her arm! No little girl's pocket would hold them, nothing but a great  Judas-bag. She went straight to the stone store. It was just sunset.  How thankful she was to find nobody in the store but Mr. Hampshire  himself, reading the evening paper. He looked up, and recognized the red  little face. He glanced at the bundles as she threw them, with a letter,  down on the counter, and whisked out through the door. He called after  her, \"Here, here, Roxy; here, my dear! Come back. I have some figs for  you!\"    But no Roxy came back. He heard her little heels clattering down the  sidewalk fast as they could go. So he got up and read the letter, for it  was directed to himself.    Here are the four notes Roxy wrote:--        \"Dear Father: I Will paye you every Cent if I Live. I shall always      be a Good Girl, and never hanker after Only what I have Got. Please      forgive Me, and Not Talk It Over with Mother. It will make her Sick.                                                                  Roxy.\"        \"Dear Mother: Please love me until I am Bad once More. If I ever,      Ever, should be Bad again, then you may give me Up. Don't get Sick.                                                                  Roxy.\"        \"Mr. MarkHam: I have been Very Wicked. I have made father and Mother      wretched. I am sorry. Please don't be Hard on Me, and Set every      body against me, because My Mother would settle right down and be      very Sick. I am only a Little girl, and a Big Man might let me go. I      have taken the Things back to the Store. Also father has Paid for      them. _You_ may Want something some day, and do Wrong to get it, and      Then you will know How good it is.               R. Gildersleeve.\"        \"Mr. HamPshire: Please Not tell the folks that come into the Store      what I did. I want a Chance to be good. If you Ever hear of my      stealing again, Then you can tell, of course.    R. Gildersleeve.\"    And here is what they said:--    _Mr. Gildersleeve_ (crying). \"Here, mother, put this away. Never speak  of it to her. Poor child, I _did_ mean to whip her!\"    _Mrs. Gildersleeve_ (crying). \"Bless her heart, Tom, this is true  repentance! Our child will not soon forget this lesson. Let us be very  good to her.\"    _Mr. Markham_ (laughing). \"Young saucebox! But there's true grit for  you! Well, I don't think I shall stoop to injure a child. Let it go. I'm  quits with Tom now, and we'll begin again even.\"    _Mr. Hampshire_ (laughing). \"She's a nice little dot, after all. I  don't see what possessed her. I'd like to show this to Maria; guess I  won't, though, for it is partly _my_ business to keep the little name  white.\"        And none of them ever told. When Roxy was an old woman, she related to  me the story herself. The name was kept white through life. Such a  scrupulous, kindly, charitable old lady! The only strange thing about  her was, that she never could eat anything flavored with cinnamon, or  which had raisins in it.

Thus when we arrange all the known  peoples of the world according to the degree of their savagery or  civilisation in a graduated scale of culture, we obtain not merely a  comparative view of their relative positions in the scale, but also in  some measure an historical record of the genetic development of culture  from a very early time down to the present day. Hence a study of the  savage and barbarous races of mankind is of the greatest importance for  a full understanding of the beliefs and practices, whether religious,  social, moral, or political, of the most civilised races, including our  own, since it is practically certain that a large part of these beliefs  and practices originated with our savage ancestors, and has been  inherited by us from them, with more or less of modification, through a  long line of intermediate generations.    [Sidenote: The need is all the more urgent because savages are rapidly  disappearing or being transformed.]    That is why the study of existing savages at the present day engrosses  so much of the attention of civilised peoples. We see that if we are to  comprehend not only our past history but our present condition, with all  its many intricate and perplexing problems, we must begin at the  beginning by attempting to discover the mental state of our savage  forefathers, who bequeathed to us so much of the faiths, the laws, and  the institutions which we still cherish; and more and more men are  coming to perceive that the only way open to us of doing this  effectually is to study the mental state of savages who to this day  occupy a state of culture analogous to that of our rude progenitors.  Through contact with civilisation these savages are now rapidly  disappearing, or at least losing the old habits and ideas which render  them a document of priceless historical value for us. Hence we have  every motive for prosecuting the study of savagery with ardour and  diligence before it is too late, before the record is gone for ever. We  are like an heir whose title-deeds must be scrutinised before he can  take possession of the inheritance, but who finds the handwriting of the  deeds so fading and evanescent that it threatens to disappear entirely  before he can read the document to the end. With what keen attention,  what eager haste, would he not scan the fast-vanishing characters? With  the like attention and the like haste civilised men are now applying  themselves to the investigation of the fast-vanishing savages.    [Sidenote: Savage religion is to be the subject of these lectures.]    Thus if we are to trace historically man's conception of God to its  origin, it is desirable, or rather essential, that we should begin by  studying the most primitive ideas on the subject which are accessible to  us, and the most primitive ideas are unquestionably those of the lowest  savages. Accordingly in these lectures I propose to deal with a  particular side or aspect of savage religion. I shall not trench on the  sphere of the higher religions, not only because my knowledge of them is  for the most part very slight, but also because I believe that a  searching study of the higher and more complex religions should be  postponed till we have acquired an accurate knowledge of the lower and  simpler. For a similar reason the study of inorganic chemistry naturally  precedes the study of organic chemistry, because inorganic compounds are  much simpler and therefore more easily analysed and investigated than  organic compounds. So with the chemistry of the mind; we should analyse  the comparatively simple phenomena of savage thought into its  constituent elements before we attempt to perform a similar operation on  the vastly more complex phenomena of civilised beliefs.    [Sidenote: But only a part of savage religion will be dealt with.]    But while I shall confine myself rigidly to the field of savage  religion, I shall not attempt to present you with a complete survey even  of that restricted area, and that for more reasons than one. In the  first place the theme, even with this great limitation, is far too large  to be adequately set forth in the time at my disposal; the sketch--for  it could be no more than a sketch--would be necessarily superficial and  probably misleading. In the second place, even a sketch of primitive  religion in general ought to presuppose in the sketcher a fairly  complete knowledge of the whole subject, so that all the parts may  appear, not indeed in detail, but in their proper relative proportions.  Now though I have given altogether a good deal of time to the study of  primitive religion, I am far from having studied it in all its branches,  and I could not trust myself to give an accurate general account of it  even in outline; were I to attempt such a thing I should almost  certainly fall, through sheer ignorance or inadvertence, into the  mistake of exaggerating some features, unduly diminishing others, and  omitting certain essential features altogether. Hence it seems to me  better not to commit myself to so ambitious an enterprise but to confine  myself in my lectures, as I have always done in my writings, to a  comparatively minute investigation of certain special aspects or forms  of primitive religion rather than attempt to embrace in a general view  the whole of that large subject. Such a relatively detailed study of a  single compartment may be less attractive and more tedious than a  bird's-eye view of a wider area; but in the end it may perhaps prove a  more solid contribution to knowledge.    [Sidenote: Introductory observations. The question of a supernatural  revelation excluded.]    But before I come to details I wish to make a few general introductory  remarks, and in particular to define some of the terms which I shall  have occasion to use in the lectures. I have defined natural theology as  that reasoned knowledge of a God or gods which man may be supposed,  whether rightly or wrongly, capable of attaining to by the exercise of  his natural faculties alone. Whether there ever has been or can be a  special miraculous revelation of God to man through channels different  from those through which all other human knowledge is derived, is a  question which does not concern us in these lectures; indeed it is  expressly excluded from their scope by the will of the founder, who  directed the lecturers to treat the subject \"as a strictly natural  science,\" \"without reference to or reliance upon any supposed special  exceptional or so-called miraculous revelation.\" Accordingly, in  compliance with these directions, I dismiss at the outset the question  of a revelation, and shall limit myself strictly to natural theology in  the sense in which I have defined it.    [Sidenote: Theology and religion, how related to each other.]    I have called natural theology a reasoned knowledge of a God or gods to  distinguish it from that simple and comparatively, though I believe  never absolutely, unreasoning faith in God which suffices for the  practice of religion. For theology is at once more and less than  religion: if on the one hand it includes a more complete acquaintance  with the grounds of religious belief than is essential to religion, on  the other hand it excludes the observance of those practical duties  which are indispensable to any religion worthy of the name. In short,  whereas theology is purely theoretical, religion is both theoretical and  practical, though the theoretical part of it need not be so highly  developed as in theology. But while the subject of the lectures is,  strictly speaking, natural theology rather than natural religion, I  think it would be not only difficult but undesirable to confine our  attention to the purely theological or theoretical part of natural  religion: in all religions, and not least in the undeveloped savage  religions with which we shall deal, theory and practice fuse with and  interact on each other too closely to be forcibly disjoined and handled  apart. Hence throughout the lectures I shall not scruple to refer  constantly to religious practice as well as to religious theory, without  feeling that thereby I am transgressing the proper limits of my subject.    [Sidenote: The term God defined.]    As theology is not only by definition but by etymology a reasoned  knowledge or theory of a God or gods, it becomes desirable, before we  proceed further, to define the sense in which I understand and shall  employ the word God. That sense is neither novel nor abstruse; it is  simply the sense which I believe the generality of mankind attach to the  term. By a God I understand a superhuman and supernatural being, of a  spiritual and personal nature, who controls the world or some part of it  on the whole for good, and who is endowed with intellectual faculties,  moral feelings, and active powers, which we can only conceive on the  analogy of human faculties, feelings, and activities, though we are  bound to suppose that in the divine nature they exist in higher degrees,  perhaps in infinitely higher degrees, than the corresponding faculties,  feelings, and activities of man. In short, by a God I mean a beneficent  supernatural spirit, the ruler of the world or of some part of it, who  resembles man in nature though he excels him in knowledge, goodness, and  power. This is, I think, the sense in which the ordinary man speaks of a  God, and I believe that he is right in so doing. I am aware that it has  been not unusual, especially perhaps of late years, to apply the name of  God to very"]]]
