ABANDONMENT IN MARINE INSURANCE is the surrender of the ship  or goods insured to the insurers, in the case of a constructive  total loss of the thing insured.  For the requisites and  effects of abandonment in this sense See INSURANCE, MARINE.    ABANDONMENT OF WIFE AND CHILDREN is dealt with under  DESERTION, and the abandonment or exposure of a  young child under the age of two, which is an indictable  misdemeanour, is dealt with under CHILDREN, CRUELTY TO.    ABANDONMENT OF DOMICILE is the ceasing to reside permanently  in a former domicile coupled with the intention of choosing a new  domicile.  The presumptions which will guide the court in deciding  whether a former domicile has been abandoned or not must be  inferred from the facts of each individual case.  See DOMICILE.    ABANDONMENT OF AN EASEMENT is the relinquishment of some  accommodation or right in another's land, such as right of  way, free access of light and air, &c. See EASEMENT.    ABANDONMENT OF RAILWAYS has a legal signification in England  recognized by statute, by authority of which the Board of  Trade may, under certain circumstances, grant a warrant to a  railway authorizing the abandonment of its line or part of it.    ABANO, PIETRO D, (1250-1316), known also as PETRUS DE  APONO or APONENSIS, Italian physician and philosopher,  was born at the Italian town from which he takes his name  in 1250, or, according to others, in 1246.  After studying  medicine and philosophy at Paris he settled at Padua, where  he speedily gained a great reputation as a physician, and  availed himself of it to gratify his avarice by refusing  to visit patients except for an exorbitant fee.  Perhaps  this, as well as his meddling with astrology, caused him to  be charged with practising magic, the particular accusations  being that he brought back into his purse, by the aid of the  devil, all the money he paid away, and that he possessed the  philosopher's stone.  He was twice brought to trial by the  Inquisition; on the first occasion he was acquitted, and he  died (1316) before the second trial was completed.  He was  found guilty, however, and his body was ordered to be exhumed  and burned; but a friend had secretly removed it, and the  Inquisition had, therefore, to content itself with the public  proclamation of its sentence and the burning of Abano in  effigy.  In his writings he expounds and advocates the medical  and philosophical systems of Averroes and other Arabian  writers.  His best known works are the Conciliator differentiarum  quae inter philosophos et medicos versantur (Mantua, 1472;  V.enice, 1476), and De venenis eorumque remediis (1472),  of which a French translation was published at Lyons in 1593.    ABANO BAGNI, a town of Venetia, Italy, in the province of  Padua, on the E. slope of the Monti Euganei; it is 6 m.  S.W.  by rail from Padua.  Pop. (1901) 4556.  Its hot springs and  mud baths are much resorted to, and were known to the Ronlans  as Aponi fons or Aquae Patavinae. Some remains of the  ancient baths have been discovered (S. Mandruzzato, Trattato  dei Bagni d' Abano, Padua, 1789).  An oracle of Geryon lay  near, and the so-called sortes Praenestinae (C.I.L. i.,  Berlin, 1863; 1438-1454), small bronze cylinders inscribed, and  used as oracles, were perhaps found here in the 16th century.    ABARIS, a Scythian or Hyperborean, priest and prophet  of Apollo, who is said to have visited Greece about 770  B.C., or two or three centuries later.  According to  the legend, he travelled throughout the country, living  without food and riding on a golden arrow, the gift of  the god; he healed the sick, foretold the future, worked  miracles, and delivered Sparta from a plague (Herod. iv. 36;  Iamblichus, De Fit. Pythag. xix. 28). Suidas credits him  with several works: Scythian oracles, the visit of Apollo to  the Hyperboreans, expiatory formulas and a prose theogony.    ABATED, an ancient technical term applied in masonry and  metal work to those portions which are sunk beneath the  surface, as in inscriptions where the ground is sunk round  the letters so as to leave the letters or ornament in relief.    ABATEMENT (derived through the French abattre, from the  Late Latin battere, to beat), a beating down or diminishing or  doing away with; a term used especially in various legal phrases.    ABATEMENT OF A NUISANCE is the remedy allowed by law to  a person or public authority injured by a public nuisance  of destroying or removing it, provided no breach of the  peace is committed in doing so.  In the case of private  nuisances abatement is also allowed provided there be no  breach of the peace, and no damage be occasioned beyond  what the removal of the nuisance requires. (See NUISANCE.)    ABATEMENT OF FREEHOLD takes place where, after the death of  the person last seised, a stranger enters upon lands before  the entry of the heir or devisee, and keeps the latter out of  possession.  It differs from intrusion, which is a similar  entry by a stranger on the death of a tenant for life, to  the prejudice of the reversioner, or remainder man; and from  disseisin, which is the forcible or fraudulent expulsion  of a person seised of the freehold. (See FREEHOLD.)    ABATEMENT OE DEBTS AND LEGACIES. When the equitable assets  (see ASSETS) of a deceased person are not sufficient to  satisfy fully all the creditors, their debts must abate  proportionately, and they must accept a dividend.  Also, in  the case of legacies when the funds or assets out of which  they are payable are not sufficient to pay them in full, the  legacies abate in proportion, unless there is a priority given  specially to any particular legacy (see LEGACY). Annuities  are also subject to the same rule as general legacies.      ABATEMENT IN PLEADING, or plea in abatement, was the  defeating or quashing of a particular action by some matter of  fact, such as a defect in form or the personal incompetency  of the parties suing, pleaded by the defendant.  It did not  involve the merits of the cause, but left the right of action  subsisting.  In criminal proceedings a plea in abatement was at  one time a common practice in answer to an indictment, and was  set up for the purpose of defeating the indictment as framed,  by alleging misnomer or other misdescription of the defendant.  Its effect for this purpose was nullified by the Criminal Law  Act 1826, which required the court to amend according to the  truth, and the Criminal Procedure Act 1851, which rendered  description of the defendant unnecessary.  All pleas in abatement  are now abolished (R.S.G.  Order 21, r. 20). See PLEADING.    ABATEMENT IN LITIGATION. In civil proceedings, no action  abates by reason of the marriage, death or bankruptcy of any  of the parties, if the cause of action survives or continues,  and does not become defective by the assignment, creation or  devolution of any estate or title pendente lite (R.S.C. Order  17, r. 1). Criminal proceedings do not abate on the death of  the prosecutor, being in theory instituted by the crown, but  the crown itself may bring about their termination without any  decision on the merits and without the assent of the prosecutor.    ABATEMENT OF FALSE LIGHTS. By the Merchant Shipping Act  1854, the general lighthouse authority (see LIGHTHOUSE) has  power to order the extinguishment or screening of any light  which may be mistaken for a light proceeding from a lighthouse.    ABATEMENT IN COMMERCE is a deduction sometimes made at a  custom-house from the fixed duties on certain kinds of goods, on  account of damage or loss sustained in warehouses.  The rate and  conditions of such deductions are regulated, in England, by the  Customs Consolidation Act 1853. (See also DRAWBACK; REBATE.)    ABATEMENT IN HERALDRY is a badge in coat-armour, indicating some  kind of degradation or dishonour.  It is called also rebatement.    ABATI, or DELL' ABBATO, NICCOLO (1512--1571), a celebrated  fresco-painter of Modena, whose best works are there and at  Bologna.  He accompanied Primaticcio to France, and assisted  in decorating the palace at Fontainebleau (1552--1571).  His  pictures exhibit a combination of skill in drawing, grace  and natural colouring.  Some of his easel pieces in oil are  in different collections; one of the finest, in the Dresden  Gallery, represents the martyrdom of St Peter and St Paul.    ABATIS,ABATTIS or ABBATTIS (a French word meaning  a heap of material thrown), a term in field fortification  for an obstacle formed of the branches of trees laid  in a row, with the tops directed towards the enemy and  interlaced or tied with wire.  The abatis is used alone or  in combination with wire-entanglements and other obstacles.    ABATTOIR (from abattre, to strike down), a French word often  employed in English as an equivalent of ``slaughter-house''  (q.v.), the place where animals intended for food are killed.    ABAUZIT, FIRMIN (1679-1767), a learned Frenchman, was born of  Protestant parents at Uzes, in Languedoc.  His father died when  he was but two years of age; and when, on the revocation of the  edict of Nantes in 1685, the authorities took steps to have him  educated in the Roman Catholic faith, his mother contrived his  escape.  For two years his brother and he lived as fugitives in  the mountains of the Cevennes, but they at last reached Geneva,  where their mother afterwards joined them on escaping from  the imprisonment in which she was held from the time of their  flight.  Abauzit at an early age acquired great proficiency in  languages, physics and theology.  In 1698 he went to Holland,  and there became acquainted with Pierre Bayle, P. Jurieu and J.  Basnage.  Proceeding to England, he was introduced to Sir Isaac  Newton, who found in him one of the earliest defenders of his  discoveries.  Sir Isaac corrected in the second edition of  his Principia an error pointed out by Abauzit, and, when"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20014"],[0,"Canada and the Canadians, Vol. 1 (#6)"],[1,"as possible,  and shall not confine myself to studied rules or endeavours to make a  book, taking up my subject as suits my own leisure, which is not very  ample, and resuming or interrupting it at pleasure or convenience.    It will be necessary to enter more at large than in my preceding volumes  into the resources of Canada, and, for this end, Geology and other  scientific subjects must be introduced; but, as I dislike exceedingly  that heavy and gaudy veil of learning, that embroidered science, with  which modern taste conceals those secrets of Nature which have been so  partially unfolded, I shall not have frequent recourse to absurd Greek  derivations, which are very commonly borrowed for the occasion from  technical dictionaries, or lent by a classical friend; but, whenever  they must occur, the dictionary shall explain them, for I really think  it beneath the dignity of the lights of modern Geology to talk as they  do about the Placoids and the Ganoids, as the first created fishlike  beings, and of the Ctenoids and the Cycloids as the more recent finners.  It always puts me in mind of Shakespeare's magniloquence concerning \"the  Anthropophagi and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders, of  antres vast and deserts idle,\" when he exhibited his learning in  language which no one, however, can imitate, and which he makes the lady  seriously incline and listen to, simply because she did not understand a  word that was said. So it is with the overdone and continual changing of  terms that now constantly occurs; insomuch that the terms of plain  science, instead of being simplified and brought within the reach of  ordinary capacities, is made as uncouth and as unintelligible as  possible, and totally beyond the reach of those who have no collegiate  education to boast of, and no good technical dictionary at hand to refer  to.    The present age is most prone to this false estimate of learning and to  public scientific display. If science, true science, yields to it,  learning will very soon vanish from the face of the earth again, and  nothing but monkish lore and the dark ages return.    There is a vast field open for research in Canada: it is yet a virgin  soil, both as respects its moral and its physical cultivation.  Therefore, plain facts are the best, and those made as level to the eye  as possible; for the amusing mistakes which a would-be learned man  makes, after a cursory perusal of anything scientific, only subject him  to silent derision.    A very old casual acquaintance of mine, a sort of man holding a rather  elevated rank, but originally from the great unwashed, who had risen by  mere chance, aided by a little borough influence, was talking to me one  day about some property of his in Western Canada, which he fancied had  rich minerals upon it. Accordingly, he had taken a preliminary Treatise  on Mineralogy in hand, and puzzled his brains in order to converse  learnedly. \"My land,\" quoth he, \"is Silesia, and has a great bed of  sulphuret of pyrites.\" The poor gentleman, who had a vast opinion of  himself and always contradicted everybody about everything, meant that  his soil contained a deal of silica, and that iron pyrites was abundant  in it.    The importance of the annual migration from Britain is best evidenced by  the representation of the chief emigrant agent at Quebec, subjoined.    In all the great sea-ports of England, Ireland, and Scotland, there are  emigrant agents appointed by the government, to whom application should  always be made for information, by every emigrant who has not the  advantage of friends in Canada to receive and guide him; and these  gentlemen prevent the trouble, expense, loss of time, and fraud, to  which the poor settlers are subjected by the crimps and agents, with  whom every sea-port abounds.    On their arrival in Canada, if ignorant of their way, they should apply  at Quebec to the government principal agent, who is stationed there for  the lower or eastern part of Canada, and he will give them either advice  or passage, according to the nature of the case.    It is a pity that a rage exists for going as far west as possible at  first, for this rage causes distress, and ends frequently by their being  kidnapped into settling in the United States.    If, however, they are determined to go on to Western Canada, their  course is either to pay their own way, or to obtain assistance from the  government to send them on to Kingston, where another government agent  for Western Canada is stationed; and, as this gentleman has now acted in  that capacity for many years, he possesses a perfect knowledge of the  country and its resources, and of the wants and objects of the  settlers.    There is excellent land, and plenty of it to be obtained from the  British American Land Company in Lower Canada, in that portion called  \"The Townships,\" which adjoin the states of Vermont and New York; and,  excepting that the winters are longer, the climate more severe, it is as  desirable as any other part of the province, and, in point of health,  perhaps more so, as it is sufficiently far from the great river and  lakes to make it less subject to ague; which, however, more or less, all  new countries in the temperate zone, well forested and watered, are  invariably the seat of, and which is increased in power and frequency in  proportion to the neighbourhood of fresh water in large bodies, and the  use of whiskey as a preventive.    From a statement of the number of emigrants to this colony for the last  sixteen years, compiled by A.C. Buchanan, Esq., chief emigrant agent, it  appears that, in the five years subsequently to 1829, the emigration  from the British Isles was 165,793. From other sources, in the three  years, from 1829 to 1832, the emigration exceeded that of the previous  ten years--the numbers being respectively, 125,063 and 121,170. In 1832,  the emigrants arrived reached the high number of 51,746; but the cholera  of that year was of so fatal a character on the St. Lawrence, that the  numbers in 1833 fell 22,062. This epidemic, coupled with the rebellions  of '37 and '38, materially checked the increased emigration commenced in  1836. In 1838, the number was only 3,266, and in 1839, 7,500. But, since  1840, emigration has again recovered, and, during the period of  navigation of 1845, it amounted to 27,354, of whom 2,612 arrived _via_  the United States.    The United States, however, received by far the largest proportion of  the emigration from Britain. At the port of New York alone, from 1st  November, 1844, to 31st October, 1845, there arrived--    From England and Scotland         10,653  From Ireland                      38,300                                   -------  Total at New York                 48,953    The number of emigrants landed at the port of Quebec, in 1845, was  25,375.    +----------------------------------------------------------------------+  |             NUMBER OF EMIGRANTS SINCE 1829.                          |  |----------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+---------|  |                |'29 to '33|'34 to '38|'39 to '43|'44 to '45| Total.  |  |                |          |          |          |          |         |  |                |----------|----------|----------|----------|---------|  |England.        |  43,386  | 28,624   |  30,318  | 16,531   | 119,354 |  |Ireland.        | 102,264  | 54,898   |  74,981  | 24,201   | 256,344 |  |Scotland.       |  20,143  | 10,998   |  16,289  |  4,408   |  51,838 |  |British American|          |          |          |          |         |  |  Prov. &c.     |   1,904  |  1,831   |   1,777  |    377   |   5,589 |  |                |----------+----------+----------+----------+---------|  |                | 167,697  | 96,351   | 123,860  | 45,517   | 433,425 |  +----------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+---------+    Upper Canada would seem to have received the largest share of the influx  of population. The increase in the number of its inhabitants, between  1827 and 1843, is stated at 230,000.    The local government has for some few years past encouraged, although  rather scantily, as Mr. Logan can, I dare say, testify, an exploration  of the natural resources of the Canadas, as far as geology and  mineralogy are concerned. Its medical statistics, its botany and  zoology, will follow; and agriculture, that primary and most noble of  all applications of the mind to matter, is making rapid strides, by the  formation of district and local societies, which will do infinitely more  good than any system of government patronage for the advancement of the  welfare of the people could devise.    The public works have also, for the first time, been placed under the  control of the executive and legislative bodies by the formation of a  board, which is itself also subject to the supervision of the  government.    But much remains to be done on this important head. A melancholy error  was committed in making the President, and consequently all the officers  and _employes_, of the Board of Works, partizans of the ministry of the  day; thus paralyzing the efforts of a zealous man, on the one hand, by  the fear of dismissal upon any change of the popular will, and  neutralizing his efforts whilst in office, by rendering his measures  mere jobs.    This has been amended under Lord Metcalfe's administration; and it is to  be hoped that the office of President of the Board of Works will  hereafter be one subjected to severe but not to vexatious scrutiny, and  at the same time carefully guarded against political influence, and only  rendered tenable with honour by the capacity of the person selected to  fill it and of his subordinates. Canada is, as I have written two former  volumes to prove, a magnificent country. I doubt very much if Nature has  created a finer country on the whole earth.
