Chapter VI      The police search of the house and grounds at Dulwich Grange, Mr.  Rennett's residence, occupied the whole of the morning, and neither  Rennett's nor Jack's assistance was invited or offered.    Before luncheon Inspector Colhead came to the study.    \"We've had a good look round your place, Mr. Rennett,\" he said, \"and I  think we know where the deceased hid himself.\"    \"Indeed!\" said Mr. Rennett.    \"That hut of yours in the garden is used, I suppose, for a tool house.  There are no tools there now, and one of my men discovered that you can  pull up the whole of the floor, it works on a hinge and is balanced with  counter-weights.\"    Mr. Rennett nodded.    \"I believe it was used as a wine cellar by a former tenant of the  house,\" he said coolly. \"We have no cellars at the Grange, you know. I  do not drink wine, and I've never had occasion to use it.\"    \"That's where he was hidden. We found a blanket, and pillows, down  there, and, as you say, it has obviously been a wine cellar, because  there is a ventilating shaft leading up into the bushes. We should never  have found the trap, but one of my men felt one of the corners of the  floor give under his feet.\"    The two men said nothing.    \"Another thing,\" the detective went on slowly, \"is that I'm inclined to  agree that Meredith did not commit suicide. We found footmarks, quite  fresh, leading round to the back of the hut.\"    \"A big foot or a little foot?\" asked Jack quickly.    \"It is rather a big foot,\" said the detective, \"and it has rubber heels.  We traced it to a gate at the back of your premises, and the gate has  been opened recently--probably by Mr. Meredith when he came to the  house. It's a queer case, Mr. Rennett.\"    \"What is the pistol?\"    \"That's new too,\" said Colhead. \"Belgian make and impossible to trace, I  should imagine. You can't keep track of these Belgian weapons. You can  buy them in any shop in any town in Ostend or Brussels, and I don't  think it is the practice for the sellers to keep any record of the  numbers.\"    \"In fact,\" said Jack quietly, \"it is the same kind of pistol that killed  Bulford.\"    Colhead raised his eyebrows.    \"So it was, but wasn't it established that that was Mr. Meredith's own  weapon?\"    Jack shook his head.    \"The only thing that was established was that he had seen the body and  he picked up the pistol which was lying near the dead man. The shot was  fired as he opened the door of Mr. Briggerland's house. Then he saw the  figure on the pavement and picked up the pistol. He was in that position  when Miss Briggerland, who testified against him, came out of the house  and saw him.\"    The detective nodded.    \"I had nothing to do with the case,\" he said, \"but I remember seeing the  weapon, and it was identical with this. I'll talk to the chief and let  you know what he says about the whole affair. You'll have to give  evidence at the inquest of course.\"    When he had gone the two men looked at one another.    \"Well, Rennett, do you think we're going to get into hot water, or are  we going to perjure our way to safety?\"    \"There's no need for perjury, not serious perjury,\" said the other  carefully. \"By the way, Jack, where was Briggerland the night Bulford  was murdered?\"    \"When Miss Jean Briggerland had recovered from her horror, she went  upstairs and aroused her father, who, despite the early hour, was in  bed and asleep. When the police came, or rather, when the detective in  charge of the case arrived, which must have been some time after the  policeman on point duty put in an appearance, Mr. Briggerland was  discovered in a picturesque dressing gown and, I presume, no less  picturesque pyjamas.\"    \"Horrified, too, I suppose,\" said Rennett dryly.    Jack was silent for a long time. Then: \"Rennett,\" he said, \"do you know  I am more rattled about this girl than I am about any consequences to  ourselves.\"    \"Which girl are you talking about?\"    \"About Mrs. Meredith. Whilst poor Meredith was alive she was in no  particular danger. But do you realise that what were advantages from our  point of view, namely, the fact that she had no relations in the world,  are to-day a source of considerable peril to this unfortunate lady?\"    \"I had forgotten that,\" said Rennett thoughtfully. \"What makes matters a  little more complicated, is the will which Meredith made this morning  before he was married.\"    Jack whistled.    \"Did he make a will?\" he said in surprise.    His partner nodded.    \"You remember he was here with me for half an hour. Well, he insisted  upon writing out a will and my wife and Bolton, the butler, witnessed  it.\"    \"And he has left his money----?\"    \"To his wife absolutely,\" replied the other. \"The poor old chap was so  frantically keen on keeping the money out of the Briggerland exchequer,  that he was prepared to entrust the whole of his money to a girl he had  not seen.\"    Jack was serious now.    \"And the Briggerlands are her heirs? Do you realise that,  Rennett--there's going to be hell!\"    Mr. Rennett nodded.    \"I thought that too,\" he said quietly.    Jack sank down in a seat, his face screwed up into a hideous frown, and  the elder man did not interrupt his thoughts. Suddenly Jack's face  cleared and he smiled.    \"Jaggs!\" he said softly.    \"Jaggs?\" repeated his puzzled partner.    \"Jaggs,\" said Jack, nodding, \"he's the fellow. We've got to meet  strategy with strategy, Rennett, and Jaggs is the boy to do it.\"    Mr. Rennett looked at him helplessly.    \"Could Jaggs get us out of our trouble too?\" he asked sarcastically.    \"He could even do that,\" replied Jack.    \"Then bring him along, for I have an idea he'll have the time of his  life.\"          Chapter VII      Miss Jean Briggerland reached her home in Berkeley Street soon after  nine o'clock. She did not ring, but let herself in with a key and went  straight to the dining-room, where her father sat eating his breakfast,  with a newspaper propped up before him.    He was the dark-skinned man whom Lydia had seen at the theatre, and he  looked up over his gold-rimmed spectacles as the girl came in.    \"You have been out very early,\" he said.    She did not reply, but slowly divesting herself of her sable coat she  threw it on to a chair, took off the toque that graced her shapely head,  and flung it after the coat. Then she drew out a chair, and sat down at  the table, her chin on her palms, her blue eyes fixed upon her parent.    Nature had so favoured her that her face needed no artificial  embellishment--the skin was clear and fine of texture, and the cold  morning had brought only a faint pink to the beautiful face.    \"Well, my dear,\" Mr. Briggerland looked up and beamed through his  glasses, \"so poor Meredith has committed suicide?\"    She did not speak, keeping her eyes fixed on him.    \"Very sad, very sad,\" Mr. Briggerland shook his head.    \"How did it happen?\" she asked quietly.    Mr. Briggerland shrugged his shoulders.    \"I suppose at the sight of you he bolted back to his hiding place  where--er--had been located by--er--interested persons during the night,  then seeing me by the shed--he committed the rash and fatal act. Somehow  I thought he would run back to his dug-out.\"    \"And you were prepared for him?\" she said.    He smiled.    \"A clear case of suicide, my dear,\" he said.    \"Shot through the left temple, and the pistol was found in his right  hand,\" said the girl.    Mr. Briggerland started.    \"Damn it,\" he said. \"Who noticed that?\"    \"That good-looking young lawyer, Glover.\"    \"Did the police notice?\"    \"I suppose they did when Glover called their attention to the fact,\"  said the girl.    Mr. Briggerland took off his glasses and wiped them.    \"It was done in such a hurry--I had to get back through the garden gate  to join the police. When I got there, I found they'd been attracted by  the shot and had entered the house. Still, nobody would know I was in  the garden, and anyway my association with the capture of an escaped  convict would not get into the newspapers.\"    \"But a case of suicide would,\" said the girl. \"Though I don't suppose  the police will give away the person who informed them that James  Meredith would be at Dulwich Grange.\"    Mr. Briggerland sat back in his chair, his thick lips pursed, and he was  not a beautiful sight.    \"One can't remember everything,\" he grumbled.    He rose from his chair, went to the door, and locked it. Then he crossed  to a bureau, pulled open a drawer and took out a small revolver. He  threw out the cylinder, glanced along the barrel and the chambers to  make sure it was not loaded, then clicked it back in position, and  standing before a glass, he endeavoured, the pistol in his right hand,  to bring the muzzle to bear on his left temple. He found this  impossible, and signified his annoyance with a grunt. Then he tried the  pistol with his thumb on the trigger and his hand clasping the back of  the butt. Here he was more successful.    \"That's it,\" he said with satisfaction. \"It could have been done that  way.\"    She did not shudder at the dreadful sight, but watched him with the  keenest interest, her chin still in the palm of her hand. He might have  been explaining a new way of serving a tennis ball, for all the emotion  he evoked.    Mr. Briggerland came back to the table, toyed with a piece of toast and  buttered it leisurely.    \"Everybody is going to Cannes this year,\" he said, \"but I think I shall  stick to Monte Carlo. There is a quiet about Monte Carlo which is very  restful, especially if one can get a villa on the hill away from the  railway. I told Morden yesterday to take the new car across and meet us  at Boulogne. He says that the new body is exquisite.

(#6)"],[1,"g. 101 is the end view of a \"Double-dovetailed, tongued and grooved\"  joint, and Fig. 102 is a sketch of a similar joint having only one  dovetailed tongue.    From a constructional point of view Fig. 101 is far and away the best  joint that has yet been produced. Unfortunately, however, there is not at  the present time any hand tool that will economically produce it, owing  probably to the fact that the joint is the subject of a patent. The  dovetail tongue tapers slightly throughout its entire length, gripping  the joint on the principle of the wedge and squeezing the glue into the  pores of the wood.    [Illustration: Fig. 102.--Joint with Single Dovetail Tongue and Groove.]    [Illustration: Fig. 103.--(A) Cross Tongue. (B) Feather Tongue.]    [Illustration: Fig. 104.--Method of Secret-nailing Hardwood Flooring  Boards.]    CABINET-WORK JOINTS.--With regard to tongued and grooved joints which  apply more particularly to the jointing of cabinet work, Fig. 93 is  produced by planes which are specially made for the purpose. One plane  makes the tongue and another the groove. The handiest sizes to buy are  those which joint 3/8 in., 5/8 in., and 3/4 in. timber, it being usual to  dowel or loose-tongue thicker boards. The 3/8 in. partitions (or, as they  are sometimes called, dustboards) between the drawers of a sideboard or  dressing chest are in good work jointed in this manner. The 5/8 in. and  3/4 in. ends and tops of pine or American whitewood dressing tables,  wardrobes, etc., call for the larger sized plane.    LOOSE TONGUES.--There are two methods of jointing with loose tongues,  viz., the use of the cross tongue, Fig. 103 A, and the use of the feather  tongue, Fig. 103 B. Cross tongues are the stronger when glued in their  position and can be used very much thinner than feather tongues. Feather  tongues are cut diagonally across the grain as illustrated.    [Illustration: Fig. 105.--Cradle for Planing.]    Fig. 105 is a cradle for planing up loose tongues to the required width  (generally 7/8 in.). Two grooves are made in a piece of 1-1/4 in.  hardwood; one groove is used for planing the width way of the tongue and  the other for planing the edge way. These tongues can be cut to accurate  size on a circular saw bench if power and machinery are at hand.    APPLICATIONS OF THE JOINT.--Fig. 106 is a sketch of a portion of a  sideboard top, showing the plough groove ready worked out to receive the  tongue; the other half of the top is treated in a similar manner. It will  be noticed that the groove is not worked through the full length of the  board, but stopped about 1-1/4 in. from each end; this leaves a square  joint at each end of the top on which the moulding is worked. If the  groove be run through the board it looks very unsightly when the mould is  finished.    Fig. 107 is a shaped spandrel, such as is fixed in the recess of a  sideboard or cupboard or shop window fitment. It is of such a width that,  were it cut from a wide board, the shaped portion would be apt to break  off owing to the short grain at C. The shaping is therefore built up out  of three separate pieces, the grain running as indicated. The loose  tongue is represented by the dotted line and a section is shown of the  joint at the line A B. At the opposite corner the tongue is left blind,  _i.e._, not run through the edge. This is the method that should be used  when the shaping is above the level of the eye.    [Illustration: Fig. 106.--Part of Sideboard Top; grooved with ends left  blind. (The boards are shown upright.)]    [Illustration: Fig. 107.--Shaped Spandrel for Recess.]    Fig. 108 shows part of a carcase of a dressing table. The drawer runner A  is shown grooved across the end to receive a cross tongue; this cross  tongue engages a similar groove in the front bearer. This method of  fastening the runner to the bearer is in everyday use.    [Illustration: Fig. 108.--Part Carcase of Dressing Table.]    [Illustration: Fig. 109.--Framed Writing Table Top.]    Fig. 109 is a writing table top. The centre boards are first jointed and  glued up, after which the ends and sides are grooved ready to receive the  cross tongues. The hardwood margins are shown at one end and at the  front, and the grooves are arranged so that, on completion, the marginal  frame stands above the top just the amount of the thickness of the  leather which will cover the table. In some cases the margin at the end  runs the same way of the grain as the top, thus allowing for slight  shrinkage. Cross tongues would of course be used in this case.    Fig. 110 is a sketch showing one-quarter of a barred or tracery cabinet  door. An enlarged section of the astragal mould which is grooved to fit  on the bar which forms the rebate is also shown.    Fig. 111 is a \"Combing or corner locking\" joint, a method of making boxes  by means of a continuous use of tongues and grooves instead of dovetails.  This type of joint is generally machine made. The amateur, however, who  is not proficient to undertake a dovetailed box frequently uses this  method.    [Illustration: Fig. 110.--Corner of Barred Door.]    [Illustration: Fig. 111.--Combing or Locking Joint.]    [Illustration: Fig. 112.--Single Loose Tongue and Double-tongue Joint.]    CORNER JOINTS.--Fig. 112 shows both a single loose tongue and a double  solid tongue. Both are methods used to connect circular cornered work,  such as a counter end, to the front framing.    Fig. 113 indicates a tongued and grooved joint suitable for edge or end  jointing, such as fitting matchboarding round a chimney breast, making  small jewel drawers, etc.    Fig. 114 is a tongued and grooved joint with a bead worked on same to  hide the joint, sometimes called a staff-bead. It would be used in  positions such as boarding around an upright iron pillar, etc., the bead  giving a neat finish at each corner.    Fig. 115 is a similar joint, but at an obtuse angle. An example of its  use is in fixing boarding around an octagonal column of brickwork.    [Illustration: Fig. 113., Fig. 114., Fig. 115. Examples of  Tongued and Grooved Corner Joints.]    Fig. 116 shows a tongued and grooved mitre as used for strengthening the  corners of cabinet work, such as tea caddies, small boxes, plinths, etc.  Two pieces of wood are glued in position and allowed to set prior to  glueing and cramping the joint proper. These pieces are afterwards planed  away, thus leaving a clear surface to the box sides.    Fig. 117 shows the method of working the groove in the above joints. The  pieces are turned back to back, the mitres thus making a right angle. The  guide on the grooving plane thus works against each face of the joint,  and this ensures correct jointing.    Fig. 118 is somewhat similar to Fig. 113, but with a quarter circle mould  to hide the joint.    Fig. 119 indicates the building up of a double skirting mould. C  represents the brickwork, A the oak-framed panelling, and B the packing  and fixing block. A wide skirting of this type is made in two portions  for convenience in working the moulding and to prevent undue shrinkage.    [Illustration: Fig. 116.--Cramping a Tongued and Grooved Mitre.]    [Illustration: Fig. 117.--Working a Groove.]    [Illustration: Fig. 118.--Corner Joint with Corner Mould.]    Fig. 120 illustrates the use of a tongued and grooved joint for fixing  together the sides of a corner bracket, and the same method holds good  when jointing a corner cupboard. A capping mould or top shelf will  conceal the joint; it then has the appearance of a glued butt joint, but  is of course considerably stronger. No screws or nails are required if  this joint be used.    PLOUGHING.--When grooves have to be worked in the edge or face of a board  to receive tongues, the process is generally called ploughing, and it is  usually accomplished by a special tool called a plough (or, as it is  occasionally spelt, \"plow\"). When a plough plane is bought it is usual to  procure eight plough bits or blades of various sizes to fit the plane. In  Fig. 121 is given the sketch of a plough plane with the names of the  various parts lettered thereon.    [Illustration: Fig. 119.--Double Skirting Mould.]    [Illustration: Fig. 120.--Joint for Corner Bracket or Cupboard.]    The board or boards which it is desired to groove are first planed  straight and true, exactly as though it were desired to make a glued or  butt joint. One of the boards is now placed edge way up in the vice and  with the face side to the worker.    Take the plough plane and select a suitably-sized blade; fix it in the  plane in the usual way, allowing the cutting edge to project beyond the  steel skate about 1/32 in., and securely drive up the wedge. Next loosen  the small boxwood wedges at the side of each stem, and adjust the plane  by tapping the stems with a hammer until the cutting iron is in the  desired position; then knock up the small wedges nice and tight. When  setting the fence to or from the blade it is a wise precaution to measure  the distance from the fence to the skate at each end of the plane; this  will ensure the skate being parallel to the fence. The neglect of this is  a source of annoyance to many amateurs. Now adjust the depth stop by  turning the screw at the top of the plane, measuring the depth of the  required groove from the edge of the blade to the stop, and carefully  lock the screw which adjusts this stop.    [Illustration: Fig. 121.--The Plough Plane and its Parts.]    The plane is now ready for use. Hold the fence close up to the side of  the timber, the hands in position as shown at Fig. 122, the position of  the body being that generally assumed in planing. Move the plane  backwards and forwards in the usual manner, beginning the cut at the end  of the board nearest to the vice jaws (the front), and proceed with the  planing until the depth stop is in contact with the wood. Then take a  step backwards and repeat the process until the whole length of the"]]]
