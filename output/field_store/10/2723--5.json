Freddie's radishes were above ground now, and growing nicely, but they  thought it best not to tell him, as he might pull them up too soon. Nan  and Flossie weeded his garden as well as their own and showed they  loved to see things grow, for they did not mind the work of attending  to them.    \"Papa will come up from Lakeport to-night,\" Nan told Flossie; \"and  won't he be pleased to see our gardens!\"    That evening when Mr. Bobbsey arrived the first thing he had to do was  to visit the garden.    \"Why, I declare!\" he exclaimed in real surprise. \"You have done  splendidly. This is a fine lettuce patch.\"    Mrs. Bobbsey and Aunt Sarah had also come up to see the girls' garden,  and they too were much surprised at the result of Nan's and Flossie's  work.    \"Oh!\" screamed Freddie from the other side of the garden. \"See my  redishes! They growed!\" and before anyone could stop him he pulled up a  whole handful of the little green leaves with the tiny red balls on the  roots.    \"They growed! They growed!\" he shouted, dancing around in delight.    \"But you must only pick the ripe ones,\" his father told him. \"And did  you really plant them?\" Mr. Bobbsey asked in surprise.    \"Yep! John showed me,\" he declared, and the girls said that was really  Freddie's garden.    \"Now I'll tell you,\" Aunt Sarah remarked. \"We will let our little  farmers pick their vegetables for dinner, and then we will be able to  say just how good they are.\"    At this the girls started in to pick the very biggest heads of lettuce,  and Freddie looked carefully to get the very reddest radishes in his  patch. Finally enough were gathered, and down to the kitchen the  vegetables were carried.    \"You will have to prepare them for the table,\" Mrs. Bobbsey said. \"Let  us see, girls, what a pretty dish you can make.\"    This was a pleasant task to Nan and Flossie, who both always loved to  play at housekeeping, and when at last Nan brought the dish in to the  dinner table everybody said how pretty it looked.    \"Them's my redishes!\" exclaimed Freddie, as he saw the pretty bright  red buttons peeping out from between the lettuce leaves.    \"But we can all have some, can't we, Freddie?\" his father asked.    \"Yes, 'course you can. But I don't want all my good redishes smothered  in that big dish of green stuff,\" he pouted.    \"Now, Nan, you can serve your vegetables,\" Aunt Sarah said, and then  Nan very neatly put a few crisp lettuce leaves on each small plate, and  at the side she placed a few of Freddie's radishes, \"with handles on\"  as Dinah said, meaning the little green stalks.    \"Just think, we've done it all from the garden to the table!\" Nan  exclaimed, justly proud of her success at gardening.    \"I done the radishes,\" put in Freddie, gulping down a drink of water to  wash the bite off his tongue, for his radishes were quite hot.    \"Well, you have certainly all done very nicely,\" Mrs. Bobbsey said.  \"And that kind of play is like going to school, for it teaches you  important lessons in nature.\"    The girls declared they were going to keep a garden all summer, and so  they did.    It was an unusually warm night, and so nearly all the doors were left  open when the folks went to bed. Freddie was so worked up over his  success as a gardener he could not go to sleep.    At last he dozed off, but presently he awoke with a start. What was  that strange sound ringing in his ears? He sat up and listened.    Yes, somebody must surely be playing the piano. But what funny music!  It seemed to come in funny runs and curious thumps. He called out  sharply, and his mother came at once to his side.    \"I heard piano-playing,\" said Freddie, and Mrs. Bobbsey started, for  she remembered how Flossie had once told her the same thing.    \"Oh, Freddie, are you sure?\" she asked.    \"Sure,\" repeated the little fellow. \"But it wasn't very good playing.\"    Mrs. Bobbsey called Uncle Daniel, and the latter lit a lamp and went  below into the parlor. Nobody was at the piano or in the room.    \"I've made a careful examination,\" he said, on coming back. \"I can see  nothing unusual. Some of the children left a piece of cake on the keys  of the piano, that's all.\"    \"Well, cake can't play,\" put in Freddie. \"Maybe it was a ghost.\"    \"No, you must have been dreaming,\" said his mother. \"Come, go to  sleep,\" and presently Freddie dropped off. Mrs. Bobbsey was much  worried, and the next day the older folks talked the matter over; but  nothing came of it.        CHAPTER XII    TOM'S RUNAWAY    \"Tom Mason is going to bring his colt out this afternoon,\" said Harry  to Bert, \"and we can all take turns trying him.\"    \"Oh, is it that pretty little brown horse I saw in the field back of  Tom's home?\" asked Bert.    \"That's him,\" Harry replied. \"Isn't he a beauty!\"    \"Yes, I would like first-rate to ride him, but young horses are awful  skittish, aren't they?\"    \"Sometimes, but this one is partly broken. At any rate, we wouldn't  have far to fall, for he is a little fellow,\" said Harry.    So the boys went down to Tom's home at the appointed time, and there  they met Jack Hopkins.    \"We've made a track around the fields,\" Tom told his companions, \"and  we will train him to run around the ring, for father thinks he may be a  race-horse some day, he's so swift.\"    \"You may go first,\" the boys told him, \"as he's your horse.\"    \"All right!\" Tom replied, making for the stake where Sable, the pony,  was tied. Sable marched along quietly enough and made no objections to  Tom getting on his back. There was no saddle, but just the bit in the  horse's mouth and attached to it a short piece of rein.    \"Get app, Sable!\" called Tom, snapping a small whip at the pony's side.    But instead of going forward the little horse tried to sit down!    \"Whoa! whoa!\" called the boys, but Tom clung to Sable's neck and held  on in spite of the pony's back being like a toboggan slide.    \"Get off there, get off there!\" urged Tom, yet the funny little animal  only backed down more.    \"Light a match and set it under his nose,\" Harry suggested. \"That's the  way to make a balky horse go!\"    Someone had a match, which was lighted and put where Sable could sniff  the sulphur.    \"Look out! Hold on, Tom!\" yelled the boys all at once, for at that  instant Sable bolted off like a deer.    \"He's running away!\" called Bert, which was plain to be seen, for Tom  could neither turn him this way or that, but had all he could do to  hold on the frightened animal's neck.    \"If he throws him Tom will surely be hurt!\" Harry exclaimed, and the  boys ran as fast as they could across the field after the runaway.    \"Whoa! whoa! whoa!\" called everybody after the horse, but that made not  the slightest difference to Sable, who just went as if the woods were  afire. Suddenly he turned and dashed straight up a big hill and over  into a neighbor's cornfield.    \"Oh, mercy!\" cried Harry, \"those people are so mean about their garden,  they'll have Tom arrested if there's any corn broken.\"    Of course it was impossible for a runaway horse to go through a field  of corn and do no damage, and Tom realized this too. By this time the  dogs were out barking furiously, and altogether there was wild  excitement. At one end of the field there was a high board fence.    \"If I could only get him there he would have to stop,\" thought Tom, and  suddenly he gave Sable a jerk in that direction.    \"Drop off, Tom, drop off!\" yelled the boys. \"He'll throw you against  the fence!\"    But at that minute the little horse threw himself against the boards in  such a way that Tom slid off, yet held tightly to the reins.    The horse fell, quite exhausted.    As quickly as they could get there the boys came up to help Tom.    \"Hurry!\" said Harry, \"there is scarcely any corn broken, and we can get  away before the Trimbles see us. They're away back in the fields  planting late cabbage.\"    Tom felt hardly able to walk, but he limped along while Harry led Sable  carefully between the cornhills. It was only a few feet to the edge of  the field, and then they were all safe on the road again.    \"Are you hurt?\" the boys asked Tom, when finally they had a chance to  speak about the runaway.    \"I feel as if I had dropped from a balloon onto a lot of cobblestones,\"  Tom answered, \"but I guess that's only the shaking up I got. That pony  certainly can go.\"    \"Yes indeed,\" Harry admitted; \"I guess he doesn't like the smell of  sulphur matches. Lucky he was not injured with that fall against the  fence.\"    \"I found I had to throw him,\" Tom said, \"and I thought the fence was  softer than a tree.\"    \"I suppose we ought to make him run until he is played out,\" said Bert,  \"That's the way to cure a horse of running away.\"    But none of the boys felt like risking their bones even to cure Sable,  so the panting animal was led to the stable and for the rest of the day  allowed to think over his bad conduct.    But that was not the last of the runaway, for in the evening just after  supper old Mr. Trimble paid a visit to Tom's father.    \"I came over to tell you what a scallywag of a boy you've got,\" began  the cross old man. \"He and a lot of young loafers took a horse and  drove him all through my cornfield to-day, and now you've got to pay  the damages.\"    \"My son is not a scallywag,\" Mr. Mason declared, \"and if you call him  names like loafer and scallywag I'll make you pay damages.\"    \"Oh! you will, eh?\" the other sneered. \"Think I'm afraid of an old  constable up here, do you?\"    \"Well now, see here,\" Mr. Mason said, \"Be reasonable and do not quarrel  over an accident. If any corn is knocked down I'll get Tom to fix it  up, if it's broken down we will see what it would cost to replace it.  But the boys did not do it purposely, and it was worse for Tom than  anyone else, for he's all black and blue from the hard knocks he got.\"    At this the cross man quieted down and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7140"],[0,"The Great Conspiracy, Complete (#10)"],[1,"South Carolina  during the previous year to oppose it, by memorials and otherwise, and  stating that, despite their \"remonstrances and implorations,\" a Tariff  Bill had passed, not indeed, such as they apprehended, but \"ten-fold  worse in all its oppressive features,\" proceeded thus:    \"From the rapid step of usurpation, whether we now act or not, the day  of open opposition to the pretended powers of the Constitution cannot be  far off, and it is that it may not go down in blood that we now call  upon you to resist.  We feel ourselves standing underneath its mighty  protection, and declaring forth its free and recorded spirit, when we  say we must resist.  By all the great principles of liberty--by the  glorious achievements of our fathers in defending them--by their noble  blood poured forth like water in maintaining them--by their lives in  suffering, and their death in honor and in glory;--our countrymen! we  must resist.  Not secretly, as timid thieves or skulking smugglers--not  in companies and associations, like money chafferers or stock jobbers  --not separately and individually, as if this was ours and not our  country's cause--but openly, fairly, fearlessly, and unitedly, as  becomes a free, sovereign and independent people.  Does timidity ask  WHEN?  We answer NOW!\"    These inflammatory utterances, in South Carolina especially, stirred the  Southern heart more or less throughout the whole cotton belt; and the  pernicious principles which they embodied found ardent advocates even in  the Halls of Congress.  In the Senate, Mr. Hayne, of South Carolina, was  their chief and most vehement spokesman, and in 1830 occurred that  memorable debate between him and Daniel Webster, which forever put an  end to all reasonable justification of the doctrine of Nullification,  and which furnished the ground upon which President Jackson afterward  stood in denouncing and crushing it out with the strong arm of the  Government.    In that great debate Mr. Hayne's propositions were that the Constitution  is a \"compact between the States,\" that \"in case of a plain, palpable  violation of the Constitution by the General Government, a State may  interpose; and that this interposition is constitutional\"--a proposition  with which Mr. Webster took direct issue, in these words: \"I say, the  right of a State to annul a law of Congress cannot be maintained, but on  the ground of the inalienable right of man to resist oppression; that is  to say, upon the ground of revolution.  I admit that there is an  ultimate violent remedy, above the Constitution and in defiance of the  Constitution, which may be resorted to when a revolution is to be  justified.  But I do not admit that, under the Constitution, and in  conformity with it, there is any mode in which a State Government, as a  member of the Union, can interfere and stop the progress of the general  movement by force of her own laws under any circumstances whatever.\"  Mr. Webster insisted that \"one of two things is true: either the laws of  the Union are beyond the discretion and beyond the control of the  States, or else we have no Constitution of General Government, and are  thrust back again to the days of the Confederation;\" and, in concluding  his powerful argument, he declared that \"even supposing the Constitution  to be a compact between the States,\" Mr. Hayne's doctrine was \"not  maintainable, because, first, the General Government is not a party to  the compact, but a Government established by it, and vested by it with  the powers of trying and deciding doubtful questions; and secondly,  because, if the Constitution be regarded as a compact, not one State  only, but all the States are parties to that compact, and one can have  no right to fix upon it her own peculiar construction.\"    While the comparatively miserable condition of the cotton-growing States  of the South was attributed by most of the Southern Free Traders solely  to the Protective Tariff of 1828, yet there were some Southerners  willing to concede--as did Mr. Hayne, in the Senate (1832)--that there  were \"other causes besides the Tariff\" underlying that condition, and to  admit that \"Slaves are too improvident, too incapable of that minute,  constant, delicate attention, and that persevering industry which are  essential to manufacturing establishments,\" the existence of which would  have made those States prosperous.  But such admissions were unwilling  ones, and the Cotton-lords held only with the more tenacity to the view  that the Tariff was the chief cause of their condition.    The Tariff Act of 1832, essentially modifying that of 1828, was passed  with a view, in part, to quiet Southern clamor.  But the Southern Cotton  States refused to be mollified.  On the contrary, the Free Traders of  South Carolina proceeded to extreme measures, putting in action that  which they had before but threatened.  On November 19, 1832, the leading  men of South Carolina met in Convention, and a few days thereafter  --[November 24,1882]--unanimously passed an Ordinance of Nullification  which declared the Tariff Acts of 1828 and 1832 \"Unauthorized by the  Constitution,\" and \"null, void, and no law, nor binding on this State,  its officers, or citizens.\"  The people of the State were forbidden by  it to pay, after the ensuing February 1st, the import-duties therein  imposed.  Under the provisions of the Ordinance, the State Legislature  was to pass an act nullifying these Tariff laws, and any appeal to the  United States Supreme Court against the validity of such nullifying act  was prohibited.  Furthermore, in the event of the Federal Government  attempting to enforce these Tariff laws, the people of South Carolina  would thenceforth consider themselves out of the Union, and will  \"forthwith proceed to organize a separate Government, and do all other  acts and things which sovereign and independent States may of right do.\"    At the subsequent meeting of the Legislature, Mr. Hayne, who had been a  member of the Convention, having resigned his seat in the United States  Senate, was elected Governor of the State.  He declared in his message  that he recognized \"No allegiance as paramount to that which the  citizens of South Carolina owe to the State of their birth or their  adoption\"--that doctrine of \"paramount allegiance to the State\" which in  after-years gave so much trouble to the Union and to Union-loving  Southerners--and declared that he held himself \"bound by the highest of  all obligations to carry into effect, not only the Ordinance of the  Convention, but every act of the Legislature, and every judgment of our  own Courts, the enforcement of which may devolve upon the Executive,\"  and \"if,\" continued he, \"the sacred soil of Carolina should be polluted  by the footsteps of an invader, or be stained with the blood of her  citizens, shed in her defense, I trust in Almighty God * * * even should  she stand alone in this great struggle for constitutional liberty,  encompassed by her enemies, that there will not be found, in the wide  limits of the State, one recreant son who will not fly to the rescue,  and be ready to lay down his life in her defense.\"  In support of the  contemplated treason, he even went to the length of calling for an  enrolling of volunteer forces and of holding them ready for service.    But while South Carolina stood in this treasonable and defiant attitude,  arming for war against the Union, there happened to be in the  Presidential chair one of her own sons--General Jackson.  Foreseeing  what was coming, he had, prior to the meeting of the Convention that  framed the Nullification Ordinance, ordered General Scott to Charleston  to look after \"the safety of the ports of the United States\"  thereabouts, and had sent to the Collector of that port precise  instructions as to his duty to resist in all ways any and all attempts  made under such Ordinance to defeat the operation of the Tariff laws  aforesaid.  Having thus quietly prepared the arm of the General  Government for the exercise of its power, he issued in December a  Proclamation declaring his unalterable resolution to treat Nullification  as Treason--and to crush it.    In that famous document President Jackson said of Nullification: \"If  this doctrine had been established at an earlier day, the Union would  have been dissolved in its infancy.  The Excise law in Pennsylvania, the  Embargo and Non-intercourse law in the Eastern States, the Carriage-tax  in Virginia, were all deemed unconstitutional, and were more unequal in  their operation than any of the laws now complained of; but fortunately,  none of those States discovered that they had the right now claimed by  South Carolina.  * * * The discovery of this important feature in our  Constitution was reserved for the present day.  To the statesmen of  South Carolina belongs the invention, and upon the citizens of that  State will unfortunately fall the evils of reducing it to practice.  * *  * I consider, then, the power to annul a law of the United States,  assumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union,  contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized  by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded  and destructive of the great object for which it was formed.  * * * To  say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union, is to say that  the United States are not a Nation, because it would be a solecism to  contend that any part of a Nation might dissolve its connection with the  other parts, to their injury or ruin, without committing any, offense.\"    Farther on, in his moving appeal to the South Carolinians, he bids them  beware of their leaders: \"Their object is disunion; be not deceived by  names.  Disunion, by armed force, is Treason.\"  And then, reminding them  of the deeds of their fathers in the Revolution, he proceeds: \"I adjure  you, as you honor their memory, as you love the cause"]]]
