In case of  obstinate perseverance, I ordered them to be executed. For of this I  had no doubt, whatever was the nature of their religion, that a sullen  and obstinate inflexibility called for the vengeance of the magistrate.  Some who were infected with the same madness whom, on account of their  privilege of citizenship, I reserve to be sent to Rome, to be referred  to your tribunal. In the course of this business, information pouring  in, as is usual when they are encouraged, more cases occurred. An  anonymous libel was exhibited, with a catalogue of names of persons,  who yet declared they were not Christians then or ever had been; and  they repeated after me an invocation of the gods and of your image,  which for this purpose I had ordered to be brought with the images of  the deities. They performed sacred rites with wine and frankincense,  and execrated Christ, none of which things I am told a real Christian  can ever be compelled to do. On this account I dismissed them. Others  named by an informer, first affirmed and then denied the charge of  Christianity, declaring that they had been Christians, but had ceased  to be so, some three years ago, others still longer, some even twenty  years ago. All of them worshiped your image, and the statues of the  gods, and also execrated Christ. And this was the account which they  gave of the nature of their religion they once professed, whether it  deserves the name of crime or error, namely, that they were accustomed  on a stated day to meet before daylight, and repeat among themselves  a hymn to Christ as to a god, and to bind themselves by an oath with  an obligation of not committing any wickedness; but on the contrary,  of abstaining from thefts, robberies, and adulteries; also, of not  violating their promise, or denying a pledge; after which it was their  custom to separate, and to meet again at a promiscuous, harmless  meal, from which last practice they however desisted, after the  publication of my edict, in which, agreeably to your order, I forbade  any societies of that sort. On which account I judged it the more  necessary, to inquire, by torture, from two females, who were said to  be deaconesses, what is the real truth. But nothing could I collect,  except a depraved and excessive superstition. Deferring, therefore,  any further investigation, I determined to consult you. For the number  of the culprits is so great, as to call for serious consultation.  Many persons are informed against of every age, and of both sexes;  and more still will be in the same situation. The contagion of the  superstition hath spread not only through cities, but even villages and  the country. Not that I think it impossible to check and correct it.  The success of my efforts hitherto forbids such desponding thoughts;  for the temples, once almost desolate, begin to be frequented, and the  sacred solemnities which had long been intermitted, are now attended  afresh, and the sacrificed victims are now sold everywhere, which once  could scarcely find a purchaser. Whence, I conclude, that many might  be reclaimed, were the hope of impunity, on repentance, absolutely  confirmed.\" [8]    To this Trajan sent the following answer: \"You have done perfectly  right, my dear Pliny, in the inquiry which you have made concerning  Christians. For truly no one general rule can be laid down which  will apply itself to all cases. These people must not be sought  after. If they are brought before you and convicted, let them be  capitally punished, yet with this restriction, that if anyone renounce  Christianity, and evidence his sincerity by supplicating our gods,  however suspected he may be for the past, he shall obtain pardon for  the future, on his repentance. But anonymous libels in no case ought  to be attended to; for the precedent would be of the worst sort, and  perfectly incongruous to the maxims of my government.\" [9]    Gibbon makes much of the perplexity of Pliny as to how to proceed  against the Christians. For since the life of that Roman had been  employed in the acquisition of learning and the business of the world;  since from the age of nineteen he had pleaded with distinction in  the tribunals of Rome; therefore, from the ignorance of this Roman  governor, the great historian of the Decline and Fall concludes  that there were no general laws or decrees of the senate in force  against the Christians previous to Pliny accepting the governorship  of Bithynia. [10] There is nothing, however, in the circumstance of  Pliny's ignorance to justify such a conclusion.    It is not difficult to conceive how laws and decrees against the  Christians could exist and yet a man employed as Pliny was have no  technical knowledge of the _modus operandi_ of procedure against them.  His very letter, quoted above, seems to recognize the existence of such  laws before he went into Bithynia; for he pleads as an excuse for his  ignorance of how to proceed in the business neither the non-existence,  nor the newness of the laws, but merely the fact that he had never been  present at the examination of Christians brought to trial previous to  accepting the governorship of his provinces.    In like spirit Gibbon points to the mildness of both the emperor and  the governor as being against the idea that this persecution was very  severe. Giving full credit for that mildness, what was the status of  the Christians as to liability to persecution in Bithynia and Pontus  after Pliny received the instruction of his master? (1) They were  not to be sought after, that is, hunted down for the mere sake of  destroying them; (2) anonymous complaints or libels were not to be  entertained against them; (3) if brought before the judge and they  would renounce their religion by supplicating the gods of Rome, they  were to receive pardon. So far the tender mercies of Trajan extended.  They could still be accused by any one bold enough to affix his name  to the charge; and if the accused Christians refused to deny the  faith, they were punished by sentence of death. When it is considered  how bitter was the malice of their enemies, and how wide-spread the  detestation of Christianity, it will be conceded that even in Bithynia  and Pontus, notwithstanding the mildness of the emperor and the  humanity of the governor, there was still left plenty of opportunity  to vex the church and make persecution contribute to its destruction.  I say even in Bithynia and Pontus this was the case; how much more  was it so in those provinces where less humane magistrates than Pliny  administered the laws, and who proceeded without asking for instruction  from the emperor! In such provinces the saints were liable to be  accused anonymously, put to the torture, not with a view to force from  them a confession, but a denial of the charge, failing in which they  were executed without mercy.    The limits of this inquiry forbids anything like an exhaustive  examination of the several persecutions endured by the Christians. I  shall therefore content myself with a brief reference to those most  disastrous to the church.    Passing by, then, the persecutions under Aurelius and Verus, in which  the sufferings of the Christians in Gaul were most severe--especially  in the cities of Lyons and Vienne, [11] where churches were well nigh  destroyed by its violence; and also passing by the persecutions which  arose under the edicts of Severus, which were issued more especially to  prevent the propagation of Christianity than to punish those already  converts to it, I come to that general and terrible persecution under  Decius Trajan, in the middle of the third century. The incentive which  prompted the action of Decius against the Christians is variously  ascribed to hatred of his predecessor, Philip, whom he had murdered,  and who was friendly to the church; to his zeal for paganism; and  lastly to his fear, feigned or real, that the Christians would usurp  the empire. Perhaps all these motives combined impelled him to make war  upon the church. According to the representations of one Dionysius,  quoted by Eusebius, the persecution, at least in Africa, began before  the edicts of Decius were issued. \"The persecution with us,\" says the  writer referred to, \"did not begin with the imperial edict but precede  it by a whole year. And a certain prophet and poet, inauspicious to the  city [Alexandria], whoever he was, excited the mass of the heathens  against us, stirring them up to their native superstition. Stimulated  by him, and taking full liberty to exercise any kind of wickedness,  they considered this the only piety, and the worship of their demons,  _viz,_ to slay us. * * But as the sedition and civil war overtook the  wretches, their cruelty was diverted from us to one another. We then  drew a little breath, while their rage against us was a little abated.  But, presently, that change from a milder reign was announced to us,  and much terror was now threatening us. The decree [of Decius] had  arrived, very much like that which was foretold by our Lord, exhibiting  the most dreadful aspects so that, if it were possible, the very  elect would stumble. All indeed were greatly alarmed, and many of the  more eminent immediately gave way to them; others, who were in public  offices, were led forth by their very acts; others were brought by  their acquaintances and when called by name, they approached the impure  and unholy sacrifices. But pale and trembling, as if they were not to  sacrifice but themselves to be the victims and the sacrifices to the  idols. They were jeered by many of the surrounding multitude, and were  obviously equally afraid to die and to offer the sacrifice. But some  advanced with greater readiness to the altar and boldly asserted that  they had never before been Christians, concerning whom the declaration  of our Lord is most true,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46237"],[0,"The Romance of Book-Collecting (#10)"],[1,"10s. 6d., and thus made 6d. on the transaction, he would have had the  excuse of absolute ignorance in his favour, but L4 is such a curious and  yet significant amount that there can be no question that he at any rate  knew sufficiently well what he was about to make the absence of proper  inquiry on his part a positive crime.  Any such value as L4 placed on a  pamphlet of twenty-seven pages is in itself such an indication of value  that no anxious would-be purchaser of any scarce and yet  insignificant-looking book dare offer anything like the amount for it.  He must either pay the full price or near it, which is more honest, as  well as more satisfactory in the long-run or swallow his principles and  tender next to nothing with a nonchalant air.    Personally I feel sorry that the gotten Lore Society had such a small  measure of success, for it deserved well.  The management was too  vicarious for the times, and, moreover, its object was not the buying  and selling of books, which one man, if he have sufficient capital, can  do as well as twenty.  To rescue mean-looking but valuable literature  from certain destruction was its one and only study, and the realization  of its dreams was only accomplished very partially because, as I have  hinted, the members of the association were specialists moving in narrow  grooves.  The few successes that can be placed to its credit would,  however, have been its curse had it dealt hardly and uncharitably with  the ignorant people who on more than one occasion parted with small  fortunes (to them) for the price of a day's subsistence.  To buy a  perfectly clean copy of Thackeray's 'Second Funeral of Napoleon' for 2s.  was a work of art, for the old woman who sold it, in order to buy tea,  as it subsequently transpired, wanted more, and yet was so thoroughly  saturated with suspicion that she would probably have refused to sell at  any price had more been offered.  The book was acquired for that sum, as  I have said, after much discussion and with many misgivings, at least on  one side; but when bought, the circumstances altered, and she found  herself possessed of more money than she had had the control of at one  time in her life before, for it is, I think, to the credit of the  Forgotten Lore Society that it voluntarily paid into the Post-Office  Savings Bank a sum of L10 to the order of the seller a few days after  the transaction was carried through.  Such finds as these were, however,  few and far between.  In nearly every case such books as the ignorant  are possessed of are very inferior, and, what is perhaps not surprising,  assessed by their owners at ridiculous prices.    It was part of the business of the society to advertise for books in  country journals, and to while away a few moments I give the gist or the  actual text of some of the replies received.  One correspondent wrote to  say that he hadn't got no books, but would sell us a fox-terrier pup, if  that would do instead, and then he proceeded to enumerate at great  length what he called its 'pints,' concluding with the remark that he  had sent it off that very evening by passenger, train. It turned up,  sure enough, in the morning, sorrowful of countenance, a snarling,  disreputable cur, which we were only too glad to feed and return to its  home without delay.    This was an instance, fortunately very rare, of the wilful substitution  of one article for another of a totally different kind; but nearly every  letter we took the trouble to answer proved to be misleading in one way  or another, and not a few contained a series of palpable untruths. There  would be no advantage in reproducing many of these epistles, and,  moreover, the circumstances surrounding them are not of sufficient  interest to warrant more than a passing notice.  Suffice it to say that  they were mere vendors' glosses, not to be taken _au serieux_.  The  number of books with 'magnificent plates' or in 'splendid condition'  that turned out on inspection to be the tramps and tatterdemalions of  bookish society was very surprising.  Some few, however, were very  curious, and others so quaint in diction that I have no hesitation in  copying them either wholly or in part.  Here is one:      'Deer Sur i begs to state as ou i ave sume bukes their is Boosey  anecdoates of fishin for wich five bob and a lang his hanglin skeches  hopen to hoffers stackhouse new history of the Holy Bibel to pouns an a  lot moar to order deer Sur if you be willin and i wil sen to luke at for  2L on the nale your respectabul----.'      A 'bob,' I may explain for the benefit of my American readers, is the  slang equivalent of a shilling, or twenty-four cents.    The following reply, full of facetiousness and loaded with cunning, came  from a village near Kirkby Stephen, in Westmoreland:      'SIR    'Seeing your advt in the Gazete I hasten to copie out the titles of some  books which have been in my family for I dont know how long.  A  Bookseller come up from Lancaster last Toosday and wanted to have them  sore but as I could see he wanted to cheat me I thought it better tell  him so in plain English which is the way of yours truly who is a  wrestling man and champion chucker out of these parts round about.  Am  open to good offer for the lot but will sell any at following and no  discount.  Ellicot Lectures on J. Christ, 10s.  Durny Histoir de Romans,  vol. 4, 6s.  Stock Exchange year Book for 1884, 7s; Ante Baccus a choise  volume bound in calf, 17s. 6d.  Scrope Days and Nights of Fishing 1843,  12s.  The Female Parson 4s, and plenty more too numerous till I see what  you are made of.  Please write at once if you want any.    'Yours truly----.'      The upshot of this was that we said we should like to see Scrope and the  'Female Parson,' but our bellicose correspondent refused to part with  either till he got the money, for he did not, he said, intend to trouble  himself about useless references.  So the money was sent, and in due  course the books arrived, carriage not paid.  The 'Female Parson,' which  we had never heard of before, proved to be worthless, but Scrope's  'Salmon Fishing' was really a beautiful copy of the first edition in the  original cloth, and this it was that had doubtless tempted the Lancaster  bookseller.    Then there was a lady in Somersetshire who kept up a correspondence for  over a month.  She had a splendid copy, so she said, of Sturm's  'Reflections,' which she was ready to sell for 15s. In vain was she  informed that the book was not of a kind to interest us; she knew  better, and persistently lowered the price, 1s. at a bid, till her  letters had in sheer desperation to be put in the waste-paper basket.  We found ladies, as a rule, distressing correspondents, who flatly  refused to be put off with a courteous negative.  With them it was  simply a question of price, and had we been persuaded by their  blandishments, we should soon have had a cellar full of sermons, Gospel  Magazines, and all the rubbish that Time refuses to annihilate and men  to buy.    One of the most extraordinary letters we ever received came from a  clergyman in the Midlands, whose disgust for Pierce Egan and his school  was so great that he had determined to sacrifice 'Tom and Jerry' for  20s.:      'DEAR SIR,    'I much regret troubling you with a book which has, to me, been a source  of grievous disappointment, and positive danger to my children. How  anyone could have written such a wicked history of debauchery and human  extravagance is indeed surprising, and I have thought many a time of  consigning it to the flames, so that in a measure it might follow its  disreputable author. I allude to \"Life in London; or the Day and Night  Scenes of Jerry Hawthorn, Esq., and his Elegant Friend, Corinthian Tom,  accompanied by Bob Logic, the Oxonian, in their Rambles and Sprees  through the Metropolis,\" by Pierce Egan. This work has, I regret to say,  been in my family for very many years--more than I care to count--and I  would willingly part with it, although there is nothing I dislike so  much as severing old associations, however much to my distaste they may  be.  If you like, I will dispose of the book for L1, which perhaps, from  a marketable point of view, it may be worth.    'I am, dear sir,         'Yours very truly----.'      There is, of course, no denying that the morality of Jerry Hawthorn,  Esq., and his elegant friend would have to be searched for in case its  existence were seriously disputed; but it seems passing strange that so  small a sum as 20s. should be able to smooth away all remembrance of the  orgies of Drury Lane and the crapulence of its dirty gin vaults, cider  cellars and night-houses, which had so mortally offended the worthy  clergyman.    He was indeed quite right in removing the book from the reach of his  children; but what about our morality, and that of the person to whom,  for anything he knew to the contrary, we might sell Pierce Egan's free  and easy romance? The book came, and proved, as was half suspected, to  be Hotten's reprint of 1869, with which lovers of this class of  literature will have nothing whatever to do.    Such are a few of the experiences of the Forgotten Lore Society in its  efforts to rescue good but unfortunate books from the apathy of neglect.  The object was a good one, though the reward was practically nil.  Let  us reflect for a moment that even the few books of antiquity which have  come down to make us richer are for the most part imperfect, and we  shall see the necessity of taking extreme care of the important ones  that are written now, and of doing everything in our power to prevent  their destruction at the hands of unappreciative owners.    The mere fact of printed books being published in large quantities to  the edition does not seem to affect the question of their existence in  the long-run.  All alike, good, bad, and indifferent, will go down the  long road in time, and our descendants, "]]]
