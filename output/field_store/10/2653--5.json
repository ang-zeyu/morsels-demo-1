The north wind kisses her rosy mouth,  His rival frowns in the far-off south,    And comes caressing her sunburnt cheek,  And Summer awakes for one short week,--    Awakes and gathers her wealth of grain,  Then sleeps and dreams for a year again.        LADY LORGNETTE      I    Lady Lorgnette, of the lifted lash,    The curling lip and the dainty nose,  The shell-like ear where the jewels flash,    The arching brow and the languid pose,  The rare old lace and the subtle scents,    The slender foot and the fingers frail,--  I may act till the world grows wild and tense,    But never a flush on your features pale.  The footlights glimmer between us two,--    You in the box and I on the boards,--  I am only an actor, Madame, to you,    A mimic king 'mid his mimic lords,  For you are the belle of the smartest set,               Lady Lorgnette.    II    Little Babette, with your eyes of jet,    Your midnight hair and your piquant chin,  Your lips whose odours of violet    Drive men to madness and saints to sin,--  I see you over the footlights' glare    Down in the pit 'mid the common mob,--  Your throat is burning, and brown, and bare,    You lean, and listen, and pulse, and throb;  The viols are dreaming between us two,    And my gilded crown is no make-believe,  I am more than an actor, dear, to you,    For you called me your king but yester eve,  And your heart is my golden coronet,               Little Babette.        LOW TIDE AT ST. ANDREWS      (NEW BRUNSWICK)    The long red flats stretch open to the sky,  Breathing their moisture on the August air.  The seaweeds cling with flesh-like fingers where  The rocks give shelter that the sands deny;  And wrapped in all her summer harmonies  St. Andrews sleeps beside her sleeping seas.    The far-off shores swim blue and indistinct,  Like half-lost memories of some old dream.  The listless waves that catch each sunny gleam  Are idling up the waterways land-linked,  And, yellowing along the harbour's breast,  The light is leaping shoreward from the west.    And naked-footed children, tripping down,  Light with young laughter, daily come at eve  To gather dulse and sea clams and then heave  Their loads, returning laden to the town,  Leaving a strange grey silence when they go,--  The silence of the sands when tides are low.        BEYOND THE BLUE      I    Speak of you, sir? You bet he did. Ben Fields was far too sound  To go back on a fellow just because he weren't around.  Why, sir, he thought a lot of you, and only three months back  Says he, \"The Squire will some time come a-snuffing out our track  And give us the surprise.\" And so I got to thinking then  That any day you might drop down on Rove, and me, and Ben.  And now you've come for nothing, for the lad has left us two,  And six long weeks ago, sir, he went up beyond the blue.    Who's Rove? Oh, he's the collie, and the only thing on earth  That I will ever love again. Why, Squire, that dog is worth  More than you ever handled, and that's quite a piece, I know.  Ah, there the beggar is!--come here, you scalawag! and show  Your broken leg all bandaged up. Yes, sir, it's pretty sore;  I did it,--curse me,--and I think I feel the pain far more  Than him, for somehow I just feel as if I'd been untrue  To what my brother said before he went beyond the blue.    You see, the day before he died he says to me, \"Say, Ned,  Be sure you take good care of poor old Rover when I'm dead,  And maybe he will cheer your lonesome hours up a bit,  And when he takes to you just see that you're deserving it.\"  Well, Squire, it wasn't any use. I tried, but couldn't get  The friendship of that collie, for I needed it, you bet.  I might as well have tried to get the moon to help me through,  For Rover's heart had gone with Ben, 'way up beyond the blue.    He never seemed to take to me nor follow me about,  For all I coaxed and petted, for my heart was starving out  For want of some companionship,--I thought, if only he  Would lick my hand or come and put his head aside my knee,  Perhaps his touch would scatter something of the gloom away.  But all alone I had to live until there came a day  When, tired of the battle, as you'd have tired too,  I wished to heaven I'd gone with Ben, 'way up beyond the blue.           .        .        .        .        .    One morning I took out Ben's gun, and thought I'd hunt all day,  And started through the clearing for the bush that forward lay,  When something made me look around--I scarce believed my mind--  But, sure enough, the dog was following right close behind.  A feeling first of joy, and than a sharper, greater one  Of anger came, at knowing 'twas not me, but Ben's old gun,  That Rove was after,--well, sir, I just don't mind telling you,  But I forgot that moment Ben was up beyond the blue.    Perhaps it was but jealousy--perhaps it was despair,  But I just struck him with the gun and broke the bone right there;  And then--my very throat seemed choked, for he began to whine  With pain--God knows how tenderly I took that dog of mine  Up in my arms, and tore my old red necktie into bands  To bind the broken leg, while there he lay and licked my hands;  And though I cursed my soul, it was the brightest day I knew,  Or even cared to live, since Ben went up beyond the blue.    I tell you, Squire, I nursed him just as gently as could be,  And now I'm all the world to him, and he's the world to me.  Look, sir, at that big, noble soul, right in his faithful eyes,  The square, forgiving honesty that deep down in them lies.  Eh, Squire? What's that you say? _He's got no soul?_ I tell you, then,  He's grander and he's better than the mass of what's called men;  And I guess he stands a better chance than many of us do  Of seeing Ben some day again, 'way up beyond the blue.        THE MARINER      \"Wreck and stray and castaway.\"--SWINBURNE.        Once more adrift.  O'er dappling sea and broad lagoon,  O'er frowning cliff and yellow dune,  The long, warm lights of afternoon      Like jewel dustings sift.        Once more awake.  I dreamed an hour of port and quay,  Of anchorage not meant for me;  The sea, the sea, the hungry sea      Came rolling up the break.        Once more afloat.  The billows on my moorings press't,  They drove me from my moment's rest,  And now a portless sea I breast,      And shelterless my boat.        Once more away.  The harbour lights are growing dim,  The shore is but a purple rim,  The sea outstretches grey and grim.      Away, away, away!        Once more at sea,  The old, old sea I used to sail,  The battling tide, the blowing gale,  The waves with ceaseless under-wail      The life that used to be.        LULLABY OF THE IROQUOIS      Little brown baby-bird, lapped in your nest,      Wrapped in your nest,      Strapped in your nest,  Your straight little cradle-board rocks you to rest;      Its hands are your nest;      Its bands are your nest;  It swings from the down-bending branch of the oak;  You watch the camp flame, and the curling grey smoke;  But, oh, for your pretty black eyes sleep is best,--  Little brown baby of mine, go to rest.    Little brown baby-bird swinging to sleep,      Winging to sleep,      Singing to sleep,  Your wonder-black eyes that so wide open keep,      Shielding their sleep,      Unyielding to sleep,  The heron is homing, the plover is still,  The night-owl calls from his haunt on the hill,  Afar the fox barks, afar the stars peep,--  Little brown baby of mine, go to sleep.        THE CORN HUSKER      Hard by the Indian lodges, where the bush    Breaks in a clearing, through ill-fashioned fields,  She comes to labour, when the first still hush    Of autumn follows large and recent yields.    Age in her fingers, hunger in her face,    Her shoulders stooped with weight of work and years,  But rich in tawny colouring of her race,    She comes a-field to strip the purple ears.    And all her thoughts are with the days gone by,    Ere might's injustice banished from their lands  Her people, that to-day unheeded lie,    Like the dead husks that rustle through her hands.        PRAIRIE GREYHOUNDS      C.P.R. \"NO. 1,\" WESTBOUND        I swing to the sunset land--  The world of prairie, the world of plain,  The world of promise and hope and gain,  The world of gold, and the world of grain,      And the world of the willing hand.        I carry the brave and bold--  The one who works for the nation's bread,  The one whose past is a thing that's dead,  The one who battles and beats ahead,      And the one who goes for gold.        I swing to the \"Land to Be,\"  I am the power that laid its floors,  I am the guide to its western stores,  I am the key to its golden doors,      That open alone to me.      C.P.R. \"NO. 2,\" EASTBOUND        I swing to the land of morn;  The grey old east with its grey old seas,  The land of leisure, the land of ease,  The land of flowers and fruits and trees,      And the place where we were born.        Freighted with wealth I come;  For he who many a moon has spent  Far out west on adventure bent,  With well-worn pick and a folded tent,      Is bringing his bullion home.        I never will be renowned,  As my twin that swings to the western marts,  For I am she of the humbler parts,  But I am the joy of the waiting hearts;      For I am the Homeward-bound.        GOLDEN--OF THE SELKIRKS      A trail upwinds from Golden;  It leads to a land God only knows,  To the land of eternal frozen snows,  That trail unknown and olden.    And they tell a tale that is strange and wild--  Of a lovely and lonely mountain child  That went up the trail from Golden.    A child in the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5630"],[0,"The Story of \"Mormonism\" and The Philosophy of \"Mormonism\" (#10)"],[1,"of everything outside of actual necessities in  the way of accouterment and camp equipage.  The army found the  people in poverty, and left them in comparative wealth.    And what was the cause of this hurried departure of the military?  For many months, ominous rumblings had been heard,--indications  of the gathering storm which was soon to break in the awful fury  of civil strife.  It could not be doubted that war was imminent;  already the conflict had begun, and a picked part of the army was  away in the western wilds, doing nothing for any phase of the  public good.  But a word further concerning the expedition in  general.  The sending of troops to Utah was part of a foul scheme  to weaken the government in its impending struggle with the  secessionists.  The movement has been called not inaptly  \"Buchanan's blunder,\" but the best and wisest men may make  blunders, and whatever may be said of President Buchanan's  short-sightedness in taking this step, even his enemies do not  question his integrity in the matter.  He was unjustly charged  with favoring secession; but the charge was soon disproved.    However, it was known that certain of his cabinet were in league  with the seceding states; and prominent among them was John  Floyd, secretary of war.  The successful efforts of this officer  to disarm the North, while accumulating the munitions of war in  the South; to scatter the forces by locating them in widely  separated and remote stations; and in other ways to dispose of  the regular army in the manner best calculated to favor the  anticipated rebellion, are matters of history.  It is also told  how, at the commencement of the rebellion, he allied himself with  the confederate forces, accepting the rank of brigadier-general.  It was through Floyd's advice that Buchanan ordered the military  expedition to Utah, ostensibly to install certain federal  officials and to repress an alleged infantile rebellion which in  fact had never come into existence, but in reality to further the  interests of the secessionists.  When the history of that great  struggle with its antecedent and its consequent circumstances is  written with a pen that shall indite naught but truth, when  prejudice and partisanship are lived down, it may appear that  Jefferson Davis rather than James Buchanan was the prime cause of  the great mistake.    And General Johnston who commanded the army in the west; he who  was so vehement in his denunciation of the rebel \"Mormons,\" and  who rejoiced in being selected to chastise them into submission;  who, because of his vindictiveness incurred the ill-favor of the  governor, whose _posse comitatus_ the army was; what became of  him, at one time so popular that he was spoken of as a likely  successor to Winfield Scott in the office of general-in-chief of  the United States army?  He left Utah in the early stages of the  rebellion, turned his arms against the flag he had sworn to  defend, doffed the blue, donned the grey, and fell a rebel on the  field of Shiloh.    Changes many and great followed in bewildering succession in  Utah.  The people were besought to take sides with the South in  the awful scenes of cruel strife; it was openly stated in the  east that Utah had allied herself with the cause of secession;  and by others that the design was to make Salt Lake City the  capital of an independent government.  And surely such  conjectures were pardonable on the part of all whose ignorance  and prejudice still nursed the delusion of \"Mormon\" disloyalty.  Moreover, had the people been inclined to rebellion what greater  opportunity could they have wished?  Already a North and a South  were talked of--why not set up also a West?  A supreme  opportunity had come and how was it used?  It was at this very  time that the Overland Telegraph line, which had been approaching  from the Atlantic and the Pacific, was completed, and the first  tremor felt in that nerve of steel carried these words from  Brigham Young:        Utah has not seceded, but is firm for the constitution      and laws of our country.    The \"Mormon\" people saw in their terrible experiences and in the  outrages to which they had been subjected, only the  mal-administration of laws and the subversion of justice through  human incapacity and hatred.  Never even for a moment did they  question the supreme authority and the inspired origin of the  constitution of their land.  They knew no North, no South, no  East, no West; they stood positively by the constitution, and  would have nothing to do in the bloody strife between brothers,  unless indeed they were summoned by the authority to which they  had already once loyally responded, to furnish men and arms for  their country's need.    Following the advent of the telegraph came the railway; and the  land of \"Mormondom\" was no longer isolated.  Her resources were  developed, her wealth became a topic of the world's wonder; the  tide of immigration swelled her population, contributing much of  the best from all the civilized nations of the earth.  Every  reader of recent and current history has learned of her rapid  growth; of her repeated appeals for the recognition to which she  had so long been entitled in the sisterhood of states; of the  prompt refusals with which her pleas were persistently met,  though other territories with smaller and more illiterate  populations, more restricted resources, and in every way weaker  claims, were allowed to assume the habiliments of maturity, while  Utah, lusty, large and strong, was kept in swaddling clothes.  But the cries of the vigorous infant were at length heeded, and  in answer to the seventh appeal of the kind, Utah's star was  added to the nation's galaxy.    But let us turn more particularly to the history of the Church  itself.  For a second time and thrice thereafter, the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has been deprived of its  president, and on each occasion were reiterated the prophecies of  disruption uttered at the time of Joseph Smith's assassination.  Calm observers declared that as the shepherd had gone, the flock  would soon be dispersed; while others, comparable only to wolves,  thinking the fold unguarded, sought to harry and scatter the  sheep.  But \"Mormonism\" died not; every added pang of grief  served but to unite the people.    When Brigham Young passed from earth, he was mourned of the  people as deeply as was Moses of Israel.  And had he not proved  himself a Moses, aye and a Joshua, too?  He had led the people  into the land of holy promise, and had divided unto them their  inheritances.  He was a man with clear title as one of the small  brotherhood we call great.  As carpenter, farmer, pioneer,  capitalist, financier, preacher, apostle, prophet--in everything  he was a leader among men.  Even those who opposed him in  politics and in religion respected him for his talents, his  magnanimity, his liberality, and his manliness; and years after  his demise, men who had refused him honor while alive brought  their mites and their gold to erect a monument of stone and  bronze to the memory of this man who needs it not.  With his  death closed another epoch in the history of his people, and a  successor arose, one who was capable of leading and judging under  the changed conditions.                              -----------    But perhaps I am suspected of having forgotten or of having  intentionally omitted reference to what popular belief once  considered the chief feature of \"Mormonism,\" the cornerstone of  the structure, the secret of its influence over its members, and  of its attractiveness to its proselytes, viz., the peculiarity of  the \"Mormon\" institution of marriage.  The Latter-day Saints were  long regarded as a polygamous people.  That plural marriage has  been practised by a limited proportion of the people, under  sanction of Church ordinance, has never since the introduction of  the system been denied.  But that plural marriage is a vital  tenet of the Church is not true.  What the Latter-day Saints call  celestial marriage is characteristic of the Church, and is in  very general practise; but of celestial marriage, plurality of  wives was an incident, never an essential.  Yet the two have  often been confused in the popular mind.    We believe in a literal resurrection and an actual hereafter, in  which future state shall be recognized every sanctified and  authorized relationship existing here on earth--of parent and  child, brother and sister, husband and wife.  We believe, further  that contracts as of marriage, to be valid beyond the veil of  mortality must be sanctioned by a power greater than that of  earth.  With the seal of the holy Priesthood upon their wedded  state, these people believe implicitly in the perpetuity of that  relationship on the far side of the grave.  They marry not with  the saddening limitation \"Until death do you part,\" but \"For time  and for all eternity.\"[3]  This constitutes celestial marriage.  The thought that plural marriage has ever been the head and front  of \"Mormon\" offending, that to it is traceable as the true cause  the hatred of other sects and the unpopularity of the Church, is  not tenable to the earnest thinker.  Sad as have been the  experiences of the people in consequence of this practise, deep  and anguish-laden as have been the sighs and groans, hot and  bitter as have been the tears so caused, the heaviest  persecution, the cruelest treatment of their history began before  plural marriage was known in the Church.    [Footnote 3: For treatment of Celestial Marraige and other Temple  ordinances, see \"The House of the Lord,\" by the present author,  Salt Lake City, Utah, 1912.]    There is no sect nor people that sets a higher value on virtue  and chastity than do the Latter-day Saints, nor a people that  visits surer retribution upon the heads of offenders against the  laws of sexual purity.  To them marriage is not, can never be, a "]]]
