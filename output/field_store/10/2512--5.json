The cow was  often the object heroes fought for in heaven; the Brahman wished to be  the object heroes should fight for upon earth.    We learn from the domestic ceremonies referred to by _Grihyasutrani_  with how much respect the bull and the cow were treated as the symbols  of abundance in a family. In _Acvalayanas_,[141] we find the bull's  hide stretched out near the nuptial hearth, the wife seated upon it,  and the husband, touching his wife, saying, \"May the lord of all  creatures allow us to have children;\"--words taken from the Vedic  nuptial hymn.[142] We have seen above how the Ribhavas, from the hide  of a dead cow, formed a new and beautiful one, or, in other words,  how, from the dusk of evening, by stretching it in the night, they  formed the dawn of morning. This cow's hide plays also an important  _role_ in the popular faith; an extraordinary elasticity is attributed  to it, a power of endless expansibility, and for this reason it is  adopted as a symbol of fecundity, upon which the wife must place  herself in order to become a mother of children. The cow's hide  (_gocarman_), in the _Mahabharatam_,[143] is the garment of the god  Vishnus; and the gocarman divided into thongs, and afterwards fastened  to each other, served formerly in India to measure the circumference  of a piece of ground;[144] hence the cow's hide suggested the idea of  a species of infinity. Further on we shall find it put to  extraordinary uses in western legend; we find it even in the hymns of  the Vedic age used to cover the body of a dead man, the fire being  invoked not to consume it, almost as if the cow's hide had the virtue  of resuscitating the dead.[145]    The cow, being the symbol of fruitfulness, was also the companion of  the wife during pregnancy. _Acvalayanas_[146] tells us how, in the  third month, the husband was to give his wife to drink of the sour  milk of a cow that has a calf like itself, and in it two beans and a  grain of barley; the husband was then to ask his wife three times,  \"What drinkest thou?\" and she was to answer three times: \"The  generation of males.\" In the fourth month, the wife, according to  _Acvalayanas_, was to put herself again upon the bull's hide, near the  fire of sacrifice, when they again invoked the god _Pragapatis_, lord  of all creatures, or of procreation; the moon, like a celestial bull  and cow, was invited to be present at the generation of men;[147] and  a bull, during the Vedic period, was the gift which sufficed for the  priest. In the Vedic antiquity, neither bulls nor cows were allowed to  go to pasture without some special augury, which, in the domestic  ceremonials of _Acvalayanas_,[148] has been also handed down to us;  the cows were to give milk and honey, for the strength and increase of  whoever possessed them. Here we have again the cows not only as the  beneficent, but as the strong ones, they who help the hero or the  heroine who takes them to pasture.    But although beautiful cows, when seen by day, are a sign of good  luck, seen in dreams they are of evil omen; for in that case they are  of course the black cows, the shadows of night, or the gloomy waters  of the nocturnal ocean. Already in the _Rigvedas_, the dawn, or the  luminous cow, comes to deliver the fore-mentioned solar hero, Tritas  Aptyas, from the evil sleep which he sleeps amidst the cows[149] of  night. _Acvalayanas_, in his turn, recommends us when we have an evil  dream, to invoke the sun, to hasten the approach of the morning, or,  better still, to recite the hymn of five verses to the dawn which we  have already referred to, and which begins with the words, \"And like  an evil dream amidst the cows.\" Here the belief is not yet an entirely  superstitious one; and we understand what is meant by the cows who  envelop us in the sleep of night, when we are told to invoke the sun  and the dawn to come and deliver us from them.    A cow (probably a black one), often a black goat, was sometimes also  sacrificed in the funeral ceremonies of the Hindoos, as if to augur  that, just as the black cow, night, produces the milky humours of the  aurora, or is fruitful, so will he who has passed through the kingdom  of darkness rise again in the world of light. We have already seen the  black night as the mother of the white and luminous aurora; I quote  below yet another Vedic sentence, in which a poet ingenuously wonders  why the cows of Indras, the black ones as well as the light-coloured  (the black clouds, as well as the white and red ones), should both  yield white milk.[150] And even the gloomy nocturnal kingdom of Yamas,  the god of the dead, has its cows of black appearance, which are  nevertheless milk-yielding; and thus the black cow of the funeral  sacrifices comes to forebode resurrection.    In the same way the viaticum, or provision of food for his journey,  given to the dead man is a symbol of his resurrection. The journey  being considered as a short one, the provision of food which is to  sustain the traveller to the kingdom of the dead is limited, and each  dead hero carries it with him, generally not so much for himself, as  to ensure a passage into the kingdom of the dead. For this reason we  read, even in the domestic ceremonials of _Acvalayanas_, that it is  recommended to put into the hands of the dead man,[151] what is the  greatest symbol of strength, the reins of the animal killed in the  funeral sacrifice (or, in default of an animal victim, at least two  cakes of rice or of flour), in order that the dead man may throw them  down the throats of the two Cerberi, the two sons of the bitch  _Sarama_, so that they may let the deceased enter scatheless into the  death-kingdom, the mysterious kingdom of Yamas; and here we find the  monster of the popular tales, into whose house the hero, having passed  through many dangers, enters, by the advice of a good fairy or of a  good old man, giving something to appease the hunger of the two dogs  who guard its gate.    They who return from the funeral must touch the stone of Priapus, a  fire, the excrement of a cow,[152] a grain of barley, a grain of  sesame and water,--all symbols of that fecundity which the contact  with a corpse might have destroyed.    The Vedic hymns have shown us the principal mythical aspects and  functions of the cow and the bull; we have also seen how the brahmanic  codes confirmed, by the sanction of law, the worship of these animals,  and how jealously the domestic tradition of the Hindoos has guarded  it. Let us now see from the _Aitareya-brahmanam_, how the Brahmans  themselves, those of the era immediately following that of the Vedas,  interpreted the myth of the cow.    We have recognised in the Vedic heavens, as reflected in the hymns of  the _Rigvedas_, three cows--the cow-cloud, the cow-moon, and the  cow-aurora. These three cows, and especially the first and the third,  are also quite distinct from one another in the _Aitareya-brahmanam_.    It tells us how the _gauh pricnih_, the variegated cow, or spotted  cow, of the _Rigvedas_, must be celebrated to make the earth  fruitful[153] (or that one must sing to the cloud that it may  fertilise the pastures and fields with rain), and how one must  sacrifice a bull to _Vicvakarman_ (or the one that does all), who is  transformed into the god Indras when killing the demon Vritras,[154]  or the monster who keeps the rain in the cloud.    It shows us the full moon, _Raka_, joined to the aurora, as a source of  abundance,[155] and the aurora with the cow.[156] It tells us explicitly  that the characteristic form of the aurora is the red cow, because she  moves with the red cows.[157] The gods, after having discovered the cows  in the cavern, open the cavern with the third libation of the  morning;[158] when the cows come out, the gods, the _Adityas_, also come  out; hence the coming forth of the gods (_Adityanam ayanam_) is  equivalent to the coming forth of the cows (_gavam ayanam_). The cows  come out when they have their horns, and adorn themselves.[159]    The aurora is a cow; this cow has horns; her horns are radiant and  golden. When the cow aurora comes forth, all that falls from her horns  brings good luck; hence in the _Mahabharatam_,[160] the benefits  received from a holy hermit, called Matangas, are compared to those of  a _gavam ayanam_, _i.e._, a coming out of cows. To understand this  simile, besides a reference to the Vedic texts, it is necessary to  compare it with the modern usages of India, in which, in celebration  of the new solar year, or the birth of the pastoral god Krishnas (the  god who is black during the night, but who becomes luminous in the  morning among the cows of the dawning, or among the female cowherds),  it is customary, towards the end of December, to give cows to the  Brahmans, exchange presents of cows and calves, besprinkle one another  with milk, to adorn a beautiful milch cow, crown her with flowers,  gild her horns, or paint them various colours, to deck her to  overloading with flowers, fruit, and little cakes, and then hunt her  from the village to the sound of drums and trumpets, in order that,  full of terror, she may flee away with distraction and impetuosity.  The cow loses her ornaments in her flight, and these, being estimated  as propitious treasures, are eagerly picked up by the faithful, and  preserved as sacred relics.[161]    In the _Aitareya-brahmanam_,[162] the sun is born of the cows (_goga_),  is the son of the cow aurora; as the sun's mother she naturally  nourishes him with her milk; hence the same _Aitareya_[163] tells us  that the gods Mitras and Varunas, by means of the curdled milk, took  from the drink of the gods the inebriating poison which the long-tongued  witch (_Dirghagihvi_) had poured into it. This"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38750"],[0,"Current History: A Monthly Magazine of the New York Times, May 1918 (#10)"],[1," is separate  fighting in progress round about the village of Ayette--such a wretched  little place of brickdust and broken walls when I saw it last on the way  from Arras to Bapaume--and the enemy is trying to recapture this, his  fire reaching to villages several thousand yards behind the British  front.    The British troops in this district are defending their positions  resolutely, and the first reports indicate that the German storm troops  are suffering under their machine-gun fire, after being shelled in their  assembly places by heavy and field artillery.      A Valley of Death    _Sunday, April 7._--Since the heavy fights on Friday, when the enemy  made a series of vain attacks against the British north of Albert, there  has been no battle. The Germans are still struggling hard to get their  guns, especially the heavy guns, further forward and to reorganize their  divisions.    They have no peace or quiet, for they are under a harassing fire, and  along the valley of the Ancre, above Albert, in that stinking ditch  between Bouzeincourt and Aveluy and Mesnil and Thiepval, where foul  water lies stagnant below rows of dead, lopped trees and frightful  smells arise from the relics of battles two weeks ago, their men are  very wretched. Here in this valley of death, for it was that, and behind  in the old fields of the Somme, the German troops have no cover from  storms or shellfire.      Battle of Armentieres    _Tuesday, April 9._--A heavy and determined attack was begun against us  this morning a considerable distance north of our recent battles on  about eleven miles of front between Armentieres and La Bassee Canal.  This new attack was preceded by a long, concentrated bombardment, which  had gradually been increasing during the last day or two, until it  reached great heights of fury last night and early this morning. The  enemy used poison gas in immense quantities; during the night he flung  over 60,000 gas shells in order to create a wide zone of this evil vapor  and stupefy the gunners, transport, and infantry.    His gunfire reached out to many towns and villages behind the allied  lines, like Bethune and Armentieres, Vermelles and Philosophe, Merville  and Estaires, and this did not cease around Armentieres until 11:30 this  morning, though further south from Fleurbaix his infantry attack was in  progress at an early hour, certainly by 8 o'clock, and his barrage  lifted in order to let his troops advance.    Part of the line was held by Portuguese troops, who for a long time have  been between Laventie and Neuve Chapelle, holding positions which were  subject to severe raids from time to time. They are now in the thick of  this battle, most fiercely beset and fighting gallantly.      Formidable New Offensive    _Wednesday, April 10._--It is now clear that the attack between  Armentieres and Givenchy is a new and formidable offensive. It also is  made certain by this new thrust that the German high command have  decided to throw the full weight of their armies against the British in  an endeavor to destroy their forces in Northern France instead of  dividing their efforts by striking also at the French. It is a menace  which calls for a supreme effort of the armies of Great Britain and her  allies.    Yesterday the enemy struck north on the British left, beginning in the  flat grounds opposite Neuve Chapelle as the centre of the thrust, with  Fleurbaix to the north and Givenchy to the south, and extending this  morning further north still above Armentieres, and including the ridge  of Messines.    An enormous gunfire was directed against the British positions along all  this line last night again after yesterday morning's bombardment, and  continued without pause through a very unquiet night, when all through  the hours this tumult of great guns beat upon one's ears with continued  drumfire, and all the sky was full of flame and light.    This morning again when I went up into French Flanders and through the  villages which the enemy had been shelling regardless of the women and  children there, this frightful, unceasing thunder was as loud as ever  and told one without further news that the battle was still going on and  that the Germans were extending its zone.      Portuguese Are Hard Hit    It was a tragedy for the Portuguese that the heaviest bombardment in the  storm of gunfire, as terrible in its fury as anything of the kind since  March 21, was directed against the centre, which they held. It was  annihilating to their outposts and smashed their front-line defenses,  which were stoutly held. It beat backward and forward in waves of high  explosives from the trench line opposite Neuve Chapelle to the second  line, opposite Fauquissart and Richebourg St. Vaast. Large numbers of  heavy guns also searched behind these defense systems for crossroads,  ammunition dumps, railways, villages, and headquarters or units, while  the Portuguese batteries were assailed with gas shells and flying steel.    The Portuguese front line was overwhelmed by the intensity of the  bombardment, and, although some of their outposts held on, fighting  gallantly to the last man, their line had to fall back to the second  system. This was attacked by enemy assault troops and between 6 and 7 in  the morning they had reached Fauquissart. The barrage lifted at 7  o'clock for a general attack on the second line. Here the strongest body  of Portuguese troops fought stubbornly, but by 11 o'clock the Germans  forced their way through to Laventie and the position round Fleurbaix  was threatened.    The Portuguese field artillery served their guns as long as possible and  destroyed the breechblocks whenever it became inevitable that they would  have to leave a gun behind. The Portuguese gunners were attached to the  British heavy batteries and behaved with special courage.      Bloody Valley of the Lys    _Thursday, April 11._--Yesterday afternoon and today the enemy exerted  all his strength in men and guns in the battle now raging from the River  Lys to Wytschaete. Once again the British are outnumbered, and it is  only by the courage and stubborn will of battalions weakened by losses  and of individual soldiers animating their comrades by acts of brave  example that the enemy has been unable to make rapid progress and, as at  Wytschaete and Messines, has been flung back with most bloody losses.    The British had to give ground along the Lys Canal south of Armentieres,  blowing bridges behind them and the railway bridge at Armentieres, and  the enemy is now trying to thrust forward south of Merville by bending  back the British line from Lestrem and getting his guns across the Lys.    This morning there was a ceaseless tumult of gunfire, loud and terrible,  over all this countryside. There were strange and terrible scenes on all  the roads leading to the battle zone where British infantry and gunners  were going forward to stem the tide. Masses of transport moved and  civilians passed them in retreat to villages outside the wide area of  shell range, and wounded men came staggering down afoot, if they could  walk, or were brought down by ambulances, threading their way through  all this surge and swell of war.    Here and there stretcher bearers waited with their burdens on the  roadsides. Among them were men of the Black Watch, with the red hackle  in their bonnets, calm and grave like statues beside their wounded  comrades lying there with white, upturned faces and never a murmur or  groan. They were the heroes who yesterday, with gallant hearts, came up  at a great pace when the enemy was in Wytschaete and Messines, and in a  fierce counterattack drove him off the crest of the ridge and dealt him  a deadly blow there on that high ground, which was won in the battle of  last June, when English, Irish, and New Zealand troops stormed the ridge  and captured thousands of prisoners.    The enemy yesterday fell in great numbers and his dead lie thick, and  though he came on wave after wave, after all his day's agony and  struggle he had not gained a yard of the crest, but was beaten back.      English in Death Struggle    _Friday, April 12._--The enemy is playing a great game in which he is  flinging all he has into the hazard of war. He has, of course, a  stupendous number of men, and, while holding his lines across the Somme  after his drive down from St. Quentin and playing a defensive part  against the French on the British right, he has moved up to the north  with secrecy and rapidity a large concentration of troops and guns for  new and tremendous blows against Haig's forces. This is continuing his  now determined policy to crush England before either France or America  is able to draw off his divisions by counteroffensives.    So now the British troops in the north are faced by enormous forces.  Nearly thirty German divisions are against them from Wytschaete to La  Bassee Canal, and with those troops are innumerable machine guns, trench  mortars, and massed batteries of field guns, very quick to get forward  in support of their infantry.    This northern offensive is as menacing as that which began to the  southward on March 21, and the gallant men among these little red brick  villages in French Flanders and in the flat fields between Bailleul and  Bethune are greatly outnumbered and can hold back the enemy only by  fighting with supreme courage.      Horrors Amid Beauty    The scene today along the line of this hostile invasion was most tragic,  because all the cruelty of war was surrounded by beauty so intense that  the contrast was horrible. The sky was of Summer blue, with sunshine  glittering on the red-tiled roofs of the cottages and on their  whitewashed walls and little windowpanes. All the hedges were clothed  with green and flaked by snow-white thorn blossoms.    In a night, as it seems, all the orchards of France have flowered, and  cherry and apple trees are in full splendor of bloom, fields are"]]]
