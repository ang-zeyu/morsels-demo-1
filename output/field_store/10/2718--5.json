When the  shout subsided, Beric added a few words, saying, that although he  regretted he had not yet come to his full strength, and that thus  early he should be called upon to lead men, he accepted the decree of  the gods, and would strive not to be wanting in the day of trial.  In matters connected with war he had learned much from the Romans,  who, oppressors as they were and despisers of the gods of Britain,  were skilled beyond all others in such matters. In all other respects  he had happily his mother's counsel and guidance to depend upon,  and before assuming any civil authority he should wait until years  had taught him wisdom, and should then go through all the usual  ceremonies appointed by their religion, and receive his instalment  solemnly in the temple at the hands of the Druids.    That night there was high feasting at Cardun. A bullock and three  swine were slain by order of Parta, and a number of great earthen  jars of mead broached, and while the principal men of the tribe  feasted in the hall, the rest made merry outside. The bard attached  to Parta's household sang tales of the glories of the tribe, even  the women from the villages and detached huts for a large circle  round came in, happy that, now the wolves had been cleared away,  they could stir out after nightfall without fear. After entertaining  their guests in the hall, Parta and her son went round among the  tribesmen outside and saw that they had all they needed, and spoke  pleasantly even to the poorest among them.    It was long before Beric closed his eyes that night. The events of  the day had been a complete surprise to him. He had thought that  in the distant future he should share with his mother in the ruling  of the tribe, but had never once dreamed of its coming for years.  Had it not been for the news that they had heard of the intended  invasion of the Holy Isle he should not have regretted his elevation,  for it would have given him the means and opportunity to train the  tribesmen to fight in close order as did the Romans. But now he could  not hope that there would be time to carry this out effectually.  He knew that throughout Britain the feeling of rage and indignation  at this outrage upon the gods of their country would raise the  passions of men to boiling point, and that the slightest incident  would suffice to bring on a general explosion, and he greatly feared  that the result of such a rising would in the end be disastrous.    His reading had shown him how great was the power of Rome, and how  obstinately she clung to her conquests. His countrymen seemed to  think that were they, with a mighty effort, to free Britain of its  invaders, their freedom would be achieved; but he knew that such a  disaster would arouse the Roman pride, and that however great the  effort required, fresh armies would be despatched to avenge the  disaster and to regain the territory lost.    \"The Britons know nothing of Roman power,\" he said to himself.  \"They see but twenty or thirty thousand men here, and they forget  that that number have alone been sent because they were sufficient  for the work, and that Rome could, if need be, despatch five times  as many men. With time to teach the people, not of the Sarci tribe  only, but all the Iceni, to fight in solid masses, and to bear the  brunt of the battle, while the rest of the tribes attacked furiously  on all sides, we might hope for victory; but fighting without  order or regularity, each man for himself, cannot hope to prevail  against their solid mass.    \"If I could have gained a name before the time came, so that my  voice might have had weight and power in the councils of the chiefs,  I might have done something. As it is, I fear that a rising now  will bring ruin and slavery upon all Britain.\"    Beric thought but little of himself, or of the personal danger he  should encounter. The Britons were careless of their lives. They  believed implicitly in a future life, and that those who fell fighting  bravely for their country would meet with reward hereafter; hence,  as among the Gauls, cowardice was an almost unknown vice.    Beric had faith in the gods of his country, while he had none  whatever in those of Rome, and wondered how a mighty people could  believe in such deities; but, unlike the Britons in general, he did  not believe that the gods interfered to decide the fate of battles.    He saw that the Romans, with their false gods, had conquered all  other nations, and that so far they had uniformly triumphed over  his own. Therefore, mighty as he believed the gods to be, he thought  that they concerned themselves but little in the affairs of the  world, and that battles were to be won solely by valour, discipline,  and numbers. Numbers and valour the British had, but of discipline  they were absolutely ignorant, and it was this that gave so tremendous  an advantage to the Romans. Hence Beric felt none of the exultation  and excitement that most British lads of his age would have done  on attaining to rank and command in the tribe to which they belonged.    The Britons despised the Romans as much for their belief in many  gods as for their luxury, and what they considered their effeminacy.  The religion of the Britons was a pure one, though disfigured by  the offering of human sacrifices. They believed in one great Supreme  Spirit, whose power pervaded everything. They thought of him less  as an absolute being than as a pervading influence. They worshipped  him everywhere, in the forests and in the streams, in the sky  and heavenly bodies. Through the Druids they consulted him in all  their undertakings. If the answer was favourable, they followed  it; if unfavourable, they endeavoured to change it by sacrifices  and offerings to the priests. They believed firmly in a life after  death, when they held that the souls of all brave and good men  and women would be transported at once to an island far out in the  Atlantic, which they called the Happy Island. The highest places  would be theirs who had fought valiantly and died in battle; but  there was room for all, and all would be happy. Holding this idea  firmly, the Britons sought rather than avoided death. Their lives  in their separate tribes were quiet and simple, except when engaged  in the chase or war. They were averse to labour. They were domestic,  virtuous, frank, and straightforward. The personal property of  a stranger was sacred among them, and the most lavish hospitality  was exercised. It was not strange that a simple hardy people,  believing firmly in the one supreme god, should have regarded with  contempt alike the luxury of the Romans and their worship of many  gods in the likenesses of men and women, and that the more Beric had  seen of the learning and wisdom of the Romans in other directions,  the more he should wonder that such a people should be slaves to  what seemed to him childish superstitions.    The next morning, after a consultation with some of the minor chiefs,  a hundred men were summoned to attend on the following day. They  were picked out from families where there were two or more males  of working age, so that there would be as little disturbance of  labour as possible. It was principally in companies of a hundred  that Beric had seen the Romans exercised, and he had learned every  order by heart from first to last. The manoeuvres to be taught were  not of a complicated nature. To form in fighting order six deep,  and to move in column, were the principal points; but when the next  day the band assembled, Beric was surprised and vexed to find that  the operations were vastly more difficult than he expected. To  begin with, every man was to have his place in the line, and the  tribesmen, though eager to learn, and anxious to please their young  chief, could not see that it mattered in what order they stood.  When, however, having arranged them at first in a line two deep,  Beric proceeded to explain how the spears were to be held, and  in what order the movements were to be performed,--the exercise  answering to the manual and platoon of modern days,--the  tribesmen were unable to restrain their laughter. What difference  could it make whether the hands were two feet apart or three, whether  the spears were held upright or sloped, whether they came down to  the charge one after another or all together? To men absolutely  unaccustomed to order of any kind, but used only to fight each in  the way that suited him best, these details appeared absolutely  ludicrous.    Beric was obliged to stop and harangue them, pointing out to them  that it was just these little things that gave the Romans their  fighting power; that it was because the whole company moved as one  man, and fought as one man, each knowing his place and falling into  it, however great the confusion, however sudden the alarm, that  made them what they were.    \"Why do they conquer you?\" he said. \"Chiefly because you can never  throw them into confusion. Charge down upon them and break them,  and they at once reunite and a solid wall opposes your scattered  efforts. You know how cattle, when wolves attack them, gather in  a circle with their horns outwards, and so keep at bay those who  could pull them down and rend them separately. At present it seems  ridiculous to you that every position of the hand, every movement  of the arm, should be done by rule; but when you have practised them  these will become a second nature; so with your other movements.  It seems folly to you to do with measured steps what it seems you  could do far more quickly by running together hastily; but it is  not so. The slowest movement is really the quickest, and it has the  advantage that no one is hurried, that everything is done steadily  and regularly, and that even in the greatest heat and confusion of  a battle every man takes his place, as calm and ready to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7050"],[0,"The Swoop! or, How Clarence Saved England: A Tale of the Great Invasion (#10)"],[1,"is an irresistible attraction about a  fight on anything like a large scale. When one considers that a quite  ordinary street-fight will attract hundreds of spectators, it will be  plainly seen that no theatrical entertainment could hope to compete  against so strong a counter-attraction as a battle between the German  and Russian armies.    The various football-grounds would be heavily hit, too. And there was  to be a monster roller-skating carnival at Olympia. That also would be  spoiled.    A deputation of amusement-caterers hurried to the two camps within an  hour of the appearance of the first evening paper. They put their case  plainly and well. The Generals were obviously impressed. Messages  passed and repassed between the two armies, and in the end it was  decided to put off the outbreak of hostilities till Monday morning.           *       *       *       *       *    Satisfactory as this undoubtedly was for the theatre-managers and  directors of football clubs, it was in some ways a pity. From the  standpoint of the historian it spoiled the whole affair. But for the  postponement, readers of this history might--nay, would--have been able  to absorb a vivid and masterly account of the great struggle, with a  careful description of the tactics by which victory was achieved. They  would have been told the disposition of the various regiments, the  stratagems, the dashing advances, the skilful retreats, and the Lessons  of the War.    As it is, owing to the mistaken good-nature of the rival generals, the  date of the fixture was changed, and practically all that a historian  can do is to record the result.    A slight mist had risen as early as four o'clock on Saturday. By  night-fall the atmosphere was a little dense, but the lamp-posts were  still clearly visible at a distance of some feet, and nobody,  accustomed to living in London, would have noticed anything much out of  the common. It was not till Sunday morning that the fog proper really  began.    London awoke on Sunday to find the world blanketed in the densest,  yellowest London particular that had been experienced for years. It was  the sort of day when the City clerk has the exhilarating certainty that  at last he has an excuse for lateness which cannot possibly be received  with harsh disbelief. People spent the day indoors and hoped it would  clear up by tomorrow.    \"They can't possibly fight if it's like this,\" they told each other.    But on the Monday morning the fog was, if possible, denser. It wrapped  London about as with a garment. People shook their heads.    \"They'll have to put it off,\" they were saying, when of a  sudden--_Boom!_ And, again, _Boom!_    It was the sound of heavy guns.    The battle had begun!           *       *       *       *       *    One does not wish to grumble or make a fuss, but still it does seem a  little hard that a battle of such importance, a battle so outstanding  in the history of the world, should have been fought under such  conditions. London at that moment was richer than ever before in  descriptive reporters. It was the age of descriptive reporters, of  vivid pen-pictures. In every newspaper office there were men who could  have hauled up their slacks about that battle in a way that would have  made a Y.M.C.A. lecturer want to get at somebody with a bayonet; men  who could have handed out the adjectives and exclamation-marks till you  almost heard the roar of the guns. And there they were--idle,  supine--like careened battleships. They were helpless. Bart Kennedy did  start an article which began, \"Fog. Black fog. And the roar of guns.  Two nations fighting in the fog,\" but it never came to anything. It was  promising for a while, but it died of inanition in the middle of the  second stick.    It was hard.    The lot of the actual war-correspondents was still worse. It was  useless for them to explain that the fog was too thick to give them a  chance. \"If it's light enough for them to fight,\" said their editors  remorselessly, \"it's light enough for you to watch them.\" And out they  had to go.    They had a perfectly miserable time. Edgar Wallace seems to have lost  his way almost at once. He was found two days later in an almost  starving condition at Steeple Bumpstead. How he got there nobody knows.  He said he had set out to walk to where the noise of the guns seemed to  be, and had gone on walking. Bennett Burleigh, that crafty old  campaigner, had the sagacity to go by Tube. This brought him to  Hampstead, the scene, it turned out later, of the fiercest operations,  and with any luck he might have had a story to tell. But the lift stuck  half-way up, owing to a German shell bursting in its neighbourhood, and  it was not till the following evening that a search-party heard and  rescued him.    The rest--A. G. Hales, Frederick Villiers, Charles Hands, and the  others--met, on a smaller scale, the same fate as Edgar Wallace. Hales,  starting for Tottenham, arrived in Croydon, very tired, with a nail in  his boot. Villiers, equally unlucky, fetched up at Richmond. The most  curious fate of all was reserved for Charles Hands. As far as can be  gathered, he got on all right till he reached Leicester Square. There  he lost his bearings, and seems to have walked round and round  Shakespeare's statue, under the impression that he was going straight  to Tottenham. After a day and a-half of this he sat down to rest, and  was there found, when the fog had cleared, by a passing policeman.    And all the while the unseen guns boomed and thundered, and strange,  thin shoutings came faintly through the darkness.          Chapter 10    THE TRIUMPH OF ENGLAND      It was the afternoon of Wednesday, September the Sixteenth. The battle  had been over for twenty-four hours. The fog had thinned to a light  lemon colour. It was raining.    By now the country was in possession of the main facts. Full details  were not to be expected, though it is to the credit of the newspapers  that, with keen enterprise, they had at once set to work to invent  them, and on the whole had not done badly.    Broadly, the facts were that the Russian army, outmanoeuvered, had been  practically annihilated. Of the vast force which had entered England  with the other invaders there remained but a handful. These, the Grand  Duke Vodkakoff among them, were prisoners in the German lines at  Tottenham.    The victory had not been gained bloodlessly. Not a fifth of the German  army remained. It is estimated that quite two-thirds of each army must  have perished in that last charge of the Germans up the Hampstead  heights, which ended in the storming of Jack Straw's Castle and the  capture of the Russian general.           *       *       *       *       *    Prince Otto of Saxe-Pfennig lay sleeping in his tent at Tottenham. He  was worn out. In addition to the strain of the battle, there had been  the heavy work of seeing the interviewers, signing autograph-books,  sitting to photographers, writing testimonials for patent medicines,  and the thousand and one other tasks, burdensome but unavoidable, of  the man who is in the public eye. Also he had caught a bad cold during  the battle. A bottle of ammoniated quinine lay on the table beside him  now as he slept.           *       *       *       *       *    As he lay there the flap of the tent was pulled softly aside. Two  figures entered. Each was dressed in a flat-brimmed hat, a coloured  handkerchief, a flannel shirt, football shorts, stockings, brown boots,  and a whistle. Each carried a hockey-stick. One, however, wore  spectacles and a look of quiet command which showed that he was the  leader.    They stood looking at the prostrate general for some moments. Then the  spectacled leader spoke.    \"Scout-Master Wagstaff.\"    The other saluted.    \"Wake him!\"    Scout-Master Wagstaff walked to the side of the bed, and shook the  sleeper's shoulder. The Prince grunted, and rolled over on to his other  side. The Scout-Master shook him again. He sat up, blinking.    As his eyes fell on the quiet, stern, spectacled figure, he leaped from  the bed.    \"What--what--what,\" he stammered. \"What's the beadig of this?\"    He sneezed as he spoke, and, turning to the table, poured out and  drained a bumper of ammoniated quinine.    \"I told the sedtry pardicularly not to let adybody id. Who are you?\"    The intruder smiled quietly.    \"My name is Clarence Chugwater,\" he said simply.    \"Jugwater? Dod't doe you frob Adab. What do you want? If you're forb  sub paper, I cad't see you now. Cub to-borrow bordig.\"    \"I am from no paper.\"    \"Thed you're wud of these photographers. I tell you, I cad't see you.\"    \"I am no photographer.\"    \"Thed what are you?\"    The other drew himself up.    \"I am England,\" he said with a sublime gesture.    \"Igglud! How do you bead you're Igglud? Talk seds.\"    Clarence silenced him with a frown.    \"I say I am England. I am the Chief Scout, and the Scouts are England.  Prince Otto, you thought this England of ours lay prone and helpless.  You were wrong. The Boy Scouts were watching and waiting. And now their  time has come. Scout-Master Wagstaff, do your duty.\"    The Scout-Master moved forward. The Prince, bounding to the bed, thrust  his hand under the pillow. Clarence's voice rang out like a trumpet.    \"Cover that man!\"    The Prince looked up. Two feet away Scout-Master Wagstaff was standing,  catapult in hand, ready to shoot.    \"He is never known to miss,\" said Clarence warningly.    The Prince wavered.    \"He has broken more windows than any other boy of his age in South  London.\"    The Prince sullenly withdrew his hand--empty.    \"Well, whad do you wad?\" he snarled.    \"Resistance is useless,\" said Clarence. \"The moment I have plotted and  planned for has come. Your troops, worn out with fighting, mere shadows  of themselves, have fallen an easy prey. An hour ago your camp was  silently surrounded by patrols of Boy Scouts, armed with catapults and"]]]
