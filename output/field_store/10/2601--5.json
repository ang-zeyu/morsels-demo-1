Besides this Andrew had the  longest eyelashes she had ever seen and she must have somebody  to say pretty things to her, even if it was not the person she  would have wished it to be.    One day things came to a crisis.    \"No more trips on the dear old boat for a month,\" Aldith remarked,  from her corner of the cabin.    \"This is appalling! Whatever do you mean, Miss MacCarthy?\" James  Graham said, with exaggerated despair in his voice.    \"Monsieur H---- has given the class a month's holiday.  He is going  to Melbourne,\" Aldith returned, with a sigh.    Meg echoed it as in duty bound, and Andrew said fiercely that  hanging was too good for Monsieur H----.  What did he mean by  such inhuman conduct, he should like to know; and however were Jim  and himself to maintain life in the meantime?    \"It was James who speedily thought of a way out.\"    \"Couldn't we go for a walk somewhere one evening--just we four?\"  he said insinuatingly.    Aldith and Andrew thought the proposal a brilliant one; and though  Meg had at first shaken her head decidedly, in the end she was  prevailed upon, and promised faithfully to go.    They were to meet in a bush paddock adjoining the far one belonging  to Misrule, to walk for about an hour, returning by half-past seven,  before it grew dusk.    \"I am going to ask you for something that day, Meg,\" Andrew whispered  just as they were parting.  \"I wonder if I shall get it.\"    Meg flushed in her nervous, conscious way, and wondered to herself  for a moment whether he intended to ask for a lock of her hair, a  thing Graham had already obtained from Aldith.    \"What?\" she said unwillingly.    \"A kiss,\" he whispered.    The next minute the others had joined them, and there was no chance  for the indignant answer that trembled on her lips.  She had even  to shake hands, to appear as if nothing had happened, and to part  apparently good friends.    \"Half-past six sharp, Marguerite.  I will never forgive you if you  don't come,\" Aldith said, as they parted at her gate.    \"I--you--Oh, Aldith, I don't see how I can come,\" Meg faltered,  the crimson in her cheeks again.  \"I've never done anything like it  before.  I'm sure it's not right.\"    But the curl, in Aldith's lip made her ashamed of herself.    \"You're just twelve, Marguerite;\" the young lady said calmly:  \"you're not a bit more than twelve.  You'd better get a roll again,  and a picture-book with morals.  I'll ask Andrew to buy you one  and a bit of cord, too, to tie you in your high chair in the  nursery.\"    Such sarcasm was too much for Meg.  She promised hastily and  unconditionally to be on the spot at the time mentioned, and fled  away up the path to obey the summons of the wildly clanging  tea-bell.    But for the two intervening days her secret hung upon her like a  burden of guilt, and she longed inexpressibly for a confidante  who would advise her what to do at this distressing issue.  Not  Judy: that young person was too downright, too sensible, too much  of a child and a boy--she would never dare to tell her anything of  the sort.   She could fancy the scorn in her sister's large clear  eyes, the ringing laughter such a tale would evoke, the scathing,  clever ridicule that would fall on her shrinking shoulders.  Not  Esther: her very position as stepmother precluded such an idea,  and, besides that, the General's gums were gradually disclosing  wee white double pearls, and his health thereby was affected,  and causing her too much anxiety to allow her, to notice Meg's  oppression of mind.    By the night decided upon, the child had worked herself up into a  strong state of excitement.  Half-past six was the time settled  upon, and, as she knew, it was broad daylight even then.  She  felt she really dare not, could not go.  Suppose her father or  Esther, some of her scornful young sisters or brothers, should  be about and see the meeting, or any of the neighbours--why, she  could never survive the shame of it!  Yet go she must, or Aldith  would despise her.  Besides, she had made up her mind fully to tell  Andrew plainly she could not allow him to talk to her as he had  been doing.  After that last terrible whisper, she felt it  necessary that she should let him understand clearly that she did  not approve of his conduct, and would be \"his friend,\" but  nothing more.    But why had they not thought of deciding on an hour when it would  be darker? she kept saying to herself: there would be no danger  of being seen then; she could slip out of the house without any  difficulty, and run through the paddocks under cover of the  kindly dusk; whereas if it was light, and she tried to creep away,  at least two or three of the children would fly after her and  offer generously to \"come too.\"    At last, too afraid to go in the light, and unwilling for Aldith  to reproach her for not going at all, she did in her excitement  and desperation a thing so questionable that for long after she  could not think of it without horror.      \"Dear Mr. Courtney,\" she wrote, sitting down at her dressing-table,  and scribbling away hurriedly in pencil:    \"It would be horrid going for the walk so early.  Let us go later,  when it is quite dark.  It will be EVER so much nicer, for no one  will be able to see us.  And let us meet at the end of the paddocks  where the bush grows thickly, it will be more private.  I am writing  to Aldith to tell her to go at that time, she will tell Mr. Graham.    Yours sincerely,  M. Woolcot.    \"P.S.--I must ask you, please, not to kiss me.  I should be very  angry indeed if you did.  I don't like kissing at all.\"      She wrote the last paragraph in a nervous hurry for she had a dread  that he might fulfil his promise, if she did not forbid him as soon  as they met.  Then she slipped it into an envelope and addressed it  to A. Courtney, Esq., it never having even occurred to her for a  moment that there was anything at all strange or unconventional in  a young girl making such a point that the meeting should be in the  dark.    Next she wrote a few lines of explanation to Aldith, and told her  to be sure to be in the paddock by half-past eight, and she (Meg)  would slip out when the children were going to bed and unlikely  to notice.    And then she went out into the garden to find messengers for  her two notes.  Little Flossie Courtney had been spending the  afternoon with Nellie, and Meg called her back from the gate  just as she was going home, and, unseen by the children, entrusted  the note to her.    \"'Give it to your brother Andrew the minute he comes from school,\"  she whispered, popping a big chocolate at the same time into  the little girl's mouth.  Bunty was next bribed, with a promise of  the same melting delicacies, to run up to Aldith's with the other  letter, and Meg breathed freely ago feeling she had skilfully  averted the threatening danger attendant on the evening  meeting.    But surely the notes were fated!  Bunty delivered his safely  enough to the housemaid at the MacCarthys', and in answer to  the girl's question \"s'posed there was an answer, girls always  'spected one to nothing.\"    Aldith was confined to her room with a sudden severe cold, and  wrote a note to her friend, telling her how she was too ill to be  allowed out, and had written to Mr. Graham, and Mr. Courtney,  too, postponing the walk for a week.    Now this note, in its pale pink triangular envelope, was  transferred to Bunty's pocket among his marbles and peanuts and  string.  And, as might be expected, he fell in with some other  choice spirits on the return journey, and was soon on his knees  by the roadside playing marbles.    He lost ten, exclusive of his best agate, fought a boy who had  unlawfully possessed himself of his most cherished \"conny,\" and  returned home with saddened spirits an hour later, only to find  as he went through the gate that he had lost Aldith's dainty  little note.    Now Meg had promised him eight chocolate walnuts on his return,  and if this same boy had one weakness more pronounced than others,  it was his extreme partiality for this kind of confectionery, and  he had not tasted one for weeks, so no wonder it almost broke his  heart to think they would be forfeited.    \"I know she'll be stingy enough to say I haven't earned them, just  'cause I dropped that girl's stupid letter,\" he said to himself,  miserably, \"and I don't suppose there was anything in it but  'Dearest Marguerite, let us always tell each other our secrets';  I heard her say that twice, and of course she writes it, too.\"  Then temptation came upon him swiftly, suddenly.    By nature Bunty was the most arrant little storyteller ever born,  and it was only Judy's fearless honesty and strongly expressed  scorn for equivocation that had kept him moderately truthful.  But Judy was miles away, and could not possibly wither him up  with her look of utter contempt.  He was at the nursery door now,  turning the handle with hesitating hands.    \"What a time you've been,\" said Meg from the table, where she was  mending a boxful of her gloves.  \"Well, what did she say?\"    Just at her elbow was the gay _bonbonniere_ containing the brown,  cream-encrusted walnuts.    \"She said, 'All right,'\" said Bunty gruffly.    Meg counted the eight chocolates out into his little grimy hand,  and resumed her mending with a relieved sigh.  And Bunty, with a  defiant, shamed look in his eyes, stuffed the whole of the  sweets into his mouth at once, as if to preclude the possibility  of a sudden repentance.    The other note was equally unfortunate.  Little Flossie went  home, her thoughts intent upon a certain Grannie bonnet Nell  had promised to make for her new doll.    \"Gween with pink stwings,\" she was saying softly to herself as  she climbed the steps to her own door.    Alan was lying on the veranda lounge, smoking his black pipe.    \"Gween what?\"  he laughed--\"guinea-pigs or kangaroos?"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47316"],[0,"New Witnesses for God (Volume 2 of 3) (#10)"],[1,"indeed must be this whole volume of scripture, the Book of  Mormon! Containing not fifty, but many hundred words spoken by Jesus!  Containing also an account of the hand dealings of God with the people  inhabiting the western hemisphere, from earliest times to the fourth  century after Christ. Wherein also are found his revelations to those  peoples; his messages by angels sent directly from his presence to  declare his word to them; his instructions, admonitions, reproofs,  and warnings to them through men inspired by his Holy Spirit; and  last of all, the account of Messiah's appearance and ministry among  the people, his very words repeated, and rightly divided for us (as  we shall see later), that we may the better understand what of his  teaching is general, and what special; what universal and permanent,  and what local and transcient. How insignificant all the discoveries in  Egypt, in ancient Babylon, Palestine, and the Sinaitic Peninsula are  in comparison with this New Witness of the western world? How paltry,  valuable though they are in themselves, seem the Rosetta stone, the  Moabite stone, and the library of brick tablets from old Nineveh, in  comparison with this Nephite record--this volume of scripture! How  feeble the voice of the testimony of those monuments of the east to the  authenticity and credibility of the Bible and the truth of the gospel,  in comparison with the testimony found in the Book of Mormon--the  voice of departed nations and empires of people speaking through their  records for the truth of God--for the verity of the gospel of Jesus  Christ--a voice sufficient to overwhelm unbelief and forever make sure  the foundations of faith! It was mainly for this purpose that the  Nephite records were written, preserved, and finally brought forth to  the world, as we shall see in the following chapter.    Footnotes    1.

THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH THE BOOK OF MORMON WAS WRITTEN.    The several purposes for which the Book of Mormon was written are to be  learned from the writers of the book itself, and from the revelations  of God to Joseph Smith.    First I introduce the statement of Moroni, into whose hands Mormon's  abridgment of the larger records of the Nephites, called the _Book of  Mormon_, was given. On the last plate of the collection given to Moroni  by his father, on the left hand side of the collection, the language  of the whole book running as in the Hebrew, from right to left, Moroni  engraved the following explanatory title to the record he sealed up,  and therein also stated the reasons why the record was written. This  Joseph Smith translated and made the title page of his translation of  the Book of Mormon:        THE BOOK OF MORMON        An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon, Upon Plates Taken From      the Plates of Nephi.        Wherefore, it is an abridgment of the record of the people of      Nephi, and also of the Lamanites--Written to the Lamanites      who are a remnant of the house of Israel; and also to Jew and      Gentile--Written by way of commandment, and also by the spirit of      prophecy and of revelation--Written and sealed up, and hid up unto      the Lord, that they might not be destroyed--To come forth by the      gift and power of God unto the interpretation thereof--Sealed by      the hand of Moroni, and hid up unto the Lord, to come forth in due      time by way of Gentile--The interpretation thereof by the gift of      God.        An abridgment taken from the Book of Ether also, which is a record      of the people of Jared, who were scattered at the time the Lord      confounded the language of the people, when they were building a      tower to get to heaven--which is to show unto the remnant of the      house of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their      fathers; and that they may know the covenants of the Lord, that      they are not cast off forever--and also to the convincing of      the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God,      manifesting, himself unto all nations--And now if there are faults      they are the mistakes of men; wherefore, condemn not the things of      God, that ye may be found spotless at the judgment-seat of Christ.    In the above, three reasons are given why the Book of Mormon was  written and preserved to come forth among men in the last days:    First, to show unto the remnant of the House of Israel what great  things the Lord has done for their fathers.    Second, to teach them the covenants of the Lord made with their  fathers, that the remnants may know that they are not cast off forever.    Third, that this record may convince both Jew and gentile that Jesus  is the Christ, the Eternal God, and that he manifests himself to all  nations.    In a revelation given to Joseph Smith in July, 1828, on the occasion of  the Urim and Thummim being restored to him after it had been taken from  him in consequence of allowing Martin Harris to have a portion of the  manuscript of the Book of Mormon, contrary to the will of God, the Lord  said to him:        My work shall go forth, for inasmuch as the knowledge of a Savior      has come unto the world, through the testimony of the Jews, even      so shall the knowledge of a Savior come unto my people--and to the      Nephites, and the Jacobites, and the Josephites, and the Zoramites,      through the testimony of their fathers--And this testimony shall      come to the knowledge of the Lamanites, and the Lemuelites, and      Ishmaelites who dwindled in unbelief because of the iniquity of      their fathers, whom the Lord has suffered to destroy their brethren      the Nephites, because of their iniquities and their abominations.      And for this very purpose are these plates preserved, which contain      these records--that the promise of the Lord might be fulfilled,      which he made to his people; and that the Lamanites might come      to the knowledge of their fathers, and that they might know the      promises of the Lord, and that they may believe the gospel and rely      upon the merits of Jesus Christ, and be glorified through faith in      his name, and that through their repentance they might be saved. [1]    In this passage we have substantially the same reasons given why the  Book of Mormon was written, though not stated in the same order, but as  follows:    First, that a knowledge of a Savior might come unto the remnants of the  house of Israel in the western hemisphere, who are called Nephites,  Jacobites, Josephites, Lamanites, etc.    Second, that the Lamanites might come to a knowledge of their fathers.    Third, that the Lamanites might know the promises of the Lord, both to  their fathers and to themselves.    Mormon also left upon record his testimony as to why the book which  bears his name was written, and why it would be preserved and come  forth in the last days. In his own book, by which I mean that book in  which he wrote the things which he saw in his own day, Mormon says:        Now these things are written unto the remnant of the house of      Jacob; * * * and behold, they shall come forth according to the      commandment of the Lord, when he shall see fit, in his wisdom. And      behold, they shall go unto the unbelieving of the Jews; and for      this intent shall they go--that they may be persuaded that Jesus is      the Christ, the Son of the living God; that the Father may bring      about, through his most Beloved, his great and eternal purpose,      in restoring the Jews, or all the house of Israel, to the land of      their inheritance, which the Lord their God hath given them, unto      the fulfilling of his covenant; and also that the seed of this      people [2] may more fully believe his gospel, which shall go forth      unto them from the Gentiles. [3]    Again, this same writer, Mormon, addressing himself to the remnants of  the Lamanites to whom, in the future, his record would come, says:        \"Know ye that ye must come to a knowledge of your fathers, and      repent of all your sins and iniquities, and believe in Jesus      Christ, that he is the Son of God, and that he was slain by      the Jews, and by the power of the Father he hath risen again,      whereby he hath gained the victory over the grave; and also in      him is the sting of death swallowed up. And he bringeth to pass      the resurrection of the dead, whereby man must be raised to      stand before his judgment-seat. And he hath brought to pass the      redemption of the world, whereby he that is found guiltless before      him at the judgment day hath it given unto him to dwell in the      presence of God in his Kingdom, to sing ceaseless praises with the      choirs above, unto the Father, and unto the Son, and unto the Holy      Ghost, which are one God, in a state of happiness which hath no"]]]
