[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42"],[0,"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (#10)"],[1," might suppose, after this  preface, that I am going to ask you for something dishonourable  to grant. Judge for yourself.    \"I want you to postpone all other engagements for to-night--ay,  even if you were summoned to the bedside of an emperor; to take a  cab, unless your carriage should be actually at the door; and  with this letter in your hand for consultation, to drive straight  to my house. Poole, my butler, has his orders; you will find, him  waiting your arrival with a locksmith. The door of my cabinet is  then to be forced: and you are to go in alone; to open the glazed  press (letter E) on the left hand, breaking the lock if it be  shut; and to draw out, with all its contents as they stand, the  fourth drawer from the top or (which is the same thing) the third  from the bottom. In my extreme distress of wind, I have a morbid  fear of misdirecting you; but even if I am in error, you may know  the right drawer by its contents: some powders, a phial and a  paper book. This drawer I beg of you to carry back with you to  Cavendish Square exactly as it stands.    \"That is the first part of the service: now for the second. You  should be back, if you set out at once on the receipt of this,  long before midnight; but I will leave you that amount of margin,  not only in the fear of one of those obstacles that can neither  be prevented nor fore-    72)    seen, but because an hour when your servants are in bed is to be  preferred for what will then remain to do. At midnight, then, I  have to ask you to be alone in your consulting-room, to admit  with your own hand into the house a man who will present himself  in my name, and to place in his hands the drawer that you will  have brought with you from my cabinet. Then you will have played  your part and earned my gratitude completely. Five minutes  afterwards, if you insist upon an explanation, you will have  understood that these arrangements are of capital importance; and  that by the neglect of one of them, fantastic as they must  appear, you might have charged your conscience with my death or  the shipwreck of my reason.    \"Confident as I am that you will not trifle with this appeal, my  heart sinks and my hand trembles at the bare thought of such a  possibility. Think of me at this hour, in a strange place,  labouring under a blackness of distress that no fancy can  exaggerate, and yet well aware that, if you will but punctually  serve me, my troubles will roll away like a story that is told.  Serve me, my dear Lanyon, and save                                         \"Your friend,                                                \"H. J.    \"P. S. I had already sealed this up when a fresh terror struck  upon my soul. It is possible that the postoffice may fail me, and  this letter    73)    not come into your hands until to-morrow morning. In that case,  dear Lanyon, do my errand when it shall be most convenient for  you in the course of the day; and once more expect my messenger  at midnight. It may then already be too late; and if that night  passes without event, you will know that you have seen the last  of Henry Jekyll.\"      Upon the reading of this letter, I made sure my colleague was  insane; but till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubt,  I felt bound to do as he requested. The less I understood of this  farrago, the less I was in a position to judge of its importance;  and an appeal so worded could not be set aside without a grave  responsibility. I rose accordingly from table, got into a hansom,  and drove straight to Jekyll's house. The butler was awaiting my  arrival; he had received by the same post as mine a registered  letter of instruction, and had sent at once for a locksmith and a  carpenter. The tradesmen came while we were yet speaking; and we  moved in a body to old Dr. Denman's surgical theatre, from which  (as you are doubtless aware) Jekyll's private cabinet is most  conveniently entered. The door was very strong, the lock  excellent; the carpenter avowed he would have great trouble and  have to do much damage, if force were to be used; and the  locksmith was near despair. But this last was a handy fellow,    74)    and after two hours' work, the door stood open. The press marked  E was unlocked; and I took out the drawer, had it filled up with  straw and tied in a sheet, and returned with it to Cavendish  Square.    Here I proceeded to examine its contents. The powders were neatly  enough made up, but not with the nicety of the dispensing  chemist; so that it was plain they were of Jekyll's private  manufacture; and when I opened one of the wrappers I found what  seemed to me a simple crystalline salt of a white colour. The  phial, to which I next turned my attention, might have been about  half-full of a blood-red liquor, which was highly pungent to the  sense of smell and seemed to me to contain phosphorus and some  volatile ether. At the other ingredients I could make no guess.  The book was an ordinary version-book and contained little but a  series of dates. These covered a period of many years, but I  observed that the entries ceased nearly a year ago and quite  abruptly. Here and there a brief remark was appended to a date,  usually no more than a single word: \"double\" occurring perhaps  six times in a total of several hundred entries; and once very  early in the list and followed by several marks of exclamation,  \"total failure!!!\" All this, though it whetted my curiosity, told  me little that was definite. Here were a phial of some tincture,  a paper of some salt, and the record of a series of experi-    75)    ments that had led (like too many of Jekyll's investigations) to  no end of practical usefulness. How could the presence of these  articles in my house affect either the honour, the sanity, or the  life of my flighty colleague? If his messenger could go to one  place, why could he not go to another? And even granting some  impediment, why was this gentleman to be received by me in  secret? The more I reflected the more convinced I grew that I was  dealing with a case of cerebral disease: and though I dismissed  my servants to bed, I loaded an old revolver, that I might be  found in some posture of self-defence.    Twelve o'clock had scarce rung out over London, ere the knocker  sounded very gently on the door. I went myself at the summons,  and found a small man crouching against the pillars of the  portico.    \"Are you come from Dr. Jekyll?\" I asked.    He told me \"yes\" by a constrained gesture; and when I had bidden  him enter, he did not obey me without a searching backward glance  into the darkness of the square. There was a policeman not far  off, advancing with his bull's eye open; and at the sight, I  thought my visitor started and made greater haste.    These particulars struck me, I confess, disagreeably; and as I  followed him into the bright light of the consulting-room, I kept  my hand ready on my weapon. Here, at last, I had a    76)    chance of clearly seeing him. I had never set eyes on him before,  so much was certain. He was small, as I have said; I was struck  besides with the shocking expression of his face, with his  remarkable combination of great muscular activity and great  apparent debility of constitution, and--last but not least--  with the odd, subjective disturbance caused by his neighbourhood.  This bore some resemblance to incipient rigour, and was  accompanied by a marked sinking of the pulse. At the time, I set  it down to some idiosyncratic, personal distaste, and merely  wondered at the acuteness of the symptoms; but I have since had  reason to believe the cause to lie much deeper in the nature of  man, and to turn on some nobler hinge than the principle of  hatred.    This person (who had thus, from the first moment of his entrance,  struck in me what I can only describe as a disgustful curiosity)  was dressed in a fashion that would have made an ordinary person  laughable; his clothes, that is to say, although they were of  rich and sober fabric, were enormously too large for him in every  measurement--the trousers hanging on his legs and rolled up to  keep them from the ground, the waist of the coat below his  haunches, and the collar sprawling wide upon his shoulders.  Strange to relate, this ludicrous accoutrement was far from  moving me to laughter. Rather, as there was something abnormal  and misbe-    77)    gotten in the very essence of the creature that now faced me--  something seizing, surprising, and revolting--this fresh  disparity seemed but to fit in with and to reinforce it; so that  to my interest in the man's nature and character, there was added  a curiosity as to his origin, his life, his fortune and status in  the world.    These observations, though they have taken so great a space to be  set down in, were yet the work of a few seconds. My visitor was,  indeed, on fire with sombre excitement.    \"Have you got it?\" he cried. \"Have you got it?\" And so lively was  his impatience that he even laid his hand upon my arm and sought  to shake me.    I put him back, conscious at his touch of a certain icy pang  along my blood. \"Come, sir,\" said I. \"You forget that I have not  yet the pleasure of your acquaintance. Be seated, if you please.\"  And I showed him an example, and sat down myself in my customary  seat and with as fair an imitation of my ordinary manner to a  patient, as the lateness of the hour, the nature of my  pre-occupations, and the horror I had of my visitor, would suffer  me to muster.    \"I beg your pardon, Dr. Lanyon,\" he replied civilly enough. \"What  you say is very well founded; and my impatience has shown its  heels to my politeness. I come here at the instance of your  colleague, Dr. Henry Jekyll, on a piece of business of some  moment; and I under-    78)    stood...\" He paused and put his hand to his throat, and I could  see, in spite of his collected manner, that he was wrestling  against the approaches of the hysteria--\"I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/420"],[0,"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz (#10)"],[1,"pushed back from the  table, and this was so astonishing and mysterious that Dorothy was  almost tempted to run away in fright.    \"Here are strangers, mama!\" cried the shrill and childish voice of some  unseen person.    \"So I see, my dear,\" answered another voice, soft and womanly.    \"What do you want?\" demanded a third voice, in a stern, gruff accent.    \"Well, well!\" said the Wizard; \"are there really people in this room?\"    \"Of course,\" replied the man's voice.    \"And--pardon me for the foolish question--but, are you all invisible?\"    \"Surely,\" the woman answered, repeating her low, rippling laughter.  \"Are you surprised that you are unable to see the people of Voe?\"    \"Why, yes,\" stammered the Wizard.  \"All the people I have ever met  before were very plain to see.\"    \"Where do you come from, then?\" asked the woman, in a curious tone.    \"We belong upon the face of the earth,\" explained the Wizard, \"but  recently, during an earthquake, we fell down a crack and landed in the  Country of the Mangaboos.\"    \"Dreadful creatures!\" exclaimed the woman's voice.  \"I've heard of  them.\"    \"They walled us up in a mountain,\" continued the Wizard; \"but we found  there was a tunnel through to this side, so we came here.  It is a  beautiful place.  What do you call it?\"    \"It is the Valley of Voe.\"    \"Thank you.  We have seen no people since we arrived, so we came to  this house to enquire our way.\"    \"Are you hungry?\" asked the woman's voice.    \"I could eat something,\" said Dorothy.    \"So could I,\" added Zeb.    \"But we do not wish to intrude, I assure you,\" the Wizard hastened to  say.    \"That's all right,\" returned the man's voice, more pleasantly than  before.  \"You are welcome to what we have.\"    As he spoke the voice came so near to Zeb that he jumped back in alarm.  Two childish voices laughed merrily at this action, and Dorothy was  sure they were in no danger among such light-hearted folks, even if  those folks couldn't be seen.    \"What curious animal is that which is eating the grass on my lawn?\"  enquired the man's voice.    \"That's Jim,\" said the girl.  \"He's a horse.\"    \"What is he good for?\" was the next question.    \"He draws the buggy you see fastened to him, and we ride in the buggy  instead of walking,\" she explained.    \"Can he fight?\" asked the man's voice.    \"No! he can kick pretty hard with his heels, and bite a little; but Jim  can't 'zactly fight,\" she replied.    \"Then the bears will get him,\" said one of the children's voices.    \"Bears!\" exclaimed Dorothy.  \"Are these bears here?\"    \"That is the one evil of our country,\" answered the invisible man.  \"Many large and fierce bears roam in the Valley of Voe, and when they  can catch any of us they eat us up; but as they cannot see us, we  seldom get caught.\"    \"Are the bears invis'ble, too?\" asked the girl.    \"Yes; for they eat of the dama-fruit, as we all do, and that keeps them  from being seen by any eye, whether human or animal.\"    \"Does the dama-fruit grow on a low bush, and look something like a  peach?\" asked the Wizard.    \"Yes,\" was the reply.    \"If it makes you invis'ble, why do you eat it?\" Dorothy enquired.    \"For two reasons, my dear,\" the woman's voice answered.  \"The  dama-fruit is the most delicious thing that grows, and when it makes us  invisible the bears cannot find us to eat us up.  But now, good  wanderers, your luncheon is on the table, so please sit down and eat as  much as you like.\"          9.  They Fight the Invisible Bears      The strangers took their seats at the table willingly enough, for they  were all hungry and the platters were now heaped with good things to  eat.  In front of each place was a plate bearing one of the delicious  dama-fruit, and the perfume that rose from these was so enticing and  sweet that they were sorely tempted to eat of them and become invisible.    But Dorothy satisfied her hunger with other things, and her companions  did likewise, resisting the temptation.    \"Why do you not eat the damas?\" asked the woman's voice.    \"We don't want to get invis'ble,\" answered the girl.    \"But if you remain visible the bears will see you and devour you,\" said  a girlish young voice, that belonged to one of the children.  \"We who  live here much prefer to be invisible; for we can still hug and kiss  one another, and are quite safe from the bears.\"    \"And we do not have to be so particular about our dress,\" remarked the  man.    \"And mama can't tell whether my face is dirty or not!\" added the other  childish voice, gleefully.    \"But I make you wash it, every time I think of it,\" said the mother;  \"for it stands to reason your face is dirty, Ianu, whether I can see it  or not.\"    Dorothy laughed and stretched out her hands.    \"Come here, please--Ianu and your sister--and let me feel of you,\" she  requested.    They came to her willingly, and Dorothy passed her hands over their  faces and forms and decided one was a girl of about her own age and the  other a boy somewhat smaller.  The girl's hair was soft and fluffy and  her skin as smooth as satin.  When Dorothy gently touched her nose and  ears and lips they seemed to be well and delicately formed.    \"If I could see you I am sure you would be beautiful,\" she declared.    The girl laughed, and her mother said:    \"We are not vain in the Valley of Voe, because we can not display our  beauty, and good actions and pleasant ways are what make us lovely to  our companions.  Yet we can see and appreciate the beauties of nature,  the dainty flowers and trees, the green fields and the clear blue of  the sky.\"    \"How about the birds and beasts and fishes?\" asked Zeb.    \"The birds we cannot see, because they love to eat of the damas as much  as we do; yet we hear their sweet songs and enjoy them.  Neither can we  see the cruel bears, for they also eat the fruit.  But the fishes that  swim in our brooks we can see, and often we catch them to eat.\"    \"It occurs to me you have a great deal to make you happy, even while  invisible,\" remarked the Wizard.  \"Nevertheless, we prefer to remain  visible while we are in your valley.\"    Just then Eureka came in, for she had been until now wandering outside  with Jim; and when the kitten saw the table set with food she cried out:    \"Now you must feed me, Dorothy, for I'm half starved.\"    The children were inclined to be frightened by the sight of the small  animal, which reminded them of the bears; but Dorothy reassured them by  explaining that Eureka was a pet and could do no harm even if she  wished to.  Then, as the others had by this time moved away from the  table, the kitten sprang upon the chair and put her paws upon the cloth  to see what there was to eat.  To her surprise an unseen hand clutched  her and held her suspended in the air.  Eureka was frantic with terror,  and tried to scratch and bite, so the next moment she was dropped to  the floor.    \"Did you see that, Dorothy?\" she gasped.    \"Yes, dear,\" her mistress replied; \"there are people living in this  house, although we cannot see them.  And you must have better manners,  Eureka, or something worse will happen to you.\"    She placed a plate of food upon the floor and the kitten ate greedily.    \"Give me that nice-smelling fruit I saw on the table,\" she begged, when  she had cleaned the plate.    \"Those are damas,\" said Dorothy, \"and you must never even taste them,  Eureka, or you'll get invis'ble, and then we can't see you at all.\"    The kitten gazed wistfully at the forbidden fruit.    \"Does it hurt to be invis'ble?\" she asked.    \"I don't know,\" Dorothy answered; \"but it would hurt me dre'fully to  lose you.\"    \"Very well, I won't touch it,\" decided the kitten; \"but you must keep  it away from me, for the smell is very tempting.\"    \"Can you tell us, sir or ma'am,\" said the Wizard, addressing the air  because he did not quite know where the unseen people stood, \"if there  is any way we can get out of your beautiful Valley, and on top of the  Earth again.\"    \"Oh, one can leave the Valley easily enough,\" answered the man's voice;  \"but to do so you must enter a far less pleasant country.  As for  reaching the top of the earth, I have never heard that it is possible  to do that, and if you succeeded in getting there you would probably  fall off.\"    \"Oh, no,\" said Dorothy, \"we've been there, and we know.\"    \"The Valley of Voe is certainly a charming place,\" resumed the Wizard;  \"but we cannot be contented in any other land than our own, for long.  Even if we should come to unpleasant places on our way it is necessary,  in order to reach the earth's surface, to keep moving on toward it.\"    \"In that case,\" said the man, \"it will be best for you to cross our  Valley and mount the spiral staircase inside the Pyramid Mountain.  The  top of that mountain is lost in the clouds, and when you reach it you  will be in the awful Land of Naught, where the Gargoyles live.\"    \"What are Gargoyles?\" asked Zeb.    \"I do not know, young sir.  Our greatest Champion, Overman-Anu, once  climbed the spiral stairway and fought nine days with the Gargoyles  before he could escape them and come back; but he could never be  induced to describe the dreadful creatures, and soon afterward a bear  caught him and ate him up.\"    The wanders were rather discouraged by this gloomy report, but Dorothy  said with a sigh:    \"If the only way to get home is to meet the Gurgles, then we've got to  meet 'em.  They can't be worse than the Wicked Witch or the Nome King.\"    \"But you must remember you had the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman to  help you conquer those enemies,\" suggested the Wizard.  \"Just now, my  dear, there is not a single warrior in your company.\"    \"Oh, I guess Zeb could fight if he had to.  Couldn't you, Zeb?\" asked  the little girl.    \"Perhaps; if I had to,\" answered Zeb, doubtfully.    \"And you have the jointed sword that you chopped the veg'table Sorcerer  in two with,\" the girl said to the little man.    \"True,\" he replied; \"an"]]]
