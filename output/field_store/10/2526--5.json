He was about fourteen years of age, bore  the name of Paulino, and was son to a Roman burgess, who lived upon the  income of his property. Paulino was the best-mannered, the most honest,  and the most beautiful boy I ever saw in my whole life. His modest ways  and actions, together with his superlative beauty and his devotion to  myself, bred in me as great an affection for him as a mans breast can  hold. This passionate love led me oftentimes to delight the lad with  music; for I observed that his marvellous features, which by complexion  wore a tone of modest melancholy, brightened up, and when I took my  cornet, broke into a smile so lovely and so sweet, that I do not marvel  at the silly stories which the Greeks have written about the deities of  heaven. Indeed, if my boy had lived in those times, he would probably  have turned their heads still more. [1] He had a sister, named Faustina,  more beautiful, I verily believe, than that Faustina about whom the old  books gossip so. Sometimes he took me to their vineyard, and, so far as  I could judge, it struck me that Paulinos good father would have  welcomed me as a son-in-law. This affair led me to play more than I was  used to do.    It happened at that time that one Giangiacomo of Cesena, a musician in  the Popes band, and a very excellent performer, sent word through  Lorenzo, the trumpeter of Lucca, who is now in our Dukes service, to  inquire whether I was inclined to help them at the Popes Ferragosto,  playing soprano with my cornet in some motets of great beauty selected  by them for that occasion. [2] Although I had the greatest desire to  finish the vase I had begun, yet, since music has a wondrous charm of  its own, and also because I wished to please my old father, I consented  to join them. During eight days before the festival we practised two  hours a day together; then on the first of August we went to the  Belvedere, and while Pope Clement was at table, we played those  carefully studied motets so well that his Holiness protested he had  never heard music more sweetly executed or with better harmony of parts.  He sent for Giangiacomo, and asked him where and how he had procured so  excellent a cornet for soprano, and inquired particularly who I was.  Giangiacomo told him my name in full. Whereupon the Pope said: So,  then, he is the son of Maestro Giovanni? On being assured I was, the  Pope expressed his wish to have me in his service with the other  bandsmen. Giangiacomo replied: Most blessed Father, I cannot pretend  for certain that you will get him, for his profession, to which he  devotes himself assiduously, is that of a goldsmith, and he works in it  miraculously well, and earns by it far more than he could do by  playing. To this the Pope added: I am the better inclined to him now  that I find him possessor of a talent more than I expected. See that he  obtains the same salary as the rest of you; and tell him from me to join  my service, and that I will find work enough by the day for him to do in  his other trade. Then stretching out his hand, he gave him a hundred  golden crowns of the Camera in a handkerchief, and said: [3] Divide  these so that he may take his share.    When Giangiacomo left the Pope, he came to us, and related in detail all  that the Pope had said; and after dividing the money between the eight  of us, and giving me my share, he said to me: Now I am going to have  you inscribed among our company. I replied: Let the day pass;  to-morrow I will give my answer. When I left them, I went meditating  whether I ought to accept the invitation, inasmuch as I could not but  suffer if I abandoned the noble studies of my art. The following night  my father appeared to me in a dream, and begged me with tears of  tenderest affection, for Gods love and his, to enter upon this  engagement. Methought I answered that nothing would induce me to do so.  In an instant he assumed so horrible an aspect as to frighten me out of  my wits, and cried: If you do not, you will have a fathers curse; but  if you do, may you be ever blessed by me! When I woke, I ran, for very  fright, to have myself inscribed. Then I wrote to my old father, telling  him the news, which so affected him with extreme joy that a sudden fit  of illness took him, and well-nigh brought him to deaths door. In his  answer to my letter, he told me that he too had dreamed nearly the same  as I had.    Note 1. 'Gli Arebbe fatti più uscire de gangheri;' would have taken  them still more off the hinges.    Note 2. Lit., the largest piece left of me should be my ears.    Note 3. The Camera Apostolica was the Roman Exchequer.    XXIV    KNOWING now that I had gratified my fathers honest wish, I began to  think that everything would prosper with me to a glorious and honourable  end. Accordingly, I set myself with indefatigable industry to the  completion of the vase I had begun for Salamanca. That prelate was a  very extraordinary man, extremely rich, but difficult to please. He sent  daily to learn what I was doing; and when his messenger did not find me  at home, he broke into fury, saying that he would take the work out of  my hands and give it to others to finish. This came of my slavery to  that accursed music. Still I laboured diligently night and day, until,  when I had brought my work to a point when it could be exhibited, I  submitted it to the inspection of the Bishop. This so increased his  desire to see it finished that I was sorry I had shown it. At the end of  three months I had it ready, with little animals and foliage and masks,  as beautiful as one could hope to see. No sooner was it done than I sent  it by the hand of my workman, Paulino, to show that able artist  Lucagnolo, of whom I have spoken above. Paulino, with the grace and  beauty which belonged to him, spoke as follows: Messer Lucagnolo,  Benvenuto bids me say that he has sent to show you his promises and your  lumber, expecting in return to see from you his gewgaws. This message  given, Lucagnolo took up the vase, and carefully examined it; then he  said to Paulino: Fair boy, tell your master that he is a great and able  artist, and that I beg him to be willing to have me for a friend, and  not to engage in aught else. The mission of that virtuous and  marvellous lad caused me the greatest joy; and then the vase was carried  to Salamanca, who ordered it to be valued. Lucagnolo took part in the  valuation, estimating and praising it far above my own opinion.  Salamanca, lifting up the vase, cried like a true Spaniard: I swear by  God that I will take as long in paying him as he has lagged in making  it. When I heard this, I was exceedingly put out, and fell to cursing  all Spain and every one who wished well to it.    Amongst other beautiful ornaments, this vase had a handle, made all of  one piece, with most delicate mechanism, which, when a spring was  touched, stood upright above the mouth of it. While the prelate was one  day ostentatiously exhibiting my vase to certain Spanish gentlemen of  his suite, it chanced that one of them, upon Monsignors quitting the  room, began roughly to work the handle, and as the gentle spring which  moved it could not bear his loutish violence, it broke in his hand.  Aware what mischief he had done, he begged the butler who had charge of  the Bishops plate to take it to the master who had made it, for him to  mend, and promised to pay what price he asked, provided it was set to  rights at once. So the vase came once more into my hands, and I promised  to put it forthwith in order, which indeed I did. It was brought to me  before dinner; and at twenty-two oclock the man who brought it  returned, all in a sweat, for he had run the whole way, Monsignor having  again asked for it to show to certain other gentlemen. [1] The butler,  then, without giving me time to utter a word, cried: Quick, quick,  bring the vase. I, who wanted to act at leisure and not to give up to  him, said that I did not mean to be so quick. The serving-man got into  such a rage that he made as though he would put one hand to his sword,  while with the other he threatened to break the shop open. To this I put  a stop at once with my own weapon, using therewith spirited language,  and saying: I am not going to give it to you! Go and tell Monsignor,  your master, that I want the money for my work before I let it leave  this shop. When the fellow saw he could not obtain it by swaggering, he  fell to praying me, as one prays to the Cross, declaring that if I would  only give it up, he would take care I should be paid. These words did  not make me swerve from my purpose; but I kept on saying the same thing.  At last, despairing of success, he swore to come with Spaniards enough  to cut me in pieces. Then he took to his heels; while I, who inclined to  believe partly in their murderous attack, resolved that I would defend  myself with courage. So I got an admirable little gun ready, which I  used for shooting game, and muttered to myself: He who robs me of my  property and labour may take my life too, and welcome. While I was  carrying on this debate in my own mind, a crowd of Spaniards arrived,  led by their major-domo, who, with the headstrong rashness of his race,  bade them go in and take the vase and give me a good beating. Hearing  these words, I showed them the muzzle of my gun, and prepared to fire,  and cried in a loud voice: Renegade Jews, traitors, is it thus that one  breaks into houses and shops in our city of Rome? Come as many of you  thieves as like, an inch nearer to this wicket, and Ill blow all their  brains out with my gun. Then I turned the muzzle toward their  major-domo, and making as though I would discharge it, called out: And  you big thief, who are egging them on, I mean to kill you first. He  clapped spurs to the jennet he was riding, and took flight"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4035"],[0,"Greek Studies: a Series of Essays (#10)"],[1,"way maintained  throughout, and concentrated on the central figure.  \"He is sweet  among the mountains,\" they say, \"when he drops down upon the plain,  out of his mystic musings\"--and we may think we see the green  festoons of the vine dropping quickly, from foot-place to foot-place,  down the broken hill-side in spring, when like the Bacchanals, all  who can, wander out of the town to enjoy the earliest heats.  \"Let us  go out into the fields,\" we say; a strange madness seems to lurk  among the flowers, ready to lay hold on us also; autika ga pasa  choreusei+--soon the whole earth will dance and sing.    Dionysus is especially a woman's deity, and he comes from the east  conducted by a chorus of gracious Lydian women, his true sisters--  Bassarids, clad like himself in the long tunic, or bassara.  They  move and speak to the music of clangorous metallic instruments,  cymbals and tambourines, relieved by the clearer notes of the pipe;  and there is a strange variety of almost imitative sounds for such  music, in their very [65] words.  The Homeric hymn to Demeter  precedes the art of sculpture, but is rich in suggestions for it;  here, on the contrary, in the first chorus of the Bacchanals, as  elsewhere in the play, we feel that the poetry of Euripides is  probably borrowing something from art; that in these choruses, with  their repetitions and refrains, he is reproducing perhaps the spirit  of some sculptured relief which, like Luca della Robbia's celebrated  work for the organ-loft of the cathedral of Florence, worked by  various subtleties of line, not in the lips and eyes only, but in the  drapery and hands also, to a strange reality of impression of musical  effect on visible things.    They beat their drums before the palace; and then a humourous little  scene, a reflex of the old Dionysiac comedy--of that laughter which  was an essential element of the earliest worship of Dionysus--follows  the first chorus.  The old blind prophet Teiresias, and the aged king  Cadmus, always secretly true to him, have agreed to celebrate the  Thiasus, and accept his divinity openly.  The youthful god has  nowhere said decisively that he will have none but young men in his  sacred dance.  But for that purpose they must put on the long tunic,  and that spotted skin which only rustics wear, and assume the thyrsus  and ivy-crown.  Teiresias arrives and is seen knocking at the doors.  And then, just as in the medieval mystery, comes the [66] inevitable  grotesque, not unwelcome to our poet, who is wont in his plays,  perhaps not altogether consciously, to intensify by its relief both  the pity and the terror of his conceptions.  At the summons of  Teiresias, Cadmus appears, already arrayed like him in the appointed  ornaments, in all their odd contrast with the infirmity and staidness  of old age.  Even in old men's veins the spring leaps again, and they  are more than ready to begin dancing.  But they are shy of the  untried dress, and one of them is blind--poi dei choreuein; poi  kathistanai poda; kai krata seisai polion;+ and then the difficulty  of the way! the long, steep journey to the glens! may pilgrims boil  their peas? might they proceed to the place in carriages?  At last,  while the audience laugh more or less delicately at their aged  fumblings, in some co-operative manner, the eyes of the one combining  with the hands of the other, the pair are about to set forth.    Here Pentheus is seen approaching the palace in extreme haste.  He  has been absent from home, and returning, has just heard of the state  of things at Thebes--the strange malady of the women, the dancings,  the arrival of the mysterious stranger: he finds all the women  departed from the town, and sees Cadmus and Teiresias in masque.  Like the exaggerated diabolical figures in some of the religious  plays and imageries of the Middle Age, he is an impersonation of  stupid impiety, one of those whom the gods willing to [67] destroy  first infatuate.  Alternating between glib unwisdom and coarse  mockery, between violence and a pretence of moral austerity, he  understands only the sorriest motives; thinks the whole thing  feigned, and fancies the stranger, so effeminate, so attractive of  women with whom he remains day and night, but a poor sensual  creature, and the real motive of the Bacchic women the indulgence of  their lust; his ridiculous old grandfather he is ready to renounce,  and accuses Teiresias of having in view only some fresh source of  professional profit to himself in connexion with some new-fangled  oracle; his petty spite avenges itself on the prophet by an order to  root up the sacred chair, where he sits to watch the birds for  divination, and disturb the order of his sacred place; and even from  the moment of his entrance the mark of his doom seems already set  upon him, in an impotent trembling which others notice in him.  Those  of the women who still loitered, he has already caused to be shut up  in the common prison; the others, with Ino, Autonoe, and his own  mother, Agave, he will hunt out of the glens; while the stranger is  threatened with various cruel forms of death.  But Teiresias and  Cadmus stay to reason with him, and induce him to abide wisely with  them; the prophet fittingly becomes the interpreter of Dionysus, and  explains the true nature of the visitor; his divinity, the completion  or counterpart of that of Demeter; his gift of prophecy; [68] all the  soothing influences he brings with him; above all, his gift of the  medicine of sleep to weary mortals.  But the reason of Pentheus is  already sickening, and the judicial madness gathering over it.  Teiresias and Cadmus can but \"go pray.\"  So again, not without the  laughter of the audience, supporting each other a little grotesquely  against a fall, they get away at last.    And then, again, as in those quaintly carved and coloured imageries  of the Middle Age--the martyrdom of the youthful Saint Firmin, for  instance, round the choir at Amiens--comes the full contrast, with a  quite medieval simplicity and directness, between the insolence of  the tyrant, now at last in sight of his prey, and the outraged beauty  of the youthful god, meek, surrounded by his enemies, like some fair  wild creature in the snare of the hunter.  Dionysus has been taken  prisoner; he is led on to the stage, with his hands bound, but still  holding the thyrsus.  Unresisting he had submitted himself to his  captors; his colour had not changed; with a smile he had bidden them  do their will, so that even they are touched with awe, and are almost  ready to admit his divinity.  Marvellously white and red, he stands  there; and now, unwilling to be revealed to the unworthy, and  requiring a fitness in the receiver, he represents himself, in answer  to the inquiries of Pentheus, not as Dionysus, but simply as the  god's prophet, [69] in full trust in whom he desires to hear his  sentence.  Then the long hair falls to the ground under the shears;  the mystic wand is torn from his hand, and he is led away to be tied  up, like some dangerous wild animal, in a dark place near the king's  stables.    Up to this point in the play, there has been a noticeable ambiguity  as to the person of Dionysus, the main figure of the piece; he is in  part Dionysus, indeed; but in part, only his messenger, or minister  preparing his way; a certain harshness of effect in the actual  appearance of a god upon the stage being in this way relieved, or  made easy, as by a gradual revelation in two steps.  To Pentheus, in  his invincible ignorance, his essence remains to the last unrevealed,  and even the women of the chorus seem to understand in him, so far,  only the forerunner of their real leader.  As he goes away bound,  therefore, they too, threatened also in their turn with slavery,  invoke his greater original to appear and deliver them.  In pathetic  cries they reproach Thebes for rejecting them--ti m' anainei, ti me  pheugeis;+ yet they foretell his future greatness; a new Orpheus, he  will more than renew that old miraculous reign over animals and  plants.  Their song is full of suggestions of wood and river.  It is  as if, for a moment, Dionysus became the suffering vine again; and  the rustle of the leaves and water come through their words to  refresh it.  The [70] fountain of Dirce still haunted by the virgins  of Thebes, where the infant god was cooled and washed from the flecks  of his fiery birth, becomes typical of the coolness of all springs,  and is made, by a really poetic licence, the daughter of the distant  Achelous--the earliest born, the father in myth, of all Greek rivers.    A giddy sonorous scene of portents and surprises follows--a distant,  exaggerated, dramatic reflex of that old thundering tumult of the  festival in the vineyard--in which Dionysus reappears, miraculously  set free from his bonds.  First, in answer to the deep-toned  invocation of the chorus, a great voice is heard from within,  proclaiming him to be the son of Semele and Zeus.  Then, amid the  short, broken, rapturous cries of the women of the chorus,  proclaiming him master, the noise of an earthquake passes slowly; the  pillars of the palace are seen waving to and fro; while the strange,  memorial fire from the tomb of Semele blazes up and envelopes the  whole building.  The terrified women fling themselves on the ground;  and then, at last, as the place is shaken open, Dionysus is seen  stepping out from among the tottering masses of the mimic palace,  bidding them arise and fear not.  But just here comes a long pause in  the action of the play, in which we must listen to a messenger newly  arrived from the glens, to tell us what he has seen there, among the  Maenads.  The singular, somewhat sinister beauty of this speech, and  a [71] similar one subsequent--a fair description of morning on the  mountain-tops, with the Bacchic women sleeping, which turns suddenly  to a hard, coarse picture of animals"]]]
