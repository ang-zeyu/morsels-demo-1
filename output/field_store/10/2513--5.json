A homeless Andalusian, dinnerless and in rags, strums  on his guitar, a necessity which he would not dream of selling for  such a mere luxury as bread, and is happy. There is always sun to  sleep in. There are always piquant faces and gliding forms to gaze  after. What more does a mortal want? Exquisite Seville! No wonder that  her exiled sons still sing, after years of \"comfortable living\" in  foreign cities:--         \"When I am missing, hunt me down         In Andalusia's purple light,       Where all the beauties are so brown,         And all the wits so bright.\"    Yet the old Arabian enchantment casts a glamour which the Anglo-Saxon  vision dimly recognizes as such and faintly strives against. To the  clear survey all is not charm. Grace, mirth, and music, on the one  hand, are offset by ignorance, suffering, and vice on the other. Many  evil things were told us, and some ugly things we saw, but to look on  Andalusia is to love her, even while realizing that to live with her  would put that love to a very stringent test.    The lordly Guadalquivir, for instance, so fair to see from the  picture-making summit of the Giralda, as he lingers through his  blooming Paradise, forgetful of the ocean, is not altogether goodly.         \"Ay, ay, the black and stinging flies he breeds       To plague the decent body of mankind!\"    The Andalusian leisure was a perpetual delight to us. A typical  Seville shop reaches far along the street front, with many open doors,  and a counter running the full length. Here ladies sit in pairs and  groups, never singly, to cheapen fans and mantillas, while the smiling  salesmen, cigarette in hand, shrug and gesticulate and give back  banter for banter as gayly as if it were all a holiday frolic. Scraps  of the graceful bargaining would float to our ears.    \"Is the quality good?\"    \"As good as God's blessing.\"    Among the tempting wares of Seville are Albacete knives, with gorgeous  handles of inlaid ebony, tortoise, or ivory. The peasant women of  Andalusia so resent the charge of carrying these knives in their  garters that the Seville gamin dodges offence by asking them in an  unnecessarily loud voice if they carry garters in their knives. The  irascible dames do not stand upon fine points of rhetoric, however,  and when the small boy has delivered his shot, he does well to take to  his heels. We once saw one of these sturdy women, while a line of  soldiers, bristling with steel, was holding a street, seize a gallant  son of Mars by the shoulder and swing him, amid the laughter of his  comrades, out of her path as if he were a cabbage. Nobody knew how to  stop her, and she trudged serenely on, her broad back to those  helpless bayonets, down the forbidden way.    The beggars of Seville are gentler than those of Ronda and Granada,  but hardly less numerous. Mendicant figures are thick as Guadalquivir  mosquitoes in my memory of Andalusia. Some of those pitiful children  will haunt me till I die. There was a forlorn urchin, with filmy,  frightful eyes, to be seen in all weathers crouching on one side of  the road leading up to the Alhambra, so dull and dreary a little  fellow that he hardly grasped the coppers when they were thrust into  his weakly groping hands, and hardly stayed his monotonous formula of  entreaty for his other monotonous formula of thanks. There was an  idiot child in Seville--a mere lump of deformity--that would rush out  upon the startled stranger with an inarticulate, fierce little yell,  clutching at charity with a tiny, twisted claw. He seemed the very  incarnation of childish woe and wrong. Almost every hand dived into  pocket for him, and he was probably worth far more to his proprietors  than his rival on the street, a crafty little girl, with the most  lustrous eyes that painter ever dreamed. They were not blue nor gray,  but a living light in which both those colors had been melted.    The economists, who say so firmly that \"nothing should ever be given  to mendicant children,\" can hardly have had the experience of seeing  Murillo's own cherubs, their wings hidden under the dirt, fluttering  about the car windows at Andalusian stations. I have it still on my  conscience that I occasionally gave away my comrade's share of our  luncheon as well as my own. She was too young and too polite to  reproach me, but too hungry to be comforted by the assurance that I  reproached myself. Sometimes a foreign traveller, very sure of his  Spanish, would attempt remonstrance with these small nuisances. I  remember one kindly Teuton in particular. Commerce had claimed him for  its own, but the predestined German professor shone out of his mild  blue eyes. A ragamuffin had mounted the car steps to beg at the  window, and Mein Herr delivered him such a lecture that the youngster  clung to his perch, fascinated with astonishment at the novel  doctrine, until the train was in alarmingly swift motion.      [Illustration: THE ALHAMBRA. HALL OF JUSTICE]    \"This is a very bad habit of thine. I told thee so a month ago.\"    \"Me, sir?\"    \"Thee, boy. When I passed over this road last, thou wert begging at  the windows, to my shame if not to thine. Tut, tut! Go thy ways. Look  for work, work, work.\"    \"Work, sir?\"    \"Work, boy. And when thou hast found it, love it, and do it with a  will. Learn to read and write. Wash thy face and change thy customs,  and when thou art richer than I, then will I give thee a _peseta_.\"    Mendicancy is bred of ignorance, and in the seventeen and a half  millions that make up the population of Spain, more than twelve  millions do not read nor write.    Seville sight-seeing is no brief matter. You must climb the Giralda,  walk in the parks, view the yellowed fragments of the ancient city  wall, visit the tobacco factory, shop in _Las Sierpes_, buy pottery in  Triana, see the gypsy dances in the cafes, attend the Thursday  rag-fair, do reverence to the Columbus manuscripts in the _Biblioteca  Columbina_, look up the haunts of Don Juan, Figaro, Pedro the Cruel,  and explore the curious \"House of Pilate,\" which, tradition says, was  built by a pilgrim noble after the Jerusalem pattern. You must lose  your heart to the Alcazar, the Alhambra of Seville, a storied palace  embowered in fountain-freshened gardens of palm and magnolia, oranges  and cypresses, rose and myrtle, with shadowy arcades leading to marble  baths and arabesqued pavilions. You must follow Murillo from gallery  to gallery, from church to church, above all, from the _Hospital de la  Caridad_, where hang six of his greatest compositions, to the _Museo  Provincial_, where over a score of the Master's sacred works, lovely  Virgins, longing saints, deep-eyed Christ-Childs, rain their sweet  influence. And first, last, and always, there is the cathedral. We had  been stunned at Burgos, blind to all save the Moorish features of  Cordova, almost untouched by the cold splendors of Granada, but to  Seville, as later to Toledo, we surrendered utterly. Beauty, mystery,  sublimity--these are Seville cathedral. Five centuries have gone to  the rearing and enriching of those solemn aisles and awful choir. The  colossal structure, second in size only to St. Peter's, is a majesty  before which Luther himself might well have trembled. Within a Spanish  cathedral one begins to understand the mighty hold of Roman  Catholicism on Spain. \"I love,\" says Alarcon, whose jest and earnest  are as closely twined as fibres of the same heart, \"the clouds of  incense which rise to the cupola of the Catholic temple, amid the  harmonies of the holy organ. (For this I am not a Protestant.)\" And  elsewhere, writing of his childhood, he speaks of receiving in the  cathedral of Guadix all his first impressions of artistic  beauty,--beauty of architecture, music, painting, processional  splendors, tissue of gold and silver, cunning embroideries and  jewel-work, his first sense, in short, of poetry. And all these  impressions were inextricably blent with his first yearnings of holy  aspiration, his first passion of mystical devotion. But not even  Seville cathedral could win over our full sympathy. Too heavy were the  faces of the priests who \"sang the gori gori,\" too selfish that wigged  and jointed doll, \"Our Lady of Kings,\" with her sixty gorgeous  mantles, a few of which would have clothed all the poor of Andalusia.  Who shall draw the line between faith and superstition?    But let not the tourist suppose he can escape his tyrant Baedeker even  at the top of the Giralda. There are excursions that must be taken to  points of interest outside the city. Most imperative of all is the  trip to the ruined Roman amphitheatre of Italica, guarded by the  mighty names of Scipio Africanus, Trajan, Hadrian, and Theodosius. Off  we start, a dozen strong, in a great, open carriage, all the  women-folk with fans and veils and with flowers in the hair. We rattle  past the cathedral, over the bridge to Triana and out into the  sweet-breathed country, passing many a picturesque group on the  road,--these two peasants, for example, with their yellow-handled  knives thrust into scarlet girdles, tossing dice under a fig tree. Our  meditations among the crumbling blocks of that savage play-house would  perhaps interest the reader less than our luncheon. Such Andalusian  dainties as we swallowed,--cold soups like melted salads, home-made  fig marmalade, cinnamon pastes of which the gypsies know the secret,  and sugared chestnuts overflowed by a marvellous syrup wherein could  be detected flavors of lemon peel, orange peel, and a medley of  spices! In that scene of ancient bloodshed, of the lion's wrath and  the martyr's anguish, we ate, drank, and were merry, but our banquet  tasted of ghosts.          VI    PASSION WEEK IN SEVILLE         \"All that was gracious was bestowed by the Virgin, and she was    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38777"],[0,"Lad: A Dog (#10)"],[1,"k. It struck for the thin knee, not ten inches away  from its own coiled body. The child screamed again in mortal terror.    Before the scream could leave the fear-chalked lips, Baby was knocked  flat by a mighty and hairy shape that lunged across her toward her  foe.    And the copperhead's fangs sank deep in Lad's nose.    He gave no sign of pain; but leaped back. As he sprang his jaws caught  Baby by the shoulder. The keen teeth did not so much as bruise her  soft flesh as he half-dragged, half-threw her into the grass behind  him.    Athwart the rug again, Lad launched himself bodily upon the coiled  snake.    As he charged, the swift-striking fangs found a second mark--this time  in the side of his jaw.    An instant later the copperhead lay twisting and writhing and  thrashing impotently among the grassroots; its back broken, and its  body seared almost in two by a slash of the dog's saber-like tusk.    The fight was over. The menace was past. The child was safe.    And, in her rescuer's muzzle and jaw were two deposits of mortal  poison.    Lad stood panting above the prostrate and crying Baby. His work was  done; and instinct told him at what cost. But his idol was unhurt and  he was happy. He bent down to lick the convulsed little face in mute  plea for pardon for his needful roughness toward her.    But he was denied even this tiny consolation. Even as he leaned  downward he was knocked prone to earth by a blow that all but  fractured his skull.    At the child's first terrified cry, her mother had turned back.  Nearsighted and easily confused, she had seen only that the dog  had knocked her sick baby flat, and was plunging across her body.  Next, she had seen him grip Baby's shoulder with his teeth and  drag her, shrieking, along the ground.    That was enough. The primal mother-instinct (that is sometimes almost  as strong in woman as in lioness--or cow), was aroused. Fearless of  danger to herself, the guest rushed to her child's rescue. As she ran  she caught her thick parasol by the ferule and swung it aloft.    Down came the agate-handle of the sunshade on the head of the dog. The  handle was as large as a woman's fist, and was composed of a single  stone, set in four silver claws.    As Lad staggered to his feet after the terrific blow felled him, the  impromptu weapon arose once more in air, descending this time on his  broad shoulders.    Lad did not cringe--did not seek to dodge or run--did not show his  teeth. This mad assailant was a woman. Moreover, she was a guest, and  as such, sacred under the Guest Law which he had mastered from  puppyhood.    Had a man raised his hand against Lad--a man other than the Master or  a guest--there would right speedily have been a case for a hospital,  if not for the undertaker. But, as things now were, he could not  resent the beating.    His head and shoulders quivered under the force and the pain of the  blows. But his splendid body did not cower. And the woman, wild with  fear and mother-love, continued to smite with all her random strength.    Then came the rescue.    At the first blow the child had cried out in fierce protest at her  pet's ill-treatment. Her cry went unheard.    \"Mother!\" she shrieked, her high treble cracked with anguish. \"Mother!  Don't! _Don't!_ He kept the snake from eating me! He----!\"    The frantic woman still did not heed. Each successive blow seemed to  fall upon the little onlooker's own bare heart. And Baby, under the  stress, went quite mad.    Scrambling to her feet, in crazy zeal to protect her beloved playmate,  she tottered forward three steps, and seized her mother by the skirt.    At the touch the woman looked down. Then her face went yellow-white;  and the parasol clattered unnoticed to the ground.    For a long instant the mother stood thus; her eyes wide and glazed,  her mouth open, her cheeks ashy--staring at the swaying child who  clutched her dress for support and who was sobbing forth incoherent  pleas for the dog.    The Master had broken into a run and into a flood of wordless  profanity at sight of his dog's punishment. Now he came to an abrupt  halt and was glaring dazedly at the miracle before him.    The child had risen and had walked.    The child had _walked!_--she whose lower motive-centers, the wise  doctors had declared, were hopelessly paralyzed--she who could never  hope to twitch so much as a single toe or feel any sensation from the  hips downward!    Small wonder that both guest and Master seemed to have caught, for the  moment, some of the paralysis that so magically departed from the  invalid!    And yet--as a corps of learned physicians later agreed--there was no  miracle--no magic--about it. Baby's was not the first, nor the  thousandth case in pathologic history, in which paralyzed sensory  powers had been restored to their normal functions by means of a  shock.    The child had had no malformation, no accident, to injure the spine or  the co-ordination between limbs and brain. A long illness had left her  powerless. Country air and new interest in life had gradually built  up wasted tissues. A shock had re-established communication between  brain and lower body--a communication that had been suspended; not  broken.    When, at last, there was room in any of the human minds for aught but  blank wonder and gratitude, the joyously weeping mother was made to  listen to the child's story of the fight with the snake--a story  corroborated by the Master's find of the copperhead's half-severed  body.    \"I'll--I'll get down on my knees to that heaven-sent dog,\" sobbed the  guest, \"and apologize to him. Oh, I wish some of you would beat me as  I beat him! I'd feel so much better! Where is he?\"    The question brought no answer. Lad had vanished. Nor could eager  callings and searchings bring him to view. The Master, returning from  a shout-punctuated hunt through the forest, made Baby tell her story  all over again. Then he nodded.    \"I understand,\" he said, feeling a ludicrously unmanly desire to  cry. \"I see how it was. The snake must have bitten him, at least  once. Probably oftener, and he knew what that meant. Lad knows  everything--_knew_ everything, I mean. If he had known a little less  he'd have been human. But--if he'd been human, he probably wouldn't  have thrown away his life for Baby.\"    \"Thrown away his life,\" repeated the guest. \"I--I don't understand.  Surely I didn't strike him hard enough to----\"    \"No,\" returned the Master, \"but the snake did.\"    \"You mean, he has----?\"    \"I mean it is the nature of all animals to crawl away, alone, into the  forest to die. They are more considerate than we. They try to cause no  further trouble to those they have loved. Lad got his death from the  copperhead's fangs. He knew it. And while we were all taken up with  the wonder of Baby's cure, he quietly went away--to die.\"    The Mistress got up hurriedly, and left the room. She loved the great  dog, as she loved few humans. The guest dissolved into a flood of  sloppy tears.    \"And I beat him,\" she wailed. \"I beat him--horribly! And all the time  he was dying from the poison he had saved my child from! Oh, I'll  never forgive myself for this, the longest day I live.\"    \"The longest day is a long day,\" drily commented the Master. \"And  self-forgiveness is the easiest of all lessons to learn. After all,  Lad was only a dog. That's why he is dead.\"    The Place's atmosphere tingled with jubilation over the child's  cure. Her uncertain, but always successful, efforts at walking were an  hourly delight.    But, through the general joy, the Mistress and the Master could not  always keep their faces bright. Even the guest mourned frequently,  and loudly, and eloquently the passing of Lad. And Baby was openly  inconsolable at the loss of her chum.    At dawn on the morning of the fourth day, the Master let himself  silently out of the house, for his usual before-breakfast cross-country  tramp--a tramp on which, for years, Lad had always been his companion.  Heavy-hearted, the Master prepared to set forth alone.    As he swung shut the veranda door behind him, Something arose stiffly  from a porch rug--Something the Master looked at in a daze of  unbelief.    It was a dog--yet no such dog as had ever before sullied the cleanness  of The Place's well-scoured veranda.    The animal's body was lean to emaciation. The head was swollen--though,  apparently, the swelling had begun to recede. The fur, from spine  to toe, from nose to tail-tip, was one solid and shapeless mass of  caked mud.    The Master sat down very suddenly on the veranda floor beside the  dirt-encrusted brute, and caught it in his arms, sputtering disjointedly:    \"Lad!--_Laddie!_--Old _friend!_ You're alive again!  You're--you're--_alive!_\"    Yes, Lad had known enough to creep away to the woods to die. But,  thanks to the wolf-strain in his collie blood, he had also known how  to do something far wiser than die.    Three days of self-burial, to the very nostrils, in the mysteriously  healing ooze of the marshes, behind the forest, had done for him what  such mud-baths have done for a million wild creatures. It had drawn  out the viper-poison and had left him whole again--thin, shaky on the  legs, slightly swollen of head--but _whole_.    \"He's--he's awfully dirty, though! Isn't he?\" commented the guest,  when an idiotic triumph-yell from the Master had summoned the whole  family, in sketchy attire, to the veranda. \"Awfully dirty and----\"    \"Yes,\" curtly assented the Master, Lad's head between his caressing  hands. \"'Awfully dirty.' That's why he's still alive.\"          CHAPTER IV    HIS LITTLE SON      Lad's mate Lady was the only one of the Little People about The Place  who refused to look on Lad with due reverence. In her frolic-moods she  teased him unmercifully; in a prettily imperious way she bossed and  bullied him--for all of which Lad adored her. He had other reasons,  too, for loving Lady--not only because she was"]]]
