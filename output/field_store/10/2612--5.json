When I am wound up I do my du-ty  by go-ing just as my ma-chin-er-y is made to go.  You have no i-de-a  how full of ma-chin-er-y I am.\"    \"I can guess,\" said the Scarecrow, looking at the machine man  curiously.  \"Some day I'd like to take you apart and see just how you  are made.\"    \"Do not do that, I beg of you,\" said Tiktok; \"for you could not put me  to-geth-er a-gain, and my use-ful-ness would be de-stroyed.\"    \"Oh! are you useful?\" asked the Scarecrow, surprised.    \"Ve-ry,\" said Tiktok.    \"In that case,\" the Scarecrow kindly promised, \"I won't fool with your  interior at all.  For I am a poor mechanic, and might mix you up.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Tiktok.    Just then Ozma re-entered the room, leading Dorothy by the hand and  followed closely by the Princess Langwidere.          8.  The Hungry Tiger      The first thing Dorothy did was to rush into the embrace of the  Scarecrow, whose painted face beamed with delight as he pressed her  form to his straw-padded bosom.  Then the Tin Woodman embraced  her--very gently, for he knew his tin arms might hurt her if he  squeezed too roughly.    These greetings having been exchanged, Dorothy took the key to Tiktok  from her pocket and wound up the machine man's action, so that he could  bow properly when introduced to the rest of the company.  While doing  this she told them how useful Tiktok had been to her, and both the  Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman shook hands with the machine once more  and thanked him for protecting their friend.    Then Dorothy asked: \"Where is Billina?\"    \"I don't know,\" said the Scarecrow.  \"Who is Billina?\"    \"She's a yellow hen who is another friend of mine,\" answered the girl,  anxiously.  \"I wonder what has become of her?\"    \"She is in the chicken house, in the back yard,\" said the Princess.  \"My drawing-room is no place for hens.\"    Without waiting to hear more Dorothy ran to get Billina, and just  outside the door she came upon the Cowardly Lion, still hitched to the  chariot beside the great Tiger.  The Cowardly Lion had a big bow of  blue ribbon fastened to the long hair between his ears, and the Tiger  wore a bow of red ribbon on his tail, just in front of the bushy end.    In an instant Dorothy was hugging the huge Lion joyfully.    \"I'm SO glad to see you again!\" she cried.    \"I am also glad to see you, Dorothy,\" said the Lion.  \"We've had some  fine adventures together, haven't we?\"    \"Yes, indeed,\" she replied.  \"How are you?\"    \"As cowardly as ever,\" the beast answered in a meek voice.  \"Every  little thing scares me and makes my heart beat fast.  But let me  introduce to you a new friend of mine, the Hungry Tiger.\"    \"Oh!  Are you hungry?\" she asked, turning to the other beast, who was  just then yawning so widely that he displayed two rows of terrible  teeth and a mouth big enough to startle anyone.    \"Dreadfully hungry,\" answered the Tiger, snapping his jaws together  with a fierce click.    \"Then why don't you eat something?\" she asked.    \"It's no use,\" said the Tiger sadly.  \"I've tried that, but I always  get hungry again.\"    \"Why, it is the same with me,\" said Dorothy.  \"Yet I keep on eating.\"    \"But you eat harmless things, so it doesn't matter,\" replied the Tiger.  \"For my part, I'm a savage beast, and have an appetite for all sorts of  poor little living creatures, from a chipmunk to fat babies.\"    \"How dreadful!\" said Dorothy.    \"Isn't it, though?\" returned the Hungry Tiger, licking his lips with  his long red tongue.  \"Fat babies!  Don't they sound delicious?  But  I've never eaten any, because my conscience tells me it is wrong.  If I  had no conscience I would probably eat the babies and then get hungry  again, which would mean that I had sacrificed the poor babies for  nothing.  No; hungry I was born, and hungry I shall die.  But I'll not  have any cruel deeds on my conscience to be sorry for.\"    \"I think you are a very good tiger,\" said Dorothy, patting the huge  head of the beast.    \"In that you are mistaken,\" was the reply.  \"I am a good beast,  perhaps, but a disgracefully bad tiger.  For it is the nature of tigers  to be cruel and ferocious, and in refusing to eat harmless living  creatures I am acting as no good tiger has ever before acted.  That is  why I left the forest and joined my friend the Cowardly Lion.\"    \"But the Lion is not really cowardly,\" said Dorothy.  \"I have seen him  act as bravely as can be.\"    \"All a mistake, my dear,\" protested the Lion gravely.  \"To others I may  have seemed brave, at times, but I have never been in any danger that I  was not afraid.\"    \"Nor I,\" said Dorothy, truthfully. \"But I must go and set free Billina,  and then I will see you again.\"    She ran around to the back yard of the palace and soon found the  chicken house, being guided to it by a loud cackling and crowing and a  distracting hubbub of sounds such as chickens make when they are  excited.    Something seemed to be wrong in the chicken house, and when Dorothy  looked through the slats in the door she saw a group of hens and  roosters huddled in one corner and watching what appeared to be a  whirling ball of feathers.  It bounded here and there about the chicken  house, and at first Dorothy could not tell what it was, while the  screeching of the chickens nearly deafened her.    But suddenly the bunch of feathers stopped whirling, and then, to her  amazement, the girl saw Billina crouching upon the prostrate form of a  speckled rooster.  For an instant they both remained motionless, and  then the yellow hen shook her wings to settle the feathers and walked  toward the door with a strut of proud defiance and a cluck of victory,  while the speckled rooster limped away to the group of other chickens,  trailing his crumpled plumage in the dust as he went.    \"Why, Billina!\" cried Dorothy, in a shocked voice; \"have you been  fighting?\"    \"I really think I have,\" retorted Billina.  \"Do you think I'd let that  speckled villain of a rooster lord it over ME, and claim to run this  chicken house, as long as I'm able to peck and scratch?  Not if my name  is Bill!\"    \"It isn't Bill, it's Billina; and you're talking slang, which is very  undig'n'fied,\" said Dorothy, reprovingly.  \"Come here, Billina, and  I'll let you out; for Ozma of Oz is here, and has set us free.\"    So the yellow hen came to the door, which Dorothy unlatched for her to  pass through, and the other chickens silently watched them from their  corner without offering to approach nearer.    The girl lifted her friend in her arms and exclaimed:    \"Oh, Billina! how dreadful you look.  You've lost a lot of feathers,  and one of your eyes is nearly pecked out, and your comb is bleeding!\"    \"That's nothing,\" said Billina.  \"Just look at the speckled rooster!  Didn't I do him up brown?\"    Dorothy shook her head.    \"I don't 'prove of this, at all,\" she said, carrying Billina away  toward the palace.  \"It isn't a good thing for you to 'sociate with  those common chickens.  They would soon spoil your good manners, and  you wouldn't be respec'able any more.\"    \"I didn't ask to associate with them,\" replied Billina.  \"It is that  cross old Princess who is to blame.  But I was raised in the United  States, and I won't allow any one-horse chicken of the Land of Ev to  run over me and put on airs, as long as I can lift a claw in  self-defense.\"    \"Very well, Billina,\" said Dorothy.  \"We won't talk about it any more.\"    Soon they came to the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger to whom the  girl introduced the Yellow Hen.    \"Glad to meet any friend of Dorothy's,\" said the Lion, politely.  \"To  judge by your present appearance, you are not a coward, as I am.\"    \"Your present appearance makes my mouth water,\" said the Tiger, looking  at Billina greedily.  \"My, my! how good you would taste if I could only  crunch you between my jaws.  But don't worry.  You would only appease  my appetite for a moment; so it isn't worth while to eat you.\"    \"Thank you,\" said the hen, nestling closer in Dorothy's arms.    \"Besides, it wouldn't be right,\" continued the Tiger, looking steadily  at Billina and clicking his jaws together.    \"Of course not,\" cried Dorothy, hastily.  \"Billina is my friend, and  you mustn't ever eat her under any circ'mstances.\"    \"I'll try to remember that,\" said the Tiger; \"but I'm a little  absent-minded, at times.\"    Then Dorothy carried her pet into the drawing-room of the palace, where  Tiktok, being invited to do so by Ozma, had seated himself between the  Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman.  Opposite to them sat Ozma herself and  the Princess Langwidere, and beside them there was a vacant chair for  Dorothy.    Around this important group was ranged the Army of Oz, and as Dorothy  looked at the handsome uniforms of the Twenty-Seven she said:    \"Why, they seem to be all officers.\"    \"They are, all except one,\" answered the Tin Woodman.  \"I have in my  Army eight Generals, six Colonels, seven Majors and five Captains,  besides one private for them to command.  I'd like to promote the  private, for I believe no private should ever be in public life; and  I've also noticed that officers usually fight better and are more  reliable than common soldiers.  Besides, the officers are more  important looking, and lend dignity to our army.\"    \"No doubt you are right,\" said Dorothy, seating herself beside Ozma.    \"And now,\" announced the girlish Ruler of Oz, \"we will hold a solemn  conference to decide the best manner of liberating the royal family of  this fair Land of Ev from their long imprisonment.\"          9.  The Royal Family of Ev      The Tin Woodman was the first to address the meeting.    \"To begin with,\" said he, \"word came to our noble and illustrious  Ruler, Ozma of Oz, that the wife and ten children--five boys and five  girls--of the former King of Ev, by name"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/48991"],[0,"Leyte: The Return to the Philippines (#10)"],[1,"advanced to 20 October. [76]        The American Forces    The immediate task assigned the forces of the Southwest Pacific,  supported by the Third Fleet, was the seizure and control of the Leyte  Gulf-Surigao Strait area in order to establish air, naval, and logistic  bases to support further operations into the Philippines. Before  the invasion, air and naval operations were to be conducted so as to  disorganize Japanese ground and air defenses. The ground operation was  divided into three phases. In the first phase overwater movement and  minor amphibious operations to secure entrance into Leyte Gulf were  to take place. The main effort, which constituted the second phase,  was to involve a major assault to capture the airfields and base sites  in Leyte Valley and to open up San Juanico and Panaon Straits. In  the final phase, the remaining portions of the island in Japanese  hands and the western part of southern Samar were to be secured,  and Surigao Strait was to be opened. [77] The target date had been  set for 20 October 1944.    General plans for the operation had long since been worked out,  but not until 20 September did General MacArthur issue his final  plan for the occupation of Leyte. It was based upon the assumption  that American forces were or would be established along the  Marianas-Ulithi-Palaus-Morotai line and that the Japanese land and  air forces in the Philippines and Formosa would have been \"seriously  crippled and that the Japanese Fleet would elect to remain in Empire  waters\" with only \"light forces remaining in the vicinity of the  Philippines.\" The Japanese were expected to have one well-supplied  division in the area with only limited ability to reinforce it from  others of the Visayan Islands and with all subsequent supply deliveries  cut off. It was assumed that Japanese defenses would be concentrated  in the vicinity of the airfields in the Leyte Valley and at Tacloban.    The command organization was as follows: General MacArthur was  Supreme Commander, but during the amphibious movement and landing  Admiral Kinkaid, as commander of the Naval Attack Force, was to be  in command of all amphibious operations. (Chart 1) Army officers,  who took control of their forces ashore, were to continue under the  Commander, Naval Attack Force, until the next senior Army commander  assumed control. Upon his arrival ashore and after notification to  Admiral Kinkaid, General Krueger was to take control of the ground  troops. General Kenney, as commander of the Allied Air Forces, would  report directly to General MacArthur.    Admiral Halsey, as commander of the Third Fleet, was to co-ordinate  his operations with those of General MacArthur but he was responsible  to Admiral Nimitz, Commander in Chief, Pacific Ocean Area. The Third  Fleet was composed of Vice Adm. Marc Mitscher's Fast Carrier Task  Force, together with miscellaneous elements. Mitscher's force was  divided into four carrier groups. [78]    The Allied Naval Forces, which consisted principally of the  U. S. Seventh Fleet under Admiral Kinkaid, was to transport and  establish ashore the ground assault force. The Central Philippine  Attack Force consisted of three task forces. Task Force 77, commanded  by Admiral Kinkaid, was to furnish direct air and naval support and  was composed of battleships, light and heavy cruisers, destroyers,  destroyer escorts, carriers, escort carriers, gunboat and mortar  flotillas, mine sweepers, auxiliary vessels, and underwater demolition  teams. The transports and cargo ships of the Northern Attack Force,  Task Force 78, under Rear Adm. Daniel E. Barbey, and the Southern  Attack Force, Task Force 79, under Vice Adm. Theodore S. Wilkinson,  were to transport and set ashore the ground troops. Task Force 79  had been lent to General MacArthur by Admiral Nimitz for the operation.    The Allied Air Forces, principally the Far East Air Forces under  General Kenney, was to neutralize hostile air and naval forces  within range of the Philippines. The Allied Air Forces consisted  of the Fifth Air Force, commanded by Maj. Gen. Ennis P. Whitehead;  the Thirteenth Air Force, commanded by Maj. Gen. St. Clair Streett;  the Royal Australian Air Force Command under Air Vice Marshal William  D. Bostock; and miscellaneous elements. On order, the Fifth Air Force  was to be prepared to take over the mission of furnishing direct air  support to the ground troops.    The United States Army Services of Supply, Southwest Pacific Area,  commanded by General Frink, was to furnish logistic support for  the operation. The Eighth U.S. Army, commanded by Lt. Gen. Robert  L. Eichelberger, and the Allied Land Forces, commanded by General  Blamey, were to take over missions previously assigned the Sixth Army  and to assist the latter in training, staging, and mounting the troops  for the Leyte operation.    The ground troops who were to attack Leyte constituted a field  army--the Sixth Army, which had fought its way up the New Guinea coast  since April 1943 as Alamo Force. On 25 September 1944 Alamo Force  was dissolved and Sixth Army assumed its tactical missions. General  Krueger was commanding general for all these campaigns. The principal  component parts of Sixth Army were X and XXIV Corps. The former  consisted of the 1st Cavalry and 24th Infantry Divisions, under  Lt. Gen. Franklin C. Sibert, a seasoned commander who had successfully  fought the Japanese on New Guinea at Wakde-Sarmi. The XXIV Corps,  under Maj. Gen. John R. Hodge, who had defeated the Japanese on  Guadalcanal, New Georgia, and Bougainville, was composed of the  7th and 96th Infantry Divisions. In reserve were the 32d and 77th  Infantry Divisions. The Sixth Army Service Command was to perform  engineer functions on the island and give general logistic support.    Approximately 174,000 troops were made available for the initial  assault phase of the operation. About 51,500 of these made up the XXIV  Corps and 53,000 the X Corps. In addition to these troops, the reserve  32d and 77th Divisions had a strength of about 14,500 and 14,000  troops, respectively. All of the assault divisions were reinforced  with tank battalions, amphibian truck and tractor battalions, joint  assault signal companies, and many attached service units. A total of  about 202,500 ground troops was committed to the Leyte operation. [79]    Headquarters, Sixth Army, had never participated as such in any  campaign, but as Headquarters, Alamo Force, it had directed the  operations up the New Guinea coast. Both the X and XXIV Corps were  yet to be battle tested, though all their divisions with one exception  had participated in previous campaigns against the Japanese. The 1st  Cavalry Division had taken part in the Admiralty Islands campaign;  the 7th Division had defeated the Japanese at Attu and Kwajalein;  the 24th Division had fought in the Hollandia campaign; the 32d  Division had won the Papua Campaign and been victorious at Aitape  on New Guinea; and the 77th Division had shared in the victory at  Guam. Only the 96th Division was yet to be combat tested. [80]    General MacArthur's Warning Instructions 5 and Operations Instructions  70 were used by each of the major commanders as a basis for his own  operations orders. Although each order was derived from the one  next above it, all were planned concurrently. There was need for  constant intertheater, interservice, and intraservice conferences and  discussions on all phases of the plans as they evolved. Frequently  the planning was made easier by using the work done on plans for  other operations. For example, the logistical plan for the canceled  Yap operation was adapted with very little change to the Leyte  operation. The general schemes of maneuver and the employment of  support forces which had been found valuable in previous operations  were also adapted with minor variations to the plans for Leyte.        Air Support    The Navy was to bear the brunt of furnishing air support in the early  stages of the campaign. By arrangement with Admiral Nimitz, the Carrier  Task Force from Admiral Halsey's Third Fleet was to strike northern  Luzon and Okinawa or Formosa, or both, from A Day minus 10 to A minus  7. From A minus 4 through A Day, strikes were to be made on Luzon, the  Cebu-Negros area, and the Leyte area in support of the landings. As  soon as the Palau air base facilities would permit, shore-based air  forces from the Central Pacific were to operate in the Bicol area. [81]    The Allied Naval Forces was to furnish carrier aircraft as protection  for convoys and naval task forces and, supplemented by aircraft of  the Third Fleet and the Allied Air Forces, to provide direct air  support for the landings. In addition, it was to furnish protective  air support and cover by carrier aircraft prior to A Day for the  preliminary landings in Leyte Gulf and for the mine sweeping. [82]    General Mac Arthur assigned air support missions to the Allied Air  Forces. General Kenney's airmen were (1) to make aerial reconnaissance;  (2) in co-ordination with Third Fleet carrier-based aircraft, to  neutralize hostile naval and air forces within range of the Philippines  from A minus 9 in order to cover the movement of naval forces, the  landing, and subsequent operations; (3) within capabilities and when  requested by Admiral Kinkaid, to protect convoys and naval forces and  provide direct support of the landings and subsequent operations;  and (4) to destroy Japanese shipping and installations in the Sulu  and Arafura Seas and the East Indies. [83]    On 24 September General Kenney issued his order for the Leyte operation  and assigned missions to the Allied Air Forces. He designated General  Whitehead's Fifth Air Force as the Air Assault Force. It was to  support the operation by intensified air activities against enemy  installations, destroy hostile air and surface forces in the Celebes  Sea and assigned areas in the Philippine"]]]
