It may be what he claims for it. But he is  keeping something back. He speaks all the time from behind a barrier  which he, himself, has deliberately erected against me.\"    \"I cannot understand why he should do so,\" I declared, as he looked  at me steadily. \"Within the last few moments I have become definitely  convinced that his appeal to you was no idle one. Therefore, why should  he not offer you every aid in his power?\"    \"Why, indeed?\" muttered Harley.    \"The same thing,\" I continued, \"applies to Madame de Staemer. If ever I  have seen love-light in a woman's eyes I have seen it in hers, to-day,  whenever her glance has rested upon Colonel Menendez. Harley, I believe  she literally worships the ground he walks upon.\"    \"She does, she does!\" cried my companion, and emphasized the words with  beats of his clenched fist. \"It is utterly, damnably mystifying. But I  tell you, she knows, Knox, she knows!\"    \"You mean she knows that he is a doomed man?\"    Harley nodded rapidly.    \"They both know,\" he replied; \"but there is something which they dare  not divulge.\"    He glanced at me swiftly, and his bronzed face wore a peculiar  expression.    \"Have you had an opportunity of any private conversation with Miss Val  Beverley?\" he enquired.    \"Yes,\" I said. \"Surely you remember that you found me chatting with her  when you returned from your inspection of the tower.\"    \"I remember perfectly well, but I thought you might have just met. Now  it appears to me, Knox, that you have quickly established yourself in  the good books of a very charming girl. My only reason for visiting  the tower was to afford you just this opportunity! Don't frown. Beyond  reminding you of the fact that she has been on intimate terms with  Madame de Staemer for some years, I will not intrude in any way upon your  private plans in that direction.\"    I stared at him, and I suppose my expression was an angry one.    \"Surely you don't misunderstand me?\" he said. \"A cultured English  girl of that type cannot possibly have lived with these people without  learning something of the matters which are puzzling us so badly. Am I  asking too much?\"    \"I see what you mean,\" I said, slowly. \"No, I suppose you are right,  Harley.\"    \"Good,\" he muttered. \"I will leave that side of the enquiry in your very  capable hands, Knox.\"    He paused, and began to stare about him.    \"From this point,\" said he, \"we have an unobstructed view of the tower.\"    We turned and stood looking up at the unsightly gray structure, with its  geometrical rows of windows and the minaret-like gallery at the top.    \"Of course\"--I broke a silence of some moments duration--\"the entire  scheme of Cray's Folly is peculiar, but the rooms, except for a  uniformity which is monotonous, and an unimaginative scheme of  decoration which makes them all seem alike, are airy and well  lighted, eminently sane and substantial. The tower, however, is quite  inexcusable, unless the idea was to enable the occupant to look over the  tops of the trees in all directions.\"    \"Yes,\" agreed Harley, \"it is an ugly landmark. But yonder up the slope I  can see the corner of what seems to be a very picturesque house of some  kind.\"    \"I caught a glimpse of it earlier to-day,\" I replied. \"Yes, from this  point a little more of it is visible. Apparently quite an old place.\"    I paused, staring up the hillside, but Harley, hands locked behind  him and chin lowered reflectively, was pacing on. I joined him, and we  proceeded for some little distance in silence, passing a gardener who  touched his cap respectfully and to whom I thought at first my companion  was about to address some remark. Harley passed on, however, still  occupied, it seemed, with his reflections, and coming to a gravel path  which, bordering one side of the lawns, led down from terrace to terrace  into the valley, turned, and began to descend.    \"Let us go and interview the swans,\" he murmured absently.          CHAPTER VII    AT THE LAVENDER ARMS        In certain moods Paul Harley was impossible as a companion, and I,  who knew him well, had learned to leave him to his own devices at such  times. These moods invariably corresponded with his meeting some problem  to the heart of which the lance of his keen wit failed to penetrate.  His humour might not display itself in the spoken word, he merely became  oblivious of everything and everybody around him. People might talk to  him and he scarce noted their presence, familiar faces appear and he  would see them not. Outwardly he remained the observant Harley who  could see further into a mystery than any other in England, but his  observation was entirely introspective; although he moved amid the  hustle of life he was spiritually alone, communing with the solitude  which dwells in every man's heart.    Presently, then, as we came to the lake at the foot of the sloping  lawns, where water lilies were growing and quite a number of swans had  their habitation, I detected the fact that I had ceased to exist so  far as Harley was concerned. Knowing this mood of old, I pursued my way  alone, pressing on across the valley and making for a swing gate which  seemed to open upon a public footpath. Coming to this gate I turned and  looked back.    Paul Harley was standing where I had left him by the edge of the lake,  staring as if hypnotized at the slowly moving swans. But I would have  been prepared to wager that he saw neither swans nor lake, but mentally  was far from the spot, deep in some complex maze of reflection through  which no ordinary mind could hope to follow him.    I glanced at my watch and found that it was but little after two  o'clock. Luncheon at Cray's Folly was early. I therefore had some time  upon my hands and I determined to employ it in exploring part of the  neighbourhood. Accordingly I filled and lighted my pipe and strolled  leisurely along the footpath, enjoying the beauty of the afternoon, and  admiring the magnificent timber which grew upon the southerly slopes of  the valley.    Larks sang high above me and the air was fragrant with those wonderful  earthy scents which belong to an English countryside. A herd of very  fine Jersey cattle presently claimed inspection, and a little farther on  I found myself upon a high road where a brown-faced fellow seated aloft  upon a hay-cart cheerily gave me good-day as I passed.    Quite at random I turned to the left and followed the road, so that  presently I found myself in a very small village, the principal building  of which was a very small inn called the \"Lavender Arms.\"    Colonel Menendez's curacao, combined with the heat of the day, had made  me thirsty; for which reason I stepped into the bar-parlour determined  to sample the local ale. I wars served by the landlady, a neat, round,  red little person, and as she retired, having placed a foam-capped mug  upon the counter, her glance rested for a moment upon the only other  occupant of the room, a man seated in an armchair immediately to the  right of the door. A glass of whisky stood on the window ledge at his  elbow, and that it was by no means the first which he had imbibed, his  appearance seemed to indicate.    Having tasted the cool contents of my mug, I leaned back against the  counter and looked at this person curiously.    He was apparently of about medium height, but of a somewhat fragile  appearance. He was dressed like a country gentleman, and a stick and  soft hat lay upon the ledge near his glass. But the thing about him  which had immediately arrested my attention was his really extraordinary  resemblance to Paul Harley's engraving of Edgar Allan Poe.    I wondered at first if Harley's frequent references to the eccentric  American genius, to whom he accorded a sort of hero-worship, were  responsible for my imagining a close resemblance where only a slight one  existed. But inspection of that strange, dark face convinced me of  the fact that my first impression had been a true one. Perhaps, in my  curiosity, I stared rather rudely.    \"You will pardon me, sir,\" said the stranger, and I was startled to  note that he spoke with a faint American accent, \"but are you a literary  man?\"    As I had judged to be the case, he was slightly bemused, but by no  means drunk, and although his question was abrupt it was spoken civilly  enough.    \"Journalism is one of the several occupations in which I have failed,\" I  replied, lightly.    \"You are not a fiction writer?\"    \"I lack the imagination necessary for that craft, sir.\"    The other wagged his head slowly and took a drink of whisky.  \"Nevertheless,\" he said, and raised his finger solemnly, \"you were  thinking that I resembled Edgar Allan Poe!\"    \"Good heavens!\" I exclaimed, for the man had really amazed me. \"You  clearly resemble him in more ways than one. I must really ask you to  inform me how you deduced such a fact from a mere glance of mine.\"    \"I will tell you, sir,\" he replied. \"But, first, I must replenish my  glass, and I should be honoured if you would permit me to replenish  yours.\"    \"Thanks very much,\" I said, \"but I would rather you excused me.\"    \"As you wish, sir,\" replied the American with grave courtesy, \"as you  wish.\"    He stepped up to the counter and rapped upon it with half a crown,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/64"],[0,"The Gods of Mars (#10)"],[1,"of the  valley for even a few hours the therns may claim such a one as their  own.  And again the Holy Thern on watch, should he see a victim he  covets, often tramples upon the rights of the unreasoning brutes of the  valley and takes his prize by foul means if he cannot gain it by fair.    \"It is said that occasionally some deluded victim of Barsoomian  superstition will so far escape the clutches of the countless enemies  that beset his path from the moment that he emerges from the  subterranean passage through which the Iss flows for a thousand miles  before it enters the Valley Dor as to reach the very walls of the  Temple of Issus; but what fate awaits one there not even the Holy  Therns may guess, for who has passed within those gilded walls never  has returned to unfold the mysteries they have held since the beginning  of time.    \"The Temple of Issus is to the therns what the Valley Dor is imagined  by the peoples of the outer world to be to them; it is the ultimate  haven of peace, refuge, and happiness to which they pass after this  life and wherein an eternity of eternities is spent amidst the delights  of the flesh which appeal most strongly to this race of mental giants  and moral pygmies.\"    \"The Temple of Issus is, I take it, a heaven within a heaven,\" I said.  \"Let us hope that there it will be meted to the therns as they have  meted it here unto others.\"    \"Who knows?\" the girl murmured.    \"The therns, I judge from what you have said, are no less mortal than  we; and yet have I always heard them spoken of with the utmost awe and  reverence by the people of Barsoom, as one might speak of the gods  themselves.\"    \"The therns are mortal,\" she replied.  \"They die from the same causes  as you or I might: those who do not live their allotted span of life,  one thousand years, when by the authority of custom they may take their  way in happiness through the long tunnel that leads to Issus.    \"Those who die before are supposed to spend the balance of their  allotted time in the image of a plant man, and it is for this reason  that the plant men are held sacred by the therns, since they believe  that each of these hideous creatures was formerly a thern.\"    \"And should a plant man die?\" I asked.    \"Should he die before the expiration of the thousand years from the  birth of the thern whose immortality abides within him then the soul  passes into a great white ape, but should the ape die short of the  exact hour that terminates the thousand years the soul is for ever lost  and passes for all eternity into the carcass of the slimy and fearsome  silians whose wriggling thousands seethe the silent sea beneath the  hurtling moons when the sun has gone and strange shapes walk through  the Valley Dor.\"    \"We sent several Holy Therns to the silians to-day, then,\" said Tars  Tarkas, laughing.    \"And so will your death be the more terrible when it comes,\" said the  maiden.  \"And come it will--you cannot escape.\"    \"One has escaped, centuries ago,\" I reminded her, \"and what has been  done may be done again.\"    \"It is useless even to try,\" she answered hopelessly.    \"But try we shall,\" I cried, \"and you shall go with us, if you wish.\"    \"To be put to death by mine own people, and render my memory a disgrace  to my family and my nation?  A Prince of the House of Tardos Mors  should know better than to suggest such a thing.\"    Tars Tarkas listened in silence, but I could feel his eyes riveted upon  me and I knew that he awaited my answer as one might listen to the  reading of his sentence by the foreman of a jury.    What I advised the girl to do would seal our fate as well, since if I  bowed to the inevitable decree of age-old superstition we must all  remain and meet our fate in some horrible form within this awful abode  of horror and cruelty.    \"We have the right to escape if we can,\" I answered.  \"Our own moral  senses will not be offended if we succeed, for we know that the fabled  life of love and peace in the blessed Valley of Dor is a rank and  wicked deception.  We know that the valley is not sacred; we know that  the Holy Therns are not holy; that they are a race of cruel and  heartless mortals, knowing no more of the real life to come than we do.    \"Not only is it our right to bend every effort to escape--it is a  solemn duty from which we should not shrink even though we know that we  should be reviled and tortured by our own peoples when we returned to  them.    \"Only thus may we carry the truth to those without, and though the  likelihood of our narrative being given credence is, I grant you,  remote, so wedded are mortals to their stupid infatuation for  impossible superstitions, we should be craven cowards indeed were we to  shirk the plain duty which confronts us.    \"Again there is a chance that with the weight of the testimony of  several of us the truth of our statements may be accepted, and at least  a compromise effected which will result in the dispatching of an  expedition of investigation to this hideous mockery of heaven.\"    Both the girl and the green warrior stood silent in thought for some  moments.  The former it was who eventually broke the silence.    \"Never had I considered the matter in that light before,\" she said.  \"Indeed would I give my life a thousand times if I could but save a  single soul from the awful life that I have led in this cruel place.  Yes, you are right, and I will go with you as far as we can go; but I  doubt that we ever shall escape.\"    I turned an inquiring glance toward the Thark.    \"To the gates of Issus, or to the bottom of Korus,\" spoke the green  warrior; \"to the snows to the north or to the snows to the south, Tars  Tarkas follows where John Carter leads.  I have spoken.\"    \"Come, then,\" I cried, \"we must make the start, for we could not be  further from escape than we now are in the heart of this mountain and  within the four walls of this chamber of death.\"    \"Come, then,\" said the girl, \"but do not flatter yourself that you can  find no worse place than this within the territory of the therns.\"    So saying she swung the secret panel that separated us from the  apartment in which I had found her, and we stepped through once more  into the presence of the other prisoners.    There were in all ten red Martians, men and women, and when we had  briefly explained our plan they decided to join forces with us, though  it was evident that it was with some considerable misgivings that they  thus tempted fate by opposing an ancient superstition, even though each  knew through cruel experience the fallacy of its entire fabric.    Thuvia, the girl whom I had first freed, soon had the others at  liberty.  Tars Tarkas and I stripped the bodies of the two therns of  their weapons, which included swords, daggers, and two revolvers of the  curious and deadly type manufactured by the red Martians.    We distributed the weapons as far as they would go among our followers,  giving the firearms to two of the women; Thuvia being one so armed.    With the latter as our guide we set off rapidly but cautiously through  a maze of passages, crossing great chambers hewn from the solid metal  of the cliff, following winding corridors, ascending steep inclines,  and now and again concealing ourselves in dark recesses at the sound of  approaching footsteps.    Our destination, Thuvia said, was a distant storeroom where arms and  ammunition in plenty might be found.  From there she was to lead us to  the summit of the cliffs, from where it would require both wondrous wit  and mighty fighting to win our way through the very heart of the  stronghold of the Holy Therns to the world without.    \"And even then, O Prince,\" she cried, \"the arm of the Holy Thern is  long.  It reaches to every nation of Barsoom.  His secret temples are  hidden in the heart of every community.  Wherever we go should we  escape we shall find that word of our coming has preceded us, and death  awaits us before we may pollute the air with our blasphemies.\"    We had proceeded for possibly an hour without serious interruption, and  Thuvia had just whispered to me that we were approaching our first  destination, when on entering a great chamber we came upon a man,  evidently a thern.    He wore in addition to his leathern trappings and jewelled ornaments a  great circlet of gold about his brow in the exact centre of which was  set an immense stone, the exact counterpart of that which I had seen  upon the breast of the little old man at the atmosphere plant nearly  twenty years before.    It is the one priceless jewel of Barsoom.  Only two are known to exist,  and these were worn as the insignia of their rank and position by the  two old men in whose charge was placed the operation of the great  engines which pump the artificial atmosphere to all parts of Mars from  the huge atmosphere plant, the secret to whose mighty portals placed in  my possession the ability to save from immediate extinction the life of  a whole world.    The stone worn by the thern who confronted us was of about the same  size as that which I had seen before; an inch in diameter I should say.  It scintillated nine different and distinct rays; the seven primary  colours of our earthly prism and the two rays which are unknown upon  Earth, but whose wondrous beauty is indescribable.    As the thern saw us his eyes narrowed to two nasty slits.    \"Stop!\" he cried.  \"What means this, Thuvia?\"    For answer the girl raised her revolver and fired point-blank at him.  Without a sound he sank to the earth, dead.    \"Beast!\" she hissed.  \"After all these years I am at last revenged.\"    Then as she turned toward me, evidently with a word of explanation on  her lips, her eyes suddenly widened as they rested upon me, and with a  little exclamation she started toward me.    \"O Prince,\" she cried, \"Fate is indeed kind to us.  The way is still  difficult, but through this vile thing upon the floor we may yet win to  the outer "]]]
