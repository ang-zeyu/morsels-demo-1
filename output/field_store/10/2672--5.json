But they had gradually lost ground in the world, and, from  being themselves the heads of treason and traitorous conspiracies, the  Bertrams, or Mac-Dingawaies, of Ellangowan had sunk into subordinate  accomplices. Their most fatal exhibitions in this capacity took place in  the seventeenth century, when the foul fiend possessed them with a spirit  of contradiction, which uniformly involved them in controversy with the  ruling powers. They reversed the conduct of the celebrated Vicar of Bray,  and adhered as tenaciously to the weaker side as that worthy divine to  the stronger. And truly, like him, they had their reward.                Allan Bertram of Ellangowan, who flourished tempore Caroli primi, was,  says my authority, Sir Robert Douglas, in his Scottish Baronage (see the  title 'Ellangowan'), 'a steady loyalist, and full of zeal for the cause  of His Sacred Majesty, in which he united with the great Marquis of  Montrose and other truly zealous and honourable patriots, and sustained  great losses in that behalf. He had the honour of knighthood conferred  upon him by His Most Sacred Majesty, and was sequestrated as a malignant  by the parliament, 1642, and afterwards as a resolutioner in the year  1648.' These two cross-grained epithets of malignant and resolutioner  cost poor Sir Allan one half of the family estate. His son Dennis Bertram  married a daughter of an eminent fanatic who had a seat in the council of  state, and saved by that union the remainder of the family property. But,  as ill chance would have it, he became enamoured of the lady's principles  as well as of her charms, and my author gives him this character: 'He was  a man of eminent parts and resolution, for which reason he was chosen by  the western counties one of the committee of noblemen and gentlemen to  report their griefs to the privy council of Charles II. anent the coming  in of the Highland host in 1678.' For undertaking this patriotic task he  underwent a fine, to pay which he was obliged to mortgage half of the  remaining moiety of his paternal property. This loss he might have  recovered by dint of severe economy, but on the breaking out of Argyle's  rebellion Dennis Bertram was again suspected by government, apprehended,  sent to Dunnotar Castle on the coast of the Mearns, and there broke his  neck in an attempt to escape from a subterranean habitation called the  Whigs' Vault, in which he was confined with some eighty of the same  persuasion. The apprizer therefore (as the holder of a mortgage was then  called) entered upon possession, and, in the language of Hotspur, 'came  me cranking in,' and cut the family out of another monstrous cantle of  their remaining property.    Donohoe Bertram, with somewhat of an Irish name and somewhat of an Irish  temper, succeeded to the diminished property of Ellangowan. He turned out  of doors the Reverend Aaron Macbriar, his mother's chaplain (it is said  they quarrelled about the good graces of a milkmaid); drank himself daily  drunk with brimming healths to the king, council, and bishops; held  orgies with the Laird of Lagg, Theophilus Oglethorpe, and Sir James  Turner; and lastly, took his grey gelding and joined Clavers at  Killiecrankie. At the skirmish of Dunkeld, 1689, he was shot dead by a  Cameronian with a silver button (being supposed to have proof from the  Evil One against lead and steel), and his grave is still called the  Wicked Laird's Lair.    His son Lewis had more prudence than seems usually to have belonged to  the family. He nursed what property was yet left to him; for Donohoe's  excesses, as well as fines and forfeitures, had made another inroad upon  the estate. And although even he did not escape the fatality which  induced the Lairds of Ellangowan to interfere with politics, he had yet  the prudence, ere he went out with Lord Kenmore in 1715, to convey his  estate to trustees, in order to parry pains and penalties in case the  Earl of Mar could not put down the Protestant succession. But Scylla and  Charybdis--a word to the wise--he only saved his estate at expense of a  lawsuit, which again subdivided the family property. He was, however, a  man of resolution. He sold part of the lands, evacuated the old cattle,  where the family lived in their decadence as a mouse (said an old farmer)  lives under a firlot. Pulling down part of these venerable ruins, he  built with the stones a narrow house of three stories high, with a front  like a grenadier's cap, having in the very centre a round window like the  single eye of a Cyclops, two windows on each side, and a door in the  middle, leading to a parlour and withdrawing-room full of all manner of  cross lights.    This was the New Place of Ellangowan, in which we left our hero, better  amused perhaps than our readers, and to this Lewis Bertram retreated,  full of projects for re-establishing the prosperity of his family. He  took some land into his own hand, rented some from neighbouring  proprietors, bought and sold Highland cattle and Cheviot sheep, rode to  fairs and trysts, fought hard bargains, and held necessity at the staff's  end as well as he might. But what he gained in purse he lost in honour,  for such agricultural and commercial negotiations were very ill looked  upon by his brother lairds, who minded nothing but cock-fighting,  hunting, coursing, and horse-racing, with now and then the alternative of  a desperate duel. The occupations which he followed encroached, in their  opinion, upon the article of Ellangowan's gentry, and he found it  necessary gradually to estrange himself from their society, and sink into  what was then a very ambiguous character, a gentleman farmer. In the  midst of his schemes death claimed his tribute, and the scanty remains of  a large property descended upon Godfrey Bertram, the present possessor,  his only son.    The danger of the father's speculations was soon seen. Deprived of Laird  Lewis's personal and active superintendence, all his undertakings  miscarried, and became either abortive or perilous. Without a single  spark of energy to meet or repel these misfortunes, Godfrey put his faith  in the activity of another. He kept neither hunters nor hounds, nor any  other southern preliminaries to ruin; but, as has been observed of his  countrymen, he kept a man of business, who answered the purpose equally  well. Under this gentleman's supervision small debts grew into large,  interests were accumulated upon capitals, movable bonds became heritable,  and law charges were heaped upon all; though Ellangowan possessed so  little the spirit of a litigant that he was on two occasions charged to  make payment of the expenses of a long lawsuit, although he had never  before heard that he had such cases in court. Meanwhile his neighbours  predicted his final ruin. Those of the higher rank, with some malignity,  accounted him already a degraded brother. The lower classes, seeing  nothing enviable in his situation, marked his embarrassments with more  compassion. He was even a kind of favourite with them, and upon the  division of a common, or the holding of a black-fishing or poaching  court, or any similar occasion when they conceived themselves oppressed  by the gentry, they were in the habit of saying to each other, 'Ah, if  Ellangowan, honest man, had his ain that his forbears had afore him, he  wadna see the puir folk trodden down this gait.' Meanwhile, this general  good opinion never prevented their taking advantage of him on all  possible occasions, turning their cattle into his parks, stealing his  wood, shooting his game, and so forth, 'for the Laird, honest man, he'll  never find it; he never minds what a puir body does.' Pedlars, gipsies,  tinkers, vagrants of all descriptions, roosted about his outhouses, or  harboured in his kitchen; and the Laird, who was 'nae nice body,' but a  thorough gossip, like most weak men, found recompense for his hospitality  in the pleasure of questioning them on the news of the country side.    A circumstance arrested Ellangowan's progress on the highroad to ruin.  This was his marriage with a lady who had a portion of about four  thousand pounds. Nobody in the neighbourhood could conceive why she  married him and endowed him with her wealth, unless because he had a  tall, handsome figure, a good set of features, a genteel address, and the  most perfect good-humour. It might be some additional consideration, that  she was herself at the reflecting age of twenty-eight, and had no near  relations to control her actions or choice.    It was in this lady's behalf (confined for the first time after her  marriage) that the speedy and active express, mentioned by the old dame  of the cottage, had been despatched to Kippletringan on the night of  Mannering's arrival.    Though we have said so much of the Laird himself, it still remains that  we make the reader in some degree acquainted with his companion. This was  Abel Sampson, commonly called, from his occupation as a pedagogue,  Dominie Sampson. He was of low birth, but having evinced, even from his  cradle, an uncommon seriousness of disposition, the poor parents were  encouraged to hope that their bairn, as they expressed it, 'might wag his  pow in a pulpit yet.' With an ambitious view to such a consummation, they  pinched and pared, rose early and lay down late, ate dry bread and drank  cold water, to secure to Abel the means of learning. Meantime, his tall,  ungainly figure, his taciturn and grave manners, and some grotesque  habits of swinging his limbs and screwing his visage while reciting his  task, made poor Sampson the ridicule of all his school-companions. The  same qualities secured him at Glasgow College a plentiful share of the  same sort of notice. Half the youthful mob of 'the yards' used to  assemble regularly to see Dominie Sampson (for he had already attained  that honourable title) descend the stairs from the Greek class, with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60198"],[0,"Fuente Ovejuna (#10)"],[1,"la encomienda son?
