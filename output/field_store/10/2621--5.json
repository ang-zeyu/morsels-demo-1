Campo is burnin' bridges an' tearin' up  the railroad south of Nogales.  Then there's all these bandits callin'  themselves revolutionists just for an excuse to steal, burn, kill, an'  ride off with women.  It's plain facts, Laddy, an' bein' across the  U.S. line a few inches or so don't make no hell of a difference.  My  advice is, don't let Miss Castaneda ever set foot in Casita again.\"    \"Looks like you've shore spoke sense,\" said Ladd.  \"I reckon, Gale, you  an' the girl ought to come with us.  Casita shore would be a little  warm for us to-morrow.  We didn't kill anybody, but I shot a Greaser's  arm off, an' Lash strained friendly relations by destroyin' property.  We know people who'll take care of the senorita till your friend can  come for her.\"    Dick warmly spoke his gratefulness, and, inexpressibly relieved and  happy for Mercedes, he went toward the clump of cactus where he had  left her.  She stood erect, waiting, and, dark as it was, he could tell  she had lost the terror that had so shaken her.    \"Senor Gale, you are my good angel,\" she said, tremulously.    \"I've been lucky to fall in with these men, and I'm glad with all my  heart,\" he replied.  \"Come.\"    He led her into the road up to the cowboys, who now stood bareheaded in  the starlight.  They seemed shy, and Lash was silent while Ladd made  embarrassed, unintelligible reply to Mercedes's thanks.    There were five horses--two saddled, two packed, and the remaining one  carried only a blanket.  Ladd shortened the stirrups on his mount, and  helped Mercedes up into the saddle.  From the way she settled herself  and took the few restive prances of the mettlesome horse Gale judged  that she could ride.  Lash urged Gale to take his horse.  But this Gale  refused to do.    \"I'll walk,\" he said.  \"I'm used to walking.  I know cowboys are not.\"    They tried again to persuade him, without avail.  Then Ladd started  off, riding bareback.  Mercedes fell in behind, with Gale walking  beside her. The two pack animals came next, and Lash brought up the  rear.    Once started with protection assured for the girl and a real objective  point in view, Gale relaxed from the tense strain he had been laboring  under.  How glad he would have been to acquaint Thorne with their good  fortune!  Later, of course, there would be some way to get word to the  cavalryman.  But till then what torments his friend would suffer!    It seemed to Dick that a very long time had elapsed since he stepped  off the train; and one by one he went over every detail of incident  which had occurred between that arrival and the present moment.  Strange as the facts were, he had no doubts.  He realized that before  that night he had never known the deeps of wrath undisturbed in him; he  had never conceived even a passing idea that it was possible for him to  try to kill a man.  His right hand was swollen stiff, so sore that he  could scarcely close it.  His knuckles were bruised and bleeding, and  ached with a sharp pain.  Considering the thickness of his heavy glove,  Gale was of the opinion that so to bruise his hand he must have struck  Rojas a powerful blow.  He remembered that for him to give or take a  blow had been nothing.  This blow to Rojas, however, had been a  different matter.  The hot wrath which had been his motive was not  puzzling; but the effect on him after he had cooled off, a subtle  difference, something puzzled and eluded him. The more it baffled him  the more he pondered.  All those wandering months of his had been  filled with dissatisfaction, yet he had been too apathetic to  understand himself.  So he had not been much of a person to try.  Perhaps it had not been the blow to Rojas any more than other things  that had wrought some change in him.    His meeting with Thorne; the wonderful black eyes of a Spanish girl;  her appeal to him; the hate inspired by Rojas, and the rush, the blow,  the action; sight of Thorne and  Mercedes hurrying safely away; the  girl's hand pressing his to her heaving breast; the sweet fire of her  kiss; the fact of her being alone with him, dependent upon him--all  these things Gale turned over and over in his mind, only to fail of any  definite conclusion as to which had affected him so remarkably, or to  tell what had really happened to him.    Had he fallen in love with Thorne's sweetheart?  The idea came in a  flash.  Was he, all in an instant, and by one of those incomprehensible  reversals of  character, jealous of his friend?  Dick was almost afraid  to look up at Mercedes.  Still he forced himself to do so, and as it  chanced Mercedes was looking down at him.  Somehow the light was  better, and he clearly saw her white face, her black and starry eyes,  her perfect mouth.  With a quick, graceful impulsiveness she put her  hand upon his shoulder.  Like her appearance, the action was new,  strange, striking to Gale; but it brought home suddenly to him the  nature of gratitude and affection in a girl of her blood.  It was sweet  and sisterly.  He knew then that he had not fallen in love with her.  The feeling that was akin to jealousy seemed to be of the beautiful  something for which Mercedes stood in Thorne's life. Gale then grasped  the bewildering possibilities, the infinite wonder of what a girl could  mean to a man.    The other haunting intimations of change seemed to be elusively blended  with sensations--the heat and thrill of action, the sense of something  done and more to do, the utter vanishing of an old weary hunt for he  knew not what.  Maybe it had been a hunt for work, for energy, for  spirit, for love, for his real self. Whatever it might be, there  appeared to be now some hope of finding it.    The desert began to lighten.  Gray openings in the border of shrubby  growths changed to paler hue.  The road could be seen some rods ahead,  and it had become a stony descent down, steadily down. Dark, ridged  backs of mountains bounded the horizon, and all seemed near at hand,  hemming in the plain.  In the east a white glow grew brighter and  brighter, reaching up to a line of cloud, defined sharply below by a  rugged notched range.  Presently a silver circle rose behind the black  mountain, and the gloom of the desert underwent a transformation. From  a gray mantle it changed to a transparent haze.  The moon was rising.    \"Senor I am cold,\" said Mercedes.    Dick had been carrying his coat upon his arm.  He had felt warm, even  hot, and had imagined that the steady walk had occasioned it.  But his  skin was cool.  The heat came from an inward burning. He stopped the  horse and raised the coat up, and helped Mercedes put it on.    \"I should have thought of you,\" he said.  \"But I seemed to feel warm...  The coat's a little large; we might wrap it round you twice.\"    Mercedes smiled and lightly thanked him in Spanish.  The flash of mood  was in direct contrast to the appealing, passionate, and tragic states  in which he had successively viewed her; and it gave him a vivid  impression of what vivacity and charm she might possess under happy  conditions.  He was about to start when he observed that Ladd had  halted and was peering ahead in evident caution.  Mercedes' horse began  to stamp impatiently, raised his ears and head, and acted as if he was  about to neigh.    A warning \"hist!\" from Ladd bade Dick to put a quieting hand on the  horse.  Lash came noiselessly forward to join his companion. The two  then listened and watched.    An uneasy yet thrilling stir ran through Gale's veins.  This scene was  not fancy.  These men of the ranges had heard or seen or scented  danger.  It was all real, as tangible and sure as the touch of  Mercedes's hand upon his arm.  Probably for her the night had terrors  beyond Gale's power to comprehend.  He looked down into the desert, and  would have felt no surprise at anything hidden away among the bristling  cactus, the dark, winding arroyos, the shadowed rocks with their  moonlit tips, the ragged plain leading to the black bold mountains.  The wind appeared to blow softly, with an almost imperceptible moan,  over the desert.  That was a new sound to Gale. But he heard nothing  more.    Presently Lash went to the rear and Ladd started ahead.  The progress  now, however, was considerably slower, not owing to a road--for that  became better--but probably owing to caution exercised by the cowboy  guide.  At the end of a half hour this marked deliberation changed, and  the horses followed Ladd's at a gait that put Gale to his best  walking-paces.    Meanwhile the moon soared high above the black corrugated peaks. The  gray, the gloom, the shadow whitened.  The clearing of the dark  foreground appeared to lift a distant veil and show endless aisles of  desert reaching down between dim horizon-bounding ranges.    Gale gazed abroad, knowing that as this night was the first time for  him to awake to consciousness of a vague, wonderful other self, so it  was one wherein he began to be aware of an encroaching presence of  physical things--the immensity of the star-studded sky, the soaring  moon, the bleak, mysterious mountains, and limitless slope, and plain,  and ridge, and valley.  These things in all their magnificence had not  been unnoticed by him before; only now they spoke a different meaning.  A voice that he had never heard called him to see, to feel the vast  hard externals of heaven and earth, all that represented the open, the  free, silence and solitude and space.    Once more his thoughts, like his steps, were halted by Ladd's actions.  The cowboy reined in his horse, listened a moment, then swung down out  of the saddle.  He raised a cautioning hand to the others, then slipped  into the gloom and disappeared.  Gale marked that the halt had been  made in a ridged and cut-up pass between low mesas. He could see the  columns of cactus standing out black"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/503"],[0,"The Blue Fairy Book (#10)"],[1,"and the Fairy of the Desert that I am not likely to wish to  help them, especially since I constantly see your poor Princess, whose  beauty and goodness make me pity her so much; and I tell you that if you  will have confidence in me I will help you to escape.\"    \"I trust you absolutely,\" cried the King, \"and I will do whatever you  tell me; but if you have seen my Princess I beg of you to tell me how  she is and what is happening to her.    \"We must not waste time in talking,\" said she. \"Come with me and I will  carry you to the Castle of Steel, and we will leave upon this shore a  figure so like you that even the Fairy herself will be deceived by it.\"    So saying, she quickly collected a bundle of sea-weed, and, blowing it  three times, she said:    \"My friendly sea-weeds, I order you to stay here stretched upon the sand  until the Fairy of the Desert comes to take you away.\" And at once  the sea-weeds became like the King, who stood looking at them in great  astonishment, for they were even dressed in a coat like his, but they  lay there pale and still as the King himself might have lain if one  of the great waves had overtaken him and thrown him senseless upon  the shore. And then the Mermaid caught up the King, and away they swam  joyfully together.    \"Now,\" said she, \"I have time to tell you about the Princess. In spite  of the blow which the Fairy of the Desert gave her, the Yellow Dwarf  compelled her to mount behind him upon his terrible Spanish cat; but she  soon fainted away with pain and terror, and did not recover till they  were within the walls of his frightful Castle of Steel. Here she was  received by the prettiest girls it was possible to find, who had been  carried there by the Yellow Dwarf, who hastened to wait upon her and  showed her every possible attention. She was laid upon a couch covered  with cloth of gold, embroidered with pearls as big as nuts.\"    \"Ah!\" interrupted the King of the Gold Mines, \"if Bellissima forgets me,  and consents to marry him, I shall break my heart.\"    \"You need not be afraid of that,\" answered the Mermaid, \"the Princess  thinks of no one but you, and the frightful Dwarf cannot persuade her to  look at him.\"    \"Pray go on with your story,\" said the King.    \"What more is there to tell you?\" replied the Mermaid. \"Bellissima was  sitting in the wood when you passed, and saw you with the Fairy of the  Desert, who was so cleverly disguised that the Princess took her to be  prettier than herself; you may imagine her despair, for she thought that  you had fallen in love with her.\"    \"She believes that I love her!\" cried the King. \"What a fatal mistake!  What is to be done to undeceive her?\"    \"You know best,\" answered the Mermaid, smiling kindly at him. \"When  people are as much in love with one another as you two are, they don't  need advice from anyone else.\"    As she spoke they reached the Castle of Steel, the side next the sea  being the only one which the Yellow Dwarf had left unprotected by the  dreadful burning walls.    \"I know quite well,\" said the Mermaid, \"that the Princess is sitting by  the brook-side, just where you saw her as you passed, but as you will  have many enemies to fight with before you can reach her, take this  sword; armed with it you may dare any danger, and overcome the greatest  difficulties, only beware of one thing--that is, never to let it fall  from your hand. Farewell; now I will wait by that rock, and if you need  my help in carrying off your beloved Princess I will not fail you, for  the Queen, her mother, is my best friend, and it was for her sake that I  went to rescue you.\"    So saying, she gave to the King a sword made from a single diamond,  which was more brilliant than the sun. He could not find words to  express his gratitude, but he begged her to believe that he fully  appreciated the importance of her gift, and would never forget her help  and kindness.    We must now go back to the Fairy of the Desert. When she found that the  King did not return, she hastened out to look for him, and reached the  shore, with a hundred of the ladies of her train, loaded with splendid  presents for him. Some carried baskets full of diamonds, others golden  cups of wonderful workmanship, and amber, coral, and pearls, others,  again, balanced upon their heads bales of the richest and most beautiful  stuffs, while the rest brought fruit and flowers, and even birds. But  what was the horror of the Fairy, who followed this gay troop, when she  saw, stretched upon the sands, the image of the King which the Mermaid  had made with the sea-weeds. Struck with astonishment and sorrow, she  uttered a terrible cry, and threw herself down beside the pretended  King, weeping, and howling, and calling upon her eleven sisters, who  were also fairies, and who came to her assistance. But they were all  taken in by the image of the King, for, clever as they were, the Mermaid  was still cleverer, and all they could do was to help the Fairy of the  Desert to make a wonderful monument over what they thought was the grave  of the King of the Gold Mines. But while they were collecting jasper  and porphyry, agate and marble, gold and bronze, statues and devices,  to immortalize the King's memory, he was thanking the good Mermaid and  begging her still to help him, which she graciously promised to do as  she disappeared; and then he set out for the Castle of Steel. He walked  fast, looking anxiously round him, and longing once more to see his  darling Bellissima, but he had not gone far before he was surrounded by  four terrible sphinxes who would very soon have torn him to pieces with  their sharp talons if it had not been for the Mermaid's diamond sword.  For, no sooner had he flashed it before their eyes than down they fell  at his feet quite helpless, and he killed them with one blow. But he  had hardly turned to continue his search when he met six dragons covered  with scales that were harder than iron. Frightful as this encounter was  the King's courage was unshaken, and by the aid of his wonderful sword  he cut them in pieces one after the other. Now he hoped his difficulties  were over, but at the next turning he was met by one which he did  not know how to overcome. Four-and-twenty pretty and graceful nymphs  advanced toward him, holding garlands of flowers, with which they barred  the way.    \"Where are you going, Prince?\" they said; \"it is our duty to guard this  place, and if we let you pass great misfortunes will happen to you  and to us. We beg you not to insist upon going on. Do you want to kill  four-and-twenty girls who have never displeased you in any way?\"    The King did not know what to do or to say. It went against all his  ideas as a knight to do anything a lady begged him not to do; but, as he  hesitated, a voice in his ear said:    \"Strike! strike! and do not spare, or your Princess is lost for ever!\"    So, without reply to the nymphs, he rushed forward instantly, breaking  their garlands, and scattering them in all directions; and then went  on without further hindrance to the little wood where he had seen  Bellissima. She was seated by the brook looking pale and weary when he  reached her, and he would have thrown himself down at her feet, but she  drew herself away from him with as much indignation as if he had been  the Yellow Dwarf.    \"Ah! Princess,\" he cried, \"do not be angry with me. Let me explain  everything. I am not faithless or to blame for what has happened. I am  a miserable wretch who has displeased you without being able to help  himself.\"    \"Ah!\" cried Bellissima, \"did I not see you flying through the air with  the loveliest being imaginable? Was that against your will?\"    \"Indeed it was, Princess,\" he answered; \"the wicked Fairy of the Desert,  not content with chaining me to a rock, carried me off in her chariot to  the other end of the earth, where I should even now be a captive but for  the unexpected help of a friendly mermaid, who brought me here to rescue  you, my Princess, from the unworthy hands that hold you. Do not refuse  the aid of your most faithful lover.\" So saying, he threw himself at her  feet and held her by her robe. But, alas! in so doing he let fall the  magic sword, and the Yellow Dwarf, who was crouching behind a lettuce,  no sooner saw it than he sprang out and seized it, well knowing its  wonderful power.    The Princess gave a cry of terror on seeing the Dwarf, but this only  irritated the little monster; muttering a few magical words he summoned  two giants, who bound the King with great chains of iron.    \"Now,\" said the Dwarf, \"I am master of my rival's fate, but I will give  him his life and permission to depart unharmed if you, Princess, will  consent to marry me.\"    \"Let me die a thousand times rather,\" cried the unhappy King.    \"Alas!\" cried the Princess, \"must you die? Could anything be more  terrible?\"    \"That you should marry that little wretch would be far more terrible,\"  answered the King.    \"At least,\" continued she, \"let us die together.\"    \"Let me have the satisfaction of dying for you, my Princess,\" said he.    \"Oh, no, no!\" she cried, turning to the Dwarf; \"rather than that I will  do as you wish.\"    \"Cruel Princess!\" said the King, \"would you make my life horrible to me  by marrying another before my eyes?\"    \"Not so,\" replied the Yellow Dwarf; \"you are a rival of whom I am too  much afraid; you shall not see our marriage.\" So saying, in spite of  Bellissima's tears and cries, he stabbed the King to the heart with the  diamond sword.    The poor Princess, seeing her lover lying dead at her feet, could no  longer live without him; she sank down by him and died of a broken  heart.    So ended these unfortunate lovers, whom not even the Mermaid could help,  because all the magic power had been lost with the diamond sword.    As to the wicked Dwarf, he preferred to see the Princess dead rather  than married to the King of the Gold Mines; and the Fairy"]]]
