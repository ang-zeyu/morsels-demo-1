[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44114"],[0,"A Jay of Italy (#10)"],[1," on thee  from the mountain of myrrh! Until the day break and the shadows flee  away!'    A little later, in a deep angle of the enceinte, they came upon a  gruesome sight.  This was no less than the Montmartre of Milan--a great  stone gallows with dangling chains, and tenanted--faugh!  A cloud of  winged creatures rose as they approached, and scattered, dropping  fragments.  It was the common repast, stuff of rogues and  pilferers--nothing especial.  The ground was trodden underneath, and  Bembo shrieked to see two white, stiff feet sticking from it.  Lanti  followed the direction of his hand, and exclaimed with a moody shrug:--    'An assassin, Saint--nothing more.  We plant them like that, head down.'    'Alive?'    'O, of course!'    Bembo cried out: 'These are not sons of God, but of Belial!' and passed  on, with his head drooping.  Carlo turned to Beatrice, where she rode  behind, and, without a word, pointed significantly to the horrible  vision.  She laughed, and went by unmoved.    In a little after they had all entered by the gate, and the city was  before them.  Bembo, kindled against his will, rose in his saddle and  uttered an exclamation of delight.  Before his eyes was spread a white  town with blue water and upstanding cypresses--wedges of midnight in  midday.  There were terraces and broad flagged walks, and palaces and  spacious loggias--fair glooms of marble shaken in the spray of  fountains. From its cold, shadowless bridges to the heaped drift of the  duomo in its midst, there seemed no slur, but those dark cypresses, on  all its candid purity.  It looked like a city flushed under a veil of  hoar frost, the glare of its streets and markets and gardens subdued to  one softest harmony of opal.    Yet in quick contrast with this chill, sweet austerity, glowed the  burning life of it.  In the distance, like travelling sparks in wood  ashes; nearer, flashing from roof or balcony in harlequin spots of  light; nearest of all, a very baggage-rout of figures, fantastic,  chameleonic, an endless mutation and interflowing of blues, and  crimsons, and purples--tirelessly that life circulated, the hot arterial  blood which gave their tender hue to those encompassing veins of marble.    It was on this drift of souls going by him, gay and light, it seemed, as  blown petals, that Bernardo gazed with the most loving fondness.  He  pictured them all, eager, passionate, ardent, moving about the business  of the Nature-God, propagating His Gospel of sweetness, adapting to  imperishable works the endlessly varying arabesques of woods, and starry  meadows, and running clouds and waters--epitomising His System.  He  admired these works, their beauty, their stability, their triumphant  achievement; though, in truth, his soul of souls could conceive no  achievement for man so ideal as a world of glorious gardens and little  abodes.  But the sun was once more in his heart, and heaven in his eyes.    The swallows stooped in the streets to welcome him: 'Hail, little priest  of the cloistered hills!'  The scent of flowers offered itself the  incense to his ritual; the fountains leapt more merrily for his coming.  'Love! love!' sang the birds under the great eaves; 'He will woo this  cruel world to harmlessness.  Where men shall lead with charity, all  animals shall follow.  The good fruits ripen to be eaten; it is their  love, their lust to be consumed in joy.  What lamb ever gave its throat  to the knife?  The violet flowers the thicker the more its blossoms are  ravished.  What new limb ever budded on a maimed beast?'    'Ah! the secret,' sang Bembo's soul--'the secret, or the secret  grievance, of the cosmos will yield itself only to love.  Useless to try  to wrench forth its confession by torture.  Let retaliation spell love,  for once and for ever, and to the infinite sorrows of life will appear  at last their returned Redeemer.'    His heart was full as they rode by the narrow streets. His eyes and ears  were tranced with colour, the murmur of happy voices, the clash of  melodious bells.  He could not think of that late vision of horror but  as a dream. These blithe souls, in all their moods and worships such  true apostles of his gay, sweet God!  They could not love or practise  harshness but as a deterrent from things unnameable.  The very absence  of sightseers from that pit of scowling death proved it.    And then, in a moment, they had debouched upon an open place overlooked  by a massive fortress, and in its midst, the cynosure of hundreds of  gloating eyes, was a human thing under the flail--a voice moaning from  the midst of a red jelly.    His heart sunk under a very avalanche.  He uttered a cry so loud as to  attract the attention of the spectators nearest.    'Who is it?  What hath he done?' he roared of one. 'Trampled on the  Host?  Defiled a virgin of the mother? Murdered a priest?'    The face puckered and grinned.    'Worse, Messer Cavalier.  He once whipped the Duke when his tutor.'    Bembo's whole little body braced itself to the spring.    'Tutor!' he cried: 'is that, then, Cola Montano?'    The gross eye winked--    'What is left of it.'    He was answered with a leap and rush.  The mob at that point staggered,  and bellowed, and fell away from the hoofs of a furious assailant.  Carlo, pre-admonished, was already on the boy's flank.  'Stop, little  lunatic!' he shouted, sweating and spurring to intervene.  He had no  concern for the feet he trampled or the ribs he bruised. He stooped and  snatched at the struggling horse's bridle. 'It is the Duke's vengeance!'  he panted.  'See him there above!  Art mad?'    A face, flushed as the face of Him who scourged the hucksters from the  temple, was turned upon him.    'Art thou?  Strike for retaliation by love, or get behind!'    'Know'st nothing of his deserts,' cried Carlo.  'Be advised!'    'By love,' cried the boy.  'He is worthy of it--a good man--I carry a  letter to him from my father.  Fall back, I say.'    He drove in his heels, and the horse plunged and started, tearing the  rein from Lanti's grasp.  It was true that Bembo bore this letter, among  others, in his pouch. The Abbot of San Zeno was so long out of the world  as to have miscalculated the durations of court favour. Cola had been an  influence in _his_ time.    'Devil take him!' growled Carlo; but he followed, scowling and slashing,  in his wake.  The mob, authorised of its worst humour, took his  truculence ill.  That reduced him to a very devilish sobriety.  He began  to strike with an eye to details, 'blazing' his passage through the  throng.  The method justified itself in the opening out of a human lane,  at the end of which he saw Bembo spring upon the stage.    The executioner was cutting deliberately, monotonously on, and as  monotonously the voice went moaning. Messer Jacopo, standing at iron  ease beside, took no thought, it seemed, of anything--least of all of  interference with the Duke's will.  It must have been, therefore, no  less than an amazing shock to that functionary to find himself all in an  instant stung and staggered by a bolt from the blue.  He may have been,  like some phlegmatic serpent, conscious of a hornet winging his way; but  that the insect should have had it in its mind to pounce on _him_!    He found himself and his voice in one metallic clang:--    'Seize him, men!'    Carlo panted up, and Jacopo recognised him on the moment.    'Messer Lanti!  Death of the Cross!  Is this the Duke's order?'    'Christ's, old fool!' gasped the cavalier.  'Touch him, I say, and die.  I neither know nor care.'    His great chest was heaving; he whipped out his sword, and stood glaring  and at bay.  Bembo had thrown himself between the upraised thong and its  quivering victim.  He, too, faced the stricken mob.    'Christ is coming!  Christ is coming!' he shrieked. 'Prepare ye all to  answer to Him for this!'    A dead silence fell.  Some turned their faces in terror. Here and there  a woman cried out.  In the midst, Messer Jacopo raised his eyes to the  battlements, and saw a white hand lifted against the blue.  He shrugged  round grumpily on his fellows.    'Unbind him,' he said; and the whip was lowered.    The poor body sunk beside the post.  Bembo knelt, with a sob of pity, to  whisper to it--    'Courage, sad heart!  He comes indeed.'    The livid and suffering face was twisted to view its deliverer.    'Escape, then,' the blue lips muttered, 'while there is time.'    Bembo cried out: 'O, thou mistakest who I mean!'    The face dropped again.    'Never.  Christ or Galeazzo--it is all one.'    A hand was laid on the boy's shoulder.  He looked up to find himself  captive to one of the Duke's guard.  A grim little troop, steel-bonneted  and armed with halberts, surrounded the stage.  Messer Lanti,  dismounted, had already committed himself to the inevitable.  He  addressed himself, with a laugh, to his friend:--    'Very well acquitted, little Saint,' said he--'of all but the  reckoning.'    Bembo lingered a moment, pointing down to the bleeding and shattered  body.    \"'And there passed by a certain priest,\"' he cried, '\"and likewise a  Levite; but a Samaritan had compassion on him,\"' and he bowed his head,  and went down with the soldiers.    Now, because of his beauty, or of the fear or of the pity he had wrought  in some of his hearers, for whatever reason a woman or two of the people  was emboldened to come and ask the healing of that wounded thing; and  they took it away, undeterred of the executioners, and carried it to  their quarters.  And in the meanwhile, Bembo and his comrade were  brought before the Duke.    Galeazzo had descended from the battlements, and sat in a little room of  the gatehouse, with only a few, including his wife and child, to attend  him.  And his brow was wrinkled, and the lust of fury, beyond  dissembling, in his veins.  He took no notice of Lanti--though generally  well enough disposed to the bully--but glared, even with some"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44235"],[0,"Memoirs of the Dukes of Urbino, Volume 2 (of 3) (#10)"],[1," should sit with his lord; and the just and proper favour I ask is  permission for the servant to wait at the table of your Holiness.'  The supper being thus served, and the moment arrived for giving the  confections, the box having been poisoned by the steward as directed  by the Pope, the Cardinal placed it before his Holiness, who, relying  on his steward, and convinced of the Cardinal's sincerity by his  service, ate joyfully of this box, as did the Cardinal of the other,  which the Pontiff believed the poisoned one. Thereafter, at the hour  when from its nature the poison took effect, his Holiness began to  feel it, and thus he died: the Cardinal being still alarmed, took  medicine and an emetic, and was easily cured.\"    The death of Alexander by poison is generally credited, although  Raynaldus and Muratori, willing to mitigate so heinous a scandal,  incline to the few and obscure authorities who attribute it to  tertian fever. It was natural that the truth should be glossed over,  especially in despatches addressed to the court of his daughter  Lucrezia, to which the latter annalist probably had access. But  though the earliest intelligence of the event forwarded by the  Venetian envoy alludes to the Pope's seizure as fever, his subsequent  letters, quoted by Sanuto, thus loathsomely confirm the current  suspicion of poison having been administered. \"On this day [19th] I  saw the Pontiff's corpse, whose apparel was not worth two ducats.  He was swollen beyond the size of one of our large wine-skins. Never  since the Christian era was a more horrible and terrible sight  witnessed. The blood flowed from ears, mouth, and nose faster than  it could be wiped away; his lips were larger than a man's fist, and  in his open mouth the blood boiled as in a caldron on the fire, and  kept incessantly flowing as from a spout; all which I report from  observation.\"[9]    [Footnote 9: This passage appears conclusive as to the fact of poison  having been taken by the Pontiff; and it will be observed that  Sanuto's story of the confection-boxes in no way accounts for the  illness of Valentino, which is equally passed over in another totally  different statement of this affair, given in the Appendix to Ranke's  _History of the Popes_, section i. No. 4,--omissions to be kept  in view in testing the probability of these conflicting accounts.  Roscoe seems to have subsequently abandoned the doubts thrown upon  the poisoning in his first edition, although ever prone to extenuate  vices of the Borgia: witness his elaborate defence of Lucrezia, or  his views as to the Duke of Gandia's murder and the massacre of  Sinigaglia. Voltaire treats the question like a habitual doubter,  with the ingenuity of a critic rather than the matured judgment of a  historian. He is answered, with perhaps unnecessary detail, by Masse,  to whom Sanuto was unknown.]    The character of Alexander VI. as a man and as a sovereign admits of  no question, and is thus forcibly summed up by Sismondi. \"He was the  most notoriously immoral man in Christendom; one whose debauchery  no shame restrained, whose treaties no good faith sanctioned, whose  policy was never guarded by justice, to whose vengeance pity was  unknown.\"[*10] As a pontiff he must be tried by a different test,  and those ecclesiastical writers, who attempt not to defend his  morals or example, assert the orthodoxy of his faith and doctrine,  and commend the wisdom of his provisions for maintenance of that  religion which regarded him as its head. He was the first to  establish the censorship of books,[*11] an important bulwark of the  Roman Church; and among the orders which he instituted or protected  was that of S. Francesco di Paolo. Nor can it be doubted that his  ambitious nepotism eventually aggrandised the temporal possessions  of the papacy, by quelling the mutinous barons of the Campagna, and  by so crushing the more distant seigneurs as to render their states  a speedy and easy prey to Julius II. On the other hand, the openly  simoniacal practices which prevailed during his reign, the strong  measures adopted to raise money for his private ends by a lavish  scale of indulgences, and, generally, the unscrupulous employment of  the power of the keys and the treasures of the Church for unworthy  purposes, all tended to alienate men's minds, and to stir those  doubts which the different, but not less injudicious, policy of his  immediate successors ripened into schism.    [Footnote *10: This is probably an exaggeration. Alexander VI. was  without reticence in his sins, and so has not escaped whipping.

The Inquisition  was introduced into Italy in 1542, and the _Index Librorum  Prohibitorum_ was established. But the congregation of the Index  was not established till the Council of Trent. Magical books were  prohibited as early as the Council of Nice, 325.]    Favoured by youth, constitution, and energy of mind, Cesare Borgia  wrestled successfully with the deadly ingredients which he had  inadvertently swallowed. He is said to have been saved by being  frequently placed in the carcass of a newly-killed bullock or mule,  and, whether in consequence of this treatment, or of the inflammatory  nature of the potion, to have lost the whole skin of his body. He had  flattered himself that, foreseeing every possible contingency which  his father's death could develop, he had so planned his measures  as to secure, in any event, his own safety, and the maintenance of  his authority. But, never having anticipated being disabled from  action at that very juncture, his well-laid schemes fell to the  ground, a signal illustration of the proverb, \"Man proposes, God  disposes.\" By means of Don Michelotto, he was, however, able to draw  round the Vatican a body of twelve thousand devoted troops, and that  unscrupulous agent executed his instructions by seizing about 500,000  ducats in money, jewels, and valuables, from the Pope's apartment,  before his death was published.    The Diaries of Sanuto give a lively description of the immediate  effects of Alexander's death on Lower Italy,--the exultations of the  people, the prompt movements of the Campagna barons, the hesitation  of Valentino, the intrigues of the cardinals. As soon as the good  news transpired, Rome rose in arms against the Spaniards; and the  Colonna and the Orsini, entering at the head of their troops,  willingly aided in spoiling and slaughtering these countrymen of  the Borgia, who \"could nowhere find holes to hide in.\" Even their  cardinals narrowly escaped a general massacre; and on the 8th of  September, a proclamation by the College cleared the city of these  foreigners on pain of the gibbet. Duke Valentino, although prostrated  in strength, and \"seeming as if burnt from the middle downwards,\"  was not without formidable resources. His hope was, that in the  distracted state of Rome, the cardinals would provide for their  personal safety by holding the conclave in St. Angelo, where the  election would be in his own hands. This calculation was, however,  defeated by their assembling at the Minerva convent, guarded by the  barons of Bracciano and Palestrina, with the bravest of the citizens,  and protected by barricades which withstood an assault by the  redoubted Michelotto. Still his troops were staunch, the Vatican and  St. Angelo were his, and he had secured the treasure of the Holy See.  But his nerve gave way, and after turning the castle guns against the  Orsini palace on Monte Giordano, he fled in a litter to the French  camp without the gates, on the 1st of September, and thence made his  way to the stronghold of Nepi. This vacillation brought its fitting  recompense, and lost him the advantages of his position. Hesitating  betwixt the Colonna and Orsini factions, wavering between Spanish and  French interests, his friends dropped off, his forces melted away,  and he lost the favourable moment for swaying the papal election.    The rival parties in the conclave, having had no time to mature their  plans, in consequence of the late Pontiff's sudden decease, trusted  to strengthen their respective interests by delay, and so were  unanimous in choosing, on the 22nd of September, the most feeble of  their body, the respected Piccolomini, who survived his exaltation  as Pius III. but twenty-six days. The state of matters at Naples  added to the general embarrassment. The ceaseless struggles for that  crown had of late taken a new turn, the contest being now between  Louis of France and Ferdinand of Spain. The Borgia, long adherents  of the former, had recently inclined to the Spanish side; but their  influence was now irretrievably gone.         *NOTE.--The following is a list of the chief       conquests of Cesare:--         City.
