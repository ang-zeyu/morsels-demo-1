There were five men and one woman on the raft.  Occasionally we were swept off into the sea, but always managed to crawl  back.    \"A sailor lighted a cigarette and flung the match carelessly among the  women. Several screamed, fearing they would be set on fire. The sailor  replied: 'We are going to hell anyway and we might as well be cremated  now as then.'\"    A huge cake of ice was the means of aiding Emile Portaleppi, of Italy,  in his hairbreadth escape from death when the Titanic went down.  Portaleppi, a second class passenger, was awakened by the explosion of  one of the bulkheads of the ship. He hurried to the deck, strapped a  life-preserver around him and leaped into the sea. With the aid of the  preserver and by holding to a cake of ice he managed to keep afloat  until one of the life-boats picked him up. There were thirty-five other  people in the boat, he said, when he was hauled aboard.    THE COWARD    Somewhere in the shadow of the appalling Titanic disaster slinks--still  living by the inexplicable grace of God--a cur in human shape, to-day  the most despicable human being in all the world.    In that grim midnight hour, already great in history, he found himself  hemmed in by the band of heroes whose watchword and countersign rang out  across the deep--\"Women and children first!\"    What did he do? He scuttled to the stateroom deck, put on a woman's  skirt, a woman's hat and a woman's veil, and picking his crafty way back  among the brave and chivalric men who guarded the rail of the doomed  ship, he filched a seat in one of the life-boats and saved his skin.    His name is on that list of branded rescued men who were neither picked  up from the sea when the ship went down nor were in the boats under  orders to help get them safe away. His identity is not yet known, though  it will be in good time. So foul an act as that will out like murder.    The eyes of strong men who have read this crowded record of golden  deeds, who have read and re-read that deathless roll of honor of the  dead, are still wet with tears of pity and of pride. This man still  lives. Surely he was born and saved to set for men a new standard by  which to measure infamy and shame.    It is well that there was sufficient heroism on board the Titanic to  neutralize the horrors of the cowardice. When the first order was given  for the men to stand back, there were a dozen or more who pushed forward  and said that men would be needed to row the life-boats and that they  would volunteer for the work.    The officers tried to pick out the ones that volunteered merely for  service and to eliminate those who volunteered merely to save their own  lives. This elimination process however, was not wholly successful.      THE DOOMED MEN    As the ship began to settle to starboard, heeling at an angle of nearly  forty-five degrees, those who had believed it was all right to stick by  the ship began to have doubts, and a few jumped into the sea. They were  followed immediately by others, and in a few minutes there were scores  swimming around. Nearly all of them wore life-preservers. One man, who  had a Pomeranian dog, leaped overboard with it and striking a piece of  wreckage was badly stunned. He recovered after a few minutes and swam  toward one of the life-boats and was taken aboard.    Said one survivor, speaking of the men who remained on the ship. \"There  they stood--Major Butt, Colonel Astor waving a farewell to his wife,  Mr. Thayer, Mr. Case, Mr. Clarence Moore, Mr. Widener, all  multimillionaires, and hundreds of other men, bravely smiling at us all.  Never have I seen such chivalry and fortitude. Such courage in the face  of fate horrible to contemplate filled us even then with wonder and  admiration.\"    Why were men saved? ask: others who seek to make the occasional male  survivor a hissing scorn; and yet the testimony makes it clear that for  a long time during that ordeal the more frightful position seemed to  many to be in the frail boats in the vast relentless sea, and that some  men had to be tumbled into the boats under orders from the officers.  Others express the deepest indignation that 210 sailors were rescued,  the testimony shows that most of these sailors were in the welter of ice  and water into which they had been thrown from the ship's deck when she  sank; they were human beings and so were picked up and saved.      \"WOMEN AND CHILDREN FIRST\"    The one alleviating circumstance in the otherwise immitigable tragedy  is the fact that so many of the men stood aside really with out the  necessity for the order, \"Women and children first,\" and insisted that  the weaker sex should first have places in the boats.    There were men whose word of command swayed boards of directors,  governed institutions, disposed of millions. They were accustomed merely  to pronounce a wish to have it gratified. Thousands \"posted at their  bidding\"; the complexion of the market altered hue when they nodded;  they bought what they wanted, and for one of the humblest fishing smacks  or a dory they could have given the price that was paid to build and  launch the ship that has become the most imposing mausoleum that ever  housed the bones of men since the Pyramids rose from the desert sands.    But these men stood aside--one can see them!--and gave place not merely  to the delicate and the refined, but to the scared Czech woman from the  steerage, with her baby at her breast; the Croatian with a toddler by  her side, coming through the very gate of Death and out of the mouth of  Hell to the imagined Eden of America.    To many of those who went it was harder to go than to stay there on the  vessel gaping with its mortal wounds and ready to go down. It meant that  tossing on the waters they must wait in suspense, hour after hour even  after the lights of the ship were engulfed in appalling darkness, hoping  against hope for the miracle of a rescue dearer to them than their own  lives.    It was the tradition of Anglo-Saxon heroism that was fulfilled in the  frozen seas during the black hours of Sunday night. The heroism was that  of the women who went, as well as of the men who remained!        CHAPTER VII. LEFT TO THEIR FATE    COOLNESS AND HEROISM OF THOSE LEFT TO PERISH--SUICIDE OF  MURDOCK--CAPTAIN SMITH'S END--THE SHIP'S BAND PLAYS A NOBLE HYMN AS THE  VESSEL GOES DOWN    THE general feeling aboard the ship after the boats had left her  sides was that she would not survive her wound, but the passengers who  remained aboard displayed the utmost heroism.    William T. Stead, the famous English journalist, was so litt{l}e alarmed  that he calmly discussed with one of the passengers the probable height  of the iceberg after the Titanic had shot into it.    Confidence in the ability of the Titanic to remain afloat doubtlessly  led many of the passengers to death. The theory that the great ship was  unsinkable remained with hundreds who had entrusted themselves to the  gigantic hulk, long after the officers knew that the vessel could not  survive.    The captain and officers behaved with superb gallantry, and there was  perfect order and discipline among those who were aboard, even after all  hope had been abandoned for the salvation of the ship.    Many women went down, steerage women who were unable to get to the upper  decks where the boats were launched, maids who were overlooked in the  confusion, cabin passengers who refused to desert their husbands or who  reached the decks after the last of the life-boats was gone and the ship  was settling for her final plunge to the bottom of the Atlantic.    Narratives of survivors do not bear out the supposition that the final  hours upon the vessel's decks were passed in darkness. They say the  electric lighting plant held out until the last, and that even as they  watched the ship sink, from their places in the floating life-boats, her  lights were gleaming in long rows as she plunged under by the head. Just  before she sank, some of the refugees say, the ship broke in two abaft  the engine room after the bulkhead explosions had occurred.    COLONEL ASTOR'S DEATH      To Colonel Astor's death Philip Mock bears this testimony.    \"Many men were hanging on to rafts in the sea. William T. Stead and  Colonel Astor were among them. Their feet and hands froze and they had  to let go. Both were drowned.\"    The last man among the survivors to speak to Colonel Astor was K.  Whiteman, the ship's barber.    \"I shaved Colonel Astor Sunday afternoon,\" said Whiteman. \"He was a  pleasant, affable man, and that awful night when I found myself standing  beside him on the passenger deck, helping to put the women into the  boats, I spoke to him.    \"'Where is your life-belt?' I asked him.    \"'I didn't think there would be any need of it,' he said.    \"'Get one while there is time,' I told him. 'The last boat is gone, and  we are done for.'    \"'No,' he said, 'I think there are some life-boats to be launched, and  we may get on one of them.'    \"'There are no life-rafts,' I told him, 'and the ship is going to sink.  I am going to jump overboard and take a chance on swimming out and being  picked up by one of the boats. Better come along.'    \"'No, thank you,' he said, calmly, 'I think I'll have to stick.'    \"I asked him if he would mind shaking hands with me. He said, 'With  pleasure,' gave me a hearty grip, and then I climbed up on the rail and  jumped overboard. I was in the water nearly four hours before one of the  boats picked me up.\"      CAPTAIN WASHED OVERBOARD    Murdock's last orders were to Quartermaster Moody and a few other petty  officers who had taken their places in the rigid discipline of the ship  and were lowering the boats. Captain Smith came up to him on the bridge  several times and then rushed down again. They spoke to one another only  in monosyllables.    There were stories that Captain Smith, when he saw the ship actually  going down, had committed suicide."]]]
