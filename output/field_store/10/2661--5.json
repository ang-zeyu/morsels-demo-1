Wondering what the message could contain and who had sent it, Dick  tore open the envelope and read the brief communication.  As his  eyes met the words his head seemed to swim around, so bewildered  was he by what was written there.    \"What is it, Dick?\" came from Tom and Sam.    \"It's from Uncle Randolph.  He wants us to come home at once.  He  says--but read it for yourselves,\" and the elder Rover handed  over the message, which ran as follows:    \"Have just received a strange message from the sea, supposed to be  written by your father.  Come home at once.  RANDOLPH ROVER.\"    \"My gracious!  News from father!\" gasped Tom.    \"Is he really alive?\" burst out Sam.  \"Oh, I pray Heaven the news  is true!\"    \"A strange message from the sea,\" repeated Dick.  \"I wonder what  he can mean?\"    \"Perhaps it's a message that was picked up by some steamer,\"  suggested Sam.  \"Anyway, uncle wants us to come home at once.\"    \"He doesn't say all of us.  The message is addressed to me.\"    \"But of course he wanted all of us to come,\" put in Tom.  \"Anyway,  four horses couldn't hold me back!\" he continued determinedly.    \"Nor me,\" chimed in Sam.  He drew a long breath.  \"If we hurry up  we can catch the noon boat at Cedarville for Ithaca.\"    \"Yes, and the evening train for Oak Run,\" finished Tom.  \"Hurry  up, Dick!\"    Dick was willing.  To tell the truth, that message had fired him  as he had never been fired before.  He burst into the captain's  office pell-mell, with Tom and Sam on his heels, to explain the  situation.  Ten minutes later--and even this time seemed an age  to the brothers--they were hurrying into their ordinary clothing  and packing, their satchels, while Peleg Snuggers was hitching up  to take them to the landing at Cedarville.    \"Good-by to you, and good luck!\" shouted Frank, as they clambered  into the wagon, and many other cadets set up a shout.  Then the  wagon rattled off.  The Rover boys had turned their backs on dear  old Putnam Hall for a long while to come.          CHAPTER XI    THE ROVERS REACH A CONCLUSION      For the three Rover boys the Golden Star could not make the trip  from Cedarville to Ithaca fast enough.  They fretted over every  delay, and continually wondered if there was any likelihood of  their missing the train which was to take them to Oak Run, the  nearest railroad station to Valley Brook farm, their uncle's home.    But the train was not missed; instead, they had to wait half an  hour for it.  During this time they procured dinner, although Dick  felt so strange he could scarcely eat a mouthful.    \"Uncle Randolph doesn't say much,\" he murmured to Tom.  \"He might  have said more.\"    \"We'll know everything before we go to bed, Dick,\" answered his  brother.  \"I don't believe Uncle Randolph would telegraph unless  the news was good.\"    They indulged in all sorts of speculation, as the train sped on  its way to Oak Run.  When the latter place was reached it was  dark, and they found Jack Ness, the hired man, waiting for them  with the carriage.    \"There, I  knowed it,\" grinned Jack.  \"Mr. Rover calculated that  only Dick would come, but I said we'd have 'em all.\"    \"And what is this news of my father?\" questioned Dick.    \"It's a message as was picked up off the coast of Africky,\"  replied Ness.  \"Mr. Rover didn't explain very clearly to me.  He's  a good deal excited, and so is the missus.\"    \"And so are we,\" remarked Sam.  \"Can it be that father is on his  way home?\"    \"I calculate not, Master Sam.  Leas'wise, your uncle didn't say  so,\" concluded the hired man.    Never had the horses made better time than they did now, and yet  the boys urged Ness continually to drive faster.  Swift River was  soon crossed--that stream where Sam had once had such a stirring  adventure--and they bowled along past the Fox and other farms.    \"Here we are!\" shouted Dick at last.    \"There is Uncle Randolph out on the porch to greet us!\"    \"And there is Aunt Martha!\" added Sam.  \"I do believe they look  happy, don't you, Tom?\"    \"They certainly don't look sad,\" was the noncommittal answer; and  then the carriage swept up to the horse-block and the three boys  alighted.    \"All of you, eh?\" were Randolph Rover's first words.  \"Well,  perhaps it is just as well so.\"    \"We simply couldn't stay behind, uncle,\"  said Sam.  \"And we are  dying to know what it all means.\"    \"But you must have supper first,\" put in Aunt Martha, as she gave  one and another a motherly kiss.  \"I know riding on the cars  usually makes Tom tremendously hungry.\"    \"Well eat after we have had the news,\" said Tom.  \"We're dying to  know all, as Sam says.\"    \"The news is rather perplexing, to tell the truth,\" said Randolph  Rover, as he led the way into the library of the spacious home.  \"I hardly know what to make of it.\"    \"Who brought it?\" questioned Dick.    \"It came by mail--a bulky letter all the way from Cape Town,  Africa.\"    \"From father?\"    \"No, from a Captain Townsend, who, it seems, commands the clipper  ship Rosabel.  He sent me one letter inclosing another.  The first  letter is from himself.\"    \"And is the second letter from father?\" burst out Tom.    \"Yes, my boy.\"    \"Oh, let us see it!\" came in a shout from all three of the Rover  boys.    \"You had better read the captain's communication first,\" answered  Randolph Rover.  \"Then you will be more apt to understand the  other.  Or shall I read it for the benefit of all?\"    \"Yes, yes, you read it, Uncle Randolph,\" was the answer.    \"The letter is dated at Cape Town, and was written a little over a  month ago.  It is addressed to 'Randolph Rover, or to Richard,  Thomas, or Samuel Rover, New York City,' and is further marked  'Highly Important-Do Not Lose or Destroy.'\"    \"And what is in it?\" asked the impatient Tom.  \"Do hurry and tell  us, Uncle Randolph.\"    And then his uncle read as follows:    \"TO THE ROVER FAMILY, New York:    \"I am a stranger to you, but I deem it my duty to write to you on  account of something which occurred on the 12th day of April last,  while my clipper ship Rosabel, bound from Boston, U. S. A., to  Cape Town, Africa, was sailing along the coast of Congo but a few  miles due west from the mouth of the Congo River.    \"Our ship had been sent in by a heavy gale but the wind had gone  down, and we were doing more drifting than sailing to the  southward when the lookout espied a man on a small raft which was  drifting toward us.    \"On coming closer, we discovered that the man was white and that  he looked half starved.  We put out a boat and rescued the poor  creature  but he had suffered so much from spear wounds and  starvation that, on being taken on board of our ship, he  immediately relapsed into insensibility, and out of this we failed  to arouse him.  He died at sundown, and we failed, even to learn  him name or home address.    \"On searching the dead man's pockets we came across the enclosed  letter, addressed to you, and much soiled from water.  As you will  see, it is dated more than a year back and was evidently in the  possession of the man who died for some time.  Probably he started  out to deliver it, or to reach some point from which it could be  mailed.    \"I trust that the message becomes the means of rescuing the  Anderson Rover mentioned in the letter, and I will be pleased to  learn if this letter of mine is received.  The Rosabel sails from  Cape Town to Brazil as soon as her cargo can be discharged and  another taken on.    \"Very truly yours,    \"JOHN V. TOWNSEND, Captain.\"    As Randolph Rover ceased reading there was a brief silence, broken  by Tom.    \"So the man who died held a letter.  And what is in that, Uncle  Randolph?\"    \"I will read it to you, boys, although that is a difficult matter,  for the writing is uneven and much blurred.  On one part of the  sheet there is a blot of blood--the blood, I presume--of the  poor fellow who was trying to deliver the communication.\"    Unfolding the stained document, Randolph Rover bent closer to the  table lamp that he might read the more easily.  As for the boys,  they fairly held their breaths, that no spoken word might escape  them.    \"The letter is addressed to me,\" said the uncle.  \"But the  envelope is, as you can see, very much torn.  I will read,\" and he  did so.    \"NIWILI CAMP, on the Congo,    \"July the 18th, 189--.    \"DEAR BROTHER RANDOLPH:    \"If, by the goodness of God, this reaches you, I trust that you  will set out without delay to my assistance.    \"I write under great difficulties, as a prisoner, of the Bumwo  tribe of natives, ruled by King Susko.    \"I have discovered the secret of a gold mine here, and the king  will not let me go, fearing that I will tell the outside world of  my discovery and bring the English or French here to slay him and  his followers.  They know nothing here of Americans.    \"I entrust this to the care of an English sailor who is going to  try to make his escape.  I cannot go myself, having had my leg  broken by a blow from one of my jailers.    \"I am sick and weak in body, and it may be that I will soon die.  Yet I beg of you to do what you can for me.  If I die, I trust you  to be a father to my dear boys, Dick, Tom, and Sam, and ask Martha  for me to be a mother to them.    \"The king expects soon to remove to another camp at a place called  Rhunda Konoka (the Water Well).  Perhaps he will take me along, or  else he may slay me.    \"All those who were with me are dead excepting several natives who  have joined the Burnwo tribe.    \"Good-by, and do what you can until you are certain that I am  dead.    \"Your loving brother,    \"ANDERSON ROVER\"    When Randolph Rover ceased reading he saw that there were tears in  the eyes of all of the boys, and that his wife was also crying.  His own voice had had to be cleared continually.  To all the  letter was like a message from the grave.    \"And that is all?\" questioned Dick, breaking the silence.    \"That"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5780"],[0,"The Rover Boys at School; Or, The Cadets of Putnam Hall (#10)"],[1,"had  done and how Josiah Crabtree had treated him.    The window of the guardroom was but five feet from the ground.  In  front of it, however, was an iron fence, placed in the form of a  semicircle, at a distance of about ten feet from the opening.  The  fence was higher than Dick's head, and the iron pickets were  sharp-pointed.    \"The window to the room is shut,\" announced the elder Rover, after  an inspection in the semi-darkness.  \"It's a shame, in this warm  weather.  Poor Tom will be half smothered to death!\"    \"Wait till I attract his attention,\" said Sam.  Catching up a clod  of grass and dirt he threw it against one of the window panes.    A minute of suspense followed, but no face appeared at the window.    \"That's queer,\" said Fred.  \"It seems to me he would show himself  if he was there.\"    \"Perhaps he, can't,\" said Sam.  \"He may be chained up in the other  end of the room.\"    \"I'm going to make sure,\" said Dick determinedly.  \"Sam and Fred,  both of you give me a boost up.\"    \"But how will you get back?\"    \"You can give me another boost through the pickets.\"    \"Hurrah! so we can!\" cried Sam.  \"All right; up you go!\"    And up Dick did go, so rapidly that he almost fell over the top of  the iron barrier.    \"Now, who has a match?\" he asked.    \"Here you are,\" said Fred, and passed over several.    Stepping to the window, Dick tapped upon it, and at the same time  struck a light, for the room within was pitch-dark.  The next  instant he muttered a cry of disgust.  \"Sold!\"    \"What's that?\" came from Sam and Fred.    \"The room is empty.\"    \"Then there must be some mistake,\" said Fred.  \"Can you see all  over inside?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Sure Tom isn't asleep in a corner or on a couch--if there is  one?\" put in Sam.  \"He would go to sleep if he could.\"    \"He isn't here--no doubt of it,\" answered Dick, after striking a  second match and making another inspection. \"Oh!\"    Dick blew out the match in a hurry and started back for the fence.  He had seen the door of the guardroom open and Josiah Crabtree  come in.    The head assistant of Putnam Hall saw the light of the match and  by it obtained a good view of Dick's face.    \"Ha! that youth has come here to assist his brother to escape!\"  was the conclusion he reached.  He darted for the window and threw  it up.    \"Come back here, Master Rover!\" he cried, as he saw Dick trying to  mount the fence.    \"Don't you go!\" whispered Sam, and tried to assist Dick from the  other side, while Fred did the same.    Josiah Crabtree would have leaped from the window, but the bars  held him back.    \"I'll get you yet!\" he ejaculated wrathfully, and, turning, ran  from the guardroom, with the intention of capturing Dick on the  parade ground.          CHAPTER IX    A STRANGE MEETING IN THE WOODS.      To go back to Tom, at the time he was left alone by the head  assistant of Putnam Hall, after refusing to give up the keys to  his satchel and trunk.    \"I've put my foot into it now,\" thought the boy dismally.  \"I  wonder what Captain Putnam will say to all this when he hears of  it?  Of course old Crabtree will make out the worst possible case  against me.\"    It was too dark to see much, and he dropped on the couch.  He was  worried a good deal, yet he was not one to take anything too  deeply to heart.    Before long a waiter appeared with a tray containing a big bowl of  bread and milk.  Had Josiah Crabtree had his own way, he would  have sent only bread and water for the lad's supper, but such a  proceeding would have been contrary to Captain Putnam's rule.  The  kind captain realized that his pupils were but boys and should not  be treated as real prisoners, even when they did break the academy  rules.    \"Heah is yo' suppah, sah!\" announced Alexander, the waiter, as he  set the tray on the table.  \"Sorry I can't leave the light, sah.\"  He referred to a lamp, also, on the tray, which he now removed.    \"What have you got?\" asked Tom, sitting up.    \"Bowl of bread and milk, sah.\"    \"Is that what they give visitors for supper?\"    \"Gracious, sah, is yo' a visitah, sah?\"    \"I consider myself as such until I am placed on the muster roll.\"    At this Alexander scratched his woolly head.  \"Well, sah, I don't  know nuffin about dat, sah.  I has to obey Mr. Crabtree's oahdahs,  sah.\"    \"Has Captain Putnam come back yet?\"    \"No, sah, an' he sent word dat he didn't think he could git back,  sah, before morning, sah.\"    \"Humph!  Then I'll have to stay here until that time.\"    \"I reckon so, sah.\"    \"It's a jolly shame.\"    \"Dat's right, sah,\" and Alexander grinned.    \"Well, leave the bread and milk.  It's better than nothing.  But  hold on.  Who are you?\"    \"Alexander Pop, sah, at yo' service, sah,\" and again the colored  man grinned.  He was a short, fat fellow, the very embodiment of  good nature.    \"Well, Alexander, if you are at my service, supposing you get me  something else to eat beside this bread and milk.\"    \"Oh, sah, I couldn't do dat.\"    \"Yes, you could.  Here is a quarter.  Don't you want to earn  that?\"  And Tom held out the silver piece.    \"Mr. Crabtree would hab me discharged if he cotched me, Master  Rober.\"    \"Then don't let him catch you, Aleck, my boy.\"    At this the negro laughed and showed his immense ivories.    \"Yo' is jest de boy I dun like to see, sah,\" he said.  \"Jess wait  an' I'll do wot I can fo! You but mum's de word, sah-eh?\"    \"I never peach, Aleck; it's only a coward that does that,\"  concluded Tom.    The negro disappeared from the room, but reappeared in less than  ten minutes with something done up in a napkin.    \"Dare you am, sah,\" he said, \"two tongue sandwiches and a big  piece of layer cake, sah, all I could git, fo' Mrs. Green am werry  sharp.  And here is a bit of candle, sah, for a light.  But please  don't let 'em know I brought yo' de things, sah.\"    \"Never a word, Aleck, thank you,\" answered Tom, and handed over  the quarter.    Left again to himself, Tom lost no time in making way, not only  with the sandwiches and cake, but also some of the bread and milk,  for his day's traveling had left him tremendously hungry.  The bit  of candle was less than two inches long, and began to splutter  just as the meal was finished.    A rattle at the door caused the lad to sweep the cake crumbs out  of sight, blow out the candle, and pocket the tiny bit left.  Then  the light of a lamp lit up the guardroom, and Josiah Crabtree came  in.    \"Well, Rover, have you enjoyed your supper?\" he asked coldly, as  he glanced at the half empty bowl.    \"Very much,\" was the youth's equally cold reply.    \"You like bread and milk, then,\" was Crabtree's sarcastic  rejoinder.    \"Nothing better, sir, for supper.\"    The head assistant bit his lip, and then set down the lamp.    \"Rover, don't you think, you are making a bad beginning?\" he said  after a pause.    \"I don't understand you, Mr. Crabtree.\"    \"Any other boy on joining a school would wish to make his entrance  as creditable as possible.\"    \"But I haven't joined this school yet.\"    \"I won't argue that point.\"    \"I wasn't even on your grounds, but in the public highway--and  there shot off--what?  A simple firecracker.  And for that you  hauled me to this place, and treat me like one who has broken half  the laws of the land.  If Captain Putnam upholds you in this  matter, do you know what I shall do?\"    \"Make an additional fool of yourself, I presume.\"    \"I shall write home to my guardian that I do not consider Putnam  Hall a proper boarding academy for any boy, and that I want to be  put somewhere else.\"    At these outspoken words Josiah Crabtree grew pale.  His great  unpopularity was already having its effect upon Captain Putnam,  and he was afraid that if he should be the means of losing a pupil  it might cost him his place, as much as he knew that the captain  did not favor changes in his staff of instructors.    \"Don't be unreasonable, my lad,\" he said, but his tone was much  milder than before.    \"I don't think I am unreasonable.\"    \"The road is one belonging to this institution--in brief, a  private road.  You became a pupil here when you entered our  carriage, that, which brought you here.\"    \"Does everybody who rides in that carriage become a Putnam Hall  pupil?\" demanded Tom.    He saw that he was worrying Crabtree, and resolved to keep it up.    \"Well--er--we won't argue that point.\"    \"Then supposing we don't argue anything until Captain Putnam comes  back?  In the meantime if you will release me I'll go to  Cedarville and put up at the hotel for the night.\"    \"I shall not release you.\"    \"All right, then.  But if my guardian takes me away, mark my  words, you shall stand a personal lawsuit for having locked me up  here without having any right to do so.\"    \"Why--er--this to me--me, the head assistant here?\" screamed  Josiah Crabtree.    In his rage he ran over to Tom and caught him by the ear.    He had scarcely done so than Tom put out one foot, gave the  teacher a shove, and down went Crabtree flat on his back.    \"You villain!\" gasped the head assistant, as he scrambled to his  feet.    \"Don't you pinch my ear again,\" retorted Tom.    The door was open, and before Crabtree could stop him he ran out  into the hallway.    \"Hold on!\"    \"Not much!\"    \"It will be the worse for you!\"    \"I'll risk that.\"    \"Stop him, somebody!\" screamed Josiah Crabtree at the top of his  voice.    Without waiting, Tom ran down the hallway.  He knew not where he  was going, and, coming, to a door, slipped through.  He now found  himself in the rear of the Hall and a few seconds later ran across  the back garden and dove into the farm lands.    \"Free once more,\" he thought.  \"And I shan't go back until I am  certain Captain Putnam is on hand to receive me.  I wonder how  Dick and Sam are faring?\"    Thinking that his brothers would soon learn of his escape, and not  wishing to be caught, he hurried on until the farm lands were  passed and he found himself in a woods."]]]
