It is easily comprehended, and can be played by any number  of players, old and young. It requires no other apparatus  than a trolley car of the ordinary type, a mile or two  of track, and a few thousand volts of electricity. It is  called:       The Suburban Trolley Car     A Holiday Game for Old and Young.    The chief part in the game is taken by two players who  station themselves one at each end of the car, and who  adopt some distinctive costumes to indicate that they  are \"it.\" The other players occupy the body of the car,  or take up their position at intervals along the track.    The object of each player should be to enter the car as  stealthily as possible in such a way as to escape the  notice of the players in distinctive dress. Should he  fail to do this he must pay the philopena or forfeit. Of  these there are two: philopena No. 1, the payment of five  cents, and philopena No. 2, being thrown off the car by  the neck. Each player may elect which philopena he will  pay. Any player who escapes paying the philopena scores  one.    The players who are in the car may elect to adopt a  standing attitude, or to seat themselves, but no player  may seat himself in the lap of another without the second  player's consent. The object of those who elect to remain  standing is to place their feet upon the toes of those  who sit; when they do this they score. The object of  those who elect to sit is to elude the feet of the standing  players. Much merriment is thus occasioned.    The player in distinctive costume at the front of the  car controls a crank, by means of which he is enabled to  bring the car to a sudden stop, or to cause it to plunge  violently forward. His aim in so doing is to cause all  the standing players to fall over backward. Every time  he does this he scores. For this purpose he is generally  in collusion with the other player in distinctive costume,  whose business it is to let him know by a series of bells  and signals when the players are not looking, and can be  easily thrown down. A sharp fall of this sort gives rise  to no end of banter and good-natured drollery, directed  against the two players who are \"it.\"    Should a player who is thus thrown backward save himself  from falling by sitting down in the lap of a female  player, he scores one. Any player who scores in this  manner is entitled to remain seated while he may count  six, after which he must remove himself or pay philopena  No. 2.    Should the player who controls the crank perceive a player  upon the street desirous of joining in the game by entering  the car, his object should be: primo, to run over him  and kill him; secundo, to kill him by any other means in  his power; tertio, to let him into the car, but to exact  the usual philopena.    Should a player, in thus attempting to get on the car  from without, become entangled in the machinery, the  player controlling the crank shouts \"huff!\" and the car  is supposed to pass over him. All within the car score  one.    A fine spice of the ludicrous may be added to the game  by each player pretending that he has a destination or  stopping-place, where he would wish to alight. It now  becomes the aim of the two players who are \"it\" to carry  him past his point. A player who is thus carried beyond  his imaginary stopping-place must feign a violent passion,  and imitate angry gesticulations. He may, in addition,  feign a great age or a painful infirmity, which will be  found to occasion the most convulsive fun for the other  players in the game.    These are the main outlines of this most amusing pastime.  Many other agreeable features may, of course, be readily  introduced by persons of humour and imagination.          Number Fifty-Six    What I narrate was told me one winter's evening by my  friend Ah-Yen in the little room behind his laundry.  Ah-Yen is a quiet little celestial with a grave and  thoughtful face, and that melancholy contemplative  disposition so often noticed in his countrymen. Between  myself and Ah-Yen there exists a friendship of some years'  standing, and we spend many a long evening in the dimly  lighted room behind his shop, smoking a dreamy pipe  together and plunged in silent meditation. I am chiefly  attracted to my friend by the highly imaginative cast of  his mind, which is, I believe, a trait of the Eastern  character and which enables him to forget to a great  extent the sordid cares of his calling in an inner life  of his own creation. Of the keen, analytical side of his  mind, I was in entire ignorance until the evening of  which I write.    The room where we sat was small and dingy, with but little  furniture except our chairs and the little table at which  we filled and arranged our pipes, and was lighted only  by a tallow candle. There were a few pictures on the  walls, for the most part rude prints cut from the columns  of the daily press and pasted up to hide the bareness of  the room. Only one picture was in any way noticeable, a  portrait admirably executed in pen and ink. The face was  that of a young man, a very beautiful face, but one of  infinite sadness. I had long been aware, although I know  not how, that Ah-Yen had met with a great sorrow, and  had in some way connected the fact with this portrait.  I had always refrained, however, from asking him about  it, and it was not until the evening in question that I  knew its history.    We had been smoking in silence for some time when Ah-Yen  spoke. My friend is a man of culture and wide reading,  and his English is consequently perfect in its construction;  his speech is, of course, marked by the lingering liquid  accent of his country which I will not attempt to  reproduce.    \"I see,\" he said, \"that you have been examining the  portrait of my unhappy friend, Fifty-Six. I have never  yet told you of my bereavement, but as to-night is the  anniversary of his death, I would fain speak of him for  a while.\"    Ah-Yen paused; I lighted my pipe afresh, and nodded to  him to show that I was listening.    \"I do not know,\" he went on, \"at what precise time  Fifty-Six came into my life. I could indeed find it out  by examining my books, but I have never troubled to do  so. Naturally I took no more interest in him at first  than in any other of my customers--less, perhaps, since  he never in the course of our connection brought his  clothes to me himself but always sent them by a boy. When  I presently perceived that he was becoming one of my  regular customers, I allotted to him his number, Fifty-Six,  and began to speculate as to who and what he was. Before  long I had reached several conclusions in regard to my  unknown client. The quality of his linen showed me that,  if not rich, he was at any rate fairly well off. I could  see that he was a young man of regular Christian life,  who went out into society to a certain extent; this I  could tell from his sending the same number of articles  to the laundry, from his washing always coming on Saturday  night, and from the fact that he wore a dress shirt about  once a week. In disposition he was a modest, unassuming  fellow, for his collars were only two inches high.\"    I stared at Ah-Yen in some amazement, the recent  publications of a favourite novelist had rendered me  familiar with this process of analytical reasoning, but  I was prepared for no such revelations from my Eastern  friend.    \"When I first knew him,\" Ah-Yen went on, \"Fifty-Six was  a student at the university. This, of course, I did not  know for some time. I inferred it, however, in the course  of time, from his absence from town during the four summer  months, and from the fact that during the time of the  university examinations the cuffs of his shirts came to  me covered with dates, formulas, and propositions in  geometry. I followed him with no little interest through  his university career. During the four years which it  lasted, I washed for him every week; my regular connection  with him and the insight which my observation gave me  into the lovable character of the man, deepened my first  esteem into a profound affection and I became most anxious  for his success. I helped him at each succeeding  examination, as far as lay in my power, by starching his  shirts half-way to the elbow, so as to leave him as much  room as possible for annotations. My anxiety during the  strain of his final examination I will not attempt to  describe. That Fifty-Six was undergoing the great crisis  of his academic career, I could infer from the state of  his handkerchiefs which, in apparent unconsciousness, he  used as pen-wipers during the final test. His conduct  throughout the examination bore witness to the moral  development which had taken place in his character during  his career as an undergraduate; for the notes upon his  cuffs which had been so copious at his earlier examinations  were limited now to a few hints, and these upon topics  so intricate as to defy an ordinary memory. It was with  a thrill of joy that I at last received in his laundry  bundle one Saturday early in June, a ruffled dress shirt,  the bosom of which was thickly spattered with the spillings  of the wine-cup, and realized that Fifty-Six had banqueted  as a Bachelor of Arts.    \"In the following winter the habit of wiping his pen upon  his handkerchief, which I had remarked during his final  examination, became chronic with him, and I knew that he  had entered upon the study of law. He worked hard during  that year, and dress shirts almost disappeared from his  weekly bundle. It was in the following winter, the second  year of his legal studies, that the tragedy of his life  began. I became aware that a change had come over his  laundry; from one, or at most two a week, his dress shirts  rose to four, and silk handkerchiefs began to replace  his linen ones. It dawned upon me that Fifty-Six was"]]]
