I think there is no one with whom I am acquainted      that believes more fervently than I do that in order to succeed in      preaching the gospel one must do so by the gift and by the power of      the Holy Ghost. I know that the Lord has given instruction to the      Elders of the Church that separates their methods of work, as wide      as day is separated from the night, from those methods of preaching      adopted by the world--I know that he has said: \"Think not what      ye shall say, but in the very hour that it is needed it shall be      given to you that which you shall say.\" But while I remember that,      I remember also the admonition which he has given to the Elders in      the self same passage, to the effect that they should \"treasure up      continually the words of life,\" a part of the instruction that I      have sometimes thought is too much neglected. I believe we shall      best succeed if, when treasuring up the words of life, we do it      systematically; that instead of being like an unwise builder who      throws into one promiscuous heap lime, sand, bricks and frames,      together with a hundred and one other materials that enter into      the construction of his building, that each be placed by itself,      carefully stored away where the workmen can readily find it and      bring each part to the building as the builder has need. So, I      say, systematize your efforts in reading, in thought, in speech,      and after you have done all that, I believe that you will have all      the more claim upon the Spirit and blessing of God. After you have      made the attempt to carry out the instructions which our Father in      heaven has given in respect of storing your minds with the words      of life, you can then go to him saying: \"Father, I have done all I      can with the powers thou hast placed at my command, now help me by      thy grace; and bless all that I have done, and the honor and praise      and the glory shall be thine.\" Under these circumstances, if your      efforts be accompanied by secret prayer before God, who hears in      secret and rewards openly, he will bless your ministry beyond all      your expectation.\" (\"Preparation for the Ministry,\" a discourse      delivered in Salt Lake Tabernacle, Oct. 28, 1894.)

As to the care of writing down the records from      the earliest antiquity among the Egyptians and Babylonians; that      the priests were intrusted therewith, and employed a philosophical      concern about it; that they were the Chaldean priests that did so      among the Babylonians, and that the Phoenicians, who were mingled      among the Greeks, did especially make use of their letters both for      the common affairs of life and for the delivering down the history      of common transactions, I think I may omit any proof, because all      men allow it so to be. But now as to our forefathers, that they      took no less care about writing such records, (for I will not say      they took greater care than the others I spoke of,) and that they      committed that matter to their high priests and to their prophets,      and that these records have been written all along down to our own      times with the utmost accuracy. * * * * * For our forefathers did      not only appoint the best of these priests, and those that attended      upon the divine worship, for that design from the beginning, but      made provision that the stock of the priests should continue      unmixed and pure; for he who is partaker of the Priesthood must      propagate of a wife of the same nation, without having regard to      money, or any other dignities: but he is to make a scrutiny, and      take his wife's genealogy from the ancient tables, and procure      many witnesses to it. And this is our practice not only in Judea,      but wheresoever any body of men of our nation do live; and even      there an exact catalogue of our priests' marriages is kept; I mean      at Egypt and at Babylon, or in any other place of the rest of the      habitable earth, whithersoever our priests are scattered; for they      send to Jerusalem the ancient names of their parents in writing,      as well as those of their remoter ancestors, and signify who are      the witnesses also. * * * But what is the strongest argument of      our exact management in this matter is what I am now going to say.      That we have the names of our high priests from father to son set      down in our records, for the interval of two thousand years; and      if any of these have been transgressors of these rules, they are      prohibited to present themselves at the altar, or to be partakers      of any other of our purifications; and this is justly, or rather      necessarily done, because every one is not permitted of his own      accord to be a writer, nor is there any disagreement in what is      written; they being only prophets that have written the original      and earliest accounts of things, as they learned them of God      himself by inspiration; and others have written what hath happened      in their own time, and that in a very distinct manner also: For we      have not an innumerable multitude of books among us, disagreeing      from and contradicting one another, (as the Greeks have,) but only      twenty-two books, which contain the records of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6052"],[0,"The Minds and Manners of Wild Animals: A Book of Personal Observations (#10)"],[1,"rs, in the  development of a series of moving pictures, and at my request he  has contributed the following graphic description of this  spider's wonderful work.    \"The trap-door spiders, inhabiting the warmer portions of both the  Old and New Worlds, dig a deep tunnel in the soil, line this with  a silken wallpaper, then construct a hinged door at the top so  perfectly fitted and camouflaged with soil, that when it is closed  there is no indication of the burrow. Moreover, the inside portion  of the door of some species is so constructed that it may be  \"latched,\" there being two holes near the edge, precisely placed  where the curved fangs may be inserted and the door held firmly  closed. Also, the trap-door of a number of species is so designed  as to be absolutely rain-proof, being bevelled and as accurately  fitting a corresponding bevel of the tube as the setting of a  compression valve of a gasolene engine.    [Illustration: THE TRAP-DOOR  SPIDER'S DOOR AND BURROW By R. L. Ditmars 1. The door closed. Its  top carefully counterfeits the surrounding ground. 2. The door  with silken hinge, held open by a needle. 3. The spider in its  doorway, looking for prey. 4. Section of the burrow and trap-  door.]    \"The study of a number of specimens of our southern California  species, which builds the cork-type door, including observations  of them at night, when they are particularly active, indicates  that the construction of the tube involves other material than the  silken lining employed by many burrowing spiders. In the  excavation of the tube and retention of the walls, the spider  appears to employ a glairy substance, which thoroughly saturates  the soil and renders the interior of the tube of almost cement-  like hardness. It is then plastered with a thick jet of silk from  the spinning glands. This interior finishing process appears to  be quite rapid, a burrow being readily lined within a couple of  hours.    \"The construction of the trap-door is a far more complicated  process, this convex, beautifully bevelled entrance with its hinge  requiring real scientific skill. Judging from observations on a  number of specimens, the work is done from the outside, the spider  first spinning a net-like covering over the mouth of the tube.  This is thickened by weaving the body over the net, each motion  leaving a smoky trail of silk. Earth is then shoveled into the  covering, the spider carefully pushing the particles toward the  centre, which soon sags, and assumes the proper curvature, and  automatically moulds against the bevelled walls of the tube.    \"The shoveling process must be nicely regulated to produce the  proper bevel and thickness of the door. Then the cementing  process is applied to the top, rendering the door a solid unit.  From the actions of these spiders,--which often calmly rest an  hour without a move,--it appears that the edges of the door are  now subjected, by the stout and sharp fangs, to a cutting process  like that of a can opener, leaving a portion of the marginal silk  to act as a hinge. This hinge afterward receives some finishing  touches, and the top of the door is either pebbled or finished  with a few fragments of dead vegetation, cemented on, in order to  exactly match the surrounding soil.\"          V    THE RIGHTS OF WILD ANIMALS      Every harmless wild bird and mammal has the right to live out its  life according to its destiny; and man is in honor bound to  respect those rights. At the same time it is a mistake to regard  each wild bird or quadruped as a sacred thing, which under no  circumstances may be utilized by man. We are not fanatical Hindus  of the castes which religiously avoid the \"taking of life\" of any  kind, and gently push aside the flea, the centipede and the  scorpion. The reasoning powers of such people are strictly  limited, the same as those of people who are opposed to the  removal by death of the bandits and murderers of the human race.    The highest duty of a reasoning being is to reason. We have no  moral or legal right to act like idiots, or to become a menace to  society by protecting criminal animals or criminal men from  adequate punishment. Like the tree that is known by its fruit,  every alleged \"reasoning being\" is to be judged by the daily  output of his thoughts.    Toward wild life, our highest duty is to be sane and sensible, in  order to be just, and to promote the greatest good for the  greatest number. Be neither a Hindu fanatic nor a cruel game-  butcher like a certain wild-animal slaughterer whom I knew, who  while he was on earth earned for himself a place in the hottest  corner of the hereafter, and quickly passed on to occupy it.    The following planks constitute a good platform on which to base  our relations with the wild animal world, and by which to regulate  our duty to the creatures that have no means of defense against  the persecutions of cruel men. They may be regarded as  representing the standards that have been fixed by enlightened and  humane civilization.    THE WILD ANIMALS' BILL OF RIGHTS    This Bill of Rights is to be copied and displayed conspicuously  in all zoological parks and gardens, zoos and menageries; in all  theatres and shows where animal performances are given, and in all  places where wild animals and birds are trained, sold or kept for  the pleasure of their owners.    Article 1. In view of the nearness of the approach of the higher  animals to the human level, no just and humane man can deny that  those wild animals have certain rights which man is in honor bound  to respect.    Art. 2. The fact that God gave man \"dominion over the beasts of  the field\" does not imply a denial of animal rights, any more than  the supremacy of a human government conveys the right to oppress  and maltreat its citizens.    Art. 3. Under certain conditions it is justifiable for man to kill  a limited number of the so-called game animals, on the same basis  of justification that domestic animals and fowls may be killed for  food.    Art. 4. While the trapping of fur-bearing animals is a necessary  evil, that evil must be minimized by reducing the sufferings of  trapped animals to the lowest possible point, and by preventing  wasteful trapping.    Art. 5. The killing of harmless mammals or birds solely for  \"sport,\" and without utilizing them when killed, is murder; and no  good and humane man will permit himself to engage in any such  offenses against good order and the rights of wild creatures.    Art. 6. Shooting at sea-going creatures from moving vessels,  without any possibility of securing them if killed or wounded, is  cruel, reprehensible, and criminal, and everywhere should be  forbidden by ship captains, and also by law, under penalties.    Art. 7. The extermination of a harmless wild animal species is a  crime; but the regulated destruction of wild pests that have been  proven guilty, is sometimes necessary and justifiable.    Art. 8. No group or species of birds or mammals that is accused of  offenses sufficiently grave to merit destruction shall be  condemned undefended and unheard, nor without adequate evidence of  a character which would be acceptable in a court of law.    Art. 9. The common assumption that every bird or mammal that  offends, or injures the property of any man, is necessarily  deserving of death, is absurd and intolerable. The death penalty  should be the last resort, not the first one!    Art. 10. Any nation that fails adequately to protect its crop-and-  tree-protecting birds deserves to have its fields and forests  devastated by predatory insects.    Art. 11. No person has any moral right to keep a wild mammal,  bird, reptile or fish in a state of uncomfortable, unhappy or  miserable captivity, and all such practices should be prevented by  law, under penalty. It is entirely feasible for a judge to  designate a competent person as a referee to examine and decide  upon each case.    Art. 12. A wild creature that cannot be kept in comfortable  captivity should not be kept at all; and the evils to be guarded  against are cruelly small quarters, too much darkness, too much  light, uncleanliness, bad odors, and bad food. A fish in a glass  globe, or a live bird in a cage the size of a collar-box is a case  of cruelty.    Art. 13. Every captive animal that is suffering hopelessly from  disease or the infirmities of old age has the right to be  painlessly relieved of the burdens of life.    Art. 14. Every keeper or owner of a captive wild animal who  through indolence, forgetfulness or cruelty permits a wild  creature in his charge to perish of cold, heat, hunger or thirst  because of his negligence, is guilty of a grave misdemeanor, and  he should be punished as the evidence and the rights of captive  animals demand.    Art. 15. An animal in captivity has a right to do all the damage  to its surroundings that it can do, and it is not to be punished  therefor.    Art. 16. The idea that all captive wild animals are necessarily  \"miserable\" is erroneous, because some captive animals are better  fed, better protected and are more happy in captivity than similar  animals are in a wild state, beset by dangers and harassed by  hunger and thirst. It is the opinion of the vast majority of  civilized people that there is no higher use to which a wild bird  or mammal can be devoted than to place it in perfectly comfortable  captivity to be seen by millions of persons who desire to make  its acquaintance.    Art. 17. About ninety-five per cent of all the wild mammals seen  in captivity were either born in captivity or captured when in  their infancy, and therefore have no ideas of freedom, or visions  of their wild homes; consequently their supposed \"pining for  freedom\" often is more imaginary than real.    Art. 18. A wild animal has no more inherent right to live a life  of lazy and luxurious ease, and freedom from all care, than a man  or woman has to live without work or family cares. In the"]]]
