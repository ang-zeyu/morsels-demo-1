Returning, he leans against the          hearth, his gaze fixed on Sieglinde, who continues          silently embarrassed._      Wehwalt named I myself:    Hunding here will I wait for.            _Sieglinde starts, listens and hears Hunding          outside leading his horse to the stable. She          hurries to the door and opens it. Hunding, armed          with shield and spear, enters, but, perceiving          Siegmund, pauses on the threshold. Hunding turns          with a look of stern inquiry to Sieglinde._    SIEGLINDE [_In answer to Hunding's look._          On the hearth        Fainting I found    One whom need drove here.    HUNDING          Hast succoured him?    SIEGLINDE          I gave him, as a guest,    Welcome and a drink.    SIEGMUND [_Regarding Hunding firmly and calmly._          Drink she gave,        Shelter too:    Wouldst therefore chide the woman?    HUNDING          Sacred is my hearth:        Sacred hold thou my house.            [_To Sieglinde, as he takes off his armour and          hands it to her._          Set the meal for us men!            [_Sieglinde hangs up the arms on the stem of          the ash-tree, fetches food and drink from          the store-room and sets supper on the table.          Involuntarily she turns her gaze on Siegmund          again._    HUNDING            [_Examining Siegmund's features keenly and with          amaze, compares them with Sieglinde's. Aside._           How like to the woman!         In his eye as well     Gleams the guile of the serpent.            [_He conceals his surprise, and turns with apparent          unconcern to Siegmund._          Far, I trow,        Must thou have fared;        The man who rests here        Rode no horse:        What toilsome journey        Made thee so tired?    SIEGMUND          Through wood and meadow,        Thicket and moor,        Chased by the storm        And peril sore,    I ran by I know not what road.        I know as little        What goal it led to,    And I would gladly be told.    HUNDING [_At table, inviting Siegmund to be seated._          'Tis Hunding owns        The roof and room    Which have harboured thee.        If to the westward        Thou wert to wend,        In homesteads rich        Thou wouldst find kinsmen    Who guard the honour of Hunding.    May I ask of my guest    In return to tell me his name?            [_Siegmund, who has taken his seat at the table,          looks thoughtfully before him. Sieglinde, who          has placed herself beside Hunding and opposite          Siegmund, gazes at him with evident sympathy and          suspense._    [Illustration: Plate 20, Hunding discovers the likeness between Siegmund  and Sieglinde.]    HUNDING [_Watching them both._          If thou wilt not        Trust it to me,    To this woman tell thy secret:    See, how eagerly she asks!    SIEGLINDE [_Unembarrassed and interested._         Gladly I'd know       Who thou art.    SIEGMUND [_Looks up and, gazing into her eyes, begins gravely._      Not for me the name Friedmund;    Frohwalt fain were I called,    But forced was I to be Wehwalt.    Wölfe they called my father;    And I am one of twins:    With a sister twin I was born.        Soon lost were        Both mother and maid;        I hardly knew        Her who gave me my life,    Nor her with whom I was born.    Warlike and strong was Wölfe,    And never wanting for foes.        A-hunting oft        Went the son with the father.        One day we returned        Outworn with the chase    And found the wolf's nest robbed.        The brave abode        To ashes was burnt,        Consumed to dust        The flourishing oak,        And dead was the mother,        Dauntless but slain.        No trace of the sister        Was ever found:    The Neidungs' heartless horde    Had dealt us this bitter blow.        My father fled,        An outlaw with me;        And the youth        Lived wild in the forest    With Wölfe for many years.    Sore beset and harried were they,    But boldly battled the pair of wolves.            [_Turning to Hunding._      A Wölfing tells thee the tale,    And a well-known Wölfing, I trow.    HUNDING      Wondrous and wild the story    Told by thee, valiant guest:    Wehwalt--the Wölfing!    I think that dark rumours anent    This doughty pair have reached me,        Though unknown Wölfe        And Wölfing too.    SIEGLINDE      But tell me further, stranger:    Where dwells thy father now?    SIEGMUND      The Neidungs, starting anew,    Hounded and hunted us down;        But slain by the wolves        Fell many a hunter;        They fled through the wood,        Chased by the game:    Like chaff we scattered the foe.    But trace of my father I lost;        Still his trail grew fainter        The longer I followed;        In the wood a wolf-skin        Was all I found;    There empty it lay:    My father I had lost.--    In the woods I could not stay;    My heart longed for men and for women.--        By all I met,        No matter where,        If friend I sought,        Or woman wooed,    Still I was branded an outlaw;    Ill-luck clung to me;    Whatever I did right,    Others counted it wrong;    What seemed evil to me    Won from others applause.        Grim feuds arose        Wherever I went;        Wrath met me        At every turn;        Longing for gladness,        Woe was my lot:    I called myself Wehwalt therefore,    For woe was all that was mine.            [_He looks at Sieglinde and marks her sympathetic          gaze._    HUNDING      Thou wert shown no grace by the Norns    That cast thy grievous lot;    No one greets thee as guest    With gladness in his home.    SIEGLINDE      Only cowards would fear    A weaponless, lonely man!--        Tell us, O guest,        How in the strife    At last thy weapon was lost!    SIEGMUND          A sorrowful child        Cried for my help;        Her kinsmen wanted        To wed the maiden    To one whom her heart did not choose.        To her defence        Gladly I hied;        The heartless horde        Met me in fight:    Before me foemen fell.    Fordone and dead lay the brothers.    The slain were embraced by the maid,    Her wrongs forgotten in grief.    She wept wild streams of woe,    And bathed the dead with her tears;    For the loss of her brothers slain    Lamented the ill-fated bride.        Then the dead men's kinsmen        Came like a storm,        Vowing vengeance,        Frantic to fall on me;        Foemen on all sides        Rose and assailed me.        But from the spot        Moved not the maid;        My shield and spear        Sheltered her long,        Till spear and shield        Were hewn from my hand.    Standing weaponless, wounded,    I beheld the maid die:    I fled from the furious host--    She lay lifeless on the dead.            [_To Sieglinde with a look of fervent sorrow._      The reason now I have told    Why none may know me as Friedmund.            [_He rises and walks to the hearth. Pale and deeply          moved, Sieglinde looks on the ground._    HUNDING [_Rises._      I know a wild-blooded breed;        What others revere        It flouts unawed:    All hate it, and I with the rest.        When forth in haste I was summoned,        Vengeance to seek        For my kinsmen's blood,        I came too late,        And now return home    To find the impious wretch    In haven under my roof.--        My house holds thee,        Wölfing, to-day;    For the night thou art my guest.        But wield to-morrow        Thy trustiest weapon.    I choose the day for the fight:    Thy life shall pay for the dead.            [_To Sieglinde, who steps between the two men with          anxious gestures; harshly._          Forth from the hall!        Linger not here!    Prepare my draught for the night,    And wait until I come.    [_Sieglinde stands for a while undecided and thoughtful. Slowly  and with hesitating steps she goes towards the store-room,  There she pauses again, lost in thought, her face half averted.  With quiet resolution she opens the cupboard, fills a  drinking-horn, and shakes spices into it out of a box. She then turns  her eyes on Siegmund, in order to meet his gaze, which he  never removes from her. She perceives that Hunding is  watching, and proceeds immediately to the bed-chamber. On  the steps she turns once more, looks yearningly at Siegmund,  and indicates with her eyes, persistently and with speaking  plainness, a particular spot in the stem of the ash-tree.  Hunding starts, and drives her off with a violent gesture.  With a last look at Siegmund, she disappears into the  bed-chamber, and shuts the door behind her._    HUNDING [_Taking his weapons from the tree-stem._      With weapons man should be armed.    We meet tomorrow then Wölfing.    My word thou hast heard;    Ward thyself well!            [_He goes into bed-chamber. The shooting of the          bolt is heard from within._            [_Siegmund alone. It has grown quite dark. All the          light in the hall comes from a dull fire on the          hearth. Siegmund sinks down on to a couch beside          the fire and broods forsome time silently in great          agitation._    SIEGMUND      My father said when most wanted    A sword I should find and wield.        Swordless I entered        My foeman's house,        As a hostage here        I remain.        I saw a fair        Woman and sweet,        And bliss and dread        Consume my heart.    The woman for whom I long--    She whose charm both wounds and        delights--    In thrall is held by the man    Who mocks a weaponless foe.        Wälse! Wälse!        Where is thy sword?--        The trusty sword        To be swung in battle,    When from my bosom should burst    The fury that fills my heart?            [_The fire collapses. From the flame which leaps up          a bright light"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/485"],[0,"The Road to Oz (#10)"],[1,"and shrill.    \"What do you want?\" called the shaggy man.    \"You!\" they yelled, pointing their thin fingers at the group; and they  all flopped around, so they were white, and then all flopped back  again, so they were black.    \"But what do you want us for?\" asked the shaggy man, uneasily.    \"Soup!\" they all shouted, as if with one voice.    \"Goodness me!\" said Dorothy, trembling a little; \"the Scoodlers must be  reg'lar cannibals.\"    \"Don't want to be soup,\" protested Button-Bright, beginning to cry.    \"Hush, dear,\" said the little girl, trying to comfort him; \"we don't  any of us want to be soup.  But don't worry; the shaggy man will take  care of us.\"    \"Will he?\" asked Polychrome, who did not like the Scoodlers at all, and  kept close to Dorothy.    \"I'll try,\" promised the shaggy man; but he looked worried.    Happening just then to feel the Love Magnet in his pocket, he said to  the creatures, with more confidence:    \"Don't you love me?\"    \"Yes!\" they shouted, all together.    \"Then you mustn't harm me, or my friends,\" said the shaggy man, firmly.    \"We love you in soup!\" they yelled, and in a flash turned their white  sides to the front.    \"How dreadful!\" said Dorothy.  \"This is a time, Shaggy Man, when you  get loved too much.\"    \"Don't want to be soup!\" wailed Button-Bright again; and Toto began to  whine dismally, as if he didn't want to be soup, either.    \"The only thing to do,\" said the shaggy man to his friends, in a low  tone, \"is to get out of this pocket in the rocks as soon as we can, and  leave the Scoodlers behind us.  Follow me, my dears, and don't pay any  attention to what they do or say.\"    With this, he began to march along the road to the opening in the rocks  ahead, and the others kept close behind him.  But the Scoodlers closed  up in front, as if to bar their way, and so the shaggy man stooped down  and picked up a loose stone, which he threw at the creatures to scare  them from the path.    At this the Scoodlers raised a howl.  Two of them picked their heads  from their shoulders and hurled them at the shaggy man with such force  that he fell over in a heap, greatly astonished.  The two now ran  forward with swift leaps, caught up their heads, and put them on again,  after which they sprang back to their positions on the rocks.          10.  Escaping the Soup-Kettle      The shaggy man got up and felt of himself to see if he was hurt; but he  was not.  One of the heads had struck his breast and the other his left  shoulder; yet though they had knocked him down, the heads were not hard  enough to bruise him.    \"Come on,\" he said firmly; \"we've got to get out of here some way,\" and  forward he started again.    The Scoodlers began yelling and throwing their heads in great numbers  at our frightened friends.  The shaggy man was knocked over again, and  so was Button-Bright, who kicked his heels against the ground and  howled as loud as he could, although he was not hurt a bit.  One head  struck Toto, who first yelped and then grabbed the head by an ear and  started running away with it.    The Scoodlers who had thrown their heads began to scramble down and run  to pick them up, with wonderful quickness; but the one whose head Toto  had stolen found it hard to get it back again.  The head couldn't see  the body with either pair of its eyes, because the dog was in the way,  so the headless Scoodler stumbled around over the rocks and tripped on  them more than once in its effort to regain its top.  Toto was trying  to get outside the rocks and roll the head down the hill; but some of  the other Scoodlers came to the rescue of their unfortunate comrade and  pelted the dog with their own heads until he was obliged to drop his  burden and hurry back to Dorothy.    The little girl and the Rainbow's Daughter had both escaped the shower  of heads, but they saw now that it would be useless to try to run away  from the dreadful Scoodlers.    \"We may as well submit,\" declared the shaggy man, in a rueful voice, as  he got upon his feet again.  He turned toward their foes and asked:    \"What do you want us to do?\"    \"Come!\" they cried, in a triumphant chorus, and at once sprang from the  rocks and surrounded their captives on all sides.  One funny thing  about the Scoodlers was they could walk in either direction, coming or  going, without turning around; because they had two faces and, as  Dorothy said, \"two front sides,\" and their feet were shaped like the  letter T upside down.  They moved with great rapidity and there was  something about their glittering eyes and contrasting colors and  removable heads that inspired the poor prisoners with horror, and made  them long to escape.    But the creatures led their captives away from the rocks and the road,  down the hill by a side path until they came before a low mountain of  rock that looked like a huge bowl turned upside down.  At the edge of  this mountain was a deep gulf--so deep that when you looked into it  there was nothing but blackness below.  Across the gulf was a narrow  bridge of rock, and at the other end of the bridge was an arched  opening that led into the mountain.    Over this bridge the Scoodlers led their prisoners, through the opening  into the mountain, which they found to be an immense hollow dome  lighted by several holes in the roof.  All around the circular space  were built rock houses, set close together, each with a door in the  front wall.  None of these houses was more than six feet wide, but the  Scoodlers were thin people sidewise and did not need much room.  So  vast was the dome that there was a large space in the middle of the  cave, in front of all these houses, where the creatures might  congregate as in a great hall.    It made Dorothy shudder to see a huge iron kettle suspended by a stout  chain in the middle of the place, and underneath the kettle a great  heap of kindling wood and shavings, ready to light.    \"What's that?\" asked the shaggy man, drawing back as they approached  this place, so that they were forced to push him forward.    \"The Soup Kettle!\" yelled the Scoodlers, and then they shouted in the  next breath:    \"We're hungry!\"    Button-Bright, holding Dorothy's hand in one chubby fist and Polly's  hand in the other, was so affected by this shout that he began to cry  again, repeating the protest:    \"Don't want to be soup, I don't!\"    \"Never mind,\" said the shaggy man, consolingly; \"I ought to make enough  soup to feed them all, I'm so big; so I'll ask them to put me in the  kettle first.\"    \"All right,\" said Button-Bright, more cheerfully.    But the Scoodlers were not ready to make soup yet.  They led the  captives into a house at the farthest side of the cave--a house  somewhat wider than the others.    \"Who lives here?\" asked the Rainbow's Daughter.  The Scoodlers nearest  her replied:    \"The Queen.\"    It made Dorothy hopeful to learn that a woman ruled over these fierce  creatures, but a moment later they were ushered by two or three of the  escort into a gloomy, bare room--and her hope died away.    For the Queen of the Scoodlers proved to be much more dreadful in  appearance than any of her people.  One side of her was fiery red, with  jet-black hair and green eyes and the other side of her was bright  yellow, with crimson hair and black eyes.  She wore a short skirt of  red and yellow and her hair, instead of being banged, was a tangle of  short curls upon which rested a circular crown of silver--much dented  and twisted because the Queen had thrown her head at so many things so  many times.  Her form was lean and bony and both her faces were deeply  wrinkled.    \"What have we here?\" asked the Queen sharply, as our friends were made  to stand before her.    \"Soup!\" cried the guard of Scoodlers, speaking together.    \"We're not!\" said Dorothy, indignantly; \"we're nothing of the sort.\"    \"Ah, but you will be soon,\" retorted the Queen, a grim smile making her  look more dreadful than before.    \"Pardon me, most beautiful vision,\" said the shaggy man, bowing before  the queen politely.  \"I must request your Serene Highness to let us go  our way without being made into soup.  For I own the Love Magnet, and  whoever meets me must love me and all my friends.\"    \"True,\" replied the Queen.  \"We love you very much; so much that we  intend to eat your broth with real pleasure.  But tell me, do you think  I am so beautiful?\"    \"You won't be at all beautiful if you eat me,\" he said, shaking his  head sadly.  \"Handsome is as handsome does, you know.\"    The Queen turned to Button-Bright.    \"Do YOU think I'm beautiful?\"  she asked.    \"No,\" said the boy; \"you're ugly.\"    \"I think you're a fright,\" said Dorothy.    \"If you could see yourself you'd be terribly scared,\" added Polly.    The Queen scowled at them and flopped from her red side to her yellow  side.    \"Take them away,\" she commanded the guard, \"and at six o'clock run them  through the meat chopper and start the soup kettle boiling.  And put  plenty of salt in the broth this time, or I'll punish the cooks  severely.\"    \"Any onions, your Majesty?\" asked one of the guard.    \"Plenty of onions and garlic and a dash of red pepper.  Now, go!\"    The Scoodlers led the captives away and shut them up in one of the  houses, leaving only a single Scoodler to keep guard.    The place was a sort of store-house; containing bags of potatoes and  baskets of carrots, onions and turnips.    \"These,\" said their guard, pointing to the vegetables, \"we use to  flavor our soups with.\"    The prisoners were rather disheartened by this time, for they saw no  way to escape and did not know how soon it would be six o'clock and  time for the meatchopper to begin work.  But the shaggy man was brave  and did not intend to submit to such a horrid fate without a struggle.    \"I'm going to fight for our lives,\" he whispered to the children, \"for  if I fail we will be no worse off than before, and to sit here quietly  until we are made into soup"]]]
