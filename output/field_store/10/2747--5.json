He was happy to meet all the elves and fairies, and they,  in turn, joyfully did whatever he told them. Fro knew all the secrets of  the grain fields, for he could see what was in every kernel of both the  stalks and the ripe ears. He arrived, in a golden chariot, drawn by his  wild boar which served him instead of a horse. Both chariot and boar  drove over the tops of the ears of wheat, and faster than the wind.    The Boar was named Gullin, or Golden Bristles because of its sunshiny  color and splendor. In this chariot, Fro had specimens of all the  grains, fruits, and vegetables known to man, from which Styf could  choose, for these he was accustomed to scatter over the earth.    When Styf told him just what he wanted to do, Fro picked out a sheaf of  wheat and whispered a secret in his ear. Then he drove away, in a burst  of golden glory, which dazzled even the elves, that loved the bright  sunshine. These elves were always glad to see the golden chariot coming  or passing by.    Styf also summoned to his aid the kabouters, and, from these ugly little  fellows, got some useful hints; for they, dwelling in the dark caverns,  know many secrets which men used to name alchemy, and which they now  call chemistry.    Then Styf fenced himself off from all intruders, on the top of a bright,  sunny hilltop, with his thinking cap on and made experiments for seven  days. No elves, except his servants, were allowed to see him. At the end  of a week, still keeping his secret and having instructed a dozen or so  of the elf girls in his new art, he invited all the elves in the Low  Countries to come to a great exhibition, which he intended to give.    What a funny show it was! On one long bench, were half a dozen washtubs;  and on a table, near by, were a dozen more washtubs; and on a longer  table not far away were six ironing boards, with smoothing irons. A  stove, made hot with a peat fire, was to heat the irons. Behind the tubs  and tables, stood the twelve elf maidens, all arrayed in shining white  garments and caps, as spotless as snow. One might almost think they were  white elves of the meadow and not kabouters of the mines. The wonder was  that their linen clothes were not only as dainty as stars, but that they  glistened, as if they had laid on the ground during a hoar frost.    Yet it was still warm summer. Nothing had frozen, or melted, and the  rosy-faced elf-maidens were as dry as an ivory fan. Yet they resembled  the lilies of the garden when pearly with dew-drops.    When all were gathered together, Old Styf called for some of the  company, who had come from afar, to take off their dusty and  travel-stained linen garments and give them to him. These were passed  over to the trained girls waiting to receive them. In a jiffy, they were  washed, wrung out, rinsed and dried. It was noticed that those  elf-maidens, who were standing at the last tub, were intently expecting  to do something great, while those five elf maids at the table took off  the hot irons from the stove. They touched the bottom of the flat-irons  with a drop of water to see if it rolled off hissing. They kept their  eyes fixed on Styf, who now came forward before all and said, in a loud  voice:    \"Elves and fairies, moss maidens and stall sprites, one and all, behold  our invention, which our great friend Fro and our no less helpful  friends, the kabouters, have helped me to produce. Now watch me prove  its virtues.\"    Forthwith he produced before all a glistening substance, partly in  powder, and partly in square lumps, as white as chalk. He easily broke  up a handful under his fingers, and flung it into the fifth tub, which  had hot water in it. After dipping the washed garments in the white  gummy mass, he took them up, wrung them out, dried them with his breath,  and then handed them to the elf ironers. In a few moments, these held  up, before the company, what a few minutes before had been only dusty  and stained clothes. Now, they were white and resplendent. No fuller's  earth could have bleached them thus, nor added so glistening a surface.    It was starch, a new thing for clothes. The fairies, one and all,  clapped their hands in delight.    \"What shall we name it?\" modestly asked Styf of the oldest gnome  present.    \"Hereafter, we shall call you Styf Sterk, Stiff Starch.\" They all  laughed.    Very quickly did the Dutch folks, men and women, hear and make use of  the elves' invention. Their linen closets now looked like piles of snow.  All over the Low Countries, women made caps, in new fashions, of lace or  plain linen, with horns and wings, flaps and crimps, with quilling and  with whirligigs. Soon, in every town, one could read the sign \"Hier  mangled men\" (Here we do ironing).    In time, kings, queens and nobles made huge ruffs, often so big that  their necks were invisible, and their heads nearly lost from sight, in  rings of quilled linen, or of lace, that stuck out a foot or so. Worldly  people dyed their starch yellow; zealous folk made it blue; but moderate  people kept it snowy white.    Starch added money and riches to the nation. Kings' treasuries became  fat with money gained by taxes laid on ruffs, and on the cargoes of  starch, which was now imported by the shipload, or made on the spot, in  many countries. So, out of the ancient grain came a new spirit that  worked for sweetness and beauty, cleanliness, and health. From a useful  substance, as old as Egypt, was born a fine art, that added to the sum  of the world's wealth and pleasure.          THE KABOUTERS AND THE BELLS      When the young queen Wilhelmina visited Brabant and Limburg, they amused  her with pageants and plays, in which the little fellows called  kabouters, in Dutch, and kobolds in German, played and showed off their  tricks. Other small folk, named gnomes, took part in the tableaux. The  kabouters are the dark elves, who live in forests and mines. The white  elves live in the open fields and the sunshine.    The gnomes do the thinking, but the kabouters carry out the work of  mining and gathering the precious stones and minerals. They are short,  thick fellows, very strong and are strenuous in digging out coal and  iron, copper and gold. When they were first made, they were so ugly,  that they had to live where they could not be seen, that is, in the dark  places. The grown imps look like old men with beards, but no one ever  heard of a kabouter that was taller than a yardstick. As for the babies,  they are hardly bigger than a man's thumb. The big boys and girls, in  the kabouter kingdom, are not much over a foot high.    [Illustration: THE MASTER OF THE CHOIR TRIED AGAIN AND AGAIN]    What is peculiar about them all is, that they help the good and wise  people to do things better; but they love to plague and punish the dull  folks, that are stupid, or foolish or naughty. In impish glee, they lure  the blockheads, or in Dutch, the \"cheese-heads,\" to do worse.    A long time ago, there were no church spires or bells in the land of the  Dutch folks, as there are now by the thousands. The good teachers from  the South came into the country and taught the people to have better  manners, finer clothes and more wholesome food. They also persuaded them  to forget their cruel gods and habits of revenge. They told of the  Father in Heaven, who loves us all, as his children, and forgives us  when we repent of our evil doings.    Now when the chief gnomes and kabouters heard of the newcomers in the  land, they held a meeting and said one to the other:    \"We shall help all the teachers that are good and kind, but we shall  plague and punish the rough fellows among them.\"    So word was sent to all little people in the mines and hills,  instructing them how they were to act and what they were to do.    Some of the new teachers, who were foreigners, and did not know the  customs of the country, were very rude and rough. Every day they hurt  the feelings of the people. With their axes they cut down the sacred  trees. They laughed scornfully at the holy wells and springs of water.  They reviled the people, when they prayed to great Woden, with his black  ravens that told him everything, or to the gentle Freya, with her white  doves, who helped good girls to get kind husbands. They scolded the  children at play, and this made their fathers and mothers feel  miserable. This is the reason why so many people were angry and sullen,  and would not listen to the foreign teachers.    Worse than this, many troubles came to these outsiders. Their bread was  sour, when they took it out of the oven. So was the milk, in their pans.  Sometimes they found their beds turned upside down. Gravel stones  rattled down into their fireplaces. Their hats and shoes were missing.  In fact, they had a terrible time generally and wanted to go back home.  When the kabouter has a grudge against any one, he knows how to plague  him.    But the teachers that were wise and gentle had no trouble. They  persuaded the people with kind words, and, just as a baby learns to eat  other food at the table, so the people were weaned away from cruel  customs and foolish beliefs. Many of the land's folk came to listen to  the teachers and helped them gladly to build churches.    More wonderful than this, were the good things that came to these kind  teachers, they knew not how. Their bread and milk were always sweet and  in plenty. They found their beds made up and their clothes kept clean,  gardens planted with blooming flowers, and much hard work done for them.  When they would build a church in a village, they wondered how it was  that the wood and the nails, the iron necessary to brace the beams, and  the copper and brass for the sacred vessels, came so easily and in  plenty. When, on some nights, they wondered where they would get food to  eat, they found, on waking up in the morning, that there was always  something good ready"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7882"],[0,"The Life of Kit Carson: Hunter, Trapper, Guide, Indian Agent and Colonel U.S.A. (#10)"],[1,"to the Big Snake River where they  went into quarters for the winter. Even there they were not safe from  molestation at the hands of their old enemies the Blackfeet.    One night, when there was no moon or stars, a band of warriors stole  into camp and ran off about twenty of the best horses. This outrage  touched the hunters in the most sensitive part of their nature, and  the truth no sooner became known than they unanimously agreed that the  animals not only should be recovered but the audacious aggressors should  be chastised.    Twelve men were selected for the most difficult and dangerous task and  need we give the name of the youth who was made the leader?    With his usual promptness, Carson took the trail which was followed  without trouble over the snow. The Blackfeet had reason to fear some  such demonstration, and they hurried off with such speed that they were  not overtaken until fifty miles from camp.    The situation was a novel one. The Indians had come to a halt and the  horses were grazing on the side of a hill where the wind had blown away  the snow. The Blackfeet had on snowshoes which gave them an advantage  over the trappers. The latter galloped in the direction of their  horses, the moment they caught sight of them. The Blackfeet fired at the  trappers, who returned a scattering volley but no one was hurt on either  side. Then followed skirmishing and manoeuvering for several minutes,  without either party gaining advantage. Finally the Blackfeet asked for  a parley to which the trappers assented.    In accordance with the usual custom, one of the Indians advanced to a  point midway between the two parties and halted. At the same time, one  of the trappers went forward, the rest of the whites and red men keeping  their distance and watching them.    The Blackfoot opened business by what might be termed an apology which  was no more genuine than many made by his civilized brethren under  somewhat similar circumstances. He expressed great surprise to learn  that the horses belonged to their good friends the trappers. They had  supposed all along that they were the property of the Snake Indians  whom the Blackfeet considered it their duty to despoil on every suitable  occasion.    This glaring misrepresentation did not deceive the man who was acting as  spokesman for his side. By way of reply, he asked that if such was  the case, why had not the Blackfeet come forward on discovering their  mistake, greeted their white brothers as friends and returned their  property to them.    The replies were evasive and the hunters became convinced that the  Indians were seeking to gain time for some sinister purpose; but a full  parley having been agreed upon, both parties left their guns behind and  advanced to where their representatives were holding their interview.    The Blackfeet still professed the most ardent friendship, and as an  emphatic token of the same, produced the calumet and began smoking the  pipe of peace. The tobacco having been lit, each took several whiffs  and then passed it to his neighbor, who did the same until the round was  completed. This solemn pledge of good will having been exchanged, the  convention or peace congress was opened as may be said, in due and  ancient form.    Carson and his companions were distrustful from the start, though it was  hard for them to decide the meaning of the prolonged negotiations, since  no one could see what the Blackfeet were to gain by such a course. They  may have hoped to deceive the hunters and throw them off their guard,  but, if such was the case, they failed.    First of all, the leading warriors indulged in several long speeches  which were without point, but what was said in reply could admit of no  doubt as to its meaning. The trappers understood the Blackfoot tongue  well enough to make their responses models in the way of brevity and  force. They said that it was idle to talk of friendship or peace until  the stolen property was returned to its owners. The Indians still  attempted to postpone or evade, but the complainants were in no mood  for trifling and they repeated their declaration more positively than  before.    The Blackfeet were much more numerous than the whites, and confident of  their strength, began to bluster and to assert that whatever they did  would be dictated by their own wishes and not by any fear of their  visitors. Whether they desired to avoid a fight or not can only be  conjectured, but they finally sent back to where the horses were  tethered and caused five of the worst to be picked out and brought  forward.    When the trappers inquired the meaning of this proceeding, the Indians  said that it was the best they could do and the hunters must be content.    This last insult was the spark which exploded the magazine. Instantly  every white man ran for his gun, and the Blackfeet did the same. A few  seconds after they wheeled about and the sanguinary fight began.    Kit Carson and a companion were the first to obtain their guns and as  a consequence they led the advance. Each selected a warrior who was  partially hidden by the trunk of a tree. Carson was in the act of  firing, when he observed that his friend was examining the lock of his  gun all unmindful of the fact that one of the Blackfeet had levelled his  weapon directly at his breast. On the instant, Kit changed his aim and  shot the savage dead, thereby saving the life of his friend, who could  not have escaped had the weapon of his adversary been discharged.        CHAPTER XII.       Carson Badly Wounded--A Drawn Battle--An Ineffectual Pursuit--The Summer   Rendezvous--Carson's Duel.    This act of chivalry on the part of Carson simply transferred the peril  of his friend to himself, for the Indian whom he had selected for his  target was carefully sighting at him, at the very moment the gun was  discharged. Kit saw what was coming and bounded to one side in the hope  of dodging the bullet. Quick as he was, however, he did not entirely  succeed, though the act doubtless saved his life. The ball from  the rifle of his adversary grazed his neck and buried itself in his  shoulder, shattering the head of one of the bones.    Carson though badly hurt, did not fall or retreat. On the contrary, he  tried desperately to reload his gun, but found it impossible to raise  his arm. He was hors de combat beyond all question, and bleeding so  fast that his weakness compelled him to lie down on the ground while  the conflict went on about him. The fight was very hot for a time,  the result being what may be called a drawn battle, with the advantage  inclining to the side of the Indians. The trappers fell back to the  safest place that presented itself and went into camp. They dared not  start a fire; for they knew it would bring an attack from the Indians,  but wrapping their saddle blankets around them, they bore the intense  cold as best they could.    The sufferings of Carson were great. His wounds continued bleeding and  froze upon the dressings, which were of the most primitive character.  And yet not once through those hours of anguish did he utter a word of  complaint. Many a strong man would have cried out in his agony, but one  might have sat within arm's length of the mountaineer without knowing he  was hurt at all.    More than that, Carson took his part in the council which was held in  the cold and darkness. The conclusion reached was that the party of  trappers were not strong enough to pursue the Blackfeet, and the proper  course to pursue was to rejoin the main body and report what had been  done. It would then be time enough to decide upon their future action.    When this programme was carried out, a larger party of hunters under  the lead of an experienced mountaineer resumed the pursuit; but nothing  could be found of the savages. They had utilized the grace allowed  them so well that it was impossible to overtake or trace them, and the  indignant trappers were obliged to submit to their loss.    The severe cold moderated, and, as spring was close at hand the hunters  pushed their trapping operations along the Green and Snake Rivers,  meeting with unbounded success. They gathered more peltries than they  had dared to hope for, and when warm weather approached, went into  quarters where they remained until the following fall, a party of  traders having brought them all the supplies they needed.    The rugged constitution of Carson and his temperate habits caused him  speedily to recover from his severe wound. He again became the active,  vigilant, keen witted guide and hunter who was looked up to by all as  the most consummate master of woodcraft that had ever been known in the  west.    Such a large party as were gathered at the summer rendezvous was certain  to include many varieties of people. The frank, brave and open hearted,  the sly and treacherous, the considerate and courteous, the quarrelsome  and overbearing--indeed the temperaments of the individuals composing  the company were as varied as it is possible to imagine.    Among them was a powerful Frenchman known as Captain Shunan. He had won  his title by hard fighting, possessed a magnificent physique, was brave  and skilled in the use of arms, and was the most quarrelsome individual  in camp. It is impossible to picture a more irascible and disagreeable  personage than Captain Shunan, who appeared to spend all his spare  time in trying to provoke quarrels with those around him. Sometimes he  succeeded, but more often his insolence was submitted to by men as brave  as he, but who wished to avoid trouble with him.    The activity and strength of the Frenchman were so great that a skilful  pugilist would have found difficulty in handling him. The only ground  upon which he could be met with anything like fairness was where  firearms were used.    On one of these occasions, the bully became unbearable in his behavior.  He knocked down several weak and inoffensive persons,"]]]
