The emigrating family consisted of the Lincolns, John Johnston, Mrs.  Lincoln's son, and her daughters, Mrs. Hall and Mrs. Hanks, with their  husbands.    Two weeks of weary tramping over forest roads and muddy prairie, and  the dangerous fording of streams swollen by the February thaws,  brought the party to John Hanks's place near Decatur. He met them with  a frank and energetic welcome. He had already selected a piece of  ground for them a few miles from his own, and had the logs ready for  their house. They numbered men enough to build without calling in  their neighbors, and immediately put up a cabin on the north fork of  the Sangamon River. The family thus housed and sheltered, one more bit  of filial work remained for Abraham before assuming his virile  independence. With the assistance of John Hanks he plowed fifteen  acres, and split, from the tall walnut-trees of the primeval forest,  enough rails to surround them with a fence. Little did either dream,  while engaged in this work, that the day would come when the  appearance of John Hanks in a public meeting, with two of these rails  on his shoulder, would electrify a State convention, and kindle  throughout the country a contagious and passionate enthusiasm, whose  results would reach to endless generations.          CHAPTER III    ILLINOIS IN 1830      [Sidenote: Roy. J. M. Sturtevant, \"Address to Old Settlers of Morgan  County.\"]    [Sidenote: Thomas Buckles, of McLean County.]    [Sidenote: J.C. Power, \"Early Settlers of Sangamon County,\" p. 62.]    [Sidenote: \"Old Times in McLean County,\" p. 414.]    [Illustration:   GOOSE-NEST PRAIRIE, NEAR FARMINGTON ILLINOIS, WHERE  THOMAS LINCOLN LIVED AND DIED.]    The Lincolns arrived in Illinois just in time to entitle themselves to  be called pioneers. When, in after years, associations of \"Old  Settlers\" began to be formed in Central Illinois, the qualification  for membership agreed upon by common consent was a residence in the  country before \"the winter of the deep snow.\" This was in 1830-31, a  season of such extraordinary severity that it has formed for half a  century a recognized date in the middle counties of Illinois, among  those to whom in those days diaries and journals were unknown. The  snowfall began in the Christmas holidays and continued until the snow  was three feet deep on level ground. Then came a cold rain, freezing  as it fell, until a thick crust of ice gathered over the snow. The  weather became intensely cold, the mercury sinking to twelve degrees  below zero, Fahrenheit, and remaining there for two weeks. The storm  came on with such suddenness that all who were abroad had great  trouble in reaching their homes, and many perished. One man relates  that he and a friend or two were out in a hunting party with an ox-  team. They had collected a wagon-load of game and were on their way  home when the storm struck them. After they had gone four miles they  were compelled to abandon their wagon; the snow fell in heavy masses  \"as if thrown from a scoop-shovel\"; arriving within two miles of their  habitation, they were forced to trust to the instinct of their  animals, and reached home hanging to the tails of their steers. Not  all were so fortunate. Some were found weeks afterwards in the snow-  drifts, their flesh gnawed by famished wolves; and the fate of others  was unknown until the late spring sunshine revealed their resting-  places. To those who escaped, the winter was tedious and terrible. It  is hard for us to understand the isolation to which such weather  condemned the pioneer. For weeks they remained in their cabins hoping  for some mitigation of the frost. When at last they were driven out by  the fear of famine, the labor of establishing communications was  enormous. They finally made roads by \"wallowing through the snow,\" as  an Illinois historian expresses it, and going patiently over the same  track until the snow was trampled hard and rounded like a turnpike.  These roads lasted far into the spring, when the snow had melted from  the plains, and wound for miles like threads of silver over the rich  black loam of the prairies. After that winter game was never again so  plentiful in the State. Much still remained, of course, but it never  recovered entirely from the rigors of that season and the stupid  enterprise of the pioneer hunters, who, when they came out of their  snow-beleaguered cabins, began chasing and killing the starved deer by  herds. It was easy work; the crust of the snow was strong enough to  bear the weight of men and dogs, but the slender hoofs of the deer  would after a few bounds pierce the treacherous surface. This  destructive slaughter went on until the game grew too lean to be worth  the killing. All sorts of wild animals grew scarce from that winter.  Old settlers say that the slow cowardly breed of prairie wolves, which  used to be caught and killed as readily as sheep, disappeared about  that time and none but the fleeter and stronger survived.    Only once since then has nature shown such extravagant severity in  Illinois, and that was on a day in the winter of 1836, known to  Illinoisans as \"the sudden change.\" At noon on the 20th of December,  after a warm and rainy morning, the ground being covered with mud and  slush, the temperature fell instantly forty degrees. A man riding into  Springfield for a marriage license says a roaring and crackling wind  came upon him and the rain-drops dripping from his bridle-reins and  beard changed in a second into jingling icicles. He rode hastily into  the town and arrived in a few minutes at his destination; but his  clothes were frozen like sheet iron, and man and saddle had to be  taken into the house together to be thawed apart. Geese and chickens  were caught by the feet and wings and frozen to the wet ground. A  drove of a thousand hogs, which were being driven to St. Louis, rushed  together for warmth, and became piled in a great heap. Those inside  smothered and those outside froze, and the ghastly pyramid remained  there on the prairie for weeks: the drovers barely escaped with their  lives. Men killed their horses, disemboweled them, and crept into the  cavity of their bodies to escape the murderous wind. [Footnote:  Although the old settlers of Sangamon County are acquainted with these  facts, and we have often heard them and many others like them from the  lips of eye-witnesses, we have preferred to cite only these incidents  of the sudden change which are given in the careful and conscientious  compilation entitled \"The Early Settlers of Sangamon County,\" by John  Carroll Power.]    The pioneer period of Illinois was ending as Thomas Lincoln and his  tall boy drove their ox-team over the Indiana line. The population of  the State had grown to 157,447. It still clung to the wooded borders  of the water-courses; scattered settlements were to be found all along  the Mississippi and its affluents, from where Cairo struggled for life  in the swamps of the Ohio to the bustling and busy mining camps which  the recent discovery of lead had brought to Galena. A line of villages  from Alton to Peoria dotted the woodland which the Illinois River had  stretched, like a green baldric, diagonally across the bosom of the  State. Then there were long reaches of wilderness before you came to  Fort Dearborn, where there was nothing as yet to give promise of that  miraculous growth which was soon to make Chicago a proverb to the  world. There were a few settlements in the fertile region called the  Military Tract; the southern part of the State was getting itself  settled here and there. People were coming in freely to the Sangamon  country. But a grassy solitude stretched from Galena to Chicago, and  the upper half of the State was generally a wilderness. The earlier  emigrants, principally of the poorer class of Southern farmers,  shunned the prairies with something of a superstitious dread. They  preferred to pass the first years of their occupation in the wasteful  and laborious work of clearing a patch of timber for corn, rather than  enter upon those rich savannas which were ready to break into  fertility at the slightest provocation of culture. Even so late as  1835, writes J. F. Speed, \"no one dreamed the prairies would ever be  occupied.\" It was thought they would be used perpetually as grazing-  fields for stock. For years the long processions of \"movers\" wound,  over those fertile and neglected plains, taking no hint of the wealth  suggested by the rank luxuriance of vegetable growth around them, the  carpet of brilliant flowers spread over the verdant knolls, the  strong, succulent grass that waved in the breeze, full of warm and  vital odor, as high as the waist of a man. In after years, when the  emigration from the Northern and Eastern States began to pour in, the  prairies were rapidly taken up, and the relative growth and importance  of the two sections of the State were immediately reversed. Governor  Ford, writing about 1847, attributes this result to the fact that the  best class of Southern people were slow to emigrate to a State where  they could not take their slaves; while the settlers from the North,  not being debarred by the State Constitution from bringing their  property with them, were of a different class. \"The northern part of  the State was settled in the first instance by wealthy farmers,  enterprising merchants, millers, and manufacturers. They made farms,  built mills, churches, school-houses, towns, and cities, and  constructed roads and bridges as if by magic; so that although the  settlements in the southern part of the State are from twenty to fifty  years in advance on the score of age, yet are they ten years behind in  point of wealth and all the appliances of a higher civilization.\"    [Sidenote: Thomas Ford, \"History of Illinois,\" p. 280.]    At the time which we are specially"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6818"],[0,"The Arctic Prairies : a Canoe-Journey of 2,000 Miles in Search of the Caribou; (#10)"],[1,"keep the place covered with  them dipped in water as hot as you can stand it, and we'll head  it up in twenty-four hours; then in three days I'll have you in  good shape to travel.\" The last sentence, delivered with the calm  certainty of a man who knows all about it and never made a mistake,  did so much good to the patient that I caught a reflex of it myself.    He gave me his good hand and said with emotion: \"You don't know  how much good you have done me. I don't mind being killed, but I  don't want to go through life a cripple.\"    \"You say you haven't slept?\" I asked.    \"Not for three nights; I've suffered too much.\"    \"Then take these pills. Go to bed at ten o'clock and take a pill;  if this does not put you to sleep, take another at 10.30. If you are  still awake at 11, take the third; then you will certainly sleep.\"    He went off almost cheerfully.    Next morning he was back, looking brighter. \"Well,\" I said, \"you  slept last night, all right.\"    \"No,\" he replied, \"I didn't; there's opium in those pills, isn't  there?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I thought so. Here they are. I made up my mind I'd see this out  in my sober senses, without any drugs.\"    \"Good for you,\" I exclaimed in admiration. \"They talk about Indian  fortitude. If I had given one of those Indians some sleeping pills,  he'd have taken them all and asked for more. But you are the real  American stuff, the pluck that can't be licked, and I'll soon have  you sound as a dollar.\"    Then he showed his immense bladder-like hand. \"I'll have to make  some preparation, and will operate in your shanty at 1 o'clock,\"  I said, thinking how very professional it sounded.    The preparation consisted of whetting my penknife and, much more  important, screwing up my nerves. And now I remembered my friend's  brandy, put the flask in my pocket, and went to the execution.    He was ready. \"Here,\" I said; \"take a good pull at this brandy.\"    \"I will not,\" was the reply. \"I'm man enough to go through on my  mettle.\"    \"'Oh! confound your mettle,\" I thought, for I wanted an excuse to  take some myself, but could not for shame under the circumstances.    \"Are you ready?\"    He laid his pudding-y hand on the table.    \"You better have your Indian friend hold that hand.\"    \"I'll never budge,\" he replied, with set teeth, and motioned the  Indian away. And I knew he would not flinch. He will never know  (till he reads this, perhaps) what an effort it cost me. I knew only  I must cut deep enough to reach the pus, not so deep as to touch  the artery, and not across the tendons, and must do it firmly, at  one clean stroke. I did.    It was a horrid success. He never quivered, but said: \"Is that all?  That's a pin-prick to what I've been through every minute for the  last week.\"    I felt faint, went out behind the cabin, and--shall I confess  it?--took a long swig of brandy. But I was as good as my promise:  in three days he was well enough to travel, and soon as strong as  ever.    I wonder if real doctors ever conceal, under an air of professional  calm, just such doubts and fears as worried me.          CHAPTER XI    THE SECOND BUFFALO HUNT        Though so trifling, the success of our first Buffalo hunt gave us  quite a social lift. The chiefs were equally surprised with the  whites, and when we prepared for a second expedition, Kiya sent  word that though he could not act as guide, I should ride his own  trained hunter, a horse that could run a trail like a hound, and  was without guile.    I am, always suspicious of a horse (or man) without guile.  I wondered what was the particular weakness of this exceptionally  trained, noble, and guileless creature. I have only one prejudice  in horseflesh--I do not like a white one. So, of course, when  the hunter arrived he was, white as marble, from mane to tail and  hoofs; his very eyes were of a cheap china colour, suggestive of  cataractine blindness. The only relief was a morbid tinge of faded  shrimp pink in his nostrils and ears. But he proved better than he  looked. He certainly did run tracks by nose like a hound, provided I  let him choose the track. He was a lively walker and easy trotter,  and would stay where the bridle was dropped, So I came to the  conclusion that Kiya was not playing a joke on me, but really had  lent me his best hunter, whose sepulchral whiteness I could see would  be of great advantage in snow time when chiefly one is supposed to  hunt.    Not only Kiya, but Pierre Squirrel, the head chief, seemed to harbour  a more kindly spirit. He now suddenly acquired a smattering of  English and a fair knowledge of French. He even agreed to lead us  through his own hunting grounds to the big Buffalo range, stipulating  that we be back by July 1, as that was Treaty Day, when all the  tribe assembled to receive their treaty money, and his presence as  head chief was absolutely necessary.    We were advised to start from Fort Smith, as the trail thence was  through a dryer country; so on the morning of June 24, at 6.50, we  left the Fort on our second Buffalo hunt.    Major A. M. Jarvis, Mr. E. A. Preble, Corporal Selig, Chief Pierre  Squirrel, and myself, all mounted, plus two pack-horses, prepared  for a week's campaign. Riding ahead in his yellow caftan and black  burnoose was Pierre Squirrel on his spirited charger, looking most  picturesque. But remembering that his yellow caftan was a mosquito  net, his black burnoose a Hudson's Bay coat, and his charger an  ornery Indian Cayuse, robbed the picture of most of its poetry.    We marched westerly 7 miles through fine, dry, jack-pine wood,  then, 3 miles through mixed poplar, pine, and spruce, And came to  the Slave River opposite Point Gravois. Thence we went a mile or  so into similar woods, and after another stretch of muskegs. We  camped for lunch at 11.45, having covered 12 miles.    At two we set out, and reached Salt River at three, but did not  cross there. It is a magnificent stream, 200 feet wide, with hard  banks and fine timber on each side; but its waters are brackish.    We travelled north-westerly, or northerly, along the east banks  for an hour, but at length away from it on a wide prairie, a mile  or more across here, but evidently extending much farther behind  interruptions of willow clumps. Probably these prairies join, with  those we saw on the Beaulieu trip. They are wet now, though a horse  can go anywhere, and the grass is good. We camped about six on a dry  place back from the river. At night I was much interested to hear  at intervals the familiar Kick-kick-kick-kick of the Yellow Rail  in the adjoining swamps. This must be its northmost range; we did  not actually see it.    Here I caught a garter-snake. Preble says it is the same form as  that at Edmonton. Our guide was as much surprised to see me take  it in my hands, as he was to see me let it go unharmed.    Next morning, after a short hour's travel, we came again to Salt  River and proceeded to cross. Evidently Squirrel had selected the  wrong place, for the sticky mud seemed bottomless, and we came near  losing two of the horses.    After two hours we all got across and went on, but most of the horses  had shown up poorly, as spiritless creatures, not yet recovered  from the effects of a hard winter.    Our road now lay over the high upland of the Salt Mountain, among  its dry and beautiful woods. The trip would have been glorious but  for the awful things that I am not allowed to mention outside of  Chapter IX.    Pierre proved a pleasant and intelligent companion; he did his  best, but more than once shook his head and said: \"Chevaux no good.\"    We covered 15 miles before night, and all day we got glimpses of  some animal on our track, 300 yards behind in the woods. It might  easily have been a Wolf, but at night he sneaked into camp a forlorn  and starving Indian dog. Next day we reached the long looked-for  Little Buffalo River. Several times of late Pierre had commented on  the slowness of our horses and enlarged on the awful Muskega that  covered the country west of the Little Buffalo. Now he spoke out  frankly and said we had been 21 days coming 40 miles when the road  was good; we were now coming to very bad roads and had to go as  far again. These horses could not do it, and get him back to Fort  Smith for July 1--and back at any price he must be.    He was willing to take the whole outfit half a day farther westward,  or, if we preferred it, he would go afoot or on horseback with the  pick of the men and horses for a hasty dash forward; but to take  the whole outfit on to the Buffalo country and get back on time  was not possible.    This was a bad shake. We held a council of war, and the things that  were said of that Indian should have riled him if he understood.  He preserved his calm demeanour; probably this was one of the  convenient times when all his English forsook him. We were simply  raging: to be half-way to our goal, with abundance of provisions,  fine weather, good health and everything promising well, and then  to be balked because our guide wanted to go back. I felt as savage  as the others, but on calmer reflection pointed out that Pierre  told us before starting that he must be back for Treaty Day, and  even now he was ready to do his best.    Then in a calm of the storm (which he continued to ignore) Pierre  turned to me and said: \"Why don't you go back and try the canoe  route? You can go down the Great River to Grand Detour, then portage  8 miles over to the Buffalo, go down this to the Nyarling, then up  the Nyarling into the heart of the Buffalo country; 21 days will  do it, and it will be easy, for there is plenty of water and no  rapids,\" and he drew a fairly exact map which showed that he knew  the country thoroughly.    There was nothing to be gained by going half a day farther.    To break up our party did not fit in at all with our plans, so, after  another brief stormy debate in which the guide took no part, we  turned without "]]]
