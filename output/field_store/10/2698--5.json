'What!' he cried. 'You don't mean to say that there is any coolness  between my father and you? I am more grieved than I can say. Knowing,  as I do, what a genuine respect my father has for your great talents, I  can only think that there must have been some misunderstanding. Perhaps  if you would allow me to act as a mediator--'    Mr Bickersdyke put down his paper and walked out of the room.    Psmith found him a quarter of an hour later in the card-room. He sat  down beside his table, and began to observe the play with silent  interest. Mr Bickersdyke, never a great performer at the best of times,  was so unsettled by the scrutiny that in the deciding game of the  rubber he revoked, thereby presenting his opponents with the rubber by  a very handsome majority of points. Psmith clicked his tongue  sympathetically.    Dignified reticence is not a leading characteristic of the  bridge-player's manner at the Senior Conservative Club on occasions  like this. Mr Bickersdyke's partner did not bear his calamity with  manly resignation. He gave tongue on the instant. 'What on earth's',  and 'Why on earth's' flowed from his mouth like molten lava. Mr  Bickersdyke sat and fermented in silence. Psmith clicked his tongue  sympathetically throughout.    Mr Bickersdyke lost that control over himself which every member of a  club should possess. He turned on Psmith with a snort of frenzy.    'How can I keep my attention fixed on the game when you sit staring at  me like a--like a--'    'I am sorry,' said Psmith gravely, 'if my stare falls short in any way  of your ideal of what a stare should be; but I appeal to these  gentlemen. Could I have watched the game more quietly?'    'Of course not,' said the bereaved partner warmly. 'Nobody could have  any earthly objection to your behaviour. It was absolute carelessness.  I should have thought that one might have expected one's partner at a  club like this to exercise elementary--'    But Mr Bickersdyke had gone. He had melted silently away like the  driven snow.    Psmith took his place at the table.    'A somewhat nervous excitable man, Mr Bickersdyke, I should say,' he  observed.    'A somewhat dashed, blanked idiot,' emended the bank-manager's late  partner. 'Thank goodness he lost as much as I did. That's some light  consolation.'    Psmith arrived at the flat to find Mike still out. Mike had repaired to  the Gaiety earlier in the evening to refresh his mind after the labours  of the day. When he returned, Psmith was sitting in an armchair with  his feet on the mantelpiece, musing placidly on Life.    'Well?' said Mike.    'Well? And how was the Gaiety? Good show?'    'Jolly good. What about Bickersdyke?'    Psmith looked sad.    'I cannot make Comrade Bickersdyke out,' he said. 'You would think that  a man would be glad to see the son of a personal friend. On the  contrary, I may be wronging Comrade B., but I should almost be inclined  to say that my presence in the Senior Conservative Club tonight  irritated him. There was no _bonhomie_ in his manner. He seemed to  me to be giving a spirited imitation of a man about to foam at the  mouth. I did my best to entertain him. I chatted. His only reply was to  leave the room. I followed him to the card-room, and watched his very  remarkable and brainy tactics at bridge, and he accused me of causing  him to revoke. A very curious personality, that of Comrade Bickersdyke.  But let us dismiss him from our minds. Rumours have reached me,' said  Psmith, 'that a very decent little supper may be obtained at a quaint,  old-world eating-house called the Savoy. Will you accompany me thither  on a tissue-restoring expedition? It would be rash not to probe these  rumours to their foundation, and ascertain their exact truth.'          10. Mr Bickersdyke Addresses His Constituents      It was noted by the observant at the bank next morning that Mr  Bickersdyke had something on his mind. William, the messenger, knew it,  when he found his respectful salute ignored. Little Briggs, the  accountant, knew it when his obsequious but cheerful 'Good morning' was  acknowledged only by a 'Morn'' which was almost an oath. Mr Bickersdyke  passed up the aisle and into his room like an east wind. He sat down at  his table and pressed the bell. Harold, William's brother and  co-messenger, entered with the air of one ready to duck if any missile  should be thrown at him. The reports of the manager's frame of mind had  been circulated in the office, and Harold felt somewhat apprehensive.  It was on an occasion very similar to this that George Barstead,  formerly in the employ of the New Asiatic Bank in the capacity of  messenger, had been rash enough to laugh at what he had taken for a  joke of Mr Bickersdyke's, and had been instantly presented with the  sack for gross impertinence.    'Ask Mr Smith--' began the manager. Then he paused. 'No, never mind,'  he added.    Harold remained in the doorway, puzzled.    'Don't stand there gaping at me, man,' cried Mr Bickersdyke, 'Go away.'    Harold retired and informed his brother, William, that in his,  Harold's, opinion, Mr Bickersdyke was off his chump.    'Off his onion,' said William, soaring a trifle higher in poetic  imagery.    'Barmy,' was the terse verdict of Samuel Jakes, the third messenger.  'Always said so.' And with that the New Asiatic Bank staff of  messengers dismissed Mr Bickersdyke and proceeded to concentrate  themselves on their duties, which consisted principally of hanging  about and discussing the prophecies of that modern seer, Captain Coe.    What had made Mr Bickersdyke change his mind so abruptly was the sudden  realization of the fact that he had no case against Psmith. In his  capacity of manager of the bank he could not take official notice of  Psmith's behaviour outside office hours, especially as Psmith had done  nothing but stare at him. It would be impossible to make anybody  understand the true inwardness of Psmith's stare. Theoretically, Mr  Bickersdyke had the power to dismiss any subordinate of his whom he did  not consider satisfactory, but it was a power that had to be exercised  with discretion. The manager was accountable for his actions to the  Board of Directors. If he dismissed Psmith, Psmith would certainly  bring an action against the bank for wrongful dismissal, and on the  evidence he would infallibly win it. Mr Bickersdyke did not welcome the  prospect of having to explain to the Directors that he had let the  shareholders of the bank in for a fine of whatever a discriminating  jury cared to decide upon, simply because he had been stared at while  playing bridge. His only hope was to catch Psmith doing his work badly.    He touched the bell again, and sent for Mr Rossiter.    The messenger found the head of the Postage Department in conversation  with Psmith. Manchester United had been beaten by one goal to nil on  the previous afternoon, and Psmith was informing Mr Rossiter that the  referee was a robber, who had evidently been financially interested in  the result of the game. The way he himself looked at it, said Psmith,  was that the thing had been a moral victory for the United. Mr Rossiter  said yes, he thought so too. And it was at this moment that Mr  Bickersdyke sent for him to ask whether Psmith's work was satisfactory.    The head of the Postage Department gave his opinion without hesitation.  Psmith's work was about the hottest proposition he had ever struck.  Psmith's work--well, it stood alone. You couldn't compare it with  anything. There are no degrees in perfection. Psmith's work was  perfect, and there was an end to it.    He put it differently, but that was the gist of what he said.    Mr Bickersdyke observed he was glad to hear it, and smashed a nib by  stabbing the desk with it.    It was on the evening following this that the bank-manager was due to  address a meeting at the Kenningford Town Hall.    He was looking forward to the event with mixed feelings. He had stood  for Parliament once before, several years back, in the North. He had  been defeated by a couple of thousand votes, and he hoped that the  episode had been forgotten. Not merely because his defeat had been  heavy. There was another reason. On that occasion he had stood as a  Liberal. He was standing for Kenningford as a Unionist. Of course, a  man is at perfect liberty to change his views, if he wishes to do so,  but the process is apt to give his opponents a chance of catching him  (to use the inspired language of the music-halls) on the bend. Mr  Bickersdyke was rather afraid that the light-hearted electors of  Kenningford might avail themselves of this chance.    Kenningford, S.E., is undoubtedly by way of being a tough sort of  place. Its inhabitants incline to a robust type of humour, which finds  a verbal vent in catch phrases and expends itself physically in  smashing shop-windows and kicking policemen. He feared that the meeting  at the Town Hall might possibly be a trifle rowdy.    All political meetings are very much alike. Somebody gets up and  introduces the speaker of the evening, and then the speaker of the  evening says at great length what he thinks of the scandalous manner in  which the Government is behaving or the iniquitous goings-on of the  Opposition. From time to time confederates in the audience rise and ask  carefully rehearsed questions, and are answered fully and  satisfactorily by the orator. When a genuine heckler interrupts, the  orator either ignores him, or says haughtily that he can find him  arguments but cannot find him brains. Or, occasionally, when the  question is an easy one, he answers it. A quietly conducted political  meeting is one of England's most delightful indoor games. When the  meeting is rowdy, the audience has more fun, but the speaker a good  deal less.

It is also absurd for those who promote a  community of children to forbid those who love each other from indulging  themselves in the last excesses of that passion, while they do not  restrain them from the passion itself, or those intercourses which are  of all things most improper, between a Father and a son, a brother and  a brother, and indeed the thing itself is most absurd. It is also  ridiculous to prevent this intercourse between the nearest relations,  for no other reason than the violence of the pleasure, while they think  that the relation of father and daughter, the brother and sister, is of  no consequence at all. It seems also more advantageous for the state,  that the husbandmen should have their wives and children in common than  the military, for there will be less affection [1262b] among them  in that case than when otherwise; for such persons ought to be under  subjection, that they may obey the laws, and not seek after innovations.  Upon the whole, the consequences of such a law as this would be directly  contrary to those things which good laws ought to establish, and which  Socrates endeavoured to establish by his regulations concerning women  and children: for we think that friendship is the greatest good which  can happen to any city, as nothing so much prevents seditions: and amity  in a city is what Socrates commends above all things, which appears  to be, as indeed he says, the effect of friendship; as we learn from  Aristophanes in the Erotics, who says, that those who love one another  from the excess of that passion, desire to breathe the same soul, and  from being two to be blended into one: from whence it would necessarily  follow, that both or one of them must be destroyed. But now in a city  which admits of this community, the tie of friendship must, from that  very cause, be extremely weak, when no father can say, this is my son;  or son, this is my father; for as a very little of what is sweet, being  mixed with a great deal of water is imperceptible after the mixture, so  must all family connections, and the names they go by, be necessarily  disregarded in such a community, it being then by no means necessary  that the father should have any regard for him he called a son, or  the brothers for those they call brothers. There are two things which  principally inspire mankind with care and love of their offspring,  knowing it is their own, and what ought to be the object of their  affection, neither of which can take place in this sort of community. As  for exchanging the children of the artificers and husbandmen with those  of the military, and theirs reciprocally with these, it will occasion  great confusion in whatever manner it shall be done; for of necessity,  those who carry the children must know from whom they took and to whom  they gave them; and by this means those evils which I have already  mentioned will necessarily be the more likely to happen, as blows,  incestuous love, murders, and the like; for those who are given from  their own parents to other citizens, the military, for instance, will  not call them brothers, sons, fathers, or mothers. The same thing  would happen to those of the military who were placed among the other  citizens; so that by this means every one would be in fear how to act  in consequence of consanguinity. And thus let us determine concerning a  community of wives and children.          CHAPTER V      We proceed next to consider in what manner property should be regulated  in a state which is formed after the most perfect mode of government,  whether it should be common or not; for this may be considered as a  separate question from what had been determined concerning [1263a] wives  and children; I mean, whether it is better that these should be held  separate, as they now everywhere are, or that not only possessions but  also the usufruct of them should be in common; or that the soil should  have a particular owner, but that the produce should be brought together  and used as one common stock, as some nations at present do; or on the  contrary, should the soil be common, and should it also be cultivated in  common, while the produce is divided amongst the individuals for their  particular use, which is said to be practised by some barbarians; or  shall both the soil and the fruit be common? When the business of  the husbandman devolves not on the citizen, the matter is much easier  settled; but when those labour together who have a common right of  possession, this may occasion several difficulties; for there may not  be an equal proportion between their labour and what they consume; and  those who labour hard and have but a small proportion of the produce,  will certainly complain of those who take a large share of it and do but  little for that. Upon the whole, as a community between man and man so  entire as to include everything possible, and thus to have all things  that man can possess in common, is very difficult, so is it particularly  so with respect to property; and this is evident from that community  which takes place between those who go out to settle a colony; for they  frequently have disputes with each other upon the most common occasions,  and come to blows upon trifles: we find, too, that we oftenest correct  those slaves who are generally employed in the common offices of the  family: a community of property then has these and other inconveniences  attending it.    But the manner of life which is now established, more particularly when  embellished with good morals and a system of equal laws, is far superior  to it, for it will have the advantage of both; by both I mean properties  being common, and divided also; for in some respects it ought to be in  a manner common, but upon the whole private: for every man's attention  being employed on his own particular concerns, will prevent mutual  complaints against each other; nay, by this means industry will be  increased, as each person will labour to improve his own private  property; and it will then be, that from a principle of virtue they will  mutually perform good offices to each other, according to the proverb,  \"All things are common amongst friends;\" and in some cities there are  traces of this custom to be seen, so that it is not impracticable, and  particularly in those which are best governed; some things are by this  means in a manner common, and others might be so; for there, every  person enjoying his own private property, some things he assists his  friend with, others are considered as in common; as in Lacedaemon, where  they use each other's slaves, as if they were, so to speak, their own,  as they do their horses and dogs, or even any provision they may want in  a journey.    It is evident then that it is best to have property private, but to make  the use of it common; but how the citizens are to be brought to it is  the particular [1263b] business of the legislator. And also with respect  to pleasure, it is unspeakable how advantageous it is, that a man should  think he has something which he may call his own; for it is by no means  to no purpose, that each person should have an affection for himself,  for that is natural, and yet to be a self-lover is justly censured; for  we mean by that, not one that simply loves himself, but one that loves  himself more than he ought; in like manner we blame a money-lover,  and yet both money and self is what all men love. Besides, it is very  pleasing to us to oblige and assist our friends and companions, as well  as those whom we are connected with by the rights of hospitality; and  this cannot be done without the establishment of private property, which  cannot take place with those who make a city too much one; besides, they  prevent every opportunity of exercising two principal virtues, modesty  and liberality. Modesty with respect to the female sex, for this virtue  requires you to abstain from her who is another's; liberality, which  depends upon private property, for without that no one can appear  liberal, or do any generous action; for liberality consists in imparting  to others what is our own.    This system of polity does indeed recommend itself by its good  appearance and specious pretences to humanity; and when first proposed  to any one, must give him great pleasure, as he will conclude it to be  a wonderful bond of friendship, connecting all to all; particularly  when any one censures the evils which are now to be found in society,  as arising from properties not being common, I mean the disputes which  happen between man and man, upon their different contracts with each  other; those judgments which are passed in court in consequence of  fraud, and perjury, and flattering the rich, none of which arise from  properties being private, but from the vices of mankind. Besides,  those who live in one general community, and have all things in common,  oftener dispute with each other than those who have their property  separate; from the very small number indeed of those who have their  property in common, compared with those where it is appropriated,  the instances of their quarrels are but few. It is also but right to  mention, not only the inconveniences they are preserved from who live in  a communion of goods, but also the advantages they are deprived of; for  when the whole comes to be considered, this manner of life will be found  impracticable.    We must suppose, then, that Socrates's mistake arose from the principle  he set out with being false; we admit, indeed, that both a family and a  city ought to be one in some particulars, but not entirely; for there  is a point beyond which if a city proceeds in reducing itself to one, it  will be no longer a city.    There is also another point at which it will still continue to be a  city, but it will approach so near "]]]
