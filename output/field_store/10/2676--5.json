There is a  good-sized storeroom, in which F---- has just finished putting me up  some cupboards, and a servants' room. It is not a palace is it? But it  is quite large enough to hold a great deal of happiness. Outside, the  premises are still more diminutive; a little wash-house stands near the  kitchen door, and further up the enclosure is a stable, and a small room  next it for saddles, and a fowl-house and pig-stye, and a coal-shed. Now  you know everything about my surroundings; but--there is always a  _but_ in everything--I have one great grievance, and I hope you will  appreciate its magnitude.    It was impossible for F---- to come up here when the house was first  commenced, and the wretch of a builder deliberately put the drawing-and  dining-room fireplaces in the corner, right up against the partition  wall, of course utterly destroying the comfort as well as the symmetry  of the rooms. I am convinced some economy of bricks is at the bottom of  this arrangement, especially as the house was built by contract; but the  builder pretends to be surprised that I don't admire it, and says, \"Why,  it's so oncommon, mum!\" I assure you, when I first saw the ridiculous  appearance of the drawing-room pier-glass in the corner, I should  liked to have screamed out at the builder (like the Queen in \"Alice in  Wonderland\"), \"Cut off his head!\"    When we were packing up the things to come here, our friends expressed  their astonishment at our taking so many of the little elegancies of  life, such as drawing-room ornaments, pictures, etc. Now it is a great  mistake not to bring such things, at all events a few of them, for they  are not to be bought here, and they give the new home a certain likeness  to the old one which is always delightful. I do not advise people to  make large purchases of elegancies for a colonial life, but a few pretty  little trifles will greatly improve the look of even a New Zealand  up-country drawing-room.    You have asked me also about our wardrobes. Gentlemen wear just what  they would on a Scotch or English farm; in summer they require perhaps  a lighter hat, and long rides are always taken in boots and breeches.  A lady wears exactly what would be suitable in the country in England,  except that I should advise her to eschew muslin; the country outside  the home paddock is too rough for thin material; she also wants thick  boots if she is a good walker, and I find nails or little screws in the  soles a great help for hill-walking. A hat is my only difficulty: you  really want a shady hat for a protection against the sun, but there are  very few days in the year on which you can ride in anything but a  close, small hat, with hardly any brim at all, and even this must have  capabilities of being firmly fastened on the head. My nice, wide-brimmed  Leghorn hangs idly in the hall: there is hardly a morning still enough  to induce me to put it on even to go and feed my chickens or potter  about the garden. This being winter, I live in a short linsey dress,  which is just right as to warmth, and not heavy. It is a mistake to  bring too much: a year's supply will be quite enough; fresh material can  easily be procured in Christchurch or any of the large towns, or sent  out by friends. I find my sewing-machine the greatest possible comfort,  and as time passes on and my clothes need remodelling it will be still  more use ful. Hitherto I have used it chiefly for my friends' benefit;  whilst I was in town I constantly had little frocks brought to me to  tuck, and here I employ it in making quilted cloth hats for my gentlemen  neighbours.          Letter XI: Housekeeping, and other matters.      Broomielaw, September 1866. I am writing to you at the end of a  fortnight of very hard work, for I have just gone through my first  experience in changing servants; those I brought up with me four  months ago were nice, tidy girls and as a natural consequence of these  attractive qualities they have both left me to be married. I sent them  down to Christchurch in the dray, and made arrangements for two more  servants to return in the same conveyance at the end of a week. In the  meantime we had to do everything for ourselves, and on the whole we  found this picnic life great fun. The household consists, besides F----  and me, of a cadet, as they are called--he is a clergyman's son learning  sheep-farming under our auspices--and a boy who milks the cows and  does odd jobs out of doors. We were all equally ignorant of practical  cookery, so the chief responsibility rested on my shoulders, and cost me  some very anxious moments, I assure you, for a cookery-book is after all  but a broken reed to lean on in a real emergency; it starts by assuming  that its unhappy student possesses a knowledge of at least the rudiments  of the art, whereas it ought not to disdain to tell you whether the  water in which potatoes are to be boiled should be hot or cold. I must  confess that some of my earliest efforts were both curious and nasty,  but E ate my numerous failures with the greatest good-humour; the only  thing at which he made a wry face was some soup into which a large lump  of washing-soda had mysteriously conveyed itself; and I also had to  undergo a good deal of \"chaff\" about my first omelette, which was of the  size and consistency of a roly-poly pudding. Next to these failures  I think the bread was my greatest misfortune; it went wrong from the  first. One night I had prepared the tin dish full of flour, made a hole  in the midst of the soft white heap, and was about to pour in a cupful  of yeast to be mixed with warm water (you see I know all about it in  theory), when a sudden panic seized me, and I was afraid to draw the  cork of the large champagne bottle full of yeast, which appeared to be  very much \"up.\" In this dilemma I went for F----. You must know that he  possesses such extraordinary and revolutionary theories on the subject  of cooking, that I am obliged to banish him from the kitchen altogether,  but on this occasion I thought I should be glad of his assistance. He  came with the greatest alacrity; assured me he knew all about it, seized  the big bottle, shook it violently, and twitched out the cork: there was  a report like a pistol-shot, and all my beautiful yeast flew up to the  ceiling of the kitchen, descending in a shower on my head; and F----  turned the bottle upside down over the flour, emptying the dregs of the  hops and potatoes into my unfortunate bread. However, I did not despair,  but mixed it up according to the directions given, and placed it on the  stove; but, as it turned out, in too warm a situation, for when I went  early the next morning to look at it, I found a very dry and crusty  mass. Still, nothing daunted, I persevered in the attempt, added more  flour and water, and finally made it up into loaves, which I deposited  in the oven. That bread _never_ baked! I tried it with a knife in  the orthodox manner, always to find that it was raw inside. The crust  gradually became several inches thick, but the inside remained damp, and  turned quite black at last; I baked it until midnight, and then I gave  it up and retired to bed in deep disgust. I had no more yeast and  could not try again, so we lived on biscuits and potatoes till the dray  returned at the end of the week, bringing, however, only one servant.  Owing to some confusion in the drayman's arrangements, the cook had been  left behind, and \"Meary,\" the new arrival, professed her willingness to  supply her place; but on trial being made of her abilities, she proved  to be quite as inexperienced as I was; and to each dish I proposed she  should attempt, the unvarying answer was, \"The missis did all that where  I come from.\" During the first few days after her arrival her  chief employment was examining the various knick-knacks about the  drawing-room; in her own department she was greatly taken with the  little cottage mangle. She mangled her own apron about twenty times a  day, and after each attempt I found her contemplating it with her head  on one side, and saying to herself, \"'Deed, thin, it's as smooth as  smooth; how iver does it do it?\" A few days later the cook arrived.  She is not all I could wish, being also Irish, and having the most  extraordinary notions of the use, or rather the abuse, of the various  kitchen implements: for instance, she will poke the fire with the  toasting fork, and disregards my gentle hints about the poker; but at  all events she can both roast mutton and bake bread. \"Meary\" has been  induced to wash her face and braid up her beautiful hair, and now shines  forth as a very pretty good-humoured girl. She is as clever and quick as  possible, and will in time be a capital housemaid. She has taken it into  her head that she would like to be a \"first-rater,\" as she calls it, and  works desperately hard in the prosecution of her new fancy.    I have never told you of the Sunday services we established here from  the first week of our arrival. There is no church nearer than those  in Christchurch, nor--I may mention parenthetically--is there a doctor  within the same distance. As soon as our chairs and tables were in their  proper places, we invited our shepherds and those neighbours immediately  around us to attend service on Sunday afternoon at three o'clock. F----  officiates as clergyman; _my_ duties resemble those of a beadle, as I  have to arrange the congregation in their places, see that they have  Prayer-books, etc. Whenever we go out for a ride, we turn our horses'  heads up some beautiful valley, or deep gorge of a river, in search of  the huts of our neighbours' shepherds, that we may tell the men of  these services and invite them to attend. As yet, we have met with  no refusals, but it will give you an idea of the scantiness of  our population "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/611"],[0,"Prester John (#10)"],[1,"ulders.  His face was seamed and lined and shrunken, so that he seemed as old as  Time itself.    Very carefully I crept after him, and found myself opposite the fold  where the gully was.  There was a clear path through the jungle, a path  worn smooth by many feet.  I followed it through the undergrowth and  over the screes till it turned inside the fold of the gully.  And then  it stopped short.  I was in a deep cleft, but in front was a slab of  sheer rock.  Above, the gully looked darker and deeper, but there was  this great slab to pass.  I examined the sides, but they were sheer  rock with no openings.    Had I had my wits about me, I would have gone back and followed the  spoor, noting where it stopped.  But the whole thing looked black magic  to me; my stomach was empty and my enterprise small.  Besides, there  was the terrible moaning of the imprisoned river in my ears.  I am  ashamed to confess it, but I ran from that gully as if the devil and  all his angels had been following me.  Indeed, I did not slacken till I  had put a good mile between me and those uncanny cliffs.  After that I  set out to foot it back.  If the horses would not come to me I must go  to them.    I walked twenty-five miles in a vile temper, enraged at my Dutchmen, my  natives, and everybody.  The truth is, I had been frightened, and my  pride was sore about it.  It grew very hot, the sand rose and choked  me, the mopani trees with their dull green wearied me, the 'Kaffir  queens' and jays and rollers which flew about the path seemed to be  there to mock me. About half-way home I found a boy and two horses, and  roundly I cursed him.  It seemed that my pony had returned right  enough, and the boy had been sent to fetch me.  He had got half-way  before sunset the night before, and there he had stayed.  I discovered  from him that he was scared to death, and did not dare go any nearer  the Rooirand.  It was accursed, he said, for it was an abode of devils,  and only wizards went near it.  I was bound to admit to myself that I  could not blame him. At last I had got on the track of something  certain about this mysterious country, and all the way back I wondered  if I should have the courage to follow it up.      [1] Baboon.    [2] Schelm: Rascal.        CHAPTER V    MR WARDLAW HAS A PREMONITION    A week later the building job was finished, I locked the door of the  new store, pocketed the key, and we set out for home. Sikitola was  entrusted with the general care of it, and I knew him well enough to be  sure that he would keep his people from doing mischief.  I left my  empty wagons to follow at their leisure and rode on, with the result  that I arrived at Blaauwildebeestefontein two days before I was looked  for.    I stabled my horse, and went round to the back to see Colin. (I had  left him at home in case of fights with native dogs, for he was an ill  beast in a crowd.) I found him well and hearty, for Zeeta had been  looking after him.  Then some whim seized me to enter the store through  my bedroom window.  It was open, and I crawled softly in to find the  room fresh and clean from Zeeta's care.  The door was ajar, and,  hearing voices, I peeped into the shop.    Japp was sitting on the counter talking in a low voice to a big  native--the same 'Mwanga whom I had bundled out unceremoniously.  I  noticed that the outer door giving on the road was shut, a most unusual  thing in the afternoon.  Japp had some small objects in his hand, and  the two were evidently arguing about a price.  I had no intention at  first of eavesdropping, and was just about to push the door open, when  something in Japp's face arrested me.  He was up to no good, and I  thought it my business to wait.    The low tones went on for a little, both men talking in Kaffir, and  then Japp lifted up one of the little objects between finger and thumb.  It was a small roundish stone about the size of a bean, but even in  that half light there was a dull lustre in it.    At that I shoved the door open and went in.  Both men started as if  they had been shot.  Japp went as white as his mottled face permitted.  'What the--' he gasped, and he dropped the thing he was holding.    I picked it up, and laid it on the counter.  'So,' I said, 'diamonds,  Mr Japp.  You have found the pipe I was looking for.  I congratulate  you.'    My words gave the old ruffian his cue.  'Yes, yes,' he said, 'I have,  or rather my friend 'Mwanga has.  He has just been telling me about it.'    The Kaffir looked miserably uncomfortable.  He shifted from one leg to  the other, casting longing glances at the closed door.    'I tink I go,' he said.  'Afterwards we will speak more.'    I told him I thought he had better go, and opened the door for him.  Then I bolted it again, and turned to Mr Japp.    'So that's your game,' I said.  'I thought there was something funny  about you, but I didn't know it was I.D.B. you were up to.'    He looked as if he could kill me.  For five minutes he cursed me with a  perfection of phrase which I had thought beyond him.  It was no I.D.B.,  he declared, but a pipe which 'Mwanga had discovered. 'In this kind of  country?' I said, quoting his own words. 'Why, you might as well expect  to find ocean pearls as diamonds.  But scrape in the spruit if you  like; you'll maybe find some garnets.'    He choked down his wrath, and tried a new tack.  'What will you take to  hold your tongue?  I'll make you a rich man if you'll come in with me.'  And then he started with offers which showed that he had been making a  good thing out of the traffic.    I stalked over to him, and took him by the shoulder.  'You old  reprobate,' I roared, 'if you breathe such a proposal to me again, I'll  tie you up like a sack and carry you to Pietersdorp.'    At this he broke down and wept maudlin tears, disgusting to witness.  He said he was an old man who had always lived honestly, and it would  break his heart if his grey hairs were to be disgraced.  As he sat  rocking himself with his hands over his face, I saw his wicked little  eyes peering through the slits of his fingers to see what my next move  would be.    'See here, Mr Japp,' I said, 'I'm not a police spy, and it's no  business of mine to inform against you.  I'm willing to keep you out of  gaol, but it must be on my own conditions.  The first is that you  resign this job and clear out.  You will write to Mr Colles a letter at  my dictation, saying that you find the work too much for you.  The  second is that for the time you remain here the diamond business must  utterly cease.  If 'Mwanga or anybody like him comes inside the store,  and if I get the slightest hint that you're back at the trade, in you  go to Pietersdorp.  I'm not going to have my name disgraced by being  associated with you.  The third condition is that when you leave this  place you go clear away.  If you come within twenty miles of  Blaauwildebeestefontein and I find you, I will give you up.'    He groaned and writhed at my terms, but in the end accepted them.  He  wrote the letter, and I posted it.  I had no pity for the old scamp,  who had feathered his nest well.  Small wonder that the firm's business  was not as good as it might be, when Japp was giving most of his time  to buying diamonds from native thieves.  The secret put him in the  power of any Kaffir who traded him a stone.  No wonder he cringed to  ruffians like 'Mwanga.    The second thing I did was to shift my quarters.  Mr Wardlaw had a  spare room which he had offered me before, and now I accepted it.  I  wanted to be no more mixed up with Japp than I could help, for I did  not know what villainy he might let me in for.  Moreover, I carried  Zeeta with me, being ashamed to leave her at the mercy of the old  bully.  Japp went up to the huts and hired a slattern to mind his  house, and then drank heavily for three days to console himself.    That night I sat smoking with Mr Wardlaw in his sitting-room, where a  welcome fire burned, for the nights on the Berg were chilly.  I  remember the occasion well for the queer turn the conversation took.  Wardlaw, as I have said, had been working like a slave at the Kaffir  tongues.  I talked a kind of Zulu well enough to make myself  understood, and I could follow it when spoken; but he had real  scholarship in the thing, and knew all about the grammar and the  different dialects. Further, he had read a lot about native history,  and was full of the doings of Tchaka and Mosilikatse and Moshesh, and  the kings of old.  Having little to do in the way of teaching, he had  made up for it by reading omnivorously.  He used to borrow books from  the missionaries, and he must have spent half his salary in buying new  ones.    To-night as he sat and puffed in his armchair, he was full of stories  about a fellow called Monomotapa.  It seems he was a great black  emperor whom the Portuguese discovered about the sixteenth century.  He  lived to the north in Mashonaland, and had a mountain full of gold.  The Portuguese did not make much of him, but they got his son and  turned him into a priest.    I told Wardlaw that he was most likely only a petty chief, whose  exploits were magnified by distance, the same as the caciques in  Mexico.  But the schoolmaster would not accept this.    'He must have been a big man, Davie.  You know that the old ruins in  Rhodesia, called Zimbabwe, were long believed to be Phoenician in  origin.  I have a book here which tells all about them.  But now it is  believed that they were built by natives.  I maintain that the men who  could erect piles like that'--and he showed me a picture--'were  something more than petty chiefs.'    Presently the object of this conversation appeared.  Mr Wardlaw thought  that we were underrating the capacity of the native.  This opinion was  natural enough in a schoolmaster, but not in the precise form Wardlaw  put it.  It was not his intelligence which he thought we underrated,  but his dangerousness."]]]
