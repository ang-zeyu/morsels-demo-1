The ransom  paid was forty thousand crowns, without other expenses.    On my way back to M. de Vaudeville, I passed by Saint Omer, where  I saw their great cannons, most of which were fouled and broken.  Also I passed by Therouenne, where I saw not one stone left on  another, save a vestige of the great church: for the Emperor  ordered the country people for five or six leagues round to clear  and take away the stones; so that now you may drive a cart over  the town: and the same at Hesdin, and no trace of castle and  fortress. Such is the evil that wars bring with them.    To return to my story; M. de Vaudeville soon got the better of  his ulcer, and was nearly healed: so he let me go, and sent me by  a trumpet, with passport, as far as Abbeville. I posted from  here, and went to find my master, King Henry, at Aufimon, who  received me gladly and with good favour. He sent MM. de Guise,  the Constable, and d' Estres, to hear from me the capture of  Hesdin; and I made them a true report, and assured them I had  seen the great cannons they had taken to Saint Omer: and the King  was glad, for he had feared the enemy would come further into  France. He gave me two hundred crowns to take me home: and I was  thankful to be free, out of this great torment and thunder of the  diabolical artillery, and away from the soldiers, blasphemers and  deniers of God. I must add that after Hesdin was taken, the King  was told I was not killed but taken prisoner. He made M. Goguier,  his chief physician, write to my wife that I was living, and she  was not to be unhappy, and he would pay my ransom.          BATTLE OF SAINT QUENTIN. 1557      After the battle of Saint Quentin, the King sent me to La Fere en  Tartenois, to M. le Marechal de Bourdillon, for a passport to M.  le Duc de Savoie, that I might go and dress the Constable, who  had been badly wounded in the back with a pistol-shot, whereof he  was like to die, and remained prisoner in the enemy's hands. But  never would M. le Duc de Savoie let me go to him, saying he would  not die for want of a surgeon; that he much doubted I would go  there only to dress him, and not rather to take some secret  information to him; and that he knew I was privy to other things  besides surgery, and remembered I had been his prisoner at  Hesdin. M. le Marechal told the King of this refusal: who wrote  to M. le Marechal, that if Mme. the Constable's Lady would send  some quick-witted man of her household I would give him a letter,  and had also something to say to him by word of mouth, entrusted  to me by the King and by M. le Cardinal de Lorraine. Two days  later there came one of the Constable's gentlemen of the  bedchamber, with his shirts and other linen, to whom M. le  Marechal gave a passport to go to the Constable. I was very glad,  and gave him my letter, and instructed him what his master must  do now he was prisoner.    I thought, having finished my mission, to return to the King; but  M. le Marechal begged me to stop at La Fere with him, to dress a  very great number of wounded who had retreated there after the  battle, and he would write to the King to explain why I stopped;  which I did. Their wounds were very putrid, and full of worms,  with gangrene, and corruption; and I had to make free play with  the knife to cut off what was corrupt, which was not done without  amputation of arms and legs, and also sundry trepannings. They  found no store of drugs at La Fere, because the surgeons of the  camp had taken them all away; but I found the waggons of the  artillery there, and these had not been touched. I asked M. le  Marechal to let me have some of the drugs which were in them,  which he did; and I was given the half only at one time, and five  or six days later I had to take the rest; and yet it was not half  enough to dress the great number of wounded. And to correct and  stop the corruption, and kill the worms in their wounds, I washed  them with Aegyptiacum dissolved in wine and eau-de-vie, and did  all I could for them; but in spite of all my care many of them  died.    There were at La Fere some gentlemen charged to find the dead  body of M. de Bois-Dauphin the elder, who had been killed in the  battle; they asked me to go with them to the camp, to pick him  out, if we could, among the dead; but it was not possible to  recognize him, the bodies being all far gone in corruption, and  their faces changed. We saw more than half a league round us the  earth all covered with the dead; and hardly stopped there,  because of the stench of the dead men and their horses; and so  many blue and green flies rose from them, bred of the moisture of  the bodies and the heat of the sun, that when they were up in the  air they hid the sun. It was wonderful to hear them buzzing; and  where they settled, there they infected the air, and brought the  plague with them. Mon petit maistre, I wish you had been there  with me, to experience the smells, and make report thereof to  them that were not there.    I was very weary of the place; I prayed M. le Marechal to let me  leave it, and feared I should be ill there; for the wounded men  stank past all bearing, and they died nearly all, in spite of  everything we did. He got surgeons to finish the treatment of  them, and sent me away with his good favour. He wrote to the King  of the diligence I had shown toward the poor wounded. Then I  returned to Paris, where I found many more gentlemen, who had  been wounded and gone thither after the battle.          THE JOURNEY TO THE CAMP AT AMIENS. 1558      The King sent me to Dourlan, under conduct of Captain Gouast;  with fifty men-at-arms, for fear I should be taken by the enemy;  and seeing we were always in alarms on the way, I made my man let  down, and made him the master; for I got on his horse, which  carried my valise, and could go well if we had to make our  escape, and I took his cloak and hat and gave him my mount, which  was a good little mare; he being in front, you would have taken  him for the master and me for the servant The garrison inside  Dourlan, when they saw us, thought we were the enemy, and fired  their cannon at us. Captain Gouast, my conductor, made signs to  them with his hat that we were not the enemy; at last they ceased  firing, and we entered Dourlan, to our great relief.    Five or six days before this, a sortie had been made from  Dourlan; wherein many captains and brave soldiers had been killed  or wounded: and among the wounded was Captain Saint Aubin,  vaillant comme l' espce, a great friend of M. de Guise: for whose  sake chiefly the King had sent me there. Who, being attacked with  a quartan fever, yet left his bed to command the greater part of  his company. A Spaniard, seeing him in command, perceived he was  a captain, and shot him through the neck with an arquebus.  Captain Saint Aubin thought himself killed; and by this fright I  protest to God he lost his quartan fever, and was forever free of  it. I dressed him, with Antoine Portail, surgeon-in-ordinary of  the King; and many other soldiers. Some died, others got off with  the loss of an arm or a leg or an eye, and said they had got off  cheap, to be alive at all. Then, the enemy having broken up their  camp, I returned to Paris.    I say nothing here of mon petit maistre, who was more comfortable  in his house than I at the wars.          THE JOURNEY TO BOURGES. 1562      The King with his camp was but a short time at Bourges, till  those within the walls should surrender; and they came out with  their goods saved. I know nothing worth remembering, but that a  boy of the King's kitchen, having come near the walls of the town  before the agreement had been signed, cried with a loud voice,  \"Huguenot, Huguenot, shoot here, shoot here,\" having his arm  thrown up and his hand spread out; a soldier shot his hand right  through with a bullet. When he was thus shot, he came to find me  to dress him. And the Constable seeing the boy in tears, with his  hand all bloody, asked who had wounded him: then a gentleman who  had seen him shot said it served him right, because he kept  calling \"Huguenot, hit here, aim here.\" And then the Constable  said, this Huguenot was a good shot and a good fellow, for most  likely if he had chosen to fire at the boy's head, he would have  hit it even more easily than his hand. I dressed the kitchen boy,  who was very ill. He recovered, but with no power in his hand:  and from that time his comrades called him \"Huguenot\": he is  still living now.          THE JOURNEY TO ROUEN. 1562      Now, as for the capture of Rouen, they killed many of our men  both before and at the attack: and the very next day after we had  entered the town, I trepanned eight or nine of our men, who had  been wounded with stones as they were on the breach. The air was  so malignant, that many died, even of quite small wounds, so that  some thought the bullets had been poisoned; and those within the  town said the like of us; for though they had within the town all  that was needful, yet all the same they died like those outside.    The King of Navarre was wounded, some days before the attack,  with a bullet in the shoulder. I visited him, and helped to dress  him, with one of his own surgeons, Master Gilbert, one of the  chief men of Montpellier, and others. They could not find the  bullet. I searched for it very accurately, and found reason to  believe it had entered at the top of the arm, by the head of the  bone, and had passed into the hollow part of the bone, which was  why they could not find it; and most of them said it had entered  his body and was lost in it. M. le Prince de La Roche-sur-Yon,  who dearly loved the King of Navarre, drew me aside and asked if  the wound were mortal. I told him yes,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5697"],[0,"Tales of Chinatown (#10)"],[1,"a  certain house. Right of search he had not, and so temporarily he was  baffled.    Now the nearest telephone was his objective, and presently, where a blue  light dimly pierced the mist, he paused, pushed open a swing door, and  stepped into a long, narrow passage. He descended three stairs, and  entered a room laden with a sickly perfume compounded of stale beer and  spirits; of greasy humanity--European, Asiastic, and African; of cheap  tobacco and cheaper scents; and, vaguely, of opium.    It was fairly well lighted, but the fog had penetrated here, veiling  some of the harshness of its rough appointments. An unsavoury den was  Malay Jack's, where flotsam of the river might be found. Yellow men  there were, and black men and brown men. But all the women present were  white.    Fan-tan was in progress at one of the tables, the four players being  apparently the only strictly sober people in the room. A woman  was laughing raucously as Kerry entered, and many coarse-voiced  conversations were in progress; but as he pulled the rough curtain walls  aside and walked into the room, a hush, highly complimentary to the  Chief Inspector's reputation, fell upon the assembly. Only the woman's  raucous laughter continued, rising, a hideous solo, above a sort of  murmur, composed of the words \"Red Kerry!\" spoken in many tones.    Kerry ignored the sensation which his entrance had created, and crossed  the room to a small counter, behind which a dusky man was standing,  coatless and shirt sleeves rolled up. He had the skin of a Malay but  the features of a stage Irishman of the old school. And, indeed, had he  known his own pedigree, which is a knowledge beyond the ken of any man,  partly Irish he might have found himself indeed to be.    This was Malay Jack, the proprietor of one of the roughest houses in  Limehouse. His expression, while propitiatory, was not friendly, but:    \"Don't get hot and bothered,\" snapped Kerry viciously. \"I want to use  your telephone, that's all.\"    \"Oh,\" said the other, unable to conceal his relief, \"that's easy. Come  in.\"    He raised a flap in the counter, and Kerry, passing through, entered  a little room behind the bar. Here a telephone stood upon a dirty,  littered table, and, taking it up:    \"City four hundred,\" called the Chief Inspector curtly. A moment later:  \"Hallo! Yes,\" he said. \"Chief Inspector Kerry speaking. Put me through  to my department, please.\"    He stood for a while waiting, receiver in hand, and smiled grimly to  note that the uproar in the room beyond had been resumed. Evidently  Malay Jack had given the \"all clear\" signal. Then:    \"Chief Inspector Kerry speaking,\" he said again. \"Has Detective Sergeant  Durham reported?\"    \"Yes,\" was the reply, \"half an hour ago. He's standing-by at Limehouse  Station. He followed you in a taxi, but lost you on the way owing to the  fog.\"    \"I don't wonder,\" said Kerry. \"His loss is not so great as mine.  Anything else?\"    \"Nothing else.\"    \"Good. I'll speak to Limehouse. Good-bye.\"    He replaced the receiver and paused for a moment, reflecting. Extracting  a piece of tasteless gum from between his teeth, he deposited it in  the grate, where a sickly fire burned; then, tearing the wrapper from  a fresh slip, he resumed his chewing and stood looking about him  with unseeing eyes. Fierce they were as ever, but introspective in  expression.    Famous for his swift decisions, for once in a way he found himself in  doubt. Malay Jack had keen ears, and there were those in the place who  had every reason to be interested in the movements of a member of the  Criminal Investigation Department, especially of one who had earned the  right to be dreaded by the rats of Limehouse. London's peculiar climate  fought against him, but he determined to make no more telephone calls  but to proceed to Limehouse police station.    He stepped swiftly into the bar, and, as he had anticipated, nearly  upset the proprietor, who was standing listening by the half-open door.  Kerry smiled fiercely into the ugly face, lifted the flap, and walked  down the room, through the aisle between the scattered tables, where the  air was heavy with strange perfumes, touched now with the bite of London  fog, and where slanting eyes and straight eyes, sober eyes and drunken  eyes, regarded him furtively. Something of a second hush there was, but  one not so complete as the first.    Kerry pulled the curtain aside, mounted the stair, walked along the  passage and out through the swing door into the yellow gloom of the  Causeway. Ten slow steps he had taken when he detected a sound of  pursuit. Like a flash he turned, clenching his fists. Then:    \"Inspector!\" whispered a husky voice.    \"Yes! Who are you? What do you want?\"    A dim form loomed up through the fog.    \"My name is Peters, sir. Inspector Preston knows me.\"    Kerry had paused immediately under a street lamp, and now he looked into  the pinched, lean face of the speaker, and:    \"I've heard of you,\" he snapped. \"Got some information for me?\"    \"I think so; but walk on.\"    Chief Inspector Kerry hesitated. Peters belonged to a class which  Kerry despised with all the force of his straightforward character. A  professional informer has his uses from the police point of view; and  while evidence of this kind often figured in reports made to the Chief  Inspector, he personally avoided contact with such persons, as he  instinctively and daintily avoided contact with personal dirt. But now,  something so big was at stake that his hesitation was only momentary.    A vision of the pale face of Lady Rourke, of the golden head leaning  weakly back upon the cushions of the coupe, as he had glimpsed it in  Bond Street, rose before his mind's eye as if conjured up out of the  fog. Peters shuffled along beside him, and:    \"Young Chada's done himself in to-night,\" continued the husky voice. \"He  brought a swell girl to the old man's house an hour ago. I was hanging  about there, thinking I might get some information. I think she was  doped.\"    \"Why?\" snapped Kerry.    \"Well, I was standing over on the other side of the street. Lou Chada  opened the door with a key; and when the light shone out I saw him carry  her in.\"    \"Carry her in?\"    \"Yes. She was in evening dress, with a swell cloak.\"    \"The car?\"    \"He came out again and drove it around to the garage at the back.\"    \"Why didn't you report this at once?\"    \"I was on my way to do it when I saw you coming out of Malay Jack's.\"    The man's voice shook nervously, and:    \"What are you scared about?\" asked Kerry savagely. \"Got anything else to  tell me?\"    \"No, no,\" muttered Peters. \"Only I've got an idea he saw me.\"    \"Who saw you?\"    \"Lou Chada.\"    \"What then?\"    \"Well, only--don't leave me till we get to the station.\"    Kerry blew down his nose contemptuously, then stopped suddenly.    \"Stand still,\" he ordered. \"I want to listen.\"    Silent, they stood in a place of darkness, untouched by any lamplight.  Not a sound reached them through the curtain of fog. Asiatic mystery  wrapped them about, but Kerry experienced only contempt for the  cowardice of his companion, and:    \"You need come no farther,\" he said coldly. \"Good night.\"    \"But------\" began the man.    \"Good night,\" repeated Kerry.    He walked on briskly, tapping the pavement with his malacca. The  sneaking figure of the informer was swallowed up in the fog. But not  a dozen paces had the Chief Inspector gone when he was arrested by a  frenzied scream, rising, hollowly, in a dreadful, muffled crescendo.  Words reached him.    \"My God, he's stabbed me!\"    Then came a sort of babbling, which died into a moan.    \"Hell!\" muttered Kerry, \"the poor devil was right!\"    He turned and began to run back, fumbling in his pocket for his electric  torch. Almost in the same moment that he found it he stumbled upon  Peters, who lay half in the road and half upon the sidewalk.    Kerry pressed the button, and met the glance of upturned, glazing eyes.  Even as he dropped upon his knee beside the dying man, Peters swept his  arm around in a convulsive movement, having the fingers crooked, coughed  horribly, and rolled upon his face.    Switching off the light of the torch, Kerry clenched his jaws in a tense  effort of listening, literally holding his breath. But no sound reached  him through the muffling fog. A moment he hesitated, well knowing his  danger, then viciously snapping on the light again, he quested in the  blood-stained mud all about the body of the murdered man.    \"Ah!\"    It was an exclamation of triumph.    One corner hideously stained, for it had lain half under Peters's  shoulder, Kerry gingerly lifted between finger and thumb a handkerchief  of fine white silk, such as is carried in the breast pocket of an  evening coat.    It bore an ornate monogram worked in gold, and representing the letters  \"L. C.\" Oddly enough, it was the corner that bore the monogram which was  also bloodstained.          III    THE ROOM OF THE GOLDEN BUDDHA        It was a moot point whether Lady Pat Rourke merited condemnation or  pity. She possessed that type of blonde beauty which seems to be a  lodestone for mankind in general. Her husband was wealthy, twelve  years her senior, and, far from watching over her with jealous care--an  attitude which often characterizes such unions--he, on the contrary,  permitted her a dangerous freedom, believing that she would appreciate  without abusing it.    Her friendship with Lou Chada had first opened his eyes to the perils  which beset the road of least resistance. Sir Noel Rourke was an  Anglo-Indian, and his prejudice against the Eurasian was one not lightly  to be surmounted. Not all the polish which English culture had given to  this child of a mixed union could blind Sir Noel to the yellow streak.  Courted though Chada was by some of the best people, Sir Noel remained  cold.    The long, magnetic eyes, the handsome, clear-cut features, above all,"]]]
