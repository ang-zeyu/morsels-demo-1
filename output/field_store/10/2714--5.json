Thereupon the  licentiate Pedro de Rojas and those devoted to him became more anxious.    Forty days passed in this manner, at the end of which Don Luis  appeared in the bay near the city, accompanied by Estevan Rodriguez  and many men; and there he anchored, not choosing to enter the city,  or to disembark. He caused a search to be made for the papers kept  in St. Augustine, and among them was found the royal order and the  nomination of Don Luys Dasmariñas to succeed to the governorship. One  of his partisans announced the fact to the city magistrates, who,  changing their ideas, and notwithstanding some opposition from the  partisans of Licentiate Rojas, summoned Don Luys Dasmariñas to the  municipal house and placed him in possession of the government. The  same was done by the soldiers whom Don Luys had with him, and by the  fleet. Each day brought a new disappointment to Licentiate Rojas,  who returned to his office of lieutenant-assessor, after a rule of  forty days.    If the death of Governor Gomez Perez Dasmariñas was an unfortunate  event, both for the loss of his person and for the loss of a so good  opportunity for the conquest of Terrenate, when all were certain of  success, the return of the fleet and the arrival of the troops in  the city was none the less a fortunate event, for, not many days  after--having anticipated their usual time for the voyage--there  arrived in Manila many Chinese ships which carried many men and  little merchandise, and seven mandarins bearing the insignia of  their office. This gave sufficient motive for suspecting that they  had heard of the departure of the fleet for Maluco and of the city's  lack of defense, and that they had therefore come on this occasion  to try to seize the country. But they desisted from the attempt  when they found the city with more troops than ever. They returned  to China without showing any other particular motive for coming,  and without either side showing that their motives were understood;  except that Governor Don Luys was watchful and on his guard. He  took the proper measures, especially those concerning the Chinese,  and their settlement and Parián.    No ships went to Nueva España from the Filipinas that year, because  Governor Gomez Perez, before starting on the expedition to Maluco, had  sent there the vessels \"San Felipe\" and \"San Francisco,\" both of which,  on account of heavy storms, had to put back, the \"San Felipe\" to the  port of Sebu and the \"San Francisco\" to Manila, and they were unable  to resail until the following year. It was suspected in Nueva España  that there were troubles in the islands because of the non-arrival  of the ships, and persons were not wanting to affirm more than had  really happened; nor was it possible at the same time--in the town  of Mexico--to ascertain whence the news had emanated. This was very  shortly known in España, by way of India, letters having been sent  to Venecia [Venice], through Persia; and immediately they set about  appointing a new governor.    In the first year of the government of Gomez Perez Dasmariñas, the need  of an Audiencia began to be felt by many, upon their seeing all the  power vested in one man, and that there was no one to whom they could  apply for remedy for certain cases. [47] He who felt this most keenly  was Bishop Fray Domingo de Salazar, who had had certain differences  and disputes with the governor, which obliged him to start for España,  notwithstanding his advanced age. The governor readily gave him leave  for that year, and a vessel for the voyage, in order to rid himself of  him; but at the same time and with full power from himself, he sent  Fray Francisco de Ortega of the Augustinian order to court, to meet  whatever the bishop might allege and to defend his side. Both reached  España, and each spoke as his interests demanded. The chief thing  insisted upon by the bishop was a request for the reëstablishment  of the Audiencia, and the foundation of other bishoprics in the  Filipinas, besides that of Manila, as well as other things which he  thought beneficial to the spiritual and temporal welfare. In all this  he was opposed by Ortega. But the authority and piety of the bishop  were of such weight, that, although at first the cause that made him,  at his advanced age, leave his church, and travel five thousand leguas  to España, seemed trivial, afterward he was favorably received by his  Majesty and the Council and all his petitions and propositions were  considered and discussed at length, and many consultations were held  with his Majesty, in order to have a decision passed upon them.    In the same year of ninety-three in which Gomez Perez died in the  Filipinas, the Council after consulting with his Majesty, resolved  that the office of lieutenant-assessor in judicial matters, which had  been filled by Licentiate Pedro de Roxas since the suppression of the  Audiencia, should be made more important than formerly in order to  facilitate matters; that the title of the office should thereafter be  that of lieutenant-general; and that in judicial matters the holder  of it should have authority to hear cases of appeal not exceeding  the value of one thousand Castilian ducados. Thereupon Licentiate  Pedro de Rojas was promoted to the office of alcalde of Mexico,  and Doctor Antonio de Morga was appointed by his Majesty to take the  latter's residencia, and to the office of lieutenant-general of the  Filipinas. In the course of his journey the latter arrived at Nueva  España in the beginning of the year ninety-four, and found that the  ships which, as abovesaid, had failed to come from the Filipinas,  had not arrived. Moreover the death of Gomez Perez, and the other  events that had occurred, were unknown until the arrival of Don Juan  de Velasco, in the month of November of the same year, in the galleon  \"Sanctiago,\" which had been sent to the islands the year before by  Viceroy Don Luys de Velasco, with the necessary supplies. He brought  news of the governor's death and of the succession to the office by  the latter's son, Don Luys Dasmariñas. Men and fresh supplies for the  islands were prepared immediately and together with many passengers and  religious from España, Doctor Antonio de Morga embarked in the port of  Acapulco, in the galleons \"San Felipe\" and \"Santiago,\" with everything  under his charge. He set sail March twenty-two of ninety-five, and  arrived under fair weather in the port of Cabit, June eleven of the  same year. He entered upon his office of lieutenant-general, and began  to occupy himself with his duties and the other matters in his charge.    While Don Luys Dasmariñas was governing, the suspicions and fear  of Xapon continued, which, together with the Chinese trouble, kept  the people in continual anxiety. The governor sent his cousin, Don  Fernando de Castro, with letters and despatches to the viceroy of  Canton and to that of Chincheo, where many of the Chinese who had  seized the galley and killed Governor Gomez Perez, were thought to  be found. Supposing that they had gone there with the galley, the  governor requested the Chinese authorities to deliver the culprits  for punishment, and to restore the royal standard, artillery, and  other things which had been seized. This was not obtained, for as  the galley had gone to Cochinchina, and the Chinese had dispersed in  so many directions, it could not be effected. However, after several  days, some of the guilty Chinese were brought from Malaca to Manila,  having been captured there by the chief captain, Francisco de Silva  de Meneses. From these men more accurate information was derived  concerning what had happened in the seizure of the galley and of the  governor's death, and justice was dealt them.    In the year ninety-four, when Don Luys was governor, a large junk came  to the Filipinas with some Cambodians and Siamese, several Chinese and  three Spaniards--one a Castilian, named Blaz Ruyz de Hernan Gonzalez,  and the other two Portuguese called Pantaleon Carnero and Antonio  Machado. While they were in the city of Chordemuco, [48] in Camboja,  with Prauncar [49] Langara, king of Camboja, the king of Sian attacked  the former king with many soldiers and elephants, conquered the land,  and seized the house and the treasures of the king, who, with his wife,  mother, sister, and his one daughter, and two sons, fled inland to  the kingdom of Lao. The king of Sian leaving some of his captains  to guard Camboja returned to his home with the rest of the army,  sending what booty he could not carry away by land, to Sian by sea  in several junks. He captured the Portuguese and Castilians whom he  found there [i.e., in Camboja], and embarked the above mentioned three  with other Cambodian slaves on board this junk, besides many goods,  and with a Siamese guard and a Chinese crew. While they were at sea,  the three Spaniards, aided by the Chinese, took possession of the  junk, and killed and imprisoned the Siamese guards. After that the  Spaniards and the Chinese came to blows as to who should have the  prize and where it was to be taken. The three Spaniards overcame the  Chinese, and killing most of them, took the junk to Manila with all  its cargo, and the vessel was adjudged to them. Liberty was granted  to the Cambodians as well as to the Chinese who had survived the fray.    The king of Sian reached his court in the city of Odia [50] and  waited for the arrival of the junk; but seeing that it delayed longer  than was necessary, he suspected that it had been seized or lost,  and desired to send someone to bring him news of it and the reason  for the delay. Among the prisoners he had made in Camboja was the  Portuguese, Diego"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7005"],[0,"The Antiquary — Complete (#10)"],[1," faith,\" said he, \"I  began to think you had changed your mind, and found the stupid people of  Fairport so tiresome, that you judged them unworthy of your talents, and  had taken French leave, as my old friend and brother-antiquary Mac-Cribb  did, when he went off with one of my Syrian medals.\"    \"I hope, my good sir, I should have fallen under no such imputation.\"    \"Quite as bad, let me tell you, if you had stolen yourself away without  giving me the pleasure of seeing you again. I had rather you had taken  my copper Otho himself.--But come, let me show you the way into my  sanctum sanctorum--my cell I may call it, for, except two idle hussies  of womankind,\" (by this contemptuous phrase, borrowed from his  brother-antiquary, the cynic Anthony a-Wood, Mr. Oldbuck was used to  denote the fair sex in general, and his sister and niece in particular),  \"that, on some idle pretext of relationship, have established themselves  in my premises, I live here as much a Coenobite as my predecessor, John  o' the Girnell, whose grave I will show you by and by.\"    Thus speaking the old gentleman led the way through a low door; but  before entrance, suddenly stopped short to point out some vestiges of  what he called an inscription, and, shaking his head as he pronounced it  totally illegible, \"Ah! if you but knew, Mr. Lovel, the time and trouble  that these mouldering traces of letters have cost me! No mother ever  travailed so for a child--and all to no purpose--although I am almost  positive that these two last marks imply the figures, or letters, LV,  and may give us a good guess at the real date of the building, since we  know, aliunde, that it was founded by Abbot Waldimir about the middle  of the fourteenth century--and, I profess, I think that centre ornament  might be made out by better eyes than mine.\"    \"I think,\" answered Lovel, willing to humour the old man, \"it has  something the appearance of a mitre.\"    \"I protest you are right! you are right! it never struck me before--see  what it is to have younger eyes--A mitre--a mitre--it corresponds in every  respect.\"    The resemblance was not much nearer than that of Polonius's cloud to a  whale, or an owzel; it was sufficient, however, to set the Antiquary's  brains to work. \"A mitre, my dear sir,\" continued he, as he led the way  through a labyrinth of inconvenient and dark passages, and accompanied  his disquisition with certain necessary cautions to his guest--\"A mitre,  my dear sir, will suit our abbot as well as a bishop--he was a mitred  abbot, and at the very top of the roll--take care of these three steps--I  know Mac-Cribb denies this, but it is as certain as that he took away my  Antigonus, no leave asked--you'll see the name of the Abbot of Trotcosey,  Abbas Trottocosiensis, at the head of the rolls of parliament in the  fourteenth and fifteenth centuries--there is very little light here, and  these cursed womankind always leave their tubs in the passage--now take,  care of the corner--ascend twelve steps, and ye are safe!\"    [Illustration: The Antiquary and Lovel--the Sanctum]    Mr. Oldbuck had by this time attained the top of the winding stair which  led to his own apartment, and opening a door, and pushing aside a piece  of tapestry with which it was covered, his first exclamation was, \"What  are you about here, you sluts?\" A dirty barefooted chambermaid threw  down her duster, detected in the heinous fact of arranging the sanctum  sanctorum, and fled out of an opposite door from the face of her  incensed master. A genteel-looking young woman, who was superintending  the operation, stood her ground, but with some timidity.    \"Indeed, uncle, your room was not fit to be seen, and I just came to see  that Jenny laid everything down where she took it up.\"    \"And how dare you, or Jenny either, presume to meddle with my private  matters?\" (Mr. Oldbuck hated puttting to rights as much as Dr. Orkborne,  or any other professed student.) \"Go, sew your sampler, you monkey, and  do not let me find you here again, as you value your ears.--I assure  you, Mr. Lovel, that the last inroad of these pretended friends to  cleanliness was almost as fatal to my collection as Hudibras's visit to  that of Sidrophel; and I have ever since missed                        My copperplate, with almanacks                      Engraved upon't and other knacks                      My moon-dial, with Napier's bones,                      And several constellation Stones;                      My flea, my morpeon, and punaise,                        I purchased for my proper ease.    And so forth, as old Butler has it.\"    The young lady, after courtesying to Lovel, had taken the opportunity to  make her escape during this enumeration of losses. \"You'll be poisoned  here with the volumes of dust they have raised,\" continued the  Antiquary; \"but I assure you the dust was very ancient, peaceful, quiet  dust, about an hour ago, and would have remained so for a hundred years,  had not these gipsies disturbed it, as they do everything else in the  world.\"    It was indeed some time before Lovel could, through the thick  atmosphere, perceive in what sort of den his friend had constructed his  retreat. It was a lofty room of middling size, obscurely lighted by high  narrow latticed windows. One end was entirely occupied by book-shelves,  greatly too limited in space for the number of volumes placed upon them,  which were, therefore, drawn up in ranks of two or three files deep,  while numberless others littered the floor and the tables, amid a chaos  of maps, engraving, scraps of parchment, bundles of papers, pieces of  old armour, swords, dirks, helmets, and Highland targets. Behind Mr.  Oldbuck's seat (which was an ancient leathern-covered easy-chair, worn  smooth by constant use) was a huge oaken cabinet, decorated at each  corner with Dutch cherubs, having their little duck-wings displayed, and  great jolter-headed visages placed between them. The top of this cabinet  was covered with busts, and Roman lamps and paterae, intermingled  with one or two bronze figures. The walls of the apartment were partly  clothed with grim old tapestry, representing the memorable story of Sir  Gawaine's wedding, in which full justice was done to the ugliness of the  Lothely Lady; although, to judge from his own looks, the gentle knight  had less reason to be disgusted with the match on account of disparity  of outward favour, than the romancer has given us to understand. The  rest of the room was panelled, or wainscotted, with black oak, against  which hung two or three portraits in armour, being characters in  Scottish history, favourites of Mr. Oldbuck, and as many in tie-wigs  and laced coats, staring representatives of his own ancestors. A large  old-fashioned oaken table was covered with a profusion of papers,  parchments, books, and nondescript trinkets and gewgaws, which seemed to  have little to recommend them, besides rust and the antiquity which it  indicates. In the midst of this wreck of ancient books and utensils,  with a gravity equal to Marius among the ruins of Carthage, sat a large  black cat, which, to a superstitious eye, might have presented the  genius loci, the tutelar demon of the apartment. The floor, as well  as the table and chairs, was overflowed by the same mare magnum of  miscellaneous trumpery, where it would have been as impossible to find  any individual article wanted, as to put it to any use when discovered.    Amid this medley, it was no easy matter to find one's way to a chair,  without stumbling over a prostrate folio, or the still more awkward  mischance of overturning some piece of Roman or ancient British pottery.  And, when the chair was attained, it had to be disencumbered, with a  careful hand, of engravings which might have received damage, and of  antique spurs and buckles, which would certainly have occasioned it  to any sudden occupant. Of this the Antiquary made Lovel particularly  aware, adding, that his friend, the Rev. Doctor Heavysterne from the  Low Countries, had sustained much injury by sitting down suddenly and  incautiously on three ancient calthrops, or craw-taes, which had been  lately dug up in the bog near Bannockburn, and which, dispersed by  Robert Bruce to lacerate the feet of the English chargers, came thus in  process of time to endamage the sitting part of a learned professor of  Utrecht.    Having at length fairly settled himself, and being nothing loath to make  inquiry concerning the strange objects around him, which his host was  equally ready, as far as possible, to explain, Lovel was introduced to a  large club, or bludgeon, with an iron spike at the end of it, which,  it seems, had been lately found in a field on the Monkbarns property,  adjacent to an old burying-ground. It had mightily the air of such  a stick as the Highland reapers use to walk with on their annual  peregrinations from their mountains; but Mr. Oldbuck was strongly  tempted to believe, that, as its shape was singular, it might have been  one of the clubs with which the monks armed their peasants in lieu of  more martial weapons,--whence, he observed, the villains were called  Colve-carles, or Kolb-kerls, that is, Clavigeri, or club-bearers. For  the truth of this custom, he quoted the chronicle of Antwerp and that  of St. Martin; against which authorities Lovel had nothing to oppose,  having never heard of them till that moment.    Mr. Oldbuck next exhibited thumb-screws, which had given the Covenanters  of former days the cramp in their joints, and a collar with the name of  a fellow convicted of theft, whose services, as the inscription bore,  had been adjudged to a neighbouring baron, in lieu of the modern  Scottish punishment, which, as Oldbuck said, sends such culprits to  enrich England by their labour, and themselves by their dexterity.  Many and various were the other curiosities which he showed;--but it  was chiefly upon his books that he prided"]]]
