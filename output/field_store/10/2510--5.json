In giving this verdict it was absolutely necessary to ascertain to the  fullest extent the time-keeping qualities of the exhibits. The judges  were led to this conclusion from the fact that in some of the  exhibits we were shown watches of equal finish containing every  known application of horological science in practically the same  construction, which should, as far as they could determine by merely  optical examination, keep quite as good time as watches of double and  treble the costs in other exhibits, thus involving their judgment in  doubt upon several elements of merit.    In justice to themselves and to the exhibitors the judges determined  to make the test in only one position, and give the whole of the time  at their disposal to testing the watches in what might be considered  their normal position, if such term is allowable--that is, \"pendent  up,\" or hanging.    At the solicitations of the judges Prof. H. C. Russell, Astronomer  Royal at the Sydney Observatory, kindly consented to make the tests,  and each of the exhibitors was requested to send three watches of his  own selection to the Observatory for this trial.    As will be seen by the report of Professor Russell, eight of the  ten exhibitors availed themselves of this opportunity. It is proper,  however, to state here that none of the exhibitors apparently  anticipated this test, and that it is possible some of the watches  might have made a better record if they had been differently attended  to since the opening of the Exhibition; but they were in this respect  all upon a par.    The majority of the watches had been made for exhibition purposes and  specially prepared to that end; and some had been previously rated at  observatories before sending.    _Notably, however, to the contrary of the above, the exhibit of the  American Watch Company was the ordinary and regular product of the  factory, such as is finished every day._    Notwithstanding the possibility that these exhibits might have been  better prepared for observatory time tests, some of the exhibits, as  will be seen by the rating, demonstrate the wonderful advances made in  the application of horological sciences to the manufacture of watches,  and that their rating is being made equal to that of the best marine  chronometers.    The following is the report of Professor Russell, and the accompanying  diagram (see next page) will readily give an idea of the comparative  performance of the different watches.    \"_Sydney Observatory, 26th February, 1880_.    \"GREGORY P. HARTE, ESQ.,    \"_Chairman of the Judges in Horology_.    \"SIR: I have the honor to report that, in response to your circular,  inviting exhibitors of watches each to send three watches to the  Observatory to be tested, I received on Monday, February 16th:    \"Three watches, Nos. 611, 669, 237, from Mr. Dolman, agent for Mr.  Tribandeau, Besancon.    \"Three watches, Nos. 987271, 670068, 1221336, from Mr. Manson, agent  for Waltham Watch Company.    \"Three watches, Nos. 3171, 1935, 2526, from Mr. Allerding, agent for  Mr. Kullberg.    \"And on the forenoon of February 17th:    \"Three watches, Nos. 11527, 19967, 12629, from Mr. Hoffnung, agent for  Lange & Sons.    \"Three watches, Nos. 1004, 8632, 8370, from Mr. Jacob, as agent for  Nicole & Nielsen.    \"Three watches, Nos. 70690, 23496, 113516, from Mr. Jacob, as agent  for Thomas Russell & Sons.    \"One watch, No. 47150, from Mr. Jacob, as agent for Castleberg.    \"Three watches, Nos. 12731, 12483, 11680, from Mr. Wiesener, as agent  for L. Audemars.    \"And on 18th February:    \"Two watches, Nos. 2724, 3528, from Mr. Jacob, as agent for  Castleberg.    \"On the 17th I began rating these watches, keeping them all in one  position (hanging), and subject to the same conditions of temperature;  in fact, they were all hung on one board, and kept in a compartment  locked up so as to avoid change of temperature, except such changes as  were due to changes in the weather.    \"They were rated once a day by the standard clock, which affords  special convenience for this work, and the error of which was found by  daily astronomical observations giving the absolute time; great care  was taken in rating so as to get the exact error of each watch every  day, care being taken at the same time to avoid errors in the seconds  dials, a fault sufficiently obvious in some of these exhibits.    \"In presenting the result of this test in the form of a diagram (see  diagram on the opposite page), it is necessary to explain that the  curves show only the change of rate in each case, and nothing is shown  here of the actual rate, which was large in several instances.    \"In the diagram spaces between faint lines represent seconds; and the  thicker faint lines represent the mean rate in each case: When the  curve rises it shows that the watch was gaining on its previous rate,  and when it falls the watch was losing on its previous rate. For  example, in No. 4 curve the thicker line shows the position of a  gaining rate of 3 sec. per day; on the 18th, watch No. 4 had a gaining  rate of 2.7 sec., and is plotted below the thick line; on the 19th and  20th it was less than 3 sec., but on the 21st the rate increased  to 4.8 sec., and the curve rises above the line. The same rule is  followed with losing rates; and, therefore, each curve shows whether  the watch was gaining or losing on its own rate.    \"For convenient reference the barometer and temperature curves are  plotted on the same sheet; although from the short time at command the  watches could only be tested in one position, a glance at the diagram  will show that in some degree at least the temperature adjustment and  the isochronal properties of the balance springs were also tested; and  I wish to call your attention to the fact that the whole of these  show in a more or less degree a marked response to the change in  temperature, some being over and others under corrected.    \"This fact is important, because it adds another proof that the old  form of compensation balance--even when combined with chronometer  spring and escapement and all the refinements which the best modern  workman can add to it--fails to yield a complete correction for  temperature; and I much regret that the American Watch Company, who  claim to have overcome this fault by means of a balance involving a  new arrangement of the metals, did not send to be tested any of their  first-class watches containing this important improvement.    \"Several of the rate curves, especially Nos. 4, 10, 13, 16, 21, and  24, respond to the change in the barometer in a way that shows the  isochronal properties of their balance springs are not quite perfect.  _Looking down the curves it becomes at once evident that watch No. 5,  which is No. 670068, second grade of the American Watch Company, is  remarkably free from these defects, and presents the best rate of  all the watches tested._ No. 9, which is No. 2526, Kullberg, is the  nearest approach to No. 5; indeed, the difference between its highest  and lowest rates is 0.1 sec. less than No. 5, but it has not such a  steady rate. The timekeeping of both these watches is remarkably good,  and shows that we have entered upon a new era in the manufacture of  pocket chronometers; _for these rates are better than the majority of  marine chronometers._    \"_Among the cheaper watches tested, No. 6, which is No. 1221336, of  the American Watch Company, is worthy of notice; it is a watch of the  sixth grade, yet its performance has been better than that of many  very expensive and otherwise first-class watches among those tested;  such a watch speaks volumes in favor of the system under which it was  made, and is the best comment upon the accuracy of the machines that  produced it._    \"There are several watches among those tested which have kept  wonderfully steady rates, but their comparative merit is shown in the  diagrams much better than it could be by any description. The daily  rate of each watch will be found in a table attached.    \"The changes in Nos. 1, 2, 3, 17, and 19 were too great to plot.    \"H. C. RUSSELL,    \"_Government Astronomer._\"           *       *       *       *       *      CONCLUSION OF THE REPORT.    In consideration of the facts developed in this examination, and the  preponderance of elements of inherent and comparative merit adjudged  by the judges (each in independent judgment) being equal to nearly  70 per cent. more than the next highest exhibit, they have found it  exceedingly difficult to make such a classification in degree as will  give even-handed justice to all.    We adjudge to the    AMERICAN WATCH COMPANY, OF WALTHAM, MASS., U. S. A.,    a first-class award, and such other special distinction, diploma,  medal, or award, as is consistent with the duties and obligations of  the honorable Sydney International Commission, for the largest and  most complete exhibit of horological instruments examined.    They also propose, as the only means by which their appreciation of  the merits of the production of this company can be adequately or  equitably recognized by the Committee on Judging and Awards, that a  separate first-class award be given for the timekeeping qualities of  all grades of these watches.    Also a separate first-class award for the perfection of this system of  watchmaking and the improvements in the mechanical parts of the watch,  being notably in the main spring and going barrel, the patent safety  pinion, the perfect epicycloidal form of all the teeth of the train,  in every grade of watch alike, and the isochronal adjustment of the  balance spring.    Also to Charles V. Woerd, mechanical superintendent of the American  Watch Company, Waltham, Mass., U. S. A., a first-class award for his  new mode of compensating balances.    Also a separate first-class award for the improvements in cases, the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38516"],[0,"The Children's Life of the Bee (#10)"],[1,"instance, also  build combs with six-sided cells; but their combs have only one layer of  cells, and are not only less regular, but also less substantial;  further, the wasps are so wasteful in their manner of working that, to  say nothing of the loss of material, they also deprive themselves of  about a third of the space that they might have used. Some bees  again--which are not as civilized as those in our hives--build only one  row of rearing-cells and rest their combs on shapeless and extravagant  columns of wax. Their provision-cells are nothing but great pots,  grouped together without any system or order. You could no more compare  these nests with the cities of our own honey-bees than you could a  village made up of huts with a modern town.      The very greatest ingenuity is shown in the construction of the combs,  quite apart from the admirable precision of the architecture. Thus, for  instance, there is a most skillful arrangement of alleys and gangways  through and around the comb, which provide short cuts in every  direction, allow the air to circulate, and prevent any block of the  traffic. The connecting cells again, which join the large cells to the  small ones, are so made that their shape can be altered with the least  possible delay. There may be different reasons for desiring this  alteration: an overflowing harvest may render more store-rooms  necessary, or the workers may consider that the population of the hive  should not be further increased, or it may be considered advisable that  more males should be born. In any of these cases the bees will proceed,  with unerring, unhesitating accuracy and precision to make the necessary  changes, turning small cells into large, and large into small; and this  without any waste of space or material, without allowing a single one of  their buildings to become mis-shapen or purposeless, without in any way  interfering with the neatness or general harmony of the hive.      The swarm whose movements we are following have started building their  combs, which are already becoming fit for use. And although, as we look  into the hive, we see little happening, there will be no pause, either  by day or by night, in the creation of the wax, which will proceed with  amazing quickness. The queen has been restlessly pacing to and fro on  the borders that shine out gleamingly white in the darkness; and no  sooner has the first row of cells been built than she eagerly takes  possession, together with her servants, her guardians and  counselors--though whether it be she who leads them, or they who direct  her, is a matter beyond our knowledge. When the spot has been reached  that she, or her retinue, regard as the proper one, she will arch her  back, lean forward, and introduce the end of her long spindle-shaped  body into one of the cells. Her escort form a circle around her, their  enormous black eyes watching her every movement; they caress her wings,  they feverishly wave their antennae as though to encourage her, to urge  her on, or perhaps to congratulate her. You can always easily tell where  the queen is, because around her there will be a kind of starry  cockade, something like the oval brooch that our grandmothers used to  wear; of this she will be the center. And there is one curious thing  that we may note here: the worker-bees never by any chance turn their  back to the queen. When she approaches a group they immediately form  themselves so as to face her, and walk backwards before her. It is a  token of respect or reverence that they never fail to show; it is the  unvarying custom.    Very soon the queen will be passing from cell to cell, busily laying her  eggs. She will first peep into the cell to make sure that all is in  order, and that she has not been there before. In the meanwhile two or  three of her escort will have hastened into the cell which she has just  left, in order to see that her work has been properly done, and to care  for, and as it were tuck up, the little bluish egg she has laid. From  now on right up to the first frosts of autumn the queen will never stop  laying; she lays while she is being fed, she even lays in her sleep, if  she ever does sleep, which may perhaps seem rather doubtful.    It will sometimes happen that the worker-bees, in their eagerness to  find room for their honey, will have stored it in some of the vacant  cells reserved for the queen; when she comes to these the workers  frantically carry away the honey so that she may lay her eggs. If there  is a shortage of cells for honey, and this is accumulating very fast,  the bees will contrive, as quickly as they can, to get ready a block of  large cells for the queen, as these take less time to build. But they  are cells for male bees; and when the queen comes to them, she seems  vexed; she will lay a few eggs, then stop, move away, and insist on  being given the smaller cells that are used for the workers' eggs. Her  daughters obey; they set to at once and reduce the size of the cells;  and the queen, in the meantime, goes back to the cells at which she had  started at the very beginning. These will be empty now, for the larvae  will have come to life, leaving their shadowy corner, and will already  have spread themselves over the flowers around, glittering in the rays  of the sun and quickening the smiling hours; and soon they will  sacrifice themselves in their turn to the new generation that now is  beginning to take their place in the cradles they have left.      The bees all obey the queen; and yet they themselves contrive to direct  her movements; for the number of eggs that she lays will be in strict  proportion to the food that is given her. She does not take it herself;  she is fed like a child by the workers. And if flowers are abundant, so  will the food be, and therefore the number of eggs. Here we find, as  everywhere in life, cause and effect working together in a circle of  which one part is always in darkness; the bees, like ourselves, obey the  lord of the wheel that is always turning and turning.    Some little time back I was showing one of my glass hives to a friend,  and he was almost startled to see the frantic activity there. Each comb  seemed alive; on every side there was movement, hurry, bustle, activity;  the nurses, incessantly stirring and doing, were busy around the  broodcells; the wax-makers were forming their ladders and living  gangways; the sculptors, the architects, cleaners, the builders, all  were at work, feverishly, restlessly, never pausing for food or sleep;  there was constant and pitiless effort among them all, save only in the  cradles where lay the larvae that soon themselves would be taking their  turn in this chain of unending duty, which permits of no illness and  accords no grave. And my friend, his curiosity soon satisfied, turned  away, and in his eyes there were signs of sorrow, and almost of fear.    And in good truth, beneath all the gladness that we find in the hive,  with its memories of precious jewels of summer--of flowers, of running  waters and peaceful skies--beneath all this there dwells a sadness as  deep as the eye of man ever has seen. And we, who dimly gaze at these  things, we who know that around us, in our own lives, among our own  people, there also is sadness, we know too that this has to be, as with  all things in nature. And thus it ever shall be, so long as we know not  her secret; and yet there are duties all must do, and those duties  suffice. And in the meantime let our heart murmur, if it will, \"It is  sad,\" but let our reason be content to add \"So it must be.\"          IV    THE YOUNG QUEENS      Let us now leave the new hive, which we find to be already beginning to  work as before, and go back to the old one, the mother-city, which the  swarm had left. Here, at the start, all looks forlorn, and dreary, and  empty. Two-thirds of the population have gone, have departed forever.  But thousands of bees remain; and these, whatever their feelings may be,  still are faithful to the duty that lies on them, and have not forgotten  what they have to do. They set to work, therefore, and try their best to  fill the places of those who have joined the swarm. They start cleaning  the city, look to the store-cells and put things in order there, attend  to what is necessary in the hive, and despatch their bands of  worker-bees to collect fresh food from the flowers.    And if the outlook at first appear rather gloomy, there still are signs  of hope wherever the eye may turn. One might almost fancy oneself in one  of the castles they tell of in fairy-stories, where there are millions  of tiny phials along the walls containing the souls of men about to be  born. For here, too, are lives that have not yet come to life. On all  sides, asleep in their closely-sealed cradles, in their thousands of  waxen cells, lie the larvae, the baby bees, whiter than milk, their arms  folded and their head bent forward as they wait for the hour to awake.  Around them hundreds of bees are dancing and flapping their wings. The  object of this seems to be to increase the temperature, and procure the  heat that is needed--or perhaps there may be some reason that is still  more obscure; for this dance of theirs combines some very extraordinary  movements whose meaning no observer has as yet been able to understand.    In another few days the lids of these thousands of urns--of which there  will be from sixty to eighty thousand in a hive--will break, and two  large, earnest black eyes will peer forth, while active jaws will be  busily gnawing away at the lid, to enlarge the opening. The nurses at  once come running; they help the young bee out of her prison, they clean  her and brush her, and with the tip of their tongue they give her the  first drop of honey that ushers in the new life. But the bee that has  come so strangely from another world is still trembling and pale, and  stares wildly around; she has something "]]]
