But it is his council that does everything; and he does  not meddle with any affair, but only amuses himself, neither would  it have been in his power to do otherwise; for if he wished to  govern in person, and wished to be free and exempt like other kings,  immediately they would put his eyes out, and would put him in a  house with his wife, and maintain him there miserably; and they  would raise up another son of his as king, or some one else more  fitting for it, of his lineage, in order that his council may govern  all his kingdoms and territories peacefully in his name. And with  respect to all the other heirs of the kingdom, as they grow up and  become persons able to command and govern, if it should appear to  the council that they desire to meddle with the government, they  take them and put their eyes out also, and put them also in a house;  so that there are always ten or twelve of these blind men, and those  who reign live with this fear before them.[117] They give food there  to them and to their wives and children. This king has many  men-at-arms, and many gentlemen who guard and serve him, and they  receive very good pay and rations, and are always at the court with  their arms; and they send some to the frontiers on the mainland  whenever they are required.    They make gold and silver money in this city; the gold coins are  called Sarafin, and are worth three hundred maravedis, and most of  them are halves, which are worth a hundred and fifty, a round coin  like ours,[118] and with Moorish letters on both sides, and about  the size of a fanon of Calicut, with Moorish letters, and it is  worth fifty-five maravedis; they call these tanga, and they are of  very fine silver, and of the standard of twelve dinars.[119] There  is a large quantity of this money, both gold and silver, and much of  it goes out to India, where it has much currency.    There came a Portuguese fleet to this kingdom of Ormuz, and its  captain-major was Alfonso de Alborquerque, who attempted to come to  an understanding with this kingdom of Ormuz, but the Moors would not  agree, and on that account this captain began to make war upon the  whole kingdom at all the seaports, and he did them much injury, and  at last he came and touched at the port of Ormuz with his fleet, and  there was a great battle there, with many and great ships full of  many and smart well-armed men. And the said captain routed the fleet  of the Moors, and killed many of them, and sunk many of their ships,  and took and burned many which were moored in the harbour, drawn up  by the wall of the city. And when the king and the governors of the  country saw such great destruction of their people and ships,  without being able to assist them, they offered peace to the  before-mentioned captain, who accepted it under the condition that  they should let him make a fortress at one extremity of the city;  and they agreed, and this began to be done; and the work having  commenced, the Moors repented again, and did not choose that more  should be built; and then the Portuguese began again to make war  upon them, and they did them so great damage, and slaughtered so  many people, that they made them tributary to the King of Portugal  to the amount of fifteen thousand serafins of gold each year.    Some years from that time the king and governors of Ormuz sent an  ambassador with offers of services and letters to the King of  Portugal, and the before-named captain returned with his answer and  a good fleet to the city of Ormuz,[120] and there they received him  very peacefully in this city, and at once gave him permission and a  place in which to built the fortress, which on a former occasion the  Portuguese had begun to build: and he ordered it to be built at  once, very large and magnificent. At this time the king, who was a  Moor, and very young, and in the power of the governors, and so  ruined that he did not dare do anything of himself, found the means  to inform the captain-major secretly of the little liberty he  enjoyed, and that the governors kept him like a prisoner, and that  they had forcibly taken the government which belongs to others who  were accustomed to exercise it, and that it appeared that they were  exchanging letters with Sheikh Ismail in order to give him the  kingdom. The captain-major kept this very secret, and determined to  have an interview with the king; and they agreed that this interview  should be in some large houses near the sea. On the day on which the  interview was to take place, the captain-major entered the houses  with ten or fifteen captains, leaving his people well arranged, and  all concerted as was most convenient. So the king and his principal  governor came there with many people, and the king and the governor  entered the houses with ten or twelve honourable Moors, and the door  was well shut and guarded. Then the captain-major ordered them to  kill the governor[121] with their daggers in his presence and that  of the king: and he said to the king, \"Have no fear, Sir, for I do  this to make you absolute king.\" However those who were without  heard the noise, and began to raise a disturbance, that it to say,  the relations, servants, and friends of the said governor, who were  many in number, and all came armed, so that it was necessary for the  captain-major to take the king by the hand; they went up on to the  roof, both of them armed, in order that the king might speak thence  to the Moors, and might pacify them; so he spoke to them, but could  do nothing with them. They, on the contrary, required that he should  confide to them his brother and lord: and they went thence to  establish themselves in the king's palace, saying they would make  another king. The captain-major wished to lay hands upon them, and  thus they remained a great part of the day, and the king sought how  to turn them out, and the captain-major determined to kill them by  force or to drive them out, as they did not choose to go out of the  fortress. So when the Moors saw that the captain-major, with the  king, was determined to attack them, they resolved to give the  fortress to the king; and when they gave it up, the king commanded  that they should be banished immediately, they and their families;  and this was done, and they went to the mainland.    The captain-major conducted the king from these houses to the palace  in triumph and honourably, and with many people, both of ours and of  his, and entrusted him to the other governor who was so before. He  then committed to him his palaces and the city very freely, and told  the governor to serve the king very honourably, and to leave him to  govern his country at his pleasure, and only give him advice, as  happens with other Moorish kings: and thus he put him at liberty. He  then left in the fortress that was built a captain and many men of  Portugal, and ships, in order to favour this king, who does nothing  without the advice of the captain of the fort. And he is in  submission to the King of Portugal, with all his kingdoms and  territories.    After the captain-major had put everything in quiet and order, and  under his command, he then had banished by the public crier, and  turned out of the island all the paiderastoi, with a warning that if  they returned there again they would be burned, at which the king  showed great satisfaction. He likewise ordered all the blind kings  who were in the city to be taken, and there were thirteen or  fourteen of them, and put in a large ship, and he sent them to  India, and they were landed at Goa, where he gave orders for them to  be maintained at the expense of his revenues, so that they might end  their days there, and not cause any disturbance in the kingdom of  Ormuz, and be in peace and quietness.      DIULCINDI.    Leaving the kingdom of Ormuz, from the mouth of the Sea of Persia  the coast goes to the south-east for a hundred and seventy-two  leagues as far as Diulcinde,[122] entering the kingdom of  Ulcinde,[123] which is between Persia and India. It is a kingdom,  and has a Moorish king over it, and most of the inhabitants of the  country are Moors, and there are some Gentiles subject to the Moors.  This king has an extended rule over the country in the interior, and  few seaports. They have many horses. On the eastern side this  country is bounded by the kingdom of Cambay, and on the west by  Persia. It is in obedience to Sheikh Ismail. The Moors are white and  coloured; they have a language of their own, and also speak that of  the Persians and of Arabia. There is much wheat and barley in this  country, and plenty of meat. It is a level country, with little  timber. They make little practice of navigating the sea; they  possess extensive sea-beaches, where there are great fisheries, and  they catch large fish, which they dry and salt, both for consumption  in the country and for exportation in small vessels to other  kingdoms. In this country they give dried fish to their horses to  eat. A few ships which sail to this country from India, bring rice,  sugar, and some spices, timber, planks, and Indian canes, which are  as thick as a man's leg. And in all this trade they make much money;  and from this place they carry away cotton, horses, and cloth. A  great river comes into the sea through this kingdom; it comes  through the middle of Persia, and they say that it comes out of the  river Eufrates. Along this river there are many large and rich towns  of Moors. It is a very fertile and fruitful land, and very abundant  in provisions.      KINGDOM OF GUZERAT, IN INDIA.    Leaving the kingdom of Ulcinde, in the same direction, at a distance  of fifty leagues, the traveller enters the first[124] India, in the  great kingdom of Guzarat, which kingdom had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3829"],[0,"Love Among the Chickens (#10)"],[1,"very young or the very  hungry. The uncompromising coldness and solidity of the viands was  enough to appall a man conscious that his digestion needed humouring. A  huge cheese faced us in almost a swashbuckling way. I do not know how  else to describe it. It wore a blatant, rakish,  _nemo-me-impune-lacessit_ air, and I noticed that the professor  shivered slightly as he saw it. Sardines, looking more oily and  uninviting than anything I had ever seen, appeared in their native tin  beyond the loaf of bread. There was a ham, in its third quarter, and a  chicken which had suffered heavily during a previous visit to the  table. Finally, a black bottle of whisky stood grimly beside Ukridge's  plate. The professor looked the sort of man who drank claret of a  special year, or nothing.    We got through the meal somehow, and did our best to delude ourselves  into the idea that it was all great fun; but it was a shallow pretence.  The professor was very silent by the time we had finished. Ukridge had  been terrible. The professor had forced himself to be genial. He had  tried to talk. He had told stories. And when he began one--his stories  would have been the better for a little more briskness and  condensation--Ukridge almost invariably interrupted him, before he had  got half way through, without a word of apology, and started on some  anecdote of his own. He furthermore disagreed with nearly every opinion  the professor expressed. It is true that he did it all in such a  perfectly friendly way, and was obviously so innocent of any intention  of giving offence, that another man--or the same man at a better  meal--might have overlooked the matter. But the professor, robbed of  his good dinner, was at the stage when he had to attack somebody. Every  moment I had been expecting the storm to burst.    It burst after dinner.    We were strolling in the garden, when some demon urged Ukridge, apropos  of the professor's mention of Dublin, to start upon the Irish question.  I had been expecting it momentarily, but my heart seemed to stand still  when it actually arrived.    Ukridge probably knew less about the Irish question than any male adult  in the kingdom, but he had boomed forth some very positive opinions of  his own on the subject before I could get near enough to him to whisper  a warning. When I did, I suppose I must have whispered louder than I  had intended, for the professor heard me, and my words acted as the  match to the powder.    \"He's touchy about Ireland, is he?\" he thundered. \"Drop it, is it? And  why? Why, sir? I'm one of the best tempered men that ever came from  Dublin, let me tell you, and I will not stay here to be insulted by the  insinuation that I cannot discuss Ireland as calmly as any one in this  company or out of it. Touchy about Ireland, is it? Touchy--?\"    \"But, professor--\"    \"Take your hand off my arm, Mr. Garnet. I will not be treated like a  child. I am as competent to discuss the affairs of Ireland without heat  as any man, let me tell you.\"    \"Father--\"    \"And let me tell you, Mr. Ukridge, that I consider your opinions  poisonous. Poisonous, sir. And you know nothing whatever about the  subject, sir. Every word you say betrays your profound ignorance. I  don't wish to see you or to speak to you again. Understand that, sir.  Our acquaintance began to-day, and it will cease to-day. Good-night to  you, sir. Come, Phyllis, me dear. Mrs. Ukridge, good-night.\"        CHAPTER IX    DIES IRAE    Why is it, I wonder, that stories of Retribution calling at the wrong  address strike us as funny instead of pathetic? I myself had been  amused by them many a time. In a book which I had read only a few days  before our cold-dinner party a shop-woman, annoyed with an omnibus  conductor, had thrown a superannuated orange at him. It had found its  billet not on him but on a perfectly inoffensive spectator. The  missile, said the writer, \"'it a young copper full in the hyeball.\" I  had enjoyed this when I read it, but now that Fate had arranged a  precisely similar situation, with myself in the role of the young  copper, the fun of the thing appealed to me not at all.    It was Ukridge who was to blame for the professor's regrettable  explosion and departure, and he ought by all laws of justice to have  suffered for it. As it was, I was the only person materially affected.  It did not matter to Ukridge. He did not care twopence one way or the  other. If the professor were friendly, he was willing to talk to him by  the hour on any subject, pleasant or unpleasant. If, on the other hand,  he wished to have nothing more to do with us, it did not worry him. He  was content to let him go. Ukridge was a self-sufficing person.    But to me it was a serious matter. More than serious. If I have done my  work as historian with an adequate degree of skill, the reader should  have gathered by this time the state of my feelings.      \"I did not love as others do:       None ever did that I've heard tell of.     My passion was a by-word through       The town she was, of course, the belle of.\"    At least it was--fortunately--not quite that; but it was certainly  genuine and most disturbing, and it grew with the days. Somebody with a  taste for juggling with figures might write a very readable page or so  of statistics in connection with the growth of love. In some cases it  is, I believe, slow. In my own I can only say that Jack's beanstalk was  a backward plant in comparison. It is true that we had not seen a great  deal of one another, and that, when we had met, our interview had been  brief and our conversation conventional; but it is the intervals  between the meeting that do the real damage. Absence--I do not claim  the thought as my own--makes the heart grow fonder. And now, thanks to  Ukridge's amazing idiocy, a barrier had been thrust between us. Lord  knows, the business of fishing for a girl's heart is sufficiently  difficult and delicate without the addition of needless obstacles. To  cut out the naval miscreant under equal conditions would have been a  task ample enough for my modest needs. It was terrible to have to  re-establish myself in the good graces of the professor before I could  so much as begin to dream of Phyllis. Ukridge gave me no balm.    \"Well, after all,\" he said, when I pointed out to him quietly but  plainly my opinion of his tactlessness, \"what does it matter? Old  Derrick isn't the only person in the world. If he doesn't want to know  us, laddie, we just jolly well pull ourselves together and stagger  along without him. It's quite possible to be happy without knowing old  Derrick. Millions of people are going about the world at this moment,  singing like larks out of pure light-heartedness, who don't even know  of his existence. And, as a matter of fact, old horse, we haven't time  to waste making friends and being the social pets. Too much to do on  the farm. Strict business is the watchword, my boy. We must be the  keen, tense men of affairs, or, before we know where we are, we shall  find ourselves right in the gumbo.    \"I've noticed, Garny, old horse, that you haven't been the whale for  work lately that you might be. You must buckle to, laddie. There must  be no slackness. We are at a critical stage. On our work now depends  the success of the speculation. Look at those damned cocks. They're  always fighting. Heave a stone at them, laddie, while you're up. What's  the matter with you? You seem pipped. Can't get the novel off your  chest, or what? You take my tip and give your brain a rest. Nothing  like manual labour for clearing the brain. All the doctors say so.  Those coops ought to be painted to-day or to-morrow. Mind you, I think  old Derrick would be all right if one persevered--\"    \"--and didn't call him a fat little buffer and contradict everything he  said and spoil all his stories by breaking in with chestnuts of your  own in the middle,\" I interrupted with bitterness.    \"My dear old son, he didn't mind being called a fat little buffer. You  keep harping on that. It's no discredit to a man to be a fat little  buffer. Some of the noblest men I have met have been fat little  buffers. What was the matter with old Derrick was a touch of liver. I  said to myself, when I saw him eating cheese, 'that fellow's going to  have a nasty shooting pain sooner or later.' I say, laddie, just heave  another rock or two at those cocks, will you. They'll slay each other.\"    I had hoped, fearing the while that there was not much chance of such a  thing happening, that the professor might get over his feeling of  injury during the night and be as friendly as ever next day. But he was  evidently a man who had no objection whatever to letting the sun go  down upon his wrath, for when I met him on the following morning on the  beach, he cut me in the most uncompromising manner.    Phyllis was with him at the time, and also another girl, who was, I  supposed, from the strong likeness between them, her sister. She had  the same mass of soft brown hair. But to me she appeared almost  commonplace in comparison.    It is never pleasant to be cut dead, even when you have done something  to deserve it. It is like treading on nothing where one imagined a  stair to be. In the present instance the pang was mitigated to a  certain extent--not largely--by the fact that Phyllis looked at me. She  did not move her head, and I could not have declared positively that  she moved her eyes; but nevertheless she certainly looked at me. It was  something. She seemed to say that duty compelled her to follow her  father's lead, and that the act must not be taken as evidence of any  personal animus.    That, at least, was how I read off the message.    Two days later I met Mr. Chase in the village.    \"Hullo, so you're back,\" I said.    \"You've discovered my secret,\" he admitted; \"will you have a cigar or a  cocoanut?\"    There was a pause.    \"Trouble I hear, while I was away,\" he said.    I nodded. "]]]
