He had  died of shock at being deserted by his companions.    From this time matters gradually became worse and worse. Hitherto, as a  rule, only one of the man-eaters had made the attack and had done the  foraging, while the other waited outside in the bush; but now they  began to change their tactics, entering the bomas together and each  seizing a victim. In this way two Swahili porters were killed during  the last week of November, one being immediately carried off and  devoured. The other was heard moaning for a long time, and when his  terrified companions at last summoned up sufficient courage to go to  his assistance, they found him stuck fast in the bushes of the boma,  through which for once the lion had apparently been unable to drag him.  He was still alive when I saw him next morning, but so terribly mauled  that he died before he could be got to the hospital.    Within a few days of this the two brutes made a most ferocious attack  on the largest camp in the section, which for safety's sake was  situated within a stone's throw of Tsavo Station and close to a  Permanent Way Inspector's iron hut. Suddenly in the dead of night the  two man-eaters burst in among the terrified workmen, and even from my  boma, some distance away, I could plainly hear the panic-stricken  shrieking of the coolies. Then followed cries of \"They've taken him;  they've taken him,\" as the brutes carried off their unfortunate victim  and began their horrible feast close beside the camp. The Inspector,  Mr. Dalgairns, fired over fifty shots in the direction in which he  heard the lions, but they were not to be frightened and calmly lay  there until their meal was finished. After examining the spot in the  morning, we at once set out to follow the brutes, Mr. Dalgairns feeling  confident that he had wounded one of them, as there was a trail on the  sand like that of the toes of a broken limb. After some careful  stalking, we suddenly found ourselves in the vicinity of the lions, and  were greeted with ominous growlings. Cautiously advancing and pushing  the bushes aside, we saw in the gloom what we at first took to be a  lion cub; closer inspection, however, showed it to be the remains of  the unfortunate coolie, which the man-eaters had evidently abandoned at  our approach. The legs, one arm and half the body had been eaten, and  it was the stiff fingers of the other arm trailing along the sand which  had left the marks we had taken to be the trail of a wounded lion. By  this time the beasts had retired far into the thick jungle where it was  impossible to follow them, so we had the remains of the coolie buried  and once more returned home disappointed.    Now the bravest men in the world, much less the ordinary Indian coolie,  will not stand constant terrors of this sort indefinitely. The whole  district was by this time thoroughly panic-stricken, and I was not at  all surprised, therefore, to find on my return to camp that same  afternoon (December 1) that the men had all struck work and were  waiting to speak to me. When I sent for them, they flocked to my boma  in a body and stated that they would not remain at Tsavo any longer for  anything or anybody; they had come from India on an agreement to work  for the Government, not to supply food for either lions or \"devils.\" No  sooner had they delivered this ultimatum than a regular stampede took  place. Some hundreds of them stopped the first passing train by  throwing themselves on the rails in front of the engine, and then,  swarming on to the trucks and throwing in their possessions anyhow,  they fled from the accursed spot.    After this the railway works were completely stopped; and for the next  three weeks practically nothing was done but build \"lion-proof\" huts  for those workmen who had had sufficient courage to remain. It was a  strange and amusing sight to see these shelters perched on the top of  water-tanks, roofs and girders--anywhere for safety--while some even  went so far as to dig pits inside their tents, into which they  descended at night, covering the top over with heavy logs of wood.  Every good-sized tree in the camp had as many beds lashed on to it as  its branches would bear--and sometimes more. I remember that one night  when the camp was attacked, so many men swarmed on to one particular  tree that down it came with a crash, hurling its terror-stricken load  of shrieking coolies close to the very lions they were trying to avoid.  Fortunately for them, a victim had already been secured, and the brutes  were too busy devouring him to pay attention to anything else.          CHAPTER VII    THE DISTRICT OFFICER'S NARROW ESCAPE      Some little time before the flight of the workmen, I had written to Mr.  Whitehead, the District Officer, asking him to come up and assist me in  my campaign against the lions, and to bring with him any of his askaris  (native soldiers) that he could spare. He replied accepting the  invitation, and told me to expect him about dinner-time on December 2,  which turned out to be the day after the exodus. His train was due at  Tsavo about six o'clock in the evening, so I sent my \"boy\" up to the  station to meet him and to help in carrying his baggage to the camp. In  a very short time, however, the \"boy\" rushed back trembling with  terror, and informed me that there was no sign of the train or of the  railway staff, but that an enormous lion was standing on the station  platform. This extraordinary story I did not believe in the least, as  by this time the coolies--never remarkable for bravery--were in such a  state of fright that if they caught sight of a hyena or a baboon, or  even a dog, in the bush, they were sure to imagine it was a lion; but I  found out next day that it was an actual fact, and that both  stationmaster and signalman had been obliged to take refuge from one of  the man-eaters by locking themselves in the station building.    I waited some little time for Mr. Whitehead, but eventually, as he did  not put in an appearance, I concluded that he must have postponed his  journey until the next day, and so had my dinner in my customary  solitary state. During the meal I heard a couple of shots, but paid no  attention to them, as rifles were constantly being fired off in the  neighbourhood of the camp. Later in the evening, I went out as usual to  watch for our elusive foes, and took up my position in a crib made of  sleepers which I had built on a big girder close to a camp which I  thought was likely to be attacked. Soon after settling down at my post,  I was surprised to hear the man-eaters growling and purring and  crunching up bones about seventy yards from the crib. I could not  understand what they had found to eat, as I had heard no commotion in  the camps, and I knew by bitter experience that every meal the brutes  obtained from us was announced by shrieks and uproar. The only  conclusion I could come to was that they had pounced upon some poor  unsuspecting native traveller. After a time I was able to make out  their eyes glowing in the darkness, and I took as careful aim as was  possible in the circumstances and fired; but the only notice they paid  to the shot was to carry off whatever they were devouring and to retire  quietly over a slight rise, which prevented me from seeing them. There  they finished their meal at their ease.    As soon as it was daylight, I got out of my crib and went towards the  place where I had last heard them. On the way, whom should I meet but  my missing guest, Mr. Whitehead, looking very pale and ill, and  generally dishevelled.    \"Where on earth have you come from?\" I exclaimed. \"Why didn't you turn  up to dinner last night?\"    \"A nice reception you give a fellow when you invite him to dinner,\" was  his only reply.    \"Why, what's up?\" I asked.    \"That infernal lion of yours nearly did for me last night,\" said  Whitehead.    \"Nonsense, you must have dreamed it!\" I cried in astonishment.    For answer he turned round and showed me his back. \"That's not much of  a dream, is it?\" he asked.    His clothing was rent by one huge tear from the nape of the neck  downwards, and on the flesh there were four great claw marks, showing  red and angry through the torn cloth. Without further parley, I hurried  him off to my tent, and bathed and dressed his wounds; and when I had  made him considerably more comfortable, I got from him the whole story  of the events of the night.    It appeared that his train was very late, so that it was quite dark  when he arrived at Tsavo Station, from which the track to my camp lay  through a small cutting. He was accompanied by Abdullah, his sergeant  of askaris, who walked close behind him carrying a lighted lamp. All  went well until they were about half-way through the gloomy cutting,  when one of the lions suddenly jumped down upon them from the high  bank, knocking Whitehead over like a ninepin, and tearing his back in  the manner I had seen. Fortunately, however, he had his carbine with  him, and instantly fired. The flash and the loud report must have dazed  the lion for a second or two, enabling Whitehead to disengage himself;  but the next instant the brute pounced like lightning on the  unfortunate Abdullah, with whom he at once made off. All that the poor  fellow could say was: \"Eh, Bwana, simba\" (\"Oh, Master, a lion\"). As the  lion was dragging him over the bank, Whitehead fired again, but without  effect, and the brute quickly disappeared into the darkness with his  prey. It was of course, this unfortunate man whom I had heard the lions  devouring during the night. Whitehead himself had a marvellous escape;  his wounds were happily not very deep, and caused him little or no  inconvenience afterwards.    On the same day, December 3, the forces arrayed against the lions were  further strengthened. Mr. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38189"],[0,"A Treatise on Sheep: (#10)"],[1,"which have been enacted for the security  of the revenue, is very justly complained of, as imposing heavy  penalties upon actions, which, antecedent to the statutes that  declared them to be crimes, had always been understood to be innocent.  But the cruelest of our revenue laws, I will venture to affirm, are  mild and gentle in comparison to some of those which the clamour of  our merchants and manufacturers has extorted from the legislature, for  the support of their own absurd and oppressive monopolies. Like the  laws of Draco, these laws may be said to be all written in blood.\"  None of the laws, however, were effectual, not even the one passed in  the middle of the seventeenth century, by which the offence was  rendered capital. In spite of the vigilance of our government, a  contraband trade in wool was long carried on between the inhabitants  of the French and English coasts, especially those of Sussex, by a  class of men called _Owlers_, from their only venturing abroad in  the night, and who were tempted to despise the penalty, with an  intrepidity astonishing to the rest of Europe, by the high prices that  were sure to be afforded to them in the Gallic market. Again, during  the first half of the eighteenth century, large quantities of wool  were constantly smuggled from Ireland to France, by which our trading  interests were considerably injured, and the plans for suppressing  exportation shown to be worse than useless.    (51.) _Prosperity of the Dutch Manufacturers._--The woollen  manufactures of the Hollanders were first established in 1636, or  1637, by one hundred and forty English families, who went from Norfolk  and Suffolk, to settle at Leyden, and Alkmaer. The Dutch manufacture  of fine woollen cloths was, however, commenced much earlier, or about  1624, at which time they began to interfere with the English trade in  the Netherlands; insomuch that, in the twenty-second year of the reign  of James I., a certificate was given to the Parliament of 25,000  cloths having been made that year in Holland. Upon this the House of  Commons resolved, 1st, \"That the merchant adventurers setting impost  upon our cloth, is a grievance, and ought not to be continued; and  that all other merchants promiscuously, as well as that company, may  transport everywhere northern and western kersies, and new draperies.\"    2dly. \"That other merchants, besides the Merchant Adventurers'  Company, may freely trade with dyed and dressed cloths, and all sorts  of coloured cloths, into Germany and the Low Countries.\" Much  annoyance appears to have resulted to this island, from the progress  which the manufacturers in Holland still continued to make, and some  curious speculations were of course formed in the minds of the  ingenious. In 1651, a scheme was laid before the English commonwealth,  for obtaining from the court of Spain an exclusive right to purchase  _all_ the Spanish wool; or, in other words, to ruin the Holland  market, by stopping the supplies. The projector observed, \"That this  proposed preemption would totally dissolve the woollen manufacture of  Holland, which, by means of that wool (Spanish), hath of late years  mightily increased, to the destruction of the vent of all fine cloths,  of English manufacture, in Holland, France, and the east country; and  hath drawn from us considerable numbers of weavers, dyers, and cloth  workers, now settled at Leyden, and other towns in Holland, by whose  help they have very much improved their skill in cloth, and have made  in that one province (one year with another) 24,000 or 26,000 cloths  yearly. That the Hollanders have of late years bought and exported  from Biscay, four-fifth parts at least of all their wools, and have  sold there proportionally of their own country stuffs.\" This was  certainly a novel method of accomplishing an end by a sweeping  monopoly; but the theory was too fine-spun ever to be reducible to  practice.    (52.) _Fluctuating State of the Trade between 1635 and 1693._--By the  great act of tonnage and poundage, passed in 1660, on the restoration  of Charles II., taxes were imposed, among other things, on the  exportation of woollen manufactures, and it was not till the reign of  William, that the wretched policy of such regulations was discovered,  and a law was passed in 1700, by which the duties on woollens were  abolished, because in the words of the act (ll & 12 William III. chap.  20), \"the wealth and prosperity of the kingdom doth, in a great  measure, depend on the improvement of its woollen manufactures, and  the profitable trade carried on by the exportation thereof.\"    In the time of Charles II., an act was passed for the erection of  manufactories (Par. I, Sess. I, Cap. 40), by which it is enacted, that  no native or stranger is to export wool nor skins with wool upon them,  until made into work, or put to the best advantage, under the pain of  first value thereof, half to the king, and half to the informer. It is  also, in this act, ordered, \"that none forestall the mercat of wooll,  nor keep up the same to a dearth, under the pain against regrators and  forestallers, and that for eschewing the deceit of putting stones, or  the like stuffs therein, no wooll be wrapt up in the fleece, under the  pain of confiscation, half to the king, and half to the discoverer and  pursuer, declaring always that the Exchequer may licence the export of  wool and skins, as they shall see cause.\"    The French refugees, in 1635, brought money and talent into England,  and contributed greatly to the erection of manufactories for _slight_  stuffs, and other French fabrics, never before made in England. The  former law for burying in woollen not being well observed, it was  repealed by an Act of Parliament, in the thirtieth year of that king  (cap. 3.), which enacted a register to be kept in every parish, by the  incumbent or his substitute, that every thing about the corpse of the  deceased was made of sheep's wool, of which an affidavit was to be  made by the relation of the deceased, and lodged with the incumbent,  under the penalty of L5, a moiety of which went to the poor of the  parish; the rest to the informer. But this was a sorry check, as  vanity was so predominant among the rich, that they paid the penalty  rather than want the pleasure of adorning their departed relatives  with lace and linen.    In 1667, France supplanted England in many foreign markets, owing to  the care that Colbert at that time took to bring the French woollens  to perfection. The English immediately turned their attention to other  manufactures, in which, as in that of paper, they quickly excelled,  and thus compelled the French to abandon markets, in which they had  long remained without a rival.    In 1698, a problem was started concerning the manufactures of the  country--whether or not a general linen manufacture would prove  beneficial to England? As London at this time abounded with new  projects and schemes, all promising as usual a hoard of wealth, the  question caused much excitement. It was at last determined that a  novelty of this kind would lead to the sowing of a great quantity of  flax in England, and the neglect of the woollen manufacture, which  would follow, might probably lower the price of land; for, as they  said at the time, \"it requires about twenty acres of land to breed  wool, for setting on work the same number of hands which one acre of  flax would employ; and yet, in the end, the woollen manufacture will  be found to employ by far the greatest number of hands, and yield the  most profit to the public, as well as to the manufacturers.\"    (53.) _Irish Manufactures discouraged._--In the same year (1698), the  English house of Peers addressed King William with the view of  inducing him to discourage the woollen manufactures of Ireland, which,  in spite of many restrictions, still continued to cause much vexation  to the monopolizers of England. The address ran thus:--\"The growing  manufacture of cloth in Ireland, both by the cheapness of all sorts of  the necessaries of life,[7] and _the goodness of materials for making  all manner of cloth_, doth invite his subjects of England, with their  families and servants, to leave their habitation to settle there, to  the increase of the woollen manufacture in Ireland, which makes his  loyal subjects in this kingdom very apprehensive, that the further  growth of it may greatly prejudice the said manufacture here; and  praying, that his Majesty would be pleased, in the most public and  effectual way that may be, to declare to all his subjects of Ireland,  that the growth and increase of the woollen manufacture there, hath  long, and will ever be, looked upon with great jealousy by all his  subjects of this kingdom.\" A similar address was presented by the  Commons, and this most liberal and enlightened monarch was pleased to  answer, \"_Gentlemen, I will do all that in me lies to discourage the  woollen manufacture of Ireland._\" This was certainly altogether a  strange proceeding, especially when viewed in conjunction with the  cruel prohibitions of former periods.[8] Their foreign trade is said  by some to have been much diminished by this coolness; but much of the  poignancy and crushing animosity of the request are lost when we  consider that encouragement was at the same time given by England to  the making of Irish linen, his Majesty being desired in the same  address, to forward that manufacture, pursuant to the dictates of an  act passed in 1696. Nay, some are of opinion that these measures  resulted from the soundest views of the relative situations of the  countries, and that the prudent tenor of English enactments was never  better exhibited, than in the discouragement of the woollen and  encouragement of the linen manufactures of Ireland.            [7] The people of Ireland produced worsted and woollen yarn at          a cheaper rate than we could, owing to their poor being able        "]]]
