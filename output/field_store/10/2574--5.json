Judas, son of Mattathias, came into prominence and is known as Judas  Maccabeus,--the first of the Maccabees. Under his leadership the  people returned to Jerusalem and found the Temple deserted, as it had  been left by the army of Antiochus. Its gates had been broken down  and burned; and within the walls weeds were growing. Judas tried to  cleanse and rehabilitate the House; he brought in new vessels, and  replaced the candlestick, the altar of incense, the table of shewbread,  and the veils, {53} and built a new altar for burnt offerings. Then  in the year 163 B. C. the House was rededicated; and the occasion was  remembered in annual festival thereafter under the name of the Feast of  Dedication.[84]    In the interest of self-preservation the Jews entered into an alliance  with the Romans, who eventually became their masters. During the reign  of the Maccabees the Temple fell into decay, and when the last of that  dynasty had been succeeded by Herod the Great, the House was little  more than a ruin. Nevertheless the priestly orders had been maintained;  and some semblance of ritualistic worship had continued. The history of  the Temple of Zerubbabel is merged with that of the Temple of Herod.    THE TEMPLE OF HEROD    In the year 37 B. C. Herod I, known in history as Herod the Great,  was established on the throne as King of Judea. He had already served  successively as procurator and tetrarch, and, indeed, had been king in  name for some time prior to his enthronement, during which period he  had been in hostile conflict with the people over whom the decree of  the Roman Senate had made him ruler. He came to the throne noted for  arrogance and cruelty; and his reign was one of tyranny, in which even  family relationship and the closest ties of blood proved unavailing  to protect the victims of his displeasure. In the early part of his  reign he put to death nearly all the members of the Sanhedrin, the  great Jewish Council, and throughout he ruled with increasing severity.  Nevertheless he was successful in maintaining peace with other {54}  governments, and by his Roman masters was accounted an able ruler.  Among his acts of cruelty was the slaughter of the babes of Bethlehem,  a murder planned and executed in the hope of including among the  victims the Child Jesus.[85]    Such is the character of the man who proposed to replace the time-worn  Temple of Zerubbabel by a new and more splendid structure. Can it be  thought that a proffered gift from such a donor could be acceptable to  the Lord? David had aforetime offered to build a House to the Lord,  but had been restrained, for he was a man of blood. Herod's purpose in  the great undertaking was that of aggrandizing himself and the nation,  rather than the rendering of homage to Jehovah. His proposition to  rebuild or restore the Temple on a scale of increased magnificence was  regarded with suspicion and received with disfavor by the Jews, who  feared that were the ancient edifice demolished, the arbitrary monarch  might abandon his plan and the people would be left without a Temple.  To allay these fears the king proceeded to reconstruct and restore the  old edifice, part by part, directing the work so that at no time was  the Temple service seriously interrupted. So little of the ancient  structure was allowed to stand, however, that the Temple of Herod must  be regarded {55} as a new creation. The work was begun about sixteen  years before the birth of Christ; and while the Holy House itself was  practically completed within a year and a half, this part of the labor  having been performed by a body of one thousand priests specially  trained for the purpose, the temple area was a scene of uninterrupted  building operations down to the year 63 A. D. We read that in the  time of Christ's ministry the Temple had been forty-six years in  building;[86] and at that time it was unfinished.    The Biblical record gives us little information regarding this the  last and the greatest of ancient temples; for what we know concerning  it we are indebted mainly to Josephus, with some corroborative  testimony found in the Talmud. In all essentials the Holy House or  Temple proper was similar to the two earlier houses of sanctuary,  though externally far more elaborate and imposing than either; but in  the matter of surrounding courts and associated buildings, the Temple  of Herod preeminently excelled. In proceeding from the outer wall to  the innermost enclosure occupied by the Holy House one would traverse  successive courts, each at a higher level than the last, to which  arrangement the slopes of Mount Moriah were favorable. The courts  extended as enormous platform-terraces, supported by foundations of  massive masonry, which rose vertically in some places seven hundred  feet from the foot of the hill.    The outer wall enclosing the entire temple area, which approximated  the form of a square, measured four hundred cubits, or one stadium,  (about six hundred feet) along each side. The east wall, constituting  the principal {56} defense of the city on that side, was unbroken  by gates; on each of the other three sides one or more large and  beautiful portals afforded passage through the fortress-like wall.  The four sides of the great enclosure, immediately within the outer  wall, were occupied by a series of magnificent porticoes, of Grecian  design, forming a covered colonnade in which every pillar was a  massive monolith of white marble. This colonnade was interrupted at  the north-west corner, where the continuity of the wall was broken  by the Tower of Antonia, in reality a fortified castle, from which a  subterranean passage led into the inner enclosure where stood the Holy  House. The colonnade or line of porticoes along the south side was  particularly elaborate, and was known as the Royal Porch. Here were  four rows of huge columns, and consequently three corridors, of which  the inner was forty-five feet wide and one hundred feet high, while  each of the side corridors measured thirty feet in width and sixty feet  in height. The imposing effect of the Royal Porch is dwelt upon by  Josephus, who states that its beauty was incredible to those who had  not seen it, and amazing to those who beheld.    The east colonnade or row of porticoes was known as Solomon's  Porch,[87] the name having reference to a tradition that the porch  covered and included part of the original wall erected by the builder  of the first Temple. Within the colonnade was a spacious area, to which  general admission was allowed; this was the Court of the Gentiles. It  was in this court that money-changers and traffickers in animals used  for sacrifice had established their stalls at the time of our Lord's  ministry, and from which {57} they were expelled through His righteous  indignation, the while He declared: \"It is written, My house shall be  called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.\"[88]    Between the Court of the Gentiles and the inner courts rose a wall  twenty-five cubits high; this marked the boundary of the more sacred  precincts within which no Gentile could be lawfully admitted. At  intervals along the wall were inscription tablets, warning all who were  not of Israel to enter not on pain of death. A literal translation  of such inscription reads: \"Let no alien enter within the balustrade  and embankment about the sanctuary. Whoever is caught makes himself  responsible for his death which will follow.\"    The inner courts were accessible from the Court of the Gentiles through  nine gates, of which one was on the east, and four were on the north  and south respectively; as in the earlier Temples the west wall was  without a gate. Of these portals the principal one was on the east;  this was an elaborate structure built of the costly Corinthian brass,  and known as the Corinthian Gate, though sometimes called from the name  of its donor, the Gate of Nicanor; furthermore this is held by many  authorities to be the Beautiful Gate, before which sat the lame man who  was healed through the ministrations of Peter and John.[89]    Part of the space within the inner courts was open to Israelites of  both sexes, and was known distinctively as the Court of the Women.  This was a colonnaded enclosure, and constituted the place of general  assembly in the prescribed course of public worship. Chambers used  for {58} ceremonial purposes occupied the four corners of this court;  and between these and the houses at the gates, were other buildings,  of which one series constituted the Treasury wherein were set  trumpet-shaped receptacles for gifts.[90]    Beyond the Court of the Women and really a continuation thereof, was a  section sufficiently described by its name, the Court of the Men; these  two courts are sometimes referred to as one and designated the Court  of Israel. Within this court were numerous buildings reserved for the  storage of sacred things or devoted to special assemblies. Within and  above the Court of Israel was the Court of the Priests, wherein was  placed the great altar of sacrifice, and to which were admitted none  but duly appointed priests and laymen who came to make offerings. The  altar was a large structure of unhewn stones, forty-seven feet square  at the base, and diminishing upward to the hearth which was a square  of thirty-six feet. The inclined way of approach was on the south  side.[91] A laver or font, reserved for the prescribed ablutions of the  officiating priests, stood nearby on the west.    Within the Court of the Priests, on an elevation reached by twelve  steps, stood the Holy House, the Temple itself. In comparison with  its many and massive outliers, this was a small edifice, but in the  architectural plan it was made the most impressive, if not the most  imposing feature of the whole. It has been properly described as \"a  glittering mass of white marble and gold.\"[92] {"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4524"],[0,"Familiar Letters on Chemistry, and Its Relation to Commerce, Physiology, and (#10)"],[1,"heat does not allow him to  increase the number of respirations by active exercise, and thus to  proportion the waste to the amount of food taken; disease of some  kind, therefore, ensues.    On the other hand, England sends her sick to southern regions, where  the amount of the oxygen inspired is diminished in a very large  proportion. Those whose diseased digestive organs have in a greater  or less degree lost the power of bringing the food into the state  best adapted for oxidation, and therefore are less able to resist  the oxidising influence of the atmosphere of their native climate,  obtain a great improvement in health. The diseased organs of  digestion have power to place the diminished amount of food in  equilibrium with the inspired oxygen, in the mild climate; whilst in  a colder region the organs of respiration themselves would have been  consumed in furnishing the necessary resistance to the action of the  atmospheric oxygen.    In our climate, hepatic diseases, or those arising from excess of  carbon, prevail in summer; in winter, pulmonary diseases, or those  arising from excess of oxygen, are more frequent.    The cooling of the body, by whatever cause it may be produced,  increases the amount of food necessary. The mere exposure to the  open air, in a carriage or on the deck of a ship, by increasing  radiation and vaporisation, increases the loss of heat, and compels  us to eat more than usual. The same is true of those who are  accustomed to drink large quantities of cold water, which is given  off at the temperature of the body, 98 1/2 deg. It increases the  appetite, and persons of weak constitution find it necessary, by  continued exercise, to supply to the system the oxygen required to  restore the heat abstracted by the cold water. Loud and long  continued speaking, the crying of infants, moist air, all exert a  decided and appreciable influence on the amount of food which is  taken.    We have assumed that carbon and hydrogen especially, by combining  with oxygen, serve to produce animal heat. In fact, observation  proves that the hydrogen of the food plays a no less important part  than the carbon.    The whole process of respiration appears most clearly developed,  when we consider the state of a man, or other animal, totally  deprived of food.    The first effect of starvation is the disappearance of fat, and this  fat cannot be traced either in the urine or in the scanty faeces.  Its carbon and hydrogen have been given off through the skin and  lungs in the form of oxidised products; it is obvious that they have  served to support respiration.    In the case of a starving man, 32 1/2 oz. of oxygen enter the system  daily, and are given out again in combination with a part of his  body. Currie mentions the case of an individual who was unable to  swallow, and whose body lost 100 lbs. in weight during a month; and,  according to Martell (Trans. Linn. Soc., vol. xi. p.411), a fat pig,  overwhelmed in a slip of earth, lived 160 days without food, and was  found to have diminished in weight, in that time, more than 120 lbs.  The whole history of hybernating animals, and the well-established  facts of the periodical accumulation, in various animals, of fat,  which, at other periods, entirely disappears, prove that the oxygen,  in the respiratory process, consumes, without exception, all such  substances as are capable of entering into combination with it. It  combines with whatever is presented to it; and the deficiency of  hydrogen is the only reason why carbonic acid is the chief product;  for, at the temperature of the body, the affinity of hydrogen for  oxygen far surpasses that of carbon for the same element.    We know, in fact, that the graminivora expire a volume of carbonic  acid equal to that of the oxygen inspired, while the carnivora, the  only class of animals whose food contains fat, inspire more oxygen  than is equal in volume to the carbonic acid expired. Exact  experiments have shown, that in many cases only half the volume of  oxygen is expired in the form of carbonic acid. These observations  cannot be gainsaid, and are far more convincing than those arbitrary  and artificially produced phenomena, sometimes called experiments;  experiments which, made as too often they are, without regard to the  necessary and natural conditions, possess no value, and may be  entirely dispensed with; especially when, as in the present case,  Nature affords the opportunity for observation, and when we make a  rational use of that opportunity.    In the progress of starvation, however, it is not only the fat which  disappears, but also, by degrees all such of the solids as are  capable of being dissolved. In the wasted bodies of those who have  suffered starvation, the muscles are shrunk and unnaturally soft,  and have lost their contractibility; all those parts of the body  which were capable of entering into the state of motion have served  to protect the remainder of the frame from the destructive influence  of the atmosphere. Towards the end, the particles of the brain begin  to undergo the process of oxidation, and delirium, mania, and death  close the scene; that is to say, all resistance to the oxidising  power of the atmospheric oxygen ceases, and the chemical process of  eremacausis, or decay, commences, in which every part of the body,  the bones excepted, enters into combination with oxygen.    The time which is required to cause death by starvation depends on  the amount of fat in the body, on the degree of exercise, as in  labour or exertion of any kind, on the temperature of the air, and  finally, on the presence or absence of water. Through the skin and  lungs there escapes a certain quantity of water, and as the presence  of water is essential to the continuance of the vital motions, its  dissipation hastens death. Cases have occurred, in which a full  supply of water being accessible to the sufferer, death has not  occurred till after the lapse of twenty days. In one case, life was  sustained in this way for the period of sixty days.    In all chronic diseases death is produced by the same cause, namely,  the chemical action of the atmosphere. When those substances are  wanting, whose function in the organism is to support the process of  respiration, when the diseased organs are incapable of performing  their proper function of producing these substances, when they have  lost the power of transforming the food into that shape in which it  may, by entering into combination with the oxygen of the air,  protect the system from its influence, then, the substance of the  organs themselves, the fat of the body, the substance of the  muscles, the nerves, and the brain, are unavoidably consumed.    The true cause of death in these cases is the respiratory process,  that is, the action of the atmosphere.    A deficiency of food, and a want of power to convert the food into a  part of the organism, are both, equally, a want of resistance; and  this is the negative cause of the cessation of the vital process.  The flame is extinguished, because the oil is consumed; and it is  the oxygen of the air which has consumed it.    In many diseases substances are produced which are incapable of  assimilation. By the mere deprivation of food, these substances are  removed from the body without leaving a trace behind; their elements  have entered into combination with the oxygen of the air.    From the first moment that the function of the lungs or of the skin  is interrupted or disturbed, compounds, rich in carbon, appear in  the urine, which acquires a brown colour. Over the whole surface of  the body oxygen is absorbed, and combines with all the substances  which offer no resistance to it. In those parts of the body where  the access of oxygen is impeded; for example, in the arm-pits, or in  the soles of the feet, peculiar compounds are given out,  recognisable by their appearance, or by their odour. These compounds  contain much carbon.    Respiration is the falling weight--the bent spring, which keeps the  clock in motion; the inspirations and expirations are the strokes of  the pendulum which regulate it. In our ordinary time-pieces, we know  with mathematical accuracy the effect produced on their rate of  going, by changes in the length of the pendulum, or in the external  temperature. Few, however, have a clear conception of the influence  of air and temperature on the health of the human body; and yet the  research into the conditions necessary to keep it in the normal  state is not more difficult than in the case of a clock.          LETTER VIII      My dear Sir,    Having attempted in my last letter to explain to you the simple and  admirable office subserved by the oxygen of the atmosphere in its  combination with carbon in the animal body, I will now proceed to  present you with some remarks upon those materials which sustain its  mechanisms in motion, and keep up their various functions,--namely,  the Aliments.    If the increase in mass in an animal body, the development and  reproduction of its organs depend upon the blood, then those  substances only which are capable of being converted into blood can  be properly regarded as nourishment. In order then to ascertain what  parts of our food are nutritious, we must compare the composition of  the blood with the composition of the various articles taken as  food.    Two substances require especial consideration as the chief  ingredients of the blood; one of these separates immediately from  the blood when it is withdrawn from the circulation.    It is well known that in this case blood coagulates, and separates  into a yellowish liquid, the serum of the blood, and a gelatinous  mass, which adheres to a rod or stick in soft, elastic fibres, when  coagulating blood is briskly stirred. This is the fibrine of the  blood, which is identical in all its properties with muscular fibre,  when the latter is purified from all foreign "]]]
