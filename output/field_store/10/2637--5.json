This antecedent public sentiment is fostered from day to day until it  has unconsciously permeated every corner of the community. The juryman  will swear that he is unaffected by what he has read, but unknown to  himself there are already tiny furrows in his brain along which the  appeal of the defence will run.    In view of this deliberate perversion of truth and morals, the  euphemisms of a hard-put defendant's counsel when he pictures a chorus  girl as an angel and a coarse bounder as a St. George seem innocent  indeed. It is not within the rail of the courtroom but within the pages  of these sensational journals that justice is made a farce. The phrase  \"contempt of court\" has ceased practically to have any significance  whatever. The front pages teem with caricatures of the judge upon the  bench, of the individual jurors with exaggerated heads upon impossible  bodies, of the lawyers ranting and bellowing, juxtaposed with sketches  of the defendant praying beside his prison cot or firing the fatal shot  in obedience to a message borne by an angel from on high.    How long would the \"unwritten law\" play any part in the administration  of criminal justice if every paper in the land united in demanding, not  only in its editorials, but upon its front pages, that private vengeance  must cease? Let the \"yellow\" newspapers confine themselves simply to  an accurate report of the evidence at the trial, with a reiterated  insistence that the law must take its course. Let them stop pandering  to those morbid tastes which they have themselves created. Let the  \"Sympathy Sisters,\" the photographer, and the special artist be excluded  from the court-room. When these things are done, we shall have the same  high standard of efficiency upon the part of the jury in great murder  trials that we have in other cases.        CHAPTER IV. Why Do Men Kill?      When a shrewd but genial editor called me up on the telephone and asked  me how I should like to write an article on the above lurid title, I  laughed in his--I mean the telephone's face.    \"My dear fellow!\" I said (I should only have the nerve to call him that  over a wire). \"It would ruin me! How could I keep my self-respect and  write that kind of sensational stuff--Why do men kill? Why do men eat?  Why do men drink? Why do men love? Why do men--\"    \"Look here!\" he interrupted. \"I want to know why one man kills another  man. If we knew why, maybe we could stop it, couldn't we? We could try  to, anyhow. And you know something about it. You've prosecuted nearly  a hundred men for murder. Get the facts--that's what I want. Cut  the adjectives and morality, and get down to the reasons. Anything  particularly undignified about that?\" And he rang off.    I arose and walked over to the bookcase on which reposed several  shelves of \"minutes\" of criminal trials. They were dusty and depressing.  Practically every one of them was a memento of some poor devil gone to  prison or to the chair. Where were they now--and why did they kill--yes,  why DID they?    I glanced along the red-labeled backs.    \"People versus Candido.\" Now why did HE kill? I remembered the Italian  perfectly. He killed his friend because the latter had been too  attentive to his wife. \"People versus Higgins.\" Why did he? That was  a drunken row on a New Year's Eve within the sound of Trinity chimes.  \"People versus Sterling Greene.\" Yes, he was a colored man--I recalled  the evidence--drink and a \"yellow gal.\" \"People versus Mock Duck\"-a  Chinese feud between the On Leong Tong and the Hip Sing Tong--a  vendetta, first one Chink shot and then another, turn and turn about,  running back through Mott Street, New York, Boston, San Francisco, until  the origin of the quarrel was lost in the dim Celestial mists across  the sea. Out of the first four cases the following motives: Jealousy--1.  Drink--1. Drink and jealousy--1. Scattering (how can you term a \"Tong\"  row?)--1.    I began to get interested. Supposing I dug out all the homicide cases I  had ever tried, what would the result show as to motive for the killing?  Would drink and women account for seventy-five per cent? Mentally I ran  my eye back over nearly ten years. What OTHER motives had the defendants  at the bar had? There was Laudiero--an Italian \"Camorrista\"--he had  killed simply for the distinction it gave him among his countrymen  and the satisfaction he felt at being known as a \"bad\" man--a \"capo  maestra.\" There was Joseph Ferrone--pure jealousy again. Hendry--animal  hate intensified by drink. Yoscow--a deliberate murder, planned in  advance by several of a gang, to get rid of a young bully who had made  himself generally unpleasant. There was Childs, who had killed, as he  claimed, in self-defence because he was set upon and assaulted by rival  runners from another seaman's boarding house. Really it began to look as  if men killed for a lot of reasons.    One consideration at once suggested itself. How about the killings where  the murderer is never caught? The prisoners tried for murder are only a  mere fraction of those who commit murder. True, and the more deliberate  the murder, the greater, unfortunately, the chance of the villain  getting away. Still, in cases merely of suspected murder, or in cases  where no evidence is taken, it would be manifestly unfair arbitrarily to  assign motives for the deed, if deed it was. No, one must start with the  assumption, sufficiently accurate under all the circumstances, that  the killings in which the killer is caught are fairly representative of  killings as a whole.    All crimes naturally tend to divide themselves into two classes--crimes  against property and crimes against the person, each class having an  entirely different assortment of reasons for their commission.    There can be practically but one motive for theft, burglary, or robbery.  It is, of course, conceivable that such crimes might be perpetrated for  revenge--to deprive the victim of some highly prized possession. But in  the main there is only one object--unlawful gain. So, too, blackmail,  extortion, and kidnapping are all the products of the desire for  \"easy money.\" But, unquestionably, this is the reason for murder in  comparatively few cases.    The usual motive for crimes against the person--assault, manslaughter,  mayhem, murder, etc.--is the desire to punish, or be avenged upon  another by inflicting personal pain upon him or by depriving him of his  most valuable asset--life. And this desire for retaliation or revenge  generally grows out of a recent humiliation received at the hands of  the other person, a real or fancied wrong to oneself, a member of  one's family, or one's property. But this was too easy an answer to my  friend's question. He wanted and deserved more than that, and I set out  to give it to him.    My first inquiry was in the direction of original sources. I sought out  the man in the district attorney's office who had had the widest general  experience and put the question to him. This was Mr. Charles C. Nott,  Jr., (now judge of the General Sessions) who had been trying murder  cases for nearly ten years. It so happened that he had kept a complete  record of all of them and this he courteously placed at my disposal. The  list contains sixty-two cases, and the defendants were of divers races.  These homicides included seventeen committed in cold blood (about  twenty-five per cent, an extraordinary percentage) from varying motives,  as follows: One defendant (white) murdered his colored mistress simply  to get rid of her; another killed out of revenge because the deceased  had \"licked\" him several times before; another, having quarrelled  with his friend over a glass of soda water, later on returned and  precipitated a quarrel by striking him, in the course of which he killed  him; another because the deceased had induced his wife to desert him;  another lay in wait for his victim and killed him without the motive  ever being ascertained; one man killed his brother to get a sum of  money, and another because his brother would not give him money; another  because he believed the deceased had betrayed the Armenian cause to the  Turks; another because he wished to get the deceased out of the way in  order to marry his wife; and another because deceased had knocked him  down the day before. One man had killed a girl who had ridiculed him;  and one a girl who had refused to marry him; another had killed his  daughter because she could no longer live in the house with him; one, an  informer, had been the victim of a Black Hand vendetta; and the last  had poisoned his wife for the insurance money in order to go off with  another woman. There were two cases of infanticide, one in which a woman  threw her baby into the lake in Central Park, and another in which she  gave her baby poison. Besides these murders, five homicides had been  committed in the course of perpetrating other crimes, including burglary  and robbery.    Passing over three cases of culpable negligence resulting in death, we  come to thirty-seven homicides during quarrels, some of which might have  been technically classified as murders, but which being committed  \"in the heat of passion,\" in practically every instance resulted in a  verdict of manslaughter. The quarrels often arose over the most trifling  matters. One was a dispute over a broom, another over a horse blanket,  another over food, another over a twenty-five cent bet in a pool game,  another over a loan of fifty cents, another over ten cents in a crap  game, and still another over one dollar and thirty cents in a crap game.  Five men were killed in drunken rows which had no immediate cause except  the desire to \"start something.\" One man killed another because he had  not prevented the theft of some lumber, one (a policeman) because the  deceased would not \"move on\" when ordered, one because a bartender  refused to serve him with any more"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52819"],[0,"Defense of the Faith and the Saints (Volume 2 of 2) (#10)"],[1,"which transpired  on his way to his future Ohio home, which occurrence furnishes the  key to his first connection with Mormonism. On his way he stopped at  a humble cottage, the name of whose occupant he carefully fails to  give. Here, while asleep (so he says), \"a messenger of a mild and  intelligent countenance suddenly stood before me [Pratt], arrayed in  robes of dazzling splendor.\" According to Mormon theology, an angel  is but an exalted man. [99] Of course Sidney Rigdon was an exalted  man; why not, then, an angel? This angel claimed to hold the keys  to the mysteries of this wonderful country, and took Pratt out to  exhibit those mysteries to him. Pratt then had portrayed to his mind  the whole future of Mormonism; its cities, with inhabitants from all  parts of the globe; its temples, with a yet unattained splendor;  its present church organization was, with considerable definiteness  outlined; its political ambition to establish a temporal kingdom of  God on the ruins of this government was set forth with quite as much  definiteness as in the subsequent more publicly uttered, treasonable  sermons. [100] I conclude from the exact manner in which this \"Angel of  the Prairies\" foreknew the ambitions, hopes, and future achievements  of the Mormon Church and the similar admitted foreknowledge of Rigdon  and the subsequently established connection between Rigdon, Pratt, and  Smith, that the \"Angel of the Prairies\" who outlined to Pratt his then  contemplated and now executed religious fraud, was none other than  Sidney Rigdon himself, and that this fact accounts for Pratt's failure  to give the name of his host or the date of his first meeting with  Rigdon. [101]    [Footnote 97: \"History of the Church,\" 149-150. (\"Josephite\".)]    [Footnote 98: \"4 _Times and Seasons_,\" 209. Supplement 14, _Millennial  Star,_ 45.]    [Footnote 99: See Text for foot-notes, Nos. 106 to 109 herein. 6  _Millennial Star_, 20. \"History of Mormonism,\" 154.]    [Footnote 101: 20 _Millennial Star_, 33-36. _7 Deseret News_, 288-9. _7  Journal of Discourses_, 53. _1 Journal of Discourses_, 230, and Sermons  generally of this period. See also _Am. Hist. Mag._, July, 1906.]    Lambdin, who, by some, has been suspected of once having been Rigdon's  partner in the contemplated fraud, died Aug. 1, 1825. Engles,  Patterson's foreman, died July 17, 1827. Spaulding had died in 1816,  and Robert Patterson, it seems, knew nothing personally of the contents  of the Spaulding manuscript, [102] which fact Rigdon probably well knew  through his intimate acquaintance with Lambdin. In September of 1827  the time was, therefore, as ripe as it was ever likely to be for active  preparation in the matter of bringing forth the \"Book of Mormon,\" since  probably all those having any intimate knowledge of the \"Manuscript  Found\" had conveniently died.    [Footnote 102: \"Mormonism Exposed,\" by Williams. \"Who Wrote the Book of  Mormon?\" 7.]    In 1827 Pratt started back to New York for the purpose of getting  married. Now, remember, this was nearly three years before the advent  of Mormonism. Pratt reached the home of his aunt Van Cote July 4, 1827,  and in his autobiography records a summary of a conversation with his  future wife thus: \"I also opened my religious views to her and my  desire, which I sometimes had, to try and teach the red man.\" [103] In  October, 1830, within a month after Pratt's professed conversion to  Mormonism, a revelation was received for Pratt, in which the Lord,  through \"Joseph Smith, the Prophet,\" directed Pratt to carry out this  very design. [104] The desire which Pratt thus expressed to his wife  three years before the advent of Mormonism was afterward and for a  long time the pet scheme of all Mormons. Pratt was married September  9, 1827. [105] On September 22, 1827, a \"heavenly messenger\" appeared  to Joseph Smith and unfolded to him the scheme of the Book of Mormon,  and disclosed the whereabouts of the \"Golden Plates.\" [106] This  \"heavenly messenger\" is called the Angel Moroni. According to Mormon  theology, \"God may use any beings he has made or that he pleases, and  call them his angels, or messengers.\" [107] \"God's angels and men are  all of one species, one race, one great family.\" [108] \"God is a man  like unto yourselves; that is the great secret.\" [109] Why, of course!  \"That is the great secret.\" God is but an \"exalted man,\" and may call  Parley Parker Pratt his angel. Parley Parker Pratt was the \"heavenly  messenger,\" the angel who, on that day (September 22, 1827), appeared  to Joseph Smith and told him where were the golden plates, that is,  Spaulding's \"Manuscript Found.\" Sidney Rigdon, for Smith's purposes,  was the \"exalted man,\" the \"God\" who sent this \"heavenly messenger\"  Parley Parker Pratt, just as the Mormon people now look upon Joseph  Smith as the \"God to this people.\" [110] Now, watch the sequel, and no  doubt can remain.    [Footnote 103: Pages 29 and 30.]    [Footnote 104: Section 32, Doctrine and Covenants. Smith's God was,  however, unfamiliar with governmental regulations of Indian affairs,  so in spite of the revelation Pratt and Company were compelled by the  United States Indian agent to leave the reservation. 5 _Journal of  Discourses,_ 199.

Those most familiar with the psychology of dreams and the  influence over them had by the experiences of waking life, will give  considerable evidentiary weight to a dream of the prophet's father,  in which there appeared to him a \"man with a peddler's budget on his  back,\" such a peddler P. P. Pratt probably carried. This peddler of  his dreams flattered him, told him he had called seven times and this  last call had come to tell him what was the one thing essential to his  salvation, and then he awoke. (\"Joseph Smith, the Prophet,\" 74.)]    September 9, 1827, Pratt was married. On September 22, 1827, he was the  angel who appeared to Smith, and in October he started back to Ohio,  the home of Rigdon. [111] Rigdon is now brought again upon the scene. He  preaches in Pratt's neighborhood, converts him, the latter commences  preaching, [112] evidently preparing for his part in the drama about to  be enacted.    [Footnote 111: \"Autobiography of P.P. Pratt,\" 30.]    [Footnote 112: \"Autobiography of P.P. Pratt,\" 31-33.]    RIGDON VISITS SMITH BEFORE MORMONISM.    The work of revising the Spaulding manuscript, or, as \"Holy Joe\" calls  it, the \"Translation of the Golden Plates,\" is begun. A mysterious  stranger now appears at Smith's residence and holds private interviews  with the far-famed money-digger. For a considerable length of time no  intimation of the name or the purpose of this personage transpired to  the public, or even to Smith's nearest neighbors. It was observed by  some of them that his visits were frequently repeated. [113] At about  this time Rigdon is away from his Ohio home on several long visits,  reporting himself as having gone to Pittsburg. [114]    [Footnote 113: \"Origin and Progress of Mormonism,\" 28. The author  was a native of Palmyra and read proof on the Book of Mormon. \"Hand  Book of Mormonism,\" 3. This author lived thirty-two years in Palmyra.  Braden-Kelly Debate, 46. Mother Lucy in \"Joseph Smith, the Prophet,\"  pp. 119, 120, 121, gives an account of a mysterious and unnamed  \"stranger\" who came to their home with Joe at the time Harris had  lost some of the manuscript of the Book of Mormon. As a mere matter  of kindness this \"stranger\" forced upon the \"Prophet\" his company for  a twenty mile walk through the woods at night, left a stage coach and  went out of his way to do it, and attended the interview with Harris  next day. An opportune time was this for Rigdon's presence.

See also the  pointed statement of L. Rudolph, father-in-law to President Garfield,  quoted in Braden-Kelly Debate, 45.]    Abel Chase, a near neighbor of the Smiths, says: \"I saw Rigdon at  Smith's at different times with considerable intervals between.\"  Lorenzo Saunders, another neighbor, testifies: \"I saw Rigdon at Smith's  several times, and the first visit was more than two years before the  Book appeared.\" J. H. McCauley, in his history of Franklin County,  Pa., states \"as a matter too well known to need argument, that Joseph  Smith, the founder of Mormonism, and Sidney Rigdon were acquainted for  a considerable time before Mormonism was first heard of.\" [115]    [Footnote 115: See Braden-Kelly Debate, 46, for three last statements.  Tucker in his \"Origin and Progress of Mormonism,\" p. 50, says Rigdon  officiated at the wedding of Joseph Smith and Emma Hale, but he fixes  date of wedding in November, 1829, when in fact it seems to have  occurred January 18, 1828. (_Historical Record_, 363.) Tucker may  therefore have been misinformed. An alleged admission of Sidney Rigdon  to James Jeffries that Spaulding's story was used, which is quoted in  Braden-Kelly Debate, 42, I consider of doubtful value.]    I have been able to find but one specific denial of Rigdon's  acquaintance with Smith prior to the appearance of the Book of Mormon.  That denial comes from Katherine Salisbury, a sister of the \"Prophet  Joseph,\" and is dated April 15, 1881, when she was nearly 68 years of  age. She says that        \"Prior to the latter part of the year A. D. 1830, there was no      person who visited with, or"]]]
