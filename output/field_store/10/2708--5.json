It was an  advantage that nobody took the least interest in his goings and  comings.    Having moored his boat and proceeded to the inn, he was directed  upstairs by the landlord, who was an enlarged and coloured edition of  his brother. From the other side of the gymnasium door came an  unceasing and mysterious shuffling sound.    He tapped at the door and went in.    He found himself in a large, airy room, lit by two windows and a broad  skylight. The floor was covered with linoleum. But it was the furniture  that first attracted his attention. In a farther corner of the room was  a circular wooden ceiling, supported by four narrow pillars. From the  centre of this hung a ball, about the size of an ordinary football. To  the left, suspended from a beam, was an enormous leather bolster. On  the floor, underneath a table bearing several pairs of boxing-gloves, a  skipping-rope, and some wooden dumb-bells, was something that looked  like a dozen Association footballs rolled into one. All the rest of the  room, a space some few yards square, was bare of furniture. In this  space a small sweater-clad youth, with a head of light hair cropped  very short, was darting about and ducking and hitting out with both  hands at nothing, with such a serious, earnest expression on his face  that Sheen could not help smiling. On a chair by one of the windows Mr  Joe Bevan was sitting, with a watch in his hand.    As Sheen entered the room the earnest young man made a sudden dash at  him. The next moment he seemed to be in a sort of heavy shower of  fists. They whizzed past his ear, flashed up from below within an inch  of his nose, and tapped him caressingly on the waistcoat. Just as the  shower was at its heaviest his assailant darted away again,  side-stepped an imaginary blow, ducked another, and came at him once  more. None of the blows struck him, but it was with more than a little  pleasure that he heard Joe Bevan call \"Time!\" and saw the active young  gentleman sink panting into a seat.    \"You and your games, Francis!\" said Joe Bevan, reproachfully. \"This is  a young gentleman from the college come for tuition.\"    \"Gentleman--won't mind--little joke--take it in spirit which  is--meant,\" said Francis, jerkily.    Sheen hastened to assure him that he had not been offended.    \"You take your two minutes, Francis,\" said Mr Bevan, \"and then have a  turn with the ball. Come this way, Mr--\"    \"Sheen.\"    \"Come this way, Mr Sheen, and I'll show you where to put on your  things.\"    Sheen had brought his football clothes with him. He had not put them on  for a year.    \"That's the lad I was speaking of. Getting on prime, he is. Fit to  fight for his life, as the saying is.\"    \"What was he doing when I came in?\"    \"Oh, he always has three rounds like that every day. It teaches you to  get about quick. You try it when you get back, Mr Sheen. Fancy you're  fighting me.\"    \"Are you sure I'm not interrupting you in the middle of your work?\"  asked Sheen.    \"Not at all, sir, not at all. I just have to rub him down, and give him  his shower-bath, and then he's finished for the day.\"    Having donned his football clothes and returned to the gymnasium, Sheen  found Francis in a chair, having his left leg vigorously rubbed by Mr  Bevan.    \"You fon' of dargs?\" inquired Francis affably, looking up as he came  in.    Sheen replied that he was, and, indeed, was possessed of one. The  admission stimulated Francis, whose right leg was now under treatment,  to a flood of conversation. He, it appeared, had always been one for  dargs. Owned two. Answering to the names of Tim and Tom. Beggars for  rats, yes. And plucked 'uns? Well--he would like to see, would Francis,  a dog that Tim or Tom would not stand up to. Clever, too. Why once--    Joe Bevan cut his soliloquy short at this point by leading him off to  another room for his shower-bath; but before he went he expressed a  desire to talk further with Sheen on the subject of dogs, and, learning  that Sheen would be there every day, said he was glad to hear it. He  added that for a brother dog-lover he did not mind stretching a point,  so that, if ever Sheen wanted a couple of rounds any day, he, Francis,  would see that he got them. This offer, it may be mentioned, Sheen  accepted with gratitude, and the extra practice he acquired thereby was  subsequently of the utmost use to him. Francis, as a boxer, excelled in  what is known in pugilistic circles as shiftiness. That is to say, he  had a number of ingenious ways of escaping out of tight corners; and  these he taught Sheen, much to the latter's profit.    But this was later, when the Wrykinian had passed those preliminary  stages on which he was now to embark.    The art of teaching boxing really well is a gift, and it is given to  but a few. It is largely a matter of personal magnetism, and, above  all, sympathy. A man may be a fine boxer himself, up to every move of  the game, and a champion of champions, but for all that he may not be a  good teacher. If he has not the sympathy necessary for the appreciation  of the difficulties experienced by the beginner, he cannot produce good  results. A boxing instructor needs three qualities--skill, sympathy,  and enthusiasm. Joe Bevan had all three, particularly enthusiasm. His  heart was in his work, and he carried Sheen with him. \"Beautiful, sir,  beautiful,\" he kept saying, as he guarded the blows; and Sheen, though  too clever to be wholly deceived by the praise, for he knew perfectly  well that his efforts up to the present had been anything but  beautiful, was nevertheless encouraged, and put all he knew into his  hits. Occasionally Joe Bevan would push out his left glove. Then, if  Sheen's guard was in the proper place and the push did not reach its  destination, Joe would mutter a word of praise. If Sheen dropped his  right hand, so that he failed to stop the blow, Bevan would observe,  \"Keep that guard up, sir!\" with almost a pained intonation, as if he  had been disappointed in a friend.    The constant repetition of this maxim gradually drove it into Sheen's  head, so that towards the end of the lesson he no longer lowered his  right hand when he led with his left; and he felt the gentle pressure  of Joe Bevan's glove less frequently. At no stage of a pupil's  education did Joe Bevan hit him really hard, and in the first few  lessons he could scarcely be said to hit him at all. He merely rested  his glove against the pupil's face. On the other hand, he was urgent in  imploring the pupil to hit _him_ as hard as he could.    \"Don't be too kind, sir,\" he would chant, \"I don't mind being hit. Let  me have it. Don't flap. Put it in with some weight behind it.\" He was  also fond of mentioning that extract from Polonius' speech to Laertes,  which he had quoted to Sheen on their first meeting.    Sheen finished his first lesson, feeling hotter than he had ever felt  in his life.    \"Hullo, sir, you're out of condition,\" commented Mr Bevan. \"Have a bit  of a rest.\"    Once more Sheen had learnt the lesson of his weakness. He could hardly  realise that he had only begun to despise himself in the last  fortnight. Before then, he had been, on the whole, satisfied with  himself. He was brilliant at work, and would certainly get a  scholarship at Oxford or Cambridge when the time came; and he had  specialised in work to the exclusion of games. It is bad to specialise  in games to the exclusion of work, but of the two courses the latter is  probably the less injurious. One gains at least health by it.    But Sheen now understood thoroughly, what he ought to have learned from  his study of the Classics, that the happy mean was the thing at which  to strive. And for the future he meant to aim at it. He would get the  Gotford, if he could, but also would he win the house boxing at his  weight.    After he had rested he discovered the use of the big ball beneath the  table. It was soft, but solid and heavy. By throwing this--the  medicine-ball, as they call it in the profession--at Joe Bevan, and  catching it, Sheen made himself very hot again, and did the muscles of  his shoulders a great deal of good.    \"That'll do for today, then, sir,\" said Joe Bevan. \"Have a good rub  down tonight, or you'll find yourself very stiff in the morning.\"    \"Well, do you think I shall be any good?\" asked Sheen.    \"You'll do fine, sir. But remember what Shakespeare says.\"    \"About vaulting ambition?\"    \"No, sir, no. I meant what Hamlet says to the players. 'Nor do not saw  the air too much, with your hand, thus, but use all gently.' That's  what you've got to remember in boxing, sir. Take it easy. Easy and cool  does it, and the straight left beats the world.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Sheen paddled quietly back to the town with the stream, pondering over  this advice. He felt that he had advanced another step. He was not  foolish enough to believe that he knew anything about boxing as yet,  but he felt that it would not be long before he did.          X    SHEEN'S PROGRESS      Sheen improved. He took to boxing as he had taken to fives. He found  that his fives helped him. He could get about on his feet quickly, and  his eye was trained to rapid work.    His second lesson was not encouraging. He found that he had learned  just enough to make him stiff and awkward, and no more. But he kept on,  and by the end of the first week Joe Bevan declared definitely that he  would do, that he had the root of the matter in him, and now required  only practice.    \"I wish you could see like I can how you're improving,\" he said at the  end of the sixth lesson, as they were resting after five minutes'  exercise with the medicine-ball. \"I get four blows in on some of the  gentlemen I teach to one what I get in on you. But it's like riding.  When you can trot, you look forward to when you can gallop.

X    JEAN BAPTISTE CAMILLE COROT        (Pronounced Zhahn Bah-teest' Cah-mee'yel Coh'roh)    _Fontainebleau-Barbizon School_    1796-1875    _Pupil of Michallon_    About three hundred years before Corot's time there was a  Fontainebleau school of artists, made up of the pathetic Andrea del  Sarto, the wonderful Leonardo da Vinci, and Cellini. These painters  had been summoned from their Italian homes by Francis I., to decorate  the Palace of Fontainebleau. The second great group of painters who  had studios in the forest and beside the stream were Rousseau, Dupre,  Diaz, and Daubigny; Troyon, Van Marcke, Jacque; then Millet, the  painter of peasants.    Corot was born in Paris and received what education the ordinary  school at Rouen could give him. He was intended by his parents for  something besides art, as it would seem that every artist in the world  was intended. Corot was to grow up and become a respectable draper; at  any rate a draper.    The young chap did as his father wished, until he was twenty-six years  old, and dreary years those must have been to him. He did not get on  well with his master, nor did the world treat him very well. He found  neither riches nor the fame that was his due till he was an old man of  seventy. At that age he had become as rich a man as he might have been  had he remained a sensible draper.    Best of all, Corot loved to paint clouds and dewy nights, pale moons  and early day, and of all amusements in the world, he preferred the  theatre. There he would sit; gay or sad as the play might make him,  weeping or laughing and as interested as a little child.    After he had anything to give away, Corot was the most madly generous  of men. It was he who gave a pension to the widow of his brother  artist, Millet, on which she lived all the rest of her days. He gave  money to his brother painters and to all who went to him for aid; and  he always gave gaily, freely, as if giving were the greatest joy,  outside of the theatre, a man could have. Everyone who knew him loved  him, and there was no note of sadness in his daily life, though there  seems to be one in his poetical pictures. Because of his generous ways  he was known as \"Pere Corot.\" He sang as he worked, and loved his  fellowmen all the time; but most of all, he loved his sister.    \"Rousseau is an eagle,\" he used to say in speaking of his fellow  artist. \"As for me, I am only a lark, putting forth some little songs  in my gray clouds.\"    It has been noted that most great landscape painters have been  city-bred, a remarkable fact. Constable and Gainsborough were born and  bred in the country, but they are exceptions to the rule. Corot's  parents were Parisians of the purest dye, having been court-dressmakers  to Napoleon I.; and when Corot finally determined to leave the  draper's shop and become a painter, his father said: \"You shall  have a yearly allowance of 1,200 francs, and if you can live on that,  you can do as you please.\" When his son was made a member of the  Legion of Honour, after twenty-three years of earnest work, his father  thought the matter over, and presently doubled the allowance, \"for  Camille seems to have some talent after all,\" he remarked as an excuse  for his generosity.    It is told that when he first went to study in Italy, Corot longed to  transfer the moving scenes before him to canvas; but people moved too  quickly for him, so he methodically set about learning how to do with  a few strokes what he would otherwise have laboured over. So he  reduced his sketching to such a science that he became able to sketch  a ballet in full movement; and it is remarked that this practice  trained him for presenting the tremulousness of leaves of trees, which  he did so exquisitely.    One learns something of this painter of early dawn and soft evening  from a letter he wrote to his friend Dupre:    One gets up at three in the morning, before the sun; one goes and sits  at the foot of a tree; one watches and waits. One sees nothing much at  first. Nature resembles a whitish canvas on which are sketched  scarcely the profiles of some masses; everything is perfumed, and  shines in the fresh breath of dawn. Bing! the sun grows bright but has  not yet torn aside the veil behind which lie concealed the meadows,  the dale, and hills of the horizon. The vapours of night still creep,  like silvery flakes over the numbed-green vegetation. Bing! bing!--a  first ray of sunlight--a second ray of sunlight--the little flowers  seem to wake up joyously. They all have their drop of dew which  trembles--the chilly leaves are stirred with the breath of morning--in  the foliage the birds sing unseen--all the flowers seem to be saying  their prayers. Loves on butterfly wings frolic over the meadows and  make the tall plants wave--one sees nothing--yet everything is  there--the landscape is entirely behind the veil of mist, which  mounts, mounts, sucked up by the sun; and as it rises, reveals the  river, plated with silver, the meadow, the trees, cottages, the  receding distance--one distinguishes at last everything that one had  divined at first.    In all the world there can hardly be a more exquisite story of  daybreak than this; and so beautiful was the mood into which Corot  fell at eventime, as he himself describes it, that it would be a  mistake to leave it out. This is his story of the night:    Nature drowses--the fresh air, however, sighs among the leaves--the  dew decks the velvety grass with pearls. The nymphs fly--hide  themselves--and desire to be seen. Bing! a star in the sky which  pricks its image on the pool. Charming star--whose brilliance is  increased by the quivering of the water, thou watchest me--thou  smilest to me with half-closed eye! Bing!--a second star appears in  the water, a second eye opens. Be the harbingers of welcome, fresh and  charming stars. Bing! Bing! Bing!--three, six, twenty stars. All the  stars in the sky are keeping tryst in this happy pool. Everything  darkens, the pool alone sparkles. There is a swarm of stars--all  yields to illusion. The sun being gone to bed, the inner sun of the  soul, the sun of art awakens. Bon! there is my picture done!    In writing those letters, Corot made literature as well as  pictures. That little word \"bing!\" appears also in his paintings, as  little leaves or bits of tree-trunk, some small detail which,  high-lightened, accents the whole.      PLATE--DANCE OF THE NYMPHS    There could hardly be a more charming painting than this which hangs  in the Louvre. It is of a half-shut-in landscape of tall trees, their  branches mingling; and all the atmospheric effects that belong to  Corot's work can here be seen.    On the open greensward is a group of nymphs dancing gaily, while over  all the scene is the veil of fairy-land or of something quite  mysterious. At the back and side, satyrs can be seen watching the  nymphs. There is here less of the blur of leaves than that seen in  later pictures, but the same soft effect is found, and the little  \"bings\" are the accents of light placed upon a leaf, a nymph's  shoulder, or a tree-trunk.    This picture was painted in 1851, when Corot had not yet developed  that style which was to mark all his later work.    Besides this picture he painted \"Paysage,\" \"The Bathers\" \"Ville  d'Arvay,\" \"Willows near Arras,\" \"The Bent Tree,\" \"A Gust of Wind,\" and  others.          XI    CORREGGIO (ANTONIO ALLEGRI)        (Pronounced Cor-rage'jyo Ahl-lay'gree)    _School of Parma_    1494(?)-1534    _Pupil of Mantegna_    When Correggio was a little boy, he lived in the odour of spices,  which were kept upon his father's shop-shelves. He was a highly-spiced  little boy and man, although the most timid and shrinking. His  imagination was the liveliest possible.    The spice merchant lived in the town of Correggio, and thus the artist  got his name. Correggio knew what should be inside the lovely flesh of  his painted figures before he began to paint them, because he studied  anatomy in a truly scientific manner before he studied painting.  Probably no other artist up to that time, had ever begun with the bare  bones of his models, but Correggio may be said to have worked from the  inside out. He learned about the structure of the human frame from  Dr. Giovanni Battista Lombardi, and showed his gratitude to his  teacher by painting a picture \"Il Medico del Correggio\" (Correggio's  Physician), and presenting it to Doctor Lombardi.    Now Correggio's childhood, or at least his early manhood, could not  have been spent in poverty, because it is known that he used the most  expensive colours to paint with, painted upon the finest of canvas,  while greater artists had often to be content with boards. He also  painted upon copper plates, and it is said that he hired Begarelli, a  sculptor of much fame, to make models in relief for him to copy for  the pictures he painted on the cupolas of the churches in Parma. That  sculptor's services must have been expensive.    On the lovely island of Capri, in the Franciscan convent, will be  found one of his first pictures, painted when Correggio was about  nineteen years old.    He was highly original in many ways. Although he had never seen the  work of any great artist, he painted the most extraordinary  fore-shortened pictures; and fore-shortening was a technicality in art  then uncommon. He also was the first to paint church cupolas.  Fore-shortening produces some peculiar as well as great results, and  being a feature of art with which people were not then familiar,  Correggio's work did not go uncriticised. Indeed one artist, gazing up  into one of the cupolas where Correggio's fore-shortened figures were  placed, remarked that to him it appeared a \"hash of frogs.\"    But when Titian saw that cupola, he said: \"Reverse the cupola, fill it  with gold, and even then that will not be its "]]]
