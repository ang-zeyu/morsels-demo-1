Poetry  had not as yet become the adversary of wit, nor had speculation abused  itself by passing into quibbling. In cases of necessity both poetry and  wit could exchange parts, because they both honored truth only in their  special way. However high might be the flight of reason, it drew matter  in a loving spirit after it, and while sharply and stiffly defining it,  never mutilated what it touched. It is true the Greek mind displaced  humanity, and recast it on a magnified scale in the glorious circle of  its gods; but it did this not by dissecting human nature, but by giving  it fresh combinations, for the whole of human nature was represented in  each of the gods. How different is the course followed by us moderns!  We also displace and magnify individuals to form the image of the  species, but we do this in a fragmentary way, not by altered  combinations, so that it is necessary to gather up from different  individuals the elements that form the species in its totality. It would  almost appear as if the powers of mind express themselves with us in real  life or empirically as separately as the psychologist distinguishes them  in the representation. For we see not only individual subjects, but  whole classes of men, uphold their capacities only in part, while the  rest of their faculties scarcely show a germ of activity, as in the case  of the stunted growth of plants.    I do not overlook the advantages to which the present race, regarded as a  unity and in the balance of the understanding, may lay claim over what is  best in the ancient world; but it is obliged to engage in the contest as  a compact mass, and measure itself as a whole against a whole. Who among  the moderns could step forth, man against man, and strive with an  Athenian for the prize of higher humanity.    Whence comes this disadvantageous relation of individuals coupled with  great advantages of the race? Why could the individual Greek be  qualified as the type of his time; and why can no modern dare to offer  himself as such? Because all-uniting nature imparted its forms to the  Greek, and an all-dividing understanding gives our forms to us.    It was culture itself that gave these wounds to modern humanity. The  inner union of human nature was broken, and a destructive contest divided  its harmonious forces directly; on the one hand, an enlarged experience  and a more distinct thinking necessitated a sharper separation of the  sciences, while, on the other hand, the more complicated machinery of  states necessitated a stricter sundering of ranks and occupations.  Intuitive and speculative understanding took up a hostile attitude in  opposite fields, whose borders were guarded with jealousy and distrust;  and by limiting its operation to a narrow sphere, men have made unto  themselves a master who is wont not unfrequently to end by subduing and  oppressing all the other faculties. Whilst on the one hand a luxuriant  imagination creates ravages in the plantations that have cost the  intelligence so much labor; on the other hand, a spirit of abstraction  suffocates the fire that might have warmed the heart and inflamed the  imagination.    This subversion, commenced by art and learning in the inner man, was  carried out to fulness and finished by the spirit of innovation in  government. It was, no doubt, reasonable to expect that the simple  organization of the primitive republics should survive the quaintness of  primitive manners and of the relations of antiquity. But, instead of  rising to a higher and nobler degree of animal life, this organization  degenerated into a common and coarse mechanism. The zoophyte condition  of the Grecian states, where each individual enjoyed an independent life,  and could, in cases of necessity, become a separate whole and unit in  himself, gave way to an ingenious mechanism, when, from the splitting up  into numberless parts, there results a mechanical life in the  combination. Then there was a rupture between the state and the church,  between laws and customs; enjoyment was separated from labor, the means  from the end, the effort from the reward. Man himself, eternally chained  down to a little fragment of the whole, only forms a kind of fragment;  having nothing in his ears but the monotonous sound of the perpetually  revolving wheel, he never develops the harmony of his being, and instead  of imprinting the seal of humanity on his being, he ends by being nothing  more than the living impress of the craft to which he devotes himself, of  the science that he cultivates. This very partial and paltry relation,  linking the isolated members to the whole, does not depend on forms that  are given spontaneously; for how could a complicated machine, which shuns  the light, confide itself to the free will of man? This relation is  rather dictated, with a rigorous strictness, by a formulary in which the  free intelligence of man is chained down. The dead letter takes the  place of a living meaning, and a practised memory becomes a safer guide  than genius and feeling.    If the community or state measures man by his function, only asking of  its citizens memory, or the intelligence of a craftsman, or mechanical  skill, we cannot be surprised that the other faculties of the mind are  neglected for the exclusive culture of the one that brings in honor and  profit. Such is the necessary result of an organization that is  indifferent about character, only looking to acquirements, whilst in  other cases it tolerates the thickest darkness, to favor a spirit of law  and order; it must result if it wishes that individuals in the exercise  of special aptitudes should gain in depth what they are permitted to lose  in extension. We are aware, no doubt, that a powerful genius does not  shut up its activity within the limits of its functions; but mediocre  talents consume in the craft fallen to their lot the whole of their  feeble energy; and if some of their energy is reserved for matters of  preference, without prejudice to its functions, such a state of things at  once bespeaks a spirit soaring above the vulgar. Moreover, it is rarely  a recommendation in the eye of a state to have a capacity superior to  your employment, or one of those noble intellectual cravings of a man of  talent which contend in rivalry with the duties of office. The state is  so jealous of the exclusive possession of its servants that it would  prefer--nor can it be blamed in this--for functionaries to show their  powers with the Venus of Cytherea rather than the Uranian Venus.    It is thus that concrete individual life is extinguished, in order that  the abstract whole may continue its miserable life, and the state remains  forever a stranger to its citizens, because feeling does not discover it  anywhere. The governing authorities find themselves compelled to  classify, and thereby simplify the multiplicity of citizens, and only to  know humanity in a representative form and at second-hand. Accordingly  they end by entirely losing sight of humanity, and by confounding it with  a simple artificial creation of the understanding, whilst on their part  the subject-classes cannot help receiving coldly laws that address  themselves so little to their personality. At length, society, weary of  having a burden that the state takes so little trouble to lighten, falls  to pieces and is broken up--a destiny that has long since attended most  European states. They are dissolved in what may be called a state of  moral nature, in which public authority is only one function more, hated  and deceived by those who think it necessary, respected only by those who  can do without it.    Thus compressed between two forces, within and without, could humanity  follow any other course than that which it has taken? The speculative  mind, pursuing imprescriptible goods and rights in the sphere of ideas,  must needs have become a stranger to the world of sense, and lose sight  of matter for the sake of form. On its part, the world of public  affairs, shut up in a monotonous circle of objects, and even there  restricted by formulas, was led to lose sight of the life and liberty of  the whole, while becoming impoverished at the same time in its own  sphere. Just as the speculative mind was tempted to model the real after  the intelligible, and to raise the subjective laws of its imagination  into laws constituting the existence of things, so the state spirit  rushed into the opposite extreme, wished to make a particular and  fragmentary experience the measure of all observation, and to apply  without exception to all affairs the rules of its own particular craft.  The speculative mind had necessarily to become the prey of a vain  subtlety, the state spirit of a narrow pedantry; for the former was  placed too high to see the individual, and the latter too low to survey  the whole. But the disadvantage of this direction of mind was not  confined to knowledge and mental production; it extended to action and  feeling. We know that the sensibility of the mind depends, as to degree,  on the liveliness, and for extent on the richness of the imagination.  Now the predominance of the faculty of analysis must necessarily deprive  the imagination of its warmth and energy, and a restricted sphere of  objects must diminish its wealth. It is for this reason that the  abstract thinker has very often a cold heart, because he analyzes  impressions, which only move the mind by their combination or totality;  on the other hand, the man of business, the statesman, has very often a  narrow heart, because, shut up in the narrow circle of his employment,  his imagination can neither expand nor adapt itself to another manner of  viewing things.    My subject has led me naturally to place in relief the distressing  tendency of the character of our own"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/68"],[0,"Warlord of Mars (#10)"],[1,"upon the flier ahead of  me.  It was a larger craft than mine, and not so swift; but even  so, it had covered an immense distance since the flight began.    The change in vegetation below showed me that we were rapidly  nearing the equator.  I was now near enough to my quarry to have  used my bow gun; but, though I could see that Dejah Thoris was not  on deck, I feared to fire upon the craft which bore her.    Thurid was deterred by no such scruples; and though it must have  been difficult for him to believe that it was really I who followed  them, he could not very well doubt the witness of his own eyes;  and so he trained their stern gun upon me with his own hands, and  an instant later an explosive radium projectile whizzed perilously  close above my deck.    The black's next shot was more accurate, striking my flier full  upon the prow and exploding with the instant of contact, ripping  wide open the bow buoyancy tanks and disabling the engine.    So quickly did my bow drop after the shot that I scarce had time  to lash Woola to the deck and buckle my own harness to a gunwale  ring before the craft was hanging stern up and making her last long  drop to ground.    Her stern buoyancy tanks prevented her dropping with great rapidity;  but Thurid was firing rapidly now in an attempt to burst these  also, that I might be dashed to death in the swift fall that would  instantly follow a successful shot.    Shot after shot tore past or into us, but by a miracle neither  Woola nor I was hit, nor were the after tanks punctured.  This  good fortune could not last indefinitely, and, assured that Thurid  would not again leave me alive, I awaited the bursting of the next  shell that hit; and then, throwing my hands above my head, I let go  my hold and crumpled, limp and inert, dangling in my harness like  a corpse.    The ruse worked, and Thurid fired no more at us.  Presently I heard  the diminishing sound of whirring propellers and realized that  again I was safe.    Slowly the stricken flier sank to the ground, and when I had freed  myself and Woola from the entangling wreckage I found that we were  upon the verge of a natural forest--so rare a thing upon the bosom  of dying Mars that, outside of the forest in the Valley Dor beside  the Lost Sea of Korus, I never before had seen its like upon the  planet.    From books and travelers I had learned something of the little-known  land of Kaol, which lies along the equator almost halfway round  the planet to the east of Helium.    It comprises a sunken area of extreme tropical heat, and is inhabited  by a nation of red men varying but little in manners, customs, and  appearance from the balance of the red men of Barsoom.    I knew that they were among those of the outer world who still  clung tenaciously to the discredited religion of the Holy Therns,  and that Matai Shang would find a ready welcome and safe refuge  among them; while John Carter could look for nothing better than  an ignoble death at their hands.    The isolation of the Kaolians is rendered almost complete by the  fact that no waterway connects their land with that of any other  nation, nor have they any need of a waterway since the low, swampy  land which comprises the entire area of their domain self-waters  their abundant tropical crops.    For great distances in all directions rugged hills and arid  stretches of dead sea bottom discourage intercourse with them, and  since there is practically no such thing as foreign commerce upon  warlike Barsoom, where each nation is sufficient to itself, really  little has been known relative to the court of the Jeddak of Kaol  and the numerous strange, but interesting, people over whom he  rules.    Occasional hunting parties have traveled to this out-of-the-way  corner of the globe, but the hostility of the natives has usually  brought disaster upon them, so that even the sport of hunting the  strange and savage creatures which haunt the jungle fastnesses of  Kaol has of later years proved insufficient lure even to the most  intrepid warriors.    It was upon the verge of the land of the Kaols that I now knew  myself to be, but in what direction to search for Dejah Thoris, or  how far into the heart of the great forest I might have to penetrate  I had not the faintest idea.    But not so Woola.    Scarcely had I disentangled him than he raised his head high in air  and commenced circling about at the edge of the forest.  Presently  he halted, and, turning to see if I were following, set off straight  into the maze of trees in the direction we had been going before  Thurid's shot had put an end to our flier.    As best I could, I stumbled after him down a steep declivity  beginning at the forest's edge.    Immense trees reared their mighty heads far above us, their broad  fronds completely shutting off the slightest glimpse of the sky.  It was easy to see why the Kaolians needed no navy; their cities,  hidden in the midst of this towering forest, must be entirely  invisible from above, nor could a landing be made by any but the  smallest fliers, and then only with the greatest risk of accident.    How Thurid and Matai Shang were to land I could not imagine, though  later I was to learn that to the level of the forest top there rises  in each city of Kaol a slender watchtower which guards the Kaolians  by day and by night against the secret approach of a hostile fleet.  To one of these the hekkador of the Holy Therns had no difficulty  in approaching, and by its means the party was safely lowered to  the ground.    As Woola and I approached the bottom of the declivity the ground  became soft and mushy, so that it was with the greatest difficulty  that we made any headway whatever.    Slender purple grasses topped with red and yellow fern-like fronds  grew rankly all about us to the height of several feet above my  head.    Myriad creepers hung festooned in graceful loops from tree to tree,  and among them were several varieties of the Martian \"man-flower,\"  whose blooms have eyes and hands with which to see and seize the  insects which form their diet.    The repulsive calot tree was, too, much in evidence.  It is a  carnivorous plant of about the bigness of a large sage-brush such  as dots our western plains.  Each branch ends in a set of strong  jaws, which have been known to drag down and devour large and  formidable beasts of prey.    Both Woola and I had several narrow escapes from these greedy,  arboreous monsters.    Occasional areas of firm sod gave us intervals of rest from the  arduous labor of traversing this gorgeous, twilight swamp, and it  was upon one of these that I finally decided to make camp for the  night which my chronometer warned me would soon be upon us.    Many varieties of fruit grew in abundance about us; and as Martian  calots are omnivorous, Woola had no difficulty in making a square  meal after I had brought down the viands for him.  Then, having  eaten, too, I lay down with my back to that of my faithful hound,  and dropped into a deep and dreamless sleep.    The forest was shrouded in impenetrable darkness when a low growl  from Woola awakened me.  All about us I could hear the stealthy  movement of great, padded feet, and now and then the wicked gleam  of green eyes upon us.  Arising, I drew my long-sword and waited.    Suddenly a deep-toned, horrid roar burst from some savage throat  almost at my side.  What a fool I had been not to have found safer  lodgings for myself and Woola among the branches of one of the  countless trees that surrounded us!    By daylight it would have been comparatively easy to have hoisted  Woola aloft in one manner or another, but now it was too late.  There  was nothing for it but to stand our ground and take our medicine,  though, from the hideous racket which now assailed our ears, and  for which that first roar had seemed to be the signal, I judged  that we must be in the midst of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of  the fierce, man-eating denizens of the Kaolian jungle.    All the balance of the night they kept up their infernal din, but  why they did not attack us I could not guess, nor am I sure to this  day, unless it is that none of them ever venture upon the patches  of scarlet sward which dot the swamp.    When morning broke they were still there, walking about as in  a circle, but always just beyond the edge of the sward.  A more  terrifying aggregation of fierce and blood-thirsty monsters it  would be difficult to imagine.    Singly and in pairs they commenced wandering off into the jungle  shortly after sunrise, and when the last of them had departed Woola  and I resumed our journey.    Occasionally we caught glimpses of horrid beasts all during the  day; but, fortunately, we were never far from a sward island, and  when they saw us their pursuit always ended at the verge of the  solid sod.    Toward noon we stumbled upon a well-constructed road running  in the general direction we had been pursuing.  Everything about  this highway marked it as the work of skilled engineers, and I was  confident, from the indications of antiquity which it bore, as well  as from the very evident signs of its being still in everyday use,  that it must lead to one of the principal cities of Kaol.    Just as we entered it from one side a huge monster emerged from  the jungle upon the other, and at sight of us charged madly in our  direction.    Imagine, if you can, a bald-faced hornet of your earthly experience  grown to the size of a prize Hereford bull, and you will have some  faint conception of the ferocious appearance and awesome formidability  of the winged monster that bore down upon me.    Frightful jaws in front and mighty, poisoned sting behind made my  relatively puny long-sword seem a pitiful weapon of defense indeed.  Nor could I hope to escape the lightning-like movements or hide  from those myriad facet eyes which covered three-fourths of the  hideous head, permitting the creature to see"]]]
