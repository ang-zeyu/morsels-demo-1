Let go of me!'    But Alice told him, quite kindly, that he was not going in to his tea,  but coming with us.    'I'm not,' said Albert-next-door; 'I'm going home. Leave go! I've got  a bad cold. You're making it worse.' Then he tried to cough, which was  very silly, because we'd seen him in the morning, and he'd told us where  the cold was that he wasn't to go out with. When he had tried to cough,  he said, 'Leave go of me! You see my cold's getting worse.'    'You should have thought of that before,' said Dicky; 'you're coming in  with us.'    'Don't be a silly,' said Noel; 'you know we told you at the very  beginning that resistance was useless. There is no disgrace in yielding.  We are five to your one.'    By this time Eliza had opened the door, and we thought it best to take  him in without any more parlaying. To parley with a prisoner is not done  by bandits.    Directly we got him safe into the nursery, H. O. began to jump about and  say, 'Now you're a prisoner really and truly!'    And Albert-next-door began to cry. He always does. I wonder he didn't  begin long before--but Alice fetched him one of the dried fruits we  gave Father for his birthday. It was a green walnut. I have noticed  the walnuts and the plums always get left till the last in the box; the  apricots go first, and then the figs and pears; and the cherries, if  there are any.    So he ate it and shut up. Then we explained his position to him, so that  there should be no mistake, and he couldn't say afterwards that he had  not understood.    'There will be no violence,' said Oswald--he was now Captain of the  Bandits, because we all know H. O. likes to be Chaplain when we  play prisoners--'no violence. But you will be confined in a dark,  subterranean dungeon where toads and snakes crawl, and but little of the  light of day filters through the heavily mullioned windows. You will be  loaded with chains. Now don't begin again, Baby, there's nothing to  cry about; straw will be your pallet; beside you the gaoler will set a  ewer--a ewer is only a jug, stupid; it won't eat you--a ewer with water;  and a mouldering crust will be your food.'    But Albert-next-door never enters into the spirit of a thing. He mumbled  something about tea-time.    Now Oswald, though stern, is always just, and besides we were all rather  hungry, and tea was ready. So we had it at once, Albert-next-door and  all--and we gave him what was left of the four-pound jar of apricot jam  we got with the money Noel got for his poetry. And we saved our crusts  for the prisoner.    Albert-next-door was very tiresome. Nobody could have had a nicer prison  than he had. We fenced him into a corner with the old wire nursery  fender and all the chairs, instead of putting him in the coal-cellar  as we had first intended. And when he said the dog-chains were cold the  girls were kind enough to warm his fetters thoroughly at the fire before  we put them on him.    We got the straw cases of some bottles of wine someone sent Father  one Christmas--it is some years ago, but the cases are quite good. We  unpacked them very carefully and pulled them to pieces and scattered  the straw about. It made a lovely straw pallet, and took ever so long to  make--but Albert-next-door has yet to learn what gratitude really is.  We got the bread trencher for the wooden platter where the prisoner's  crusts were put--they were not mouldy, but we could not wait till they  got so, and for the ewer we got the toilet jug out of the spare-room  where nobody ever sleeps. And even then Albert-next-door couldn't be  happy like the rest of us. He howled and cried and tried to get out, and  he knocked the ewer over and stamped on the mouldering crusts. Luckily  there was no water in the ewer because we had forgotten it, only dust  and spiders. So we tied him up with the clothes-line from the back  kitchen, and we had to hurry up, which was a pity for him. We might have  had him rescued by a devoted page if he hadn't been so tiresome. In fact  Noel was actually dressing up for the page when Albert-next-door kicked  over the prison ewer.    We got a sheet of paper out of an old exercise-book, and we made H. O.  prick his own thumb, because he is our little brother and it is our duty  to teach him to be brave. We none of us mind pricking ourselves; we've  done it heaps of times. H. O. didn't like it, but he agreed to do it,  and I helped him a little because he was so slow, and when he saw the  red bead of blood getting fatter and bigger as I squeezed his thumb he  was very pleased, just as I had told him he would be.    This is what we wrote with H. O.'s blood, only the blood gave out when  we got to 'Restored', and we had to write the rest with crimson lake,  which is not the same colour, though I always use it, myself, for  painting wounds.    While Oswald was writing it he heard Alice whispering to the prisoner  that it would soon be over, and it was only play. The prisoner left off  howling, so I pretended not to hear what she said. A Bandit Captain has  to overlook things sometimes. This was the letter--        'Albert Morrison is held a prisoner by Bandits.      On payment of three thousand pounds he will be      restored to his sorrowing relatives, and all      will be forgotten and forgiven.'    I was not sure about the last part, but Dicky was certain he had seen it  in the paper, so I suppose it must have been all right.    We let H. O. take the letter; it was only fair, as it was his blood it  was written with, and told him to leave it next door for Mrs Morrison.    H. O. came back quite quickly, and Albert-next-door's uncle came with  him.    'What is all this, Albert?' he cried. 'Alas, alas, my nephew! Do I find  you the prisoner of a desperate band of brigands?'    'Bandits,' said H. O; 'you know it says bandits.'    'I beg your pardon, gentlemen,' said Albert-next-door's uncle, 'bandits  it is, of course. This, Albert, is the direct result of the pursuit of  the guy on an occasion when your doting mother had expressly warned you  to forgo the pleasures of the chase.'    Albert said it wasn't his fault, and he hadn't wanted to play.    'So ho!' said his uncle, 'impenitent too! Where's the dungeon?'    We explained the dungeon, and showed him the straw pallet and the ewer  and the mouldering crusts and other things.    'Very pretty and complete,' he said. 'Albert, you are more highly  privileged than ever I was. No one ever made me a nice dungeon when I  was your age. I think I had better leave you where you are.'    Albert began to cry again and said he was sorry, and he would be a good  boy.    'And on this old familiar basis you expect me to ransom you, do you?  Honestly, my nephew, I doubt whether you are worth it. Besides, the sum  mentioned in this document strikes me as excessive: Albert really is  _not_ worth three thousand pounds. Also by a strange and unfortunate  chance I haven't the money about me. Couldn't you take less?'    We said perhaps we could.    'Say eightpence,' suggested Albert-next-door's uncle, 'which is all the  small change I happen to have on my person.'    'Thank you very much,' said Alice as he held it out; 'but are you sure  you can spare it? Because really it was only play.'    'Quite sure. Now, Albert, the game is over. You had better run home to  your mother and tell her how much you've enjoyed yourself.'    When Albert-next-door had gone his uncle sat in the Guy Fawkes armchair  and took Alice on his knee, and we sat round the fire waiting till it  would be time to let off our fireworks. We roasted the chestnuts he  sent Dicky out for, and he told us stories till it was nearly seven. His  stories are first-rate--he does all the parts in different voices. At  last he said--    'Look here, young-uns. I like to see you play and enjoy yourselves, and  I don't think it hurts Albert to enjoy himself too.'    'I don't think he did much,' said H. O. But I knew what  Albert-next-door's uncle meant because I am much older than H. O. He  went on--    'But what about Albert's mother? Didn't you think how anxious she would  be at his not coming home? As it happens I saw him come in with you, so  we knew it was all right. But if I hadn't, eh?'    He only talks like that when he is very serious, or even angry. Other  times he talks like people in books--to us, I mean.    We none of us said anything. But I was thinking. Then Alice spoke.    Girls seem not to mind saying things that we don't say. She put her arms  round Albert-next-door's uncle's neck and said--    'We're very, very sorry. We didn't think about his mother. You see we  try very hard not to think about other people's mothers because--'    Just then we heard Father's key in the door and Albert-next-door's uncle  kissed Alice and put her down, and we all went down to meet Father. As  we went I thought I heard Albert-next-door's uncle say something that  sounded like 'Poor little beggars!'    He couldn't have meant us, when we'd been having such a jolly time, and  chestnuts, and fireworks to look forward to after dinner and everything!        CHAPTER 8. BEING EDITORS    It was Albert's uncle who thought of our trying a newspaper. He said he  thought we should not find the bandit business a paying industry, as a  permanency, and that journalism might be.    We had sold Noel's poetry and that piece of information about Lord  Tottenham to the good editor, so we thought it would not be a bad idea  to have a newspaper of our own. We saw plainly that editors must be very  rich and powerful, because of the grand office and the man in the glass  case, like a museum, and the soft carpets and big writing-table. Besides  our having seen a whole handful of money that the editor pulled out  quite carelessly from his trousers pocket when he gave me my five bob.    Dora wanted to be editor and so did Oswald, but he gave way to her  because she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/775"],[0,"When the Sleeper Wakes (#10)"],[1,"angry things to a pretty but  petulant woman. Both were in the picturesque costume that seemed so  strange to Graham. \"I have worked,\" said the man, \"but what have you  been doing?\"    \"Ah!\" said Graham. He forgot everything else, and sat down in the chair.  Within five minutes he heard himself named, heard \"when the Sleeper  wakes,\" used jestingly as a proverb for remote postponement, and passed  himself by, a thing remote and incredible. But in a little while he knew  those two people like intimate friends.    At last the miniature drama came to an end, and the square face of the  apparatus was blank again.    It was a strange world into which he had been permitted to see,  unscrupulous, pleasure seeking, energetic, subtle, a world too of dire  economic struggle; there were allusions he did not understand, incidents  that conveyed strange suggestions of altered moral ideals, flashes of  dubious enlightenment. The blue canvas that bulked so largely in his  first impression of the city ways appeared again and again as  the costume of the common people. He had no doubt the story was  contemporary, and its intense realism was undeniable. And the end had  been a tragedy that oppressed him. He sat staring at the blankness.    He started and rubbed his eyes. He had been so absorbed in the  latter-day substitute for a novel, that he awoke to the little green  and white room with more than a touch of the surprise of his first  awakening.    He stood up, and abruptly he was back in his own wonderland. The  clearness of the kinetoscope drama passed, and the struggle in the vast  place of streets, the ambiguous Council, the swift phases of his waking  hour, came back. These people had spoken of the Council with suggestions  of a vague universality of power. And they had spoken of the Sleeper; it  had not really struck him vividly at the time that he was the Sleeper.  He had to recall precisely what they had said.    He walked into the bedroom and peered up through the quick intervals of  the revolving fan. As the fan swept round, a dim turmoil like the noise  of machinery came in rhythmic eddies. All else was silence.      Though the perpetual day still irradiated his apartments, he perceived  the little intermittent strip of sky was now deep blue--black almost,  with a dust of little stars.    He resumed his examination of the rooms. He could find no way of opening  the padded door, no bell nor other means of calling for attendance.  His feeling of wonder was in abeyance; but he was curious, anxious for  information. He wanted to know exactly how he stood to these new things.  He tried to compose himself to wait until someone came to him. Presently  he became restless and eager for information, for distraction, for fresh  sensations.    He went back to the apparatus in the other room, and had soon puzzled  out the method of replacing the cylinders by others. As he did so, it  came into his mind that it must be these little appliances had fixed the  language so that it was still clear and understandable after two hundred  years. The haphazard cylinders he substituted displayed a musical  fantasia. At first it was beautiful, and then it was sensuous. He  presently recognized what appeared to him to be an altered version of  the story of Tannhauser. The music was unfamiliar. But the rendering was  realistic, and with a contemporary unfamiliarity. Tannhauser did not  go to a Venusberg, but to a Pleasure City. What was a Pleasure City? A  dream, surely, the fancy of a fantastic, voluptuous writer.    He became interested, curious. The story developed with a flavour of  strangely twisted sentimentality. Suddenly he did not like it. He liked  it less as it proceeded.    He had a revulsion of feeling. These were no pictures, no idealisations,  but photographed realities. He wanted no more of the twenty-second  century Venusberg. He forgot the part played by the model in nineteenth  century art, and gave way to an archaic indignation. He rose, angry and  half ashamed at himself for witnessing this thing even in solitude. He  pulled forward the apparatus, and with some violence sought for a means  of stopping its action. Something snapped. A violet spark stung and  convulsed his arm and the thing was still. When he attempted next day  to replace these Tannhauser cylinders by another pair, he found the  apparatus broken....    He struck out a path oblique to the room and paced to and fro,  struggling with intolerable vast impressions. The things he had derived  from the cylinders and the things he had seen, conflicted, confused him.  It seemed to him the most amazing thing of all that in his thirty years  of life he had never tried to shape a picture of these coming times.  \"We were making the future,\" he said, \"and hardly any of us troubled to  think what future we were making. And here it is!\"    \"What have they got to, what has been done? How do I come into the midst  of it all?\" The vastness of street and house he was prepared for,  the multitudes of people. But conflicts in the city ways! And the  systematised sensuality of a class of rich men!    He thought of Bellamy, the hero of whose Socialistic Utopia had so  oddly anticipated this actual experience. But here was no Utopia,  no Socialistic state. He had already seen enough to realise that the  ancient antithesis of luxury, waste and sensuality on the one hand and  abject poverty on the other, still prevailed. He knew enough of the  essential factors of life to understand that correlation. And not only  were the buildings of the city gigantic and the crowds in the street  gigantic, but the voices he had heard in the ways, the uneasiness of  Howard, the very atmosphere spoke of gigantic discontent. What country  was he in? Still England it seemed, and yet strangely \"un-English.\" His  mind glanced at the rest of the world, and saw only an enigmatical veil.    He prowled about his apartment, examining everything as a caged animal  might do. He felt very tired, felt that feverish exhaustion that does  not admit of rest. He listened for long spaces under the ventilator to  catch some distant echo of the tumults he felt must be proceeding in the  city.    He began to talk to himself. \"Two hundred and three years!\" he said to  himself over and over again, laughing stupidly. \"Then I am two hundred  and thirty-three years old! The oldest inhabitant. Surely they haven't  reversed the tendency of our time and gone back to the rule of the  oldest. My claims are indisputable. Mumble, mumble. I remember the  Bulgarian atrocities as though it was yesterday. 'Tis a great age!  Ha ha!\" He was surprised at first to hear himself laughing, and then  laughed again deliberately and louder. Then he realised that he was  behaving foolishly. \"Steady,\" he said. \"Steady!\"    His pacing became more regular. \"This new world,\" he said. \"I don't  understand it. _Why?_... But it is all _why!_\"    \"I suppose they can fly and do all sorts of things Let me try and  remember just how it began.\"    He was surprised at first to find how vague the memories of his first  thirty years had become. He remembered fragments, for the most part  trivial moments, things of no great importance that he had observed. His  boyhood seemed the most accessible at first, he recalled school books  and certain lessons in mensuration. Then he revived the more salient  features of his life, memories of the wife long since dead, her magic  influence now gone beyond corruption, of his rivals and friends and  betrayers, of the swift decision of this issue and that, and then of  his, last years of misery, of fluctuating resolves, and at last of his  strenuous studies. In a little while he perceived he had it all again;  dim perhaps, like metal long laid aside, but in no way defective or  injured, capable of re-polishing. And the hue of it was a deepening  misery. Was it worth re-polishing? By a miracle he had been lifted out  of a life that had become intolerable.    He reverted to his present condition. He wrestled with the facts in  vain. It became an inextricable tangle. He saw the sky through the  ventilator pink with dawn. An old persuasion came out of the dark  recesses of his memory. \"I must sleep,\" he said. It appeared as a  delightful relief from this mental distress and from the growing pain  and heaviness of his limbs. He went to the strange little bed, lay down  and was presently asleep.    He was destined to become very familiar indeed with these apartments  before he left them, for he remained imprisoned for three days. During  that time no one, except Howard, entered his prison. The marvel of his  fate mingled with and in some way minimised the marvel of his survival.  He had awakened to mankind it seemed only to be snatched away into this  unaccountable solitude. Howard came regularly with subtly sustaining and  nutritive fluids, and light and pleasant foods, quite strange to Graham.  He always closed the door carefully as he entered. On matters of detail  he was increasingly obliging, but the bearing of Graham on the great  issues that were evidently being contested so closely beyond the  soundproof walls that enclosed him, he would not elucidate. He evaded,  as politely as possible, every question on the position of affairs in  the outer world.    And in those three days Graham's incessant thoughts went far and wide.  All that he had seen, all this elaborate contrivance to prevent  him seeing, worked together in his mind. Almost every possible  interpretation of his position he debated--even as it chanced, the right  interpretation. Things that presently happened to him, came to him at  last credible, by virtue of this seclusion. When at length the moment of  his release arrived, it found him prepared.    Howard's bearing went far to deepen Graham's impression of his own  strange importance; the door between its opening and closing seemed to  admit with him a breath of momentous happening.
