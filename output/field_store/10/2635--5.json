Or Law with lawyers is an ample still,  Wrought by the passions' heat with chymic skill:  While the fire burns, the gains are quickly made,  And freely flow the profits of the trade;  Nay, when the fierceness fails, these artists blow  The dying fire, and make the embers glow,  As long as they can make the smaller profits flow:  At length the process of itself will stop,  When they perceive they've drawn out every drop.  Yet, I repeat, there are who nobly strive  To keep the sense of moral worth alive;  Men who would starve, ere meanly deign to live  On what deception and chican'ry give;  And these at length succeed; they have their strife,  Their apprehensions, stops, and rubs in life;  But honour, application, care, and skill,  Shall bend opposing fortune to their will.     Of such is Archer, he who keeps in awe  Contending parties by his threats of law:  He, roughly honest, has been long a guide  In Borough-business, on the conquering side;  And seen so much of both sides, and so long,  He thinks the bias of man's mind goes wrong:  Thus, though he's friendly, he is still severe,  Surly, though kind, suspiciously sincere:  So much he's seen of baseness in the mind,  That, while a friend to man, he scorns mankind;  He knows the human heart, and sees with dread,  By slight temptation, how the strong are led;  He knows how interest can asunder rend  The bond of parent, master, guardian, friend,  To form a new and a degrading tie  'Twixt needy vice and tempting villainy.  Sound in himself, yet when such flaws appear,  He doubts of all, and learns that self to fear:  For where so dark the moral view is grown,  A timid conscience trembles for her own;  The pitchy-taint of general vice is such  As daubs the fancy, and you dread the touch.     Far unlike him was one in former times,  Famed for the spoil he gather'd by his crimes;  Who, while his brethren nibbling held their prey,  He like an eagle seized and bore the whole away.     Swallow, a poor Attorney, brought his boy  Up at his desk, and gave him his employ;  He would have bound him to an honest trade,  Could preparations have been duly made.  The clerkship ended, both the sire and son  Together did what business could be done;  Sometimes they'd luck to stir up small disputes  Among their friends, and raise them into suits:  Though close and hard, the father was content  With this resource, now old and indolent:  But his young Swallow, gaping and alive  To fiercer feelings, was resolved to thrive:  -  \"Father,\" he said, \"but little can they win,  Who hunt in couples where the game is thin;  Let's part in peace, and each pursue his gain,  Where it may start--our love may yet remain.\"  The parent growl'd, he couldn't think that love  Made the young cockatrice his den remove;  But, taught by habit, he the truth suppress \"d,  Forced a frank look, and said he \"thought it best.\"  Not long they'd parted ere dispute arose;  The game they hunted quickly made them foes.  Some house the father by his art had won  Seem'd a fit cause of contest to the son,  Who raised a claimant, and then found a way  By a staunch witness to secure his prey.  The people cursed him, but in times of need  Trusted in one so certain to succeed:  By Law's dark by-ways he had stored his mind  With wicked knowledge, how to cheat mankind.  Few are the freeholds in our ancient town;  A copyright from heir to heir came down,  From whence some heat arose, when there was doubt  In point of heirship; but the fire went out,  Till our attorney had the art to raise  The dying spark, and blow it to a blaze:  For this he now began his friends to treat;  His way to starve them was to make them eat,  And drink oblivious draughts--to his applause,  It must be said, he never starved a cause;  He'd roast and boil'd upon his board; the boast  Of half his victims was his boil'd and roast;  And these at every hour: --he seldom took  Aside his client, till he'd praised his cook;  Nor to an office led him, there in pain  To give his story and go out again;  But first the brandy and the chine where seen,  And then the business came by starts between.     \"Well, if 'tis so, the house to you belongs;  But have you money to redress these wrongs?  Nay, look not sad, my friend; if you're correct,  You'll find the friendship that you'd not expect.\"     If right the man, the house was Swallow's own;  If wrong, his kindness and good-will were shown:  \"Rogue!\" \"Villain!\" \"Scoundrel!\" cried the losers all:  He let them cry, for what would that recall?  At length he left us, took a village seat,  And like a vulture look'd abroad for meat;  The Borough-booty, give it all its praise,  Had only served the appetite to raise;  But if from simple heirs he drew their land,  He might a noble feast at will command;  Still he proceeded by his former rules,  His bait their pleasures, when he fished for fools -  Flagons and haunches on his board were placed,  And subtle avarice look'd like thoughtless waste:  Most of his friends, though youth from him had fled,  Were young, were minors, of their sires in dread;  Or those whom widow'd mothers kept in bounds,  And check'd their generous rage for steeds and hounds;  Or such as travell'd 'cross the land to view  A Christian's conflict with a boxing Jew:  Some too had run upon Newmarket heath  With so much speed that they were out of breath;  Others had tasted claret, till they now  To humbler port would turn, and knew not how.  All these for favours would to Swallow run,  Who never sought their thanks for all he'd done;  He kindly took them by the hand, then bow'd  Politely low, and thus his love avow'd -  (For he'd a way that many judged polite,  A cunning dog--he'd fawn before he'd bite) -     \"Observe, my friends, the frailty of our race  When age unmans us--let me state a case:  There's our friend Rupert--we shall soon redress  His present evil--drink to our success -  I flatter not; but did you ever see  Limbs better turn'd? a prettier boy than he?  His senses all acute, his passions such  As Nature gave--she never does too much;  His the bold wish the cup of joy to drain,  And strength to bear it without qualm or pain.     \"Now view his father as he dozing lies,  Whose senses wake not when he opes his eyes;  Who slips and shuffles when he means to walk,  And lisps and gabbles if he tries to talk;  Feeling he's none--he could as soon destroy  The earth itself, as aught it holds enjoy;  A nurse attends him to lay straight his limbs,  Present his gruel, and respect his whims:  Now shall this dotard from our hero hold  His lands and lordships? Shall he hide his gold!  That which he cannot use, and dare not show,  And will not give--why longer should he owe?  Yet, t'would be murder should we snap the locks,  And take the thing he worships from the box;  So let him dote and dream:  but, till he die,  Shall not our generous heir receive supply?  For ever sitting on the river's brink?  And ever thirsty, shall he fear to drink?  The means are simple, let him only wish,  Then say he's willing, and I'll fill his dish.\"     They all applauded, and not least the boy,  Who now replied, \"It fill'd his heart with joy  To find he needed not deliv'rance crave  Of death, or wish the Justice in the grave;  Who, while he spent, would every art retain,  Of luring home the scatter'd gold again;  Just as a fountain gaily spirts and plays  With what returns in still and secret ways.\"     Short was the dream of bliss; he quickly found  His father's acres all were Swallow's ground.  Yet to those arts would other heroes lend  A willing ear, and Swallow was their friend;  Ever successful, some began to think  That Satan help'd him to his pen and ink;  And shrewd suspicions ran about the place,  \"There was a compact\"--I must leave the case.  But of the parties, had the fiend been one,  The business could not have been speedier done:  Still when a man has angled day and night,  The silliest gudgeons will refuse to bite:  So Swallow tried no more:  but if they came  To seek his friendship, that remain'd the same:  Thus he retired in peace, and some would say  He'd balk'd his partner, and had learn'd to pray.  To this some zealots lent an ear, and sought  How Swallow felt, then said \"a change is wrought.\"  'Twas true there wanted all the signs of grace,  But there were strong professions in their place;  Then, too, the less that men from him expect,  The more the praise to the converting sect;  He had not yet subscribed to all their creed,  Nor own'd a Call, but he confess'd the need:  His aquiescent speech, his gracious look,  That pure attention, when the brethren spoke,  Was all contrition,--he had felt the wound,  And with confession would again be sound.     True, Swallow's board had still the sumptuous treat;  But could they blame? the warmest zealots eat:  He drank--'twas needful his poor nerves to brace;  He swore--'twas habit; he was grieved--'twas grace:  What could they do a new-born zeal to nurse?  \"His wealth's undoubted--let him hold our purse;  He'll add his bounty, and the house we'll raise  Hard by the church, and gather all her strays:  We'll watch her sinners as they home retire,  And pluck the brands from the devouring fire.\"     Alas! such speech was but an empty boast;  The good men reckon'd, but without their host;  Swallow, delighted, took the trusted store,  And own'd the sum; they did not ask for more,  Till more was needed; when they call'd for aid -  And had it?--No, their agent was afraid:  \"Could he but know to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5225"],[0,"The Satyricon — Complete (#10)"],[1,"wished to rid himself of the importunities of Psyche, was  delighted; had not Giton been shut up in the bridal-chamber, the plan  would have presented no difficulties, but we wished to take him with us,  and out of the way of the viciousness of these prostitutes.  We were  anxiously engaged in debating this very point, when Pannychis fell out of  bed, and dragged Giton after her, by her own weight.  He was not hurt,  but the girl gave her head a slight bump, and raised such a clamor that  Quartilla, in a terrible fright, rushed headlong into the room, giving us  the opportunity of making off.  We did not tarry, but flew back to our  inn where,) throwing ourselves upon the bed, we passed the remainder of  the night without fear.  (Sallying forth next day, we came upon two of  our kidnappers, one of whom Ascyltos savagely attacked the moment he set  eyes upon him, and, after having thrashed and seriously wounded him,  he ran to my aid against the other.  He defended himself so stoutly,  however, that he wounded us both, slightly, and escaped unscathed.)  The  third day had now dawned, the date set for the free dinner (at  Trimalchio's,) but battered as we were, flight seemed more to our taste  than quiet, so (we hastened to our inn and, as our wounds turned out to  be trifling, we dressed them with vinegar and oil, and went to bed.  The  ruffian whom we had done for, was still lying upon the ground and we  feared detection.)  Affairs were at this pass, and we were framing  melancholy excuses with which to evade the coming revel, when a slave of  Agamemnon's burst in upon our trembling conclave and said, \"Don't you  know with whom your engagement is today?  The exquisite Trimalchio, who  keeps a clock and a liveried bugler in his dining-room, so that he can  tell, instantly, how much of his life has run out!\"  Forgetting all our  troubles at that, we dressed hurriedly and ordered Giton, who had very  willingly performed his servile office, to follow us to the bath.

Having put on our clothes, in the meantime, we commenced to stroll around  and soon, the better to amuse ourselves, approached the circle of  players; all of a sudden we caught sight of a bald-headed old fellow,  rigged out in a russet colored tunic, playing ball with some long haired  boys.  It was not so much the boys who attracted our attention, although  they might well have merited it, as it was the spectacle afforded by this  beslippered paterfamilias playing with a green ball.  If one but touched  the ground, he never stooped for it to put it back in play; for a slave  stood by with a bagful from which the players were supplied.  We noted  other innovations as well, for two eunuchs were stationed at opposite  sides of the ring, one of whom held a silver chamber-pot, the other  counted the balls; not those which bounced back and forth from hand to  hand, in play, but those which fell to the ground.  While we were  marveling at this display of refinement, Menelaus rushed up, \"He is the  one with whom you will rest upon your elbow,\" he panted, \"what you see  now, is only a prelude to the dinner.\"  Menelaus had scarcely ceased  speaking when Trimalchio snapped his fingers; the eunuch, hearing the  signal, held the chamber-pot for him while he still continued playing.  After relieving his bladder, he called for water to wash his hands,  barely moistened his fingers, and dried them upon a boy's head.          CHAPTER THE TWENTY-EIGHTH.    To go into details would take too long.  We entered the bath, finally,  and after sweating for a minute or two in the warm room, we passed  through into the cold water.  But short as was the time, Trimalchio had  already been sprinkled with perfume and was being rubbed down, not with  linen towels, however, but with cloths made from the finest wool.  Meanwhile, three masseurs were guzzling Falernian under his eyes, and  when they spilled a great deal of it in their brawling, Trimalchio  declared they were pouring a libation to his Genius.  He was then wrapped  in a coarse scarlet wrap-rascal, and placed in a litter. Four runners,  whose liveries were decorated with metal plates, preceded him, as also  did a wheel-chair in which rode his favorite, a withered, blear eyed  slave, even more repulsive looking than his master.  A singing boy  approached the head of his litter, as he was being carried along, and  played upon small pipes the whole way, just as if he were communicating  some secret to his master's ear.  Marveling greatly, we followed, and met  Agamemnon at the outer door, to the post of which was fastened a small  tablet bearing this inscription:                        NO SLAVE TO LEAVE THE PREMISES                   WITHOUT PERMISSION FROM THE MASTER.                        PENALTY ONE HUNDRED LASHES.    In the vestibule stood the porter, clad in green and girded with a  cherry-colored belt, shelling peas into a silver dish.  Above the  threshold was suspended a golden cage, from which a black and white  magpie greeted the visitors.          CHAPTER THE TWENTY-NINTH.    I almost fell backwards and broke my legs while staring at all this, for  to the left, as we entered, not far from the porter's alcove, an enormous  dog upon a chain was painted upon the wall, and above him this  inscription, in capitals:                                 BEWARE THE DOG.    My companions laughed, but I plucked up my courage and did not hesitate,  but went on and examined the entire wall.  There was a scene in a slave  market, the tablets hanging from the slaves' necks, and Trimalchio  himself, wearing his hair long, holding a caduceus in his hand, entering  Rome, led by the hand of Minerva.  Then again the painstaking artist had  depicted him casting up accounts, and still again, being appointed  steward; everything being explained by inscriptions.  Where the walls  gave way to the portico, Mercury was shown lifting him up by the chin,  to a tribunal placed on high.  Near by stood Fortune with her horn of  plenty, and the three Fates, spinning golden flax.  I also took note of a  group of runners, in the portico, taking their exercise under the eye of  an instructor, and in one corner was a large cabinet, in which was a very  small shrine containing silver Lares, a marble Venus, and a golden casket  by no means small, which held, so they told us, the first shavings of  Trimalchio's beard.  I asked the hall-porter what pictures were in the  middle hall.  \"The Iliad and the Odyssey,\" he replied, \"and the  gladiatorial games given under Laenas.\"  There was no time in which to  examine them all.          CHAPTER THE THIRTIETH.    We had now come to the dining-room, at the entrance to which sat a  factor, receiving accounts, and, what gave me cause for astonishment,  rods and axes were fixed to the door-posts, superimposed, as it were,  upon the bronze beak of a ship, whereon was inscribed:                         TO GAIUS POMPEIUS TRIMALCHIO                              AUGUSTAL, SEVIR                             FROM CINNAMUS HIS                                  STEWARD.    A double lamp, suspended from the ceiling, hung beneath the inscription,  and a tablet was fixed to each door-post; one, if my memory serves me,  was inscribed,                           ON DECEMBER THIRTIETH AND                               THIRTY FIRST                                    OUR                              GAIUS DINES OUT    the other bore a painting of the moon in her phases, and the seven  planets, and the days which were lucky and those which were unlucky,  distinguished by distinctive studs.  We had had enough of these novelties  and started to enter the dining-room when a slave, detailed to this duty,  cried out, \"Right foot first.\"  Naturally, we were afraid that some of us  might break some rule of conduct and cross the threshold the wrong way;  nevertheless, we started out, stepping off together with the right foot,  when all of a sudden, a slave who had been stripped, threw himself at our  feet, and commenced begging us to save him from punishment, as it was no  serious offense for which he was in jeopardy; the steward's clothing had  been stolen from him in the baths, and the whole value could scarcely  amount to ten sesterces.  So we drew back our right feet and intervened  with the steward, who was counting gold pieces in the hall, begging him  to remit the slave's punishment.  Putting a haughty face on the matter,  \"It's not the loss I mind so much,\" he said, \"as it is the carelessness  of this worthless rascal.  He lost my dinner clothes, given me on my  birthday they were, by a certain client, Tyrian purple too, but it had  been washed once already.  But what does it amount to?  I make you a  present of the scoundrel!\"          CHAPTER THE THIRTY-FIRST.    We felt deeply obligated by his great condescension, and the same  slave for whom we had interceded, rushed up to us as we entered the  dining-room, and to our astonishment, kissed us thick and fast, voicing  his thanks for our kindness.  \"You'll know in a minute whom you did a  favor for,\" he confided, \"the master's wine is the thanks of a grateful  butler!\"  At length we reclined, and slave boys from Alexandria poured  water cooled with snow upon our hands, while others"]]]
