The mercury was at 37 deg. at breakfast-time this morning. Fuel is scarce  and dear, some of the rooms are without fireplaces, and these good  people study, write, and work cheerfully in this temperature in open  rooms, untouched by the early sun.    The preparations for to-morrow's journey are nearly complete. Three  mules have been engaged for the baggage--one for Hadji, and a saddle  mule for myself; stores, a revolver, and a _mangel_ or brazier have  been bought; a permit to travel has been obtained, and my hosts, with  the most thoughtful kindness, have facilitated all the arrangements. I  have bought two mule _yekdans_, which are tall, narrow leather trunks  on strong iron frames, with stout straps to buckle over the top of the  pack saddle. On the whole I find that it is best to adopt as far as  possible the travelling equipments of the country in which one  travels. The muleteers and servants understand them better, and if any  thing goes wrong, or wears out, it can be repaired or replaced. I have  given away _en route_ nearly all the things I brought from England,  and have reduced my camp furniture to a folding bed and a chair. I  shall start with three novelties--a fellow-traveller,[9] a saddle  mule, and an untried saddle.    It is expected that the journey will be a very severe one, owing to  the exceptionally heavy snowfall reported from the Zagros mountains  and the Persian plateau. The Persian post has arrived several days  late. I. L. B.    FOOTNOTES:    [6] I heard that the Shah had prohibited this \"Dead March\" to Kerbela,  on account of the many risks to the public health involved in it, but  nearly a year later, in Persian Kurdistan, I met, besides thousands of  living pilgrims, a large caravan of the dead.    [7] Six months later a Bakhtiari chief, a bigoted Moslem, said to me  at the conclusion of an earnest plea for European medical advice,  \"Yes, Jesus was a great prophet; _send us a Hak[=i]m in His  likeness_,\" and doubtless the nearer that likeness is the greater is  the success.    [8] The entire trade of Baghdad is estimated at about L2,500,000, of  which the Persian transit trade is nearly a quarter. The Persian  imports and exports through Baghdad are classified thus: Manufactured  goods, including Manchester piece goods, and continental woollens and  cottons, 7000 to 8000 loads. Indian manufactures, 1000 loads. Loaf  sugar, chiefly from Marseilles, 6000 loads. Drugs, pepper, coffee,  tea, other sugars, indigo, cochineal, copper, and spelter, 7000 loads.  The Persian exports for despatch by sea include wool, opium, cotton,  carpets, gum, and dried fruits, and for local consumption, among  others, tobacco, _roghan_ (clarified butter), and dried and fresh  fruits, with a probable bulk of from 12,000 to 15,000 loads.    [9] I had given up the idea of travelling in Persia, and was preparing  to leave India for England, when an officer, with whom I was then  unacquainted, and who was about to proceed to Tihran on business,  kindly offered me his escort. The journey turned out one of extreme  hardship and difficulty, and had it not been for his kindness and  efficient help I do not think that I should have accomplished it.          LETTER III[10]           YAKOBIYEH, ASIATIC TURKEY, _Jan. 11_.    Whether for \"well or ill\" the journey to Tihran is begun. I am ashamed  to say that I had grown so nervous about its untried elements, and  about the possibilities of the next two months, that a very small  thing would have made me give it up at the last moment; but now that I  am fairly embarked upon it in splendid weather, the spirit of travel  has returned.    Much remained for the last morning,--debts to be paid in complicated  money, for Indian, Turkish, and Persian coins are all current here;  English circular notes to be turned into difficult coin, and the usual  \"row\" with the muleteers to be endured. This disagreeable farce  attends nearly all departures in the East, and I never feel the  comfortable assurance that it means nothing.    The men weighed my baggage, which was considerably under weight, the  day before, but yesterday three or four of them came into the  courtyard, shouting in Arabic at the top of their loud harsh voices  that they would not carry the loads. Hadji roared at them, loading his  revolver all the time, calling them \"sons of burnt fathers,\" and other  choice names. Dr. Bruce and Dr. Sutton reasoned with them from the  balcony, when, in the very height of the row, they suddenly  shouldered the loads and went off with them.    Two hours later the delightful hospitalities of Dr. and Mrs. Sutton  were left behind, and the farewell to the group in the courtyard of  the mission house is a long farewell to civilisation. Rumours of  difficulties have been rife, and among the various dismal prophecies  the one oftenest repeated is that we shall be entangled in the snows  of the Zagros mountains; but the journey began propitiously among  oranges and palms, bright sunshine and warm good wishes. My mule turns  out a fine, spirited, fast-walking animal, and the untried saddle  suits me. My marching equipment consists of two large holsters, with a  revolver and tea-making apparatus in one, and a bottle of milk, and  dates in the other. An Afghan sheepskin coat is strapped to the front  of the saddle, and a blanket and stout mackintosh behind. I wear a  cork sun-helmet, a gray mask instead of a veil, an American mountain  dress with a warm jacket over it, and tan boots, scarcely the worse  for a year of Himalayan travel. Hadji is dressed like a wild  Ishmaelite.    Captain Dougherty of H.M.S. _Comet_ and his chief engineer piloted us  through the narrow alleys and thronged bazars,--a _zaptieh_, or  gendarme, with a rifle across his saddle-bow, and a sheathed sabre in  his hand, shouting at the donkey boys, and clearing the crowd to right  and left. Through the twilight of the bazars, where chance rays of  sunshine fell on warm colouring, gay merchandise, and picturesque  crowds; along narrow alleys, overhung by brown lattice windows; out  under the glorious blue of heaven among ruins and graves, through the  northern gateway, and then there was an abrupt exchange of the roar  and limitations of the City of the Caliphs for the silence of the  desert and the brown sweep of a limitless horizon. A walled Eastern  city has no suburbs. It is a literal step from a crowded town to  absolute solitude. The contrast is specially emphasised at Baghdad,  where the transition is made from a great commercial city with a  crowded waterway, to an uninhabited plain in the nudity of mid-winter.    A last look at gleaming domes, coloured minarets, and massive  mausoleums, rising out of an environment of palms and orange groves,  at the brick walls and towers of the city, at the great gate to which  lines of caravans were converging from every quarter, a farewell to  the kindly pilots, and the journey began in earnest.    The \"Desert\" sweeps up to the walls of Baghdad, but it is a misnomer  to call the vast level of rich, stoneless, alluvial soil a desert. It  is a dead flat of uninhabited earth; orange colocynth balls, a little  wormwood, and some alkaline plants which camels eat, being its chief  products. After the inundations reedy grass grows in the hollows. It  is a waste rather than a desert, and was once a populous plain, and  the rich soil only needs irrigation to make it \"blossom as the rose.\"  Traces of the splendid irrigation system under which it was once a  garden abound along the route.    The mid-day and afternoon were as glorious as an unclouded sky, a warm  sun, and a fresh, keen air could make them. The desert freedom was all  around, and the nameless charm of a nomadic life. The naked plain,  which stretched to the horizon, was broken only by the brown tents of  Arabs, mixed up with brown patches of migrating flocks, strings of  brown camels, straggling caravans, and companies of Arab horsemen  heavily armed. An expanse of dried mud, the mirage continually seen, a  cloudless sky, and a brilliant sun--this was all. I felt better at  once in the pure, exhilarating desert air, and nervousness about the  journey was left behind. I even indulged in a gallop, and except for  her impetuosity, which carried me into the middle of a caravan, and  turning round a few times, the mule behaved so irreproachably that I  forgot the potential possibilities of evil. Still, I do not think that  there can ever be that perfect correspondence of will between a mule  and his rider that there is between a horse and his rider.    The mirage was almost continual and grossly deceptive. Fair blue lakes  appeared with palms and towers mirrored on their glassy surfaces,  giving place to snowy ranges with bright waters at their feet, fringed  by tall trees, changing into stately processions, all so absolutely  real that the real often seemed the delusion. These deceptions,  continued for several hours, were humiliating and exasperating.    Towards evening the shams disappeared, the waste purpled as the sun  sank, and after riding fifteen miles we halted near the mud village of  Orta Khan, a place with brackish water and no supplies but a little  brackish sheep's milk. The caravanserai was abominable, and we rode on  to a fine gravelly camping-ground, but the headman and some of the  villagers came out, and would not hear of our pitching the tents where  we should be the prey of predatory hordes, strong enough, they said,  to overpower an officer, two _zaptiehs_, and three orderlies! Being  unwilling to get them into trouble, we accepted a horrible  camping-ground, a mud-walled \"garden,\" trenched for dates, and lately  irrigated, as damp and clayey as it could be. My _dhurrie_ will not be  dry again this winter. The mules could not get in, the baggage was  unloaded at some distance, and was all mixed up, and Hadji showed  himself incapable; my tent fell"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38828"],[0,"Journeys in Persia and Kurdistan, Volume 2 (of 2) (#10)"],[1," _kiziks_ for fuel on their roofs, and camped by the  richly-wooded river Guwa, in a grove of fine trees, crossing its  vigorous torrent the next morning by a wicker bridge, the Pul-i-Guwa.  A long ascent among oaks, where the views of mountains and ravines  were grand, an upland meadow where I found a white bee orchis, and a  steep ascent among stones, brought us to the top of a pass 9650 feet  in altitude. On its south-west side there is a very striking view of  gorges of immense depth and steepness, through which the Guwa finds  its way. To the north-east the prospect is of a very feeble country,  which we entered by a tiresome gravelly descent, very open, composed  of low hills with outcrops of rock at their summits, irrigated  rolling valleys and plains, with deep rifts indicative of streams, and  some Magawe villages.    Our route lay across the most scorched and gravelly part of the upper  slopes of a wide valley, scantily sprinkled with blue _eryngiums_ and  a woolly species of _artemisia_, a very repulsive region, where herds  of camels, kept for breeding purposes, were grazing. On the other side  of this valley a spur of the fine mountain Jalanda projects, and on it  are the two villages and fort of Kalahoma, the residence of Taimur  Khan.    We halted below the hill while a spring was being searched for, and I  was sitting on horseback eating my lunch, a biscuit in one hand and a  cup in the other. I have mentioned the savagery of the horses, and  especially of _Hak[=i]m_, who has become like a wild beast. He was  standing fully four horse-lengths away from me, with his tail towards  me, and the guide had let go his bridle, when there was a roar or  squeal, and a momentary vision of glaring wild-beast eyes, streaming  mane, and open mouth rushing down upon me and towering above _Screw's_  head, and the next thing I remember is finding myself on the ground  with my foot in the stirrup and three men lifting me up.    I was a good deal shaken, and cut my arm badly, but mounted again, and  though falling on my head has given me a sickish headache for two  days, I have not absolutely required rest, and in camp there is no use  in \"making a fuss\"--if indeed there ever is.    I shall not have pleasant memories of this camp. The tents were  scarcely pitched before crowds assembled for medicine. I could get no  rest, for if I shut the tent the heat was unbearable, and if I opened  it there was the crowd, row behind row, the hindmost pushing the  foremost in, so that it was 8 P.M. before I got any food. Yesterday  morning at six I was awakened by people all round the tent, some  shaking the curtains and calling \"_Hak[=i]m! Hak[=i]m!_\" and though I  kept it shut till eleven, and raised the mercury to 115 deg. by doing so,  there was no rest.    From eleven o'clock till 9 P.M., except for one hour, when I was away  at the Khan's, I was \"seeing patients,\" wishing I were a real instead  of a spurious _Hak[=i]m_, for there was so much suffering, and some of  it I knew not how to relieve. However, I was able (thanks to St.  Mary's Hospital, London) to open three whitlows and two abscesses, and  it was delightful to see the immediate relief of the sufferers. \"God  is great,\" they all exclaimed, and the bystanders echoed, \"God is  great.\" I dressed five neglected bullet wounds, and sewed up a gash of  doubtful origin, and with a little help from Mirza prepared  eye-lotions and medicines for seventy-three people. I asked one  badly-wounded man in what quarrel he had been shot, and he replied  that he didn't know, his Khan had told him to go and fight.    In the afternoon several very distressed people were brought from an  Armenian village ten miles off, and were laid by those who brought  them at the tent door. At five the crowd was very great and the hubbub  inconceivable, and Mirza failed to keep order in the absence of Aziz  Khan, who had gone on a pilgrimage to a neighbouring _imamzada_. The  mercury had never fallen below 100 deg. I had been standing or kneeling  for six hours, and had a racking headache, so I reluctantly shut up my  medicine chest and went by invitation to call on the Khan's wives, but  the whole crowd surrounded and followed me, swelling as it moved  along, a man with a mare with bad eyes, which had been brought ten  miles for eye-lotion, increasing the clamour by his urgency. \"Khanum!  Khanum!\" (lady) \"Chashma!\" (eyes) \"Shikam!\" (stomach) were shouted on  all sides, with \"_Hak[=i]m! Hak[=i]m!_\" The people even clutched my  clothing, and hands were raised to heaven to implore blessings on me  if I would attend to them.    The whole village of Kalahoma was out, thronging, pressing, and almost  suffocating me, and the Khan's servants who came to meet me did not or  could not disperse the people, though every man holds his life at the  Khan's disposal. These villages, which are surrounded by opium fields,  are composed of the rudest of human habitations, built of rough  stones, the walls being only five feet high. There is much  subterranean room for cattle. The stacks of such winter fodder as  celery and _Centaurea alata_, and those of _kiziks_ for fuel, are  larger than the dwellings. The latter are of conical form, and many of  them are built on the house roofs.    Taimur Khan's fort and _serai_ are in the midst of all this, and are  very poor and ruinous, but the walls are high, and they have a  _balakhana_. As I approached the ladies came out to meet me, veiled in  white cotton _chadars_. The principal wife took my hand and led me  through a hole in the wall, not to be called a doorway, into a  courtyard littered with offal and piled with stacked animal fuel, and  up some high dilapidated steps, into a small dark room, outside of  which are a very small \"lobby\" and a blackened ladder against the  wall, leading to the roof, on which the ladies sleep in the hot  weather. Some poor rugs covered the floor, and there were besides some  poor cotton-covered bolsters. Everything, even the dress of the  ladies, indicated poverty. The dark hot room was immediately packed  with a crowd of women, children, and babies, all appallingly dirty. It  was a relief when the Khan was announced in the distance, and they  cleared out like frightened sheep, leaving only the four wives, who  stood up at his approach, and remained standing till he was seated.    No \"well-bred\" Khan would pay me a visit in his _andarun_ without  sending first with his \"homage\" to know if I would receive him, nor  did Taimur Khan violate this rule or the other of remaining standing  until I asked him to be seated. He is a tall, very melancholy-looking  man, with a Turkish cast of face, and is dressed in the usual Persian  style. After a few ordinary commonplaces he talked politics and tribal  affairs, _apparently_ frankly, but who can say if truthfully? He knows  that I have letters from the Prime Minister, and he hoped that I might  do him some good at Tihran. As soon as important subjects superseded  trifles, the wives relapsed into complete indifference, and stared  into vacancy.    His tribe, the Magawe, is estimated at 500 families, and has been  powerful. Taimur Khan is a staunch adherent of the Ilkhani, but at  this point there is a change as to the tribute, half of which is paid  to the Ilkhani and half to the Governor of Burujird. He has many  grievances, and complains most bitterly that he and his tribe are  being ground into poverty by exactions which, he asserts, have this  year raised the tribute from 700 to 4000 _tumans_.    He asks me to do something to help him, adding that his house is in  ruins, and that he is so oppressed that he cannot build a new one, or  have any surroundings suitable to his rank. I said that I could only  send his statements to the British \"Vakil\" in Tihran, and he at once  asked how many horses he should present him with. I replied that the  \"Vakil\" would not accept anything, and that he had lately declined a  superb diamond setting in which the Shah desired to send him his  picture. The Khan raised his hands, with the exclamation \"God is  great!\"    Isfandyar Khan and Taimur Khan were at war some years ago, and fought  from mountain to mountain, and Taimur Khan was eventually captured,  taken to Burujird, and sent to Isfahan, where he was kept in irons  for some years, the redoubtable Aziz Khan being one of his captors.  This accounts for the disappearance of Aziz on \"pilgrimage\" to a  neighbouring _imamzada_, and the consequent dulness of the camp.    Among a people at once simple and revengeful, it is not unlikely that  such severities may bear their legitimate fruit if an occasion  presents itself, such as the embroilment of Persia with any other  power. Another Khan who was thrown into prison and irons by the  Zil-es-Sultan expressed himself strongly on the subject. \"Five years,\"  he said, holding out his muscular wrists, on which the marks of  fetters are still visible, \"I wore the chains. Can I forget?\" The  Bakhtiaris do not love the Persians, and are held, I think, by a  brittle thread.    I have written of the extreme poverty of the surroundings of the Khaja  Taimur or Taimur Khan. It is not a solitary instance. Throughout this  journey I am painfully impressed with the poverty of the tribesmen. As  compared with the wealth of those farther south when visited by Sir A.  H. Layard and the Baron de Bode, their condition is one of  destitution. The Ilkhani and Ilbegi have fine studs, but few of the  Khans have any horses worth looking at, and for some time past none at  all have been seen except a few belonging to the chiefs, and the men  either walk or ride very small asses.    Their cattle are few and small and their flocks insignificant when  compared with those of the Arab tribes west of the Tigris. Their tents  and furnishings are likewise extremely poor, and they live poorly,  many of them only able to procure acorn flour for bread, and this  though they grow a great deal of grain,"]]]
