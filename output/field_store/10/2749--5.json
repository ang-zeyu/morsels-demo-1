These banks were chequered by patches  of dark verdure and shapeless masses of white marble, and crowned by  copses of cedar, or by the regular magnificence of orchards, which, at  this season, were in blossom, and were prodigal of odours. The ground  which receded from the river was scooped into valleys and dales. Its  beauties were enhanced by the horticultural skill of my brother, who  bedecked this exquisite assemblage of slopes and risings with every  species of vegetable ornament, from the giant arms of the oak to the  clustering tendrils of the honey-suckle.    To screen him from the unwholesome airs of his own residence, it had  been proposed to Pleyel to spend the months of spring with us. He had  apparently acquiesced in this proposal; but the late event induced him  to change his purpose. He was only to be seen by visiting him in his  retirements. His gaiety had flown, and every passion was absorbed in  eagerness to procure tidings from Saxony. I have mentioned the arrival  of another vessel from the Elbe. He descried her early one morning as  he was passing along the skirt of the river. She was easily recognized,  being the ship in which he had performed his first voyage to Germany.  He immediately went on board, but found no letters directed to him.  This omission was, in some degree, compensated by meeting with an old  acquaintance among the passengers, who had till lately been a resident  in Leipsig. This person put an end to all suspense respecting the fate  of Theresa, by relating the particulars of her death and funeral.    Thus was the truth of the former intimation attested. No longer devoured  by suspense, the grief of Pleyel was not long in yielding to the  influence of society. He gave himself up once more to our company. His  vivacity had indeed been damped; but even in this respect he was a more  acceptable companion than formerly, since his seriousness was neither  incommunicative nor sullen.    These incidents, for a time, occupied all our thoughts. In me they  produced a sentiment not unallied to pleasure, and more speedily than in  the case of my friends were intermixed with other topics. My brother was  particularly affected by them. It was easy to perceive that most of his  meditations were tinctured from this source. To this was to be ascribed  a design in which his pen was, at this period, engaged, of collecting  and investigating the facts which relate to that mysterious personage,  the Daemon of Socrates.    My brother's skill in Greek and Roman learning was exceeded by that of  few, and no doubt the world would have accepted a treatise upon this  subject from his hand with avidity; but alas! this and every other  scheme of felicity and honor, were doomed to sudden blast and hopeless  extermination.        Chapter VI      I now come to the mention of a person with whose name the most turbulent  sensations are connected. It is with a shuddering reluctance that I  enter on the province of describing him. Now it is that I begin to  perceive the difficulty of the task which I have undertaken; but it  would be weakness to shrink from it. My blood is congealed: and my  fingers are palsied when I call up his image. Shame upon my cowardly and  infirm heart! Hitherto I have proceeded with some degree of composure,  but now I must pause. I mean not that dire remembrance shall subdue my  courage or baffle my design, but this weakness cannot be immediately  conquered. I must desist for a little while.    I have taken a few turns in my chamber, and have gathered strength  enough to proceed. Yet have I not projected a task beyond my power to  execute? If thus, on the very threshold of the scene, my knees faulter  and I sink, how shall I support myself, when I rush into the midst of  horrors such as no heart has hitherto conceived, nor tongue related? I  sicken and recoil at the prospect, and yet my irresolution is momentary.  I have not formed this design upon slight grounds, and though I may at  times pause and hesitate, I will not be finally diverted from it.    And thou, O most fatal and potent of mankind, in what terms shall I  describe thee? What words are adequate to the just delineation of thy  character? How shall I detail the means which rendered the secrecy of  thy purposes unfathomable? But I will not anticipate. Let me recover  if possible, a sober strain. Let me keep down the flood of passion that  would render me precipitate or powerless. Let me stifle the agonies that  are awakened by thy name. Let me, for a time, regard thee as a being  of no terrible attributes. Let me tear myself from contemplation of  the evils of which it is but too certain that thou wast the author, and  limit my view to those harmless appearances which attended thy entrance  on the stage.    One sunny afternoon, I was standing in the door of my house, when I  marked a person passing close to the edge of the bank that was in  front. His pace was a careless and lingering one, and had none of that  gracefulness and ease which distinguish a person with certain advantages  of education from a clown. His gait was rustic and aukward. His form was  ungainly and disproportioned. Shoulders broad and square, breast sunken,  his head drooping, his body of uniform breadth, supported by long and  lank legs, were the ingredients of his frame. His garb was not ill  adapted to such a figure. A slouched hat, tarnished by the weather, a  coat of thick grey cloth, cut and wrought, as it seemed, by a country  tailor, blue worsted stockings, and shoes fastened by thongs, and deeply  discoloured by dust, which brush had never disturbed, constituted his  dress.    There was nothing remarkable in these appearances; they were frequently  to be met with on the road, and in the harvest field. I cannot tell why  I gazed upon them, on this occasion, with more than ordinary attention,  unless it were that such figures were seldom seen by me, except on the  road or field. This lawn was only traversed by men whose views were  directed to the pleasures of the walk, or the grandeur of the scenery.    He passed slowly along, frequently pausing, as if to examine the  prospect more deliberately, but never turning his eye towards the house,  so as to allow me a view of his countenance. Presently, he entered a  copse at a small distance, and disappeared. My eye followed him while  he remained in sight. If his image remained for any duration in my fancy  after his departure, it was because no other object occurred sufficient  to expel it.    I continued in the same spot for half an hour, vaguely, and by fits,  contemplating the image of this wanderer, and drawing, from outward  appearances, those inferences with respect to the intellectual history  of this person, which experience affords us. I reflected on the  alliance which commonly subsists between ignorance and the practice  of agriculture, and indulged myself in airy speculations as to the  influence of progressive knowledge in dissolving this alliance, and  embodying the dreams of the poets. I asked why the plough and the hoe  might not become the trade of every human being, and how this  trade might be made conducive to, or, at least, consistent with the  acquisition of wisdom and eloquence.    Weary with these reflections, I returned to the kitchen to perform some  household office. I had usually but one servant, and she was a girl  about my own age. I was busy near the chimney, and she was employed near  the door of the apartment, when some one knocked. The door was opened by  her, and she was immediately addressed with \"Pry'thee, good girl, canst  thou supply a thirsty man with a glass of buttermilk?\" She answered  that there was none in the house. \"Aye, but there is some in the dairy  yonder. Thou knowest as well as I, though Hermes never taught thee, that  though every dairy be an house, every house is not a dairy.\" To  this speech, though she understood only a part of it, she replied  by repeating her assurances, that she had none to give. \"Well then,\"  rejoined the stranger, \"for charity's sweet sake, hand me forth a cup  of cold water.\" The girl said she would go to the spring and fetch it.  \"Nay, give me the cup, and suffer me to help myself. Neither manacled  nor lame, I should merit burial in the maw of carrion crows, if I laid  this task upon thee.\" She gave him the cup, and he turned to go to the  spring.    I listened to this dialogue in silence. The words uttered by the person  without, affected me as somewhat singular, but what chiefly rendered  them remarkable, was the tone that accompanied them. It was wholly new.  My brother's voice and Pleyel's were musical and energetic. I had fondly  imagined, that, in this respect, they were surpassed by none. Now my  mistake was detected. I cannot pretend to communicate the impression  that was made upon me by these accents, or to depict the degree in which  force and sweetness were blended in them. They were articulated with a  distinctness that was unexampled in my experience. But this was not all.  The voice was not only mellifluent and clear, but the emphasis was so  just, and the modulation so impassioned, that it seemed as if an heart  of stone could not fail of being moved by it. It imparted to me an  emotion altogether involuntary and incontroulable. When he uttered the  words \"for charity's sweet sake,\" I dropped the cloth that I held in  my hand, my heart overflowed with sympathy, and my eyes with unbidden  tears.    This description will appear to you trifling or incredible. The  importance of these circumstances will be manifested in the sequel.  The manner in which I was affected on this occasion, was, to my own  apprehension, a subject of astonishment. The tones were indeed such as  I never heard before; but that they should, in an instant, as it were,  dissolve me in tears, will not easily be believed by others,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7937"],[0,"Journal of an African Cruiser (#10)"],[1," Sinoe--Account of a murder by the natives--Arrival at  Monrovia--Appearance of the town--Temperance--Law-suits and  Pleadings--Expedition up the St. Paul's river--Remarks on the cultivation  of sugar--Prospects of the coffee-culture in Liberia--Desultory  observations on agriculture.      _October_ 22.--At Sinoe. Mr. Morris, the principal man of the settlement,  came on board, in order to take passage with us to Monrovia. He informs us  that there are but seventy-two colonists here at present, but that nearly  a hundred are daily expected. Such an accession of strength is much needed  for the natives in the vicinity are powerful, and not very friendly, and  the colony is too weak to chastise them. Our appearance has caused them  some alarm. This is the place where the mate of an American vessel was  harpooned, some months since, by the Fishmen. We shall hold a palaver  about it, when the Commodore joins us.    We left Sinoe at 7 o'clock, P.M.    23. Mr. Morris has been narrating the circumstances of the murder of the  American mate, at Sinoe, in reference to which we are to \"set a palaver.\"  \"Palaver,\" by-the-by, is probably a corruption of the Portuguese word,  \"Palabra.\" As used by the natives, it has many significations, among which  is that of an open quarrel. To \"set a palaver,\" is to bring it to a final  issue, either by talking or fighting.    The story of the murder is as follows. A Fishman agreed to go down the  coast with Captain Burke, who paid him his wages in advance; on receiving  which, the fellow jumped overboard, and escaped. The captain then refused  to pay the sums due to two members of the same tribe, unless the first  should refund the money. Finding the threat insufficient, he endeavored to  entice these two natives on board his vessel, by promises of payment, but  ineffectually. Meanwhile, the mate going ashore with a colonist, his boat  was detained by the natives, during the night, but given up the next  morning, at the intercession of the inhabitants. The mate returned on  board, in a violent rage, and sent a sailor to catch a Fishman, on whom to  take vengeance. But the man caught a Tartar, and was himself taken ashore  as prisoner. The mate and cook then went out in a boat, and were attacked  by a war-canoe, the men in which harpooned the cook, and stripping the  mate naked, threw him overboard. They beat the poor fellow off, as he  attempted to seize hold of the canoe, and, after torturing him for some  time, at length harpooned him in the back. Captain Burke, having but one  man and two passengers left, made sail, and got away as fast as possible.    23.--Arrived at Monrovia, where we find the Porpoise, with six native  prisoners on board, who were taken at Berebee, as being concerned in the  murder of Captain Farwell and his crew, two years ago. To accomplish their  capture, the Porpoise was disguised as a barque, with only four or five  men visible on deck, and these in Scotch caps and red shirts, so as to  resemble the crew of a merchant-vessel. The first canoe approached, and  Prince Jumbo stepped boldly up the brig's side, but started back into his  boat, the moment that he saw the guns and martial equipment on deck. The  Kroomen of the Porpoise, however, jumped into the water and upset the  canoe, making prisoners of the four natives whom it contained. Six or  eight miles further along the coast, the brig being under sail, another  canoe came off with two natives, who were likewise secured. The Kroomen  begged to be allowed to kill the prisoners, as they were of a hostile  tribe.    28.--Leaving the ship in one of our boats, pulled by Kroomen, we crossed  the bar at the mouth of the Mesurado, and in ten minutes afterwards, were  alongside of the colonial wharf. Half-a-dozen young natives and colonists  issued from a small house to watch our landing; but their curiosity was  less intrusive and annoying, than would have been that of the same number  of New-York boys, at the landing of a foreign man-of-war's boat. On our  part, we looked around us with the interest which even common-place  objects possess for those, whose daily spectacle is nothing more varied  than the sea and sky. Even the most ordinary shore-scenery becomes  captivating, after a week or two on shipboard. Two colonists were sawing  plank in the shade of the large stone store-house of the colony. Ascending  the hill, we passed the printing-office of the Liberia Herald, where two  workmen were printing the colonial laws. The publication of the newspaper  had been suspended for nearly three months, to enable them to accomplish  work of more pressing importance. Proceeding onward, we came to the  Governor's house, and were received with that gentleman's usual courtesy.  The house is well furnished, and arranged for a hot climate; it is  situated near the highest point of the principal street, and commands from  its piazza a view of most of the edifices in Monrovia town.    The fort is on the highest ground in the village, one hundred feet above  the sea; it is of stone, triangular in shape, and has a good deal the  appearance of an American pound for cattle, but is substantial, and  adequate for its intended purposes. From this point, the street descends  in both directions. About fifty houses are in view. First, the Government  House, opposite to which stand the neat dwellings of Judge Benedict and  Doctor Day. Further on, you perceive the largest house in the village,  erected by Rev. Mr. Williams, of the Methodist mission. On the right is a  one-story brick house, and two or three wooden ones. A large stone  edifice, intended for a Court-House and Legislative Hall, has recently  been completed. The street itself is wide enough for a spacious pasture,  and affords abundance of luxuriant grass, through which run two or three  well-trodden foot-paths. Apart from the village, on the Cape, we discerned  the light-house, the base of which is about two hundred feet above the  sea.    We dined to-day at the New Hotel. The dinner was ill-cooked (an  unpardonable fault at Monrovia, where good cooks, formerly in the service  of our southern planters, might be supposed to abound), and not served up  in proper style. But there was abundance to eat and drink. Though the  keeper of the house is a clergyman and a temperance-man, ale, porter,  wine, and cherry-brandy, are to be had at fair prices. Three years ago, a  tavern was kept here in Monrovia by a Mr. Cooper, whose handbill set  forth, that \"nothing was more repugnant to his feelings than to sell  ardent spirits\"--but added--\"if gentlemen _will_ have them, the following  is the price.\" Of course, after such a salvo, Mr. Cooper pocketed the  profits of his liquor-trade with a quiet conscience. He used to tell me  that a little brandy was good for the \"suggestion;\" but I fear that he  made, in his own person, too large a demand upon its suggestive  properties; for his house is now untenanted and ruinous, and he himself  has carried his tender conscience to another settlement.    30.--Went ashore in the second cutter. The Kroomen managed her so  bunglingly, that, on striking the beach, she swung broadside to the sea.  In this position, a wave rolled into her, half-filled the boat, and  drenched us from head to foot. Apprehending that she would roll over upon  us, and break our limbs or backs, we jumped into the water, and waded  ashore.    While in the village, I visited the Court House, to hear the trial of a  cause involving an amount of eight hundred dollars. Governor Roberts acted  as judge, and displayed a great deal of dignity in presiding, and much  wisdom and good sense in his decision. This is the highest court of the  Colony. There are no regularly educated lawyers in Liberia, devoting  themselves exclusively to the profession; but the pleading seems to be  done principally by the medical faculty. Two Doctors were of counsel in  the case alluded to, and talked of Coke, Blackstone, and Kent, as  learnedly as if it had been the business of their lives to unravel legal  mysteries. The pleadings were simple, and the arguments brief, for the  judge kept them strictly to the point. An action for slander was  afterwards tried, in which the damages were laid at one hundred dollars.  One of the medico-jurisconsults opened the cause with an appeal to the  feelings, and wrought his own sensibilities to such a pitch as to declare,  that, though his client asked only for one hundred dollars, he considered  the jury bound in conscience to give him two. The Doctor afterwards told  me that he had walked eighty miles to act as counsel in this court. A  tailor argued stoutly for the defendant, but with little success; his  client was fined twenty dollars.    On our return, a companion and myself took passage for the ship in a  native canoe. These little vessels are scooped out of a log, and are of  even less size and capacity than the birch-canoes of our Indians, and so  light that two men, using each a single hand, may easily carry them from  place to place. Our weight caused the frail bark to sit so deep in the  water, that, before reaching the ship, we underwent another drenching.  Three changes of linen in one day are altogether too expensive and  troublesome.    _November_ 1.--Went up the St. Paul's river on a pleasure excursion, with  the Governor, and several men of lesser note. We touched at the public  farm, and found only a single man in charge. The sugar-cane was small in  size, was ill-weeded, and, to my eye, did not appear flourishing. The land  is apparently good and suitable, but labor is deficient, and my  impressions were not favorable in regard to the manner of cultivation. The  mill was exposed to the atmosphere, and the kettles were full of foul  water. We landed likewise at New Georgia, a settlement of recaptured  Africans. There was here a pretty good appearance, both of people and  farms. We called also at Caldwell, a rich tract of level land, of which a  "]]]
