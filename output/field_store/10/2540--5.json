These see the Name and the honor of God not  as it is, but through a painted glass, and measure truth or  righteousness according to the persons, and do not consider their  deceiving eye, which looks more on the person than on the thing. These  are hypocrites within and have only the appearance of defending the  truth. For they well know that there is no danger when one helps the  rich, the powerful, the learned and one's own friends, and can in turn  enjoy their protection and be honored by them.    Thus it is very easy to fight against the wrong which is done to popes,  kings, princes, bishops and other big-wigs. Here each wants to be the  most pious, where there is no great need. O how sly is here the  deceitful Adam with his demand; how finely does he cover his greed of  profit with the name of truth and righteousness and God's honor! But  when something happens to a poor and insignificant man, there the  deceitful eye does not find much profit, but cannot help seeing the  disfavor of the powerful; therefore he lets the poor man remain  unhelped. And who could tell the extent of this vice in Christendom?  God says in the lxxxii. Psalm, \"How long will ye judge unjustly, and  accept the persons of the wicked? Judge the matter of the poor and  fatherless, demand justice for the poor and needy; deliver the poor and  rid the forsaken out of the hand of the wicked.\" But it is not done,  and therefore the text continues: \"They know not, neither will they  understand; they walk on in darkness\"; that is, the truth they do not  see, but they stop at the reputation of the great, however unrighteous  they are; and do not consider the poor, however righteous they are.    XXX. See, here would be many good works. For the greater portion of the  powerful, rich and friends do injustice and oppress the poor, the  lowly, and their own opponents; and the greater the men, the worse the  deeds; and where we cannot by force prevent it and help the truth, we  should at least confess it, and do what we can with words, not take the  part of the unrighteous, not approve them, but speak the truth boldly.    What would it help a man if he did all manner of good, made pilgrimages  to Rome and to all holy places, acquired all indulgences, built all  churches and endowed houses, if he were found guilty of sin against the  Name and honor of God, not speaking of them and neglecting them, and  regarding his possessions, honor, favor and friends more than the truth  (which is God's Name and honor)? Or who is he, before whose door and  into whose house such good works do not daily come, so that he would  have no need to travel far or to ask after good works? And if we  consider the life of men, how in every place men act so very rashly and  lightly in this respect, we must cry out with the prophet, Omnis homo  mendax, \"All men are liars, lie and deceive\"; for the real good works  they neglect, and adorn and paint themselves with the most  insignificant, and want to be pious, to mount to heaven in peaceful  security.    But if you should say: \"Why does not God do it alone and Himself, since  He can and knows how to help each one?\" Yes, He can do it; but He does  not want to do it alone; He wants us to work with Him, and does us the  honor to want to work His work with us and through us. And if we are  not willing to accept such honor, He will, after all, perform the work  alone, and help the poor; and those who were unwilling to help Him and  have despised the great honor of doing His work, He will condemn with  the unrighteous, because they have made common cause with the  unrighteous. Just as He alone is blessed, but He wants to do us the  honor and not be alone in His blessedness, but have us to be blessed  with Him.  And if He were to do it alone, His Commandments would be  given us in vain, because no one would have occasion to exercise  himself in the great works of these Commandments, and no one would test  himself to see whether he regards God and His Name as the highest good,  and for His sake risks everything.    XXXI. It also belongs to this work to resist all false, seductive,  erroneous, heretical doctrines, every misuse of spiritual power. Now  this is much higher, for these use the holy Name of God itself to fight  against the Name of God. For this reason it seems a great thing and a  dangerous to resist them, because they assert that he who resists them  resists God and all His saints, in whose place they sit and whose power  they use, saying that Christ said of them, \"He that heareth you,  heareth Me, and he that despiseth you, despiseth Me.\" On which words  they lean heavily, become insolent and bold to say, to do, and to leave  undone what they please; put to the ban, accurse, rob, murder, and  practise all their wickedness, in whatever way they please and can  invent, without any hindrance.    Now Christ did not mean that we should listen to them in everything  they might say and do, but only then when they present to us His Word,  the Gospel, not their word, His work, and not their work. How else  could we know whether their lies and sins were to be avoided? There  must be some rule, to what extent we are to hear and to follow them,  and this rule cannot be given by them, but must be established by God  over them, that it may serve us as a guide, as we shall hear in the  Fourth Commandment.    It must be, indeed, that even in the spiritual estate the greater part  preach false doctrine and misuse spiritual power, so that thus occasion  may be given us to do the works of this Commandment, and that we be  tried, to see what we are willing to do and to leave undone against  such blasphemers for the sake of God's honor.    Oh, if we were God-fearing in this matter, how often would the knaves  of officiales have to decree their papal and episcopal ban in vain! How  weak the Roman thunderbolts would become! How often would many a one  have to hold his tongue, to whom the world must now give ear! How few  preachers would be found in Christendom!  But it has gotten the upper  hand: whatever they assert and in whatever way, that must be right.  Here no one fights for God's Name and honor, and I hold that no greater  or more frequent sin is done in external works than under this head. It  is a matter so high that few understand it, and, besides, adorned with  God's Name and power, dangerous to touch. But the prophets of old were  masters in this; also the apostles, especially St. Paul, who did not  allow it to trouble them whether the highest or the lowest priest had  said it, or had done it in God's Name or in his own.  They looked on  the works and words, and held them up to God's Commandment, no matter  whether big John or little Nick said it, or whether they had done it in  God's Name or in man's. And for this they had to die, and of such dying  there would be much more to say in our time, for things are much worse  now. But Christ and St. Peter and Paul must cover all this with their  holy names, so that no more infamous cover for infamy has been found on  earth than the most holy and most blessed Name of Jesus Christ!    One might shudder to be alive, simply because of the misuse and  blasphemy of the holy Name of God; through which, if it shall last much  longer, we will, as I fear, openly worship the devil as a god; so  completely do the spiritual authorities and the learned lack all  understanding in these things. It is high time that we pray God  earnestly that He hallow His Name. But it will cost blood, and they who  enjoy the inheritance of the holy martyrs and are won with their blood,  must again make martyrs.  Of this more another time.    I. We have now seen how many good works there are in the Second  Commandment, which however are not good in themselves, unless they are  done in faith and in the assurance of divine favor; and how much we  must do, if we take heed to this Commandment alone, and how we, alas!  busy ourselves much with other works, which have no agreement at all  with it. Now follows the Third Commandment: \"Thou shalt hallow the day  of rest.\" In the First Commandment is prescribed our heart's attitude  toward God in thoughts, in the Second, that of our mouth in words, in  this Third is prescribed our attitude toward God in works; and it is  the first and right table of Moses, on which these three Commandments  are written, and they govern man on the right side, namely, in the  things which concern God, and in which God has to do with man and man  with God, without the mediation of any creature.    The first works of this Commandment are plain and outward, which we  commonly call worship, such as going to mass, praying, and hearing a  sermon on holy days. So understood there are very few works in this  Commandment; and these, if they are not done in assurance of and with  faith in God's favor, are nothing, as was said above. Hence it would  also be a good thing if there were fewer saint's days, since in our  times the works done on them are for the greater part worse than those  of the work days, what with loafing, gluttony, and drunkenness,  gambling and other evil deeds; and then, the mass and the sermon are  listened to without edification, the prayer is spoken without faith. It  almost happens that men think it is sufficient that we look on at the  mass with our eyes, hear the preaching with our ears, and say the  prayers with our mouths. It is all so formal and superficial! We do not  think that we might receive something out of the mass into our hearts,  learn and remember something out of the preaching, seek, desire and  expect something in our prayer. Although in this matter the bishops and  priests, or they to whom the work of preaching is entrusted, are most  at fault, because they do not preach the Gospel, and do not teach the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/419"],[0,"The Magic of Oz (#10)"],[1,"the curious  animal in a sulky tone of voice.    \"Well,\" said Cap'n Bill, \"you've got to go home, anyhow, 'cause you  don't want to stay here, I take it.  And, when you get home, it  wouldn't worry you much to tell the Wizard what's happened to us.\"    \"That's true,\" said the cat, sitting on its haunches and lazily washing  its face with one glass paw.  \"I don't mind telling the Wizard--when I  get home.\"    \"Won't you go now?\" pleaded Trot.  \"We don't want to stay here any  longer than we can help, and everybody in Oz will be interested in you,  and call you a hero, and say nice things about you because you helped  your friends out of trouble.\"    That was the best way to manage the Glass Cat, which was so vain that  it loved to be praised.    \"I'm going home right away,\" said the creature, \"and I'll tell the  Wizard to come and help you.\"    Saying this, it walked down to the water and disappeared under the  surface.  Not being able to manage the raft alone, the Glass Cat walked  on the bottom of the river as it had done when it visited the island  before, and soon they saw it appear on the farther bank and trot into  the forest, where it was quickly lost to sight among the trees.    Then Trot heaved a deep sigh.    \"Cap'n,\" said she, \"we're in a bad fix.  There's nothing here to eat,  and we can't even lie down to sleep.  Unless the Glass Cat hurries, and  the Wizard hurries, I don't know what's going to become of us!\"          11.  The Beasts of the Forest of Gugu      That was a wonderful gathering of wild animals in the Forest of Gugu  next sunrise.  Rango, the Gray Ape, had even called his monkey  sentinels away from the forest edge, and every beast, little and big,  was in the great clearing where meetings were held on occasions of  great importance.    In the center of the clearing stood a great shelving rock, having a  flat, inclined surface, and on this sat the stately Leopard Gugu, who  was King of the Forest.  On the ground beneath him squatted Bru the  Bear, Loo the Unicorn, and Rango the Gray Ape, the King's three  Counselors, and in front of them stood the two strange beasts who had  called themselves Li-Mon-Eags, but were really the transformations of  Ruggedo the Nome, and Kiki Aru the Hyup.    Then came the beasts--rows and rows and rows of them!  The smallest  beasts were nearest the King's rock throne; then there were wolves and  foxes, lynxes and hyenas, and the like; behind them were gathered the  monkey tribes, who were hard to keep in order because they teased the  other animals and were full of mischievous tricks.  Back of the monkeys  were the pumas, jaguars, tigers and lions, and their kind; next the  bears, all sizes and colors; after them bisons, wild asses, zebras and  unicorns; farther on the rhinoceri and hippopotami, and at the far edge  of the forest, close to the trees that shut in the clearing, was a row  of thick-skinned elephants, still as statues but with eyes bright and  intelligent.    Many other kinds of beasts, too numerous to mention, were there, and  some were unlike any beasts we see in the menageries and zoos in our  country.  Some were from the mountains west of the forest, and some  from the plains at the east, and some from the river; but all present  acknowledged the leadership of Gugu, who for many years had ruled them  wisely and forced all to obey the laws.    When the beasts had taken their places in the clearing and the rising  sun was shooting its first bright rays over the treetops, King Gugu  rose on his throne.  The Leopard's giant form, towering above all the  others, caused a sudden hush to fall on the assemblage.    \"Brothers,\" he said in his deep voice, \"a stranger has come among us, a  beast of curious form who is a great magician and is able to change the  shapes of men or beasts at his will.  This stranger has come to us,  with another of his kind, from out of the sky, to warn us of a danger  which threatens us all, and to offer us a way to escape from that  danger.  He says he is our friend, and he has proved to me and to my  Counselors his magic powers.  Will you listen to what he has to say to  you--to the message he has brought from the sky?\"    \"Let him speak!\" came in a great roar from the great company of  assembled beasts.    So Ruggedo the Nome sprang upon the flat rock beside Gugu the King, and  another roar, gentle this time, showed how astonished the beasts were  at the sight of his curious form.  His lion's face was surrounded by a  mane of pure white hair; his eagle's wings were attached to the  shoulders of his monkey body and were so long that they nearly touched  the ground; he had powerful arms and legs in addition to the wings, and  at the end of his long, strong tail was a golden ball.  Never had any  beast beheld such a curious creature before, and so the very sight of  the stranger, who was said to be a great magician, filled all present  with awe and wonder.    Kiki stayed down below and, half hidden by the shelf of rock, was  scarcely noticed.  The boy realized that the old Nome was helpless  without his magic power, but he also realized that Ruggedo was the best  talker.  So he was willing the Nome should take the lead.    \"Beasts of the Forest of Gugu,\" began Ruggedo the Nome, \"my comrade and  I are your friends.  We are magicians, and from our home in the sky we  can look down into the Land of Oz and see everything that is going on.  Also we can hear what the people below us are saying.  That is how we  heard Ozma, who rules the Land of Oz, say to her people: 'The beasts in  the Forest of Gugu are lazy and are of no use to us.  Let us go to  their forest and make them all our prisoners.  Let us tie them with  ropes, and beat them with sticks, until they work for us and become our  willing slaves.'  And when the people heard Ozma of Oz say this, they  were glad and raised a great shout and said: 'We will do it!  We will  make the beasts of the Forest of Gugu our slaves!'\"    The wicked old Nome could say no more, just then, for such a fierce  roar of anger rose from the multitude of beasts that his voice was  drowned by the clamor.  Finally the roar died away, like distant  thunder, and Ruggedo the Nome went on with his speech.    \"Having heard the Oz people plot against your liberty, we watched to  see what they would do, and saw them all begin making ropes--ropes long  and short--with which to snare our friends the beasts.  You are angry,  but we also were angry, for when the Oz people became the enemies of  the beasts they also became our enemies; for we, too, are beasts,  although we live in the sky.  And my comrade and I said: 'We will save  our friends and have revenge on the Oz people,' and so we came here to  tell you of your danger and of our plan to save you.\"    \"We can save ourselves,\" cried an old Elephant.  \"We can fight.\"    \"The Oz people are fairies, and you can't fight against magic unless  you also have magic,\" answered the Nome.    \"Tell us your plan!\" shouted the huge Tiger, and the other beasts  echoed his words, crying: \"Tell us your plan.\"    \"My plan is simple,\" replied Ruggedo.  \"By our magic we will transform  all you animals into men and women--like the Oz people--and we will  transform all the Oz people into beasts.  You can then live in the fine  houses of the Land of Oz, and eat the fine food of the Oz people, and  wear their fine clothes, and sing and dance and be happy.  And the Oz  people, having become beasts, will have to live here in the forest and  hunt and fight for food, and often go hungry, as you now do, and have  no place to sleep but a bed of leaves or a hole in the ground.  Having  become men and women, you beasts will have all the comforts you desire,  and having become beasts, the Oz people will be very miserable.  That  is our plan, and if you agree to it, we will all march at once into the  Land of Oz and quickly conquer our enemies.\"    When the stranger ceased speaking, a great silence fell on the  assemblage, for the beasts were thinking of what he had said.  Finally  one of the walruses asked:    \"Can you really transform beasts into men, and men into beasts?\"    \"He can--he can!\" cried Loo the Unicorn, prancing up and down in an  excited manner.  \"He transformed ME, only last evening, and he can  transform us all.\"    Gugu the King now stepped forward.    \"You have heard the stranger speak,\" said he, \"and now you must answer  him.  It is for you to decide.  Shall we agree to this plan, or not?\"    \"Yes!\" shouted some of the animals.    \"No!\" shouted others.    And some were yet silent.    Gugu looked around the great circle.    \"Take more time to think,\" he suggested.  \"Your answer is very  important.  Up to this time we have had no trouble with the Oz people,  but we are proud and free, and never will become slaves.  Think  carefully, and when you are ready to answer, I will hear you.\"          12.  Kiki Uses His Magic      Then arose a great confusion of sounds as all the animals began talking  to their fellows.  The monkeys chattered and the bears growled and the  voices of the jaguars and lions rumbled, and the wolves yelped and the  elephants had to trumpet loudly to make their voices heard.  Such a  hubbub had never been known in the forest before, and each beast argued  with his neighbor until it seemed the noise would never cease.    Ruggedo the Nome waved his arms and fluttered his wings to try to make  them listen to him again, but the beasts paid no attention.  Some  wanted to fight the Oz people, some wanted to be transformed, and some  wanted to do nothing at all.    The growling and confusion had grown greater than ever when in a flash  silence fell on all the beasts present, the arguments were hushed, and  all gazed in astonishment at a strange sight.    For into the circle strode a great Lion--bigger and more powerful than  any other lion there--and on his back rode a little girl who smiled  fearlessly at the multitude of beasts.  And behind"]]]
