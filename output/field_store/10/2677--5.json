Tell me, Sir, immediately.'    \"'That large dog did it, Sir. He enticed him down to the shore by  playing with him, pretending to crouch and then run after him; and  then retreating and coaxing him to chase him; and when he got him near  the beach, he throttled him in an instant, and then scratched a hole  in the shingle and buried him, covering him up with the gravel. After  that he went into the water, and with his paws washed his head and  face, shook himself, and went up to the barracks. You will find the  terrier, just down there, Sir.'    \"'And sure enough there was the poor little fellow, quite dead, and  yet warm.    \"'In the mean time Thunder, who had watched our proceedings from a  distance, as soon as he saw the body exhumed, felt as if there was a  court-martial holding over himself, plunged into the harbour and swam  across to the town, and hid himself for several days, until he thought  the affair had blown over; and then approached me anxiously and  cautiously, lest he should be apprehended and condemned. As I was  unwilling to lose both my dogs, I was obliged to overlook it, and take  him back to my confidence. A strange story, ain't it, Mr Slick.'    \"'Well, it is,' sais I, 'but dogs do certainly beat all natur, that's  a fact.'    \"But to get back to the 'Black Hawk:' as soon as we anchored, I  proposed to Cutler that we should go ashore and visit the 'natives.'  While he was engaged giving his orders to the mate, I took the  opportunity of inquiring of the pilot about the inhabitants. This is  always a necessary precaution. If you require light-houses, buoys, and  sailing directions to enter a port, you want similar guides when you  land. The navigation there is difficult also, and it's a great thing  to know who you are going to meet, what sort of stuff they are made  of, and which way to steer, so as to avoid hidden shoals and  sand-bars, for every little community is as full of them as their  harbour. It don't do, you know, to talk tory in the house of a  radical, to name a bishop to a puritan, to let out agin smugglin' to a  man who does a little bit of business that way himself; or, as the  French say, 'to talk of a rope in a house where the squatter has been  hanged.' If you want to please a guest, you must have some of his  favourite dishes at dinner for him; and if you want to talk agreeably  to a man, you must select topics he has a relish for.    \"So,\" sais I, \"where had we better go, Pilot, when we land?\"    \"Do you see that are white one-story house there?\" said he. \"That is a  place, though not an inn, where the owner, if he is at home, will  receive the likes of you very hospitably. He is a capital fellow in  his way, but as hot as pepper. His name is Peter McDonald, and he is  considerable well to do in the world. He is a Highlander; and when  young went out to Canada in the employment of the North-west Fur  Company, where he spent many years, and married, broomstick fashion, I  suppose, a squaw. Alter her death he removed, with his two half-caste  daughters, to St John's, New Brunswick; but his girls I don't think  were very well received, on account of their colour, and he came down  here and settled at Ship Harbour, where some of his countrymen are  located. He is as proud as Lucifer, and so are his galls. Whether it  is that they have been slighted, and revenge it on all the rest of the  world, I don't know; or whether it is Highland and Indian pride mixed,  I ain't sartified; but they carry their heads high, and show a stiff  upper lip, I tell you. I don't think you will get much talk out of  them, for I never could.\"    \"Well, it don't follow,\" said I, \"by no manner of means, Eldad,  because they wouldn't chat to you, that they wouldn't open their  little mugs to me. First and foremost recollect, Mr Nickerson, you are  a married man, and it's no use for a gall to talk it into you; and  then, in the next place, you see you know a plaguey sight more about  the shape, make, and build of a craft like this than you do about the  figure-head, waist, and trim of a gall. You are a seaman, and I am a  landsman; you know how to bait your hooks for fish, and I know the  sort of tackle women will jump at. See if I don't set their clappers a  going, like those of a saw-mill. Do they speak English?\"    \"Yes,\" said he, \"and they talk Gaelic and French also; the first two  they learned from their father, and the other in Canada.\"    \"Are they pretty?\"    \"The eldest is beautiful,\" said he; \"and there is something in her  manner you can't help thinking she is a lady. You never saw such a  beautiful figure as she is in your life.\"    Thinks I to myself, \"that's all you know about it, old boy.\" But I  didn't say so, for I was thinking of Sophy at the time.    We then pushed off, and steered for Peter McDonald's, Indian Peter, as  the pilot said the fishermen called him. As we approached the house he  came out to meet us. He was a short, strong-built, athletic man, and  his step was as springy as a boy's. He had a jolly, open, manly face,  but a quick, restless eye, and the general expression of his  countenance indicated at once good nature and irascibility of temper.    \"Coot tay, shentlemen,\" he said, \"she is glad to see you; come, walk  into her own house.\" He recognised and received Eldad kindly, who  mentioned our names and introduced us, and he welcomed us cordially.  As soon as we were seated, according to the custom of the north-west  traders, he insisted upon our taking something to drink, and calling  to his daughter Jessie in Gaelic, he desired her to bring whiskey and  brandy. As I knew this was a request that on such an occasion could  not be declined without offence, I accepted his offer with thanks, and  no little praise of the virtues of whiskey; the principal  recommendation of which, I said, \"was that there was not a headache in  a hogshead of it.\"    \"She believes so herself,\" he said, \"it is petter ash all de rum,  prandy, shin, and other Yanke pyson in the States; ta Yankies are  cheatin smugglin rascals.\"    The entrance of Jessie fortunately gave a turn to this complimentary  remark; when she set down the tray, I rose and extended my hand to  her, and said in Gaelic, \"Cair mur tha thu mo gradh (how do you do, my  dear), tha mi'n dochas gam biel thu slan (I hope you are quite well).\"    The girl was amazed, but no less pleased. How sweet to the ear are the  accents of the paternal language, or the mother tongue as we call it,  for it is women who teach us to talk. It is a bond of union! Whoever  speaks it, when we are in a land of strangers, is regarded as a  relative. I shall never forget when I was in the bazaar at Calcutta,  how my heart leaped at hearing the voice of a Connecticut man as he  was addressing a native trader.    \"Tell you what, stranger,\" said he, \"I feel as mad as a meat axe, and  I hope I may be darned to all darnation, if I wouldn't chaw up your  ugly mummyised corpse, hair, hide, and hoof, this blessed minute, as  quick as I would mother's dough-nuts, if I warn't afraid you'd pyson  me with your atimy, I'll be dod drotted if I wouldn't.\"    Oh, how them homespun words, coarse as they were, cheered my drooping  spirits, and the real Connecticut nasal twang with which they were  uttered sounded like music to my ears; how it brought up home and  far-off friends to my mind, and how it sent up a tear of mingled joy  and sadness to my eye.    Peter was delighted. He slapped me on the back with a hearty good  will, in a way nearly to deprive me of my breath, welcomed me anew,  and invited us all to stay with him while the vessel remained there.  Jessie replied in Gaelic, but so rapidly I could only follow her with  great difficulty, for I had but a smattering of it, though I  understood it better than I could speak it, having acquired it in a  very singular manner, as I will tell you by and by. Offering her a  chair, she took it and sat down after some hesitation, as if it was  not her usual habit to associate with her father's visitors, and we  were soon on very sociable terms. I asked the name of the trading post  in the north-west where they had resided, and delighted her by  informing her I had once been there myself on business of John Jacob  Astor's New York Fur Company, and staid with the Governor, who was the  friend and patron of her father's. This was sufficient to establish us  at once on something like the footing of old friends. When she  withdrew, Peter followed her out, probably to give some directions for  our evening meal.    \"Well, well,\" said the pilot, \"if you don't beat all! I never could  get a word out of that girl, and you have loosened her tongue in rale  right down earnest, that's a fact.\"    \"Eldad,\" sais I, \"there is two sorts of pilotage, one that enables you  to steer through life, and another that carries you safely along a  coast, and there is this difference between them: This universal globe  is all alike in a general way, and the knowledge that is sufficient  for one country will do for all the rest of it, with some slight  variations. Now you may be a very good pilot on this coast, but your  knowledge is no use to you on the shores of England. A land pilot is a  fool if he makes shipwreck wherever he is, but the best of coast  pilots when he gets on a strange shore is as helpless as a child. Now  a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6124"],[0,"Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded (#10)"],[1,"seen it!--Mrs. Jervis, how long is she to be about this waistcoat?    Sir, said I, if your honour had pleased, I would have taken it with me;  and though it would be now finished in a few hours, I will do so still;  and remove this hated poor Pamela out of your house and sight for ever.    Mrs. Jervis, said he, not speaking to me, I believe this little slut has  the power of witchcraft, if ever there was a witch; for she enchants all  that come near her. She makes even you, who should know better what the  world is, think her an angel of light.    I offered to go away; for I believe he wanted me to ask to stay in my  place, for all this his great wrath: and he said, Stay here! Stay here,  when I bid you! and snatched my hand. I trembled, and said, I will! I  will! for he hurt my fingers, he grasped me so hard.    He seemed to have a mind to say something to me; but broke off abruptly,  and said, Begone! And away I tripped as fast as I could: and he and  Mrs. Jervis had a deal of talk, as she told me; and among the rest, he  expressed himself vexed to have spoken in Mr. Jonathan's hearing.    Now you must know, that Mr. Jonathan, our butler, is a very grave good  sort of old man, with his hair as white as silver! and an honest worthy  man he is. I was hurrying out with a flea in my ear, as the saying is,  and going down stairs into the parlour, met him. He took hold of my  hand (in a gentler manner, though, than my master) with both his; and he  said, Ah! sweet, sweet Mrs. Pamela! what is it I heard but just now!--I  am sorry at my heart; but I am sure I will sooner believe any body in  fault than you. Thank you, Mr. Jonathan, said I; but as you value your  place, don't be seen speaking to such a one as me. I cried too; and  slipt away as fast as I could from him, for his own sake, lest he should  be seen to pity me.    And now I will give you an instance how much I am in Mr. Longman's  esteem also.    I had lost my pen some how; and my paper being written out, I stepped  to Mr. Longman's, our steward's, office, to beg him to give me a pen  or two, and a sheet or two of paper. He said, Ay, that I will, my sweet  maiden! and gave me three pens, some wafers, a stick of wax, and twelve  sheets of paper; and coming from his desk, where he was writing, he  said, Let me have a word or two with you, my sweet little mistress: (for  so these two good old gentlemen often call me; for I believe they love  me dearly:) I hear bad news; that we are going to lose you: I hope it  is not true. Yes it is, sir, said I; but I was in hopes it would not be  known till I went away.    What a d---l, said he, ails our master of late! I never saw such an  alteration in any man in my life! He is pleased with nobody as I see;  and by what Mr. Jonathan tells me just now, he was quite out of the way  with you. What could you have done to him, tro'? Only Mrs. Jervis is a  very good woman, or I should have feared she had been your enemy.    No, said I, nothing like it. Mrs. Jervis is a just good woman; and,  next to my father and mother, the best friend I have in the world--Well,  then, said he, it must be worse. Shall I guess? You are too pretty, my  sweet mistress, and, may be, too virtuous. Ah! have I not hit it? No,  good Mr. Longman, said I, don't think any thing amiss of my master; he  is cross and angry with me indeed, that's true; but I may have given  occasion for it, possibly; and because I am desirous to go to my father  and mother, rather than stay here, perhaps he may think me ungrateful.  But, you know, sir, said I, that a father and mother's comfort is the  dearest thing to a good child that can be. Sweet excellence! said he,  this becomes you; but I know the world and mankind too well; though I  must hear, and see, and say nothing. And so a blessing attend my little  sweeting, said he, wherever you go! And away went I with a courtesy and  thanks.    Now this pleases one, my dear father and mother, to be so beloved.--How  much better, by good fame and integrity, is it to get every one's good  word but one, than, by pleasing that one, to make every one else one's  enemy, and be an execrable creature besides! I am, etc.            LETTER XXIII      MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,    We had a great many neighbouring gentlemen, and their ladies, this day,  at dinner; and my master made a fine entertainment for them: and Isaac,  and Mr. Jonathan, and Benjamin, waited at table: And Isaac tells Mrs.  Jervis, that the ladies will by and by come to see the house, and have  the curiosity to see me; for, it seems, they said to my master, when  the jokes flew about, Well, Mr. B----, we understand you have a  servant-maid, who is the greatest beauty in the county; and we promise  ourselves to see her before we go.    The wench is well enough, said he; but no such beauty as you talk of,  I'll assure ye. She was my mother's waiting-maid, who, on her death-bed,  engaged me to be kind to her. She is young, and every thing is pretty  that is young.    Ay, ay, said one of the ladies, that's true; but if your mother had not  recommended her so strongly, there is so much merit in beauty, that I  make no doubt such a fine gentleman would have wanted no inducement to  be kind to it.    They all laughed at my master: And he, it seems, laughed for company;  but said, I don't know how it is, but I see with different eyes from  other people; for I have heard much more talk of her prettiness, than  I think it deserves: She is well enough, as I said: but her greatest  excellence is, that she is humble, and courteous, and faithful, and  makes all her fellow-servants love her: My housekeeper, in particular,  doats upon her; and you know, ladies, she is a woman of discernment:  And, as for Mr. Longman, and Jonathan, here, if they thought themselves  young enough, I am told, they would fight for her. Is it not true,  Jonathan? Troth, sir, said he, an't please your honour, I never knew  her peer, and all your honour's family are of the same mind. Do you hear  now? said my master.--Well, said the ladies, we will make a visit to  Mrs. Jervis by and by, and hope to see this paragon.    I believe they are coming; and will tell you the rest by and by. I wish  they had come, and were gone. Why can't they make their game without me?    Well, these fine ladies have been here, and are gone back again. I would  have been absent, if I could, and did step into the closet: so they saw  me when they came in.    There were four of them, Lady Arthur at the great white house on the  hill, Lady Brooks, Lady Towers, and the other, it seems, a countess, of  some hard name, I forget what.    So Mrs. Jervis, says one of the ladies, how do you do? We are all come  to inquire after your health. I am much obliged to your ladyships,  said Mrs. Jervis: Will your ladyships please to sit down? But, said  the countess, we are not only come to ask after Mrs. Jervis's health  neither; but we are come to see a rarity besides. Ah, says Lady Arthur,  I have not seen your Pamela these two years, and they tell me she is  grown wondrous pretty in that time.    Then I wished I had not been in the closet; for when I came out, they  must needs know I heard them; but I have often found, that bashful  bodies owe themselves a spite, and frequently confound themselves more,  by endeavouring to avoid confusion.    Why, yes, says Mrs. Jervis, Pamela is very pretty indeed; she's but in  the closet there:--Pamela, pray step hither. I came out all covered with  blushes, and they smiled at one another.    The countess took me by the hand: Why, indeed, she was pleased to say,  report has not been too lavish, I'll assure you. Don't be ashamed,  child; (and stared full in my face;) I wish I had just such a face to be  ashamed of. O how like a fool I looked!    Lady Arthur said, Ay, my good Pamela, I say as her ladyship says: Don't  be so confused; though, indeed, it becomes you too. I think your good  lady departed made a sweet choice of such a pretty attendant. She would  have been mighty proud of you, as she always was praising you, had she  lived till now.    Ah! madam, said Lady Brooks, do you think that so dutiful a son as our  neighbour, who always admired what his mother loved, does not pride  himself, for all what he said at table, in such a pretty maiden?    She looked with such a malicious sneering countenance, I can't abide  her.    Lady Towers said with a free air, (for it seems she is called a wit,)  Well, Mrs. Pamela, I can't say I like you so well as these ladies do;  for I should never care, if you were my servant, to have you and your  master in the same house together. Then they all set up a great laugh.    I know what I could have said, if I durst. But they are ladies--and  ladies may say any thing.    Says Lady Towers, Can the pretty image speak, Mrs. Jervis? I vow she has  speaking eyes! O you little rogue, said she, and tapped me on the cheek,  you seem born to undo, or to be undone!    God forbid, and please your ladyship, said I, it should be either!--I  beg, said I, to withdraw; for the sense I have of my unworthiness  renders me unfit for such a presence.    I then went away, with one of my best courtesies; and Lady Towers said,  as I went out, Prettily said, I vow!--And Lady Brooks said, See that  shape! I never saw such a face and shape in my life; why, she must be  better descended than you have told me!    And so they run on for half an hour more in my praises, as I was told;  and glad was I, when I got out of the hearing of them.    But, it seems, they went down with such a story to my master, and so  full of me, that he had much ado to stand it; but as it was very little  to my reputation, I am sure I could take no pride in it; and I feared  it would make no better for me. This gives me another cause for wishing  myself out of this house.    This is Thursday morning, and next Thursday I hope to set out; for I  have finished my task, and my master is horrid cross! And I am vexed"]]]
