He got no more light on them then, and he was  still exercising his brains on them when he went to the inquest next  morning--to find the Coroner's court packed to the doors with an  assemblage of townsfolk just as curious as he was. And as he sat  there, listening to the preliminaries, and to the evidence of the first  witnesses, his active and scheming mind figured to itself, not without  much cynical amusement, how a word or two from his lips would go far  to solve matters. He thought of what he might tell--if he told all the  truth. He thought of what he might get out of Ransford if he, Bryce,  were Coroner, or solicitor, and had Ransford in that witness-box.  He would ask him on his oath if he knew that dead man--if he had had  dealings with him in times past--if he had met and spoken to him on that  eventful morning--he would ask him, point-blank, if it was not his hand  that had thrown him to his death. But Bryce had no intention of making  any revelations just then--as for himself he was going to tell just as  much as he pleased and no more. And so he sat and heard--and knew from  what he heard that everybody there was in a hopeless fog, and that in  all that crowd there was but one man who had any real suspicion of the  truth, and that that man was himself.    The evidence given in the first stages of the inquiry was all known to  Bryce, and to most people in the court, already. Mr. Dellingham told  how he had met the dead man in the train, journeying from London to  Wrychester. Mrs. Partingley told how he had arrived at the Mitre,  registered in her book as Mr. John Braden, and had next morning asked if  he could get a conveyance for Saxonsteade in the afternoon, as he  wished to see the Duke. Mr. Folliot testified to having seen him in the  Cathedral, going towards one of the stairways leading to the gallery.  Varner--most important witness of all up to that point--told of what he  had seen. Bryce himself, followed by Ransford, gave medical evidence;  Mitchington told of his examination of the dead man's clothing and  effects in his room at the Mitre. And Mitchington added the first  information which was new to Bryce.    \"In consequence of finding the book about Barthorpe in the suit-case,\"  said Mitchington, \"we sent a long telegram yesterday to the police  there, telling them what had happened, and asking them to make the most  careful inquiries at once about any townsman of theirs of the name of  John Braden, and to wire us the result of such inquiries this morning.  This is their reply, received by us an hour ago. Nothing whatever is  known at Barthorpe--which is a very small town--of any person of that  name.\"    So much for that, thought Bryce. He turned with more interest to the  next witness--the Duke of Saxonsteade, the great local magnate, a big,  bluff man who had been present in court since the beginning of the  proceedings, in which he was manifestly highly interested. It was  possible that he might be able to tell something of moment--he might,  after all, know something of this apparently mysterious stranger, who,  for anything that Mrs. Partingley or anybody else could say to the  contrary, might have had an appointment and business with him.    But his Grace knew nothing. He had never heard the name of John Braden  in his life--so far as he remembered. He had just seen the body of the  unfortunate man and had looked carefully at the features. He was not a  man of whom he had any knowledge whatever--he could not recollect ever  having seen him anywhere at any time. He knew literally nothing of  him--could not think of any reason at all why this Mr. John Braden  should wish to see him.    \"Your Grace has, no doubt, had business dealings with a good many people  at one time or another,\" suggested the Coroner. \"Some of them, perhaps,  with men whom your Grace only saw for a brief space of time--a few  minutes, possibly. You don't remember ever seeing this man in that way?\"    \"I'm credited with having an unusually good memory for faces,\" answered  the Duke. \"And--if I may say so--rightly. But I don't remember this  man at all--in fact, I'd go as far as to say that I'm positive I've  never--knowingly--set eyes on him in my life.\"    \"Can your Grace suggest any reason at all why he should wish to call on  you?\" asked the Coroner.    \"None! But then,\" replied the Duke, \"there might be many  reasons--unknown to me, but at which I can make a guess. If he was an  antiquary, there are lots of old things at Saxonsteade which he might  wish to see. Or he might be a lover of pictures--our collection is a bit  famous, you know. Perhaps he was a bookman--we have some rare editions.  I could go on multiplying reasons--but to what purpose?\"    \"The fact is, your Grace doesn't know him and knows nothing about him,\"  observed the Coroner.    \"Just so--nothing!\" agreed the Duke and stepped down again.    It was at this stage that the Coroner sent the jurymen away in charge of  his officer to make a careful personal inspection of the gallery in the  clerestory. And while they were gone there was some commotion caused  in the court by the entrance of a police official who conducted to the  Coroner a middle-aged, well-dressed man whom Bryce at once set down as  a London commercial magnate of some quality. Between the new arrival  and the Coroner an interchange of remarks was at once made, shared in  presently by some of the officials at the table. And when the jury came  back the stranger was at once ushered into the witness-box, and the  Coroner turned to the jury and the court.    \"We are unexpectedly able to get some evidence of identity, gentlemen,\"  he observed. \"The gentleman who has just stepped into the witness-box  is Mr. Alexander Chilstone, manager of the London & Colonies Bank, in  Threadneedle Street. Mr. Chilstone saw particulars of this matter in the  newspapers this morning, and he at once set off to Wrychester to tell  us what he knows of the dead man. We are very much obliged to Mr.  Chilstone--and when he has been sworn he will perhaps kindly tell us  what he can.\"    In the midst of the murmur of sensation which ran round the court, Bryce  indulged himself with a covert look at Ransford who was sitting opposite  to him, beyond the table in the centre of the room. He saw at once that  Ransford, however strenuously he might be fighting to keep his  face under control, was most certainly agitated by the Coroner's  announcement. His cheeks had paled, his eyes were a little dilated, his  lips parted as he stared at the bank-manager--altogether, it was more  than mere curiosity that was indicated on his features. And Bryce,  satisfied and secretly elated, turned to hear what Mr. Alexander  Chilstone had to tell.    That was not much--but it was of considerable importance. Only two  days before, said Mr. Chilstone--that was, on the day previous to his  death--Mr. John Braden had called at the London & Colonies Bank, of  which he, Mr. Chilstone, was manager, and introducing himself as having  just arrived in England from Australia, where, he said, he had been  living for some years, had asked to be allowed to open an account. He  produced some references from agents of the London & Colonies Bank, in  Melbourne, which were highly satisfactory; the account being opened, he  paid into it a sum of ten thousand pounds in a draft at sight drawn by  one of those agents. He drew nothing against this, remarking casually  that he had plenty of money in his pocket for the present: he did not  even take the cheque-book which was offered him, saying that he would  call for it later.    \"He did not give us any address in London, nor in England,\" continued  the witness. \"He told me that he had only arrived at Charing Cross that  very morning, having travelled from Paris during the night. He said that  he should settle down for a time at some residential hotel in London,  and in the meantime he had one or two calls, or visits, to make in the  country: when he returned from them, he said, he would call on me again.  He gave me very little information about himself: it was not necessary,  for his references from our agents in Australia were quite satisfactory.  But he did mention that he had been out there for some years, and had  speculated in landed property--he also said that he was now going to  settle in England for good. That,\" concluded Mr. Chilstone, \"is all I  can tell of my own knowledge. But,\" he added, drawing a newspaper from  his pocket, \"here is an advertisement which I noticed in this morning's  Times as I came down. You will observe,\" he said, as he passed it to  the Coroner, \"that it has certainly been inserted by our unfortunate  customer.\"    The Coroner glanced at a marked passage in the personal column of the  Times, and read it aloud:    \"The advertisement is as follows,\" he announced. \"'If this meets the eye  of old friend Marco, he will learn that Sticker wishes to see him  again. Write J. Braden, c/o London & Colonies Bank, Threadneedle Street,  London.'\"    Bryce was keeping a quiet eye on Ransford. Was he mistaken in believing  that he saw him start; that he saw his cheek flush as he heard the  advertisement read out? He believed he was not mistaken--but if he was  right, Ransford the next instant regained full control of himself and  made no sign. And Bryce turned again to Coroner and witness.    But the witness had no more to say--except to suggest that the bank's  Melbourne agents should be cabled to for information, since it was  unlikely that much more could be got in England. And with that the  middle stage of the proceedings ended--and the last one came, watched  by Bryce with increasing anxiety. For it was soon evident, from certain  remarks made by the Coroner, that the theory which Archdale had put  forward at the club in Bryce's hearing the previous day had gained  favour with the authorities, and that the visit of the jurymen to the  scene of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5311"],[0,"Parnassus on Wheels (#10)"],[1,"edge, and before I could  say a word he had vaulted over the off wheel and ran round behind  the van.    \"Look here sir,\" he said, with his little red beard bristling, \"your  sister is over age and acting of her own free will. By the bones of  the Baptist, I don't blame her for wanting a vacation if this is the  way you treat her. She is nothing to me, sir, and I am nothing to  her, but I propose to be a teacher to you. Put up your hands and  I'll give you a lesson!\"    This was too much for me. I believe I screamed aloud, and started  to clamber from the van. But before I could do anything the two  fanatics had begun to pummel each other. I saw Andrew swing savagely  at Mifflin, and Mifflin hit him square on the chin. Andrew's hat  fell on the road. Peg stood placidly, and Bock made as if to grab  Andrew's leg, but I hopped out and seized him.    It was certainly a weird sight. I suppose I should have wrung my  hands and had hysterics, but as a matter of fact I was almost  amused, it was so silly. Thank goodness the road was deserted.    Andrew was a foot taller than the Professor, but awkward, loosely  knit, and unmuscular, while the little Redbeard was wiry as a cat.  Also Andrew was so furious that he was quite beside himself, and  Mifflin was in the cold anger that always wins. Andrew landed a  couple of flailing blows on the other man's chest and shoulders,  but in thirty seconds he got another punch on the chin followed by  one on the nose that tumbled him over backward.    Andrew sat in the road fishing for a handkerchief, and Mifflin stood  glaring at him, but looking very ill at ease. Neither of them said a  word. Bock broke away from me and capered and danced about Mifflin's  feet as if it were all a game. It was an extraordinary scene.    Andrew got up, mopping his bleeding nose.    \"Upon my soul,\" he said, \"I almost respect you for that punch. But  by Jove I'll have the law on you for kidnapping my sister. You're a  fine kind of a pirate.\"    Mifflin said nothing.    \"Don't be a fool, Andrew\" I said. \"Can't you see that I want a  little adventure of my own? Go home and bake six thousand loaves of  bread, and by the time they're done I'll be back again. I think two  men of your age ought to be ashamed of yourselves. I'm going off to  sell books.\" And with that I climbed up to the seat and clucked to  Pegasus. Andrew and Mifflin and Bock remained standing in the road.    I was mad all the way through. I was mad at both men for behaving  like schoolboys. I was mad at Andrew for being so unreasonable,  yet in a way I admired him for it; I was mad at Mifflin for giving  Andrew a bloody nose, and yet I appreciated the spirit in which it  was done. I was mad at myself for causing all the trouble, and I was  mad at Parnassus. If there had been a convenient cliff handy I would  have pushed the old thing over it. But now I was in for it, and just  had to go on. Slowly I rolled up a long grade, and then saw Port  Vigor lying ahead and the broad blue stretches of the Sound.    Parnassus rumbled on with its pleasant creak, and the mellow sun and  sweep of the air soon soothed me. I began to taste salt in the wind,  and above the meadows two or three seagulls were circling. Like  all women, my angry mood melted into a reaction of exaggerated  tenderness and I began to praise both Andrew and Mifflin in my  heart. How fine to have a brother so solicitous of his sister's  welfare and reputation! And yet, how splendid the little, scrawny  Professor had been! How quick to resent an insult and how bold to  avenge it! His absurd little tweed cap was lying on the seat, and I  picked it up almost sentimentally. The lining was frayed and torn.  From my suit case in the van I got out a small sewing kit, and  hanging the reins on a hook I began to stitch up the rents as  Peg jogged along. I thought with amusement of the quaint life  Mr. Mifflin had led in his \"caravan of culture.\" I imagined him  addressing the audience of Whitman disciples in Camden, and wondered  how the fuss ended. I imagined him in his beloved Brooklyn,  strolling in Prospect Park and preaching to chance comers his gospel  of good books. How different was his militant love of literature  from Andrew's quiet satisfaction. And yet how much they really had  in common! It tickled me to think of Mifflin reading aloud from  \"Happiness and Hayseed,\" and praising it so highly, just before  fighting with the author and giving him a bloody nose. I remembered  that I should have spoken to Andrew about feeding the hens, and  reminded him of his winter undergarments. What helpless creatures  men are, after all!    I finished mending the cap in high good humour.    I had hardly laid it down when I heard a quick step in the road  behind me, and looking back, there was Mifflin, striding along with  his bald pate covered with little beads of moisture. Bock trotted  sedately at his heels. I halted Peg.    \"Well,\" I said, \"what's happened to Andrew?\"    The Professor still looked a bit shamefaced. \"The Sage is a  tenacious person,\" he said. \"We argued for a bit without much  satisfaction. As a matter of fact we nearly came to blows again,  only he got another waft of goldenrod, which started him sneezing,  and then his nose began bleeding once more. He is convinced that  I'm a ruffian, and said so in excellent prose. Honestly, I admire  him a great deal. I believe he intends to have the law on me. I  gave him my Brooklyn address in case he wants to follow the matter  up. I think I rather pleased him by asking him to autograph  'Happiness and Hayseed' for me. I found it lying in the ditch.\"    \"Well,\" I said, \"you two are certainly a great pair of lunatics. You  both ought to go on the stage. You'd be as good as Weber and Fields.  Did he give you the autograph?\"    He pulled the book out of his pocket. Scrawled in it in pencil were  the words \"I have shed blood for Mr. Mifflin. Andrew McGill.\"    \"I shall read the book again with renewed interest,\" said Mifflin.  \"May I get in?\"    \"By all means,\" I said. \"There's Port Vigor in front of us.\"    He put on his cap, noticed that it seemed to feel different, pulled  it off again, and then looked at me in a quaint embarrassment.    \"You are very good, Miss McGill,\" he said.    \"Where did Andrew go?\" I asked.    \"He set off for Shelby on foot,\" Mifflin answered. \"He has a grand  stride for walking. He suddenly remembered that he had left some  potatoes boiling on the fire yesterday afternoon, and said he must  get back to attend to them. He said he hoped you would send him a  postal card now and then. Do you know, he reminds me of Thoreau more  than ever.\"    \"He reminds me of a burnt cooking pot,\" I said. \"I suppose all my  kitchenware will be in a horrible state when I get home.\"        CHAPTER EIGHT      Port Vigor is a fascinating old town. It is built on a point jutting  out into the Sound. Dimly in the distance one can see the end of  Long Island, which Mifflin viewed with sparkling eyes. It seemed to  bring him closer to Brooklyn. Several schooners were beating along  the estuary in the fresh wind, and there was a delicious tang of  brine in the air. We drove direct to the station where the Professor  alighted. We took his portmanteau, and shut Bock inside the van to  prevent the dog from following him. Then there was an awkward pause  as he stood by the wheel with his cap off.    \"Well, Miss McGill,\" he said, \"there's an express train at five  o'clock, so with luck I shall be in Brooklyn to-night. My brother's  address is 600 Abingdon Avenue, and I hope when you're sending a  card to the Sage you'll let me have one, too. I shall be very  homesick for Parnassus, but I'd rather leave her with you than with  any one I know.\"    He bowed very low, and before I could say a word he blew his nose  violently and hurried away. I saw him carrying his valise into the  station, and then he disappeared. I suppose that living alone with  Andrew for all these years has unused me to the eccentricities of  other people, but surely this little Redbeard was one of the  strangest beings one would be likely to meet.    Bock yowled dismally inside, and I did not feel in any mood to sell  books in Port Vigor. I drove back into the town and stopped at a tea  shop for a pot of tea and some toast. When I came out I found that  quite a little crowd had collected, partly owing to the strange  appearance of Parnassus and partly because of Bock's plaintive cries  from within. Most of the onlookers seemed to suspect the outfit of  being part of a travelling menagerie, so almost against my will I  put up the flaps, tied Bock to the tail of the wagon, and began to  answer the humourous questions of the crowd. Two or three bought  books without any urging, and it was some time before I could get  away. Finally I shut up the van and pulled off, as I was afraid of  seeing some one I knew. As I turned into the Woodbridge Road I heard  the whistle of the five o'clock train to New York.    The twenty miles of road between Sabine Farm and Port Vigor was all  familiar to me, but now to my relief I struck into a region that I  had never visited. On my occasional trips to Boston I had always  taken the train at Port Vigor, so the country roads were unknown.  But I had set out on the Woodbridge way because Mifflin had spoken  of a farmer, Mr. Pratt, who lived about four miles out of Port  Vigor, on the Woodbridge Road. Apparently Mr. Pratt had several  times bought books from the Professor and the latter had promised to  visit him again. So I felt in duty bound to oblige a good customer.    After the varied adventures of the last two days it was almost a  relief to be alone to think things over. Here was I, Helen McGill,  in a queer case indeed. Instead of being home at Sabine Farm getting  supper, I was trundling along a strange road, the sole owner of a  Parnassus (probably the only one in existence), a horse, and a dog,  and a cartload of books on my hands."]]]
