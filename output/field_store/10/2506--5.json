Biol. Surv.  Coll.; obtained on July 17, 1899, by De Alton Saunders from Popof  Island, Shumagin Islands, Alaska. (Measured by C. Hart Merriam and  numbered 2210 in A. K. Fisher's catalog.)    _Range._--Southwestern Alaska from Seward Peninsula southeasterly to  western part of Kenai Peninsula and southwesterly to the southwestern  end of the Alaskan Peninsula.    _Diagnosis._--Size medium to small for the species; average and  extreme measurements of 6 specimens from King Cove, Alaska, are: total  length, 112.7 (107-118); tail, 48.3 (45-52); hind foot, 13.8 (13-14).  Tending toward the development of a tricolor pattern, the back  darkest, the sides buffy, and the venter paler.    _Comparisons._--Paler and more definitely tricolored than _S. v.  obscurus_; also with relatively shorter palate, narrower rostrum and  smaller teeth. For comparison with _S. v. alascensis_ see account of  that subspecies.    _Remarks._--_S. v. shumaginensis_ occurs together with _Sorex  cinereus_ over much of southwestern Alaska. Part of the range of  _shumaginensis_ falls within the tundra of the Arctic Life-zone. This  may be a partial explanation of the tricolored pattern of the animal.  _Sorex tundrensis_, _S. cinereus ugyunak_, and _S. cinereus haydeni_,  shrews which dwell mostly in treeless areas, are markedly tricolored,  or bicolored. _Sorex arcticus_, however, although tricolored, is found  in forested areas.    _Specimens examined._--Total number, 340.

Mus.,      79:15, December 31, 1912.    _Type._--Adult female, skin and skull; No. 23525/30943, U. S. Biol.  Surv. Coll.; obtained on August 26, 1890, by Vernon Bailey and B. H.  Dutcher from near Timber Creek, 8200 ft., Lemhi Mts., 10 mi. SSW  Junction (now Leadore), Lemhi Co., Idaho.    _Range._--Mountainous interior of western North America from central  Alaska east across Yukon and southwestern Northwest Territories to  northeastern Alberta, south in the mountains through north-central and  western Washington, Idaho, western Montana, Wyoming, Utah, and  Colorado, into northern New Mexico.    _Diagnosis._--Size medium to small for the species; average and  extreme measurements of 9 topotypes are: total length, 110.3  (105-117); tail, 46.4 (42-50); hind foot, 13.1 (12.5-13.5). Color  grayish or brownish gray in summer, light grayish in winter.    _Comparisons._--For comparisons with _S. v. setosus_, _S. v.  longicauda_, _S. v. alascensis_ and _S. v. shumaginensis_ see accounts  of those subspecies. Paler and slightly larger than S. v. soperi.  Larger than the subspecies from central Montana herein described as  new. Smaller than _S. v. neomexicanus_. Averaging larger in all  dimensions than _S. v. monticola_ with which _obscurus_ intergrades in  northern New Mexico and northern Arizona. Larger than _S. v. vagrans_  with more grayish rather than reddish fresh summer pelage and light  gray rather than dark grayish-black fresh winter pelage.    _Remarks._--Intergradation of _S. v. obscurus_ with _S. v. setosus_,  _S. v. longicauda_, _S. v. alascensis_, and the new subspecies from  Montana takes place in the usual way with specimens from intermediate  localities being intermediate in size and color. However the  relationship of _S. v. obscurus_ and _S. v. vagrans_ (as the latter  subspecies is defined in this study) is rather complicated. In  southern British Columbia where the two subspecies come together a  situation of remarkable complexity prevails. Series from some  localities seem to represent intergrades between _obscurus_ and  _vagrans_; from other localities some specimens seem to be referable  to one and some to the other subspecies; from other localities all  specimens seem referable to one subspecies. A similar situation is  seen in specimens from northeastern Washington, northern and central  Idaho, and extreme western Montana. The region mentioned is one of  extensive interfingering of life-zones. In southern British Columbia  the main axes of the rivers, valleys and mountain ranges are north and  south. Most of the valleys are in the Transition Life-zone; the  forests are rather dry and of pine with more or less isolated  hydrosere communities about streams and ponds. These hydrosere  situations are the habitat of _Sorex vagrans_. Shrews from these  situations are usually referable to _vagrans_. The high ridges and  mountain ranges are usually in the Canadian Life-zone or higher and  most of the shrews referable to _obscurus_ come from such places.  Marginal localities with regard to life-zone produce most of the  populations which seem to represent intergrades between the two  subspecies. Isolated areas of Canadian Life-zone, even though  surrounded with Transition Life-zone, often harbor a population of  _obscurus_, whereas the streams in the nearby dry valleys harbor  populations of _vagrans_. Farther south in the Rocky Mountain chain,  _obscurus_ seemingly intergrades regularly with _vagrans_. This  intergradation is seen in populations from several localities in Utah.  There the lower elevations west of the Wasatch and Uinta mountains  are inhabited by _S. v. vagrans_, the higher elevations by _obscurus_  and where the ranges of the two abut intergrading populations occur.  In these series of intergrades there are specimens which, using size  as a subspecific criterion, would unhesitatingly be assigned, as  individuals, to _obscurus_, and others would be assigned to _vagrans_,  but these individuals represent extremes of a normally variable  population. At Cuddy Mountain, Idaho, the two subspecies seemingly  abut without intergradation; anyhow the available specimens from this  locality are referable to one or the other subspecies and none is  intermediate. The situation just described understandably has been the  source of much anguish to students who sought to identify shrews from  the Rocky Mountains. The reason for the relationship just described  has been discussed at length in a previous section.    In the Rocky Mountains of Wyoming and Colorado the subspecies _S. v.  obscurus_ ranges almost uninterruptedly over relatively large areas,  but southward in New Mexico and southwestward into Utah and Arizona,  suitable boreal habitat becomes insular in nature and obscurus there  is confined to the higher mountains. With one exception, once the  shrew populations become 'insular' in this region they become smaller  and show intergradation with _Sorex vagrans monticola_. The exception  is the population in the Sacramento Mountains of southeastern New  Mexico which is larger than _obscurus_ and has been rightly recognized  as a distinct subspecies, _neomexicanus_.    Almost without exception the range of typical _Sorex vagrans obscurus_  is sympatric with that of _Sorex cinereus_, usually the subspecies _S.  c. cinereus_. So close is this correspondence that the presence of _S.  cinereus_ comes near to being a useful aid in identifying _S. v.  obscurus_. In areas where individuals of _obscurus_ show  intergradation with _vagrans_, _Sorex cinereus_ is absent or rare. The  implication is that as the species _S. vagrans_ approaches the size of  the species S. cinereus, competition between the two increases with  resultant displacement of _cinereus_.    _Specimens examined._--Total "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38398"],[0,"Amphibians and Reptiles of the Rainforests of Southern El Petén, Guatemala (#10)"],[1,"or _coralillo_.      =Bothrops atrox asper= (Garman)          15 km. NW of Chinaja, 1; Sayaxche, 1.    Although we found only two specimens, natives and workmen at the camp at  Chinaja stated that the _barba amarilla_, as this snake is known  locally, had been abundant when the camp had been established less than  two years before our visit.      =Bothrops nasutus= Bocourt          12 km. NW of Chinaja, 1.    This specimen, a male having a total length of 415 mm., was found on the  forest floor. The dorsum is brown with dark brown blotches separated  middorsally by a narrow orange-tan stripe extending from the nape to the  base of the tail. The belly is grayish tan with white flecks on the  lateral edges of the ventrals. The local name is _nahuyaca_.      =Bothrops nummifer nummifer= (Rueppell)          15 km. NW of Chinaja, 2; Sayaxche, 1.    Two individuals were found on the forest floor, and one adult, having a  total length of 953 mm., was removed from the stomach of a large  _Drymarchon corais melanurus_. There is considerable variation in color  and pattern. A juvenile (KU 58104), having a total length of 332 mm.,  has a tan dorsum with 19 interconnected dark brown, diamond-shaped,  middorsal blotches, the lateral extensions of which are black; the belly  is a cream-color with brown squares. An adult female (KU 55706), having  a total length of 779 mm., has a dorsal coloration like the preceding  specimen, except that the lateral extensions of the dorsal blotches are  brown; the belly is a uniform cream-color. A second adult female (KU  55707), having a total length of 953 mm., has a brown dorsum with 21  interconnected black, diamond-shaped, middorsal blotches, the lateral  extensions of which are black; the belly is a cream-color with black  squares.    The local name for this species is _braza de piedra_.      =Bothrops schlegeli schlegeli= (Berthold)          Paso Subin, 1.    This specimen was taken from the thatched roof of a house at the edge of  the forest and contained the remains of a small mammal. The local name  is _nahuyaca_.          HYPOTHETICAL LIST OF SPECIES      Listed below are thirteen species that have not been found in southern  El Peten but that probably occur there.          =_Dermophis mexicanus mexicanus_= (Dumeril and Bibron).--Natives        at Chinaja know caecilians, which they call _dos cabezas_.        This species has been taken in Tabasco and northern Chiapas.        Its occurrence in southern El Peten is expected. Less likely,        the caecilian known to the natives at Chinaja is _Gymnopis        oligozona_, which is known from Finca Volcan on the southern        slopes of the valley of the Rio Cahabon in Alta Verapaz.          =_Gastrophryne elegans_= (Boulenger).--This small fossorial frog        is known from Piedras Negras (Taylor and Smith, 1945:604), 12        miles east of Yaxha (Stuart, 1934:7), and Tikal (Stuart,        1958:18), all in northern and central El Peten. Two specimens        in the collection of the University of Kansas are from 28        kilometers northeast of Campur, Alta Verapaz. Probably the        species ranges throughout the forested lowlands of northern        Alta Verapaz and El Peten.          =_Mabuya brachypoda_= Taylor.--The absence of this widespread        lizard in our collections cannot be explained. Probably it        occurs in southern El Peten, for it is known in northern and        central El Peten and in Alta Verapaz.          =_Dendrophidion vinitor_= Smith.--This snake is known from        Piedras Negras, El Peten and from various localities in Alta        Verapaz; it is an inhabitant of humid forest and should occur        in southern El Peten.          =_Elaphe triaspis mutabilis_= (Cope).--The subspecies _E.        triaspis mutabilis_ is known from Alta Verapaz and _E.        triaspis triaspis_ from the Yucatan Peninsula, British        Honduras, and Uaxactun in northern El Peten. Because of the        much higher degree of resemblance between the faunas of        southern El Peten and Alta Verapaz as compared with southern        El Peten and Yucatan, _E. triaspis mutabilis_ would be        expected to occur in southern El Peten.          =_Ninia diademata nietoi_= Burger and Werler.--This snake is        known from Tikal and from Alta Verapaz; it is a small        cryptophile that probably occurs in southern El Peten.          =_Oxyrhophus petola aequifasciatus_= Werner.--This snake, which        probably is conspecific with _Oxyrhophus baileyi_ in southern        Veracruz, Mexico, is known from Tikal, British Honduras, and        Alta Verapaz; it is expected in southern El Peten.          =_Pliocercus elapoides salvini_= Mueller.--This species is        widespread in the Atlantic lowlands of southern Mexico and        northern Central America; the subspecies _P. elapoides        salvini_ occurs in Alta Verapaz and probably in southern El        Peten.          =_Rhadinaea decorata decorata_= (Guenther).--This is another        small cryptophile that is widespread on the Atlantic lowlands        from Mexico to Panama; it definitely is expected at places        like Chinaja in southern El Peten.          =_Scaphiodontophis annulatus_= (Dumeril and Bibron).--Three        subspecies of _Scaphiodontophis annulatus_ are recognized in        northern Central America: _S. annulatus annulatus_ from Alta        Verapaz, _S. annulatus hondurensis_ from northern Honduras,        and _S. annulatus carpicinctus_ from Piedras Negras and Tikal        in El Peten and from British Honduras. This rare and highly        variable species probably occurs in southern El Peten.          =_Tantilla schistosa schistosa_= (Bocourt).--This widespread        species in Central America is known from several localities in        Alta Verapaz and almost certainly occurs in southern El Peten.          =_Tropidodipsas sartori sartori_= Cope.--This fossorial species        has been collected in northern El Peten and in Alta Verapaz.        The natives at Chinaja described to me a _coral_ having orange        rings on a black body that likely was this species.          =_Micrurus elegans veraepacis_= Schmidt.--This species has been        collected at various localities in Alta Verapaz and in        Chiapas, inhabits areas like those in southern El Peten, and        probably occurs there.          SUMMARY      A study of the amphibians and reptiles in the rainforests of southern El  Peten, Guatemala, reveals the presence of 78 species; an additional 13  species probably occur there. In this tropical area having a high amount  of rainfall most of the species of amphibians and reptiles have  extensive ranges in the wet forests on the Atlantic lowlands of southern  Mexico and northern Central America; some species that more frequently  are found in sub-humid forests also occur.    Ecologically the fauna is divided into five major habitats--aquatic,  aquatic margin, fossorial, terrestrial, and arboreal. Forty-two per cent  of the 78 species are wholly or partly arboreal. The fauna is most  closely related to that in Alta Verapaz, Guatemala, but includes many  species that occur in the Tikal-Uaxactun area in northeastern Guatemala.    _Eleutherodactylus rostralis_ (Werner) and _E. rhodopis_ (Cope) are  redefined and their relationships are suggested. The color phases of  _Dryadophis melanolomus laevis_ and _D. m. alternatus_ are discussed;  _Dryadophis sanguiventris_ Taylor is synonymized with _Dryadophis  melanolomus alternatus_ (Bocourt).    The breeding habits, eggs, and tadpoles of the hylid frogs _Hyla  ebraccata_ and _Phyllomedusa callidryas taylori_ are described, as are  the eggs and juveniles of _Laemanctus deborrei_.
