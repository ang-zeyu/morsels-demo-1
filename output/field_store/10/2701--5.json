RUDENZ.  Oh heaven, what must I hear!    BERTHA.                 Say! what can lie  Nearer the good man's heart than friends and kindred?  What dearer duty to a noble soul  Than to protect weak, suffering innocence,  And vindicate the rights of the oppressed?  My very soul bleeds for your countrymen;  I suffer with them, for I needs must love them;  They are so gentle, yet so full of power;  They draw my whole heart to them. Every day  I look upon them with increased esteem.  But you, whom nature and your knightly vow,  Have given them as their natural protector,  Yet who desert them and abet their foes,  In forging shackles for your native land,  You--you it is, that deeply grieve and wound me.  I must constrain my heart, or I shall hate you.    RUDENZ.  Is not my country's welfare all my wish?  What seek I for her but to purchase peace  'Neath Austria's potent sceptre?    BERTHA.                   Bondage, rather!  You would drive freedom from the last stronghold  That yet remains for her upon the earth.  The people know their own true interests better:  Their simple natures are not warped by show,  But round your head a tangling net is wound.    RUDENZ.  Bertha, you hate me--you despise me!    BERTHA.  Nay! And if I did, 'twere better for my peace.  But to see him despised and despicable,--  The man whom one might love.    RUDENZ.                 Oh, Bertha! You  Show me the pinnacle of heavenly bliss,  Then, in a moment, hurl me to despair!    BERTHA.  No, no! the noble is not all extinct  Within you. It but slumbers,--I will rouse it.  It must have cost you many a fiery struggle  To crush the virtues of your race within you.  But, heaven be praised, 'tis mightier than yourself,  And you are noble in your own despite!    RUDENZ.  You trust me, then? Oh, Bertha, with thy love  What might I not become?    BERTHA.               Be only that  For which your own high nature destined you.  Fill the position you were born to fill;--  Stand by your people and your native land.  And battle for your sacred rights!    RUDENZ.  Alas! How can I hope to win you--to possess you,  If I take arms against the emperor?  Will not your potent kinsman interpose,  To dictate the disposal of your hand?    BERTHA.  All my estates lie in the Forest Cantons;  And I am free, when Switzerland is free.    RUDENZ.  Oh! what a prospect, Bertha, hast thou shown me!    BERTHA.  Hope not to win my hand by Austria's favor;  Fain would they lay their grasp on my estates,  To swell the vast domains which now they hold.  The selfsame lust of conquest that would rob  You of your liberty endangers mine.  Oh, friend, I'm marked for sacrifice;--to be  The guerdon of some parasite, perchance!  They'll drag me hence to the imperial court  That hateful haunt of falsehood and intrigue;  There do detested marriage bonds await me.  Love, love alone,--your love can rescue me.    RUDENZ.  And thou could'st be content, love, to live here,  In my own native land to be my own?  Oh, Bertha, all the yearnings of my soul  For this great world and its tumultuous strife,  What were they, but a yearning after thee?  In glory's path I sought for thee alone  And all my thirst of fame was only love.  But if in this calm vale thou canst abide  With me, and bid earth's pomps and pride adieu,  Then is the goal of my ambition won;  And the rough tide of the tempestuous world  May dash and rave around these firm-set hills!  No wandering wishes more have I to send  Forth to the busy scene that stirs beyond.  Then may these rocks that girdle us extend  Their giants walls impenetrably round,  And this sequestered happy vale alone  Look up to heaven, and be my paradise!    BERTHA.  Now art thou all my fancy dreamed of thee.  My trust has not been given to thee in vain.    RUDENZ.  Away, ye idle phantoms of my folly!  In mine own home I'll find my happiness.  Here where the gladsome boy to manhood grew,  Where every brook, and tree, and mountain peak,  Teems with remembrances of happy hours,  In mine own native land thou wilt be mine.  Ah, I have ever loved it well, I feel  How poor without it were all earthly joys.    BERTHA.  Where should we look for happiness on earth,  If not in this dear land of innocence?  Here, where old truth hath its familiar home,  Where fraud and guile are strangers, envy ne'er  Shall dim the sparkling fountain of our bliss,  And ever bright the hours shall o'er us glide.  There do I see thee, in true manly worth,  The foremost of the free and of thy peers,  Revered with homage pure and unconstrained,  Wielding a power that kings might envy thee.    RUDENZ.  And thee I see, thy sex's crowning gem,  With thy sweet woman grace and wakeful love,  Building a heaven for me within my home,  And, as the springtime scatters forth her flowers,  Adorning with thy charms my path of life,  And spreading joy and sunshine all around.    BERTHA.  And this it was, dear friend, that caused my grief,  To see thee blast this life's supremest bliss,  With thine own hand. Ah! what had been my fate,  Had I been forced to follow some proud lord,  Some ruthless despot, to his gloomy castle!  Here are no castles, here no bastioned walls  Divide me from a people I can bless.    RUDENZ.  Yet, how to free myself; to loose the coils  Which I have madly twined around my head?    BERTHA.  Tear them asunder with a man's resolve.  Whatever the event, stand by the people.  It is thy post by birth.       [Hunting horns are heard in the distance.                 But hark! The chase!  Farewell,--'tis needful we should part--away!  Fight for thy land; thou lightest for thy love.  One foe fills all our souls with dread; the blow  That makes one free emancipates us all.                     [Exeunt severally.        SCENE III.       A meadow near Altdorf. Trees in the foreground. At the back     of the stage a cap upon a pole. The prospect is bounded by     the Bannberg, which is surmounted by a snow-capped mountain.       FRIESSHARDT and LEUTHOLD on guard.    FRIESSHARDT.  We keep our watch in vain. There's not a soul  Will pass and do obeisance to the cap.  But yesterday the place swarmed like a fair;  Now the whole green looks like a very desert,  Since yonder scarecrow hung upon the pole.    LEUTHHOLD.  Only the vilest rabble show themselves,  And wave their tattered caps in mockery at us.  All honest citizens would sooner make  A tedious circuit over half the town  Than bend their backs before our master's cap.    FRIESSHARDT.  They were obliged to pass this way at noon,  As they were coming from the council house.  I counted then upon a famous catch,  For no one thought of bowing to the cap.  But Rosselmann, the priest, was even with me:  Coming just then from some sick penitent,  He stands before the pole--raises the Host--  The Sacrist, too, must tinkle with his bell--  When down they dropped on knee--myself and all  In reverence to the Host, but not the cap.    LEUTHOLD.  Hark ye, companion, I've a shrewd suspicion,  Our post's no better than the pillory.  It is a burning shame, a trooper should  Stand sentinel before an empty cap,  And every honest fellow must despise us,  To do obeisance to a cap, too! Faith,  I never heard an order so absurd!    FRIESSHARDT.  Why not, an't please thee, to an empty cap.  Thou'st ducked, I'm sure, to many an empty sconce.       [HILDEGARD, MECHTHILD, and ELSBETH enter with their children     and station themselves around the pole.    LEUTHOLD.  And thou art an officious sneaking knave,  That's fond of bringing honest folks to trouble.  For my part, he that likes may pass the cap  I'll shut my eyes and take no note of him.    MECHTHILD.  There hangs the viceroy! Your obeisance, children!    ELSBETH.  I would to God he'd go, and leave his cap!  The country would be none the worse for it.    FRIESSHARDT (driving them away).  Out of the way! Confounded pack of gossips!  Who sent for you? Go, send your husbands here,  If they have courage to defy the order.       [TELL enters with his crossbow, leading his son WALTER     by the hand. They pass the hat without noticing it, and     advance to the front of the stage.    WALTER (pointing to the Bannberg).  Father, is't true, that on the mountain there,  The trees, if wounded with a hatchet, bleed?    TELL.  Who says so, boy?    WALTER.            The master herdsman, father!  He tells us there's a charm upon the trees,  And if a man shall injure them, the hand  That struck the blow will grow from out the grave.    TELL.  There is a charm about them, that's the truth.  Dost see those glaciers yonder, those white horns,  That seem to melt away into the sky?    WALTER.  They are the peaks that thunder so at night,  And send the avalanches down upon us.    TELL.  They are; and Altdorf long ago had been  Submerged beneath these avalanches' weight,  Did not the forest there above the town  Stand like a bulwark to arrest their fall.    WALTER (after musing a little).  And are there countries with no mountains, father?    TELL.  Yes, if we travel downwards from our heights,  And keep descending in the rivers' courses,  We reach a wide and level country, where  Our mountain torrents brawl and foam no more,  And fair, large rivers glide serenely on.  All quarters of the heaven may there be scanned  Without impediment. The corn grows there  In broad and lovely fields, and all the land  Is fair as any garden to the view.    WALTER.  But, father, tell me, wherefore haste we not  Away to this delightful land, instead  Of toiling here, and struggling as we do?    TELL.  The land is fair and bountiful as Heaven;  But they who till it never may enjoy  The fruits of what they sow.    WALTER.                 Live they not free,  As you do, on the land their fathers left them?    TELL.  The fields are all the bishop's or the king's.    WALTER.  But they may freely hunt among the woods?    TELL.  The "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6791"],[0,"Mary Stuart: A Tragedy (#10)"],[1," Lord of Leicester.    LEICESTER.  You said you wished to speak with me in private.    MORTIMER.  Assure me first that I may safely venture.    LEICESTER.  Who gives me an assurance on your side?  Let not my want of confidence offend you;  I see you, sir, exhibit at this court  Two different aspects; one of them must be  A borrowed one; but which of them is real?    MORTIMER.  The selfsame doubts I have concerning you.    LEICESTER.  Which, then, shall pave the way to confidence?    MORTIMER.  He, who by doing it, is least in danger.    LEICESTER.  Well, that are you----    MORTIMER.             No, you; the evidence  Of such a weighty, powerful peer as you  Can overwhelm my voice. My accusation  Is weak against your rank and influence.    LEICESTER.  Sir, you mistake. In everything but this  I'm powerful here; but in this tender point  Which I am called upon to trust you with,  I am the weakest man of all the court,  The poorest testimony can undo me.    MORTIMER.  If the all-powerful Earl of Leicester deign  To stoop so low to meet me, and to make  Such a confession to me, I may venture  To think a little better of myself,  And lead the way in magnanimity.    LEICESTER.  Lead you the way of confidence, I'll follow.    MORTIMER (producing suddenly the letter).  Here is a letter from the Queen of Scotland.    LEICESTER (alarmed, catches hastily at the letter).  Speak softly, sir! what see I? Oh, it is  Her picture!       [Kisses and examines it with speechless joy--a pause.    MORTIMER (who has watched him closely the whole tine).         Now, my lord, I can believe you.    LEICESTER (having hastily run through the letter).  You know the purport of this letter, sir.    MORTIMER.  Not I.    LEICESTER.      Indeed! She surely hath informed you.    MORTIMER.  Nothing hath she informed me of. She said  You would explain this riddle to me--'tis  To me a riddle, that the Earl of Leicester,  The far-famed favorite of Elizabeth,  The open, bitter enemy of Mary,  And one of those who spoke her mortal sentence,  Should be the man from whom the queen expects  Deliverance from her woes; and yet it must be;  Your eyes express too plainly what your heart  Feels for the hapless lady.    LEICESTER.                 Tell me, Sir,  First, how it comes that you should take so warm  An interest in her fate; and what it was  Gained you her confidence?    MORTIMER.                My lord, I can,  And in few words, explain this mystery.  I lately have at Rome abjured my creed,  And stand in correspondence with the Guises.  A letter from the cardinal archbishop  Was my credential with the Queen of Scots.    LEICESTER.  I am acquainted, sir, with your conversion;  'Twas that which waked my confidence towards you.  [Each remnant of distrust be henceforth banished;]  Your hand, sir, pardon me these idle doubts,  I cannot use too much precaution here.  Knowing how Walsingham and Burleigh hate me,  And, watching me, in secret spread their snares;  You might have been their instrument, their creature  To lure me to their toils.    MORTIMER.                How poor a part  So great a nobleman is forced to play  At court! My lord, I pity you.    LEICESTER.                   With joy  I rest upon the faithful breast of friendship,  Where I can ease me of this long constraint.  You seem surprised, sir, that my heart is turned  So suddenly towards the captive queen.  In truth, I never hated her; the times  Have forced me to be her enemy.  She was, as you well know, my destined bride,  Long since, ere she bestowed her hand on Darnley,  While yet the beams of glory round her smiled,  Coldly I then refused the proffered boon.  Now in confinement, at the gates of death,  I claim her at the hazard of my life.    MORTIMER.  True magnanimity, my lord.    LEICESTER.                The state  Of circumstances since that time is changed.  Ambition made me all insensible  To youth and beauty. Mary's hand I held  Too insignificant for me; I hoped  To be the husband of the Queen of England.    MORTIMER.  It is well known she gave you preference  Before all others.    LEICESTER.            So, indeed, it seemed.  Now, after ten lost years of tedious courtship  And hateful self-constraint--oh, sir, my heart  Must ease itself of this long agony.  They call me happy! Did they only know  What the chains are, for which they envy me!  When I had sacrificed ten bitter years  To the proud idol of her vanity;  Submitted with a slave's humility  To every change of her despotic fancies  The plaything of each little wayward whim.  At times by seeming tenderness caressed,  As oft repulsed with proud and cold disdain;  Alike tormented by her grace and rigor:  Watched like a prisoner by the Argus eyes  Of jealousy; examined like a schoolboy,  And railed at like a servant. Oh, no tongue  Can paint this hell.    MORTIMER.             My lord, I feel for you.    LEICESTER.  To lose, and at the very goal, the prize  Another comes to rob me of the fruits  Of my so anxious wooing. I must lose  To her young blooming husband all those rights  Of which I was so long in full possession;  And I must from the stage descend, where I  So long have played the most distinguished part.  'Tis not her hand alone this envious stranger  Threatens, he'd rob me of her favor too;  She is a woman, and he formed to please.    MORTIMER.  He is the son of Catherine. He has learnt  In a good school the arts of flattery.    LEICESTER.  Thus fall my hopes; I strove to seize a plank  To bear me in this shipwreck of my fortunes,  And my eye turned itself towards the hope  Of former days once more; then Mary's image  Within me was renewed, and youth and beauty  Once more asserted all their former rights.  No more 'twas cold ambition; 'twas my heart  Which now compared, and with regret I felt  The value of the jewel I had lost.  With horror I beheld her in the depths.  Of misery, cast down by my transgression;  Then waked the hope in me that I might still  Deliver and possess her; I contrived  To send her, through a faithful hand, the news  Of my conversion to her interests;  And in this letter which you brought me, she  Assures me that she pardons me, and offers  Herself as guerdon if I rescue her.    MORTIMER.  But you attempted nothing for her rescue.  You let her be condemned without a word:  You gave, yourself, your verdict for her death;  A miracle must happen, and the light  Of truth must move me, me, her keeper's nephew,  And heaven must in the Vatican at Rome  Prepare for her an unexpected succour,  Else had she never found the way to you.    LEICESTER.  Oh, sir, it has tormented me enough!  About this time it was that they removed her  From Talbot's castle, and delivered her  Up to your uncle's stricter custody.  Each way to her was shut. I was obliged  Before the world to persecute her still;  But do not think that I would patiently  Have seen her led to death. No, Sir; I hoped,  And still I hope, to ward off all extremes,  Till I can find some certain means to save her.    MORTIMER.  These are already found: my Lord of Leicester;  Your generous confidence in me deserves  A like return. I will deliver her.  That is my object here; my dispositions  Are made already, and your powerful aid  Assures us of success in our attempt.    LEICESTER.  What say you? You alarm me! How? You would----    MORTIMER.  I'll open forcibly her prison-gates;  I have confederates, and all is ready.    LEICESTER.  You have confederates, accomplices?  Alas! In what rash enterprise would you  Engage me? And these friends, know they my secret?    MORTIMER.  Fear not; our plan was laid without your help,  Without your help it would have been accomplished,  Had she not signified her resolution  To owe her liberty to you alone.    LEICESTER.  And can you, then, with certainty assure me  That in your plot my name has not been mentioned?    MORTIMER.  You may depend upon it. How, my lord,  So scrupulous when help is offered you?  You wish to rescue Mary, and possess her;  You find confederates; sudden, unexpected,  The readiest means fall, as it were from Heaven,  Yet you show more perplexity than joy.    LEICESTER.  We must avoid all violence; it is  Too dangerous an enterprise.    MORTIMER.                 Delay  Is also dangerous.    LEICESTER.            I tell you, Sir,  'Tis not to be attempted----    MORTIMER.                 My lord,  Too hazardous for you, who would possess her;  But we, who only wish to rescue her,  We are more bold.    LEICESTER.            Young man, you are too hasty  In such a thorny, dangerous attempt.    MORTIMER.  And you too scrupulous in honor's cause.    LEICESTER.  I see the trammels that are spread around us.    MORTIMER.  And I feel courage to break through them all.    LEICESTER.  Foolhardiness and madness, is this courage?    MORTIMER.  This prudence is not bravery, my lord.    LEICESTER.  You surely wish to end like Babington.    MORTIMER.  You not to imitate great Norfolk's virtue.    LEICESTER.  Norfolk ne'er won the bride he wooed so fondly.    MORTIMER.  But yet he proved how truly he deserved her.    LEICESTER.  If we are ruined, she must fall with us.    MORTIMER.  If we risk nothing, she will ne'er be rescued.    LEICESTER.  You will not weigh the matter, will not hear;  With blind and hasty rashness you destroy  The plans which I so happily had framed.    MORTIMER.  And what were then the plans which you had framed?  What have you done then to deliver her?  And how, if I were miscreant enough  To murder her, as was proposed to me  This moment by Elizabeth, and which  She looks upon as certain; only name  The measures you have taken to protect her?    LEICESTER.  Did the queen give you, then, this bloody order?    MORTIMER.  She was deceived in me, as Mary is in you.    LEICESTER.  And have you promised it? Say, have you?    MORTIMER.  That she might not engage another's hand,  I offered mine.    LEICESTER.           Well done, sir; that was right;  This gives us leisure, for"]]]
