But this  Count de Saint Paul, this Constable, hath possessed himself by clean  conveyance of the town which takes its name from my honoured saint and  patron, Saint Quentin\" [it was by his possession of this town of  Saint Quentin that the Constable was able to carry on those political  intrigues which finally cost him so dear. S.] (here he crossed himself),  \"and methinks were I dwelling there, my holy patron would keep some  look out for me--he has not so many named after him as your more popular  saints--and yet he must have forgotten me, poor Quentin Durward, his  spiritual godson, since he lets me go one day without food, and leaves  me the next morning to the harbourage of Saint Julian, and the chance  courtesy of a stranger, purchased by a ducking in the renowned river  Cher, or one of its tributaries.\"    \"Blaspheme not the saints, my young friend,\" said Maitre Pierre. \"Saint  Julian is the faithful patron of travellers; and, peradventure, the  blessed Saint Quentin hath done more and better for thee than thou art  aware of.\"    As he spoke, the door opened, and a girl rather above than under fifteen  years old, entered with a platter, covered with damask, on which was  placed a small saucer of the dried plums which have always added to the  reputation of Tours, and a cup of the curiously chased plate which  the goldsmiths of that city were anciently famous for executing with a  delicacy of workmanship that distinguished them from the other cities of  France, and even excelled the skill of the metropolis. The form of the  goblet was so elegant that Durward thought not of observing closely  whether the material was of silver, or like what had been placed before  himself, of a baser metal, but so well burnished as to resemble the  richer ore.    But the sight of the young person by whom this service was executed  attracted Durward's attention far more than the petty minutiae of the  duty which she performed.    He speedily made the discovery that a quantity of long black tresses,  which, in the maiden fashion of his own country, were unadorned by  any ornament, except a single chaplet lightly woven out of ivy leaves,  formed a veil around a countenance which, in its regular features, dark  eyes, and pensive expression, resembled that of Melpomene [the Muse  of tragedy], though there was a faint glow on the cheek, and an  intelligence on the lips and in the eye, which made it seem that gaiety  was not foreign to a countenance so expressive, although it might not be  its most habitual expression. Quentin even thought he could discern that  depressing circumstances were the cause why a countenance so young and  so lovely was graver than belongs to early beauty; and as the romantic  imagination of youth is rapid in drawing conclusions from slight  premises, he was pleased to infer, from what follows, that the fate of  this beautiful vision was wrapped in silence and mystery.    \"How now, Jacqueline?\" said Maitre Pierre, when she entered the  apartment. \"Wherefore this? Did I not desire that Dame Perette should  bring what I wanted?--Pasques dieu!--Is she, or does she think herself,  too good to serve me?\"    \"My kinswoman is ill at ease,\" answered Jacqueline, in a hurried yet a  humble tone,--\"ill at ease, and keeps her chamber.\"    \"She keeps it alone, I hope!\" replied Maitre Pierre, with some emphasis;  \"I am vieux routier [one who is experienced in the ways of the world],  and none of those upon whom feigned disorders pass for apologies.\"    Jacqueline turned pale, and even tottered at the answer of Maitre  Pierre; for it must be owned that his voice and looks, at all times  harsh, caustic, and unpleasing, had, when he expressed anger or  suspicion, an effect both sinister and alarming.    The mountain chivalry of Quentin Durward was instantly awakened, and he  hastened to approach Jacqueline and relieve her of the burden she bore,  and which she passively resigned to him, while, with a timid and anxious  look, she watched the countenance of the angry burgess. It was not in  nature to resist the piercing and pity craving expression of her looks,  and Maitre Pierre proceeded, not merely with an air of diminished  displeasure, but with as much gentleness as he could assume in  countenance and manner, \"I blame not thee, Jacqueline, and thou art too  young to be, what it is pity to think thou must be one day--a false and  treacherous thing, like the rest of thy giddy sex. No man ever lived  to man's estate, but he had the opportunity to know you all [he (Louis)  entertained great contempt for the understanding, and not less for the  character, of the fair sex. S.]. Here is a Scottish cavalier will tell  you the same.\"    Jacqueline looked for an instant on the young stranger, as if to obey  Maitre Pierre, but the glance, momentary as it was, appeared to  Durward a pathetic appeal to him for support and sympathy; and with  the promptitude dictated by the feelings of youth, and the romantic  veneration for the female sex inspired by his education, he answered  hastily that he would throw down his gage to any antagonist, of equal  rank and equal age, who should presume to say such a countenance as that  which he now looked upon, could be animated by other than the purest and  the truest mind.    The young woman grew deadly pale, and cast an apprehensive glance upon  Maitre Pierre, in whom the bravado of the young gallant seemed only to  excite laughter, more scornful than applausive. Quentin, whose second  thoughts generally corrected the first, though sometimes after they  had found utterance, blushed deeply at having uttered what might be  construed into an empty boast in presence of an old man of a peaceful  profession; and as a sort of just and appropriate penance, resolved  patiently to submit to the ridicule which he had incurred. He offered  the cup and trencher to Maitre Pierre with a blush in his cheek, and a  humiliation of countenance which endeavoured to disguise itself under an  embarrassed smile.    \"You are a foolish young man,\" said Maitre Pierre, \"and know as little  of women as of princes,--whose hearts,\" he said, crossing himself  devoutly, \"God keeps in his right hand.\"    \"And who keeps those of the women, then?\" said Quentin, resolved, if he  could help it, not to be borne down by the assumed superiority of this  extraordinary old man, whose lofty and careless manner possessed an  influence over him of which he felt ashamed.    \"I am afraid you must ask of them in another quarter,\" said Maitre  Pierre, composedly.    Quentin was again rebuffed, but not utterly disconcerted. \"Surely,\"  he said to himself, \"I do not pay this same burgess of Tours all the  deference which I yield him, on account of the miserable obligation of  a breakfast, though it was a right good and substantial meal. Dogs and  hawks are attached by feeding only--man must have kindness, if you  would bind him with the cords of affection and obligation. But he is  an extraordinary person; and that beautiful emanation that is even  now vanishing--surely a thing so fair belongs not to this mean place,  belongs not even to the money gathering merchant himself, though he  seems to exert authority over her, as doubtless he does over all whom  chance brings within his little circle. It is wonderful what ideas of  consequence these Flemings and Frenchmen attach to wealth--so much  more than wealth deserves, that I suppose this old merchant thinks the  civility I pay to his age is given to his money. I a Scottish gentleman  of blood and coat armour, and he a mechanic of Tours!\"    Such were the thoughts which hastily traversed the mind of young  Durward; while Maitre Pierre said with a smile, and at the same time  patting Jacqueline's heed, from which hung down her long tresses, \"This  young man will serve me, Jacqueline, thou mayst withdraw. I will tell  thy negligent kinswoman she does ill to expose thee to be gazed on  unnecessarily.\"    \"It was only to wait on you,\" said the maiden. \"I trust you will not be  displeased with my kinswoman, since\"--    \"Pasques dieu!\" said the merchant, interrupting her, but not harshly,  \"do you bandy words with me, you brat, or stay you to gaze upon the  youngster here?--Begone--he is noble, and his services will suffice me.\"    Jacqueline vanished; and so much was Quentin Durward interested in her  sudden disappearance that it broke his previous thread of reflection,  and he complied mechanically when Maitre Pierre said, in the tone of  one accustomed to be obeyed, as he threw himself carelessly upon a large  easy chair, \"Place that tray beside me.\"    The merchant then let his dark eyebrows sink over his keen eyes so that  the last became scarce visible, or but shot forth occasionally a quick  and vivid ray, like those of the sun setting behind a dark cloud,  through which its beams are occasionally darted, but singly and for an  instant.    \"That is a beautiful creature,\" said the old man at last, raising  his head, and looking steadily and firmly at Quentin, when he put the  question,--\"a lovely girl to be the servant of an auberge [an inn]? She  might grace the board of an honest burgess; but 'tis a vile education, a  base origin.\"    It sometimes happens that a chance shot will demolish a noble castle in  the air, and the architect on such occasions entertains little goodwill  towards him who fires it, although the damage on the offender's part may  be wholly unintentional. Quentin was disconcerted, and was disposed to  be angry--he himself knew not why--with this old man, for acquainting  him that this beautiful creature was neither more nor less than what  her occupation announced; the servant of the auberge--an upper servant,  indeed, and probably a niece of the landlord, or such like; but still  a domestic, and obliged to comply with the humour of the customers, and  particularly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7864"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#10)"],[1," effect the death of Bhishma. In this, Krishna also smote with piercing  words Arjuna, the bearer of the Gandiva and the foremost in battle among  all wielders of weapons. In this, the foremost of bowmen, Arjuna, placing  Shikandin before him and piercing Bhishma with his sharpest arrows felled  him from his chariot. In this, Bhishma lay stretched on his bed of arrows.  This extensive Parva is known as the sixth in the Bharata. In this have  been composed one hundred and seventeen sections. The number of slokas is  five thousand, eight hundred and eighty-four as told by Vyasa conversant  with the Vedas.    \"Then is recited the wonderful Parva called Drona full of incidents. First  comes the installation in the command of the army of the great instructor  in arms, Drona: then the vow made by that great master of weapons of  seizing the wise Yudhishthira in battle to please Duryodhana; then the  retreat of Arjuna from the field before the Sansaptakas, then the  overthrow of Bhagadatta like to a second Indra in the field, with the  elephant Supritika, by Arjuna; then the death of the hero Abhimanyu in his  teens, alone and unsupported, at the hands of many Maharathas including  Jayadratha; then after the death of Abhimanyu, the destruction by Arjuna,  in battle of seven Akshauhinis of troops and then of Jayadratha; then the  entry, by Bhima of mighty arms and by that foremost of warriors-in-chariot,  Satyaki, into the Kaurava ranks impenetrable even to the gods, in search  of Arjuna in obedience to the orders of Yudhishthira, and the destruction  of the remnant of the Sansaptakas. In the Drona Parva, is the death of  Alambusha, of Srutayus, of Jalasandha, of Shomadatta, of Virata, of the  great warrior-in-chariot Drupada, of Ghatotkacha and others; in this Parva,  Aswatthaman, excited beyond measure at the fall of his father in battle,  discharged the terrible weapon Narayana. Then the glory of Rudra in  connection with the burning (of the three cities). Then the arrival of  Vyasa and recital by him of the glory of Krishna and Arjuna. This is the  great seventh Parva of the Bharata in which all the heroic chiefs and  princes mentioned were sent to their account. The number of sections in  this is one hundred and seventy. The number of slokas as composed in the  Drona Parva by Rishi Vyasa, the son of Parasara and the possessor of true  knowledge after much meditation, is eight thousand, nine hundred and nine.    \"Then comes the most wonderful Parva called Karna. In this is narrated the  appointment of the wise king of Madra as (Karna's) charioteer. Then the  history of the fall of the Asura Tripura. Then the application to each  other by Karna and Salya of harsh words on their setting out for the field,  then the story of the swan and the crow recited in insulting allusion:  then the death of Pandya at the hands of the high-souled Aswatthaman; then  the death of Dandasena; then that of Darda; then Yudhishthira's imminent  risk in single combat with Karna in the presence of all the warriors; then  the mutual wrath of Yudhishthira and Arjuna; then Krishna's pacification  of Arjuna. In this Parva, Bhima, in fulfilment of his vow, having ripped  open Dussasana's breast in battle drank the blood of his heart. Then  Arjuna slew the great Karna in single combat. Readers of the Bharata call  this the eighth Parva. The number of sections in this is sixty-nine and  the number of slokas is four thousand, nine hundred and sixty-tour.    \"Then hath been recited the wonderful Parva called Salya. After all the  great warriors had been slain, the king of Madra became the leader of the  (Kaurava) army. The encounters one after another, of charioteers, have  been here described. Then comes the fall of the great Salya at the hands  of Yudhishthira, the Just. Here also is the death of Sakuni in battle at  the hands of Sahadeva. Upon only a small remnant of the troops remaining  alive after the immense slaughter, Duryodhana went to the lake and  creating for himself room within its waters lay stretched there for some  time. Then is narrated the receipt of this intelligence by Bhima from the  fowlers: then is narrated how, moved by the insulting speeches of the  intelligent Yudhishthira, Duryodhana ever unable to bear affronts, came  out of the waters. Then comes the encounter with clubs, between Duryodhana  and Bhima; then the arrival, at the time of such encounter, of Balarama:  then is described the sacredness of the Saraswati; then the progress of  the encounter with clubs; then the fracture of Duryodhana's thighs in  battle by Bhima with (a terrific hurl of) his mace. These all have been  described in the wonderful ninth Parva. In this the number of sections is  fifty-nine and the number of slokas composed by the great Vyasa--the  spreader of the fame of the Kauravas--is three thousand, two hundred and  twenty.    \"Then shall I describe the Parva called Sauptika of frightful incidents.  On the Pandavas having gone away, the mighty charioteers, Kritavarman,  Kripa, and the son of Drona, came to the field of battle in the evening  and there saw king Duryodhana lying on the ground, his thighs broken, and  himself covered with blood. Then the great charioteer, the son of Drona,  of terrible wrath, vowed, 'without killing all the Panchalas including  Drishtadyumna, and the Pandavas also with all their allies, I will not  take off armour.' Having spoken those words, the three warriors leaving  Duryodhana's side entered the great forest just as the sun was setting.  While sitting under a large banian tree in the night, they saw an owl  killing numerous crows one after another. At the sight of this,  Aswatthaman, his heart full of rage at the thought of his father's fate,  resolved to slay the slumbering Panchalas. And wending to the gate of the  camp, he saw there a Rakshasa of frightful visage, his head reaching to  the very heavens, guarding the entrance. And seeing that Rakshasa  obstructing all his weapons, the son of Drona speedily pacified by worship  the three-eyed Rudra. And then accompanied by Kritavarman and Kripa he  slew all the sons of Draupadi, all the Panchalas with Dhrishtadyumna and  others, together with their relatives, slumbering unsuspectingly in the  night. All perished on that fatal night except the five Pandavas and the  great warrior Satyaki. Those escaped owing to Krishna's counsels, then the  charioteer of Dhrishtadyumna brought to the Pandavas intelligence of the  slaughter of the slumbering Panchalas by the son of Drona. Then Draupadi  distressed at the death of her sons and brothers and father sat before her  lords resolved to kill herself by fasting. Then Bhima of terrible prowess,  moved by the words of Draupadi, resolved, to please her; and speedily  taking up his mace followed in wrath the son of his preceptor in arms. The  son of Drona from fear of Bhimasena and impelled by the fates and moved  also by anger discharged a celestial weapon saying, 'This is for the  destruction of all the Pandavas'; then Krishna saying. 'This shall not be',  neutralised Aswatthaman's speech. Then Arjuna neutralised that weapon by  one of his own. Seeing the wicked Aswatthaman's destructive intentions,  Dwaipayana and Krishna pronounced curses on him which the latter returned.  Pandava then deprived the mighty warrior-in-chariot Aswatthaman, of the  jewel on his head, and became exceedingly glad, and, boastful of their  success, made a present of it to the sorrowing Draupadi. Thus the tenth  Parva, called Sauptika, is recited. The great Vyasa hath composed this in  eighteen sections. The number of slokas also composed (in this) by the  great reciter of sacred truths is eight hundred and seventy. In this Parva  has been put together by the great Rishi the two Parvas called Sauptika  and Aishika.    \"After this hath been recited the highly pathetic Parva called Stri,  Dhritarashtra of prophetic eye, afflicted at the death of his children,  and moved by enmity towards Bhima, broke into pieces a statue of hard iron  deftly placed before him by Krishna (as substitute of Bhima). Then Vidura,  removing the distressed Dhritarashtra's affection for worldly things by  reasons pointing to final release, consoled that wise monarch. Then hath  been described the wending of the distressed Dhritarashtra accompanied by  the ladies of his house to the field of battle of the Kauravas. Here  follow the pathetic wailings of the wives of the slain heroes. Then the  wrath of Gandhari and Dhritarashtra and their loss of consciousness. Then  the Kshatriya ladies saw those heroes,--their unreturning sons, brothers,  and fathers,--lying dead on the field. Then the pacification by Krishna of  the wrath of Gandhari distressed at the death of her sons and grandsons.  Then the cremation of the bodies of the deceased Rajas with due rites by  that monarch (Yudhishthira) of great wisdom and the foremost also of all  virtuous men. Then upon the presentation of water of the manes of the  deceased princes having commenced, the story of Kunti's acknowledgment of  Karna as her son born in secret. Those have all been described by the  great Rishi Vyasa in the highly pathetic eleventh Parva. Its perusal  moveth every feeling heart with sorrow and even draweth tears from the  eyes. The number of sections composed is twenty-seven. The number of  slokas is seven hundred and seventy-five.    \"Twelfth in number cometh the Santi Parva, which increaseth the  understanding and in which is related the despondency of Yudhishthira on  his having slain his fathers, brothers, sons, maternal uncles and  matrimonial relations. In this Parva is described how from his bed of  arrows Bhishma expounded various systems of duties worth the study of  kings desirous of knowledge; this Parva expounded the duties relative to  emergencies, with full indications of time and reasons. By understanding  these, a person attaineth to consummate knowledge. The mysteries also of  final"]]]
