Now and again some one has the idea that they are quite  good, and can be used for a steamer, and some people who have tried  them say they are all right, and others say they are all wrong.  And  so the end of it will be that some few thousand years hence there  will be a serious quarrel among geologists on the strange pocket of  coal on Fernando Po, and they will run up continents, and raise and  lower oceans to explain them, and they will doubtless get more  excitement and pleasure out of them than you can nowadays.    The history of the English occupation of Fernando Po seems often  misunderstood, and now and then one hears our Government reviled for  handing it over to the Spaniards.  But this was unavoidable, for we  had it as a loan from Spain in 1827 as a naval station for our  ships, at that time energetically commencing to suppress the slave  trade in the Bights; the idea being that this island would afford a  more healthy and convenient spot for a naval depot than any port on  the coast itself.    More convenient Fernando Po certainly was, but not more healthy, and  ever since 1827 it has been accumulating for itself an evil  reputation for unhealthiness which is only languishing just at  present because there is an interval between its epidemics--fever in  Fernando Po, even more than on the mainland, having periodic  outbursts of a more serious type than the normal intermittent and  remittent of the Coast.  Moreover, Fernando Po shares with Senegal  the undoubted yet doubtful honour of having had regular yellow  fever.  In 1862 and 1866 this disease was imported by a ship that  had come from Havana.  Since then it has not appeared in the  definite South American form, and therefore does not seem to have  obtained the foothold it has in Senegal, where a few years ago all  the money voted for the keeping of the Fete Nationale was in one  district devoted by public consent to the purchase of coffins,  required by an overwhelming outbreak of Yellow Jack.    In 1858 the Spanish Government thinking, presumably, that the slave  trade was suppressed enough, or at any rate to a sufficiently  inconvenient extent, re-claimed Fernando Po, to the horror of the  Baptist missionaries who had settled in Clarence apparently under  the erroneous idea that the island had been definitely taken over by  the English.  This mission had received from the West African  Company a large grant of land, and had collected round it a  gathering of Sierra Leonians and other artisan and trading Africans  who were attracted to Clarence by the work made by the naval  station; and these people, with the English traders who also settled  here for a like reason, were the founders of Clarence Town.  The  declaration of the Spanish Government stating that only Roman  Catholic missions would be countenanced caused the Baptists to  abandon their possessions and withdraw to the mainland in Ambas Bay,  where they have since remained, and nowadays Protestantism is  represented by a Methodist Mission which has a sub-branch on the  mainland on the Akwayafe River and one on the Qua Ibo.    The Spaniards, on resuming possession of the island, had one of  their attacks of activity regarding it, and sent out with Don Carlos  Chacon, who was to take over the command, four Jesuit priests, a  secretary, a commissariat officer, a custom-house clerk, and a  transport, the Santa Maria, with a number of emigrant families.  This attempt to colonise Fernando Po should have at least done the  good of preventing such experiments ever being tried again with  women and children, for of these unfortunate creatures--for whom, in  spite of its being the wet season, no houses had been provided--more  than 20 per cent. died in the space of five months.  Mr. Hutchinson,  who was English Consul at the time, tells us that \"In a very short  time gaunt figures of men, women, and children might be seen  crawling through the streets, with scarcely an evidence of life in  their faces, save the expression of a sort of torpid carelessness as  to how soon it might be their turn to drop off and die.  The  Portino, a steamer, carried back fifty of them to Cadiz, who looked  when they embarked more like living skeletons of skin and bone than  animated human beings.\" {47}  I quote this not to cast reproach on  the Spanish Government, but merely to give a fact, a case in point,  of the deadly failure of endeavours to colonise on the West Coast, a  thing which is even now occasionally attempted, always with the same  sad results, though in most cases these attempts are now made by  religious but misinformed people under Bishop Taylor's mission.    The Spaniards did not entirely confine their attention to planting  colonists in a ready-made state on the island.  As soon as they had  settled themselves and built their barracks and Government House,  they set to work and cleared away the bush for an area of from four  to six miles round the town.  The ground soon became overgrown  again, but this clearing is still perceptible in the different type  of forest on it, and has enabled the gardens and little plantations  round Clarence to be made more easily.  My Spanish friends assure me  that the Portuguese, who discovered the island in 1471, {48a} and  who exchanged it and Anno Bom in 1778 to the Spaniards for the  little island of Catalina and the colony of Sacramento in South  America, did not do anything to develop it.  When they, the  Spaniards, first entered into possession they at once set to work to  colonise and clear.  Then the colonisation scheme went to the bad,  the natives poisoned the wells, it is said, and the attention of the  Spaniards was in those days turned, for some inscrutable reason, to  the eastern shores of the island--a district now quite abandoned by  whites, on account of its unhealthiness--and they lost in addition  to the colonists a terrible quantity of their sailors, in Concepcion  Bay. {48b}  A lull then followed, and the Spaniards willingly lent  the place to the English as aforesaid.  They say we did nothing  except establish Clarence as a headquarters, which they consider to  have been a most excellent enterprise, and import the Baptist  Mission, which they hold as a less estimable undertaking; but there!  that's nothing to what the Baptist Mission hold regarding the  Spaniards.  For my own part, I wish the Spaniards better luck this  time in their activity, for in directing it to plantations they are  on a truer and safer road to wealth than they have been with their  previous importations of Cuban political prisoners and ready-made  families of colonists, and I hope they will send home those  unfortunate wretches they have there now, and commence, in their  expected two years, to reap the profits of the coffee and cocoa.  Certainly the chances are that they may, for the soil of Fernando Po  is of exceeding fertility; Mr. Hutchinson says he has known Indian  corn planted here on a Monday evening make its appearance four  inches above ground on the following Wednesday morning, within a  period, he carefully says, of thirty-six hours.  I have seen this  sort of thing over in Victoria, but I like to get a grown, strong  man, and a Consul of Her Britannic Majesty, to say it for me.    Having discoursed at large on the various incomers to Fernando Po we  may next turn to the natives, properly so-called, the Bubis.  These  people, although presenting a series of interesting problems to the  ethnologist, both from their insular position, and their  differentiation from any of the mainland peoples, are still but  little known.  To a great extent this has arisen from their  exclusiveness, and their total lack of enthusiasm in trade matters,  a thing that differentiates them more than any other characteristic  from the mainlanders, who, young and old, men and women, regard  trade as the great affair of life, take to it as soon as they can  toddle, and don't even leave it off at death, according to their own  accounts of the way the spirits of distinguished traders still  dabble and interfere in market matters.  But it is otherwise with  the Bubi.  A little rum, a few beads, and finish--then he will turn  the rest of his attention to catching porcupines, or the beautiful  little gazelles, gray on the back, and white underneath, with which  the island abounds.  And what time he may have on hand after this,  he spends in building houses and making himself hats.  It is only  his utterly spare moments that he employs in making just sufficient  palm oil from the rich supply of nuts at his command to get that rum  and those beads of his.  Cloth he does not want; he utterly fails to  see what good the stuff is, for he abhors clothes.  The Spanish  authorities insist that the natives who come into the town should  have something on, and so they array themselves in a bit of cotton  cloth, which before they are out of sight of the town on their  homeward way, they strip off and stuff into their baskets, showing  in this, as well as in all other particulars, how uninfluencible by  white culture they are.  For the Spaniards, like the Portuguese, are  great sticklers for clothes and insist on their natives wearing  them--usually with only too much success.  I shall never forget the  yards and yards of cotton the ladies of Loanda wore; and not content  with making cocoons of their bodies, they wore over their heads, as  a mantilla, some dozen yards or so of black cloth into the bargain.  Moreover this insistence on drapery for the figure is not merely for  towns; a German officer told me the other day that when, a week or  so before, his ship had called at Anno Bom, they were simply  besieged for \"clo', clo', clo';\" the Anno Bomians explaining that  they were all anxious to go across to Principe and get employment on  coffee plantations, but that the Portuguese planters would not  engage them in an unclothed state.
