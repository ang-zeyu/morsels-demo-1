Nay, folly was, as it were,  crowned, and disorder had a license! Sandys quotes from Leland the form  of a proclamation given in his \"Itinerary\" as having been made by the  sheriff of York, wherein it is declared that all \"thieves, dice-players,  carders\" (with some other characters by name that are usually repudiated  by the guardians of order) \"_and all other unthrifty folke_, be welcome  to the towne, whether they come late or early, att the reverence of the  high feast of Youle, till the twelve dayes be passed.\" The terms of this  proclamation were, no doubt, not intended to be construed in a grave and  literal sense, but were probably meant to convey something like a satire  upon the unbounded license of the season which they thus announce.    There are very pleasant evidences of the care which was formerly taken,  in high quarters, that the poor should not be robbed of their share in  this festival. The yearly increasing splendor of the royal celebrations  appears at one time to have threatened that result, by attracting the  country gentlemen from their own seats, and thereby withdrawing them  from the presidency of those sports which were likely to languish in  their absence. Accordingly, we find an order, in 1589, issued to the  gentlemen of Norfolk and Suffolk, commanding them \"to depart from London  before Christmas, and to repair to their countries, there to keep  hospitality amongst their neighbors.\" And similar orders appear to have  been from time to time necessary, and from time to time repeated.    Amongst those bodies who were distinguished for the zeal of their  Christmas observances, honorable mention may be made of the two English  universities; and we shall have occasion hereafter to show that traces  of the old ceremonials linger still in those their ancient haunts. But  the reader who is unacquainted with this subject would scarcely be  prepared to look for the most conspicuous celebration of these revels,  with all their antics and mummeries, in the grave and dusty retreats of  the law. Such, however, was the case. The lawyers beat the doctors  hollow. Their ancient halls have rung with the sounds of a somewhat  barbarous revelry; and the walls thereof, had they voices, could tell  many an old tale, which the present occupants might not consider as  throwing any desirable light upon the historical dignities of the body  to which they belong. Our readers, no doubt, remember a certain scene in  \"Guy Mannering,\" wherein the farmer Dinmont and Colonel Mannering are  somewhat inconsiderately intruded upon the carousals of Mr. Counsellor  Pleydell at his tavern in the city of Edinburgh and find that worthy  lawyer in what are called his \"altitudes,\" being deeply engaged in the  ancient and not very solemn pastime of \"High Jinks.\" Their memory may  probably present the counsellor \"enthroned as a monarch in an  elbow-chair placed on the dining-table, his scratch-wig on one side, his  head crowned with a bottle-slider, his eye leering with an expression  betwixt fun and the effects of wine,\" and recall, assisted by the  jingle, some of the high discourse of his surrounding court:--        \"Where is Gerunto now? and what's become of him?\"      \"Gerunto's drowned, because he could not swim,\" etc.    Now, if our readers shall be of opinion--as Colonel Mannering and the  farmer were--that the attitude and the occupation were scarcely  consistent with the dignity of a gentleman whom they had come to consult  on very grave matters, we may be as much to blame as was the  tavern-waiter on that occasion, in introducing them to the revels of the  Inns of Court. We will do what we can to soften such censure by stating  that there certainly appears at times to have arisen a suspicion, in the  minds of a portion of the profession, that the wig and gown were not  figuring to the best possible advantage on these occasions. For, in the  reign of the first James, we find an order issued by the benchers of  Lincoln's Inn, whereby the \"under barristers were, by decimation, put  out of commons because the whole bar offended by not dancing on  Candlemas Day preceding, according to the ancient order of the society,  when the judges were present;\" and this order is accompanied by a threat  \"that, if the fault were repeated, they should be fined or disbarred.\"    There seems to have been a contest between the four Inns of Court as to  which should get up these pageantries with the greatest splendor, and  occasionally a struggle between the desire of victory and the  disinclination, or perhaps inability, to furnish the heavy cost at which  that victory was to be secured. Most curious particulars on these  subjects are furnished by the accompt-books of the houses: by the \"Gesta  Grayorum\" (which was published for the purpose of describing a  celebrated Christmas kept at Gray's Inn in 1594, and had its title  imitated from the then popular work called the \"Gesta Romanorum\"); by  Dugdale, in his \"Origines Juridiciales,\"; and by Nichols, in his  \"Progresses of Queen Elizabeth.\" For some time Lincoln's Inn appears to  have carried it all its own way, having been first on the ground. The  Christmas celebrations seem to have been kept by this society from as  early a period as the reign of Henry VI.; although it was not until the  reign of Henry VIII. that they began to grow into celebrity, or at least  that we have any account of their arrangements. When, however, the  societies of the two Temples, and that of Gray's Inn, began, with a  laudable jealousy, to contest the palm of splendor, the necessary  expenditure appears occasionally to have \"given them pause.\"  Accordingly, they held anxious meetings, at the approach of the season,  to decide the important question whether Christmas should be kept that  year or not; and one of the registers of the society of Lincoln's Inn,  bearing date the 27th of November, in the twenty-second year of the  reign of Henry VIII. contains the following order: \"Yt is agreed that if  the two Temples do kepe Chrystemas, then Chrystemas to be kept here; and  to know this, the Steward of the House ys commanded to get knowledge,  and to advertise my master by the next day at night.\"    There is a curious story told in Baker's Chronicle of an awkward  predicament into which the society of Gray's Inn brought themselves by a  play which they enacted amongst their Christmas revels of 1527. The  subject of this play was to the effect that \"Lord Governance was ruled  by Dissipation and Negligence; by whose evil order Lady Public-Weal was  put from Governance.\" Now, if these gentlemen did not intend, by this  somewhat delicate moral, any insinuation against the existing state of  things (which, being lawyers, and therefore courtiers, there is good  motive to believe they did not), it is, at all events, certain that, as  lawyers, they ought to have known better how to steer clear of all  offence to weak consciences. That respectable minister, Cardinal Wolsey,  felt himself (as we think he had good right to do) greatly scandalized  at what, if not designed, was, by accident, a palpable hit; and, in  order to teach the gentlemen of Gray's Inn that they were responsible  for wounds given, if they happened to shoot arrows in the dark, he  divested the ingenious author, Sergeant Roe, of his coif, and committed  him to the Fleet, together with one of the actors, of the name of  Moyle,--in order to afford them leisure for furnishing him with a  satisfactory explanation of the matter.    In Dugdale's \"Origines Juridiciales,\" we have an account of a  magnificent Christmas which was kept at the Inner Temple, in the fourth  year of Queen Elizabeth's reign; at which the Lord Robert Dudley,  afterwards Earl of Leicester, presided, under the mock-title of  Palaphilos, Prince of Sophie, High Constable Marshal of the Knights  Templars, and Patron of the honorable order of Pegasus. A potentate with  such a title would have looked very foolish without a \"tail;\" and  accordingly he had for his master of the game no less a lawyer than  Christopher Hatton, afterwards Lord Chancellor of England, with four  masters of the revels, a variety of other officers, and fourscore  persons forming a guard. Gerard Leigh, who was so fortunate as to obtain  the dignity of a knight of Pegasus, describes, as an eye-witness, in his  \"Accidence of Armorie,\" the solemn fooleries which were enacted on the  occasion by these worthies of the sword and of the gown.    Of course, it was not to be expected that such shrewd courtiers as  lawyers commonly are, if they had ever kept Christmas at all, should  fail to do so during the reign of this virgin queen, when its  celebration offered them such admirable opportunities for the  administration of that flattery which was so agreeable to her Majesty,  and might possibly be so profitable to themselves. We have great  pleasure in recording a speech made by her Majesty on one of these  occasions, nearly so much as two centuries and a half ago, but which for  its great excellence has come down to our days. The gentlemen of Gray's  Inn (their wits, probably, a little sharpened by the mistake which they  had made in her father's time) had ventured upon a dramatic performance  again; and, in the course of a masque which they represented before the  queen's Majesty, had administered to her copious draughts of that nectar  on which her Majesty's vanity was known to thrive so marvellously.
