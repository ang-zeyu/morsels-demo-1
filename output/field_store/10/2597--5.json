They  may progress in the manner in which God has progressed; they may grow  and advance, but their identity can never be changed, worlds without  end--remember that; God has revealed these principles, and I know they  are true. They assert their truth upon the intelligent mind and soul  of man. They embrace or embody that which the Lord has planted in our  hearts and souls to desire, and to give it unto us. They put us in the  way of receiving that which we most desire and most love, that which  is most necessary and essential to our happiness and exaltation. They  take of the things of God and give them to us, and they prepare us for  the future, for exaltation and for eternal happiness, a reward which  all the souls in the world desire, if they are correct in their lives  and thoughts. It is only the vicious and the truly wicked who do not  desire purity; they do not love purity and truth. I do not know whether  it is possible for any soul to become so debased as to lose all regard  for that which is pure and chaste, good and true and godlike. I believe  that there still lingers in the heart of the most vicious and wicked,  at times at least, a spark of that divinity that has been planted in  the souls of all the sons of God. Men may become so corrupt that they  do not have more than mere glimpses of that divine inspiration that  strives to lead them toward and to love good; but I do not believe  there is a soul in the world that has absolutely lost all conception  {35} and admiration of that which is good and pure, when he sees it.  It is hard to believe that a human being may become so depraved that  he has lost all desire that he might also be good and pure, if it were  possible; but many people have abandoned themselves to evil and have  come to the conclusion that there is no chance for them. While there is  life there is hope, and while there is repentance there is a chance for  forgiveness; and if there is forgiveness, there is a chance for growth  and development until we acquire the full knowledge of these principles  that will exalt and save us and prepare us to enter into the presence  of God the Father, who is the Father of our spirits, and who is the  Father in the flesh, of his Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, who joined  divine immortality with the mortal, welded the link between God and man  made it possible for mortal souls, on whom the sentence of death had  been placed, to acquire eternal life, through obedience to his laws.  Let us, therefore, seek the truth and walk in the light as Christ is in  the light, that we may have fellowship with him, and with each other,  that his blood may cleanse us from all sin.    May the Lord comfort my brother Heber, and I know he will. Brother  Heber does not feel that there is any death here. I don't think I  could weep for sorrow. I could give way to tears just now, but they  would not be tears of sorrow, of mourning, or of grief, for this good  soul. They would only express the love I have for her; they would only  indicate my feelings toward her, for the noble and pure example she  set before me and all who have known her. I could weep for joy in the  knowledge that I possess that she, in her spirit life and being, is  and will be associated with all those who have been endeared to her by  the persecutions, the experiences and the trials through which she has  had to pass in this world. With them she is rejoicing today, as one  born of death into life everlasting. She is not dead; she lives! What  greater proof do you want of that fact {36} than to see her lifeless  form? Who is she? This is her casket. This is her mortal tenement;  this is but the clay that enveloped the immortal, living Aunt Rachel,  the living spirit. The spirit has fled. Her spirit, the immortal part,  has departed from this tabernacle; hence, this tabernacle lies here  lifeless and ready to return to mother earth from whence it came, but  to be restored again, every element to be recalled and re-formed in its  perfect frame, when Aunt Rachel will come and take possession of it and  inherit it forever, just as Christ came and took up his body that was  not suffered to see corruption, and inherited it in its immortal state,  never to be separated again; so it will be with her.--_Improvement  Era,_ Vol. 12, p. 591, June, 1909. Speech at the funeral services of  Rachel Grant, mother of President Heber J. Grant.    NO NEW PRINCIPLES IN THE GOSPEL. We have no new principle to advocate;  but we have come to preach the gospel of life and salvation, to testify  to the divinity of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and of the divine  mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith, through whose instrumentality the  truth was restored in this dispensation.--_Improvement Era,_ Vol. 21,  p. 98, December, 1917.    FOUNDATION OF TRUTH. We hear frequently of men who throw discredit on  the doctrine of Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, because some of  the principles, doctrines, and philosophy which he taught are said to  have been spoken before his day by heathen philosophers.    A variety of examples are sometimes quoted to show that the ideals  which have grown from the doctrines of Christ are a direct development  of what is found in the teachings of the Old Testament, particularly  in the Psalms and in the second part of Isaiah. But, on the other  hand, it is just as certain that these ideals receive a finish and an  enrichment, by the touch of the Savior, vastly beyond and above what  they possessed before, and also they are placed {37} on deeper and  firmer foundations. This, let it be said to begin with, is because they  were his before they were ever uttered by man.    Even in the five distinctive and characteristic topics generally  considered by commentators original in the teachings of Jesus, we find  little if anything new, except the enlargement. These are named as,  the Fatherhood of God, the Kingdom of God; subjects or members of the  Kingdom; the Messiah, the Holy Ghost; and the Trinity of God.    But the idea of the Fatherhood of God was not unknown either to the  Pagans or to Israel. Zeus, from the time of Homer, had borne the name  \"father of gods and men.\" But, both in Jewish and Pagan literature,  the idea was superficial and meant little more than \"originator\" (Gen.  1:26); and in the old Jewish scripture God is more particularly called  the \"Father of his people, Israel\" (Deut. 14:1; Isaiah 63:16). But in  the teachings of Christ there is a fuller embodiment of revelation in  the word Father, and the application which he makes of the Fatherhood  of God invests his life with supreme tenderness and beauty. As an  example: In the old scripture, we are told, \"Like as a father pitieth  his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him\" (Psalm 103:13);  but by the interpretation of Jesus, the love of God as Father extends  beyond these limitations even to those who are unthankful and evil:  \"But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do  good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use  you and persecute you; that ye may be the children of your Father which  is in heaven; for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the  good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust\" (Matt. 5:45).  \"But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing  again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of  the Highest; for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil\" (Luke  6:35).    {38} And so with other doctrines of Christ; while perhaps not  new they are enriched by the addition of fuller, broader, more  loving conceptions of God and his purposes; in which compulsion  was eliminated, and lowly service, love, and self-sacrifice were  substituted and made the true forces of an acceptable life. Even the  answer to the lawyer's question, often called the eleventh commandment:  \"Master, which is the great commandment in the law?\" had been given to  the children of Israel (Lev. 19:19), over two thousand years before its  perfected meaning was impressed upon the learned Pharisee (Matt. 22:34,  40).    But what of all this? Are we therefore to discredit the teachings of  the Savior? Verily no. Let it be remembered that Christ was with the  Father from the beginning, that the gospel of truth and light existed  from the beginning and is from everlasting to everlasting. The Father,  Son and Holy Ghost, as one God, are the fountain of truth. From this  fountain all the ancient learned philosophers have received their  inspiration and wisdom--from it they have received all their knowledge.  If we find truth in broken fragments through the ages, it may be set  down as an incontrovertible fact that it originated at the fountain,  and was given to philosophers, inventors, patriots, reformers, and  prophets by the inspiration of God. It came from him through his Son  Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost, in the first place, and from no other  source. It is eternal.    Christ, therefore, being the fountain of truth, is no imitator. He  taught the truth first; it was his before it was given to man. When he  came to the earth he not only proclaimed new thought, but repeated some  of the everlasting principles which had been heretofore only partly  understood and enunciated by the wisest of men. And in so doing he  enlarged in every instance upon the wisdom which they had originally  received from him, because of his superior abilities and wisdom and his  association with the Father and the {39} Holy Ghost. He did not imitate  men. They made known in their imperfect way what the inspiration of  Jesus Christ had taught them, for they obtained their enlightenment  first from him.    Christ taught the gospel to Adam, and made known his truths to Abraham  and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47132"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 7 (of 8) (#10)"],[1,"undreds, in the Zuurberg.    On the 14th of April Colonel Gorringe returned to Pretoria after three  months' of exceptionally hard work and incessant trekking over some of  the worst country in South Africa. His Colonial column had done on an  average a daily trek of some thirty-one and a half miles. On one  occasion, when rushing to the succour of Pearston[2] when it was  overpowered by raiders, these hardy troopers, with guns and  equipments, covered seventy-four miles in forty hours, crossing the  frowning heights of Coelzeeberg by a bridle path.    General MacDonald now proceeded to England in order to take up command  of an important post on the Afghan frontier, and General Fitzroy Hart  succeeded him in command of the 3rd Brigade. Sir Alfred Milner made  preparations to go home on leave.    On the 24th the Dordrecht Volunteer Guard and Wodehouse's Yeomanry  gave an excellent account of themselves. They were attacking raiders  for the most part of the day, and sent the Dutchmen to the  right-about, capturing their horses and forcing them to make good  their escape on Shanks' pony.    On the 29th Major Du Moulin's column, accompanied by Lovat's Scouts  under Major Murray, arrived at Aliwal North from Orange River Colony,  bringing with it 30 prisoners, 60,000 sheep, 6000 head of cattle, 100  waggons, 800 refugees, and 300 horses.    FOOTNOTES:    [2] See page 8.          CHAPTER III    THE OPERATIONS OF GENERAL FRENCH IN THE EASTERN TRANSVAAL, FROM 27TH  JANUARY TO 16TH APRIL 1901      It may be remembered that at the close of 1900 the Boer chiefs, De Wet  and Botha, had invented a concerted scheme of some magnitude. They had  arranged that Hertzog should enter Cape Colony and proceed to  Lambert's Bay to meet a ship which was said to be bringing from Europe  mercenaries, guns, and ammunition. De Wet was to follow south _via_ De  Aar, join hands with Hertzog, and together, with renewed munitions of  war and a tail of rebels at their heels, attack Cape Town. General  Botha at the same time was to keep the British occupied in the Eastern  Transvaal and prevent them drawing off troops to the south, and, so  soon as the plans of De Wet and Hertzog were being carried out, he was  to enter Natal with a picked force of 5000 mounted men and make for  Durban.    Having seen how the parent scheme, the invasion of the Cape Colony,  was frustrated, it is necessary to turn to scheme two, and follow  General French in the remarkable operations which defeated Botha's  designs. A considerable concentration of Boers, under the Commandants  Louis Botha, Smuts, Spruyt, and Christian Botha, had taken place in  Ermelo, Carolina, and Bethel, which districts constituted depots for  the supply of the enemy's forces. The Commander-in-chief therefore  decided to sweep the country between the Delagoa and Natal Railway  lines, from Johannesburg to the Swazi and Zulu frontiers, and to clear  it of supplies and families. With this object in view, on the 28th of  January the following columns were concentrated from the meridian of  Springs: Major-General Paget, Brigadier Alderson, Colonel E. Knox  (18th Hussars), Lieutenant-Colonel Allenby (6th Dragoons),  Lieutenant-Colonel Pulteney (Scots Guards), and Brigadier-General  Dartnell (Commandant of Volunteers, Natal).    The troops--the southern columns under the command of Lieutenant-General  Sir John French--were to form a north and south line between the  railway, and thus drive the enemy before them to Ermelo. They were  commanded from north to south in the order shown above. While this line  was advancing, Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell and Lieutenant-Colonel Spens,  moving a march south from Middelburg and Wonderfontein, were to act as  side stops, while Major-General Smith-Dorrien, with a force 3000  strong, was to advance from Belfast _via_ Carolina to Lake Chrissie, for  the purpose of preventing the Boers from breaking north-east. A weak  column, under Lieutenant-Colonel Colville (Rifle Brigade), was to work  south of Colonel Dartnell to cover the movement of supplies, first from  Greylingstad to the north, and then from Standerton to Ermelo.    [Illustration: MAP SHOWING THE OPERATIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF TROOPS  IN THE EASTERN TRANSVAAL]    Eventually, owing to the movements of De Wet, General Paget was  recalled from this sphere of action, and his place was taken by  Colonel Campbell. General Alderson's and Knox's lines of advance were  slightly diverted to the north, and the line between them was filled  by Lieutenant-Colonel Pulteney, who originally was to have been held  in reserve.    The first two marches took the western troops to a line north of  Greylingstad to Vangatfontein, in the valley of the Wilge River, where  there was a two days' halt till the 31st. The march was not without  excitement, for Beyers was found to be ensconced in a strong and  extended position stretching north and south, and covering the  approach to the valley of the Wilge River. Bushman's Kop, fourteen  miles east of Springs, was strongly held, and the advanced troops of  Knox and Allenby were assailed with fierce artillery from the  surrounding heights. But when Allenby's mounted men had wheeled round  the south of the position, the Boers thought it high time to retreat,  leaving behind them two dead. This was on the 29th. Two days were  spent in receiving supplies from Greylingstad and sending the emptied  waggons full of Boer families to the rail and clearing the country of  supplies.    The Boers, holding a chain of sloping hills some twenty-three miles  west of Bethal, were again encountered on the 1st of February. While  Colonel Rimington (commanding Colonel Pulteney's mounted troops)  worked round the north of the position, Colonel Allenby and the rest  of Pulteney's troops held them in front. But the wily Dutchmen, now  rapidly becoming demoralised, instantly they found their flank  threatened, were off to the east before they could be cut off. The  commanders on the right had also met with slight opposition.    The operations of the 2nd of February much resembled those of the  previous day, for some 2000 Boers, who had planted themselves about  ten miles west of Bethal, ceased their opposition to Colonel Allenby,  when they found Pulteney's cavalry sweeping round to their north, and  they made such haste to depart that they left behind them an English  15-pounder gun, with damaged breech. The village of Bethal was reached  by General French on the 4th, all Boers, save a few women and  children, having fled. The troops were now hurriedly pushing forward  with a view to surrounding Ermelo. Their position was as follows:  Allenby on the south-east; Dartnell on the south and south-west;  Pulteney on the west; Knox on the north-west; Anderson and Campbell on  the north; and Smith-Dorrien on the north-east and east. The enemy,  seeing security at this place thus threatened, split into two  factions. Louis Botha, with a following of some 3000 men, scurried to  the north toward Komati without impediment, in the form of families  and stock, while the rest, protecting their waggons, retreated toward  Piet Retief. Botha, while scurrying as aforesaid, discovered on the  5th that Smith-Dorrien's force, about 3000 strong (with a big convoy  for his own, Campbell's, and Alderson's columns), had reached  Bothwell, north of Lake Chrissie. Here was a fine chance! and the Boer  leader speedily availed himself of it. He determined to attack the  British column before the troops of Campbell and Alderson, moving from  the west, could get in touch with it. Accordingly, dividing his force  into three, and rising betimes, in the thick mists of daybreak, on the  6th, he delivered a vigorous semicircular attack upon the camp. This  was successfully repulsed.    The Boers lost heavily, General Spruyt and several field-cornets being  among the slain. The British had one officer and twenty-three men  killed, three officers and fifty-two men wounded. Some 300 horses were  killed or stampeded during the surprise. The Boers, owing to the heavy  fog of the morning, got away to the north. At the moment Botha was  making his attack on the camp, the officer bearing orders from General  French for General Smith-Dorrien, after an exciting and hazardous  ride, reached Bothwell. Owing to the fight these orders--to move on  the 6th to a position E.N.E. of Ermelo--could then not be executed.  General Smith-Dorrien therefore remained at Bothwell.    Meanwhile, in the south, fighting went forward. Colonel Allenby, who  had been rapidly pushing east, came on the enemy's rearguard, which  was occupying a ridge south of Ermelo. With infantry and artillery,  and supported by Dartnell's Brigade, he engaged them, holding them on  the west while the mounted troops endeavoured to wheel round the  southern flank and surround them. But the Boers, who had had a long  start, nimbly made good their escape over the Vaal at Witpunt before  Allenby's troops could possibly reach that point, and consequently the  brilliant attempt to cut off their retreat proved a failure. Ermelo  was occupied on the 6th, and thus the first phase of the operations  was accomplished.           *       *       *       *       *    It was now necessary to sweep the country from Ermelo to the Swazi  frontier, which movement occupied from the 9th to the 16th of  February. To this end the flanks were immediately opened out again,  and the line Bothwell-Ermelo-Amersfoort taken. From this line the  force wheeled half-right, the left flank (rationed on reduced scale up  to the 20th) beginning to extend east towards Swaziland on the 9th.    The whole force was now so ordered as to form a complete cordon for  the purpose of hemming in the enemy and their belongings in the  south-eastern corner of the Transvaal. The troops were here to  converge on Amsterdam and Piet Retief from north and south-west, and,  with the escort to the convoy from Utrecht, were to form a line from"]]]
