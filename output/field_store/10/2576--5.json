Not that this song  of angels is the sovereign joy of the soul; but for the difference  that is between a man's soul in flesh and an angel, because of  uncleanness, a soul may not hear it, but by ravishing in love, and  needeth for to be purified well clean, and fulfilled of much  charity, or[165] it were able for to hear heavenly sound. For the  sovereign and the essential joy is in the love of God by Himself and  for Himself, and the secondary is in communing and beholding of  angels and ghostly creatures. For right as a soul, in understanding  of ghostly things, is often times touched and moved through bodily  imagination by working of angels; as Ezekiel the prophet did see in  bodily imagination the soothfastness of God's privities;[166] right  so, in the love of God, a soul by the presence of angels is ravished  out of mind of all earthly and fleshly things in to an heavenly joy,  to hear angel's song and heavenly sound, after that the charity is  more or less.[167] Now, then, me thinketh that there may no soul  feel verily angel's song nor heavenly sound, but he be in perfect  charity; though all that are in perfect charity have not felt it,  but only that soul that is so purified in the fire of love that all  earthly savour is brent out of it, and all mean letting[168] between  the soul and the cleanness of angels is broken and put away from it.  Then soothly may he sing a new song, and soothly he may hear a  blessed heavenly sound, and angel's song without deceit or feigning.  Our Lord woteth there that soul is that, for abundance of brenning  love, is worthy to hear angel's song. Who so then will hear angel's  song, and not be deceived by feigning of himself, nor by  imagination, nor by the illusion of the enemy, him behoveth for to  have perfect charity; and that is when all vain love and dread, vain  joy and sorrow, is cast out of the heart, so that it love nothing  but God, nor dread nothing but God, nor joyeth, nor sorroweth  nothing but in God, or for God. Who so might by the grace of God go  this way, he should not err. Nevertheless, some men are deceived by  their own imagination, or by the illusion of the enemy in this  manner.[169] Some man, when he hath long travailed bodily and  ghostily in destroying of sins and getting of virtues, and  peradventure hath gotten by grace a somedeal[170] rest, and a  clarity in conscience, anon he leaveth prayers, readings of holy  scriptures, and meditations of the passion of Christ, and the mind  of his wretchedness; and, or[171] he be called of God, he gathereth  his own visits by violence to seek and to behold heavenly things, or  his eye be made ghostly by grace, and overtravaileth by imaginations  his wits, and by indiscreet travailing turneth the brains in his  head, and forbreaketh[172] the mights and the wits of the soul and  of the body. And then, for feebleness of the brain, him thinketh  that he heareth wonderful sounds and songs; and that is nothing else  but a fantasy, caused of troubling of the brain; as a man that is in  a frenzy him thinketh that he heareth and seeth that none other man  doth; and all is but vanity and fantasies of the head, or else it is  by working of the wicked enemy that feigneth such sounds in his  hearing.    For if a man have any presumption in his fantasies and in his  workings, and thereby falleth in to indiscreet imagination, as it  were in a frenzy, and is not ordered nor ruled of grace, nor  comforted by ghostly strength, the devil entereth in, and by his  false illuminations, and by his false sounds, and by his false  sweetnesses, he deceiveth a man's soul.    And of this false ground springeth errors, and heresies, false  prophecies, presumptions, and false reasonings, blasphemings, and  slanderings, and many other mischiefs. And, therefore, if thou see  any man ghostly occupied fall in any of these sins and these  deceits, or in frenzies, wete thou well that he never heard nor felt  angel's song nor heavenly sound. For, soothly, he that heareth  verily angel's song, he is made so wise that he shall never err by  fantasy, nor by indiscretion, nor by no slight[173] of working of  the devil.    Also, some men feel in their hearts as it were a ghostly sound, and  sweet songs in divers manners; and this is commonly good, and  sometime it may turn to deceit. This sound is felt on this wise.  Some man setteth the thought of his heart only in the name of Jesu,  and steadfastly holdeth it thereto, and in short time him thinketh  that that name turneth him to great comfort and sweetness, and him  thinketh that the name soundeth in his heart delectably, as it were  a song; and the virtue of this liking is so mighty, that it draweth  in all the wits of the soul thereto. Who so may feel this sound and  this sweetness verily in his heart, wete thou well that it is of  God,[174] and, as long as he is meek, he shall not be deceived. But  this is not angel's song; but it is a song of the soul by virtue of  the name and by touching of the good angel.[175] For when a soul  offereth him to Jesu truly and meekly, putting all his trust and his  desire in Him, and busily keepeth Him in his mind, our Lord Jesu,  when He will, pureth[176] the affection of the soul, and filleth it,  and feedeth it with sweetness of Himself, and maketh His name in the  feeling of the soul[177] as honey, and as song, and as any thing  that is delectable; so that it liketh the soul evermore for to cry  Jesu, Jesu. And not only he hath comfort in this, but also in psalms  and hymns, and anthems of holy Church, that the heart singeth them  sweetly, devoutly, and freely, without any travail of the soul, or  bitterness in the same time,[178] and notes that holy Church useth.  This is good, and of the gift of God, for the substance of this  feeling lies in the love of Jesu, which is fed and lightened[179] by  such manner of songs. Nevertheless, in this manner of feeling, a  soul may be deceived by vain glory; not in that time that the  affection singeth to Jesu, and loveth Jesu in sweetness of Him, but  afterward, when it ceaseth and the heart keeleth[180] of the love of  Jesu, then entereth in vain glory. Also some man is deceived on this  wise: he heareth well say that it is good to have Jesu in his mind,  or any other good word of God; then he straineth his heart mightily  to that name, and by a custom he hath it nearhand alway in his mind;  and, nevertheless, he feeleth not thereby in his affection  sweetness, nor light of knowing in his reason, but only a naked mind  of God,[181] or of Jesu, or of Mary, or of any other good word. Here  may be deceit, not for it is evil for to have Jesu in mind on this  wish but if he this feeling and this mind, that is only his own  working by custom, hold it a special visitation of our Lord,[182]  and think it more than it is. For wete thou well that a naked mind  or a naked imagination of Jesu, or of any ghostly thing, without  sweetness of love in the affection, or without light of knowing in  reason, it is but a blindness, and a way to deceit, if a man hold it  in his own sight more than it is. Therefore I hold it siker[183]  that he be meek in his own feeling, and hold this mind in regard  nought, till he may, by custom and using of this mind, feel the fire  of love in his affection, and the light of knowing in his reason.  Lo, I have told thee in this matter a little, as me thinketh; not  affirming that this sufficeth, nor that this is the soothfastness in  this matter. But if thou think it otherwise, or else any other man  savour by grace the contrary hereto, I leave this saying, and give  stead to him; it sufficeth to me for to live in truth[184]  principally, and not in feeling.    EXPLICIT          V.    HERE AFTER FOLLOWETH A DEVOUT TREATISE CALLED THE EPISTLE OF PRAYER      GHOSTLY friend in God, as touching thine asking of me, how thou  shalt rule thine heart in the time of thy prayer, I answer unto thee  thus feebly as I can. And I say that me thinketh that it should be  full speedful unto thee at the first beginning of thy prayer, what  prayer so ever it be, long or short, for to make it full known unto  thine heart, without any feigning, that thou shalt die at the end of  thy prayer.[185] And wete thou well that this is no feigned thought  that I tell thee, and see why; for truly there is no man living in  this life that dare take upon him to say the contrary: that is to  say, that thou shalt live longer than thy prayer is in doing. And,  therefore, thou mayst think it safely, and I counsel thee to do it.  For, if thou do it, thou shalt see that, what for the general sight  that thou hast of thy wretchedness, and this special sight of the  shortness of time of amendment, it shall bring in to thine heart a  very working of dread.    And this working shalt thou feel[186] verily folden in thine heart,  but if it so be (the which God forbid) that thou flatter and  fage[187] thy false fleshly blind heart with leasings[188] and  feigned behightings, that thou shalt longer live.[189] For though it  may be sooth in thee in deed that thou shalt live longer, yet it is  ever in thee a false leasing for to think it before, and for to  behight[190] it to thine heart. For why, the soothfastness of this  thing is only in God, and in thee is but a blind abiding of His  will, without certainty of one moment, the which is as little or  less than a twinkling of an eye. And, therefore, if thou wilt pray  wisely as the prophet biddeth when he saith in the psalm: Psallite  sapienter;191 look that thou get thee in the beginning this very  working of dread. For, as the same prophet saith in another psalm:  Initium sapientiae timor Domini;192 that is: \"The beginning of  wisdom is the dread of our Lord God.\" But "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45456"],[0,"History of Julius Cæsar, Vol. 1 of 2 (#10)"],[1,"the centre,  they cut the peninsula into two parts nearly equal; then, at Mount  Caruso (_Vultur_), near the source of the Bradano (_Bradanus_), they  separate into two branches, one of which penetrates into Calabria, the  other into the Terra di Bari as far as Otranto.    The two slopes of the Apennines give birth to various streams which flow  some into the Adriatic and others into the Mediterranean. On the eastern  side the principal are--the Rubicon, the Pisaurus (_Foglia_), the  Metaurus (_Metauro_), the AEsis (_Esino_), the Truentus (_Tronto_), the  Aternus (_Pescara_), the Sangrus (_Sangro_), the Trinius (_Trigno_), the  Frento (_Fortore_), and the Aufidus (_Ofanto_), which follow generally a  direction perpendicular to the chain of mountains. On the western side,  the Arnus (_Arno_), the Ombrus (_Ombrone_), the Tiber, the Amasenus  (_Amaseno_), the Liris (_Garigliano_), the Vulturnus (_Volturno_), and  the Silarus (_Silaro_ or _Sile_), run parallel to the Apennines; but  towards their mouths they take a direction nearly perpendicular to the  coast. The Bradanus (_Bradano_), the Casuentus (_Basiento_), and the  Aciris (_Agri_), flow into the Gulf of Tarentum.    We may admit into ancient Italy the following great divisions and  subdivisions:--    To the north, the Senones, a people of Gallic origin, occupying the  shores of the Adriatic Sea, from the Rubicon to the neighbourhood of  Ancona; Umbria, situated between the Senones and the course of the  Tiber; Etruria, between the Tiber and the Mediterranean Sea.    In the centre the territory of Picenum, between Ancona and Hadria, in  the Abruzzo Ulteriore; Latium, in the part between the Apennines and the  Mediterranean, from the Tiber to the Liris; to the south of Latium, the  Volsci, and the Aurunci, the _debris_ of the ancient Ausones, retired  between the Liris and the Amasenus, and bordering upon another people of  the same race, the Sidicines, established between the Liris and the  Vulturnus; the country of the Sabines, between Picenum and Latium; to  the east of Latium, in the mountains, the AEqui; the Hernici, backed by  the populations of Sabellian stock, namely, the Marsi, the Peligni, the  Vestini, the Marrucini, and the Frentani, distributed in the valleys  through which run the rivers received by the Adriatic from the extremity  of Picenum to the River Fortore.    The territory of Samnium, answering to the great part of the Abruzzi and  the province of Molisa, advanced towards the west as far as the upper  arm of the Vulturnus, on the north to the banks of the Fortore, and to  the south to Mount Vultur. Beyond the Vulturnus extended Campania  (_Terra di Lavoro and part of the principality of Salerno_), from  Sinuessa to the Gulf of Paestum.    Southern Italy, or Magna Graecia, comprised on the Adriatic: first,  Apulia (the _Capitanata_ and _Terra di Bari_) and Messapia (_Terra di  Otranto_); this last terminated in the Iapygian Promontory, and its  central part was occupied by the Salentini and divers other Messapian  populations, while there existed on the seaboard a great number of Greek  colonies; secondly, Lucania, which answered nearly to the modern  province of Basilicata, and was washed by the waters of the Gulf of  Tarentum; thirdly, Bruttium (now the _Calabrias_), forming the most  advanced point of Italy, and terminating in the Promontory of Hercules.      [Sidenote: Dispositions of the People of Italy in regard to Rome.]    II. In 416, Rome had finally subdued the Latins, and possessed part of  Campania. Her supremacy extended from the present territory of Viterbo  to the Gulf of Naples, from Antium (_Porto di Anzo_) to Sora.    The frontiers of the Republic were difficult to defend, her limits ill  determined, and her neighbours the most warlike people of the peninsula.    To the north only, the mountains of Viterbo, covered with a thick forest  (_silva Ciminia_), formed a rampart against Etruria. The southern part  of this country had been long half Roman; the Latin colonies of Sutrium  (_Sutri_) and Nepete (_Nepi_) served as posts of observation. But the  Etruscans, animated for ages with hostile feeling towards Rome,  attempted continually to recover the lost territory. The Gaulish  Senones, who, in 364, had taken and burnt Rome, and often renewed their  invasions, had come again to try their fortune. In spite of their  defeats in 404 and 405, they were always ready to join the Umbrians and  Etruscans in attacking the Republic.    The Sabines, though entertaining from time immemorial tolerably amicable  relations with the Romans, offered but a doubtful alliance. Picenum, a  fertile and populous country, was peaceful, and the greater part of the  mountain tribes of Sabellic race, in spite of their bravery and energy,  inspired as yet no fear. Nearer Rome, the AEqui and the Hernici had been  reduced to inaction; but the Senate kept in mind their hostilities and  nourished projects of vengeance.    On the southern coast, among the Greek towns devoted to commerce,  Tarentum passed for the most powerful; but these colonies, already in  decline, were obliged to have recourse to mercenary troops, to resist  the native inhabitants. They disputed with the Samnites and the Romans  the preponderance over the people of Magna Graecia. The Samnites, indeed,  a manly and independent race, aimed at seizing the whole of Southern  Italy; their cities formed a confederacy, redoubtable on account of its  close union in time of war. The mountain tribes gave themselves up to  brigandage, and it is worthy of attention that recent events show that  in our days manners have not much changed in that country. The Samnites  had amassed considerable riches; their arms displayed excessive  extravagance, and, if we believe Caesar,[163] they served as models for  those of the Romans.    A jealous rivalry had long prevailed between the Romans and the  Samnites. The moment these two peoples found themselves in presence of  each other, it was evident that they would be at war; the struggle was  long and terrible, and, during the fifth century, it was round Samnium  that they disputed the empire of Italy. The position of the Samnites was  very advantageous. Entrenched in their mountains, they could, at their  will, either descend into the valley of the Liris, thence reach the  country of the Aurunci, always ready to revolt, and cut off the  communications of Rome with Campania; or follow the course of the upper  Liris into the country of the Marsi, raise these latter, and hold out  the hand to the Etruscans, turning Rome; or, lastly, penetrate into  Campania by the valley of the Vulturnus, and fall upon the Sidicini,  whose territory they coveted.    In the midst of so many hostile peoples, for a little state to succeed  in raising itself above the others, and in subjugating them, it must  have possessed peculiar elements of superiority. The peoples who  surrounded Rome, warlike and proud of their independence, had neither  the same unity, nor the same incentives to action, nor the same powerful  aristocratic organisation, nor the same blind confidence in their  destinies. They displayed more selfishness than ambition. When they  fought, it was much more to increase their riches by pillage than to  augment the number of their subjects. Rome triumphed, because alone, in  prospect of a future, she made war not to destroy, but to conserve, and,  after the material conquest, always set herself to accomplish the moral  conquest of the vanquished.    During four hundred years her institutions had formed a race animated  with the love of country and with the sentiment of duty; but, in their  turn, the men, incessantly re-tempered in intestine struggles, had  successively introduced manners and traditions stronger even than the  institutions themselves. During three centuries, in fact, Rome  presented, in spite of the annual renewal of powers, such a perseverance  in the same policy, such a practice of the same virtues, that it might  have been supposed that the government had but a single head, a single  thought, and one might have believed that all its generals were great  warriors, all its senators experienced statesmen, and all its citizens  valiant soldiers.    The geographical position of Rome contributed no less to the rapid  increase of its power. Situated in the middle of the only great fertile  plain of Latium, on the banks of the only important river of Central  Italy, which united it with the sea, it could be at the same time  agricultural and maritime, conditions then indispensable for the capital  of a new empire. The rich countries which bordered the coasts of the  Mediterranean were sure to fall easily under her dominion; and as for  the countries which surrounded her, it was possible to become mistress  of them by occupying gradually the openings from all the valleys. The  town of the seven hills, favoured by her natural situation as well as by  her political constitution, carried thus in herself the germs of her  future greatness.      [Sidenote: Treatment of the Vanquished Peoples.]    III. From the commencement of the fifth century Rome prepares with  energy to subject and assimilate to herself the peoples who dwelt from  the Rubicon to the Strait of Messina. Nothing will prevent her from  surmounting all obstacles, neither the coalition of her neighbours  conspiring against her, nor the new incursions of the Gauls, nor the  invasion of Pyrrhus. She will know how to raise herself from her partial  defeats, and establish the unity of Italy, not by subduing at once all  these peoples to the same laws and the same rule, but by causing them  to enter, by little and little and in different degrees, into the great  Roman family. \"Of one city she makes her ally; on another she confers  the honour of living under the Quiritary law, to this one with the right  of suffrage, to that with the permission to retain its own government.
