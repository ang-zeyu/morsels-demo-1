The quarters inhabited by your true  Ottoman are characteristically clean and comfortable.  The remainder  of the city except foreign quarters is intolerably dirty.  With true  Oriental tolerance, the Turk lets things gang their ain gait.  The  casual observer and traveler always confounds the Turk with the rest  of the nondescript mass of humanity that swarms in Constantinople.  That is a crass mistake.  Your true descendant of Ossman is a clean,  dignified, easy-going gentleman with a deep philosophical strain in  his make-up, contaminated by hundreds of years of contact--not  association, for your true Turk does not associate--with the outcast  Mischling of southern Europe and Asia Minor.    My mission was indeed a difficult one and only by tedious, painstaking  work, observing the life of the city and its character, I succeeded in  isolating the individual who gave me the key to the circumventuous  political life and the government of Constantinople.  It took me a  full month of night work to become familiar with the innumerable  demi-mondaines.  They were of French, Russian and Circassian birth and  extraction, and were identified with the various Turkish court  officials from the Grand Vizier down to an officer in the  Ganitsharies.  This preliminary work is always exhausting, but it is  so necessary on a mission of this kind.  One blunder, one step in the  dark, and you are gone.  One spends months without any tangible  results, often going on the wrong track.  One has to be excruciatingly  circumspect in one's inquiries.  To use a hunter's expression, there  is no quarry so wary, sharp-sighted and keen at smelling the wind as a  political demi-mondaine.    In this work Kim was of inestimable value to me.  In fact, without him  I would not have succeeded at all.  All the households kept by the  Turkish officials and their favorites swarm with negroes of the  various types.  A white man has not the slightest chance of finding  the way into their confidences.  The universal golden key does not  unloose tongues in such cases in the Orient.  But Kim as a member of  the once mighty Zulu nation (he was really a descendant of a prince of  the house of Dingnan) was able, through a mysterious free masonry  still existing among colored races the world over, to obtain most  valuable information.    My method of campaign was to ascertain the name of one of the  favorites of the Turkish officials, to locate her residence and then  put Kim to work.  Finally locating one of these women, I would manage  to learn her name and where she lived.  Then it was time for Kim.    \"Kim,\" I said, \"I want you to find out who comes to see her, whether  it is always the same official and if so, how frequently.  I want you  to learn everything you can about any letters she may receive.  I want  to know just where she gets her money from, if she has any outside  sources of revenue, other than in Constantinople.  I want every scrap  of any kind of information about her.\"    And Kim would go his way, seek out the servants in that household and  he would generally come back with all this information.    Now I noticed that a certain Mlle.  Balniaux was very much in the  company of Abdulla, who was at that time the influential adviser of  the Grand Vizier.  It was known in Berlin that the Grand Vizier had  lately become very deaf and antagonistic to German influence.  The  Wilhelmstrasse knew that France and Russia were at work, but were in  the dark as to the channels.  Therefore I sent Kim to ascertain if  Mlle.  Balniaux was visited by Abdulla at her private residence.  I  told him to learn the exact hour of arrival in each instance and the  length of the visits.  The bare fact that Abdulla might be seen in her  company in public bore no particular significance.  These women are  always accompanied by a whole retinue of officers and young Turkish  noblemen.  It is part of their work.  Their method of procedure is to  bewitch young officers and officials, attach them to their person,  make them spend huge sums of money and then play their card.  I  noticed that the money Turkish officers squandered on these women  compared to their pay and income was tremendous.  They think nothing  of going ahead blindly and buying the most expensive jewels; I have  seen them even buy motorcars.  The result is not difficult to  forecast.  The young officer soon finds himself head over heels in  debt.  Two courses are open to him.  Either he must pay the debt or be  transferred to some dreary interior post, and a Turk who has been in  the gay life of Constantinople would rather commit suicide than go to  any inland garrison.  Those women then pay the debts, exacting state  secrets as the price of their timely assistance.    Abdulla, therefore, might only be one of these hangers-on.  Kim  established connections with Mlle.  Balniaux's household and soon I  had the required information.  He brought me letters and scraps of  paper that Mlle.  Balniaux's dark skinned servants had stolen for him.  He supplemented this by conversations that the servants had overheard  and told to Kim.  All this showed me that more by good luck I had  stumbled upon the hotbed of the prime mover of the whole intrigue,  Mlle.  Balniaux.  There was not the slightest hope of intimidating or  buying over this particular lady's allegiance.  I had to learn exactly  who was subsidizing her machinations and there was no possibility of  obtaining the clew from her.    I must find the accessible person among her intimate friends.  From  time to time I had seen her with a pretty little dark-haired girl who  danced in the Folies Arabic.  I learned her name was Cecelia Coursan.  I began to frequent the Folies, a kind of cabaret crowded every night  with Turkish officers.  Admiration was no longer a delight to her and  she accepted it with a wooden smile.    The Folies is quite dissimilar from its European or American  prototypes, by reason of its Oriental atmosphere.  Most of the year  round it is conducted in the open.  Picture a large court, the center  of which is covered with a priceless Smyrna carpet.  Seated around on  little divans and silk cushions are the principal native performers,  Neulah girls wearing the teasing Yamashk, covering half their faces  although the rest of their figures are visible through gauzy Damascene  shawls.  The European performers, dressed in the latest and most  startling Paris creations, flirt and flitter among the  audience--seated round on dainty marble-topped bamboo tables,  inhaling, in the case of Madame, a dainty \"Regie,\" or if Bey or  Effendi, a Tshibuk or Narghile, gravely drawing on the amber  mouthpiece and slowly exhaling the perfumed smoke.  The gorgeous  officers' uniforms, mostly a vivid red, blue and gold; the picturesque  flowing robes and burnouses, with here and there a six-foot stalwart  silk trousered Albanian with gold and silver inlaid daggers and  pistols thrust in his sash, make a picture reminding one of the  Sheherezade.    Observing that everybody was bent on spoiling this popular little  houri by emphatic admiration, I made myself conspicuous by a  peculiarly British stony indifference.  Nor was I wrong in my tactics.  The piqued little dancer was not to be ignored.    One night she approached my table and challenged me in French, at  which I gave a noncommittal smile.  I pretended that I did not know  French.  Then she tried indifferent German and I looked at her with  puzzled blankness.  Finally she spoke to me in a piquant English and I  answered.  She spoke English extremely well and it developed that she  had been a choriphyÃ©e at the London Empire.  I let the acquaintance  grow leisurely.  One night I found her in a fit of despondency, over a  quarrel with her friend, Mlle.  Balniaux.  My subterfuge getting  effective, I was just beginning to ply her with questions when a  Turkish officer full of cognac wandered by and dropped a remark to her  in French.  It went against the grain for those swine to cast  innuendoes to a white woman and forgetting my play acting, I told him  his comments were uncalled for and advised him to draw in his horns a  bit.  After a little bluster to which I angrily replied in French, he  disappeared, and, as I sat down at the table, Cecelia was looking at  me with a queer smile.    \"I thought you did not understand French,\" she said.  \"I observe you  have a pretty good Parisian accent.\"  Then the full significance of my  blunder came to me and I felt like the classic capricornus, meaning  goat.  She said she was tired of the Folies that night and suggested a  drive.  I called a careta and as we were driving down the boulevard I  said to her:    \"Is this existence always pleasant?  Is it not as it was with that  officer, often unendurable?\"    She replied in a bantering tone, only half hiding a hurt undernote.    \"I'm getting used to it,\" she said.  \"A Turkish pig is no worse than  an English cad or a German boor.\"    The typical, philandering Broadway or Bond Street masher makes the  physiological mistake of undervaluing the innate sense of decency  inherent in every woman.  Gentle courtesy and manners impress a  courtesan by reason of the novelty.  The inverse is often useful in  dealing with a pampered society woman.    Much to the annoyance of the Turkish officers, I often thereafter took  the pretty Cecelia away from the Folies, after her performance, for a  drive, and I began to compare her small confidences with certain bits  of information that Kim had given me.  I knew, or I could pretty well  guess, that she was not staying in Constantinople, enduring the  insults of those Turkish officers, simply for the money she could earn  as a dancer.  Then I made my second dramatic play for confidence.  I  suddenly stopped going to the Folies.  I suppose it was rather  lonesome in Constantinople and a man who was not a Turk was a novelty.    One afternoon she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6952"],[0,"By Pike and Dyke: a Tale of the Rise of the Dutch Republic (#10)"],[1,"was  discharged, and the cannoneers must have known that they were far  out of range, Captain Martin felt sure that the mate's idea was a  correct one, and that the cannon had been discharged rather as a  signal than with any hope of reaching them.    \"Ned, run up into the foretop,\" the captain said, \"and keep a  sharp lookout ahead. The moon has given an advantage to those who  are on our track behind, but it gives us an advantage as against  any craft there may be ahead of us. We shall see them long before  they can see us.\"    Peters had been looking astern when the last gun was fired, and  said that by its flash he believed that he had caught sight of three  craft of some kind or other outside the ships moored off the port.    \"Then we have two miles' start if those are their galleys,\" the  captain said. \"We are stealing through the water at about the rate  of four knots, and perhaps they may row six, so it will take them  an hour to come up.\"    \"Rather more than that, I should say, captain, for the wind at times  freshens a little. It is likely to be an hour and a half before  they come up.\"    \"All the better, Peters. They will have learnt from those they  picked up from that boat that we are not a large craft, and that  our crew probably does not exceed twenty men; therefore, as those  galleys carry about twenty soldiers besides the twenty rowers, they  will not think it necessary to keep together, but will each do his  best to overtake us. One of them is sure to be faster than the  others, and if they come up singly I think we shall be able to  beat them off handsomely. It is no use discussing now whether it  is wise to fight or not. By sinking that first boat we have all  put our heads in a noose, and there is no drawing back. We have  repulsed their officers with armed force, and there will be no  mercy for any of us if we fall into their hands.\"    \"We shall fight all the better for knowing that,\" Peters said  grimly. \"The Dutchmen are learning that, as the Spaniards are finding  to their cost. There is nothing like making a man fight than the  knowledge that there is a halter waiting for him if he is beaten.\"    \"You had better get two of the guns astern, Peters, so as to fire  down into them as they come up. You may leave the others, one on  each side, for the present, and run one of them over when we see  which side they are making for. Ah! that's a nice little puff. If  it would but hold like that we should show them our heels altogether.\"    In two or three minutes the puff died out and the wind fell even  lighter than before.    \"I thought that we were going to have more of it,\" the captain said  discontentedly; \"it looked like it when the sun went down.\"    \"I think we shall have more before morning,\" Peters agreed; \"but  I am afraid it won't come in time to help us much.\"    As the moon rose they were able to make out three craft astern of  them. Two were almost abreast of each other, the third some little  distance behind.    \"That is just what I expected, Peters; they are making a race of  it. We shall have two of them on our hands at once; the other will  be too far away by the time they come up to give them any assistance.  They are about a mile astern now, I should say, and unless the wind  freshens up a bit they will be alongside in about twenty minutes.  I will give you three men here, Peters. As soon as we have fired  load again, and then slew the guns round and run them forward to  the edge of the poop, and point them down into the waist. If the  Spaniards get on board and we find them too strong for us, those  of us who can will take to the forecastle, the others will run up  here. Then sweep the Spaniards with your guns, and directly you  have fired charge down among them with pike and axe. We will do  the same, and it is hard if we do not clear the deck of them.\"    Just at this moment Ned hailed them from the top. \"There is a ship  nearly ahead of us, sir; she is lying with her sails brailed up,  evidently waiting.\"    \"How far is she off, do you think, Ned?\"    \"I should say she is four miles away,\" Ned replied.    \"Well, we need not trouble about her for the present; there will  be time to think about her when we have finished with these fellows  behind. You can come down now, Ned.\"    In a few words the captain now explained his intentions to his men.    \"I hope, lads, that we shall be able to prevent their getting  a footing on the deck; but if they do, and we find we can't beat  them back, as soon as I give the word you are to take either to  the forecastle or to the poop. Mr. Peters will have the two guns  there ready to sweep them with bullets. The moment he has fired give  a cheer and rush down upon them from both sides. We will clear them  off again, never fear. Ned, you will be in charge in the waist until  I rejoin you. Get ready to run one of the guns over the instant I  tell you on which side they are coming up. Depress them as much as  you can. I shall take one gun and you take the other, and be sure  you don't fire until you see a boat well under the muzzle of your  gun. Mind it's the boat you are to aim at, and not the men.\"    Captain Martin again ascended to the poop and joined Peters. The  two boats were now but a few hundred yards astern, and they could  hear the officers cheering on the rowers to exert themselves to  the utmost. The third boat was fully a quarter of a mile behind  the leaders. When they approached within a hundred yards a fire of  musketry was opened.    \"Lie down under the bulwarks, men,\" Captain Martin said to the three  sailors. \"It is no use risking your lives unnecessarily. I expect  one boat will come one side and one the other, Peters. If they do  we will both take the one coming up on the port side. One of us  may miss, and it is better to make sure of one boat if we can. I  think we can make pretty sure of beating off the other. Yes, there  they are separating. Now work your gun round a bit, so that it  bears on a point about twenty yards astern and a boat's length on  the port side. I will do the same. Have you done that?\"    \"Yes, I think I have about got it, sir.\"    \"Very well, then. Stoop down now, or we may get hit before it is  time to fire.\"    The bulwarks round the poop were only about a foot high, but sitting  back from them the captain and the mate were protected from the  bullets that were now singing briskly over the stern of the ship.    \"They are coming up, Peters,\" Captain Martin said. \"Now kneel  up and look along your gun; get your match ready, and do not fire  till you see right into the boat, then clap on your match whether  I fire or not.\"    The boat came racing along until when within some twenty yards of  the stern, the cannons were discharged almost simultaneously. The  sound was succeeded by a chorus of screams and yells; the contents  of both guns had struck the boat fairly midships, and she sank  almost instantly. As soon as they had fired Captain Martin ran  forward and joined the crew in the waist. He had already passed  the word to Ned to get both guns over to the starboard side, and  he at once took charge of one while Ned stood at the other. The  Spaniards had pushed straight on without waiting to pick up their  drowning comrades in the other boat, and in a minute were alongside.  So close did the helmsman bring the boat to the side that the guns  could not be depressed so as to bear upon her, and a moment later  the Spaniards were climbing up the sides of the vessel, the rowers  dropping their oars and seizing axes and joining the soldiers.    \"Never mind the gun, Ned; it is useless at present. Now, lads,  drive them back as they come up.\"    With pike and hatchet the sailors met the Spaniards as they tried  to climb up. The cook had brought his caldron of boiling water to  the bulwarks, and threw pailful after pailful down into the boat,  while the carpenter bailed over boiling pitch with the great ladle.  Terrible yells and screams rose from the boat, and the soldiers in  vain tried to gain a footing upon the ship's deck. As they appeared  above the level of the bulwarks they were met either with thrust  of pike or with a crashing blow from an axe, and it was but three  or four minutes from the moment that the fight began that the boat  cast off and dropped behind, more than half those on board being  killed or disabled. A loud cheer broke from the crew.    \"Shall I run the guns back to the stern again,\" Peters asked from  above, \"and give them a parting dose?\"    \"No, no,\" Captain Martin said, \"let them go, Peters; we are fighting  to defend ourselves, and have done them mischief enough. See what  the third boat is doing, though.\"    \"They have stopped rowing,\" Peters said, after going to the stern.  \"I think they are picking up some swimmers from the boat we sank.  There cannot be many of them, for most of the rowers would have  been killed by our discharges, and the soldiers in their armour  will have sunk at once.\"    Captain Martin now ascended to the poop. In a short time the boat  joined that which had dropped astern, which was lying helpless in  the water, no attempt having been made to man the oars, as most of  the unwounded men were scalded more or less severely. Their report  was evidently not encouraging, and the third boat made no attempt  to pursue. Some of her oarsmen were shifted to the other boat, and  together they turned and made back for Amsterdam.    \"Now then for this vessel ahead,\" Captain Martin said; \"that is a  much more serious business than the boats.\"    The vessel, which was some two miles ahead of them, had now set  some of her sails, and was heading towards them.    \"They can make us out now plainly enough, Peters, and the firing  will of course have told them we are the vessel that they are in  search of. I don't think that there is any getting away from them.\"    \"I don't see that there is,\" the mate agreed. \"Whichever way we  edged off they could cut us"]]]
