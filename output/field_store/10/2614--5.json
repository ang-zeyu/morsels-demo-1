Fearlessly Dave drove into that cloud. It was a long one. A full minute  passed, another, and they were out.    Beyond them now was all clear, blue sky. There was no spot against that  patch of blue.    The Young Lord took the controls. They spiralled downward toward the  sea. At last they were beneath the cloud. There was nothing hiding  there. But on the surface of the sea was a white spot. It was not foam.  There were no white-caps.    \"Good!\" exclaimed the Young Lord. \"We'll head for home. If we hurry a  bit we'll be in time for tea.\" And they were.    \"We got that Dornier right enough,\" the Young Lord whispered the minute  they were on solid ground again. \"But not a word about this! It's  frightfully irregular, I'm afraid.\"    \"I'm sure it is,\" Dave agreed.    \"And after all, it's not your war,\" his companion added.    \"No. Of course not,\" Dave agreed. \"It's not my war.\" For the first time  in his life those words seemed a bit strange.    At headquarters Dave asked for coffee and got it, good coffee served by  a bright faced English girl.    He had just taken his first swallow when two young men entered. At once  the Young Lord was on his feet.    The slim, dark-eyed one of the new arrivals said: \"As you were.\" At once  tension relaxed.    \"Commander Knox,\" said the Young Lord, \"I want you to meet my friend  Dave Barnes from America. He thinks he can fly.\" He grinned slyly.    \"All Americans think that.\" The Squad Commander chuckled. \"Didn't you  ever notice that?\"    \"Yes--yes I have,\" the Young Lord agreed. \"And mostly they can't. But  this chap,\"--he gave Dave a quick grin--\"I shouldn't wonder if he could  fly. Oh, just the least little bit.\"    \"You wouldn't be spoofing us?\" said the red-headed companion of the  Commander. He was grinning broadly.    \"No one could spoof you!\" the Young Lord laughed. \"You've already been  spoofed.\"    \"Dave,\" he said, turning to his companion, \"meet the singing murderer.  We call him the Lark because he sings as he flies. You should hear him  roaring away! He sings 'On the Road to Mandalay' while he swoops down on  the tail of some unsuspecting Messerschmitt and blasts him from the  sky.\"    \"That,\" said the Lark without smiling, \"may be a joke. It works for all  that. I learned the trick when I was a boy fishing for salmon in  Scotland. If I could whistle, carrying a tune, while I was landing a big  one, I'd not get excited and I'd land my fish. It's the same with the  sky fighting. If you can carry a tune in the thick of it--\"    \"If you can,\" laughed Dave, \"then I'll say you're good!\"    \"He's right as he possibly can be,\" said the Commander.    \"The good old Leader of Squadron 73 over in France used to say: 'Boys,  you may have as many good points as you like, but two are absolutely  necessary: courage that will stick, and an unfailing sense of humor.  Nothing keeps up a fellow's sense of humor better than a song.'    \"Guess we'll have to toddle along.\" The Commander moved away. \"Good to  have met you, Barnes. If you can really fly, and I must say you do look  the part, we'll sign you up just any time you say.\" At that he and the  Lark vanished through the swinging doors.    As Dave stared after them, awed respect was registered in his eyes. \"So  he was with Squadron 73!\" he murmured.    \"Sure was.\" Applegate beamed. \"In France, all the way, right through the  Blitzkrieg. That was the fightingest aggregation that ever flew in  formation. They shot down more than a hundred planes for sure, and sent  a likely hundred more limping home.\"    \"How many came back to tell the story?\" Dave was visibly impressed.    \"Nearly all,\" was the reply. \"I think they lost two commissioned and two  non-commissioned officers. That was all.\"    \"Sayee!\" Dave murmured. \"Air fighting is almost as safe as football!\"    \"Absolutely,\" his companion agreed. \"Providing you know your stuff and  have been born in the air.\"    \"And that,\" Dave thought, as he started for home some little time later,  \"is how I keep out of this man's war. I'd better look up the plane  schedule to Lisbon tomorrow.\" But would he?                                        _Chapter_ XI                              Cobbler or Spy?      Dave walked toward Ramsey Farm in a thoughtful mood. Always for him, in  the past, the ability to do a thing well had meant a clear track ahead.  \"But now,\" he whispered, stopping stock still in the road to think. With  the Young Lord's help he had accomplished something that in this  war-shattered land seemed rather more than well worth doing.    There was nothing startling about the part he had played. Back in  America his uncle, a World War ace, had put him through his paces, that  was all. In a staunch old two-seater they had banked, rolled, power  dived and looped the loop until he really knew how. What fun it had  been! He had not thought of it as preparation for anything. Yet today,  when the test came, he was prepared. Yes, the ability to do a thing had  always meant \"Go ahead.\"    \"I could do it all again,\" he assured himself as he thought of the day's  adventure.    For a moment more he stood there looking at the blue sky, white clouds,  and gay autumn leaves that were England at her best. \"This is England,\"  he whispered, \"Bit by bit it is being destroyed by one man's hate and  lust for power.\"    \"Damn!\" he swore softly. Then he hurried on.    He decided to take the long way home, the road that ran through  Warmington. \"Shoemakers,\" he thought, \"always have your work finished  the second time, never the first. My boots will be done.\"    \"Here you are, sir,\" said old John, handing out a neat package and  taking the pay. \"I 'opes you find them satisfactory, sir.\"    \"Oh, I shall, I am sure,\" Dave said absent-mindedly. He was not thinking  of the boots. His eyes were once more upon the young cobbler in the far  corner. As before, his face hidden, he was bent low over his work.    \"I 'opes you've 'ad a pleasant afternoon,\" said old John.    \"Oh! Very!\" said Dave.    \"If he only knew,\" he murmured with a low laugh after he had left the  shop.    Across the street was the village Pub. Its sign proclaimed it to be Ye  Old Angel Inn. How long did an angel have to live in order to be  considered really old, Dave asked himself whimsically. He had thought of  angels as being ageless. Perhaps there weren't any angels after all. He  had once seen a picture of a French war plane going down in flames, and  of two angels waiting, with hands crossed, to catch the unhappy pilot as  he fell. \"Shall I ever be in need of two angels?\" he asked himself  dreamily.    He crossed the street to enter Ye Old Angel Inn. He liked these English  Pubs. They were village clubs. There was about them a pleasant aroma of  beef roasting over an open fire, of hot toddy and strange English  tobacco. He could, he thought, stand for one more cup of coffee. The  weather had suddenly turned cloudy, damp and cold.    The coffee was good. He lingered over it, then ordered a second cup.    As he sat there he heard voices. Two villagers sat at a table in the  corner drinking hot toddy.    \"I'm tellin' ye now, James,\" one voice rose sharply, \"'e's nothin' more  nor less than a bloomin' Jerry. 'E's a spy, that 'e is.\"    \"Aw now, Danny,\" the other admonished, \"you know what old John told you  'e is. 'E's 'Ollander, no more, nor no less. 'Is papers they is all in  horder.\"    \"I know. I know,\" Danny agreed petulantly. \"But that don't make it so.  You know as well as I know 'ow easy as nothin' it is fer a Jerry to git  papers fixed to suit 'is own self.    \"Now look, Jimmy.\" Danny's voice dropped. \"Ye mind the last war. There  were our castle, Warmington Castle, as fine an hedifice as there be in  all Hengland. An' what 'appens? Ramsey, over at the farm, 'e 'ires  'imself a Jerry, a prisoner of war 'e was. 'e treats 'im like a  long-lost brother, Ramsey does. An' what 'appens? I asks you, what  'appens?\"    \"It weren't never proved that it were this Jerry that signaled to the  bloomin' airplane that come over an' blasted the castle,\" James  protested.    \"I know--I know. But who would doubt it?\"    And so the argument ended. Dave finished his coffee, then wandered out  into the chill of falling night. Danny and James had given him fresh  food for serious thought.    Cherry was booked for a return to her subway studio on the following  evening. Dave spent the greater part of that day teaching her a new  song. He knew the tune and could pick it out for her on the piano. By  great good fortune he found the words written out in longhand on a scrap  of paper in his Sunday clothes.    \"It's not a new song,\" he told her. \"In fact, it's more than twenty  years old. An orchestra leader named Orrin Tucker dug it out of the file  and gave it to his little five-foot singing doll named Bonnie Baker.  It's gone across America like a Nebraska cyclone. This is it:      \"Oh! Johnny! Oh! Johnny!    How you can love!    Oh! Johnny! Oh! Johnny!    Heavens above.\"    \"Catchy,\" said Cherry, beginning to hum it.    Catchy was right, and Cherry was the one person in all the world to set  England on fire with it.    That night in the chill damp of the subway, she sang it over and over.  Next day in the airdromes and factories, barracks, schools, stores and  on the street, one might hear: \"Oh! Johnny! Oh! Johnny!\"    The song was made. So too was Cherry. In the days that followed she was  to become the sweetheart of all England. Newspapers were to print her  picture in color. These pictures were to appear on the rough board walls  of cantonments all over England, and in the cabins of boats, large and  small, sailing the dangerous North Sea.    She was to be taken up by the nobility. Lady Perkins, a friend of the  Young Lord, who lived in London, was to make her a part of her  household, with privilege of coming and going as she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4932"],[0,"A Knight of the White Cross: A Tale of the Siege of Rhodes (#10)"],[1,"is supper,\" De Lille said, jumping up. \"We will leave you here  while we go down to stand behind our lord's chair. When the meal is over  we will bring a pasty or something else good, and a measure of wine,  and have our supper together up here; and we will tell the servitors to  bring up another pallet for you. Of course, you can go down with us if  you like.\"    \"Thank you, I would much rather stay here. Every one would be strange to  me, and having nothing to do I should feel in the way.\"    The boys nodded, and taking their caps ran off, while Gervaise, tired by  the excitement of the day, lay down on the bed which a servant brought  up a few minutes after they had left him, and slept soundly until their  return.    \"I think I have been asleep,\" he said, starting up when they entered the  room again.    \"You look as if you had, anyhow,\" De Lille laughed. \"It was the best  thing you could do. We have brought up supper. We generally sit down  and eat after the knights have done, but this is much better, as you are  here.\" They sat down on the beds, carved the pasty with their daggers,  and after they had finished Gervaise gladly accepted the proposal of the  others to take a walk round the walls.    They started from the corner of the castle looking down upon the spit of  land dividing the two ports.    \"You see,\" De Lille said, \"there is a row of small islands across the  mouth of the outer port, and the guns of St. Nicholas, and those on this  wall, would prevent any hostile fleet from entering.\"    \"I hardly see what use that port is, for it lies altogether outside the  town, and vessels could not unload there.\"    \"No. Still, it forms a useful place of refuge. In case a great fleet  came to attack us, our galleys would lay up in the inner port, which  would be cleared of all the merchant craft, as these would hamper the  defence; they would, therefore, be sent round into the outer port, where  they would be safe from any attack by sea, although they would doubtless  be burnt did an army besiege the town.\"    Passing along the walls of the grand master's palace, which was a  strongly fortified building, and formed a citadel that could be defended  after the lower town and the rest of the castle had been taken, they  came to the western angle of the fortifications.    \"You must know that each langue has charge of a separate part of the  wall. From the foot of the mole of St. Nicholas to the grand master's  palace it is in charge of France. On the line where we now are, between  the palace and the gate of St. George, it is held by Germany. From that  gate to the Spanish tower Auvergne is posted. England takes the wall  between the Spanish tower and that of St. Mary. You defend only the  lower storey of that tower, the upper part being held by Aragon, whose  charge extends up to the gate of St. John. Thence to the tower of  Italy--behind which lies the Jews' quarter--Provence is in charge, while  the sea front thence to the mole of St. Nicholas, is held by Italy  and Castile, each taking half. Not only have the langues the charge of  defending each its portion of the wall, but of keeping it in order at  all times; and I may say that nowhere is the wall better kept or more  fairly decorated with carvings than where England holds.\"    \"You have not told me who defends the palace itself.\"    \"That is in charge of a force composed of equal numbers of picked  knights from each langue.\"    Gervaise leant on the battlement and looked with admiration at the scene  beyond. The land side was surrounded by hills, the ground rising  very gradually from the foot of the walls. Every yard of ground was  cultivated, and was covered with brilliant vegetation. Groves and  orchards occurred thickly, while the slopes were dotted with chapels,  summer houses--in which the natives of the city spent most of their time  in the hot season--and other rustic buildings.    \"What a rich and beautiful country!\" he said.    \"It is very pleasant to look at,\" De Lille agreed. \"But all this would  be a sore disadvantage to us if the Turks were besieging us, for the  groves and orchards would conceal their approaches, the walls and  buildings would give them shelter, and our cannon would be of little use  until they reached the farther side of the ditch. If the Turks come,  I hear it is decided to level all the buildings and walls, and to chop  down every tree.\"    \"If they were to plant their cannon on the hills they would do us much  harm,\" Gervaise remarked.    \"The Turks are clumsy gunners they say,\" Deauville replied, \"and they  would but waste their powder and ball at that distance, without making a  breach in our walls.\"    \"Even if they did, they could surely scarce pass that deep fosse,\"  Gervaise said, looking down into the tremendous cutting in the solid  rock that ran round the whole circuit of the walls; it was from forty  to sixty feet deep, and from ninety to a hundred and forty feet wide. It  was from this great cutting that the stones for the construction of the  walls, towers, and buildings of the town had been taken, the work having  been going on ever since the knights established themselves at Rhodes,  and being performed by a host of captives taken in war, together with  labour hired from neighboring islands. Upon this immense work the Order  had expended no small proportion of their revenue since their capture  of the island in 1310, and the result was a fortress that, under the  conditions of warfare of that age, seemed almost impregnable; and this  without any natural advantage of position.    In addition to the five great towers or bastions, the wall was  strengthened by square towers at short intervals. On looking down from  the wall upon which the three pages were standing, on to the lower town,  the view was a singular one. The houses were all built of stone, with  flat roofs, after the manner of most Eastern cities. The streets were  very narrow, and were crossed at frequent intervals by broad stone  arches. These had the effect, not only of giving shelter from an enemy's  fire, but of affording means by which troops could march rapidly across  the town upon the roofs of the houses to reinforce the defenders of the  wall, wherever pressed by the enemy. Thus the town from above presented  the appearance of a great pavement, broken only by dark and frequently  interrupted lines.    \"How different to the towns at home!\" Gervaise exclaimed, as, after  gazing long upon the beautiful country outside the walls, he turned and  looked inward. \"One would hardly know that it was a town at all.\"    \"Yes, it is rather different to the view from the top of the tower of  Notre Dame, which I ascended while I was staying in Paris. But this sort  of building is best here; the thickness of the stone roofs keeps out  the heat of the sun, and it is only when it is almost overhead that it  shines down into the narrow streets. As you can see by the number of  the people on the roofs, they use them as a resort in the evening. Then  carpets are spread, and they receive visitors, and can talk to their  neighbours over the low walls that separate the roofs. You can trace the  divisions. Some of the house roofs are larger than others, but all are  upon the same level; this being the regulation, in order that there  might be free passage everywhere for the troops.\"    By the time they had made the circuit of the walls darkness had fallen,  and concealed the martial features of the scene. Lights twinkled  everywhere upon the stone terraces; the sound of lutes and other musical  instruments came up softly on the still air, with the hum of talk and  laughter. The sea lay as smooth as a mirror, and reflected the light of  the stars, and the black hulls of the galleys and ships in the harbour  lay still and motionless.    Greatly pleased with his first experience of the city that was to be his  future home, Gervaise returned, with his companions, to the auberge of  Auvergne.    The next morning the bailiff D'Aubusson bade Gervaise accompany him to  the palace of the grand master. Here he introduced him to Orsini, an  old and feeble man, who, after a few kind words, handed him over to the  chamberlain, who, in turn, led him to the official who was in charge of  the pages. That officer took him down to the courtyard, where four young  knights were engaged in superintending the military exercises of the  pages. The scene was exactly the same as that to which Gervaise had been  accustomed at the House in London. Some of the lads were fighting with  blunted swords, others were swinging heavy bars of iron, climbing ropes,  or vaulting on to the back of a wooden horse. All paused as the official  entered with his charge.    \"This is your new comrade, boys,\" he said--\"Master Gervaise Tresham, a  member of the English langue. Be good comrades to him. By the reports I  hear I am sure that you will find him a worthy companion.\"    The pages had been prepared to like the newcomer, for it was well known  that he owed his appointment to the bailiff of Auvergne, who was the  most popular of the officials of the Order, and who was already regarded  as the grand master. His appearance confirmed their anticipation. His  fair complexion and nut brown hair tinged with gold, cut somewhat short,  but with a natural wave, contrasted with their darker locks and faces  bronzed by the sun. There was an honest and frank look in his grey eyes,  and an expression of good temper on his face, though the square chin and  firm lips spoke of earnestness and resolution of purpose. The official  took him round the circle and presented him first to the knights and  then to each of his comrades.    \"You may as well join them in their exercises. In that way you will  sooner become at home with them.\"    Gervaise at once laid down his mantle, removed his doublet, and then  joined the others. There was but one half hour remaining before they  broke off to go to dinner, which was at "]]]
