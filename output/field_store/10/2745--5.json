Not a sound broke the deathlike stillness of the lonely scene, save the  labored breathing of the sleeping jaguar.    Never allowing his gaze to leave the creature, he continued to reach for  the firearm until he felt his hand touch the stock.    As complete control as he had maintained over himself so far in the trying  ordeal, at this critical moment he so far forgot himself as to draw a long  breath--a breath of relief to think that he had something with which to  defend himself.    That breath was instantly answered by a terrific growl!    It had awakened the light-sleeping beast, which quickly raised its head,  and its whole appearance immediately changed, as it glared furiously  around.    It seemed to realize at once that it had been fooled by this human  creature within its clutch, and with another growl, louder, fiercer and  more startling than any yet, it prepared to spring on its new victim.    But it was no quicker of action than Jack, who knew that his life hung on  prompt work. At the same time he lifted the carbine from the ground, he  cocked the weapon. At that moment the open jaws of the aroused jaguar were  thrust into his face, and the hot breath of the wild creature fanned his  cheek. The next instant he ran the muzzle of the firearm into the maddened  brute's throat and pulled the trigger.    A dull report followed, the jaguar's head was blown into fragments, and  Jack knew that his life was saved.          Chapter XII    Put to the Test        Though he had no more to fear from this jaguar, Jack knew that its mate  was likely to return at any moment, and as soon as he had recovered  somewhat from the effect of the ordeal through which he had passed, he  freed himself from the weight of the pony's body.    He was glad to find that his limb had not received any serious injury,  though it was so paralyzed from lying under the pressure that it was a few  minutes before he could stand alone.    But he lost no more time than he could avoid before he left the place,  feeling that his situation even then was not pleasant to contemplate. He  was not only afoot in the heart of a trackless wilderness, but many miles  from the nearest point of civilization.    Half an hour after leaving the scene of the jaguar's attack, he made a  discovery which caused him no little concern.    He had lost his compass.    Realizing the risk of returning to the fatal spot, as well as the  uncertainty of finding the lost instrument, he kept on without it,  endeavoring to pursue as direct a course as possible.    In this he was unsuccessful, and two days later he was wandering at random  through the intricate labyrinths of a Peruvian forest, nearly worn out and  disheartened.    Hoping that his shots might be heard by some one who would come to his  rescue, he had fired all but the last load of ammunition he had with him,  and that charge was in his carbine.    \"I might as well discharge that,\" he said to himself. \"It is my last  chance and I might as well take it now as later. It is useless for me to  try to find my way out of this wilderness.\"    In his desperation he cocked the weapon, and pointing it skyward pulled  the trigger.    Loud and long rang out the report on the deep silence of the forest, the  distant foothills taking up the sound and flinging it back to the valleys  in echoes that repeated the detonation far and wide. As the last sullen  sound died away in the distance he leaned against one of the trees, saying  half aloud:    \"I might as well meet the worst here as anywhere.\"    Five, ten, fifteen minutes passed away, and satisfied that his last shot  had been fired in vain, Jack started to resume his aimless wanderings,  when the sound of footsteps fell upon his ears.    At first he thought it might be some wild beast prowling through the  woods, but it was not long before a human figure burst into sight.    There was little of beauty in the youthful stranger who had thus  unceremoniously appeared, but Jack had never been so glad to see any one  in his life.    At sight of his woebegone countenance the newcomer came to a sudden halt  in his impetuous advance, exclaiming in a voice with a peculiar and  characteristic nasal twang:    \"Consarn ye! who air yeou scrouched down there in that way? Aair yeou the  feller who has been wasting ammunition so like a scart peon?\"    The speaker's tone was not unfriendly, and Jack was nearly overjoyed to  find that the new-comer was not a Peruvian.    Springing from his seat on a fallen tree, where he had sunk in his  respair, he cried in genuine gladness:    \"You're an American!\"    \"No more'n yeou air!\" replied the other, brushing back his long blonde  hair from his forehead as he spoke, and looking straight into our hero's  countenance with a pair of deep blue eyes.    Then, when the two had stared upon each other for fully a minute, both  burst into a fit of laughter.    \"Shoo neow!\" exclaimed the Yankee boy, \"who air yeou and what air yeou  doing here?\"    \"I might ask the same question of you,\" replied Jack. \"My name is John  North and I come from Banton, Connecticut.    \"Bet yeou air called Jack every time. My name is Plummer Plucky, but I'm  called Plum for short, though that is all they can make short about me. I  hail from _New_ England too, and I'll bet my dad is hoeing taters in  sight of Plymouth Rock.\"    \"I am lost in this wilderness,\" went on Jack. \"I hope you can show me the  way out.\"    \"Bet your boots on that. I live, leastways stop, not three hours' tramp  from here, though if yeou had come to-morrer yeou wouldn't found me here.  I have been working on the estancia of Don de Estuaray, the dirtiest,  meanest, miserliest, yellowest old Spaniard that ever drew the breath o'  this beautiful country.\"    \"Evidently you love the Don,\" said Jack, with a smile.    \"Do I? Do you know what he pays me fer work thet's enought to kill a man?\"    \"I haven't the slightest idea.\"    \"No more you have. He pays me three dollars and sixty cents a month--think  of it--if you can!\"    \"That's a small fortune\" went on Jack. He rather liked the fellow before  him. \"I suppose you've got a pile saved up in the bank out of it.\"    \"Think so? Consarn ye, yer ain't got no right to think so!\" And now the  other really looked somewhat angry.    \"No, I don't think so,\" answered Jack, promptly. \"I was only fooling. They  don't pay big wages down here--I've found that out--down near the coast,  where I worked at starvation wages myself.\"    \"Wall, I aint jest starved,\" said the other youth, somewhat mollified. \"I  git feed enough--leas'-wise, I take what I want. But it ain't enough  money--no it ain't--nohow, consarn him anyway!\"    Jack had too much at stake to desire a quarrel with his new-found  acquaintance, so he hastened to say:    \"I hope you will forgive me if I have said anything to offend. I trust we  shall be friends.\"    Whatever of anger Plum had shown quickly left his honest countenance, and  frankly holding out a hand, he said:    \"I never pick a quarrel with any one, but I won't let any one tread on my  toes. I reckon we shall be friends.\"    The clasp of the hands which followed cemented the firmest friendship of  Jack North's life, an acquaintance which, notwithstanding its inauspicious  beginning, was destined to ripen into a heart-felt intimacy.    The hand-shaking over, the twain, Plum leading the way, started in the  direction whence the latter had come at the sound of Jack's carbine. On  the way toward the estancia where the former had been working, our hero  learned the complete story of his past life; how he had left home to win a  fortune and drifted over the world until he was now employed by this Don  de Estuaray at the princely sum which had been the crumb of argument  between them a few minutes before.    Jack in turn told the other his story, except that part bearing upon the  island of treasure, and long before they had reached signs of civilization  they had become fast friends.    So favorably impressed was Jack with the appearance of his new-found chum  that he proposed that Plum should apply for the position of fireman on the  St. Resa railroad, a proposition which met the other boy's hearty approval  the moment he learned the wages he was likely to get His first question  was:    \"Do yeou s'pose they will have me?\"    \"Gladly. It isn't a question of that, but whether you have the sand to  stand up in a spot where you are likely to lose your life any minute.\"    \"Reckon I can stand up where you can, and if I do lay down it will be to  stay there. Give me your hand, old feller. I like yeou.\"    They were now approaching the estancia of Don de Estuaray, who lived in a  pleasant valley several miles from any settlement, and as they advanced  Jack could not help noticing the tall growth of a patch of vegetation on  their right hand, as they were entering the spacious grounds.    To his wonder he saw cotton plants that reached far above his head and  sugar cane which stood like forest trees. Plum Plucky, standing on his  shoulders, with Fret Offut, had he been living then and there, on his  shoulders, could not have reached the top of the lowest plants!    He saw indigo plants that amazed him for their size, and altogether it was  such a sight as he had never seen.    A short distance away he saw a field of oats which reared their heads into  the air to a height of more than fifteen feet.    Plum Plucky seeing the look of surprise on his countenance, said:    \"Can't guess what made that stuff grow so? I can tell you. I just brought  down some of that funny dirt found in the barren spots on the hills yonder  and put a good lot round the roots. It beats all creation how it sends the  stuff into the air. The don said I'd kill it all, but I knowed better, for  I had seen the wild stuff growing like fun all round the edges of sich  places. But it don't seem to hitch on in the spots themselves. S'pect it's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7849"],[0,"The Trial (#10)"],[1,"able to make a calm  assessment of it, and, assuming that this so-called court is of any real  importance, it will be very much to your advantage to listen to what I  have to say.  If you want to discuss what I say, please don't bother to  write it down until later on, I don't have any time to waste and I'll  soon be leaving.\"            There was immediate silence, which showed how well K. was in  control of the crowd.  There were no shouts among them as there had been  at the start, no-one even applauded, but if they weren't already  persuaded they seemed very close to it.            K was pleased at the tension among all the people there as they  listened to him, a rustling rose from the silence which was more  invigorating than the most ecstatic applause could have been.  \"There is  no doubt,\" he said quietly, \"that there is some enormous organisation  determining what is said by this court.  In my case this includes my  arrest and the examination taking place here today, an organisation that  employs policemen who can be bribed, oafish supervisors and judges of  whom nothing better can be said than that they are not as arrogant as  some others.  This organisation even maintains a high-level judiciary  along with its train of countless servants, scribes, policemen and all  the other assistance that  it needs, perhaps even executioners and  torturers - I'm not afraid of using those words. And what, gentlemen, is  the purpose of this enormous organisation?  Its purpose is to arrest  innocent people and wage pointless prosecutions against them which, as  in my case, lead to no result.  How are we to avoid those in office  becoming deeply corrupt when everything is devoid of meaning?  That is  impossible, not even the highest judge would be able to achieve that for  himself.  That is why policemen try to steal the clothes off the back of  those they arrest, that is why supervisors break into the homes of  people they do not know, that is why innocent people are humiliated in  front of crowds rather than being given a proper trial.  The policemen  only talked about the warehouses where they put the property of those  they arrest, I would like to see these warehouses where the hard won  possessions of people under arrest is left to decay, if, that is, it's  not stolen by the thieving hands of the warehouse workers.\"            K. was interrupted by a screeching from the far end of the hall,  he shaded his eyes to see that far, as the dull light of day made the  smoke whitish and hard to see through.  It was the washerwoman whom K.  had recognised as a likely source of disturbance as soon as she had  entered.  It was hard to see now whether it was her fault or not.  K.  could only see that a man had pulled her into a corner by the door and  was pressing himself against her.  But it was not her who was screaming,  but the man, he had opened his mouth wide and looked up at the ceiling.  A small circle had formed around the two of them, the visitors near him  in the gallery seemed delighted that the serious tone K. had introduced  into the gathering had been disturbed in this way.   K.'s first thought  was to run over there, and he also thought that everyone would want to  bring things back into order there or at least to make the pair leave  the room, but the first row of people in front of him stayed were they  were, no-one moved and no-one let K. through.  On the contrary, they  stood in his way, old men held out their arms in front of him and a hand  from somewhere - he did not have the time to turn round - took hold of  his collar.  K., by this time, had forgotten about the pair, it seemed  to him that his freedom was being limited as if his arrest was being  taken seriously, and, without any thought for what he was doing, he  jumped down from the podium.  Now he stood face to face with the crowd.  Had he judged the people properly?  Had he put too much faith in the  effect of his speech?  Had they been putting up a pretence all the time  he had been speaking, and now that he come to the end and to what must  follow, were they tired of pretending?  What faces they were, all around  him!  Dark, little eyes flickered here and there, cheeks drooped down  like on drunken men, their long beards were thin and stiff, if they took  hold of them it was more like they were making their hands into claws,  not as if they were taking hold of their own beards.  But underneath  those beards - and this was the real discovery made by K. - there were  badges of various sizes and colours shining on the collars of their  coats.  As far as he could see, every one of them was wearing one of  these badges.  All of them belonged to the same group, even though they  seemed to be divided to the right and the left of him, and when he  suddenly turned round he saw the same badge on the collar of the  examining judge who calmly looked down at him with his hands in his lap.  \"So,\" called out K, throwing his arms in the air as if this sudden  realisation needed more room, \"all of you are working for this  organisation, I see now that you are all the very bunch of cheats and  liars I've just been speaking about, you've all pressed yourselves in  here in order to listen in and snoop on me, you gave the impression of  having formed into factions, one of you even applauded me to test me  out, and you wanted to learn how to trap an innocent man!   Well, I hope  you haven't come here for nothing, I hope you've either had some fun  from someone who expected you to defend his innocence or else - let go  of me or I'll hit you,\" shouted K. to a quivery old man who had pressed  himself especially close to him - \"or else that you've actually learned  something.  And so I wish you good luck in your trade.\"  He briskly took  his hat from where it lay on the edge of the table and, surrounded by a  silence caused perhaps by the completeness of their surprise, pushed his  way to the exit.  However, the examining judge seems to have moved even  more quickly than K., as he was waiting for him at the doorway.  \"One  moment,\" he said.  K. stood where he was, but looked at the door with  his hand already on its handle rather than at the judge.  \"I merely  wanted to draw your attention,\" said the judge, \"to something you seem  not yet to be aware of: today, you have robbed yourself of the  advantages that a hearing of this sort always gives to someone who is  under arrest.\"  K. laughed towards the door.  \"You bunch of louts,\" he  called, \"you can keep all your hearings as a present from me,\" then  opened the door and hurried down the steps.  Behind him, the noise of  the assembly rose as it became lively once more and probably began to  discuss these events as if making a scientific study of them.          Chapter Three   In the empty Courtroom - The Student - The Offices            Every day over the following week, K. expected another summons to  arrive, he could not believe that his rejection of any more hearings had  been taken literally, and when the expected summons really had not come  by Saturday evening he took it to mean that he was expected, without  being told, to appear at the same place at the same time.  So on Sunday,  he set out once more in the same direction, going without hesitation up  the steps and through the corridors; some of the people remembered him  and greeted him from their doorways, but he no longer needed to ask  anyone the way and soon arrived at the right door.  It was opened as  soon as he knocked and, paying no attention to the woman he had seen  last time who was standing at the doorway, he was about to go straight  into the adjoining room when she said to him \"There's no session today\".  \"What do you mean; no session?\" he asked, unable to believe it.  But the  woman persuaded him by opening the door to the next room.  It was indeed  empty, and looked even more dismal empty than it had the previous  Sunday.  On the podium stood the table exactly as it had been before  with a few books laying on it.  \"Can I have a look at those books?\"  asked K., not because he was especially curious but so that he would not  have come for nothing.  \"No,\" said the woman as she re-closed the door,  \"that's not allowed.  Those books belong to the examining judge.\"  \"I  see,\" said K., and nodded, \"those books must be law books, and that's  how this court does things, not only to try people who are innocent but  even to try them without letting them know what's going on.\"  \"I expect  you're right,\" said the woman, who had not understood exactly what he  meant.  \"I'd better go away again, then,\" said K.  \"Should I give a message to the examining judge?\" asked the woman.  \"Do  you know him, then?\" asked K.  \"Of course I know him,\" said the woman,  \"my husband is the court usher.\"  It was only now that K. noticed that  the room, which before had held nothing but a wash-tub, had been fitted  out as a living room.  The woman saw how surprised he was and said,  \"Yes, we're allowed to live here as we like, only we have to clear the  room out when the court's in session.  There's lots of disadvantages to  my husband's job.\"  \"It's not so much the room that surprises me,\" said  K., looking at her crossly, \"it's your being married that shocks me.\"  \"Are you thinking about what happened last time the court was in  session, when I disturbed what you were saying?\" asked the woman.  \"Of  course,\" said K., \"it's in the past now and I've nearly forgotten about  it, but at the time it made me furious.  And now you tell me yourself  that you are a married woman.\"  \"It wasn't any disadvantage for you to  have your speech interrupted.  The way they talked about you after you'd  gone was really bad.\"  \"That could well be,\" said K., turning away, \"but  it does not excuse you.\"  \"There's no-one I know who'd hold it against  me,\" said the woman. \"Him, who put his arms around me, he's been chasing  after me for a long time.  I might not be very attractive for most"]]]
