She is only a pale and drooping flower compared with what she was. I am  positive it is not a sickness--unless it is mental. I have a suspicion.  It is almost too terrible to put into words. You will be going up there  tonight--you will be alone with her, will talk with her, may learn a  great deal if you understand what it is that is eating like a canker in  my mind. Will you help me to discover her secret?\" He leaned toward  Keith. He was no longer the man of iron. There was something intensely  human in his face.    \"There is no other man on earth I would confide this matter to,\" he  went on slowly. \"It will take--a gentleman--to handle it, someone who  is big enough to forget if my suspicion is untrue, and who will  understand fully what sacrilege means should it prove true. It is  extremely delicate. I hesitate. And yet--I am waiting, Conniston. Is it  necessary to ask you to pledge secrecy in the matter?\"    Keith held out a hand. McDowell gripped it tight.    \"It is--Shan Tung,\" he said, a peculiar hiss in his voice. \"Shan  Tung--and Miriam Kirkstone! Do you understand, Conniston? Does the  horror of it get hold of you? Can you make yourself believe that it is  possible? Am I mad to allow such a suspicion to creep into my brain?  Shan Tung--Miriam Kirkstone! And she sees herself standing now at the  very edge of the pit of hell, and it is killing her.\"    Keith felt his blood running cold as he saw in the inspector's face the  thing which he did not put more plainly in word. He was shocked. He  drew his hand from McDowell's grip almost fiercely.    \"Impossible!\" he cried. \"Yes, you are mad. Such a thing would be  inconceivable!\"    \"And yet I have told myself that it is possible,\" said McDowell. His  face was returning into its iron-like mask. His two hands gripped the  arms of his chair, and he stared at Keith again as if he were looking  through him at something else, and to that something else he seemed to  speak, slowly, weighing and measuring each word before it passed his  lips. \"I am not superstitious. It has always been a law with me to have  conviction forced upon me. I do not believe unusual things until  investigation proves them. I am making an exception in the case of Shan  Tung. I have never regarded him as a man, like you and me, but as a  sort of superphysical human machine possessed of a certain  psychological power that is at times almost deadly. Do you begin to  understand me? I believe that he has exerted the whole force of that  influence upon Miriam Kirkstone--and she has surrendered to it. I  believe--and yet I am not positive.\"    \"And you have watched them for six months?\"    \"No. The suspicion came less than a month ago. No one that I know has  ever had the opportunity of looking into Shan Tung's private life. The  quarters behind his cafe are a mystery. I suppose they can be entered  from the cafe and also from a little stairway at the rear. One  night--very late--I saw Miriam Kirkstone come down that stairway. Twice  in the last month she has visited Shan Tung at a late hour. Twice that  I know of, you understand. And that is not all--quite.\"    Keith saw the distended veins in McDowell's clenched hands, and he knew  that he was speaking under a tremendous strain.    \"I watched the Kirkstone home--personally. Three times in that same  month Shan Tung visited her there. The third time I entered boldly with  a fraud message for the girl. I remained with her for an hour. In that  time I saw nothing and heard nothing of Shan Tung. He was hiding--or  got out as I came in.\"    Keith was visioning Miriam Kirkstone as he had seen her in the  inspector's office. He recalled vividly the slim, golden beauty of her,  the wonderful gray of her eyes, and the shimmer of her hair as she  stood in the light of the window--and then he saw Shan Tung,  effeminate, with his sly, creeping hands and his narrowed eyes, and the  thing which McDowell had suggested rose up before him a monstrous  impossibility.    \"Why don't you demand an explanation of Miss Kirkstone?\" he asked.    \"I have, and she denies it all absolutely, except that Shan Tung came  to her house once to see her brother. She says that she was never on  the little stairway back of Shan Tung's place.\"    \"And you do not believe her?\"    \"Assuredly not. I saw her. To speak the cold truth, Conniston, she is  lying magnificently to cover up something which she does not want any  other person on earth to know.\"    Keith leaned forward suddenly. \"And why is it that John Keith, dead and  buried, should have anything to do with this?\" he demanded. \"Why did  this 'intense interest' you speak of in John Keith begin at about the  same time your suspicions began to include Shan Tung?\"    McDowell shook his head. \"It may be that her interest was not so much  in John Keith as in you, Conniston. That is for you to  discover--tonight. It is an interesting situation. It has tragic  possibilities. The instant you substantiate my suspicions we'll deal  directly with Shan Tung. Just now--there's Wallie behind you grinning  like a Cheshire cat. His dinner must be a success.\"    The diminutive Jap had noiselessly opened the door of the little  dining-room in which the table was set for two.    Keith smiled as he sat down opposite the man who would have sent him to  the executioner had he known the truth. After all, it was but a step  from comedy to tragedy. And just now he was conscious of a bit of  grisly humor in the situation.          VIII      The storm had settled into a steady drizzle when McDowell left the  Shack at two o'clock. Keith watched the iron man, as his tall, gray  figure faded away into the mist down the slope, with a curious  undercurrent of emotion. Before the inspector had come up as his guest  he had, he thought, definitely decided his future action. He would go  west on his furlough, write McDowell that he had decided not to  reenlist, and bury himself in the British Columbia mountains before an  answer could get back to him, leaving the impression that he was going  on to Australia or Japan. He was not so sure of himself now. He found  himself looking ahead to the night, when he would see Miriam Kirkstone,  and he no longer feared Shan Tung as he had feared him a few hours  before. McDowell himself had given him new weapons. He was unofficially  on Shan Tung's trail. McDowell had frankly placed the affair of Miriam  Kirkstone in his hands. That it all had in some mysterious way  something to do with himself--John Keith--urged him on to the adventure.    He waited impatiently for the evening. Wallie, smothered in a great  raincoat, he sent forth on a general foraging expedition and to bring  up some of Conniston's clothes. It was a quarter of eight when he left  for Miriam Kirkstone's home.    Even at that early hour the night lay about him heavy and dark and  saturated with a heavy mist. From the summit of the hill he could no  longer make out the valley of the Saskatchewan. He walked down into a  pit in which the scattered lights of the town burned dully like distant  stars. It was a little after eight when he came to the Kirkstone house.  It was set well back in an iron-fenced area thick with trees and  shrubbery, and he saw that the porch light was burning to show him the  way. Curtains were drawn, but a glow of warm light lay behind them.    He was sure that Miriam Kirkstone must have heard the crunch of his  feet on the gravel walk, for he had scarcely touched the old-fashioned  knocker on the door when the door itself was opened. It was Miriam who  greeted him. Again he held her hand for a moment in his own.    It was not cold, as it had been in McDowell's office. It was almost  feverishly hot, and the pupils of the girl's eyes were big, and dark,  and filled with a luminous fire. Keith might have thought that coming  in out of the dark night he had startled her. But it was not that. She  was repressing something that had preceded him. He thought that he  heard the almost noiseless closing of a door at the end of the long  hall, and his nostrils caught the faint aroma of a strange perfume.  Between him and the light hung a filmy veil of smoke. He knew that it  had come from a cigarette. There was an uneasy note in Miss Kirkstone's  voice as she invited him to hang his coat and hat on an old-fashioned  rack near the door. He took his time, trying to recall where he had  detected that perfume before. He remembered, with a sort of shock. It  was after Shan Tung had left McDowell's office.    She was smiling when he turned, and apologizing again for making her  unusual request that day.    \"It was--quite unconventional. But I felt that you would understand,  Mr. Conniston. I guess I didn't stop to think. And I am afraid of  lightning, too. But I wanted to see you. I didn't want to wait until  tomorrow to hear about what happened up there. Is it--so strange?\"    Afterward he could not remember just what sort of answer he made. She  turned, and he followed her through the big, square-cut door leading  out of the hall. It was the same door with the great, sliding panel he  had locked on that fateful night, years ago, when he had fought with  her father and brother. In it, for a moment, her slim figure was  profiled in a frame of vivid light. Her mother must have been  beautiful. That was the thought that flashed upon him as the room and  its tragic memory lay before him. Everything came back to him vividly,  and he was astonished at the few changes in it. There was the big chair  with its leather arms, in which the overfatted creature who had been  her father was sitting when he came in. It was the same table, too, and  it seemed to him that the same odds and ends were on the mantel over  the cobblestone fireplace. And there was somebody's picture of the  Madonna still hanging between two windows.

Nepeese was  following almost as swiftly as he could run. Suddenly he turned into a  cleft between two great rocks. Twenty feet in, his way was barred, and  he ran back. When he darted out, straight up the canyon, Nepeese was  not a dozen yards behind him, and he saw Pierrot almost at her side.  The Willow gave a cry.    \"Mana--mana--there he is!\"    She caught her breath, and darted into a copse of young balsams where  Baree had disappeared. Like a great entangling web her loose hair  impeded her in the brush, and with an encouraging cry to Pierrot she  stopped to gather it over her shoulder as he ran past her. She lost  only a moment or two, and then once again was after him. Fifty yards  ahead of her Pierrot gave a warning shout. Baree had turned. Almost in  the same breath he was tearing over his back trail, directly toward the  Willow. He did not see her in time to stop or swerve aside, and Nepeese  flung herself down in his path. For an instant or two they were  together. Baree felt the smother of her hair, and the clutch of her  hands. Then he squirmed away and darted again toward the blind end of  the canyon.    Nepeese sprang to her feet. She was panting--and laughing. Pierrot came  back wildly, and the Willow pointed beyond him.    \"I had him--and he didn't bite!\" she said, breathing swiftly. She still  pointed to the end of the canyon, and she said again: \"I had him--and  he didn't bite me, Nootawe!\"    That was the wonder of it. She had been reckless--and Baree had not  bitten her! It was then, with her eyes shining at Pierrot, and the  smile fading slowly from her lips, that she spoke softly the word  \"Baree,\" which in her tongue meant \"the wild dog\"--a little brother of  the wolf.    \"Come,\" cried Pierrot, \"or we will lose him!\"    Pierrot was confident. The canyon had narrowed. Baree could not get  past them unseen. Three minutes later Baree came to the blind end of  the canyon--a wall of rock that rose straight up like the curve of a  dish. Feasting on fish and long hours of sleep had fattened him, and he  was half winded as he sought vainly for an exit. He was at the far end  of the dishlike curve of rock, without a bush or a clump of grass to  hide him, when Pierrot and Nepeese saw him again. Nepeese made straight  toward him. Pierrot, foreseeing what Baree would do, hurried to the  left, at right angles to the end of the canyon.    In and out among the rocks Baree sought swiftly for a way of escape. In  a moment more he had come to the \"box,\" or cup of the canyon. This was  a break in the wall, fifty or sixty feet wide, which opened into a  natural prison about an acre in extent. It was a beautiful spot. On all  sides but that leading into the coulee it was shut in by walls of rock.  At the far end a waterfall broke down in a series of rippling cascades.  The grass was thick underfoot and strewn with flowers. In this trap  Pierrot had got more than one fine haunch of venison. From it there was  no escape, except in the face of his rifle. He called to Nepeese as he  saw Baree entering it, and together they climbed the slope.    Baree had almost reached the edge of the little prison meadow when  suddenly he stopped himself so quickly that he fell back on his  haunches and his heart jumped up into his throat.    Full in his path stood Wakayoo, the huge black bear!    For perhaps a half-minute Baree hesitated between the two perils. He  heard the voices of Nepeese and Pierrot. He caught the rattle of stones  under their feet. And he was filled with a great dread. Then he looked  at Wakayoo. The big bear had not moved an inch. He, too, was listening.  But to him there was a thing more disturbing than the sounds he heard.  It was the scent which he caught in the air--the man scent.    Baree, watching him, saw his head swing slowly even as the footsteps of  Nepeese and Pierrot became more and more distinct. It was the first  time Baree had ever stood face to face with the big bear. He had  watched him fish; he had fattened on Wakayoo's prowess; he had held him  in splendid awe. Now there was something about the bear that took away  his fear and gave him in its place a new and thrilling confidence.  Wakayoo, big and powerful as he was, would not run from the two-legged  creatures who pursued him! If Baree could only get past Wakayoo he was  safe!    Baree darted to one side and ran for the open meadow. Wakayoo did not  stir as Baree sped past him--no more than if he had been a bird or a  rabbit. Then came another breath of air, heavy with the scent of man.  This, at last, put life into him. He turned and began lumbering after  Baree into the meadow trap. Baree, looking back, saw him coming--and  thought it was pursuit. Nepeese and Pierrot came over the slope, and at  the same instant they saw both Wakayoo and Baree.    Where they entered into the grassy dip under the rock walls, Baree  turned sharply to the right. Here was a great boulder, one end of it  tilted up off the earth. It looked like a splendid hiding place, and  Baree crawled under it.    But Wakayoo kept straight ahead into the meadow.    From where he lay Baree could see what happened. Scarcely had he  crawled under the rock when Nepeese and Pierrot appeared through the  break in the dip, and stopped. The fact that they stopped thrilled  Baree. They were afraid of Wakayoo! The big bear was two thirds of the  way across the meadow. The sun fell on him, so that his coat shone like  black satin. Pierrot stared at him for a moment. Pierrot did not kill  for the love of killing. Necessity made him a conservationist. But he  saw that in spite of the lateness of the season, Wakayoo's coat was  splendid--and he raised his rifle.    Baree saw this action. He saw, a moment later, something spit from the  end of the gun, and then he heard that deafening crash that had come  with his own hurt, when the Willow's bullet had burned through his  flesh. He turned his eyes swiftly to Wakayoo. The big bear had  stumbled; he was on his knees. And then he struggled to his feet and  lumbered on.    The roar of the rifle came again, and a second time Wakayoo went down.  Pierrot could not miss at that distance. Wakayoo made a splendid mark.  It was slaughter. Yet for Pierrot and Nepeese it was business--the  business of life.    Baree was shivering. It was more from excitement than fear, for he had  lost his own fear in the tragedy of these moments. A low whine rose in  his throat as he looked at Wakayoo, who had risen again and faced his  enemies--his jaws gaping, his head swinging slowly, his legs weakening  under him as the blood poured through his torn lungs. Baree  whined--because Wakayoo had fished for him, because he had come to look  on him as a friend, and because he knew it was death that Wakayoo was  facing now. There was a third shot--the last. Wakayoo sank down in his  tracks. His big head dropped between his forepaws. A racking cough or  two came to Baree's ears. And then there was silence. It was  slaughter--but business.    A minute later, standing over Wakayoo, Pierrot said to Nepeese:    \"Mon dieu, but it is a fine skin, Sakahet! It is worth twenty dollars  over at Lac Bain!\"    He drew forth his knife and began whetting it on a stone which he  carried in his pocket. In these minutes Baree might have crawled out  from under his rock and escaped down the canyon; for a space he was  forgotten. Then Nepeese thought of him, and in that same strange,  wondering voice she spoke again the word \"Baree.\" Pierrot, who was  kneeling, looked up at her.    \"Oui, Sakahet. He was born of the wild. And now he is gone--\"    The Willow shook her head.    \"Non, he is not gone,\" she said, and her dark eyes searched the sunlit  meadow.        CHAPTER 8    As Nepeese gazed about the rock-walled end of the canyon, the prison  into which they had driven Wakayoo and Baree, Pierrot looked up again  from his skinning of the big black bear, and he muttered something that  no one but himself could have heard. \"Non, it is not possible,\" he had  said a moment before; but to Nepeese it was possible--the thought that  was in her mind. It was a wonderful thought. It thrilled her to the  depth of her wild, young soul. It sent a glow into her eyes and a  deeper flush of excitement into her cheeks and lips.    As she searched the ragged edges of the little meadow for signs of the  dog pup, her thoughts flashed back swiftly. Two years ago they had  buried her princess mother under the tall spruce near their cabin. That  day Pierrot's sun had set for all time, and her own life became filled  with a vast loneliness. There had been three at the graveside that  afternoon as the sun went down--Pierrot, herself, and a dog, a great,  powerful husky with a white star on his breast and a white-tipped ear.  He had been her dead mother's pet from puppyhood--her bodyguard, with  her always, even with his head resting on the side of her bed as she  died. And that night, the night of the day they buried her, the dog had  disappeared. He had gone as quietly and as completely as her spirit. No  one ever saw him after that. It was strange, and to Pierrot it was a  miracle. Deep in his heart he was filled with the wonderful conviction  that the dog had gone with his beloved Wyola into heaven.    But Nepeese had spent three winters at the missioner's school at Nelson  House. She had learned a great deal about white people and the real  God, and she knew that Pierrot's idea was impossible. She believed that  her mother's husky was either dead or had joined the wolves. Probably  he had gone to the wolves. So--was it not possible that this youngster  she and her father had pursued was of the flesh and blood of her  mother's pet? It was more than possible. The white star on his breast,  the white-tipped ear--the fact that he had not bitten her when he might  easily have buried his fangs in the soft flesh of her arms! She was  convinced. While Pierrot skinned the bear, she began hunting for"]]]
