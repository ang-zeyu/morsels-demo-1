I never heard anyone make more  beautiful prayers than old Simon Bentley, who was always drunk, or  hoping to be, and the drunker he was the better he prayed.\"    \"The Methodist minister is very fine looking,\" said Anne, for the  benefit of the office door.    \"Yes, he's quite ornamental,\" agreed Miss Cornelia.  \"Oh, and VERY  ladylike.  And he thinks that every girl who looks at him falls in love  with him--as if a Methodist minister, wandering about like any Jew, was  such a prize!  If you and the young doctor take MY advice, you won't  have much to do with the Methodists.  My motto is--if you ARE a  Presbyterian, BE a Presbyterian.\"    \"Don't you think that Methodists go to heaven as well as  Presbyterians?\" asked Anne smilelessly.    \"That isn't for US to decide.  It's in higher hands than ours,\" said  Miss Cornelia solemnly.  \"But I ain't going to associate with them on  earth whatever I may have to do in heaven.  THIS Methodist minister  isn't married.  The last one they had was, and his wife was the  silliest, flightiest little thing I ever saw.  I told her husband once  that he should have waited till she was grown up before he married her.  He said he wanted to have the training of her.  Wasn't that like a man?\"    \"It's rather hard to decide just when people ARE grown up,\" laughed  Anne.    \"That's a true word, dearie.  Some are grown up when they're born, and  others ain't grown up when they're eighty, believe ME. That same Mrs.  Roderick I was speaking of never grew up.  She was as foolish when she  was a hundred as when she was ten.\"    \"Perhaps that was why she lived so long,\" suggested Anne.    \"Maybe 'twas.  _I_'d rather live fifty sensible years than a hundred  foolish ones.\"    \"But just think what a dull world it would be if everyone was  sensible,\" pleaded Anne.    Miss Cornelia disdained any skirmish of flippant epigram.    \"Mrs. Roderick was a Milgrave, and the Milgraves never had much sense.  Her nephew, Ebenezer Milgrave, used to be insane for years.  He  believed he was dead and used to rage at his wife because she wouldn't  bury him.  _I_'d a-done it.\"    Miss Cornelia looked so grimly determined that Anne could almost see  her with a spade in her hand.    \"Don't you know ANY good husbands, Miss Bryant?\"    \"Oh, yes, lots of them--over yonder,\" said Miss Cornelia, waving her  hand through the open window towards the little graveyard of the church  across the harbor.    \"But living--going about in the flesh?\" persisted Anne.    \"Oh, there's a few, just to show that with God all things are  possible,\" acknowledged Miss Cornelia reluctantly.  \"I don't deny that  an odd man here and there, if he's caught young and trained up proper,  and if his mother has spanked him well beforehand, may turn out a  decent being.  YOUR husband, now, isn't so bad, as men go, from all I  hear.  I s'pose\"--Miss Cornelia looked sharply at Anne over her  glasses--\"you think there's nobody like him in the world.\"    \"There isn't,\" said Anne promptly.    \"Ah, well, I heard another bride say that once,\" sighed Miss Cornelia.  \"Jennie Dean thought when she married that there wasn't anybody like  HER husband in the world.  And she was right--there wasn't!  And a good  thing, too, believe ME!  He led her an awful life--and he was courting  his second wife while Jennie was dying.    \"Wasn't that like a man?  However, I hope YOUR confidence will be  better justified, dearie.  The young doctor is taking real well.  I was  afraid at first he mightn't, for folks hereabouts have always thought  old Doctor Dave the only doctor in the world.  Doctor Dave hadn't much  tact, to be sure--he was always talking of ropes in houses where  someone had hanged himself.  But folks forgot their hurt feelings when  they had a pain in their stomachs.  If he'd been a minister instead of  a doctor they'd never have forgiven him.  Soul-ache doesn't worry folks  near as much as stomach-ache.  Seeing as we're both Presbyterians and  no Methodists around, will you tell me your candid opinion of OUR  minister?\"    \"Why--really--I--well,\" hesitated Anne.    Miss Cornelia nodded.    \"Exactly.  I agree with you, dearie.  We made a mistake when we called  HIM.  His face just looks like one of those long, narrow stones in the  graveyard, doesn't it?  'Sacred to the memory' ought to be written on  his forehead.  I shall never forget the first sermon he preached after  he came.  It was on the subject of everyone doing what they were best  fitted for--a very good subject, of course; but such illustrations as  he used!  He said, 'If you had a cow and an apple tree, and if you tied  the apple tree in your stable and planted the cow in your orchard, with  her legs up, how much milk would you get from the apple tree, or how  many apples from the cow?'  Did you ever hear the like in your born  days, dearie?  I was so thankful there were no Methodists there that  day--they'd never have been done hooting over it.  But what I dislike  most in him is his habit of agreeing with everybody, no matter what is  said.  If you said to him, 'You're a scoundrel,' he'd say, with that  smooth smile of his, 'Yes, that's so.'  A minister should have more  backbone.  The long and the short of it is, I consider him a reverend  jackass.  But, of course, this is just between you and me.  When there  are Methodists in hearing I praise him to the skies.  Some folks think  his wife dresses too gay, but _I_ say when she has to live with a face  like that she needs something to cheer her up.  You'll never hear ME  condemning a woman for her dress.  I'm only too thankful when her  husband isn't too mean and miserly to allow it.  Not that I bother much  with dress myself.  Women just dress to please the men, and I'd never  stoop to THAT.  I have had a real placid, comfortable life, dearie, and  it's just because I never cared a cent what the men thought.\"    \"Why do you hate the men so, Miss Bryant?\"    \"Lord, dearie, I don't hate them.  They aren't worth it.  I just sort  of despise them.  I think I'll like YOUR husband if he keeps on as he  has begun.  But apart from him about the only men in the world I've  much use for are the old doctor and Captain Jim.\"    \"Captain Jim is certainly splendid,\" agreed Anne cordially.    \"Captain Jim is a good man, but he's kind of vexing in one way.  You  CAN'T make him mad.  I've tried for twenty years and he just keeps on  being placid.  It does sort of rile me.  And I s'pose the woman he  should have married got a man who went into tantrums twice a day.\"    \"Who was she?\"    \"Oh, I don't know, dearie.  I never remember of Captain Jim making up  to anybody.  He was edging on old as far as my memory goes.  He's  seventy-six, you know.  I never heard any reason for his staying a  bachelor, but there must be one, believe ME.  He sailed all his life  till five years ago, and there's no corner of the earth he hasn't poked  his nose into.  He and Elizabeth Russell were great cronies, all their  lives, but they never had any notion of sweet-hearting.  Elizabeth  never married, though she had plenty of chances.  She was a great  beauty when she was young.  The year the Prince of Wales came to the  Island she was visiting her uncle in Charlottetown and he was a  Government official, and so she got invited to the great ball.  She was  the prettiest girl there, and the Prince danced with her, and all the  other women he didn't dance with were furious about it, because their  social standing was higher than hers and they said he shouldn't have  passed them over.  Elizabeth was always very proud of that dance.  Mean  folks said that was why she never married--she couldn't put up with an  ordinary man after dancing with a prince.  But that wasn't so.  She  told me the reason once--it was because she had such a temper that she  was afraid she couldn't live peaceably with any man.  She HAD an awful  temper--she used to have to go upstairs and bite pieces out of her  bureau to keep it down by times.  But I told her that wasn't any reason  for not marrying if she wanted to.  There's no reason why we should let  the men have a monopoly of temper, is there, Mrs. Blythe, dearie?\"    \"I've a bit of temper myself,\" sighed Anne.    \"It's well you have, dearie.  You won't be half so likely to be trodden  on, believe ME!  My, how that golden glow of yours is blooming!  Your  garden looks fine.  Poor Elizabeth always took such care of it.\"    \"I love it,\" said Anne.  \"I'm glad it's so full of old-fashioned  flowers.  Speaking of gardening, we want to get a man to dig up that  little lot beyond the fir grove and set it out with strawberry plants  for us.  Gilbert is so busy he will never get time for it this fall.  Do you know anyone we can get?\"    \"Well, Henry Hammond up at the Glen goes out doing jobs like that.  He'll do, maybe.  He's always a heap more interested in his wages than  in his work, just like a man, and he's so slow in the uptake that he  stands still for five minutes before it dawns on him that he's stopped.  His father threw a stump at him when he was small.    \"Nice gentle missile, wasn't it?  So like a man!  Course, the boy never  got over it.  But he's the only one I can recommend at all.  He painted  my house for me last spring.  It looks real nice now, don't you think?\"    Anne was saved by the clock striking five.    \"Lord, is it that late?\" exclaimed Miss Cornelia.  \"How time does slip  by when you're enjoying yourself!  Well, I must betake myself home.\"    \"No, indeed!  You are going to stay and have tea with us,\" said Anne  eagerly.    \"Are you asking me because you think you ought to, or because you  really want to?\" demanded Miss Cornelia.    \"Because I really want to.\"    \"Then I'll stay.  YOU belong to the race that knows Joseph.\"    \"I know we are going to be friends,\" said Anne, with the smile that  only they of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5449"],[0,"Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt — Complete (#10)"],[1,"Sun-god.\"    \"But fuller and purer in those of the Regent the haruspex ventured to  retort.    \"But Rameses wears the crown,\" cried Ameni, \"and will continue to wear  it so long as it pleases the Gods. Reflect--your hairs are grey, and  seditious words are like sparks, which are borne by the wind, but which,  if they fall, may set our home in a blaze. Continue your feasting, my  lords; but I would request you to speak no more this evening of the king  and his new decree. You, Pentaur, fulfil my orders to-morrow morning  with energy and prudence.\"    The high-priest bowed and left the feast.    As soon as the door was shut behind him, the old priest from Chennu  spoke.    \"What we have learned concerning the pioneer of the king, a man who  holds so high an office, surprises me. Does he distinguish himself by a  special acuteness?\"    \"He was a steady learner, but of moderate ability.\"    \"Is the rank of Mohar then as high as that of a prince of the empire?\"    \"By no means.\"    \"How then is it--?\"    \"It is, as it is,\" interrupted Gagabu. \"The son of the vine-dresser has  his mouth full of grapes, and the child of the door-keeper opens the  lock with words.\"    \"Never mind,\" said an old priest who had hitherto kept silence. \"Paaker  earned for himself the post of Mohar, and possesses many praiseworthy  qualities. He is indefatigable and faithful, quails before no danger,  and has always been earnestly devout from his boyhood. When the  other scholars carried their pocket-money to the fruit-sellers and  confectioners at the temple-gates, he would buy geese, and, when his  mother sent him a handsome sum, young gazelles, to offer to the Gods on  the altars. No noble in the land owns a greater treasure of charms and  images of the Gods than he. To the present time he is the most pious of  men, and the offerings for the dead, which he brings in the name of his  late father, may be said to be positively kingly.\"    \"We owe him gratitude for these gifts,\" said the treasurer, \"and the  high honor he pays his father, even after his death, is exceptional and  far-famed.\"    \"He emulates him in every respect,\" sneered Gagabu; \"and though he  does not resemble him in any feature, grows more and more like him.  But unfortunately, it is as the goose resembles the swan, or the owl  resembles the eagle. For his father's noble pride he has overbearing  haughtiness; for kindly severity, rude harshness; for dignity, conceit;  for perseverance, obstinacy. Devout he is, and we profit by his gifts.  The treasurer may rejoice over them, and the dates off a crooked tree  taste as well as those off a straight one. But if I were the Divinity I  should prize them no higher than a hoopoe's crest; for He, who sees into  the heart of the giver-alas! what does he see! Storms and darkness  are of the dominion of Seth, and in there--in there--\" and the old man  struck his broad breast \"all is wrath and tumult, and there is not a  gleam of the calm blue heaven of Ra, that shines soft and pure in the  soul of the pious; no, not a spot as large as this wheaten-cake.\"    \"Hast thou then sounded to the depths of his soul?\" asked the haruspex.    \"As this beaker!\" exclaimed Gagabu, and he touched the rim of an empty  drinking-vessel. \"For fifteen years without ceasing. The man has been of  service to us, is so still, and will continue to be. Our leeches extract  salves from bitter gall and deadly poisons; and folks like these--\"    \"Hatred speaks in thee,\" said the haruspex, interrupting the indignant  old man.    \"Hatred!\" he retorted, and his lips quivered. \"Hatred?\" and he struck  his breast with his clenched hand. \"It is true, it is no stranger to  this old heart. But open thine ears, O haruspex, and all you others too  shall hear. I recognize two sorts of hatred. The one is between man  and man; that I have gagged, smothered, killed, annihilated--with  what efforts, the Gods know. In past years I have certainly tasted its  bitterness, and served it like a wasp, which, though it knows that in  stinging it must die, yet uses its sting. But now I am old in years,  that is in knowledge, and I know that of all the powerful impulses  which stir our hearts, one only comes solely from Seth, one only  belongs wholly to the Evil one and that is hatred between man and man.  Covetousness may lead to industry, sensual appetites may beget noble  fruit, but hatred is a devastator, and in the soul that it occupies all  that is noble grows not upwards and towards the light, but downwards to  the earth and to darkness. Everything may be forgiven by the Gods, save  only hatred between man and man. But there is another sort of hatred  that is pleasing to the Gods, and which you must cherish if you would  not miss their presence in your souls; that is, hatred for all that  hinders the growth of light and goodness and purity--the hatred of Horus  for Seth. The Gods would punish me if I hated Paaker whose father was  dear to me; but the spirits of darkness would possess the old heart  in my breast if it were devoid of horror for the covetous and sordid  devotee, who would fain buy earthly joys of the Gods with gifts of  beasts and wine, as men exchange an ass for a robe, in whose soul  seethe dark promptings. Paaker's gifts can no more be pleasing to the  Celestials than a cask of attar of roses would please thee, haruspex, in  which scorpions, centipedes, and venomous snakes were swimming. I have  long led this man's prayers, and never have I heard him crave for noble  gifts, but a thousand times for the injury of the men he hates.\"    \"In the holiest prayers that come down to us from the past,\" said the  haruspex, \"the Gods are entreated to throw our enemies under our feet;  and, besides, I have often heard Paaker pray fervently for the bliss of  his parents.\"    \"You are a priest and one of the initiated,\" cried Gagabu, \"and you know  not--or will not seem to know--that by the enemies for whose overthrow  we pray, are meant only the demons of darkness and the outlandish  peoples by whom Egypt is endangered! Paaker prayed for his parents? Ay,  and so will he for his children, for they will be his future as his fore  fathers are his past. If he had a wife, his offerings would be for her  too, for she would be the half of his own present.\"    \"In spite of all this,\" said the haruspex Septah, \"you are too hard in  your judgment of Paaker, for although he was born under a lucky sign,  the Hathors denied him all that makes youth happy. The enemy for whose  destruction he prays is Mena, the king's charioteer, and, indeed, he  must have been of superhuman magnanimity or of unmanly feebleness, if he  could have wished well to the man who robbed him of the beautiful wife  who was destined for him.\"    \"How could that happen?\" asked the priest from Chennu. \"A betrothal is  sacred.\"       [In the demotic papyrus preserved at Bulaq (novel by Setnau) first     treated by H. Brugsch, the following words occur: \"Is it not the     law, which unites one to another?\" Betrothed brides are mentioned,     for instance on the sarcophagus of Unnefer at Bulaq.]    \"Paaker,\" replied Septah, \"was attached with all the strength of his  ungoverned but passionate and faithful heart to his cousin Nefert, the  sweetest maid in Thebes, the daughter of Katuti, his mother's  sister; and she was promised to him to wife. Then his father, whom he  accompanied on his marches, was mortally wounded in Syria. The king  stood by his death-bed, and granting his last request, invested his son  with his rank and office: Paaker brought the mummy of his father home  to Thebes, gave him princely interment, and then before the time  of mourning was over, hastened back to Syria, where, while the king  returned to Egypt, it was his duty to reconnoitre the new possessions.  At last he could quit the scene of war with the hope of marrying Nefert.  He rode his horse to death the sooner to reach the goal of his desires;  but when he reached Tanis, the city of Rameses, the news met him that  his affianced cousin had been given to another, the handsomest and  bravest man in Thebes--the noble Mena. The more precious a thing is that  we hope to possess, the more we are justified in complaining of him who  contests our claim, and can win it from us. Paaker's blood must have  been as cold as a frog's if he could have forgiven Mena instead of  hating him, and the cattle he has offered to the Gods to bring down  their wrath on the head of the traitor may be counted by hundreds.\"    \"And if you accept them, knowing why they are offered, you do unwisely  and wrongly,\" exclaimed Gagabu. \"If I were a layman, I would take good  care not to worship a Divinity who condescends to serve the foulest  human fiends for a reward. But the omniscient Spirit, that rules  the world in accordance with eternal laws, knows nothing of these  sacrifices, which only tickle the nostrils of the evil one. The  treasurer rejoices when a beautiful spotless heifer is driven in among  our herds. But Seth rubs his red hands       [Red was the color of Seth and Typhon. The evil one is named the     Red, as for instance in the papyrus of fibers. Red-haired men were     typhonic.]    with delight that he accepts it. My friends, I have heard the vows which  Paaker has poured out over our pure altars, like hogwash that men set  before swine. Pestilence and boils has he called down on Mena, and  barrenness and heartache on the poor sweet woman; and I really cannot  blame her for preferring a battle-horse to a hippopotamus--a Mena to a  Paaker.\"    \"Yet the Immortals must have thought his remonstrances less  unjustifiable, and have stricter views as to the inviolable nature of a  betrothal than you,\" said the treasurer, \"for Nefert, during four years  of married life, has passed only a few weeks with her wandering husband,  and remains childless. It is hard to me to understand how you, Gagabu,  who so often absolve where we condemn, can so relentlessly judge "]]]
