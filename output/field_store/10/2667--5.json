And after these, I had shown what must be the fabric of  the nerves and muscles of the human body to give the animal spirits  contained in it the power to move the members, as when we see heads  shortly after they have been struck off still move and bite the earth,  although no longer animated; what changes must take place in the brain  to produce waking, sleep, and dreams; how light, sounds, odors, tastes,  heat, and all the other qualities of external objects impress it with  different ideas by means of the senses; how hunger, thirst, and the  other internal affections can likewise impress upon it divers ideas;  what must be understood by the common sense (sensus communis) in which  these ideas are received, by the memory which retains them, by the  fantasy which can change them in various ways, and out of them compose  new ideas, and which, by the same means, distributing the animal  spirits through the muscles, can cause the members of such a body to  move in as many different ways, and in a manner as suited, whether to  the objects that are presented to its senses or to its internal  affections, as can take place in our own case apart from the guidance  of the will.  Nor will this appear at all strange to those who are  acquainted with the variety of movements performed by the different  automata, or moving machines fabricated by human industry, and that  with help of but few pieces compared with the great multitude of bones,  muscles, nerves, arteries, veins, and other parts that are found in the  body of each animal.  Such persons will look upon this body as a  machine made by the hands of God, which is incomparably better  arranged, and adequate to movements more admirable than is any machine  of human invention.  And here I specially stayed to show that, were  there such machines exactly resembling organs and outward form an ape  or any other irrational animal, we could have no means of knowing that  they were in any respect of a different nature from these animals; but  if there were machines bearing the image of our bodies, and capable of  imitating our actions as far as it is morally possible, there would  still remain two most certain tests whereby to know that they were not  therefore really men.  Of these the first is that they could never use  words or other signs arranged in such a manner as is competent to us in  order to declare our thoughts to others:  for we may easily conceive a  machine to be so constructed that it emits vocables, and even that it  emits some correspondent to the action upon it of external objects  which cause a change in its organs; for example, if touched in a  particular place it may demand what we wish to say to it; if in another  it may cry out that it is hurt, and such like; but not that it should  arrange them variously so as appositely to reply to what is said in its  presence, as men of the lowest grade of intellect can do.  The second  test is, that although such machines might execute many things with  equal or perhaps greater perfection than any of us, they would, without  doubt, fail in certain others from which it could be discovered that  they did not act from knowledge, but solely from the disposition of  their organs:  for while reason is an universal instrument that is  alike available on every occasion, these organs, on the contrary, need  a particular arrangement for each particular action; whence it must be  morally impossible that there should exist in any machine a diversity  of organs sufficient to enable it to act in all the occurrences of  life, in the way in which our reason enables us to act.  Again, by  means of these two tests we may likewise know the difference between  men and brutes.  For it is highly deserving of remark, that there are  no men so dull and stupid, not even idiots, as to be incapable of  joining together different words, and thereby constructing a  declaration by which to make their thoughts understood; and that on the  other hand, there is no other animal, however perfect or happily  circumstanced, which can do the like.  Nor does this inability arise  from want of organs:  for we observe that magpies and parrots can utter  words like ourselves, and are yet unable to speak as we do, that is, so  as to show that they understand what they say; in place of which men  born deaf and dumb, and thus not less, but rather more than the brutes,  destitute of the organs which others use in speaking, are in the habit  of spontaneously inventing certain signs by which they discover their  thoughts to those who, being usually in their company, have leisure to  learn their language.  And this proves not only that the brutes have  less reason than man, but that they have none at all:  for we see that  very little is required to enable a person to speak; and since a  certain inequality of capacity is observable among animals of the same  species, as well as among men, and since some are more capable of being  instructed than others, it is incredible that the most perfect ape or  parrot of its species, should not in this be equal to the most stupid  infant of its kind or at least to one that was crack-brained, unless  the soul of brutes were of a nature wholly different from ours.  And we  ought not to confound speech with the natural movements which indicate  the passions, and can be imitated by machines as well as manifested by  animals; nor must it be thought with certain of the ancients, that the  brutes speak, although we do not understand their language.  For if  such were the case, since they are endowed with many organs analogous  to ours, they could as easily communicate their thoughts to us as to  their fellows.  It is also very worthy of remark, that, though there  are many animals which manifest more industry than we in certain of  their actions, the same animals are yet observed to show none at all in  many others:  so that the circumstance that they do better than we does  not prove that they are endowed with mind, for it would thence follow  that they possessed greater reason than any of us, and could surpass us  in all things; on the contrary, it rather proves that they are  destitute of reason, and that it is nature which acts in them according  to the disposition of their organs:  thus it is seen, that a clock  composed only of wheels and weights can number the hours and measure  time more exactly than we with all our skin.    I had after this described the reasonable soul, and shown that it could  by no means be educed from the power of matter, as the other things of  which I had spoken, but that it must be expressly created; and that it  is not sufficient that it be lodged in the human body exactly like a  pilot in a ship, unless perhaps to move its members, but that it is  necessary for it to be joined and united more closely to the body, in  order to have sensations and appetites similar to ours, and thus  constitute a real man.  I here entered, in conclusion, upon the subject  of the soul at considerable length, because it is of the greatest  moment:  for after the error of those who deny the existence of God, an  error which I think I have already sufficiently refuted, there is none  that is more powerful in leading feeble minds astray from the straight  path of virtue than the supposition that the soul of the brutes is of  the same nature with our own; and consequently that after this life we  have nothing to hope for or fear, more than flies and ants; in place of  which, when we know how far they differ we much better comprehend the  reasons which establish that the soul is of a nature wholly independent  of the body, and that consequently it is not liable to die with the  latter and, finally, because no other causes are observed capable of  destroying it, we are naturally led thence to judge that it is immortal.        PART VI    Three years have now elapsed since I finished the treatise containing  all these matters; and I was beginning to revise it, with the view to  put it into the hands of a printer, when I learned that persons to whom  I greatly defer, and whose authority over my actions is hardly less  influential than is my own reason over my thoughts, had condemned a  certain doctrine in physics, published a short time previously by  another individual to which I will not say that I adhered, but only  that, previously to their censure I had observed in it nothing which I  could imagine to be prejudicial either to religion or to the state, and  nothing therefore which would have prevented me from giving expression  to it in writing, if reason had persuaded me of its truth; and this led  me to fear lest among my own doctrines likewise some one might be found  in which I had departed from the truth, notwithstanding the great care  I have always taken not to accord belief to new opinions of which I had  not the most certain demonstrations, and not to give expression to  aught that might tend to the hurt of any one.  This has been sufficient  to make me alter my purpose of publishing them; for although the  reasons by which I had been induced to take"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/590"],[0,"Robert Louis Stevenson: A Record, an Estimate, and a Memorial (#10)"],[1,"middle fingers of the left hand, and with your right (which     he supposes engaged) you tap him on the head and back.  When you let     him open his eyes, he sees you withdrawing the two forefingers.  'What     that?' asked Lafaele.  'My devil,' says Fanny.  'I wake um, my devil.     All right now.  He go catch the man that catch my pig.'  About an hour     afterwards Lafaele came for further particulars.  'Oh, all right,' my     wife says.  'By-and-by that man be sleep, devil go sleep same place.     By-and-by that man plenty sick.  I no care.  What for he take my pig?'     Lafaele cares plenty; I don't think he is the man, though he may be;     but he knows him, and most likely will eat some of that pig to-night.     He will not eat with relish.'\"    Yet in spite of this R. L. Stevenson declares that:       \"They are a perfectly honest people: nothing of value has ever been     taken from our house, where doors and windows are always wide open;     and upon one occasion when white ants attacked the silver chest, the     whole of my family treasure lay spread upon the floor of the hall for     two days unguarded.\"    Here is a bit on a work of peace, a reflection on a day's weeding at  Vailima--in its way almost as touching as any:       \"I wonder if any one had ever the same attitude to Nature as I hold,     and have held for so long?  This business fascinates me like a tune or     a passion; yet all the while I thrill with a strong distaste.  The     horror of the thing, objective and subjective, is always present to my     mind; the horror of creeping things, a superstitious horror of the     void and the powers about me, the horror of my own devastation and     continual murders.  The life of the plants comes through my finger-     tips, their struggles go to my heart like supplications.  I feel     myself blood-boltered; then I look back on my cleared grass, and count     myself an ally in a fair quarrel, and make stout my heart.\"    Here, again, is the way in which he celebrates an act of friendly  kindness on the part of Mr Gosse:       \"MY DEAR GOSSE,--Your letter was to me such a bright spot that I     answer it right away to the prejudice of other correspondents or--dants     (don't know how to spell it) who have prior claims. . . . It is the     history of our kindnesses that alone makes this world tolerable.  If     it were not for that, for the effect of kind words, kind looks, kind     letters, multiplying, spreading, making one happy through another and     bringing forth benefits, some thirty, some fifty, some a thousandfold,     I should be tempted to think our life a practical jest in the worst     possible spirit.  So your four pages have confirmed my philosophy as     well as consoled my heart in these ill hours.\"          CHAPTER VIII--WORK OF LATER YEARS      Mr Hammerton, in his _Stevensoniana_ (pp. 323-4), has given the humorous  inscriptions on the volumes of his works which Stevenson presented to Dr  Trudeau, who attended him when he was in Saranac in 1887-88--very  characteristic in every way, and showing fully Stevenson's fine  appreciation of any attention or service.  On the _Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde_  volume he wrote:       \"Trudeau was all the winter at my side:     I never saw the nose of Mr Hyde.\"    And on _Kidnapped_ is this:       \"Here is the one sound page of all my writing,     The one I'm proud of and that I delight in.\"    Stevenson was exquisite in this class of efforts, and were they all  collected they would form indeed, a fine supplement and illustration of  the leading lesson of his essays--the true art of pleasing others, and of  truly pleasing one's self at the same time.  To my thinking the finest of  all in this line is the legal (?) deed by which he conveyed his birthday  to little Miss Annie Ide, the daughter of Mr H. C. Ide, a well-known  American, who was for several years a resident of Upolo, in Samoa, first  as Land Commissioner, and later as Chief Justice under the joint  appointment of England, Germany, and the United States.  While living at  Apia, Mr Ide and his family were very intimate with the family of R. L.  Stevenson.  Little Annie was a special pet and protege of Stevenson and  his wife.  After the return of the Ides to their American home, Stevenson  \"deeded\" to Annie his birthday in the following unique document:       I, ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON, advocate of the Scots Bar, author of _The     Master of Ballantrae_ and _Moral Emblems_, civil engineer, sole owner     and patentee of the palace and plantation known as Vailima, in the     island of Upolo, Samoa, a British subject, being in sound mind, and     pretty well, I thank you, in mind and body;       In consideration that Miss Annie H. Ide, daughter of H. C. Ide, in the     town of Saint Johnsbury, in the County of Caledonia, in the State of     Vermont, United States of America, was born, out of all reason, upon     Christmas Day, and is, therefore, out of all justice, denied the     consolation and profit of a proper birthday;       And considering that I, the said Robert Louis Stevenson, have attained     the age when we never mention it, and that I have now no further use     for a birthday of any description;       And in consideration that I have met H. C. Ide, the father of the said     Annie H. Ide, and found him as white a land commissioner as I require,     I have transferred, and do hereby transfer, to the said Annie H. Ide,     all and whole of my rights and privileges in the 13th day of November,     formerly my birthday, now, hereby and henceforth, the birthday of the     said Annie H. Ide, to have, hold, exercise, and enjoy the same in the     customary manner, by the sporting of fine raiment, eating of rich     meats, and receipt of gifts, compliments, and copies of verse,     according to the manner of our ancestors;       And I direct the said Annie H. Ide to add to the said name of Annie H.     Ide the name of Louisa--at least in private--and I charge her to use     my said birthday with moderation and humanity, _et tamquam bona filia     familias_, the said birthday not being so young as it once was and     having carried me in a very satisfactory manner since I can remember;       And in case the said Annie H. Ide shall neglect or contravene either     of the above conditions, I hereby revoke the donation and transfer my     rights in the said birthday to the President of the United States of     America for the time being.       In witness whereof I have hereto set my hand and seal this 19th day of     June, in the year of grace eighteen hundred and ninety-one.       ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON. [Seal.]       _Witness_, LLOYD OSBOURNE.       _Witness_, HAROLD WATTS.    He died in Samoa in December 1894--not from phthisis or anything directly  connected with it, but from the bursting of a blood-vessel and suffusion  of blood on the brain.  He had up to the moment almost of his sudden and  unexpected death been busy on _Weir of Hermiston_ and _St Ives_, which he  left unfinished--the latter having been brought to a conclusion by Mr  Quiller-Couch.          CHAPTER IX--SOME CHARACTERISTICS      In Stevenson we lost one of the most powerful writers of our day, as well  as the most varied in theme and style.  When I use the word \"powerful,\" I  do not mean merely the producing of the most striking or sensational  results, nor the facility of weaving a fascinating or blood-curdling  plot; I mean the writer who seemed always to have most in reserve--a  secret fund of power and fascination which always pointed beyond the  printed page, and set before the attentive and careful reader a strange  but fascinating _personality_.  Other authors have done that in measure.  There was Hawthorne, behind whose writings there is always the wistful,  cold, far-withdrawn spectator of human nature--eerie, inquisitive, and, I  had almost said, inquisitorial--a little bloodless, eerie, weird, and  cobwebby.  There was Dr Wendell Holmes, with his problems of heredity, of  race-mixture and weird inoculation, as in _Elsie Venner_ and _The  Guardian Angel_, and there were Poe and Charles Whitehead.  Stevenson, in  a few of his writings--in one of the _Merry Men_ chapters and in _Dr  Jekyll and Mr Hyde_, and, to some extent, in _The Master of  Ballantrae_--showed that he could enter on the obscure and, in a sense,  weird and metaphysical elements in human life; though always there was,  too, a touch at least of gloomy suggestion, from which, as it seemed, he  could not there wholly escape.  But always, too, there was a touch that  suggests the universal.    Even in the stories that would be classed as those of incident and  adventure merely, _Treasure Island_, _Kidnapped_, and the rest, there is  a sense as of some unaffected but fine symbolism that somehow touches  something of possibility in yourself as you read.  The simplest narrative  from his hand proclaimed itself a deep study in human nature--its motives  tendencies, and possibilities.  In these stories there is promise at once  of the most realistic imagination, the most fantastic romance, keen  insights into some sides of human nature, and weird fancies, as well as  the most delicate and dainty pictures of character.  And this is  precisely what we have--always with a vein of the finest autobiography--a  kind of select and indirect self-revelation--often with a touch of  quaintness, a subdued humour, and sweet-blooded vagary, if we may be  allowed the word, which make you feel towards the writer as towards a  friend.  He was too much an artist to overdo this, and his strength lies  there, that generally he suggests and turns away at the right point, with  a smile, as you ask for _more_.  Look how he sets, half slyly, these  words into the mouth of David Balfour on his first meeting with Catriona  in one of the steep wynds or closes off the High Street of Edinburgh:       \"There is no greater wonder than the way the face of a young woman     "]]]
