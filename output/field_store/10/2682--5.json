To what end?\" Then he fell to thinking of his Uncle  Benn. The East was calling him. \"Something works within me to hold me  here, a work to do.\"    From the ramparts of the citadel he watched the sun go down, bathing the  pyramids in a purple and golden light, throwing a glamour over all  the western plain, and making heavenly the far hills with a plaintive  colour, which spoke of peace and rest, but not of hope. As he stood  watching, he was conscious of people approaching. Voices mingled, there  was light laughter, little bursts of admiration, then lower tones,  and then he was roused by a voice calling. He turned round. A group of  people were moving towards the exit from the ramparts, and near himself  stood a man waving an adieu.    \"Well, give my love to the girls,\" said the man cheerily. Merry faces  looked back and nodded, and in a moment they were gone. The man turned  round, and looked at David, then he jerked his head in a friendly sort  of way and motioned towards the sunset.    \"Good enough, eh?\"    \"Surely, for me,\" answered David. On the instant he liked the red,  wholesome face, and the keen, round, blue eyes, the rather opulent  figure, the shrewd, whimsical smile, all aglow now with beaming  sentimentality, which had from its softest corner called out: \"Well,  give my love to the girls.\"    \"Quaker, or I never saw Germantown and Philadelphy,\" he continued, with  a friendly manner quite without offence. \"I put my money on Quakers  every time.\"    \"But not from Germantown or Philadelphia,\" answered David, declining a  cigar which his new acquaintance offered.    \"Bet you, I know that all right. But I never saw Quakers anywhere else,  and I meant the tribe and not the tent. English, I bet? Of course, or  you wouldn't be talking the English language--though I've heard they  talk it better in Boston than they do in England, and in Chicago they're  making new English every day and improving on the patent. If Chicago  can't have the newest thing, she won't have anything. 'High hopes that  burn like stars sublime,' has Chicago. She won't let Shakespeare or  Milton be standards much longer. She won't have it--simply won't have  England swaggering over the English language. Oh, she's dizzy, is  Chicago--simply dizzy. I was born there. Parents, one Philadelphy, one  New York, one Pawtucket--the Pawtucket one was the step-mother. Father  liked his wives from the original States; but I was born in Chicago. My  name is Lacey--Thomas Tilman Lacey of Chicago.\"    \"I thank thee,\" said David.    \"And you, sir?\"    \"David Claridge.\"    \"Of--?\"    \"Of Hamley.\"    \"Mr. Claridge of Hamley. Mr. Claridge, I am glad to meet you.\" They  shook hands. \"Been here long, Mr. Claridge?\"    \"A few months only.\"    \"Queer place--gilt-edged dust-bin; get anything you like here, from a  fresh gutter-snipe to old Haroun-al-Raschid. It's the biggest jack-pot  on earth. Barnum's the man for this place--P. T. Barnum. Golly, how  the whole thing glitters and stews! Out of Shoobra his High Jinks Pasha  kennels with his lions and lives with his cellars of gold, as if he  was going to take them with him where he's going--and he's going fast.  Here--down here, the people, the real people, sweat and drudge between  a cake of dourha, an onion, and a balass of water at one end of the day,  and a hemp collar and their feet off the ground at the other.\"    \"You have seen much of Egypt?\" asked David, feeling a strange confidence  in the garrulous man, whose frankness was united to shrewdness and a  quick, observant eye.    \"How much of Egypt I've seen, the Egypt where more men get lost,  strayed, and stolen than die in their beds every day, the Egypt where  a eunuch is more powerful than a minister, where an official will toss  away a life as I'd toss this cigar down there where the last Mameluke  captain made his great jump, where women--Lord A'mighty! where women are  divorced by one evil husband, by the dozen, for nothing they ever did  or left undone, and yet 'd be cut to pieces by their own fathers if they  learned that 'To step aside is human--' Mr. Claridge, of that Egypt I  don't know much more'n would entitle me to say, How d'ye do. But it's  enough for me. You've seen something--eh?\"    \"A little. It is not civilised life here. Yet--yet a few strong  patriotic men--\"    Lacey looked quizzically at David.    \"Say,\" he said, \"I thought that about Mexico once. I said  Manana--this Manana is the curse of Mexico. It's always  to-morrow--to-morrow--to-morrow. Let's teach 'em to do things to-day.  Let's show 'em what business means. Two million dollars went into that  experiment, but Manana won. We had good hands, but it had the joker.  After five years I left, with a bald head at twenty-nine, and a little  book of noble thoughts--Tips for the Tired, or Things you can say To-day  on what you can do to-morrow. I lost my hair worrying, but I learned  to be patient. The Dagos wanted to live in their own way, and they did.  It's one thing to be a missionary and say the little word in season;  it's another to run your soft red head against a hard stone wall. I went  to Mexico a conquistador, I left it a child of time, who had learned to  smile; and I left some millions behind me, too. I said to an old Padre  down there that I knew--we used to meet in the Cafe Manrique and drink  chocolate--I said to him, 'Padre, the Lord's Prayer is a mistake down  here.' 'Si, senor,' he said, and smiled his far-away smile at me. 'Yes,'  said I, 'for you say in the Lord's Prayer, \"Give us this day our daily  bread.\"' 'Si, senor,' he says, 'but we do not expect it till to-morrow!'  The Padre knew from the start, but I learned at great expense, and went  out of business--closed up shop for ever, with a bald head and my Tips  for the Tired. Well, I've had more out of it all, I guess, than if I'd  trebled the millions and wiped Manana off the Mexican coat of arms.\"    \"You think it would be like that here?\" David asked abstractedly.    Lacey whistled. \"There the Government was all right and the people all  wrong. Here the people are all right and the Government all wrong. Say,  it makes my eyes water sometimes to see the fellah slogging away. He's  a Jim-dandy--works all day and half the night, and if the tax-gatherer  isn't at the door, wakes up laughing. I saw one\"--his light blue eyes  took on a sudden hardness--\"laughing on the other side of his mouth one  morning. They were 'kourbashing' his feet; I landed on them as the soles  came away. I hit out.\" His face became grave, he turned the cigar round  in his mouth. \"It made me feel better, but I had a close call. Lucky for  me that in Mexico I got into the habit of carrying a pop-gun. It saved  me then. But it isn't any use going on these special missions. We  Americans think a lot of ourselves. We want every land to do as we do;  and we want to make 'em do it. But a strong man here at the head, with  a sword in his hand, peace in his heart, who'd be just and poor--how can  you make officials honest when you take all you can get yourself--! But,  no, I guess it's no good. This is a rotten cotton show.\"    Lacey had talked so much, not because he was garrulous only, but because  the inquiry in David's eyes was an encouragement to talk. Whatever his  misfortunes in Mexico had been, his forty years sat lightly on him, and  his expansive temperament, his childlike sentimentality, gave him  an appearance of beaming, sophisticated youth. David was slowly  apprehending these things as he talked--subconsciously, as it were; for  he was seeing pictures of the things he himself had observed, through  the lens of another mind, as primitive in some regards as his own, but  influenced by different experiences.    \"Say, you're the best listener I ever saw,\" added Lacey, with a laugh.    David held out his hand. \"Thee sees things clearly,\" he answered.    Lacey grasped his hand.    At that moment an orderly advanced towards them. \"He's after us--one of  the Palace cavalry,\" said Lacey.    \"Effendi--Claridge Effendi! May his grave be not made till the  karadh-gatherers return,\" said the orderly to David.    \"My name is Claridge,\" answered David.    \"To the hotel, effendi, first, then to the Mokattam Hills after thee,  then here--from the Effendina, on whom be God's peace, this letter for  thee.\"    David took the letter. \"I thank thee, friend,\" he said.    As he read it, Lacey said to the orderly in Arabic \"How didst thou know  he was here?\"    The orderly grinned wickedly.    \"Always it is known what place the effendi honours. It is not dark where  he uncovers his face.\"    Lacey gave a low whistle.    \"Say, you've got a pull in this show,\" he said, as David folded up the  letter and put it in his pocket.    \"In Egypt, if the master smiles on you, the servant puts his nose in the  dust.\"    \"The Prince Pasha bids me to dinner at the Palace to-night. I have no  clothes for such affairs. Yet--\" His mind was asking itself if this was  a door opening, which he had no right to shut with his own hand. There  was no reason why he should not go; therefore there might be a  reason why he should go. It might be, it no doubt was, in the way of  facilitating his business. He dismissed the orderly with an affirmative  and ceremonial message to Prince Kaid--and a piece of gold.    \"You've learned the custom of the place,\" said Lacey, as he saw the gold  piece glitter in the brown palm of the orderly.    \"I suppose the man's only pay is in such service,\" rejoined David. \"It  is a land of backsheesh. The fault is not with the people; it is with  the rulers. I am not sorry to share my goods with the poor.\"    \"You'll have a big going concern here in no time,\" observed Lacey. \"Now,  if I had those millions I left in Mexico--\" Suddenly he stopped. \"Is it  you that's trying to settle up an estate here--at Assiout--belon"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6312"],[0,"Representative Men: Seven Lectures (#10)"],[1,"assuming this ambition for Plato. Let us not seem to treat  with flippancy his venerable name. Men, in proportion to their  intellect, have admitted his transcendent claims. The way to know him,  is to compare him, not with nature, but with other men. How many ages  have gone by, and he remains unapproached! A chief structure of human  wit, like Karnac, or the mediaeval cathedrals, or the Etrurian remains,  it requires all the breadth of human faculty to know it. I think it  is truliest seen, when seen with the most respect. His sense deepens,  his merits multiply, with study. When we say, here is a fine collection  of fables; or, when we praise the style; or the common sense; or  arithmetic; we speak as boys, and much of our impatient criticism of  the dialectic, I suspect, is no better. The criticism is like our  impatience of miles when we are in a hurry; but it is still best that  a mile should have seventeen hundred and sixty yards. The great-eyed  Plato proportioned the lights and shades after the genius of our life.        PLATO: NEW READINGS      The publication, in Mr. Bohn's \"Serial Library,\" of the excellent  translations of Plato, which we esteem one of the chief benefits the  cheap press has yielded, gives us an occasion to take hastily a few  more notes of the elevation and bearings of this fixed star; or, to  add a bulletin, like the journals, of Plato at the latest dates.    Modern science, by the extent of its generalization, has learned to  indemnify the student of man for the defects of individuals, by tracing  growth and ascent in races; and, by the simple expedient of lighting  up the vast background, generates a feeling of complacency and hope.  The human being has the saurian and the plant in his rear. His arts  and sciences, the easy issue of his brain, look glorious when  prospectively beheld from the distant brain of ox, crocodile, and fish.  It seems as if nature, in regarding the geologic night behind her,  when, in five or six millenniums, she had turned out five or six men,  as Homer, Phidias, Menu, and Columbus, was nowise discontented with  the result. These samples attested the virtue of the tree. These were  a clear amelioration of trilobite and saurus, and a good basis for  further proceeding. With this artist time and space are cheap, and she  is insensible of what you say of tedious preparation. She waited  tranquilly the flowing periods of paleontology, for the hour to be  struck when man should arrive. Then periods must pass before the motion  of the earth can be suspected; then before the map of the instincts  and the cultivable powers can be drawn. But as of races, so the  succession of individual men is fatal and beautiful, and Plato has the  fortune, in the history of mankind, to mark an epoch.    Plato's fame does not stand on a syllogism, or on any masterpieces of  the Socratic, or on any thesis, as, for example, the immortality of  the soul. He is more than an expert, or a school-man, or a geometer,  or the prophet of a peculiar message. He represents the privilege of  the intellect, the power, namely, of carrying up every fact to  successive platforms, and so disclosing, in every fact, a germ of  expansion. These expansions are in the essence of thought. The  naturalist would never help us to them by any discoveries of the extent  of the universe, but is as poor, when cataloguing the resolved nebula  of Orion, as when measuring the angles of an acre. But the Republic  of Plato, by these expansions, may be said to require, and so to  anticipate, the astronomy of Laplace. The expansions are organic. The  mind does not create what it perceives, any more than the eye creates  the rose. In ascribing to Plato the merit of announcing them, we only  say, here was a more complete man, who could apply to nature the whole  scale of the senses, the understanding, and the reason. These  expansions, or extensions, consist in continuing the spiritual sight  where the horizon falls on our natural vision, and, by this second  sight, discovering the long lines of law which shoot in every direction.  Everywhere he stands on a path which has no end, but runs continuously  round the universe. Therefore, every word becomes an exponent of nature.  Whatever he looks upon discloses a second sense, and ulterior senses.  His perception of the generation of contraries, of death out of life,  and life out of death,--that law by which, in nature, decomposition  is recomposition, and putrefaction and cholera are only signals of a  new creation; his discernment of the little in the large, and the large  in the small; studying the state in the citizen, and the citizen in  the state; and leaving it doubtful whether he exhibited the Republic  as an allegory on the education of the private soul; his beautiful  definitions of ideas, of time, of form, of figure, of the line,  sometimes hypothetically given, as his defining of virtue, courage,  justice, temperance; his love of the apologue, and his apologues  themselves; the cave of Trophonius; the ring of Gyges; the charioteer  and two horses; the golden, silver, brass, and iron temperaments;  Theuth and Thamus; and the visions of Hades and the Fates--fables which  have imprinted themselves in the human memory like the signs of the  zodiac; his soliform eye and his boniform soul; his doctrine of  assimilation; his doctrine of reminiscence; his clear vision of the  laws of return, or reaction, which secure instant justice throughout  the universe, instanced everywhere, but specially in the doctrine,  \"what comes from God to us, returns from us to God,\" and in Socrates'  belief that the laws below are sisters of the laws above.    More striking examples are his moral conclusions. Plato affirms the  coincidence of science and virtue; for vice can never know itself and  virtue; but virtue knows both itself and vice. The eye attested that  justice was best, as long as it was profitable; Plato affirms that it  is profitable throughout; that the profit is intrinsic, though the  just conceal his justice from gods and men; that it is better to suffer  injustice, than to do it; that the sinner ought to covet punishment;  that the lie was more hurtful than homicide; and that ignorance, or  the involuntary lie, was more calamitous than involuntary homicide;  that the soul is unwillingly deprived of true opinions; and that no  man sins willingly; that the order of proceeding of nature was from  the mind to the body; and, though a sound body cannot restore an unsound  mind, yet a good soul can, by its virtue, render the body the best  possible. The intelligent have a right over the ignorant, namely, the  right of instructing them. The right punishment of one out of tune,  is to make him play in tune; the fine which the good, refusing to  govern, ought to pay, is, to be governed by a worse man; that his  guards shall not handle gold and silver, but shall be instructed that  there is gold and silver in their souls, which will make men willing  to give them everything which they need. This second sight explains  the stress laid on geometry. He saw that the globe of earth was not  more lawful and precise than was the supersensible; that a celestial  geometry was in place there, as a logic of lines and angles here below;  that the world was throughout mathematical; the proportions are constant  of oxygen, azote, and lime; there is just so much water, and slate,  and magnesia; not less are the proportions constant of moral elements.    This eldest Goethe, hating varnish and falsehood, delighted in revealing  the real at the base of the accidental; in discovering connection,  continuity, and representation, everywhere; hating insulation; and  appears like the god of wealth among the cabins of vagabonds, opening  power and capability in everything he touches. Ethical science was new  and vacant, when Plato could write thus:--\"Of all whose arguments are  left to the men of the present time, no one has ever yet condemned  injustice, or praised justice, otherwise than as respects the repute,  honors, and emoluments arising therefrom; while, as respects either  of them in itself, and subsisting by its own power in the soul of the  possessor, and concealed both from gods and men, no one has yet  sufficiently investigated, either in poetry or prose writings,--how,  namely, that the one is the greatest of all the evils that the soul  has within it, and justice the greatest good.\"    His definition of ideas, as what is simple, permanent, uniform, and  self-existent, forever discriminating them from the notions of the  understanding, marks an era in the world. He was born to behold the  self-evolving power of spirit, endless generator of new ends; a power  which is the key at once to the centrality and the evanescence of  things. Plato is so centered, that he can well spare all his dogmas.  Thus the fact of knowledge and ideas reveals to him the fact of  eternity; and the doctrine of reminiscence he offers as the most  probable particular explication. Call that fanciful,--it matters not;  the connection between our knowledge and the abyss of being is still  real, and the explication must be not less magnificent.    He has indicated every eminent point in speculation. He wrote on the  scale of the mind itself, so that all things have symmetry in his  tablet. He put in all the past, without weariness, and descended into  detail with a courage like that he witnessed in nature. One would say,  that his forerunners had mapped out each a farm, or a district, or an  island, in intellectual geography, but that Plato first drew the sphere.  He domesticates the soul in nature; man is the microcosm. All the  circles of the visible heaven represent as many circles in the rational  soul. There is no lawless particle, and there is nothing casual in the  action of the human mind. The names of things, too, are fatal, following  the nature of things. All the gods of the Pantheon are, by their"]]]
