The bones of the forearm are fused  together; there is therefore no possibility of rotation of the radius  around the ulna. The metacarpus is reduced to a single piece, which in  the horse constitutes what is known as the _canon_. The number of digits  becomes diminished, so that in ruminants there are not more than two,  and in the horse but one. We should, however, add that, up to the  present, we have taken into account only perfect digits, those that rest  on the ground. We shall see further on that there exist supplementary  digits, but that they are only slightly developed, and are represented  in some cases by mere osseous spurs; it is this fact that has permitted  us to ignore them in the general study which we have just made.    Because, as we have already said, the unguligrades have the inferior  extremity of the digit encased in a horny sheath, which forms the hoof  of the horse and the corresponding structures (_onglons_) in the ox,  those animals have been placed in a special group, which is based on  that peculiarity--that is, the group of ungulate mammals.    The plantigrades and digitigrades, of which the paws have their surfaces  of support strengthened by an epidermic sole and fatty pads, have the  free extremities of the third phalanges covered on their dorsal surface  by nails or claws; hence they are named _unguiculate_ mammals.    The bat and birds have the bones of the forearm so arranged that the  radius cannot rotate around the ulna. This is necessary in order that  during flight, when the wing is being lowered, the radius and hand shall  not be able to turn; for, if such rotation took place, each stroke of  the wing would place it in a vertical position, which would occasion a  loss of resistance incompatible with the effect to be obtained.      The Forearm    The skeleton of the forearm in quadrupeds is vertical in direction;  consequently, it forms with the arm an angle open anteriorly; this is  well seen on examining the lateral surface. If we examine it on its  anterior surface, we find a slight obliquity directed downwards and  inwards. In animals in which the bones of the forearm are separate--that  is to say, susceptible of supination and pronation--we find a more close  resemblance to those of the human skeleton. The ulna, the superior  extremity of which always projects beyond that of the radius, has a  shaft which gradually narrows from above downwards. Its inferior  extremity is terminated by a round head in those animals in which the  ulna is fully developed; in others, as it is atrophied, it ends in a  thin, long process.    The ulna presents at its superior extremity a posterior process, the  olecranon, which forms the point of the elbow. We find on the anterior  surface of the same, another process, the coronoid.    It is necessary to dwell on the relations of these parts. In man the  head of the radius is situated at the anterior part of the external  surface of the superior extremity of the ulna (Fig. 25); indeed, the  small sigmoid cavity with which the head articulates is situated on the  outer side of the coronoid process, and this apophysis is placed in  front. In the plantigrades and digitigrades the head of the radius is  placed still more forward, so much so that it is situated almost in  front of the superior extremity of the ulna (Fig. 26). In the  unguligrades it is placed directly in front of this latter (Fig. 27).    Further, the displacement of the radius is made at the expense of the  superior extremity of the neighbouring bone; the radius appears to  appropriate more and more the parts which in man belong exclusively to  the ulna--for example, the coronoid process. In the plantigrades and the  digitigrades half of the process still belongs to the ulna and the  remainder to the radius. In the ungulates--the horse, for example--the  coronoid process belongs to the radius; the ulna, situated behind the  latter, is correspondingly diminished in size.    [Illustration: FIG. 25.--SUPERIOR EXTREMITY OF THE BONES OF THE HUMAN  FOREARM: LEFT SIDE, SUPERIOR SURFACE.    1, Radius; 2, ulna; 3, olecranon process; 4, coronoid process.]    [Illustration: FIG. 26.--SUPERIOR EXTREMITY OF THE BONES OF THE FOREARM  OF THE DOG: LEFT LIMB, SUPERIOR SURFACE.    1, Radius; 2, ulna; 3, olecranon process; 4, coronoid process.]    In brief, when we study this region of the skeleton in plantigrades,  then in digitigrades, and finally in unguligrades, we find a kind of  progressive absorption of one of the two bones (ulna) by the other  (radius), which thus becomes the more developed.    It is easy to explain this partial disappearance of the ulna. When the  forearm is capable of performing the movements of pronation and  supination, the ulna is completely developed, for it is in its small  sigmoid cavity that the head of the radius revolves, and it is around  its inferior extremity, the head, that the corresponding extremity of  the radius turns. But when the movements of rotation of the forearm do  not exist, the inferior extremity of the ulna becomes functionally  useless and disappears. As to its role in the movements of the region of  the wrist, that is nil, for we may remember--we will observe it again  when we come to treat of the articulations--that the hand articulates  with the radius alone (radio-carpal articulation); this is the reason  that, when the forearm possesses the fullest mobility, the hand follows  the movements which that bone makes around the ulna.    [Illustration: FIG. 27.--SUPERIOR EXTREMITY OF THE BONES OF THE FOREARM  OF THE HORSE: LEFT LIMB, SUPERIOR SURFACE.    1, Radius; 2, ulna; 3, olecranon process; 4, coronoid process.]    It is not so with the articulation at the elbow-joint; there it is the  ulna, which, with the humerus, forms the essential parts (humero-ulnar  articulation); its olecranon process limits the movement of extension  of the forearm. It is for this reason that, even in those quadrupeds in  which the ulna is atrophied, the olecranon process presents a relatively  considerable degree of development.

In animals, because of the movement of rotation of the radius, the  surface of this bone, which is anterior, corresponds to the posterior  surface of the same in man. (To possess a clear conception of this, it  is necessary to remember that, in this latter, the bones of the forearm  are always described as in the position of supination; they are thus  represented in Fig. 28. The direction of the surfaces of the radius is  the reverse of that in animals, since the latter have the radius always  in a state of pronation.)    Consequently it is on the anterior surface of the bone that we find the  grooves concerning which it is necessary to give some details. Regarding  them in passing from the radius towards the ulna, those grooves give  passage to the tendons of the muscles whose names occupy the columns on  p. 43. The letters which are referred to each serve to define their  order, and to facilitate reference to Figs. 28, 29, and 30.    [Illustration: FIG. 30.--INFERIOR EXTREMITY OF THE BONE OF THE FOREARM  OF THE HORSE: LEFT SIDE, ANTERIOR SURFACE.    1, Radius; A, groove for the long abductor and the short extensor of the  thumb; B, groove for the radials; D, groove for the common extensor of  the digits; E, groove for the special extensor of the little finger.]    We should mention that the groove E is situated, both in man and in the  dog, at the level of the inferior radio-ulnar articulation; but that in  the horse, as the ulna does not exist at that level, the groove is  situated on the external surface of the inferior extremity of the  radius. It is necessary to add that, in some horses, the ulna is,  nevertheless, represented in this region by a tongue-like process of  bone; and in such cases the groove is situated in front of this process,  at the level of the line of coalescence, which there represents the  articulation.      -----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------             MAN.          |          DOG.         |         HORSE.    -----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------    A.

They ran and told their mother that Narahdarn had  returned alone, that he looked fierce and angry, also his arms were  covered with blood. Out went the mother of the Bilbers, and she said,  \"Where are my daughters, Narahdarn? Forth went they this morning to  bring home the honey you found. You come back alone. You bring no  honey. Your look is fierce, as of one who fights, and your arms are  covered with blood. Tell me, I say, where are my daughters?\"    \"Ask me not, Bilber. Ask Wurranunnah the bee, he may know. Narahdarn  the bat knows nothing.\" And he wrapped himself in a silence which no  questioning could pierce. Leaving him there, before his camp, the  mother of the Bilbers returned to her dardurr and told her tribe that  her daughters were gone, and Narahdarn, their husband, would tell her  nothing of them. But she felt sure he knew their fate, and certain she  was that he had some tale to tell, for his arms were covered with  blood.    The chief of her tribe listened to her. When she had finished and begun  to wail for her daughters, whom she thought she would see no more, he  said, \"Mother of the Bilbers, your daughters shall be avenged if aught  has happened to them at the hands of Narahdarn. Fresh are his tracks,  and the young men of your tribe shall follow whence they have come, and  finding what Narahdarn has done, swiftly shall they return. Then shall  we hold a corrobboree, and if your daughters fell at his hand Narahdarn  shall be punished.\"    The mother of the Bilbers said: \"Well have you spoken, oh my relation.  Now speed ye the young men lest the rain fall or the dust blow and the  tracks be lost.\" Then forth went the fleetest footed and the keenest  eyed of the young men of the tribe. Ere long, back they came to the  camp with the news of the fate of the Bilbers.    That night was the corrobboree held. The women sat round in a  half-circle, and chanted a monotonous chant, keeping time by hitting,  some of them, two boomerangs together, and others beating their rolled  up opossum rugs.    Big fires were lit on the edge of the scrub, throwing light on the  dancers as they came dancing out from their camps, painted in all  manner of designs, waywahs round their waists, tufts of feathers in  their hair, and carrying in their hands painted wands. Heading the  procession as the men filed out from the scrub into a cleared space in  front of the women, came Narahdarn. The light of the fires lit up the  tree tops, the dark balahs showed out in fantastic shapes, and weird  indeed was the scene as slowly the men danced round; louder clicked the  boomerangs and louder grew the chanting of the women; higher were the  fires piled, until the flames shot their coloured tongues round the  trunks of the trees and high into the air. One fire was bigger than  all, and towards it the dancers edged Narahdarn; then the voice of the  mother of the Bilbers shrieked in the chanting, high above that of the  other women. As Narahdarn turned from the fire to dance back he found a  wall of men confronting him. These quickly seized him and hurled him  into the madly-leaping fire before him, where he perished in the  flames. And so were the Bilbers avenged.          16.  MULLYANGAH THE MORNING STAR      Mullyan, the eagle hawk, built himself a home high in a yaraan tree.  There he lived apart from his tribe, with Moodai the opossum, his wife,  and Moodai the opossum, his mother-in-law. With them too was Buttergah,  a daughter of the Buggoo or flying squirrel tribe. Buttergah was a  friend of Moodai, the wife of Mullyan, and a distant cousin to the  Moodai tribe.    Mullyan the eagle hawk was a cannibal. That was the reason of his  living apart from the other blacks. In order to satisfy his cannibal  cravings, he used to sally forth with a big spear, a spear about four  times as big as an ordinary spear. If he found a black fellow hunting  alone, he would kill him and take his body up to the house in the tree.  There the Moodai and Buttergab would cook it, and all of them would eat  the flesh; for the women as well as Mullyan were cannibals. This went  on for some time, until at last so many black fellows were slain that  their friends determined to find out what became of them, and they  tracked the last one they missed. They tracked him to where he had  evidently been slain; they took up the tracks of his slayer, and  followed them right to the foot of the yaraan tree, in which was built  the home of Mullyan. They tried to climb the tree, but it was high and  straight, and they gave up the attempt after many efforts. In their  despair at their failure they thought of the Bibbees, a tribe noted for  its climbing powers. They summoned two young Bibbees to their aid. One  came, bringing with him his friend Murrawondah of the climbing rat  tribe.    Having heard what the blacks wanted them to do, these famous climbers  went to the yaraan tree and made a start at once. There was only light  enough that first night for them to see to reach a fork in the tree  about half-way up. There they camped, watched Mullyan away in the  morning, and then climbed on. At last they reached the home of Mullyan.  They watched their chance and then sneaked into his humpy.    When they were safely inside, they hastened to secrete a smouldering  stick in one end of the humpy, taking care they were not seen by any of  the women. Then they went quietly down again, no one the wiser of their  coming or going. During the day the women heard sometimes a crackling  noise, as of burning, but looking round they saw nothing, and as their  own fire was safe, they took no notice, thinking it might have been  caused by some grass having fallen into their fire.    After their descent from having hidden the smouldering fire stick,  Bibbee and Murrawondah found the blacks and told them what they had  done. Hearing that the plan was to burn out Mullyan, and fearing that  the tree might fall, they all moved to some little distance, there to  watch and wait for the end. Great was their joy at the thought that at  last their enemy was circumvented. And proud were Bibbee and  Murrawondah as the black fellows praised their prowess.    After dinner-time Mullyan came back. When he reached the entrance to  his house he put down his big spear outside. Then he went in and threw  himself down to rest, for long had he walked and little had he gained.  In a few minutes he heard his big spear fall down. He jumped up and  stuck it in its place again. He had no sooner thrown himself down, than  again he heard it fall. Once more he rose and replaced it. As he  reached his resting-place again, out burst a flame of fire from the end  of his humpy. He called out to the three women, who were cooking, and  they rushed to help him extinguish the flames. But in spite of their  efforts the fire only blazed the brighter. Mullyan's arm was burnt off.  The Moodai had their feet burnt, and Buttergah was badly burnt too.  Seeing they were helpless against the fire, they turned to leave the  humpy to its fate, and make good their own escape. But they had left it  too late. As they turned to descend the tree, the roof of the humpy  fell on them. And all that remained when the fire ceased, were the  charred bones of the dwellers in the yaraan tree. That was all that the  blacks found of their enemies; but their legend says that Mullyan the  eagle hawk lives in the sky as Mullyangah the morning star, on one side  of which is a little star, which is his one arm; on the other a larger  star, which is Moodai the opossum, his wife.          17.  GOOMBLEGUBBON, BEEARGAH, AND OUYAN      Goomblegubbon the bustard, his two wives, Beeargah the hawk, and Ouyan  the curlew, with the two children of Beeargah, had their camps right  away in the bush; their only water supply was a small dungle, or gilguy  hole. The wives and children camped in one camp, and Goomblegubbon a  short distance off in another. One day the wives asked their husband to  lend them the dayoorl stone, that they might grind some doonburr to  make durrie. But he would not lend it to them, though they asked him  several times. They knew he did not want to use it himself, for they  saw his durrie on a piece of bark, between two fires, already cooking.  They determined to be revenged, so said:    \"We will make some water bags of the opossum skins; we will fill them  with water, then some day when Goomblegubbon is out hunting we will  empty the dungle of water, take the children, and run away! When he  returns he will find his wives and children gone and the dungle empty;  then he will be sorry that he would not lend us the dayoorl.\"    The wives soon caught some opossums, killed and skinned them, plucked  all the hair from the skins, saving it to roll into string to make  goomillahs, cleaned the skins of all flesh, sewed them up with the  sinews, leaving only the neck opening. When finished, they blew into  them, filled them with air, tied them up and left them to dry for a few  days. When they were dry and ready to be used, they chose a day when  Goomblegubbon was away, filled the water bags, emptied the dungle, and  started towards the river.    Having travelled for some time, they at length reached the river. They  saw two black fellows on the other side, who, when they saw the runaway  wives and the two children, swam over to them and asked whence they had  come and whither they were going.    \"We are running away from our husband Goomblegubbon, who would lend us  no dayoorl to grind our doonburr on, and we ran away lest we and our  children should starve, for we could not live on meat alone. But  whither we are going we know not, except that it must be far away, lest  Goomblegubbon follow and kill us.\"    The black fellows said they wanted wives, and would each take one, and  both care for the children. The women agreed. The black fellows swam  back across the river, each taking a"]]]
