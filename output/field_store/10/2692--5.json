At the back of each hut was a hole in the  ground used as a latrine, which flies frequented. Moss was used  for toilet-paper. Parasitical worms in the stool were ubiquitous.    Most of the simple people lived in villages of about 20 homes  circling a village green or lining a single winding lane. There  were only first names, and these were usually passed down family  lines. To grind their grain, the villagers used hand mills with  crank and gear, or a communal mill, usually built of oak, driven  by power transmitted through a solid oak shaft, banded with iron  as reinforcement, to internal gear wheels of elm. Almost every  village had a watermill. It might be run by water shooting over or  flowing under the wheel.    Clothing for men and women was made from coarse wool, silk, and  linen and was usually brown in color. Only the wealthy could  afford to wear linen or silk. Men also wore leather clothing, such  as neckpieces, breeches, ankle leathers, shoes, and boots. Boots  were worn when fighting. They carried knives or axes under metal  belts. They could carry items by tying leather pouches onto their  belts with their drawstrings. They wore leather gloves for warmth  and for heavy working with their hands.    People were as tall, strong and healthy as in the late 1900s, not  having yet endured the later malnourishment and overcrowding that  was its worst in the 1700s and 1800s. Their teeth were very  healthy. Most adults died in their 40s, after becoming arthritic  from hard labor. People in their 50s were deemed venerable. Boys  of twelve were considered old enough to swear an oath of  allegiance to the king. Girls married in their early teens, often  to men significantly older.    The lands of the large landholding lords were administered by  freemen. They had wheat, barley, oats, and rye fields, orchards,  vineyards for wine, and bee-keeping areas for honey. On this land  lived not only farm laborers, cattle herders, shepherds,  goatherds, and pigherds, but craftsmen such as goldsmiths,  hawkkeepers, dogkeepers, horsekeepers, huntsmen, foresters,  builders, weaponsmiths, embroiders, bronze smiths, blacksmiths,  watermill wrights, wheelwrights, wagon wrights, iron nail makers,  potters, soap makers, tailors, shoemakers, salters (made salt at  the \"wyches\", which later became towns ending with '-wich'),  bakers, cooks, and gardeners. Most men did carpentry work. Master  carpenters worked with ax, hammer, and saw to make houses, doors,  bridges, milk buckets, washtubs, and trunks. Blacksmiths made  gates, huge door hinges, locks, latches, bolts, and horseshoes.  The lord loaned these people land on which to live for their life,  called a \"life estate\", in return for their services. The loan  could continue to their widows or children who took up the craft.  Mills were usually powered by water. Candles were made from  beeswax, which exuded a bright and steady light and pleasant  smell, or from mutton fat, which had an unpleasant odor. The  wheeled plough and iron-bladed plough made the furrows. One man  hald the plough and another walked with the oxen, coaxing them  forward with a stick and shouts. Seeds were held in an apron for  seeding. Farm implements included spades, shovels, rakes, hoes,  buckets, barrels, flails, and sieves. Plants were pruned to direct  their growth and to increase their yield. Everyone got together  for feasts at key stages of the farming, such as the harvest.  Easter was the biggest feast. When the lord was in the field, his  lady held their estate. There were common lands of these estates  as well as of communities. Any proposed new settler had to be  admitted at the court of this estate.    The land of some lords included fishing villages along the coasts.  From the sea were caught herrings, salmon, porpoises, sturgeon,  oysters, crabs, mussels, cockels, winkeles, plaice, flounder, and  lobsters. Sometimes whales were driven into an inlet by many  boats. River fish included eels, pike, minnows, burbo, trout, and  lampreys. They were caught by brushwood weirs, net, bait, hooks,  and baskets. Oysters were so numerous that they were eaten by the  poor. The king's peace extended over the waterways. If mills,  fisheries, weirs, or other structures were set up to block them,  they were to be destroyed and a penalty paid to the king.    Other lords had land with iron-mining industries. Ore was dug from  the ground and combined with wood charcoal in a shaft furnace to  be smelted into liquid form. Wood charcoal was derived from  controlled charring of the wood at high temperatures without using  oxygen. This burned impurities from it and left a purer carbon,  which burned better than wood. The pure iron was extracted from  this liquid and formed into bars. To keep the fire hot, the  furnaces were frequently placed at windswept crossings of valleys  or on the tops of hills.    Some lords had markets on their land, for which they charged a  toll [like a sales tax] for participation. There were about  fifty markets in the nation. Cattle and slaves (from the word  \"slav\") were the usual medium of exchange. An ox still was worth  about 30d. Shaking hands was symbolic of an agreement for a  sale, which had to be carried out in front of witnesses at the  market for any property worth over 20d. The higher the value of  the property, the more witnesses were required. Witnesses were  also required for the exchange of property and to vouch for  cattle having being born on the property of a person claiming  them. People traveled to markets on deep, sunken roads and  narrow bridges kept in repair by certain men who did this work  as their service to the King. The king's peace extended to a  couple of high roads, i.e. highways, running the length of the  country and a couple running its width.    Salt was used throughout the nation to preserve meat over the  winter. Inland saltworks had an elaborate and specialized  organization. The chief one used saltpans and furnaces to extract  salt from natural brine springs. They formed little manufacturing  enclaves in the midst of agricultural land, and they were  considered to be neither large private estates headed by a lord  nor appurtenant to such. They belonged jointly to the king and the  local earl, who shared, at a proportion of two to one, the  proceeds of the tolls upon the sale of salt and methods of  carriage on the ancient salt ways according to cartload, horse  load, or man load. Sometimes there were investors in a portion of  the works who lived quite at distance away. The sales of salt were  mostly retail, but some bought to resell. Peddlers carried salt to  sell from village to village.    Some smiths traveled for their work, for instance, stonewrights  building arches and windows in churches, and lead workers putting  lead roofs on churches.    An example of a grant of hides of land is: \"[God has endowed King  Edred with England], wherefore he enriches and honors men, both  ecclesiastic and lay, who can justly deserve it. The truth of this  can be acknowledged by the thegn AElfsige Hunlafing through his  acquisition of the estate of 5 hides at Alwalton for himself and  his heirs, free from every burden except the repair of  fortifications, the building of bridges and military service; a  prudent landowner church dues, burial fees and tithes. [This land]  is to be held for all time and granted along with the things both  great and small belonging to it.\"    A Bishop gave land to a faithful attendant for his life and two  other lives as follows: \"In 904 A.D., I, Bishop Werfrith, with the  permission and leave of my honorable community in Worcester, grant  to Wulfsige, my reeve, for his loyal efficiency and humble  obedience, one hide of land at Aston as Herred held it, that is,  surrounded by a dyke, for three lives and then after three lives  the estate shall be given back without any controversy to  Worcester.\"    At seaports on the coast, goods were loaded onto vessels owned by  English merchants to be transported to other English seaports.  London was a market town on the north side of the Thames River and  the primary port and trading center for foreign merchants. Streets  that probably date from this time include Milk, Bread, and Wood  Streets, and Honey Lane. There were open-air markets such as  Billingsgate. There were wooden quays over much of the riverfront.  Houses were made of wood, with one sunken floor, or a ground floor  with a cellar beneath. Some had central stone hearths and earth  latrines. There were crude pottery cooking pots, beakers and  lamps, wool cloth, a little silk, simple leather shoes, pewter  jewelry, looms, and quernstones (for grinding flour). Wool, skins,  hides, wheat, meal, beer, lead, cheese, salt, and honey were  exported. Wine (mostly for the church), fish, timber, pitch,  pepper, garlic, spices, copper, gems, gold, silk, dyes, oil,  brass, sulphur, glass, slaves, and elephant and walrus ivory were  imported. Goods from the continent were sold at open stalls in  certain streets. Furs and slaves were traded. There was a royal  levy on exports by foreigners merchants. Southwark was reachable  by a bridge. It contained sleazy docks, prisons, gaming houses,  and brothels.    Guilds in London were first associations of neighbors for the  purposes of mutual assistance. They were fraternities of persons  by voluntary compact to assist each other in poverty, including  their widows or orphans and the portioning of poor maids, and to  protect each other from injury. Their essential features are and  continue to be in the future: 1) oath of initiation, 2) entrance  fee in money or in kind and a common fund, 3) annual feast and  mass, 4) meetings at least three times yearly for guild business,  5), obligation to attend all funerals of members, to bear the body  if need be from a distance, and to provide masses for the dead, 6)  the duty of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6615"],[0,"Myths and Legends of Our Own Land — Complete (#10)"],[1,"the  pond. Taken by surprise, and being insufficiently armed, the husband was  killed and his body flung into the water. Then, casting an affectionate  leer at the wife who had watched this act of treachery and malice with  speechless horror from the mountain-side, he drove his canoe ashore and  set off in pursuit of her. She retreated so slowly as to allow him to  keep her in sight, and when she entered a cave he pressed forward  eagerly, believing that now her escape was impossible; but she had  purposely trapped him there, for she had already explored a tortuous  passage that led to the upper air, and by this she had left the cavern in  safety while he was groping and calling in the dark. Returning to the  entrance, she loosened, by a jar, a ledge that overhung it, so that the  door was almost blocked; then, gathering light wood from the dry trees  around her, she made a fire and hurled the burning sticks into the prison  where the wretch was howling, until he was dead in smoke and flame. When  his yells and curses had been silenced she told a friend what she had  done, then going back to the lake, she sang her death-song and cast  herself into the water, hoping thus to rejoin her husband.          THE MONSTER MOSQUITOE    They have some pretty big mosquitoes in New Jersey and on Long Island,  but, if report of their ancestry is true, they have degenerated in size  and voracity; for the grandfather of all mosquitoes used to live in the  neighborhood of Fort Onondaga, New York, and sallying out whenever he was  hungry, would eat an Indian or two and pick his teeth with their ribs.  The red men had no arms that could prevail against it, but at last the  Holder of the Heavens, hearing their cry for aid, came down and attacked  the insect. Finding that it had met its match, the mosquito flew away so  rapidly that its assailant could hardly keep it in sight. It flew around  the great lake, then turned eastward again. It sought help vainly of the  witches that brooded in the sink-holes, or Green Lakes (near Janesville,  New York), and had reached the salt lake of Onondaga when its pursuer  came up and killed it, the creature piling the sand into hills in its  dying struggles.    As its blood poured upon the earth it became small mosquitoes, that  gathered about the Holder of the Heavens and stung him so sorely that he  half repented the service that he had done to men. The Tuscaroras say  that this was one of two monsters that stood on opposite banks of the  Seneca River and slew all men that passed. Hiawatha killed the other one.  On their reservation is a stone, marked by the form of the Sky Holder,  that shows where he rested during the chase, while his tracks were until  lately seen south of Syracuse, alternating with footprints of the  mosquito, which were shaped like those of a bird, and twenty inches long.  At Brighton, New York, where these marks appeared, they were  reverentially renewed by the Indians for many years.          THE GREEN PICTURE    In a cellar in Green Street, Schenectady, there appeared, some years ago,  the silhouette of a human form, painted on the floor in mould. It was  swept and scrubbed away, but presently it was there again, and month by  month, after each removal, it returned: a mass of fluffy mould, always in  the shape of a recumbent man. When it was found that the house stood on  the site of the old Dutch burial ground, the gossips fitted this and that  together and concluded that the mould was planted by a spirit whose  mortal part was put to rest a century and more ago, on the spot covered  by the house, and that the spirit took this way of apprising people that  they were trespassing on its grave. Others held that foul play had been  done, and that a corpse, hastily and shallowly buried, was yielding  itself back to the damp cellar in vegetable form, before its resolution  into simpler elements. But a darker meaning was that it was the outline  of a vampire that vainly strove to leave its grave, and could not because  a virtuous spell had been worked about the place.    A vampire is a dead man who walks about seeking for those whose blood he  can suck, for only by supplying new life to its cold limbs can he keep  the privilege of moving about the earth. He fights his way from his  coffin, and those who meet his gray and stiffened shape, with fishy eyes  and blackened mouth, lurking by open windows, biding his time to steal in  and drink up a human life, fly from him in terror and disgust. In  northern Rhode Island those who die of consumption are believed to be  victims of vampires who work by charm, draining the blood by slow  draughts as they lie in their graves. To lay this monster he must be  taken up and burned; at least, his heart must be; and he must be  disinterred in the daytime when he is asleep and unaware. If he died with  blood in his heart he has this power of nightly resurrection. As late as  1892 the ceremony of heart-burning was performed at Exeter, Rhode Island,  to save the family of a dead woman that was threatened with the same  disease that removed her, namely, consumption. But the Schenectady  vampire has yielded up all his substance, and the green picture is no  more.          THE NUNS OF CARTHAGE    At Carthage, New York, where the Black River bends gracefully about a  point, there was a stanch old house, built in the colonial fashion and  designed for the occupancy of some family of hospitality and wealth, but  the family died out or moved away, and for some years it remained  deserted. During the war of 1812 the village gossips were excited by the  appearance of carpenters, painters and upholsterers, and it was evident  that the place was to be restored to its manorial dignities; but their  curiosity was deepened instead of satisfied when, after the house had  been put in order and high walls built around it, the occupants presented  themselves as four young women in the garb of nuns. Were they daughters  of the family? Were they English sympathizers in disguise, seeking asylum  in the days of trouble? Had they registered a vow of celibacy until their  lovers should return from the war? Were they on a secret and diplomatic  errand? None ever knew, at least in Carthage. The nuns lived in great  privacy, but in a luxury before unequalled in that part of the country.  They kept a gardener, they received from New York wines and delicacies  that others could not afford, and when they took the air, still veiled,  it was behind a splendid pair of bays.    One afternoon, just after the close of the war, a couple of young  American officers went to the convent, and, contrary to all precedent,  were admitted. They remained within all that day, and no one saw them  leave, but a sound of wheels passed through the street that evening. Next  day there were no signs of life about the place, nor the day following,  nor the next. The savage dog was quiet and the garden walks had gone  unswept. Some neighbors climbed over the wall and reported that the place  had been deserted. Why and by whom no one ever knew, but a cloud remained  upon its title until a recent day, for it was thought that at some time  the nuns might return.          THE SKULL IN THE WALL    A skull is built into the wall above the door of the court-house at  Goshen, New York. It was taken from a coffin unearthed in 1842, when the  foundation of the building was laid. People said there was no doubt about  it, only Claudius Smith could have worn that skull, and he deserved to be  publicly pilloried in that manner. Before the Revolutionary war Smith was  a farmer in Monroe, New York, and being prosperous enough to feel the  king's taxes no burden, to say nothing of his jealousy of the advantage  that an independent government would be to the hopes of his poorer  neighbors, he declared for the king. After the declaration of  independence had been published, his sympathies were illustrated in an  unpleasantly practical manner by gathering a troop of other Tories about  him, and, emboldened by the absence of most of the men of his vicinage in  the colonial army, he began to harass the country as grievously in foray  as the red-coats were doing in open field.    He pillaged houses and barns, then burned them; he insulted women, he  drove away cattle and horses, he killed several persons who had  undertaken to defend their property. His \"campaigns\" were managed with  such secrecy that nobody knew when or whence to look for him. His murder  of Major Nathaniel Strong, of Blooming Grove, roused indignation to such  a point that a united effort was made to catch him, a money reward for  success acting as a stimulus to the vigilance of the hunters, and at last  he was captured on Long Island. He was sent back to Goshen, tried,  convicted, and on January 22, 1779, was hanged, with five of his band.  The bodies of the culprits were buried in the jail-yard, on the spot  where the court-house stands, and old residents identified Smith's  skeleton, when it was accidentally exhumed, by its uncommon size. A  farmer from an adjacent town made off with a thigh bone, and a mason  clapped mortar into the empty skull and cemented it into the wall, where  it long remained.          THE HAUNTED MILL    Among the settlers in the Adirondacks, forty or fifty years ago, was  Henry Clymer, from Brooklyn, who went up to Little Black Creek and tried  to make a farm out of the gnarly, stumpy land; but being a green hand at  that sort of thing, he soon gave it up and put up the place near  Northwood, that is locally referred to as the haunted mill. When the  first slab was cut, a big party was on hand to cheer and eat pie in honor  of the Clymers, for Mr. Clymer, who was a dark, hearty, handsome fellow,  and his bright young wife had been liberal in their hospitality. The  couple had made some talk, they were so loving before folks--too loving  to last; and, besides, it was evident that Mrs. Clymer was used to a  better"]]]
