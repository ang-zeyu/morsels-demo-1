The weather being hazy on the 22d and 23d, with strong gales, the  lieutenant did not venture to put to sea; but, on the 24th, though the  wind continued to be variable, he got under sail, and plied to the  northward within the reef, purposing to get out at a wider opening  than that by which he had entered the harbour. However, in doing this,  he was in imminent danger of striking on the rock. The master, who by  his order had kept continually sounding in the chains, suddenly called  out, 'two fathom.' Though our commander knew that the ship drew at  least fourteen feet, and consequently that the shoal could not  possibly be under her keel, he was, nevertheless, justly alarmed.  Happily, the master was either mistaken, or the Endeavour went along  the edge of a coral rock, many of which, in the neighbourhood of these  islands, are as steep as a wall.    After a tedious navigation of some days, during which several small  islands were seen, and the longboat landed at Otaha, Lieutenant Cook  returned to Ulietea, but to a different part of it from that which he  had visited before. In a harbour, belonging to the west side of the  island, he came to an anchor on the 1st of August. This measure was  necessary, in order to stop a leak which the ship had sprung in the  powder-room, and to take in more ballast, as she was found too light  to carry sail upon a wind. The place where the Endeavour was secured  was conveniently situated for the lieutenant's purpose of obtaining  ballast and water.    Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander and the gentlemen who went on shore this day,  spent their time much to their satisfaction. The reception they met  was respectful in the highest degree, and the behaviour of the Indians  to the English indicated a fear of them, mixed with a confidence that  they had no propensity to commit any kind of injury. In an intercourse  which the lieutenant and his friends carried on, for several days,  with the inhabitants of this part of the island, it appeared that the  terrors which Tupia had expressed of the Bolabola conquerors were  wholly groundless. Even Opoony, the formidable king of Bolabola,  treated our navigators with respect. Being at Ulietea on the 5th of  August, he sent Mr. Cook a present of three hogs, some fowls, and  several pieces of cloth, of uncommon length, together with a  considerable quantity of plaintains, cocoa-nuts, and other  refreshments. This present was accompanied with a message, that, on  the next day, he intended to pay our commander a visit. Accordingly,  on the 6th, the lieutenant and the rest of the gentlemen all staid at  home, in expectation of this important visitor; who did not, however,  make his appearance, but sent three very pretty girls as his  messengers, to demand something in return for his present. In the  afternoon, as the great king would not go to the English, the English  determined to go to the great king. From the account which had been  given of him, as lord of the Bolabola men, who were the conquerors of  Ulietea, and the terror of all the other islands, Lieutenant Cook and  his companions expected to see a young and vigorous chief, with an  intelligent countenance, and the marks of an enterprising spirit;  instead of which they found a feeble wretch, withered and decrepit,  half blind with age, and so sluggish and stupid, that he scarcely  appeared to be possessed even of a common degree of understanding.  Otaha being the principal place of Opoony's residence, he went with  our navigators to that island on the next day; and they were in hopes  of deriving some advantage from his influence, in obtaining such  provision as they wanted. In this respect, however, they were  disappointed; for, though they had presented him with an axe, as an  inducement to him to encourage his subjects in dealing with them they  were obliged to leave him without having procured a single article.    The time which the carpenters had taken up in stopping the leak of the  ship having detained our voyagers longer at Ulietea than they would  otherwise have staid, Lieutenant Cook determined to give up the design  of going on shore at Bolabola, especially as it appeared to be  difficult of access. The principal islands, about which the English  had now spent somewhat more than three weeks, were six in number;  Ulietea, Otaha, Bolabola, Huaheine, Tubai, and Maurua. As they lie  contigious to each other, the lieutenant gave them the general  appellation of the Society Islands; but did not think proper to  distinguish them separately by any other names than those by which  they were called by the natives.    On the 9th of August, the leak of the vessel having been stopped, and  the fresh stock that had been purchased being brought on board, our  commander took the opportunity of a breeze which sprang up at east,  and sailed out of the harbour. As he was sailing away, Tupia strongly  urged him to fire a shot towards Bolabola; and, though that island was  at seven leagues distance, the lieutenant obliged him by complying  with his request. Tupia's views probably were, to display a mark of  his resentment, and to shew the power of his new allies.    Our voyagers pursued their course, without meeting with any event  worthy of notice, till the 13th, when land was discovered, bearing  south-east, and which Tupia informed them to be an island called  Oheteroa. On the next day, Mr. Cook sent Mr. Gore, one of his  lieutenants, in the pinnace, with orders, that he should endeavour to  get onshore, and learn from the natives, whether there was anchorage  in a bay then in sight, and what land lay further to the southward.  Mr. Gore was accompanied in this expedition by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander  and Tupia, who used every method, but in vain, to conciliate the minds  of the inhabitants, and to engage them in a friendly intercourse. As,  upon making the circuit of the island, neither harbour nor anchorage  could be found upon it, and at the same time, the disposition of the  people was so hostile, that landing would be rendered impracticable  without bloodshed, Mr. Cook determined, with equal wisdom and  humanity, not to attempt it, having no motive that could justify the  risk of life.    From Tupia our navigators learned, that there were various islands  lying at different distances and in different directions from  Oheteroa, between the south and the north-west; and that to the  north-east there was an island called Manua, Bird Island. This he  represented as being at the distance of three days' sail; but he  seemed most desirous that Lieutenant Cook should proceed to the  westward, and described several islands in that situation, which he  said he had visited. It appeared from his description of them, that  these were probably Boscawen and Keppel's Islands, which were  discovered by Captain Wallis. The furthest island that Tupia knew of  to the southward, lay, he said, at the distance of about two days'  sail from Oheteroa, and was called Moutou. But he added, that his  father had informed him of there being islands still more to the  south. Upon the whole, our commander determined to stand southward in  search of a continent, and to lose no time in attempting to discover  any other islands, than such as he might happen to fall in with during  his course.    On the 15th of August, our voyagers sailed from Oheteroa; and, on the  25th of the same month was celebrated the anniversary of their  departure from England. The comet was seen on the 30th. It was a  little above the horizon, in the eastern part of the heavens, at one  in the morning; and at about half an hour after four it passed the  meridian, and its tail subtended an angle of forty-two degrees. Tupia,  who was among others that observed the comet, instantly cried out,  that as soon as it should be seen by the people of Bolabola, they  would attack the inhabitants of Ulietea, who would be obliged to  endeavour to preserve their lives by fleeing with the utmost  precipitation to the mountains.    On the 6th of October land was discovered, which appeared to be large.  When, on the next day, it was more distinctly visible, it assumed a  still larger appearance, and displayed four or five ranges of hills,  rising one over the other, above all which was a chain of mountains of  an enormous height. This land naturally became the subject of much  eager conversation; and the general opinion of the gentlemen on board  the Endeavour was, that they had found the _Terra australis  incognita_. In fact, it was a part of New Zealand, where the first  adventures the English met with were very unpleasant, on account of  the hostile disposition of the inhabitants.    Lieutenant Cook having anchored, on the 8th, in a bay, at the entrance  of a small river, went on shore in the evening, with the pinnace and  yawl, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, and attended with a  party of men. Being desirous of conversing with some natives, whom he  had observed on the opposite side of the river from that on which he  had landed, he ordered the yawl in, to carry himself and his  companions over, and left the pinnace at the entrance. When they came  near the place where the Indians were assembled, the latter all ran  away; and the gentlemen having left four boys to take care of the  yawl, walked up to several huts, which were about two or three hundred  yards from the water-side. They had not gone very far, when four men,  armed with long lances, rushed out of the woods, and, running up to  attack the boat, would certainly have cut her off, if they had not  been discovered by the people in the pinnace, who called to the boys  to drop down the stream. The boys instantly obeyed; but being closely  pursued by the natives, the cockswain of the pinnace, to whom the  charge of the boats was committed, fired a musket over their heads. At  this they stopped and looked around them; but their alarm speedily"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7787"],[0,"A Complete Grammar of Esperanto (#10)"],[1," house.

Names of instruments, tools or utensils may be formed by adding  the suffix \"-il-\" (followed by the ending \"-o\") to roots whose meaning  permits:       flugilo, wing (from flugi, to fly).     kaptilo, snare, trap (from kapti, to catch).     kudrilo, needle (from kudri, to sew).     montrilo, indicator, (clock) hand (from montri, to point out, show).     tenilo, handle (from teni, to hold).    [Footnote: The root of a word is that part of it which contains the  essential meaning, and to which the verb endings \"-i\", \"-as\", \"-is\",  \"-os\", the noun ending \"-o\", the adjective ending \"-a\", etc., are  attached, when no suffix intervenes. Thus, \"vir-\" is the root of \"viro\"  and of \"virino\"; \"kur-\" is the root of \"kuri\", etc.]                    THE EXPRESSION OF MEANS OR INSTRUMENTALITY.    64. The means or instrumentality through which an act is accomplished is  expressed by use of the preposition \"per\":       Oni kudras per kudrilo, one sews by means of (with) a needle.     La birdoj flugas per flugiloj, the birds fly by (with) wings.     Li amuzas sin per tiuj bildoj,        he amuses himself with (by) those pictures.

An adverb is a word which modifies the meaning of a verb, adjective,  another adverb, or phrase. It may express manner, time, degree,  negation, etc. Adverbs are either primary, as \"now,\" \"almost,\" or  derived, as \"glad-ly,\" \"sweet-ly,\" The Esperanto primary adverbs given  in this and in preceding lessons may be classified as follows:                    (a) Temporal Adverbs (expressing time).             baldaux = soon.             morgaux = tomorrow.           hieraux = yesterday.        nun = now.           hodiaux = today.            tuj = immediately.                             (b) Adverbs of Degree.             almenaux = at least.        preskaux = almost.           nur = merely.               tre = very, much.                      (c) Adverbs Expressing Other Ideas.             addition: ankaux = also.    emphasis: ecx = even.           interrogation: cxu, (30).   affirmation: jes = yes.           proximity: cxi, (60).       negation: ne = not, no, (27).    a. An adverb usually precedes, but may also follow, the word or words  which it modifies. It must be so placed as to leave no doubt about which  of two words or word-groups it is intended to modify. Thus, \"mi preskaux  volis havi tiun\" clearly means \"I almost wished to have that\"; but \"mi  volis preskaux havi tiun\" might mean either \"I almost wished to have  that,\" or more probably \"I wished almost to have that.\" An example of  permissible variation in the position of adverbs is shown in questions  to which an affirmative answer is expected. Such questions may be put in  the form of a statement, followed by \"cxu ne\" (instead of having \"cxu\"  introduce the sentence, with \"ne\" in its normal position):       Li venos, cxu ne? He will come, will he not?     La vetero estas bela, cxu ne? The weather is beautiful, is it not?     Vi auxdis tiun diron, cxu ne? You heard that remark, did you not?                              FORMATION OF OPPOSITES.    67. If the meaning of a word is such that it can have a direct opposite,  such opposite may be formed from it by use of the prefix \"mal-\":       malalta = low, short (from \"alta\", high, tall).     malamiko = enemy (from \"amiko\", friend).     maldekstra = left (from \"dekstra\", right).     malhelpi = to hinder (from \"helpi\", to help).     maljuna = aged, old (from \"juna\", young).     malnova = old, not new (from \"nova\", new).    [Footnote: Cf. English \"malcontent\", \"discontented,\" \"maladroit\",  \"clumsy.\"]                                     VOCABULARY       dum = during.                      povi = to be able.     ecx = even.                        preni = to take.     gardi = to guard.                  propono = proposal.     helpi = to help, to aid.           respondi = to answer.     honti = to be ashamed.             ruza = sly, cunning.     kara = dear.                       sxteli = to steal.     kontenta = satisfied.              tia = that kind of (65).     kuragxa = courageous.              tuj = immediately.     nokto = night.                     vocxo = voice.                                 LA RUZA JUNA VIRO.    Ruza juna viro kaj bona maljuna viro iris trans dezerton. Tiu havis  nigran cxevalon, cxi tiu havis blankan cxevalon. \"Vi gardos niajn  cxevalojn dum la nokto, cxu ne?\" diris la juna viro per dolcxa vocxo al  sia amiko, \"Cxar dum la nokto oni ne povos vidi mian nigran cxevalon,  sed malamikoj povos tuj vidi vian blankan cxevalon. Oni povos sxteli  tian cxevalon, cxar vi estas maljuna kaj malforta, kaj ne povos malhelpi  malamikojn.\" Tia propono ne sxajnis agrabla al la maljuna viro. Li ne  estis kontenta, tamen li ne volis perdi sian cxevalon, cxar li estis  malricxa. Li diris al si ke li donos sian blankan cxevalon al la juna  viro, kaj prenos ties nigran cxevalon. Tuj li diris al cxi tiu \"Sed per  via helpo mi ne perdos mian cxevalon: mi donos la mian al vi, kaj prenos  vian cxevalon. La via estas malbela, sed gxi estas almenaux nigra; vi  donos gxin al mi, cxu ne?\" \"Jes,\" respondis la ruza juna viro, kaj li  donis sian nigran cxevalon al tiu, kaj prenis la blankan cxevalon.  \"Nun,\" diris la maljuna viro, \"Vi estas kuragxa kaj forta, kaj vi gardos  la cxevalojn, cxu ne? Vi povos malhelpi malamikojn per tiu granda akra  trancxilo, kaj oni ne povos sxteli "]]]
