As a proof of this assertion, I need only  mention the vast sums of money which they have expended at different  times in endeavouring to establish fisheries, though without success:  and the following Journey, together with the various attempts made by  Bean, Christopher, Johnston, and Duncan,[13] to find a North West  passage, are recent proofs that the present members are as desirous of  making discoveries, as they are of extending their trade.    That air of mystery, and affectation of secrecy, perhaps, which formerly  attended some of the Company's proceedings in the Bay, might give rise  to those conjectures; and the unfounded assertions and unjust aspersions  of Dobbs, {xxii} Ellis, Robson, Dragge, and the American Traveller,[14]  the only Authors that have written on Hudson's Bay, and who have all,  from motives of interest or revenge, taken a particular pleasure in  arraigning the conduct of the Company, without having any real knowledge  of their proceedings, or any experience in their service, on which to  found their charges, must have contributed to confirm the public in that  opinion. Most of those Writers, however, advance such notorious  absurdities, that none except those who are already prejudiced against  the Company can give them credit.[B]    Robson, from his six years' residence in Hudson's Bay and in the  Company's service, might naturally have been supposed to know something  of the climate and soil immediately round the Factories at which he  resided; but the whole of his book is evidently written with prejudice,  and dictated by a spirit of revenge, because his romantic and  inconsistent schemes were rejected by the Company. Besides, it is well  known that Robson was no more than a tool in the hand of Mr. Dobbs.    The American Traveller, though a more elegant writer, has still less  claim to our indulgence, as his assertions are {xxiii} a greater tax on  our credulity. His saying that he discovered several large lumps of the  finest virgin copper[C] is such a palpable falsehood that it needs no  refutation. No man, either English or Indian, ever found a bit of copper  in that country to the South of the seventy-first degree of  latitude,[16] unless it had been accidentally dropped by some of the far  Northern Indians in their way to the Company's Factory.    The natives who range over, rather than inhabit, the large tract of land  which lies to the North of Churchill River, having repeatedly brought  samples of copper to the Company's Factory, many of our people  conjectured that it was found not far from our settlements; and as the  Indians informed them that the mines were not very distant from a large  river, it was generally supposed that this river must empty itself into  Hudson's Bay; as they could by no means think that any set of people,  however wandering their manner of life might be, could ever traverse so  large a tract of country as to pass the Northern boundary of that Bay,  and particularly without the assistance of water-carriage. The following  Journal, however, will show how much those people have been mistaken,  and prove also the improbability of putting their favourite scheme of  mining into practice.    {xxiv} The accounts of this grand River, which some have turned into a  Strait, together with the samples of copper, were brought to the  Company's Factory at Churchill River immediately after its first  establishment, in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifteen; and  it does not appear that any attempts were made to discover either the  river or mines till the year one thousand seven hundred and nineteen,  when the Company fitted out a ship, called the _Albany Frigate_, Captain  George Barlow,[D] and a sloop {xxv} called the _Discovery_, Captain  David Vaughan. The sole command of this expedition, however, was given  to Mr. James Knight, a man of great experience in the Company's service,  who had been many years Governor at the different Factories in the Bay,  and who had made the first settlement at Churchill River.  Notwithstanding the experience Mr. Knight might have had of the  Company's business, and his knowledge of those parts of the Bay where he  had resided, it cannot be supposed he was well acquainted with the  nature of the business in which he then engaged, having nothing to  direct him but the slender and imperfect accounts which he had received  from the Indians, who at that time were little known, and less  understood.    {xxvi} Those disadvantages, added to his advanced age, he being then  near eighty, by no means discouraged this bold adventurer; who was so  prepossessed of his success, and of the great advantage that would arise  from his discoveries, that he procured, and took with him, some large  iron-bound chests, to hold gold dust and other valuables, which he  fondly flattered himself were to be found in those parts.    The first paragraph of the Company's Orders to Mr. Knight on this  occasion appears to be as follows:        \"_To_ CAPTAIN JAMES KNIGHT.      \"_4th June, 1719._        \"SIR,        \"From the experience we have had of your abilities in the      management of our affairs, we have, upon your application to us,      fitted out the _Albany_ frigate, Captain George Barlow, and the      _Discovery_, Captain David Vaughan, Commander, upon a discovery      to the Northward; and to that end have given you power and      authority to act and do all things relating to the said voyage,      the navigation of the said ship and sloop only excepted; and      have given orders and instructions to our said Commanders for      that purpose.        \"You are, with the first opportunity of wind and weather, to      depart from Gravesend on your intended {xxvii} voyage, and by      God's permission, to find out the Straits of Anian, in order to      discover gold and other valuable commodities to the Northward,      &c. &c.\"    Mr. Knight soon left Gravesend, and proceeded on his voyage; but the  ship not returning to England that year, as was expected, it was judged  that she had wintered in Hudson's Bay; and having on board a good stock  of provisions, a house in frame, together with all necessary mechanics,  and a great assortment of trading goods, little or no thoughts were  entertained of their not being in safety; but as neither ship nor sloop  returned to England in the following year, (one thousand seven hundred  and twenty), the Company were much alarmed for their welfare; and, by  their ship which went to Churchill in the year one thousand seven  hundred and twenty-one, they sent orders for a sloop called the  _Whale-Bone_, John Scroggs Master, to go in search of them; but the ship  not arriving in Churchill till late in the year, those orders could not  be put in execution till the Summer following (one thousand seven  hundred and twenty-two).    The North West coast of Hudson's Bay being little known in those days,  and Mr. Scroggs finding himself greatly embarrassed with shoals and  rocks, returned to Prince of Wales's Fort without making any certain  discovery respecting the above ship or sloop; for all the marks he saw  among the Esquimaux at Whale Cove scarcely {xxviii} amounted to the  spoils which might have been made from a trifling accident, and  consequently could not be considered as signs of a total shipwreck.    The strong opinion which then prevailed in Europe respecting the  probability of a North West passage by the way of Hudson's Bay, made  many conjecture that Messrs. Knight and Barlow had found that passage,  and had gone through it into the South Sea, by the way of California.  Many years elapsed without any other convincing proof occurring to the  contrary, except that Middleton, Ellis, Bean, Christopher, and Johnston,  had not been able to find any such passage. And notwithstanding a sloop  was annually sent to the Northward on discovery, and to trade with the  Esquimaux, it was the Summer of one thousand seven hundred and  sixty-seven, before we had positive proofs that poor Mr. Knight and  Captain Barlow had been lost in Hudson's Bay.    The Company were now carrying on a black whale fishery, and Marble  Island was made the place of rendezvous, not only on account of the  commodiousness of the harbour, but because it had been observed that the  whales were more plentiful about that island than on any other part of  the coast. This being the case, the boats, when on the look-out for  fish, had frequent occasion to row close to the island, by which means  they discovered a new harbour near the East end of it, at the head  {xxix} of which they found guns, anchors, cables, bricks, a smith's  anvil, and many other articles, which the hand of time had not defaced,  and which being of no use to the natives, or too heavy to be removed by  them, had not been taken from the place in which they were originally  laid. The remains of the house, though pulled to pieces by the Esquimaux  for the wood and iron, are yet very plain to be seen, as also the hulls,  or more properly speaking, the bottoms of the ship and sloop, which lie  sunk in about five fathoms water, toward the head of the harbour. The  figure-head of the ship, and also the guns, &c. were sent home to the  Company, and are certain proofs that Messrs. Knight and Barlow had been  lost on that inhospitable island, where neither stick nor stump was to  be seen, and which lies near sixteen miles from the main land. Indeed  the main is little better, being a jumble of barren hills and rocks,  destitute of every kind of herbage except moss and grass; and at that  part, the woods are several hundreds of miles from the sea-side.    In the Summer of one thousand seven hundred and sixty-nine, while we  were prosecuting the fishery, we saw several Esquimaux at this new  harbour; and perceiving that one or two of them were greatly advanced in  years, our curiosity was excited to ask them some questions concerning  the above ship and sloop, which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38418"],[0,"From Manassas to Appomattox: Memoirs of the Civil War in America (#10)"],[1,"boggy. The lagoons  above and below were deep, so that the crossing was intricate and slow.  Colonel Early came in with his other regiments, formed his line behind my  front, and was asked to hurry his troops to the front line, lest the next  attack should catch him behind us, when his raw men would be sure to fire  on the line in front of them. He failed to comprehend, however, and  delayed till the next attack, when his men promptly returned fire at  anything and everything before them. I thought to stop the fire by riding  in front of his line, but found it necessary to dismount and lie under it  till the loads were discharged. With the Federals on the bluff pouring  down their fire, and Early's tremendous fire in our rear, soldiers and  officers became mixed and a little confused. Part of my men got across the  Run and partially up the bluff of the enemy's side; a body of the Union  soldiers were met at the crest, where shots were exchanged, but passing  the Run, encountering the enemy in front, and receiving fire from our  friends in rear were not reassuring, even in handling veterans. The recall  was ordered as the few of the enemy's most advanced parties joined issue  with Captain Marye of my advance. Federal prisoners were brought in with  marks of burnt powder on their faces, and Captain Marye and some of his  men of the Seventeenth, who brought them in, had their faces and clothing  soiled by like marks. At the first moment of this confusion it seemed that  a vigorous pressure by the enemy would force us back to the farther edge  of the open field, and, to reach that stronger ground, preparations were  considered, but with the aid of Colonels Garland and Corse order was  restored, the Federals were driven off, and the troops better distributed.  This was the last effort on the part of the infantry, and was followed by  the Federal batteries throwing shot and shell through the trees above our  heads. As we were under the bluff, the fire was not annoying, except  occasionally when some of the branches of the trees were torn off and  dropped among us. One shot passed far over, and dropped in the house in  which General Beauregard was about to sit down to his dinner. The  interruption so annoyed him that he sent us four six-pound and three rifle  guns of the Washington Artillery, under Captain Eshleman, to return fire  and avenge the loss of his dinner. The guns had good cover under the  bluff, by pushing them as close up as would admit of effective fire over  it; but under tactical formation the limbers and caissons were so far in  rear as to bring them under destructive fire. The men, thinking it  unsoldier-like to flinch, or complain of their exposure, worked away very  courageously till the limbers and caissons were ordered forward, on the  right and left of the guns, to safer cover. The combat lasted about an  hour, when the Federals withdrew to their ground about Centreville, to  the delight of the Confederates. After this lively affair the report came  of a threatened advance off to our right. General Beauregard recalled  Early's command to its position in that quarter. He was ordered to march  to the right, under the bluff, so that his men could not come within range  of the batteries, but he chose to march back on the road leading directly  to the rear, when the dust of his columns drew fire of a battery, and  several damaging shots were thrown among his troops. The Confederate  losses were sixty-eight; Federal, eighty-three. The effect of this little  affair was encouraging to the Confederates, and as damaging to the  Federals. By the double action of success and failure the Confederate  infantry felt themselves christened veterans. The Washington Artillery was  equally proud of its even combat against the famed batteries of United  States regulars.    McDowell was disposed to ignore this fight as unwarranted under his  instructions, and not a necessary adjunct of his plans. His course and  that of the officers about him reduced the aggressive spirit of the  division commander to its minimum, and had some influence upon the troops  of the division. For battle at this time McDowell had 37,300[3] men and  forty-nine guns. Beauregard had 20,500[4] men and twenty-nine guns.          CHAPTER III.    BATTLE OF MANASSAS, OR BULL RUN.

Before treating of future operations, I should note the situation of the  Confederate contingents in the Shenandoah Valley and at Acquia Creek. The  latter was ordered up to reinforce Beauregard as soon as the advance from  Washington took definite shape, and arrived as a supporting brigade to his  right on the 19th of July. At the same time orders were sent authorizing  Johnston's withdrawal from the Valley, to join with Beauregard for the  approaching conflict. The use of these contingents was duly considered by  both sides some days before the campaign was put on foot.    Opposing Johnston in the Valley was General Robert Patterson, of  Philadelphia, a veteran of the war of 1812 and of the Mexican War,  especially distinguished in the latter by the prestige of the former  service. Johnston was a veteran of the Mexican War, who had won  distinction by progressive service and was well equipped in the science of  war. Beauregard and McDowell were also veterans of the Mexican War, of  staff service, and distinguished for intelligent action and attainments,  both remarkable for physical as well as mental power.      [Illustration: BATTLE OF BULL RUN July 21st, 1861]      Between Johnston and Beauregard the Blue Ridge stretched out from the  Potomac southwest far below the southern line of Virginia, cut  occasionally by narrow passes, quite defensible by small bodies of  infantry and artillery. Patterson was ordered to hold Johnston in the  Valley, while McDowell should direct his strength against Beauregard.  McDowell seems to have accepted that order as not only possible, but sure  of success, while the Confederates viewed the question from the other  side, in a reverse light, and, as will presently appear, with better  judgment.    So far as it is possible to project a battle before reaching the field, it  seems that McDowell had concluded upon the move finally made before  setting out on his march from Washington. It was to give him an open  field, with superior numbers and appointments, and when successful was to  give him the approach to the base line of his adversary with fine  prospects of cutting off retreat. His ride to view the approaches of the  Confederate right on the morning of the 18th was made to confirm his  preconceived plan. The reconnoissance made by Tyler on the same morning  reinforced his judgment, so that the strategic part of the campaign was  concluded on that morning, except as to the means to be adopted to secrete  or mislead in his movement as long as possible, leaving, we may say, the  result to tactical operations. But tactics is time, and more decisive of  results than strategy when wisely adjusted.    Johnston was sixty miles away from Beauregard, but the delay of three  days, for McDowell's march _via_ Sudley Springs, so reduced the distance  in time and space as to make the consolidation easy under well-organized  transportation facilities. Holmes's brigade and six-gun battery were  posted in rear of Ewell's brigade.    General McDowell's order for battle on the 21st of July was issued on the  afternoon of the 20th, directing his First Division to march by the  Warrenton Turnpike, and make a diversion against the crossing of Bull Run  at the Stone Bridge, while the Second and Third Divisions, following on  the turnpike, were to file to the right, along the farm road, about  half-way between Centreville and the bridge, cross Bull Run at Sudley  Springs, and bear down against the Confederate rear and left; the First  Division, under Tyler, to march at two o'clock in the morning, to be  closely followed by the others under Hunter and Heintzelman; the turning  divisions, after crossing, to march down, clear the bridge, and lift Tyler  over the Run, bringing the three into compact battle order.    General Johnston came in from the Shenandoah Valley on the 20th with the  brigades of Bee, Bartow, and Jackson. The brigades were assigned by  Beauregard, the former two in reserve near the right of Blackburn's Ford,  the latter near its left.    Beauregard's order for battle, approved by General Johnston, was issued at  five A.M. on the 21st,--the brigades at Union Mills Ford to cross and  march by the road leading towards Centreville, and in rear of the Federal  reserve at that point; the brigades at McLean's Ford to follow the move of  those on their right, and march on a converging road towards Centreville;  those at and near Blackburn's to march in co-operative action with the  brigades on the right; the reserve brigades and troops at Mitchell's Ford  to be used as emergency called, but in the absence of special orders to  seek the most active point of battle.    This order was only preliminary, coupled with the condition that the  troops were to be held ready to move, but to wait for the special order  for action. The brigade at Blackburn's Ford had been reinforced by the  Fifth North Carolina and Twenty-fourth Virginia Regiments, under  Lieutenant-Colonel Jones and Colonel Kemper. I crossed the Run under the  five o'clock order, adjusted the regiments to position for favorable  action, and gave"]]]
