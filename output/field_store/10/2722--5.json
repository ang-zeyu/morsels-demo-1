Laili stayed in the garden, hidden in the tall grass, till Prince  Majnun and Husain Mahamat came to walk in the garden. King Dantal was  now a very old man, and Husain Mahamat, though he was really only as  old as Prince Majnun, looked a great deal older than the prince, who  had been made quite young again when he married Laili.    As Prince Majnun and the Wazir's son walked in the garden, they  gathered the fruit as they had done as little children, only they bit  the fruit with their teeth; they did not cut it. While Majnun was busy  eating a fruit in this way, and was talking to Husain Mahamat, he  turned towards him and saw Laili walking behind the Wazir's son. \"Oh,  look, look!\" he cried, \"see what is following you; it is a Rakshas or  a demon, and I am sure it is going to eat us.\" Laili looked at him  beseechingly with all her eyes, and trembled with age and eagerness;  but this only frightened Majnun the more. \"It is a Rakshas, a  Rakshas!\" he cried, and he ran quickly to the palace with the Wazir's  son; and as they ran away, Laili disappeared into the jungle. They ran  to King Dantal, and Majnun told him there was a Rakshas or a demon in  the garden that had come to eat them.    \"What nonsense,\" said his father. \"Fancy two grown men being so  frightened by an old ayah or a fakir! And if it had been a Rakshas, it  would not have eaten you.\" Indeed King Dantal did not believe Majnun  had seen anything at all, till Husain Mahamat said the prince was  speaking the exact truth. They had the garden searched for the  terrible old woman, but found nothing, and King Dantal told his son he  was very silly to be so much frightened. However, Prince Majnun would  not walk in the garden any more.    The next day Laili turned into a pretty little dog; and in this shape  she came into the palace, where Prince Majnun soon became very fond of  her. She followed him everywhere, went with him when he was out  hunting, and helped him to catch his game, and Prince Majnun fed her  with milk, or bread, or anything else he was eating, and at night the  little dog slept in his bed.    But one night the little dog disappeared, and in its stead there lay  the little old woman who had frightened him so much in the garden; and  now Prince Majnun was quite sure she was a Rakshas, or a demon, or  some such horrible thing come to eat him; and in his terror he cried  out, \"What do you want? Oh, do not eat me; do not eat me!\" Poor Laili  answered, \"Don't you know me? I am your wife Laili, and I want to  marry you. Don't you remember how you would go through that jungle,  though I begged and begged you not to go, for I told you that harm  would happen to me, and then a fakir came and threw powder in my face,  and I became a heap of ashes. But Khuda gave me my life again, and  brought me here, after I had stayed a long, long while in the jungle  crying for you, and now I am obliged to be a little dog; but if you  will marry me, I shall not be a little dog any more.\" Majnun, however,  said \"How can I marry an old woman like you? how can you be Laili? I  am sure you are a Rakshas or a demon come to eat me,\" and he was in  great terror.    In the morning the old woman had turned into the little dog, and the  prince went to his father and told him all that had happened. \"An old  woman! an old woman! always an old woman!\" said his father. \"You do  nothing but think of old women. How can a strong man like you be so  easily frightened?\" However, when he saw that his son was really in  great terror, and that he really believed the old woman would came  back at night, he advised him to say to her, \"I will marry you if you  can make yourself a young girl again. How can I marry such an old  woman as you are?\"    That night as he lay trembling in bed the little old woman lay there  in place of the dog, crying \"Majnun, Majnun, I want to marry you. I  have loved you all these long, long years. When I was in my father's  kingdom a young girl, I knew of you, though you knew nothing of me,  and we should have been married then if you had not gone away so  suddenly, and for long, long years I followed you.\" \"Well,\" said  Majnun, \"if you can make yourself a young girl again, I will marry  you.\"    Laili said, \"Oh, that is quite easy. Khuda will make me a young girl  again. In two days' time you must go into the garden, and there you  will see a beautiful fruit. You must gather it and bring it into your  room and cut it open yourself very gently, and you must not open it  when your father or anybody else is with you, but when you are quite  alone; for I shall be in the fruit quite naked, without any clothes at  all on.\" In the morning Laili took her little dog's form, and  disappeared in the garden.    Prince Majnun told all this to his father, who told him to do all the  old woman had bidden him. In two days' time he and the Wazir's son  walked in the garden, and there they saw a large, lovely red fruit.  \"Oh!\" said the Prince, \"I wonder shall I find my wife in that fruit.\"  Husain Mahamat wanted him to gather it and see, but he would not till  he had told his father, who said, \"That must be the fruit; go and  gather it.\" So Majnun went back and broke the fruit off its stalk; and  he said to his father, \"Come with me to my room while I open it; I am  afraid to open it alone, for perhaps I shall find a Rakshas in it that  will eat me.\"    \"No,\" said King Dantal; \"remember, Laili will be naked; you must go  alone and do not be afraid if, after all, a Rakshas is in the fruit,  for I will stay outside the door, and you have only to call me with a  loud voice, and I will come to you, so the Rakshas will not be able to  eat you.\"    Then Majnun took the fruit and began to cut it open tremblingly, for  he shook with fear; and when he had cut it, out stepped Laili, young  and far more beautiful than she had ever been. At the sight of her  extreme beauty, Majnun fell backwards fainting on the floor.    Laili took off his turban and wound it all round herself like a sari  (for she had no clothes at all on), and then she called King Dantal,  and said to him sadly, \"Why has Majnun fallen down like this? Why will  he not speak to me? He never used to be afraid of me; and he has seen  me so many, many times.\"    King Dantal answered, \"It is because you are so beautiful. You are  far, far more beautiful than you ever were. But he will be very happy  directly.\" Then the King got some water, and they bathed Majnun's face  and gave him some to drink, and he sat up again.    Then Laili said, \"Why did you faint? Did you not see I am Laili?\"    \"Oh!\" said Prince Majnun, \"I see you are Laili come back to me, but  your eyes have grown so wonderfully beautiful, that I fainted when I  saw them.\" Then they were all very happy, and King Dantal had all the  drums in the place beaten, and had all the musical instruments played  on, and they made a grand wedding-feast, and gave presents to the  servants, and rice and quantities of rupees to the fakirs.    After some time had passed very happily, Prince Majnun and his wife  went out to eat the air. They rode on the same horse, and had only a  groom with them. They came to another kingdom, to a beautiful garden.  \"We must go into that garden and see it,\" said Majnun.    \"No, no,\" said Laili; \"it belongs to a bad Raja, Chumman Basa, a very  wicked man.\" But Majnun insisted on going in, and in spite of all  Laili could say, he got off the horse to look at the flowers. Now, as  he was looking at the flowers, Laili saw Chumman Basa coming towards  them, and she read in his eyes that he meant to kill her husband and  seize her. So she said to Majnun, \"Come, come, let us go; do not go  near that bad man. I see in his eyes, and I feel in my heart, that he  will kill you to seize me.\"    \"What nonsense,\" said Majnun. \"I believe he is a very good Raja.  Anyhow, I am so near to him that I could not get away.\"    \"Well,\" said Laili, \"it is better that you should be killed than I,  for if I were to be killed a second time, Khuda would not give me my  life again; but I can bring you to life if you are killed.\" Now  Chumman Basa had come quite near, and seemed very pleasant, so thought  Prince Majnun; but when he was speaking to Majnun, he drew his  scimitar and cut off the prince's head at one blow.    Laili sat quite still on her horse, and as the Raja came towards her  she said, \"Why did you kill my husband?\"    \"Because I want to take you,\" he answered.    \"You cannot,\" said Laili.    \"Yes, I can,\" said the Raja.    \"Take me, then,\" said Laili to Chumman Basa; so he came quite close  and put out his hand to take hers to lift her off her horse. But she  put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a tiny knife, only as long  as her hand was broad, and this knife unfolded itself in one instant  till it was such a length! and then Laili made a great sweep with her  arm and her long, long knife, and off came Chumman Basa's head at one  touch.    Then Laili slipped down off her horse, and she went to Majnun's dead  body, and she cut her little finger inside her hand straight down from  the top of her nail to her palm, and out of this gushed blood like  healing medicine. Then she put Majnun's head on his shoulders, and  smeared her healing blood all over the wound, and Majnun woke up and  said, \"What a delightful sleep I have had! Why, I feel as if I had  slept for years!\" Then he got up and saw the Raja's dead body by  Laili's horse.    \"What's that?\" said Majnun.    \"That is the wicked Raja who killed you to seize me, just as I said he  would.\"    \"Who killed him?\" asked Majnun.    \"I did,\" answered Laili, \"and it was I who brought you to life.\"    \"Do bring the poor man to life if you know how to do so,\" said Majnun.    \"No,\" said Laili, \"for he is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/713"],[0,"Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions — Volume 2 (#10)"],[1,"immediately admitted. He said that, some weeks  previously, at the time the Christians were besieging Antioch, he was  reposing alone in his tent, when he was startled by the shock of the  earthquake, which had so alarmed the whole host. Through violent terror  of the shock he could only ejaculate, God help me! when turning round  he saw two men standing before him, whom he at once recognized by the  halo of glory around them as beings of another world. One of them  appeared to be an aged man, with reddish hair sprinkled with grey,  black eyes, and a long flowing grey beard. The other was younger,  larger, and handsomer, and had something more divine in his aspect. The  elderly man alone spoke, and informed him that he was the Holy Apostle  St. Andrew, and desired him to seek out the Count Raymond, the Bishop  of Puy, and Raymond of Altopulto, and ask them why the Bishop did not  exhort the people, and sign them with the cross which he bore. The  Apostle then took him, naked in his shirt as he was, and transported  him through the air into the heart of the city of Antioch, where he led  him into the church of St. Peter, at that time a Saracen mosque. The  Apostle made him stop by the pillar close to the steps by which they  ascend on the south side to the altar, where hung two lamps, which gave  out a light brighter than that of the noonday sun; the younger man,  whom he did not at that time know, standing afar off, near the steps of  the altar. The Apostle then descended into the ground and brought up a  lance, which he gave into his hand, telling him that it was the very  lance that had opened the side whence had flowed the salvation of the  world. With tears of joy he held the holy lance, and implored the  Apostle to allow him to take it away and deliver it into the hands of  Count Raymond. The Apostle refused, and buried the lance again in the  ground, commanding him, when the city was won from the infidels, to go  with twelve chosen men, and dig it up again in the same place. The  Apostle then transported him back to his tent, and the two vanished  from his sight. He had neglected, he said, to deliver this message,  afraid that his wonderful tale would not obtain credence from men of  such high rank. After some days he again saw the holy vision, as he was  gone out of the camp to look for food.  This time the divine eyes of  the younger looked reproachfully upon him. He implored the Apostle to  choose some one else more fitted for the mission, but the Apostle  refused, and smote him with a disorder of the eyes, as a punishment for  his disobedience. With an obstinacy unaccountable even to himself, he  had still delayed. A third time the Apostle and his companion had  appeared to him, as he was in a tent with his master William at St.  Simeon. On that occasion St. Andrew told him to bear his command to the  Count of Toulouse not to bathe in the waters of the Jordan when he came  to it, but to cross over in a boat, clad in a shirt and breeches of  linen, which he should sprinkle with the sacred waters of the river.  These clothes he was afterwards to preserve along with the holy lance.  His master William, although he could not see the saint, distinctly  heard the voice giving orders to that effect. Again he neglected to  execute the commission, and again the saints appeared to him, when he  was at the port of Mamistra, about to sail for Cyprus, and St. Andrew  threatened him with eternal perdition if he refused longer. Upon this  he made up his mind to divulge all that had been revealed to him.    The Count of Toulouse, who, in all probability, concocted this precious  tale with the priest, appeared struck with the recital, and sent  immediately for the Bishop of Puy and Raymond of Altapulto. The Bishop  at once expressed his disbelief of the whole story, and refused to have  anything to do in the matter. The Count of Toulouse, on the contrary,  saw abundant motives, if not for believing, for pretending to believe;  and, in the end, he so impressed upon the mind of the Bishop the  advantage that might be derived from it, in working up the popular mind  to its former excitement, that the latter reluctantly agreed to make  search in due form for the holy weapon. The day after the morrow was  fixed upon for the ceremony, and, in the mean time, Peter was consigned  to the care of Raymond, the Count's chaplain, in order that no profane  curiosity might have an opportunity of cross-examining him, and putting  him to a nonplus.    Twelve devout men were forthwith chosen for the undertaking, among whom  were the Count of Toulouse and his chaplain. They began digging at  sunrise, and continued unwearied till near sunset, without finding the  lance;--they might have dug till this day with no better success, had  not Peter himself sprung into the pit, praying to God to bring the  lance to light, for the strengthening and victory of his people. Those  who hide know where to find; and so it was with Peter, for both he and  the lance found their way into the hole at the same time. On a sudden,  he and Raymond, the chaplain, beheld its point in the earth, and  Raymond, drawing it forth, kissed it with tears of joy, in sight of the  multitude which had assembled in the church. It was immediately  enveloped in a rich purple cloth, already prepared to receive it, and  exhibited in this state to the faithful, who made the building resound  with their shouts of gladness.    Peter had another vision the same night, and became from that day forth  \"dreamer of dreams,\" in general, to the army. He stated on the  following day, that the Apostle Andrew and \"the youth with the divine  aspect\" appeared to him again, and directed that the Count of Toulouse,  as a reward for his persevering piety, should carry the Holy Lance at  the head of the army, and that the day on which it was found should be  observed as a solemn festival throughout Christendom. St.  Andrew  showed him, at the same time, the holes in the feet and hands of his  benign companion; and he became convinced that he stood in the awful  presence of THE REDEEMER.    Peter gained so much credit by his visions that dreaming became  contagious. Other monks beside himself were visited by the saints, who  promised victory to the host if it would valiantly hold out to the  last, and crowns of eternal glory to those who fell in the fight. Two  deserters, wearied of the fatigues and privations of the war, who had  stealthily left the camp, suddenly returned, and seeking Bohemund, told  him that they had been met by two apparitions, who, with great anger,  had commanded them to return. The one of them said, that he recognized  his brother, who had been killed in battle some months before, and that  he had a halo of glory around his head. The other, still more hardy,  asserted that the apparition which had spoken to him was the Saviour  himself, who had promised eternal happiness as his reward if he  returned to his duty, but the pains of eternal fire if he rejected the  cross. No one thought of disbelieving these men. The courage of the  army immediately revived; despondency gave way to hope; every arm grew  strong again, and the pangs of hunger were for a time disregarded. The  enthusiasm which had led them from Europe burned forth once more as  brightly as ever, and they demanded, with loud cries, to be led against  the enemy. The leaders were not unwilling. In a battle lay their only  chance of salvation; and although Godfrey, Bohemund, and Tancred  received the story of the lance with much suspicion, they were too wise  to throw discredit upon an imposture which bade fair to open the gates  of victory.    Peter the Hermit was previously sent to the camp of Kerbogha to propose  that the quarrel between the two religions should be decided by a  chosen number of the bravest soldiers of each army. Kerbogha turned  from him with a look of contempt, and said he could agree to no  proposals from a set of such miserable beggars and robbers. With this  uncourteous answer Peter returned to Antioch. Preparations were  immediately commenced for an attack upon the enemy: the latter  continued to be perfectly well informed of all the proceedings of the  Christian camp. The citadel of Antioch, which remained in their  possession, overlooked the town, and the commander of the fortress  could distinctly see all that was passing within. On the morning of the  28th of June 1098 a black flag, hoisted from its highest tower,  announced to the besieging army that the Christians were about to sally  forth.    The Moslem leaders knew the sad inroads that famine and disease had  made upon the numbers of the foe: they knew that not above two hundred  of the knights had horses to ride upon, and that the foot soldiers were  sick and emaciated; but they did not know the almost incredible valour  which superstition had infused into their hearts.  The story of the  lance they treated with the most supreme contempt, and, secure of an  easy victory, they gave themselves no trouble in preparing for the  onslaught. It is related that Kerbogha was playing a game at chess,  when the black flag on the citadel gave warning of the enemy's  approach, and that, with true oriental coolness, he insisted upon  finishing the game ere he bestowed any of his attention upon a foe so  unworthy. The defeat of his advanced post of two thousand men aroused  him from his apathy.    The crusaders, after this first victory, advanced joyfully towards the  mountains, hoping to draw the Turks to a place where their cavalry  would be unable to manoeuvre. Their spirits were light and their  courage high, as led on by the Duke of Normandy, Count Robert of  Flanders, and Hugh of Vermandois, they came within sight of the  splendid camp of the enemy. Godfrey of Bouillon and Adhemar, Bishop of  Puy, followed immediately after these leaders, the latter clad in  complete armour, and bearing the Holy Lance within sight of the whole  army: "]]]
