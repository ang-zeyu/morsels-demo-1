Let us weigh his words, lest we interpret them by the  light of a comfortable modern piety. A great many things that are  commonly called evil may and do happen to a good man in this life,  and therefore presumably misfortunes may also overtake him in any  other life that there may be. The only evil that can never befall him  is vice, because that would be a contradiction in terms. Unless  therefore Socrates was uttering idle words on the most solemn  occasion of his life, he must be taken to have meant that there is no  evil but vice, which implies that there is no good but virtue. Thus  we are landed at once in the heart of the Stoic morality. To the  question why, if there be a providence, so many evils happen to good  men, Seneca unflinchingly replies: \"No evil can happen to a good man,  contraries do not mix.\" God has removed from the good all evil:  because he has taken from them crimes and sins, bad thoughts and  selfish designs and blind lust and grasping avarice. He has attended  well to themselves, but he cannot be expected to look after their  luggage: they relieve him of that care by being indifferent about it.  This is the only form in which the doctrine of divine providence can  be held consistently with the facts of life Again, when Socrates on  the same occasion expressed his belief that it was not \"permitted by  the divine law for a better man to be harmed by a worse\", he was  asserting by implication the Stoic position. Neither Meletus nor  Anytus could harm him, though they might have him killed or banished,  or disfranchised. This passage of the Apology, in a condensed form,  is adopted by Epictetus as one of the watchwords of Stoicism.    There is nothing more distinctive of Socrates than the doctrine that  virtue is knowledge. Here too the Stoics followed him, ignoring all  that Aristotle had done in showing the part played by the emotions  and the will in virtue. Reason was with them a principle of action;  with Aristotle it was a principle that guided action, but the motive  power had to come from elsewhere. Socrates must even be held  responsible for the Stoic paradox of the madness of all ordinary  folk.    The Stoics did not owe much to the Peripatetics. There was too much  balance about the master mind of Aristotle for their narrow  intensity. His recognition of the value of the passions was to them  an advocacy of disease in moderation: his admission of other elements  besides virtue into the conception of happiness seemed to them to be  a betrayal of the citadel, to say as he did that the exercise of  virtue was the highest good was no merit in their eyes, unless it  were added to the confession that there was none beside it. The  Stoics tried to treat man as a being of pure reason. The Peripatetics  would not shut their eyes to his mixed nature, and contended that the  good of such a being must also be mixed, containing in it elements  which had reference to the body and its environment. The goods of the  soul indeed, they said, far outweighed those of body and estate, but  still the latter had a right to be considered.    Though the Stoics were religious to the point of superstition, yet  they did not invoke the terrors of theology to enforce the lesson of  virtue. Plato does this even in the very work, the professed object  of which is to prove the _intrinsic_ superiority of justice to  injustice. But Chrysippus protested against Plato's procedure on this  point, declaring that the talk about punishment by the gods was mere  'bugaboo'. By the Stoics indeed, no less than by the Epicureans, fear  of the gods was discarded from philosophy. The Epicurean gods took no  part in the affairs of men; the Stoic God was incapable of anger.    The absence of any appeal to rewards and punishments was a natural  consequence of the central tenet of the Stoic morality: that virtue  is in itself the most desirable of all things. Another corollary that  flows with equal directness from the same principle is that is better  to be than to seem virtuous. Those who are sincerely convinced that  happiness is to be found in wealth or pleasure or power prefer the  reality to the appearance of these goods; it must be the same with  him who is sincerely convinced that happiness lies in virtue.    Despite the want of feeling in which the Stoics gloried, it is yet  true to say that the humanity of their system constitutes one of its  most just claims on our admiration. They were the first fully to  recognise the worth of man as man; they heralded the reign of peace  for which we are yet waiting; they proclaimed to the world the  fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man; they were convinced of  the solidarity of mankind, and laid down that the interest of one  must be subordinated to that of all. The word \"philanthrop,\" though  not unheard before their time, was brought into prominence by them as  a name for a virtue among the virtues.    Aristotle's ideal state, like the Republic of Plato, is still an  Hellenic city; Zeno was the first to dream of a republic which should  embrace all mankind. In Plato's Republic all the material goods are  contemptuously thrown to the lower classes, all the mental and  spiritual reserved for the higher. In Aristotle's ideal the bulk of  the population are mere conditions, not integral parts of the state.  Aristotle's callous acceptance of the existing fact of slavery  blinded his eyes to the wider outlook, which already in his time was  beginning to be taken. His theories of the natural slave and of the  natural nobility of the Greeks are mere attempts to justify practice.  In the Ethics there is indeed a recognition of the rights of man, but  it is faint and grudging. Aristotle there tells us that a slave, as a  man, admits of justice, and therefore of friendship, but  unfortunately it is not this concession which is dominant in his  system, but rather the reduction of a slave to a living tool by which  it is immediately preceded. In another passage Aristotle points out  that men, like other animals, have a natural affection for the  members of their own species, a fact, he adds, which is best seen in  travelling. This incipient humanitarianism seems to have been  developed in a much more marked way by Aristotle's followers, but it  is the Stoics who have won the glory of having initiated humanitarian  sentiment.    Virtue, with the earlier Greek philosophers, was aristocratic and  exclusive. Stoicism, like Christianity, threw it open to the meanest  of mankind. In the kingdom of wisdom, as in the kingdom of Christ,  there was neither barbarian, Scythian, bond, nor free. The only true  freedom was to serve philosophy, or, which was the same thing, to  serve God; and that could be done in any station in life. The sole  condition of communion with gods and good men was the possession of a  certain frame of mind, which might belong equally to a gentleman, to  a freedman, or to a slave. In place of the arrogant assertion of the  natural nobility of the Greeks, we now hear that a good mind is the  true nobility. Birth is of no importance; all are sprung from the  gods. \"The door of virtue is shut to no man; it is open to all,  admits all, invites all--free men, freedmen, slaves, kings and  exiles. Its election is not of family or fortune; it is content with  the bare man.\" Wherever there was a human being, there Stoicism saw a  field for well doing. Its followers were always to have in their  mouths and hearts the well-known line--     Homo sum humani nihil a me allenum puto    Closely connected with the humanitarianism of the Greeks is their  cosmopolitanism.    Cosmopolitanism is a word which has contracted rather than expanded  in meaning with the advance of time. We mean by it freedom from the  shackles of nationality. The Stoics meant this and more. The city of  which they claimed to be citizens was not merely this round world on  which we dwell, but the universe at large with all the mighty life  therein contained. In this city, the greatest of earth's  cities--Rome, Ephesus or Alexandria, were but houses. To be exiled  from one of them was only like changing your lodgings, and death but  a removal from one quarter to another. The freemen of this city were  all rational beings--sages on earth and the stars in heaven. Such an  idea was thoroughly in keeping with the soaring genius of Stoicism.  It was proclaimed by Zeno in his Republic, and after him by  Chrysippus and his followers. It caught the imagination of alien  writers as of the author of the Peripatetic _De Mundo_ who was  possibly of Jewish origin and of Philo and St Paul who were certainly  so. Cicero does not fail to make of it on behalf of the Stoics;  Seneca revels in it; Epictetus employs it for edification and Maucus  Aurelius finds solace in his heavenly citizenship for the cares of an  earthly ruler--as Antoninus indeed his city is Rome, but as a man it  is the universe.    The philosophy of an age cannot perhaps be inferred from its  political conditions with that certainty which some writers assume;  still there are cases in which the connection is obvious. On a wide  view of the matter we may say that the opening up of the East by the  arms of Alexander was the cause of the shifting of the philosophic  standpoint from Hellenism to cosmopolitanism. If we reflect that the  Cynic and Stoic teachers were mostly foreigners in Greece we shall  find a very tangible reason for the change of view. Greece had done  her work in educating the world and the world was beginning to make  payment in kind. Those who had been branded as natural slaves were  now giving laws to philosophy. The kingdom of wisdom was suffering  violence at the hands of barbarians.

This Augustus attributed to policy; and Tiberius to the  injunctions of his predecessor. [63] It is certain that Caius Caesar  [64] meditated an expedition into Britain; but his temper, precipitate  in forming schemes, and unsteady in pursuing them, together with the  ill success of his mighty attempts against Germany, rendered the design  abortive. Claudius [65] accomplished the undertaking, transporting his  legions and auxiliaries, and associating Vespasian in the direction  of affairs, which laid the foundation of his future fortune. In this  expedition, nations were subdued, kings made captive, and Vespasian was  held forth to the fates.    14. Aulus Plautius, the first consular governor, and his successor,  Ostorius Scapula, [66] were both eminent for military abilities. Under  them, the nearest part of Britain was gradually reduced into the form of  a province, and a colony of veterans [67] was settled. Certain districts  were bestowed upon king Cogidunus, a prince who continued in perfect  fidelity within our own memory. This was done agreeably to the ancient  and long established practice of the Romans, to make even kings the  instruments of servitude. Didius Gallus, the next governor, preserved  the acquisitions of his predecessors, and added a very few fortified  posts in the remoter parts, for the reputation of enlarging his  province. Veranius succeeded, but died within the year. Suetonius  Paullinus then commanded with success for two years, subduing various  nations, and establishing garrisons. In the confidence with which this  inspired him, he undertook an expedition against the island Mona, [68]  which had furnished the revolters with supplies; and thereby exposed the  settlements behind him to a surprise.    15. For the Britons, relieved from present dread by the absence of the  governor, began to hold conferences, in which they painted the miseries  of servitude, compared their several injuries, and inflamed each other  with such representations as these: \"That the only effects of their  patience were more grievous impositions upon a people who submitted with  such facility. Formerly they had one king respectively; now two were set  over them, the lieutenant and the procurator, the former of whom vented  his rage upon their life's blood, the latter upon their properties; [69]  the union or discord [70] of these governors was equally fatal to those  whom they ruled, while the officers of the one, and the centurions  of the other, joined in oppressing them by all kinds of violence and  contumely; so that nothing was exempted from their avarice, nothing from  their lust. In battle it was the bravest who took spoils; but those whom  _they_ suffered to seize their houses, force away their children, and  exact levies, were, for the most part, the cowardly and effeminate; as  if the only lesson of suffering of which they were ignorant was how  to die for their country. Yet how inconsiderable would the number of  invaders appear did the Britons but compute their own forces! From  considerations like these, Germany had thrown off the yoke, [71] though  a river [72] and not the ocean was its barrier. The welfare of their  country, their wives, and their parents called them to arms, while  avarice and luxury alone incited their enemies; who would withdraw as  even the deified Julius had done, if the present race of Britons would  emulate the valor of their ancestors, and not be dismayed at the event  of the first or second engagement. Superior spirit and perseverence were  always the share of the wretched; and the gods themselves now seemed to  compassionate the Britons, by ordaining the absence of the general, and  the detention of his army in another island. The most difficult point,  assembling for the purpose of deliberation, was already accomplished;  and there was always more danger from the discovery of designs like  these, than from their execution.\"    16. Instigated by such suggestions, they unanimously rose in arms, led  by Boadicea, [73] a woman of royal descent (for they make no distinction  between the sexes in succession to the throne), and attacking the  soldiers dispersed through the garrisons, stormed the fortified posts,  and invaded the colony [74] itself, as the seat of slavery. They  omitted no species of cruelty with which rage and victory could  inspire barbarians; and had not Paullinus, on being acquainted with the  commotion of the province, marched speedily to its relief, Britain would  have been lost. The fortune of a single battle, however, reduced it  to its former subjection; though many still remained in arms, whom  the consciousness of revolt, and particular dread of the governor,  had driven to despair. Paullinus, although otherwise exemplary in his  administration, having treated those who surrendered with severity, and  having pursued too rigorous measures, as one who was revenging his own  personal injury also, Petronius Turpilianus [75] was sent in his stead,  as a person more inclined to lenity, and one who, being unacquainted  with the enemy's delinquency, could more easily accept their penitence.  After having restored things to their former quiet state, he delivered  the command to Trebellius Maximus. [76] Trebellius, indolent, and  inexperienced in military affairs, maintained the tranquillity of the  province by popular manners; for even the barbarians had now learned to  pardon under the seductive influence of vices; and the intervention of  the civil wars afforded a legitimate excuse for his inactivity. Sedition  however infected the soldiers, who, instead of their usual military  services, were rioting in idleness. Trebellius, after escaping the fury  of his army by flight and concealment, dishonored and abased, regained a  precarious authority; and a kind of tacit compact took place, of safety  to the general, and licentiousness to the army. This mutiny was not  attended with bloodshed. Vettius Bolanus, [77] succeeding during the  continuance of the civil wars, was unable to introduce discipline into  Britain. The same inaction towards the enemy, and the same insolence in  the camp, continued; except that Bolanus, unblemished in his character,  and not obnoxious by any crime, in some measure substituted affection in  the place of authority.    17. At length, when Vespasian received the possession of Britain  together with the rest of the world, the great commanders and  well-appointed armies which were sent over abated the confidence of  the enemy; and Petilius Cerealis struck terror by an attack upon the  Brigantes, [78] who are reputed to compose the most populous state in  the whole province. Many battles were fought, some of them attended  with much bloodshed; and the greater part of the Brigantes were either  brought into subjection, or involved in the ravages of war. The conduct  and reputation of Cerealis were so brilliant that they might have  eclipsed the splendor of a successor; yet Julius Frontinus, [79] a truly  great man, supported the arduous competition, as far as circumstances  would permit. [80] He subdued the strong and warlike nation of the  Silures, [81] in which expedition, besides the valor of the enemy, he  had the difficulties of the country to struggle with.    18. Such was the state of Britain, and such had been the vicissitudes of  warfare, when Agricola arrived in the middle of summer; [82] at a time  when the Roman soldiers, supposing the expeditions of the year were  concluded, were thinking of enjoying themselves without care, and the  natives, of seizing the opportunity thus afforded them. Not long before  his arrival, the Ordovices [83] had cut off almost an entire corps  of cavalry stationed on their frontiers; and the inhabitants of  the province being thrown into a state of anxious suspense by this  beginning, inasmuch as war was what they wished for, either approved of  the example, or waited to discover the disposition of the new governor.  [84] The season was now far advanced, the troops dispersed through  the country, and possessed with the idea of being suffered to remain  inactive during the rest of the year; circumstances which tended to  retard and discourage any military enterprise; so that it was generally  thought most advisable to be contented with defending the suspected  posts: yet Agricola determined to march out and meet the approaching  danger. For this purpose, he drew together the detachments from the  legions, [85] and a small body of auxiliaries; and when he perceived  that the Ordovices would not venture to descend into the plain, he led  an advanced party in person to the attack, in order to inspire the rest  of his troops with equal ardor. The result of the action was almost the  total extirpation of the Ordovices; when Agricola, sensible that renown  must be followed up, and that the future events of the war would be  determined by the first success, resolved to make an attempt upon the  island Mona, from the occupation of which Paullinus had been summoned  by the general rebellion of Britain, as before related. [86] The  usual deficiency of an unforeseen expedition appearing in the want  of transport vessels, the ability and resolution of the general  were exerted to supply this defect. A select body of auxiliaries,  disencumbered of their baggage, who were well acquainted with the fords,  and accustomed, after the manner of their country, to direct their  horses and manage their arms while swimming, [87] were ordered suddenly  to plunge into the channel; by which movement, the enemy, who expected  the arrival of a fleet, and a formal invasion by sea, were struck with  terror and astonishment, conceiving nothing arduous or insuperable to  troops who thus advanced to the attack. They were therefore induced to  sue for peace, and make a surrender of the island; an event which threw  lustre on the name of Agricola, who, on the very entrance upon his  province, had employed in"]]]
