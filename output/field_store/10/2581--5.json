A thousand times better that Leonard  should have been killed, than that he should drag out his existence in  such utter misery as that which he has described as being the lot of  prisoners in the dungeons of Bomba. The brigands may have been set on by  their government. That is possible--I can believe that iniquitous  government to be guilty of anything--but whether Leonard was attacked  merely for plunder, or for ransom, or by the connivance of the  government, I cannot and will not doubt that he is dead; the story of  one of the band can leave no doubt of this, and it is confirmed by his  servant, who saw him fall. Never try to shake my confidence in that,  mother. It was almost more than I could bear to think of my father as  confined in one of those dungeons; if I thought for a moment that  Leonard could be there too, I believe that I should lose my reason.\"    Frank returned to school after the short holidays. His mother thought  that it would be better so, as the routine of work and play would give  him little time for moping over his loss. He worked harder than he had  ever done at school before; but obtained leave off cricket, and spent  his time out of school in long walks with one or other of his chums.  After the summer holiday he was himself again. He was quieter than he  had been, and held aloof from fun and mischief, but joined in the sports  vigorously, and regained the ground he had lost, and came to be regarded  as likely some day to be one of the representatives of the school.    When it seemed that the search for the body of Captain Percival had  failed, Mrs. Percival wrote to the secretary of the legation in Naples,  saying that she would be glad if her husband's courier would come over  to see her.    \"I naturally wish to know,\" she said, \"as much as I can of the last  movements of my husband from the only person who was with him; and I  would willingly bear the expenses of his journey both ways, and pay him  fifty pounds. I did not receive any letter from my husband during the  fortnight preceding his death, and want to learn as much as possible  about him.\"    The secretary, on receiving the letter, sent the note to the chief of  the police, in whose charge the man had been while the investigations  were proceeding; an answer was returned saying that the man Beppo  Paracini was not now in his charge, but that perhaps he could find him  in the course of a few hours, and would, on doing so, send him to the  legation at once.    Instead of seeing the man himself, however, the officer went to the  director of the secret police. \"As this affair has been in your  department rather than in mine, signor, I thought it best to bring you  this note I have just received from the British legation before taking  any steps in the matter.\"    The official read the note through. \"You have done quite right,\" he  said. \"The affair has been a very troublesome one, and now that it has  practically come to an end, it would not do to take any false step in  the matter. You shall hear from me in the course of the day.\"    He sat thinking deeply for some minutes after the other had left him,  then he touched a bell.    \"Luigi,\" he said, when a man entered, \"go and fetch Beppo Paracini; if  he is not in, find where he has gone and follow him.\"    Half an hour later the courier entered. When before the court he had  been dressed in the fashion affected by his class; now he was in dark,  quiet clothes, and might have been taken for an advocate or notary.    \"Beppo,\" he said, \"I thought that we had finished with that troublesome  affair of the Englishman; but there is again occasion for your services  in the same direction. Here is a letter from the secretary of the  British legation saying that he wishes to see you, for that the Signora  Percival has written to him to say that she is anxious to learn more of  the last days of her husband, and is willing to pay your expenses to  England and to give you fifty pounds for your services, if you would be  willing to go to her for a few days. I regard this as a fortunate  circumstance. The woman's husband and her father have been constant  enemies of the kingdom. Percival was a bosom friend of Garibaldi; her  father was also his friend, though not to the same degree. Ever since  they established themselves in England his family, who are unfortunately  rich, have befriended Italian exiles.    \"Forli was acquainted with all his compatriots in London, who, like  himself, were men of education and position, and had escaped from  justice. In that house any plot that was on foot, especially if  Garibaldi was a leading spirit in it, would certainly be known. No doubt  the loss of her husband will make this woman more inveterate against us  than ever. I have often wished that I could establish an agent in her  house, to keep me informed of what was going on there, who visited it,  whether any meetings and consultations were held there, from whom they  received letters, and the purport of them, but I have never before seen  my way to it. The woman Forli is herself English, and consequently since  her husband's death no Italian servants have been kept in the house.  This letter gives me the opportunity I have desired. I wish you to go to  the British legation, and to express your willingness to accept the  offer that is made, and if possible to obtain a situation in the house.    \"You could represent that you were anxious to obtain a place of any kind  in England, for that, owing to the part that you have taken in the  search for Percival's body--a search which brought about the death of  the brigand Rapini and the breaking up of his band--your life was no  longer safe there from the vengeance of his associates. You can say that  before you became a courier you were in the service of several noble  families--of course you will be provided with excellent  testimonials--and as it was your zeal in her late husband's behalf that  had brought you into this strait, it is quite possible that she may  offer you a post in the household. You can declare that you do not  desire high wages, but simply a shelter. You will, of course, report  yourself on arriving in London to the head of our secret agents there,  and will act generally under his directions. I need not say that you  will be well paid.\"    \"I will gladly accept the mission, signor, for, to say the truth, I am  not without some apprehensions such as you suggest. I have changed my  appearance a good deal; still, I cannot flatter myself that I could not  be detected by any one on the search for me, and I do think that some of  Rapini's band, knowing that I was with the carabinieri, may have vowed  vengeance on me; and, as you know, signor, a man so threatened cannot  calculate on a very long life.\"    \"That is so, Beppo. Then we may consider the matter settled. If you  cannot succeed in obtaining a position in the house of this family, I  shall instruct my agent in London to utilise your services there, at any  rate for the next six months. After that time you may return without  much risk, for when it is found that you have disappeared from all your  former haunts, the search for you is not likely to last long. At any  rate, you might as well mention to those who have known you as a  courier, that you intend to establish yourself either in Paris or  Berlin. For as you speak both French and German as well as English, that  would in any case be the course that a prudent man would adopt, after  being mixed up in an affair that ended badly for the brigands. Well, in  the first place, you had better go at once to the legation and accept  their terms. Come here at eleven o'clock to-morrow, and I will give you  further instructions.\"    Thus it happened that when Frank came home next time from school, he was  surprised at having the door opened to him by a grave-looking servant in  plain clothes, who said in English, with a very slight foreign accent:  \"The Signora Percival is in the drawing-room, sir. I will see to your  baggage and settle with the cabman.\"    \"Whom have you got hold of now, mother?\" he said, after the first  greeting--\"an Italian? Isn't he a fearfully respectable-looking man?  Looks like a clergyman got up as a valet.\"    \"He was your dear father's courier, Frank. I sent for him to come over  here, as I wished to learn all about your father's last days. The poor  fellow was in fear of his life, owing to the evidence that he had given  against the brigands. William had given me notice that he was going to  leave only the day before; and as Beppo had served in several noble  families, who had given him splendid testimonials, and was afraid to  return to Italy, I was very glad to take him in William's place,  especially as he only asked the same wages I paid before. I congratulate  myself on the change, for he is quite the beau-ideal of a servant--very  quiet in the house, ready to do anything, gets on well with the other  servants, and is able to talk in their own language to any of his  countrymen who come here, either as visitors or as exiles in need of  assistance. He has, indeed, saved me more than once from impostors; he  has listened to their stories, and having been a courier, and knowing  every town in Italy, on questioning them he found out that their whole  story was a lie.\"    \"That is all right, mother; if you like him, that is everything. I own  that I liked William; I am sorry that he has gone. I shall be some time  getting accustomed to this chap, for he certainly is fearfully grave and  respectable.\"          CHAPTER IV.    A SUDDEN SUMMONS.      One Saturday early in March, 1860, Frank, now sixteen years of age, on  starting for the football ground, was told that the house-master wished  to see him, and he at once went into his study.    \"Percival, I have received a note from your mother, asking me to let you  out till Monday morning. She says "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4558"],[0,"Barry Lyndon (#10)"],[1,"resenting the affront. Fight you must; and Quin is a huge strong  fellow.'    'He'll give the better mark,' said I. 'I am not afraid of him.'    'In faith,' said the Captain,' I believe you are not; for a lad, I never  saw more game in my life.'    'Look at that sword, sir,' says I, pointing to an elegant silver-mounted  one, in a white shagreen case, that hung on the mantelpiece, under the  picture of my father, Harry Barry. 'It was with that sword, sir, that my  father pinked Mohawk O'Driscol, in Dublin, in the year 1740; with that  sword, sir, he met Sir Huddlestone Fuddlestone, the Hampshire baronet,  and ran him through the neck. They met on horseback, with sword and  pistol, on Hounslow Heath, as I dare say you have heard tell of, and  those are the pistols' (they hung on each side of the picture) 'which  the gallant Barry used. He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady  Fuddlestone, when in liquor, at the Brentford assembly. But, like a  gentleman, he scorned to apologise, and Sir Huddlestone received a ball  through his hat, before they engaged with the sword. I am Harry Barry's  son, sir, and will act as becomes my name and my quality.'    'Give me a kiss, my dear boy,' said Fagan, with tears in his eyes.  'You're after my own soul. As long as Jack Fagan lives you shall never  want a friend or a second.'    Poor fellow! he was shot six months afterwards, carrying orders to my  Lord George Sackville, at Minden, and I lost thereby a kind friend. But  we don't know what is in store for us, and that night was a merry one  at least. We had a second bottle, and a third too (I could hear the poor  mother going downstairs for each, but she never came into the parlour  with them, and sent them in by the butler, Mr. Tim): and we parted  at length, he engaging to arrange matters with Mr. Quin's second that  night, and to bring me news in the morning as to the place where the  meeting should take place. I have often thought since, how different my  fate might have been, had I not fallen in love with Nora at that early  age; and had I not flung the wine in Quin's face, and so brought on  the duel. I might have settled down in Ireland but for that (for Miss  Quinlan was an heiress, within twenty miles of us, and Peter Burke,  of Kilwangan, left his daughter Judy L700 a year, and I might have had  either of them, had I waited a few years). But it was in my fate to be  a wanderer, and that battle with Quin sent me on my travels at a very  early age: as you shall hear anon.    I never slept sounder in my life, though I woke a little earlier than  usual; and you may be sure my first thought was of the event of the day,  for which I was fully prepared. I had ink and pen in my room--had I not  been writing those verses to Nora but the day previous, like a poor fond  fool as I was? And now I sat down and wrote a couple of letters more:  they might be the last, thought I, that I ever should write in my life.  The first was to my mother:--    'Honoured Madam'--I wrote--'This will not be given you unless I fall by  the hand of Captain Quin, whom I meet this day in the field of honour,  with sword and pistol. If I die, it is as a good Christian and a  gentleman,--how should I be otherwise when educated by such a mother as  you? I forgive all my enemies--I beg your blessing as a dutiful son.  I desire that my mare Nora, which my uncle gave me, and which I called  after the most faithless of her sex, may be returned to Castle Brady,  and beg you will give my silver-hiked hanger to Phil Purcell, the  gamekeeper. Present my duty to my uncle and Ulick, and all the girls of  MY party there. And I remain your dutiful son,    'REDMOND BARRY.'    To Nora I wrote:--    'This letter will be found in my bosom along with the token you gave me.  It will be dyed in my blood (unless I have Captain Quin's, whom I  hate, but forgive), and will be a pretty ornament for you on your  marriage-day. Wear it, and think of the poor boy to whom you gave it,  and who died (as he was always ready to do) for your sake.    'REDMOND.'    These letters being written, and sealed with my father's great silver  seal of the Barry arms, I went down to breakfast; where my mother was  waiting for me, you may be sure. We did not say a single word about what  was taking place: on the contrary, we talked of anything but that; about  who was at church the day before, and about my wanting new clothes now  I was grown so tall. She said I must have a suit against winter,  if--if--she could afford it. She winced rather at the 'if,' Heaven bless  her! I knew what was in her mind. And then she fell to telling me about  the black pig that must be killed, and that she had found the speckled  hen's nest that morning, whose eggs I liked so, and other such trifling  talk. Some of these eggs were for breakfast, and I ate them with a  good appetite; but in helping myself to salt I spilled it, on which she  started up with a scream. 'THANK GOD,' said she, 'IT'S FALLEN TOWARDS  ME.' And then, her heart being too full, she left the room. Ah! they  have their faults, those mothers; but are there any other women like  them?    When she was gone I went to take down the sword with which my father had  vanquished the Hampshire baronet, and, would you believe it?--the brave  woman had tied A NEW RIBAND to the hilt: for indeed she had the courage  of a lioness and a Brady united. And then I took down the pistols, which  were always kept bright and well oiled, and put some fresh flints I  had into the locks, and got balls and powder ready against the Captain  should come. There was claret and a cold fowl put ready for him on the  sideboard, and a case-bottle of old brandy too, with a couple of little  glasses on the silver tray with the Barry arms emblazoned. In after  life, and in the midst of my fortune and splendour, I paid thirty-five  guineas, and almost as much more interest, to the London goldsmith who  supplied my father with that very tray. A scoundrel pawnbroker would  only give me sixteen for it afterwards; so little can we trust the  honour of rascally tradesmen!    At eleven o'clock Captain Fagan arrived, on horseback, with a mounted  dragoon after him. He paid his compliments to the collation which my  mother's care had provided for him, and then said, 'Look ye, Redmond my  boy; this is a silly business. The girl will marry Quin, mark my words;  and as sure as she does you'll forget her. You are but a boy. Quin is  willing to consider you as such. Dublin's a fine place, and if you have  a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are  twenty guineas at your service. Make Quin an apology, and be off.'    'A man of honour, Mr. Fagan,' says I, 'dies, but never apologises. I'll  see the Captain hanged before I apologise.'    'Then there's nothing for it but a meeting.'    'My mare is saddled and ready,' says I; 'where's the meeting, and who's  the Captain's second?'    'Your cousins go out with him,' answered Mr. Fagan.    'I'll ring for my groom to bring my mare round,' I said, 'as soon as you  have rested yourself.' Tim was accordingly despatched for Nora, and I  rode away, but I didn't take leave of Mrs. Barry. The curtains of  her bedroom windows were down, and they didn't move as we mounted and  trotted off... BUT TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS, you should have seen her as she  came tottering downstairs, and heard the scream which she gave as she  hugged her boy to her heart, quite unharmed and without a wound in his  body.    What had taken place I may as well tell here. When we got to the ground,  Ulick, Mick, and the Captain were already there: Quin, flaming in red  regimentals, as big a monster as ever led a grenadier company. The party  were laughing together at some joke of one or the other: and I must say  I thought this laughter very unbecoming in my cousins, who were met,  perhaps, to see the death of one of their kindred.    'I hope to spoil this sport,' says I to Captain Fagan, in a great rage,  'and trust to see this sword of mine in yonder big bully's body.'    'Oh! it's with pistols we fight,' replied Mr. Fagan. 'You are no match  for Quin with the sword.'    'I'll match any man with the sword,' said I.    'But swords are to-day impossible; Captain Quin is--is lame. He knocked  his knee against the swinging park-gate last night, as he was riding  home, and can scarce move it now.'    'Not against Castle Brady gate,' says I: 'that has been off the hinges  these ten years.' On which Fagan said it must have been some other  gate, and repeated what he had said to Mr. Quin and my cousins, when, on  alighting from our horses, we joined and saluted those gentlemen.    'Oh yes! dead lame,' said Ulick, coming to shake me by the hand, while  Captain Quin took off his hat and turned extremely red. 'And very lucky  for you, Redmond my boy,' continued Ulick; 'you were a dead man else;  for he is a devil of a fellow--isn't he, Fagan?'    'A regular Turk,' answered Fagan; adding, 'I never yet knew the man who  stood to Captain Quin.'    'Hang the business!' said Ulick; 'I hate it. I'm ashamed of it. Say  you're sorry, Redmond: you can easily say that.'    'If the young FELLER will go to DUBLING, as proposed'--here interposed  Mr. Quin.    'I am NOT sorry--I'll NOT apologise--and I'll as soon go to DUBLING as  to--!' said I, with a stamp of my foot.    'There's nothing else for it,' said Ulick with a laugh to Fagan. 'Take  your ground, Fagan,--twelve paces, I suppose?'    'Ten, sir,' said Mr. Quin, in a big voice; 'and make them short ones, do  you hear, Captain Fagan?'    'Don't bully, Mr. Quin,' said Ulick surlily; 'here are the pistols.' And  he added, with some emotion, to me, 'God bless you, my boy; and when I  count three, fire.'    Mr. Fagan put my pistol into my hand,--that is, not one of mine (which  were to serve, if need were, for the next round), but one of Ulick's.  'They are all right,' said he. 'Never fear: and, Redmond, fire at his  neck-"]]]
