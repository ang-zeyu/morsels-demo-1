CHAPTER IX.    OUR LODGINGS--WANTS SUPPLIED BY LIBERALITY OF SAINTS--JOURNEY  TO LIVERPOOL--CONTRAST BETWEEN ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE--RETURN  VOYAGE--MEETING WITH ELDERS AND SAINTS AT NEW YORK--ARRIVAL AT KIRTLAND.    During our stay in Preston, we made our home at the house of Sister  Dawson, in Pole Street. We purchased our provisions, and she cooked  them for us, which is quite customary in that country. For our room,  lodging and cooking and a good coal fire, we each paid the sum of two  shillings sterling per week, which is but little more than half the  usual charge. Sister Dawson was very kind to us. Indeed the hearts  of all the Saints were open to liberality, and according to their  circumstances they contributed liberally of their substance, and many  blessings of a temporal nature we received from them, for which I pray  that my Heavenly Father may reward them a hundred fold in this world,  and in the world to come with life everlasting.    During the time we labored in England, we made no public contributions  except for the poor. When we were about taking our departure, the  Church, knowing that we had no means to carry us to our native  land, with a liberality characteristic of them, contributed to our  necessities and provided us with means to take us as far as Kirtland,  Ohio. The next day, being the ninth of April, we engaged our passage  to Liverpool in a coach, which was to start at twelve o'clock the  same day. At the time appointed we were at the place of starting, and  were soon surrounded with the brethren, who felt determined to see us  leave, many of whose countenances clearly showed their sorrow at our  departure. However, we had to bid them farewell, and were soon out of  sight. Their eyes followed us as long as they could see us.    Notwithstanding the variegated scenery of the country, which in  England is very beautiful, my mind reverted back to the time when I  first arrived in that country, and the peculiar feelings I had when  I traveled from Liverpool to Preston some months before. Then I was  a stranger in a strange land, and had nothing to rely upon but the  kindness and mercy of that God who had sent me there. While I mused  on these things my soul was humbled within me, and I had to exclaim,  \"Surely this is the Lord's doings, and marvelous in my eyes!\" for then  I had hundreds of brethren to whom I was united in bonds the most  endearing and sacred, and who loved me as their own souls, and whose  prayers would be continually offered up for my welfare and prosperity.    After a ride of about four hours, we arrived at Liverpool and  ascertained that the ship in which we intended to sail would not leave  that port as early as we expected, in consequence of a great storm  which had taken place, in which several vessels had been wrecked and  a number of lives lost. We took lodgings a few days until the vessels  should depart.    While in Liverpool, we were waited upon by Elders Fielding and  Richards, who, feeling desirous to obtain all the information they  could procure respecting the government of the church, thought that it  would be a favorable time to do so, as our opportunities of instruction  had been but limited while in Preston, and it being almost impossible  to have much private intercourse, there being so many who wished to  converse with us on the subject of the gospel, etc. But in this thing  they were disappointed, for as soon as it was known in Preston and  regions round about that our departure was delayed, numbers of the  brethren came from thence to visit us in Liverpool before we left their  shores.    On the 20th, we went on board the ship _Garrick_ (the same ship in  which we came), bound for New York, and the same day got under way.  Soon after we left Liverpool a great storm came on, with a head  wind, and continued without cessation for several days, which did  considerable damage to the vessel. The bowsprit was broken twice by the  force of the wind with only the gib sail set. The boom likewise came  down with great force near the place where the captain was standing,  but he fortunately escaped without injury. Several other parts of the  rigging were much torn and injured. During the time the storm lasted,  Brothers Hyde and Russell were very sick. After this we had more  favorable weather.    When we had been on the water two weeks, I asked permission of the  captain for one of us to preach, which request was cheerfully complied  with, and the second cabin was prepared for the occasion. Brother  Russell preached, after which Brother Hyde made some observations. The  discourses were listened to with great attention, and the congregation  appeared very much satisfied.    The Lord gave us favor in the eyes of the captain and the passengers,  who treated us with respect and kindness. Those who were in the same  cabin with ourselves, and with whom we had more frequent opportunities  of conversing, treated us like brothers, and took pleasure in  administering to our wants, and told us if they had anything we needed  it was at our service. I hardly ever remembered traveling with more  agreeable or kind-hearted people, and I pray that the Lord may bless  them abundantly and reward them a hundred fold for all the kindness  shown to His servants.    Nothing very particular occurred during the remainder of the passage.  The weather for the most part was favorable. On the twelfth day of  May we came in sight of New York, and in the evening we secured a  landing, after a passage of twenty-two and one-half days. The ship _New  England_, which left Liverpool on the same day we did, came in about  one hour afterwards.    The sight of my native land filled my soul with gladness. We then  went into the city with several of the passengers, who purchased some  refreshments, and after we returned bade us partake with them, and we  rejoiced together. We then bowed before the Lord and offered up the  gratitude of our hearts for all His mercies, in prospering us in our  mission and bringing us safely across the mighty deep, to behold once  more the land of our nativity, and the prospect of soon embracing our  families and friends.    The next morning we went in search of Brother Fordham, whom we found  after some trouble. He was rejoiced to see us and immediately took us  to the house of Brother Mace, where we were glad to see our beloved  Brother Orson Pratt, who was then laboring in that city, and who  with Elder Parley P. Pratt, his brother, had been instrumental in  bringing many into the kingdom in that city, which intelligence gave us  great joy, for when we left New York for England, there was only one  belonging to the church in that city.    It being Sunday, we accompanied the Brothers Pratt to the house where  the Saints were accustomed to assemble for worship. On entering the  house we found about eighty persons assembled, all of whom had recently  joined the Church. After singing and prayer, I was requested to give  an account of our mission to England. I accordingly arose and told  them the things which had happened to us since our departure, and the  great and glorious work which our Heavenly Father had commenced on the  islands of the sea, and the great desire of the English to hear the  things which the Lord had brought to pass on this continent, and their  ready reception of the truth of the gospel.    The information gave great joy to the Saints, and they united with  us in praising the name of the Lord for His wonderful works for the  children of men.    In the evening Elders Russell and Hyde preached, and a great effect was  produced, and some came forward and offered themselves as candidates  for baptism.    The short time we were in New York was spent very agreeably with the  Saints, who were indeed a kind and affectionate people. The next day  we bade adieu to the brethren and commenced our journey to Kirtland by  steamboat and railroad, and arrived there on the twenty-second day of  May, A. D 1838, having been absent eleven months and nine days.        CHAPTER X.    REMOVAL TO MISSOURI--SICKNESS--KINDNESS OF THE SAINTS AT FAR  WEST--BUILD A HOUSE, AND THEN HAVE TO ABANDON IT--BATTLE OF CROOKED  RIVER--DEATH AND FINAL TESTIMONY OF APOSTLE DAVID W. PATTEN--CORNER  STONE OF TEMPLE AT FAR WEST LAID--REMOVAL TO ILLINOIS.    I found my family in good health, and as comfortably situated as I  could expect; and our joy was mutual. The Saints in Kirtland also  received us with joy and welcomed us home.    But my journey was not yet ended. Soon after my arrival in Kirtland,  I had to make preparation to move to the State of Missouri, where the  greater part of the Church had already gone. One great cause of their  removal to the west, was the persecutions to which they were subject  in Kirtland. The brethren who yet resided there, although very kind  and affectionate, were weak in the faith in consequence of trials and  temptations. This caused us to grieve exceedingly, and we resolved to  cheer them up as much as we possibly could.    Being solicited to preach in the house or the Lord, we did so, and  after preaching a few times, and recounting our travels and the great  success which had attended our labors, and also the marvelous work  which the Lord had commenced and was still carrying on in the old  country, they began to take courage, their confidence increased, and  their faith was strengthened, and they again realized the blessings of  Jehovah.    As soon as our circumstances would permit, we commenced our journey to  the State of Missouri, by water, a distance of nearly eighteen hundred  miles. After enduring considerable fatigue, we arrived safely at Far  West, on the 25th of July. We had the pleasure of beholding the faces  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4763"],[0,"The Game of Logic (#10)"],[1,"                             |       |       |                             |    ---|---    |                             |   | 0 | 0 |   |   12.

We had better take \"persons\" as Universe.  We  may choose \"myself\" as 'Middle Term', in which case  the Premisses will take the form      I am a-person-who-sent-him-to-bring-a-kitten;    I am a-person-to-whom-he-brought-a-kettle-by-mistake.    Or we may choose \"he\" as 'Middle Term', in which case the Premisses  will take the form      He is a-person-whom-I-sent-to-bring-me-a-kitten;    He is a-person-who-brought-me-a-kettle-by-mistake.    The latter form seems best, as the interest of the anecdote clearly  depends on HIS stupidity--not on what happened to ME.  Let us then  make m = \"he\"; x = \"persons whom I sent, &c.\"; and y = \"persons  who brought, &c.\"      Hence, All m are x;           All m are y.    and the required Diagram is                            ---------------                       |       |       |                       |    ---|---    |                       |   | 1 | 0 |   |                       |---|---|---|---|                       |   | 0 | 0 |   |                       |    ---|---    |                       |       |       |                        ---------------          7.
