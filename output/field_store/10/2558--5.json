But imagine these two  feelings as INELASTIC and unvarying elements in a really living man,  make him oscillate from one to the other; above all, arrange that this  oscillation becomes entirely mechanical by adopting the well-known form  of some habitual, simple, childish contrivance: then you will get the  image we have so far found in all laughable objects, SOMETHING  MECHANICAL IN SOMETHING LIVING; in fact, something comic.    We have dwelt on this first image, the Jack-in-the-box, sufficiently to  show how comic fancy gradually converts a material mechanism into a  moral one. Now we will consider one or two other games, confining  ourselves to their most striking aspects.    2. THE DANCING-JACK.--There are innumerable comedies in which one of  the characters thinks he is speaking and acting freely, and,  consequently, retains all the essentials of life, whereas, viewed from  a certain standpoint, he appears as a mere toy in the hands of another  who is playing with him. The transition is easily made, from the  dancing-jack which a child works with a string, to Geronte and Argante  manipulated by Scapin. Listen to Scapin himself: \"The MACHINE is all  there\"; and again: \"Providence has brought them into my net,\" etc.  Instinctively, and because one would rather be a cheat than be cheated,  in imagination at all events, the spectator sides with the knaves; and  for the rest of the time, like a child who has persuaded his playmate  to lend him his doll, he takes hold of the strings himself and makes  the marionette come and go on the stage as he pleases. But this latter  condition is not indispensable; we can remain outside the pale of what  is taking place if only we retain the distinct impression of a  mechanical arrangement. This is what happens whenever one of the  characters vacillates between two contrary opinions, each in turn  appealing to him, as when Panurge asks Tom, Dick, and Harry whether or  no he ought to get married. Note that, in such a case, a comic author  is always careful to PERSONIFY the two opposing decisions. For, if  there is no spectator, there must at all events be actors to hold the  strings.    All that is serious in life comes from our freedom. The feelings we  have matured, the passions we have brooded over, the actions we have  weighed, decided upon, and carried through, in short, all that comes  from us and is our very own, these are the things that give life its  ofttimes dramatic and generally grave aspect. What, then, is requisite  to transform all this into a comedy? Merely to fancy that our seeming,  freedom conceals the strings of a dancing-Jack, and that we are, as the  poet says,    ... humble marionettes The wires of which are pulled by Fate.  [Footnote: ... d'humbles marionnettes Dont le fil est aux mains de la  Necessite. SULLY-PRUDHOMME.]    So there is not a real, a serious, or even a dramatic scene that fancy  cannot render comic by simply calling forth this image. Nor is there a  game for which a wider field lies open.    3. THE SNOW-BALL.--The farther we proceed in this investigation into  the methods of comedy, the more clearly we see the part played by  childhood's memories. These memories refer, perhaps, less to any  special game than to the mechanical device of which that game is a  particular instance. The same general device, moreover, may be met with  in widely different games, just as the same operatic air is found in  many different arrangements and variations. What is here of importance  and is retained in the mind, what passes by imperceptible stages from  the games of a child to those of a man, is the mental diagram, the  skeleton outline of the combination, or, if you like, the abstract  formula of which these games are particular illustrations. Take, for  instance, the rolling snow-ball, which increases in size as it moves  along. We might just as well think of toy soldiers standing behind one  another. Push the first and it tumbles down on the second, this latter  knocks down the third, and the state of things goes from bad to worse  until they all lie prone on the floor. Or again, take a house of cards  that has been built up with infinite care: the first you touch seems  uncertain whether to move or not, its tottering neighbour comes to a  quicker decision, and the work of destruction, gathering momentum as it  goes on, rushes headlong to the final collapse.    These instances are all different, but they suggest the same abstract  vision, that of an effect which grows by arithmetical progression, so  that the cause, insignificant at the outset, culminates by a necessary  evolution in a result as important as it is unexpected. Now let us open  a children's picture-book; we shall find this arrangement already on  the high road to becoming comic. Here, for instance--in one of the  comic chap-books picked up by chance--we have a caller rushing  violently into a drawing-room; he knocks against a lady, who upsets her  cup of tea over an old gentleman, who slips against a glass window  which falls in the street on to the head of a constable, who sets the  whole police force agog, etc. The same arrangement reappears in many a  picture intended for grownup persons. In the \"stories without words\"  sketched by humorous artists we are often shown an object which moves  from place to place, and persons who are closely connected with it, so  that through a series of scenes a change in the position of the object  mechanically brings about increasingly serious changes in the situation  of the persons. Let us now turn to comedy. Many a droll scene, many a  comedy even, may be referred to this simple type. Read the speech of  Chicanneau in the Plaideurs: here we find lawsuits within lawsuits, and  the mechanism works faster and faster--Racine produces in us this  feeling of increasing acceleration by crowding his law terms ever  closer together--until the lawsuit over a truss of hay costs the  plaintiff the best part of his fortune. And again the same arrangement  occurs in certain scenes of Don Quixote; for instance, in the inn  scene, where, by an extraordinary concatenation of circumstances, the  mule-driver strikes Sancho, who belabours Maritornes, upon whom the  innkeeper falls, etc. Finally, let us pass to the light comedy of  to-day. Need we call to mind all the forms in which this same  combination appears? There is one that is employed rather frequently.  For instance, a certain thing, say a letter, happens to be of supreme  importance to a certain person and must be recovered at all costs. This  thing, which always vanishes just when you think you have caught it,  pervades the entire play, \"rolling up\" increasingly serious and  unexpected incidents as it proceeds. All this is far more like a  child's game than appears at first blush. Once more the effect produced  is that of the snowball.    It is the characteristic of a mechanical combination to be generally  REVERSIBLE. A child is delighted when he sees the ball in a game of  ninepins knocking down everything in its way and spreading havoc in all  directions; he laughs louder than ever when the ball returns to its  starting-point after twists and turns and waverings of every kind. In  other words, the mechanism just described is laughable even when  rectilinear, it is much more so on becoming circular and when every  effort the player makes, by a fatal interaction of cause and effect,  merely results in bringing it back to the same spot. Now, a  considerable number of light comedies revolve round this idea. An  Italian straw hat has been eaten up by a horse. [Footnote: Un Chapeau  de paille d'Italie (Labiche).] There is only one other hat like it in  the whole of Paris; it MUST be secured regardless of cost. This hat,  which always slips away at the moment its capture seems inevitable,  keeps the principal character on the run, and through him all the  others who hang, so to say, on to his coat tails, like a magnet which,  by a successive series of attractions, draws along in its train the  grains of iron filings that hang on to each other. And when at last,  after all sorts of difficulties, the goal seems in sight, it is found  that the hat so ardently sought is precisely the one that has been  eaten. The same voyage of discovery is depicted in another equally  well-known comedy of Labiche. [Footnote: La Cagnotte.] The curtain  rises on an old bachelor and an old maid, acquaintances of long  standing, at the moment of enjoying their daily rubber. Each of them,  unknown to the other, has applied to the same matrimonial agency.  Through innumerable difficulties, one mishap following on the heels of  another, they hurry along, side by side, right through the play, to the  interview which brings them back, purely and simply, into each other's  presence. We have the same circular effect, the same return to the  starting-point, in a more recent play. [Footnote: Les Surprises du  divorce.] A henpecked husband imagines he has escaped by divorce from  the clutches of his wife and his mother-in-law. He marries again, when,  lo and behold, the double combination of marriage and divorce brings  back to him his former wife in the aggravated form of a second  mother-in-law!    When we think how intense and how common is this type of the comic, we  understand why it has fascinated the imagination of certain  philosophers. To cover a good deal of ground only to come back  unwittingly to the starting-point, is to make a great effort for a  result that is nil. So we might be tempted to define the comic in this  latter fashion. And such, indeed, seems to be the idea of Herbert  Spencer: according to him, laughter is the indication of an effort  which suddenly encounters a void. Kant had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4357"],[0,"American Fairy Tales (#10)"],[1,"with them for bracelets and shell necklaces and little gold  ornaments, until he had acquired quite a heap of trinkets. Then a  dozen black men climbed upon Keo's back to enjoy a ride, and the one  nearest his nose cried out:    \"Run, Mud-dog--run!\"    And Keo ran. Swift as the wind he strode, away from the village,  through the forest and straight up the river bank. The black men  howled with fear; the Jolly One roared with laughter; and on, on, on  they rushed!    Then before them, on the opposite side of the river, appeared the  black mouth of Glinkomok's cave. Keo dashed into the water, dived to  the bottom and left the black people struggling to swim out. But  Glinkomok had heard the laughter of Keo and knew what to do. When  the Jolly One rose to the surface and blew the water from his throat  there was no black man to be seen.    Keo returned alone to the village, and Gouie asked, with surprise:    \"Where are my brothers:\"    \"I do not know,\" answered Keo. \"I took them far away, and they  remained where I left them.\"    Gouie would have asked more questions then, but another crowd of  black men impatiently waited to ride on the back of the laughing  hippopotamus. So they paid the price and climbed to their seats,  after which the foremost said:    \"Run, mud-wallower--run!\"    And Keo ran as before and carried them to the mouth of Glinkomok's  cave, and returned alone.    But now Gouie became anxious to know the fate of his fellows, for he  was the only black man left in his village. So he mounted the  hippopotamus and cried:    \"Run, river-hog--run!\"    Keo laughed his jolly \"guk-uk-uk-uk!\" and ran with the speed of the  wind. But this time he made straight for the river bank where his  own tribe lived, and when he reached it he waded into the river,  dived to the bottom and left Gouie floating in the middle of the  stream.    The black man began swimming toward the right bank, but there he saw  Uncle Nep and half the royal tribe waiting to stamp him into the  soft mud. So he turned toward the left bank, and there stood the  queen mother and Uncle Nikki, red-eyed and angry, waiting to tear  him with their tusks.    Then Gouie uttered loud screams of terror, and, spying the Jolly  One, who swam near him, he cried:    \"Save me, Keo! Save me, and I will release you from slavery!\"    \"That is not enough,\" laughed Keo.    \"I will serve you all my life!\" screamed Gouie; \"I will do  everything you bid me!\"    \"Will you return to me in a year and a day and become my captive, if  I allow you to escape?\" asked Keo.    \"I will! I will! I will!\" cried Gouie.    \"Swear it by the bones of your grandfather!\" commanded Keo,  remembering that black men have no tusks to swear by.    And Gouie swore it by the bones of his grandfather.    Then Keo swam to the black one, who clambered upon his back again.  In this fashion they came to the bank, where Keo told his mother and  all the tribe of the bargain he had made with Gouie, who was to  return in a year and a day and become his slave.    Therefore the black man was permitted to depart in peace, and once  more the Jolly One lived with his own people and was happy.    When a year and a day had passed Keo began watching for the return  of Gouie; but he did not come, then or ever afterwards.    For the black man had made a bundle of his bracelets and shell  necklaces and little gold ornaments and had traveled many miles into  another country, where the ancient and royal tribe of hippopotamuses  was unknown. And he set up for a great chief, because of his riches,  and people bowed down before him.    By day he was proud and swaggering. But at night he tumbled and  tossed upon his bed and could not sleep. His conscience troubled  him.    For he had sworn by the bones of his grandfather; and his  grandfather had no bones.          THE MAGIC BON BONS      There lived in Boston a wise and ancient chemist by the name of Dr.  Daws, who dabbled somewhat in magic. There also lived in Boston a  young lady by the name of Claribel Sudds, who was possessed of much  money, little wit and an intense desire to go upon the stage.    So Claribel went to Dr. Daws and said:    \"I can neither sing nor dance; I cannot recite verse nor play upon  the piano; I am no acrobat nor leaper nor high kicker; yet I wish to  go upon the stage. What shall I do?\"    \"Are you willing to pay for such accomplishments?\" asked the wise  chemist.    \"Certainly,\" answered Claribel, jingling her purse.    \"Then come to me to-morrow at two o'clock,\" said he.    All that night he practiced what is known as chemical sorcery; so  that when Claribel Sudds came next day at two o'clock he showed her  a small box filled with compounds that closely resembled French  bonbons.    \"This is a progressive age,\" said the old man, \"and I flatter myself  your Uncle Daws keeps right along with the procession. Now, one of  your old-fashioned sorcerers would have made you some nasty, bitter  pills to swallow; but I have consulted your taste and convenience.  Here are some magic bonbons. If you eat this one with the lavender  color you can dance thereafter as lightly and gracefully as if you  had been trained a lifetime. After you consume the pink confection  you will sing like a nightingale. Eating the white one will enable  you to become the finest elocutionist in the land. The chocolate  piece will charm you into playing the piano better than Rubenstein,  while after eating you lemon-yellow bonbon you can easily kick six  feet above your head.\"    \"How delightful!\" exclaimed Claribel, who was truly enraptured. \"You  are certainly a most clever sorcerer as well as a considerate  compounder,\" and she held out her hand for the box.    \"Ahem!\" said the wise one; \"a check, please.\"    \"Oh, yes; to be sure! How stupid of me to forget it,\" she returned.    He considerately retained the box in his own hand while she signed a  check for a large amount of money, after which he allowed her to  hold the box herself.    \"Are you sure you have made them strong enough?\" she inquired,  anxiously; \"it usually takes a great deal to affect me.\"    \"My only fear,\" replied Dr. Daws, \"is that I have made them too  strong. For this is the first time I have ever been called upon to  prepare these wonderful confections.\"    \"Don't worry,\" said Claribel; \"the stronger they act the better I  shall act myself.\"    She went away, after saying this, but stopping in at a dry goods  store to shop, she forgot the precious box in her new interest and  left it lying on the ribbon counter.    Then little Bessie Bostwick came to the counter to buy a hair ribbon  and laid her parcels beside the box. When she went away she gathered  up the box with her other bundles and trotted off home with it.    Bessie never knew, until after she had hung her coat in the hall  closet and counted up her parcels, that she had one too many. Then  she opened it and exclaimed:    \"Why, it's a box of candy! Someone must have mislaid it. But it is  too small a matter to worry about; there are only a few pieces.\" So  she dumped the contents of the box into a bonbon dish that stood  upon the hall table and picking out the chocolate piece--she was  fond of chocolates--ate it daintily while she examined her purchases.    These were not many, for Bessie was only twelve years old and was  not yet trusted by her parents to expend much money at the stores.  But while she tried on the hair ribbon she suddenly felt a great  desire to play upon the piano, and the desire at last became so  overpowering that she went into the parlor and opened the  instrument.    The little girl had, with infinite pains, contrived to learn two  \"pieces\" which she usually executed with a jerky movement of her  right hand and a left hand that forgot to keep up and so made  dreadful discords. But under the influence of the chocolate bonbon  she sat down and ran her fingers lightly over the keys producing  such exquisite harmony that she was filled with amazement at her own  performance.    That was the prelude, however. The next moment she dashed into  Beethoven's seventh sonata and played it magnificently.    Her mother, hearing the unusual burst of melody, came downstairs to  see what musical guest had arrived; but when she discovered it was  her own little daughter who was playing so divinely she had an  attack of palpitation of the heart (to which she was subject) and  sat down upon a sofa until it should pass away.    Meanwhile Bessie played one piece after another with untiring  energy. She loved music, and now found that all she need do was to  sit at the piano and listen and watch her hands twinkle over the  keyboard.    Twilight deepened in the room and Bessie's father came home and hung  up his hat and overcoat and placed his umbrella in the rack. Then he  peeped into the parlor to see who was playing.    \"Great Caesar!\" he exclaimed. But the mother came to him softly with  her finger on her lips and whispered: \"Don't interrupt her, John.  Our child seems to be in a trance. Did you ever hear such superb  music?\"    \"Why, she's an infant prodigy!\" gasped the astounded father. \"Beats  Blind Tom all hollow! It's--it's wonderful!\"    As they stood listening the senator arrived, having been invited to  dine with them that evening. And before he had taken off his coat  the Yale professor--a man of deep learning and scholarly  attainments--joined the party.    Bessie played on; and the four elders stood in a huddled but silent  and amazed group, listening to the music and waiting for the sound  of the dinner gong.    Mr. Bostwick, who was hungry, picked up the bonbon dish that lay on  the table beside him and ate the pink confection. The professor was  watching him, so Mr. Bostwick courteously held the dish toward him.  The professor ate the lemon-yellow piece and the senator reached out  his hand and took the lavender piece. He did not eat it, however,  for, chancing to remember that it might spoil his dinner, he "]]]
