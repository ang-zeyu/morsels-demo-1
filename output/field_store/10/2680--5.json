[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/62"],[0,"A Princess of Mars (#10)"],[1," could not  say, but in any event they received a rude reception, for suddenly and  without warning the green Martian warriors fired a terrific volley from  the windows of the buildings facing the little valley across which the  great ships were so peacefully advancing.    Instantly the scene changed as by magic; the foremost vessel swung  broadside toward us, and bringing her guns into play returned our fire,  at the same time moving parallel to our front for a short distance and  then turning back with the evident intention of completing a great  circle which would bring her up to position once more opposite our  firing line; the other vessels followed in her wake, each one opening  upon us as she swung into position.  Our own fire never diminished, and  I doubt if twenty-five per cent of our shots went wild.  It had never  been given me to see such deadly accuracy of aim, and it seemed as  though a little figure on one of the craft dropped at the explosion of  each bullet, while the banners and upper works dissolved in spurts of  flame as the irresistible projectiles of our warriors mowed through  them.    The fire from the vessels was most ineffectual, owing, as I afterward  learned, to the unexpected suddenness of the first volley, which caught  the ship's crews entirely unprepared and the sighting apparatus of the  guns unprotected from the deadly aim of our warriors.    It seems that each green warrior has certain objective points for his  fire under relatively identical circumstances of warfare.  For example,  a proportion of them, always the best marksmen, direct their fire  entirely upon the wireless finding and sighting apparatus of the big  guns of an attacking naval force; another detail attends to the smaller  guns in the same way; others pick off the gunners; still others the  officers; while certain other quotas concentrate their attention upon  the other members of the crew, upon the upper works, and upon the  steering gear and propellers.    Twenty minutes after the first volley the great fleet swung trailing  off in the direction from which it had first appeared.  Several of the  craft were limping perceptibly, and seemed but barely under the control  of their depleted crews.  Their fire had ceased entirely and all their  energies seemed focused upon escape.  Our warriors then rushed up to  the roofs of the buildings which we occupied and followed the  retreating armada with a continuous fusillade of deadly fire.    One by one, however, the ships managed to dip below the crests of the  outlying hills until only one barely moving craft was in sight.  This  had received the brunt of our fire and seemed to be entirely unmanned,  as not a moving figure was visible upon her decks.  Slowly she swung  from her course, circling back toward us in an erratic and pitiful  manner.  Instantly the warriors ceased firing, for it was quite  apparent that the vessel was entirely helpless, and, far from being in  a position to inflict harm upon us, she could not even control herself  sufficiently to escape.    As she neared the city the warriors rushed out upon the plain to meet  her, but it was evident that she still was too high for them to hope to  reach her decks.  From my vantage point in the window I could see the  bodies of her crew strewn about, although I could not make out what  manner of creatures they might be.  Not a sign of life was manifest  upon her as she drifted slowly with the light breeze in a southeasterly  direction.    She was drifting some fifty feet above the ground, followed by all but  some hundred of the warriors who had been ordered back to the roofs to  cover the possibility of a return of the fleet, or of reinforcements.  It soon became evident that she would strike the face of the buildings  about a mile south of our position, and as I watched the progress of  the chase I saw a number of warriors gallop ahead, dismount and enter  the building she seemed destined to touch.    As the craft neared the building, and just before she struck, the  Martian warriors swarmed upon her from the windows, and with their  great spears eased the shock of the collision, and in a few moments  they had thrown out grappling hooks and the big boat was being hauled  to ground by their fellows below.    After making her fast, they swarmed the sides and searched the vessel  from stem to stern.  I could see them examining the dead sailors,  evidently for signs of life, and presently a party of them appeared  from below dragging a little figure among them.  The creature was  considerably less than half as tall as the green Martian warriors, and  from my balcony I could see that it walked erect upon two legs and  surmised that it was some new and strange Martian monstrosity with  which I had not as yet become acquainted.    They removed their prisoner to the ground and then commenced a  systematic rifling of the vessel.  This operation required several  hours, during which time a number of the chariots were requisitioned to  transport the loot, which consisted in arms, ammunition, silks, furs,  jewels, strangely carved stone vessels, and a quantity of solid foods  and liquids, including many casks of water, the first I had seen since  my advent upon Mars.    After the last load had been removed the warriors made lines fast to  the craft and towed her far out into the valley in a southwesterly  direction.  A few of them then boarded her and were busily engaged in  what appeared, from my distant position, as the emptying of the  contents of various carboys upon the dead bodies of the sailors and  over the decks and works of the vessel.    This operation concluded, they hastily clambered over her sides,  sliding down the guy ropes to the ground.  The last warrior to leave  the deck turned and threw something back upon the vessel, waiting an  instant to note the outcome of his act.  As a faint spurt of flame rose  from the point where the missile struck he swung over the side and was  quickly upon the ground.  Scarcely had he alighted than the guy ropes  were simultaneously released, and the great warship, lightened by the  removal of the loot, soared majestically into the air, her decks and  upper works a mass of roaring flames.    Slowly she drifted to the southeast, rising higher and higher as the  flames ate away her wooden parts and diminished the weight upon her.  Ascending to the roof of the building I watched her for hours, until  finally she was lost in the dim vistas of the distance.  The sight was  awe-inspiring in the extreme as one contemplated this mighty floating  funeral pyre, drifting unguided and unmanned through the lonely wastes  of the Martian heavens; a derelict of death and destruction, typifying  the life story of these strange and ferocious creatures into whose  unfriendly hands fate had carried it.    Much depressed, and, to me, unaccountably so, I slowly descended to the  street.  The scene I had witnessed seemed to mark the defeat and  annihilation of the forces of a kindred people, rather than the routing  by our green warriors of a horde of similar, though unfriendly,  creatures.  I could not fathom the seeming hallucination, nor could I  free myself from it; but somewhere in the innermost recesses of my soul  I felt a strange yearning toward these unknown foemen, and a mighty  hope surged through me that the fleet would return and demand a  reckoning from the green warriors who had so ruthlessly and wantonly  attacked it.    Close at my heel, in his now accustomed place, followed Woola, the  hound, and as I emerged upon the street Sola rushed up to me as though  I had been the object of some search on her part.  The cavalcade was  returning to the plaza, the homeward march having been given up for  that day; nor, in fact, was it recommenced for more than a week, owing  to the fear of a return attack by the air craft.    Lorquas Ptomel was too astute an old warrior to be caught upon the open  plains with a caravan of chariots and children, and so we remained at  the deserted city until the danger seemed passed.    As Sola and I entered the plaza a sight met my eyes which filled my  whole being with a great surge of mingled hope, fear, exultation, and  depression, and yet most dominant was a subtle sense of relief and  happiness; for just as we neared the throng of Martians I caught a  glimpse of the prisoner from the battle craft who was being roughly  dragged into a nearby building by a couple of green Martian females.    And the sight which met my eyes was that of a slender, girlish figure,  similar in every detail to the earthly women of my past life.  She did  not see me at first, but just as she was disappearing through the  portal of the building which was to be her prison she turned, and her  eyes met mine.  Her face was oval and beautiful in the extreme, her  every feature was finely chiseled and exquisite, her eyes large and  lustrous and her head surmounted by a mass of coal black, waving hair,  caught loosely into a strange yet becoming coiffure.  Her skin was of a  light reddish copper color, against which the crimson glow of her  cheeks and the ruby of her beautifully molded lips shone with a  strangely enhancing effect.    She was as destitute of clothes as the green Martians who accompanied  her; indeed, save for her highly wrought ornaments she was entirely  naked, nor could any apparel have enhanced the beauty of her perfect  and symmetrical figure.    As her gaze rested on me her eyes opened wide in astonishment, and she  made a little sign with her free hand; a sign which I did not, of  course, understand.  Just a moment we gazed upon each other, and then  the look of hope and renewed courage which had glorified her face as  she discovered me, faded into one of utter dejection, mingled with  loathing and contempt.  I realized I had not answered her signal, and  ignorant as I was of Martian customs, I intuitively felt that she had  made an appeal for succor"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/624"],[0,"Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887 (#10)"],[1," given.\"    \"As an industrial system, I should think this might be extremely  efficient,\" I said, \"but I don't see that it makes any provision for  the professional classes, the men who serve the nation with brains  instead of hands. Of course you can't get along without the  brain-workers. How, then, are they selected from those who are to serve  as farmers and mechanics? That must require a very delicate sort of  sifting process, I should say.\"    \"So it does,\" replied Dr. Leete; \"the most delicate possible test is  needed here, and so we leave the question whether a man shall be a  brain or hand worker entirely to him to settle. At the end of the term  of three years as a common laborer, which every man must serve, it is  for him to choose, in accordance to his natural tastes, whether he will  fit himself for an art or profession, or be a farmer or mechanic. If he  feels that he can do better work with his brains than his muscles, he  finds every facility provided for testing the reality of his supposed  bent, of cultivating it, and if fit of pursuing it as his avocation.  The schools of technology, of medicine, of art, of music, of  histrionics, and of higher liberal learning are always open to  aspirants without condition.\"    \"Are not the schools flooded with young men whose only motive is to  avoid work?\"    Dr. Leete smiled a little grimly.    \"No one is at all likely to enter the professional schools for the  purpose of avoiding work, I assure you,\" he said. \"They are intended  for those with special aptitude for the branches they teach, and any  one without it would find it easier to do double hours at his trade  than try to keep up with the classes. Of course many honestly mistake  their vocation, and, finding themselves unequal to the requirements of  the schools, drop out and return to the industrial service; no  discredit attaches to such persons, for the public policy is to  encourage all to develop suspected talents which only actual tests can  prove the reality of. The professional and scientific schools of your  day depended on the patronage of their pupils for support, and the  practice appears to have been common of giving diplomas to unfit  persons, who afterwards found their way into the professions. Our  schools are national institutions, and to have passed their tests is a  proof of special abilities not to be questioned.    \"This opportunity for a professional training,\" the doctor continued,  \"remains open to every man till the age of thirty is reached, after  which students are not received, as there would remain too brief a  period before the age of discharge in which to serve the nation in  their professions. In your day young men had to choose their  professions very young, and therefore, in a large proportion of  instances, wholly mistook their vocations. It is recognized nowadays  that the natural aptitudes of some are later than those of others in  developing, and therefore, while the choice of profession may be made  as early as twenty-four, it remains open for six years longer.\"    A question which had a dozen times before been on my lips now found  utterance, a question which touched upon what, in my time, had been  regarded the most vital difficulty in the way of any final settlement  of the industrial problem. \"It is an extraordinary thing,\" I said,  \"that you should not yet have said a word about the method of adjusting  wages. Since the nation is the sole employer, the government must fix  the rate of wages and determine just how much everybody shall earn,  from the doctors to the diggers. All I can say is, that this plan would  never have worked with us, and I don't see how it can now unless human  nature has changed. In my day, nobody was satisfied with his wages or  salary. Even if he felt he received enough, he was sure his neighbor  had too much, which was as bad. If the universal discontent on this  subject, instead of being dissipated in curses and strikes directed  against innumerable employers, could have been concentrated upon one,  and that the government, the strongest ever devised would not have seen  two pay days.\"    Dr. Leete laughed heartily.    \"Very true, very true,\" he said, \"a general strike would most probably  have followed the first pay day, and a strike directed against a  government is a revolution.\"    \"How, then, do you avoid a revolution every pay day?\" if demanded. \"Has  some prodigious philosopher devised a new system of calculus  satisfactory to all for determining the exact and comparative value of  all sorts of service, whether by brawn or brain, by hand or voice, by  ear or eye? Or has human nature itself changed, so that no man looks  upon his own things but 'every man on the things of his neighbor'? One  or the other of these events must be the explanation.\"    \"Neither one nor the other, however, is,\" was my host's laughing  response. \"And now, Mr. West,\" he continued, \"you must remember that  you are my patient as well as my guest, and permit me to prescribe  sleep for you before we have any more conversation. It is after three  o'clock.\"    \"The prescription is, no doubt, a wise one,\" I said; \"I only hope it  can be filled.\"    \"I will see to that,\" the doctor replied, and he did, for he gave me a  wineglass of something or other which sent me to sleep as soon as my  head touched the pillow.        Chapter 8    When I awoke I felt greatly refreshed, and lay a considerable time in a  dozing state, enjoying the sensation of bodily comfort. The experiences  of the day previous, my waking to find myself in the year 2000, the  sight of the new Boston, my host and his family, and the wonderful  things I had heard, were a blank in my memory. I thought I was in my  bed-chamber at home, and the half-dreaming, half-waking fancies which  passed before my mind related to the incidents and experiences of my  former life. Dreamily I reviewed the incidents of Decoration Day, my  trip in company with Edith and her parents to Mount Auburn, and my  dining with them on our return to the city. I recalled how extremely  well Edith had looked, and from that fell to thinking of our marriage;  but scarcely had my imagination begun to develop this delightful theme  than my waking dream was cut short by the recollection of the letter I  had received the night before from the builder announcing that the new  strikes might postpone indefinitely the completion of the new house.  The chagrin which this recollection brought with it effectually roused  me. I remembered that I had an appointment with the builder at eleven  o'clock, to discuss the strike, and opening my eyes, looked up at the  clock at the foot of my bed to see what time it was. But no clock met  my glance, and what was more, I instantly perceived that I was not in  my room. Starting up on my couch, I stared wildly round the strange  apartment.    I think it must have been many seconds that I sat up thus in bed  staring about, without being able to regain the clew to my personal  identity. I was no more able to distinguish myself from pure being  during those moments than we may suppose a soul in the rough to be  before it has received the ear-marks, the individualizing touches which  make it a person. Strange that the sense of this inability should be  such anguish! but so we are constituted. There are no words for the  mental torture I endured during this helpless, eyeless groping for  myself in a boundless void. No other experience of the mind gives  probably anything like the sense of absolute intellectual arrest from  the loss of a mental fulcrum, a starting point of thought, which comes  during such a momentary obscuration of the sense of one's identity. I  trust I may never know what it is again.    I do not know how long this condition had lasted--it seemed an  interminable time--when, like a flash, the recollection of everything  came back to me. I remembered who and where I was, and how I had come  here, and that these scenes as of the life of yesterday which had been  passing before my mind concerned a generation long, long ago mouldered  to dust. Leaping from bed, I stood in the middle of the room clasping  my temples with all my might between my hands to keep them from  bursting. Then I fell prone on the couch, and, burying my face in the  pillow, lay without motion. The reaction which was inevitable, from the  mental elation, the fever of the intellect that had been the first  effect of my tremendous experience, had arrived. The emotional crisis  which had awaited the full realization of my actual position, and all  that it implied, was upon me, and with set teeth and laboring chest,  gripping the bedstead with frenzied strength, I lay there and fought  for my sanity. In my mind, all had broken loose, habits of feeling,  associations of thought, ideas of persons and things, all had dissolved  and lost coherence and were seething together in apparently  irretrievable chaos. There were no rallying points, nothing was left  stable. There only remained the will, and was any human will strong  enough to say to such a weltering sea, \"Peace, be still\"? I dared not  think. Every effort to reason upon what had befallen me, and realize  what it implied, set up an intolerable swimming of the brain. The idea  that I was two persons, that my identity was double, began to fascinate  me with its simple solution of my experience.    I knew that I was on the verge of losing my mental balance. If I lay  there thinking, I was doomed. Diversion of some sort I must have, at  least the diversion of physical exertion. I sprang up, and, hastily  dressing, opened the door of my room and went down-stairs. The hour was  very early, it being not yet fairly light, and I found no one in the  lower part of the house. There was a hat in the hall, and, opening the  front door, which was fastened with a slightness indicating that  burglary was not among the perils of the modern Boston, I found myself  on the street.
