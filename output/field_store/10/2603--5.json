Vol. 1 (of 3) (#10)"],[1,"grace, refinement,  and good breeding, in unpretending guise, the very simplicity that  surrounds them seems to give additional force to their effect--nothing  appears out of place, no London bred cook or butler ever turned out  a more delicious or better served repast, than Vernon's dinner  yesterday. What is the magic of all this? Winter is a curious specimen  of humanity, yet he filled up his niche in the little party as no one  else could; nor can I fancy him out of his element in any society.  What an extraordinary contrast between Kate and that little deformed  organist! Unfortunate creature, and yet he appears perfectly happy!  With what _empressement_ the old Colonel and his sweet granddaughter  welcome him. And Kate herself, there is so much happiness in the  calm repose of her countenance, and her brilliant smile; one would  imagine her to be of fortune's favourites, the most favoured, yet  what a life of complete retirement she must lead. She said she had  not worn an evening dress for two years, till at that lucky ball. Is  her society made up of a brace and a half of oddities and a big dog?  I wonder how my sister Mary or Lady Georgina Lorton, or fifty others  of my acquaintance, would stand such a life. They talk of a couple  of months at the family seat, as if it was a life-long banishment on  some desolate island. Yes, it must be a terrible life for her, cut off  from all the _bienséances_ of society--but where could I have spent so  pleasant an evening? Where else have been so little bored by hacknied  conversation? Thus I wandered through the vast field of speculation,  opened up to my imagination by my yesterday's adventure. I could not  bring myself to compassionate Vernon for his evident change of fortune,  such a companionship and such a cottage must be well worth Dungar with  all its beauties. Though, to be sure, he would have had Kate there; her  manner, too, so unlike that of most women I had met. It never appeared  to challenge admiration or to expect _les petits soins_; all was frank,  cordial, kindly, real, yet monstrously unflattering to one's _amour  propre_; though at times there was a tinge of coquetry in her way of  evading, or turning into ridicule any attempt at a compliment. She  certainly is charming, and I must make the best of my time while I am  here; I suppose I must return to-morrow, so--    \"Mr. Winter\"--said the waiter.    \"Good morning, Captain Egerton,\" said that worthy personage, apparently  through a thicker stratum of mashed potatoes than ever, \"I thought I'd  catch you before you started on any explorations.\"    \"You are very good; I am particularly fortunate in securing such a  cicerone.\"    \"I am very happy to be of any use to you; sketching, I fancy, is not a  common taste among men of your profession?\"    \"I have encountered a good many draughtsmen among my brothers in arms,  and it is always a useful accomplishment for military men, but I do not  think it is a common taste in my profession.\"    \"No, the learned professions have no room for beauty in their crowded  life, and the idleness of yours is generally too strenuous for--but I  am blunt.\"    \"You say but the truth, Mr. Winter; yet we are not on the whole  as black as we are painted. Who is? This old town seems rich in  antiquities.\"    \"Yes, there is nothing in England like it, and, as Miss Vernon says,  its solemn rugged towers and churches give the idea of a calm but stern  old age after a stormy impetuous youth.\"    \"How agreeable Colonel Vernon is; I was very glad to meet him again.\"    \"Yes, he is a perfect specimen of a style fast disappearing. I always  wish to see him at the head of some noble establishment, because I am a  fool--much better for him as it is.\"    This was uttered with great impatience of manner, and I listened to it  with no small amazement.    \"Better?\" I echoed.    \"Yes, sir,\" reiterated Winter sharply, \"it takes a severer bit to break  a high mettled steed into useful paces than your half breeds require!  But do you feel inclined for a stroll this morning?\"    I replied in the affirmative, and we sallied forth together.    I walked on silently, revolving my companion's last sentence, and  voting it terribly harsh, yet not liking to draw him into any  discussion of it, as I felt instinctively that we viewed life through  different media.    He led the way through a narrow gloomy street, overhung by the upper  stories of the houses, and garnished with a species of gallery, to  which these projections served as a roof.    \"There,\" said he, pausing, \"is the old residence of the Bishops of  ----, and a very curious building it is.\"    I looked with great interest at the heavy carved gables, adorned with  royal and episcopal arms, and divided into compartments containing  carved representations of Adam and Eve, a tree and a serpent, all of  equal dimensions, Cain and Abel, Balaam and his Ass, Abraham, in trunk  hose, about to sacrifice Isaac on a small reading desk, with various  other specimens of carving. The wooden pillars supporting the fabric  over the gallery I have mentioned were carved and twisted into the most  grotesque and awsome shapes, which only some tortured spirit could have  imagined!    \"This alone is worth a visit,\" said I, after a long and curious gaze.  \"What may be the age of this building?\"    \"That is not easy to say. The initials on that centre scutcheon, 'J.  R.,' you see, would lead us to suppose it was not older than the  beginning of the seventeenth century, but it has always appeared to me  that these letters and the coat of arms they surmount are of a more  modern date than the other ornaments on the building or the building  itself; but though I have searched some old chronicles I cannot satisfy  myself on the subject.\"    \"At all events it shall be No. 1 of my sketches. Have you no favourite  theory as to its date?\" I asked.    \"No, I always endeavour to curb imagination.\"    \"And you an artist!\" said I.    \"Yes,\" he replied, \"in my studio imagination is a welcome guest, but  even there she must submit to the bridle. She may create materials for  a subject, but should never be allowed to tamper with those already in  existence?\"    \"I do not like your view on this point; surely imagination is the  source of much exquisite and innocent pleasure?\"    \"I see,\" said Winter, \"you will side with my fair antagonist, Miss  Vernon; she talks whole volumes of the prettiest fantasies on this  subject, and never has patience to hear my solemn assurance that  imagination, though a grand and glorious gift, requires strong  coercion. But then we never agree, although we are fast friends.\"    \"My dear Sir,\" I exclaimed, with some warmth, \"you and I may require  to rein up ours occasionally, but I do not suppose Miss Vernon's  imagination ever presents any but the holiest images.\"    \"Ha! ha!\" laughed Winter, \"ha! ha! Kate is a more than commonly good  girl, but she's not an angel;--I would not love her half so well if  she was! And, take my advice, do not tell her your opinion of her,  or in spite of her having nearly as brilliant a fancy as your own,  she'll make you laugh at yourself!\" I had too much _savoir faire_ not  to receive this sally with a smiling acknowledgment of its wisdom,  although it grated on my feelings; and in my heart I experienced a  sensation approximating to a lively hatred to my intelligent cicerone,  who continued--\"I have made several sketches of this old house, but  I find that carved front does not tell well in a picture; large  proportions, plenty of light and shade, are what we want for effect.\"    From this point a neighbouring flight of steps conducted us to the  walls, from which we gazed on many a lovely picture; Winter expatiating  on their peculiar beauties as a connoisseur dwells on the excellences  of some oft-studied _chef d'oeuvre_ of art.    \"As for the legends,\" said he, \"in which every inch of this ground is  rich, you must get Miss Vernon to tell them to you; I would make a sad  _olla podrida_ of them were I to try; but she is perfect in it, and,  with Gilpin's assistance, has acquired some large additions lately.\"    \"That Mr. Gilpin seems an oddity,\" I observed.    \"Yes, poor fellow! and yet if his form was as straight as his heart,  you would find few as beautiful. It would be impossible to tell all  the good he does, and that with the miserable stipend of an Organist.  _Carambo!_ he might put our pampered priests to the blush, if such a  thing were possible.\"    \"He seems to be a great favourite with the Colonel and Miss Vernon,\"  said I.    \"Yes,\" returned Winter, \"there is no one ranks so high in Miss Vernon's  estimation. What between his music and misfortunes, he has got the  _entrée_ of her heart completely. His father was a clergyman of a  respectable north country race, blessed, of course, with small means  and a large family. I fancy poor Gilpin's must have been a sorry lot  among a number of rough Northumberland lads; his deformity shut him  out from arms, church, bar, and every profession; so he draws an  indifferent existence from the art he so much loves. An invalid sister  lived here with him. It seems their better-to-do brothers remembered to  forget their unaspiring relatives, and the quiet neglected organist and  his sister were all in all to each other, until about a year after the  Vernons settled here, when, after a long and steady decline, she died  in the same gentle unobtrusive manner she had lived, and poor Gilpin  has been a lonely man since.\"    \"It is impossible,\" continued Winter, striking his stick against  the ground and speaking more thickly, which I began to perceive he  usually did when excited, \"it is impossible to describe Kate Vernon's  thoughtful delicate kindness to the poor forlorn creature; faith, sir,  it makes me ready to admit she is an angel when I think of it.\"    I mentally retracted my previous conclusions touching the speaker.    \"Humph, ha!\" said Mr. Winter, wiping "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47449"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 8 (of 8) (#10)"],[1,"purposes, such as those of State-aided British  immigration and State-constructed irrigation works, cannot be in the  interest of the mining groups. The lowering of the wages of the white  miners is clearly in their interest; while opposed to the prospects of  welfare of British miners and British merchants in the towns, to those  of the professional classes, and, above all, to the interests of British  agricultural settlers, whose occupation cannot be profitable for many  years to come unless their market is at their door. Mining profits  remitted to Berlin and Paris, instead of going to the pockets of  resident British miners, cannot benefit the British agricultural  settler. Again, the truck system, by which employers supply goods to  their workers (a system illegal in England), while it may increase the  profits of the mining groups, would be destruction of the trade of the  British dwellers in the towns. This aspect of the question is rendered  more serious by the fact that practically all the press of South Africa  is owned or controlled by the financiers of the mining groups.    Lastly, a danger which has existed for generations is that arising from  the existence of a body of sentiment in the United Kingdom which, for  want of a better word, is called negrophilism. This sentiment is usually  voiced by British missionaries, and advocates an impossible black man  and brother theory. Its effect on British legislation and administration  in South Africa caused the first dissension of moment between Boers and  British at the time of the abolition of negro slavery in 1836. The whole  theory is felt by all Europeans of South African experience to be based  on a flat contradiction of the facts of life and the teaching of the 250  years of European contact with the South African native--Bushman,  Hottentot, or Kaffir. Allied with this is the colour-blindness of some  Anglo-Indians, who favour the disastrous measure of flooding South  Africa with Asiatics from India.      V.--LINES OF LEGISLATION TO CARRY OUT THE IMPERIAL POLICY    Having defined the Imperial policy in South Africa to be the maintenance  of the integrity of that federation of freemen which is the British  Empire, the upholding of the banner of European justice and humanity in  the Dark Continent, and for the promotion of these ends the fusion of  all strains of the European race in one community, let us now consider  the general lines of State action requisite to carry out that policy.    All parties loyal to the Empire are agreed that the first requisite  from the standpoint of the Imperial welfare is the promotion of the  immigration of British agriculturists to South Africa. The enormous  birth-rate of the Boer people will prevent any prospect of fusion  between British and Boers--anything, in fact, but the swamping of the  British element--unless this immigration be organised by the State. The  life of the gold and diamond mines cannot last longer--so those  qualified to speak are agreed--than a few generations. With the  exhaustion of the mines, the British population, if confined to the  towns, would inevitably disappear. Again, the Boers being essentially  country folk, could never have that close association with the British  necessary for the coalition of a united people, unless the British are  settled as agriculturists. A most encouraging precedent of the success  of State-organised immigration of British settlers on the land is to be  found in the State-aided immigration of 1820 into the Eastern Province  of Cape Colony.    Exactly as in Egypt and in India, agriculture, to be prosperous and to  extend over large areas, is impossible in South Africa unless with the  aid of State-constructed irrigation works. The water supply, both from  rainfall and underground natural reservoirs, is ample; but engineering  skill is required to enable these sources to be utilised all the year  round. The recently published report of Mr. W. Willcocks shows what  favourable prospects exist for the carrying out of a general system of  State irrigation works.    One word of warning is necessary. The general impression, so sedulously  created for many years past, of the unsuitability of South Africa as a  sphere for British immigration, is, as Mr. Rudyard Kipling has pointed  out, only a part of a political propaganda, intended to exclude British  influence. It may be entirely ignored.    The next requisite of State action is the promotion, by legislation and  administration, of the development of the present and future goldfields,  and other mineral fields, in such manner as may tend to further the  general ends of the Imperial policy as already described. The taxation  of the mines should be so adjusted as to favour British immigration and  the creation of a prosperous and loyal British community. The  development of new fields should be encouraged; adequate sums should be  raised for public objects; the minerals, expressly declared to be  property of the State, should be primarily regarded as a fund for State  purposes, not one for the creation of millionaires or the undue  enriching of shareholders in Hamburg or Paris or Vienna. The welfare of  the mass of British residents in the towns engaged in trade should be  considered in legislation affecting the gold mines.    In view of the presence of an overwhelming majority of the subject  Kaffir race, all Europeans should be trained to arms, on the model of  the laws already in existence in the two new Colonies. From an Imperial,  as distinguished from a European standpoint, this measure is equally  necessary. The Boers are born soldiers: a nation in arms. No reliance on  a professional army or professional police can afford any assurance of  stability for the Imperial rule. The Boers would regard such a régime as  merely one of transitory military domination.    An efficient system of education, from primary school to university,  should be organised and carried out. In the new Colonies great progress  has already been made in this direction, and a recently published  address by Mr. W. Sargent, the Director of Education, shows that the  principles to be kept in mind are clearly apprehended.    A sane and consistent policy with regard to the status of the Kaffir and  other non-European people should be adopted and adhered to. The Boer  position, that the Kaffir is not in justice entitled to equality, social  or political, with Europeans, should be upheld, as that plainly  sanctioned by European experience of two centuries and a half.    Efficiency should be insisted on as the test for appointment in the  public service. Salaries on an adequate scale should be given, bearing  in mind the standard of payment usually obtaining in gold-bearing  districts. The obstacles in the way of making efficiency the test of  appointment should be clearly understood, and as far as possible guarded  against; the persistence of Young Afrikander Separatist ideals, and the  readiness of the propagandists to accept office under the Imperial  Government; the danger of undue weight being given to the influence of  the great capitalists; the equal danger of the intrigue, favouritism,  and nepotism of London society--of which so much was heard at the late  Committee of Inquiry into the training of army officers--being brought  to bear on appointments to office in the new Colonies.    The language question--that of the degree of recognition necessary or  expedient of the Dutch language in the courts and public offices--is so  important that it is better to consider it separately.    [Illustration: Photo: Russell, London.    HON. SIR ARTHUR LAWLEY, K.C.M.G.,    Lieutenant-Governor of the Transvaal.]      VI.--THE LANGUAGE QUESTION    The question of the degree of recognition of the Dutch language in the  new Colonies to be accorded by the new administration is one of the most  difficult, and at the same time one of the most urgent and altogether  inevitable, presented by the altered situation, the result of the late  war. It is one of the cases where not to decide is to decide. Let us  endeavour to understand the conditions of the problem, bearing steadily  in mind the objects to be aimed at by the Imperial policy.    No responsible statesman in the United Kingdom or in the Colonies can  desire to take any step other than conciliatory to Boer sentiment,  provided the main object of creating a united and prosperous European  community is obtained. Anything like a persecution of the Boer tongue or  traditions would not only be unjust, but most unwise. At the same time,  Imperial statesmen must remember that British-descended citizens of the  Empire in South Africa hold that their sentiment and their opinion is  not to be taken as a matter to be ignored. Now, Imperialist sentiment in  South Africa is united as to the desirability of having only one  official language, and of doing away with the dual language system  introduced in Cape Colony twenty years ago.    Limiting any action of the Imperial Government, must necessarily be the  conditions as to the recognition of Dutch agreed upon with the Boer  generals as one of the terms of peace. These conditions were that the  Dutch language is to be taught in the schools, in cases where the  parents of the children desire it; and in the courts of law in cases  where, in the opinion of the court, the ends of justice will be  furthered by its use. The wish of the parents and the discretion of the  law-courts are, therefore, to be arbiters. The peace terms, in this  matter, seem wholly reasonable; but the main question of a dual language  remains unaffected.    Let us first deal with the cause of much misapprehension in the United  Kingdom in this matter. Here I will quote from an article of mine  published some time before the peace agreement:--    \"There is no question here of the suppression of the language of a  people. The language of the Boer people of South Africa is a patois  called "]]]
