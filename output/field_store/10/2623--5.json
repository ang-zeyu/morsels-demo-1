It  will require continuation of rent control in shortage areas as well as  legislation to permit control of sales prices. It will require maximum  conversion of temporary war units for veterans' housing and their  transportation to communities with the most pressing needs; the Congress  has already appropriated funds for this purpose.    The inflation in the price of housing is growing daily.    As a result of the housing shortage, it is inevitable that the present  dangers of inflation in home values will continue unless the Congress takes  action in the immediate future.    Legislation is now pending in the Congress which would provide for ceiling  prices for old and new houses. The authority to fix such ceilings is  essential. With such authority, our veterans and other prospective home  owners would be protected against a skyrocketing of home prices. The  country would be protected from the extension of the present inflation in  home values which, if allowed to continue, will threaten not only the  stabilization program but our opportunities for attaining a sustained high  level of home construction.    Such measures are necessary stopgaps-but only stopgaps. This emergency  action, taken alone, is good--but not enough. The housing shortage did not  start with the war or with demobilization; it began years before that and  has steadily accumulated. The speed with which the Congress establishes the  foundation for a permanent, long-range housing program will determine how  effectively we grasp the immense opportunity to achieve our goal of decent  housing and to make housing a major instrument of continuing prosperity and  full employment in the years ahead. It will determine whether we move  forward to a stable and healthy housing enterprise and toward providing a  decent home for every American family.    Production is the only fully effective answer. To get the wheels turning, I  have appointed an emergency housing expediter. I have approved  establishment of priorities designed to assure an ample share of scarce  materials to builders of houses for which veterans will have preference.  Additional price and wage adjustments will be made where necessary, and  other steps will be taken to stimulate greater production of bottleneck  items. I recommend consideration of every sound method for expansion in  facilities for insurance of privately financed housing by the Federal  Housing Administration and resumption of previously authorized low-rent  public housing projects suspended during the war.    In order to meet as many demands of the emergency situation as possible, a  program of emergency measures is now being formulated for action. These  will include steps in addition to those already taken. As quickly as this  program can be formulated, announcement will be made.    Last September I also outlined to the Congress the basic principles for the  kind of decisive, permanent legislation necessary for a long-range housing  program.    These principles place paramount the fact that housing construction and  financing for the overwhelming majority of our citizens should be done by  private enterprise. They contemplate also that we afford governmental  encouragement to privately financed house construction for families of  moderate income, through extension of the successful system of insurance of  housing investment; that research be undertaken to develop better and  cheaper methods of building homes; that communities be assisted in  appraising their housing needs; that we commence a program of Federal aid,  with fair local participation, to stimulate and promote the rebuilding and  redevelopment of slums and blighted areas--with maximum use of private  capital. It is equally essential that we use public funds to assist  families of low income who could not otherwise enjoy adequate housing, and  that we quicken our rate of progress in rural housing.    Legislation now under consideration by the Congress provides for a  comprehensive attack jointly by private enterprise, State and local  authorities, and the Federal Government. This legislation would make  permanent the National Housing Agency and give it authority and funds for  much needed technical and economic research. It would provide additional  stimulus for privately financed housing construction. This stimulus  consists of establishing a new system of yield insurance to encourage  large-scale investment in rental housing and broadening the insuring powers  of the Federal Housing Administration and the lending powers of the Federal  savings and loan associations.    Where private industry cannot build, the Government must step in to do the  job. The bill would encourage expansion in housing available for the lowest  income groups by continuing to provide direct subsidies for low-rent  housing and rural housing. It would facilitate land assembly for urban  redevelopment by loans and contributions to local public agencies where the  localities do their share.    Prompt enactment of permanent housing legislation along these lines will  not interfere with the emergency action already under way. On the contrary,  it would lift us out of a potentially perpetual state of housing emergency.  It would offer the best hope and prospect to millions of veterans and other  American families that the American system can offer more to them than  temporary makeshifts.    I have said before that the people of the United States can be the best  housed people in the world. I repeat that assertion, and I welcome the  cooperation of the Congress in achieving that goal.    (j) Social security and health.    Our Social Security System has just celebrated its tenth anniversary.  During the past decade this program has supported the welfare and morale of  a large part of our people by removing some of the hazards and hardships of  the aged, the unemployed, and widows and dependent children.    But, looking back over 10 years' experience and ahead to the future, we  cannot fail to see defects and serious inadequacies in our system as it now  exists. Benefits are in many cases inadequate; a great many persons are  excluded from coverage; and provision has not been made for social  insurance to cover the cost of medical care and the earnings lost by the  sick and the disabled.    In the field of old-age security, there seems to be no adequate reason for  excluding such groups as the self-employed, agricultural and domestic  workers, and employees of nonprofit organizations. Since many of these  groups earn wages too low to permit significant savings for old age, they  are in special need of the assured income that can be provided by old-age  insurance.    We must take urgent measures for the readjustment period ahead. The  Congress for some time has been considering legislation designed to  supplement at Federal expense, during the immediate reconversion period,  compensation payments to the unemployed. Again I urge the Congress to enact  legislation liberalizing unemployment compensation benefits and extending  the coverage. Providing for the sustained consumption by the unemployed  persons and their families is more than a welfare policy; it is sound  economic policy. A sustained high level of consumer purchases is a basic  ingredient of a prosperous economy.    During the war, nearly 5 million men were rejected for military service  because of physical or mental defects which in many cases might have been  prevented or corrected. This is shocking evidence that large sections of  the population are at substandard levels of health. The need for a program  that will give everyone opportunity for medical care is obvious. Nor can  there be any serious doubt of the Government's responsibility for helping  in this human and social problem.    The comprehensive health program which I recommended on November 19, 1945,  will require substantial additions to the Social Security System and, in  conjunction with other changes that need to be made, will require further  consideration of the financial basis for social security. The system of  prepaid medical care which I have recommended is expected eventually to  require amounts equivalent to 4 percent of earnings up to $3,600 a year,  which is about the average of present expenditures by individuals for  medical care. The pooling of medical costs, under a plan which permits each  individual to make a free choice of doctor and hospital, would assure that  individuals receive adequate treatment and hospitalization when they are  faced with emergencies for which they cannot budget individually. In  addition, I recommended insurance benefits to replace part of the earnings  lost through temporary sickness and permanent disability.    Even without these proposed major additions, it would now be time to  undertake a thorough reconsideration of our social security laws. The  structure should be expanded and liberalized. Provision should be made for  extending coverage credit to veterans for the period of their service in  the armed forces. In the financial provisions we must reconcile the  actuarial needs of social security, including health insurance, with the  requirements of a revenue system that is designed to promote a high level  of consumption and full employment.    (k) Education.    Although the major responsibility for financing education rests with the  States, some assistance has long been given by the Federal Government.  Further assistance is desirable and essential. There are many areas and  some whole States where good schools cannot be provided without imposing an  undue local tax burden on the citizens. It is essential to provide adequate  elementary and secondary schools everywhere, and additional educational  opportunities for large numbers of people beyond the secondary"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50535"],[0,"Blood Atonement and the Origin of Plural Marriage: A Discussion (#10)"],[1,"in  unsheathing the bowie knife, to conquer or die, as were the patriots at  Lexington and Bunker Hill!    Home and liberty and life, with the right to worship God, are just as  dear to a \"Mormon\" as to members of any other denomination or even an  apostate \"Mormon,\" and when the \"Mormons\" are persecuted, driven and  slain and forced to seek a home in the savage wilds, would any honest  man blame them if they declined to move again?    Why is it worse for \"Utah Mormons\" to defend themselves than for  \"Mormons\" at Crooked river and Nauvoo? Even the noble Prophet Joseph  Smith, when dragged from home and persecuted by wicked men, solemnly  demurred. Said he to the Saints at Nauvoo on the 30th day of June,  1843, after his escape from Missourian assassins:        \"Before I will be dragged away again among my enemies for trial,      _I will spill the last drop of blood in my veins and will see all      my enemies in hell_! To bear it any longer would be a sin, and I      will not bear it any longer. Shall we bear it any longer? (one      universal, No! ran through all the vast assembly like a loud peal      of thunder.) * * * If mobs come upon you any more here, dung your      gardens with them. We don't want any excitement; but after we have      done all, we will rise up Washington-like and break off the hellish      yoke that oppresses us, and will not be mobbed!\"    I have copied this from the manuscript history of the Prophet Joseph  Smith, as it was recorded at the time. I have learned also that it is  corroborated by the journal of Wilford Woodruff of the same date--June  30th, 1843.      UTAH NOT A FIELD OF BLOOD    You say, \"I have read that which leads me to believe that under  Brighamism\"--as you slurringly remark--\"Utah was for years a land of  assassination and a field of blood,\" and then you ask me, \"what of  the Mountain Meadows massacre,--the destruction of the Aiken party;  the dying confession of Bishop J. D. Lee; the Hickman butcheries; the  Danties?\"    Well, that which you have read counts for but little when the source is  considered. Your case is most certainly desperate when you are forced  to accept the statements of murderers.    It's a strange thing that you and many of your elders accept all the  blood-curdling tales from Beadle, Stenhouse and other apostate sources  _when_ they happen to refer to Brigham Young and \"Utah Mormons,\"  and denounce the same sources when they refer to the Prophet Joseph  Smith. Yet, I repeat, the same class of charges--in many respects  identical--that you charge against Brigham Young, of murder, bloodshed,  adultery, and even Danties, were first made by bitter enemies of the  Church before the death of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and that just such  falsehoods brought about the bitterness that resulted in his death.    You resort to sources that even the editor of your official paper  denounces as \"Idle and vicious stories gathered from the awful files  of terrible tales told about the Mormons, by those at enmity with  them.\"--_Saints Herald_ 52:2.    If you desire to know the character of Christ do you accept the  statements of the Roman guard at the sepulchre? the Jew with  blood-stained hands who rejoices in his death? and the anti-Christian?  Wherein then, is your consistency in asking me to accept the testimony  of those whose hands are imbrued in blood, apostates and bitter enemies  of my people?    Very well then, I return your question. What about them? Pray tell,  what about the Mountain Meadows massacre? the Aiken party? the  confessions of Lee? (by the way, the fact that you call him a \"Bishop\"  proves the source of your information); what about Hickman and above  all, the Danties?    When Alfred Henry Lewis, in _Collier's Weekly_ of March 26, 1964,  stated, \"Brigham Young invented his destroying angels, placed himself  at their head, and when a man rebelled had him murdered, if one fled  the fold, he was pursued and slain,\" he repeated one of the most  colossal falsehoods ever uttered. Nor is that the only falsehood in his  article you are pleased to quote.    Brigham Young was _not_ a man of blood. The \"Mormon\" people were _not_  guilty of the Mountain Meadows massacre.[2] There was no destruction  of an Aiken party. Hickman and Lee are not worth the mention; and the  Danties! Had you not better read Church history of 1838? In Utah there  never were destroying angels or Danties, except in the imagination of  bitter anti-\"Mormons\" and I am satisfied that Mr. R. C. Evans knows  that fact.      CHARACTER OF THE \"MORMONS\"    In answer to your many charges about Utah and the \"Mormons,\" I desire  to refer to credible references from witnesses who understood the truth  and were bold enough to express it.        Last winter there was a census taken of the Utah Penitentiary      and the Salt Lake City and county prisons with the following      result:--In Salt Lake City there are about 75 Mormons to 25      non-Mormons; in Salt Lake County there are about 80 Mormons to      20 non-Mormons; yet in the city prison there were 29 convicts,      all non-Mormons. In the county prison there were 6 convicts all      non-Mormons. The jailer stated that the county convicts for the      five years past were all anti-Mormons except _three_! * * *        Out of the 200 saloon, billiard, bowling alley and pool table      keepers not over a dozen even profess to be Mormons. All of      the bagnios and other disreputable concerns in the territory      are run and sustained by non-Mormons. Ninety-eight per cent of      the gamblers in Utah are of the same element. * * * Of the 250      towns and villages in Utah, over 200 have no \"gaudy sepulchre of      departed virtue,\" and these two hundred and odd towns are almost      exclusively Mormon in population. Of the suicides committed in Utah      ninety odd per cent are non-Mormons, and of the Utah homicides and      infanticides over 80 per cent are perpetrated by the 17 per cent of      \"outsiders.\"--Phil Robinson, in _Sinners and Saints_, p. 72.        The Logan police force is a good-tempered looking young man.      There is another to help him, but if they had not something      else to do they would either have to keep arresting each other,      in order to pass the time, or else combine to hunt gophers and      chipmunks.--_Sinners and Saints_, p. 142.        Whence have the public derived their opinions about Mormonism?      From _anti-Mormons_ only. I have ransacked the literature of the      subject, and yet I really could not tell any one where to go for      an impartial book about Mormonism, later in date than Burton's      \"City of the Saints,\" published in 1862. * * * But put Burton on      one side and I think I can defy any one to name another book about      the Mormons worthy of honest respect. From that truly _awful_      book, \"The History of the Saints,\" published by one Bennet (even      an anti-Mormon has styled him \"the greatest rascal that ever came      to the west\") in 1842, down to Stenhouse's in 1873, there is not,      to my knowledge a single Gentile work before the public that is      not utterly unreliable from distortion of facts. Yet it is from      these books--for there are no others--that the American public has      acquired nearly all its ideas about the people of Utah.--_Sinners      and Saints_, p. 245.        And in relation to opposing evidence, almost every book that has      been put forth respecting the people of Utah by one not a Mormon,      is full of calumny, each author apparently endeavoring to surpass      his predecessor in the libertinism of abuse. Most of these are      written in a sensational style, and for the purpose of deriving      profit by pandering to a vitiated public taste, and are wholly      unreliable as to facts.--_Bancroft's History of Utah_, preface page      7.        It is only fair to state that no Gentile, even the unprejudiced,      who are rare aves, however long he may live or intimately he may      be connected with Mormons, can expect to see anything but the      superficies. * * *        The Mormons have been represented, and are generally believed to      be, an intolerant race. I found the reverse far nearer the fact.      The best proof of this is that there is hardly one anti-Mormon      publication, however untruthful, violent, or scandalous, which      I did not find in Great Salt Lake City.--Burton's _City of the      Saints_, p. 203.        I have not yet heard the single charge against them as a community,      against their habitual purity of life, their integrity of dealing,      their toleration of religious differences in opinion, their regard      for the laws, or their devotion to the Constitutional government      under which we live, that I do not from my own observation, or the      testimony of others know to be unfounded.--General Thomas L. Kane,      U. S. A., _The Mormons_, p. 83.        The Mormons are sober, industrious and thrifty.--Bishop Spaulding,      of the Episcopalian Church, in the _Forum_, March, 1887.        Had the Mormons been a low, corrupt or shiftless people they never      would or could have done what they did in Utah. * * * When they      controlled their own city of Salt Lake it contained no saloons,      gambling houses or places of ill repute, and when the town had      grown to be a goodly city order was kept by two constables. If by      their fruits we may know them, the Mormons deserve our confidence      and praise.--_The Brooklyn Eagle_, editorial of Aug. 12, 1897.        I shall not arraign the Mormon people as wanting in comparison with      other people in religious devotion, virtue, honesty, sobriety,      industry, and the graces and qualities that adorn, beautify      and bless life.--Caleb W. West, Governor of Utah (and a strong      anti-Mormon) in report to Secretary of the Interior for 1888.        I know the people of the east have judged the Mormons unjustly."]]]
