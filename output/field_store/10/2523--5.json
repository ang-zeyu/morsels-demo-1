Science would, indeed, receive incalculable and lasting benefit, if  those of our conchologists who reside near the coast would pay greater  attention to the inhabiting animals, and less to the shells, of their  neighbourhood; for the first would supply that information they acknowledge  is so desirable, and the latter would prevent our indigenous Catalogue from  being crowded with many dubious, and even foreign shells.    English conchologists appear not to be aware of the vast number of  testaceous animals which are now known. Among those truly eminent men who  have prosecuted this study, M. Adanson stands foremost, in having minutely  described all those he found on the African coast; in the magnificent work  of Poli nearly all the Mediterranean bivalves are exquisitely figured; and  those of the land and fresh water will receive complete illustration from  M. Ferrusac. Cuvier, Lamarck, Say, and even our own countrymen, Dr. Leach  and Montague, have all contributed, more or less, to form a mass of  information which it is full time should be employed as the basis of  natural classification.           *       *       *       *       *    PALUDINA elongata,    _Long-spired River Snail--upper and lower figures._           *       *       *       *       *        _P. testa olivaceo-fusca, fasciis castaneis ornata; spira producta,      attenuata, apertura multo longiore; apice acuto._        Shell olive brown, with chesnut bands; spire lengthened, attenuated,      much longer than the aperture; tip acute.           *       *       *       *       *    Inhabits the rivers of India.

They frequent  open cultivated spots near habitations, always perching on the withered  branches of a low tree; where they will sit nearly motionless for hours,  unless, indeed, they descry some luckless insect passing near them, at  which they immediately dart, returning again to the identical twig they had  just left, and which they will sometimes frequent for months. At such times  the disproportionate size of the head is rendered more conspicuous by the  bird raising its feathers so as to appear not unlike a puff ball; hence the  general name they have received from the English residents in Brazil; of  which vast country all the species, I believe, are natives. When  frightened, their form is suddenly changed by the feathers lying quite  flat; they are very confiding, and will often take their station within a  few yards of the window; the two sexes are generally near each other, and  often on the same tree.    Total length rather more than eight inches; bill, one inch and three  quarters from the gape, and half an inch less from the nostrils; it is very  strong, thick, black, and slightly compressed; the tip of the upper bifid;  the bristles at its base covering the nostrils are long and incurved, and  those situated at the base, under the eye, very stiff; the upper part of  the head black, the feathers much lengthened; the sides, front, ears, and  forepart of the throat white, uniting at the back of the head into a narrow  collar. The whole of the remaining plumage above is black, glossed with  greenish; across the breast a black bar, which separates the white of the  throat from the buff colour which tinges the abdomen and vent; the flanks  are marked with dusky transverse stripes; the tail is slightly rounded and  three inches and a half long, some of the feathers with a very fine line of  white at their tips; all the quill feathers have the base half of their  inner shafts white, as well as the greater covers inside, the lesser being  black; legs and claws blackish.    I am disposed to consider this bird only as a variety of the _Greater pied  Barbut_ of Dr. Latham, differing in having the plumage on the under part of  the body pale ferruginous, or buff colour, instead of white, as in the  specimens he described from Cayenne; mine are from Southern Brazil, where  the species is not uncommon.    This genus includes the American species of the Linnaean Barbuts; the birds  connecting this group with the cuckows are arranged by Vieillot in a  separate genus, named by him _Monassa_; which I think should be retained,  as it is of much importance to designate strongly connecting links between  families apparently very opposite.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 100    [Illustration]    XENOPS genibarbis,    _Whiskered Xenops._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.

More than  once did Billy make his rider's arm ache from pulling at the curb, when  the other horses were all knocked up by the rough day's riding. It was  interesting to see him in pursuit of buffalo. He would often smell them  when they were hidden in ravines, and we wholly unaware of their  vicinity. Head and ears were erect in an instant, and, with nostrils  expanded, forward he went, keeping eagerly in front at a peculiar  prancing step which we called tiptoeing. Once in sight of the game, and  the rider became a person of quite secondary importance. Billy said, as  plainly as a horse could say any thing, \"_I_ am going to manage this  thing; _you_ stick on.\" And manage it he did. Not many moments, at the  most, before he was at the quarters of the fleeing monsters, and nipping  them mischievously with his teeth. I could always imagine him giving a  downright horse-laugh, his big bright eyes sparkled so when the  frightened bison, at the touch, gave a switch of his tail and a swerve  of alarm, and plunged more wildly forward. If the rider wished to  shoot, he could do so; if not, content himself, as Mr. Colon usually  did, with clinging to the saddle, and uttering numberless expostulatory  but fruitless \"whoa's.\"    Once on our trip Billy was loaned for the day to a gentleman who wished  to examine a prospective coal mine. When barely out of sight of camp,  Billy discovered a herd of buffalo, and, despite the vehement  remonstrances of his rider, straightway charged it. The mine-seeker was  no hunter, but a wise and thoroughly timid devotee of science in search  of coal measures. A few moments, and the poor, frightened gentleman  found himself in the midst of a surging mass of buffalo, his knees  brushing their hairy sides, and their black horns glittering close  around him, like an array of serried spears. He drew his knees into the  saddle, and there, clinging like a monkey, lost his hat, his map of the  mine, and his spectacles. He returned Billy as soon as he could get him  back to camp, with expressions of gratitude that he had been allowed to  escape with life, and never manifested the least desire to mount him  again.    Sachem's purchase was a horse which had run unaccountably to legs. He  was sixteen hands high, a trifle knock-kneed, and with a way of flinging  the limbs out when put to his speed which, though it seemed awkward  enough, yet got over the ground remarkably well. With the shambling gait  of a camel, he had also the good qualities of one, and did his owner  honest service.    Muggs bought a mule, partly because advised to do so by a plainsman, and  partly because the rest of us took horses. With true British obstinacy  he paid no attention to our expostulations, and the creature he obtained  was as obstinate as himself. Poor Muggs! A mule may be good property in  the hands of a plainsman, but was never intended to carry a Briton.    Semi-Colon had the auction purchase, and Dobeen selected a Mexican  donkey, one of the toughest little animals that ever pulled a bit. He  could excel a trained mule in the feat of dislodging his rider, and had  a remarkable penchant for running over persons who by chance might be  looking the other way. It seemed to be his constant study to take  unexpected positions, or, as Sachem phrased it, to \"strike an attitude.\"    My mount was a stout-built old mare, recommended to me as a solid beast,  on the strength of which, and wishing to avoid experiments, I made  purchase at once. I found her solid indeed. When on the gallop her feet  came down with a shock which made my head vibrate, as if I had  accidentally taken two steps instead of one, in descending a staircase.    Could the good people of Topeka have gotten us to ride out of their town  upon our several animals, it would have given them a fair idea of a  _mardi gras_ cavalcade in New Orleans.    And so, our camp equipage and live stock following by freight, the  express rolled us forward toward the great plains. So far along our  route we had seen but few Indians, and those civilized specimens, such  as straggle occasionally through the streets of Topeka. The Indian  reservations in Kansas are at some distance apart, and their  inhabitants frequently exchange visits. The few whom we had seen  consisted of Osages, Kaws, Pottawatomies, and Sioux, all equally dirty,  but the last affecting clothes more than the others, and eschewing  paint. The members of this tribe, generally speaking, have good farms  and are worth a handsome average per head. At the time of our visit they  were expecting a half million dollars or so from Washington, and were  soon to become American citizens. One privilege of this citizenship  struck us as very peculiar. By the State law, as long as an Indian is  simply an Indian, he can buy no whisky, and is thus cruelly debarred  from the privilege of getting drunk, but once a voter, he can luxuriate  in corn-juice and the calaboose, as well as his white brother. What a  travesty upon American civilization and politics!    Muggs was prejudiced against the Osages, having been induced by one of  them to invest in a bow and arrows, \"for the Hinglish Museum, you know.\"  On pulling for a trial shot, one end of the bow went further than the  arrow, and the cord, warranted to be buffalo sinew, proved to be an  oiled string.    Sachem declared that he had found Muggs returning the wreck to the  Indian with the following speech: \"O-sage, little was your wisdom to  court thus the wrath of a Briton. Take with the two pieces this piece of  my mind. That your noble form may be removed soon to the 'appy 'unting  ground, where bow trades are not allowed, is the prayer of your patron,  Muggs.\"    [Illustration: _BUREAU OF ILLUSTRATION. BUFFALO. N. Y._    UNNATURALIZED.]    [Illustration: _BUREAU OF ILLUSTRATION. BUFFALO. N. Y._    NATURALIZED.]    Mr. Colon asked Tenacious Gripe to explain the condition of the  Native Americans in Kansas. The orator kindly consented and thereupon  discoursed as follows:    \"The Indians of Kansas are divided into the wild and the tame. Both  alike cover their nakedness with bright handkerchiefs, old shirts,  military coats, and many-hued ribbons. The principal difference in point  of dress is in the method of procuring it. Among those tribes which are  at peace with the government, the white man robs the Indian; among the  wild tribes the conditions are reversed--the Indian robs the white man.  In the one case the contractors and agents carry off their half million  dollars or thereabouts; in the other the savage bears away a quantity of  old clothes and fresh scalps. As he finds it difficult to procure  sufficient of the white man's justice to satisfy the cravings of his  nature, he feeds it with what he can and whenever he can of revenge.  Wise men tell us, gentlemen, that revenge is sweet and justice a dry  morsel. All Indians beg when they get an opportunity. The tame ones, if  they find it fruitless, divert themselves by selling worthless pieces of  wood with strings attached, as bows. The wild ones, in a like  predicament, relieve their tedium by whacking away at our ribs with bows  that amount to something. The principles actuating both classes are  alike. It is simply the application which causes difficulty--in the one  case an appeal with bow and arrows to our pockets, in the other to our  bodies.    \"All our wars with these people, gentlemen, are a result of their  political economy. They believe that the Great Spirit provided buffalo  and other game for his red children. When the white man drives these  away, they understand that he takes their place as a means of  sustenance, and as they have lived upon the one, so they intend to do  upon the other. If the buffalo attempts to evade his duty in the  premises, they kill him and take his meat; if the white man, they kill  him and take his hair.\"    Sachem produced a roll of dirty brown paper and said that he had studied  the Indian question and found two sides to it. One he could give us in a  nutshell, believing that the meat of the nut had often excited the  spirit of war.      Where waters sung above the sand,      And torrent forced its way,    Stretched out, disgusted with the land,      A bearded miner lay,    Prepared to strike, with willing hand,      Whatever lead would pay.      Echo of hoof on beaten ground      Rung on the desert air,    Ringing a tune of gladsome sound      To miner, watching there;    A paying lead, at last, he'd found--      The vein a \"man of hair.\"      An instant more, and at the ford      A savage chief appeared;    The miner saw his goodly hoard,      And tore his own good beard.    (You'll always find an ox is gored      When sheep are to be sheared.)    [Illustration: Dog Town--The Happy Family at Home.]    [Illustration: _BUREAU OF ILLUSTRATION_    \"You've riled that Brook\"--An old Fable modernized.]      And these the words the miner said:      \"You've spoilt my drink, old fellow;    You've riled the brook, my brother red,      And, by your cheek so yellow,    To-night above your sandy bed      The prairie gale shall bellow.      \"No relatives of mine are dead,      At least by Injun cunnin',    But many other hearts have bled,      And many eyes are runnin';    For blood and tears alike are shed,      When _you_ go out a gunnin'.      \"Some slumbrin' peaceful, first they knew,      They heard your horrid din--    Women as well as men you slew,      You bloody son of sin;    I mourn 'em all, revenge 'em too,      Through Adam they were kin.\"      This having said, the miner smart,      Drew bead upon the red man:    They're fond of beads--it touched his heart,      And Lo, behold, a dead man;    Upon Life's stage he'd played his part,      A gory sort of head man!
