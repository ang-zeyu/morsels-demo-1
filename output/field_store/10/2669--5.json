And after  all it is most likely that he will turn to our stock to seek for  friends.\"    After that they left off speaking of the matter.  Gunnar showed  Njal the money, and he said, \"The suit has gone off well.\"    \"Ay,\" says Gunnar, \"but it was all thy doing.\"    Now men rode home from the Thing, and Gunnar got very great  honour from the suit.  Gunnar handed over all the money to Unna,  and would have none of it, but said he thought he ought to look  more for help from her and her kin hereafter than from other men.  She said, so it should be.        25. UNNA'S SECOND WEDDING    There was a man named Valgard, he kept house at Hof by Rangriver,  he was the son of Jorund the Priest, and his brother was Wolf  Aurpriest (1).  Those brothers, Wolf Aurpriest, and Valgard the  Guileful, set off to woo Unna, and she gave herself away to  Valgard without the advice of any of her kinsfolk.  But Gunnar  and Njal, and many others thought ill of that, for he was a  cross-grained man and had few friends.  They begot between them a  son, whose name was Mord, and he is long in this story.  When he  was grown to man's estate, he worked ill to his kinsfolk but  worst of all to Gunnar.  He was a crafty man in his temper, but  spiteful in his counsels.    Now we will name Njal's sons.  Skarphedinn was the eldest of  them.  He was a tall man in growth, and strong withal; a good  swordsman; he could swim like a seal, the swiftest-looted of men,  and bold and dauntless; he had a great flow of words and quick  utterance; a good skald too; but still for the most part he kept  himself well in hand; his hair was dark brown, with crisp curly  locks; he had good eyes; his features were sharp, and his face  ashen pale, his nose turned up and his front teeth stuck out, and  his mouth was very ugly.  Still he was the most soldierlike of  men.    Grim was the name of Njal's second son.  He was fair of face and  wore his hair long.  His hair was dark, and he was comelier to  look on than Skarphedinn.  A tall strong man.    Helgi was the name of Njal's third son.  He too was fair of face  and had fine hair.  He was a strong man and well-skilled in arms.  He was a man of sense and knew well how to behave.  They were all  unwedded at that time, Njal's sons.    Hauskuld was the fourth of Njal's sons.  He was baseborn.  His  mother was Rodny, and she was Hauskuld's daughter, the sister of  Ingialld of the Springs.    Njal asked Skarphedinn one day if he would take to himself a  wife.  He bade his father settle the matter.  Then Njal asked for  his hand Thorhilda, the daughter of Ranvir of Thorolfsfell, and  that was why they had another homestead there after that.  Skarphedinn got Thorhilda, but he stayed still with his father to  the end.  Grim wooed Astrid of Deepback; she was a widow and very  wealthy.  Grim got her to wife, and yet lived on with Njal.      ENDNOTES:    (1)  The son of Ranveig the Silly, the son of Valgard, the son of       Aefar, the son of Vemund Wordstopper, the son of Thorolf       Hooknose, the son of Thrand the Old, the son of Harold       Hilditann, the son of Hraereck Ringscatterer.  The mother of       Harold Hilditann, was Aud the daughter of Ivar Widefathom,       the son of Halfdan the Clever.  The brother of Valgard the       Guileful was Wolf Aurpriest -- from whom the Pointdwellers       sprung -- Wolf Aurpriest was the father of Swart, the father       of Lodmund, the father of Sigfus, the father of Saemund the       Wise.  But from Valgard is sprung Kolbein the Young.        26. OF ASGRIM AND HIS CHILDREN    There was a man named Asgrim (1).  He was Ellidagrim's son.  The  brother of Asgrim Ellidagrim's son was Sigfus (2).  Gauk  Trandil's son was Asgrim's foster-brother, who is said to have  been the fairest man of his day, and best skilled in all things;  but matters went ill with them, for Asgrim slew Gauk.    Asgrim had two sons, and each of them was named Thorhall.  They  were both hopeful men.  Grim was the name of another of Asgrim's  sons, and Thorhalla was his daughter's name.  She was the fairest  of women, and well behaved.    Njal came to talk with his son Helgi, and said, \"I have thought  of a match for thee, if thou wilt follow my advice.\"    \"That I will surely,\" says he, \"for I know that thou both meanest  me well, and canst do well for me; but whither hast thou turned  thine eyes.\"    \"We will go and woo Asgrim Ellidagrim's son's daughter, for that  is the best choice we can make.\"      ENDNOTES:    (1)  Ellidagrim was Asgrim's son, Aundot the Crow's son.  His       mother's name was Jorunn, and she was the daughter of Teit,       the son of Kettlebjorn the Old of Mossfell.  The mother of       Teit was Helga, daughter of Thord Skeggi's son, Hrapp's son,       Bjorn's son the Roughfooted, Grim's son, the Lord of Sogn in       Norway.  The mother of Jorunn was Olof Harvest-heal,       daughter of Bodvar, Viking-Kari's son.  (2)  His daughter was Thorgerda, mother of Sigfus, the father of       Saemund the Learned.        27. HELGI NJAL'S SON'S WOOING    A little after they rode out across Thurso water, and fared till  they came into Tongue.  Asgrim was at home, and gave them a  hearty welcome; and they were there that night.  Next morning  they began to talk, and then Njal raised the question of the  wooing, and asked for Thorhalla for his son Helgi's hand.  Asgrim  answered that well, and said there were no men with whom he would  be more willing to make this bargain than with them.  They fell  a-talking then about terms, and the end of it was that Asgrim  betrothed his daughter to Helgi, and the bridal day was named.  Gunnar was at that feast, and many other of the bestmen.  After  the feast Njal offered to foster in his house Thorhall, Asgrim's  son, and he was with Njal long after.  He loved Njal more than  his own father.  Njal taught him law, so that he became the  greatest lawyer in Iceland in those days.        28. HALLVARD COMES OUT TO ICELAND    There came a ship out from Norway, and ran into Arnbael's Oyce  (1), and the master of the ship was Hallvard the White, a man  from the Bay (2).  He went to stay at Lithend, and was with  Gunnar that winter, and was always asking him to fare abroad with  him.  Gunnar spoke little about it, but yet said more unlikely  things might happen; and about spring he went over to  Bergthorsknoll to find out from Njal whether he thought it a wise  step in him to go abroad.    \"I think it is wise,\" says Njal; \"they will think thee there an  honourable man, as thou art.\"    \"Wilt thou perhaps take my goods into thy keeping while I am  away, for I wish my brother Kolskegg to fare with me; but I would  that thou shouldst see after my household along with my mother.\"    \"I will not throw anything in the way of that,\" says Njal; \"lean  on me in this thing as much as thou likest.\"    \"Good go with thee for thy words,\" says Gunnar, and he rides  then home.    The Easterling (3) fell again to talk with Gunnar that he should  fare abroad.  Gunnar asked if he had ever sailed to other lands?  He said he had sailed to every one of them that lay between  Norway and Russia, and so, too, I have sailed to Biarmaland (4).    \"Wilt thou sail with me eastward ho?\" says Gunnar.    \"That I will of a surety,\" says he.    Then Gunnar made up his mind to sail abroad with him.  Njal took  all Gunnar's goods into his keeping.

The name also applies to       the land round the Bay, which thus formed a district, the       boundary of which, on the one side, was the promontory       called Lindesnaes, or the Naze, and on the other, the       Gota-Elf, the river on which the Swedish town of Gottenburg       stands, and off the mouth of which lies the island of       Hisingen, mentioned shortly after.

GUNNAR GOES ABROAD    So Gunnar fared abroad, and Kolskegg with him.  They sailed first  to Tonsberg (1), and were there that winter.  There had then been  a shift of rulers in Norway.  Harold Grayfell was then dead, and  so was Gunnhillda.  Earl Hacon the Bad, Sigurd's son, Hacon's  son, Gritgarth's son, then ruled the realm.  The mother of Hacon  was Bergliot, the daughter of Earl Thorir.  Her mother was Olof  Harvest-heal.  She was Harold Fair-hair's daughter.    Hallvard asks Gunnar if he would make up his mind to go to Earl  Hacon?    \"No; I will not do that,\" says Gunnar.  \"Hast thou ever a long-  ship?\"    \"I have two,\" he says.    \"Then I would that we two went on warfare; and let us get men to  go with us.\"    \"I will do that,\" says Hallvard.    After that they went to the Bay, and took with them two ships,  and fitted them out thence.  They had good choice of men, for  much praise was said of Gunnar.    \"Whither wilt thou first fare?\" says Gunnar.    \"I wish to go south-east to Hisingen, to see my kinsman Oliver,\"  says Hallvard.    \"What dost thou want of him?\" says Gunnar.    He answered, \"He is a fine brave fellow, and he will be sure to  get us some more strength for our voyage.\"    \"Then let us go thither,\" says Gunnar.    So, as soon as they were \"boun,\" they held on east to Hisingen,  and had there a hearty welcome.  Gunnar had only been there a  short time ere Oliver made much of him.  Oliver asks about his  voyage, and Hallvard says that Gunnar wishes to go a-warfaring to  gather goods for himself.    \"There's no use thinking of that,\" says Oliver, \"when ye"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/599"],[0,"Vanity Fair (#10)"],[1," did.\"    \"Because you have a kind heart, Mr. Joseph; all the Sedleys have, I  think.\"    \"It kept me awake last night, and I was trying to hum it this morning,  in bed; I was, upon my honour.  Gollop, my doctor, came in at eleven  (for I'm a sad invalid, you know, and see Gollop every day), and, 'gad!  there I was, singing away like--a robin.\"    \"O you droll creature! Do let me hear you sing it.\"    \"Me? No, you, Miss Sharp; my dear Miss Sharp, do sing it.\"  \"Not now,  Mr. Sedley,\" said Rebecca, with a sigh.  \"My spirits are not equal to  it; besides, I must finish the purse.  Will you help me, Mr. Sedley?\"  And before he had time to ask how, Mr. Joseph Sedley, of the East India  Company's service, was actually seated tete-a-tete with a young lady,  looking at her with a most killing expression; his arms stretched out  before her in an imploring attitude, and his hands bound in a web of  green silk, which she was unwinding.    In this romantic position Osborne and Amelia found the interesting  pair, when they entered to announce that tiffin was ready.  The skein  of silk was just wound round the card; but Mr. Jos had never spoken.    \"I am sure he will to-night, dear,\" Amelia said, as she pressed  Rebecca's hand; and Sedley, too, had communed with his soul, and said  to himself, \"'Gad, I'll pop the question at Vauxhall.\"        CHAPTER V    Dobbin of Ours    Cuff's fight with Dobbin, and the unexpected issue of that contest,  will long be remembered by every man who was educated at Dr.  Swishtail's famous school.  The latter Youth (who used to be called  Heigh-ho Dobbin, Gee-ho Dobbin, and by many other names indicative of  puerile contempt) was the quietest, the clumsiest, and, as it seemed,  the dullest of all Dr. Swishtail's young gentlemen. His parent was a  grocer in the city: and it was bruited abroad that he was admitted into  Dr. Swishtail's academy upon what are called \"mutual principles\"--that  is to say, the expenses of his board and schooling were defrayed by his  father in goods, not money; and he stood there--most at the bottom of  the school--in his scraggy corduroys and jacket, through the seams of  which his great big bones were bursting--as the representative of so  many pounds of tea, candles, sugar, mottled-soap, plums (of which a  very mild proportion was supplied for the puddings of the  establishment), and other commodities.  A dreadful day it was for young  Dobbin when one of the youngsters of the school, having run into the  town upon a poaching excursion for hardbake and polonies, espied the  cart of Dobbin & Rudge, Grocers and Oilmen, Thames Street, London, at  the Doctor's door, discharging a cargo of the wares in which the firm  dealt.    Young Dobbin had no peace after that.  The jokes were frightful, and  merciless against him.  \"Hullo, Dobbin,\" one wag would say, \"here's  good news in the paper.  Sugars is ris', my boy.\" Another would set a  sum--\"If a pound of mutton-candles cost sevenpence-halfpenny, how much  must Dobbin cost?\" and a roar would follow from all the circle of young  knaves, usher and all, who rightly considered that the selling of goods  by retail is a shameful and infamous practice, meriting the contempt  and scorn of all real gentlemen.    \"Your father's only a merchant, Osborne,\" Dobbin said in private to the  little boy who had brought down the storm upon him.  At which the  latter replied haughtily, \"My father's a gentleman, and keeps his  carriage\"; and Mr. William Dobbin retreated to a remote outhouse in the  playground, where he passed a half-holiday in the bitterest sadness and  woe.  Who amongst us is there that does not recollect similar hours of  bitter, bitter childish grief? Who feels injustice; who shrinks before  a slight; who has a sense of wrong so acute, and so glowing a gratitude  for kindness, as a generous boy? and how many of those gentle souls do  you degrade, estrange, torture, for the sake of a little loose  arithmetic, and miserable dog-latin?    Now, William Dobbin, from an incapacity to acquire the rudiments of the  above language, as they are propounded in that wonderful book the Eton  Latin Grammar, was compelled to remain among the very last of Doctor  Swishtail's scholars, and was \"taken down\" continually by little  fellows with pink faces and pinafores when he marched up with the lower  form, a giant amongst them, with his downcast, stupefied look, his  dog's-eared primer, and his tight corduroys.  High and low, all made  fun of him.  They sewed up those corduroys, tight as they were. They  cut his bed-strings.  They upset buckets and benches, so that he might  break his shins over them, which he never failed to do.  They sent him  parcels, which, when opened, were found to contain the paternal soap  and candles.  There was no little fellow but had his jeer and joke at  Dobbin; and he bore everything quite patiently, and was entirely dumb  and miserable.    Cuff, on the contrary, was the great chief and dandy of the Swishtail  Seminary.  He smuggled wine in.  He fought the town-boys. Ponies used  to come for him to ride home on Saturdays.  He had his top-boots in his  room, in which he used to hunt in the holidays.  He had a gold  repeater: and took snuff like the Doctor.  He had been to the Opera,  and knew the merits of the principal actors, preferring Mr. Kean to Mr.  Kemble.  He could knock you off forty Latin verses in an hour.  He  could make French poetry. What else didn't he know, or couldn't he do?  They said even the Doctor himself was afraid of him.    Cuff, the unquestioned king of the school, ruled over his subjects, and  bullied them, with splendid superiority. This one blacked his shoes:  that toasted his bread, others would fag out, and give him balls at  cricket during whole summer afternoons.  \"Figs\" was the fellow whom he  despised most, and with whom, though always abusing him, and sneering  at him, he scarcely ever condescended to hold personal communication.    One day in private, the two young gentlemen had had a difference. Figs,  alone in the schoolroom, was blundering over a home letter; when Cuff,  entering, bade him go upon some message, of which tarts were probably  the subject.    \"I can't,\" says Dobbin; \"I want to finish my letter.\"    \"You CAN'T?\" says Mr. Cuff, laying hold of that document (in which many  words were scratched out, many were mis-spelt, on which had been spent  I don't know how much thought, and labour, and tears; for the poor  fellow was writing to his mother, who was fond of him, although she was  a grocer's wife, and lived in a back parlour in Thames Street).  \"You  CAN'T?\" says Mr. Cuff: \"I should like to know why, pray? Can't you  write to old Mother Figs to-morrow?\"    \"Don't call names,\" Dobbin said, getting off the bench very nervous.    \"Well, sir, will you go?\" crowed the cock of the school.    \"Put down the letter,\" Dobbin replied; \"no gentleman readth letterth.\"    \"Well, NOW will you go?\" says the other.    \"No, I won't.  Don't strike, or I'll THMASH you,\" roars out Dobbin,  springing to a leaden inkstand, and looking so wicked, that Mr. Cuff  paused, turned down his coat sleeves again, put his hands into his  pockets, and walked away with a sneer.  But he never meddled personally  with the grocer's boy after that; though we must do him the justice to  say he always spoke of Mr. Dobbin with contempt behind his back.    Some time after this interview, it happened that Mr. Cuff, on a  sunshiny afternoon, was in the neighbourhood of poor William Dobbin,  who was lying under a tree in the playground, spelling over a favourite  copy of the Arabian Nights which he had apart from the rest of the  school, who were pursuing their various sports--quite lonely, and  almost happy.  If people would but leave children to themselves; if  teachers would cease to bully them; if parents would not insist upon  directing their thoughts, and dominating their feelings--those feelings  and thoughts which are a mystery to all (for how much do you and I know  of each other, of our children, of our fathers, of our neighbour, and  how far more beautiful and sacred are the thoughts of the poor lad or  girl whom you govern likely to be, than those of the dull and  world-corrupted person who rules him?)--if, I say, parents and masters  would leave their children alone a little more, small harm would  accrue, although a less quantity of as in praesenti might be acquired.    Well, William Dobbin had for once forgotten the world, and was away  with Sindbad the Sailor in the Valley of Diamonds, or with Prince Ahmed  and the Fairy Peribanou in that delightful cavern where the Prince  found her, and whither we should all like to make a tour; when shrill  cries, as of a little fellow weeping, woke up his pleasant reverie; and  looking up, he saw Cuff before him, belabouring a little boy.    It was the lad who had peached upon him about the grocer's cart; but he  bore little malice, not at least towards the young and small. \"How dare  you, sir, break the bottle?\" says Cuff to the little urchin, swinging a  yellow cricket-stump over him.    The boy had been instructed to get over the playground wall (at a  selected spot where the broken glass had been removed from the top, and  niches made convenient in the brick); to run a quarter of a mile; to  purchase a pint of rum-shrub on credit; to brave all the Doctor's  outlying spies, and to clamber back into the playground again; during  the performance of which feat, his foot had slipt, and the bottle was  broken, and the shrub had been spilt, and his pantaloons had been  damaged, and he appeared before his employer a perfectly guilty and  trembling, though harmless, wretch.    \"How dare you, sir, break it?\" says Cuff; \"you blundering little thief.  You drank the shrub, and now you pretend to have broken the bottle.  Hold out your hand, sir.\"    Down came the stump with a great heavy thump on the child's hand.  A  moan followed.  Dobbin looked up. The Fairy "]]]
