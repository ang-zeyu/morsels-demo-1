ERRORS TO BE CORRECTED.      A fellow was arrested with short hair.    I saw a man digging a well with a Roman nose.    He died and went to his rest in New York.    Wanted--A room by two gentlemen thirty feet long and twenty feet wide.    Some garments were made for the family of thick material.    The vessel was beautifully painted with a tall mast.    I perceived that it had been scoured with half an eye.    A house was built by a mason of brown stone.    A pearl was found by a sailor in a shell.    Punctuate these sentences when corrected.    +Caution+.--Care must be taken to select the right preposition.    +To the Teacher+.--For the preposition to be used, consult the Unabridged  Dictionaries.    ERRORS TO BE CORRECTED.      They halted with the river on their backs.    The cat jumped on the chair.    He fell onto the floor.    He went in the house.    He divides his property between his four sons.    He died for thirst.    This is different to that.    Two thieves divided the booty among themselves.

The pupil will notice that _animal_, in sentence No. 2, is an _attribute  complement_, though it is not an adjective expressing a quality belonging  to man, but a noun denoting his class. +_Nouns_+ then may be +_attribute  compliments_+.    The pupil will notice also that some of the _object_ and _attribute  complements_ above have phrase modifiers.          LESSON 43.    SENTENCE-BUILDING.    Using the following predicates, build sentences having subjects,  predicates, and object complements with or without modifiers.    ---- climb ----; ---- hunt ----; ---- command ----; ---- attacked  ----; ---- pursued ----; ---- shall receive ----; ---- have seen ----;  ---- love ----.    Change the following expressions into sentences by _asserting_ the  qualities here _assumed_. Use these verbs for predicates:    Is, were, appears, may be, became, was, have been, should have been, is  becoming, are.    +Model+.--_Heavy_ gold.    Gold _is heavy_.    Green fields; sweet oranges; interesting story; brilliant sunrise; severe  punishment; playful kittens; warm weather; pitiful sight; sour grapes;  amusing anecdote.    Prefix to the following nouns several adjectives expressing qualities, and  then make complete sentences by _asserting_ the same qualities.              white   |          Chalk _is white_.  +Model+.--brittle + chalk.

Lopez de Aguirre, or as he is still called by the common people, the  Tyrant, was killed at Barquesimeto, after having been abandoned by his  own men. At the moment when he fell, he plunged a dagger into the  bosom of his only daughter, \"that she might not have to blush before  the Spaniards at the name of the daughter of a traitor.\" The soul of  the tyrant (such is the belief of the natives) wanders in the  savannahs, like a flame that flies the approach of men.* (* See volume  1 chapter 1.4.)    The second historical event connected with the name of Valencia is the  great incursion made by the Caribs of the Orinoco in 1578 and 1580.  That cannibal horde went up the banks of the Guarico, crossing the  plains or llanos. They were happily repulsed by the valour of Garcia  Gonzales, one of the captains whose names are still most revered in  those provinces. It is gratifying to recollect, that the descendants  of those very Caribs now live in the missions as peaceable husbandmen,  and that no savage nation of Guiana dares to cross the plains which  separate the region of the forests from that of cultivated land. The  Cordillera of the coast is intersected by several ravines, very  uniformly directed from south-east to north-west. This phenomenon is  general from the Quebrada of Tocume, between Petares and Caracas, as  far as Porto Cabello. It would seem as if the impulsion had everywhere  come from the south-east; and this fact is the more striking, as the  strata of gneiss and mica-slate in the Cordillera of the coast are  generally directed from the south-west to the north-east. Most of  these ravines penetrate into the mountains at their southern  declivity, without crossing them entirely. But there is an opening  (abra) on the meridian of Nueva Valencia, which leads towards the  coast, and by which a cooling sea-breeze penetrates every evening into  the valleys of Aragua. This breeze rises regularly two or three hours  after sunset.    By this abra, the farm of Barbula, and an eastern branch of the  ravine, a new road is being constructed from Valencia to Porto  Cabello. It will be so short, that it will require only four hours to  reach the port; and the traveller will be able to go and return in the  same day from the coast to the valleys of Aragua. In order to examine  this road, we set out on the 26th of February in the evening for the  farm of Barbula.    On the morning of the 27th we visited the hot springs of La Trinchera,  three leagues from Valencia. The ravine is very large, and the descent  almost continual from the banks of the lake to the sea-coast. La  Trinchera takes its name from some fortifications of earth, thrown up  in 1677 by the French buccaneers, who sacked the town of Valencia. The  hot springs (and this is a remarkable geological fact,) do not issue  on the south side of the mountains, like those of Mariara, Onoto, and  the Brigantine; but they issue from the chain itself almost at its  northern declivity. They are much more abundant than any we had till  then seen, forming a rivulet which, in times of the greatest drought,  is two feet deep and eighteen wide. The temperature of the water,  measured with great care, was 90.3 degrees of the centigrade  thermometer. Next to the springs of Urijino, in Japan, which are  asserted to be pure water at 100 degrees of temperature, the waters of  the Trinchera of Porto Cabello appear to be the hottest in the world.  We breakfasted near the spring; eggs plunged into the water were  boiled in less than four minutes. These waters, strongly charged with  sulphuretted hydrogen, gush out from the back of a hill rising one  hundred and fifty feet above the bottom of the ravine, and tending  from south-south-east to north-north-west. The rock from which the  springs gush, is a real coarse-grained granite, resembling that of the  Rincon del Diablo, in the mountains of Mariara. Wherever the waters  evaporate in the air, they form sediments and incrustations of  carbonate of lime; possibly they traverse strata of primitive  limestone, so common in the mica-slate and gneiss of the coasts of  Caracas. We were surprised at the luxuriant vegetation that surrounds  the basin; mimosas with slender pinnate leaves, clusias, and  fig-trees, have pushed their roots into the bottom of a pool, the  temperature of which is 85 degrees; and the branches of these trees  extended over the surface of the water, at two or three inches  distance. The foliage of the mimosas, though constantly enveloped in  the hot vapours, displayed the most beautiful verdure. An arum, with a  woody stem, and with large sagittate leaves, rose in the very middle  of a pool the temperature of which was 70 degrees. Plants of the same  species vegetate in other parts of those mountains at the brink of  torrents, the temperature of which is not 18 degrees. What is still  more singular, forty feet distant from the point whence the springs  gush out at a temperature of 90 degrees, other springs are found  perfectly cold. They all follow for some time a parallel direction;  and the natives showed us that, by digging a hole between the two  rivulets, they could procure a bath of any given temperature they  pleased. It seems remarkable, that in the hottest as well as the  coldest climates, people display the same predilection for heat. On  the introduction of Christianity into Iceland, the inhabitants would  be baptized only in the hot springs of Hecla: and in the torrid zone,  in the plains, as well as on the Cordilleras, the natives flock from  all parts to the thermal waters. The sick, who come to La Trinchera to  use vapour-baths, form a sort of frame-work over the spring with  branches of trees and very slender reeds. They stretch themselves  naked on this frame, which appeared to me to possess little strength,  and to be dangerous of access. The Rio de Aguas Calientes runs towards  the north-east, and becomes, near the coast, a considerable river,  swarming with great crocodiles, and contributing, by its inundations,  to the insalubrity of the shore.    We descended towards Porto Cabello, having constantly the river of hot  water on our right. The road is extremely picturesque, and the waters  roll down on the shelves of rock. We might have fancied we were gazing  on the cascades of the Reuss, that flows down Mount St. Gothard; but  what a contrast in the vigour and richness of the vegetation! The  white trunks of the cecropia rise majestically amid bignonias and  melastomas. They do not disappear till we are within a hundred toises  above the level of the ocean. A small thorny palm-tree extends also to  this limit; the slender pinnate leaves of which look as if they had  been curled toward the edges. This tree is very common in these  mountains; but not having seen either its fruit or its flowers, we are  ignorant whether it be the piritu palm-tree of the Caribbees, or the  Cocos aculeata of Jacquin.    The rock on this road presents a geological phenomenon, the more  remarkable as the existence of real stratified granite has long been  disputed. Between La Trinchera and the Hato de Cambury a  coarse-grained granite appears, which, from the disposition of the  spangles of mica, collected in small groups, scarcely admits of  confounding with gneiss, or with rocks of a schistose texture. This  granite, divided into ledges of two or three feet thick, is directed  52 degrees north-east, and slopes to the north-west regularly at an  angle of from 30 or 40 degrees. The feldspar, crystallized in prisms  with four unequal sides, about an inch long, passes through every  variety of tint from a flesh-red to yellowish white. The mica, united  in hexagonal plates, is black, and sometimes green. The quartz  predominates in the mass; and is generally of a milky white. I  observed neither hornblende, black schorl, nor rutile titanite, in  this granite. In some ledges we recognised round masses, of a blackish  gray, very quartzose, and almost destitute of mica. They are from one  to two inches diameter; and are found in every zone, in all granite  mountains. These are not imbedded fragments, as at Greiffenstein in  Saxony, but aggregations of particles which seem to have been  subjected to partial attractions. I could not follow the line of  junction of the gneiss and granitic formations. According to angles  taken in the valleys of Aragua, the gneiss appears to descend below  the granite, which must consequently be of a more recent formation.  The appearance of a stratified granite excited my attention the more,  because, having had the direction of the mines of Fichtelberg in  Franconia for several years, I was accustomed to see granites divided  into ledges of three or four feet thick, but little inclined, and  forming masses like towers, or old ruins, at the summit of the highest  mountains.* (* At Ochsenkopf, at Rudolphstein, at Epprechtstein, at  Luxburg, and at Schneeberg. The dip of the strata of these granites of  Fichtelberg is generally only from 6 to 10 degrees, rarely (at  Schneeberg) 18 degrees. According to the dips I observed in the  neighbouring strata of gneiss and mica-slate, I should think that the  granite of Fichtelberg is very ancient, and serves as a basis for  other formations; but the strata of grunstein, and the disseminated  tin-ore which it contains, may lead us to doubt its great antiquity,  from the analogy of the granites of Saxony containing tin.)    The heat became stifling as we approached the coast. A reddish vapour  veiled the horizon. It was near sunset, and the breeze was not yet  stirring. We rested in the lonely farms known under the names of the  Hato de Cambury and the house of the Canarian (Casa del Isleno). The  river of hot water, along the banks of which we passed, became deeper.  A crocodile, more than"]]]
