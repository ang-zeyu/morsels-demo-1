The right man in the right place, you know. Square people  shouldn't try to get into round holes.\"    \"The woman's SQUARE enough!\" the Maluka interrupted; and Mac added, \"And  so is the HOLE,\" with a scornful emphasis on the word \"hole.\"    Dan chuckled, and surveyed the queer-looking building with new interest.    \"It reminds me of a banyan tree with corrugated-iron foliage,\" he said,  adding as he went into details, \"In a dim light the finished room would  pass for the trunk of the tree and the uprights for the supports of the  branches.\"    But the Maluka thought it looked more like a section of a mangrove  swamp, piles and all.    \"It looks very like a house nearly finished,\" I said severely; for,  because of the verandah and many promises, I was again hopeful for  something approaching that commodious station home. \"A few able-bodied  men could finish the dining-room in a couple of clays, and make a  mansion of the rest of the building in a week or so.\"    But the able-bodied men had a different tale to tell.        \"Steady! Go slow, missus!\" they cried. \"It may look like a house very  nearly finished, but out-bush, we have to catch our hares before we cook  them.\"    \"WE begin at the very beginning of things in the Never-Never,\" the  Maluka explained. \"Timber grows in trees in these parts, and has to be  coaxed out with a saw.\"    \"It's a bad habit it's got into,\" Dan chuckled; then pointing vaguely  towards the thickly wooded long Reach, that lay a mile to the south of  the homestead, beyond the grassy plain, he \"supposed the dining-room was  down there just now, with the rest of the House.\"    With fast-ebbing hopes I looked in dismay at the distant forest  undulating along the skyline, and the Maluka said sympathetically, \"It's  only too true, little un'.\"    But Dan disapproved of spoken sympathy under trying circumstances. \"It  keeps 'em from toeing the line\" he believed; and fearing I was on the  point of showing the white feather he broke in with: \"We'll have to keep  her toeing the line, Boss,\" and then pointed out that \"things might be  worse.\" \"In some countries there are no trees to cut down,\" he said.    \"That's the style,\" he added, when I began to laugh in spite of my  disappointment, \"We'll soon get you educated up to it.\"    But already the Sanguine Scot had found the bright side of the  situation, and reminded us that we were in the Land of Plenty of Time.  \"There's time enough for everything in the Never-Never,\" he said.  \"She'll have many a pleasant ride along the Reach choosing trees for  timber. Catching the hare's often the best part of the fun.\"    Mac's cheery optimism always carried all before it. Pleasant rides  through shady forest-ways seemed a fair recompense for a little delay;  and my spirits went up with a bound, to be dashed down again the next  moment by Dan.    \"We haven't got to the beginning of things yet,\" he interrupted,  following up the line of thought the Maluka had at first suggested.  \"Before any trees are cut down, we'll have to dig a saw-pit and find a  pit-sawyer.\" Dan was not a pessimist; he only liked to dig down to the  very root of things, besides objecting to sugar-coated pills as being a  hindrance to education.    But the Dandy had joined the group, and being practical, suggested  \"trying to get hold of little Johnny,\" declaring that \"he would make  things hum in no time.\"    Mac happened to know that Johnny was \"inside\" somewhere on a job, and  it was arranged that Dan should go in to the Katherine at once for nails  and \"things,\" and to see if the telegraph people could find out Johnny's  whereabouts down the line, and send him along.    But preparations for a week's journey take time, outbush, owing to that  necessity of beginning at the beginning of things. Fresh horses were  mustered, a mob of bullocks rounded up for a killer, swags and pack-bags  packed; and just as all was in readiness for the start, the Quiet  Stockman came in, bringing a small mob of colts with him.    \"I'm leaving,\" he announced in the Quarters; then, feeling some  explanation was necessary, added, \"I WAS thinking of it before this  happened.\" Strictly speaking, this may be true, although he omitted to  say that he had abandoned the idea for some little time.    No one was surprised, and no one thought of asking what had happened,  for Jack had always steered clear of women, as he termed it. Not that he  feared or disliked them, but because he considered that they had nothing  in common with men. \"They're such terrors for asking questions,\" he  said once, when pressed for an opinion, adding as an afterthought, \"They  never seem to learn much either,\" in his own quiet way, summing up  the average woman's conversation with a shy bushman: a long string of  purposeless questions, followed by inane remarks on the answers.    \"I'm leaving!\" Jack had said, and later met the Maluka unshaken in  his resolve. There was that in the Maluka, however, that Jack had not  calculated on a something that drew all men to him, and made Dan speak  of him in after-years as the \"best boss ever I struck\"; and although the  interview only lasted a few minutes, and the Maluka spoke only of the  work of the station, yet in those few minutes the Quiet Stockman changed  his mind, and the notice was never given.    \"I'm staying on,\" was all he said on returning to the Quarters; and  quick decisions being unusual with Jack, every one felt interested.    \"Going to give her a chance?\" Dan asked with a grin, and Jack looked  uncomfortable.    \"I've only seen the boss,\" he said.    Dan nodded with approval. \"You've got some sense left, then,\" he said,  \"if you know a good boss when you see one.\"    Jack agreed in monosyllables; but when Dan settled down to argue out the  advantages of having a woman about the place, he looked doubtful; but  having nothing to say on the subject, said nothing; and when Dan left  for the Katherine next morning he was still unconvinced.    Dan set out for the north track soon after sun-up, assuring us that he'd  get hold of Johnny somehow; and before sun-down a traveller crossed  the Creek below the billabong at the south track, and turned into the  homestead enclosure.    We were vaguely chatting on all and sundry matters, as we sat under the  verandah that faced the billabong, when the traveller came into sight.    \"Horse traveller!\" Mac said, lazily shading his eyes, and then sprang  to his feet with a yell. \"Talk of luck!\" he shouted. \"You'll do, missus!  Here's Johnny himself.\"      It was Johnny, sure enough; but Johnny had a cheque in his pocket, and  was yearning to see the \"chaps at the Katherine\"; and, after a good look  through the House and store, decided that he really would have to go in  to the Settlement for--tools and \"things.\"    \"I'll be back in a week, missus,\" he said next morning, as he gathered  his reins together before mounting, \"and then we shan't be long. Three  days in and three out, you know, bar accidents, and a day's spell at the  Katherine,\" he explained glibly. But the \"chaps at the Katherine\" proved  too entertaining for Johnny, and a fortnight passed before we saw him  again.        CHAPTER VII      The Quiet Stockman was a Scotchman, and, like many Scotchmen, a strange  contradiction of shy reserve and quiet, dignified self-assurance. Having  made up his mind on women in general, he saw no reason for changing it;  and as he went about his work, thoroughly and systematically avoided me.  There was no slinking round corners though; Jack couldn't slink. He had  always looked the whole world in the face with his honest blue eyes, and  could never do otherwise. He only took care that our paths did not cross  more often than was absolutely necessary; but when they did, his Scotch  dignity asserted itself, and he said what had to be said with quiet  self-possession, although he invariably moved away as soon as possible.    \"It's just Jack's way,\" the Sanguine Scot said, anxious that his fellow  Scot should not be misunderstood. \"He'll be all there if ever you need  him. He only draws the line at conversations.\"    But when I mounted the stockyard fence one morning, to see the  breaking-in of the colts, he looked as though he \"drew the line\" at that  too.    Fortunately for Jack's peace of mind, horse-breaking was not the only  novelty at the homestead. Only a couple of changes of everything, in a  tropical climate, meant an unbroken cycle of washing-days, while, apart  from that, Sam Lee was full of surprises, and the lubras' methods of  house-cleaning were novel in the extreme.    Sam was bland, amiable, and inscrutable, and obedient to irritation;  and the lubras were apt, and merry, and open-hearted, and wayward  beyond comprehension. Sam did exactly as he was told, and the lubras did  exactly as they thought fit, and the results were equally disconcerting.    Sam was asked for a glass of milk, and the lubras were told to scrub the  floor. Sam brought the milk immediately, and the lubras, after scrubbing  two or three isolated patches on the floor, went off on some frolic of  their own.    At afternoon tea there was no milk served. \"There was none,\" Sam  explained blandly. \"The missus had drunk it all. Missus bin finissem  milk all about,\" he said When the lubras were brought back, THEY said  THEY had \"knocked up longa scrub,\" and finished "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/470"],[0,"Heretics (#10)"],[1,"modern strife between nations, there would only be a  strife between Utopias.  For the highest thing does not tend to union  only; the highest thing, tends also to differentiation. You can often  get men to fight for the union; but you can never prevent them from  fighting also for the differentiation. This variety in the highest  thing is the meaning of the fierce patriotism, the fierce nationalism  of the great European civilization. It is also, incidentally, the  meaning of the doctrine of the Trinity.    But I think the main mistake of Mr. Wells's philosophy is a somewhat  deeper one, one that he expresses in a very entertaining manner in the  introductory part of the new Utopia.  His philosophy in some sense  amounts to a denial of the possibility of philosophy itself. At least,  he maintains that there are no secure and reliable ideas upon which we  can rest with a final mental satisfaction. It will be both clearer,  however, and more amusing to quote Mr. Wells himself.    He says, \"Nothing endures, nothing is precise and certain (except the  mind of a pedant)....  Being indeed!--there is no being, but a  universal becoming of individualities, and Plato turned his back on  truth when he turned towards his museum of specific ideals.\" Mr. Wells  says, again, \"There is no abiding thing in what we know. We change from  weaker to stronger lights, and each more powerful light pierces our  hitherto opaque foundations and reveals fresh and different opacities  below.\"  Now, when Mr. Wells says things like this, I speak with all  respect when I say that he does not observe an evident mental  distinction. It cannot be true that there is nothing abiding in what we  know. For if that were so we should not know it all and should not call  it knowledge.  Our mental state may be very different from that of  somebody else some thousands of years back; but it cannot be entirely  different, or else we should not be conscious of a difference. Mr.  Wells must surely realize the first and simplest of the paradoxes that  sit by the springs of truth.  He must surely see that the fact of two  things being different implies that they are similar. The hare and the  tortoise may differ in the quality of swiftness, but they must agree in  the quality of motion.  The swiftest hare cannot be swifter than an  isosceles triangle or the idea of pinkness. When we say the hare moves  faster, we say that the tortoise moves. And when we say of a thing that  it moves, we say, without need of other words, that there are things  that do not move. And even in the act of saying that things change, we  say that there is something unchangeable.    But certainly the best example of Mr. Wells's fallacy can be found in  the example which he himself chooses.  It is quite true that we see a  dim light which, compared with a darker thing, is light, but which,  compared with a stronger light, is darkness. But the quality of light  remains the same thing, or else we should not call it a stronger light  or recognize it as such. If the character of light were not fixed in  the mind, we should be quite as likely to call a denser shadow a  stronger light, or vice versa If the character of light became even for  an instant unfixed, if it became even by a hair's-breadth doubtful, if,  for example, there crept into our idea of light some vague idea of  blueness, then in that flash we have become doubtful whether the new  light has more light or less.  In brief, the progress may be as varying  as a cloud, but the direction must be as rigid as a French road. North  and South are relative in the sense that I am North of Bournemouth and  South of Spitzbergen.  But if there be any doubt of the position of the  North Pole, there is in equal degree a doubt of whether I am South of  Spitzbergen at all.  The absolute idea of light may be practically  unattainable.  We may not be able to procure pure light. We may not be  able to get to the North Pole.  But because the North Pole is  unattainable, it does not follow that it is indefinable. And it is only  because the North Pole is not indefinable that we can make a  satisfactory map of Brighton and Worthing.    In other words, Plato turned his face to truth but his back on Mr. H.  G. Wells, when he turned to his museum of specified ideals. It is  precisely here that Plato shows his sense.  It is not true that  everything changes; the things that change are all the manifest and  material things.  There is something that does not change; and that is  precisely the abstract quality, the invisible idea. Mr. Wells says  truly enough, that a thing which we have seen in one connection as dark  we may see in another connection as light. But the thing common to both  incidents is the mere idea of light--which we have not seen at all.  Mr. Wells might grow taller and taller for unending aeons till his head  was higher than the loneliest star. I can imagine his writing a good  novel about it.  In that case he would see the trees first as tall  things and then as short things; he would see the clouds first as high  and then as low. But there would remain with him through the ages in  that starry loneliness the idea of tallness; he would have in the awful  spaces for companion and comfort the definite conception that he was  growing taller and not (for instance) growing fatter.    And now it comes to my mind that Mr. H. G. Wells actually has written a  very delightful romance about men growing as tall as trees; and that  here, again, he seems to me to have been a victim of this vague  relativism.  \"The Food of the Gods\" is, like Mr. Bernard Shaw's play,  in essence a study of the Superman idea.  And it lies, I think, even  through the veil of a half-pantomimic allegory, open to the same  intellectual attack.  We cannot be expected to have any regard for a  great creature if he does not in any manner conform to our standards.  For unless he passes our standard of greatness we cannot even call him  great.  Nietszche summed up all that is interesting in the Superman  idea when he said, \"Man is a thing which has to be surpassed.\"  But the  very word \"surpass\" implies the existence of a standard common to us  and the thing surpassing us. If the Superman is more manly than men  are, of course they will ultimately deify him, even if they happen to  kill him first. But if he is simply more supermanly, they may be quite  indifferent to him as they would be to another seemingly aimless  monstrosity. He must submit to our test even in order to overawe us.  Mere force or size even is a standard; but that alone will never make  men think a man their superior.  Giants, as in the wise old  fairy-tales, are vermin.  Supermen, if not good men, are vermin.    \"The Food of the Gods\" is the tale of \"Jack the Giant-Killer\" told from  the point of view of the giant.  This has not, I think, been done  before in literature; but I have little doubt that the psychological  substance of it existed in fact.  I have little doubt that the giant  whom Jack killed did regard himself as the Superman. It is likely  enough that he considered Jack a narrow and parochial person who wished  to frustrate a great forward movement of the life-force. If (as not  unfrequently was the case) he happened to have two heads, he would  point out the elementary maxim which declares them to be better than  one.  He would enlarge on the subtle modernity of such an equipment,  enabling a giant to look at a subject from two points of view, or to  correct himself with promptitude. But Jack was the champion of the  enduring human standards, of the principle of one man one head and one  man one conscience, of the single head and the single heart and the  single eye. Jack was quite unimpressed by the question of whether the  giant was a particularly gigantic giant.  All he wished to know was  whether he was a good giant--that is, a giant who was any good to us.  What were the giant's religious views; what his views on politics and  the duties of the citizen?  Was he fond of children--or fond of them  only in a dark and sinister sense?  To use a fine phrase for emotional  sanity, was his heart in the right place? Jack had sometimes to cut him  up with a sword in order to find out. The old and correct story of Jack  the Giant-Killer is simply the whole story of man; if it were  understood we should need no Bibles or histories. But the modern world  in particular does not seem to understand it at all. The modern world,  like Mr. Wells is on the side of the giants; the safest place, and  therefore the meanest and the most prosaic. The modern world, when it  praises its little Caesars, talks of being strong and brave:  but it  does not seem to see the eternal paradox involved in the conjunction of  these ideas. The strong cannot be brave.  Only the weak can be brave;  and yet again, in practice, only those who can be brave can be trusted,  in time of doubt, to be strong.  The only way in which a giant could  really keep himself in training against the inevitable Jack would be by  continually fighting other giants ten times as big as himself. That is  by ceasing to be a giant and becoming a Jack. Thus that sympathy with  the small or the defeated as such, with which we Liberals and  Nationalists have been often reproached, is not a useless  sentimentalism at all, as Mr. Wells and his friends fancy.  It is the  first law of practical courage. To be in the weakest camp is to be in  the strongest school. Nor can I imagine anything that would do humanity  more good than the advent of a race of Supermen, for them to fight like  dragons. If the Superman is better than we, of course we need not fight  him; but in that case, why not call him the Saint?  But if he is merely  stronger (whether physically, mentally, or morally stronger, I do not  care a farthing), then he ought to have to reckon with us at least for  all the strength we have.  It we are weaker than he, that is no reason  why we should"]]]
