[Footnote: Compare LIBRI, _Histoire des sciences mathématiques en  Italie_. Tome III, p. 43.]    The function of the eye as explained by the camera obscura (70. 71).    70.    If the object in front of the eye sends its image to the eye, the  eye, on the other hand, sends its image to the object, and no  portion whatever of the object is lost in the images it throws off,  for any reason either in the eye or the object. Therefore we may  rather believe it to be the nature and potency of our luminous  atmosphere which absorbs the images of the objects existing in it,  than the nature of the objects, to send their images through the  air. If the object opposite to the eye were to send its image to the  eye, the eye would have to do the same to the object, whence it  might seem that these images were an emanation. But, if so, it would  be necessary [to admit] that every object became rapidly smaller;  because each object appears by its images in the surrounding  atmosphere. That is: the whole object in the whole atmosphere, and  in each part; and all the objects in the whole atmosphere and all of  them in each part; speaking of that atmosphere which is able to  contain in itself the straight and radiating lines of the images  projected by the objects. From this it seems necessary to admit that  it is in the nature of the atmosphere, which subsists between the  objects, and which attracts the images of things to itself like a  loadstone, being placed between them.    PROVE HOW ALL OBJECTS, PLACED IN ONE POSITION, ARE ALL EVERYWHERE  AND ALL IN EACH PART.    I say that if the front of a building--or any open piazza or  field--which is illuminated by the sun has a dwelling opposite to  it, and if, in the front which does not face the sun, you make a  small round hole, all the illuminated objects will project their  images through that hole and be visible inside the dwelling on the  opposite wall which may be made white; and there, in fact, they will  be upside down, and if you make similar openings in several places  in the same wall you will have the same result from each. Hence the  images of the illuminated objects are all everywhere on this wall  and all in each minutest part of it. The reason, as we clearly know,  is that this hole must admit some light to the said dwelling, and  the light admitted by it is derived from one or many luminous  bodies. If these bodies are of various colours and shapes the rays  forming the images are of various colours and shapes, and so will  the representations be on the wall.    [Footnote: 70. 15--23. This section has already been published in the  \"_Saggio delle Opere di Leonardo da Vinci_\" Milan 1872, pp. 13, 14.  G. Govi observes upon it, that Leonardo is not to be regarded as the  inventor of the Camera obscura, but that he was the first to explain  by it the structure of the eye. An account of the Camera obscura  first occurs in CESARE CESARINI's Italian version of Vitruvius, pub.  1523, four years after Leonardo's death. Cesarini expressly names  Benedettino Don Papnutio as the inventor of the Camera obscura. In  his explanation of the function of the eye by a comparison with the  Camera obscura Leonardo was the precursor of G. CARDANO, Professor  of Medicine at Bologna (died 1576) and it appears highly probable  that this is, in fact, the very discovery which Leonardo ascribes to  himself in section 21 without giving any further details.]    71.    HOW THE IMAGES OF OBJECTS RECEIVED BY THE EYE INTERSECT WITHIN THE  CRYSTALLINE HUMOUR OF THE EYE.    An experiment, showing how objects transmit their images or  pictures, intersecting within the eye in the crystalline humour, is  seen when by some small round hole penetrate the images of  illuminated objects into a very dark chamber. Then, receive these  images on a white paper placed within this dark room and rather near  to the hole and you will see all the objects on the paper in their  proper forms and colours, but much smaller; and they will be upside  down by reason of that very intersection. These images being  transmitted from a place illuminated by the sun will seem actually  painted on this paper which must be extremely thin and looked at  from behind. And let the little perforation be made in a very thin  plate of iron. Let _a b e d e_ be the object illuminated by the sun  and _o r_ the front of the dark chamber in which is the said hole at  _n m_. Let _s t_ be the sheet of paper intercepting the rays of the  images of these objects upside down, because the rays being  straight, _a_ on the right hand becomes _k_ on the left, and _e_ on  the left becomes _f_ on the right; and the same takes place inside  the pupil.    [Footnote: This chapter is already known through a translation into  French by VENTURI. Compare his '_Essai sur les ouvrages  physico-mathématiques de L. da Vinci avec des fragments tirés de ses  Manuscrits, apportés de l'Italie. Lu a la premiere classe de  l'Institut national des Sciences et Arts.' Paris, An V_ (1797).]    The practice of perspective (72. 73).    72.    In the practice of perspective the same rules apply to light and to  the eye.    73.    The object which is opposite to the pupil of the eye is seen by that  pupil and that which is opposite to the eye is seen by the pupil.    Refraction of the rays falling upon the eye (74. 75)    74.    The lines sent forth by the image of an object to the eye do not  reach the point within the eye in straight lines.    75.    If the judgment of the eye is situated within it, the straight lines  of the images are refracted on its surface because they pass through  the rarer to the denser medium. If, when you are under water, you  look at objects in the air you will see them out of their true  place; and the same with objects under water seen from the air.    The intersection of the rays (76-82).    76.    The inversion of the images.    All the images of objects which pass through a window [glass pane]  from the free outer air to the air confined within walls, are seen  on the opposite side; and an object which moves in the outer air  from east to west will seem in its shadow, on the wall which is  lighted by this confined air, to have an opposite motion.    77.    THE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH THE IMAGES OF BODIES PASS IN BETWEEN THE  MARGINS OF THE OPENINGS BY WHICH THEY ENTER.    What difference is there in the way in which images pass through  narrow openings and through large openings, or in those which pass  by the sides of shaded bodies? By moving the edges of the opening  through which the images are admitted, the images of immovable  objects are made to move. And this happens, as is shown in the 9th  which demonstrates: [Footnote 11: _per la 9a che dicie_. When  Leonardo refers thus to a number it serves to indicate marginal  diagrams; this can in some instances be distinctly proved. The ninth  sketch on the page W. L. 145 b corresponds to the middle sketch of  the three reproduced.] the images of any object are all everywhere,  and all in each part of the surrounding air. It follows that if one  of the edges of the hole by which the images are admitted to a dark  chamber is moved it cuts off those rays of the image that were in  contact with it and gets nearer to other rays which previously were  remote from it &c.    OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE EDGE AT THE RIGHT OR LEFT, OR THE UPPER, OR  LOWER EDGE.    If you move the right side of the opening the image on the left will  move [being that] of the object which entered on the right side of  the opening; and the same result will happen with all the other  sides of the opening. This can be proved by the 2nd of this which  shows: all the rays which convey the images of objects through the  air are straight lines. Hence, if the images of very large bodies  have to pass through very small holes, and beyond these holes  recover their large size, the lines must necessarily intersect.    [Footnote: 77. 2. In the first of the three diagrams Leonardo had  drawn only one of the two margins, et _m_.]    78.    Necessity has provided that all the images of objects in front of  the eye shall intersect in two places. One of these intersections is  in the pupil, the other in the crystalline lens; and if this were  not the case the eye could not see so great a number of objects as  it does. This can be proved, since all the lines which intersect do  so in a point. Because nothing is seen of objects excepting their  surface; and their edges are lines, in contradistinction to the  definition of a surface. And each minute part of a line is equal to  a point; for _smallest_ is said of that than which nothing can be  smaller, and this definition is equivalent to the definition of the  point. Hence it is possible for the whole circumference of a circle  to transmit its image to the point of intersection, as is shown in  the 4th of this which shows: all the smallest parts of the images  cross each other without interfering with each other. These  demonstrations are to illustrate the eye. No image, even of the  smallest object, enters the eye without being turned upside down;  but as it penetrates into the crystalline lens it is once more  reversed and thus the image is restored to the same position within  the eye as that of the object outside the eye.    79.    OF THE CENTRAL LINE OF THE EYE.    Only one line of the image, of all those that reach the visual  virtue, has no intersection; and this has no sensible dimensions  because it is a mathematical line which originates from a  mathematical point, which has no dimensions.    According to my adversary, necessity requires that the central line  of every image that enters by small and narrow openings into a dark  chamber shall be turned upside down, together with the images of the  bodies that surround it.    80.    AS TO WHETHER THE CENTRAL LINE OF THE IMAGE CAN BE INTERSECTED, OR  NOT, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50133"],[0,"The Dunwich Horror (#10)"],[1,"Morgan's had been.    \"Gawd almighty, the grass an' bushes is a-movin'! It's a-goin'  up--slow-like--creepin' up ter the top this minute, heaven only knows  what fer!\"    Then the germ of panic seemed to spread among the seekers. It was one  thing to chase the nameless entity, but quite another to find it.  Spells might be all right--but suppose they weren't? Voices began  questioning Armitage about what he knew of the thing, and no reply  seemed quite to satisfy. Everyone seemed to feel himself in close  proximity to phases of nature and of being utterly forbidden, and  wholly outside the sane experience of mankind.      10    In the end the three men from Arkham--old, white-bearded Dr.  Armitage, stocky, iron-gray Professor Rice, and lean, youngish Dr.  Morgan--ascended the mountain alone. After much patient instruction  regarding its focusing and use, they left the telescope with the  frightened group that remained in the road; and as they climbed they  were watched closely by those among whom the glass was passed around.  It was hard going, and Armitage had to be helped more than once. High  above the toiling group the great swath trembled as its hellish maker  repassed with snail-like deliberateness. Then it was obvious that the  pursuers were gaining.    Curtis Whateley--of the undecayed branch--was holding the telescope  when the Arkham party detoured radically from the swath. He told the  crowd that the men were evidently trying to get to a subordinate peak  which overlooked the swath at a point considerably ahead of where the  shrubbery was now bending. This, indeed, proved to be true; and the  party were seen to gain the minor elevation only a short time after the  invisible blasphemy had passed it.    Then Wesley Corey, who had taken the glass, cried out that Armitage was  adjusting the sprayer which Rice held, and that something must be about  to happen. The crowd stirred uneasily, recalling that this sprayer was  expected to give the unseen horror a moment of visibility. Two or three  men shut their eyes, but Curtis Whateley snatched back the telescope  and strained his vision to the utmost. He saw that Rice, from the  party's point of vantage above and behind the entity, had an excellent  chance of spreading the potent powder with marvelous effect.    Those without the telescope saw only an instant's flash of gray  cloud--a cloud about the size of a moderately large building--near the  top of the mountain. Curtis, who had held the instrument, dropped it  with a piercing shriek into the ankle-deep mud of the road. He reeled,  and would have crumpled to the ground had not two or three others  seized and steadied him. All he could do was moan half-inaudibly:    \"Oh, oh, great Gawd ... _that ... that_....\"    [Illustration: \"Oh, oh, great Gawd ... that ... that.\"]    There was a pandemonium of questioning, and only Henry Wheeler thought  to rescue the fallen telescope and wipe it clean of mud. Curtis was  past all coherence, and even isolated replies were almost too much for  him.    \"Bigger 'n a barn ... all made o' squirmin' ropes ... hull thing sort  o' shaped like a hen's egg bigger'n anything, with dozens o' legs like  hogsheads that haff shut up when they step ... nothin' solid abaout  it--all like jelly, an' made o' sep'rit wrigglin' ropes pushed clost  together ... great bulgin' eyes all over it ... ten or twenty maouths  or trunks a-stickin' aout all along the sides, big as stovepipes, an'  all a-tossin' an' openin' an' shuttin' ... all gray, with kinder blue  or purple rings ... _an' Gawd in Heaven--that haff face on top_!...\"    This final memory, whatever it was, proved too much for poor Curtis,  and he collapsed completely before he could say more. Fred Farr and  Will Hutchins carried him to the roadside and laid him on the damp  grass. Henry Wheeler, trembling, turned the rescued telescope on the  mountain to see what he might. Through the lenses were discernible  three tiny figures, apparently running toward the summit as fast as the  steep incline allowed. Only these--nothing more. Then everyone noticed  a strangely unseasonable noise in the deep valley behind, and even in  the underbrush of Sentinel Hill itself. It was the piping of unnumbered  whippoorwills, and in their shrill chorus there seemed to lurk a note  of tense and evil expectancy.    Earl Sawyer now took the telescope and reported the three figures as  standing on the topmost ridge, virtually level with the altar-stone  but at a considerable distance from it. One figure, he said, seemed  to be raising its hands above its head at rhythmic intervals; and  as Sawyer mentioned the circumstance the crowd seemed to hear a  faint, half-musical sound from the distance, as if a loud chant  were accompanying the gestures. The weird silhouette on that  remote peak must have been a spectacle of infinite grotesqueness  and impressiveness, but no observer was in a mood for esthetic  appreciation. \"I guess he's sayin' the spell,\" whispered Wheeler as  he snatched back the telescope. The whippoorwills were piping wildly,  and in a singularly curious irregular rhythm quite unlike that of the  visible ritual.    Suddenly the sunshine seemed to lessen without the intervention of any  discernible cloud. It was a very peculiar phenomenon, and was plainly  marked by all. A rumbling sound seemed brewing beneath the hills, mixed  strangely with a concordant rumbling which clearly came from the sky.  Lightning flashed aloft, and the wondering crowd looked in vain for  the portents of storm. The chanting of the men from Arkham now became  unmistakable, and Wheeler saw through the glass that they were all  raising their arms in the rhythmic incantation. From some farmhouse far  away came the frantic barking of dogs.    The change in the quality of the daylight increased, and the crowd  gazed about the horizon in wonder. A purplish darkness, born of  nothing more than a spectral deepening of the sky's blue, pressed down  upon the rumbling hills. Then the lightning flashed again, somewhat  brighter than before, and the crowd fancied that it had showed a  certain mistiness around the altar-stone on the distant height. No  one, however, had been using the telescope at that instant. The  whippoorwills continued their irregular pulsation, and the men of  Dunwich braced themselves tensely against some imponderable menace with  which the atmosphere seemed surcharged.    Without warning came those deep, cracked, raucous vocal sounds which  will never leave the memory of the stricken group who heard them. Not  from any human throat were they born, for the organs of man can yield  no such acoustic perversions. Rather would one have said they came  from the pit itself, had not their source been so unmistakably the  altar-stone on the peak. It is almost erroneous to call them _sounds_  at all, since so much of their ghastly, infra-bass timbre spoke to  dim seats of consciousness and terror far subtler than the ear; yet  one must do so, since their form was indisputably though vaguely that  of half-articulate _words_. They were loud--loud as the rumblings and  the thunder above which they echoed--yet did they come from no visible  being. And because imagination might suggest a conjectural source in  the world of non-visible beings, the huddled crowd at the mountain's  base huddled still closer, and winced as if in expectation of a blow.    \"_Ygnaiih ... ygnaiih ... thflthkh'ngha ... Yog-Sothoth...._\" rang the  hideous croaking out of space. \"_Y'bthnk ... h'ehye ... n'grkdl'lh...._\"    The speaking impulse seemed to falter here, as if some frightful  psychic struggle were going on. Henry Wheeler strained his eye at  the telescope, but saw only the three grotesquely silhouetted human  figures on the peak, all moving their arms furiously in strange  gestures as their incantation drew near its culmination. From what  black wells of Acherontic fear or feeling, from what unplumbed gulfs of  extra-cosmic consciousness or obscure, long-latent heredity, were those  half-articulate thunder-croakings drawn? Presently they began to gather  renewed force and coherence as they grew in stark, utter, ultimate  frenzy.    \"_Eh-ya-ya-ya-yahaah ... e'yaya-yayaaaa ... ngh'aaaa ... ngh'aaaa_ ...  h'yuh ... h'yuh ... HELP! HELP! ... _ff--ff--ff_--FATHER! FATHER!  YOG-SOTHOTH!...\"    But that was all. The pallid group in the road, still reeling at  the _indisputably English_ syllables that had poured thickly and  thunderously down from the frantic vacancy beside that shocking  altar-stone, were never to hear such syllables again. Instead, they  jumped violently at the terrific report which seemed to rend the hills;  the deafening, cataclysmic peal whose source, be it inner earth or  sky, no hearer was ever able to place. A single lightning bolt shot  from the purple zenith to the altar-stone, and a great tidal wave of  viewless force and indescribable stench swept down from the hill to  all the countryside. Trees, grass, and underbrush were whipped into a  fury; and the frightened crowd at the mountain's base, weakened by the  lethal fetor that seemed about to asphyxiate them, were almost hurled  off their feet. Dogs howled from the distance, green grass and foliage  wilted to a curious, sickly yellow-gray, and over field and forest were  scattered the bodies of dead whippoorwills.    The stench left quickly, but the vegetation never came right again.  To this day there is something queer and unholy about the growths on  and around that fearsome hill. Curtis Whateley was only just regaining  consciousness when the Arkham men came slowly down the mountain in the  beams of a sunlight once more brilliant and untainted. They were grave  and quiet, and seemed shaken by memories and reflections even more  terrible than those which had reduced the group of natives to a state  of cowed quivering. In reply to a jumble of questions they only shook  their heads and reaffirmed one vital"]]]
