But, to his surprise, the citizen looked well pleased, and even praised  the work.    'It is well worth the money,' he said; 'and if thou wilt return with me  to my house, I will pay thee the six gold pieces.'    Biagio scarcely knew what to do. He was so puzzled and bewildered he  felt as if this must be a bad dream.    As soon as he could, he rushed back to the studio to look again at that  picture, and then he found that the red-capped citizens had  disappeared, and his eight angels were there instead. This of course  was not surprising, as Sandro and his pupils had quickly removed the  wax and taken off the scarlet caps.    'Master, master,' cried the astonished pupil, 'tell me if I am  dreaming, or if I have lost my wits? When I came in just now, these  angels were Florentine citizens with red caps on their heads, and now  they are angels once more. What may this mean?'    'I think, Biagio, that this money must have turned thy brain round,'  said Botticelli gravely. 'If the angels had looked as thou sayest, dost  thou think the citizen would have bought the picture?'    'That is true,' said Biagio, shaking his head solemnly; 'and yet I  swear I never saw anything more clearly.'    And the poor boy, for many a long day, was afraid to trust his own  eyes, since they had so basely deceived him.    But the next thing that happened at the studio did not seem like a joke  to the master, for a weaver of cloth came to live close by, and his  looms made such a noise and such a shaking that Sandro was deafened,  and the house shook so greatly that it was impossible to paint.    But though Botticelli went to the weaver and explained all this most  courteously, the man answered roughly, 'Can I not do what I like with  my own house?' So Sandro was angry, and went away and immediately  ordered a great square of stone to be brought, so big that it filled a  waggon. This he had placed on the top of his wall nearest to the  weaver's house, in such a way that the least shake would bring it  crashing down into the enemy's workshop.    When the weaver saw this he was terrified, and came round at once to  the studio.    'Take down that great stone at once,' he shouted. 'Do you not see that  it would crush me and my workshop if it fell?'    'Not at all,' said Botticelli. 'Why should I take it down? Can I not do  as I like with my own house?'    And this taught the weaver a lesson, so that he made less noise and  shaking, and Sandro had the best of the joke after all.    There were no idle days of dreaming now for Sandro. As soon as one  picture was finished another was wanted. Money flowed in, and his purse  was always full of gold, though he emptied it almost as fast as it was  filled. His work for the Pope at Rome alone was so well paid that the  money should have lasted him for many a long day, but in his usual  careless way he spent it all before he returned to Florence.    Perhaps it was the gay life at Lorenzo's splendid court that had taught  him to spend money so carelessly, and to have no thought but to eat,  drink, and be merry. But very soon a change began to steal over his  life.    There was one man in Florence who looked with sad condemning eyes on  all the pleasure-loving crowd that thronged the court of Lorenzo the  Magnificent. In the peaceful convent of San Marco, whose walls the  angel-painter had covered with pictures 'like windows into heaven,' the  stern monk Savonarola was grieving over the sin and vanity that went on  around him. He loved Florence with all his heart, and he could not bear  the thought that she was forgetting, in the whirl of pleasure, all that  was good and pure and worth the winning.    Then, like a battle-cry, his voice sounded through the city, and roused  the people from their foolish dreams of ease and pleasure. Every one  flocked to the great cathedral to hear Savonarola preach, and Sandro  Botticelli left for a while his studio and his painting and became a  follower of the great preacher. Never again did he paint those pictures  of earthly subjects which had so delighted Lorenzo. When he once more  returned to his work, it was to paint his sad-eyed Madonnas; and the  music which still floated through his visions was now like the song of  angels.    The boys of Florence especially had grown wild and rough during the  reign of pleasure, and they were the terror of the city during carnival  time. They would carry long poles, or 'stili,' and bar the streets  across, demanding money before they would let the people pass. This  money they spent on drinking and feasting, and at night they set up  great trees in the squares or wider streets and lighted huge bonfires  around them. Then would begin a terrible fight with stones, and many of  the boys were hurt, and some even killed.    No one had been able to put a stop to this until Savonarola made up his  mind that it should cease. Then, as if by magic, all was changed.    Instead of the rough game of 'stili,' there were altars put up at the  corners of the streets, and the boys begged money of the passers-by,  not for their feasts, but for the poor.    'You shall not miss your bonfire,' said Savonarola; 'but instead of a  tree you shall burn up vain and useless things, and so purify the city.'    So the children went round and collected all the 'vanities,' as they  were called--wigs and masks and carnival dresses, foolish songs, bad  books, and evil pictures; all were heaped high and then lighted to make  one great bonfire.    Some people think that perhaps Sandro threw into the Bonfire of  Vanities some of his own beautiful pictures, but that we cannot tell.    Then came the sad time when the people, who at one time would have made  Savonarola their king, turned against him, in the same fickle way that  crowds will ever turn. And then the great preacher, who had spent his  life trying to help and teach them, and to do them good, was burned in  the great square of that city which he had loved so dearly.    After this it was long before Botticelli cared to paint again. He was  old and weary now, poor and sad, sick of that world which had treated  with such cruelty the master whom he loved.    One last picture he painted to show the triumph of good over evil. Not  with the sword or the might of great power is the triumph won, says  Sandro to us by this picture, but by the little hand of the Christ  Child, conquering by love and drawing all men to Him. This Adoration of  the Magi is in our own National Gallery in London, and is the only  painting which Botticelli ever signed.    'I, Alessandro, painted this picture during the troubles of Italy ...  when the devil was let loose for the space of three and a half years.  Afterwards shall he be chained, and we shall see him trodden down as in  this picture.'    It is evident that Botticelli meant by this those sad years of struggle  against evil which ended in the martyrdom of the great preacher, and he  has placed Savonarola among the crowd of worshippers drawn to His feet  by the Infant Christ.    It is sad to think of those last days when Sandro was too old and too  weary to paint. He who had loved to make his figures move with dancing  feet, was now obliged to walk with crutches. The roses and lilies of  spring were faded now, and instead of the music of his youth he heard  only the sound of harsh, ungrateful voices, in the flowerless days of  poverty and old age.    There is always something sad too about his pictures, but through the  sadness, if we listen, we may hear the angel-song, and understand it  better if we have in our minds the prayer which Botticelli left for us.    'Oh, King of Wings and Lord of Lords, who alone rulest always in  eternity, and who correctest all our wanderings, giver of melody to the  choir of angels, listen Thou a little to our bitter grief, and come and  rule us, oh Thou highest King, with Thy love which is so sweet.'        DOMENICO GHIRLANDAIO    Ghirlandaio! what a difficult name that sounds to our English ears. But  it has a very simple meaning, and when you understand it the difficulty  will vanish.    It all happened in this way. Domenico's father was a goldsmith, one of  the cleverest goldsmiths in Florence, and he was specially famous for  making garlands or wreaths of gold and silver. It was the fashion then  for the young maidens of Florence to wear these garlands, or  'ghirlande' as they were called, on their heads, and because this  goldsmith made them better than any one else they gave him the name of  Ghirlandaio, which means 'maker of garlands,' and that became the  family name.    When the time came for the boy Domenico to learn a trade, he was sent,  of course, to his father's workshop. He learned so quickly, and worked  with such strong, clever fingers, that his father was delighted.    'The boy will make the finest goldsmith of his day,' he said proudly,  as he watched him twisting the delicate golden wire and working out his  designs in beaten silver.    So he was set to make the garlands, and for a while he was contented  and happy. It was such exquisite work to twine into shape the graceful  golden leaves, with here and there a silver lily or a jewelled rose,  and to dream of the fair head on which the garland would rest.    But the making of garlands did not satisfy Domenico for long, and like  Botticelli he soon began to dream of becoming a painter.    You must remember that in those days goldsmiths and painters had much  in common, and often worked together. The goldsmith made his picture  with gold and silver and jewels, while the painter drew his with  colours, but they were both artists.    So as the young Ghirlandaio watched these men draw their great designs  and listened to their talk, he began to feel that the goldsmith's work  was cramped and narrow, and he longed for a larger, grander work. Day  by day the garlands were more and more neglected,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5307"],[0,"The Letters of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart — Volume 01 (#10)"],[1,"very polite, and seemed already to know all that had taken place about  me. We went up the steps together slowly and alone; I told him briefly  the whole affair. He said that I ought at once to request an audience of  his Highness the Elector, but that, if I failed in obtaining it, I  must make a written statement. I entreated him to keep this all quite  private, and he agreed to do so. When I remarked to him that there  really was room for a genuine composer here, he said, \"I know that  well.\" I afterwards went to the Bishop of Chiemsee, and was with him for  half an hour. I told him everything, and he promised to do all he  could for me in the matter. At one o'clock he drove to Nymphenburg, and  declared positively he would speak to the Electress. On Sunday the Count  comes here. Herr Joannes Kronner has been appointed Vice-Concertmeister,  which he owes to a blunt speech of his. He has produced two  symphonies--Deo mene liberi [God preserve me from such]--of his own  composition. The Elector asked him, \"Did you really compose these?\"  \"Yes, your Royal Highness!\" \"From whom did you learn?\" \"From a  schoolmaster in Switzerland, where so much importance is attached to  the study of composition. This schoolmaster taught me more than all your  composers here, put together, could teach me.\" Count Schonborn and his  Countess, a sister of the Archbishop [of Salzburg], passed through here  to-day. I chanced to be at the play at the time. Herr Albert, in the  course of conversation, told them that I was here, and that I had given  up my situation. They were all astonishment, and positively refused to  believe him when he said that my salary, of blessed memory, was only  twelve florins thirty kreuzers! They merely changed horses, and would  gladly have spoken with me, but I was too late to meet them. Now I must  inquire what you are doing, and how you are. Mamma and I hope that you  are quite well. I am still in my very happiest humor; my head feels as  light as a feather since I got away from that chicanery. I have grown  fatter already.        61.    Munich, Sept. 29, 1777.    TRUE enough, a great many kind friends, but unluckily most of them have  little or nothing in their power. I was with Count Seeau yesterday, at  half-past ten o'clock, and found him graver and less natural than the  first time; but it was only in appearance, for to-day I was at Prince  Zeill's [Bishop of Chiemsee--No. 56], who, with all courtesy, said  to me, \"I don't think we shall effect much here. During dinner, at  Nymphenburg, I spoke privately to the Elector, who replied: 'It is  too soon at this moment; he must leave this and go to Italy and become  famous. I do not actually reject him, but these are too early days  as yet.'\" There it is! Most of these grandees have such paroxysms of  enthusiasm for Italy. Still, he advised me to go to the Elector, and  to place my case before him as I had previously intended. I spoke  confidentially at dinner to-day with Herr Woschitka [violoncellist in  the Munich court orchestra, and a member of the Elector's private band],  and he appointed me to come to-morrow at nine o'clock, when he will  certainly procure me an audience. We are very good friends now. He  insisted on knowing the name of my informant; but I said to him, \"Rest  assured that I am your friend and shall continue to be so; I am in turn  equally convinced of your friendship, so you must be satisfied with  this.\" But to return to my narrative. The Bishop of Chiemsee also spoke  to the Electress when tete-a-tete with her. She shrugged her shoulders,  and said she would do her best, but was very doubtful as to her success.  I now return to Count Seeau, who asked Prince Zeill (after he had told  him everything). \"Do you know whether Mozart has not enough from his  family to enable him to remain here with a little assistance? I should  really like to keep him.\" Prince Zeill answered: \"I don't know, but  I doubt it much; all you have to do is to speak to himself on the  subject.\" This, then, was the cause of Count Seeau being so thoughtful  on the following day. I like being here, and I am of the same opinion  with many of my friends, that if I could only remain here for a year  or two, I might acquire both money and fame by my works, and then more  probably be sought by the court than be obliged to seek it myself. Since  my return here Herr Albert has a project in his head, the fulfilment of  which does not seem to me impossible. It is this: He wishes to form an  association of ten kind friends, each of these to subscribe 1 ducat (50  gulden) monthly, 600 florins a year. If in addition to this I had even  200 florins per annum from Count Seeau, this would make 800 florins  altogether. How does papa like this idea? Is it not friendly? Ought not  I to accept it if they are in earnest? I am perfectly satisfied with  it; for I should be near Salzburg, and if you, dearest papa, were seized  with a fancy to leave Salzburg (which from my heart I wish you were) and  to pass your life in Munich, how easy and pleasant would it be! For if  we are obliged to live in Salzburg with 504 florins, surely we might  live in Munich with 800.    To-day, the 30th, after a conversation with Herr Woschitka, I went to  court by appointment. Every one was in hunting-costume. Baron Kern was  the chamberlain on service. I might have gone there last night, but  I could not offend M. Woschitka, who himself offered to find me an  opportunity of speaking to the Elector. At 10 o'clock he took me into a  narrow little room, through which his Royal Highness was to pass on his  way to hear mass, before going to hunt. Count Seeau went by, and greeted  me very kindly: \"How are you, dear Mozart?\" When the Elector came up to  me, I said, \"Will your Royal Highness permit me to pay my homage and  to offer your Royal Highness my services?\" \"So you have finally left  Salzburg?\" \"I have left it forever, your Royal Highness. I only asked  leave to make a journey, and being refused, I was obliged to take this  step, although I have long intended to leave Salzburg, which is no place  for me, I feel sure.\" \"Good heavens! you are quite a young man. But your  father is still in Salzburg?\" \"Yes, your Royal Highness; he humbly lays  his homage at your feet, &c., &c. I have already been three times in  Italy. I have written three operas, and am a member of the Bologna  Academy; I underwent a trial where several maestri toiled and labored  for four or five hours, whereas I finished my work in one. This is  a sufficient testimony that I have abilities to serve any court. My  greatest wish is to be appointed by your Royal Highness, who is himself  such a great &c., &c.\" \"But, my good young friend, I regret that there  is not a single vacancy. If there were only a vacancy!\" \"I can assure  your Royal Highness that I would do credit to Munich.\" \"Yes, but what  does that avail when there is no vacancy?\" This he said as he was moving  on; so I bowed and took leave of his Royal Highness. Herr Woschitka  advises me to place myself often in the way of the Elector. This  afternoon I went to Count Salern's. His daughter is a maid of honor, and  was one of the hunting-party. Ravani and I were in the street when the  whole procession passed. The Elector and the Electress noticed me very  kindly. Young Countess Salern recognized me at once, and waved her  hand to me repeatedly. Baron Rumling, whom I had previously seen in the  antechamber, never was so courteous to me as on this occasion. I will  soon write to you what passed with Salern. He was very kind, polite, and  straightforward.--P. S. Ma tres-chere soeur, next time I mean to write  you a letter all for yourself. My remembrances to B. C. M. R. and  various other letters of the alphabet. Adieu! A man built a house here  and inscribed on it: \"Building is beyond all doubt an immense pleasure,  but I little thought that it would cost so much treasure.\" During the  night some one wrote underneath, \"You ought first to have counted the  cost.\"        62.    Munich, Oct. 2, 1777.    YESTERDAY, October 1st, I was again at Count Salern's, and to-day I even  dined with him. I have played a great deal during the last three days,  and with right good will too. Papa must not, however, imagine that I  like to be at Count Salern's on account of the young lady; by no means,  for she is unhappily in waiting, and therefore never at home, but I am  to see her at court to-morrow morning, at ten o'clock, in company with  Madame Hepp, formerly Madlle. Tosson. On Saturday the court leaves this,  and does not return till the 20th. To-morrow I am to dine with Madame  and Madlle. de Branca, the latter being a kind of half pupil of mine,  for Sigl seldom comes, and Becke, who usually accompanies her on the  flute, is not here. On the three days that I was at Count Salern's I  played a great many things extempore--two Cassations [Divertimentos]  for the Countess, and the finale and Rondo, and the latter by heart.  You cannot imagine the delight this causes Count Salern. He understands  music, for he was constantly saying Bravo! while other gentlemen were  taking snuff, humming and hawing, and clearing their throats, or holding  forth. I said to him, \"How I do wish the Elector were only here, that he  might hear me play! He knows nothing of me--he does not know what I can  do. How sad it is that these great gentlemen should believe what any one  tells them, and do not choose to judge for themselves! BUT IT IS ALWAYS  SO. Let him put me to the test. He may assemble all the composers in  Munich, and also send in quest of some from Italy and France, Germany,  and England and Spain, and I will undertake to write against them all.\"  I related to him all that had occurred to me in Italy, and begged him,  if the conversation turned on me, to bring in these things. He said, \"I  have very little influence, but the little that is in my power I will  do with pleasure.\" He is also"]]]
