For my part I  am not promising it much luck. From the doings so far it looks as  if an effort were making thoroughly to destroy the German opera  which had suspended, perhaps only for a while, rather than to  help it up again and preserve it. Only my sister-in-law Lange has  been engaged for the German Singspiel. Cavalieri, Adamberger,  Teyber, all Germans, of whom Germany can be proud, must remain  with the Italian opera, must make war against their countrymen!\"    (Vienna, March 21, 1785, to Anton Klein. Madame Lange was Aloysia  Weber, with whom he was in love before he married her sister  Constanze.)    117. \"The gentlemen of Vienna (including most particularly the  Emperor) must not be permitted to believe that I live only for  the sake of Vienna. There is no monarch on the face of the earth  whom I would rather serve than the Emperor, but I shall not beg  service. I believe that I am capable of doing honor to any court.  If Germany, my beloved fatherland, of whom you know I am proud,  will not accept me, then must I, in the name of God, again make  France or England richer by one capable German;--and to the shame  of the German nation. You know full well that in nearly all the  arts those who excelled have nearly always been Germans. But  where did they find fortune, where fame? Certainly not in  Germany. Even Gluck;--did Germany make him a great man? Alas,  no!\"    (Vienna, August 17, 1782, to his father. Mozart's answer in 1789,  when King Frederick William II of Prussia said to him: \"Stay with  me; I offer you a salary of 3,000 thalers,\" was touching in the  extreme: \"Shall I leave my good Emperor?\" Thereupon the king  said: \"Think it over. I'll keep my word even if you should come  after a year and a day!\" In spite of his financial difficulties,  Mozart never gave serious consideration to the offer. When his  father advised him against some of his foreign plans he answered:  \"So far as France and England are concerned you are wholly right;  this opening will never be closed to me; it will be better if I  wait a while longer. Meanwhile it is possible that conditions may  change in those countries.\" In a preceding letter he had written:  \"For some time I have been practicing myself daily in the French  language, and I have also taken three lessons in English. In  three months I hope to be able to read and understand English  books fairly well.\")    118. \"The two of us played a sonata that I had composed for the  occasion, and which had a success. This sonata I shall send you  by Herr von Daubrawaick, who said that he would feel proud to  have it in his trunk; his son, who is a Salzburger, told me this.  When the father went he said, quite loud, 'I am proud to be your  countryman. You are doing great honor to Salzburg; I hope that  times will so change that we can have you amongst us, and then do  not forget me.' I answered: 'My fatherland has always the first  claim on me.' \"    (Vienna, November 24, 1781, to his father. Mozart is speaking of  a concert which he had given. The sonata is the small one in D  major (Kochel, No. 381). Mozart often made merry over the  Salzburgians; he called them stupid and envious.)    119. \"Thoroughly convinced that I was talking to a German, I gave  free rein to my tongue,--a thing which one is so seldom permitted  to do that after such an outpouring of the heart it would be  allowable to get a bit fuddled without risk of hurting one's  health.\"    (Vienna, March 21, 1785, to Anton Klein.)        SELF-RESPECT AND HONOR        Beethoven is said to have been the first musician who compelled  respect for his craft,--he who, prouder than Goethe, associated  with royalties, and said of himself, \"I, too, am a king!\" Mozart  rose from a dependent position which brought him most grievous  humiliations; he was looked upon as a servant of the Archbishop  of Salzburg, and treated accordingly. At the time composers  and musicians had no higher standing. Mozart feels the  intolerableness of his position and protests against it on every  opportunity; he is conscious of his worth and intellectual  superiority. When he endures the grossest indignities from his  tormentor, Archbishop Hieronymus, it is for the sake of his  father whom he would save from annoyance. In all things else  he follows the example of his father, but in the matter of  self-respect he admonishes and encourages his parent. Although  Beethoven rudely rejected the condescending good will of the  great which would have made Mozart happy, and demanded respect  as an equal, it must be confessed that the generally manly  conduct of Mozart was an excellent preparation of the Viennese  soil.    120. \"I only wish that the Elector were here; he might hear  something to his advantage. He knows nothing about me, knows  nothing about my ability. What a pity that these grand gentlemen  take everybody's word and are unwilling to investigate for  themselves! It's always the way. I am willing to make a test; let  him summon all the composers in Munich, and even invite a few  from Italy, Germany, England and Spain; I will trust myself in a  competition with them all.\"    (Munich, October 2, 1777, to his father. Mozart had hoped to  secure an appointment in Munich, but was disappointed.)    121. \"I could scarcely refrain from laughing when I was  introduced to the people. A few, who knew me par renommee, were  very polite and respectful; others who know nothing about me  stared at me as if they were a bit amused. They think that  because I am small and young that there can be nothing great and  old in me. But they shall soon find out.\"    (Mannheim, October 31, 1777, to his father.)    122. \"We poor, common folk must not only take wives whom we love  and who love us, but we may, can and want to take such because we  are neither noble, well-born nor rich, but lowly, mean and poor.  Hence we do not need rich wives because our wealth dies with us,  being in our heads. Of this wealth no man can rob us unless he  cuts off our heads, in which case we should have need of nothing  more.\"    (Mannheim, February 7, 1778, to his father. Mozart had fallen in  love with Aloysia, daughter of the poor musician Weber.)    123. \"I will gladly give lessons to oblige, particularly if I see  that a person has talent and a joyous desire to learn. But to go  to a house at a fixed hour, or wait at home for the arrival of  some one, that I can not do, no matter how much it might yield  me; I leave that to others who can do nothing else than play the  clavier,--for me it is impossible. I am a composer and was born  to be a chapelmaster. I dare not thus bury the talent for  composition which a kind God gave me in such generous measure (I  may say this without pride for I feel it now more than ever  before), and that is what I should do had I many pupils. Teaching  is a restless occupation and I would rather neglect clavier  playing than composition; the clavier is a side issue, though,  thank God, a strong one.\"    (Mannheim, February 7, 1778, to his father, who must have read  the words with sorrow, since he and his daughter Nannerl were  laboriously giving lessons and practicing economy to make  Mozart's journey possible and had to advance money to him.)    124. \"I know of a certainty that the Emperor intends to establish  a German opera in Vienna, and is earnestly seeking a young  conductor who understands the German language, has genius and is  capable of giving the world something new. Benda of Gotha is  seeking the place and Schweitzer is also an applicant. I believe  this would be a good thing for me,--but with good pay, as a  matter of course. If the Emperor will give me a thousand florins,  I will write a German opera for him, and if then he does not wish  to retain me, all right. I beg of you, write to all the good  friends in Vienna whom you can think of that I would do honor to  the Emperor. If there is no other way let him try me with an  opera.\"    (Mannheim, January 10, 1778, to his father.)    125. \"The greatest favor that Herr Grimm showed me was to lend me  15 Louis d'Or in driblets at the (life and) death of my blessed  mother. Is he fearful that the loan will not be returned? If so  he truly deserves a kick--for he shows distrust of my honesty  (the only thing that can throw me into a rage), and also of my  talent....In a word he belongs to the Italian party, is deceitful  and is seeking to oppress me.\"    (Paris, September 11, 1778, to his father, who was on a friendly  footing with the French encyclopaedist Grimm since the first  artistic tour made with little Wolfgang in 1763, when he owed  many favors to Grimm. Apparently Mozart here does an injustice to  his patron, who, it is true, thought highly of the Italian  Piccini.)    126. \"On my honor, I can't help it; it's the kind of man I am.  Lately when he spoke to me rudely, foolishly and stupidly, I did  not dare to say to him that he need not worry about the 15 Louis  d'Or for fear that I might offend him. I did nothing but endure  and ask if he were ready; and then--your obedient servant.\"    (Paris, September 11, 1778, to his father, at whose request Baron  Grimm had received the young artist in Paris, but at the same  time had exercised a sort of artistic guardianship over him.  Wolfgang had written to his father as early as August 27: \"If you  write to him do not be too humble in your thanks;--there are  reasons.\" On another occasion: \"Grimm is able to assist children,  but not adults. Do not imagine that he is the man he was.\")    127. \"You know that I want nothing more than good employment,--  good in character and good in recompense, let it be where it will  if the place be but Catholic...; but if the Salzburgians want me  they must satisfy my desires or they will certainly not get me.\"    (Paris, July 3, 1778, to his father, who wished to see his son in  the service of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4060"],[0,"The Renaissance: studies in art and poetry (#10)"],[1,"Savonarola, may well have let such theories come and  go across him.  True or false, the story interprets much of the  peculiar sentiment with which he infuses his profane and sacred  persons, comely, and in a certain sense like angels, but with a  sense of displacement or loss about them--the wistfulness of  exiles, conscious of a passion and energy greater than any known  issue of them explains, which runs through all his varied work  with a sentiment of ineffable melancholy.    So just what Dante scorns as unworthy alike of heaven and hell,  Botticelli accepts, that middle world in which men take no side in  great conflicts, and decide no great causes, and make great  refusals.  He thus sets for himself the limits within which art,  undisturbed by any moral ambition, does its most sincere and  surest work.  His interest is neither in the untempered goodness  of Angelico's saints, nor the untempered evil of Orcagna's  Inferno; but with men and women, in their mixed and uncertain  condition, always [56] attractive, clothed sometimes by passion  with a character of loveliness and energy, but saddened  perpetually by the shadow upon them of the great things from  which they shrink.  His morality is all sympathy; and it is this  sympathy, conveying into his work somewhat more than is usual  of the true complexion of humanity, which makes him, visionary  as he is, so forcible a realist.    It is this which gives to his Madonnas their unique expression  and charm.  He has worked out in them a distinct and peculiar  type, definite enough in his own mind, for he has painted it over  and over again, sometimes one might think almost mechanically,  as a pastime during that dark period when his thoughts were so  heavy upon him.  Hardly any collection of note is without one of  these circular pictures, into which the attendant angels depress  their heads so naïvely.  Perhaps you have sometimes wondered  why those peevish-looking Madonnas, conformed to no  acknowledged or obvious type of beauty, attract you more and  more, and often come back to you when the Sistine Madonna and  the Virgins of Fra Angelico are forgotten.  At first, contrasting  them with those, you may have thought that there was something  in them mean or abject even, for the abstract lines of the face  have little nobleness, and the colour is wan.  For with Botticelli  she too, though she holds in her hands the \"Desire of all nations,\"  is one of those who [57] are neither for Jehovah nor for His  enemies; and her choice is on her face.  The white light on it is  cast up hard and cheerless from below, as when snow lies upon  the ground, and the children look up with surprise at the strange  whiteness of the ceiling.  Her trouble is in the very caress of the  mysterious child, whose gaze is always far from her, and who has  already that sweet look of devotion which men have never been  able altogether to love, and which still makes the born saint an  object almost of suspicion to his earthly brethren.  Once, indeed,  he guides her hand to transcribe in a book the words of her  exaltation, the Ave, and the Magnificat, and the Gaude Maria,  and the young angels, glad to rouse her for a moment from her  dejection, are eager to hold the inkhorn and to support the book.  But the pen almost drops from her hand, and the high cold words  have no meaning for her, and her true children are those others,  among whom, in her rude home, the intolerable honour came to  her, with that look of wistful inquiry on their irregular faces  which you see in startled animals--gipsy children, such as those  who, in Apennine villages, still hold out their long brown arms to  beg of you, but on Sundays become enfants du choeur, with their  thick black hair nicely combed, and fair white linen on their  sunburnt throats.    What is strangest is that he carries this sentiment into classical  subjects, its most complete [58] expression being a picture in the  Uffizii, of Venus rising from the sea, in which the grotesque  emblems of the middle age, and a landscape full of its peculiar  feeling, and even its strange draperies, powdered all over in  the Gothic manner with a quaint conceit of daisies, frame a figure  that reminds you of the faultless nude studies of Ingres.  At first,  perhaps, you are attracted only by a quaintness of design, which  seems to recall all at once whatever you have read of Florence in  the fifteenth century; afterwards you may think that this  quaintness must be incongruous with the subject, and that the  colour is cadaverous or at least cold.  And yet, the more you  come to understand what imaginative colouring really is, that all  colour is no mere delightful quality of natural things, but a spirit  upon them by which they become expressive to the spirit, the  better you will like this peculiar quality of colour; and you will  find that quaint design of Botticelli's a more direct inlet into the  Greek temper than the works of the Greeks themselves even of  the finest period.  Of the Greeks as they really were, of their  difference from ourselves, of the aspects of their outward life, we  know far more than Botticelli, or his most learned  contemporaries; but for us long familiarity has taken off the edge  of the lesson, and we are hardly conscious of what we owe to the  Hellenic spirit.  But in pictures like this of Botticelli's you have a  record of the first impression made [59] by it on minds  turned back towards it, in almost painful aspiration, from a world  in which it had been ignored so long; and in the passion, the  energy, the industry of realisation, with which Botticelli carries  out his intention, is the exact measure of the legitimate influence  over the human mind of the imaginative system of which this is  perhaps the central myth.  The light is indeed cold--mere sunless  dawn; but a later painter would have cloyed you with sunshine;  and you can see the better for that quietness in the morning air  each long promontory, as it slopes down to the water's edge.  Men go forth to their labours until the evening; but she is awake  before them, and you might think that the sorrow in her face was  at the thought of the whole long day of love yet to come.  An  emblematical figure of the wind blows hard across the grey  water, moving forward the dainty-lipped shell on which she sails,  the sea \"showing his teeth,\" as it moves, in thin lines of foam,  and sucking in, one by one, the falling roses, each severe in  outline, plucked off short at the stalk, but embrowned a little, as  Botticelli's flowers always are.  Botticelli meant all this imagery  to be altogether pleasurable; and it was partly an incompleteness  of resources, inseparable from the art of that time, that subdued  and chilled it.  But this predilection for minor tones counts also;  and what is unmistakable is the sadness with which he has  conceived the goddess [60] of pleasure, as the depositary of a  great power over the lives of men.    I have said that the peculiar character of Botticelli is the result of  a blending in him of a sympathy for humanity in its uncertain  condition, its attractiveness, its investiture at rarer moments in a  character of loveliness and energy, with his consciousness of the  shadow upon it of the great things from which it shrinks, and that  this conveys into his work somewhat more than painting usually  attains of the true complexion of humanity.  He paints the story  of the goddess of pleasure in other episodes besides that of her  birth from the sea, but never without some shadow of death in the  grey flesh and wan flowers.  He paints Madonnas, but they shrink  from the pressure of the divine child, and plead in unmistakable  undertones for a warmer, lower humanity.  The same figure--  tradition connects it with Simonetta, the Mistress of Giuliano de'  Medici--appears again as Judith, returning home across the hill  country, when the great deed is over, and the moment of  revulsion come, when the olive branch in her hand is becoming a  burthen; as Justice, sitting on a throne, but with a fixed look of  self-hatred which makes the sword in her hand seem that of a  suicide; and again as Veritas, in the allegorical picture of  Calumnia, where one may note in passing the suggestiveness of  an accident which identifies the image of Truth with the person  of Venus. [61] We might trace the same sentiment through his  engravings; but his share in them is doubtful, and the object of  this brief study has been attained, if I have defined aright the  temper in which he worked.    But, after all, it may be asked, is a painter like Botticelli--a  secondary painter, a proper subject for general criticism?  There  are a few great painters, like Michelangelo or Leonardo, whose  work has become a force in general culture, partly for this very  reason that they have absorbed into themselves all such workmen  as Sandro Botticelli; and, over and above mere technical or  antiquarian criticism, general criticism may be very well  employed in that sort of interpretation which adjusts the position  of these men to general culture, whereas smaller men can be the  proper subjects only of technical or antiquarian treatment.  But,  besides those great men, there is a certain number of artists who  have a distinct faculty of their own by which they convey to us a  peculiar quality of pleasure which we cannot get elsewhere; and  these too have their place in general culture, and must be  interpreted to it by those who have felt their charm strongly, and  are often the object of a special diligence and a consideration  wholly affectionate, just because there is not about them the  stress of a great name and authority.  Of this select number  Botticelli is one.  He has the freshness, the uncertain and diffident  promise, [62] which belong to the earlier Renaissance itself, and  make it perhaps the most interesting period in the history of the  mind.
