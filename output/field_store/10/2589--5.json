Barnett.)]    The night was unusually cold, and travelling in coal trucks was scarcely  an inspiriting beginning. In the gloom of early dawn the train reached  Honing Spruit Station. Some of the officers alighted and exercised  themselves to restore circulation--they were numb and weary--and in doing  so espied, in the east, the dark outlines of mounted figures approaching.  They promptly gave the alarm. Colonel Bullock proceeded in all haste to  get the men out of the trucks, and speedily they were formed up round the  station. An effort was then made with such picks and shovels as were at  hand to dig trenches. But these were a mere apology for shelter. They  made, however, according to an officer who scraped his little burrow for  himself, a \"moral\" support. Of other support, it must be owned, they had  little. A few officers were provided with Mausers, carbines, and  bandoliers of ammunition, but the force for the most part were saddled  with Martini-Henry rifles and black powder ammunition--rifles discarded  by the Boers, and left by them in the arsenal at Pretoria. These  venerable weapons were sighted at 1200 yards--the ordinary range of  Lee-Mitford or Mauser may be taken at 1500 to 2000 yards--and were served  out of necessity, owing to the insufficiency of ammunition for Mauser  rifles. Thus handicapped at the outset in the way of weapons of defence,  ragged and tattered, some in boots that were dropping to pieces, some  partly in uniform, partly in mufti, garbed exactly as they had been in  the prison, they found themselves once again in presence of the enemy.  Colonel Bullock, stouthearted and truculent as ever, at once wired for  help to Kroonstad, and with the line cut on both sides of him, and the  Boers blowing up culverts as they came along, prepared to make a stand  against the advancing foe. Meanwhile bang! bang! went a series of  explosions on every side, voicing a vindictive tale and promising  unthinkable horrors to come.    According to their slim tactics, and to find out the strength of the  party most probably, the Boers now sent forward a man with a white flag,  declaring by the messenger, that they had many men and guns, and that if  the force refused to surrender they would be annihilated. But the Boers  had got hold of the wrong man. The officer who had doggedly held firm in  the blood-dyed donga at Colenso till the Dutchmen had threatened to  murder the wounded unless he gave in, was not the man to surrender  without a tussle. Colonel Bullock quickly sent the messenger and his  white flag to the right about, and made preparations for stout resistance  till help should arrive. But it was a sorry piece of \"bluff.\" They were  gunless, the old muskets were of little use, and the black powder was  objectionable, as it would have betrayed their positions and the  smallness of the force. It was therefore necessary to tackle the Boers  with extreme caution. \"At first,\" said an officer who was engaged, \"they  were only near the line to the north of us, covering the men who were  destroying the culverts and telegraph lines, but they gradually worked  round to the east, and about 8 or 8.30 down came the first  shell--shrapnel--from about 2000 yards away. The train all this time was  in the station, and I think they wanted to damage the engine, but their  shooting wasn't good enough. The engine went a little way up the line,  but found it cut, and had to return. Shells were pretty frequent now, and  bullets too numerous to be exactly pleasant, but Colonel Bullock and  Major Hobbs, who was second in command, were walking about seeing to  everything in the coolest possible way. No. 1 Company, under Captain  Elmslie, of the Lancashire Fusiliers, had made some small trenches facing  north, but when the Boers worked round to the east we were, of course,  enfiladed, so we got into a ditch running along the side of the line  north and south. They peppered us pretty well while we were getting  there, but only one man was hit in the arm. Previous to this poor Major  Hobbs, who, with the Colonel, had been sitting behind one of our small  shelters which did not anything like cover them, was shot through the  heart and killed.\" (Major Hobbs, it may be remembered, was the gallant  officer who was taken prisoner while tending a wounded man in the  brilliant engagement at Willow Grange.) \"Young Smith, of the Gloucesters,  had been sent down the ditch near the line with seven men to try and get  a bit nearer to the Boers who were damaging the culverts. They had rather  a warm time, and Colonel Bullock sent Freeth, the adjutant, to bring them  back. Poor Smith was shot through the groin, and the bullet went right  through him. Two of his men were wounded and one killed out of the seven.  Smith got back with Freeth's help all right, and I found him afterwards  sitting up in bed smoking cigarettes and as unconcerned as possible.\"    A small tin house at the station was used as a hospital, and a Red Cross  flag was improvised with difficulty. It was composed of a pillow-case  with red bands made from strips of a Kaffir blanket discovered in the  house. This was mounted on the shaft of an uptilted cart, but the Boers  affected not to comprehend its meaning, and sent in a man under a white  flag to ask an explanation. Here the wounded were tended by Mr. Cheatle  who, by a stroke of luck, happened to occupy a saloon carriage in the  \"held up\" train. There was no other doctor. This well-known surgeon who  had gone out, _con amore_, as it were, with Sir William MacCormac, was on  his way home, thinking his errand of mercy was over. He came quickly in  action again, bringing his brilliant wits to meet a somewhat desperate  situation. His bandages were made from ladies' under garments found in a  wardrobe, from the bed sheets in the train, and for antiseptic powder he  had recourse to the carbolic tooth-powder in the possession of some of  the officers. When this came to an end he utilised boiled rags, and  persistently attended to the nerve-shaken wounded, who all the time were  torn with bodily agony and horror-stricken by the continual howling of  shells against walls and ground.    [Illustration: AUSTRALIAN BUSHMEN ON THE MARCH    Drawing by Allan Stewart, from details supplied by Surgeon Captain Watt,  New Zealand Roughriders]    Meanwhile the Boers plied their guns, shelling at the same time from  north and east--an antiphonal duet of most appalling description. One  shell broke through the saloon carriage, another buried itself in some  bales of wool which luckily protected the verandah of the hospital. To  this the only return that could be made was a persistent peppering with  the ancient Martinis, a peppering which was carried on for several hours.  The officers worked hard with their Mauser carbines. The one before  quoted said he fired off fifty-five rounds, but did not know with what  result, except that some Boers, exposing themselves on the sky line, very  quickly got down flat on the grass after he had taken a \"steady pot\" at  them at about 1400 yards' distance. He went on to say: \"The Boers must  have known how we were armed, as it is quite against their custom to  expose themselves at all. At last we saw some men coming over the hill to  our right, and thought it was the relief force, but they turned out to be  Boers in khaki, some of whom, I believe, had helmets, probably taken from  the convoy they collared a week or two ago, somewhere in this  neighbourhood.\"    The telegram for help was despatched to Kroonstad about 7 A.M., but the  reinforcements did not arrive till nearly 3.30 P.M. The Boers early  became aware of their near approach, however, and began cautiously to  remove their four guns, two of which--15-pounders--were part of their  capture at Sanna's Post. Meanwhile the small force, who had been  straining every nerve and muscle for many hours, and meant to die in the  last ditch rather than surrender, were anxiously looking towards the  south for succour. Then, at last, the friendly scouts were seen coming  over the hill. Oh! the relief of it! The welcome rumour of help gave  energy to the men, who, after their long inactivity, had been suddenly  thrown, vilely armed, into vigorous action, and were by now well-nigh  exhausted. Away flew the hostile hordes, but not without having done a  fair day's work of destruction--line, telegraph, and culverts being  wrecked, one officer and three men killed, and one officer and seventeen  men wounded!    While this gang of Boers were worrying the Honing Spruit party, another  had attacked the Shropshires and Canadians at Katbosh Camp, and thus  deterred them from going to the assistance of their brothers in distress.  But it was owing to the splendid fighting of the Canadians that the  Dutchmen had found it impossible to close in round Honing Spruit, and the  party at the railway station were enabled to hold out till the relieving  force arrived. After the Boers left, the troops still remained in the  trenches, and strengthened them as much as possible; but the Argyll and  Sutherland Militia and some Mounted Infantry and a battery arrived from  Kroonstad, and the battery shelled some kopjes three miles away, where  the Boers--some 700 to 1000 of them, with three or four guns--were  collecting. It was said that the Boer loss was six killed, and that they  took away three waggons full of wounded, but this, of course, could not  be verified.    Some circumstances attending the brilliant resistance of the Colonials  are almost heroic. Lieutenant Inglis, with eight men of the Frontier  Police on worn-out ponies, were sent from the Katbosh Camp to  reconnoitre. They were suddenly surrounded by Boers, but fought  furiously, with the result that they made their way through, with the  loss of four, to an embankment which offered shelter. Fifty Boers then  came within"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4633"],[0,"Philip Steele of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police (#10)"],[1," He found, after an interval, that he was even  comfortable, and that his captors had not only given him a bed to lie  upon, but had placed a pillow under his head.        Chapter VII. The Tragedy In The Cabin    A few moments later Philip heard the movement of heavy feet, the opening  and closing of a door, and for a time after that there was silence. Had  MacGregor anticipated this, he wondered? Was this a part of the program  which the inspector had foreseen that he would play? His blood warmed  at the thought and he clenched his fists. Then he began to think more  calmly. His captors had not relieved him of his weapons. They had placed  his service cap in the box with him and had unbuckled his cartridge belt  so that he would rest more comfortably. What did all this mean? For the  hundredth time he asked himself the question.    Returning footsteps interrupted his thoughts. The cabin door opened,  people entered, again he heard whispering voices.    He strained his ears. At first he could have sworn that he heard the  soft, low tones of a woman's voice, but they were not repeated. Hands  caught hold of the box, dragged it across the floor, and then he felt  himself lifted bodily, and, after a dozen steps, placed carefully upon  some object in the snow. His amazement increased when he understood what  was occurring.    He was on a sledge. Through the air-holes in his prison he heard the  scraping of strap-thongs as they were laced through the runner-slits and  over the box, the restless movement of dogs, a gaping whine, the angry  snap of a pair of jaws. Then, slowly, the sledge began to move. A whip  cracked loudly above him, a voice rose in a loud shout, and the dogs  were urged to a trot. Again there came to Philip's ears the wheezing  notes of the accordion. By a slight effort he found that he could turn  his head sufficiently to look through a hole on a level with his eyes in  the side of the box. The sledge had turned from the dark trail into the  lighted street, and stopped at last before a brilliantly lighted front  from which there issued the sound of coarse voices, of laughter and  half-drunken song.    One of his captors went into the bar while the other seated himself on  the box, with one leg shutting out Philip's vision by dangling it over  the hole through which he was looking.    \"What's up, Fingy?\" inquired a voice.    \"Wekusko,\" replied the man on the box, in the husky, flesh-smothered  tones of the person who had entered last into the cabin.    \"Another dead one up there, eh?\" persisted the same voice.    \"No. Maps 'n' things f'r Hodges, up at the camp. Devil of a hurry, ain't  he, to order us up at night? Tell ---- to hustle out with the bottle,  will you?\"    The speaker sent the lash of his whip snapping through the air in place  of supplying a name.    \"Maps and things--for Hodges--Wekusko!\" gasped Philip inwardly.    He listened for further information. None came, and soon the man called  Fingy jumped from the box, cracked his whip with a wheezing command to  the dogs, and the sledge moved on.    And so his captors were taking him to Wekusko?--and more than that,  to Hodges, chief of construction, whose life had been attempted by the  prisoner whom Inspector MacGregor had ordered him to bring down!  Had Fingy spoken the truth? And, if so, was this another part of the  mysterious plot foreseen by the inspector?    During the next half hour, in which the sledge traveled steadily over  the smooth, hard trail into the north, Philip asked himself these and  a score of other questions equally perplexing. He was certain that the  beautiful young woman whom he had followed had purposely lured him into  the ambush. He considered himself her prisoner. Then why should he be  consigned, like a parcel of freight, to Hodges, her husband's accuser,  and the man who demanded the full penalty of the law for his assailant?    The more he added to the questions that leaped into his mind the more  mystified he became. The conflicting orders, the strange demeanor of his  chief, the pathetic appeal that he had seen in the young woman's eyes,  the ambush, and now this unaccountable ride to Wekusko, strapped in a  coffin box, all combined to plunge him into a chaos of wonder from which  it was impossible for him to struggle forth. However, he assured himself  of two things; he was comparatively comfortable, and within two hours at  the most they would reach Hodges' headquarters, if the Wekusko camp were  really to be their destination. Something must develop then.    It had ceased to occur to him that there was peril in his strange  position. If that were so, would his captors have left him in possession  of his weapons, even imprisoned as he was? If they had intended him  harm, would they have cushioned his box and placed a pillow under his  head so that the cloth about his mouth would not cause him discomfort?  It struck him as peculiarly significant, now that he had suffered  no injury in the short struggle on the trail, that no threats or  intimidation had been offered after his capture. This was a part of the  game which he was to play! He became more and more certain of it as  the minutes passed, and there occurred to him again and again the  inspector's significant words, \"Whatever happens!\" MacGregor had spoken  the words with particular emphasis, had repeated them more than once.  Were they intended to give him a warning of this, to put him on his,  guard, as well as at his ease?    And with these thoughts, many, conflicting and mystifying, he found it  impossible to keep from associating other thoughts of Bucky Nome, and  of the woman whom he now frankly confessed to himself that he loved.  If conditions had been a little different, if the incidents had not  occurred just as they had, he have suspected the hand of Bucky Nome in  what was transpiring now. But he discarded that suspicion the instant  that it came to him. That which remained with him more and more deeply  as the minutes passed was a mental picture of the two women--of this  woman who was fighting to save her husband, and of the other, whom he  loved, and for whom he had fought to save her for her husband. It was  with a dull feeling of pain that he compared the love, the faith, and  the honor of this woman whose husband had committed a crime with that  one night's indiscretion of Mrs. Becker. It was in her eyes and face  that he had seen a purity like that of an angel, and the pain seemed to  stab him deeper when he thought that, after all, it was the criminal's  wife who was proving herself, not Mrs. Becker.    He strove to unburden his mind for a time, and turned his head so that  he could peer through the hole in the side of the box. The moon had  risen, and now and then he caught flashes of the white snow in the  opens, but more frequently only the black shadows of the forest through  which they were passing. They had not left Le Pas more than two hours  behind when the sledge stopped again and Philip saw a few scattered  lights a short distance away.    \"Must be Wekusko,\" he thought. \"Hello, what's that?\"    A voice came sharply from the opposite side of the box.    \"Is that you, Fingy?\" it demanded. \"What the devil have you got there?\"    \"Your maps and things, sir,\" replied Fingy hoarsely. \"Couldn't come up  to-morrow, so thought we'd do it to-night.\"    Philip heard the closing of a door, and footsteps crunched in the snow  close to his ears.    \"Love o' God!\" came the voice again. \"What's this you've brought them up  in, Fingy?\"    \"Coffin box, sir. Only thing the maps'd fit into, and it's been layin'  around useless since MacVee kem down in it Mebby you can find use for  it, later,\" he chuckled grewsomely. \"Ho-ho-ho! mebby you can!\"    A moment later the box was lifted and Philip knew that he was being  carried up a step and through a door, then with a suddenness that  startled him he found himself standing upright. His prison had been set  on end!    \"Not that way, man,\" objected Hodges, for Philip was now certain that  he was in the presence of the chief of construction. \"Put it down--over  there in the corner.\"    \"Not on your life,\" retorted Fingy, cracking his finger bones fiercely.  \"See here. Mister Hodges, I ain't a coward, but I b'lieve in bein'  to the dead, 'n' to a box that's held one. It says on that red card,  'Head--This end up,' an', s'elp me, it's going to be up, unless you  put it down. I ain't goin' to be ha'nted by no ghosts! Ho, ho, ho--\"  He approached close to the box. \"I'll take this red card off, Mister  Hodges. It ain't nat'ral when there ain't nothing but maps 'n' things in  it.\"    If the cloth had not been about his mouth, it is possible that Philip  would not have restrained audible expression of his astonishment at what  happened an instant later. The card was torn off, and a ray of light  shot into his eyes. Through a narrow slit not more than a quarter of an  inch wide, and six inches long, he found himself staring out into the  room. The Fingy was close behind him. And in the rear of these two,  as if eager for their departure, was Hodges, chief of construction.  No sooner had the men gone than Hodges turned back to the table in the  center of the office. It was not difficult for Philip to see that the  man's face was flushed and that he was laboring under some excitement.  He sat down, fumbled over some papers, rose quickly to his feet, looked  at his watch, and began pacing back and forth across the room.    \"So she's coming,\" he chuckled gleefully.    \"She's coming, at last!\" He looked at his watch again, straightened  his cravat before a mirror, and rubbed his hands with a low laugh. \"The  little beauty has surrendered,\" he went on, his face turning for an  instant toward the coffin box. \"And it's time--past time.\"    A light knock sounded at the door, and the chief sprang to open it. A  figure darted past him, and for but a breath a white, beautiful face was  turned toward Philip and "]]]
