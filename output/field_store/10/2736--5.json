But Wilton, whom grief had  reduced to the mental level of an oyster, did not reason this out; and  the sight of her deprived him of practically all his faculties,  including speech. He just stood there and yammered.    'Did you follow me here, Mr Wilton?' said Mary, very coldly.    He shook his head. Eventually he managed to say that he had come there  by chance, and had fallen asleep under the rock. As this was exactly  what Mary had done, she could not reasonably complain. So that  concluded the conversation for the time being. She walked away in the  direction of Marois Bay without another word, and presently he lost  sight of her round a bend in the cliffs.    His position now was exceedingly unpleasant. If she had such a distaste  for his presence, common decency made it imperative that he should give  her a good start on the homeward journey. He could not tramp along a  couple of yards in the rear all the way. So he had to remain where he  was till she had got well off the mark. And as he was wearing a thin  flannel suit, and the sun had gone in, and a chilly breeze had sprung  up, his mental troubles were practically swamped in physical  discomfort.    Just as he had decided that he could now make a move, he was surprised  to see her coming back.    Wilton really was elated at this. The construction he put on it was  that she had relented and was coming back to fling her arms round his  neck. He was just bracing himself for the clash, when he caught her  eye, and it was as cold and unfriendly as the sea.    'I must go round the other way,' she said. 'The water has come up too  far on that side.'    And she walked past him to the other end of the cove.    The prospect of another wait chilled Wilton to the marrow. The wind had  now grown simply freezing, and it came through his thin suit and roamed  about all over him in a manner that caused him exquisite discomfort. He  began to jump to keep himself warm.    He was leaping heavenwards for the hundredth time, when, chancing to  glance to one side, he perceived Mary again returning. By this time his  physical misery had so completely overcome the softer emotions in his  bosom that his only feeling now was one of thorough irritation. It was  not fair, he felt, that she should jockey at the start in this way and  keep him hanging about here catching cold. He looked at her, when she  came within range, quite balefully.    'It is impossible,' she said, 'to get round that way either.'    One grows so accustomed in this world to everything going smoothly,  that the idea of actual danger had not yet come home to her. From where  she stood in the middle of the cove, the sea looked so distant that the  fact that it had closed the only ways of getting out was at the moment  merely annoying. She felt much the same as she would have felt if she  had arrived at a station to catch a train and had been told that the  train was not running.    She therefore seated herself on a rock, and contemplated the ocean.  Wilton walked up and down. Neither showed any disposition to exercise  that gift of speech which places Man in a class of his own, above the  ox, the ass, the common wart-hog, and the rest of the lower animals. It  was only when a wave swished over the base of her rock that Mary broke  the silence.    'The tide is coming _in_' she faltered.    She looked at the sea with such altered feelings that it seemed a  different sea altogether.    There was plenty of it to look at. It filled the entire mouth of the  little bay, swirling up the sand and lashing among the rocks in a  fashion which made one thought stand out above all the others in her  mind--the recollection that she could not swim.    'Mr Wilton!'    Wilton bowed coldly.    'Mr Wilton, the tide. It's coming IN.'    Wilton glanced superciliously at the sea.    'So,' he said, 'I perceive.'    'But what shall we do?'    Wilton shrugged his shoulders. He was feeling at war with Nature and  Humanity combined. The wind had shifted a few points to the east, and  was exploring his anatomy with the skill of a qualified surgeon.    'We shall drown,' cried Miss Campbell. 'We shall drown. We shall drown.  We shall drown.'    All Wilton's resentment left him. Until he heard that pitiful wail his  only thoughts had been for himself.    'Mary!' he said, with a wealth of tenderness in his voice.    She came to him as a little child comes to its mother, and he put his  arm around her.    'Oh, Jack!'    'My darling!'    'I'm frightened!'    'My precious!'    It is in moments of peril, when the chill breath of fear blows upon our  souls, clearing them of pettiness, that we find ourselves.    She looked about her wildly.    'Could we climb the cliffs?'    'I doubt it.'    'If we called for help--'    'We could do that.'    They raised their voices, but the only answer was the crashing of the  waves and the cry of the sea-birds. The water was swirling at their  feet, and they drew back to the shelter of the cliffs. There they stood  in silence, watching.    'Mary,' said Wilton in a low voice, 'tell me one thing.'    'Yes, Jack?'    'Have you forgiven me?'    'Forgiven you! How can you ask at a moment like this? I love you with  all my heart and soul.'    He kissed her, and a strange look of peace came over his face.    'I am happy.'    'I, too.'    A fleck of foam touched her face, and she shivered.    'It was worth it,' he said quietly. 'If all misunderstandings are  cleared away and nothing can come between us again, it is a small price  to pay--unpleasant as it will be when it comes.'    'Perhaps--perhaps it will not be very unpleasant. They say that  drowning is an easy death.'    'I didn't mean drowning, dearest. I meant a cold in the head.'    'A cold in the head!'    He nodded gravely.    'I don't see how it can be avoided. You know how chilly it gets these  late summer nights. It will be a long time before we can get away.'    She laughed a shrill, unnatural laugh.    'You are talking like this to keep my courage up. You know in your  heart that there is no hope for us. Nothing can save us now. The water  will come creeping--creeping--'    'Let it creep! It can't get past that rock there.'    'What do you mean?'    'It can't. The tide doesn't come up any farther. I know, because I was  caught here last week.'    For a moment she looked at him without speaking. Then she uttered a cry  in which relief, surprise, and indignation were so nicely blended that  it would have been impossible to say which predominated.    He was eyeing the approaching waters with an indulgent smile.    'Why didn't you tell me?' she cried.    'I did tell you.'    'You know what I mean. Why did you let me go on thinking we were in  danger, when--'    'We _were_ in danger. We shall probably get pneumonia.'    'Isch!'    'There! You're sneezing already.'    'I am not sneezing. That was an exclamation of disgust.'    'It sounded like a sneeze. It must have been, for you've every reason  to sneeze, but why you should utter exclamations of disgust I cannot  imagine.'    'I'm disgusted with you--with your meanness. You deliberately tricked  me into saying--'    'Saying--'    She was silent.    'What you said was that you loved me with all your heart and soul. You  can't get away from that, and it's good enough for me.'    'Well, it's not true any longer.'    'Yes, it is,' said Wilton, comfortably; 'bless it.'    'It is not. I'm going right away now, and I shall never speak to you  again.'    She moved away from him, and prepared to sit down.    'There's a jelly-fish just where you're going to sit,' said Wilton.    'I don't care.'    'It will. I speak from experience, as one on whom you have sat so  often.'    'I'm not amused.'    'Have patience. I can be funnier than that.'    'Please don't talk to me.'    'Very well.'    She seated herself with her back to him. Dignity demanded reprisals, so  he seated himself with his back to her; and the futile ocean raged  towards them, and the wind grew chillier every minute.    Time passed. Darkness fell. The little bay became a black cavern,  dotted here and there with white, where the breeze whipped the surface  of the water.    Wilton sighed. It was lonely sitting there all by himself. How much  jollier it would have been if--    A hand touched his shoulder, and a voice spoke--meekly.    'Jack, dear, it--it's awfully cold. Don't you think if we were  to--snuggle up--'    He reached out and folded her in an embrace which would have aroused  the professional enthusiasm of Hackenschmidt and drawn guttural  congratulations from Zbysco. She creaked, but did not crack, beneath  the strain.    'That's much nicer,' she said, softly. 'Jack, I don't think the tide's  started even to think of going down yet.'    'I hope not,' said Wilton.          THE MIXER      I. _He Meets a Shy Gentleman_    Looking back, I always consider that my career as a dog proper really  started when I was bought for the sum of half a crown by the Shy Man.  That event marked the end of my puppyhood. The knowledge that I was  worth actual cash to somebody filled me with a sense of new  responsibilities. It sobered me. Besides, it was only after that  half-crown changed hands that I went out into the great world; and,  however interesting life may be in an East End public-house, it is only  when you go out into the world that you really broaden your mind and  begin to see things.    Within its limitations, my life had been singularly full and vivid. I  was born, as I say, in a public-house in the East End, and, however  lacking a public-house may be in refinement and the true culture, it  certainly provides plenty of excitement. Before I was six weeks old I  had upset three policemen by getting between their legs when they came  round to the side-door, thinking they had heard suspicious "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7477"],[0,"The Book of Wonder (#10)"],[1,"hippogriffs alighted at dawn, for the turf was soft there and they  could gallop far before they came to a town, and there he waited  hidden near their hoofmarks. And the stars paled a little and grew  indistinct; but there was no other sign as yet of the dawn, when there  appeared far up in the deeps of the night two little saffron specks,  then four and five: it was the hippogriffs dancing and twirling around  in the sun. Another flock joined them, there were twelve of them now;  they danced there, flashing their colours back to the sun, they  descended in wide curves slowly; trees down on earth revealed against  the sky, jet-black each delicate twig; a star disappeared from a  cluster, now another; and dawn came on like music, like a new song.  Ducks shot by to the lake from still dark fields of corn, far voices  uttered, a colour grew upon water, and still the hippogriffs gloried  in the light, revelling up in the sky; but when pigeons stirred on the  branches and the first small bird was abroad, and little coots from  the rushes ventured to peer about, then there came down on a sudden  with a thunder of feathers the hippogriffs, and, as they landed from  their celestial heights all bathed with the day's first sunlight, the  man whose destiny it was as from of old to come to the City of Never,  sprang up and caught the last with the magic halter. It plunged, but  could not escape it, for the hippogriffs are of the uncaptured races,  and magic has power over the magical, so the man mounted it, and it  soared again for the heights whence it had come, as a wounded beast  goes home. But when they came to the heights that venturous rider saw  huge and fair to the left of him the destined City of Never, and he  beheld the towers of Lel and Lek, Neerib and Akathooma, and the cliffs  of Toldenarba a-glistening in the twilight like an alabaster statue of  the Evening. Towards them he wrenched the halter, towards Toldenarba  and the Under Pits; the wings of the hippogriff roared as the halter  turned him. Of the Under Pits who shall tell? Their mystery is secret.  It is held by some that they are the sources of night, and that  darkness pours from them at evening upon the world; while others hint  that knowledge of these might undo our civilization.    There watched him ceaselessly from the Under Pits those eyes whose duty  it is; from further within and deeper, the bats that dwell there arose  when they saw the surprise in the eyes; the sentinels on the bulwarks  beheld that stream of bats and lifted up their spears as it were for  war. Nevertheless when they perceived that that war for which they  watched was not now come upon them, they lowered their spears and  suffered him to enter, and he passed whirring through the earthward  gateway. Even so he came, as foretold, to the City of Never perched upon  Toldenarba, and saw late twilight on those pinnacles that know no other  light. All the domes were of copper, but the spires on their summits  were gold. Little steps of onyx ran all this way and that. With cobbled  agates were its streets a glory. Through small square panes of  rose-quartz the citizens looked from their houses. To them as they  looked abroad the World far-off seemed happy. Clad though that city was  in one robe always, in twilight, yet was its beauty worthy of even so  lovely a wonder: city and twilight were both peerless but for each  other. Built of a stone unknown in the world we tread were its bastions,  quarried we know not where, but called by the gnomes _abyx_, it so  flashed back to the twilight its glories, colour for colour, that none  can say of them where their boundary is, and which the eternal twilight,  and which the City of Never; they are the twin-born children, the  fairest daughters of Wonder. Time had been there, but not to work  destruction; he had turned to a fair, pale green the domes that were  made of copper, the rest he had left untouched, even he, the destroyer  of cities, by what bribe I know not averted. Nevertheless they often  wept in Never for change and passing away, mourning catastrophes in  other worlds, and they built temples sometimes to ruined stars that had  fallen flaming down from the Milky Way, giving them worship still when  by us long since forgotten. Other temples they have--who knows to what  divinities?    And he that was destined alone of men to come to the City of Never was  well content to behold it as he trotted down its agate street, with  the wings of his hippogriff furled, seeing at either side of him  marvel on marvel of which even China is ignorant. Then as he neared  the city's further rampart by which no inhabitant stirred, and looked  in a direction to which no houses faced with any rose-pink windows, he  suddenly saw far-off, dwarfing the mountains, an even greater city.  Whether that city was built upon the twilight or whether it rose from  the coasts of some other world he did not know. He saw it dominate the  City of Never, and strove to reach it; but at this unmeasured home of  unknown colossi the hippogriff shied frantically, and neither the  magic halter nor anything that he did could make the monster face it.  At last, from the City of Never's lonely outskirts where no  inhabitants walked, the rider turned slowly earthward. He knew now why  all the windows faced this way--the denizens of the twilight gazed at  the world and not at a greater than them. Then from the last step of  the earthward stairway, like lead past the Under Pits and down the  glittering face of Toldenarba, down from the overshadowed glories of  the gold-tipped City of Never and out of perpetual twilight, swooped  the man on his winged monster: the wind that slept at the time leaped  up like a dog at their onrush, it uttered a cry and ran past them.  Down on the World it was morning; night was roaming away with his  cloak trailed behind him, white mists turned over and over as he went,  the orb was grey but it glittered, lights blinked surprisingly in  early windows, forth over wet, dim fields went cows from their houses:  even in this hour touched the fields again the feet of the hippogriff.  And the moment that the man dismounted and took off his magic halter  the hippogriff flew slanting away with a whirr, going back to some  airy dancing-place of his people.    And he that surmounted glittering Toldenarba and came alone of men to  the City of Never has his name and his fame among nations; but he and  the people of that twilit city well know two things unguessed by other  men, they that there is another city fairer than theirs, and he--a  deed unaccomplished.        THE CORONATION OF MR. THOMAS SHAP      It was the occupation of Mr. Thomas Shap to persuade customers that  the goods were genuine and of an excellent quality, and that as  regards the price their unspoken will was consulted. And in order to  carry on this occupation he went by train very early every morning  some few miles nearer to the City from the suburb in which he slept.  This was the use to which he put his life.    From the moment when he first perceived (not as one reads a thing in a  book, but as truths are revealed to one's instinct) the very  beastliness of his occupation, and of the house that he slept in, its  shape, make and pretensions, and even of the clothes that he wore; from  that moment he withdrew his dreams from it, his fancies, his  ambitions, everything in fact except that ponderable Mr. Shap that  dressed in a frock-coat, bought tickets and handled money and could in  turn be handled by the statistician. The priest's share in Mr. Shap,  the share of the poet, never caught the early train to the City at  all.    He used to take little flights of fancy at first, dwelt all day in his  dreamy way on fields and rivers lying in the sunlight where it strikes  the world more brilliantly further South. And then he began to imagine  butterflies there; after that, silken people and the temples they  built to their gods.    They noticed that he was silent, and even absent at times, but they  found no fault with his behaviour with customers, to whom he remained  as plausible as of old. So he dreamed for a year, and his fancy gained  strength as he dreamed. He still read halfpenny papers in the train,  still discussed the passing day's ephemeral topic, still voted at  elections, though he no longer did these things with the whole  Shap--his soul was no longer in them.    He had had a pleasant year, his imagination was all new to him still,  and it had often discovered beautiful things away where it went,  southeast at the edge of the twilight. And he had a matter-of-fact and  logical mind, so that he often said, \"Why should I pay my twopence at  the electric theatre when I can see all sorts of things quite easily  without?\" Whatever he did was logical before anything else, and those  that knew him always spoke of Shap as \"a sound, sane, level-headed  man.\"    On far the most important day of his life he went as usual to town by  the early train to sell plausible articles to customers, while the  spiritual Shap roamed off to fanciful lands. As he walked from the  station, dreamy but wide awake, it suddenly struck him that the real  Shap was not the one walking to Business in black and ugly clothes,  but he who roamed along a jungle's edge near the ramparts of an old  and Eastern city that rose up sheer from the sand, and against which  the desert lapped with one eternal wave. He used to fancy the name of  that city was Larkar. \"After all, the fancy is as real as the body,\"  he said with perfect logic. It was a dangerous theory.    For that other life that he led he realized, as in Business, the  importance and value of method. He did not let his fancy roam too far  until it perfectly knew its first surroundings. Particularly he  avoided the jungle--he was not afraid to meet a tiger there (after all  it was not real), but stranger things might crouch there. Slowly he  built up Larkar:"]]]
