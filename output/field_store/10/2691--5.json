Good; so perish all who will not yield to their betters!    _Ly_. Very reasonable, Hermotimus; what was Euthydemus thinking of, to  irritate an old man who is purged of wrath and master of his passions,  when he had such a heavy goblet in his hand?    But we have time to spare--you might tell a friend like me the story of  your start in philosophy; then I might perhaps, if it is not too late,  begin now and join your school; you are my friends; you will not be  exclusive?    _Her_. If only you would, Lycinus! you will soon find out how much you are  superior to the rest of men. I do assure you, you will think them all  children, you will be so much wiser.    _Ly_. Enough for me, if after twenty years of it I am where you are now.    _Her_. Oh, I was about your age when I started on philosophy; I was forty;  and you must be about that.    _Ly_. Just that; so take and lead me on the same way; that is but right.  And first tell me--do you allow learners to criticize, if they find  difficulties in your doctrines, or must juniors abstain from that?    _Her_. Why, yes, they must; but _you_ shall have leave to ask questions  and criticize; you will learn easier that way.    _Ly_. I thank you for it, Hermotimus, by your name-God Hermes.    Now, is there only one road to philosophy--the Stoic way? they tell me  there are a great many other philosophers; is that so?    _Her_. Certainly--Peripatetics, Epicureans, Platonists, followers of  Diogenes, Antisthenes, Pythagoras, and more yet.    _Ly_. Quite so; numbers of them. Now, are their doctrines the same,  or different?    _Her_. Entirely different.    _Ly_. But the truth, I presume, is bound to be in one of them, and not in  all, as they differ?    _Her_. Certainly.    _Ly_. Then, as you love me, answer this: when you first went in pursuit of  philosophy, you found many gates wide open; what induced you to pass the  others by, and go in at the Stoic gate? Why did you assume that that was  the only true one, which would set you on the straight road to Virtue,  while the rest all opened on blind alleys? What was the test you applied  _then_? Please abolish your present self, the self which is now  instructed, or half-instructed, and better able to distinguish between  good and bad than we outsiders, and answer in your then character of a  layman, with no advantage over me as I am now.    _Her_. I cannot tell what you are driving at.    _Ly_. Oh, there is nothing recondite about it. There are a great many  philosophers--let us say Plato, Aristotle, Antisthenes, and your spiritual  fathers, Chrysippus, Zeno, and all the rest of them; what was it that  induced you, leaving the rest alone, to pick out the school you did from  among them all, and pin your philosophic faith to it? Were you favoured  like Chaerephon with a revelation from Apollo? Did he tell you the Stoics  were the best of men, and send you to their school? I dare say he  recommends different philosophers to different persons, according to  their individual needs?    _Her_. Nothing of the kind, Lycinus; I never consulted him upon it.    _Ly_. Why? was it not a _dignus vindice nodus_? or were you confident in  your own unaided discrimination?    _Her_. Why, yes; I was.    _Ly_. Then this must be my first lesson from you--how one can decide  out of hand which is the best and the true philosophy to be taken, and  the others left.    _Her_. I will tell you: I observed that it attracted most disciples, and  thence inferred that it was superior.    _Ly_. Give me figures; how many more of them than of Epicureans,  Platonists, Peripatetics? Of course you took a sort of show of hands.    _Her_. Well, no; I didn't count; I just guessed.    _Ly_. Now, now! you are not teaching, but hoaxing me; judge by guess  work and impression, indeed, on a thing of this importance! You are  hiding the truth.    _Her_. Well, that was not my only way; every one told me the Epicureans  were sensual and self-indulgent, the Peripatetics avaricious and  contentious, the Platonists conceited and vain; about the Stoics, on the  contrary, many said they had fortitude and an open mind; he who goes their  way, I heard, was the true king and millionaire and wise man, alone and  all in one.    _Ly_. And, of course, it was other people who so described them; you  would not have taken their own word for their excellences.    _Her_. Certainly not; it was others who said it.    _Ly_. Not their rivals, I suppose?    _Her_. Oh, no.    _Ly_. Laymen, then?    _Her_. Just so.    _Ly_. There you are again, cheating me with your irony; you take me for a  blockhead, who will believe that an intelligent person like Hermotimus, at  the age of forty, would accept the word of laymen about philosophy and  philosophers, and make his own selection on the strength of what they  said.    _Her_. But you see, Lycinus, I did not depend on their judgement entirely,  but on my own too. I saw the Stoics going about with dignity, decently  dressed and groomed, ever with a thoughtful air and a manly countenance,  as far from effeminacy as from the utter repulsive negligence of the  Cynics, bearing themselves, in fact, like moderate men; and every one  admits that moderation is right.    _Ly_. Did you ever see them behaving like your master, as I described him  to you just now? Lending money and clamouring for payment, losing their  tempers in philosophic debates, and making other exhibitions of  themselves? Or perhaps these are trifles, so long as the dress is  decent, the beard long, and the hair close-cropped? We are provided for  the future, then, with an infallible rule and balance, guaranteed by  Hermotimus? It is by appearance and walk and haircutting that the best  men are to be distinguished; and whosoever has not these marks, and is  not solemn and thoughtful, shall be condemned and rejected?    Nay, do not play with me like this; you want to see whether I shall catch  you at it.    _Her_. Why do you say that?    _Ly_. Because, my dear sir, this appearance test is one for statues;  _their_ decent orderly attire has it easily over the Stoics, because  Phidias or Alcamenes or Myron designed them to be graceful. However,  granting as much as you like that these are the right tests, what is a  blind man to do, if he wants to take up philosophy? how is he to find the  man whose principles are right, when he cannot see his appearance or gait?    _Her_. I am not teaching the blind, Lycinus; I have nothing to do with  them.    _Ly_. Ah, but, my good sir, there ought to have been some universal  criterion, in a matter of such great and general use. Still, if you will  have it so, let the blind be excluded from philosophy, as they cannot  see--though, by the way, they are just the people who most need  philosophy to console them for their misfortune; but now, the people who  _can_ see--give them the utmost possible acuity of vision, and what  can they detect of the spiritual qualities from this external shell?    What I mean is this: was it not from admiration of their _spirit_ that you  joined them, expecting to have your own spirit purified?    _Her_. Assuredly.    _Ly_. How could you possibly discern the true philosopher from the  false, then, by the marks you mentioned? It is not the way of such  qualities to come out like that; they are hidden and secret; they are  revealed only under long and patient observation, in talk and debate and  the conduct they inspire. You have probably heard of Momus's indictment  of Hephaestus; if not, you shall have it now. According to the myth,  Athene, Posidon, and Hephaestus had a match in inventiveness. Posidon  made a bull, Athene planned a house, Hephaestus constructed a man; when  they came before Momus, who was to judge, he examined their productions;  I need not trouble you with his criticisms of the other two; but his  objection to the man, and the fault he found with Hephaestus, was this:  he should have made a window in his chest, so that, when it was opened,  his thoughts and designs, his truth or falsehood, might have been  apparent. Momus must have been blear-eyed, to have such ideas about men;  but you have sharper eyes than Lynceus, and pierce through the chest to  what is inside; all is patent to you, not merely any man's wishes and  sentiments, but the comparative merits of any pair.    _Her_. You trifle, Lycinus. I made a pious choice, and do not repent it;  that is enough for me.    _Ly_. And will you yet make a mystery of it to your friend, and let him be  lost with the vulgar herd?    _Her_. Why, you will not accept anything I say.    _Ly_. On the contrary, my good sir, it is you who will not say anything I  can accept. Well, as you refuse me your confidence, and are so jealous of  my becoming a philosopher and your equal, I must even do my best to find  out the infallible test and learn to choose safely for myself. And you may  listen, if you like.    _Her_. That I will, Lycinus; you will very likely hit on some good idea.    _Ly_. Then attend, and do not mock me, if my inquiry is quite  unscientific; it is all I can do, as you, who know better, will not give  me any clearer light.    I conceive Virtue, then, under the figure of a State whose citizens are  happy--as your professor, who is one of them, phrases it,--absolutely  wise, all of them brave, just, and self-controlled, hardly  distinguishable, in fact, from Gods. All sorts of things that go on here,  such as robbery, assault, unfair gain, you will never find attempted  there, I believe; their relations are all peace and unity; and this is  quite natural, seeing that none of the things which elsewhere occasion  strife and rivalry, and prompt men to plot against their neighbours, so  much as come in their way at all. Gold, pleasures, distinctions, they  never regard as objects of dispute; they have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6593"],[0,"History of Tom Jones, a Foundling (#10)"],[1,"were  derived from the folly or villany of others, and not of the  unfortunate person himself. Besides this negative merit, the doctor  had one positive recommendation;--this was a great appearance of  religion. Whether his religion was real, or consisted only in  appearance, I shall not presume to say, as I am not possessed of any  touchstone which can distinguish the true from the false.    If this part of his character pleased Mr Allworthy, it delighted Miss  Bridget. She engaged him in many religious controversies; on which  occasions she constantly expressed great satisfaction in the doctor's  knowledge, and not much less in the compliments which he frequently  bestowed on her own. To say the truth, she had read much English  divinity, and had puzzled more than one of the neighbouring curates.  Indeed, her conversation was so pure, her looks so sage, and her whole  deportment so grave and solemn, that she seemed to deserve the name of  saint equally with her namesake, or with any other female in the Roman  kalendar.    As sympathies of all kinds are apt to beget love, so experience  teaches us that none have a more direct tendency this way than those  of a religious kind between persons of different sexes. The doctor  found himself so agreeable to Miss Bridget, that he now began to  lament an unfortunate accident which had happened to him about ten  years before; namely, his marriage with another woman, who was not  only still alive, but, what was worse, known to be so by Mr Allworthy.  This was a fatal bar to that happiness which he otherwise saw  sufficient probability of obtaining with this young lady; for as to  criminal indulgences, he certainly never thought of them. This was  owing either to his religion, as is most probable, or to the purity of  his passion, which was fixed on those things which matrimony only, and  not criminal correspondence, could put him in possession of, or could  give him any title to.    He had not long ruminated on these matters, before it occurred to his  memory that he had a brother who was under no such unhappy incapacity.  This brother he made no doubt would succeed; for he discerned, as he  thought, an inclination to marriage in the lady; and the reader  perhaps, when he hears the brother's qualifications, will not blame  the confidence which he entertained of his success.    This gentleman was about thirty-five years of age. He was of a middle  size, and what is called well-built. He had a scar on his forehead,  which did not so much injure his beauty as it denoted his valour (for  he was a half-pay officer). He had good teeth, and something affable,  when he pleased, in his smile; though naturally his countenance, as  well as his air and voice, had much of roughness in it: yet he could  at any time deposit this, and appear all gentleness and good-humour.  He was not ungenteel, nor entirely devoid of wit, and in his youth had  abounded in sprightliness, which, though he had lately put on a more  serious character, he could, when he pleased, resume.    He had, as well as the doctor, an academic education; for his father  had, with the same paternal authority we have mentioned before,  decreed him for holy orders; but as the old gentleman died before he  was ordained, he chose the church military, and preferred the king's  commission to the bishop's.    He had purchased the post of lieutenant of dragoons, and afterwards  came to be a captain; but having quarrelled with his colonel, was by  his interest obliged to sell; from which time he had entirely  rusticated himself, had betaken himself to studying the Scriptures,  and was not a little suspected of an inclination to methodism.    It seemed, therefore, not unlikely that such a person should succeed  with a lady of so saint-like a disposition, and whose inclinations  were no otherwise engaged than to the marriage state in general; but  why the doctor, who certainly had no great friendship for his brother,  should for his sake think of making so ill a return to the hospitality  of Allworthy, is a matter not so easy to be accounted for.    Is it that some natures delight in evil, as others are thought to  delight in virtue? Or is there a pleasure in being accessory to a  theft when we cannot commit it ourselves? Or lastly (which experience  seems to make probable), have we a satisfaction in aggrandizing our  families, even though we have not the least love or respect for them?    Whether any of these motives operated on the doctor, we will not  determine; but so the fact was. He sent for his brother, and easily  found means to introduce him at Allworthy's as a person who intended  only a short visit to himself.    The captain had not been in the house a week before the doctor had  reason to felicitate himself on his discernment. The captain was  indeed as great a master of the art of love as Ovid was formerly. He  had besides received proper hints from his brother, which he failed  not to improve to the best advantage.        Chapter xi.    Containing many rules, and some examples, concerning falling in love:  descriptions of beauty, and other more prudential inducements to  matrimony.      It hath been observed, by wise men or women, I forget which, that all  persons are doomed to be in love once in their lives. No particular  season is, as I remember, assigned for this; but the age at which Miss  Bridget was arrived, seems to me as proper a period as any to be fixed  on for this purpose: it often, indeed, happens much earlier; but when  it doth not, I have observed it seldom or never fails about this time.  Moreover, we may remark that at this season love is of a more serious  and steady nature than what sometimes shows itself in the younger  parts of life. The love of girls is uncertain, capricious, and so  foolish that we cannot always discover what the young lady would be  at; nay, it may almost be doubted whether she always knows this  herself.    Now we are never at a loss to discern this in women about forty; for  as such grave, serious, and experienced ladies well know their own  meaning, so it is always very easy for a man of the least sagacity to  discover it with the utmost certainty.    Miss Bridget is an example of all these observations. She had not been  many times in the captain's company before she was seized with this  passion. Nor did she go pining and moping about the house, like a  puny, foolish girl, ignorant of her distemper: she felt, she knew, and  she enjoyed, the pleasing sensation, of which, as she was certain it  was not only innocent but laudable, she was neither afraid nor  ashamed.    And to say the truth, there is, in all points, great difference  between the reasonable passion which women at this age conceive  towards men, and the idle and childish liking of a girl to a boy,  which is often fixed on the outside only, and on things of little  value and no duration; as on cherry-cheeks, small, lily-white hands,  sloe-black eyes, flowing locks, downy chins, dapper shapes; nay,  sometimes on charms more worthless than these, and less the party's  own; such are the outward ornaments of the person, for which men are  beholden to the taylor, the laceman, the periwig-maker, the hatter,  and the milliner, and not to nature. Such a passion girls may well be  ashamed, as they generally are, to own either to themselves or others.    The love of Miss Bridget was of another kind. The captain owed nothing  to any of these fop-makers in his dress, nor was his person much more  beholden to nature. Both his dress and person were such as, had they  appeared in an assembly or a drawing-room, would have been the  contempt and ridicule of all the fine ladies there. The former of  these was indeed neat, but plain, coarse, ill-fancied, and out of  fashion. As for the latter, we have expressly described it above. So  far was the skin on his cheeks from being cherry-coloured, that you  could not discern what the natural colour of his cheeks was, they  being totally overgrown by a black beard, which ascended to his eyes.  His shape and limbs were indeed exactly proportioned, but so large  that they denoted the strength rather of a ploughman than any other.  His shoulders were broad beyond all size, and the calves of his legs  larger than those of a common chairman. In short, his whole person  wanted all that elegance and beauty which is the very reverse of  clumsy strength, and which so agreeably sets off most of our fine  gentlemen; being partly owing to the high blood of their ancestors,  viz., blood made of rich sauces and generous wines, and partly to an  early town education.    Though Miss Bridget was a woman of the greatest delicacy of taste, yet  such were the charms of the captain's conversation, that she totally  overlooked the defects of his person. She imagined, and perhaps very  wisely, that she should enjoy more agreeable minutes with the captain  than with a much prettier fellow; and forewent the consideration of  pleasing her eyes, in order to procure herself much more solid  satisfaction.    The captain no sooner perceived the passion of Miss Bridget, in which  discovery he was very quick-sighted, than he faithfully returned it.  The lady, no more than her lover, was remarkable for beauty. I would  attempt to draw her picture, but that is done already by a more able  master, Mr Hogarth himself, to whom she sat many years ago, and hath  been lately exhibited by that gentleman in his print of a winter's  morning, of which she was no improper emblem, and may be seen walking  (for walk she doth in the print) to Covent Garden church, with a  starved foot-boy behind carrying her prayer-book.    The captain likewise very wisely preferred the more solid enjoyments  he expected with this lady, to the fleeting charms of person. He was  one of those wise men who regard beauty in the other sex as a very  worthless and superficial qualification; or, to speak more truly, who  rather chuse to possess"]]]
