However, all specimens from Guatemala, other than those  from Sacapulas, were referred by Goodwin (1934:40) to _B. m.  nigrescens_. My studies reveal a grayish-brown population in central  Honduras near to and including the type locality. This population  appears to grade into a slightly paler, particularly as concerns color  of hind foot and tail, group of Guatemalan mice from 1 mi. S Rabinal,  from 1/2 mi. N, 1 mi. E Salama, and from Lake Atescatempa. Specimens  from western Guatemala at Nenton and Jacaltenango, on the other hand,  are darker brownish-black, more nearly like the paratypical series of  _nigrescens_ from the Valley of Comitan, Chiapas, Republic of Mexico.  This darker brownish-black color of the back persists in specimens from  southern Guatemala and El Salvador (see specimens examined of _B. m.  nigrescens_ for localities), and they are best referred to _nigrescens_.  _B. m. grisescens_, in color and certain cranial characters, therefore,  seems to grade into two different subspecies: (1) _B. m. handleyi_, pale  mice in the Rio Negro valley in central Guatemala, and (2) _B. m.  nigrescens_, dark mice from southern Guatemala, and parts of El  Salvador.    Felten (1958:136) referred all _B. musculus_ from El Salvador to _B. m.  grisescens_. Although I have not examined the specimens reported on by  Felten (_loc. cit._), I have examined specimens from Lake Atescatempa,  Guatemala (which I refer to _grisescens_), not too distant from Cerro  Blanco, and Finca Las Canarias, Department of Ahuachapan, and Laguna de  Guija, Department of Santa Ana (localities listed by Felten). It would  seem that specimens from these localities might indeed be _grisescens_.  However, specimens that I examined from 1 mi. S Los Planes, and 1 mi. NW  San Salvador were considerably darker than paratypes of _grisescens_ and  were nearly intermediate in color between _nigrescens_ and _pullus_. I  refer the specimens from 1 mi. NW San Salvador, and 1 mi. S Los Planes  to _nigrescens_ rather than to _grisescens_.    There is no positive evidence that _B. m. grisescens_ intergrades with  _B. m. pullus_ to the south in Nicaragua. But, there is a suggestion  that intergradation occurs between these subspecies in a series of 76  skins from La Piedra de Jesus Sabana Grande, Honduras, referable to  _grisescens_. A total of 16 of 76 skins from this locality (21 per cent)  possess the mid-ventral white stripe found in 18 of 20 skins (90 per  cent), from the type locality of _pullus_ in Nicaragua. Further  collection in areas between central Honduras and western Nicaragua may  yield specimens of _B. musculus_ that are intermediate in characters  between _grisescens_ and _pullus_.    _Specimens examined._--Total 149, distributed as follows: GUATEMALA: 1  mi.

S. Nat. Mus. (Biol.  Surv. Coll.); Sacapulas, El Quiche, Guatemala; obtained on April 24,  1947, by Charles O. Handley, Jr., original number 991.    _Range._--Known only from the type locality in the valley of the Rio  Negro. Zonal range: Part of the Chimaltenangan Province of Smith  (1949:235).    _Diagnosis._--Size medium to large for the species; dorsum Wood Brown in  some series to Buffy Brown; guard hairs of dorsum black-tipped, color of  underhairs Avellaneous; hairs white to base in region of chin, throat,  and median venter; in lateral region, hairs Neutral Gray at base; dorsal  surfaces of forefeet and hind feet and ankles white; tail white below,  brownish above; nasals truncate anteriorly; frontoparietal suture  forming an obtuse angle with the suture separating the parietals;  alveolar length of upper molar tooth-row and tail long. Average and  extreme external and cranial measurements for nine adults from the type  locality are as follows: Total length, 121.4 (115-128); length of tail  vertebrae, 50.7 (49-54); length of body, 70.8 (66-77); length of hind  foot, 15.3 (15-16); occipitonasal length, 19.6 (18.8-20.7); zygomatic  breadth, 10.5 (10.2-11.0); postpalatal length, 6.9 (6.4-7.4); least  interorbital breadth, 4.0 (3.9-4.0); length of incisive foramina, 4.2  (4.0-4.5); length of rostrum, 7.2 (7.0-7.7); breadth of braincase, 9.8  (9.7-10.2); depth of cranium, 7.1 (6.8-7.2); alveolar length of  maxillary tooth-row, 3.5 (3.4-3.6); for photographs of skull, see Plate  1_c_, and Plate 3_c_.    _Comparisons._--From _B. m. nigrescens_, _B. m. handleyi_ differs as  follows: everywhere paler; forefeet and hind feet whitish instead of  dusky to sooty; hairs of anterior part of face white instead of brown;  tail bicolored instead of unicolored; anterior tips of nasals truncate  rather than rounded; frontoparietal suture forming obtuse angle with  suture separating parietals instead of forming right angle; tail and  upper molar tooth-row longer.    From _B. m. grisescens_, _B. m. handleyi_ differs in: slightly paler  above and below, primarily as a result of lacking buff-colored hairs;  forefeet and hind feet white, not flesh-colored with gray overtones;  tail bicolored, not unicolored; anterior tips of nasals truncate rather  than flaring; tail and upper molar tooth-row longer.    _Remarks._--_B. m. handleyi_ seems to be restricted to the valley of the  Rio Negro, in the region of Sacapulas, Guatemala. Stuart (1954:7) points  out that the Rio Negro drops down into a gorge at a place near Sacapulas  and flows northward through a deep canyon for approximately 60  kilometers. The Rio Negro, then, flows onto the lowlands of the Yucatan  Peninsula. The habitat is xerophytic in the valley of the Rio Negro near  Sacapulas. Stuart (_op. cit._:10) suggests that this xerophytic habitat  may be continuous to a place to the north of Chixoy, Chiapas, where the  vegetation then becomes more mesic. The mesic conditions to the north in  Tabasco and Yucatan probably have restricted the movement of pygmy mice  to the north. No specimens of this mouse are known from the Yucatan  Peninsula or from the State of Tabasco, Mexico. _B. m. handleyi_  intergrades with _B. m. grisescens_ to the south. Specimens from 1 mi. S  Rabinal, and those from a second locality 1/2 mi. N and 1 mi. E Salama,  Guatemala, are intermediate in color of pelage between _handleyi_ and  _grisescens_. Stuart (_op. cit._:5) mentions the continuity of habitat  and tributaries from the Salama Basin into the valley of the Rio Negro.  Absence of physiographic and biotic barriers in the corridor between  these two basins probably allows for some gene flow between _handleyi_  and _grisescens_, and results in populations intermediate in color. To  the north and northwest of Sacapulas, the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes  rises abruptly and separates the known geographic range of _handleyi_  from that of _nigrescens_ to the north, while to the west the  cactus-mesquite habitat of _handleyi_ gives way to the oak-pine timber  that, so far as known, does not support _Baiomys_. The difference in  elevation and flora seems to restrict gene flow between _handleyi_ and  the more northern _nigrescens_. The only evidence of integration between  these two subspecies is provided by one specimen from Chanquejelve,  Guatemala. That specimen is intermediate in color between the pale  _handleyi_ and blackish-brown _nigrescens_.    The subspecies closest, geographically, to _B. m. handleyi_ is _B. m.  nigrescens_, from which _B. m. handleyi_ differs more in color than from  any of the other named subspecies, except _B. m. pullus_. There is a  close correlation of pallor of mice and the xeric Rio Negro Valley, and  the darkness (melanistic color) of mice and the mesic mountains and  valleys to the north.    _Specimens examined._--Total 49, from GUATEMALA: type locality,  including the type: 12 (U.

Snails and frogs serve as intermediate hosts for various  stages in the life cycle of these flukes. The high percentage of  cottonmouths infested with flukes is indicative of the use of frogs as a  major source of food. Less than ten flukes were usually observed in the  snakes' mouths but occasionally more were seen. One snake was observed  thrashing about in its cage for nearly an hour, after which time it  died. Upon examination of the mouth, 32 flukes were found, most of which  were located in the Jacobson's organs. Whether or not flukes caused the  death is not known. Nematodes (_Kalicephalus_ sp.) were found in the  stomach of each of several preserved specimens; most of these snakes had  no food in their digestive tracts. In a high percentage of the  moccasins, tapeworms (_Ophiotaenia_ sp.) were in the duodenum, in many  instances so tightly packed as seemingly to prevent passage of food. The  importance of fish in the diet is reflected by the high percentage of  snakes containing tapeworms. An unidentified cyst (?) about an inch long  and containing two hooks on one end was found attached to the outer wall  of the stomach of a cottonmouth. Yamaguti (1958) listed all the kinds of  helminths known from cottonmouths.      Miscellaneous Causes of Death    Munro (1949:71-72) reported on the lethal effect of 10 per cent DDT  powder on two young cottonmouths which were dusted with it to kill  mites. Herald (1949:117) reported an equal effect caused by spraying a  five per cent DDT solution in a room with several snakes. All but three  large cottonmouths, which were under shelter at the time of spraying,  were killed.    One individual that refused to eat was dissected soon after death, and a  short piece of a branch on which two large thorns were located at 90 deg.  angles was found blocking the intestine at the posterior end of the  stomach.    An unexpected and probably unusual circumstance caused the death of two  captives. After cleaning a cage containing five cottonmouths and placing  several mice in the cage for food, I noticed two of the snakes lying  stretched out, partially on one side, and almost unable to move. At  first I thought they had been bitten by other snakes which were in  pursuit of the mice. The two died after two days. When a similar  incident occurred in another cage, I removed the \"bitten\" snake and it  fully recovered after 11 days. When the same symptoms were observed in a  garter snake in another cage, I realized that in each instance the cage  had been cleaned and fresh cedar chips placed in it immediately prior to  observation of these symptoms. Fine cedar dust on the chips had  evidently poisoned the snakes.          BEHAVIOR    Annual and Diel Cycles of Activity      In the days following emergence in spring, cottonmouths often endure  uncomfortable and even dangerous temperatures in order to obtain food  and mates. They are more sluggish at this time and more vulnerable to  predation than later in the season when temperatures are optimal. Fitch  (1956:463) found that copperheads in northeastern Kansas begin their  annual cycle of activity in the latter part of April, when the daily  maximum temperature is about 22 deg. C. and the minimum is about 4 deg. C., and  become dormant in late October or early November, at which time the  daily maximum temperature is about 15 deg. and the minimum is about 0 deg..  Indications are that in the northern part of its range the annual  activity cycle of the cottonmouth resembles that of the copperhead in  northeastern Kansas. Klimstra (1959:2) captured cottonmouths from April  to October in southern Illinois. Barbour (1956:36) collected large  numbers of them in early April in Kentucky and stated that they migrate  from swamps to wooded hillsides in late August and early September.  Spring migrations begin after a few consecutive warm days in March. In  northern Oklahoma cottonmouths have been found along the Verdigris River  as early as March, suggesting that a few winter in crayfish holes and  mammal burrows. The majority of individuals found in this area were at  denning sites along cliffs above the river and emerged later than those  near the river (Dundee and Burger, 1948:1-2). In Virginia cottonmouths  have been seen as early as March 5 (Martin and Wood, 1955:237) and as  late as December 4. They have been observed in migration from the swamps  of the barrier beach to the mainland in late October and early November  in southeastern Virginia (Wood, 1954a:159). According to Neill  (1947:204), the cottonmouth tolerates lower temperatures than do most  snakes in Georgia and is one of the last to go into hibernation. Allen  and Swindell (1948:4) stated that cottonmouths usually bask during the  mornings of the cooler months in Florida, but they mentioned nothing of  denning such as occurs farther north. Although winter aggregations occur  in the northern parts of the range, I have never seen such aggregations  in the South. However, in one instance related to me by a reliable  observer, seven cottonmouths were found together on a creek bank near  the Gulf Coast in early spring.    During late summer and early autumn, fat is deposited in lobes in the  lower abdomen in preparation for the period of winter quiescence. Gravid  females usually do not feed so frequently or so much as other snakes,  because they tend to become inactive as the ova develop. Whether or not  females feed heavily after parturition and previous to denning is not  known. Peaks of activity in autumn may be caused by final attempts to  feed before denning and by the appearance of large numbers of newborn  young. The young usually have from one to two months in which to feed  before the advent of cold weather. According to Barbour's (_op.  cit._:38) findings, the young probably feed before hibernation because  they grow substantially in winter. For those that do not feed, the rate  of survival is perhaps much lower.    In preparation for winter, cottonmouths migrate inland, usually to dry  forested hillsides where they den, commonly among rocks at the tops of  bluffs, along with several other species of snakes. In such aggregations  there is no hostility and each individual may derive benefit from  contact with others by which favorable conditions of temperature and  humidity are maintained.    Neill (1947:204) has found many specimens in winter by tearing bark from  rotting pine stumps on hillsides overlooking lakes or streams. On cold  days they evidently retreat below the surface, while on warm days they  lie just below the bark or emerge and bask. Neill believes that the use  of stumps by cottonmouths is an innate pattern of behavior, because of  the large number of young-of-the-year found in such surroundings.  Cottonmouths were observed in winter also under logs and stumps by Allen  (1932:17). I have twice observed cottonmouths crawling into crayfish  burrows along the Gulf Coast of Texas, and suppose they are used as  denning sites to some extent.    The diel cycle of activity of cottonmouths is of necessity closely  related to the seasonal cycle. Since optimal temperatures determine  activity, the diel cycle varies greatly from time to time. It has been  well established that cottonmouths, like most other crotalids and many  snakes of other families, prefer nocturnal to diurnal activity, even  though the temperature may be less favorable at night. This preference  is correlated with increased nocturnal activity of frogs and reptiles  that constitute the principal food supply.    During spring and autumn, activity is more restricted to the day and  long periods of basking occur. However, as hot weather approaches,  basking occurs mainly in the morning and evening and activity becomes  primarily nocturnal. But, in well shaded, moist forests, cottonmouths  feed actively in the daytime.    Availability of food also has an important influence upon activity.  Allen and Swindell (_op. cit._:5) stated that moccasins congregate  around drying ponds and feed on dying fish until the moccasins can hold  no more. They then usually stay nearby as long as food remains. In an  area of the Stephen F. Austin Experimental Forest near Nacogdoches,  Texas, many cottonmouths journey daily to and from a swamp and a dry  field, evidently to feed on rodents inhabiting the area. Ten individuals  captured along a snake-proof fence that was built 30 yards from the  swamp were found lying coiled along the fence after 4:30 p.m., at which  time the area was shaded. On another occasion, I captured a large  cottonmouth that was feeding upon dying fish in a drying pool about  10:30 a.m. on August 19, 1962.    Because of the aquatic habits of the cottonmouth, relative humidity  probably has little influence on the snake's activity. However,  cottonmouths are more restricted to the vicinity of water in dry weather  than during rains or muggy weather when many of their natural prey  species also move about more freely. Increased activity on cloudy days  may result from protection from long exposure to sunshine. Torrential  rains and floods, such as those following hurricanes along the Gulf and  Atlantic coasts of the southeastern United States, bring out quantities  of snakes of all species. Rattlesnakes and cottonmouths in particular  are killed by the thousands at these times because they seek shelter in  human habitations. However, these are unusual circumstances and do not  reflect voluntary activity as a result of preferences.    Thermal reactions of reptiles were classified by Cowles and Bogert  (1944) into several categories. For each species there is a basking and  normal activity range limited by the voluntary minimum and voluntary  maximum at which the animal seeks shelter. Beyond this normal range are  the critical thermal minimum and critical thermal maximum (C. T. M.) at  which effective locomotion is prevented. The lethal minimum and maximum  are those"]]]
