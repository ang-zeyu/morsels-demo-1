To mention no  others, Polybius, one of the gravest and most judicious, as well as most  moral writers of antiquity, has assigned this selfish origin to all our  sentiments of virtue. [Footnote: Undutifulness to parents is disapproved  of by mankind, [Greek quotation inserted here]. Ingratitude for a like  reason (though he seems there to mix a more generous regard) [Greek  quotation inserted here] Lib. vi cap. 4. (Ed. Gronorius.) Perhaps the  historian only meant, that our sympathy and humanity was more enlivened,  by our considering the similarity of our case with that of the person  suffering; which is a just sentiment.] But though the solid practical  sense of that author, and his aversion to all vain subtilties, render  his authority on the present subject very considerable; yet is not  this an affair to be decided by authority, and the voice of nature and  experience seems plainly to oppose the selfish theory.    We frequently bestow praise on virtuous actions, performed in very  distant ages and remote countries; where the utmost subtilty of  imagination would not discover any appearance of self-interest, or  find any connexion of our present happiness and security with events so  widely separated from us.    A generous, a brave, a noble deed, performed by an adversary, commands  our approbation; while in its consequences it may be acknowledged  prejudicial to our particular interest.    Where private advantage concurs with general affection for virtue, we  readily perceive and avow the mixture of these distinct sentiments,  which have a very different feeling and influence on the mind. We  praise, perhaps, with more alacrity, where the generous humane action  contributes to our particular interest: But the topics of praise, which  we insist on, are very wide of this circumstance. And we may attempt to  bring over others to our sentiments, without endeavouring to convince  them, that they reap any advantage from the actions which we recommend  to their approbation and applause.    Frame the model of a praiseworthy character, consisting of all the most  amiable moral virtues: Give instances, in which these display themselves  after an eminent and extraordinary manner: You readily engage the esteem  and approbation of all your audience, who never so much as enquire  in what age and country the person lived, who possessed these noble  qualities: A circumstance, however, of all others, the most material  to self-love, or a concern for our own individual happiness. Once on a  time, a statesman, in the shock and contest of parties, prevailed so far  as to procure, by his eloquence, the banishment of an able adversary;  whom he secretly followed, offering him money for his support during his  exile, and soothing him with topics of consolation in his misfortunes.  ALAS! cries the banished statesman, WITH WHAT REGRET MUST I LEAVE MY  FRIENDS IN THIS CITY, WHERE EVEN ENEMIES ARE SO GENEROUS! Virtue, though  in an enemy, here pleased him: And we also give it the just tribute  of praise and approbation; nor do we retract these sentiments, when we  hear, that the action passed at Athens, about two thousand years ago,  and that the persons' names were Eschines and Demosthenes.    WHAT IS THAT TO ME? There are few occasions, when this question is not  pertinent: And had it that universal, infallible influence supposed,  it would turn into ridicule every composition, and almost every  conversation, which contain any praise or censure of men and manners.    It is but a weak subterfuge, when pressed by these facts and arguments,  to say, that we transport ourselves, by the force of imagination, into  distant ages and countries, and consider the advantage, which we should  have reaped from these characters, had we been contemporaries, and  had any commerce with the persons. It is not conceivable, how a REAL  sentiment or passion can ever arise from a known IMAGINARY interest;  especially when our REAL interest is still kept in view, and is often  acknowledged to be entirely distinct from the imaginary, and even  sometimes opposite to it.    A man, brought to the brink of a precipice, cannot look down without  trembling; and the sentiment of IMAGINARY danger actuates him, in  opposition to the opinion and belief of REAL safety. But the imagination  is here assisted by the presence of a striking object; and yet prevails  not, except it be also aided by novelty, and the unusual appearance of  the object. Custom soon reconciles us to heights and precipices, and  wears off these false and delusive terrors. The reverse is observable in  the estimates which we form of characters and manners; and the more we  habituate ourselves to an accurate scrutiny of morals, the more delicate  feeling do we acquire of the most minute distinctions between vice and  virtue. Such frequent occasion, indeed, have we, in common life, to  pronounce all kinds of moral determinations, that no object of this kind  can be new or unusual to us; nor could any FALSE views or prepossessions  maintain their ground against an experience, so common and familiar.  Experience being chiefly what forms the associations of ideas, it is  impossible that any association could establish and support itself, in  direct opposition to that principle.    Usefulness is agreeable, and engages our approbation. This is a matter  of fact, confirmed by daily observation. But, USEFUL? For what? For  somebody's interest, surely. Whose interest then? Not our own only: For  our approbation frequently extends farther. It must, therefore, be the  interest of those, who are served by the character or action approved  of; and these we may conclude, however remote, are not totally  indifferent to us. By opening up this principle, we shall discover one  great source of moral distinctions.        PART II.        Self-love is a principle in human nature of such extensive energy, and  the interest of each individual is, in general, so closely connected  with that of the community, that those philosophers were excusable, who  fancied that all our concern for the public might be resolved into a  concern for our own happiness and preservation. They saw every moment,  instances of approbation or blame, satisfaction or displeasure  towards characters and actions; they denominated the objects of these  sentiments, VIRTUES, or VICES; they observed, that the former had  a tendency to increase the happiness, and the latter the misery of  mankind; they asked, whether it were possible that we could have any  general concern for society, or any disinterested resentment of the  welfare or injury of others; they found it simpler to consider all  these sentiments as modifications of self-love; and they discovered a  pretence, at least, for this unity of principle, in that close union of  interest, which is so observable between the public and each individual.    But notwithstanding this frequent confusion of interests, it is easy  to attain what natural philosophers, after Lord Bacon, have affected to  call the experimentum crucis, or that experiment which points out the  right way in any doubt or ambiguity. We have found instances, in  which private interest was separate from public; in which it was  even contrary: And yet we observed the moral sentiment to continue,  notwithstanding this disjunction of interests. And wherever these  distinct interests sensibly concurred, we always found a sensible  increase of the sentiment, and a more warm affection to virtue, and  detestation of vice, or what we properly call, GRATITUDE and REVENGE.  Compelled by these instances, we must renounce the theory, which  accounts for every moral sentiment by the principle of self-love. We  must adopt a more public affection, and allow, that the interests of  society are not, even on their own account, entirely indifferent to  us. Usefulness is only a tendency to a certain end; and it is a  contradiction in terms, that anything pleases as means to an end, where  the end itself no wise affects us. If usefulness, therefore, be a source  of moral sentiment, and if this usefulness be not always considered with  a reference to self; it follows, that everything, which contributes to  the happiness of society, recommends itself directly to our approbation  and good-will. Here is a principle, which accounts, in great part, for  the origin of morality: And what need we seek for abstruse and remote  systems, when there occurs one so obvious and natural?    [FOOTNOTE: It is needless to push our researches so far as to ask, why  we have humanity or a fellow-feeling with others. It is sufficient,  that this is experienced to be a principle in human nature. We must stop  somewhere in our examination of causes; and there are, in every science,  some general principles, beyond which we cannot hope to find any  principle more general. No man is absolutely indifferent to the  happiness and misery of others. The first has a natural tendency to give  pleasure; the second, pain. This every one may find in himself. It is  not probable, that these principles can be resolved into principles  more simple and universal, whatever attempts may have been made to that  purpose. But if it were possible, it belongs not to the present subject;  and we may here safely consider these principles as original; happy, if  we can render all the consequences sufficiently plain and perspicuous!]    Have we any difficulty to comprehend the force of humanity and  benevolence? Or to conceive, that the very aspect of happiness,  joy, prosperity, gives pleasure; that of pain, suffering, sorrow,  communicates uneasiness? The human countenance, says Horace ['Uti  ridentibus arrident, ita flentibus adflent Humani vultus,'--Hor.],  borrows smiles or tears from the human countenance.

[New Series.], August 10, 1878 (#10)"],[1," still further by means of the  minutest known organic form, _Bacterium termo_. The lecturer had, in  connection with Dr. Drysdale, discovered that the movements of this  marvelously minute living thing were effected by means of a pair of fine  fibers or \"flagella.\" These were so delicate as to be invisible to  everything but the most powerful and specially constructed lenses and  the most delicate retinas. But since this discovery, Dr. Koch, of  Germany, had actually photographed the flagella of much larger bacteria,  such as _Bacillus subtilis_, and expressed his conviction that the whole  group was flagellate. Mr. Dallinger determined then to try to measure  the diameter of this minute _flagellum_ of _B. termo_ that the real  power of magnification in our present lenses might be tested. This was a  most difficult task, but 200 measurements were made with four different  lenses, and the results were for the mean of the first 50 measurements  0.00000489208; for the second, 0.00000488673; for the third,  0.00000488024; for the fourth, 0.00000488200, giving a mean value for  the whole, expressed in vulgar fractions, of the 1/204700 of an inch as  the diameter of the flagellum of _B. termo_.    With such power of analysis it was manifest that immense results might  be expected from a good use of the \"highest powers.\" The proper method  of using them was next dwelt on, and then the apparatus was described,  by means of which a drop of fluid containing any organism that was being  studied might be prevented from evaporating while under the scrutiny of  the most powerful lenses, and for an indefinite length of time. The  importance of studying such organisms in this way--by continuous  observation--was then plainly shown, some of the peculiar inferences of  Dr. Bastian, as to the transmutation of bacteria into monads, and monads  into amoebae, etc., being explained by discontinuity of observation.           *       *       *       *       *                                    =Wages in England.=    Consul General Badeau reports that during the past five years wages have  increased gradually about 10 per cent, while the cost of living has  increased about 25 per cent. Clothing is about 30 per cent higher, while  fuel has not risen in price. Agricultural laborers get from $2 to $3 per  week, including beer; building laborers and gardeners from $4.40 to  $5.10 per week; bricklayers, carpenters, masons, and engineers from  $6.80 to $11 per week; cabinetmakers, printers, and jewelers from $8 to  $12.30 per week, although the best marble masons and jewelers receive  $14.75. Bootmakers and tailors get from $4.86 to $7.65 per week, and  bakers from $4.65 to $7.25, with partial board. Women servants are paid  from $70 to $240 per annum. Railway porters and laborers on public works  get from $4.45 to $12 per week. Rents have risen some 30 per cent, and  are, for artisans in London, from $1.20 to $2.40 per week for one or two  rooms.           *       *       *       *       *                           =The Treatment of Cancer by Pressure.=    M. Bouchut has recently introduced to the notice of the members of the  Academie des Sciences a cuirasse of vulcanized caoutchouc, which he has  used with success for the treatment of cancerous and other tumors of the  breast. In this country there has been much division of opinion upon the  utility of pressure in the treatment of cancer, some surgeons regarding  it as harmful, or but rarely useful, others attributing to it great  retardation of the rapidity of growth of the tumor, or even cure. The  surgeons of Middlesex Hospital studied it systematically some years ago,  and gave an unfavorable report. The theory of the plan is certainly  good: a neoplasia, like a healthy tissue, is dependent upon its blood  supply for vitality and growth, and complete anaemia causes the death of  a tumor, as it does of a patch of brain substance. It will be remembered  that Mr. Haward last year related at the Clinical Society a case in  point. He ligatured the left lingual artery for a recurrent epithelioma  of the tongue; the tumor sloughed away, and a fortnight before the  patient's death from blood poisoning the tongue was quite healed. In  just the same way ischaemia will impair the vitality and so lessen the  growth of a tumor. The difficulty is rather in the practical application  of this theory. The knowledge that we now possess of the mode of growth  of cancers gives us at least one important indication. If we have to  deal with a neoplasia that grows at the periphery by gradual  infiltration of the surrounding tissues, it is plain that, for pressure  to be useful, it must be applied around the tumor rather than over it,  where, by compressing and obstructing the capillaries, it would cause  overfullness of those at the circumference. It is the periphery of a  cancer that is its active part, and we must, therefore, produce ischaemia  around and not in the tumor. In the application of the treatment this  must be obtained by the careful adjustment of elastic pads or cotton  wool, and as the whole success of the plan depends upon the skill with  which this is done, too much attention cannot be given to it. We cannot  regard pressure as a substitute for removal of a cancer; but in the  frequent cases where this is impracticable it appears to be the best  substitute at present open to the surgeon. M. Bouchut's cuirasse would  seem to be an improvement upon the spring pads and other appliances in  use in this country.--_Lancet._           *       *       *       *       *                      =NEW CUTTING AND BORING ATTACHMENT FOR LATHES.=    Our engraving represents a useful little machine which is intended for  attachment to lathes. Although it is exceedingly simple it is capable of  performing a great variety of work.    The machine is used in two ways, either by attachment to a rigid  support, as shown in Fig. 1, or by suspending it by a belt, so that it  is capable of universal motion, as shown in Fig. 2.    The supporting frame, A, has three boxes for the spindle, B, and on the  shaft at one side of the middle box there are planing knives, C, on the  opposite side there is a balance wheel, and a pulley for receiving the  driving belt. The spindle, B, extends beyond the ends of the frame, A,  and has at each end a socket for receiving interchangeable cutting and  boring tools. One end of the spindle is externally threaded to receive a  face plate, to which may be attached a disk of wood for receiving  sandpaper for smoothing and polishing wood or metal.    The frame, A, is held to its work by means of handles, A', and the  spindle is driven by a round belt that passes over a suspended pulley,  E, and also over the pulley on the lathe mandrel.    The entire attachment is balanced by a weight, F, attached to a cord  that passes over a fixed pulley, F', to the pulley, E, to which it is  secured by a swivel hook that permits of turning the belt in any  direction. The belt is guided by small pulleys, H, so that the device  may be turned without running the belt from the pulley on the spindle.    Guides, G, are attached to the frame, A, for guiding the material being  operated upon by the planing knives. The frame, A, may be supported by  attachment to an arm, I, at the lower end of the screw-acted follower,  J, which slides in a rigid support, K. The arm, I, has a notched disk  which is engaged by a spring detent which holds the frame at any desired  inclination.    Among the kinds of work that may be done on this machine may be  mentioned shaping and edging, fluting and beading table legs, balusters,  etc.; dovetailing, boring, carving, paneling, shaping or friezing  mouldings, scroll or fret work, inlaying and engraving, blind stile  mortising and blind slat planing. By changing the inclination of the  spindle different varieties of mouldings may be produced by the same  cutter.    The machine may be used as an emery grinder, and it may also be used for  drilling and shaping metals.

The decrease had been steady since 1869, previous to  which there had been an increase. In his report for 1877, Mr. Draper  discusses the question whether the change continues, or is likely to  continue, in the same direction, and comes to the conclusion that the  rainfall of New York will, most probably, continue to decrease by  fluctuations for several years to come; also, that the variations are  very nearly the same in the two portions of the year, the division date  being July 1.           *       *       *       *       *                                     =NEW STEAM VALVE.=    The improved valve shown partly in section in the engraving is designed  for removing the water of condensation from steam pipes, so that dry  steam may be furnished.    [Illustration: SAUNDERS' STEAM VALVE.]    In the engraving, the globe valve, A, is of the usual form, except that  the casing below the valve seat is enlarged, forming a pocket, B, which  communicates through an aperture at the bottom with a small valve, C.    The steam, in passing through the valve, fills the pocket and there  deposits any water that may have condensed from the steam in its passage  through the steam pipe. The increased depth of the lower portion of the  valve prevents siphoning, which takes place in valves of the ordinary  form. The valve, C, is kept slightly open to discharge the water at the  moment it collects in the pocket; the water is thus prevented from  passing onward to the"]]]
