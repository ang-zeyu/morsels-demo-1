In a humid climate the  larger ravines through which the run-off flows soon descend below  the ground-water surface. Here springs discharge along the sides  of the little valleys and permanent streams begin. The water  supplied by the run-off here joins that part of the rainfall which  had soaked into the soil, and both now proceed together by way of  the stream to the sea.    RIVER FLOODS. Streams vary greatly in volume during the year. At  stages of flood they fill their immediate banks, or overrun them  and inundate any low lands adjacent to the channel; at stages of  low water they diminish to but a fraction of their volume when at  flood.    At times of flood, rivers are fed chiefly by the run-off; at times  of low water, largely or even wholly by springs.    How, then, will the water of streams differ at these times in  turbidity and in the relative amount of solids carried in  solution?    In parts of England streams have been known to continue flowing  after eighteen months of local drought, so great is the volume of  water which in humid climates is stored in the rocks above the  drainage level, and so slowly is it given off in springs.    In Illinois and the states adjacent, rivers remain low in winter  and a \"spring freshet\" follows the melting of the winter's snows.  A \"June rise\" is produced by the heavy rains of early summer. Low  water follows in July and August, and streams are again swollen to  a moderate degree under the rains of autumn.    THE DISCHARGE OF STREAMS. The per cent of rainfall discharged by  rivers varies with the amount of rainfall, the slope of the  drainage area, the texture of the rocks, and other factors. With  an annual rainfall of fifty inches in an open country, about fifty  per cent is discharged; while with a rainfall of twenty inches  only fifteen per cent is discharged, part of the remainder being  evaporated and part passing underground beyond the drainage area.  Thus the Ohio discharges thirty per cent of the rainfall of its  basin, while the Missouri carries away but fifteen per cent. A  number of the streams of the semi-arid lands of the West do not  discharge more than five per cent of the rainfall.    Other things being equal, which will afford the larger proportion  of run-off, a region underlain with granite rock or with coarse  sandstone? grass land or forest? steep slopes or level land? a  well-drained region or one abounding in marshes and ponds? frozen  or unfrozen ground? Will there be a larger proportion of run-off  after long rains or after a season of drought? after long and  gentle rains, or after the same amount of precipitation in a  violent rain? during the months of growing vegetation, from June  to August, or during the autumn months?    DESERT STREAMS. In arid regions the ground-water surface lies so  low that for the most part stream ways do not intersect it.  Streams therefore are not fed by springs, but instead lose volume  as their waters soak into the thirsty rocks over which they flow.  They contribute to the ground water of the region instead of being  increased by it. Being supplied chiefly by the run-off, they  wither at times of drought to a mere trickle of water, to a chain  of pools, or go wholly dry, while at long intervals rains fill  their dusty beds with sudden raging torrents. Desert rivers  therefore periodically shorten and lengthen their courses,  withering back at times of drought for scores of miles, or even  for a hundred miles from the point reached by their waters during  seasons of rain.    THE GEOLOGICAL WORK OF STREAMS. The work of streams is of three  kinds,--transportation, erosion, and deposition. Streams TRANSPORT  the waste of the land; they wear, or ERODE, their channels both on  bed and banks; and they DEPOSIT portions of their load from time  to time along their courses, finally laying it down in the sea.  Most of the work of streams is done at times of flood.    TRANSPORTATION    THE INVISIBLE LOAD OF STREAMS. Of the waste which a river  transports we may consider first the invisible load which it  carries in solution, supplied chiefly by springs but also in part  by the run-off and from the solution of the rocks of its bed. More  than half the dissolved solids in the water of the average river  consists of the carbonates of lime and magnesia; other substances  are gypsum, sodium sulphate (Glauber's salts), magnesium sulphate  (Epsom salts), sodium chloride (common salt), and even silica, the  least soluble of the common rock-making minerals. The amount of  this invisible load is surprisingly large. The Mississippi, for  example, transports each year 113,000,000 tons of dissolved rock  to the Gulf.    THE VISIBLE LOAD OF STREAMS. This consists of the silt which the  stream carries in suspension, and the sand and gravel and larger  stones which it pushes along its bed. Especially in times of flood  one may note the muddy water, its silt being kept from settling by  the rolling, eddying currents; and often by placing his ear close  to the bottom of a boat one may hear the clatter of pebbles as  they are hurried along. In mountain torrents the rumble of  bowlders as they clash together may be heard some distance away.  The amount of the load which a stream can transport depends on its  velocity. A current of two thirds of a mile per hour can move fine  sand, while one of four miles per hour sweeps along pebbles as  large as hen's eggs. The transporting power of a stream varies as  the sixth power of its velocity. If its velocity is multiplied by  two, its transporting power is multiplied by the sixth power of  two: it can now move stones sixty-four times as large as it could  before.    Stones weigh from two to three times as much as water, and in  water lose the weight of the volume of water which they displace.  What proportion, then, of their weight in air do stones lose when  submerged?    MEASUREMENT OF STREAM LOADS. To obtain the total amount of waste  transported by a river is an important but difficult matter. The  amount of water discharged must first be found by multiplying the  number of square feet in the average cross section of the stream  by its velocity per second, giving the discharge per second in  cubic feet. The amount of silt to a cubic foot of water is found  by filtering samples of the water taken from different parts of  the stream and at different times in the year, and drying and  weighing the residues. The average amount of silt to the cubic  foot of water, multiplied by the number of cubic feet of water  discharged per year, gives the total load carried in suspension  during that time. Adding to this the estimated amount of sand and  gravel rolled along the bed, which in many swift rivers greatly  exceeds the lighter material held in suspension, and adding also  the total amount of dissolved solids, we reach the exceedingly  important result of the total load of waste discharged by the  river. Dividing the volume of this load by the area of the river  basin gives another result of the greatest geological interest,--  the rate at which the region is being lowered by the combined  action of weathering and erosion, or the rate of denudation.    THE RATE OF DENUDATION OF RIVER BASINS. This rate varies widely.  The Mississippi basin may be taken as a representative land  surface because of the varieties of surface, altitude and slope,  climate, and underlying rocks which are included in its great  extent. Careful measurements show that the Mississippi basin is  now being lowered at a rate of one four-thousandth of a foot a  year, or one foot in four thousand years. Taking this as the  average rate of denudation for the land surfaces of the globe,  estimates have been made of the length of time required at this  rate to wash and wear the continents to the level of the sea. As  the average elevation of the lands of the globe is reckoned at  2411 feet, this result would occur in nine or ten million years,  if the present rate of denudation should remain unchanged. But  even if no movements of the earth's crust should lift or depress  the continents, the rate of wear and the removal of waste from  their surfaces will not remain the same. It must constantly  decrease as the lands are worn nearer to sea level and their  slopes become more gentle. The length of time required to wear  them away is therefore far in excess of that just stated.    The drainage area of the Potomac is 11,000 square miles. The silt  brought down in suspension in a year would cover a square mile to  the depth of four feet. At what rate is the Potomac basin being  lowered from this cause alone?    It is estimated that the Upper Ganges is lowering its basin at the  rate of one foot in 823 years, and the Po one foot in 720 years.  Why so much faster than the Potomac and the Mississippi?    HOW STREAMS GET THEIR LOADS. The load of streams is derived from a  number of sources, the larger part being supplied by the  weathering of valley slopes. We have noticed how the mantle of  waste creeps and washes to the stream ways. Watching the run-off  during a rain, as it hurries muddy with waste along the gutter or  washes down the hillside, we may see the beginning of the route by  which the larger part of their load is delivered to rivers.  Streams also secure some of their load by wearing it from their  beds and banks,--a process called erosion.    EROSION    Streams erode their beds chiefly by means of their bottom load,--  the stones of various sizes and the sand and even the fine mud  which they sweep along. With these tools they smooth, grind, and  rasp the rock of their beds, using them in much the fashion of  sandpaper or a file.    WEATHERING OF RIVER BEDS. The erosion of stream beds is greatly  helped by the work of the weather. Especially at low water more or  less of the bed is exposed to the action of frost and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/421"],[0,"Kidnapped (#10)"],[1,"watch  below were seated smoking, or lying down asleep. The day being calm and  the wind fair, the scuttle was open, and not only the good daylight, but  from time to time (as the ship rolled) a dusty beam of sunlight shone  in, and dazzled and delighted me. I had no sooner moved, moreover, than  one of the men brought me a drink of something healing which Mr. Riach  had prepared, and bade me lie still and I should soon be well again.  There were no bones broken, he explained: \"A clour* on the head was  naething. Man,\" said he, \"it was me that gave it ye!\"         * Blow.    Here I lay for the space of many days a close prisoner, and not only got  my health again, but came to know my companions. They were a rough lot  indeed, as sailors mostly are: being men rooted out of all the kindly  parts of life, and condemned to toss together on the rough seas, with  masters no less cruel. There were some among them that had sailed with  the pirates and seen things it would be a shame even to speak of; some  were men that had run from the king's ships, and went with a halter  round their necks, of which they made no secret; and all, as the saying  goes, were \"at a word and a blow\" with their best friends. Yet I had  not been many days shut up with them before I began to be ashamed of my  first judgment, when I had drawn away from them at the Ferry pier, as  though they had been unclean beasts. No class of man is altogether bad,  but each has its own faults and virtues; and these shipmates of mine  were no exception to the rule. Rough they were, sure enough; and bad, I  suppose; but they had many virtues. They were kind when it occurred to  them, simple even beyond the simplicity of a country lad like me, and  had some glimmerings of honesty.    There was one man, of maybe forty, that would sit on my berthside for  hours and tell me of his wife and child. He was a fisher that had lost  his boat, and thus been driven to the deep-sea voyaging. Well, it is  years ago now: but I have never forgotten him. His wife (who was \"young  by him,\" as he often told me) waited in vain to see her man return; he  would never again make the fire for her in the morning, nor yet keep  the bairn when she was sick. Indeed, many of these poor fellows (as the  event proved) were upon their last cruise; the deep seas and cannibal  fish received them; and it is a thankless business to speak ill of the  dead.    Among other good deeds that they did, they returned my money, which had  been shared among them; and though it was about a third short, I was  very glad to get it, and hoped great good from it in the land I was  going to. The ship was bound for the Carolinas; and you must not suppose  that I was going to that place merely as an exile. The trade was even  then much depressed; since that, and with the rebellion of the colonies  and the formation of the United States, it has, of course, come to  an end; but in those days of my youth, white men were still sold into  slavery on the plantations, and that was the destiny to which my wicked  uncle had condemned me.    The cabin-boy Ransome (from whom I had first heard of these atrocities)  came in at times from the round-house, where he berthed and served, now  nursing a bruised limb in silent agony, now raving against the cruelty  of Mr. Shuan. It made my heart bleed; but the men had a great respect  for the chief mate, who was, as they said, \"the only seaman of the whole  jing-bang, and none such a bad man when he was sober.\" Indeed, I found  there was a strange peculiarity about our two mates: that Mr. Riach was  sullen, unkind, and harsh when he was sober, and Mr. Shuan would not  hurt a fly except when he was drinking. I asked about the captain; but I  was told drink made no difference upon that man of iron.    I did my best in the small time allowed me to make some thing like a  man, or rather I should say something like a boy, of the poor creature,  Ransome. But his mind was scarce truly human. He could remember nothing  of the time before he came to sea; only that his father had made clocks,  and had a starling in the parlour, which could whistle \"The North  Countrie;\" all else had been blotted out in these years of hardship  and cruelties. He had a strange notion of the dry land, picked up from  sailor's stories: that it was a place where lads were put to some kind  of slavery called a trade, and where apprentices were continually lashed  and clapped into foul prisons. In a town, he thought every second person  a decoy, and every third house a place in which seamen would be drugged  and murdered. To be sure, I would tell him how kindly I had myself been  used upon that dry land he was so much afraid of, and how well fed and  carefully taught both by my friends and my parents: and if he had been  recently hurt, he would weep bitterly and swear to run away; but if  he was in his usual crackbrain humour, or (still more) if he had had a  glass of spirits in the roundhouse, he would deride the notion.    It was Mr. Riach (Heaven forgive him!) who gave the boy drink; and  it was, doubtless, kindly meant; but besides that it was ruin to his  health, it was the pitifullest thing in life to see this unhappy,  unfriended creature staggering, and dancing, and talking he knew not  what. Some of the men laughed, but not all; others would grow as black  as thunder (thinking, perhaps, of their own childhood or their own  children) and bid him stop that nonsense, and think what he was doing.  As for me, I felt ashamed to look at him, and the poor child still comes  about me in my dreams.    All this time, you should know, the Covenant was meeting continual  head-winds and tumbling up and down against head-seas, so that the  scuttle was almost constantly shut, and the forecastle lighted only by a  swinging lantern on a beam. There was constant labour for all hands; the  sails had to be made and shortened every hour; the strain told on the  men's temper; there was a growl of quarrelling all day long from berth  to berth; and as I was never allowed to set my foot on deck, you  can picture to yourselves how weary of my life I grew to be, and how  impatient for a change.    And a change I was to get, as you shall hear; but I must first tell of  a conversation I had with Mr. Riach, which put a little heart in me to  bear my troubles. Getting him in a favourable stage of drink (for indeed  he never looked near me when he was sober), I pledged him to secrecy,  and told him my whole story.    He declared it was like a ballad; that he would do his best to help  me; that I should have paper, pen, and ink, and write one line to Mr.  Campbell and another to Mr. Rankeillor; and that if I had told the  truth, ten to one he would be able (with their help) to pull me through  and set me in my rights.    \"And in the meantime,\" says he, \"keep your heart up. You're not the only  one, I'll tell you that. There's many a man hoeing tobacco over-seas  that should be mounting his horse at his own door at home; many and  many! And life is all a variorum, at the best. Look at me: I'm a laird's  son and more than half a doctor, and here I am, man-Jack to Hoseason!\"    I thought it would be civil to ask him for his story.    He whistled loud.    \"Never had one,\" said he. \"I like fun, that's all.\" And he skipped out  of the forecastle.          CHAPTER VIII    THE ROUND-HOUSE    One night, about eleven o'clock, a man of Mr. Riach's watch (which was  on deck) came below for his jacket; and instantly there began to go  a whisper about the forecastle that \"Shuan had done for him at last.\"  There was no need of a name; we all knew who was meant; but we had  scarce time to get the idea rightly in our heads, far less to speak of  it, when the scuttle was again flung open, and Captain Hoseason came  down the ladder. He looked sharply round the bunks in the tossing light  of the lantern; and then, walking straight up to me, he addressed me, to  my surprise, in tones of kindness.    \"My man,\" said he, \"we want ye to serve in the round-house. You and  Ransome are to change berths. Run away aft with ye.\"    Even as he spoke, two seamen appeared in the scuttle, carrying Ransome  in their arms; and the ship at that moment giving a great sheer into the  sea, and the lantern swinging, the light fell direct on the boy's face.  It was as white as wax, and had a look upon it like a dreadful smile.  The blood in me ran cold, and I drew in my breath as if I had been  struck.    \"Run away aft; run away aft with ye!\" cried Hoseason.    And at that I brushed by the sailors and the boy (who neither spoke nor  moved), and ran up the ladder on deck.    The brig was sheering swiftly and giddily through a long, cresting  swell. She was on the starboard tack, and on the left hand, under the  arched foot of the foresail, I could see the sunset still quite bright.  This, at such an hour of the night, surprised me greatly; but I was too  ignorant to draw the true conclusion--that we were going north-about  round Scotland, and were now on the high sea between the Orkney and  Shetland Islands, having avoided the dangerous currents of the Pentland  Firth. For my part, who had been so long shut in the dark and knew  nothing of head-winds, I thought we might be half-way or more across the  Atlantic. And indeed (beyond that I wondered a little at the lateness of  the sunset light) I gave no heed to it, and pushed on across the decks,  running between the seas, catching at ropes, and only saved from going  overboard by one of the hands on deck, who had been always kind to me.    The round-house, for which I was bound, and where I was now to sleep and  serve, stood some six feet above the decks, and considering the size of  the brig, was of good dimensions. Inside were a fixed table and bench,  and two berths, one for the captain and the other for the two mates,  turn and turn about. It was all fitted with lockers from top to bottom,  so as to stow away the officers'"]]]
