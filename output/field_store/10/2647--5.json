With some difficulty the boy managed to get his knife out of his pocket and  cut the cords that bound the riders to one another and to the wooden horse.  He heard the Scarecrow fall to the ground with a mushy sound, and then he  himself quickly dismounted and looked at his friend Jack.    The wooden body, with its gorgeous clothing,        111  still sat upright upon the horse's back; but the pumpkin head was gone, and  only the sharpened stick that served for a neck was visible. As for the  Scarecrow, the straw in his body had shaken down with the jolting and packed  itself into his legs and the lower part of his body--which appeared very  plump and round while his upper half seemed like an empty sack. Upon his  head the Scarecrow still wore the heavy crown, which had been sewed on to  prevent his losing it; but the head was now so damp and limp that the weight  of the gold and jewels sagged forward and crushed the painted face into a  mass of wrinkles that made him look exactly like a Japanese pug dog.    Tip would have laughed--had he not been so anxious about his man Jack. But  the Scarecrow, however damaged, was all there, while the pumpkin head that  was so necessary to Jack's existence was missing; so the boy seized a long  pole that fortunately lay near at hand and anxiously turned again toward the  river.    Far out upon the waters he sighted the golden hue of the pumpkin, which  gently bobbed up and down with the motion of the waves. At that moment it  was quite out of Tip's reach, but after a time it floated nearer and still  nearer until the boy        112               Full page line-art drawing.                   TIP RESCUES JACK'S PUMPKIN HEAD        113  was able to reach it with his pole and draw it to the shore. Then he brought  it to the top of the bank, carefully wiped the water from its pumpkin face  with his handkerchief, and ran with it to Jack and replaced the head upon  the man's neck.    \"Dear me!\" were Jack's first words. \"What a dreadful experience! I wonder if  water is liable to spoil pumpkins?\"    Tip did not think a reply was necessary, for he knew that the Scarecrow also  stood in need of his help. So he carefully removed the straw from the King's  body and legs, and spread it out in the sun to dry. The wet clothing he hung  over the body of the Saw-Horse.    \"If water spoils pumpkins,\" observed Jack, with a deep sigh, \"then my days  are numbered.\"    \"I've never noticed that water spoils pumpkins,\" returned Tip; \"unless the  water happens to be boiling. If your head isn't cracked, my friend, you must  be in fairly good condition.\"    \"Oh, my head isn't cracked in the least,\" declared Jack, more cheerfully.    \"Then don't worry,\" retorted the boy. \"Care once killed a cat.\"    \"Then,\" said Jack, seriously, \"I am very glad indeed that I am not a cat.\"        114    The sun was fast drying their clothing, and Tip stirred up his Majesty's  straw so that the warm rays might absorb the moisture and make it as crisp  and dry as ever. When this had been accomplished he stuffed the Scarecrow  into symmetrical shape and smoothed out his face so that he wore his usual  gay and charming expression.    \"Thank you very much,\" said the monarch, brightly, as he walked about and  found himself to be well balanced. \"There are several distinct advantages in  being a Scarecrow. For if one has friends near at hand to repair damages,  nothing very serious can happen to you.\"    \"I wonder if hot sunshine is liable to crack pumpkins,\" said Jack, with an  anxious ring in his voice.    \"Not at all--not at all!\" replied the Scarecrow, gaily.\" All you need  fear, my boy, is old age. When your golden youth has decayed we shall  quickly part company--but you needn't look forward to it; we'll discover  the fact ourselves, and notify you. But come! Let us resume our journey. I  am anxious to greet my friend the Tin Woodman.\"    So they remounted the Saw-Horse, Tip holding to the post, the Pumpkinhead  clinging to Tip, and the Scarecrow with both arms around the wooden form of  Jack.        115               Full page line-art drawing.                   TIP STUFFS THE SCARECROW WITH DRY STRAW.        116    \"Go slowly, for now there is no danger of pursuit,\" said Tip to his steed.    \"All right!\" responded the creature, in a voice rather gruff.    \"Aren't you a little hoarse?\" asked the Pumpkinhead politely.    The Saw-Horse gave an angry prance and rolled one knotty eye backward toward  Tip.    \"See here,\" he growled, \"can't you protect me from insult?\"    \"To be sure!\" answered Tip, soothingly. \"I am sure Jack meant no harm. And  it will not do for us to quarrel, you know; we must all remain good  friends.\"    \"I'll have nothing more to do with that Pumpkinhead,\" declared the Saw-  Horse, viciously. \"he loses his head too easily to suit me.\"    There seemed no fitting reply to this speech, so for a time they rode along  in silence.    After a while the Scarecrow remarked:    \"This reminds me of old times. It was upon this grassy knoll that I once  saved Dorothy from the Stinging Bees of the Wicked Witch of the West.\"    \"Do Stinging Bees injure pumpkins?\" asked Jack, glancing around fearfully.    \"They are all dead, so it doesn't matter,\" replied        117  the Scarecrow.\" And here is where Nick Chopper destroyed the Wicked Witch's  Grey Wolves.\"    \"Who was Nick Chopper?\" asked Tip.    \"That is the name of my friend the Tin Woodman, answered his Majesty. And  here is where the Winged Monkeys captured and bound us, and flew away with  little Dorothy,\" he continued, after they had traveled a little way farther.    \"Do Winged Monkeys ever eat pumpkins?\" asked Jack, with a shiver of fear.    \"I do not know; but you have little cause to, worry, for the Winged Monkeys  are now the slaves of Glinda the Good, who owns the Golden Cap that commands  their services,\" said the Scarecrow, reflectively.    Then the stuffed monarch became lost in thought recalling the days of past  adventures. And the Saw-Horse rocked and rolled over the flower-strewn  fields and carried its riders swiftly upon their way.                   * * * * * * * * *      Twilight fell, bye and bye, and then the dark shadows of night. So Tip  stopped the horse and they all proceeded to dismount.    \"I'm tired out,\" said the boy, yawning wearily; \"and the grass is soft and  cool. Let us lie down here and sleep until morning.\"        118    \"I can't sleep,\" said Jack.    \"I never do,\" said the Scarecrow.    \"I do not even know what sleep is,\" said the Saw-Horse.    \"Still, we must have consideration for this poor boy, who is made of flesh  and blood and bone, and gets tired,\" suggested the Scarecrow, in his usual  thoughtful manner. \"I remember it was the same way with little Dorothy. We  always had to sit through the night while she slept.\"    \"I'm sorry,\" said Tip, meekly, \"but I can't help it. And I'm dreadfully  hungry, too!\"    \"Here is a new danger!\" remarked Jack, gloomily. \"I hope you are not fond of  eating pumpkins.\"    \"Not unless they're stewed and made into pies,\" answered the boy, laughing.  \"So have no fears of me, friend Jack.\"    \"What a coward that Pumpkinhead is!\" said the Saw-Horse, scornfully.    \"You might be a coward yourself, if you knew you were liable to spoil!\"  retorted Jack, angrily.    \"There!--there!\" interrupted the Scarecrow; \"don't let us quarrel. We all  have our weaknesses, dear friends; so we must strive to be considerate of  one another. And since this poor boy is hungry and has nothing whatever to  eat, let us all remain        119  quiet and allow him to sleep; for it is said that in sleep a mortal may  forget even hunger.\"    \"Thank you!\" exclaimed Tip, gratefully. \"Your Majesty is fully as good as  you are wise--and that is saying a good deal!\"    He then stretched himself upon the grass and, using the stuffed form of the  Scarecrow for a pillow, was presently fast asleep.

These the boy ate greedily, finding them an ample breakfast, and  afterward the little party resumed its Journey.    After an hour's ride they reached the summit of a hill from whence they  espied the City of the Winkies and noted the tall domes of the Emperor's  palace rising from the clusters of more modest dwellings.    The Scarecrow became greatly animated at this sight, and exclaimed:    \"How delighted I shall be to see my old friend the Tin Woodman again! I hope  that he rules his people more successfully than I have ruled mine!\"    Is the Tin Woodman the Emperor of the Winkies?\" asked the horse.    \"Yes, indeed. They invited him to rule over        122  them soon after the Wicked Witch was destroyed; and as Nick Chopper has the  best heart in all the world I am sure he has proved an excellent and able  emperor.\"    \"I thought that 'Emperor' was the title of a person who rules an empire,\"  said Tip, \"and the Country of the Winkies is only a Kingdom.\"    \"Don't mention that to the Tin Woodman!\" exclaimed the Scarecrow, earnestly.  \"You would hurt his feelings terribly. He is a proud man, as he has every  reason to be, and it pleases him to be termed Emperor rather than King.\"    \"I'm sure it makes no difference to me,\" replied the boy.
