It is no wonder that to these people, who,  besides, on their return, all settled in the immediate  neighbourhood of Jerusalem, the thought never once occurred of  restoring the local cults.  It cost them no struggle to allow the  destroyed Bamoth to continue Iying in ruins; the principle had  become part of their very being, that the one God had also but one  place of worship, and thenceforward for all time coming this was  regarded as a thing of course.    I.II    Such was the actual historical course of the centralisation of  the cultus, and such the three stadia which can be distinguished.  The question now presents itself, whether it is possible to detect  a correspondence between the phases of the actual course of events  and those of the legislation relating to this subject.  All three  portions of the legislation contain ordinances on the subject of  sacrificial places and offerings.  It may be taken for granted  that in some way or other these have their roots in history, and  do not merely hang in the air, quite away from or above the solid  ground of actuality.    I.II.1. The main Jehovistic law, the so-called Book of the Covenant,  contains (Exodus xx.24-26) the following ordinance: \"An altar of  earth shalt thou make unto me, and thereon shalt thou sacrifice thy  burnt offerings and thy peace-offerings, thy sheep and thine  oxen; in place where I cause my name to be honoured will I come  unto and will bless thee.  Or if thou wilt make me an altar of  stones, thou shalt not build it of hewn stones, for if thou hast  lifted up thy tool upon it thou hast polluted it.  And thou shalt  not go up to mine altar by steps, that thy nakedness be not  discovered before it.\"  Unquestionably it is not the altar of the  tabernacle, which was made of wood and plated over with brass, nor  that of Solomon's temple, which on its eastern side had a flight of  steps, /1/    **************************************  1. The altar of the second temple had no steps, but a sloping ascent  to it, as also, according to the belief of the Jews, had that of the  tabernacle.   The reason, moreover, for which in Exodus xx.26 steps  are forbidden, disappears when the priests are provided with  breeches (Exodus xxviii.42).  ****************************************    and had a passage right round it at half its height, that is here  described as the only true one.  On the other hand, it is obvious  that a multiplicity of altars is not merely regarded as permissible,  but assumed as a matter of course.  For no stress at all is laid  upon having always the same sacrificial seat, whether fixed or to be  moved about from place to place; earth and unhewn stones /2/ of the field    ****************************************  2. The plural \"stones\" is perhaps worthy of note.  There were also  sacrificial places consisting of one great stone (1Samuel xiv.33,  vi.14, 15; 2Samuel xx.8; Judges vi.20, xiii.19, 20; 1Kings i.9); to the same  category also doubtless belongs originally the threshing-floor of  Araunah, 2Samuel xxiv.21; compare Ezra iii.3, [ (L MKWNTW ].  But  inasmuch as such single sacred stones easily came into a  mythological relation to the Deity, offence was taken at them, as  appears from Judges vi.22-24, where the rock altar, the stone under  the oak which was conceived of as the seat of the theophany, upon  which Gideon offers, and out of which the flame issues (vi.19-21),  is corrected into an altar upon the rock.  The macceboth are  distinguished from the altar in Exodus xxiv.4, yet elsewhere  clearly put on the same plane with it (Gen. xxxiii.20), and  everywhere more or less identified with the Deity (Gen. xxviii.).  ********************************************    can be found everywhere, and such an altar falls to pieces just as  readily as it is built.  A choice of two kinds of material is also  given, which surely implies that the lawgiver thought of more than  one altar; and not at the place, but at every place where He causes  His name to be honoured will Jehovah come to His worshippers and  bless them.  Thus the law now under consideration is in harmony  with the custom and usage of the first historical period, has its  root therein, and gives sanction to it.  Certainly the liberty to  sacrifice everywhere seems to be somewhat restricted by the added  clause, \"in every place where I cause my name to be honoured.\"  But this means nothing more than that the spots where intercourse  between earth and heaven took place were not willingly regarded  as arbitrarily chosen, but, on the contrary, were considered as  having been somehow or other selected by the Deity Himself for  His service.    In perfect correspondence with the Jehovistic law is the  Jehovistic narrative of the Pentateuch, as, in particular, the  story of the patriarchs in J and E very clearly shows.  At every  place where they take up their abode or make a passing stay, the  fathers of the nation, according to this authority, erect altars,  set up memorial stones, plant trees, dig wells.  This does not take  place at indifferent and casual localities, but at Shechem and  Bethel in Ephraim, at Hebron and Beersheba in Judah, at Mizpah,  Mahanaim, and Penuel in Gilead; nowhere but at famous and  immemorially holy places of worship.  It is on this that the  interest of such notifications depends; they are no mere  antiquarian facts, but full of the most living significance for the  present of the narrator.  The altar built by Abraham at Shechem is  the altar on which sacrifice still continues to be made, and bears  \"even unto this day\" the name which the patriarch gave it.  On the  spot where at Hebron he first entertained Jehovah, there down to  the present day the table has continued to be spread; even as  Isaac himself did, so do his sons still swear Amosos viii.14; Hos.  iv.15) by the sacred well of Beersheba, which he digged, and  sacrifice there upon the altar which he built, under the tamarisk  which he planted.  The stone which Jacob consecrated at Bethel the  generation of the living continues to anoint, paying the tithes  which of old he vowed to the house of God there.  This also is the  reason why the sacred localities are so well known to the  narrator, and are punctually and accurately recorded  notwithstanding the four hundred years of the Egyptian sojourn,  which otherwise would have made their identification a matter of  some little difficulty.  The altar which Abraham built at Bethel  stands upon the hill to the east of the town, between Bethel on the  west and Ai on the east; others are determined by means of a tree  or a well, as that of Shechem or Beersheba. /1/    *******************************  1. The correct explanation of this is found in Ewald, Gesch. d. V.  lsraels, i. 436 seq. (3d edit.). A. Bernstein (Ursprung der Sagen  von Abrabam, etc., Berlin, 1871) drags in politics in a repulsive way.  \"He does not indeed actually enter Shechem and Bethel-- these are places  hostile to Judah--but in a genuine spirit of Jewish demonstration  he builds altars in their vicinity and calls on the name of  Jehovah\" (p. 22).  Rather, he builds the altars precisely on the  places where, as can be shown, they afterwards stood, and that was  not inside the towns.  In Gen. xviii. also the oak of Mamre is  employed to fix not Abraham's residence, but the place of Jehovah's  appearing.  ****************************************************************    But of course it was not intended to throw dishonour upon the  cultus of the present when its institution was ascribed to the  fathers of the nation.  Rather, on the contrary, do these legends  glorify the origin of the sanctuaries to which they are attached,  and surround them with the nimbus of a venerable consecration.  All  the more as the altars, as a rule, are not built by the patriarchs  according to their own private judgment wheresoever they please;  on the contrary, a theophany calls attention to, or at least  afterwards confirms, the holiness of the place.  Jehovah appears at  Shechem to Abraham, who thereupon builds the altar \"to Jehovah who  had appeared unto him;\" he partakes of his hospitality under the  oak of Mamre, which is the origin of the sacrificial service there;  He shows him the place where he is to make an offering of his son,  and here the sanctuary continues to exist.  On the first night of  Isaac's sleeping on the sacred soil of Beersheba (xxvi.24) he  receives a visit from the Numen there residing, and in consequence  rears his altar.  Surprised by profane glances, Jehovah acts as a  destroyer, but Himself spontaneously points out to His favoured  ones the places where it is His pleasure to allow Himself to be  seen; and where men have seen Him and yet lived, there a sanctuary  marks the open way of access to Him.  The substance of the  revelation is in these cases comparatively indifferent: \"I am  God.\"  What is of importance is the theophany in and for itself,  its occurrence on that particular place.  It must not be regarded  as an isolated fact, but rather as the striking commencement of an  intercourse [ R)H PNY YHWH ] between God and man which is destined  to be continued at this spot, and also as the first and strongest  expression of the sanctity of the soil.  This way of looking at  the thing appears most clearly and with incomparable charm in the  story of the ladder which Jacob saw at Bethel.  \"He dreamed, and  behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to  heaven, and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on  it.  And he was afraid and said, How dreadful is this place!  This  is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of  heaven.\"  The ladder stands at the place not at this moment merely,  but continually, and, as it were, by nature.  Bethel--so Jacob  perceives from this--is a place where heaven and earth meet, where  the angels ascend and descend, to carry on the communication  between"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47333"],[0,"Christmas Stories from French and Spanish Writers (#10)"],[1,"ing,--    \"Now you are my husband. I have the power of marrying, and also of  receiving neophytes into our Great Law. My darling little prince,  may you be blessed through time everlasting!\" And the whole court  of figures entered, singing, \"Through time everlasting!\" to the  accompaniment of canaries and nightingales.      XII.    They all promenaded through the parlors in couples. Migajas gave his  arm to his royal consort.    \"What a pity,\" said she, \"that our hours of pleasure should be so  brief! Soon we shall have to return to our places.\"    His Serene Highness, Migajas, from the moment of his transformation,  had begun to experience the queerest sensations. The strangest of  these consisted in his having lost the sense of taste and the notion  of food. All he had eaten lay within him as though his stomach had  been a basket containing a thousand pasteboard viands which he did  not digest, which had no substance, weight, taste, or nourishment.  Moreover, he was no longer master of his movements, and was  compelled to keep time when he walked, which was a difficult thing  to do. He felt himself growing hard, as though he were being turned  to bone, wood, or clay. He thumped himself, and behold! his body  resounded like porcelain. His clothes, too, had grown hard, and were  in every respect precisely like his body.    When he found himself alone with his little wife and clasped her  to his bosom, he experienced no human or divine sensation of  pleasure,--nothing but the harsh shock of two hard, cold bodies. He  kissed her cheek; it was frozen. In vain did his hungry spirit call  upon nature. Nature in him was what it is in a piece of pottery. He  felt his heart throbbing like the machinery of a watch. His thoughts  alone survived; the rest was all unfeeling matter.    The princess seemed very happy. \"What is the matter, my love?\" said  she, observing Pacorrito's expression of distress.    \"I am weary, bored, bored to death, my dear,\" said the lover, gaining  assurance.    \"You will get accustomed to it. O happy hours! If this lasted much  longer, we could not endure it!\"    \"Does your Highness call this happiness?\" observed Migajas. \"What  coldness, what emptiness, what rigidity!\"    \"The after-taste of human things still lingers in your soul, and  you are still a slave to the views of your depraved human senses.  Pacorrito, I shall have to implore you to control these paroxysms, or  you will be the demoralization and destruction of every living doll.\"    \"Life! life! blood! heat!\" shouted Migajas, in despair, gesticulating  like a maniac. \"What is happening to me?\"    The princess clasped him to her bosom, and kissing him with her red,  waxen lips, exclaimed:    \"You are mine, forever, forever, through time everlasting!\"    Just then they heard a great commotion, and the sound of many voices  crying,--    \"It is time! it is time!\"    The clock struck twelve, and all had disappeared, princess, palace,  dolls, and emperors. Pacorrito was left alone.      XIII.    He was left alone in the most complete darkness. He tried to scream,  but he was voiceless. He made frantic attempts to move, but he could  not; he had turned to stone.    He waited in anguish. Day dawned at last; and Pacorrito had resumed  his old appearance, but strange to say, he was all of one color, and  apparently all of one substance,--his hands, his arms, his rags, his  hair, and even the newspapers which he held in his hand.    \"There is no doubt about it,\" said he; \"I have turned into a stone.\"    Before him he saw a great sheet of plate-glass, with some letters on  it, running backward. Around him was a multitude of statuettes and  fancy ornaments.    \"Horror! I must be in the show-window!\"    A clerk took him carefully in his hands, and having dusted him, put  him back in his place.    His Serene Highness looked down upon the pedestal on which he stood,  and saw a card with the figures $12.00 upon it.    \"Good heavens! I am worth a treasure! That, at least, partially  consoles one.\"    And the people stopped on the other side of the plate-glass to admire  the wonderful bit of clay statuary representing a ragamuffin selling  matches and newspapers. Everybody praised the artist, and laughed at  the droll expression and bungling figure of the great Migajas, while  he in the inmost recesses of his clay repeated in anguish,--    \"A puppet! a puppet! forever! through time everlasting!\"          A TRAGEDY.    From the Spanish of ANTONIO MARÉ.      It was a great city in the far North, a gloomy city with pointed  roofs that seemed to have been carved out of the fog. The birds that  hurried past it on their journey south said to themselves that it  looked like a forest of steeples. Under one of these pointed roofs  lived two young people whom the coldness of emigration had huddled  together in a closer intimacy. They were very unconscious of the  fog, and it never occurred to them that the city looked like a  forest of steeples; in fact, they never thought of the city at all,  and would scarcely have been surprised if they had heard it spoken  of as an orange grove,--for they were lovers. The little nest they  had built themselves under the pointed roof was bright with the  sunshine that came from them; and the few people who entered there  became intoxicated with a strange aroma of tenderness that surged to  their brains like the fumes of old wine, in sweet reminiscences or  disturbing suggestions.    It would not be perfectly correct to say that these young people  lived entirely alone; and had they not been so absorbed in each  other, living that life of double selfishness peculiar to lovers,  they could scarcely have helped feeling a soft blue gaze fixed upon  them, evening after evening, as they took their accustomed places  before the hearth.    On the mantel-piece which overhung the hearth was a small black  marble clock, a statuette of Psyche with butterfly wings made of  plaster, a little Italian shepherd of very primitively tinted clay,  and a bisque vase. Now, this vase was the gem of the drawing-room. On  its bosom was painted a running stream that broke into cataracts here  and there over glossy brown stones. Its pitch was amazingly abrupt.  It started at the brim of the vase and disappeared under it. On its  banks, far away in a misty perspective of pink and violet trees,  were a number of shadowy little shepherdesses, some carrying tender  lambs, others dancing the minuet, but all very blithe and merry. At  some distance from them, and at the very front, where the cataract  roared its loudest, stood a much larger shepherdess in clear relief,  thrusting herself boldly forward as though she meant to leap from  the parental vase, to which she was bound only by the tip of her  flowered skirt and the heel of her slippered foot. She held her crook  high in the air as if to balance herself in her flight. In her other  hand was a wreath of corn-flowers, with which she shaded a pair of  dreamy blue eyes that gazed in perpetual wonder at the world below.  Her sisters were simple little things, who were content to play with  a lambkin all day long in the sun, or dance the minuet under the  trees, but who had absolutely no ideas. Now, this particular little  shepherdess had not only ideas, she had thoughts, and what was more,  she was conscious of them. It was not to be wondered at that all  things fell in love with each other in this peculiar little room;  nor was it surprising that most things fell in love with the little  shepherdess. The wonder was that she, on the other hand, fell in  love with nothing. This superiority of thought was very isolating,  and her aloneness would have been unendurable but for the gratifying  nature of its cause. The clock was an unpleasant neighbor,--childless  and critical, which sometimes means the same thing. Its conversation  invariably took the form of a colloquy, stiff with rules, bristling  with maxims; besides, having gone through life measuring out time,  it had reached that stage of indiscriminate scepticism which is the  greatest possible damper on the open-mindedness of others.    There was the little clay shepherd, to be sure, who was very  well thought of by the community at large. The shepherdess liked  him,--certainly she liked him,--and she sometimes spoke her thoughts  to him, but she never could have loved him, had the drawing-room been  the Desert of Sahara and he its only other inhabitant. She was always  perfectly frank with him whenever he broached the subject.    \"In the first place, I do not believe that you are really in love,\"  she said to him kindly; \"you only think you are, because everybody  else seems to be. Reflect a little, and I am sure you will agree with  me,--for my part, I have given it a great deal of serious thought.  The air seems full of thrills for all of you lately, but you should  be very careful; a thrill is a dangerous prism through which to look  at life.\" And to herself she said, \"Poor little fellow! he thinks he  can build a bonfire out of two straws.\"    She could not associate love with his healthy plumpness. He was  even-tempered, and had an occasional idea, but no theories; he  wanted things without longing for them; his love was tender but not  invariably delicate. She felt the fault to be in his head rather than  in his heart; he always acquiesced, but seldom understood.    On the table in the centre of the room was a Chinese mandarin, who  was also in love with the little shepherdess, but she absolutely  abhorred him. To her mind he was coarse and repulsive, in spite of  his wealth. His jokes never amused her. Still he was a humorist,  and had a way of wobbling his head and poking out his tongue that  threw the whole drawing-room into convulsions of laughter. Poor  little shepherdess! Well, she did what we all do under similar  circumstances. She built herself a world of her own,--a little  intellectual laboratory into which she dragged bits of"]]]
