Then AEson came in sadly, and Cheiron asked him, 'Why camest you not  yourself to me, AEson the AEolid?'    And AEson said--    'I thought, Cheiron will pity the lad if he sees him come alone; and I  wished to try whether he was fearless, and dare venture like a hero's  son.  But now I entreat you by Father Zeus, let the boy be your guest  till better times, and train him among the sons of the heroes, that he  may avenge his father's house.'    Then Cheiron smiled, and drew the lad to him, and laid his hand upon his  golden locks, and said, 'Are you afraid of my horse's hoofs, fair boy, or  will you be my pupil from this day?'    'I would gladly have horse's hoofs like you, if I could sing such songs  as yours.'    And Cheiron laughed, and said, 'Sit here by me till sundown, when your  playfellows will come home, and you shall learn like them to be a king,  worthy to rule over gallant men.'    Then he turned to AEson, and said, 'Go back in peace, and bend before the  storm like a prudent man.  This boy shall not cross the Anauros again,  till he has become a glory to you and to the house of AEolus.'    And AEson wept over his son and went away; but the boy did not weep, so  full was his fancy of that strange cave, and the centaur, and his song,  and the playfellows whom he was to see.    Then Cheiron put the lyre into his hands, and taught him how to play it,  till the sun sank low behind the cliff, and a shout was heard outside.    And then in came the sons of the heroes, AEneas, and Heracles, and  Peleus, and many another mighty name.    And great Cheiron leapt up joyfully, and his hoofs made the cave resound,  as they shouted, 'Come out, Father Cheiron; come out and see our game.'  And one cried, 'I have killed two deer;' and another, 'I took a wild cat  among the crags;' and Heracles dragged a wild goat after him by its  horns, for he was as huge as a mountain crag; and Coeneus carried a  bear-cub under each arm, and laughed when they scratched and bit, for  neither tooth nor steel could wound him.    And Cheiron praised them all, each according to his deserts.                                [Picture: Cheiron]    Only one walked apart and silent, Asclepius, the too-wise child, with his  bosom full of herbs and flowers, and round his wrist a spotted snake; he  came with downcast eyes to Cheiron, and whispered how he had watched the  snake cast its old skin, and grow young again before his eyes, and how he  had gone down into a village in the vale, and cured a dying man with a  herb which he had seen a sick goat eat.    And Cheiron smiled, and said, 'To each Athene and Apollo give some gift,  and each is worthy in his place; but to this child they have given an  honour beyond all honours, to cure while others kill.'    Then the lads brought in wood, and split it, and lighted a blazing fire;  and others skinned the deer and quartered them, and set them to roast  before the fire; and while the venison was cooking they bathed in the  snow-torrent, and washed away the dust and sweat.    And then all ate till they could eat no more (for they had tasted nothing  since the dawn), and drank of the clear spring water, for wine is not fit  for growing lads.  And when the remnants were put away, they all lay down  upon the skins and leaves about the fire, and each took the lyre in turn,  and sang and played with all his heart.    And after a while they all went out to a plot of grass at the cave's  mouth, and there they boxed, and ran, and wrestled, and laughed till the  stones fell from the cliffs.    Then Cheiron took his lyre, and all the lads joined hands; and as be  played, they danced to his measure, in and out, and round and round.  There they danced hand in hand, till the night fell over land and sea,  while the black glen shone with their broad white limbs and the gleam of  their golden hair.    And the lad danced with them, delighted, and then slept a wholesome  sleep, upon fragrant leaves of bay, and myrtle, and marjoram, and flowers  of thyme; and rose at the dawn, and bathed in the torrent, and became a  schoolfellow to the heroes' sons, and forgot Iolcos, and his father, and  all his former life.  But he grew strong, and brave and cunning, upon the  pleasant downs of Pelion, in the keen hungry mountain air.  And he learnt  to wrestle, and to box, and to hunt, and to play upon the harp; and next  he learnt to ride, for old Cheiron used to mount him on his back; and he  learnt the virtues of all herbs and how to cure all wounds; and Cheiron  called him Jason the healer, and that is his name until this day.        PART II  HOW JASON LOST HIS SANDAL IN ANAUROS      And ten years came and went, and Jason was grown to be a mighty man.  Some of his fellows were gone, and some were growing up by his side.  Asclepius was gone into Peloponnese to work his wondrous cures on men;  and some say he used to raise the dead to life.  And Heracles was gone to  Thebes to fulfil those famous labours which have become a proverb among  men.  And Peleus had married a sea-nymph, and his wedding is famous to  this day.  And AEneas was gone home to Troy, and many a noble tale you  will read of him, and of all the other gallant heroes, the scholars of  Cheiron the just.  And it happened on a day that Jason stood on the  mountain, and looked north and south and east and west; and Cheiron stood  by him and watched him, for he knew that the time was come.    And Jason looked and saw the plains of Thessaly, where the Lapithai breed  their horses; and the lake of Boibe, and the stream which runs northward  to Peneus and Tempe; and he looked north, and saw the mountain wall which  guards the Magnesian shore; Olympus, the seat of the Immortals, and Ossa,  and Pelion, where he stood. Then he looked east and saw the bright blue  sea, which stretched away for ever toward the dawn.  Then he looked  south, and saw a pleasant land, with white-walled towns and farms,  nestling along the shore of a land-locked bay, while the smoke rose blue  among the trees; and he knew it for the bay of Pagasai, and the rich  lowlands of Haemonia, and Iolcos by the sea.    Then he sighed, and asked, 'Is it true what the heroes tell me--that I am  heir of that fair land?'    'And what good would it be to you, Jason, if you were heir of that fair  land?'    'I would take it and keep it.'    'A strong man has taken it and kept it long.  Are you stronger than  Pelias the terrible?'    'I can try my strength with his,' said Jason; but Cheiron sighed, and  said--    'You have many a danger to go through before you rule in Iolcos by the  sea: many a danger and many a woe; and strange troubles in strange lands,  such as man never saw before.'    'The happier I,' said Jason, 'to see what man never saw before.'    And Cheiron sighed again, and said, 'The eaglet must leave the nest when  it is fledged.  Will you go to Iolcos by the sea?  Then promise me two  things before you go.'    Jason promised, and Cheiron answered, 'Speak harshly to no soul whom you  may meet, and stand by the word which you shall speak.'    Jason wondered why Cheiron asked this of him; but he knew that the  Centaur was a prophet, and saw things long before they came.  So he  promised, and leapt down the mountain, to take his fortune like a man.    He went down through the arbutus thickets, and across the downs of thyme,  till he came to the vineyard walls, and the pomegranates and the olives  in the glen; and among the olives roared Anauros, all foaming with a  summer flood.    And on the bank of Anauros sat a woman, all wrinkled, gray, and old; her  head shook palsied on her breast, and her hands shook palsied on her  knees; and when she saw Jason, she spoke whining, 'Who will carry me  across the flood?'    Jason was bold and hasty, and was just going to leap into the flood: and  yet he thought twice before he leapt, so loud roared the torrent down,  all brown from the mountain rains, and silver-veined with melting snow;  while underneath he could hear the boulders rumbling like the tramp of  horsemen or the roll of wheels, as they ground along the narrow channel,  and shook the rocks on which he stood.    But the old woman whined all the more, 'I am weak and old, fair youth.  For Hera's sake, carry me over the torrent.'    And Jason was going to answer her scornfully, when Cheiron's words came  to his mind.    So he said, 'For Hera's sake, the Queen of the Immortals on Olympus, I  will carry you over the torrent, unless we both are drowned midway.'    Then the old dame leapt upon his back, as nimbly as a goat; and Jason  staggered in, wondering; and the first step was up to his knees.    The first step was up to his knees, and the second step was up to his  waist; and the stones rolled about his feet, and his feet slipped about  the stones; so he went on staggering, and panting, while the old woman  cried from off his back--    'Fool, you have wet my mantle!  Do you make game of poor old souls like  me?'    Jason had half a mind to drop her, and let her get through the torrent by  herself; but Cheiron's words were in his mind, and he said only,  'Patience, mother; the best horse may stumble some day.'    At last he staggered to the shore, and set her down upon the bank; and a  strong man he needed to have been, or that wild water he never would have  crossed.    He lay panting awhile upon the bank, and then leapt up to go upon his  journey; but he cast one look at the old woman, for he thought, 'She  should thank me once at least.'    And as he looked, she grew fairer than all women, and taller than all men  on earth; and her garments shone like the summer sea, and her jewels like  the stars of heaven; and over her forehead was a veil woven of the golden  clouds of sunset; and through the veil she looked down on him, with great  soft heifer's eyes; with great eyes, mild and awful, which filled all the  glen with light.

(Enter FRANCIS, HERMANN in disguise, DANIEL.)    FRANCIS. Here is the man. He says that he brings terrible news. Can  you bear the recital!    OLD M. I know but one thing terrible to hear. Come hither, friend, and  spare me not! Hand him a cup of wine!    HERMANN (in a feigned voice). Most gracious Sir? Let not a poor man be  visited with your displeasure, if against his will he lacerates your  heart. I am a stranger in these parts, but I know you well; you are the  father of Charles von Moor.    OLD M. How know you that?    HERMANN. I knew your son    AMELIA (starting up). He lives then? He lives! You know him? Where  is he? Where? (About to rush out.)    OLD M. What know you about my son?    HERMANN. He was a student at the university of Leipzic. From thence he  travelled about, I know not how far. He wandered all over Germany, and,  as he told me himself, barefoot and bareheaded, begging his bread from  door to door. After five months, the fatal war between Prussia and  Austria broke out afresh, and as he had no hopes left in this world, the  fame of Frederick's victorious banner drew him to Bohemia. Permit me,  said he to the great Schwerin, to die on the bed of heroes, for I have  no longer a father!--    OLD M. O! Amelia! Look not on me!    HERMANN. They gave him a pair of colors. With the Prussians he flew on  the wings of victory. We chanced to lie together, in the same tent. He  talked much of his old father, and of happy days that were past--and of  disappointed hopes--it brought the tears into our eyes.    OLD M. (buries his face in his pillow).--No more! Oh, no more!    HERMANN. A week after, the fierce battle of Prague was fought--I can  assure you your son behaved like a brave soldier. He performed  prodigies that day in sight of the whole army. Five regiments were  successively cut down by his side, and still he kept his ground. Fiery  shells fell right and left, and still your son kept his ground. A ball  shattered his right hand: he seized the colors with his left, and still  he kept his ground!    AMELIA (in transport). Hector, Hector! do you hear? He kept his  ground!    HERMANN. On the evening of the battle I found him on the same spot. He  had sunk down, amidst a shower of hissing balls: with his left hand he  was staunching the blood that flowed from a fearful wound; his right he  had buried in the earth. \"Comrade!\" cried he when he saw me, \"there has  been a report through the ranks that the general fell an hour ago--\"  \"He is fallen,\" I replied, \"and thou?\" \"Well, then,\" he cried,  withdrawing his left hand from the wound, \"let every brave soldier  follow his general!\" Soon after he breathed out his noble soul, to join  his heroic leader.    FRANCIS (feigning to rush wildly on HERMANN). May death seal thy  accursed lips! Art thou come here to give the death-blow to our father?  Father! Amelia! father!    HERMANN. It was the last wish of my expiring comrade. \"Take this  sword,\" faltered he, with his dying breath, \"deliver it to my aged  father; his son's blood is upon it--he is avenged--let him rejoice.  Tell him that his curse drove me into battle and into death; that I fell  in despair.\" His last sigh was \"Amelia.\"    AMELIA (like one aroused from lethargy). His last sigh--Amelia!    OLD M. (screaming horribly, and tearing his hair). My curse drove him  into death! He fell in despair!    FRANCIS (pacing up and down the room). Oh! what have you done, father?  My Charles! my brother!    HERMANN. Here is the sword; and here, too, is a picture which he drew  from his breast at the same time. It is the very image of this young  lady. \"This for my brother Francis,\" he said; I know not what he meant  by it.    FRANCIS (feigning astonishment). For me? Amelia's picture? For me--  Charles--Amelia? For me?    AMELIA (rushing violently upon HERMANN). Thou venal, bribed impostor!  (Lays hold of him.)    HERMANN. I am no impostor, noble lady. See yourself if it is not your  picture. It may be that you yourself gave it to him.    FRANCIS. By heaven, Amelia! your picture! It is, indeed.    AMELIA (returns him the picture) My picture, mine! Oh! heavens and  earth!    OLD M. (screaming and tearing his face.) Woe, woe! my curse drove him  into death! He fell in despair!    FRANCIS. And he thought of me in the last and parting hour--of me.  Angelic soul! When the black banner of death already waved over him he  thought of me!    OLD M. (stammering like an idiot.) My curse drove him into death. In  despair my son perished.    HERMANN. This is more than I can bear! Farewell, old gentleman!  (Aside to FRANCIS.) How could you have the heart to do this?                           [Exit in haste.]    AMELIA (rises and rushes after him). Stay! stay! What were his last  words?    HERMANN (calling back). His last sigh was \"Amelia.\"                           [Exit.]    AMELIA. His last sigh was Amelia! No, thou art no impostor. It is too  true--true--he is dead--dead! (staggering to and fro till she sinks  down)--dead--Charles is dead!    FRANCIS. What do I see? What is this line on the sword?--written with  blood--Amelia!    AMELIA. By him?    FRANCIS. Do I see clearly, or am I dreaming? Behold, in characters of  blood, \"Francis, forsake not my Amelia.\" And on the other side,  \"Amelia, all-powerful death has released thee from thy oath.\" Now do  you see--do you see? With hand stiffening in death he wrote it, with  his warm life's blood he wrote it--wrote it on the solemn brink of  eternity. His spirit lingered in his flight to unite Francis and  Amelia.    AMELIA. Gracious heaven! it is his own hand. He never loved me.                           [Rushes off]    FRANCIS (stamping the ground). Confusion! her stubborn heart foils all  my cunning!    OLD MOOR. Woe, woe! forsake me not, my daughter! Francis, Francis!  give me back my son!    FRANCIS. Who was it that cursed him? Who was it that drove his son  into battle, and death, and despair? Oh, he was an angel, a jewel of  heaven! A curse on his destroyers! A curse, a curse upon yourself!    OLD MOOR (strikes his breast and forehead with his clenched fist). He  was an angel, a jewel of heaven! A curse, a curse, perdition, a curse  on myself! I am the father who slew his noble son! He loved me even to  death! To expiate my vengeance he rushed into battle and into death!  Monster, monster that I am! (He rages against himself.)    FRANCIS. He is gone. What avail these tardy lamentations? (with a  satanic sneer.) It is easier to murder than to restore to life. You  will never bring him back from his grave.    OLD Moon. Never, never, never bring him back from the grave! Gone!  lost for ever! And you it was that beguiled my heart to curse him.--  you--you--Give me back my son!    FRANCIS. Rouse not my fury, lest I forsake you even in the hour of  death!    OLD MOOR. Monster! inhuman monster! Restore my son to me. (Starts  from the chair and attempts to catch FRANCIS by the throat, who flings  him back.)    FRANCIS. Feeble old dotard I would you dare? Die! despair!                              [Exit.]    OLD MOOR. May the thunder of a thousand curses light upon thee! thou  hast robbed me of my son. (Throwing himself about in his chair full of  despair). Alas! alas! to despair and yet not die. They fly, they  forsake me in death; my guardian angels fly from me; all the saints  withdraw from the hoary murderer. Oh, misery! will no one support this  head, no one release this struggling soul? No son, no daughter, no  friend, not one human being--will no one? Alone--forsaken. Woe, woe!  To despair, yet not to die!               Enter AMELIA, her eyes red with weeping.    OLD MOOR. Amelia! messenger of heaven! Art thou come to release my  soul?    AMELIA (in a gentle tone). You have lost a noble son.    OLD MOOR. Murdered him, you mean. With the weight of this impeachment  I shall present myself before the judgment-seat of God.    AMELIA. Not so, old man! Our heavenly Father has taken him to himself.  We should have been too"]]]
