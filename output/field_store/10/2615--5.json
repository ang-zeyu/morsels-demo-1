In spite of their feeling of dislike for him, they were forced to  acknowledge that he seemed well-bred, was a young man of apparently good  habits and that Oakdale people were rapidly taking him up. Grace  privately thought Marian entirely too young to receive the attentions of  a man so much older than herself, but Marian's father and mother  permitted it, therefore Grace felt that she had no right to judge or  object.    The longest journey seems brief when beguiled by gay companions, and the  time slipped by like magic. It was with genuine surprise that the little  party heard their station called. There was a great scurrying about for  their various belongings, and well laden with suit cases and traveling  bags the party hustled out of the train and were met on the platform by  the judge's chauffeur, who conducted them to two waiting automobiles.    Off they whirled and in an incredibly short time the two machines drew  up before the judge's stately home, where lights gleamed from every  window. The guests alighted with much laughter and noise, and in a  twinkling the massive front door opened and Judge Putnam appeared.    \"Welcome, welcome!\" he cried. \"Now I am sure to have a Merry Christmas.  I don't see how your fathers and mothers could spare you, and I owe them  a debt of gratitude. Come in, come in. Here, Mary, are your children  again.\"    The judge's sister came forward and greeted the young people warmly,  kissing each girl in turn and shaking hands with the boys. Mr. Hammond  and James Gardiner were duly presented to the judge and his sister, and  then the boys were shown to their rooms by one of the servants, while  Miss Putnam herself conducted the girls to theirs.    \"We usually dine between seven and seven-thirty, my dears,\" said Miss  Putnam, as they ascended. \"I will send my maid, Annette, to you. Will  you have separate rooms, or do you wish to do as you did last summer?\"    \"Oh, let two of us room together,\" said Grace eagerly. \"But still, that  isn't fair, for it will leave an odd one. You know we had Mabel with us  last summer.\"    \"Dear little Mabel,\" said Miss Putnam. \"I am sure you must miss her  greatly. Her finding of her mother was very wonderful. I received a  letter from her last week. She says she is very happy, but that she  misses her Oakdale friends, particularly Jessica.\"    \"She is coming east for commencement,\" said Jessica with a wistful  smile. \"No one knows how much I miss her.\"    \"Let us settle the question of rooms at once,\" interposed Grace, who  knew that whenever the conversation turned to Mabel, Jessica invariably  was attacked with the blues. \"Who is willing to room alone?\"    \"I am,\" replied Miriam Nesbit, \"only I stipulate that I be allowed to  pay nocturnal visits to the rest of you whenever I get too bored with my  own society.\"    \"Very well, then,\" replied Grace. \"How shall we arrange it?\"    \"You and Anne take one room, then,\" said Nora rather impatiently,  \"Jessica and I another and that leaves Marian and Eva together. Do hurry  up about it, for I want to get the soot off my face, and the cinders out  of my eyes.\"    The question of roommates being thus settled, the girls trooped into the  rooms assigned them and began to dress for dinner. The matter of gowns  had been discussed by the girls when the judge's invitation had first  arrived. As they were to remain for a week, they would need trunks, but  for the first dinner, in case the trunks did not arrive on time, it had  been agreed that they each carry one simple gown in their suit cases.    Grace and Anne had both chosen white, Jessica a dainty flowered  organdie, and Nora a pale pink dimity. Eva Allen also had selected  white. Marian Barber alone refused to give her friends any satisfaction  as to what she intended to wear. \"Wait and see,\" she had answered. \"I  want my gown to be a complete surprise to all of you.\"    \"How funny Marian acted about her gown,\" remarked Grace to Anne, as she  fastened the last button on the latter's waist. The maid sent by Miss  Putnam had offered her services, but the girls, wishing to be alone, had  not required them.    \"Yes,\" responded Anne. \"I don't understand her at all of late. She has  changed a great deal, and I believe it is due to the influence of that  horrid Henry Hammond. I simply can't like that man.\"    \"Nor I,\" said Grace. \"It requires an effort on my part to be civil to  him. I think, too, that the boys are not favorably impressed with him,  although they are too polite to say so.\"    \"I believe in first impressions,\" remarked Anne. \"I think that nine  times out of ten they are correct. I may be doing the man an injustice,  but I can't help it. Every time that I talk with him I feel that he is  playing a part, that underneath his polish he has a cruel, relentless  nature.\"    \"Are you girls ready!\" called Nora's voice just outside their door.    \"In a minute,\" answered Grace, and with a last glance at the mirror she  and Anne stepped into the hall, where Nora, Jessica and Eva Allen stood  waiting.    \"Where's Marian?\" asked Grace, noticing her absence.    \"Don't ask me,\" said Eva, in a tone bordering on disgust. \"She won't be  out for some time.\"    \"Shall we wait for her?\" inquired Anne.    \"No,\" replied Eva shortly. \"Let us go, and don't ask me anything about  her. When she does finally appear you'll understand.\"    \"This sounds very mysterious,\" said Miriam Nesbit, who in a white dotted  Swiss, with a sprig of holly in her black braids, looked particularly  handsome. \"Come on, girls, shall we go down?\"    The six girls descended to the drawing room, looking the very  incarnation of youth and charming girlhood, and the judge's eyes  brightened at sight of them.    \"A rosebud garden of girls,\" he cried gallantly, \"but I seem to miss  some one. Where is the seventh rosebud?\"    \"Marian will be here directly,\" said Grace, as they gathered about the  big fireplace until dinner should be announced.    But ten minutes went by, and Marian still lingered.    \"Dinner is served,\" announced the old butler.    The girls exchanged furtive glances, the judge looked rather  uncomfortable, while Mr. Henry Hammond frowned openly.    Then there was another ten minutes' wait, that the girls tried to cover  with conversation. Then--a rustle of silken skirts and a figure appeared  in the archway that caused those assembled to stare in sheer amazement.    Was this fashionably attired person plain every-day Marian Barber? Her  hair was drawn high upon her head, and topped with a huge cluster of  false puffs, which made her look several years older than she had  appeared in the afternoon, while her gown of blue satin was cut rather  too low for a young girl, and had mere excuses in the way of sleeves. To  cap the climax, however, it had a real train that persisted in getting  in her way every time she attempted to move.    For a full minute no one spoke. Grace had an almost irrepressible desire  to laugh aloud, as she caught the varied expressions on the faces of her  friends. Mr. Hammond alone appeared unmoved. Grace fancied that she even  detected a gleam of approval in his eyes as he glanced toward Marian.    \"Shall we dine!\" asked the judge, offering his arm to Grace, while Tom  Gray escorted Miss Putnam, the other young men following with their  friends.    The dinner passed off smoothly, although there was a curious constraint  fell upon the young people that nothing could dispel.    Marian's gown had indeed proved a surprise to her young friends, and  they could not shake off a certain sense of mortification at her lack of  good taste.    \"How could Marian Barber be so ridiculous, and why did her mother ever  allow her to dress herself like that?\" thought Grace as she glanced at  Marian, who was simpering at some remark that Mr. Henry Hammond was  making to her in a voice too low for the others to hear.    Then Grace suddenly remembered that Marian's mother had left Oakdale  three weeks before on a three months' visit to a sister in a distant  city.    \"That deceitful old Henry Hammond is at the bottom of this,\" Grace  decided. \"He has probably put those ideas of dressing up into Marian's  head. She needs some one to look after her. I'll ask mother if she can  stay with me until her mother returns, that is if I can persuade her to  come.\"    \"Come out of your brown study, Grace,\" called Hippy. \"I want you to  settle an argument that has arisen between Miss O'Malley and myself.  Never before have we had an argument. Timid, gentle creature that she  is, she has always deferred to my superior intellect, but now--\"    \"Yes,\" retorted Nora scornfully, \"now, he has been routed with  slaughter, and so he has to call upon other people to rescue him from  the fruits of his own folly.\"    \"I am not asking aid,\" averred Hippy with dignity. \"I plead for simple  justice.\"    \"Simple, indeed,\" interrupted David with a twinkle in his eye.    \"I see very plainly,\" announced Hippy, \"that I shall have to drop this  O'Malley affair and defend myself against later unkind attacks. But  first I shall eat my dessert, then I shall have greater strength to  renew the fray.\"    \"Then my services as a settler of arguments are not required,\" laughed  Grace.    \"Postponed, merely postponed,\" assured Hippy, and devoted himself  assiduously to his dessert, refusing to be beguiled into further  conversation.    Dinner over, the entire party repaired once more to the drawing room,  where the young people performed for the judge's especial benefit the  stunts for which they were already famous.    Much to Grace's annoyance, Henry Hammond attached himself to her, and  try as she might she could not entirely rid herself of his attentions  without absolute rudeness. Tom Gray looked a trifle surprised at this,  and Marian Barber seemed openly displeased. Grace felt thoroughly out of  patience, when toward the close of the evening, he approached her as she  stood looking at a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49507"],[0,"Siegfried & The Twilight of the Gods (#10)"],[1,", didst thou know      Who I am,  Thy scoffs I had been spared!

Thou whom I love so,      All too fair one,  Rouse my wrath not to-day;  It would ruin both thee and me.    SIEGFRIED        Still art thou dumb,      Stubborn old man?      Stand to one side, then;      That pathway, I know,  Leads to the slumbering maid;      For thither the wood-bird  Was guiding when he flew off.

WANDERER    Fear thou the rock's defender!      My might it is  Holds the maiden fettered by sleep.      He who would wake her,      He who would win her,  Impotent makes me for ever.        A burning sea      Encircles the maid,      Fires fiercely glowing      Surround the rock;      He who craves the bride  The flames must boldly defy.            [_He points with his spear towards the rocky          heights._        Look up above!      That light dost thou see?      The surging heat,      The splendour, grows;      Clouds of fire rolling,      Tongues of flame writhing,      Roaring and raging,      Come ravening down.      Thy head now      Is flooded with light;            [_A flickering glow, increasing in brightness,          appears on the summit of the rock._        The fire will seize thee,      Seize and devour thee.--  Back, back, there, foolhardy boy!

Lightning flashes from the spear up          towards the rocks, where the light, until now dim,          begins to flame brighter and brighter.

Siegfried,          who is soon lost to view, seems, from the sound          of his horn, to be ascending the mountain.

The arrangement of the scene is      exactly the same as at the end of \"The Valkyrie.\"      In the foreground, under a wide-spreading fir-tree,      lies Brünnhilde in full shining armour, her helmet      on her head, and her long shield covering her, in      deep sleep._        SIEGFRIED            [_Coming from the back, reaches the rocky edge of          the summit, and at first shows only the upper part          of his body.

The steel, how it gleams and glints!      Is it the glare      That dazzles me still?      Shining armour?      Shall it be mine?            [_He lifts up the shield and sees Brünnhilde's          form; her face, however, is for the most part          hidden by her helmet._    Ha! It covers a man!  The sight stirs thoughts sweet and strange!      The helm must lie      Hard on his head;      Lighter lay he      Were it unloosed.            [_He loosens the helmet carefully and removes it          from the head of the sleeper. Long curling hair          breaks forth. Tenderly._        Ah! how fair!            [_He stands lost in contemplation._        Clouds gleaming softly      Fringe with their fleeces  This lake of heaven bright;      Laughing, the glorious      Face of the sun  Shines through the billowy clouds!
