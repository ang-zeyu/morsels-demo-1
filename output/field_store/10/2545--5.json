It is next recommended that two handsful  of common salt should be added to the warm water, and the body steeped  therein for a minute or two. The particles of salt pass into the skin  so firmly that they cannot be removed even by the most vigorous  rubbing. In this way the functions of the skin are stimulated to a  considerable degree; the process of nutrition throughout the body  greatly promoted; and the liver roused to action. From this it is easy  to understand why hot sea-water baths are so beneficial.    There is another effect of the warm bath which deserves to be well  remembered, for it has an historical association. It is related of the  great Napoleon, that after a day's fighting, instead of indulging in a  night's rest, he would take a warm bath. It was so efficacious that he  was enabled to begin his exertions almost immediately. The explanation  of this lies in the fact that when the mascles are tired out and the  vigour of the body diminished, the hot bath rouses the circulation and  renews the worn-out tissues. In the same way, after a night's dancing,  twenty minutes or so in a warm bath, and a couple of hours' sleep, will  be almost as good as a whole night's rest. In addition to the  foregoing, however, it must not be forgotten that the warm bath, or to  speak more correctly the hot bath, is a true medicinal agent. It is  used in many cases of disease, especially those in which the skin is  inactive. A feverish cold is often nipped in the bud by a hot bath at  bedtime; a free perspiration usually follows, and thus relief is  obtained. In some forms of rheumatism and gout, too, the hot bath is of  signal benefit. There are many cases of a spasmodic nature, also, in  which it is of great value. At the same time it must be borne in mind  that the hot bath, when used to an excess, tends to induce a  debilitated condition.      THE HAIR.      The loss of hair is so frequent in Australia, at least amongst the male  population, that it requires a little consideration; and apart  altogether from this, the whole subject is one of extreme interest, so  that some reference to the actual structure of the hair and the  hair-follicles is called for. The roots of the hair are formed in the  hair-follicles, which may be described as little pear-shaped bags,  formed either in the true skin or in the cellular tissue beneath it. Each  hair-follicle, hair-sac, or hair-pit, as it is variously termed, bulges  out at its deeper part, contracting to a long narrow neck as it passes  to its skin. Near the surface of the latter the follicle widens out  again, and it is from this part that the hair emerges. As it has been  previously mentioned, a duct from one of the oil glands usually opens  into each follicle. At its very bottom, also, is the papillae or little  mound-like elevation. This protrudes into the follicle, and from it the  hair is formed.    The blood supply for the hair is very abundant. There is a complete  system of blood vessels encircling every one of the follicles, and  besides this each papilla has a special distribution of blood to  itself. That part of the hair lying within the hair-follicle is called  the root. The lower end of the root, which swells out into a knob,  named the bulb, is concave in shape underneath, so as to fit on top of  the projecting papilla. The shaft is the long stem of the hair, while  its extreme end is termed the point.    By the aid of the microscope it may be seen that the hair itself on the  outside is covered by a layer of scales--the cuticle--overlapping one  another like the tiles on the roof of a house. Beneath the cuticle is  the fibrous part, consisting of many cells closely packed  together. In many instances the fibrous part takes up the whole  interior, but in the centre of the coarser hair there is the medulla or  pith, composed of very minute cells. From this it follows that the hair  is not a narrow tube, as is commonly supposed. This mistake has arisen  from the fact that, when viewed transversely, the colour of the central  and outer part of the hair is different.    Having in this way become acquainted with the actual structure of the  hair and of the hair-follicles, it will be desirable to consider  somewhat briefly the management of the former. We have already seen  that the skin requires a good deal of attention in order to ensure the  perfection of bodily health. And although the hair does not fulfil such  an important function, yet, on the other hand, it must not be  neglected. Even on the score of appearance alone, it has much claim for  attention. Many people would be vastly improved in this way were they  only to visit their hairdresser more frequently. It is very unsightly,  to say the least of it, to see the hair straggling all over the back  and sides of the neck, and the beard (if a beard be worn) with a wild,  untidy look. Besides this, in our semi-tropical climate, a little more  care in this respect would be certainly conducive to coolness and  comfort.    But in addition to these considerations, there is another very cogent  reason why the hair should be more often attended to; and it is the  fact that if it be kept of an ordinary length, somewhat frequent  cutting promotes its growth. There is more than one reason given as an  explanation of this; indeed, there are at least three. In the first  place, the shorter the hair the less it is dragged on in its roots;  secondly, its roots are prevented from becoming blocked at the mouth of  the hair-follicles--and lastly, the weight of the hair is considerably  lessened. From this it will be obvious that it is not the actual  cutting of the hair in itself which is so beneficial in invigorating  its growth, but that, by reason of the cutting, certain results follow  which strengthen it greatly.    We have just seen that the accumulations of DEBRIS and other material  at the roots of the hair are prejudicial to its growth. It must not be  inferred from this, however, that incessant washing of the scalp, by  removing these collections, is a good thing. Now, it is advised by some  that the hair should be wetted daily at the same time the bath is  taken. But as a general rule this is a mistake; only those who have a  superabundance of natural oil can afford to carry out such a practice.  With the great majority of people it is absolutely detrimental to the  growth of the hair to wash it oftener than once a week. After washing  the head, the hair should be thoroughly dried. Many attacks of  neuralgia, especially in the fair sex, are due to the effect of getting  into a draught while the hair is still wet.    There are several points to be borne in mind in connection with the  growth and preservation of the hair. With many persons the scalp is  very tender and will not tolerate vigorous brushing. In such instances  the brush should always be a soft one; indeed, a hard brush cannot be  recommended under any circumstances. The teeth of the comb, also,  should never be so sharp as to irritate the scalp, nor should they be  set too closely together. A certain amount of brushing is necessary to  keep the scalp and hair in healthy action, but it must never be carried  to excess. Singeing the hair is greatly believed in by a number of  people, and in some cases it appears to be of benefit. Many believe  that singeing seals up the cut ends of the hair, which they affirm  bleed when cut. This has no foundation in fact, however, for, as it has  already been explained, the hair is not a tube. A hard, unyielding  covering for the head is not at all suitable; the lighter and  more ventilated the head-gear the better. But, the truth is, a sensible  and suitable head-covering for Australian use has yet to be devised.  Thinning of the hair, and even actual baldness, are not unfrequently  started by the hard rim of the hat employed. This mechanically  interferes with the supply of blood to the scalp, and thus it is that  the crown suffers most in this respect, since it is the more starved of  blood.    As I have previously shown, the hair often suffers from want of natural  oil. The investigations of Liebreich have shown that this is closely  allied to lanolin, which is the purified fat of sheep's wool. Moreover,  it has been found that this lanolin is the very best substitute for the  former. It is, however, too sticky to be used alone as a pomade.  Accordingly, Dr. Allan Jamieson, of Edinburgh, a very high authority on  diseases of the skin and hair, advises that it should be mixed with oil  of sesame in the following proportions:    Oil of sesame....1 drachm.    Lanolin..........2 ounces.    This may be conveniently perfumed with a few drops of oil of bergamot,  oil of orange blossom, or oil of rosemary. For the preservation of the  hair, therefore, it should be trimmed short; the scalp kept clean, but  not overwashed; and the hair, if naturally dry, lubricated by the  foregoing pomade. These must be supplemented, also, by taking care that  the head-covering is not too heating, that the rim of the hat is not  too hard, and that irritation of the scalp by hard brushes and fine  combs is strictly avoided.    If the thinning of the hair has progressed to a more advanced stage,  other measures will have to be adopted. The most useful application  which I know of to restore growth is the following. It is a formula  given by Messrs. Squire, the well-known chemists of London, and has had  an immense sale extending over many years.    Cantharidine (the best) 1 grain.    Acetic ether            6 drachms.    These are to be dissolved together; then add;    Rectified spirit        3 ounces.    Castor oil              1 ounce.    As with the pomade, this is best perfumed by the addition of about 20  or 30 drops of oil of bergamot, oil of lavender, oil of orange flower,  or oil"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42238"],[0,"The Articles of Faith (#10)"],[1,"of appreciating the finer arguments in nature. A wilful  sinner grows deaf to the voice of reason in holy things, and loses the  privilege of communing with his Creator, thus forfeiting the strongest  means of attaining a knowledge of God.      [62] See Note 5.      [63] Psalms xiv, 1.      [64] Proverbs i, 7; x, 21; xiv, 9.    =12. III. Revelation= gives to man his fullest knowledge of God. We  are not left wholly to the exercise of fallible reasoning powers, nor  to the testimony of others for a knowledge of the Divine Creator; we  may know Him for ourselves. Instances of God manifesting Himself to  His prophets in olden as in later times are so numerous as to render  impossible any detailed consideration here; moreover, we will have  opportunity of examining many examples in connection with our study of  the ninth of the Articles of Faith; for the present, therefore, brief  mention must suffice. We have already noted, as the foundation of many  traditions relating to the existence and personality of God, His  revelations of Himself to Adam and other ante-diluvian patriarchs;  then to Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses. An example but briefly  mentioned in the Jewish scriptures is that of Enoch, the father of  Methuselah; of him we read that he walked with God.[65] From the  \"Writings of Moses\" we learn that the Lord manifested Himself with  special favor to this chosen seer,[66] revealing unto him the course  of events until the time of Christ's appointed ministry in the flesh,  the plan of salvation through the sacrifice of the Only Begotten, and  the scenes that were to follow until the final judgment.      [65] Gen. v, 18-24; see also Jude 14.      [66] Pearl of Great Price, Moses vi, vii.    =13.= Of Moses we read that he received a manifestation from God, who  spoke to him from the midst of the burning bush in Mount Horeb,  saying: \"I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of  Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid  to look upon God.\"[67] Unto Moses and assembled Israel God appeared in  a cloud, with the terrifying accompaniment of thunders and lightnings,  on Sinai: \"And the Lord said unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the  children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from  heaven.\"[68] Of a later manifestation we are told:--\"Then went up  Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of  Israel: And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet  as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body  of heaven in his clearness.\"[69]      [67] Exodus iii, 6.      [68] Ex. xx, 18-22.      [69] Ex. xxiv, 9-10.    =14.= On through the time of Joshua and the judges to the kings and  the prophets, the Lord declared His presence and His power. Isaiah saw  the Lord enthroned in the midst of a glorious company, and cried out,  \"Woe is me, for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I  dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips, for mine eyes have  seen the King, the Lord of hosts.\"[70]      [70] Isa. vi, 1-5.    =15.= At a subsequent period, when Christ emerged from the waters of  baptism, the voice of the Father was heard declaring \"This is my  beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.\"[71] And on the occasion of  our Lord's transfiguration, the same voice repeated this solemn and  glorious acknowledgment.[72] While Stephen was suffering martyrdom at  the hands of his cruel and bigoted countrymen, the heavens were  opened, and he \"saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right  hand of God.\"[73]      [71] Matt. iii, 16-17; Mark i, 11.      [72] Matt. xvii, 1-5; Luke ix, 35.      [73] Acts vii, 54-60.    =16.= The Book of Mormon is replete with instances of communication  between God and His people, mostly through vision and by the  ministration of angels, but also through direct manifestation of the  Divine presence. Thus, we read of a colony of people leaving the Tower  of Babel and journeying to the western hemisphere, under the  leadership of one who is known in the record as the brother of Jared.  In preparing for the voyage across the great deep, the leader prayed  that the Lord would touch with His finger, and thereby make luminous,  certain stones, that the voyagers might have light in the ships. In  answer to this petition, the Lord stretched forth His hand and touched  the stones, revealing His finger, which the man was surprised to see  resembled the finger of a human being. Then the Lord, pleased with the  man's faith, made Himself visible to the brother of Jared, and  demonstrated to him that man was formed literally after the image of  the Creator.[74] To the Nephites who inhabited the western continent,  Christ revealed Himself after His resurrection and ascension. To these  sheep of the western fold, He testified of His commission received  from the Father; showed the wounds in His hands, feet, and side, and  ministered unto the believing multitudes in many ways.[75]      [74] Book of Mormon, Ether iii.      [75] Book of Mormon, III Nephi xi-xxviii.    =17.= In the present dispensation, God has revealed, and does still  reveal himself to His people. We have seen how by faith and sincerity  of purpose Joseph Smith, while yet a youth, won for himself a  manifestation of God's presence, being privileged to behold both the  Father and Christ the Son.[76] His testimony of the existence of God  is not dependent upon tradition or studied deduction; he declares to  the world that both the Father and Christ the Son live, for he has  beheld their persons, and has heard their voices. In addition to the  manifestation cited, Joseph Smith and his fellow servant, Sidney  Rigdon, state that on the 16th of February, 1832, they saw the Son of  God, and conversed with Him in heavenly vision. In describing this  manifestation they say: \"And while we meditated upon these things,  the Lord touched the eyes of our understandings, and they were  opened, and the glory of the Lord shone round about; and we beheld the  glory of the Son, on the right hand of the Father, and received of His  fulness; and saw the holy angels, and they who are sanctified before  His throne, worshiping God and the Lamb, who worship Him forever and  ever. And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of  Him, this is the testimony last of all which we give of Him, that He  lives, for we saw Him.\"[77]      [76] See page 9.      [77] Doc. and Cov. lxxvi, 11-24.    =18.= Again, on the 3rd of April, 1836, in the temple at Kirtland,  Ohio, the Lord manifested Himself to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery,  who say of the occasion:--\"We saw the Lord standing upon the  breastwork of the pulpit before us, and under His feet was a paved  work of pure gold in color like amber. His eyes were as a flame of  fire, the hair of His head was white like the pure snow, His  countenance shone above the brightness of the sun, and His voice was  as the sound of the rushing of great waters, even the voice of  Jehovah, saying,--I am the first and the last; I am He who liveth; I  am He who was slain; I am your advocate with the Father.\"[78]      [78] Doc. and Cov. cx, 1-4.    =19.= These are a few of the testimonies establishing the fact of  direct revelation from God unto men in ancient and modern times. The  privilege of communing with our Maker is restricted to none; true  faith, sincerity of purpose, and purity of soul will win, for every  one who seeks the boon, the blessing of God's favor and the light of  His presence.    =20. The Godhead: The Trinity.=--Three personages composing the great  presiding council of the universe have revealed themselves to man: (1)  God the Eternal Father; (2) His Son, Jesus Christ; and (3) the Holy  Ghost. That these three are separate individuals, physically distinct  from each other, is very plainly proved by the accepted records of  the divine dealings with man. On the occasion of the Savior's baptism  before cited, John recognized the sign of the Holy Ghost; he saw  before him in a tabernacle of flesh the Christ, upon whom he had  performed the holy ordinance; and he heard the voice of the  Father.[79] The three personages of the Godhead were present,  manifesting themselves each in a different way, and each distinct from  the others. The Savior promised His disciples that the Comforter,[80]  which is the Holy Ghost, should be sent unto them by His Father; here  again are the three members of the Godhead distinctly referred to.  Stephen, at the time of his martyrdom, was blessed with the power of  heavenly vision, and he saw Jesus standing on the right hand of  God.[81] Joseph Smith, while calling upon the Lord in fervent prayer  for wisdom to guide him in his religious professions, saw the Father  and the Son, standing in the midst of light which shamed the  brightness of the sun; one of these declared of the other, \"This is my  beloved Son, hear Him.\"[82] Each of the members of the Trinity is  called God,[83] together they constitute the Godhead.      [79] Matt. iii, 16-17; Mark i, 9-11; Luke iii, 21-22.      [80] John xiv, 26; xv, 26.      [81] Acts vii, 55-56.      [82] See page 9.      [83] I Cor. viii, 6; John i, 1-14; Matthew iv, 10; I Tim. iii, 16;    I John v, 7; Mosiah xv, 1, 2.    =21. Unity of the Godhead.=[84]--The Godhead is a type of unity in the  attributes, powers, and purposes of its members. Jesus, while on  earth[85] and in manifesting Himself to His Nephite servants,[86] has  repeatedly testified of the unity existing between Himself and the  Father, and between them both and the Holy Ghost. By some this has  been construed to mean that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost  are one in substance and in person, that the names in reality  represent the same individual under different aspects. A single  reference to prove the error of this view may suffice:--Immediately  before His betrayal, Christ prayed for His disciples, the Twelve, and  other converts, "]]]
