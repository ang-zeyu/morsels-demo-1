CHAPTER VIII    _The Tired Emphasis_      \"I AM so tired, so tired--I go to bed tired, I get up tired, and I  am tired all the time.\"    How many women--how many hundred women, how many thousand women--say  that to themselves and to others constantly.    It is perfectly true; they are tired all the time; they do go to bed  tired and get up tired and stay tired all day.    If, however, they could only know how very much they increase their  fatigue by their constant mental emphasis of it, and if at the same  time they could turn their wills in the direction of decreasing the  fatigue, instead of emphasizing it, a very large percentage of the  tired feeling could be done away with altogether.    Many women would gladly make more of an effort in the direction of  rest if they knew how, and I propose in this article to give a  prescription for the cure of the tired emphasis which, if followed,  will bring happy results.    When you go to bed at night, no matter how tired you feel, instead  of thinking how tired you are, think how good it is that you can go  to bed to get rested.    It will probably seem absurd to you at first. You may say to  yourself: \"How ridiculous, going to bed to get rested, when I have  only one short night to rest in, and one or two weeks in bed would  not rest me thoroughly.\"    The answer to that is that if you have only one night in which to  rest, you want to make the most of that night, and if you carry the  tired emphasis to bed with you you are really holding on to the  tired.    This is as practically true as if you stepped into a bog and then  sat in it and looked forlorn and said. \"What a terrible thing it is  that I should be in a bog like this; just think of having to sit in  a black, muddy bog all the time,\" and staying there you made no  effort whatever to get out of it, even though there was dry land  right in front of you.    Again you may answer: \"But in my tired bog there is no dry land in  front of me, none at all.\"    I say to that, there is much more dry land than you think--if you  will open your eyes--and to open your eyes you must make an effort.    No one knows, who has not tried, what a good strong effort will do  in the right direction, when we have been living and slipping back  in the wrong direction.    The results of such efforts seem at times wonderful to those who  have learned the right direction for the first time.    To get rid of the tired emphasis when we have been fixed in it, a  very strong effort is necessary at first, and gradually it gets  easier, and easier, until we have cast off the tired emphasis  entirely and have the habit of looking toward rest.    We must say to ourselves with decision in so many words, and must  think the meaning of the words and insist upon it: \"I am very tired.  Yes, of course, I am very tired, but I am going to bed to get  rested.\"    There are a hundred little individual ways that we can talk to  ourselves, and turn ourselves toward rest, at the end of the day  when the time comes to rest.    One way to begin, which is necessary to most of us, is to stop  resisting the tired. Every complaint of fatigue, whether it is  merely in our own minds, or is made to others, is full of  resistance, and resistance to any sort of fatigue emphasizes it  proportionately.    That is why it is good to say to ourselves: \"Yes, I am tired; I am  awfully tired. I am willing to be tired.\"    When we have used our wills to drop the nervous and muscular  contractions that the fatigue has caused, we can add with more  emphasis and more meaning, \"and I am going to bed to get rested.\"    Some one could say just here: \"That is all very well for an  ordinarily tired person, but it would never do me any good. I am too  tired even to try it.\"    The answer to that is, the more tired you are, the more you need to  try it, and the more interesting the experiment will be.    Also the very effort of your brain needed to cast off the tired  emphasis will be new to you, and thought in a new direction is  always restful in itself. Having learned to cast off the tired  emphasis when we go to bed at night, we can gradually learn to cast  it off before we go to meals, and at odd opportunities throughout  the day.    The more tired we are, the more we need to minimize our fatigue by  the intelligent use of our own wills.    Who cares for a game that is simple and easy? Who cares for a game  when you beat as a matter of course, and without any effort on your  part at all?    Whoever cares for games at all cares most for good, stiff ones,  where, when you have beaten, you can feel that you have really  accomplished something; and when you have not beaten, you have at  least learned points that will enable you to beat the next time, or  the next to the next time--or sometime. And everyone who really  loves a game wants to stick to it until he has conquered and is  proficient.    Why not wake up, and realize that same interest and courage in this  biggest game of all--this game of life?    We must play it!    Few of us are cowards enough to put ourselves out of it. Unless we  play it and obey the rules we do not really play at all.    Many of us do not know the rules, but it is our place to look about  and find them out.    Many more of us think that we can play the game better if we make up  rules of our own, and leave out whatever regular rules we do know,  that do not suit our convenience.    But that never works.    It only sometimes seems to work; and although plain common sense  shows us over and over that the game played according to our own  ideas amounts to nothing, it is strange to see how many work and  push to play the game in their own way instead of in the game's way.    It is strange to see how many shove blindly in this direction, and  that direction, to cut their way through a jungle, when there is the  path just by them, if they will take it.    Most of us do not know our own power because we would rather stay in  a ditch and complain.    Strength begets strength, and we can only find our greater power, by  using intelligently, and steadily, the power we have.          CHAPTER IX    _How to be Ill and get Well_      ILLNESS seems to be one of the hardest things to happen to a busy  woman. Especially hard is it when a woman must live from hand to  mouth, and so much illness means, almost literally, so much less  food.    Sometimes one is taken so suddenly and seriously ill that it is  impossible to think of whether one has food and shelter or not; one  must just be taken care of or die. It does not seem to matter which  at the time.    Then another must meet the difficulty. It is the little nagging  illnesses that make the trouble--just enough to keep a woman at home  a week or ten days or more, and deprive her of wages which she might  have been receiving, and which she very much needs.    These are the illnesses that are hard to bear.    Many a woman has suffered through an illness like this, which has  dragged out from day to day, and finally left her pale and weak, to  return to her work with much less strength than she needs for what  is before her.    After forcing herself to work day after day, her strength comes back  so slowly, that she appears to go through another illness, on her  feet, and \"in the harness,\" before she can really call herself well  again.    There are a few clear points which, if intelligently comprehended,  could teach one how to meet an illness, and if persistently acted  upon, would not only shorten it, but would lighten the convalescence  so that when the invalid returned to her work she would feel  stronger than before she was taken ill.    When one is taken with a petty illness, if it is met in an  intelligent way, the result can be a good rest, and one feels much  better, and has a more healthy appearance, than before the attack.    This effect has been so often experienced that with some people  there is a little bit of pleasantry passed on meeting a friend, in  the remark: \"Why, how do you do; how well you look--you must have  been ill!\"    If we remember when we are taken ill that nature always tends  towards health, we will study carefully to fulfill nature's  conditions in order to cure the disease.    We will rest quietly, until nature in her process toward health has  reached health. In that way our illness can be the means of giving  us a good rest, and, while we may feel the loss of the energy of  which the disease has robbed us, we also feel the good effects of  the rest which we have given to organs which were only tired.    These organs which have gained rest can, in their turn, help toward  renewing the strength of the organs which had been out of order, and  thus we get up from an illness looking so well, and feeling so well,  that we do not regret the loss of time, and feel ready to work, and  to gradually make up the loss of money.    Of course, the question is, how to fulfill the conditions so that  this happy result can be attained.    In the first place, _do not fret._    \"But how can I help fretting?\" someone will say, \"when I am losing  money every day, and do not know how many more days I may be laid  up?\"    The answer to that is: \"If you will think of the common sense of it,  you can easily see that the strain of fretting is interfering  radically with your getting well. For when you are using up strength  to fret, you are simply robbing yourself of the vitality which would  be used directly in the cure of your illness.\"    Not only that, but the strain of fretting increases the strain of  illness, and is not only preventing you from getting well, but it is  tending to keep you ill.    When we realize that fact, it seems as if it would be an easy matter  to stop fretting in order to get well.    It is as senseless to fret about an illness, no matter how much just  cause we may feel we have, as it would be to walk west when our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4341"],[0,"Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (#10)"],[1,"is now; it was seen then in  larger groups in Scotland and in the Unterwalden canton of Switzerland.  As to the great tribe of the dogs, it is eminently sociable, and  association for hunting purposes may be considered as eminently  characteristic of its numerous species. It is well known, in fact, that  wolves gather in packs for hunting, and Tschudi left an excellent  description of how they draw up in a half-circle, surround a cow which  is grazing on a mountain slope, and then, suddenly appearing with a loud  barking, make it roll in the abyss.(11) Audubon, in the thirties, also  saw the Labrador wolves hunting in packs, and one pack following a man  to his cabin, and killing the dogs. During severe winters the packs of  wolves grow so numerous as to become a danger for human settlements, as  was the case in France some five-and-forty years ago. In the Russian  Steppes they never attack the horses otherwise than in packs; and yet  they have to sustain bitter fights, during which the horses (according  to Kohl's testimony) sometimes assume offensive warfare, and in such  cases, if the wolves do not retreat promptly, they run the risk of being  surrounded by the horses and killed by their hoofs. The prairie-wolves  (Canis latrans) are known to associate in bands of from twenty to thirty  individuals when they chase a buffalo occasionally separated from its  herd.(12) Jackals, which are most courageous and may be considered as  one of the most intelligent representatives of the dog tribe, always  hunt in packs; thus united, they have no fear of the bigger  carnivores.(13) As to the wild dogs of Asia (the Kholzuns, or Dholes),  Williamson saw their large packs attacking all larger animals save  elephants and rhinoceroses, and overpowering bears and tigers. Hyenas  always live in societies and hunt in packs, and the hunting  organizations of the painted lycaons are highly praised by Cumming. Nay,  even foxes, which, as a rule, live isolated in our civilized countries,  have been seen combining for hunting purposes.(14) As to the polar fox,  it is--or rather was in Steller's time--one of the most sociable  animals; and when one reads Steller's description of the war that was  waged by Behring's unfortunate crew against these intelligent small  animals, one does not know what to wonder at most: the extraordinary  intelligence of the foxes and the mutual aid they displayed in digging  out food concealed under cairns, or stored upon a pillar (one fox would  climb on its top and throw the food to its comrades beneath), or the  cruelty of man, driven to despair by the numerous packs of foxes. Even  some bears live in societies where they are not disturbed by man. Thus  Steller saw the black bear of Kamtchatka in numerous packs, and the  polar bears are occasionally found in small groups. Even the  unintelligent insectivores do not always disdain association.    However, it is especially with the rodents, the ungulata, and the  ruminants that we find a highly developed practice of mutual aid. The  squirrels are individualist to a great extent. Each of them builds its  own comfortable nest, and accumulates its own provision. Their  inclinations are towards family life, and Brehm found that a family of  squirrels is never so happy as when the two broods of the same year can  join together with their parents in a remote corner of a forest. And yet  they maintain social relations. The inhabitants of the separate nests  remain in a close intercourse, and when the pine-cones become rare in  the forest they inhabit, they emigrate in bands. As to the black  squirrels of the Far West, they are eminently sociable. Apart from the  few hours given every day to foraging, they spend their lives in playing  in numerous parties. And when they multiply too rapidly in a region,  they assemble in bands, almost as numerous as those of locusts, and move  southwards, devastating the forests, the fields, and the gardens; while  foxes, polecats, falcons, and nocturnal birds of prey follow their thick  columns and live upon the individuals remaining behind. The  ground-squirrel--a closely-akin genus--is still more sociable. It is  given to hoarding, and stores up in its subterranean halls large amounts  of edible roots and nuts, usually plundered by man in the autumn.  According to some observers, it must know something of the joys of a  miser. And yet it remains sociable. It always lives in large villages,  and Audubon, who opened some dwellings of the hackee in the winter,  found several individuals in the same apartment; they must have stored  it with common efforts.    The large tribe, of the marmots, which includes the three large genuses  of Arctomys, Cynomys, and Spermophilus, is still more sociable and still  more intelligent. They also prefer having each one its own dwelling; but  they live in big villages. That terrible enemy of the crops of South  Russia--the souslik--of which some ten millions are exterminated every  year by man alone, lives in numberless colonies; and while the Russian  provincial assemblies gravely discuss the means of getting rid of this  enemy of society, it enjoys life in its thousands in the most joyful  way. Their play is so charming that no observer could refrain from  paying them a tribute of praise, and from mentioning the melodious  concerts arising from the sharp whistlings of the males and the  melancholic whistlings of the females, before--suddenly returning to his  citizen's duties--he begins inventing the most diabolic means for the  extermination of the little robbers. All kinds of rapacious birds and  beasts of prey having proved powerless, the last word of science in this  warfare is the inoculation of cholera! The villages of the prairie-dogs  in America are one of the loveliest sights. As far as the eye can  embrace the prairie, it sees heaps of earth, and on each of them a  prairie-dog stands, engaged in a lively conversation with its neighbours  by means of short barkings. As soon as the approach of man is signalled,  all plunge in a moment into their dwellings; all have disappeared as by  enchantment. But if the danger is over, the little creatures soon  reappear. Whole families come out of their galleries and indulge in  play. The young ones scratch one another, they worry one another, and  display their gracefulness while standing upright, and in the meantime  the old ones keep watch. They go visiting one another, and the beaten  footpaths which connect all their heaps testify to the frequency of the  visitations. In short, the best naturalists have written some of their  best pages in describing the associations of the prairie-dogs of  America, the marmots of the Old World, and the polar marmots of the  Alpine regions. And yet, I must make, as regards the marmots, the same  remark as I have made when speaking of the bees. They have maintained  their fighting instincts, and these instincts reappear in captivity. But  in their big associations, in the face of free Nature, the unsociable  instincts have no opportunity to develop, and the general result is  peace and harmony.    Even such harsh animals as the rats, which continually fight in our  cellars, are sufficiently intelligent not to quarrel when they plunder  our larders, but to aid one another in their plundering expeditions and  migrations, and even to feed their invalids. As to the beaver-rats or  musk-rats of Canada, they are extremely sociable. Audubon could not but  admire \"their peaceful communities, which require only being left in  peace to enjoy happiness.\" Like all sociable animals, they are lively  and playful, they easily combine with other species, and they have  attained a very high degree of intellectual development. In their  villages, always disposed on the shores of lakes and rivers, they take  into account the changing level of water; their domeshaped houses, which  are built of beaten clay interwoven with reeds, have separate corners  for organic refuse, and their halls are well carpeted at winter time;  they are warm, and, nevertheless, well ventilated. As to the beavers,  which are endowed, as known, with a most sympathetic character, their  astounding dams and villages, in which generations live and die without  knowing of any enemies but the otter and man, so wonderfully illustrate  what mutual aid can achieve for the security of the species, the  development of social habits, and the evolution of intelligence, that  they are familiar to all interested in animal life. Let me only remark  that with the beavers, the muskrats, and some other rodents, we already  find the feature which will also be distinctive of human  communities--that is, work in common.    I pass in silence the two large families which include the jerboa, the  chinchilla, the biscacha, and the tushkan, or underground hare of South  Russia, though all these small rodents might be taken as excellent  illustrations of the pleasures derived by animals from social life.(15)  Precisely, the pleasures; because it is extremely difficult to say what  brings animals together--the needs of mutual protection, or simply the  pleasure of feeling surrounded by their congeners. At any rate, our  common hares, which do not gather in societies for life in common, and  which are not even endowed with intense parental feelings, cannot live  without coming together for play. Dietrich de Winckell, who is  considered to be among the best acquainted with the habits of hares,  describes them as passionate players, becoming so intoxicated by their  play that a hare has been known to take an approaching fox for a  playmate.(16) As to the rabbit, it lives in societies, and its family  life is entirely built upon the image of the old patriarchal family; the  young ones being kept in absolute obedience to the father and even the  grandfather.(17) And here we have the example of two very closely-allied  species which cannot bear each other--not because they live upon"]]]
