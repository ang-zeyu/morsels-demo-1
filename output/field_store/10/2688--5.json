We knew as well as they that it was a long way, but our  people differed mightily about it; some said it was 150 leagues, others  not above 100. One of our men, that had a map of the world, showed us  by his scale that it was not above eighty leagues. Some said there were  islands all the way to touch at, some that there were no islands at all.  For my own part, I knew nothing of this matter one way or another, but  heard it all without concern, whether it was near or far off; however,  this we learned from an old man who was blind and led about by a boy,  that if we stayed till the end of August, we should be sure of the wind  to be fair and the sea smooth all the voyage.    This was some encouragement; but staying again was very unwelcome news  to us, because that then the sun would be returning again to the south,  which was what our men were very unwilling to. At last we called a  council of our whole body; their debates were too tedious to take notice  of, only to note, that when it came to Captain Bob (for so they called  me ever since I had taken state upon me before one of their great  princes), truly I was on no side; it was not one farthing matter to me,  I told them, whether we went or stayed; I had no home, and all the world  was alike to me; so I left it entirely to them to determine.    In a word, they saw plainly there was nothing to be done where we were  without shipping; that if our business indeed was only to eat and drink,  we could not find a better place in the world; but if our business was  to get away, and get home into our country, we could not find a worse.    I confess I liked the country wonderfully, and even then had strange  notions of coming again to live there; and I used to say to them very  often that if I had but a ship of twenty guns, and a sloop, and both  well manned, I would not desire a better place in the world to make  myself as rich as a king.    But to return to the consultations they were in about going. Upon the  whole, it was resolved to venture over for the main; and venture we did,  madly enough, indeed, for it was the wrong time of the year to undertake  such a voyage in that country; for, as the winds hang easterly all the  months from September to March, so they generally hang westerly all the  rest of the year, and blew right in our teeth; so that, as soon as  we had, with a kind of a land-breeze, stretched over about fifteen or  twenty leagues, and, as I may say, just enough to lose ourselves, we  found the wind set in a steady fresh gale or breeze from the sea, at  west, W.S.W., or S.W. by W., and never further from the west; so that,  in a word, we could make nothing of it.    On the other hand, the vessel, such as we had, would not lie close upon  a wind; if so, we might have stretched away N.N.W., and have met with a  great many islands in our way, as we found afterwards; but we could make  nothing of it, though we tried, and by the trying had almost undone us  all; for, stretching away to the north, as near the wind as we could, we  had forgotten the shape and position of the island of Madagascar itself;  how that we came off at the head of a promontory or point of land, that  lies about the middle of the island, and that stretches out west a great  way into the sea; and that now, being run a matter of forty leagues to  the north, the shore of the island fell off again above 200 miles to the  east, so that we were by this time in the wide ocean, between the island  and the main, and almost 100 leagues from both.    Indeed, as the winds blew fresh at west, as before, we had a smooth sea,  and we found it pretty good going before it, and so, taking our smallest  canoe in tow, we stood in for the shore with all the sail we could make.  This was a terrible adventure, for, if the least gust of wind had come,  we had been all lost, our canoes being deep and in no condition to make  way in a high sea.    This voyage, however, held us eleven days in all; and at length, having  spent most of our provisions, and every drop of water we had, we spied  land, to our great joy, though at the distance of ten or eleven leagues;  and as, under the land, the wind came off like a land-breeze, and blew  hard against us, we were two days more before we reached the shore,  having all that while excessive hot weather, and not a drop of water or  any other liquor, except some cordial waters, which one of our company  had a little of left in a case of bottles.    This gave us a taste of what we should have done if we had ventured  forward with a scant wind and uncertain weather, and gave us a surfeit  of our design for the main, at least until we might have some better  vessels under us; so we went on shore again, and pitched our camp  as before, in as convenient manner as we could, fortifying ourselves  against any surprise; but the natives here were exceeding courteous,  and much more civil than on the south part of the island; and though we  could not understand what they said, or they us, yet we found means to  make them understand that we were seafaring men and strangers, and that  we were in distress for want of provisions.    The first proof we had of their kindness was, that as soon as they saw  us come on shore and begin to make our habitation, one of their captains  or kings, for we knew not what to call them, came down with five or six  men and some women, and brought us five goats and two young fat  steers, and gave them to us for nothing; and when we went to offer them  anything, the captain or the king would not let any of them touch it,  or take anything of us. About two hours after came another king, or  captain, with forty or fifty men after him. We began to be afraid of  him, and laid hands upon our weapons; but he perceiving it, caused two  men to go before him, carrying two long poles in their hands, which they  held upright, as high as they could, which we presently perceived was  a signal of peace; and these two poles they set up afterwards, sticking  them up in the ground; and when the king and his men came to these  two poles, they struck all their lances up in the ground, and came on  unarmed, leaving their lances, as also their bows and arrows, behind  them.    This was to satisfy us that they were come as friends, and we were glad  to see it, for we had no mind to quarrel with them if we could help it.  The captain of this gang seeing some of our men making up their huts,  and that they did it but bunglingly, he beckoned to some of his men to  go and help us. Immediately fifteen or sixteen of them came and mingled  among us, and went to work for us; and indeed, they were better workmen  than we were, for they run up three or four huts for us in a moment, and  much handsomer done than ours.    After this they sent us milk, plantains, pumpkins, and abundance of  roots and greens that were very good, and then took their leave, and  would not take anything from us that we had. One of our men offered the  king or captain of these men a dram, which he drank and was mightily  pleased with it, and held out his hand for another, which we gave him;  and in a word, after this, he hardly failed coming to us two or three  times a week, always bringing us something or other; and one time sent  us seven head of black cattle, some of which we cured and dried as  before.    And here I cannot but remember one thing, which afterwards stood us in  great stead, viz., that the flesh of their goats, and their beef also,  but especially the former, when we had dried and cured it, looked red,  and ate hard and firm, as dried beef in Holland; they were so pleased  with it, and it was such a dainty to them, that at any time after they  would trade with us for it, not knowing, or so much as imagining what it  was; so that for ten or twelve pounds' weight of smoke-dried beef, they  would give us a whole bullock, or cow, or anything else we could desire.    Here we observed two things that were very material to us, even  essentially so; first, we found they had a great deal of earthenware  here, which they made use of many ways as we did; particularly they had  long, deep earthen pots, which they used to sink into the ground, to  keep the water which they drunk cool and pleasant; and the other was,  that they had larger canoes than their neighbours had.    By this we were prompted to inquire if they had no larger vessels than  those we saw there, or if any other of the inhabitants had not such.  They signified presently that they had no larger boats than that they  showed us; but that on the other side of the island they had larger  boats, and that with decks upon them, and large sails; and this made us  resolve to coast round the whole island to see them; so we prepared and  victualled our canoe for the voyage, and, in a word, went to sea for the  third time.    It cost us a month or six weeks' time to perform this voyage, in which  time we went on shore several times for water and provisions, and found  the natives always very free and courteous; but we were surprised one  morning early, being at the extremity of the northernmost part of the  island, when one of our men cried out, \"A sail! a sail!\" We presently  saw a vessel a great way out at sea; but after we had looked at it with  our perspective glasses, and endeavoured all we could to make out what  it was, we could not tell what to think of it; for it was neither ship,  ketch, galley, galliot, or like anything that we had ever seen before;  all that we could make of it was, that it went from us, standing out to  sea. In a word, we soon lost sight of it, for we were in no condition  to chase anything, and we never saw it again; but, by all that we could  perceive of it, from what we saw of such things"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6440"],[0,"Elsie Dinsmore (#10)"],[1," you are the daughter of my friend, Mr. Horace Dinsmore?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Your papa has been absent a long time, and I suppose you must have  quite forgotten him.\"    \"No, sir, not _forgotten_, for I never had seen him.\"    \"Indeed!\" said he, in a tone of surprise; \"then, since he is an entire  stranger to you, I suppose you cannot have much affection for him?\"    Elsie raised her large, dark eyes to his face, with an expression of  astonishment. \"Not love papa, my own dear papa, who has no child but  me? Oh! sir, how could you think that?\"    \"Ah! I see I was mistaken,\" said he, smiling; \"I thought you could  hardly care for him at all; but do you think that he loves you?\"    Elsie dropped her face into her hands, and burst into an agony of tears.    The young gentleman looked extremely vexed with himself.    \"My poor little girl, my poor, dear little girl,\" he said, stroking her  hair, \"forgive me. I am very, _very_ sorry for my thoughtless question.  Do be comforted, my poor child, for whether your papa loves you now or  not, I am quite sure he soon will.\"    Elsie now dried her tears, rose and closed the instrument. He assisted  her, and then asked if she would not take a little walk with him in the  garden. She complied, and, feeling really very sorry for the wound he  had so thoughtlessly inflicted, as well as interested in his little  companion, he exerted all his powers to entertain her--talked with her  about the plants and flowers, described those he had seen in foreign  lands, and related incidents of travel, usually choosing those in which  her father had borne a part, because he perceived that they were doubly  interesting to her.    Elsie, having been thrown very much upon her own resources for  amusement, and having a natural love for books, and constant access to  her grandfather's well-stocked library, had read many more, and with  much more thought, than most children of her age, so that Mr. Travilla  found her a not uninteresting companion, and was often surprised at the  intelligence shown by her questions and replies.    When the dinner-bell rang he led her in, and seated her by himself, and  never was any lady more carefully waited upon than little Elsie at this  meal. Two or three other gentlemen guests were present, giving their  attention to the older ladies of the company, and thus Mr. Travilla  seemed to feel quite at liberty to devote himself entirely to her,  attending to all her wants, talking with her, and making her talk.    Elsie now and then stole a glance at Mrs. Dinsmore, fearing her  displeasure; but to her great relief, the lady seemed too much occupied  to notice her. Once she looked timidly at her father, and her eyes met  his. He was looking at her with an expression half curious, half  amused. She was at a loss to understand the look, but, satisfied that  there was no displeasure in it, her heart grew light, and her cheeks  flushed with happiness.    \"Really, Dinsmore,\" said Mr. Travilla, as they stood together near one  of the windows of the drawing-room soon after dinner, \"your little girl  is remarkably intelligent, as well as remarkably pretty; and I have  discovered that she has quite a good deal of musical talent.\"    \"Indeed! I think it is quite a pity that she does not belong to you,  Travilla, instead of me, since you seem to appreciate her so much more  highly,\" replied the father, laughing.    \"I wish she did,\" said his friend. \"But, seriously, Dinsmore, you ought  to love that child, for she certainly loves you devotedly.\"    He looked surprised. \"How do you know?\" he asked.    \"It was evident enough from what I saw and heard this morning.  Dinsmore, she would value a caress from you more than the richest  jewel.\"    \"Doubtful,\" replied Horace, hastily quitting the room, for Elsie had  come out on to the portico in her riding suit, and Jim, her usual  attendant, was bringing up her horse.    \"Are you going to ride, Elsie?\" asked her father, coming up to her.    \"Yes, papa,\" she said, raising her eyes to his face.    He lifted her in his arms and placed her on the horse, saying to the  servant as he did so, \"Now, Jim, you must take good care of my little  girl.\"    Tears of happiness rose in Elsie's eyes as she turned her horse's head  and rode down the avenue. \"He called me _his_ little girl,\" she  murmured to herself, \"and bade Jim take good care of me. Oh! he _will_  love me soon, as good, kind Mr. Travilla said he would.\"    Her father was still standing on the portico, looking after her.    \"How well she sits her horse!\" remarked Travilla, who had stepped out  and stood close by his side.    \"Yes, I think she does,\" was the reply, in an absent tone. He was  thinking of a time, some eight or nine years before, when he had  assisted another Elsie to mount her horse, and had ridden for hours at  her side.    All the afternoon memories of the past came crowding thickly on his  mind, and an emotion of tenderness began to spring up in his heart  toward the child of her who had once been so dear to him; and as he saw  the little girl ride up to the house on her return, he again went out,  and lifting her from her horse, asked kindly, \"Had you a pleasant ride,  my dear?\"    \"Oh! yes, papa, very pleasant,\" she said, looking up at him with a face  beaming with delight. He stooped and kissed her, saying, \"I think I  shall ride with you one of these days; should you like it?\"    \"Oh! so very, _very_ much, papa,\" she answered, eagerly.    He smiled at her earnestness, and she hastened away to her room to  change her dress and tell Chloe of her happiness.    Alas! it was but a transient gleam of sunshine that darted across her  path, to be lost again almost instantly behind the gathering clouds.    More company came, so that the drawing-room was quite full in the  evening; and, though Elsie was there, her father seemed too much  occupied with the guests to give her even a glance. She sat alone and  unnoticed in a corner, her eyes following him wherever he moved, and  her ear strained to catch every tone of his voice; until Mr. Travilla,  disengaging himself from a group of ladies and gentlemen on the  opposite side of the room, came up to her, and taking her by the hand,  led her to a pleasant-looking elderly lady, who sat at a centre-table  examining some choice engravings which Mr. Dinsmore had brought with  him from Europe.    \"Mother,\" said Mr. Travilla, \"This is my little friend Elsie.\"    \"Ah!\" said she, giving the little girl a kiss, \"I am glad to see you,  my dear.\"    Mr. Travilla set a chair for her close to his mother and then sat down  on her other side, and taking up the engravings one after another, he  explained them to her in a most entertaining manner, generally having  some anecdote to tell in connection with each.    Elsie was so much amused and delighted with what he was saying that she  at last quite forgot her father, and did not notice where he was.    Suddenly Mr. Travilla laid down the engraving he had in his hand,  saying: \"Come, Miss Elsie, I want my mother to hear you play and sing;  will you not do me the favor to repeat that song I admired so much this  morning?\"    \"Oh! Mr. Travilla!\" exclaimed the little girl, blushing and trembling,  \"I could not play or sing before so many people. Please excuse me.\"    \"Elsie,\" said her father's voice just at her side, \"go _immediately,_  and do as the gentleman requests.\"    His tone was very stern, and as she lifted her eyes to his face, she  saw that his look was still more so; and tremblingly and tearfully she  rose to obey.    \"Stay,\" said Mr. Travilla kindly, pitying her distress, \"I withdraw my  request.\"    \"But I do _not_ withdraw my command,\" said her father in the same stern  tone; \"go at once, Elsie, and do as I bid you.\"    She obeyed instantly, struggling hard to overcome her emotion.    Mr. Travilla, scolding himself inwardly all the time for having brought  her into such trouble, selected her music, and placing it before her as  she took her seat at the instrument, whispered encouragingly, \"Now,  Miss Elsie, only have confidence in yourself; that is all that is  necessary to your success.\"    But Elsie was not only embarrassed, but her heart was well-nigh broken  by her father's sternness, and the tears _would_ fill her eyes so that  she could see neither notes nor words. She attempted to play the  prelude, but blundered sadly, her embarrassment increasing every moment.    \"Never mind,\" said Mr. Travilla, \"never mind the prelude, but just  begin the song.\"    She made the attempt, but fairly broke down, and burst into tears  before she had got through the first verse. Her father had come up  behind her, and was standing there, looking much mortified.    \"Elsie,\" he said, leaning down and speaking in a low, stern tone, close  to her ear, \"I am ashamed of you; go to your room and to your bed  immediately.\"    With a heart almost bursting with grief and mortification she obeyed  him, and her pillow was wet with many bitter tears ere the weary eyes  closed in slumber.    When she came down the next morning she learned to her great grief that  Mr. Travilla and his mother had returned to their own home; she was  very sorry she had not been permitted to say good-bye to her friend,  and for several days she felt very sad and lonely, for all her father's  coldness of manner had returned, and he scarcely ever spoke to her;  while the younger members of the family ridiculed her for her failure  in attempting to play for company; and Miss Day, who seemed unusually  cross and exacting, often taunted her with it also.    These were sad, dark days for the little girl; she tried most earnestly  to attend to all her duties, but so depressed were her spirits, so  troubled was her mind, that she failed repeatedly in her lessons, and  so was in continual disgrace with Miss Day, who threatened more than  once to tell her papa.    It was a threat which Elsie dreaded extremely to have put in execution, "]]]
