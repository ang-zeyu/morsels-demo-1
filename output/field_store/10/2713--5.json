The fast man's first ball was  outside the off-stump and a half-volley, and Norris, whatever the state  of his nerves at the time, never forgot his forward drive. Before the  bowler had recovered his balance the ball was half-way to the ropes.  The umpire waved a large hand towards the Pavilion. The bowler looked  annoyed. And the School inside the form-rooms asked itself feverishly  what had happened, and which side it was that was applauding.    Having bowled his first ball too far up, the M.C.C. man, on the  principle of anything for a change, now put in a very short one.  Norris, a new man after that drive, steered it through the slips, and  again the umpire waved his hand.    The rest of the over was more quiet. The last ball went for four byes,  and then it was Baker's turn to face the slow man. Baker was a steady,  plodding bat. He played five balls gently to mid-on, and glanced the  sixth for a single to leg. With the fast bowler, who had not yet got  his length, he was more vigorous, and succeeded in cutting him twice  for two.    With thirty up for no wickets the School began to feel more  comfortable. But at forty-three Baker was shattered by the man of pace,  and retired with twenty to his credit. Gethryn came in next, but it was  not to be his day out with the bat.    The fast bowler, who was now bowling excellently, sent down one rather  wide of the off-stump. The Bishop made most of his runs from off balls,  and he had a go at this one. It was rising when he hit it, and it went  off his bat like a flash. In a School match it would have been a  boundary. But today there was unusual talent in the slips. The man from  Middlesex darted forward and sideways. He took the ball one-handed two  inches from the ground, and received the applause which followed the  effort with a rather bored look, as if he were saying, 'My good sirs,  _why_ make a fuss over these trifles!' The Bishop walked slowly  back to the Pavilion, feeling that his luck was out, and Pringle came  in.    A boy of Pringle's character is exactly the right person to go in in an  emergency like the present one. Two wickets had fallen in two balls,  and the fast bowler was swelling visibly with determination to do the  hat-trick. But Pringle never went in oppressed by the fear of getting  out. He had a serene and boundless confidence in himself.    The fast man tried a yorker. Pringle came down hard on it, and forced  the ball past the bowler for a single. Then he and Norris settled down  to a lengthy stand.    'I do like seeing Pringle bat,' said Gosling. 'He always gives you the  idea that he's doing you a personal favour by knocking your bowling  about. Oh, well hit!'    Pringle had cut a full-pitch from the slow bowler to the ropes.  Marriott, who had been silent and apparently in pain for some minutes,  now gave out the following homemade effort:        A dashing young sportsman named Pringle,        On breaking his duck (with a single),          Observed with a smile,          'Just notice my style,          How science with vigour I mingle.'    'Little thing of my own,' he added, quoting England's greatest  librettist. 'I call it \"Heart Foam\". I shall not publish it. Oh, run it  out!'    Both Pringle and Norris were evidently in form. Norris was now not far  from his fifty, and Pringle looked as if he might make anything. The  century went up, and a run later Norris off-drove the slow bowler's  successor for three, reaching his fifty by the stroke.    'Must be fairly warm work fielding today,' said Reece.    'By Jove!' said Gethryn, 'I forgot. I left my white hat in the House.  Any of you chaps like to fetch it?'    There were no offers. Gethryn got up.    'Marriott, you slacker, come over to the House.'    'My good sir, I'm in next. Why don't you wait till the fellows come out  of school and send a kid for it?'    'He probably wouldn't know where to find it. I don't know where it is  myself. No, I shall go, but there's no need to fag about it yet. Hullo!  Norris is out.'    Norris had stopped a straight one with his leg. He had made fifty-one  in his best manner, and the School, leaving the form-rooms at the exact  moment when the fatal ball was being bowled, were just in time to  applaud him and realize what they had missed.    Gethryn's desire for his hat was not so pressing as to make him deprive  himself of the pleasure of seeing Marriott at the wickets. Marriott  ought to do something special today. Unfortunately, after he had played  out one over and hit two fours off it, the luncheon interval began.    It was, therefore, not for half an hour that the Bishop went at last in  search of the missing headgear. As luck would have it, the hat was on  the table, so that whatever chance he might have had of overlooking the  note which his uncle had left for him on the empty cash-box  disappeared. The two things caught his eye simultaneously. He opened  the note and read it. It is not necessary to transcribe the note in  detail. It was no masterpiece of literary skill. But it had this merit,  that it was not vague. Reading it, one grasped its meaning  immediately.    The Bishop's first feeling was that the bottom had dropped out of  everything suddenly. Surprise was not the word. It was the arrival of  the absolutely unexpected.    Then he began to consider the position.    Farnie must be brought back. That was plain. And he must be brought  back at once, before anyone could get to hear of what had happened.  Gethryn had the very strongest objections to his uncle, considered  purely as a human being; but the fact remained that he was his uncle,  and the Bishop had equally strong objections to any member of his  family being mixed up in a business of this description.    Having settled that point, he went on to the next. How was he to be  brought back? He could not have gone far, for he could not have been  gone much more than half an hour. Again, from his knowledge of his  uncle's character, he deduced that he had in all probability not gone  to the nearest station, Horton. At Horton one had to wait hours at a  time for a train. Farnie must have made his way--on his  bicycle--straight for the junction, Anfield, fifteen miles off by a  good road. A train left Anfield for London at three-thirty. It was now  a little past two. On a bicycle he could do it easily, and get back  with his prize by about five, if he rode hard. In that case all would  be well. Only three of the School wickets had fallen, and the pitch was  playing as true as concrete. Besides, there was Pringle still in at one  end, well set, and surely Marriott and Jennings and the rest of them  would manage to stay in till five. They couldn't help it. All they had  to do was to play forward to everything, and they must stop in. He  himself had got out, it was true, but that was simply a regrettable  accident. Not one man in a hundred would have caught that catch. No,  with luck he ought easily to be able to do the distance and get back in  time to go out with the rest of the team to field.    He ran downstairs and out of the House. On his way to the bicycle-shed  he stopped, and looked towards the field, part of which could be seen  from where he stood. The match had begun again. The fast bowler was  just commencing his run. He saw him tear up to the crease and deliver  the ball. What happened then he could not see, owing to the trees which  stood between him and the School grounds. But he heard the crack of  ball meeting bat, and a great howl of applause went up from the  invisible audience. A boundary, apparently. Yes, there was the umpire  signalling it. Evidently a long stand was going to be made. He would  have oceans of time for his ride. Norris wouldn't dream of declaring  the innings closed before five o'clock at the earliest, and no bowler  could take seven wickets in the time on such a pitch. He hauled his  bicycle from the shed, and rode off at racing speed in the direction of  Anfield.          [8]    THE M.C.C. MATCH      But out in the field things were going badly with Beckford. The aspect  of a game often changes considerably after lunch. For a while it looked  as if Marriott and Pringle were in for their respective centuries. But  Marriott was never a safe batsman.    A hundred and fifty went up on the board off a square leg hit for two,  which completed Pringle's half-century, and then Marriott faced the  slow bowler, who had been put on again after lunch. The first ball was  a miss-hit. It went behind point for a couple. The next he got fairly  hold of and drove to the boundary. The third was a very simple-looking  ball. Its sole merit appeared to be the fact that it was straight. Also  it was a trifle shorter than it looked. Marriott jumped out, and got  too much under it. Up it soared, straight over the bowler's head. A  trifle more weight behind the hit, and it would have cleared the ropes.  As it was, the man in the deep-field never looked like missing it. The  batsmen had time to cross over before the ball arrived, but they did it  without enthusiasm. The run was not likely to count. Nor did it.  Deep-field caught it like a bird. Marriott had made twenty-two.    And now occurred one of those rots which so often happen without any  ostensible cause in the best regulated school elevens. Pringle played  the three remaining balls of the over without mishap, but when it was  the fast man's turn to bowl to Bruce, Marriott's successor, things  began to happen. Bruce, temporarily insane, perhaps through  nervousness, played back at a half-volley, and was clean bowled. Hill  came in, and was caught two balls later at the wicket. And the last  ball of the over sent Jennings's off-stump out of the ground, after  that batsman had scored two.    'I can always bowl like blazes after lunch,' said the fast man to  Pringle. 'It's the lobster salad that does it, I think.' Four for a  hundred and fifty-seven had changed to seven for a hundred"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6986"],[0,"Hygienic Physiology : with Special Reference to the Use of Alcoholic Drinks and (#10)"],[1,"ess.--MARSHALL.] In the varying  tint of this coloring matter, lies the difference of hue between the  blonde and the brunette, the European and the African. In the purest  complexion, there is some of this pigment, which, however, disappears as  the fresh, round, soft cells next the cutis change into the old, flat,  horny scales at the surface.    Scars are white, because this part of the cuticle is not restored. The sun  has a powerful effect upon the coloring matter, and so we readily \"tan\" on  exposure to its rays. If the color gathers in spots, it forms freckles.  [Footnote: This action of the sun on the pigment of the skin is very  marked. Even among the Africans, the skin is observed to lose its intense  black color in those who live for many months in the shades of the forest.  It is said that Asiatic and African women confined within the walls of the  harem, and thus secluded from the sun, are as fair as Europeans. Among the  Jews who have settled in Northern Europe, are many of light complexion,  while those who live in India are as dark as the Hindoos. Intense heat  also increases this coloring matter, and thus a furnace-man's skin, even  where protected by clothing, becomes completely bronzed. The black pigment  has been known to disappear during severe illness, and a lighter color to  be developed in its place. Among the negroes, are sometimes found people  who have no complexion, _i. e._, there is no coloring matter in their  skin, hair, or the iris of their eyes. These persons are called Albinos.]    II. HAIR AND NAILS.    The Hair and the Nails are modified forms of the cuticle.    FIG. 23.    [Illustration: A _Hair, magnified 600 diameters._ S, _the sac  (follicle);_ P, _the papilla, showing the cells and the blood  vessels:_ V.]    THE HAIR is a protection from heat and cold, and shields the head from  blows. It is found on nearly all parts of the body, except the palms of  the hands and the soles of the feet. The outside of a hair is hard and  compact, and consists of a layer of colorless scales, which overlie one  another like the shingles of a house; the interior is porous, [Footnote:  In order to examine a hair, it should be put on the slide of the  microscope, and covered with a thin glass, while a few drops of alcohol  are allowed to flow between the cover and the slide. This causes the air,  which fills the hair and prevents our seeing its structure, to escape.]  and probably conveys the liquids by which it is nourished.    Each hair grows from a tiny bulb (papilla), which is an elevation of the  cutis at the bottom of a little hollow in the skin. From the surface of  this bulb, the hair is produced, like the cuticle, by the constant  formation of new cells at the bottom. When the hair is pulled out, this  bulb, if uninjured, will produce a new one; but, when once destroyed, it  will never grow again. [Footnote: Hair grows at the rate of about five to  seven inches in a year. It is said to grow after death. This appearance is  due to the fact that by the shrinking of the skin the part below the  surface is caused to project, which is especially noticeable in the  beard.] The hair has been known to whiten in a single night by fear,  fright, or nervous excitement. When the color has once changed, it can not  be restored. [Footnote: Hair dyes, or so-called \"hair restorers,\" are  almost invariably deleterious substances, depending for their coloring  properties upon the action of lead or lunar caustic. Frequent instances of  hair poisoning have occurred, owing to the common use of such dangerous  articles. If the growth of the hair be impaired, the general constitution  or the skin needs treatment. This is the work of a skillful physician, and  not of a patent remedy. Dame Fashion has her repentant freaks as well as  her ruinous follies, and it is a healthful sign that the era of universal  hair dyeing has been blotted out from her present calendar, and the gray  hairs of age are now honored with the highest place in \"style\" as well as  in good sense and cleanliness.] (See p. 285.)    Wherever hair exists, tiny muscles are found, interlaced among the fibers  of the skin. These, when contracting under the influence of cold or  electricity, pucker up the skin, and cause the hair to stand on end.  [Footnote: In horses and other animals which are able to shake the whole  skin, this muscular tissue is much more fully developed than in man.] The  hairs themselves are destitute of feeling. Nerves, however, are found in  the hollows in which the hair is rooted, and so one feels pain when it is  pulled. [Footnote: These nerves are especially abundant in the whiskers of  the cat, which are used as feelers.] Thus the insensible hairs become  wonderfully delicate instruments to convey an impression of even the  slightest touch.    FIG. 24.    [Illustration: A, _a perspiratory tube with its gland;_ B, _a hair  with a muscle and two oil glands;_ C, _cuticle;_ D, _the  papillæ;_ and E, _fat cells._]    Next to the teeth and bones, the hair is the least destructible part of  the body, and its color is often preserved for many years after the other  portions have gone to decay. [Footnote: Fine downy hairs, such as are  general upon the body, have been detected in the little fragments of skin  found beneath the heads of the nails by which, centuries ago, certain  robbers were fastened to the church doors, as a punishment for their  sacrilege.]    THE NAILS protect the ends of the tender finger, and toe, and give us  power more firmly to grasp and easily to pick up any object we may desire.  They enable us to perform a hundred little, mechanical acts which else  were impossible. At the same time, their delicate color and beautiful  outline give a finish of ornament to that exquisite instrument, the hand.  The nail is firmly set in a groove (matrix) in the cuticle, from which it  grows at the root in length [Footnote: By making a little mark on the nail  near the root we can see, week by week, how rapidly this process goes on,  and so form some idea of what a multitude of cells must be transformed  into the horny matter of the nail.] and from beneath in thickness. So long  as the matrix at the root is uninjured, the nail will be replaced after  any accident. (See p. 288.)    III. THE MUCOUS MEMBRANE.    STRUCTURE.--At the edges of the openings into the body, the skin seems to  stop and give place to a tissue which is redder, more sensitive, more  liable to bleed, and is moistened by a fluid, or mucus, as it is called.  Really, however, the skin does not cease, but passes into a more delicate  covering of the same general structure, viz., an outer, hard, bloodless,  insensible layer, and an inner, soft, sanguine, nervous one. [Footnote:  With a dull knife, we can scrape from the mucous membrane which lines the  mouth some of the cuticle for examination under the microscope. In a  similar way, we can obtain cuticle from the surface of the body for study  and comparison.] Thus every part of the body is wrapped in a kind of  double bag, made of tough skin on the outside, and tender mucous membrane  on the inside.    CONNECTIVE TISSUE.--The cutis and the corresponding layer of the mucous  membrane consist chiefly of a fibrous substance interlaced, like felt. It  is called connective tissue, because it connects all the different parts  of the body. It spreads from the cutis, invests muscles, bones, and  cartilages, and thence passes into the mucous membrane. So thoroughly does  it permeate the body, that, if the other tissues were destroyed, it would  give a perfect model of every organ. [Footnote: It is curious to notice  how our body is wrapped in membrane. On the outside, is the skin  protecting from exterior injury, and, on the inside, is the mucous  membrane reaching from the lips to the innermost air cell of the lungs.  Every organ is enveloped in its membrane. Every bone has its sheath. Every  socket is lined. Even the separate fibers of muscles have their covering  tissue. The brain and the spinal cord are triply wrapped, while the eye is  only a membranous globe filled with fluid. These membranes protect and  support the organs they enfold, but, with that wise economy so  characteristic of nature everywhere, they have also an important function  to perform. They are the _filters_ of the body. Through their pores  pass alike the elements of growth, and the returning products of waste. On  one side, bathed by the blood, they choose from it suitable food for the  organ they envelop, and many of them in their tiny cells, by some  mysterious process, form new products,--put the finishing touches, as it  were, upon the material ere it is deposited in the body.] It can be seen  in a piece of meat as a delicate substance lying between the layers of  muscle, where it serves to bind together the numerous fibers of which they  are composed.    Connective tissue yields gelatine on boiling, and is the part which tans  when hides are manufactured into leather. It is very elastic, so that when  you remove your finger after pressing upon the skin, no indentation is  left. [Footnote: In dropsy, this elasticity is lost by distension, and  there is a kind of \"pitting,\" as it is called, produced by pressure.] It  varies greatly in character,--from the mucous membrane, where it is soft  and tender, to the ligaments and tendons which it largely composes, where  it is strong and dense. [Footnote: The leather made from this tissue  varies as greatly, from the tough, thick oxhide, to the soft, pliable kid  and chamois skin.]    FAT is deposited as an oil in the cells [Footnote: So tiny are these  cells, that there are over sixty-five million in a cubic inch of fat. As  they are kept moist, the liquid does not ooze out, but, on drying, it  comes to the surface, and thus a piece of fat feels oily when exposed to  the air. The quantity of fat varies with the state of nutrition. In  corpulent persons, the masses of fat beneath the"]]]
