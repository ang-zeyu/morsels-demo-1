The Navy had a different problem as it moved into the non-rigid picture  in the early 1930's. Its problem was only incidentally to operate away  from its base at Lakehurst. Ships were getting larger in size, and masts  were needed where they could be moored outdoors, or taken in and out of  the hangar. The solution was a smaller replica of the rigid airship's  \"Iron Horse\" except that it moved on large rubber tires, and was towed  in and out by tractor, rather than carrying its own power plant.    A portable mast was also developed for the Navy blimps, with a special  car to haul it around. This mast could be sent to Parris Island or some  point in New England, ahead of time, set up and used as a temporary base  for radio calibrating or other missions.    Navy ships basing at Lakehurst have operated for weeks at a time along  the coast as far north as Bath, Maine, and as far south as the  Carolinas, with a portable mast as headquarters.    Utilization of the mast principle by non-rigid airships not only greatly  increased their radius of operation, and cut down landing crews, but  increased the number of operating days per month.    Pilots of early airplanes used to go out on the airport, hold up a  handkerchief, and if it fluttered, conclude it was too windy to fly. So  early airship pilots, with anemometers on the roof of the hangar and at  points over the field, judged it too risky to take the ships out if the  wind was higher than four or five miles an hour, and then only if it was  down-hangar in direction.    Modern airships lose few flying days because it is too windy to go out.  Under war conditions, when risks must be taken, which need not be taken  for passenger or training flights, very few days would be wasted if  there is military necessity for it.    Navy non-rigids miss few rendezvous with the fleet in exercises out of  Lakehurst, regardless of the weather outside.    If the portable mast revolutionized airship operations over land,  experiments started by the Navy in 1938-39, largely under the direction  of Lt. C. S. Rounds, promise to be just as important in over-water  operations. These showed that the airship could pick up ballast from the  ocean, could get fuel from a passing ship, could change crews at sea.    Ballast is important to a vehicle which growing continuously lighter as  it uses up fuel, must still be kept in equilibrium. Transoceanic  Zeppelins, using hydrogen, had to fly high enough to \"blow off\" the  surplus gas once or twice during a trip to compensate for the ship  growing lighter. But hydrogen was cheap, and could be manufactured as  needed. American ships could not afford to waste helium, which was a  natural resource. Army and Navy engineers had worked on this, and  equipment developed for the Akron and Macon to condense the gases from  the burned fuel was able to recover more than 100 pounds of water  ballast for every 100 pounds of fuel used.    The blimps didn't use these since they ordinarily would not be out for  more than a day at a time, still a ready source of ballast would make it  unnecessary to valve helium on long flights.    Ironically enough a whole ocean full of ballast lay below seagoing  airships, but no practical method had been devised to take the sea water  aboard until the Navy tackled the problem in 1938.    That problem may be visualized in the obvious difficulty of maintaining  physical contact between an airship and a surface ship. The two move in  different media, one influenced mostly by the waves, the other mostly by  the wind. The surface ship is moving up and down, the airship subject to  gusts which might break the contact or thrust it violently against the  masts or superstructure of the surface ship. Servicing has been done  under favorable circumstances, but could not be relied on as standard  procedure.    The solution reached was this. The pilot swings his ship down to within  100 or 150 feet of the water, lowers a hose with a small bronze scoop,  not much wider than the hose, so as to lessen the drag.    Twenty-five feet up from the scoop is a streamlined cylinder, blimp  shaped, carrying a small electric pump. This cylinder, nicknamed the  \"fish\", has tail fins to keep it from spinning, and skims along the  surface or jumps out like a porpoise, but the scoop is far enough behind  and heavy enough to trail easily beneath the surface, stays directly in  the ship's wake, continues without interruption to pick up ballast for  the airship above.    The whole gear weighs slightly more than 100 pounds, can pick up water  at cruising speed, can function in rough water or smooth. The Navy J-4,  chiefly used in these experiments, normally consumes 500 pounds of fuel  in five hours of flying at cruising speed. It was able to pick up that  much water ballast in seven minutes.    The next step was to enable an airship to obtain fuel from a tanker or  other ship without physical contact or advance arrangements--even from a  passing merchantman. The pilot asks by radio or voice whether the  surface ship can spare some gasoline, and on an affirmative answer,  lowers or drops on his deck two rubberized fabric spheres connected to  each other by 14 feet of rope--also a note of instructions. The smaller  sphere is an ordinary air-filled buoy, the larger, about three feet in  diameter when filled, is the fuel bag. The surface ship fills the fuel  bag, then drops both bags overboard, being careful only that they do not  get tangled up. Then the airship flies over the two bags, drops a hook  between them, hauls away, pumps the gasoline into its tanks.    The third device permits an airship to anchor in the open sea near a  surface ship to transfer crews or take on fuel and supplies. The anchor  is a cone-shaped rubberized fabric bag, ten feet long, with a diameter  of 2-1/2 feet at the top. It is lowered 50 feet below the airship by two  cables connected with each other by rungs to form a ladder. Half of the  cables' length is made up of heavy exerciser cord to dampen the effect  of wave movements. On top the cone is a wire mesh cover which allows the  water to pass through, and is strong enough to act as a platform,  supporting a man.    As the cone fills up the airship drops ballast till its \"mooring mast\"  is half submerged. The principle of the drag rope comes into play--if  the airship starts to rise it finds itself lifting an increasingly  heavier load, counteracting the rising tendency. If it starts to settle  down toward the water, the load is correspondingly lessened and the ship  grows lighter. The result is that the airship is held highly stable,  even in a rough sea. The surface ship then sends a small boat alongside  and dispatches the relief crew members or supplies, them up and down the  ladder, or uses a winch, the platform atop the anchor serving as the  operating base. This system also permits the moving of a sick passenger  ashore, or the rescue of a man overboard.    When the airship is ready to leave its anchorage, the cone is tipped by  a line attached to the bottom, spilling the water, and hauled aboard.  The servicing ship need carry no special equipment. The weight of cone  and ladder is negligible.    By being able to pick up ballast and borrow fuel from a passing ship,  (neither airship nor surface ship need slow down for the fuel exchange  if going in the same direction) the airship greatly increases its radius  of operations.    The advantage of being able to change crews at sea may not be quite as  clear. This, however, grows out of the fact that today's non-rigid  airship has greater endurance than the crew which flies it. An  anti-submarine, anti-mine patrol calls for constant alertness. Reduction  of vibration and noise, the use of closed cars instead of open cockpits  has lessened fatigue, enabling men to remain on duty over longer periods  than before. But obviously there are limits.    The Navy is conservative in estimating how long its new \"K\" ships may  stay out without refueling. Weather and the nature of the mission will  have some bearing on that, but if we assume a cruise of 48, 60 or even  72 hours which might be done under favorable conditions and idling the  motors, we still cannot expect a crew of men to remain vigilant and  alert for that length of time.    Extra men for relief watches can be carried only at the expense of the  fuel load. However, if a fresh crew could be sent aboard every 12 hours  from a nearby surface ship, along with fuel, ballast and supplies, the  blimps might operate for extended periods.    No blimps have done this. The fleet might see no need for them to go out  for long periods. However, the possibility has been established, and  might be useful in the emergencies of war, or accident. While the  primary usefulness of the blimp lies in the coastal waters, it can go to  sea if needed--and stay out--can be used in convoy work or as a  listening post.    Other improvements were uncovered during the experiments. A sea anchor  or drogue was devised to enable the airship to \"lay to\" for extended  periods, without consuming fuel, in case it wishes to use its listening  devices against submarines, make repairs or for other purposes. Plans  have been worked out for landing on the water in quiet bays in calm  weather, utilizing flotation gear, or a three-point mooring to ordinary  mud anchors--facilitating servicing from nearby Coast Guard stations.    Perhaps a significant thing about these experiments is that the  principles seem applicable as well to rigid airships. The ability to  pick up ballast in flight may well eliminate the necessity for  ballast-recovery devices, with a substantial saving in cost, and an  impressive saving in weight.    By eliminating the heavy condensers, and translating that weight-saving  into fuel, it is estimated that the range of a ship of the Los Angeles  size could be increased by 20 percent and ships of the Akron-Macon size  by 15"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5157"],[0,"How I Found Livingstone (#10)"],[1,"contained.  Calculating one hundred and forty pagazis at 25 doti each, I supposed I  had enough, yet, though I had been trying to teach the young Hindi that  the Musungu was not a fool, nor blind to his pilfering tricks, though  the 3,500 doti were all spent; though I had only obtained one hundred  and thirty pagazis at 25 doti each, which in the aggregate amounted to  3,200 doti: Soor Hadji Palloo's bill was $1,400 cash extra. His plea was  that he had furnished Ulyah clothes for Muhongo 240 doti, equal in value  to 960 of my doti, that the money was spent in ferry pice, in presents  to chiefs of caravans of tents, guns, red broad cloth, in presents to  people on the Mrima (coast) to induce them to hunt up pagazis. Upon this  exhibition of most ruthless cheating I waxed indignant, and declared to  him that if he did not run over his bill and correct it, he should go  without a pice.    But before the bill could be put into proper shape, my words, threats,  and promises falling heedlessly on a stony brain, a man, Kanjee by name,  from the store of Tarya Topan, of Zanzibar, had to come over, when the  bill was finally reduced to $738. Without any disrespect to Tarya Topan,  I am unable to decide which is the most accomplished rascal, Kanjee,  or young Soor Hadji Palloo; in the words of a white man who knows them  both, \"there is not the splitting of a straw between them.\" Kanjee is  deep and sly, Soor Hadji Palloo is bold and incorrigible. But peace be  to them both, may their shaven heads never be covered with the troublous  crown I wore at Bagamoyo!    My dear friendly reader, do not think, if I speak out my mind in this  or in any other chapter upon matters seemingly trivial and unimportant,  that seeming such they should be left unmentioned. Every tittle related  is a fact, and to knew facts is to receive knowledge.    How could I ever recite my experience to you if I did not enter upon  these miserable details, which sorely distract the stranger upon his  first arrival? Had I been a Government official, I had but wagged my  finger and my quota of pagazis had been furnished me within a week; but  as an individual arriving without the graces of official recognition,  armed with no Government influence, I had to be patient, bide my time,  and chew the cud of irritation quietly, but the bread I ate was not all  sour, as this was.    The white men, Farquhar and Shaw, were kept steadily at work upon  water-proof tents of hemp canvas, for I perceived, by the premonitory  showers of rain that marked the approach of the Masika that an ordinary  tent of light cloth would subject myself to damp and my goods to mildew,  and while there was time to rectify all errors that had crept into my  plans through ignorance or over haste, I thought it was not wise to  permit things to rectify themselves. Now that I have returned uninjured  in health, though I have suffered the attacks of twenty-three fevers  within the short space of thirteen months; I must confess I owe my life,  first, to the mercy of God; secondly, to the enthusiasm for my work,  which animated me from the beginning to the end; thirdly, to having  never ruined my constitution by indulgence in vice and intemperance;  fourthly, to the energy of my nature; fifthly, to a native hopefulness  which never died; and, sixthly, to having furnished myself with a  capacious water and damp proof canvas house. And here, if my experience  may be of value, I would suggest that travellers, instead of submitting  their better judgment to the caprices of a tent-maker, who will  endeavour to pass off a handsomely made fabric of his own, which is  unsuited to all climes, to use his own judgment, and get the best and  strongest that money will buy. In the end it will prove the cheapest,  and perhaps be the means of saving his life.    On one point I failed, and lest new and young travellers fall into the  same error which marred much of my enjoyment, this paragraph is written.  One must be extremely careful in his choice of weapons, whether for  sport or defence. A traveller should have at least three different  kinds of guns. One should be a fowling-piece, the second should be  a double-barrelled rifle, No. 10 or 12, the third should be a  magazine-rifle, for defence. For the fowling-piece I would suggest No.  12 bore, with barrels at least four feet in length. For the rifle for  larger game, I would point out, with due deference to old sportsmen, of  course, that the best guns for African game are the English Lancaster  and Reilly rifles; and for a fighting weapon, I maintain that the  best yet invented is the American Winchester repeating rifle, or the  \"sixteen, shooter\" as it is called, supplied with the London Eley's  ammunition. If I suggest as a fighting weapon the American Winchester, I  do not mean that the traveller need take it for the purpose of offence,  but as the beat means of efficient defence, to save his own life against  African banditti, when attacked, a thing likely to happen any time.    I met a young man soon after returning from the interior, who declared  his conviction that the \"Express,\" rifle was the most perfect weapon  ever invented to destroy African game. Very possibly the young man may  be right, and that the \"Express\" rifle is all he declares it to be, but  he had never practised with it against African game, and as I had  never tried it, I could not combat his assertion: but I could relate  my experiences with weapons, having all the penetrating powers of the  \"Express,\" and could inform him that though the bullets penetrated  through the animals, they almost always failed to bring down the game at  the first fire. On the other hand, I could inform him, that during  the time I travelled with Dr. Livingstone the Doctor lent me his heavy  Reilly rifle with which I seldom failed to bring an animal or two home  to the camp, and that I found the Fraser shell answer all purposes for  which it was intended. The feats related by Capt. Speke and Sir Samuel  Baker are no longer matter of wonderment to the young sportsman, when  he has a Lancaster or a Reilly in his hand. After very few trials he can  imitate them, if not excel their Leeds, provided he has a steady hand.  And it is to forward this end that this paragraph is written. African  game require \"bone-crushers;\" for any ordinary carbine possesses  sufficient penetrative qualities, yet has not he disabling qualities  which a gun must possess to be useful in the hands of an African  explorer.    I had not been long at Bagamoyo before I went over to Mussoudi's  camp, to visit the \"Livingstone caravan\" which the British Consul  had despatched on the first day of November, 1870, to the relief of  Livingstone. The number of packages was thirty-five, which required as  many men to convey them to Unyanyembe. The men chosen to escort this  caravan were composed of Johannese and Wahiyow, seven in number. Out of  the seven, four were slaves. They lived in clover here--thoughtless of  the errand they had been sent upon, and careless of the consequences.  What these men were doing at Bagamoyo all this time I never could  conceive, except indulging their own vicious propensities. It would  be nonsense to say there were no pagazis; because I know there were  at least fifteen caravans which had started for the interior since the  Ramadan (December 15th, 1870). Yet Livingstone's caravan had arrived at  this little town of Bagamoyo November 2nd, and here it had been lying  until the 10th February, in all, 100 days, for lack of the limited  number of thirty-five pagazis, a number that might be procured within  two days through consular influence.    Bagamoyo has a most enjoyable climate. It is far preferable in every  sense to that of Zanzibar. We were able to sleep in the open air, and  rose refreshed and healthy each morning, to enjoy our matutinal bath in  the sea; and by the time the sun had risen we were engaged in various  preparations for our departure for the interior. Our days were enlivened  by visits from the Arabs who were also bound for Unyanyembe; by comical  scenes in the camp; sometimes by court-martials held on the refractory;  by a boxing-match between Farquhar and Shaw, necessitating my prudent  interference when they waxed too wroth; by a hunting excursion now and  then to the Kingani plain and river; by social conversation with the  old Jemadar and his band of Baluches, who were never tired of warning me  that the Masika was at hand, and of advising me that my best course was  to hurry on before the season for travelling expired.    Among the employees with the Expedition were two Hindi and two Goanese.  They had conceived the idea that the African interior was an El Dorado,  the ground of which was strewn over with ivory tusks, and they had  clubbed together; while their imaginations were thus heated, to embark  in a little enterprise of their own. Their names were Jako, Abdul Kader,  Bunder Salaam, and Aranselar; Jako engaged in my service, as carpenter  and general help; Abdul Kader as a tailor, Bunder Salaam as cook, and  Aranselar as chief butler.    But Aranselar, with an intuitive eye, foresaw that I was likely to prove  a vigorous employer, and while there was yet time he devoted most of  it to conceive how it were possible to withdraw from the engagement. He  received permission upon asking for it to go to Zanzibar to visit his  friends. Two days afterwards I was informed he had blown his right eye  out, and received a medical confirmation of the fact, and note of the  extent of the injury, from Dr. Christie, the physician to His Highness  Seyd Burghash. His compatriots I imagined were about planning the same  thing, but a peremptory command to abstain from such folly, issued after  they had received their advance-pay, sufficed to check any sinister  designs they may have formed.
