[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/518"],[0,"The Enchanted Island of Yew (#10)"],[1," pleasant, and there  is no excitement or grief, whatever.  You have become a carpet-knight,  Prince Marvel, and think more of bright eyes than of daring deeds.  So,  if you will release me from your service I will seek further  adventures.\"    \"Nay,\" returned the prince, \"we will go together; for I, too, am tired  of this life of pleasure.\"    So next morning Marvel sought the presence of King Terribus and said:    \"I have come to bid your Majesty adieu, for my esquire and I are about  to leave your dominions.\"    At first the king laughed, and his long nose began to sway from side to  side.  Then, seeing the prince was in earnest, his Majesty frowned and  grew disturbed.  Finally he said:    \"I must implore you to remain my guests a short time longer.  No one  has ever before visited me in my mountain home, and I do not wish to  lose the pleasure of your society so soon.\"    \"Nevertheless, we must go,\" answered the prince, briefly.    \"Are you not contented?\" asked Terribus.  \"Ask whatever you may desire,  and it shall be granted you.\"    \"We desire adventures amid new scenes,\" said Marvel, \"and these you can  not give us except by permission to depart.\"    Seeing his guest was obstinate the king ceased further argument and  said:    \"Very well; go if you wish.  But I shall hope to see you return to us  this evening.\"    The prince paid no heed to this peculiar speech, but left the hall and  hurried to the courtyard of the castle, where Nerle was holding the  horses in readiness for their journey.    Standing around were many rows and files of the Gray Men, and when they  reached the marble roadway they found it lined with motionless forms of  the huge giants.  But no one interfered with them in any way, although  both Prince Marvel and Nerle knew that every eye followed them as they  rode forward.    Curiously enough, they had both forgotten from what direction they had  approached the castle; for, whereas they had at that time noticed but  one marble roadway leading to the entrance, they now saw that there  were several of these, each one connecting with a path through the  mountains.    \"It really doesn't matter which way we go, so long as we get away from  the Kingdom of Spor,\" said Prince Marvel; so he selected a path by  chance, and soon they were riding through a mountain pass.    The pleased, expectant look on Nerle's face had gradually turned to one  of gloom.    \"I hoped we should have a fight to get away,\" he said, sadly; \"and in  that case I might have suffered considerable injury and pain.  But no  one has injured us in any way, and perhaps King Terribus is really glad  to be rid of us.\"    \"With good reason, too, if such is the case,\" laughed Marvel; \"for,  mark you, Nerle, the king has discovered we are more powerful than he  is, and had he continued to oppose us, we might have destroyed his  entire army.\"    On they rode through the rough hill paths, winding this way and that,  until they lost all sense of the direction in which they were going.    \"Never mind,\" said the prince; \"so long as we get farther and farther  away from the ugly Terribus I shall be satisfied.\"    \"Perhaps we are getting into more serious danger than ever,\" answered  Nerle, brightening; \"one of the giants told me the other day that near  the foot of these mountains is the Kingdom of the High Ki of Twi.\"    \"Who is the High Ki of Twi?\" asked Prince Marvel.    \"No one knows,\" answered Nerle.    \"And what is the Kingdom of Twi like?\"    \"No one knows that,\" answered Nerle.    \"Then,\" returned the prince, with a smile, \"if by chance we visit the  place we shall know more than any one else.\"    At noon they ate luncheon by the wayside, Nerle having filled his pouch  by stealth at the breakfast table.  There were great fragments of rock  lying all about them, and the sun beat down so fiercely that the heat  reflected from the rocks was hard to bear.  So the travelers did not  linger over their meal, but remounted and rode away as soon as  possible.  When the sun began to get lower in the sky the rocks beside  the path threw the riders into shadow, so that their journey became  more pleasant.  They rode along, paying little attention to the way,  but talking and laughing merrily together, until it began to grow dark.    \"Does this path never end?\" asked Prince Marvel, suddenly.  \"We ought  to reach some place where men dwell before long, else we shall be  obliged to spend the night among these rocks.\"    \"And then perhaps the wolves will attack us,\" said Nerle, cheerfully,  \"and tear us into pieces with their sharp teeth and claws.\"    But even as he spoke they rode around a turn in the path and saw a  sight that made them pause in astonishment.  For just before them rose  the castle of King Terribus, and along both sides of the marble walk  leading up to it were ranged the lines of giants, exactly as they had  stood in the morning.    Nerle turned around in his saddle.  Sure enough, there were the Gray  Men in the rear--stepping from behind every boulder and completely  filling the rocky pathway.    \"Well, what shall we do?\" asked the esquire; \"fight?\"    \"No, indeed!\" returned Prince Marvel, laughing at his friend's eager  face.  \"It appears the path we chose winds around in a circle, and so  has brought us back to our starting-point.  So we must make the best of  a bad blunder and spend another night with our ugly friend King  Terribus.\"    They rode forward through the rows of giants to the castle, where the  ever-courteous servants took their horses and escorted them to their  former handsome apartments with every mark of respect.    No one seemed in the least surprised at their speedy return, and this  fact at first puzzled Nerle, and then made him suspicious.    After bathing and dusting their clothing they descended to the banquet  hall, where King Terribus sat upon his gray stone throne and welcomed  them with quiet courtesy.    The sight of the king's crimson skin and deformed face sent a thrill of  repugnance through Prince Marvel, and under the impulse of a sudden  thought he extended his hand toward Terribus and whispered a magic word  which was unheard by any around him.    Nerle did not notice the prince's swift gesture nor the whispered word;  but he was staring straight at Terribus at the time, and he saw with  surprise the eye on the top of the king's head move down toward his  forehead, and the eye in the center of his forehead slide slightly  toward the left, and the elephant-like nose shrink and shorten at the  same time.  Also it seemed to him that the king's skin was not so  crimson in color as before, and that a thin growth of hair had covered  his head.    However, no one else appeared to notice any change--least of all  Terribus--so Nerle seated himself at the table and began to eat.    \"It was very kind of you to return so soon to my poor castle,\" said the  king to Prince Marvel, in his sweet voice.    \"We could not help it,\" laughed the prince, in reply; \"for the road  wound right and left until we knew not which way we traveled; and then  it finally circled around again to your castle.  But to-morrow we shall  seek a new path and bid you farewell forever.\"    \"Still,\" remarked the king, gravely, \"should you again miss your way, I  shall be glad to welcome your return.\"    The prince bowed politely by way of reply, and turned to address the  little maiden he had once saved from death by poison.  And so in  feasting, dancing and laughter the evening passed pleasantly enough to  the prince, and it was late when he called Nerle to attend him to their  apartment.        12.  The Gift of Beauty    The following morning Marvel and Nerle once more set out to leave the  Kingdom of Spor and its ugly king.  They selected another pathway  leading from the castle and traveled all day, coming at nightfall into  view of the place whence they had started, with its solemn rows of  giants and Gray Men standing ready to receive them.    This repetition of their former experience somewhat annoyed the prince,  while Nerle's usually despondent face wore a smile.    \"I see trouble ahead,\" murmured the esquire, almost cheerfully.  \"Since  the king can not conquer us by force he intends to do it by sorcery.\"    Marvel did not reply, but greeted the king quietly, while Terribus  welcomed their return as calmly as if he well knew they could not  escape him.    That evening the prince made another pass toward the king with his hand  and muttered again the magic word.  Nerle was watching, and saw the  upper eye of Terribus glide still farther down his forehead and the  other eye move again toward the left.  The swaying nose shrank to a few  inches in length, and the skin that had once been so brilliantly  crimson turned to a dull red color.  This time the courtiers and ladies  in waiting also noticed the change in the king's features, but were  afraid to speak of it, as any reference to their monarch's personal  appearance was by law punishable by death.  Terribus saw the startled  looks directed upon him, and raised his hand to feel of his nose and  eyes; but thinking that if any change in his appearance had taken  place, he must be uglier than before, he only frowned and turned away  his head.    The next day the king's guests made a third attempt to leave his  dominions, but met with no better success than before, for a long and  tedious ride only brought them back to their starting-place in the  evening.    This time Prince Marvel was really angry, and striding into the king's  presence he reproached him bitterly, saying:    \"Why do you prevent us from leaving your kingdom?  We have not injured  you in any way.\"    \"You have seen ME,\" returned Terribus, calmly, \"and I do not intend you  shall go back to the world and tell people how ugly I am.\"    The prince looked at him, and could not repress a smile.  The two eyes  of the king, having been twice removed from their first position, were  now both in his forehead,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5180"],[0,"Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) Ruling (#10)"],[1,"under that category.   Similarly, a customer may remove individual URLs from category  lists.  Importantly, however, no one but the filtering companies  has access to the complete list of URLs in any category.  The  actual URLs or IP addresses of the Web sites or pages contained  in filtering software vendors' category lists are considered to  be proprietary information, and are unavailable for review by  customers or the general public, including the proprietors of Web  sites that are blocked by filtering software.      Filtering software companies do not generally notify the  proprietors of Web sites when they block their sites.  The only  way to discover which URLs are blocked and which are not blocked  by any particular filtering company is by testing individual URLs  with filtering software, or by entering URLs one by one into the  \"URL checker\" that most filtering software companies provide on  their Web sites.  Filtering software companies will entertain  requests for recategorization from proprietors of Web sites that  discover their sites are blocked.  Because new pages are  constantly being added to the Web, filtering companies provide  their customers with periodic updates of category lists.  Once a  particular Web page or site is categorized, however, filtering  companies generally do not re-review the contents of that page or  site unless they receive a request to do so, even though the  content on individual Web pages and sites changes frequently.  2.        The Methods that Filtering Companies Use to  Compile Category Lists      While the way in which filtering programs operate is  conceptually straightforward  by comparing a requested URL to a  previously compiled list of URLs and blocking access to the  content at that URL if it appears on the list  accurately  compiling and categorizing URLs to form the category lists is a  more complex process that is impossible to conduct with any high  degree of accuracy.  The specific methods that filtering software  companies use to compile and categorize control lists are, like  the lists themselves, proprietary information.  We will therefore  set forth only general information on the various types of  methods that all filtering companies deposed in this case use,  and the sources of error that are at once inherent in those  methods and unavoidable given the current architecture of the  Internet and the current state of the art in automated  classification systems.  We base our understanding of these  methods largely on the detailed testimony and expert report of  Dr. Geoffrey Nunberg, which we credit.  The plaintiffs offered,  and the Court qualified, Nunberg as an expert witness on  automated classification systems.  When compiling and categorizing URLs for their category  lists, filtering software companies go through two distinct  phases.  First, they must collect or \"harvest\" the relevant URLs  from the vast number of sites that exist on the Web.  Second,  they must sort through the URLs they have collected to determine  under which of the company's self-defined categories (if any),  they should be classified.  These tasks necessarily result in a  tradeoff between overblocking (i.e., the blocking of content that  does not meet the category definitions established by CIPA or by  the filtering software companies), and underblocking (i.e.,  leaving off of a control list a URL that contains content that  would meet the category definitions defined by CIPA or the  filtering software companies).  1.        The \"Harvesting\" Phase      Filtering software companies, given their limited resources,  do not attempt to index or classify all of the billions of pages  that exist on the Web.  Instead, the set of pages that they  attempt to examine and classify is restricted to a small portion  of the Web.  The companies use a variety of automated and manual  methods to identify a universe of Web sites and pages to  \"harvest\" for classification.  These methods include: entering  certain key words into search engines; following links from a  variety of online directories (e.g., generalized directories like  Yahoo or various specialized directories, such as those that  provide links to sexually explicit content); reviewing lists of  newly-registered domain names; buying or licensing lists of URLs  from third parties; \"mining\" access logs maintained by their  customers; and reviewing other submissions from customers and the  public.  The goal of each of these methods is to identify as many  URLs as possible that are likely to contain content that falls  within the filtering companies' category definitions.      The first method, entering certain keywords into commercial  search engines, suffers from several limitations.  First, the Web  pages that may be \"harvested\" through this method are limited to  those pages that search engines have already identified.  However, as noted above, a substantial portion of the Web is not  even theoretically indexable (because it is not linked to by any  previously known page), and only approximately 50% of the pages  that are theoretically indexable have actually been indexed by  search engines.  We are satisfied that the remainder of the  indexable Web, and the vast \"Deep Web,\" which cannot currently be  indexed, includes materials that meet CIPA's categories of visual  depictions that are obscene, child pornography, and harmful to  minors.  These portions of the Web cannot presently be harvested  through the methods that filtering software companies use (except  through reporting by customers or by observing users' log files),  because they are not linked to other known pages.  A user can,  however, gain access to a Web site in the unindexed Web or the  Deep Web if the Web site's proprietor or some other third party  informs the user of the site's URL.  Some Web sites, for example,  send out mass email advertisements containing the site's URL, the  spamming process we have described above.  Second, the search engines that software companies use for  harvesting are able to search text only, not images.  This is of  critical importance, because CIPA, by its own terms, covers only  \"visual depictions.\"  20 U.S.C. Sec. 9134(f)(1)(A)(i); 47 U.S.C. Sec.  254(h)(5)(B)(i).  Image recognition technology is immature,  ineffective, and unlikely to improve substantially in the near  future.  None of the filtering software companies deposed in this  case employs image recognition technology when harvesting or  categorizing URLs.  Due to the reliance on automated text  analysis and the absence of image recognition technology, a Web  page with sexually explicit images and no text cannot be  harvested using a search engine.  This problem is complicated by  the fact that Web site publishers may use image files rather than  text to represent words, i.e., they may use a file that computers  understand to be a picture, like a photograph of a printed word,  rather than regular text, making automated review of their  textual content impossible.  For example, if the Playboy Web site  displays its name using a logo rather than regular text, a search  engine would not see or recognize the Playboy name in that logo.        In addition to collecting URLs through search engines and  Web directories (particularly those specializing in sexually  explicit sites or other categories relevant to one of the  filtering companies' category definitions), and by mining user  logs and collecting URLs submitted by users, the filtering  companies expand their list of harvested URLs by using  \"spidering\" software that can \"crawl\" the lists of pages produced  by the previous four methods, following their links downward to  bring back the pages to which they link (and the pages to which  those pages link, and so on, but usually down only a few levels).   This spidering software uses the same type of technology that  commercial Web search engines use.  While useful in expanding the number of relevant URLs, the  ability to retrieve additional pages through this approach is  limited by the architectural feature of the Web that page-to-page  links tend to converge rather than diverge.  That means that the  more pages from which one spiders downward through links, the  smaller the proportion of new sites one will uncover; if  spidering the links of 1000 sites retrieved through a search  engine or Web directory turns up 500 additional distinct adult  sites, spidering an additional 1000 sites may turn up, for  example, only 250 additional distinct sites, and the proportion  of new sites uncovered will continue to diminish as more pages  are spidered.  These limitations on the technology used to harvest a set of  URLs for review will necessarily lead to substantial  underblocking of material with respect to both the category  definitions employed by filtering software companies and CIPA's  definitions of visual depictions that are obscene, child  pornography, or harmful to minors.  2.        The \"Winnowing\" or Categorization Phase      Once the URLs have been harvested, some filtering software  companies use automated key word analysis tools to evaluate the  content and/or features of Web sites or pages accessed via a  particular URL and to tentatively prioritize or categorize them.   This process may be characterized as \"winnowing\" the harvested  URLs.  Automated systems currently used by filtering software  vendors to prioritize, and to categorize or tentatively  categorize the content and/or features of a Web site or page  accessed via a particular URL operate by means of (1) simple key  word searching, and (2) the use of statistical algorithms that  rely on the frequency and structure of various linguistic  features in a Web page's text.  The automated systems used to  categorize pages do not include image recognition technology.  All of the filtering companies deposed in the case also employ  human review of some or all collected Web pages at some point  during the"]]]
