Nothing so clearly proved the absence  of self-realization as her feeling under detention that other  girls with whom she was in forced association were much beneath  her in quality, although many of them were not nearly so untidy  and had not been nearly so immoral.  During all this period of  several months, beginning with her running away and her writing  the housewifely letters about her imaginary married life, and  ending with her appeal for aid at the social center, Hazel was  indulging in veritable orgies of lying.  When away from home she  several times picked up men on the street and stayed at hotels  with them.    At the time of our first studies of this case we hardly dared to  offer either a mental or moral prognosis.    In the institution for delinquent young women to which she was  sent Hazel's traits were long maintained.  She proved very  troublesome on account of lies to her family, to the officers,  and to the other girls.  The latter soon discovered, however, the  peculiar lack of foundation for her stories.  In the institution  was also noted the tendency to untidiness of which her mother  spoke.  The authorities steadily persevered with Hazel.  They  secured another operation on her eye, which successfully  straightened it, and she became fully ``cured'' of her pelvic  disease.  She received instruction in a form of handicraft in  which she quickly showed special dexterity and skill.  Her  tendencies to falsify gradually became less.  About two years  later the mother again assumed control with great success.    This is the remarkable interest of Hazel's case, to wit, that  with proper discipline and the development of new interests her  fabricating tendencies have been reduced to a minimum.  She has  made a wonderful improvement and has long been a self-supporting  and self-respecting young woman with her own relation to the  world realized in a way that before seemed entirely lacking.    -------------------------------------------------------------  Mental conflict: About early secret               Case 1.                    experiences.

Brought at  first to us by her family as being insane because she was such a  great liar and unreliable in other ways, we never could find the  slightest evidence of aberration.  No satisfactory explanation  was forthcoming until the remarkable denouement when we learned  that the mother, whom we had come to know herself as an extreme  falsifier, was not the mother at all.  It seems clear that the  girl's behavior was largely the result of mental conflict about  certain suspected facts, and psychic contagion arising from the  world of lies in which she had lived.      Beula D. has been known in several cities and in more than one  court as the ``mystery girl.''  She has appeared on the scene in  various places, giving a fictitious name and telling elaborate  stories of herself which always proved to be without foundation.  She ran away from home on several occasions, but except in one  instance which we know about, has never been seriously  delinquent.  We saw her on many occasions and tried to get at the  truth of her stories of ill treatment and the like.  Investigators found there was unquestionably some truth in her  statements, but never from first to last in the many interviews  which we had with her was there ever any possibility of  separating truth from falsehood.  The girl simply did not seem to  know the difference between the two.  What was more, we found  that the mother presented the same characteristics.  She also, by  her most curious and complicated fabrications, led even her most  rational sympathizers into a bewildering maze.  A woman of  magnificent presence, tremendous will, and good intelligence, she  nevertheless was soon found to be absolutely unreliable in her  statements.  This woman's numerous inventions, so far as we have  been able to ascertain, have been quite beside the mark of any  possible advantage to be gained by her or her family.  Naturally  we here thought heredity played an important role, until our  final discovery that the two were not related.  The details which  we know about this case would cover scores of pages.  In summary  it stands as follows:    On the physical side Beula at 17 was a striking looking young  woman, but of very poor development.  She was only 4 ft. 7 in. in  height and weighed 102 lbs.  Expression was quiet, pleasant, and  responsive.  Unusually clear and pleasant voice.  Typical  Hutchinsonian teeth.  All other examination negative.  Menstruation first at 13 1/2, normal and regular.    Notwithstanding the mother's report of her being subnormal  mentally, we found that she had fair ability.  Her range of  information was good.  She was always desirous of writing  compositions, she wanted to be a story writer, she said, but her  diction was very immature and her spelling was poor, making  altogether a very mild production.  Never did we see any  essential incoherency in her mental processes, or any other signs  of aberration.  A series of association tests given in an  endeavor to discover some of the facts which her mother  maintained she herself was desirous of knowing (but really could  not have been), failed to elicit anything but the most normal  reactions, even to ideas about which we considered there must be  some feeling-tone.    On the ``Aussage'' Test only ten items were given from the  picture upon free recital.  On questioning twelve more details  were reported correctly, but no less than seven of these alleged  facts were incorrect.  Only one out of the five suggestions  offered was accepted.    No purpose would be served in recounting the details of falsehood  which were told by this girl about family affairs, about the  places she had worked, about the facts of home treatment, etc.  Her lying was not done cleverly, but it served to create much  confusion and gave considerable trouble to a number of social  agencies that came in contact with the family.  Even when she was  applying directly for help her lies stood greatly in the way of  achieving anything for her.  The confusion was vastly added to by  the many vagaries of her alleged parent, but, even so, one of the  chief accusations of the prevaricating mother was that the girl  herself was a terrible liar.  The whole situation was rendered  completely absurd and needless by the behavior of both the woman  and the girl.    After we had known this case for about three years and the truth  about Beula's antecedents had come to light as the result of a  new person stepping in on the scene, the girl's tendency to  falsification seemed quite inexplicable.  No one who came to know  the circumstances, even as we previously had been acquainted with  them, felt they could blame Beula much for her attitude of  dissatisfaction and her tendencies to run away.  We felt, too,  that the mystery which had always hovered about this girl was  sufficient to have led her to be fanciful and imaginative and  that the fabrications of the self-styled ``mother'' did not form  an atmosphere in which the girl could well achieve respect for  truth.  But Beula's almost confusional state concerning the facts  of her family life seemed quite explicable in the light of what  we at last ascertained.  Soon after we first saw the girl the  woman had told us a most remarkable tale of how it was she  happened to be the mother of the child, and the attempt was then  made by several to straighten out the apparent doubt in the  girl's mind.  But it seems that the clever and tragic tale of the  mother, although well calculated to do so, did not entirely cover  the points remembered by this girl of her earliest childhood.  Evidently for a time Beula tried to correlate the two, but doubt  grew apace.  It seemed almost as if her doubt as to who she was  led her to say first one thing and then another.  It was  particularly at a period of stress of this kind that she was  figuring in other cities as the ``mystery girl.''    The earlier facts of the case probably never will be known.  Of  the many details known by us it is sufficient to say that the  woman adopted Beula as a young child and proceeded by devious  methods to weave a network of lies about the situation of their  relationship.  Who Beula's parents really were neither she nor  any one else of whom we have heard, ever knew.    Beula showed such delinquent tendencies after a time that she had  to be sent to a corrective institution.  After coming out she  made off in the world for herself before we could give her the  information soon afterwards obtained by us.  At her last visit we  felt that her report in a terribly tragic mood on the family  conditions was totally unreliable.  She went forth to weave, no  doubt, new fabrications.  ---------------------------------------------------------------  Early experiences: Peculiar treatment        Case 2.       and excessive misrepresentations     Girl, age 19 years.       in home circle.

Matt.  xxiv. 30. Mark xiii. 26. But there are other heavens: for God created  this heaven, and this earth; and his throne existed before this world  rolled into existence, or the morning stars sang together for joy; for  \"Heaven is God's throne, and the earth is his footstool.\" Solomon says,  \"The heaven of heavens cannot contain thee.\" This heaven is veiled from  mortal vision; spirits abound, but we cannot see them; and angels hover  there, but to us are invisible, and can only be known or seen by the  revelation of God. Hence Paul says, he \"was caught up into the _third_  heaven.\" Stephen \"saw the heavens opened, and Jesus sitting on the  right hand of God.\" Where this revelation exists, there exists without  the removal of the body a perfect knowledge of things as they are known  to God, so far as they are revealed. Thus, when John was on the Isle  of Patmos, he says, \"I was in the spirit on the Lord's day, and heard  behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, Saying, I am Alpha and Omega,  the first and the last, and What thou seest write in a book.\" Rev.  i. 10, 11. Then commenced the revelation. It was the same also with  Stephen. From this we gather, that there is a veil that obscures the  heavens from our sight; but when that veil is removed, and our vision  is enlightened by the spirit of God, then we can gaze upon the glories  of the eternal world, and heaven is opened for our view.    When persons are taken from the earth, and hid from our view, it is  said they are gone to heaven. Hence it is said, that Elijah went by a  whirlwind into heaven, 2 Kings ii. 11. And it is also said of Jesus  that \"while he blessed them he was parted from them, and carried up  into heaven.\" Luke xxiv. 51. But it is the destination of the Saints  that we have to do with; and on this I would remark, that there are  many glories, and man will be judged according to his deeds. \"There is  one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory  of the stars; for as one star differeth from another star in glory, so  also is the resurrection.\" 2 Cor. xv. 41, 42.    It would not comport with my object at the present time to enter into  the whole of the details of this subject. I would briefly remark,  however, inasmuch as I am now talking of man's body, that there is a  place called \"Paradise,\" to which the spirits of the dead go, awaiting  the resurrection, and their reunion with the body. This was an old  doctrine of the Jews. Paul, too, \"was caught up into paradise and heard  unspeakable words.\" 2 Cor. xii. 4. John says, \"to him that overcometh  will I grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the  paradise of God.\" Rev. ii. 7. This Paradise, however, is not the place  for resurrected bodies, but for departed spirits: for Jesus said to the  thief on the cross, \"To day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.\" Luke  xxiii. 43. Two days after this, and after the resurrection of his body,  Mary was looking for the Lord, and he appeared to her: he said to her  \"Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my  brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father;  and to my God, and your God.\" John xx. 17. We learn here, then, that  Jesus went to Paradise, with the thief on the cross, in spirit; but  that he had not been with his body to his Father.    We will now speak of heaven, as a place of reward for the righteous.  Daniel, in speaking of the resurrection, says, \"Many of them that sleep  in the dust of the earth shall awake; some to everlasting life, and  some to shame and everlasting contempt.\" Dan. xii. 2. Jesus says, those  who have forsaken all and followed him, \"shall inherit everlasting  life\" Matt. xix. 29.    There is also a Book of Life spoken of. Paul speaks of some whose  names were written therein. Phil. iv. 3. John also refers to the same  things: he says \"He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white  raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the Book of Life.\"  Rev. iii. 5. Again, John, in speaking of the New Jerusalem, says, There  shall not enter into it anything that worketh abomination, or maketh a  lie; but they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life. Rev. xxi.  27. From this it would appear, that those who obey all the commandments  of God, and have their names written in the Lamb's Book of Life, shall  finally enter into the New Jerusalem. Jesus again says, \"To him that  overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also  overcame, and am sat down with my Father in his throne.\" Rev. iii. 21.  This, then, is the heaven, as far as I can conceive, that people expect  to go to.    We will now try to find out its location. Above we have noticed that  the saints are to have everlasting life, that they are to be with  Jesus, and also in the New Jerusalem. We have now to enquire, Where  Jesus's kingdom will be, and Where will be the place of the New  Jerusalem. Daniel says, \"I saw in the night visions, and behold one  like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the  Ancient of Days, and they brought him near before him. And there was  given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations,  and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting  dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall  not be destroyed.\" Dan. vii. 13, 14. Here, then, we find Jesus coming  to establish a kingdom. Where is that kingdom? The Scriptures say, that  all nations, languages, and tongues shall serve and obey him. Where  do those nations, languages, and tongues exist? The answer is, on the  earth. We will next enquire, Where the saints will be. Daniel says,  in the 27th verse, \"And the kingdom, and dominion, and the greatness  of the kingdom under the _whole heaven_ shall be given to the people  of the saints of the Most High.\" Here, then, we find Jesus reigning  under the whole heaven with his saints, and all nations, dominions, and  powers, serving him. I noticed above, that those who overcame would be  with Jesus, and with him have everlasting life. Zechariah speaks of a  time when there will be a great assemblage of people against Jerusalem;  after God's ancient people, the Jews, shall have been gathered there,  and the Lord himself shall come forth to their defence. He says, \"Then  shall the Lord go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he  fought in the day of battle. And his feet shall stand in that day upon  the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east; and the  Mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof, toward the east and  toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of  the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the  south. And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley  of the mountains shall reach unto Azal; yea, ye shall flee, like as ye  fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah:  and the Lord my God shall come and all the saints with thee. And the  Lord shall be king _over all the earth_: in that day there shall be one  Lord, and his name one.\" xiv. 3, 4, 5, 9. Here we find that Jesus is to  come, and _all his saints_ are to come with him. And that the Lord is  to be King over _all the earth_. The question again arises, Where will  Jesus reign with his saints? the answer is, _upon the earth_. Again,  we will refer to the revelations of John. He says, \"I saw the souls of  them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the word of  God .... and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years,\" Rev.  xx. 4. And if we wish to know Where they will reign, we will again let  John speak: \"For thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy  blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation. And  hast made us unto our God kings and priests, and we shall reign _on  the earth_.\" Rev. v. 9, 10. It is not necessary to quote more on this  subject; it is so plain that he that runs may read. I know that there  are those who will tell us that this is not the final destination of  the saints. I would here remark, that a great many events will take  place in regard to the renovation of the earth, which it would be  foreign to my subject at the present time to detail. I would state,  however, that when the earth shall have become pure, if people suppose  that they will then inhabit a heaven, not on the earth, they are  mistaken; for if we have the good fortune to have our names written in  the Lamb's Book of Life, and to enter into the New Jerusalem, we shall  in that very New Jerusalem have to descend to the earth. Methinks I  hear persons saying, What! shall we not, then, stay in heaven? Yes--in  heaven; but that heaven will be on the earth; for John says, \"And I saw  a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth  were past away (purified by fire and become celestial), and there was  no more sea. And I John saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down  from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.  And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold the tabernacle  of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his  people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God  shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more  death, neither sorrow, nor crying,"]]]
