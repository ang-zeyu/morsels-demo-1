I may perhaps be allowed to avail myself of this opportunity to point  out a practical side of the study of elementary species. This always  appears whenever wild plants are subjected to cultivation, either in  order to reproduce them as pure strains, or to cross them with other  already cultivated species. The latter practice is as a rule made use of  whenever a wild species is found to be in possession of some quality  which is considered as desirable for the cultivated forms. In the case  of the beach-plum it is the hardiness and the great abundance of fruits  of the wild species which might profitably be combined with the  recognized qualities of the ordinary plums. Now it is manifest, that in  order to make crosses, distinct individual plants are to be chosen, and  that the variability of the wild species may be of very great  importance. [59] Among the range of elementary species those should be  used which not only possess the desired advantages in the highest  degree, but which promise the best results in other respects or their  earliest attainment. The fuller our knowledge of the elementary species  constituting the systematic groups, the easier and the more reliable  will be the choice for the breeder. Many Californian wild flowers with  bright colors seem to consist of large numbers of constant elementary  forms, as for instance, the lilies, godetias, eschscholtias and others.  They have been brought into cultivation many times, but the minutest  distinction of their elementary forms is required to attain the highest  success.    In concluding, I will point out a very interesting difficulty, which in  some cases impedes the clear understanding of elementary species. It is  the lack of self-fertilization. It occurs in widely distant families,  but has a special interest for us in two genera, which are generally  known as very polymorphous groups.    One of them is the hawkweed or _Hieracium_, and the other is the  dandelion or _Taraxacum officinale_. Hawkweeds are known as a genus in  which the delimitation of the species is almost impossible, Thousands of  forms may be cultivated side by side in botanical gardens, exhibiting  [60] slight but undoubted differentiating features, and reproduce  themselves truly by seed. Descriptions were formerly difficult and so  complicated that the ablest writers on this genus, Fries and Nageli are  said not to have been able to recognize the separate species by the  descriptions given by each other. Are these types to be considered as  elementary species, or only as individual differences? The decision of  course, would depend upon their behavior in cultures. Such tests have  been made by various experimenters. In the dandelion the bracts of the  involucre give the best characters. The inner ones may be linear or  linear-lanceolate, with or without appendages below the tip; the outer  ones may be similar and only shorter, or noticeably larger, erect,  spreading or even reflexed, and the color of the involucre may be a pure  green or glaucous; the leaves may be nearly entire or pinnatifid, or  sinuate-dentate, or very deeply runcinate-pinnatifid, or even pinnately  divided, the whole plant being more or less glabrous.    Raunkiaer, who has studied experimentally a dozen types from Denmark,  found them constant, but observed that some of them have no pollen at  all, while in others the pollen, though present, is impotent. It does  not germinate on the stigma, cannot produce the ordinary tube, [61] and  hence has no fertilizing power. But the young ovaries do not need such  fertilization. They are sufficient unto themselves. One may cut off all  the flowers of a head before the opening of the anthers, and leave the  ovaries untouched, and the head will ripen its seeds quite as well. The  same thing occurs in the hawkweeds. Here, therefore, we have no  fertilization and the extensive widening of the variability, which  generally accompanies this process is, of course, wanting. Only partial  or vegetative variability is present. Unfertilized eggs when developing  into embryos are equivalent to buds, separated from the parent-plant and  planted for themselves. They repeat both the specific and the individual  characters of the parent. In the case of the hawkweed and the dandelion  there is at present no means of distinguishing between these two  contrasting causes of variability. But like the garden varieties which  are always propagated in the vegetative way, their constancy and  uniformity are only apparent and afford no real indication of hereditary  qualities.    In addition to these and other exceptional cases, seed-cultures are  henceforth to be considered as the sole means of recognizing the really  existing systematic units of nature. All other groups, including  systematic species and [62] genera, are equally artificial or  conventional. In other words we may state \"that current misconceptions  as to the extreme range of fluctuating variability of many native  species have generally arisen from a failure to recognize the composite  nature of the forms in question,\" as has been demonstrated by MacDougal  in the case of the common evening-primrose, _Oenothera biennis_. \"It is  evident that to study the behavior of the characters of plants we must  have them in their simplest combinations; to investigate the origin and  movements of species we must deal with them singly and uncomplicated.\"      [63]    LECTURE III    ELEMENTARY SPECIES OF CULTIVATED PLANTS    Recalling the results of the last lecture, we see that the species of  the systematists are not in reality units, though in the ordinary course  of floristic studies they may, as a rule, seem to be so. In some cases  representatives of the same species from different countries or regions,  when compared with one another do not exactly agree. Many species of  ferns afford instances of this rule, and Lindley and other great  systematists have frequently been puzzled by the wide range of  differences between the individuals of a single species.    In other cases the differing forms are observed to grow near each other,  sometimes in neighboring provinces, sometimes in the same locality,  growing and flowering in mixtures of two or three or even more  elementary types. The violets exhibit widespread ancient types, from  which the local species may be taken to have arisen. The common  ancestors of the Whitlow-grasses are probably not to be found [64] among  existing forms, but numerous types are crowded together in the southern  part of central Europe and more thinly scattered elsewhere, even as far  as western Asia. There can be little doubt that their common origin is  to be sought in the center of their geographic distribution.    Numerous other cases exhibit smaller numbers of elementary units within  a systematic species; in fact purely uniform species seem to be  relatively rare. But with small numbers there are of course no  indications to be expected concerning their common origin or the  starting point of their distribution.    It is manifest that these experiences with wild species must find a  parallel among cultivated plants. Of course cultivated plants were  originally wild and must have come under the general law. Hence we may  conclude that when first observed and taken up by man, they must already  have consisted of sundry elementary subspecies. And we may confidently  assert that some must have been rich and others poor in such types.    Granting this state of things as the only probable one, we can easily  imagine what must have been the consequences. If a wild species had been  taken into cultivation only once, the cultivated form would have been a  single elementary [65] type. But it is not very likely that such  partiality would occur often. The conception that different tribes at  different times and in distant countries would have used the wild plants  of their native regions seems far more natural than that all should have  obtained plants for cultivation from the same source or locality. If  this theory may be relied upon, the origin of many of the more widely  cultivated agricultural plants must have been multiple, and the number  of the original elementary species of the cultivated types must have  been so much the larger, the more widely distributed and variable the  plants under consideration were before the first period of cultivation.    Further it would seem only natural to explain the wide variability of  many of our larger agricultural and horticultural stocks by such an  incipient multiformity of the species themselves. Through commercial  intercourse the various types might have become mixed so as to make it  quite impossible to point out the native localities for each of them.    Unfortunately historical evidence on this point is almost wholly  lacking. The differences in question could not have been appreciated at  that remote period, and interest the common observer but little even  today. The history of most of the cultivated plants is very obscure,  [66] and even the most skillful historians, by sifting the evidence  afforded by the older writers, and that obtained by comparative  linguistic investigations have been able to do little more than frame  the most general outline of the cultural history of the most common and  most widely used plants.    Some authors assume that cultivation itself might have been the  principal cause of variability, but it is not proved, nor even probable,  that cultivated plants are intrinsically more variable than their wild  prototypes. Appearances in this case are very deceptive. Of course  widely distributed plants are as a rule richer in subspecies than forms  with limited distribution, and the former must have had a better chance  to be taken into cultivation than the latter. In many cases, especially  with the more recent cultivated species, man has deliberately chosen  variable forms, because of their greater"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7238"],[0,"My Four Years in Germany (#10)"],[1,"-commissioned officers  who represent military professionalism.    The Imperial Provinces or Reichsland, as Alsace and Lorraine are  called, had been in a peculiar position within the body politic  of Germany since their annexation in 1870. The Reichsland, as  indicated by its name, was to be considered as common property  of the German Empire and was not annexed to any one German State.  Its government is by an Imperial Viceroy, with a kind of cabinet  consisting of one Secretary of State, Civil and Under Secretaries  and Department heads, assisted by a legislative body of two chambers,  one elected by popular vote and the other consisting of members  partly elected by municipal bodies, universities, churches and so  forth, and partly appointed by the Imperial Government. The Viceroy  and his cabinet are appointed by the Emperor in his capacity of  the sovereign of the Reichsland. Until the thirty-first of May,  1911, the Reichsland had no constitution of its own, the form  of its government being regulated by the Reichstag and Federal  Council (Bundesrat) in about the same way as the territories  of the United States are ruled by Congress and the President.  In 1911, Alsace-Lorraine received a constitution which gave it  representation in the Federal Council, representation in the  Reichstag having already been granted as early as 1871. The sympathy  of Alsace-Lorraine for France had been increased by the policy of  several of the German viceroys,--von Manteuffel, Prince Hohenlohe,  Prince Münster and Count Wedel, who had, in their administrations,  alternated severe measures with great leniency and had not improved  conditions, so that the population, essentially South German,  was undoubtedly irritated by the tone and manner of the North  German officials.    Great industries had been developed by the Imperial Government,  especially textile and coal mining, and the industrial population  centering in Mülhausen was hotly and thoroughly Social Democratic.  The upper or well-to-do classes were tied to France by family  connections and by religion. The bourgeois remained mildly  anti-German, more properly speaking, anti-government, for similar  reasons, and the working men were opposed to the government on  social and economic grounds. The farming population, not troubling  much about the politics, but being affected by the campaign of  the nationalistic press, were in sympathy with France; so the  atmosphere was well prepared for the coming storm.    Zabern, or in French, Saverne, is a little town of between eight  and nine thousand inhabitants, beautifully situated at the foot  of the Vosges Mountains on the banks of the Rhine-Marne Canal.  Its garrison comprised the staff and two battalions of Infantry  Regiment, Number Ninety-nine, commanded by von Reuter, and among  its officers was a Lieutenant von Forstner, a young man only  twenty years old, whose boyish appearance had excited the school  children and boys working in nearby iron factories to ridicule  him. It became known that this young officer, while instructing  his men, had insulted the French flag and had called the Alsatian  recruits _Wackes_, a nick-name meaning \"square-head,\" and  frequently used by the people of Alsace-Lorraine in a jocular  way, but hotly resented by them if used towards them by others.  It was further reported that he had promised his men a reward  of ten marks if one of them, in case of trouble, should bring  down a Social Democrat. Forstner had told his men to beware,  and warned them against listening to French foreign agents, whom  the Germans claimed were inducing French soldiers to desert in  order to join the French legion. It is probable that Forstner,  in talking to his men of the French Foreign Legion, used language  offensive to French ears. He admitted that he had used the word  _Wackes_ in defiance of an order of the commanding general,  and for this he had been punished with several days' confinement  in a military prison. Lieutenant von Forstner, who was ordered  to instruct his squad about the regulations in case of trouble  with the civil population, claimed that he had only added to the  usual instructions a statement that every true soldier should  do his best to suppress any disturbances and that he, Forstner,  would give a special reward to any of his men who would arrest  one of \"those damned Social Democrats.\"    Reports of the acts of Forstner and other officers were rapidly  spread among the population. The two newspapers of Zabern published  articles. The excitement grew, and there were demonstrations  against the officials and especially against Forstner. Finally,  conditions became so bad that Colonel von Reuter requested the  head of the local civil administration, Director Mahler, to restore  order, stating that he would take the matter into his own hands  if order was not restored. The director, a native of a small  village near Zabern, replied coolly that he saw no necessity  for interfering with peace loving and law abiding people. On  November twenty-ninth, 1913, a large crowd assembled in front  of the barracks. Colonel von Reuter ordered Lieutenant Schad,  commanding the Guard as officer of the day, to disperse the crowd.  Accordingly Lieutenant Schad called the Guard to arms and three  times summoned the crowd to disperse and go home. The soldiers  charged and drove the multitude across the Square and into a  side street and arrested about fifteen persons, among them the  President, two Judges and the State Attorney of the Zabern Supreme  Court, who had just come out from the court building and who were  caught in the crowd. They were subsequently released. The rest  of the persons arrested were kept in the cellar of the barracks  over night.    The report of these occurrences caused immense excitement throughout  Germany. A great outcry went up against militarism, even in quarters  where no socialistic tendencies existed. This feeling was not  helped by the fact that the General commanding the fifteenth  army to which the Zabern regiment belonged was an exponent of  extreme militaristic ideas; a man, who several years before, as  Colonel of the Colonial troops, representing the war ministry  before the Reichstag and debating there the question of the number  of troops to be kept in German South West Africa, had most clearly  shown his contempt for the Reichstag.    Colonel von Reuter and Lieutenant Schad, when court-martialled  for their acts in ordering the troops to move against the civil  population, claimed the benefit of a Prussian law of 1820, which  provided that in any city, town or village, the highest military  officer in command must assume the authority, usually vested  in the civil government, whenever for any reason the civil  administration neglects to keep order. The Colonel and Lieutenant  were subsequently acquitted on the ground that they had acted  under the provisions of this law.    The excitement throughout Germany was further increased by other  circumstances. The Emperor remained during these critical days at  Donaueschingen, the princely estate of his friend and favourite,  Prince Fürstenberg, enjoying himself with fox-hunting, torch-light  processions and cabaret performances. Of course, all this had been  arranged long before anyone dreamed of any trouble in Zabern, and  the Emperor could scarcely be expected to realise the gravity of  the situation which suddenly arose. But this very fact created a  bad impression. It was even rumoured that the Empress, alarmed by  the situation, had ordered a train to be made ready in order to  go to him and try to convince him of the necessity of returning  to Berlin.    [Illustration: THE GLORY WHICH IS POTSDAM. SUMMER RESIDENCE OF  THE KAISER IN THE PARK OF SANS SOUCI.]    [Illustration: DEMONSTRATION OF SYMPATHY FOR THE AMERICANS, AT  THE TOWN HALL, AUGUST, 1914.]    The newly appointed minister of war, Falkenhayn, went to  Donaueschingen, where he was joined by von Deimling. This action  aggravated the situation, because the public concluded that the  Emperor would hear the advice and report of military officers  only. The sudden death, by heart failure, of the Emperor's closest  friend, von Hulsen, chief of the Emperor's Military Cabinet,  during a banquet at Donaueschingen, gave the rapidly developing  events a tragic and mysterious colouring, and these conferences  in Donaueschingen resulted in the tendering of their resignations  by the Viceroy, von Wedel, and Secretary of State Zorn von Bulach,  Viceroy and Secretary of State of Alsace-Lorraine, who felt that  the military party had gained an upper hand in the conflict with the  civil authorities. The Chancellor then hurried to Donaueschingen,  arriving a few hours before the departure of the Emperor; and a  subsequent order of the Emperor to General von Deimling to see  to it that the military officers did not overstep their authority  and directing him to investigate the occurrences and take measures  to punish all guilty parties, somewhat quieted the nation and  caused the two highest civil officials of Alsace-Lorraine to  withdraw their resignations.    Zabern, where a brigadier-general had been sent by von Deimling  to restore civil government, had begun to quiet down. But the  Chancellor had hardly returned to Berlin when another incident  stirred Germany. While practising field service in the neighbourhood  of Zabern and marching through a village, Lieutenant von Forstner  had an altercation with a lame shoemaker and cut him down. This  brutal act of militarism caused a new outburst throughout Germany.  Forstner was tried by a court-martial for hitting and wounding  an unarmed civilian, and sentenced by the lower court to one  year's imprisonment, but acquitted by the higher court as having  acted in \"supposed self-defence.\"    No less than three parties, the Centrum, the Progressives and  the Social Democrats, addressed interpellations to the Chancellor  "]]]
