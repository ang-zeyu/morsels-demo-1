And the maid, when  she saw he was ready, rained arrows upon him with art, and they fell  quick like hail, and whizzed about his head; and Sohrab, when he saw it,  could not defend himself, and was angry and ashamed. Then he covered his  head with his shield and ran at the maid. But she, when she saw him  approach, dropped her bow and couched a lance, and thrust at Sohrab with  vigour, and shook him mightily, and it wanted little and she would have  thrown him from his seat. And Sohrab was amazed, and his wrath knew no  bounds. Then he ran at Gurdafrid with fury, and seized the reins of her  steed, and caught her by the waist, and tore her armour, and threw her  upon the ground. Yet ere he could raise his hand to strike her, she drew  her sword and shivered his lance in twain, and leaped again upon her  steed. And when she saw that the day was hers, she was weary of further  combat, and she sped back unto the fortress. But Sohrab gave rein unto  his horse, and followed after her in his great anger. And he caught her,  and seized her, and tore the helmet off her head, for he desired to look  upon the face of the man who could withstand the son of Rustem. And lo!  when he had done so, there rolled forth from the helmet coils of dusky  hue, and Sohrab beheld it was a woman that had overcome him in the  fight. And he was confounded. But when he had found speech he said:    \"If the daughters of Iran are like to thee, and go forth unto battle,  none can stand against this land.\"    Then he took his cord and threw it about her, and bound her in its  snare, saying:    \"Seek not to escape me, O moon of beauty, for never hath prey like unto  thee fallen between my hands.\"    Then Gurdafrid, full of wile, turned unto him her face that was  unveiled, for she beheld no other means of safety, and she said unto  him:    \"O hero without flaw, is it well that thou shouldest seek to make me  captive, and show me unto the army? For they have beheld our combat, and  that I overcame thee, and surely now they will gibe when they learn that  thy strength was withstood by a woman. Better would it beseem thee to  hide this adventure, lest thy cheeks have cause to blush because of me.  Therefore let us conclude a peace together. The castle shall be thine,  and all it holds; follow after me then, and take possession of thine  own.\"    Now Sohrab, when he had listened, was beguiled by her words and her  beauty, and he said:    \"Thou dost wisely to make peace with me, for verily these walls could  not resist my might.\"    And he followed after her unto the heights of the castle, and he stood  with her before its gates. And Gustahem, when he saw them, opened the  portal, and Gurdafrid stepped within the threshold, but when Sohrab  would have followed after her she shut the door upon him. Then Sohrab  saw that she had befooled him, and his fury knew no bounds. But ere he  was recovered from his surprise she came out upon the battlements and  scoffed at him, and counselled him to go back whence he was come; for  surely, since he could not stand against a woman, he would fall an easy  prey before Rustem, when the Pehliva should have learned that robbers  from Turan were broken into the land. And Sohrab was made yet madder for  her words, and he departed from the walls in his wrath, and rode far in  his anger, and spread terror in his path. And he vowed that he would yet  bring the maid into subjection.    In the meantime Gustahem the aged called before him a scribe, and bade  him write unto Kai Kaous all that was come about, and how an army was  come forth from Turan, at whose head rode a chief that was a child in  years, a lion in strength and stature. And he told how Hujir had been  bound, and how the fortress was like to fall into the hands of the  enemy; for there were none to defend it save only his daughter and  himself and he craved the Shah to come to their aid.    Albeit when the day had followed yet again upon the night, Sohrab made  ready his host to fall upon the castle. But when he came near thereto he  found it was empty, and the doors thereof stood open, and no warriors  appeared upon its walls. And he was surprised, for he knew not that in  the darkness the inmates were fled by a passage that was hidden under  the earth. And he searched the building for Gurdafrid, for his heart  yearned after her in love and he cried aloud:    \"Woe, woe is me that this moon is vanished behind the clouds!\"    Now when Kai Kaous had gotten the writing of Gustahem, he was sore  afflicted and much afraid, and he called about him his nobles and asked  their counsels. And he said:    \"Who shall stand against this Turk? For Gustahem doth liken him in power  unto Rustem, and saith he resembleth the seed of Neriman.\"    Then the warriors cried with one accord, \"Unto Rustem alone can we look  in this danger!\"    And Kai Kaous hearkened to their voice, and he called for a scribe and  dictated unto him a letter. And he wrote unto his Pehliva, and invoked  the blessings of Heaven upon his head, and he told him all that was come  to pass, and how new dangers threatened Iran, and how to Rustem alone  could he look for help in his trouble. And he recalled unto Tehemten all  that he had done for him in the days that were gone by, and he entreated  him once again to be his refuge. And he said:    \"When thou shalt receive this letter, stay not to speak the word that  hangeth upon thy lips; and if thou bearest roses in thy hands, stop not  to smell them, but haste thee to help us in our need.\"    Then Kai Kaous sent forth Gew with this writing unto Zaboulistan, and  bade him neither rest nor tarry until he should stand before the face of  Rustem. And he said--    \"When thou hast done my behest, turn thee again unto me; neither abide  within the courts of the Pehliva, nor linger by the roadside.\"    And Gew did as the Shah commanded, and took neither food nor rest till  he set foot within the gates of Rustem. And Rustem greeted him kindly,  and asked him of his mission; and when he had read the writing of the  Shah, he questioned Gew concerning Sohrab. For he said:    \"I should not marvel if such an hero arose in Iran, but that a warrior  of renown should come forth from amid the Turks, I cannot believe it.  But thou sayest none knoweth whence cometh this knight. I have myself a  son in Samengan, but he is yet an infant, and his mother writeth to me  that he rejoiceth in the sports of his age, and though he be like to  become a hero among men, his time is not yet come to lead forth an army.  And that which thou sayest hath been done; surely it is not the work of  a babe. But enter, I pray thee, into my house, and we will confer  together concerning this adventure.\"    Then Rustem bade his cooks make ready a banquet, and he feasted Gew, and  troubled his head with wine, and caused him to forget cares and time.  But when morn was come Gew remembered the commands of the Shah that he  tarry not, but return with all speed, and he spake thereof to Rustem,  and prayed him to make known his resolve. But Rustem spake, saying:    \"Disquiet not thyself, for death will surely fall upon these men of  Turan. Stay with me yet another day and rest, and water thy lips that  are parched. For though this Sohrab be a hero like to Saum and Zal and  Neriman, verily he shall fall by my hands.\"    And he made ready yet another banquet, and three days they caroused  without ceasing. But on the fourth Gew uprose with resolve, and came  before Rustem girt for departure. And he said:    \"It behoveth me to return, O Pehliva, for I bethink me how Kai Kaous is  a man hard and choleric, and the fear of Sohrab weigheth upon his heart,  and his soul burneth with impatience, and he hath lost sleep, and hath  hunger and thirst on this account. And he will be wroth against us if we  delay yet longer to do his behest.\"    Then Rustem said, \"Fear not, for none on earth dare be angered with me.\"    But he did as Gew desired, and made ready his army, and saddled Rakush,  and set forth from Zaboulistan, and a great train followed after him.    Now when they came nigh unto the courts of the Shah, the nobles came  forth to meet them, and do homage before Rustem. And when they were come  in, Rustem gat him from Rakush and hastened into the presence of his  lord. But Kai Kaous, when he beheld him, was angry, and spake not, and  his brows were knit with fury; and when Rustem had done obeisance before  him, he unlocked the doors of his mouth, and words of folly escaped his  lips. And he said:    \"Who is Rustem, that he defieth my power and disregardeth my commands?  If I had a sword within my grasp I would spilt his head like to an  orange. Seize him, I command, and hang him upon the nearest gallows, and  let his name be never spoken in my presence.\"    When he heard these words Gew trembled in his heart, but he said, \"Dost  thou set forth thy hand against Rustem?\"    And the Shah when he heard it was beside himself, and he cried with a  loud voice that Gew be hanged together with the other; and he bade Tus  lead them forth. And Tus would have led them out, for he hoped the anger  of the Shah would be appeased; but Rustem broke from his grasp and stood  before Kai Kaous, and all the nobles were filled with fear when they saw  his anger. And he flung reproaches at Kai Kaous, and he recalled to him  his follies, and the march into Mazinderan and Hamaveran, and his flight  into Heaven; and he reminded him how that but for Rustem he would not  now be seated upon the throne of light. And he bade him threaten Sohrab  the Turk with his gallows, and he said:    \"I am a free man and no slave, and am servant alone unto God; and  without Rustem Kai Kaous is as nothing, And the world is subject unto  me, and Rakush is my throne, and my sword is my seal, and my helmet my  crown. And but for me, who called forth Kai Kobad, thine eyes had never  looked upon "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6628"],[0,"The Life, Crime, and Capture of John Wilkes Booth (#10)"],[1,"posts, and  between the road and the house, the lane was crossed by a second fence  and gate. The farm-house lane, passing the house front, kept straight on  to the barn, though a second carriage track ran up to the porch.    [Illustration: Plan of Garrett's House.    _A_ Door through which the dying man was brought. _B_ Corner at which  the barn was fired. _C_ Spot in the barn on which Booth stood. _D_ Point  where Corbett fired. _E_ Porch where Booth died. _G_ Door at which  Lieutenant Baker knocked. _H_ Shed. _I_ Kitchen.]    It was a homely and primitive scene enough, pastoral as any farm boy's  birth-place, and had been the seat of many toils and endearments. Young  wives had been brought to it, and around its hearth the earliest cries  of infants, gladdening mothers' hearts, had made the household jubilant  till the stars came out, and were its only sentries, save the bright  lights at its window-panes as of a camp-fire, and the suppressed  chorusses of the domestic bivouac within, where apple toasting and nut  cracking and country games shortened the winter shadows. Yet in this  house, so peaceful by moonlight, murder had washed its spotted hands,  and ministered to its satiated appetite. History--present in every nook  in the broad young world--had stopped, to make a landmark of Garrett's  farm.    In the dead stillness, Baker dismounted and forced the outer gate;  Conger kept close behind him, and the horsemen followed cautiously. They  made no noise in the soft clay, nor broke the all-foreboding silence  anywhere, till the second gate swung open gratingly, yet even then nor  hoarse nor shrill response came back, save distant croaking, as of frogs  or owls, or the whizz of some passing night-hawk. So they surrounded the  pleasant old homestead, each horseman, carbine in poise, adjusted under  the grove of locusts, so as to inclose the dwelling with a circle of  fire. After a pause, Baker rode to the kitchen door on the side, and  dismounting, rapped and halloed lustily. An old man, in drawers and  night-shirt, hastily undrew the bolts, and stood on the threshold,  peering shiveringly into the darkness.    Baker seized him by the throat at once, and held a pistol to his ear.  \"Who--who is it that calls me?\" cried the old man. \"Where are the men  who stay with you?\" challenged Baker. \"If you prevaricate you are a dead  man!\" The old fellow, who proved to be the head of the family, was so  overawed and paralysed that he stammered, and shook, and said not a  word. \"Go light a candle,\" cried Baker, sternly, \"and be quick about  it.\" The trembling old man obeyed, and in a moment the imperfect rays  flared upon his whitening hairs and bluishly pallid face. Then the  question was repeated, backed up by the glimmering pistol, \"where are  those men?\" The old man held to the wall, and his knees smote each  other. \"They are gone,\" he said. \"We hav'n't got them in the house, I  assure you that they are gone.\" Here there were sounds and whisperings  in the main building adjoining, and the lieutenant strode to the door. A  ludicrous instant intervened, the old man's modesty outran his terror.  \"Don't go in there,\" he said, feebly; \"there are women undressed in  there.\" \"Damn the women,\" cried Baker; \"what if they are undressed? We  shall go in if they haven't a rag.\" Leaving the old man in mute  astonishment, Baker bolted through the door, and stood in an assemblage  of bare arms and night robes. His loaded pistol disarmed modesty of its  delicacy and substituted therefor a seasonable terror. Here he repeated  his summons, and the half light of the candle gave to his face a more  than bandit ferocity. They all denied knowledge of the strangers'  whereabouts.    In the interim Conger had also entered, and while the household and its  invaders were thus in weird tableaux, a young man appeared, as if he had  risen from the ground. The muzzles of everybody turned upon him in a  second; but, while he blanched, he did not lose loquacity. \"Father,\" he  said, \"we had better tell the truth about the matter. Those men whom you  seek, gentlemen, are in the barn, I know. They went there to sleep.\"  Leaving one soldier to guard the old man--and the soldier was very glad  of the job, as it relieved him of personal hazard in the approaching  combat--all the rest, with cocked pistols at the young man's head,  followed on to the barn. It lay a hundred yards from the house, the  front barndoor facing the west gable, and was an old and spacious  structure, with floors only a trifle above the ground level.    The troops dismounted, were stationed at regular intervals around it,  and ten yards distant at every point, four special guards placed to  command the door and all with weapons in supple preparation, while Baker  and Conger went direct to the portal. It had a padlock upon it, and the  key of this Baker secured at once. In the interval of silence that  ensued, the rustling of planks and straw was heard inside, as of persons  rising from sleep.    At the same moment Baker hailed:    \"To the persons in this barn. I have a proposal to make; we are about to  send in to you the son of the man in whose custody you are found. Either  surrender to him your arms and then give yourselves up, or we'll set  fire to the place. We mean to take you both, or to have a bonfire and a  shooting match.\"    No answer came to this of any kind. The lad, John M. Garrett, who was in  deadly fear, was here pushed through the door by a sudden opening of it,  and immediately Lieutenant Baker locked the door on the outside. The boy  was heard to state his appeal in under tone. Booth replied:    \"Damn you. Get out of here. You have betrayed me.\"    At the same time he placed his hand in his pocket as for a pistol. A  remonstrance followed, but the boy slipped quickly over the reopened  portal, reporting that his errand had failed, and that he dared not  enter again. All this time the candle brought from the house to the barn  was burning close beside the two detectives, rendering it easy for any  one within to have shot them dead. This observed, the light was  cautiously removed, and everybody took care to keep out of its  reflection. By this time the crisis of the position was at hand, the  cavalry exhibited very variable inclinations, some to run away, others  to shoot Booth without a summons, but all excited and fitfully silent.  At the house near by the female folks were seen collected in the  doorway, and the necessities of the case provoked prompt conclusions.  The boy was placed at a remote point, and the summons repeated by Baker:    \"You must surrender inside there. Give up your arms and appear. There is  no chance for escape. We give you five minutes to make up your mind.\"    A bold, clarion reply came from within, so strong as to be heard at the  house door:    \"Who are you, and what do you want with us?\"    Baker again urged: \"We want you to deliver up your arms and become our  prisoners.\"    \"But who are you?\" hallooed the same strong voice.    Baker.--\"That makes no difference. We know who you are, and we want you.  We have here fifty men, armed with carbines and pistols. You cannot  escape.\"    There was a long pause, and then Booth said:    \"Captain, this is a hard case, I swear. Perhaps I am being taken by my  own friends.\" No reply from the detectives.    Booth--\"Well, give us a little time to consider.\"    [Illustration: Garrett's House, Where Booth Died--Sketched by W. N.  Walton, for \"Harper's Weekly\" for May 30th, 1865]    Baker--\"Very well. Take time.\"    Here ensued a long and eventful pause. What thronging memories it  brought to Booth, we can only guess. In this little interval he made the  resolve to die. But he was cool and steady to the end. Baker, after a  lapse, hailed for the last time.    \"Well, we have waited long enough; surrender your arms and come out, or  we'll fire the barn.\"    Booth answered thus: \"I am but a cripple, a one-legged man. Withdraw  your forces one hundred yard from the door, and I will come. Give me a  chance for my life, captain. I will never be taken alive.\"    Baker--\"We did not come here to fight, but to capture you. I say again,  appear, or the barn shall be fired.\"    Then with a long breath, which could be heard outside, Booth cried in  sudden calmness, still invisible, as were to him his enemies:    \"Well, then, my brave boys, prepare a stretcher for me.\"    There was a pause repeated, broken by low discussions within between  Booth and his associate, the former saying, as if in answer to some  remonstrance or appeal, \"Get away from me. You are a damned coward, and  mean to leave me in my distress; but go, go. I don't want you to stay. I  won't have _you_ stay.\" Then he shouted aloud:    \"There's a man inside who wants to surrender.\"    Baker--\"Let him come, if he will bring his arms.\"    Here Harold, rattling at the door, said: \"Let me out; open the door; I  want to surrender.\"    Baker--\"Hand out your arms, then.\"    Harold--\"I have not got any.\"    Baker--\"You are the man that carried the carbine yesterday; bring it  out.\"    Harold--\"I haven't got any.\"    This was said in a whining tone, and with an almost visible shiver.  Booth cried aloud, at this hesitation: \"He hasn't got any arms; they are  mine, and I have kept them.\"    Baker--\"Well, he carried the carbine, and must bring it out.\"    Booth--\"On the word and honor of a gentleman, he has no arms with him.  They are mine, and I have got them.\"    At this time Harold was quite up to the door, within whispering distance  of Baker. The latter told him to put out his hands to be handcuffed, at  the same time drawing open the door a little distance. Harold thrust  forth his hands, when Baker, seizing him, jerked him into the night, and  straightway delivered him over to a deputation of cavalrymen. The fellow  began to talk of his innocence and plead so noisily that Conger  threatened to gag him unless he ceased. Then Booth made his last"]]]
