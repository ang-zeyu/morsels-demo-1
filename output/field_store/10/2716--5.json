What influence this plea  had on General Wade, we have no means of knowing.    Rob Roy appears to have continued to live very much as usual. His fame,  in the meanwhile, passed beyond the narrow limits of the country in which  he resided. A pretended history of him appeared in London during his  lifetime, under the title of the Highland Rogue. It is a catch-penny  publication, bearing in front the effigy of a species of ogre, with a  beard of a foot in length; and his actions are as much exaggerated as his  personal appearance. Some few of the best known adventures of the hero  are told, though with little accuracy; but the greater part of the  pamphlet is entirely fictitious. It is great pity so excellent a theme  for a narrative of the kind had not fallen into the hands of De Foe, who  was engaged at the time on subjects somewhat similar, though inferior in  dignity and interest.    As Rob Roy advanced in years, he became more peaceable in his habits, and  his nephew Ghlune Dhu, with most of his tribe, renounced those peculiar  quarrels with the Duke of Montrose, by which his uncle had been  distinguished. The policy of that great family had latterly been rather  to attach this wild tribe by kindness than to follow the mode of violence  which had been hitherto ineffectually resorted to. Leases at a low rent  were granted to many of the MacGregors, who had heretofore held  possessions in the Duke's Highland property merely by occupancy; and  Glengyle (or Black-knee), who continued to act as collector of  black-mail, managed his police, as a commander of the Highland watch  arrayed at the charge of Government. He is said to have strictly  abstained from the open and lawless depredations which his kinsman had  practised.    It was probably after this state of temporary quiet had been obtained,  that Rob Roy began to think of the concerns of his future state. He had  been bred, and long professed himself, a Protestant; but in his later  years he embraced the Roman Catholic faith,--perhaps on Mrs. Cole's  principle, that it was a comfortable religion for one of his calling. He  is said to have alleged as the cause of his conversion, a desire to  gratify the noble family of Perth, who were then strict Catholics.  Having, as he observed, assumed the name of the Duke of Argyle, his first  protector, he could pay no compliment worth the Earl of Perth's  acceptance save complying with his mode of religion. Rob did not pretend,  when pressed closely on the subject, to justify all the tenets of  Catholicism, and acknowledged that extreme unction always appeared to him  a great waste of _ulzie,_ or oil.*    * Such an admission is ascribed to the robber Donald Bean Lean in  Waverley, chap. lxii,    In the last years of Rob Roy's life, his clan was involved in a dispute  with one more powerful than themselves. Stewart of Appin, a chief of the  tribe so named, was proprietor of a hill-farm in the Braes of  Balquhidder, called Invernenty. The MacGregors of Rob Roy's tribe claimed  a right to it by ancient occupancy, and declared they would oppose to the  uttermost the settlement of any person upon the farm not being of their  own name. The Stewarts came down with two hundred men, well armed, to do  themselves justice by main force. The MacGregors took the field, but were  unable to muster an equal strength. Rob Roy, fending himself the weaker  party, asked a parley, in which he represented that both clans were  friends to the _King,_ and, that he was unwilling they should be weakened  by mutual conflict, and thus made a merit of surrendering to Appin the  disputed territory of Invernenty. Appin, accordingly, settled as tenants  there, at an easy quit-rent, the MacLarens, a family dependent on the  Stewarts, and from whose character for strength and bravery, it was  expected that they would make their right good if annoyed by the  MacGregors. When all this had been amicably adjusted, in presence of the  two clans drawn up in arms near the Kirk of Balquhidder, Rob Roy,  apparently fearing his tribe might be thought to have conceded too much  upon the occasion, stepped forward and said, that where so many gallant  men were met in arms, it would be shameful to part without it trial of  skill, and therefore he took the freedom to invite any gentleman of the  Stewarts present to exchange a few blows with him for the honour of their  respective clans. The brother-in-law of Appin, and second chieftain of  the clan, Alaster Stewart of Invernahyle, accepted the challenge, and  they encountered with broadsword and target before their respective  kinsmen.*    * Some accounts state that Appin himself was Rob Roy's antagonist on this  occasion. My recollection, from the account of Invernahyle himself, was  as stated in the text. But the period when I received the information is  now so distant, that it is possible I may be mistaken. Invernahyle was  rather of low stature, but very well made, athletic, and an excellent  swordsman.    The combat lasted till Rob received a slight wound in the arm, which was  the usual termination of such a combat when fought for honour only, and  not with a mortal purpose. Rob Roy dropped his point, and congratulated  his adversary on having been the first man who ever drew blood from him.  The victor generously acknowledged, that without the advantage of youth,  and the agility accompanying it, he probably could not have come off with  advantage.    This was probably one of Rob Roy's last exploits in arms. The time of his  death is not known with certainty, but he is generally said to have  survived 1738, and to have died an aged man. When he found himself  approaching his final change, he expressed some contrition for particular  parts of his life. His wife laughed at these scruples of conscience, and  exhorted him to die like a man, as he had lived. In reply, he rebuked her  for her violent passions, and the counsels she had given him. \"You have  put strife,\" he said, \"betwixt me and the best men of the country, and  now you would place enmity between me and my God.\"    There is a tradition, no way inconsistent with the former, if the  character of Rob Roy be justly considered, that while on his deathbed, he  learned that a person with whom he was at enmity proposed to visit him.  \"Raise me from my bed,\" said the invalid; \"throw my plaid around me, and  bring me my claymore, dirk, and pistols--it shall never be said that a  foeman saw Rob Roy MacGregor defenceless and unarmed.\" His foeman,  conjectured to be one of the MacLarens before and after mentioned,  entered and paid his compliments, inquiring after the health of his  formidable neighbour. Rob Roy maintained a cold haughty civility during  their short conference, and so soon as he had left the house. \"Now,\" he  said, \"all is over--let the piper play, _Ha til mi tulidh_\" (we return no  more); and he is said to have expired before the dirge was finished.    This singular man died in bed in his own house, in the parish of  Balquhidder. He was buried in the churchyard of the same parish, where  his tombstone is only distinguished by a rude attempt at the figure of a  broadsword.    The character of Rob Roy is, of course, a mixed one. His sagacity,  boldness, and prudence, qualities so highly necessary to success in war,  became in some degree vices, from the manner in which they were employed.  The circumstances of his education, however, must be admitted as some  extenuation of his habitual transgressions against the law; and for his  political tergiversations, he might in that distracted period plead the  example of men far more powerful, and less excusable in becoming the  sport of circumstances, than the poor and desperate outlaw. On the other  hand, he was in the constant exercise of virtues, the more meritorious as  they seem inconsistent with his general character. Pursuing the  occupation of a predatory chieftain,--in modern phrase a captain of  banditti,--Rob Roy was moderate in his revenge, and humane in his  successes. No charge of cruelty or bloodshed, unless in battle, is  brought against his memory. In like manner, the formidable outlaw was the  friend of the poor, and, to the utmost of his ability, the support of the  widow and the orphan--kept his word when pledged--and died lamented in  his own wild country, where there were hearts grateful for his  beneficence, though their minds were not sufficiently instructed to  appreciate his errors.    The author perhaps ought to stop here; but the fate of a part of Rob  Roy's family was so extraordinary, as to call for a continuation of this  somewhat prolix account, as affording an interesting chapter, not on  Highland manners alone, but on every stage of society in which the people  of a primitive and half-civilised tribe are brought into close contact  with a nation, in which civilisation and polity have attained a complete  superiority.    Rob had five sons,--Coll, Ronald, James, Duncan, and Robert. Nothing  occurs worth notice concerning three of them; but James, who was a very  handsome man, seems to have had a good deal of his father's spirit, and  the mantle of Dougal Ciar Mhor had apparently descended on the shoulders  of Robin Oig, that is, young Robin. Shortly after Rob Roy's death, the  ill-will which the MacGregors entertained against the MacLarens again  broke out, at the instigation, it was said, of Rob's widow, who seems  thus far to have deserved the character given to her by her husband, as  an Ate' stirring up to blood and strife. Robin Oig, under her  instigation, swore that as soon as he could get back a certain gun which  had belonged to his father, and had been lately at Doune to be repaired,  he would shoot MacLaren, for having presumed to settle on his mother's  land.*    * This fatal piece was taken from Robin Oig, when he was seized many  years afterwards.
