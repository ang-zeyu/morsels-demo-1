This  last is what the authors of the _Cypria_ and _Little_ _Iliad_ have  done. And the result is that, whereas the _Iliad_ or _Odyssey_ supplies  materials for only one, or at most two tragedies, the _Cypria_ does  that for several, and the _Little_ _Iliad_ for more than eight: for an  _Adjudgment of Arms_, a _Philoctetes_, a _Neoptolemus_, a _Eurypylus_,  a _Ulysses as Beggar_, a _Laconian Women_, a _Fall of Ilium_, and a  _Departure of the Fleet_; as also a _Sinon_, and _Women of Troy_.          24      II. Besides this, Epic poetry must divide into the same species as  Tragedy; it must be either simple or complex, a story of character  or one of suffering. Its parts, too, with the exception of Song and  Spectacle, must be the same, as it requires Peripeties, Discoveries, and  scenes of suffering just like Tragedy. Lastly, the Thought and Diction  in it must be good in their way. All these elements appear in Homer  first; and he has made due use of them. His two poems are each examples  of construction, the _Iliad_ simple and a story of suffering, the  _Odyssey_ complex (there is Discovery throughout it) and a story of  character. And they are more than this, since in Diction and Thought too  they surpass all other poems.    There is, however, a difference in the Epic as compared with Tragedy,  (1) in its length, and (2) in its metre. (1) As to its length, the limit  already suggested will suffice: it must be possible for the beginning  and end of the work to be taken in in one view--a condition which will  be fulfilled if the poem be shorter than the old epics, and about  as long as the series of tragedies offered for one hearing. For the  extension of its length epic poetry has a special advantage, of which it  makes large use. In a play one cannot represent an action with a number  of parts going on simultaneously; one is limited to the part on the  stage and connected with the actors. Whereas in epic poetry the narrative  form makes it possible for one to describe a number of simultaneous  incidents; and these, if germane to the subject, increase the body of  the poem. This then is a gain to the Epic, tending to give it grandeur,  and also variety of interest and room for episodes of diverse kinds.  Uniformity of incident by the satiety it soon creates is apt to ruin  tragedies on the stage. (2) As for its metre, the heroic has been  assigned it from experience; were any one to attempt a narrative poem  in some one, or in several, of the other metres, the incongruity of  the thing would be apparent. The heroic; in fact is the gravest and  weightiest of metres--which is what makes it more tolerant than the rest  of strange words and metaphors, that also being a point in which  the narrative form of poetry goes beyond all others. The iambic  and trochaic, on the other hand, are metres of movement, the one  representing that of life and action, the other that of the dance. Still  more unnatural would it appear, it one were to write an epic in a medley  of metres, as Chaeremon did. Hence it is that no one has ever written  a long story in any but heroic verse; nature herself, as we have said,  teaches us to select the metre appropriate to such a story.    Homer, admirable as he is in every other respect, is especially so in  this, that he alone among epic poets is not unaware of the part to be  played by the poet himself in the poem. The poet should say very little  in propria persona, as he is no imitator when doing that. Whereas  the other poets are perpetually coming forward in person, and say but  little, and that only here and there, as imitators, Homer after a brief  preface brings in forthwith a man, a woman, or some other Character--no  one of them characterless, but each with distinctive characteristics.    The marvellous is certainly required in Tragedy. The Epic, however,  affords more opening for the improbable, the chief factor in the  marvellous, because in it the agents are not visibly before one. The  scene of the pursuit of Hector would be ridiculous on the stage--the  Greeks halting instead of pursuing him, and Achilles shaking his head to  stop them; but in the poem the absurdity is overlooked. The marvellous,  however, is a cause of pleasure, as is shown by the fact that we all  tell a story with additions, in the belief that we are doing our hearers  a pleasure.    Homer more than any other has taught the rest of us the art of framing  lies in the right way. I mean the use of paralogism. Whenever, if A is  or happens, a consequent, B, is or happens, men's notion is that, if the  B is, the A also is--but that is a false conclusion. Accordingly, if A  is untrue, but there is something else, B, that on the assumption of its  truth follows as its consequent, the right thing then is to add on the  B. Just because we know the truth of the consequent, we are in our own  minds led on to the erroneous inference of the truth of the antecedent.  Here is an instance, from the Bath-story in the _Odyssey_.    A likely impossibility is always preferable to an unconvincing  possibility. The story should never be made up of improbable incidents;  there should be nothing of the sort in it. If, however, such incidents  are unavoidable, they should be outside the piece, like the hero's  ignorance in _Oedipus_ of the circumstances of Lams' death; not within  it, like the report of the Pythian games in _Electra_, or the man's  having come to Mysia from Tegea without uttering a word on the way, in  _The Mysians_. So that it is ridiculous to say that one's Plot would  have been spoilt without them, since it is fundamentally wrong to make  up such Plots. If the poet has taken such a Plot, however, and one  sees that he might have put it in a more probable form, he is guilty  of absurdity as well as a fault of art. Even in the _Odyssey_ the  improbabilities in the setting-ashore of Ulysses would be clearly  intolerable in the hands of an inferior poet. As it is, the poet  conceals them, his other excellences veiling their absurdity. Elaborate  Diction, however, is required only in places where there is no action,  and no Character or Thought to be revealed. Where there is Character  or Thought, on the other hand, an over-ornate Diction tends to obscure  them.          25      As regards Problems and their Solutions, one may see the number and  nature of the assumptions on which they proceed by viewing the matter in  the following way. (1) The poet being an imitator just like the painter  or other maker of likenesses, he must necessarily in all instances  represent things in one or other of three aspects, either as they were  or are, or as they are said or thought to be or to have been, or as they  ought to be. (2) All this he does in language, with an admixture, it  may be, of strange words and metaphors, as also of the various modified  forms of words, since the use of these is conceded in poetry. (3) It is  to be remembered, too, that there is not the same kind of correctness  in poetry as in politics, or indeed any other art. There is, however,  within the limits of poetry itself a possibility of two kinds of error,  the one directly, the other only accidentally connected with the art. If  the poet meant to describe the thing correctly, and failed through  lack of power of expression, his art itself is at fault. But if it was  through his having meant to describe it in some incorrect way (e.g. to  make the horse in movement have both right legs thrown forward) that the  technical error (one in a matter of, say, medicine or some other special  science), or impossibilities of whatever kind they may be, have got into  his description, his error in that case is not in the essentials of the  poetic art. These, therefore, must be the premisses of the Solutions in  answer to the criticisms involved in the Problems.    I. As to the criticisms relating to the poet's art itself. Any  impossibilities there may be in his descriptions of things are faults.  But from another point of view they are justifiable, if they serve the  end of poetry itself--if (to assume what we have said of that end) they  make the effect of some portion of the work more astounding. The Pursuit  of Hector is an instance in point. If, however, the poetic end might  have been as well or better attained without sacrifice of technical  correctness in such matters, the impossibility is not to be justified,  since the description should be, if it can, entirely free from error.  One may ask, too, whether the error is in a matter directly or only  accidentally connected with the poetic art; since it is a lesser error  in an artist not to know, for instance, that the hind has no horns, than  to produce an unrecognizable picture of one.    II. If the poet's description be criticized as not true to fact, one may  urge perhaps that the object ought to be as described--an answer like  that of Sophocles, who said that he drew men as they ought to be, and  Euripides as they were. If the description, however, be neither true nor  of the thing as it ought to be, the answer must be then, that it is in  accordance with opinion. The tales about Gods, for instance, may be as  wrong as Xenophanes thinks, neither true nor the better thing to say;  but they are certainly in accordance with opinion. Of other statements  in poetry one may perhaps say, not that they are better than the truth,  but that the fact was so at the time; e.g. the description of the arms:  'their spears stood upright, butt-end upon the ground'; for that was the  usual way of fixing them then, as it is still with the Illyrians. As for  the question whether something said or done in a poem is morally right  or not, in dealing with that one should consider not only the intrinsic  quality of the actual word or deed, but also the person who says or does  it, the person to whom he says or does it, the time, the means, and the  motive of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6764"],[0,"Army Life in a Black Regiment (#10)"],[1,"their woes. Twenty-four hours have passed, and I  hear them singing most merrily all down that company street.    I often notice how their griefs may be dispelled, like those of  children, merely by permission to utter them: if they can tell their  sorrows, they go away happy, even without asking to have anything done  about them. I observe also a peculiar dislike of all _intermediate_  control: they always wish to pass by the company officer, and deal with  me personally for everything. General Saxton notices the same thing  with the people on the plantations as regards himself. I suppose this  proceeds partly from the old habit of appealing to the master against  the overseer. Kind words would cost the master nothing, and he could  easily put off any non-fulfilment upon the overseer. Moreover, the  negroes have acquired such constitutional distrust of white people, that  it is perhaps as much as they can do to trust more than one person at  a tune. Meanwhile this constant personal intercourse is out of the  question in a well-ordered regiment; and the remedy for it is to  introduce by degrees more and more of system, so that their immediate  officers will become all-sufficient for the daily routine.    It is perfectly true (as I find everybody takes for granted) that  the first essential for an officer of colored troops is to gain  their confidence. But it is equally true, though many persons do not  appreciate it, that the admirable methods and proprieties of the regular  army are equally available for all troops, and that the sublimest  philanthropist, if he does not appreciate this, is unfit to command  them.    Another childlike attribute in these men, which is less agreeable, is a  sort of blunt insensibility to giving physical pain. If they are cruel  to animals, for instance, it always reminds me of children pulling off  flies' legs, in a sort of pitiless, untaught, experimental way. Yet I  should not fear any wanton outrage from them. After all their wrongs,  they are not really revengeful; and I would far rather enter a  captured city with them than with white troops, for they would be more  subordinate. But for mere physical suffering they would have no fine  sympathies. The cruel things they have seen and undergone have helped to  blunt them; and if I ordered them to put to death a dozen prisoners, I  think they would do it without remonstrance.    Yet their religious spirit grows more beautiful to me in living longer  with them; it is certainly far more so than at first, when it seemed  rather a matter of phrase and habit. It influences them both on the  negative and the positive side. That is, it cultivates the feminine  virtues first,--makes them patient, meek, resigned. This is very evident  in the hospital; there is nothing of the restless, defiant habit of  white invalids. Perhaps, if they had more of this, they would resist  disease better. Imbued from childhood with the habit of submission,  drinking in through every pore that other-world trust which is the one  spirit of their songs, they can endure everything. This I expected;  but I am relieved to find that their religion strengthens them on the  positive side also,--gives zeal, energy, daring. They could easily be  made fanatics, if I chose; but I do not choose. Their whole mood is  essentially Mohammedan, perhaps, in its strength and its weakness; and  I feel the same degree of sympathy that I should if I had a Turkish  command,--that is, a sort of sympathetic admiration, not tending towards  agreement, but towards co-operation. Their philosophizing is often the  highest form of mysticism; and our dear surgeon declares that they are  all natural transcendentalists. The white camps seem rough and secular,  after this; and I hear our men talk about \"a religious army,\" \"a Gospel  army,\" in their prayer-meetings. They are certainly evangelizing the  chaplain, who was rather a heretic at the beginning; at least, this is  his own admission. We have recruits on their way from St. Augustine,  where the negroes are chiefly Roman Catholics; and it will be  interesting to see how their type of character combines with that elder  creed. It is time for rest; and I have just looked out into the night,  where the eternal stars shut down, in concave protection, over the yet  glimmering camp, and Orion hangs above my tent-door, giving to me the  sense of strength and assurance which these simple children obtain from  their Moses and the Prophets. Yet external Nature does its share in  their training; witness that most poetic of all their songs, which  always reminds me of the \"Lyke-Wake Dirge\" in the \"Scottish Border  Minstrelsy,\"--      \"I know moon-rise, I know star-rise;      Lay dis body down.    I walk in de moonlight, I walk in de starlight,      To lay dis body down.    I'll walk in de graveyard, I'll walk through de graveyard,      To lay dis body down.    I'll lie in de grave and stretch out my arms;      Lay dis body down.    I go to de Judgment in de evening ob de day      When I lay dis body down;    And my soul and your soul will meet in de day      When I lay dis body down.\"      January 14.    In speaking of the military qualities of the blacks, I should add, that  the only point where I am disappointed is one I have never seen raised  by the most incredulous newspaper critics,--namely, their  physical condition. To be sure they often look magnificently to  my gymnasium-trained eye; and I always like to observe them when  bathing,--such splendid muscular development, set off by that smooth  coating of adipose tissue which makes them, like the South-Sea Islanders  appear even more muscular than they are. Their skins are also of finer  grain than those of whites, the surgeons say, and certainly are smoother  and far more free from hair. But their weakness is pulmonary; pneumonia  and pleurisy are their besetting ailments; they are easily made  ill,--and easily cured, if promptly treated: childish organizations  again. Guard-duty injures them more than whites, apparently; and  double-quick movements, in choking dust, set them coughing badly. But  then it is to be remembered that this is their sickly season, from  January to March, and that their healthy season will come in summer,  when the whites break down. Still my conviction of the physical  superiority of more highly civilized races is strengthened on the whole,  not weakened, by observing them. As to availability for military drill  and duty in other respects, the only question I ever hear debated among  the officers is, whether they are equal or superior to whites. I have  never heard it suggested that they were inferior, although I expected  frequently to hear such complaints from hasty or unsuccessful officers.    Of one thing I am sure, that their best qualities will be wasted by  merely keeping them for garrison duty. They seem peculiarly fitted for  offensive operations, and especially for partisan warfare; they have so  much dash and such abundant resources, combined with such an Indian-like  knowledge of the country and its ways. These traits have been often  illustrated in expeditions sent after deserters. For instance, I  despatched one of my best lieutenants and my best sergeant with a squad  of men to search a certain plantation, where there were two separate  negro villages. They went by night, and the force was divided. The  lieutenant took one set of huts, the sergeant the other. Before the  lieutenant had reached his first house, every man in the village was  in the woods, innocent and guilty alike. But the sergeant's mode of  operation was thus described by a corporal from a white regiment who  happened to be in one of the negro houses. He said that not a sound was  heard until suddenly a red leg appeared in the open doorway, and a voice  outside said, \"Rally.\" Going to the door, he observed a similar pair of  red legs before every hut, and not a person was allowed to go out,  until the quarters had been thoroughly searched, and the three deserters  found. This was managed by Sergeant Prince Rivers, our color-sergeant,  who is provost-sergeant also, and has entire charge of the prisoners  and of the daily policing of the camp. He is a man of distinguished  appearance, and in old times was the crack coachman of Beaufort,  in which capacity he once drove Beauregard from this plantation to  Charleston, I believe. They tell me that he was once allowed to present  a petition to the Governor of South Carolina in behalf of slaves, for  the redress of certain grievances; and that a placard, offering two  thousand dollars for his recapture, is still to be seen by the wayside  between here and Charleston. He was a sergeant in the old \"Hunter  Regiment,\" and was taken by General Hunter to New York last spring,  where the _chevrons_ on his arm brought a mob upon him in Broadway, whom  he kept off till the police interfered. There is not a white officer  in this regiment who has more administrative ability, or more absolute  authority over the men; they do not love him, but his mere presence has  controlling power over them. He writes well enough to prepare for me  a daily report of his duties in the camp; if his education reached a  higher point, I see no reason why he should not command the Army of the  Potomac. He is jet-black, or rather, I should say, _wine-black_; his  complexion, like that of others of my darkest men, having a sort of  rich, clear depth, without a trace of sootiness, and to my eye very  handsome. His features are tolerably regular, and full of command, and  his figure superior to that of any of our white officers,--being six  feet high, perfectly proportioned, and of apparently inexhaustible  strength and activity. His gait is like a panther's; I never saw such a  tread. No anti-slavery novel has described a man of such marked ability.  He makes Toussaint perfectly intelligible; and if there should ever be a  black monarchy in South Carolina, he"]]]
