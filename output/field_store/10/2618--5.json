The country  consisted chiefly of open sandhills well grassed. I mentioned  previously that from Port Augusta, northwards and north-westwards, the  whole region consists of an open stony plateau, upon which mountain  ranges stand at various distances; through and from these, a number of  watercourses run, and, on a section of this plateau, nearly 200 miles  in extent, the curious mound-springs exist. This formation, mostly of  limestone, ceases at, or immediately before reaching, the Finke, and  then a formation of heavy red sandhills begins. Next day our friends  departed for the Charlotte, after making me several presents. From Mr.  McMinn I obtained the course and distance of the pillar from our camp,  and travelling on the course given, we crossed the Finke three times,  as it wound about so snake-like across the country. On the 22nd we  encamped upon it, having the pillar in full view.    (ILLUSTRATION: THE Moloch horridus.)    The appearance of this feature I should imagine to be unique. For a  detailed account of it my reader must consult Stuart's report.  Approaching the pillar from the south, the traveller must pass over a  series of red sandhills, covered with some scrubs, and clothed near  the ground with that abominable vegetable production, the so-called  spinifex or porcupine grass--botanically, the Triodia, or Festuca  irritans. The timber on the sandhills near the pillar is nearly all  mulga, a very hard acacia, though a few tall and well-grown  casuarinas--of a kind that is new to me, namely the C.  Decaisneana--are occasionally met. (These trees have almost a  palm-like appearance, and look like huge mops; but they grow in the  driest regions.) On our route Mr. Carmichael brought to me a most  peculiar little lizard, a true native of the soil; its colour was a  yellowish-green; it was armed, or ornamented, at points and joints,  with spines, in a row along its back, sides, and legs; these were  curved, and almost sharp; on the back of its neck was a thick knotty  lump, with a spine at each side, by which I lifted it; its tail was  armed with spines to the point, and was of proportional length to its  body. The lizard was about eight inches in length. Naturalists have  christened this harmless little chameleon the Moloch horridus. I put  the little creature in a pouch, and intended to preserve it, but it  managed to crawl out of its receptacle, and dropped again to its  native sand. I had one of these lizards, as a pet, for months in  Melbourne. It was finally trodden on and died. It used to eat sugar.    By this time we were close to the pillar: its outline was most  imposing. Upon reaching it, I found it to be a columnar structure,  standing upon a pedestal, which is perhaps eighty feet high, and  composed of loose white sandstone, having vast numbers of large blocks  lying about in all directions. From the centre of the pedestal rises  the pillar, composed also of the same kind of rock; at its top, and  for twenty to thirty feet from its summit, the colour of the stone is  red. The column itself must be seventy or eighty feet above the  pedestal. It is split at the top into two points. There it stands, a  vast monument of the geological periods that must have elapsed since  the mountain ridge, of which it was formerly a part, was washed by the  action of old Ocean's waves into mere sandhills at its feet. The stone  is so friable that names can be cut in it to almost any depth with a  pocket-knife: so loose, indeed, is it, that one almost feels alarmed  lest it should fall while he is scratching at its base. In a small  orifice or chamber of the pillar I discovered an opossum asleep, the  first I had seen in this part of the country. We turned our backs upon  this peculiar monument, and left it in its loneliness and its  grandeur--\"clothed in white sandstone, mystic, wonderful!\"    From hence we travelled nearly west, and in seventeen miles came to  some very high sandhills, at whose feet the river swept. We followed  round them to a convenient spot, and one where our horses could water  without bogging. The bed of the Finke is the most boggy creek-channel  I have ever met. As we had travelled several miles in the morning to  the pillar, and camped eighteen beyond it, it was late in the  afternoon when we encamped. The country we passed over was mostly  scrubby sandhills, covered with porcupine grass. Where we struck the  channel there was a long hole of brine. There was plenty of good grass  on the river flat; and we got some tolerably good water where we fixed  our camp. When we had finished our evening meal, the shades of night  descended upon us, in this our first bivouac in the unknown interior.  By observations of the bright stars Vega and Altair, I found my  latitude was 24 degrees 52' 15\"; the night was excessively cold, and  by daylight next morning the thermometer had fallen to 18 degrees. Our  blankets and packs were covered with a thick coating of ice; and tea  left in our pannikins overnight had become solid cakes.    The country here being soft and sandy, we unshod all the horses and  carried the shoes. So far as I could discern with the glasses, the  river channel came from the west, but I decided to go north-west, as I  was sure it would turn more northerly in time; and I dreaded being  caught in a long bend, and having to turn back many miles, or chance  the loss of some or all the horses in a boggy crossing. To the south a  line of hills appeared, where the natives were burning the spinifex in  all directions. These hills had the appearance of red sandstone; and  they had a series of ancient ocean watermarks along their northern  face, traceable for miles. This I called Johnstone's Range. As another  night approached, we could see, to the north, the brilliant flames of  large grass fires, which had only recently been started by some  prowling sons of the soil, upon their becoming aware of our presence  in their domain. The nights now were usually very cold. One night some  wild man or beast must have been prowling around our camp, for my  little dog Monkey exhibited signs of great perturbation for several  hours. We kept awake, listening for some sounds that might give us an  idea of the intruders; and being sure that we heard the tones of human  voices, we got our rifles in readiness. The little dog barked still  more furiously, but the sounds departed: we heard them no more: and  the rest of the night passed in silence--in silence and beautiful  rest.    We had not yet even sighted the Finke, upon my north-west course; but  I determined to continue, and was rewarded by coming suddenly upon it  under the foot of high sandhills. Its course now was a good deal to  the north. The horses being heavily packed, and the spinifex  distressing them so much, we found a convenient spot where the animals  could water without bogging, and camped. Hard by, were some clumps of  the fine-looking casuarinas; they grow to a height of twenty to  twenty-five feet of barrel without a branch, and then spread out to a  fine umbrella top; they flourish out of pure red sand. The large sheet  of water at the camp had wild ducks on it: some of these we shot. The  day was very agreeable, with cool breezes from the north-west. A  tributary joins the Finke here from the west, and a high dark hill  forms its southern embankment: the western horizon is bounded by  broken lines of hills, of no great elevation. As we ascend the river,  the country gradually rises, and we are here about 250 feet above the  level of the Charlotte Waters Station.    Finding the river now trended not only northerly, but even east of  north, we had to go in that direction, passing over some very high  sandhills, where we met the Finke at almost right angles. Although the  country was quite open, it was impossible to see the river channel,  even though fringed with rows of splendid gum-trees, for any distance,  as it became hidden by the high sandhills. I was very reluctant to  cross, on account of the frightfully boggy bed of the creek, but,  rather than travel several miles roundabout, I decided to try it. We  got over, certainly, but to see one's horses and loads sinking bodily  in a mass of quaking quicksand is by no means an agreeable sight, and  it was only by urging the animals on with stock-whips, to prevent them  delaying, that we accomplished the crossing without loss. Our riding  horses got the worst of it, as the bed was so fearfully ploughed up by  the pack-horses ahead of them. The whole bed of this peculiar creek  appears to be a quicksand, and when I say it was nearly a quarter of a  mile wide, its formidable nature will be understood. Here a stream of  slightly brackish water was trickling down the bed in a much narrower  channel, however, than its whole width; and where the water appears  upon the surface, there the bog is most to be apprehended. Sometimes  it runs under one bank, sometimes under the opposite, and again, at  other places the water occupies the mid-channel. A horse may walk upon  apparently firm sand towards the stream, when, without a second's  warning, horse and rider may be engulfed in quicksand; but in other  places, where it is firmer, it will quake for yards all round, and  thus give some slight warning.    Crossing safely, and now having the river on my right hand, we  continued our journey, sighting a continuous range of hills to the  north, which ran east and west, and with the glasses I could see the  river trending towards them. I changed my course for a conspicuous  hill in this new line, which brought me to the river again at right  angles; and, having so successfully crossed in the morning, I decided  to try it again. We descended to the bank, and after great trouble  found a spot firm enough and large enough to allow all the horses to  stand upon it at one time, but we could not find a place where they  could climb "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4975"],[0,"Spinifex and Sand (#10)"],[1,"or fifty men, though others were  daily arriving. These were the first white men we had seen for seven  weeks, and they were greatly astonished to see us, when they learnt what  direction we had come from.    Here were gathered together men from Coolgardie and Murchison, attracted  by the tales of wealth brought by the first prospectors of the new rush.  Some of them had been longer away from civilisation than we had, and many  arguments were held as to the correct date. Of course I knew, because I  kept a diary; but the Queen's Birthday was celebrated by us on the wrong  day after all, for I had given April thirty-one days! We heard that  hundreds had started for the rush, but this camp represented all who had  persevered, the rest being scared at the distance.    This reads funnily now when Mount Margaret is as civilised as Coolgardie  was then, and is connected by telegraph, and possibly will be soon  boasting of a railway. The blacks had been very troublesome, \"sticking up\"  swagmen, robbing camps, spearing horses, and the like. It is popularly  supposed that every case of violence on the part of the natives, may be  traced to the brutal white man's interference in their family  arrangements. No doubt it does happen that by coming between man and wife  a white man stirs up the tribe, and violence results, but in the majority  of cases that I know of, the poor black-fellow has recklessly speared,  wounding and killing, prospectors' horses, because he wanted food or  amusement. A man does not travel his packhorses into the bush for the  philanthropic purpose of feeding the aboriginals, and naturally resents  his losses and prevents their recurrence in a practical way.    As a matter of fact, the black population was so small, that even had  every individual of it been shot, the total would not have reached by a  long way the indiscriminate slaughter that was supposed to go on in the  bush. The people who used to hold their hands up in horror--righteous  horror had the tales been true--at the awful cruelties perpetrated by the  prospectors, based their opinions on the foolish \"gassing\" of a certain  style of man who thinks to make himself a hero by recounting dark deeds  of blood, wholly imaginary. I remember reading a letter to a friend from  his mother, in which she begged him to take no part in the \"nigger hunting  excursions\" that she had heard went on in Western Australia. Poor lady!  she need not have disturbed herself, for such things never existed, nor  had her boy ever seen a black-fellow, except round the slaughter-yards of  Coolgardie!    No luck attended our search in the Mount Margaret district, and we shared  the opinion of everybody there that it was a \"duffer,\" and after events  had proved what that opinion was worth. Travelling and prospecting as we  went, we at last succeeded in finding a reef which we thought was worth  having.    May 30th. We made camp amongst some auriferous hills in what is now known  as the Niagara District, and within a few miles of a spot where,  subsequently, a rich find of gold was made. Since the natives were known  to be troublesome in this locality, we adopted the plan of one stopping  in camp whilst the other prospected. Formerly we had considered it safe  for the one at home to be within reasonable distance of camp, but now,  when semi-civilised natives were prowling about, it was unwise to leave  the camp at all. Luck found gold first, but in so small a vein of quartz  that we did not consider it worth working. The next day, however, we  \"got colours\" in a fine big reef, and, moving our belongings to its  vicinity, started prospecting the outcrop. Everywhere we tried we found  gold sprinkled through the stone like pepper, and by \"dollying\" obtained  good results. Satisfied with the prospect, the next thing to be done was  to cross-cut the reef to ascertain its thickness and character below the  surface.    Fortunately water was close to hand, that is to say three miles away, in a  creek since named \"Dingo Creek.\" From there we packed water back to camp,  as often as we required it. Our luck in securing game had now deserted us,  and we had again to fall back on our nearly diminished stock of mince.    After a week's hard work we found that with our limited supply of tools,  without drills and dynamite, it was impossible to do any farther sinking;  besides which the low tide in our provisions necessitated a return to  civilisation before many days.    I pegged out, therefore, an area of four hundred yards by four hundred  yards, as a \"protection area\"; that is to say, that the fact of four  corner-pegs and a notice having been put up in some prominent place  protects the ground from being taken by any one else for a period of  thirty days. After that time has elapsed the area must be applied for at  the nearest Warden's office, where, unless disputed, it is registered  under the name of the applicant, who must at once commence work upon it.  When such work proves the existence of \"payable gold\" the area must be  again applied for as a lease, to hold which the sum of 1 pound per acre,  per annum, must be paid to the Government. There are other conditions with  which it is necessary to conform, and which need not be enumerated here.    Since we had ample time to go and return from Coolgardie within the  prescribed period, we decided that in place of travelling direct  homewards, we would make a detour and visit the locality of Mount Ida,  where we had heard gold had been found. By rapid travelling our \"tucker\"  could be made to last out the time. Winter was now coming on, and the  nights were bitterly cold. Our blankets in the morning were soaked with  dew and frost, and when the days were cloudy and sometimes drizzly we had  no chance of drying them until we built a fire at night. One is so used to  reading of the terrible heat in Australia that it may come as a surprise  to many to hear that in the short winter in the interior--which, by the  way, is 1,500 feet above sea level--the thermometer sometimes sinks for a  brief period of time to 17 degrees F.    This low temperature is reached about an hour before daylight, as you know  to your cost, if you are ill-provided with blankets. At that time in the  morning your head is drawn into the possum rug, and you lie stiff and  shivering until you hear the indescribable something--that heralds the  coming of the sun. It may be a camel moving, as he shakes the frost from  his woolly coat, it may be a bird, or a grasshopper, but always there is  some little noise that would tell even a blind man that the night is over.  Often you know by the stars how long it will be before daylight, and stir  up the fire, put on the billy, and get the saddles and packs in order.  Sometimes you fix on the wrong star, and are thanked accordingly by your  mate when, with his feet in his cold, clammy boots, he discovers that his  watch reads 2 a.m. Sometimes you have the satisfaction of growling at him,  and occasionally, if you feel in very nasty humour, you may lie \"dog-oh\"  and watch his early rising, knowing full well the right time; laughter,  however, gives you away, and you are justly rewarded by having the  blankets torn off you. Such simple pranks as these make bearable a life  that would otherwise suffocate you with its monotony.    And yet there is a charm about the bush--the perfect peace in the \"free  air of God\"--that so takes hold of some men that they can never be happy  anywhere else. Civilisation is a fine thing in its way, but the petty  worries and annoyances, the bustle and excitement, the crowds of people,  the \"you can't do this,\" and \"you must do that,\" the necessity for  dressing in most uncomfortable garments to be like other people, and a  thousand other such matters, so distress a bushman, who, like a caged  beast in a menagerie, wanders from corner to corner and cannot find where  to rest, that he longs for the day that he will again be on the track,  with all his worldly goods with him and the wide world before him. Such  a man in the bush and in the town is as different as a fish in and out of  water.    Some of the finest fellows \"outside the tracks\" are the least respectable  in civilised places, where before long they can find no better occupation  than drinking, which, owing to months of teetotalism in the bush, they are  less able to stand than the ordinary individual who takes his beer or  spirits daily. And thus it is that bushmen very often get the name of  being loafers and drunkards, though on the aggregate they consume far less  liquor than our most respected citizens in the towns. The sudden change in  surroundings, good food, and the number of fellow-creatures, the noise of  traffic, and want of exercise--all these combined are apt to affect a  man's head, even when unaided by the constant flow of liquor with which a  popular bushman is deluged--a deluge hard to resist in a country where to  refuse a drink amounts to an insult. A plan recommended by some is to  \"please 'em all by one jolly good spree, and then knock off and drink with  nobody.\" A man only gives offence who discriminates in his entertainers.    I fear I have wandered far from the subject of our journey, for Luck and I  had some time yet before us until the joys and troubles of civilised life  should be ours. The daily routine of travel was varied occasionally by  incidents of no great moment; for instance, when riding through the scrub,  Omerod, a rather clumsy old camel, tripped and fell, pinning me beneath  him, without injury to either of us; for a water bag acted as a buffer  between my leg and the saddle, and by the time all the water was squeezed  out of it, Luck had the saddle off, and I was extricated. Certainly some  camels are hard to put out or fluster; such a one was Omerod, who lay  without a kick until relieved of his saddle, when he rose and at once  proceeded to feed on the scrub.    Later, we had another"]]]
