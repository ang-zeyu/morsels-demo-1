[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3819"],[0,"The Euahlayi Tribe: A Study of Aboriginal Life in Australia (#10)"],[1,"  the Doowee-less one is doomed to die.    In a wirreenun's Minggah, too, are often secreted shadow spirits stolen  from their owners, who are by their loss dying a lingering death, for  no man can live without Mulloowil, his shadow. Every one has a shadow  spirit which he is very careful not to parade before his enemies, as  any injury to it affects himself. A wirreenun can gradually shrink the  shadow's size, the owner sickens and dies. 'May your shadow never be  less!'    The shadow of a wirreenun is, like his head, always mahgarl, or taboo;  any one touching either will be made to suffer for such sacrilege.    A man's Minggah is generally a tree from amongst his multiplex totems,'  as having greater reason to help him, being of the same family.    In his Minggah a wirreenun will probably keep some Wundah, or white  devil spirits, with which to work evil. There, too, he often keeps his  yunbeai, or animal spirit--that is, his individual totem, not  hereditary one. All wirreenuns have a yunbeai, and sometimes a special  favourite of the wirreenuns is given a yunbeai too--or in the event of  any one being very ill, he is given a yunbeai, and the strength of that  animal goes into the patient, making him strong again, or a dying  wirreenun leaves his yunbeai to some one else. Though this spirit gives  extra strength it likewise gives an extra danger, for any injury to the  animal hurts the man too; thus even wirreenuns are exposed to danger.    No one, as we have said, must eat the flesh of his yunbeai animal; he  may of his family totem, inherited from his mother, but of his yunbeai  or individual familiar, never.    A wirreenun can assume the shape of his yunbeai; so if his yunbeai  were, for example, a bird, and the wirreenun were in danger of being  wounded or killed, he would change himself into that bird and fly away.    A great wirreenun can substitute one yunbeai for another, as was done  when the opossum disappeared from our district, and the wirreenun,  whose yunbeai it was, sickened and lay ill for months. Two very  powerful wirreenuns gave him a new yunbeai, piggiebillah, the  porcupine. His recovery began at once. The porcupine had been one of  his favourite foods; from the time its spirit was put into him as his  yunbeai, he never touched it.    A wirreenun has the power to conjure up a vision of his particular  yunbeai, which he can make visible to those whom he chooses shall see  it.    The blacks always told me that a very old man on the Narran, dead some  years ago, would show me his yunbeai if I wished; it was Oolah, the  prickly lizard.    One day I went to the camp, saw the old man in his usual airy costume,  only assumed as I came in sight, a tailless shirt. One of the gins said  something to him; he growled an answer; she seemed persuading him to do  something. Presently he moved away to a quite clear spot on the other  side of the fire; he muttered something in a sing-song voice, and  suddenly I saw him beating his head as if in accompaniment to his song,  and then--where it came from I can't say--there beside him was a  lizard. That fragment of a shirt was too transparent to have hidden  that lizard; he could not have had it up his sleeve, because his  sleeves were in shreds. It may have been a pet lizard that he charmed  in from the bush by his song, but I did not see it arrive.    They told me this old man had two yunbeai, the other was a snake. He  often had them in evidence at his camp, and when he died they were seen  beside him; there they remained until he was put into his coffin, then  they disappeared and were never seen again. This man was the greatest  of our local wizards, and I think really the last of the very clever  ones. They say he was an old grey-headed man when Sir Thomas Mitchell  first explored the Narran district in 1845. We always considered him a  centenarian.    It was through him that I heard some of the best of the old legends,  with an interpreter to make good our respective deficiencies in each  other's language.    In the lives of blacks, or rather in their deaths, the Gooweera, or  poison sticks or bones, play a great part.    A Gooweera is a stick about six inches long and half an inch through,  pointed at both ends. This is used for sickening' or killing men.    A Guddeegooree is a similar stick, but much smaller, about three inches  in length, and is used against women.    A man wishing to injure another takes one of these sticks, and warms it  at a small fire he has made; he sticks the gooweera in the ground a few  inches from the fire. While it is warming, he chants an incantation,  telling who he wants to kill, why he wants to kill him, how long he  wants the process to last, whether it is to be sudden death or a  lingering sickness.    The chant over, and the gooweera warmed, he takes it from the fire.  Should he wish to kill his enemy quickly, he binds opossum hair cord  round the stick, only leaving one point exposed; should he only want to  make his enemy ill, he only partially binds the stick. Then he ties a  ligature tightly round his right arm, between the wrist and elbow, and  taking the gooweera, or guddeegooree, according to the sex of his  enemy, he points it at the person he wishes to injure, taking care he  is not seen doing it.    Suddenly he feels the stick becoming heavier, he knows then it is  drawing the blood from his enemy. The poison is prevented from entering  himself by the ligature he has put round his arm. When the gooweera is  heavy enough he ceases pointing it.    If he wants to kill the person outright, he goes away, makes a small  hole in the earth, makes a fire beside it. In this hole he puts a few  Dheal leaves--Dheal is the tree sacred to the dead; on top of the  leaves he puts the gooweera, then more leaves this done, he goes away.  The next day he comes back with his hand he hits the earth beside the  buried stick, out jumps the gooweera, his enemy is dead. He takes the  stick, which may be used many times, and goes on his way satisfied.  Should he only wish to inflict a lingering illness on his enemy, he  refrains from burying the gooweera, and in this case it is possible to  save the afflicted person.    For instance, should any one suspect the man with the gooweera of  having caused the illness, knowing of some grudge he had against the  sick person, the one who suspects will probably intercede for mercy.  The man may deny that he knows anything about it. He may, on the other  hand, confess that he is the agent. If the intercessions prevail, he  produces the gooweera, rubs it all over with iguana fat, and gives the  intercessor what fat is left to rub over the sick person, who, on that  being done, gradually regains his normal condition after having  probably been reduced to a living skeleton from an indescribable  wasting sickness, which I suspect we spell funk.    The best way to make a gooweera effective is to tie on the end of it  some hair from the victim's head--a lock of hair being, in this country  of upside-downs, a hate token instead of one of love.    When the lock of hair method is chosen as a means of happy dispatch,  the process is carried out by a professional.    The hair is taken to the Boogahroo--a bag of hair and gooweeras--which  is kept by one or two powerful wirreenuns in a certain Minggah. The  wirreenun on receiving the hair asks to whom it belongs. Should it  belong to one of a tribe he is favourably disposed towards, he takes  the gooweera or hair, puts it in the bag, but never sings the I death  song' over it, nor does he warm it.    Should he, however, be indifferent, or ill-disposed towards the  individual or his tribe, he completes the process by going through the  form already given, or rather when there are two wirreenuns at the  Boogahroo, the receiver of the hair gives it to the other one, who  sings the death-song, warms the gooweera, and burns the hair. The  person from whose head the hair on the gooweera came, then by  sympathetic magic, at whatever distance he is, dies a sudden or  lingering death according to the incantation sung over the  poison-stick. Gooweeras need not necessarily be of wood; bone is  sometimes used, and in these latter days even iron.    Sometimes at a large meeting of the blacks the Boogahroo wirreenuns  bring the bag and produce from it various locks of hair, which the  owners or their relations recognise, claim, and recover. They find out,  from the wirreenun, who put them there; on gaining which knowledge a  tribal feud is declared--a regular vendetta, which lasts from generation  to generation.    If it be known that a man has stolen a lock of hair, he will be watched  and prevented from reaching the Boogahroo tree, if possible.    These gooweeras used to be a terrible 'nuisance to us on the station. A  really good working black boy would say he must leave, he was going to  die. On inquiry we would extract the information that some one was  pointing a gooweera at him.    Then sometimes the whole camp was upset; a strange black fellow had  arrived, and was said to have brought gooweeras. This reaching the  boss's ears, confiscation would result in order to restore peace of  mind in the camp. Before I left the station a gin brought me a gooweera  and told me to keep it; she had stolen it from her husband, who had  threatened to point it at her for talking to another man.    Some of them, though they still had faith in the power of such charms,  had faith also in me. I used to drive devils out with patent medicines;  my tobacco and patent medicine accounts while collecting folk-lore were  enormous.    A wirreenun, or, in fact, any one having a yunbeai, has the power to  cure any one suffering an injury from whatever that yunbeai is; as, for  example, a man whose yunbeai is a black snake can cure a man who is  bitten by a black snake, the method being to chant an incantation which  makes the yunbeai enter the stricken body and drive out the poison."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/382"],[0,"Edinburgh: Picturesque Notes (#10)"],[1," These are the main features of the scene roughly sketched.  How they are  all tilted by the inclination of the ground, how each stands out in  delicate relief against the rest, what manifold detail, and play of sun  and shadow, animate and accentuate the picture, is a matter for a person  on the spot, and turning swiftly on his heels, to grasp and bind together  in one comprehensive look.  It is the character of such a prospect, to be  full of change and of things moving.  The multiplicity embarrasses the  eye; and the mind, among so much, suffers itself to grow absorbed with  single points.  You remark a tree in a hedgerow, or follow a cart along a  country road.  You turn to the city, and see children, dwarfed by  distance into pigmies, at play about suburban doorsteps; you have a  glimpse upon a thoroughfare where people are densely moving; you note  ridge after ridge of chimney-stacks running downhill one behind another,  and church spires rising bravely from the sea of roofs.  At one of the  innumerable windows, you watch a figure moving; on one of the multitude  of roofs, you watch clambering chimney-sweeps.  The wind takes a run and  scatters the smoke; bells are heard, far and near, faint and loud, to  tell the hour; or perhaps a bird goes dipping evenly over the housetops,  like a gull across the waves.  And here you are in the meantime, on this  pastoral hillside, among nibbling sheep and looked upon by monumental  buildings.    Return thither on some clear, dark, moonless night, with a ring of frost  in the air, and only a star or two set sparsedly in the vault of heaven;  and you will find a sight as stimulating as the hoariest summit of the  Alps.  The solitude seems perfect; the patient astronomer, flat on his  back under the Observatory dome and spying heaven's secrets, is your only  neighbour; and yet from all round you there come up the dull hum of the  city, the tramp of countless people marching out of time, the rattle of  carriages and the continuous keen jingle of the tramway bells.  An hour  or so before, the gas was turned on; lamplighters scoured the city; in  every house, from kitchen to attic, the windows kindled and gleamed forth  into the dusk.  And so now, although the town lies blue and darkling on  her hills, innumerable spots of the bright element shine far and near  along the pavements and upon the high facades.  Moving lights of the  railway pass and repass below the stationary lights upon the bridge.  Lights burn in the jail.  Lights burn high up in the tall _lands_ and on  the Castle turrets, they burn low down in Greenside or along the Park.  They run out one beyond the other into the dark country.  They walk in a  procession down to Leith, and shine singly far along Leith Pier.  Thus,  the plan of the city and her suburbs is mapped out upon the ground of  blackness, as when a child pricks a drawing full of pinholes and exposes  it before a candle; not the darkest night of winter can conceal her high  station and fanciful design; every evening in the year she proceeds to  illuminate herself in honour of her own beauty; and as if to complete the  scheme--or rather as if some prodigal Pharaoh were beginning to extend to  the adjacent sea and country--half-way over to Fife, there is an outpost  of light upon Inchkeith, and far to seaward, yet another on the May.    And while you are looking, across upon the Castle Hill, the drums and  bugles begin to recall the scattered garrison; the air thrills with the  sound; the bugles sing aloud; and the last rising flourish mounts and  melts into the darkness like a star: a martial swan-song, fitly rounding  in the labours of the day.          CHAPTER IX. WINTER AND NEW YEAR.      The Scotch dialect is singularly rich in terms of reproach against the  winter wind.  _Snell_, _blae_, _nirly_, and _scowthering_, are four of  these significant vocables; they are all words that carry a shiver with  them; and for my part, as I see them aligned before me on the page, I am  persuaded that a big wind comes tearing over the Firth from Burntisland  and the northern hills; I think I can hear it howl in the chimney, and as  I set my face northwards, feel its smarting kisses on my cheek.  Even in  the names of places there is often a desolate, inhospitable sound; and I  remember two from the near neighbourhood of Edinburgh, Cauldhame and  Blaw-weary, that would promise but starving comfort to their inhabitants.  The inclemency of heaven, which has thus endowed the language of Scotland  with words, has also largely modified the spirit of its poetry.  Both  poverty and a northern climate teach men the love of the hearth and the  sentiment of the family; and the latter, in its own right, inclines a  poet to the praise of strong waters.  In Scotland, all our singers have a  stave or two for blazing fires and stout potations:--to get indoors out  of the wind and to swallow something hot to the stomach, are benefits so  easily appreciated where they dwelt!    And this is not only so in country districts where the shepherd must wade  in the snow all day after his flock, but in Edinburgh itself, and nowhere  more apparently stated than in the works of our Edinburgh poet,  Fergusson.  He was a delicate youth, I take it, and willingly slunk from  the robustious winter to an inn fire-side.  Love was absent from his  life, or only present, if you prefer, in such a form that even the least  serious of Burns's amourettes was ennobling by comparison; and so there  is nothing to temper the sentiment of indoor revelry which pervades the  poor boy's verses.  Although it is characteristic of his native town, and  the manners of its youth to the present day, this spirit has perhaps done  something to restrict his popularity.  He recalls a supper-party  pleasantry with something akin to tenderness; and sounds the praises of  the act of drinking as if it were virtuous, or at least witty, in itself.  The kindly jar, the warm atmosphere of tavern parlours, and the revelry  of lawyers' clerks, do not offer by themselves the materials of a rich  existence.  It was not choice, so much as an external fate, that kept  Fergusson in this round of sordid pleasures.  A Scot of poetic  temperament, and without religious exaltation, drops as if by nature into  the public-house.  The picture may not be pleasing; but what else is a  man to do in this dog's weather?    To none but those who have themselves suffered the thing in the body, can  the gloom and depression of our Edinburgh winter be brought home.  For  some constitutions there is something almost physically disgusting in the  bleak ugliness of easterly weather; the wind wearies, the sickly sky  depresses them; and they turn back from their walk to avoid the aspect of  the unrefulgent sun going down among perturbed and pallid mists.  The  days are so short that a man does much of his business, and certainly all  his pleasure, by the haggard glare of gas lamps.  The roads are as heavy  as a fallow.  People go by, so drenched and draggle-tailed that I have  often wondered how they found the heart to undress.  And meantime the  wind whistles through the town as if it were an open meadow; and if you  lie awake all night, you hear it shrieking and raving overhead with a  noise of shipwrecks and of falling houses.  In a word, life is so  unsightly that there are times when the heart turns sick in a man's  inside; and the look of a tavern, or the thought of the warm, fire-lit  study, is like the touch of land to one who has been long struggling with  the seas.    As the weather hardens towards frost, the world begins to improve for  Edinburgh people.  We enjoy superb, sub-arctic sunsets, with the profile  of the city stamped in indigo upon a sky of luminous green.  The wind may  still be cold, but there is a briskness in the air that stirs good blood.  People do not all look equally sour and downcast.  They fall into two  divisions: one, the knight of the blue face and hollow paunch, whom  Winter has gotten by the vitals; the other well lined with New-year's  fare, conscious of the touch of cold on his periphery, but stepping  through it by the glow of his internal fires.  Such an one I remember,  triply cased in grease, whom no extremity of temperature could vanquish.  'Well,' would be his jovial salutation, 'here's a sneezer!'  And the look  of these warm fellows is tonic, and upholds their drooping  fellow-townsmen.  There is yet another class who do not depend on  corporal advantages, but support the winter in virtue of a brave and  merry heart.  One shivering evening, cold enough for frost but with too  high a wind, and a little past sundown, when the lamps were beginning to  enlarge their circles in the growing dusk, a brace of barefoot lassies  were seen coming eastward in the teeth of the wind.  If the one was as  much as nine, the other was certainly not more than seven.  They were  miserably clad; and the pavement was so cold, you would have thought no  one could lay a naked foot on it unflinching.  Yet they came along  waltzing, if you please, while the elder sang a tune to give them music.  The person who saw this, and whose heart was full of bitterness at the  moment, pocketed a reproof which has been of use to him ever since, and  which he now hands on, with his good wishes, to the reader.    At length, Edinburgh, with her satellite hills and all the sloping  country, are sheeted up in white.  If it has happened in the dark hours,  nurses pluck their children out of bed and run with them to some  commanding window, whence they may see the change that has been worked  upon earth's face.  'A' the hills are covered wi' snaw,' they sing, 'and  Winter's noo come fairly!'  And the children, marvelling at the silence  and the white landscape, find a spell appropriate to the season in the  words.  The reverberation of the snow increases the pale daylight, and  brings all objects nearer the eye.  The Pentlands are smooth and"]]]
