If our knowledge of the relative distances of the stars were more  complete, it would be an interesting exercise in celestial geometry to  project the constellations probably visible to the inhabitants of  worlds revolving around some of the other suns of space. Our sun is  too insignificant for us to think that he can make a conspicuous  appearance among them, except, perhaps, in a few cases. As seen, for  instance, from the nearest known star, Alpha Centauri, the sun would  appear of the average first magnitude, and consequently from that  standpoint he might be the gem of some little constellation which had  no Sirius, or Arcturus, or Vega to eclipse him with its superior  splendor. But from the distance of the vast majority of the stars the  sun would probably be invisible to the naked eye, and as seen from  nearer systems could only rank as a fifth or sixth magnitude star,  unnoticed and unknown except by the star-charting astronomer.    Conflagrations in the Heavens    Suppose it were possible for the world to take fire and burn up -- as  some pessimists think that it will do when the Divine wrath shall have  sufficiently accumulated against it -- nobody out of our own little  corner of space would ever be aware of the catastrophe! With all their  telescopes, the astronomers living in the golden light of Arcturus or  the diamond blaze of Canopus would be unable to detect the least  glimmer of the conflagration that had destroyed the seat of Adam and  his descendents, just as now they are totally ignorant of its  existence.    But at least fifteen times in the course of recorded history men  looking out from the earth have beheld in the remote depths of space  great outbursts of fiery light, some of them more splendidly luminous  than anything else in the firmament except the sun! If they were  conflagrations, how many million worlds like ours were required to  feed their blaze?    It is probable that ``temporary'' or ``new'' stars, as these wonderful  apparitions are called, really are conflagrations; not in the sense of  a bonfire or a burning house or city, but in that of a sudden eruption  of inconceivable heat and light, such as would result from the  stripping off the shell of an encrusted sun or the crashing together  of two mighty orbs flying through space with a hundred times the  velocity of the swiftest cannon-shot.    Temporary stars are the rarest and most erratic of astronomical  phenomena. The earliest records relating to them are not very clear,  and we cannot in every instance be certain that it was one of these  appearances that the ignorant and superstitious old chroniclers are  trying to describe. The first temporary star that we are absolutely  sure of appeared in 1572, and is known as ``Tycho's Star,'' because  the celebrated Danish astronomer (whose remains, with his  gold-and-silver artificial nose -- made necessary by a duel -- still  intact, were disinterred and reburied in 1901) was the first to  perceive it in the sky, and the most assiduous and successful in his  studies of it. As the first fully accredited representative of its  class, this new star made its entry upon the scene with becoming  eclat. It is characteristic of these phenomena that they burst into  view with amazing suddenness, and, of course, entirely unexpectedly.  Tycho's star appeared in the constellation Cassiopeia, near a now  well-known and much-watched little star named Kappa, on the evening of  November 11, 1572. The story has often been repeated, but it never  loses interest, how Tycho, going home that evening, saw people in the  street pointing and staring at the sky directly over their heads, and  following the direction of their hands and eyes he was astonished to  see, near the zenith, an unknown star of surpassing brilliance. It  outshone the planet Jupiter, and was therefore far brighter than the  first magnitude. There was not another star in the heavens that could  be compared with it in splendor. Tycho was not in all respects free  from the superstitions of his time -- and who is? -- but he had the  true scientific instinct, and immediately he began to study the  stranger, and to record with the greatest care every change in its  aspect. First he determined as well as he could with the imperfect  instruments of his day, many of which he himself had invented, the  precise location of the phenomena in the sky. Then he followed the  changes that it underwent. At first it brightened until its light  equaled or exceeded that of the planet Venus at her brightest, a  statement which will be appreciated at its full value by anyone who  has ever watched Venus when she plays her dazzling role of ``Evening  Star,'' flaring like an arc light in the sunset sky. It even became so  brilliant as to be visible in full daylight, since, its position being  circumpolar, it never set in the latitude of Northern Europe. Finally  it began to fade, turning red as it did so, and in March, 1574, it  disappeared from Tycho's searching gaze, and has never been seen again  from that day to this. None of the astronomers of the time could make  anything of it. They had not yet as many bases of speculation as we  possess today.    Tycho's star has achieved a romantic reputation by being fancifully  identified with the ``Star of Bethlehem,'' said to have led the  wondering Magi from their eastern deserts to the cradle-manger of the  Savior in Palestine. Many attempts have been made to connect this  traditional ``star'' with some known phenomenon of the heavens, and  none seems more idle than this. Yet it persistently survives, and no  astronomer is free from eager questions about it addressed by people  whose imagination has been excited by the legend. It is only necessary  to say that the supposition of a connection between the phenomenon of  the Magi and Tycho's star is without any scientific foundation. It was  originally based on an unwarranted assumption that the star of Tycho  was a variable of long period, appearing once every three hundred and  fifteen years, or thereabout. If that were true there would have been  an apparition somewhere near the traditional date of the birth of  Christ, a date which is itself uncertain. But even the data on which  the assumption was based are inconsistent with the theory. Certain  monkish records speak of something wonderful appearing in the sky in  the years 1264 and 945, and these were taken to have been outbursts of  Tycho's star. Investigation shows that the records more probably refer  to comets, but even if the objects seen were temporary stars, their  dates do not suit the hypothesis; from 945 to 1264 there is a gap of  319 years, and from 1264 to 1572 one of only 308 years; moreover 337  years have now (1909) elapsed since Tycho saw the last glimmer of his  star. Upon a variability so irregular and uncertain as that, even if  we felt sure that it existed, no conclusion could be found concerning  an apparition occurring 2000 years ago.    In the year 1600 (the year in which Giordano Bruno was burned at the  stake for teaching that there is more than one physical world), a  temporary star of the third magnitude broke out in the constellation  Cygnus, and curiously enough, considering the rarity of such  phenomena, only four years later another surprisingly brilliant one  appeared in the constellation Ophiuchus. This is often called  ``Kepler's star,'' because the great German astronomer devoted to it  the same attention that Tycho had given to the earlier phenomenon. It,  too, like Tycho's, was at first the brightest object in the stellar  heavens, although it seems never to have quite equaled its famous  predecessor in splendor. It disappeared after a year, also turning of  a red color as it became more faint. We shall see the significance of  this as we go on. Some of Kepler's contemporaries suggested that the  outburst of this star was due to a meeting of atoms in space, and idea  bearing a striking resemblance to the modern theory of ``astronomical  collisions.''    In 1670, 1848, and 1860 temporary stars made their appearance, but  none of them was of great brilliance. In 1866 one of the second  magnitude broke forth in the ``Northern Crown'' and awoke much  interest, because by that time the spectroscope had begun to be  employed in studying the composition of the stars, and Huggins  demonstrated that the new star consisted largely of incandescent  hydrogen. But this star, apparently unlike the others mentioned, was  not absolutely new. Before its outburst it had shown as a star of the  ninth magnitude (entirely invisible, of course, to the naked eye), and  after about six weeks it faded to its original condition in which it  has ever since remained. In 1876 a temporary star appeared in the  constellation Cygnus, and attained at one time the brightness of the  second magnitude. Its spectrum and its behavior resembled those of its  immediate predecessor. In 1885, astronomers were surprised to see a  sixth-magnitude star glimmering in the midst of the hazy cloud of the  great Andromeda Nebula. It soon absolutely disappeared. Its spectrum  was remarkable for being ``continuous,'' like that of the nebula  itself. A continuous spectrum is supposed to represent a body, or a  mass, which is either solid or liquid, or composed of gas under great  pressure. In January, 1892, a new star was suddenly seen in the  constellation Auriga. It never rose much above the fourth magnitude,  but it showed a peculiar spectrum containing both bright and dark  lines of hydrogen.    But a bewildering surprise was now in store; the world was to behold  at the opening of the twentieth century such a celestial spectacle as  had not been on view since the times of Tycho and Kepler. Before  daylight on the morning of February 22, 1901, the Rev. Doctor  Anderson, of Edinburgh, an amateur astronomer, who had also been the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6653"],[0,"Voyages of Samuel De Champlain — Volume 01 (#10)"],[1,"or pass over to the mainland. They were therefore  imprisoned in their own home. Thus cut off from the game with which the  neighboring forests abounded, they were compelled to subsist almost  exclusively upon salted meats. Nearly all the forest trees on the island  had been used in the construction of their houses, and they had  consequently but a meagre supply of fuel to resist the chilling winds and  penetrating frosts. For fresh water, their only reliance was upon melted  snow and ice. Their store-house had not been furnished with a cellar, and  the frost left nothing untouched; even cider was dispensed in solid blocks.  To crown the gloom and wretchedness of their situation, the colony was  visited with disease of a virulent and fatal character. As the malady was  beyond the knowledge, so it baffled the skill of the surgeons. They called  it _mal de la terre_. Of the seventy-nine persons, composing the whole  number of the colony, thirty-five died, and twenty others were brought to  the verge of the grave. In May, having been liberated from the baleful  influence of their winter prison and revived by the genial warmth of the  vernal sun and by the fresh meats obtained from the savages, the disease  abated, and the survivors gradually regained their strength.    Disheartened by the bitter experiences of the winter, the governor, having  fully determined to abandon his present establishment, ordered two boats to  be constructed, one of fifteen and the other of seven tons, in which to  transport his colony to Gaspe, in case he received no supplies from France,  with the hope of obtaining a passage home in some of the fishing vessels on  that coast. But from this disagreeable alternative he was happily relieved.  On the 15th of June, 1605, Pont Grave arrived, to the great joy of the  little colony, with all needed supplies. The purpose of returning to France  was at once abandoned, and, as no time was to be lost, on the 18th of the  same month, De Monts, Champlain, several gentlemen, twenty sailors, two  Indians, Panounias and his wife, set sail for the purpose of discovering a  more eligible site for his colony somewhere on the shores of the present  New England. Passing slowly along the coast, with which Champlain was  already familiar, and consequently without extensive explorations, they at  length reached the waters of the Kennebec, [39] where the survey of the  previous year had terminated and that of the present was about to begin.    On the 5th of July, they entered the Kennebec, and, bearing to the right,  passed through Back River, [40] grazing their barque on the rocks in the  narrow channel, and then sweeping down round the southern point of  Jerremisquam Island, or Westport, they ascended along its eastern shores  till they came near the present site of Wiscasset, from whence they  returned on the western side of the island, through Monseag Bay, and  threading the narrow passage between Arrowsick and Woolwich, called the  Upper Hell-gate, and again entering the Kennebec, they finally reached  Merrymeeting Bay. Lingering here but a short time, they returned through  the Sagadahock, or lower Kennebec, to the mouth of the river.    This exploration did not yield to the voyagers any very interesting or  important results. Several friendly interviews were held with the savages  at different points along the route. Near the head waters of the Sheepscot,  probably in Wiscasset Bay, they had an interview, an interesting and joyous  meeting, with the chief Manthomerme and twenty-five or thirty followers,  with whom they exchanged tokens of friendship. Along the shores of the  Sheepscot their attention was attracted by several pleasant streams and  fine expanses of meadow; but the soil observed on this expedition  generally, and especially on the Sagadahock, [41] or lower Kennebec, was  rough and barren, and offered, in the judgment of De Monts and Champlain,  no eligible site for a new settlement.    Proceeding, therefore, on their voyage, they struck directly across Casco  Bay, not attempting, in their ignorance, to enter the fine harbor of  Portland.    On the 9th of July, they made the bay that stretches from Cape Elizabeth to  Fletcher's Neck, and anchored under the lee of Stratton Island, directly in  sight of Old Orchard Beach, now a famous watering place during the summer  months.    The savages having seen the little French barque approaching in the  distance, had built fires to attract its attention, and came down upon the  shore at Prout's Neck, formerly known as Black Point, in large numbers,  indicating their friendliness by lively demonstrations of joy. From this  anchorage, while awaiting the influx of the tide to enable them to pass  over the bar and enter a river which they saw flowing into the bay, De  Monts paid a visit to Richmond's Island, about four miles distant, which he  was greatly delighted, as he found it richly studded with oak and hickory,  whose bending branches were wreathed with luxuriant grapevines loaded with  green clusters of unripe fruit. In honor of the god of wine, they gave to  the island the classic name of Bacchus. [42] At full tide they passed over  the bar and cast anchor within the channel of the Saco.    The Indians whom they found here were called Almouchiquois, and differed in  many respects from any which they had seen before, from the Sourequois of  Nova Scotia and the Etechemins of the northern part of Maine and New  Brunswick. They spoke a different language, and, unlike their neighbors on  the east, did not subsist mainly by the chase, but upon the products of the  soil, supplemented by fish, which were plentiful and of excellent quality,  and which they took with facility about the mouth of the river. De Monts  and Champlain made an excursion upon the shore, where their eyes were  refreshed by fields of waving corn, and gardens of squashes, beans, and  pumpkins, which were then bursting into flower. [43] Here they saw in  cultivation the rank narcotic _petun_, or tobacco, [44] just beginning to  spread out its broad velvet leaves to the sun, the sole luxury of savage  life. The forests were thinly wooded, but were nevertheless rich in  primitive oak, in lofty ash and elm, and in the more humble and sturdy  beech. As on Richmond's Island so here, along the bank of the river they  found grapes in luxurious growth, from which the sailors busied themselves  in making verjuice, a delicious beverage in the meridian heats of a July  sun. The natives were gentle and amiable, graceful in figure, agile in  movement, and exhibited unusual taste, dressing their hair in a variety of  twists and braids, intertwined with ornamental feathers.    Champlain observed their method of cultivating Indian corn, which the  experience of two hundred and seventy-five years has in no essential point  improved or even changed. They planted three or four seeds in hills three  feet apart, and heaped the earth about them, and kept the soil clear of  weeds. Such is the method of the successful New England farmer to-day. The  experience of the savage had taught him how many individuals of the rank  plant could occupy prolifically a given area, how the soil must be gathered  about the roots to sustain the heavy stock, and that there must be no rival  near it to draw away the nutriment on which the voracious plant feeds and  grows. Civilization has invented implements to facilitate the processes of  culture, but the observation of the savage had led him to a knowledge of  all that is absolutely necessary to ensure a prolific harvest.    After lingering two days at Saco, our explorers proceeded on their voyage.  When they had advanced not more than twenty miles, driven by a fierce wind,  they were forced to cast anchor near the salt marshes of Wells. Having been  driven by Cape Porpoise, on the subsidence of the wind, they returned to  it, reconnoitred its harbor and adjacent islands, together with Little  River, a few miles still further to the east. The shores were lined all  along with nut-trees and grape-vines. The islands about Cape Porpoise were  matted all over with wild currants, so that the eye could scarcely discern  any thing else. Attracted doubtless by this fruit, clouds of wild pigeons  had assembled there, and were having a midsummer's festival, fearless of  the treacherous snare or the hunter's deadly aim. Large numbers of them  were taken, which added a coveted luxury to the not over-stocked larder of  the little French barque.    On the 15th of July, De Monts and his party left Cape Porpoise,  keeping in and following closely the sinuosities of the shore. They  saw no savages during the day, nor any evidences of any, except a  rising smoke, which they approached, but found to be a lone beacon,  without any surroundings of human life. Those who had kindled the fire  had doubtless concealed themselves, or had fled in dismay. Possibly  they had never seen a ship under sail. The fishermen who frequented  our northern coast rarely came into these waters, and the little craft  of our voyagers, moving without oars or any apparent human aid, seemed  doubtless to them a monster gliding upon the wings of the wind. At the  setting of the sun, they were near the flat and sandy coast, now known  as Wallace's Sands. They fought in vain for a roadstead where they  might anchor safely for the night. When they were opposite to Little  Boar's Head, with the Isles of Shoals directly east of them, and the  reflected rays of the sun were still throwing their light upon the  waters, they saw in the distance the dim outline of Cape Anne, whither  they directed their course, and, before morning, came to anchor near  its eastern extremity, in sixteen fathoms of water. Near them were the  three well-known islands at the apex of the cape, covered with  forest-trees, and the woodless cluster of rocks, now called the  Savages, a little further from the shore.
