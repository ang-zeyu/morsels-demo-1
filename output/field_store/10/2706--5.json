Don't you wish you'd been here when the League was on before?\"    \"I should think I did. Race you over to the shop. I want to get  something before it shuts.\"    \"Right ho!\" And they disappeared.    O'Hara waited where he was till six struck from the clock-tower,  followed by the sound of the bell as it rang for lock-up. Then he  picked his way carefully through the groves of chairs, barking his  shins now and then on their out-turned legs, and, pushing open the  door, went out into the open air. It felt very fresh and pleasant after  the brand of atmosphere supplied in the vault. He then ran over to the  gymnasium to meet Moriarty, feeling a little disgusted at the lack of  success that had attended his detective efforts up to the present. So  far he had nothing to show for his trouble except a good deal of dust  on his clothes, and a dirty collar, but he was full of determination.  He could play a waiting game.    It was a pity, as it happened, that O'Hara left the vault when he did.  Five minutes after he had gone, six shadowy forms made their way  silently and in single file through the doorway of the vault, which  they closed carefully behind them. The fact that it was after lock-up  was of small consequence. A good deal of latitude in that way was  allowed at Wrykyn. It was the custom to go out, after the bell had  sounded, to visit the gymnasium. In the winter and Easter terms, the  gymnasium became a sort of social club. People went there with a very  small intention of doing gymnastics. They went to lounge about, talking  to cronies, in front of the two huge stoves which warmed the place.  Occasionally, as a concession to the look of the thing, they would do  an easy exercise or two on the horse or parallels, but, for the most  part, they preferred the _role_ of spectator. There was plenty to  see. In one corner O'Hara and Moriarty would be sparring their nightly  six rounds (in two batches of three rounds each). In another, Drummond,  who was going up to Aldershot as a feather-weight, would be putting in  a little practice with the instructor. On the apparatus, the members of  the gymnastic six, including the two experts who were to carry the  school colours to Aldershot in the spring, would be performing their  usual marvels. It was worth dropping into the gymnasium of an evening.  In no other place in the school were so many sights to be seen.    When you were surfeited with sightseeing, you went off to your house.  And this was where the peculiar beauty of the gymnasium system came in.  You went up to any master who happened to be there--there was always  one at least--and observed in suave accents, \"Please, sir, can I have a  paper?\" Whereupon, he, taking a scrap of paper, would write upon it,  \"J. O. Jones (or A. B. Smith or C. D. Robinson) left gymnasium at  such-and-such a time\". And, by presenting this to the menial who  opened the door to you at your house, you went in rejoicing, and all  was peace.    Now, there was no mention on the paper of the hour at which you came to  the gymnasium--only of the hour at which you left. Consequently, certain  lawless spirits would range the neighbourhood after lock-up, and, by  putting in a quarter of an hour at the gymnasium before returning to  their houses, escape comment. To this class belonged the shadowy forms  previously mentioned.    O'Hara had forgotten this custom, with the result that he was not at  the vault when they arrived. Moriarty, to whom he confided between the  rounds the substance of his evening's discoveries, reminded him of it.  \"It's no good watching before lock-up,\" he said. \"After six is the time  they'll come, if they come at all.\"    \"Bedad, ye're right,\" said O'Hara. \"One of these nights we'll take a  night off from boxing, and go and watch.\"    \"Right,\" said Moriarty. \"Are ye ready to go on?\"    \"Yes. I'm going to practise that left swing at the body this round. The  one Fitzsimmons does.\" And they \"put 'em up\" once more.          X    BEING A CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS      On the evening following O'Hara's adventure in the vaults, Barry and  M'Todd were in their study, getting out the tea-things. Most Wrykinians  brewed in the winter and Easter terms, when the days were short and  lock-up early. In the summer term there were other things to do--nets,  which lasted till a quarter to seven (when lock-up was), and the  baths--and brewing practically ceased. But just now it was at its height,  and every evening, at a quarter past five, there might be heard in the  houses the sizzling of the succulent sausage and other rare delicacies.  As a rule, one or two studies would club together to brew, instead of  preparing solitary banquets. This was found both more convivial and  more economical. At Seymour's, studies numbers five, six, and seven had  always combined from time immemorial, and Barry, on obtaining study  six, had carried on the tradition. In study five were Drummond and his  friend De Bertini. In study seven, which was a smaller room and only  capable of holding one person with any comfort, one James Rupert  Leather-Twigg (that was his singular name, as Mr Gilbert has it) had  taken up his abode. The name of Leather-Twigg having proved, at an  early date in his career, too great a mouthful for Wrykyn, he was known  to his friends and acquaintances by the euphonious title of  Shoeblossom. The charm about the genial Shoeblossom was that you could  never tell what he was going to do next. All that you could rely on  with any certainty was that it would be something which would have been  better left undone.    It was just five o'clock when Barry and M'Todd started to get things  ready. They were not high enough up in the school to have fags, so that  they had to do this for themselves.    Barry was still in football clothes. He had been out running and  passing with the first fifteen. M'Todd, whose idea of exercise was  winding up a watch, had been spending his time since school ceased in  the study with a book. He was in his ordinary clothes. It was therefore  fortunate that, when he upset the kettle (he nearly always did at some  period of the evening's business), the contents spread themselves over  Barry, and not over himself. Football clothes will stand any amount of  water, whereas M'Todd's \"Youth's winter suiting at forty-two shillings  and sixpence\" might have been injured. Barry, however, did not look  upon the episode in this philosophical light. He spoke to him  eloquently for a while, and then sent him downstairs to fetch more  water. While he was away, Drummond and De Bertini came in.    \"Hullo,\" said Drummond, \"tea ready?\"    \"Not much,\" replied Barry, bitterly, \"not likely to be, either, at this  rate. We'd just got the kettle going when that ass M'Todd plunged  against the table and upset the lot over my bags. Lucky the beastly  stuff wasn't boiling. I'm soaked.\"    \"While we wait--the sausages--Yes?--a good idea--M'Todd, he is  downstairs--but to wait? No, no. Let us. Shall we? Is it not so? Yes?\"  observed Bertie, lucidly.    \"Now construe,\" said Barry, looking at the linguist with a bewildered  expression. It was a source of no little inconvenience to his friends  that De Bertini was so very fixed in his determination to speak  English. He was a trier all the way, was De Bertini. You rarely caught  him helping out his remarks with the language of his native land. It  was English or nothing with him. To most of his circle it might as well  have been Zulu.    Drummond, either through natural genius or because he spent more time  with him, was generally able to act as interpreter. Occasionally there  would come a linguistic effort by which even he freely confessed  himself baffled, and then they would pass on unsatisfied. But, as a  rule, he was equal to the emergency. He was so now.    \"What Bertie means,\" he explained, \"is that it's no good us waiting for  M'Todd to come back. He never could fill a kettle in less than ten  minutes, and even then he's certain to spill it coming upstairs and  have to go back again. Let's get on with the sausages.\"    The pan had just been placed on the fire when M'Todd returned with the  water. He tripped over the mat as he entered, and spilt about half a  pint into one of his football boots, which stood inside the door, but  the accident was comparatively trivial, and excited no remark.    \"I wonder where that slacker Shoeblossom has got to,\" said Barry. \"He  never turns up in time to do any work. He seems to regard himself as a  beastly guest. I wish we could finish the sausages before he comes. It  would be a sell for him.\"    \"Not much chance of that,\" said Drummond, who was kneeling before the  fire and keeping an excited eye on the spluttering pan, \"_you_  see. He'll come just as we've finished cooking them. I believe the man  waits outside with his ear to the keyhole. Hullo! Stand by with the  plate. They'll be done in half a jiffy.\"    Just as the last sausage was deposited in safety on the plate, the door  opened, and Shoeblossom, looking as if he had not brushed his hair  since early childhood, sidled in with an attempt at an easy nonchalance  which was rendered quite impossible by the hopeless state of his  conscience.    \"Ah,\" he said, \"brewing, I see. Can I be of any use?\"    \"We've finished years ago,\" said Barry.    \"Ages ago,\" said M'Todd.    A look of intense alarm appeared on Shoeblossom's classical features.    \"You've not finished, really?\"    \"We've finished cooking everything,\" said Drummond. \"We haven't begun  tea yet. Now, are you happy?\"    Shoeblossom was. So happy that he felt he must do something to  celebrate the occasion. He felt like a successful general. There must  be _something_ he could do to show that he regarded the situation  with approval. He looked round the study. Ha! Happy thought--the  frying-pan. That useful culinary instrument was lying in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6886"],[0,"First Footsteps in East Africa (#10)"],[1,"especially amongst the Eesa, prefer a coarse heavy lance, which never  leaves the hand. The Somali spear is held in various ways: generally the  thumb and forefinger grasp the third nearest to the head, and the shaft  resting upon the palm is made to quiver. In action, the javelin is rarely  thrown at a greater distance than six or seven feet, and the heavier  weapon is used for \"jobbing.\" Stripped to his waist, the thrower runs  forward with all the action of a Kafir, whilst the attacked bounds about  and crouches to receive it upon the round targe, which it cannot pierce.  He then returns the compliment, at the same time endeavouring to break the  weapon thrown at him by jumping and stamping upon it. The harmless  missiles being exhausted, both combatants draw their daggers, grapple with  the left hand, and with the right dig hard and swift at each other's necks  and shoulders. When matters come to this point, the duel is soon decided,  and the victor, howling his slogan, pushes away from his front the dying  enemy, and rushes off to find another opponent. A puerile weapon during  the day, when a steady man can easily avoid it, the spear is terrible in  night attacks or in the \"bush,\" whence it can be hurled unseen. For  practice, we plant a pair of slippers upright in the ground, at the  distance of twelve yards, and a skilful spearman hits the mark once in  every three throws.    The Somali dagger is an iron blade about eighteen inches long by two in  breadth, pointed and sharp at both edges. The handle is of buffalo or  other horn, with a double scoop to fit the grasp; and at the hilt is a  conical ornament of zinc. It is worn strapped round the waist by a thong  sewed to the sheath, and long enough to encircle the body twice: the point  is to the right, and the handle projects on the left. When in town, the  Somal wear their daggers under the Tobe: in battle, the strap is girt over  the cloth to prevent the latter being lost. They always stab from above:  this is as it should be, a thrust with a short weapon \"underhand\" may be  stopped, if the adversary have strength enough to hold the stabber's  forearm. The thrust is parried with the shield, and a wound is rarely  mortal except in the back: from the great length of the blade, the least  movement of the man attacked causes it to fall upon the shoulder-blade.    The \"Budd,\" or Somali club, resembles the Kafir \"Tonga.\" It is a knobstick  about a cubit long, made of some hard wood: the head is rounded on the  inside, and the outside is cut to an edge. In quarrels, it is considered a  harmless weapon, and is often thrown at the opponent and wielded viciously  enough where the spear point would carefully be directed at the buckler.  The Gashan or shield is a round targe about eighteen inches in diameter;  some of the Bedouins make it much larger. Rhinoceros' skin being rare, the  usual material is common bull's hide, or, preferably, that of the Oryx,  called by the Arabs Waal, and by the Somal, Baid. These shields are  prettily cut, and are always protected when new with a covering of  canvass. The boss in the centre easily turns a spear, and the strongest  throw has very little effect even upon the thinnest portion. When not  used, the Gashan is slung upon the left forearm: during battle, the  handle, which is in the middle, is grasped by the left hand, and held out  at a distance from the body.    We are sometimes joined in our exercises by the Arab mercenaries, who are  far more skilful than the Somal. The latter are unacquainted with the  sword, and cannot defend themselves against it with the targe; they know  little of dagger practice, and were beaten at their own weapon, the  javelin, by the children of Bir Hamid. Though unable to jump for the  honour of the turban, I soon acquired the reputation of being the  strongest man in Zayla: this is perhaps the easiest way of winning respect  from a barbarous people, who honour body, and degrade mind to mere  cunning.    When tired of exercise we proceed round the walls to the Ashurbara or  Southern Gate. Here boys play at \"hockey\" with sticks and stones  energetically as in England: they are fine manly specimens of the race,  but noisy and impudent, like all young savages. At two years of age they  hold out the right hand for sweetmeats, and if refused become insolent.  The citizens amuse themselves with the ball [17], at which they play  roughly as Scotch linkers: they are divided into two parties, bachelors  and married men; accidents often occur, and no player wears any but the  scantiest clothing, otherwise he would retire from the conflict in rags.  The victors sing and dance about the town for hours, brandishing their  spears, shouting their slogans, boasting of ideal victories,--the  Abyssinian Donfatu, or war-vaunt,--and advancing in death-triumph with  frantic gestures: a battle won would be celebrated with less circumstance  in Europe. This is the effect of no occupation--the _primum mobile_ of the  Indian prince's kite-flying and all the puerilities of the pompous East.    We usually find an encampment of Bedouins outside the gate. Their tents  are worse than any gipsy's, low, smoky, and of the rudest construction.  These people are a spectacle of savageness. Their huge heads of shock  hair, dyed red and dripping with butter, are garnished with a Firin, or  long three-pronged comb, a stick, which acts as scratcher when the owner  does not wish to grease his fingers, and sometimes with the ominous  ostrich feather, showing that the wearer has \"killed his man:\" a soiled  and ragged cotton cloth covers their shoulders, and a similar article is  wrapped round their loins.[18] All wear coarse sandals, and appear in the  bravery of targe, spear, and dagger. Some of the women would be pretty did  they not resemble the men in their scowling, Satanic expression of  countenance: they are decidedly _en deshabille,_ but a black skin always  appears a garb. The cantonment is surrounded by asses, camels, and a troop  of naked Flibertigibbets, who dance and jump in astonishment whenever they  see me: \"The white man! the white man!\" they shriek; \"run away, run away,  or we shall be eaten!\" [19] On one occasion, however, my _amour propre_  was decidedly flattered by the attentions of a small black girl,  apparently four or five years old, who followed me through the streets  ejaculating \"Wa Wanaksan!\"--\"0 fine!\" The Bedouins, despite their fierce  scowls, appear good-natured; the women flock out of the huts to stare and  laugh, the men to look and wonder. I happened once to remark, \"Lo, we come  forth to look at them and they look at us; we gaze at their complexion and  they gaze at ours!\" A Bedouin who understood Arabic translated this speech  to the others, and it excited great merriment. In the mining counties of  civilised England, where the \"genial brickbat\" is thrown at the passing  stranger, or in enlightened Scotland, where hair a few inches too long or  a pair of mustachios justifies \"mobbing,\" it would have been impossible  for me to have mingled as I did with these wild people.    We must return before sunset, when the gates are locked and the keys are  carried to the Hajj, a vain precaution, when a donkey could clear half a  dozen places in the town wall. The call to evening prayer sounds as we  enter: none of my companions pray [20], but all when asked reply in the  phrase which an Englishman hates, \"Inshallah Bukra\"--\"if Allah please, to-  morrow!\"--and they have the decency not to appear in public at the hours  of devotion. The Somal, like most Africans, are of a somewhat irreverent  turn of mind. [21] When reproached with gambling, and asked why they  persist in the forbidden pleasure, they simply answer \"Because we like.\"  One night, encamped amongst the Eesa, I was disturbed by a female voice  indulging in the loudest lamentations: an elderly lady, it appears, was  suffering from tooth-ache, and the refrain of her groans was, \"O Allah,  may thy teeth ache like mine! O Allah, may thy gums be sore as mine are!\"  A well-known and characteristic tale is told of the Gerad Hirsi, now chief  of the Berteri tribe. Once meeting a party of unarmed pilgrims, he asked  them why they had left their weapons at home: they replied in the usual  phrase, \"Nahnu mutawakkilin\"--\"we are trusters (in Allah).\" That evening,  having feasted them hospitably, the chief returned hurriedly to the hut,  declaring that his soothsayer ordered him at once to sacrifice a pilgrim,  and begging the horror-struck auditors to choose the victim. They cast  lots and gave over one of their number: the Gerad placed him in another  hut, dyed his dagger with sheep's blood, and returned to say that he must  have a second life. The unhappy pilgrims rose _en masse_, and fled so  wildly that the chief, with all the cavalry of the desert, found  difficulty in recovering them. He dismissed them with liberal presents,  and not a few jibes about their trustfulness. The wilder Bedouins will  inquire where Allah is to be found: when asked the object of the question,  they reply, \"If the Eesa could but catch him they would spear him upon the  spot,--who but he lays waste their homes and kills their cattle and  wives?\" Yet, conjoined to this truly savage incapability of conceiving the  idea of a Supreme Being, they believe in the most ridiculous  exaggerations: many will not affront a common pilgrim, for fear of being  killed by a glance or a word.    Our supper, also provided by the hospitable Hajj, is the counterpart of  the midday dinner. After it we repair to the roof, to enjoy the prospect  of the far Tajurrah hills and the white moonbeams sleeping upon the nearer  sea. The evening star hangs like a diamond upon the still horizon: around  the moon a pink zone of light mist, shading off into turquoise blue, and a  delicate green like chrysopraz, invests the heavens with a peculiar charm.  The scene is truly suggestive: behind us, purpling in "]]]
