'Yes, papa.  It was my fault; and Lootie was very sorry.'    'I must talk to Lootie about it,' said the king.    'Don't speak loud to her, please, papa,' said Irene.  'She's been so  afraid of being late ever since!  Indeed she has not been naughty.  It  was only a mistake for once.'    'Once might be too often,' murmured the king to himself, as he stroked  his child's head.    I can't tell you how he had come to know.  I am sure Curdie had not  told him.  Someone about the palace must have seen them, after all.    He sat for a good while thinking.  There was no sound to be heard  except that of a little stream which ran merrily out of an opening in  the rock by where they sat, and sped away down the hill through the  garden.  Then he rose and, leaving Irene where she was, went into the  house and sent for Lootie, with whom he had a talk that made her cry.    When in the evening he rode away upon his great white horse, he left  six of his attendants behind him, with orders that three of them should  watch outside the house every night, walking round and round it from  sunset to sunrise.  It was clear he was not quite comfortable about the  princess.        CHAPTER 11    The Old Lady's Bedroom    Nothing more happened worth telling for some time.  The autumn came and  went by.  There were no more flowers in the garden.  The wind blew  strong, and howled among the rocks.  The rain fell, and drenched the  few yellow and red leaves that could not get off the bare branches.  Again and again there would be a glorious morning followed by a pouring  afternoon, and sometimes, for a week together, there would be rain,  nothing but rain, all day, and then the most lovely cloudless night,  with the sky all out in full-blown stars--not one missing.  But the  princess could not see much of them, for she went to bed early.  The  winter drew on, and she found things growing dreary.  When it was too  stormy to go out, and she had got tired of her toys, Lootie would take  her about the house, sometimes to the housekeeper's room, where the  housekeeper, who was a good, kind old woman, made much of  her--sometimes to the servants' hall or the kitchen, where she was not  princess merely, but absolute queen, and ran a great risk of being  spoiled. Sometimes she would run off herself to the room where the  men-at-arms whom the king had left sat, and they showed her their arms  and accoutrements and did what they could to amuse her.  Still at times  she found it very dreary, and often and often wished that her huge  great grandmother had not been a dream.    One morning the nurse left her with the housekeeper for a while. To  amuse her she turned out the contents of an old cabinet upon the table.  The little princess found her treasures, queer ancient ornaments, and  many things the use of which she could not imagine, far more  interesting than her own toys, and sat playing with them for two hours  or more.  But, at length, in handling a curious old-fashioned brooch,  she ran the pin of it into her thumb, and gave a little scream with the  sharpness of the pain, but would have thought little more of it had not  the pain increased and her thumb begun to swell.  This alarmed the  housekeeper greatly.  The nurse was fetched; the doctor was sent for;  her hand was poulticed, and long before her usual time she was put to  bed.  The pain still continued, and although she fell asleep and  dreamed a good many dreams, there was the pain always in every dream.  At last it woke her UP.    The moon was shining brightly into the room.  The poultice had fallen  off her hand and it was burning hot.  She fancied if she could hold it  into the moonlight that would cool it.  So she got out of bed, without  waking the nurse who lay at the other end of the room, and went to the  window.  When she looked out she saw one of the men-at-arms walking in  the garden with the moonlight glancing on his armour.  She was just  going to tap on the window and call him, for she wanted to tell him all  about it, when she bethought herself that that might wake Lootie, and  she would put her into her bed again.  So she resolved to go to the  window of another room, and call him from there.  It was so much nicer  to have somebody to talk to than to lie awake in bed with the burning  pain in her hand.  She opened the door very gently and went through the  nursery, which did not look into the garden, to go to the other window.  But when she came to the foot of the old staircase there was the moon  shining down from some window high up, and making the worm-eaten oak  look very strange and delicate and lovely.  In a moment she was putting  her little feet one after the other in the silvery path up the stair,  looking behind as she went, to see the shadow they made in the middle  of the silver.  Some little girls would have been afraid to find  themselves thus alone in the middle of the night, but Irene was a  princess.    As she went slowly up the stair, not quite sure that she was not  dreaming, suddenly a great longing woke up in her heart to try once  more whether she could not find the old lady with the silvery hair. 'If  she is a dream,' she said to herself, 'then I am the likelier to find  her, if I am dreaming.'    So up and up she went, stair after stair, until she Came to the many  rooms--all just as she had seen them before.  Through passage after  passage she softly sped, comforting herself that if she should lose her  way it would not matter much, because when she woke she would find  herself in her own bed with Lootie not far off. But, as if she had  known every step of the way, she walked straight to the door at the  foot of the narrow stair that led to the tower.    'What if I should realreality-really find my beautiful old grandmother  up there!' she said to herself as she crept up the steep steps.    When she reached the top she stood a moment listening in the dark, for  there was no moon there.  Yes! it was! it was the hum of the  spinning-wheel!  What a diligent grandmother to work both day and  night!  She tapped gently at the door.    'Come in, Irene,'said the sweet voice.    The princess opened the door and entered.  There was the moonlight  streaming in at the window, and in the middle of the moonlight sat the  old lady in her black dress with the white lace, and her silvery hair  mingling with the moonlight, so that you could not have told which was  which.  'Come in, Irene,' she said again.  'Can you tell me what I am  spinning?'    'She speaks,' thought Irene, 'just as if she had seen me five minutes  ago, or yesterday at the farthest. --No,' she answered; 'I don't know  what you are spinning.  Please, I thought you were a dream.  Why  couldn't I find you before, great-great-grandmother?'    'That you are hardly old enough to understand.  But you would have  found me sooner if you hadn't come to think I was a dream.  I will give  you one reason though why you couldn't find me.  I didn't want you to  find me.'    'Why, please?'    'Because I did not want Lootie to know I was here.'    'But you told me to tell Lootie.'    'Yes.  But I knew Lootie would not believe you.  If she were to see me  sitting spinning here, she wouldn't believe me, either.'    'Why?'    'Because she couldn't.  She would rub her eyes, and go away and say she  felt queer, and forget half of it and more, and then say it had been  all a dream.'    'Just like me,' said Irene, feeling very much ashamed of herself.    'Yes, a good deal like you, but not just like you; for you've come  again; and Lootie wouldn't have come again.  She would have said, No,  no--she had had enough of such nonsense.'    'Is it naughty of Lootie, then?'    'It would be naughty of you.  I've never done anything for Lootie.'    'And you did wash my face and hands for me,' said Irene, beginning to  cry.    The old lady smiled a sweet smile and said:    'I'm not vexed with you, my child--nor with Lootie either.  But I don't  want you to say anything more to Lootie about me.  If she should ask  you, you must just be silent.  But I do not think she will ask you.'    All the time they talked the old lady kept on spinning.    'You haven't told me yet what I am spinning,' she said.    'Because I don't know.  It's very pretty stuff.'    It was indeed very pretty stuff.  There was a good bunch of it on the  distaff attached to the spinning-wheel, and in the moonlight it shone  like--what shall I say it was like?  It was not white enough for  silver--yes, it was like silver, but shone grey rather than white, and  glittered only a little.  And the thread the old lady drew out from it  was so fine that Irene could hardly see it. 'I am spinning this for  you, my child.'    'For me!  What am I to do with it, please?'    'I will tell you by and by.  But first I will tell you what it is. It  is spider-web--of a particular kind.  My pigeons bring it me from over  the great sea.  There is only one forest where the spiders live who  make this particular kind--the finest and strongest of any.  I have  nearly finished my present job.  What is on the rock now will be  enough.  I have a week's work there yet, though,' she added, looking at  the bunch.    'Do you work all day and all night, too,  great-great-great-great-grandmother?' said the princess, thinking to be  very polite with so many greats.    'I am not quite so great as all that,' she answered, smiling almost  merrily.  'If you call me grandmother, that will do.  No, I don't work  every night--only moonlit nights, and then no longer than the moon  shines upon my wheel.  I shan't work much longer tonight.'    'And what will you do next, grandmother?' 'Go to bed.  Would you like  to see my bedroom?'    'Yes, that I should.'    'Then I think I won't work any longer tonight.  I shall be in good  time.'    The old lady rose, and left her wheel standing just as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7099"],[0,"A Trip to Manitoba (#10)"],[1,"nearly four o clock when our waggon arrived--a springless vehicle  with three narrow seats, and drawn by two broken winded steeds.    After packing all our _impedimenta_ in the waggon there was  literally no room for us. What was to be done? Between our efforts to  make the driver, a stupid, tipsy French half-breed, understand English by  screaming it as loud as we could, the variety of our baggage, and the  curiosity of the passers by, we soon had a small crowd of interested  listeners and apparently sympathizing friends. Finally the livery stable  keeper made his appearance, and after some discussion agreed to exchange  that waggon for a larger one. Jumping into it, he lashed the horses, who  went at a furious pace down the street, proving their powers, but, alas,  scattering the half packed contents of the waggon--rugs, cushions,  blankets, tin kettles, and pails--at irregular intervals over the road.  In half an hour a larger vehicle was brought, and we hastily repacked,  receiving contributions of our property from every one who passed while  the operation was going on, so that it was late in the afternoon before  we left Winnipeg. When we arrived at the river, of course the ferry-boat  was on the opposite side, and we had to wait for its return, which seemed  the climax to the day's worries. We growled audibly, feeling that we were  entitled to do so, having had enough provocation to ruffle the most  angelic tempers. With scarcely room to sit, and nowhere, to speak of, to  put our feet, bodily discomfort helped to put us out of humour.    Can you imagine a three-seated waggon, containing a load of valises,  travelling-bags, a tin box of edibles for a week's journey, tents,  blankets, pans, kettles, pails, a box of earth filled with bedding  plants, a bundle of currant bush slips, a box of cats--being _the_  cat and five kittens--a box of family silver, engineers' instruments,  wraps of every description, provender for the horses, a bag of bread, the  driver's own provisions (it was part of the bargain that he was to \"find\"  himself), loose articles of all kinds, thrown in at the last moment, five  adults, two children, one small dog and an unhappy-looking canary? This  motley assemblage was stowed away as well as possible, the kettles and  pails being hung at the back and sides, after the fashion of the  travelling tinkers' carts. There certainly was a very emigrant-like  appearance about the whole thing, in spite of the tasteful trimming of  our shade hats.    The ferry-boat came for us at last, and as we drove over the prairie at a  moderate rate, delays having become things of the past, we were for the  next hour almost merry. This transient joy was soon dispelled by our  driver, who, without any warning, turned off the road through some swampy  ground. Pulling up suddenly before an apparently unbroken line of trees,  he craned his neck first one way and then the other in search of an  opening, unheeding the expostulations in French and English with which he  was assailed, until, finding what he sought, and nicking his whip over  the horses' ears, he condescended to reply, \"_Je fais le detour!_  Bad, _voila!_\" Then, urging his horses on, he charged into the  bushes, and drove along what had been once a cart trail (one could hardly  call it a road), overgrown with underbrush. Long branches met overhead,  and we were kept busy, alternately warding them, off our faces and  holding on to our seats--for the track was a succession of uneven hills,  hollows, and short turns, with which our driver seemed as unacquainted as  ourselves.    About six o'clock we came to the high-road, which crossed the end of our  track--the highroad that has cost our country over thirteen million  dollars--the far-famed and much-talked-of Dawson road. It was some two  feet higher than our rough track, and separated from it by a large mud  puddle, in which, after a lurch to one side and a violent jerk from the  horses, the waggon-wheels sank on the other. A volley of oaths was  discharged by our half-breed, followed by a crack of his long whip, and a  sharp struggle, and then the near horse fell back on his haunches and we  stuck fast. Down rolled the best valise, out sprang Jehu, carrying with  him into the mud our biggest blanket. Mr. C----, in slippers, sat on the  top of the waggon demanding his boots, which where _somewhere_ at  the bottom; somebody else was searching wildly for a rope and axe, which  proved to be _nowhere_; everybody was giving a different opinion on  the best means of extricating ourselves, only uniting in one thing,  namely, abuse of the driver, who stood knee-deep in mud, hitching up his  trousers and muttering something about _le détour_. We women,  meantime, tried to quiet the screaming children, and prevent the  \"unconsidered trifles\" which filled the corners of the waggon from  falling out--a duty not unattended with danger, as pussy, on guard over  her nursery, and excited by the general _bouleversement_, gave a  spiteful claw to any foot or hand which approached too near her box.    No rope, axe, nor chain, could be found; there was nothing but mud on  every side to unload in, and not a house for miles to shelter us for the  night. Fortunately, before very long a waggon passed on the high-road,  whose occupants were a kindly Irishman, his wife, and child.    \"Faith, is it help ye want, yer honour? It's meself never refused help to  any man,\" said Paddy; and jumping down, he produced a chain. Fastening  the tongue of the waggon to one end, and the horses to the other, he  drove them up to the high-road, where, having firmer foothold, a few  pulls drew us out of the mud-hole. We thanked the old man for his help,  but saw him and his chain depart with regret. Having better horses and a  lighter load, he soon left us far behind.    On we jogged, sometimes on the road, but more often off it, driving  through every clump of trees that grew in our way, as the roots gave some  firmness to the swampy ground. Now and then, when returning to the road,  the waggon would almost stick, but, after a lunge, pull, and struggle,  attended by a volley of French from our Jehu and a screech from the  women, it righted itself again. A little later we passed the teams that  had left Winnipeg so long before us in the morning; one of them was stuck  deep in the mud, and the drivers were just parting company--the first, a  French Canadian, declining to help the second, an Irish Canadian boy,  whose good-natured face was a picture of dismay, as he stood  contemplating the scene of disaster. The Frenchman declared that he had  stuck three times, and had to unload both teams twice, and he wasn't  going to do it again; so he whipped up his horse and left poor young  \"Stick-in-the-Mud,\" as we dubbed him, to his fate. Promising to send a  yoke of oxen from McQuade's, five miles further on, where we intended  putting up for the night, we also left him, but not without regret. I  could not help feeling sorry for the poor boy out there alone on the  prairie, perhaps for the whole night, as it was by no means certain that  the hoped-for yoke of oxen would be forthcoming. But the lad was so  civil, and evidently so determined to make the best of things, that  fortune favoured him. A mile further on we met a long train of carts, and  Mr. C---- shouted to the driver of the first to go and help  \"Stick-in-the-Mud,\" promising to pay him for his services. By this time  it was getting dark, the mosquitoes were troublesome, and the children  were hungry and cross, and we joyfully hailed the first glimmer of the  lights at McQuade's. But though in sight of the haven where we would be,  our troubles were not yet over. Crossing a broken culvert not half a mile  from the house, one of the horses fell in, and we all had to get out and  walk, an annoyance which we felt to be the \"last straw\" on our  much-enduring backs.    McQuade's is merely a farmhouse on the main road. But in the usual  condition of those roads it is the first stopping-place from Winnipeg,  and McQuade's, or \"Little Pointe du Chêne,\" as it is sometimes called, is  familiar to all the engineers on the staff of that part of the Canada  Pacific Railway. The yard was full of the teams which had left Winnipeg  the day before, and the kitchen, or general living room, was crowded with  teamsters, who, however, when we appeared, withdrew to a dark little  cook-house a few yards from the door.    The room vacated for us was low-roofed, with unplastered ceiling, whose  rafters were hung with bunches of garden herbs. Two narrow windows were  set sideways in the wall, their deep window-seats serving as bookcase and  sideboard: holding the Bible and almanac, the old lady's best bonnet, a  pot or two of preserves, a nosegay of spring flowers, and a tea-caddy. An  old-fashioned four-post bedstead stood in one corner, covered with a  patchwork quilt; in another was an impromptu bed, spread on the floor,  and occupied by a woman and two children, apparently asleep. A table,  covered with oil-cloth, with some cups and saucers on it, stood between  the bed and a dresser cupboard, containing rows of shining milk-pans,  piled one on the top of the other and separated by a board. Behind the  house door a flight of narrow steps led \"up ter chamber,\" as the old  woman in the rocking-chair informed us; and underneath these stairs was a  primitive washing apparatus, consisting of a bench holding a basin and  two wooden pails, with a long towel hanging from a stick.    The farmer bustled in and out, greeting some of us as old friends,  summoning Alice, the maid-of-all-work--a down-trodden, stupid-looking  girl of fourteen--to make up the fire and get the kettle boiling, and  putting his head into the doorway, \"just to tell the missus,\" as he  ushered us in. \"The missus,\" a kindly-looking old Irishwoman in a white  cap and kerchief, wriggled over in her chair to greet us, for she was  \"set fast by the "]]]
