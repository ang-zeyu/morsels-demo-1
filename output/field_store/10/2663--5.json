Their chief, I am proud to say; but  without them, I should be powerless. Without one of them near me, by the  side of the murdered Marat, I could not have rid myself of the ring in  time, before other rough hands searched me to my skin. Without them, I  could not have taken Madeleine Lannoy's child from out that terrible  hell, to which a miscreant's lustful revenge had condemned the poor  innocent. But while citizen Chauvelin, racked with triumph as well as  with anxiety, was rushing from the Leridans' house to yours, and thence  to the Abbaye prison, to gloat over his captive enemy, the League of the  Scarlet Pimpernel carefully laid and carried out its plans at leisure.  Disguised as men of the Surete, we took advantage of the Leridans'  terror to obtain access into the house. Frightened to death by our  warnings, as well as by citizen Chauvelin's threats, they not only  admitted us into their house, but actually placed Madeleine Lannoy's  child in our charge. Then they went contentedly to bed, and we, before  the real men of the Surete arrived upon the scene, were already safely  out of the way. My gallant English friends are some way out of Paris by  now, escorting Madeleine Lannoy and her child into safety. They will  return to Paris, citizen,\" continued the audacious adventurer, with a  laugh full of joy and of unconquerable vitality, \"and be my henchmen as  before in many an adventure which will cause you and citizen Chauvelin  to gnash your teeth with rage. But I myself will remain in Paris,\" he  concluded lightly. \"Yes, in Paris; under your very nose, and entirely at  your service!\"    The next second he was gone, and Fouquier-Tinville was left to marvel if  the whole apparition had not been a hideous dream. Only there was no  doubt that he was gagged and tied to a chair with cords: and here his  wife found him, an hour later, when she woke from her first sleep,  anxious because he had not yet come to bed.          II    A QUESTION OF PASSPORTS      Bibot was very sure of himself. There never was, never had been, there  never would be again another such patriotic citizen of the Republic as  was citizen Bibot of the Town Guard.    And because his patriotism was so well known among the members of the  Committee of Public Safety, and his uncompromising hatred of the  aristocrats so highly appreciated, citizen Bibot had been given the most  important military post within the city of Paris.    He was in command of the Porte Montmartre, which goes to prove how  highly he was esteemed, for, believe me, more treachery had been going  on inside and out of the Porte Montmartre than in any other quarter of  Paris. The last commandant there, citizen Ferney, was guillotined for  having allowed a whole batch of aristocrats--traitors to the Republic,  all of them--to slip through the Porte Montmartre and to find safety  outside the walls of Paris. Ferney pleaded in his defence that these  traitors had been spirited away from under his very nose by the devil's  agency, for surely that meddlesome Englishman who spent his time in  rescuing aristocrats--traitors, all of them--from the clutches of Madame  la Guillotine must be either the devil himself, or at any rate one of  his most powerful agents.    \"Nom de Dieu! just think of his name! The Scarlet Pimpernel they call  him! No one knows him by any other name! and he is preternaturally tall  and strong and superhumanly cunning! And the power which he has of being  transmuted into various personalities--rendering himself quite  unrecognisable to the eyes of the most sharp-seeing patriot of France,  must of a surety be a gift of Satan!\"    But the Committee of Public Safety refused to listen to Ferney's  explanations. The Scarlet Pimpernel was only an ordinary mortal--an  exceedingly cunning and meddlesome personage it is true, and endowed  with a superfluity of wealth which enabled him to break the thin crust  of patriotism that overlay the natural cupidity of many Captains of the  Town Guard--but still an ordinary man for all that! and no true lover of  the Republic should allow either superstitious terror or greed to  interfere with the discharge of his duties which at the Porte Montmartre  consisted in detaining any and every person--aristocrat, foreigner, or  otherwise traitor to the Republic--who could not give a satisfactory  reason for desiring to leave Paris. Having detained such persons, the  patriot's next duty was to hand them over to the Committee of Public  Safety, who would then decide whether Madame la Guillotine would have  the last word over them or not.    And the guillotine did nearly always have the last word to say, unless  the Scarlet Pimpernel interfered.    The trouble was, that that same accursed Englishman interfered at times  in a manner which was positively terrifying. His impudence, certes,  passed all belief. Stories of his daring and of his impudence were  abroad which literally made the lank and greasy hair of every patriot  curl with wonder. 'Twas even whispered--not too loudly, forsooth--that  certain members of the Committee of Public Safety had measured their  skill and valour against that of the Englishman and emerged from the  conflict beaten and humiliated, vowing vengeance which, of a truth, was  still slow in coming.    Citizen Chauvelin, one of the most implacable and unyielding members of  the Committee, was known to have suffered overwhelming shame at the  hands of that daring gang, of whom the so-called Scarlet Pimpernel was  the accredited chief. Some there were who said that citizen Chauvelin  had for ever forfeited his prestige, and even endangered his head by  measuring his well-known astuteness against that mysterious League of  spies.    But then Bibot was different!    He feared neither the devil, nor any Englishman. Had the latter the  strength of giants and the protection of every power of evil, Bibot was  ready for him. Nay! he was aching for a tussle, and haunted the purlieus  of the Committees to obtain some post which would enable him to come to  grips with the Scarlet Pimpernel and his League.    Bibot's zeal and perseverance were duly rewarded, and anon he was  appointed to the command of the guard at the Porte Montmartre.    A post of vast importance as aforesaid; so much so, in fact, that no  less a person than citizen Jean Paul Marat himself came to speak with  Bibot on that third day of Nivose in the year I of the Republic, with a  view to impressing upon him the necessity of keeping his eyes open, and  of suspecting every man, woman, and child indiscriminately until they  had proved themselves to be true patriots.    \"Let no one slip through your fingers, citizen Bibot,\" Marat admonished  with grim earnestness. \"That accursed Englishman is cunning and  resourceful, and his impudence surpasses that of the devil himself.\"    \"He'd better try some of his impudence on me!\" commented Bibot with a  sneer, \"he'll soon find out that he no longer has a Ferney to deal with.  Take it from me, citizen Marat, that if a batch of aristocrats escape  out of Paris within the next few days, under the guidance of the d--d  Englishman, they will have to find some other way than the Porte  Montmartre.\"    \"Well said, citizen!\" commented Marat. \"But be watchful to-night ...  to-night especially. The Scarlet Pimpernel is rampant in Paris just  now.\"    \"How so?\"    \"The ci-devant Duc and Duchesse de Montreux and the whole of their  brood--sisters, brothers, two or three children, a priest, and several  servants--a round dozen in all, have been condemned to death. The  guillotine for them to-morrow at daybreak! Would it could have been  to-night,\" added Marat, whilst a demoniacal leer contorted his face  which already exuded lust for blood from every pore. \"Would it could  have been to-night. But the guillotine has been busy; over four hundred  executions to-day ... and the tumbrils are full--the seats bespoken in  advance--and still they come.... But to-morrow morning at daybreak  Madame la Guillotine will have a word to say to the whole of the  Montreux crowd!\"    \"But they are in the Conciergerie prison surely, citizen! out of the  reach of that accursed Englishman?\"    \"They are on their way, an I mistake not, to the prison at this moment.  I came straight on here after the condemnation, to which I listened with  true joy. Ah, citizen Bibot! the blood of these hated aristocrats is  good to behold when it drips from the blade of the guillotine. Have a  care, citizen Bibot, do not let the Montreux crowd escape!\"    \"Have no fear, citizen Marat! But surely there is no danger! They have  been tried and condemned! They are, as you say, even now on their  way--well guarded, I presume--to the Conciergerie prison!--to-morrow at  daybreak, the guillotine! What is there to fear?\"    \"Well! well!\" said Marat, with a slight tone of hesitation, \"it is best,  citizen Bibot, to be over-careful these times.\"    Even whilst Marat spoke his face, usually so cunning and so vengeful,  had suddenly lost its look of devilish cruelty which was almost  superhuman in the excess of its infamy, and a greyish hue--suggestive of  terror--had spread over the sunken cheeks. He clutched Bibot's arm, and  leaning over the table he whispered in his ear:    \"The Public Prosecutor had scarce finished his speech to-day, judgment  was being pronounced, the spectators were expectant and still, only the  Montreux woman and some of the females and children were blubbering and  moaning, when"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5817"],[0,"The Clockmaker — or, the Sayings and Doings of Samuel Slick, of Slickville (#10)"],[1,"hansom sight too, near  about a whole congregation of young galls) Banks used to  say, 'I vow, young ladies, I wish I had five hundred arms  to reciprocate one with each of you; but I reckon I have  a heart big enough for you all; its a whapper, you may  depend, and every mite and morsel of it at your service.'  Well, how you do act, Mr. Banks, half a thousand little  clipper clapper tongues would say, all at the same time,  and their dear little eyes sparklin, like so many stars  twinklin of a frosty night.    Well, when I last see'd him, he was all skin and bone,  like a horse turned out to die. He was tetotally defleshed,  a mere walkin skeleton.

No, says he, shakin his head, I hope I have  too much clear grit in me to take on so bad for that.  What under the sun, is it, then? said I. Why, says he,  I made a bet the fore part of summer with Leftenant Oby  Knowles, that I could shoulder the best bower of the  Constitution frigate. I won my bet, but the Anchor was  so eternal heavy it broke my heart. Sure enough he did  die that very fall, and he was the only instance I ever  heerd tell of A BROKEN HEART.          No. XI    Cumberland Oysters Produce Melancholy Forebodings.    The 'soft sawder' of the Clockmaker had operated effectually  on the beauty of Amherst, our lovely hostess of Pugwash's  Inn: indeed, I am inclined to think, with Mr. Slick, that  'the road to a woman's heart lies through her child,'  from the effect produced upon her by the praises bestowed  on her infant boy. I was musing on this feminine  susceptibility to flattery, when the door opened, and  Mrs. Pugwash entered, dressed in her sweetest smiles and  her best cap, an auxiliary by no means required by her  charms, which, like an Italian sky, when unclouded, are  unrivalled in splendor. Approaching me, she said, with  an irresistible smile, would you like Mr. ---, (here  there was a pause, a hiatus, evidently intended for me  to fill up with my name; but that no person knows, nor  do I intend they shall; at Medley's Hotel, in Halifax,  I was known as the stranger in No. 1. The attention that  incognito procured for me, the importance it gave me in  the eyes of the master of the house, its lodgers and  servants, is indescribable. It is only great people who  travel incog. State travelling is inconvenient and slow;  the constant weight of form and etiquette oppresses at  once the strength and the spirits. It is pleasant to  travel unobserved, to stand at ease, or exchange the full  suit for the undress coat and fatigue jacket. Wherever  too there is mystery there is importance; there is no  knowing for whom I may be mistaken--but let me once give  my humble cognomen and occupation, and I sink immediately  to my own level, to a plebeian station and a vulgar name:  not even my beautiful hostess, nor my inquisitive friend,  the Clockmaker, who calls me 'Squire,' shall extract that  secret!) Would you like, Mr. ---. Indeed, I would, said  I, Mrs. Pugwash; pray be seated, and tell me what it is.  Would you like a dish of superior Shittyacks for supper?  Indeed I would, said I, again laughing; but pray tell me  what it is? Laws me! said she with a stare, where have  you been all your days, that you never heerd of our  Shittyack Oysters? I thought every body had heerd of  them. I beg pardon, said I, but I understood at Halifax,  that the only Oysters in this part of the world were  found on the shores of Prince Edward Island. Oh! dear  no, said our hostess, they are found all along the coast  from Shittyack, through Bay of Vartes, away up to Ramshag.  The latter we seldom get, though the best; there is no  regular conveyance, and when they do come, they are  generally shelled and in kegs, and never in good order.  I have not had a real good Ramshag in my house these two  years, since Governor Maitland was here; he was amazin  fond of them, and Lawyer Talkemdeaf sent his carriage  there on purpose to procure them fresh for him. Now we  can't GET THEM, but we have the Shittyacks in perfection;  say the word, and they shall be served up immediately.  A good dish and an unexpected dish is most acceptable,  and certainly my American friend and myself did ample  justice to the Oysters, which, if they have not so  classical a name, have quite as good a flavor as their  far famed brethren of Milton. Mr. Slick eat so heartily,  that when he resumed his conversation, he indulged in  the most melancholy forebodings.    Did you see that are nigger, said he, that removed the  Oyster shells? well, he's one of our Chesapickers, one  of General Cuffy's slaves. I wish Admiral Cockburn had  a taken them all off our hands at the same rate. We made  a pretty good sale of them are black cattle, I guess, to  the British; I wish we were well rid of 'em all. THE  BLACKS AND THE WHITES in the States show their teeth and  snarl, they are jist ready to fall to. The PROTESTANTS  and CATHOLICS begin to lay back their ears, and turn tail  for kickin. THE ABOLITIONISTS AND PLANTERS are at it like  two bulls in a pastur. MOB LAW AND LYNCH LAW are working  like yeast in a barrell, and frothing at the bung hole.  NULLIFICATION AND TARIFF are like a charcoal pit, all  covered up, but burning inside, and sending out smoke at  every crack, enough to stifle a horse. GENERAL GOVERNMENT  AND STATE GOVERNMENT every now and then square off and  sparr, and the first blow given will bring a genuine  set-to. SURPLUS REVENUE is another bone of contention;  like a shin of beef thrown among a pack of dogs, it will  set the whole on 'em by the ears. You have heerd tell of  cotton rags dipt in turpentine, hav'nt you, how they  produce combustion? Well, I guess we have the elements  of spontaneous combustion among us in abundance; when it  does break out, if you don't see an eruption of human  gore, worse than Etna lava, then I'm mistaken. There'll  be the very devil to pay, that's a fact. I expect the  blacks will butcher the Southern whites, and the  northerners will have to turn out and butcher them again;  and all this shoot, hang, cut, stab, and burn business  will sweeten our folks' temper, as raw meat does that of  a dog--it fairly makes me sick to think on it. The  explosion may clear the air again, and all be tranquil  once more, but its an even chance if it don't leave us  the three steam boat options, to be blown sky high, to  be scalded to death or drowned. If this sad picture you  have drawn, be indeed true to nature, how does your  country, said I, appear so attractive, as to draw to it  so large a portion of our population? It tante its  attraction, said the Clockmaker, its nothin but its power  of suction; it is a great whirlpool--a great vortex--it  drags all the straw, and chips and floatin sticks, drift  wood and trash into it. The small crafts are sucked in,  and whirl round and round like a squirrel in a cage--  they'll never come out. Bigger ones pass through at  certain times of tide, and can come in and out with good  pilotage, as they do at HELL GATE up the Sound. You  astonish me, said I, beyond measure; both your previous  conversations with me, and the concurrent testimony of  all my friends who have visited the States, give a  different view of it. YOUR FRIENDS! said the Clockmaker,  with such a tone of ineffable contempt, that I felt a  strong inclination to knock him down for his insolence  --your friends! Ensigns and leftenants, I guess, from  the British marchin regiments in the Colonies, that run  over five thousand miles of country in five weeks, on  leave of absence, and then return, lookin as wise as the  monkey that had seen the world. When they get back they  are so chock full of knowledge of the Yankees, that it  runs over of itself, like a Hogshead of molasses rolled  about in hot weather--a white froth and scum bubbles out  of the bung; wishy washy trash they call tours, sketches,  travels, letters, and what not; vapid stuff, jist sweet  enough to catch flies, cockroaches, and half fledged  galls. It puts me in mind of my French. I larnt French  at night school one winter, of our minister, Joshua  Hopewell (he was the most larned man of the age, for he  taught himself een amost every language in Europe); well,  next spring, when I went to Boston, I met a Frenchman,  and I began to jabber away French to him: 'Polly woes a  french say,' says I. I don't understand Yankee yet, says  he. You dont understand! says I, why its French. I guess  you didn't expect to hear such good French, did you, away  down east here? but we speak it real well, and its  generally allowed we speak English, too, better than the  British. Oh, says he, you one very droll Yankee, dat  very good joke, Sare; you talk Indian and call it French.  But, says I, Mister Mount shear; it is French, I vow;  real merchantable, without wainy edge or shakes--all  clear stuff; it will pass survey in any market--its ready  stuck and seasoned. Oh, very like, says he, bowin as  polite as a black waiter at New OrLEENS, very like, only  I never heerd it afore; oh, very good French dat--CLEAR  STUFF, no doubt, but I no understand--its all my fault,  I dare say, Sare.    Thinks I to myself a nod is as good as a wink to a blind  horse, I see how the cat jumps--Minister knows so many  languages he hant been particular enough to keep 'em in  separate parcels and mark 'em on the back, and they've  got mixed, and sure enough I found my French was so  overrun with other sorts, that it was better to loose  the whole crop than to go to weedin, for as fast as I  pulled up any strange seedlin, it would grow right up  agin as quick as wink, if there was the least bit of root  in the"]]]
