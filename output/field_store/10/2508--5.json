Below this one there is another cavity which  contains a portion of the mouth parts when they are retracted. At each  side of the mouth in front of the base of the sucking organs, are the  two jaws (mandibles) each with a little tuft of hair on the outer side.  The jaws move freely to and from each other, sideways instead of up and  down as do the jaws of the higher animals. The sucking apparatus  consists of five pieces viz: two outermost pieces each tapering to a  fine point, two, each of which ends in three little joints and one in  the centre which projects beyond the others. It may be necessary to  spread these out with the needle, to see them well.    Separate the thorax from the rest of the body. Scrape off the hairs on  the back. Two principal grooves extend across the back, one near the  front and one near the hind margin. The thorax is composed of three  divisions and these grooves show where they are joined together. The  hind division bears the hind wings and the hind pair of legs; the middle  division, much the largest division of the three, bears the fore wings  and the middle pair of legs; and the foremost division is quite small  and bears only the front pair of legs.    Remove the wings of one side and examine in a drop of water with one and  one half inch power. The wings consist of a shining transparent membrane  strengthened by numerous horny veins running through it. Examine with  one half inch power. The membrane is seen to be covered with minute  hairs and little dots. On the front edge of the hind wing a short  distance from the outer end is a row of hooks. At a corresponding place  on the hind edge of the fore wing there is a thickening or ridge. When  flying, the hooks catch onto the ridge and thus the wings are held  together and act as one large wing.    Examine this grappling apparatus with one fourth inch power and with the  needles hook the wings together and pull them apart. If you look through  the magnifier while you do this you will get a good idea of the form of  the ridge and of how the hooks catch onto it. Remove one of the  forelegs, being sure that none remains attached to the body. Examine  with one and one half inch power. The extremity is armed with two claws;  then come four short joints followed by one about as long as the others  together. All these make up the foot. The next joint above is the shank,  then comes the thigh and then quite a small joint, the lower hip, and  lastly attached to the body is the upper hip.    Remove the last five joints of the foot (the claw part, and the other  four joints) examine with one third inch power. The claws have each a  branch projecting from the inner edge. Between the claws is a little  velvety pad. Each of the small joints is covered with short closely  appressed hairs and from the lower end of each joint project several  spines. Now examine the remaining long joint of the foot attached to the  shank. At the upper end of the inner side is a deep semicircular notch,  the upper portion of which is light colored. Beside the notch is a  peculiarly shaped movable spine which projects from the lower end of the  shank. This queer arrangement is what the bee uses to clean his feelers.  The reader has probably seen the operation performed by a bee or a wasp.  The leg is thrown over the feeler, the latter is grasped at that  particular bend of the leg where the cleansing apparatus is situated and  then drawn through from base to tip; and this is repeated several times  with each feeler.    Examine with one and one half inch power a leg from each of the other  pairs and compare the corresponding parts. They differ chiefly in size  and in the absence of the cleansing apparatus. You cannot fail to  admire the many beautiful forms of the different portions. On the outer  side of the hind shank is a smooth flattish surface destitute of hairs,  excepting a fringe of long ones at the margin. At this place may  sometimes be found a sticky mass of pollen intended for bee-bread.  Examine the abdomen with one and one half inch power. It is composed of  several wings. If some of the hairs are scraped off this will be shown  more clearly. From the hind extremity projects the sting.    We have far from exhausted all the beautiful and interesting points in  the make-up of a Bumble Bee, not even those that may be seen with the  limited powers of a simple microscope; but probably enough has been said  to show the reader that such things are well worthy of study and it is  hoped that enough directions have been given to render future use of the  instruments comparatively free from difficulty.      XV.--SOME LITTLE THINGS TO SEE.    There is no end to the beautiful and wonderful things one can see with  the simple microscope. Only a few of the more attractive and easily  obtained of these are now to be mentioned.    To begin with, there are ever so many pretty flowers to look at. The  asterworts, that is, such flowers as the daisy, aster, golden rod,  dandelion and thistle, are particularly full of beauty. The blossoms are  all made up of a number of little flowers as in the dandelion; but the  shapes and colors and so forth, of the different kinds are exceedingly  various. Some, such as the asters and daisies, have two kinds of flowers  in the same blossom--flowers with strap-shaped corollas (like the  dandelion's) are arranged along the margin of the blossom, while in the  centre are little flowers with star-shaped corollas presenting a much  different appearance. Flowers of many of the Parsley Family, for  example wild carrot, wild parsnip and caraway, are quite odd. Very  pretty flowers are found among the grasses, sedges and common weeds. The  different trees as they bloom in spring--the maples, elms, willows,  poplars, sassafras and hosts of others--all have flowers that are  perfectly lovely. Most of these flowers need to be picked to pieces  under the magnifier to show up their full beauty. The parts of flowers,  both small and large ones, deserve attention. Frequently one meets with  remarkable forms.    Seeds are highly interesting. They are often handsomely marked with  series of pits or projections, grooves or ridges. One meets with many  curious appendages by means of which the seeds are carried off and sown  at a distance from the plant. Some, like the dandelion, have a parachute  attachment; others have wings to catch the wind, and others still are  covered with hooked spines whereby they become attached to the fur of  animals, there to remain until brushed off onto the ground.    Leaves and stems sometimes have on them beautiful hairs and oil-glands.  The wooly covering of common mullein, for example, is made up of  innumerable slender-branched hairs. These show best when a piece of the  leaf broken off is looked at edgewise.    If you examine the fruit-dots on the backs of the different kinds of  ferns you will be surprised to find how pretty they are and of how many  different shapes. Sometimes the fruit is not borne on the back of the  leaf but forms little clusters by themselves, which are sometimes at the  end of the fern, sometimes in the middle, sometimes on a separate stalk.    Mosses, lichens and sea-weeds are well worth looking at.    Early in the summer an exquisite little fungus called \"Cluster cups\" may  be found on the underside of barberry leaves. Hawthorn and other plants  have handsome fungi on them later in the season.    By observing closely while out in the fields or woods, one sees hovering  about in swarms, myriads of tiny insects. Under the lens some of them  are very odd, others very beautiful. The easiest way to catch these  little midgets, is to wet the palm of the hand and then sweep it among  them, or in the same way use a piece of sticky paper.    The study of the different parts of insects is one of the most  fascinating of the many uses of the Simple microscope. Although all  insects are made up on the same general plan and corresponding organs  occur in most of them, there is an endless variety in the forms under  which we see the different organs and the uses to which they are put.    Take for example the antennae. In the grasshopper it is long and  threadlike; in the butterflies always ending in a knob; in moths always  tapering to a point, although sometimes threadlike and sometimes much  branched, forming a beautiful plume; in the beetles, sometimes fan-like,  sometimes like a comb; and in other insects assuming still other forms.  Insects' eyes are often colored beautifully. A horse-fly's eyes are  striped. Butterflies' eyes have usually a soft liquid coloring, and  moths' eyes in the dark shine like little fiery beads.    The mouths of insects, such as beetles, grasshoppers and dragon flies,  have strong jaws for biting; flies, bugs, moths and butterflies, have  the mouth-parts transformed into sucking organs, while bees, wasps and  the like have both sucking organs for honey, and biting organs for  leaf-cutting, wood-tearing etc. as we saw was the case in the Bumble  Bee.    Butterflies' wings and moths' wings are covered with little scales of a  variety of shapes. These should be examined attached to the wing to show  their arrangement which is like that of shingles on a roof; but to show  their form they should be looked at when brushed from the wing onto a  piece of glass. Many other peculiarities may be noticed in the wings of  other kinds of insects.    Legs, the same as the other organs, have various forms, markings and  appendages, and so it is with the abdomen and its stings or its  egg-laying apparatus.    The hairs of \"Wooly Bears\" and caterpillars of that kind are peculiarly  branched.    The four hind pairs of feet in caterpillars are armed each with a row  of little hooks which are used in walking to get a firm hold. The larger  caterpillars show the hooks best.    Sometimes you will find pretty insect eggs on the underside of leaves or  on stems, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38440"],[0,"A Distributional Study of the Amphibians of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, México (#10)"],[1,"specimens from the isthmus, together with seven from central  Veracruz and one from Teapa, Tabasco, suggests an even closer  relationship. _Eleutherodactylus conspicuus_ was diagnosed by Taylor  and Smith (1945:567) as differing from _alfredi_ \"in lacking a tarsal  fold, in having shorter hind legs with the tibiotarsal articulation  reaching only to the nostril instead of beyond the tip of the snout;  the vomerine teeth barely reach the posterior level of the choanae.\"  The specimen from Teapa has the vomerine teeth reaching to the  posterior edge of the choanae; in the eight specimens from the isthmus  the teeth reach the posterior edge of the choanae in two and to the  middle of the choanae in six; in seven specimens from central Veracruz  the teeth reach the posterior edge of the choanae in two and to the  middle in five. The tibiotarsal articulation extends beyond the tip of  the snout in the specimen from Teapa and in two from central Veracruz;  in three specimens from the isthmus and in one from central Veracruz it  extends only to the nostril; in the others it extends to the snout. The  tarsal fold is absent in the specimen from Teapa, in three from the  isthmus, and in all those from central Veracruz; it is weakly present  in the others.    In the light of this evidence there seems to be little justification in  recognizing two species or even two subspecies in this group.  Consequently, _Eleutherodactylus conspicuus_ Taylor and Smith (1945) is  here placed in the synonymy of _Eleutherodactylus alfredi_ Boulenger  (1898), a species with a range extending from Cuautlapan and Potrero  Viejo in central Veracruz southward and eastward in forested habitats  to western El Peten, Guatemala.      =Eleutherodactylus natator= Taylor         _Veracruz_: 35 km. SE of Jesus Carranza (3); 38 km. S of       Jesus Carranza; 55 km. SE of Jesus Carranza.    The snout-vent length is 42.0 mm. in a male and averages 59.5 mm. in  three adult females. The tarsal fold is low and extends about half the  length of the tarsus; the first and second fingers are subequal in  length; the tibiotarsal articulation extends beyond the tip of the  snout. The patches of vomerine teeth lie between the posterior margins  of the choanae. The throat and belly are immaculate, and the soles of  the feet are dark. In the isthmus this species can be distinguished  from _Eleutherodactylus rugulosus_ by less rugose skin on the dorsum  and absence of dark ventral mottling.    The specimens reported here extend the known range of _natator_  eastward from Camotlan, Oaxaca; northward in Veracruz the species  inhabits foothills as far north as Huatusco.      =Eleutherodactylus rhodopis= Cope         _Oaxaca_: 30 km. N of Matias Romero; Rio Sarabia (5);       Tapanatepec (87); Tolosita (6); between Zanatepec and       Tapanatepec. _Veracruz_: 25 km. SE of Jesus Carranza; 35 km.       SE of Jesus Carranza (2); 22 km. SSW of Jesus Carranza; 20       km. ENE of Jesus Carranza (7); Minatitlan; Tapalapan (5).    For the purposes of the present study I am not recognizing  _Eleutherodactylus beati_, _E. dorsoconcolor_, and _E. venustus_ as  specifically, or even subspecifically distinct from the earlier named  _E. rhodopis_. Probably these are mere color varieties of a single  species.    In the dry season frogs of this species were in humid forests, where  they were most frequently found along small streams and in ravines. The  species is widespread in the Gulf lowlands, but does not occur on the  Plains of Tehuantepec. It does inhabit the Pacific slopes on the  foothills of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, the western part of which  extends into eastern Oaxaca near Tapanatepec.      =Eleutherodactylus rugulosus= Cope         _Oaxaca_: La Princesa (30); Modelo; Santa Lucia (10);       Tapanatepec (26); Tehuantepec (6); Tres Cruces (8).       _Veracruz_: Tapalapan (5).    In addition to the specimens from the lowlands of the isthmus, for the  purposes of the following discussion, I have included data on two  specimens from the southern slopes of the Sierra del Sur in Oaxaca  (Mirador and Chacalapa) and on several specimens from Los Tuxtlas in  Veracruz (Los Chaneques, 67; Salto de Eyipantla, 35; and San Andres  Tuxtla, 11).    Frogs of the _Eleutherodactylus rugulosus_ complex occur from southern  Veracruz and Sinaloa southward through Central America. Taylor  (1940:401) described _E. vocalis_ from Hacienda El Sabino, Michoacan;  Taylor and Smith (1945:580) described _E. avocalis_ from Tres Cruces,  Oaxaca. These have been considered as species distinct from  _rugulosus_, which is known to occur in Veracruz, Guerrero, and Chiapas  southward into Central America. Although the large number of specimens  collected in the isthmus does not aid in defining the ranges of the  taxa involved, these specimens do give some idea of the variation in  certain characters in a given population.    In specimens from Los Tuxtlas the tarsal fold is well-developed and  extends two-thirds to three-fourths the length of the tarsus; the  tibiotarsal articulation reaches the nostril and sometimes slightly  beyond the tip of the snout. In males the tympanum is nearly equal to  the diameter of the eye; in females it is about one-half the diameter  of the eye. The posterior surfaces of the thighs are dark brown or  black with whitish or cream-colored spots, flecks, or irregular  mottling. The tarsal fold is dark; the throat is pale in some  individuals, but in most is mottled with dark brown or gray flecks.  Individuals from La Princesa near the continental divide in Oaxaca show  the same variation in body proportions and development of the tarsal  fold. The posterior surfaces of the thighs are dark brown indistinctly  mottled with lighter brown. The throat is dark brown. Specimens from  the Pacific slopes of Oaxaca, including the Plains of Tehuantepec, have  dark brown thighs mottled with dusty cream. The tibiotarsal  articulation extends slightly beyond the tip of the snout in all  specimens. In males the tympanum is equal to about two-thirds the  diameter of the eye. Duellman (1958b:6) discussed the variation in  these characters in populations in Colima, Jalisco, and Michoacan.    Until the extent of variation of these characters is known throughout  the range of _rugulosus_, the recognition of populations either as  species or subspecies seems superfluous. Consequently, I have used the  oldest name; this does not necessarily imply, however, that all  populations of _rugulosus_ (_sensu lato_) are conspecific.    Of the 200 specimens examined, 15 have a middorsal stripe that is red  or yellow. The iris varies from a copper to a dark golden color and  shines bright red at night. Many of the specimens are juveniles; these  were collected in the dry season, at which time they were found beneath  rocks along streams, in road culverts where there was some water, and  in holes in banks and cliffs.      =Microbatrachylus pygmaeus= Taylor         _Oaxaca_: La Princesa (5); Matias Romero (9); Rio Sarabia       (41); Tolosita (2). _Veracruz_: Jesus Carranza; 20 km. ENE       of Jesus Carranza.    The specimens listed above vary widely in color patterns; some of the  patterns are characteristic of certain named \"species\": _albolabris_,  _imitator_, _lineatissimus_, and _minimus_. The large series from the  Rio Sarabia contains all of the color patterns; this series was  obtained in one small ravine in the rainforest. At least in the  isthmian region, this species does not inhabit the Pacific slopes and  lowlands.      =Syrrhophus leprus= Cope         _Oaxaca_: 33 km. N of Matias Romero; Santa Efigenia.       _Veracruz_: San Lorenzo.    Although the type locality is stated to be Santa Efigenia on the  Pacific slopes of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas in eastern Oaxaca, the  type specimen probably came from the northern slopes of the mountains.  All other known specimens are from the Gulf slopes and lowlands, and  from several localities in Los Tuxtlas. Details concerning specimens  from the isthmus and other parts of the range were given by Duellman  (1958c:8).    Smith (1947:408) reported a specimen of _Syrrhophus verruculatus_  Peters from San Lorenzo, Veracruz; he stated that this specimen (USNM  123530) could not be _S. leprus_, because it had a gray belly, nor _S.  cystignathoides_, because of the dark and light dorsal coloration.  Firschein (1954:57) in his review of the species of _Syrrhophus_ in  eastern Mexico referred the specimen to _S. cystignathoides_. The  specimen is in poor condition. Nevertheless, specific determination is  possible. Numerous specimens of _S. leprus_ from Los Tuxtlas have gray  bellies; some have heavier pigmentation than the specimen from San  Lorenzo. In preservative the dorsum is dark brown with lighter  mottling. There is little doubt that the specimen from San Lorenzo is  a _Syrrhophus leprus_, an abundant and widespread species in the  humid Gulf lowlands of southern Mexico, and not _verruculatus_, if  this is a valid species (see Firschein, _op. cit._:58), and not  _cystignathoides_, a species known from San Luis Potosi southward to  central Veracruz.      =Syrrhophus pipilans pipilans= Taylor         _Oaxaca_: Cerro Arenal; Cerro San Pedro; 6 km. N of Chivela;       14 km. W of Tehuantepec (2).    In the isthmian region this frog is known only from the Pacific slopes  and the Plains of Tehuantepec. Males call from the ground and from  trees to heights of about four meters. The call is a single, high, long  \"peep.\"      =Engystomops pustulosus= Cope         _Oaxaca_: Chivela; La Ventosa (3); Santo Domingo;       Tapanatepec (14); Tehuantepec (61); Union Hidalgo (62).       _Veracruz_: Acayucan; Cuatotolapam (7); 10 km. SE of       Hueyapan (11).    Large congregations were breeding at Tehuantepec on July 5, at  Tapanatepec on July 13, and at Hueyapan on July 24, 1956. The frogs  were breeding in open ponds in scrub forest and savanna; none was found  in the"]]]
