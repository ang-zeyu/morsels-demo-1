Here chance may bring together those who but a few hours  before were strangers to each other. The ordeal of a moment, a single  word, may separate hearts long united; sudden confidences are often  forced by necessity, and invincible suspicions frequently held in  secret. As a witty woman once remarked: \"They often play a comedy, to  avoid a tragedy!\" That which has never been uttered, is yet incessantly  divined and understood. Generalities are often used to sharpen  interrogation, while concealing its drift; the most evasive replies  are carefully listened to, like the ringing of metal, as a test of the  quality. Often, when in appearance pleading for others, the suitor is  urging his own cause; and the most graceful flattery may be only the  veil of disguised exactions.    But caution and attention become at last wearisome to natures naturally  expansive and candid, and a tiresome frivolity, surprising enough before  the secret of its reckless indifference has been divined, mingles with  the most spiritual refinement, the most poetic sentiments, the most real  causes for intense suffering, as if to mock and jeer at all reality. It  is difficult to analyze or appreciate justly this frivolity, as it  is sometimes real, sometimes only assumed. It makes use of confusing  replies and strange resources to conceal the truth. It is sometimes  justly, sometimes wrongfully regarded as a kind of veil of motley, whose  fantastic tissue needs only to be slightly torn to reveal more than one  hidden or sleeping quality under the variegated folds of gossamer. It  often follows from such causes, that eloquence becomes only a sort of  grave badinage, sparkling with spangles like the play of fireworks,  though the heart of the discourse may contain nothing earnest; while the  lightest raillery, thrown out apparently at random, may perhaps be most  sadly serious. Bitter and intense thought follows closely upon the  steps of the most tempestuous gayety; nothing indeed remains absolutely  superficial, though nothing is presented without an artificial  polish. In the discussions constantly occurring in this country, where  conversation is an art cultivated to the highest degree, and occupying  much time, there are always those present, who, whether the topic  discussed be grave or gay, can pass in a moment from smiles to tears,  from joy to sorrow, leaving the keenest observer in doubt which is most  real, so difficult is it to discern the fictitious from the true.    In such varying modes of thought, where ideas shift like quick sands  upon the shores of the sea, they are rarely to be found again at the  exact point where they were left. This fact is in itself sufficient to  give interest to interviews otherwise insignificant. We have been taught  this in Paris by some natives of Poland, who astonished the Parisians by  their skill in \"fencing in paradox;\" an art in which every Pole is more  or less skillful, as he has felt more or less interest or amusement in  its cultivation. But the inimitable skill with which they are constantly  able to alternate the garb of truth or fiction (like touchstones, more  certain when least suspected, the one always concealed under the garb of  the other), the force which expends an immense amount of intellect upon  the most trivial occasions, as Gil Bias made use of as much intelligence  to find the means of subsistence for a single day, as was required by  the Spanish king to govern the whole of his domain; make at last an  impression as painful upon us as the games in which the jugglers of  India exhibit such wonderful skill, where sharp and deadly arms fly  glittering through the air, which the least error, the least want of  perfect mastery, would make the bright, swift messengers of certain  death! Such skill is full of concealed anxiety, terror, and anguish!  From the complication of circumstances, danger may lurk in the slightest  inadvertence, in the least imprudence, in possible accidents, while  powerful assistance may suddenly spring from some obscure and forgotten  individual. A dramatic interest may instantaneously arise from  interviews apparently the most trivial, giving an unforeseen phase to  every relation. A misty uncertainty hovers round every meeting, through  whose clouds it is difficult to seize the contours, to fix the lines, to  ascertain the present and future influence, thus rendering intercourse  vague and unintelligible, filling it with an indefinable and hidden  terror, yet, at the same time, with an insinuating flattery. The strong  currents of genuine sympathy are always struggling to escape from the  weight of this external repression. The differing impulses of vanity,  love, and patriotism, in their threefold motives of action, are forever  hurtling against each other in all hearts, leading to inextricable  confusion of thought and feeling.    What mingling emotions are concentrated in the accidental meetings of  the Mazourka! It can surround, with its own enchantment, the lightest  emotion of the heart, while, through its magic, the most reserved,  transitory, and trivial rencounter appeals to the imagination. Could it  be otherwise in the presence of the women who give to this dance that  inimitable grace and suavity, for which, in less happy countries,  they struggle in vain? In very truth are not the Sclavic women utterly  incomparable? There are to be found among them those whose qualities and  virtues are so incontestable, so absolute, that they are acknowledged  by all ages, and by all countries. Such apparitions are always and  everywhere rare. The women of Poland are generally distinguished by an  originality full of fire. Parisians in their grace and culture, Eastern  dancing girls in their languid fire, they have perhaps preserved among  them, handed down from mother to daughter, the secret of the burning  love potions possessed in the seraglios. Their charms possess the  strange spell of Asiatic languor. With the flames of spiritual and  intellectual Houris in their lustrous eyes, we find the luxurious  indolence of the Sultana. Their manners caress without emboldening;  the grace of their languid movements is intoxicating; they allure by  a flexibility of form, which knows no restraint, save that of perfect  modesty, and which etiquette has never succeeded in robbing of its  willowy grace. They win upon us by those intonations of voice which  touch the heart, and fill the eye with tender tears; by those sudden and  graceful impulses which recall the spontaneity and beautiful timidity  of the gazelle. Intelligent, cultivated, comprehending every thing  with rapidity, skillful in the use of all they have acquired; they are  nevertheless as superstitious and fastidious as the lovely yet ignorant  creatures adored by the Arabian prophet. Generous, devout, loving danger  and loving love, from which they demand much, and to which they grant  little; beyond every thing they prize renown and glory. All heroism  is dear to them. Perhaps there is no one among them who would think it  possible to pay too dearly for a brilliant action; and yet, let us say  it with reverence, many of them devote to obscurity their most holy  sacrifices, their most sublime virtues. But however exemplary these  quiet virtues of the home life may be, neither the miseries of private  life, nor the secret sorrows which must prey upon souls too ardent not  to be frequently wounded, can diminish the wonderful vivacity of  their emotions, which they know how to communicate with the infallible  rapidity and certainty of an electric spark. Discreet by nature and  position, they manage the great weapon of dissimulation with incredible  dexterity, skillfully reading the souls of others with out revealing the  secrets of their own. With that strange pride which disdains to exhibit  characteristic or individual qualities, it is frequently the most noble  virtues which are thus concealed. The internal contempt they feel for  those who cannot divine them, gives them that superiority which enables  them to reign so absolutely over those whom they have enthralled,  flattered, subjugated, charmed; until the moment arrives when--loving  with the whole force of their ardent souls, they are willing to brave  and share the most bitter suffering, prison, exile, even death itself,  with the object of their love! Ever faithful, ever consoling, ever  tender, ever unchangeable in the intensity of their generous devotion!  Irresistible beings, who in fascinating and charming, yet demand an  earnest and devout esteem! In that precious incense of praise burned by  M. de Balzac, \"in honor of that daughter of a foreign soil,\" he has  thus sketched the Polish woman in hues composed entirely of antitheses:  \"Angel through love, demon through fantasy; child through faith, sage  through experience; man through the brain, woman through the heart;  giant through hope, mother through sorrow; and poet through dreams.\"  [Footnote: Dedication of \"Modeste Mignon\".]    The homage inspired by the Polish women is always fervent. They all  possess the poetic conception of an ideal, which gleams through their  intercourse like an image constantly passing before a mirror, the  comprehension and seizure of which they impose as a task. Despising the  insipid and common pleasure of merely being able to please, they demand  that the being whom they love shall be capable of exacting their esteem.  This romantic temperament sometimes retains them long in hesitation  between the world and the cloister. Indeed, there are few among them who  at some moment of their lives have not seriously and bitterly thought of  taking refuge within the walls of a convent.    Where such women reign as sovereigns, what feverish words, what hopes,  what despair, what entrancing fascinations must occur in the mazes of  the Mazourka; the Mazourka, whose every cadence vibrates in the ear of  the Polish lady as the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4389"],[0,"Roughing It in the Bush (#10)"],[1,"ir, he shouted with an air of triumph, \"Git out wid you,  you ould witch! Shure the ladies, the purty darlints, never sent  you wid that ugly message to Pat, who loves them so intirely that  he manes to kape watch over them through the blessed night.\" Then  making us a ludicrous bow, he continued, \"Ladies, I'm at yer  sarvice; I only wish I could get a dispensation from the Pope,  and I'd marry yeas all.\" The stewardess bolted the door, and the  mad fellow kept up such a racket that we all wished him at the  bottom of the Ontario.    The following day was wet and gloomy. The storm had protracted the  length of our voyage for several hours, and it was midnight when we  landed at Cobourg.      THERE'S REST    (Written at midnight on the river St. Lawrence)      There's rest when eve, with dewy fingers,      Draws the curtains of repose    Round the west, where light still lingers,      And the day's last glory glows;    There's rest in heaven's unclouded blue,      When twinkling stars steal one by one,    So softly on the gazer's view,      As if they sought his glance to shun.      There's rest when o'er the silent meads      The deepening shades of night advance;    And sighing through their fringe of reeds,      The mighty stream's clear waters glance.    There's rest when all above is bright,      And gently o'er these summer isles    The full moon pours her mellow light,      And heaven on earth serenely smiles.      There's rest when angry storms are o'er,      And fear no longer vigil keeps;    When winds are heard to rave no more,      And ocean's troubled spirit sleeps;    There's rest when to the pebbly strand,      The lapsing billows slowly glide;    And, pillow'd on the golden sand,      Breathes soft and low the slumbering tide.      There's rest, deep rest, at this still hour--      A holy calm,--a pause profound;    Whose soothing spell and dreamy power      Lulls into slumber all around.    There's rest for labour's hardy child,      For Nature's tribes of earth and air,--    Whose sacred balm and influence mild,      Save guilt and sorrow, all may share.      There's rest beneath the quiet sod,      When life and all its sorrows cease,    And in the bosom of his God      The Christian finds eternal peace,--    That peace the world cannot bestow,      The rest a Saviour's death-pangs bought,    To bid the weary pilgrim know      A rest surpassing human thought.          CHAPTER IV    TOM WILSON'S EMIGRATION          \"Of all odd fellows, this fellow was the oddest. I have seen    many strange fish in my days, but I never met with his equal.\"      About a month previous to our emigration to Canada, my husband said  to me, \"You need not expect me home to dinner to-day; I am going  with my friend Wilson to Y----, to hear Mr. C---- lecture upon  emigration to Canada. He has just returned from the North American  provinces, and his lectures are attended by vast numbers of persons  who are anxious to obtain information on the subject. I got a note  from your friend B---- this morning, begging me to come over and  listen to his palaver; and as Wilson thinks of emigrating in the  spring, he will be my walking companion.\"    \"Tom Wilson going to Canada!\" said I, as the door closed on my  better-half. \"What a backwoodsman he will make! What a loss to the  single ladies of S----! What will they do without him at their balls  and picnics?\"    One of my sisters, who was writing at a table near me, was highly  amused at this unexpected announcement. She fell back in her chair  and indulged in a long and hearty laugh. I am certain that most of  my readers would have joined in her laugh had they known the object  which provoked her mirth. \"Poor Tom is such a dreamer,\" said my  sister, \"it would be an act of charity in Moodie to persuade him  from undertaking such a wild-goose chase; only that I fancy my good  brother is possessed with the same mania.\"    \"Nay, God forbid!\" said I. \"I hope this Mr. ----, with the  unpronounceable name, will disgust them with his eloquence; for  B---- writes me word, in his droll way, that he is a coarse, vulgar  fellow, and lacks the dignity of a bear. Oh! I am certain they will  return quite sickened with the Canadian project.\" Thus I laid the  flattering unction to my soul, little dreaming that I and mine  should share in the strange adventures of this oddest of all odd  creatures.    It might be made a subject of curious inquiry to those who delight  in human absurdities, if ever there were a character drawn in works  of fiction so extravagantly ridiculous as some which daily  experience presents to our view. We have encountered people in the  broad thoroughfares of life more eccentric than ever we read of in  books; people who, if all their foolish sayings and doings were  duly recorded, would vie with the drollest creations of Hood, or  George Colman, and put to shame the flights of Baron Munchausen.  Not that Tom Wilson was a romancer; oh no! He was the very prose of  prose, a man in a mist, who seemed afraid of moving about for fear  of knocking his head against a tree, and finding a halter suspended  to its branches--a man as helpless and as indolent as a baby.    Mr. Thomas, or Tom Wilson, as he was familiarly called by all his  friends and acquaintances, was the son of a gentleman, who once  possessed a large landed property in the neighbourhood; but an  extravagant and profligate expenditure of the income which he  derived from a fine estate which had descended from father to son  through many generations, had greatly reduced the circumstances of  the elder Wilson. Still, his family held a certain rank and  standing in their native county, of which his evil courses, bad as  they were, could not wholly deprive them. The young people--and a  very large family they made of sons and daughters, twelve in  number--were objects of interest and commiseration to all who knew  them, while the worthless father was justly held in contempt and  detestation. Our hero was the youngest of the six sons; and from  his childhood he was famous for his nothing-to-doishness. He was  too indolent to engage heart and soul in the manly sports of his  comrades; and he never thought it necessary to commence learning  his lessons until the school had been in an hour. As he grew up  to man's estate, he might be seen dawdling about in a black  frock-coat, jean trousers, and white kid gloves, making lazy bows  to the pretty girls of his acquaintance; or dressed in a green  shooting-jacket, with a gun across his shoulder, sauntering down  the wooded lanes, with a brown spaniel dodging at his heels, and  looking as sleepy and indolent as his master.    The slowness of all Tom's movements was strangely contrasted with  his slight, and symmetrical figure; that looked as if it only  awaited the will of the owner to be the most active piece of human  machinery that ever responded to the impulses of youth and health.  But then, his face! What pencil could faithfully delineate features  at once so comical and lugubrious--features that one moment  expressed the most solemn seriousness, and the next, the most  grotesque and absurd abandonment to mirth? In him, all extremes  appeared to meet; the man was a contradiction to himself. Tom was  a person of few words, and so intensely lazy that it required a  strong effort of will to enable him to answer the questions of  inquiring friends; and when at length aroused to exercise his  colloquial powers, he performed the task in so original a manner  that it never failed to upset the gravity of the interrogator.  When he raised his large, prominent, leaden-coloured eyes from the  ground, and looked the inquirer steadily in the face, the effect  was irresistible; the laugh would come--do your best to resist it.    Poor Tom took this mistimed merriment in very good part, generally  answering with a ghastly contortion which he meant for a smile, or,  if he did trouble himself to find words, with, \"Well, that's funny!  What makes you laugh? At me, I suppose? I don't wonder at it; I  often laugh at myself.\"    Tom would have been a treasure to an undertaker. He would have been  celebrated as a mute; he looked as if he had been born in a shroud,  and rocked in a coffin. The gravity with which he could answer a  ridiculous or impertinent question completely disarmed and turned  the shafts of malice back upon his opponent. If Tom was himself an  object of ridicule to many, he had a way of quietly ridiculing  others that bade defiance to all competition. He could quiz with a  smile, and put down insolence with an incredulous stare. A grave  wink from those dreamy eyes would destroy the veracity of a  travelled dandy for ever.    Tom was not without use in his day and generation; queer and  awkward as he was, he was the soul of truth and honour. You might  suspect his sanity--a matter always doubtful--but his honesty of  heart and purpose, never.    When you met Tom in the streets, he was dressed with such neatness  and care (to be sure it took him half the day to make his toilet),  that it led many persons to imagine that this very ugly young man  considered himself an Adonis; and I must confess that I rather  inclined to this opinion. He always paced the public streets with  a slow, deliberate tread, and with his eyes fixed intently on the  ground--like a man who had lost his ideas, and was diligently  employed in searching for them. I chanced to meet him one day in  this dreamy mood.    \"How do you do, Mr. Wilson?\" He stared at me for several minutes,  as if doubtful of my presence or identity.    \"What was that you said?\"    I repeated the question; and he answered, with one of his  incredulous smiles--    \"Was it to me you spoke? Oh, I am quite well, or I should not be  walking here. By the way, did you see my dog?\"    \"How should I know your dog?\"    \"They say he resembles me. He's a queer dog, too; but I never could  find out the likeness. Good night!\"    This was at "]]]
