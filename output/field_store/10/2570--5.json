The Prophet once said to  Williams's father and mother: \"If Tom don't behave himself better, and  stop causing me trouble, I must attend to him.\" Soon after, Williams  apostatized, and started for California, intending to remain, and send  back for his family. He met the fate of Babbitt. He was waylaid and  killed by \"Indians\" on the Plains. It is well understood at Salt Lake  that these were white Indians, and that Williams was put to death by  order of the church authorities.    The records of the United States District Courts were in Judge Stiles's  office. He, and Williams also, had a good many law books, which were  private property. Brigham asserted that the records were suffered to  \"lie around loose,\" and suggested to the boys that they had better be  cared for. This was sufficient, and \"the boys\" proceeded to \"'tend to  it.\" James Ferguson, Hiram B. Clawson, and several others, repaired to  the office of the Judge when he was absent, and stationing one of the  number to watch, they gathered up the records of the courts, first of  all, and conveyed them to a fire-and-burglar-proof-safe, belonging to  Young, and under the control of Clawson, who was his confidential clerk  and son-in-law.    Having deposited them safely, they returned, and taking some of the  Judge's papers, tore them in pieces, and scattered them over the floor,  and in the direction of an outhouse. About the same time a large number  of the law books found their way into the houses of certain Mormon  lawyers, where they have ever since remained. They then took some of the  books from the office, and placed them in the outhouse, set fire to the  building, and burned it to the ground.    When Judge Stiles returned he found the office robbed, and the books and  papers, as he supposed, burned.    Thus all business was suspended, and the records of the United States  Courts and government property burned and stolen from the custody of the  legal authorities.    Judge Stiles left Utah in the spring of 1857, and when in Washington,  made affidavit to the foregoing facts. It may be well here to state that  Judge S. was entirely conscientious in making his affidavit, and the  prevailing impression in the community was that the records had been  destroyed.    In the summer of 1855 W. W. Drummond, of Illinois, arrived in Utah, as  Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. The Mormons allege that he  deserted his wife, and brought with him a mistress. This caused much  righteous indignation among the saints! The Judge also professed to be  a warm friend and advocate of Senator Douglas, whom the Mormons hate.    When Drummond was about to hold court, he intimated that he would set  aside all judgments rendered by probate Judges, and annul all their  proceedings, except such as pertained to the usual and legitimate  business of the probate courts. Here was a direct issue, and a conflict  was inevitable.    The court being about to be held in Fillmore, a Jew was hired for $25 to  quarrel with Drummond. As a part of the programme, also, he was to  strike the Judge. The Jew played his part, except the blow, which, for  want of opportunity or courage, was omitted. Instead of this he sent to  the Judge an insulting message, by the hands of a colored \"boy\"  belonging to Drummond. The boy was sent back with a raw hide, and  instructions to \"lay on\" the same to the back of the Israelite, which  Cuffy obeyed with much spirit. Complaint was made by the Jew to a local  magistrate. A warrant was issued, and Drummond and his negro were both  arrested.    The result of this _emeute_ was a sort of compromise, in which it was  understood that the Judge should not interfere with the probate courts,  and he was set at liberty.    After adjourning his court at Fillmore, Drummond located in Utah County  in the winter of 1856. The following summer he went to Carson to hold  court for Judge Stiles. Thence he proceeded to California and to the  States, and as the Mormons allege \"contributed largely to the getting up  of Buchanan's crusade.\"          CHAPTER IV.    POLITICAL HISTORY CONTINUED.--THE MORMON WAR.         Report of the Secretary of War.--Proclamation of Gov. Brigham       Young declaring Martial Law.--Correspondence.--Sermons of       Young and Kimball.--Proclamation of Gov. Cumming.--His Echo       Canyon Adventures.--Col. Kane.--The Mormons leave Salt Lake.--       Commissioners appointed by the President.--Peace restored.      By these and similar outrages the Mormons had succeeded in ridding  themselves of all the federal authorities, and were really in open  rebellion against the Federal Government.    As Congress was not in session, the matter was taken in hand by Floyd,  Secretary of War, and President Buchanan.    After due consultation it was deemed advisable to appoint new men to all  the civil offices of the Territory, and to accompany them with a  military force sufficient for their protection and the enforcement of  the laws. Accordingly, President Buchanan, during the summer of 1857,  made the following appointments for Utah:--Governor, A. Cumming; Chief  Justice, D. R. Eckels; Associate Justices, John Cradlebaugh and Charles  E. Sinclair; Secretary, John Hartnett.    An army of about 3000 men was armed and equipped, and ordered to march  for Utah, early in the fall of 1857.    Brevet Brigadier-General W. S. Harney was originally named as commander  of this force, but it was subsequently deemed inadvisable to detach that  officer from the special duties of his department in Kansas, and the  troops sent to Utah were placed under the orders of Col. A. S. Johnson.    The Secretary of War, in his report, dated December 5, 1857, says:--         \"The Territory of Utah is peopled almost exclusively by the       religious sect known as Mormons. . . . They have substituted       for the laws of the land a theocracy, having for its head an       individual whom they profess to believe a prophet of God.         \"This Prophet demands obedience, and receives it implicitly       from his people, in virtue of what he assures them to be       authority derived from revelations received by him from       Heaven. Whenever he finds it convenient to exercise any       special command, these opportune revelations of a higher law       come to his aid. From his decrees there is no appeal; against       his will there is no resistance. . . .         \"From the first hour they fixed themselves in that remote and       almost inaccessible region of our territory, from which they       are now sending defiance to the sovereign power, their whole       plan has been to prepare for a successful secession from the       authority of the United States, and a permanent establishment       of their own. . . .         \"This Mormon brotherhood has scarcely preserved the semblance       of obedience to the authority of the United States for some       years past; not at all indeed, except as it might confer some       direct benefit upon themselves, or contribute to circulate       public money in their community. . . . I need not here recite       the many instances in their conduct and history on which these       general allegations are founded, especially the conduct they       have adopted within the last twelve months towards the civil       authorities of the United States.         \"It has, nevertheless, always been the policy and desire of       the Federal Government to avoid collision with this Mormon       community. It has borne with the insubordination they have       exhibited, under circumstances when respect for its own       authority has frequently counselled harsh measures of       discipline. And this forbearance might still be prolonged, and       the evils rife among them be allowed to work out their own       cure, if this community occupied any other theatre, isolated       and remote from the seats of civilization, than the one they       now possess.         \"But, unfortunately for these views, their settlements lie in       the great pathway which leads from the Atlantic States to the       new and flourishing communities growing up upon the Pacific       seaboard. They stand a lion in the path; not only themselves       defying the civil and military authorities of the government,       but encouraging, if not exciting, the nomad savages who roam       over the vast, unoccupied regions of the continent, to the       pillage and massacre of peaceful and helpless emigrant       families traversing the solitudes of the wilderness. The rapid       settlement of our Pacific possessions; the rights, in those       regions, of emigrants, unable to afford the heavy expenses of       transit by water and the Isthmus; the facility and safety of       military, political, and social intercommunication between our       eastern and western populations and States,--all depend upon       the prompt, absolute, and thorough removal of a hostile power       besetting this path, midway of its route, at a point where       succor and provisions should always be found, rather than       obstruction, privation, and outrage. . . .         \"From all the circumstances surrounding this subject at the       time, it was thought expedient, during the past summer, to       send a body of troops to Utah, with the civil officers       recently appointed to that Territory. . . . Great care has been       taken, in preparing for the march to Utah, that nothing should       seem to excite apprehension of any action on the part of the       army in the least conflicting with the fixed principle of our       institutions, by which the military is strictly subordinate to       the civil authority. The instructions of the commanding       officer were deliberately considered, and carefully drawn, and       he was charged not to allow any conflict to take place between       the troops "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/446"],[0,"A Book of Remarkable Criminals (#10)"],[1,"was serious. Peace was  not the man to hesitate in the face of danger. On these occasions  Mrs. Thompson was followed by Peace or his wife, brought back home and  soundly beaten. To Hannah Peace there must have been some satisfaction  in spying on her successful rival, for, in her own words, Peace never  refused his mistress anything; he did not care what she cost him in  dress; \"she could swim in gold if she liked.\" Mrs. Thompson herself  admitted that with the exception of such punishment as she brought on  herself by her inebriety, Peace was always fond of her, and treated her  with great kindness. It was she to whom he would show with pride the  proceeds of his nightly labours, to whom he would look for a smile when  he returned home from his expeditions, haggard and exhausted    Through all dangers and difficulties the master was busy in the practice  of his art. Night after night, with few intervals of repose, he would  sally forth on a plundering adventure. If the job was a distant one, he  would take his pony and trap. Peace was devoted to his pony, Tommy,  and great was his grief when at the end of six months' devotion to duty  Tommy died after a few days' sickness, during which his master attended  him with unremitting care. Tommy had been bought in Greenwich for  fourteen guineas, part of a sum of two hundred and fifty pounds which  Peace netted from a rich haul of silver and bank-notes taken from a  house in Denmark Hill. Besides the pony and trap, Peace would take with  him on these expeditions a violin case containing his tools; at other  times they would be stuffed into odd pockets made for the purpose in  his trousers. These tools consisted of ten in all--a skeleton key, two  pick-locks, a centre-bit, gimlet, gouge, chisel, vice jemmy and knife; a  portable ladder, a revolver and life preserver completed his equipment.    The range of Peace's activities extended as far as Southampton,  Portsmouth and Southsea; but the bulk of his work was done in  Blackheath, Streatham, Denmark Hill, and other suburbs of South London.  Many dramatic stories are told of his exploits, but they rest for the  most part on slender foundation. On one occasion, in getting on to a  portico, he fell, and was impaled on some railings, fortunately in no  vital part. His career as a burglar in London lasted from the beginning  of the year 1877 until October, 1878. During that time this wanted man,  under the very noses of the police, exercised with complete success his  art as a burglar, working alone, depending wholly on his own mental and  physical gifts, disposing in absolute secrecy of the proceeds of his  work, and living openly the life of a respectable and industrious old  gentleman.    All the while the police were busily seeking Charles Peace, the murderer  of Mr. Dyson. Once or twice they came near to capturing him. On one  occasion a detective who had known Peace in Yorkshire met him in  Farringdon Road, and pursued him up the steps of Holborn Viaduct, but  just as the officer, at the top of the steps, reached out and was on the  point of grabbing his man, Peace with lightning agility slipped through  his fingers and disappeared. The police never had a shadow of suspicion  that Mr. Thompson of Peckham was Charles Peace of Sheffield. They knew  the former only as a polite and chatty old gentleman of a scientific  turn of mind, who drove his own pony and trap, and had a fondness for  music and keeping pet animals.    Peace made the mistake of outstaying his welcome in the neighbourhood  of South-East London. Perhaps he hardly realised the extent to which  his fame was spreading. During the last three months of Peace's career,  Blackheath was agog at the number of successful burglaries committed  in the very midst of its peaceful residents. The vigilance of the local  police was aroused, the officers on night duty were only too anxious to  effect the capture of the mysterious criminal.    About two o'clock in the morning of October 10, 1878, a police  constable, Robinson by name, saw a light appear suddenly in a window at  the back of a house in St. John's Park, Blackheath, the residence of a  Mr. Burness. Had the looked-for opportunity arrived? Was the mysterious  visitor, the disturber of the peace of Blackheath, at his burglarious  employment? Without delay Robinson summoned to his aid two of his  colleagues. One of them went round to the front of the house and rang  the bell, the other waited in the road outside, while Robinson stayed in  the garden at the back. No sooner had the bell rung than Robinson saw a  man come from the dining-room window which opened on to the garden, and  make quickly down the path. Robinson followed him. The man turned; \"Keep  back!\" he said, \"or by God I'll shoot you!\" Robinson came on. The man  fired three shots from a revolver, all of which passed close to the  officer's head. Robinson made another rush for him, the man fired  another shot. It missed its mark. The constable closed with his would-be  assassin, and struck him in the face. \"I'll settle you this time,\" cried  the man, and fired a fifth shot, which went through Robinson's arm just  above the elbow. But, in spite of his wound, the valiant officer held  his prisoner, succeeded in flinging him to the ground, and catching hold  of the revolver that hung round the burglar's wrist, hit him on the head  with it. Immediately after the other two constables came to the help of  their colleague, and the struggling desperado was secured.    Little did the police as they searched their battered and moaning  prisoner realise the importance of their capture. When next morning  Peace appeared before the magistrate at Greenwich Police Court he was  not described by name--he had refused to give any--but as a half-caste  about sixty years of age, of repellant aspect. He was remanded for a  week. The first clue to the identity of their prisoner was afforded  by a letter which Peace, unable apparently to endure the loneliness and  suspense of prison any longer, wrote to his co-inventor Mr. Brion. It is  dated November 2, and is signed \"John Ward.\" Peace was disturbed at the  absence of all news from his family. Immediately after his arrest, the  home in Peckham had been broken up. Mrs. Thompson and Mrs. Peace, taking  with them some large boxes, had gone first to the house of a sister of  Mrs. Thompson's in Nottingham, and a day or two later Mrs. Peace had  left Nottingham for Sheffield. There she went to a house in Hazel Road,  occupied by her son-in-law Bolsover, a working collier.(10)           (10) Later, Mrs. Peace was arrested and charged with being in possession  of stolen property. She was taken to London and tried at the Old Bailey  before Mr. Commissioner Kerr, but acquitted on the ground of her having  acted under the compulsion of her husband.      It was no doubt to get news of his family that Peace wrote to Brion. But  the letters are sufficiently ingenious. Peace represents himself as a  truly penitent sinner who has got himself into a most unfortunate and  unexpected \"mess\" by giving way to drink. The spelling of the letters is  exaggeratedly illiterate. He asks Mr. Brion to take pity on him and not  despise him as \"his own famery has don,\" to write him a letter to \"hease  his trobel hart,\" if possible to come and see him. Mr. Brion complied  with the request of the mysterious \"John Ward,\" and on arriving at  Newgate where Peace was awaiting trial, found himself in the presence of  his friend and colleague, Mr. Thompson.    In the meantime the police were getting hot on the scent of the identity  of \"John Ward\" with the great criminal who in spite of all their efforts  had eluded them for two years. The honour and profit of putting the  police on the right scent were claimed by Mrs. Thompson. To her Peace  had contrived to get a letter conveyed about the same time that he wrote  to Mr. Brion. It is addressed to his \"dearly beloved wife.\" He asks  pardon for the \"drunken madness\" that has involved him in his present  trouble, and gives her the names of certain witnesses whom he would wish  to be called to prove his independent means and his dealings in musical  instruments. It is, he writes, his first offence, and as he has \"never  been in prison before,\" begs her not to feel it a disgrace to come and  see him there. But Peace was leaning on a broken reed. Loyalty does not  appear to have been Susan Thompson's strong point. In her own words she  \"was not of the sentimental sort.\" The \"traitress Sue,\" as she is called  by chroniclers of the time, had fallen a victim to the wiles of the  police. Since, after Peace's arrest, she had been in possession of a  certain amount of stolen property, it was easier no doubt to persuade  her to be frank.    In any case, we find that on February 5, 1879, the day after Peace had  been sentenced to death for the murder of Dyson, Mrs. Thompson appealed  to the Treasury for the reward of L100 offered for Peace's conviction.  She based her application on information which she said she had supplied  to the police officers in charge of the case on November 5 in the  previous year, the very day on which Peace had first written to her from  Newgate. In reply to her letter the Treasury referred \"Mrs. S. Bailey,  alias Thompson,\" to the Home Office, but whether she received from that  office the price of blood history does not relate.    The police scouted the idea that any revelation of hers had assisted  them to identify \"John Ward\" with Charles Peace. They said that it  was information given them in Peckham, no doubt by Mr. Brion, who, on  learning the deplorable character of his coadjutor, had placed himself  unreservedly in their hands, which first set them on the track. From  Peckham they went to Nottingham, where they no doubt came across Sue  Thompson, and thence to Sheffield, where on November 6 they visited  the house in Hazel Road, occupied by Mrs. Peace and her daughter, Mrs."]]]
