Surely he would not leave her  to sleep there alone?    To the man, this light touch was illuminating.  \"Oh, leave'n go,\" he  muttered.    In the bedroom, Gray Rosevear was moving deftly to and fro, unpacking  Sabina's clothes and laying them in the drawers of the tall-boy.  The  man's eyes followed her light figure, at first unconsciously, but before  long with a strange quickening of emotion.  If it had been this girl who  was asking him, he would have given up his eyrie with an eager  willingness.  He did not understand himself.  What was Gray to him?    His wife's voice when she spoke again, seemed a whisper from far away.  \"I can't go overstairs,\" she said pleadingly.    Byron turned his eyes deliberately from Gray's wildflower grace to the  thick shortened figure in the trolly and his incipient repugnance grew.  Sleep with this deformity?  He could not bring himself to it.  To live  in the same house with her would be difficult; at least he would shut  her out of his nights.  Already he knew instinctively what those nights,  moon-silvered, star-set, nights not of bitter brooding but of dreams,  would be to him.    \"I can't sleep 'ere.\"    Sabina sighed.  The people had given her the froth of sweet words but  this was reality.  \"Well, my dear, I can't 'elp it,\" she said  resignedly.  \"I can't do much nowadays.\"    \"Ah now, if 'ee'd only reckernize that.\"    The touch of opposition was a spur.  \"Still there's a lot as I can do.  This trolly now, 'll 'elp me a lot.\"    He eyed it with distaste.  \"Oogly thing, can't think why 'ee do want to  be runnin' round like a toad on a red-'ot shovel.  Seein' 'ow you be,  'twould be more to your credit if you was to die down and be quiet,  'stead o goin' about on an old thing like that.  You'll be the  laughing-stock of the parish.\"    \"Nothin' 'ud get done.\"    \"Oh, fiddlesticks, 'ow won't the things be done? Can't I do't for yer?\"  For the moment Gray was forgotten and he was back at the old gnawing  bitterness.    \"Whiles my 'ead's above ground, I'll look after the place myself,\" said  Sabina who, being tired, was a little captious.  She was disappointed  that her welcome home had been so commonplace.  She had expected, she  knew not what, but something culminating.    \"A pretty mess 'ee'll make of it,\" muttered Leadville and, turning  about, walked off with himself.  When he and Sabina differed, which was  not often--their differences being fundamental, trifles took the  subsidiary place so seldom granted them--he invariably ended the  discussion by going out of the house.  With all the open from which to  choose it was easy for him to get away from a woman's tiresomeness, to  get back to his own quiet company and his thoughts.    Sabina looked after the husband whom she had long ago decided was  difficult, but probably not more so than other men, and her heart sank.  She had so wanted Leadville to rejoice with her over her recovery, to be  proud of her.  Though she carried herself gallantly there were periods  when her poor heart acknowledged a weakness, a lowness.  She had longed  sometimes to stay it on a greater strength.    \"Where's Gray goin' to sleep?\" asked Mrs. Rosevear who, standing quietly  in the background, had been a shrewd spectator.    \"Gray?\" said she, and a feeling seldom hitherto experienced, awoke in  her.  If she had been as young as Gray, soft-eyed as she, would it have  made a difference?    \"Twill be a bit lonely for 'er upstairs,\" said the mother thoughtfully.  \"Though, of course, Leadville'll be near.\"    But it was envy, not jealousy, that had been awakened in Mrs. Byron.  \"Let her come in wi' me.  We'll 'av a little bed put up, there's plenty  of room for 'er.\"    When Leadville came back, and he must in time grow accustomed to the  idea of sleeping on the ground-floor, a fresh arrangement could be made.  Meanwhile the maid would be company.  Sabina felt that the place was  peopled with the judges and judged of long ago and, to her Celtic mind,  the shadows moved.  In the dark hours it would be comforting to hear the  movements, the breathing, of some one still this side the grave.    From an upper chamber they brought the small bedstead which, when Mrs.  Byron was a girl, had been hers; also a chest of drawers.    \"Where's your traaede to?\" asked the mother.    \"Jim's bringin' it down.  I believe he's out in the kitchen now.  I'll  go and see.\"    As she went from the room Mrs. Rosevear sank into the nearest chair.  \"I'm glad you'm back, S'bina.  I bin so whisht without 'ee.  Not a soul  to speak to besides Tom and you can't tell a man very much.\"    \"No, they don't understand.\"  Her thoughts wandered for a moment.  Leadville had been strange in his manner but of course it was only that  he did not understand.    \"Now you've seen Jim,\" continued Mrs. Rosevear, \"what do you think of  him?\"    Sabina roused herself.  \"I call 'ee a proper chap,\" she said smilingly.  \"Lovely curly 'air he 'as.\"    \"Yes,\" confided the mother, \"and Gray's as maaeze as a rattle about  'im.\"    Mrs. Tom's confidences made Sabina feel as if she had a share in the  other's happy motherhood.  They sat gossiping until the shadows began to  fill the valley. Jim was a long time on his way with Gray's box--but to  every man and woman their hour!    Leadville, on leaving the house, had turned his face towards the cliff.  Beyond its dark wall was space and light.  He took the little path that  led over the head, passed the deep curves of what in prehistoric times  had been the earthworks of a stockaded hold and came out upon a broad  shelf of rock.  The tide was in, large green waves were rolling, with a  break like gunfire, into the caves below, and, facing him, was one of  the strange sunsets often seen on that coast.  The western sky was  scarlet and across the light was a trail of black clouds.    \"A red sky at night, is the shepherd's delight,\" muttered the man,  flinging himself down above the booming uproar of the water.  Below, the  shags were nesting on inaccessible ledges and a solitary seal was diving  through the crests of the green rollers.  Byron felt unusually,  inexplicably cheerful.  The glories of the sunset were in keeping with  his mood, a mood, as he realized, of the incoming tide.  On his shelf of  rock he lay in a happy dream.  Hitherto he had loved nothing but a few  acres of land; he had hungered after fields and rocks, had dragged out a  dark existence of craving and disappointment. Now his tormented spirit  was at peace.  The wide expanse of heaven changed from scarlet to  poppy-red, the raven clouds grew more numerous and Leadville looked on  with happy eyes.  In his breast was a ferment, like the unresting  ferment of the sea, but neither cold nor lifeless.  A wind was blowing  steadily from the west, but he did not feel it for he was warm.  His  spirit, with its capacity for intense feeling, had crossed a boundary  line, beyond which was neither heat nor cold, hunger nor thirst.  He had  loved Wastralls, now he was in the power of a force stronger than that  love, of a force the strongest in the world.                                         *THE BOOK*                                       CHAPTER V      Mrs. Byron, wheeling her trolly through the \"houses and courts\" of  Wastralls, along the garden paths and down the neglected drive, found  that her creation had a feeling for rises in the ground that was almost  uncanny. \"Thus far shalt thou go,\" said the trolly and Jim Rosevear  spent many a half-hour levelling surfaces which Mrs. Byron had hitherto  believed to be as flat as the yard pond.  On the whole she got about as  much as she had expected to; and far more than her husband or even the  hinds had believed possible.    The latter had served her well, partly because she, being a good master,  it was difficult for them to do otherwise; but also because, being  raised above them, a woman and unfamiliar, she was in some dim way that  Golden Helen of all male dreams.  For her part she understood them as  she understood the animals on the farm, their idiosyncrasies, their  capacity.  She worked them as she worked her horses, as kindly, with as  much consideration; but without feeling that they were nearer to her in  the scale of creation.    On her return to Wastralls she found that her long absence and  Leadville's slack rule, hard work one day, off shooting the next, had  demoralized the little band. They gave their employer a hearty welcome,  vicariously, proud of one who, though desperately injured, had refused  to give up the struggle which is life; but it soon became evident that  they believed her accident and subsequent mutilation had changed her  into something weak and strange.  Her orders were questioned.  Unconsciously the men were testing the power that for so long had kept  them subservient.    \"George,\" said she to Biddick, one bright June morning, \"you'd better  cut that 'ay in Cross Parks to-day.\"    \"I think I should leave it a day or two longer, missis. I b'lieve we're  goin' to 'av some rain,\" returned the old fellow who, at the moment, had  a job more to his liking.    Sabina's voice rang out.  \"Never mind about that. You get the men and  'av it done at once.  It'll be done before the rain come then.\"    She had a sense of weather so keen that she had been known to predict it  for months, even seasons, ahead and Biddick looked at her uneasily.  When some days later, he came for his week's money, she spoke to him  sharply.    \"If"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53372"],[0,"Star of India (#10)"],[1,"it? After all, I am not such a Methuselah, and surely you can trust me  to safeguard my wife's honour and happiness as well as my own?\"    \"In the present, no doubt. But what about the end of it all? In ten,  even twenty years' time, Stella will still be a young woman, while  you----\" Her pause was cruelly pointed.    Colonel Crayfield glowered. Confound the old devil; there must be an end  to this croaking, these distasteful forebodings. Assuming indifference,  he stretched out his legs. The chair wobbled ominously, and rising with  precautionary haste, he began to pace backwards and forwards before his  aged adversary. Her opposition was so unexpected!    \"It seems to me,\" he said, keeping his temper with an effort, \"that  Stella would be infinitely better off as my wife than if she stayed  here, perhaps to marry beneath her, perhaps never to marry at all? I  can't take her to India as my ward or as my adopted daughter. I'm not  quite old enough for _that_!\"    \"How old are you?\" inquired grandmamma spitefully.    \"Not much over fifty,\" he told her, with disarming readiness, \"and I  flatter myself that I am young for my age. I am well off; I am willing  to make suitable provision for my widow. What more can you want?\" He  spoke now with truculence.    \"Well, I suppose you must cut your own throat, if you are so minded,\"  said grandmamma; \"but perhaps Stella may not care to marry a man old  enough to be her father--even, to stretch a point, her grandfather!\"    \"We shall see!\" was his confident answer.    The old lady sat silent. She was deeply disappointed, so convinced had  she felt that it was Ellen he was after, and that Stella would be going  to India beneath Ellen's safe wing. It was so seldom her wishes were  thwarted, so seldom her disapproval of anything bore no weight.    Presently she said, \"And when do you suggest that this extraordinary  marriage should take place?\"    \"Just as soon as it can all be arranged. I may say that I wish to be  responsible for Stella's outfit--indeed, for all expenses.\"    Mrs. Carrington's expression became a little less disagreeable. Money  was not plentiful at The Chestnuts. After all, no one could deny that in  a way it was a good enough chance for the child. But settlements must be  certain. If Stella got into trouble, there must be no returning her,  penniless, to her people, disgraced into the bargain.    \"I can only give my consent provided that Stella will be perfectly  secure, financially, whatever happens in the future.\"    Colonel Crayfield smiled; it was, as Mrs. Carrington felt, a smile that  was covertly insulting. \"When I have spoken to Stella,\" he said slowly,  \"I shall return to London and make proper arrangements with my lawyer.  My intentions will be submitted to you, and I hardly imagine you will  find fault with them.\"    \"Very well, then; there is no more to be said at present. But do not  forget that I have warned you.\"    \"I appreciate your concern on my behalf, Mrs. Carrington; but, believe  me, I think you are unduly apprehensive.\"    \"Let us hope so,\" said Mrs. Carrington grimly; and it was a relief to  them both when, at this moment, Augusta stepped out of the drawing-room  to remind her mother that luncheon would soon be on the table, to  suggest that the sun was rather powerful, and would it not be wiser for  mamma to come indoors?          CHAPTER V      After all, Colonel Crayfield was driven to proposing in the kitchen  garden. Stella was sent there, when luncheon was over, to pick more  fruit for jam-making, that serious ceremony being now at its height; not  even the presence of an important guest in the house could be permitted  to delay its progress. Colonel Crayfield volunteered in public to help  his goddaughter; Ellen's pale eyes flickered, grandmamma was coldly  silent; only Augusta, who, as yet, was ignorant of his intentions,  uttered conventional protests. Why should he trouble? It was so hot out  of doors; Stella was well used to the little task, and required no  help--would he not prefer to sit quiet with a book, or the paper?  Colonel Crayfield was equally punctilious--no trouble, a pleasure....  Though, unfortunately, unversed in the business of fruit picking for  jam, he would feel it a privilege to be allowed to contribute his share  of assistance, and so on.    At last the pair set off, armed with huge baskets, towards the  sun-blistered door let into the old brick wall of the garden.    \"I will join you as soon as I can,\" Augusta called after them kindly.    \"I hope she won't!\" said Colonel Crayfield, to the malicious delight of  Stella, who promptly echoed the hope. For the first time she felt  reconciled to the tedious duty, for surely now was her chance to coax  Colonel Crayfield into giving her at least some sort of notion as to  what was to happen.    As they opened the rickety door he contrived to touch her hand gently,  again as they closed it behind them; then, rather to his discomposure,  she suddenly slipped her hand confidingly into his.    \"Do tell me,\" she urged; \"I know you've got some plan up your sleeve.\"    She found her hand tightly imprisoned. \"You are sure you want to go to  India?\" he asked her.    \"You _know_! I've told you--it's the dream of my life.\"    \"As a governess, or a missionary?\"    \"Oh, don't be so tiresome--as anything!\"    \"Well,\" he restrained himself still.    \"Go on!\" she cried with impatience.    \"How would you like to go to India with me?\"    \"With _you_?\"    \"Yes\"--he dropped his basket, snatched hers from her grasp and flung it  to the ground. Now he was holding both her hands. \"Yes, with me,  Stella--as my wife!\"    Had the old red-brick walls of the garden fallen flat around her she  could hardly have felt more astounded. Involuntarily she wrenched her  hands free, clasped them behind her, backed away from him.    He advanced upon her. \"Now, now, little girl, what is the matter? Isn't  it all quite simple? You told me yourself there was no one here you  could marry, didn't you? And now here _is_ someone who wants you, who  will take you to India and give you everything in the world you could  wish for----\"    \"I'm--I'm so surprised!\"    It was just what silly Ellen Carrington had said; damn it all, couldn't  the child understand that she was being given the chance of her  lifetime!    \"Come, come--isn't it a pleasant surprise?\"    She grew white, then red. \"I never thought of such a thing!\" she  exclaimed, in agitated apology.    \"Of course not, why should you? I quite understand. But it's easy enough  to think of now--eh?\"    Her hesitation inflamed him further; he hungered to kiss her, to hold  her in his arms--the first, and as long as he lived, the last man to do  so. Next moment his lips were on hers; she was enfolded, crushed to his  big body, almost suffocated, and to his intense satisfaction she made no  resistance....    To Stella it was like all she had heard about drowning, when a multitude  of impressions and memories were said to invade the mind in a  miraculously short space of time: Maud Verrall and her love adventures  and engagement; the spotty youth outside the Greystones gate; young  Capper the farmer; the lumber room at The Chestnuts, and her thirst for  India; and oddly, above all, the words of the familiar hymn that of a  sudden had exasperated her those many Sundays ago seemed to beat time to  the recollections:           I dare not choose my lot,         I would not if I might.      She was barely conscious of the present, hardly even of the determined  embrace that held her fast; only the past seemed real, and it was the  past that won. When he released her, flushed and breathless, she knew  she had dared to choose her lot once and for all; she was in the grip of  a wild excitement; she, Stella Carrington, was to be married, like Maud  Verrall, and she was going to India, to India! The doorway of life was  unlocked at last, presenting a wondrous vista, entrancing,  irresistible.... Then, blocking the doorway, she saw Colonel Crayfield,  bulky, triumphant, a masterful smile on his face.    \"Well, isn't it all right?\" And again he drew her to him, this time  gently, protectively, and with his arm about her they sauntered among  the vegetables and fruit bushes, while he held forth concerning the  future, Stella hearkening as in a dream. She knew he was speaking of his  position, of horses and clothes, of a piano, and a pearl necklace; but  it was of India she was thinking as she hung on his arm in childlike  gratitude. Was he not granting her the desire of her heart?    \"You are a sort of fairy godfather!\" she told him, laughing; \"perhaps  not exactly a _fairy_--more of a Santa Claus. I think I must call you  Santa-Sahib.\"    \"Call me what you like; but doesn't it spell Satan as well?\"    \"That will come in useful when you are disagreeable, cross with me.\"    \"I shall never be cross with you, my jewel, my pet!\"    Oh, it was all delightful, almost too good to be true.    But what about grandmamma? He said that grandmamma knew.    \"So you have made it all right with her?\" she exclaimed, with the kind  of sensation that is engendered by some lucky escape. How clever of him!  He was a wonder, her saviour, her deliverer. True, he was neither young  nor \"a picture,\" but one could not have everything, and Stella told  herself she was going to be quite as happy as Maud Verrall, very likely  far happier.    \"Just fancy!\" she sighed ecstatically. \"And if I had only known what was  coming when you found me in the larder! Isn't it a mercy that we both  like onions? Do tell me, when did you think of your ripping plan?\"    \"The first moment I set eyes on you at the station,\" he declared  untruthfully.    \"Oh! Then _now_ I know why you looked at me like that.\"    \"Like what?\"    \"You did--and then under the oak tree, too! I felt there was something.\"    \"Bright little star!\" Hiding a smile, he raised her hand and kissed each  pink finger-tip with deliberate"]]]
