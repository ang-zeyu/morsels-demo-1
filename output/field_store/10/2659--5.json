It is easy to  distinguish two types. One is large-boned and heavy-limbed,  hoarse-voiced, and masculine, like the \"Ibos\" of Bonny and New  Calabar, who equal the men in weight and stature, strength and  endurance, suggesting a mixture of the male and female  temperaments. Some of the Gaboon giantesses have, unlike their  northern sisters, regular and handsome features. The other type  is quasi-Hindú in its delicacy of form, with small heads, oval  faces, noses à la Roxolane, lips sub-tumid but without  prognathism, and fine almond-shaped eyes, with remarkably thick  and silky lashes. The throat is thin, the bosom is high and well  carried, or, as the admiring Arab says, \"nejdá;\" the limbs are  statuesque, and the hands and feet are Norman rather than Saxon.  Many Europeans greatly admire these minois mutins et  chiffonés.[FN#8]    Early in the present century the Mpongwe braided whiskers and  side curls, tipping the ends with small beads, and they plaited  the front locks to project like horns, after the fashion of the  present Fán and other wild tribes. A custom noticed by Barbot,  but apparently obsolete in the days of Bowdich, was to bore the  upper lip, and to insert a small ivory pin, extending from nose  to mouth. The painting and tattooing were fantastic and  elaborate; and there was a hideous habit of splitting either lip,  so as to \"thrust the tongue through on ceremonial occasions.\" A  curious reason is given for this practice. \"They are subject to a  certain distemper very common there, which on a sudden seizes  them, and casts them into fits of so long a continuance, that  they would inevitably be suffocated, if by means of the split at  their upper lip they did not pour into their mouths some of the  juice of a certain medicinal herb, which has the virtue of easing  and curing the diseased person in a very short time.\"    All these things, fits included, are now obsolete. The men shave  a line in the hair like a fillet round the skull, and what is  left is coiffe au coup de vent. The head-dress is a cap, a straw  hat, a billy cock, or a tall silk \"chimney pot,\" the latter  denoting a chief; he also sports in full dress a broad coat,  ending in a loin cloth of satin stripe or some finer stuff, about  six feet long by four and a half broad; it is secured by a  kerchief or an elastic waist belt; during work it is tucked up,  but on ceremonial occasions it must trail upon the ground. The  lieges wear European shirts, stuffed into a waist-cloth of  cheaper material, calico or domestics; This Tángá, or kilt, is,  in fact, an article of general wear, and it would be an airy,  comfortable, and wholesome travelling costume if the material  were flannel. The ornaments are necklaces of Venetian beads, the  white pound, and the black and yellow seed: Canutille or bugles  of various patterns are preferred, and all are loaded with  \"Mengo,\" Grígrís (which old travellers call \"gregories\"), or  talismans, chiefly leopards' teeth, rude bells, and horns. The  Monda are hunting prophylacteries, antelope horns filled with  \"fetish\" medicines, leopard's hair, burnt and powdered heart  mixed with leaves, and filth; the mouths are stopped with some  viscid black stuff, probably gum. They are often attached to rude  bells of iron or brass (Igelenga, Ngenge, Nkendo, or Wonga), like  the Chingufu of the Congo regions and the metal cones which are  struck for signals upon the Tanganyika Lake.    A great man is known by his making himself a marvellous \"guy,\"  wearing, for instance, a dingily laced cocked hat, stuck athwart-  ships upon an unwashed night-cap, and a naval or military  uniform, fifty years old, \"swearing\" with the loin-cloth and the  feet, which are always bare.    The coiffure of the <Greek>                is peculiar and  elaborate as that of the Gold Coast. These ladies seem to have  chosen for their model the touraco or cockatoo,--they have never  heard of \"Kikeriki,\"--and the effect is at first wondrously  grotesque. Presently the eye learns to admire pretty Fanny's  ways; perhaps the pleureuse, the old English corkscrew ringlet,  might strike the stranger as equally natural in a spaniel, and  unnatural in a human. Still a style so peculiar requires a  toilette in keeping; the \"king\" in uniform is less ridiculous  than the Gaboon lady's chignon, contrasting with a tight-bodied  and narrow-skirted gown of pink calico.    The national \"tire-valiant\" is a galeated crest not unlike the  cuirassier's helmet, and the hair, trained from the sides into a  high ridge running along the cranium, not unfrequently projects  far beyond the forehead. Taste and caprice produce endless  modifications. Sometimes the crest is double, disposed in  parallel ridges, with a deep hollow between; or it is treble,  when the two lines of parting running along the mastoids make it  remarkably like bears' ears, the central prism rises high, and  the side hair is plaited into little pig-tails. Others again  train four parallel lines from nape to forehead, forming two  cushions along the parietals. The crest is heightened by padding,  and the whole of the hair is devoted to magnifying it,--at a  distance, some of the bushwomen look as if they wore cocked hats.  When dreaded baldness appears, rosettes of false hair patch the  temples, and plaits of purchased wigs are interwoven to increase  the bulk: the last resources of all are wigs and toupets of  stained pine-apple fibre. The comb is unknown, its succedaneum  being a huge bodkin, like that which the Trasteverina has so  often used as a stiletto. This instrument of castigation is made  of ivory or metal, with a lozenge often neatly carved and  ornamented at the handle. The hair, always somewhat \"kinky,\" is  anointed every morning with palm-oil, or the tallow-like produce  of a jungle-nut; and, in full dress, it is copiously powdered  with light red or bright yellow dust of pounded camwood, redwood,  and various barks.    The ears are adorned with broad rings of native make, and, near  the trading stations, with French imitation jewellery. The neck  supports many strings of beads, long and short, with the  indispensable talismans. The body dress is a Tobe or loin-cloth,  like that of the men; but under the \"Námbá,\" or outer wrapper,  which hangs down the feet, there is a \"Siri,\" or petticoat,  reaching only to the knees. Both are gathered in front like the  Shukkah of the eastern coast, and the bosom is left bare. Few  except the bush-folk now wear the Ibongo, Ipepe, or Ndengi, the  woven fibres and grass-cloths of their ancestry; amongst the  hunters, however, a Tángá, or grass-kilt, may still be seen. The  exposure of the upper person shows the size and tumidity of the  areola, even in young girls; being unsupported, the mammae soon  become flaccid.    The legs, which are peculiarly neat and well turned, are made by  art a fitting set-off to the head. It is the pride of a Mpongwe  wife to cover the lower limb between knee and ankle with an  armour of metal rings, which are also worn upon the wrists; the  custom is not modern, and travellers of the seventeenth century  allude to them. The rich affect copper, bought in wires two feet  and a half long, and in two sizes; of the larger, four, of the  smaller, eight, go to the dollar; the brass are cheaper, as 5: 4;  and I did not see iron or tin. The native smiths make the  circles, and the weight of a full set of forty varies from  fifteen to nineteen pounds. They are separate rings, not a single  coil, like that used by the Wagogo and other East African tribes;  they press tightly on the limb, often causing painful chafes and  sores. The ankle is generally occupied by a brass or iron chain,  with small links. Girls may wear these rings, of which the  husband is expected to present a considerable number to his  bride, and the consequence is, that when in full dress she  waddles like a duck.    Commerce and intercourse with whites has made the Mpongwe, once  the rudest, now one of the most civilized of African tribes; and,  upon the whole, there is an improvement. The exact Barbot (iv. 9)  tells us \"the Gaboon blacks are barbarous, wild, bloody, and  treacherous, very thievish and crafty, especially towards  strangers. The women, on the contrary, are as civil and courteous  to them, and will use all possible means to enjoy their company;  but both sexes are the most wretchedly poor and miserable of any  in Guinea, and yet so very haughty, that they are perfectly  ridiculous ... They are all excessively fond of brandy and other  strong liquors of Europe and America ... If they fancy one has  got a mouthful more than another, and they are half drunk, they  will soon fall a-fighting, even with their own princes or priests  ... Their exceeding greediness for strong liquors renders them so  little nice and curious in the choice of them, that, though mixed  with half water, and sometimes a little Spanish soap put into it  to give it a froth, to appear of proof by the scum it makes, they  like it and praise it as much as the best and purest brandy.\"  Captain Boteler remarks, in 1827: \"The women do not speak  English; though, for the sake of what trifles they can procure  for their husbands, they are in the habit of flocking on board  the different vessels which visit the river, and will permit them  to remain; and the wives are generally maintained in clothing by  the proceeds of their intercourse with the whites.\" He further  assures us, that mulatto girls thus born are not allowed to  marry, although there is no such restriction for the males; and  elsewhere, he concludes, that never having seen an infant or an  adult offspring of mixed blood, abortion is practised as at  Delagoa and Old Calabar, where, in 1862, I found only one child  of mixed blood. If so, the Mpongwe have changed for the better.  Half-castes are now not uncommon; there are several nice \"yaller  gals\" well known on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5761"],[0,"Two Trips to Gorilla Land and the Cataracts of the Congo, Volume 2 (#10)"],[1,", and to offer a present of ivory and  of palm cloth which was remarkably strong and bright. A request  for a supply of mechanics and missionaries brought out the first  mission of Dominicans. They sailed in December, 1490, under  Gonçalo de Sousa; they were followed by others, and in the  sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the country was fairly over-  run by the Propaganda. A future page will enter into more  details, and show the results of their labours.    The original Padrão was destroyed by the Dutch in 1645, an act of  barbarism which is justly called \"Vandalica façanha.\" Father  Merolla says (1682), \"The Hollanders, out of envy, broke the fine  marble cross to pieces; nevertheless, so much remained of it,  when I was there, as to discover plainly the Portuguese arms on  the ruins of the basis, with an inscription under them in Gothic  characters, though not easy to be read.\" In 1859 a new one was  placed in Turtle Cove, a few yards south-west of Shark Point; but  the record was swept away by an unusually high tide, and no  further attempt has been made.    We were then led down a sandy narrow line in the bush, striking  south-east, and, after a few yards, we stood before two pieces of  marble in a sandy hollow. The tropical climate, more adverse than  that of London, had bleached and marked them till they looked  like pitted chalk: the larger stump, about two feet high, was  bandaged, as if after amputation, with cloths of many colours,  and the other fragment lay at its feet. Tom Peter, in a fearful  lingua-Franca, Negro-Anglo-Portuguese, told us that his people  still venerated the place as part of a religious building; it is  probably the remnant thus alluded to by Lopes de Lima (iii. 1-6):  \"Behind this point (Padrão) is another monument of the piety of  our monarchs, and of the holy objects which guided them to the  conquest of Guinea, a Capuchin convent intended to convert the  negroes of Sonho; it has long been deserted, and is still so.  Even in A.D. 1814, D. Garcia V., the king of Congo, complained in  a letter to our sovereign of the want of missionaries.\" Possibly  the ruined convent is the church which we shall presently visit.  Striking eastward, we soon came to a pool in the bush  sufficiently curious and out of place to make the natives hold it  \"Fetish;\" they declare that it is full of fish, but it kills all  men who enter it--\"all men\" would not include white men. Possibly  it is an old piscina; according to the Abbé Proyart, the  missionaries taught the art of pisciculture near the village of  Kilonga, where they formed their first establishment. The place  is marked \"Salt-pond\" in Barbot, who tells us that the condiment  was made there and carried inland.    A short walk to a tall tree backing the village showed us,  amongst twenty-five European graves, five tombs or cenotaphs of  English naval officers, amongst whom two fell victims to  mangrove-oysters, and the rest to the deadly \"calenture\" of the  lower Congo. We entered the foul mass of huts,                        \"Domus non ullo robore fulta            Sed sterili junco cannâque intecta palustri.\"    It was too early for the daily debauch of palm wine, and the  interiors reeked with the odours of nocturnal palm oil. The older  travellers were certainly not blasés; they seemed to find  pleasure and beauty wherever they looked: Ca da Mosto (1455),  visiting the Senegal, detected in this graveolent substance, fit  only for wheel-axles, a threefold property, that of smelling like  violets, of tasting like oil of olives, and tinging victuals like  saffron, with a colour still finer. Even Mungo Park preferred the  rancid tallow-like shea butter to the best product of the cow. We  chatted with the Shark Point wreckers, and found that they  thought like Arthegal,              \"For equal right in equal things doth stand.\"    Moreover, here, as in the Shetlands of the early nineteenth  century, when the keel touches bottom the seaman loses his  rights, and she belongs to the shore.    Tom Peter offered to show us other relics of the past if we would  give him two days. A little party was soon made up, Mr. J. C.  Bigley, the master, and Mr. Richards, the excellent gunner of the  \"Griffon,\" were my companions. We set out in a south-by-easterly  direction to the bottom of Sonho, or Diogo's Bay, which Barbot  calls \"Bay of Pampus Rock.\" Thence we entered Alligator River, a  broad lagoon, the Raphael Creek of Maxwell's map, not named in  the hydrographic chart of 1859. Leading south with many a bend,  it is black water and thick, fetid mud, garnished with scrubby  mangrove, where Kru-boys come to cut fuel and catch fever; here  the dew seemed to fall in cold drops. After nine miles we reached  a shallow fork, one tine of which, according to our informants,  comes from the Congo Grande, or São Salvador, distant a week's  march. Leaving the whaler in charge of a Kru-man, we landed, and  walked about half a mile over loose sand bound by pine-apple  root, to the Banza Sonho, or, as we call it, King Antonio's Town-  -not to be mistaken for that placed in the charts behind Point  Padron. Our object being unknown, there was fearful excitement in  the thatched huts scattered under the palm grove, till Tom Peter  introduced us, and cleared for us a decent hut. The buildings, if  they can be so called, are poor and ragged, copies of those which  we shall see upon the uplands. Presently we were visited by the  king named after that saint \"of whom the Evil One was parlous  afraid.\" This descendant of the \"Counts of Sonho,\" in his dirty  night-cap and long coat of stained red cloth, was a curious  contrast to the former splendour of the \"count's habit,\" with cap  of stitched silk which could be worn only by him and his nobles,  fine linen shirt, flowered silk cloak, and yellow stockings of  the same material. When King Affonso III. gave audience to the  missioners (A.D. 1646), the negro grandee \"had on a vest of cloth  set with precious stones, and in his hat a crown of diamonds,  besides other stones of great value. He sat on a chair under a  canopy of rich crimson velvet, with gilt nails, after the manner  of Europe; and under his feet was a great carpet, with two stools  of the same colour, and silk laced with gold.\" After the usual  palaver we gave the black earl a cloth and bottle of rum for  leave to pass on, but no one would accompany us that evening, all  pretending that they wanted time to fit up the hammocks. At night  a body of armed bushmen marched down to inspect us.    The demands for porterage were so exorbitant next morning, that  we set out on foot under the guidance of Tom Peter. We passed  southwards over large tracts of bush and gramineous plants, with  patches of small plantations, manioc and thur; and settlements  girt by calabash-trees, cocoas, palmyra and oil palms. The people  poured out, threatened impotent vengeance on those who brought  the white men to \"make their country,\" that is, to seize and  settle in it. The only animals were fowls and pigs; small strong  cages acting as hogstyes showed that leopards were dangerous; in  1816 Lieutenant Hawkey found signs of these animals, together  with elephant, wild boar, and antelope. Now there is no sport  below the cataracts, and possibly very little, except in the  water, above them. Thence we debouched upon rolling land, loose  and sandy waves, sometimes divided by swamps; it is the lower end  of the high yellow band seen from the south of the river, the  true coast of alluvial soil, scattered here and there with quartz  and pebbles. Then the bush opened out, and showed to the north-  east stretches of grassy land, where the wild fig-tree drooped  its branches, laden with thick fleshy leafage, to the ground;  these are the black dots which are seen from afar studding the  tawny desert-like surface. Flowers were abundant despite the  lateness of the season, and the sterility of the soil was  evidenced by cactus and euphorbia.    After a walk of six miles Tom Peter pompously announced that we  had reached the church. We saw only an oblong furrow and a little  worm-eaten wood near three or four of the most miserable  \"magalia;\" but a bell, hung to a dwarf gallows, was dated 1700,  and inscribed, \"Si Deus cum nobis Qis (sic) contra nos?\" The  aspect of this article did not fail to excite Mr. Richards'  concupiscence: I looked into the empty huts, and in the largest  found a lot of old church gear, the Virgin (our Lady of Pinda),  saints, and crucifixes, a tank-like affair of iron that acted as  font, and tattered bundles of old music-scores in black and red  ink. In Captain Tuckey's day some of the Sonho men could read the  Latin Litany; there was a priest ordained by the Capuchins of  Loanda, a bare-footed (and bare-faced) black apostle, with a wife  and five handmaids; and a multitude of converts loaded with  crucifixes and satchels of relics. Our home march was enlivened  by glimpses of the magnificent river seen through the perennial  tropical foliage, and it did not suggest trite reflections upon  the meanness of man's highest aspirations in presence of eternal  Nature.    We had been treading upon no vulgar spot. We are now in the  earldom of Sonho, bounded north by the Congo River and south by  the Ambriz, westward by the Atlantic, and eastward by the \"Duchy  of Bamba.\" It was one of the great divisions of the Congo  kingdom, and \"absolute, except only its being tributary to the  Lord Paramount.\" The titles of Portugal were adopted by the  Congoese, according to Father Cavazzi, after A.D. 1571, when the  king constituted himself a vassal of the Portuguese crown. Here  was the Pinda whose port and fort played an important part in  local history. \"Built by the Sonhese army at the mouth of the  River Zaire,\" it commanded both the stream and sea: it was  plundered in 1600 by four French pirates. According to Carli  (1666-67) \"the Count of Sonho, the fifth dignitary of the"]]]
