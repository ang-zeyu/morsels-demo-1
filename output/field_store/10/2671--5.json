The Jews were famous for fine work      in stone, as is shown by the buildings of Jerusalem, and a similar      excellence in this art is seen in the American ruins. The Mexicans      have a tradition of a journey undertaken at the command of a god,      and continued for a long time under the direction of certain high      priests, who miraculously obtained supplies for their support, this      bears a striking resemblance to the Hebrew story of the wandering      in the desert. [2] * * * * Moreover, many traces of their old laws      and ceremonies are to be found among them at the present day.      For instance, both Jews and Americans gave their temple into the      charge of priests, burned incense, anointed the body, practiced      circumcision, kept perpetual fires on their altars, forbade women      to enter the temple immediately after giving birth, and husbands      to sleep with their wives for seven days during the period of      menstruation, prohibiting marriage or sexual intercourse between      relatives within the second degree, made fornication with a slave      punishable, slew the adulterer, made it unlawful for a man to dress      like a woman, or a woman like a man, put away their brides if they      prove to have lost their virginity, kept the ten commandments.    Answering the objection that the American Indians do not speak Hebrew,  Garcia says:        But the reason for this is that the language has gradually changed,      as has been the case with all tongues. Witness the Hebrew spoken      by the Jews at the present time, which is much corrupted and very      different from what is originally was. There do actually exist,      besides, many Hebraic traces in the American languages. [3]    II.    _Lord Kingsborough's Views._    The main items of Lord Kingsborough's evidences and arguments are thus  summarized by Bancroft:        The religion of the Mexicans strongly resembled that of the Jews,      in many minor details, as will be presently seen, and the two were      practically alike, to a certain extent in their very foundation;      for, as the Jews acknowledged a multitude of angels, arch-angels,      principalities, thrones, dominions, and powers, as the subordinate      personages of their hierarchy, so did the Mexicans acknowledge      the unity of the deity in the person of Tezcatlipoca, and at the      same time worship a great number of other imaginary beings. Both      believed in a plurality of devils subordinate to one head, who was      called by the Mexicans Mictlantecutli, and by the Jews Satan. * *      * * * * It is probable that the Toltecs were acquainted with the      sin of the first man committed at the suggestion of the woman,      herself deceived by the serpent, who tempted her with the fruit of      the forbidden tree, who was the origin of all our calamities, and      by whom death came into the world. We have seen in this chapter      that Kingsborough supposes the Messiah and his story to have      been familiar to the Mexicans. There is reason to believe that      the Mexicans, like the Jews, offered meat and drink offerings      to stones. There are striking similarities between the Babel,      flood, and creation myths of the Hebrews and the Americans. Both      Jews and Mexicans were fond of appealing in their adjurations to      the heaven and the earth. Both were extremely superstitious, and      firm believers in prodigies. * * * * It is very probable that the      Sabbath of the seventh day was known in some parts of America.      The Mexicans applied the blood of sacrifices to the same uses as      the Jews; they poured it upon the earth, they sprinkled it, they      marked persons with it, and they smeared it upon walls and other      inanimate things. No one but the Jewish high priest might enter the      Holy of Holies. A similar custom obtained in Peru. Both Mexicans      and Jews regarded certain animals as unclean and unfit for food.      Some of the Americans believed with some of the Talmudists in a      plurality of souls. That man was created in the image of God was      a part of the Mexican belief. It was customary among the Mexicans      to eat the flesh of sacrifices of atonement. There are many points      of resemblance between Tezcatlipoca and Jehovah. Ablutions formed      an essential part of the ceremonial law of the Jews and Mexicans.      The opinions of the Mexicans with regard to the resurrection of the      body, accorded with those of the Jews. The Mexican temple, like the      Jewish, faced the east. \"As amongst the Jews the ark was a sort of      portable temple in which the deity was supposed to be continually      present, and which was accordingly borne on the shoulders of the      priests as a sure refuge and defense from their enemies, so amongst      the Mexicans and the Indians of Michoacan and Honduras an ark was      held in the highest veneration, and was considered an object too      sacred to be touched by any but the priests. * * * * * The Yucatec      conception of a trinity resembles the Hebrews. It is probable that      Quetzalcohuatl whose proper name signifies \"feathered serpent,\"      was so called after the brazen serpent which Moses lifted up in      the wilderness, the feathers perhaps alluding to the rabbinical      tradition that the fiery serpents which god sent against the      Israelites were of a winged species. The Mexicans, like the Jews,      saluted the four cardinal points, in their worship. There was much      in connection with sacrifices that was common to Mexicans and Jews.      * * * * * * In various religious rites and observances, such as      circumcision, confession, and communion, there was much similarity.      Salt was an article highly esteemed by the Mexicans, and the Jews      always offered it in their oblations. Among the Jews, the firstling      of an ass had to be redeemed with a lamb, or if unredeemed, its      neck was broken. This command of Moses should be considered in      reference to the custom of sacrificing children which existed in      Mexico and Peru. The spectacle of a king performing a dance as an      act of religion was witnessed by the Jews as well as by Mexicans.      As the Israelites were conducted from Egypt by Moses and Aaron who      were accompanied by their sister Miriam, so the Aztecs departed      from Astlan under the guidance of Huitziton and Tecpatzin, the      former of whom is named by Acosta and Herrera, Mexi, attended      likewise by their sister Quilaztli, or, as she is otherwise named,      Chimalman or Malinalli, both of which latter names have some      resemblance to Miriam, as Mexi has to Moses. * * * * * * * It is      impossible, on reading what Mexican mythology records of the war      in heaven and of the fall of Tzontemoc and the other rebellious      spirits; of the creation of light by the word of Tonacatecutli, and      of the division of the waters; of the sin of Ytztlacoliuhqui, and      his blindness and nakedness; of the temptation of Suchiquecal, and      her disobedience in gathering roses from a tree, and the consequent      misery and disgrace of herself and her posterity--not to recognize      scriptural analogies. Other Hebrew analogies Lord Kingsborough      finds in America, in the dress, insignia, and duties of priests;      in innumerable superstitions concerning dreams, apparitions,      eclipses, and other more common-place events; in certain festivals      for rain; in burial and mourning ceremonies; in the diseases most      common among the people; in certain regularly observed festivals;      in the dress of certain nations; in established laws; in physical      features; in architecture; in various minor observances, such as      offering water to a stranger that he might wash his feet, eating      dust in token of humility, anointing with oil, and so forth; in      the sacrifice of prisoners; in manner and style of oratory; in      the stories of giants; in respect paid to God's name; in games      of chance; in marriage relations; in childbirth ceremonies; in      religious ideas of all sorts; in respect paid to kings; in uses of      metals; in treatment of criminals, and punishment of crimes; in      charitable practices; in social customs; and in a vast number of      other particulars. [4]    III.    _Adair's Evidences._    Following is the summary of Adair's evidences and arguments:        The Israelites were divided into tribes and had chiefs over them,      so the Indians divided themselves: each tribe forming a little      community within the nation. And as the nation hath its particular      symbol, so from nation to nation among them we shall not find one      individual who doth not distinguish himself by his family name.      Every town has a state house or synedrion, the same as the Jewish      Sanhedrim, where almost every night the head men meet to discuss      public business. The Hebrew nation were ordered to worship Jehovah      the true and living God, who by the Indians is styled Yohewah. The      ancient heathens, it is well known worshiped a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59970"],[0,"The Life of Joseph Smith, the Prophet (#10)"],[1,"him to the centre. He  humbled himself in prayer and repentance; and so true was his humility  that the Lord accepted it as expiation and the treasures were restored  to his keeping.    Martin Harris was also shamed and grieved; and he repented in anguish  the violation of his trust. But, though a measure of confidence was  restored to him, he was never again permitted to act as a scribe for  the Prophet in the work of translation.    While Joseph was mourning the loss of the manuscript, the Lord revealed  to him many truths regarding the situation to which he had brought  himself, and also warned him of the designs of wicked men who plotted  to overthrow him and to put the name of God and His newly revealed  record to shame in the land.    A rebuke was given at this time in words which Joseph always remembered:        Although a man may have many revelations, and have power to do many      mighty works; yet, if he boasts in his own strength, and sets at      naught the counsels of God, and follows after the dictates of his      own will and carnal desires, he must fall and incur the vengeance      of a just God upon him.    While these momentous events were in progress, Joseph and his wife were  called to mourn. In July, 1828, a son was born to their house, but  the babe died after a brief time, leaving its mother at the door of  dissolution. The needs of the little household now required that the  Prophet should give a time to toil; and he went forth to labor humbly  and uncomplainingly.    While he was thus engaged, in the month of February, 1829, he received  a comforting revelation from the Almighty:        Now behold, a marvelous work is about to come forth among the      children of men: * * * * *        For behold the field is white already to harvest, and lo, he that      thrusteth in his sickle with his might, the same layeth up in store      that he perish not, but bringeth salvation to his soul.    Joseph's desire to atone for his loss of the first manuscript impelled  him to constant exertion. After his manual toil was ended each day, he  contritely devoted his hours to the work of translation; and his young  wife aided him by writing at his dictation. In this way some progress  was made. But Emma was bowed with bodily suffering and with sorrow for  her babe; and often the holy task languished, causing Joseph to pray  earnestly to God for a writer who could give his whole time to the work.        CHAPTER IX.    OLIVER COWDERY IS SENT OF HEAVEN TO AID THE PROPHET--THE AARONIC  PRIESTHOOD IS BROUGHT TO EARTH BY CHRIST'S FORERUNNER--FIRST BAPTISMS  OF THIS DISPENSATION.    Almost a year had passed from the day upon which Martin Harris began  his service as a scribe for Joseph, when once more an earthly messenger  of help appeared to the Prophet.    It was at the hour of sunset on the Sabbath day, April 5th, 1829, when  Oliver Cowdery came to the Prophet's door--in Harmony, Susquehanna  County, state of Pennsylvania. This young man, Oliver Cowdery, a  school teacher, had been carried in the autumn of the year 1828, in  fulfillment of an engagement, to the town of Manchester, New York.  Hearing there of the angelic visitations to the unlearned farm-lad,  Joseph Smith, he was led to a deep and prayerful investigation of the  subject. A powerful conviction that Joseph had been ministered to by  heavenly beings, as he had testified, was wrought upon Oliver's mind,  and he asked the Lord for direct guidance. His prayer was answered, and  the Lord made plain to him that his would be the privilege and the duty  to aid the young Prophet as a scribe or secretary. Situated as Oliver  Cowdery was, he needed inspiration from the Almighty to enable him  to decide to accept such a mission; for around and within the little  village of Manchester at that dark hour surged the spirits of hatred,  cruelty, falsehood and even murder, and no man from any selfish wish,  would have cared to ally himself in acts or sympathetic words with  the cause and the man condemned by all the power of the pulpit. As  soon as he could gain honorable release from his school duties, Oliver  journeyed to Pennsylvania and presented himself to Joseph as one who  had a wish to serve God and aid His chosen servant.    This was the first conversion by the testimony of the Spirit of one who  had not seen the Prophet. The Church speaks for itself of the hundreds  of thousands of honest souls who have had the testimony of the Holy  Ghost since that hour.    Joseph accepted Oliver as the embodied answer to his prayer for help;  and on Tuesday, the 7th day of April, 1829--two days after they had  first beheld each other in the flesh--the Prophet began dictating to  Oliver in continuance of the work of translation. While they labored  the revelations of God came to them in guidance of their daily work, in  support of their hopes and in the enlargement of their understandings  concerning the principles of salvation.    As they progressed, they encountered a passage of the revealed record  which spoke of baptism for the remission of sins. Deeply imbued with  the sense of their great responsibility, Joseph and Oliver felt as  if a personal message had come to them, requiring their compliance  with some sacred observance. They talked together long and earnestly  upon the subject; and one day in the month of May, 1829, they went  into the woods together and knelt before the Lord. They asked Him for  light concerning the matter of baptism for the remission of sins.  While kneeling with uncovered heads and lifting up their voices in  supplication, a messenger of Heaven, clothed in dazzling glory,  descended before their eyes. As in the other visitations which had come  to the Prophet alone, this personage was also surrounded by a supernal  light. He stated to them that he was John, known as John the Baptist  at the time of Christ; and that he had come to minister to them, being  under the direction of Peter, James and John, the apostles who still  held the keys of the priesthood after the order of Melchisedec. He laid  his hands upon their heads and said:        Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah, I confer the      priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of      angels and of the gospel of repentance and of baptism by immersion      for the remission of sins; and this shall never be taken again from      the earth until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering unto      the Lord in righteousness.    Then this heavenly personage, concerning whom the Savior Himself had  said: \"Among those that are born of women, there is not a greater  prophet than John the Baptist,\" and whose unique and glorious privilege  it had been while in mortality to administer the ordinance of baptism  to the Son of God, instructed them in the duties of the Aaronic  priesthood to which they had just been ordained. He said to Joseph and  Oliver that the Aaronic priesthood did not possess the authority to  bestow the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, but that  such power belonged to the priesthood of Melchisedec, which in due time  would be conferred upon them. John then commanded them that they should  go forth unto the water: and by the authority which he had transmitted  to them they should each baptize the other--Joseph to immerse Oliver  first, and then Oliver to perform the same office for Joseph; and that  each should, following baptism, re-ordain the other to the priesthood  after the order of Aaron. Later, they would receive the Melchisedec  priesthood and be ordained as elders; Joseph to be first and Oliver  second.    When John left them and ascended in his encircling pillar of light,  they went straightway to perform the command which they had received.  Joseph led Oliver down into the water, and, by authority which he had  received, the Prophet immersed his companion for the remission of sin.  As soon as this was done, Oliver immersed Joseph in the same manner  and by the same authority. They came up together out of the water; and  ordained each other to the Aaronic priesthood.    No sooner had they fulfilled the requirements left with them by John  than they felt the power of holiness resting upon them. Each one of  them had instantly the gift of mighty prophecy. Joseph saw and foretold  the establishment of a Church founded upon the rock of righteousness;  having the everlasting Gospel; proclaiming the truth to all the nations  of the earth; fulfilling the destiny designed by God in the redemption  of humanity from darkness and misery. Oliver, too, prophesied of many  glorious things, both for his own comfort and that of Joseph.    Thus filled with sublime delight, entertaining more hope and courage  than ever before, they returned to their labor of translation. If  anything had been wanting to banish every worldly thought from their  minds and to fill them with a zealous desire to hasten the work, the  promise of John supplied that requirement. Having so far been permitted  to partake of the blessings and ordinances enjoyed by the chosen  servants of Christ in another age; and having a promise that through  faithfulness they should enjoy other gifts of this holy nature, nothing  could restrain their ardor.    The bitter experience which Joseph had endured, through communicating  so freely the glorious manifestations which he had received, taught him  caution. When he received his first communications from heaven, he had  supposed that he could relate what had occurred and the tidings would  be gladly received; but he soon learned, as so many of those who have  since espoused the truth have also learned, that the words of caution  given by the Lord Jesus to His disciples, concerning giving that which  is holy unto the dogs and casting their pearls before swine, were as  applicable to these times as they were when He gave them. There was a  class of persons who would trample such precious things under their  "]]]
