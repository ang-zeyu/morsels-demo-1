Like everything else in  these romances, it is a gross exaggeration of the real sentiment of  chivalry, but its peculiar extravagance is probably due to the influence  of those masters of hyperbole, the Provencal poets. When a troubadour  professed his readiness to obey his lady in all things, he made it  incumbent upon the next comer, if he wished to avoid the imputation of  tameness and commonplace, to declare himself the slave of her will, which  the next was compelled to cap by some still stronger declaration; and so  expressions of devotion went on rising one above the other like biddings  at an auction, and a conventional language of gallantry and theory of  love came into being that in time permeated the literature of Southern  Europe, and bore fruit, in one direction in the transcendental worship of  Beatrice and Laura, and in another in the grotesque idolatry which found  exponents in writers like Feliciano de Silva. This is what Cervantes  deals with in Don Quixote's passion for Dulcinea, and in no instance has  he carried out the burlesque more happily. By keeping Dulcinea in the  background, and making her a vague shadowy being of whose very existence  we are left in doubt, he invests Don Quixote's worship of her virtues and  charms with an additional extravagance, and gives still more point to the  caricature of the sentiment and language of the romances.    One of the great merits of \"Don Quixote,\" and one of the qualities that  have secured its acceptance by all classes of readers and made it the  most cosmopolitan of books, is its simplicity. There are, of course,  points obvious enough to a Spanish seventeenth century audience which do  not immediately strike a reader now-a-days, and Cervantes often takes it  for granted that an allusion will be generally understood which is only  intelligible to a few. For example, on many of his readers in Spain, and  most of his readers out of it, the significance of his choice of a  country for his hero is completely lost. It would be going too far to say  that no one can thoroughly comprehend \"Don Quixote\" without having seen  La Mancha, but undoubtedly even a glimpse of La Mancha will give an  insight into the meaning of Cervantes such as no commentator can give. Of  all the regions of Spain it is the last that would suggest the idea of  romance. Of all the dull central plateau of the Peninsula it is the  dullest tract. There is something impressive about the grim solitudes of  Estremadura; and if the plains of Leon and Old Castile are bald and  dreary, they are studded with old cities renowned in history and rich in  relics of the past. But there is no redeeming feature in the Manchegan  landscape; it has all the sameness of the desert without its dignity; the  few towns and villages that break its monotony are mean and commonplace,  there is nothing venerable about them, they have not even the  picturesqueness of poverty; indeed, Don Quixote's own village,  Argamasilla, has a sort of oppressive respectability in the prim  regularity of its streets and houses; everything is ignoble; the very  windmills are the ugliest and shabbiest of the windmill kind.    To anyone who knew the country well, the mere style and title of \"Don  Quixote of La Mancha\" gave the key to the author's meaning at once. La  Mancha as the knight's country and scene of his chivalries is of a piece  with the pasteboard helmet, the farm-labourer on ass-back for a squire,  knighthood conferred by a rascally ventero, convicts taken for victims of  oppression, and the rest of the incongruities between Don Quixote's world  and the world he lived in, between things as he saw them and things as  they were.    It is strange that this element of incongruity, underlying the whole  humour and purpose of the book, should have been so little heeded by the  majority of those who have undertaken to interpret \"Don Quixote.\" It has  been completely overlooked, for example, by the illustrators. To be sure,  the great majority of the artists who illustrated \"Don Quixote\" knew  nothing whatever of Spain. To them a venta conveyed no idea but the  abstract one of a roadside inn, and they could not therefore do full  justice to the humour of Don Quixote's misconception in taking it for a  castle, or perceive the remoteness of all its realities from his ideal.  But even when better informed they seem to have no apprehension of the  full force of the discrepancy. Take, for instance, Gustave Dore's drawing  of Don Quixote watching his armour in the inn-yard. Whether or not the  Venta de Quesada on the Seville road is, as tradition maintains, the inn  described in \"Don Quixote,\" beyond all question it was just such an  inn-yard as the one behind it that Cervantes had in his mind's eye, and  it was on just such a rude stone trough as that beside the primitive  draw-well in the corner that he meant Don Quixote to deposit his armour.  Gustave Dore makes it an elaborate fountain such as no arriero ever  watered his mules at in the corral of any venta in Spain, and thereby  entirely misses the point aimed at by Cervantes. It is the mean, prosaic,  commonplace character of all the surroundings and circumstances that  gives a significance to Don Quixote's vigil and the ceremony that  follows.    Cervantes' humour is for the most part of that broader and simpler sort,  the strength of which lies in the perception of the incongruous. It is  the incongruity of Sancho in all his ways, words, and works, with the  ideas and aims of his master, quite as much as the wonderful vitality and  truth to nature of the character, that makes him the most humorous  creation in the whole range of fiction. That unsmiling gravity of which  Cervantes was the first great master, \"Cervantes' serious air,\" which  sits naturally on Swift alone, perhaps, of later humourists, is essential  to this kind of humour, and here again Cervantes has suffered at the  hands of his interpreters. Nothing, unless indeed the coarse buffoonery  of Phillips, could be more out of place in an attempt to represent  Cervantes, than a flippant, would-be facetious style, like that of  Motteux's version for example, or the sprightly, jaunty air, French  translators sometimes adopt. It is the grave matter-of-factness of the  narrative, and the apparent unconsciousness of the author that he is  saying anything ludicrous, anything but the merest commonplace, that give  its peculiar flavour to the humour of Cervantes. His, in fact, is the  exact opposite of the humour of Sterne and the self-conscious humourists.  Even when Uncle Toby is at his best, you are always aware of \"the man  Sterne\" behind him, watching you over his shoulder to see what effect he  is producing. Cervantes always leaves you alone with Don Quixote and  Sancho. He and Swift and the great humourists always keep themselves out  of sight, or, more properly speaking, never think about themselves at  all, unlike our latter-day school of humourists, who seem to have revived  the old horse-collar method, and try to raise a laugh by some grotesque  assumption of ignorance, imbecility, or bad taste.    It is true that to do full justice to Spanish humour in any other  language is well-nigh an impossibility. There is a natural gravity and a  sonorous stateliness about Spanish, be it ever so colloquial, that make  an absurdity doubly absurd, and give plausibility to the most  preposterous statement. This is what makes Sancho Panza's drollery the  despair of the conscientious translator. Sancho's curt comments can never  fall flat, but they lose half their flavour when transferred from their  native Castilian into any other medium. But if foreigners have failed to  do justice to the humour of Cervantes, they are no worse than his own  countrymen. Indeed, were it not for the Spanish peasant's relish of \"Don  Quixote,\" one might be tempted to think that the great humourist was not  looked upon as a humourist at all in his own country.    The craze of Don Quixote seems, in some instances, to have communicated  itself to his critics, making them see things that are not in the book  and run full tilt at phantoms that have no existence save in their own  imaginations. Like a good many critics now-a-days, they forget that  screams are not criticism, and that it is only vulgar tastes that are  influenced by strings of superlatives, three-piled hyperboles, and  pompous epithets. But what strikes one as particularly strange is that  while they deal in extravagant eulogies, and ascribe all manner of  imaginary ideas and qualities to Cervantes, they show no perception of  the quality that ninety-nine out of a hundred of his readers would rate  highest in him, and hold to be the one that raises him above all rivalry.    To speak of \"Don Quixote\" as if it were merely a humorous book would be a  manifest misdescription. Cervantes at times makes it a kind of  commonplace book for occasional essays and criticisms, or for the  observations and reflections and gathered wisdom of a long and stirring  life. It is a mine of shrewd observation on mankind and human nature.  Among modern novels there may be, here and there, more elaborate studies  of character, but there is no book richer in individualised character.  What Coleridge said of Shakespeare in minimis is true of Cervantes; he  never, even for the most temporary purpose, puts forward a lay figure.  There is life and individuality in all his characters, however little  they may have to do, or however short a time they may be before the  reader. Samson Carrasco, the curate, Teresa Panza, Altisidora, even the  two students met on the road to the cave of Montesinos, all live and move  and have their being; and it is characteristic of the broad humanity of  Cervantes that there is not a hateful one among them all. Even poor  Maritornes, with her deplorable morals, has a kind heart of her own and  \"some faint and distant resemblance to a Christian about her;\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5946"],[0,"The History of Don Quixote, Volume 2, Complete (#10)"],[1,"will.\"    \"Are you sure of all you say, husband?\" replied Teresa. \"Well, for all  that, I am afraid this rank of countess for my daughter will be her ruin.  You do as you like, make a duchess or a princess of her, but I can tell  you it will not be with my will and consent. I was always a lover of  equality, brother, and I can't bear to see people give themselves airs  without any right. They called me Teresa at my baptism, a plain, simple  name, without any additions or tags or fringes of Dons or Donas; Cascajo  was my father's name, and as I am your wife, I am called Teresa Panza,  though by right I ought to be called Teresa Cascajo; but 'kings go where  laws like,' and I am content with this name without having the 'Don' put  on top of it to make it so heavy that I cannot carry it; and I don't want  to make people talk about me when they see me go dressed like a countess  or governor's wife; for they will say at once, 'See what airs the slut  gives herself! Only yesterday she was always spinning flax, and used to  go to mass with the tail of her petticoat over her head instead of a  mantle, and there she goes to-day in a hooped gown with her broaches and  airs, as if we didn't know her!' If God keeps me in my seven senses, or  five, or whatever number I have, I am not going to bring myself to such a  pass; go you, brother, and be a government or an island man, and swagger  as much as you like; for by the soul of my mother, neither my daughter  nor I are going to stir a step from our village; a respectable woman  should have a broken leg and keep at home; and to be busy at something is  a virtuous damsel's holiday; be off to your adventures along with your  Don Quixote, and leave us to our misadventures, for God will mend them  for us according as we deserve it. I don't know, I'm sure, who fixed the  'Don' to him, what neither his father nor grandfather ever had.\"    \"I declare thou hast a devil of some sort in thy body!\" said Sancho. \"God  help thee, what a lot of things thou hast strung together, one after the  other, without head or tail! What have Cascajo, and the broaches and the  proverbs and the airs, to do with what I say? Look here, fool and dolt  (for so I may call you, when you don't understand my words, and run away  from good fortune), if I had said that my daughter was to throw herself  down from a tower, or go roaming the world, as the Infanta Dona Urraca  wanted to do, you would be right in not giving way to my will; but if in  an instant, in less than the twinkling of an eye, I put the 'Don' and 'my  lady' on her back, and take her out of the stubble, and place her under a  canopy, on a dais, and on a couch, with more velvet cushions than all the  Almohades of Morocco ever had in their family, why won't you consent and  fall in with my wishes?\"    \"Do you know why, husband?\" replied Teresa; \"because of the proverb that  says 'who covers thee, discovers thee.' At the poor man people only throw  a hasty glance; on the rich man they fix their eyes; and if the said rich  man was once on a time poor, it is then there is the sneering and the  tattle and spite of backbiters; and in the streets here they swarm as  thick as bees.\"    \"Look here, Teresa,\" said Sancho, \"and listen to what I am now going to  say to you; maybe you never heard it in all your life; and I do not give  my own notions, for what I am about to say are the opinions of his  reverence the preacher, who preached in this town last Lent, and who  said, if I remember rightly, that all things present that our eyes  behold, bring themselves before us, and remain and fix themselves on our  memory much better and more forcibly than things past.\"    These observations which Sancho makes here are the other ones on account  of which the translator says he regards this chapter as apocryphal,  inasmuch as they are beyond Sancho's capacity.    \"Whence it arises,\" he continued, \"that when we see any person well  dressed and making a figure with rich garments and retinue of servants,  it seems to lead and impel us perforce to respect him, though memory may  at the same moment recall to us some lowly condition in which we have  seen him, but which, whether it may have been poverty or low birth, being  now a thing of the past, has no existence; while the only thing that has  any existence is what we see before us; and if this person whom fortune  has raised from his original lowly state (these were the very words the  padre used) to his present height of prosperity, be well bred, generous,  courteous to all, without seeking to vie with those whose nobility is of  ancient date, depend upon it, Teresa, no one will remember what he was,  and everyone will respect what he is, except indeed the envious, from  whom no fair fortune is safe.\"    \"I do not understand you, husband,\" replied Teresa; \"do as you like, and  don't break my head with any more speechifying and rethoric; and if you  have revolved to do what you say-\"    \"Resolved, you should say, woman,\" said Sancho, \"not revolved.\"    \"Don't set yourself to wrangle with me, husband,\" said Teresa; \"I speak  as God pleases, and don't deal in out-of-the-way phrases; and I say if  you are bent upon having a government, take your son Sancho with you, and  teach him from this time on how to hold a government; for sons ought to  inherit and learn the trades of their fathers.\"    \"As soon as I have the government,\" said Sancho, \"I will send for him by  post, and I will send thee money, of which I shall have no lack, for  there is never any want of people to lend it to governors when they have  not got it; and do thou dress him so as to hide what he is and make him  look what he is to be.\"    \"You send the money,\" said Teresa, \"and I'll dress him up for you as fine  as you please.\"    \"Then we are agreed that our daughter is to be a countess,\" said Sancho.    \"The day that I see her a countess,\" replied Teresa, \"it will be the same  to me as if I was burying her; but once more I say do as you please, for  we women are born to this burden of being obedient to our husbands,  though they be dogs;\" and with this she began to weep in earnest, as if  she already saw Sanchica dead and buried.    Sancho consoled her by saying that though he must make her a countess, he  would put it off as long as possible. Here their conversation came to an  end, and Sancho went back to see Don Quixote, and make arrangements for  their departure.          CHAPTER VI.    OF WHAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HIS NIECE AND HOUSEKEEPER; ONE  OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CHAPTERS IN THE WHOLE HISTORY      While Sancho Panza and his wife, Teresa Cascajo, held the above  irrelevant conversation, Don Quixote's niece and housekeeper were not  idle, for by a thousand signs they began to perceive that their uncle and  master meant to give them the slip the third time, and once more betake  himself to his, for them, ill-errant chivalry. They strove by all the  means in their power to divert him from such an unlucky scheme; but it  was all preaching in the desert and hammering cold iron. Nevertheless,  among many other representations made to him, the housekeeper said to  him, \"In truth, master, if you do not keep still and stay quiet at home,  and give over roaming mountains and valleys like a troubled spirit,  looking for what they say are called adventures, but what I call  misfortunes, I shall have to make complaint to God and the king with loud  supplication to send some remedy.\"    To which Don Quixote replied, \"What answer God will give to your  complaints, housekeeper, I know not, nor what his Majesty will answer  either; I only know that if I were king I should decline to answer the  numberless silly petitions they present every day; for one of the  greatest among the many troubles kings have is being obliged to listen to  all and answer all, and therefore I should be sorry that any affairs of  mine should worry him.\"    Whereupon the housekeeper said, \"Tell us, senor, at his Majesty's court  are there no knights?\"    \"There are,\" replied Don Quixote, \"and plenty of them; and it is right  there should be, to set off the dignity of the prince, and for the  greater glory of the king's majesty.\"    \"Then might not your worship,\" said she, \"be one of those that, without  stirring a step, serve their king and lord in his court?\"    \"Recollect, my friend,\" said Don Quixote, \"all knights cannot be  courtiers, nor can all courtiers be knights-errant, nor need they be.  There must be all sorts in the world; and though we may be all knights,  there is a great difference between one and another; for the courtiers,  without quitting their chambers, or the threshold of the court, range the  world over by looking at a map, without its costing them a farthing, and  without suffering heat or cold, hunger or thirst; but we, the true  knights-errant, measure the whole earth with our own feet, exposed to the  sun, to the cold, to the air, to the inclemencies of heaven, by day and  night, on foot and on horseback; nor do we only know enemies in pictures,  but in their own real shapes; and at all risks and on all occasions we  attack them, without any regard to childish points or rules of single  combat, whether one has or has not a shorter lance or sword, whether one  carries relics or any secret contrivance about him, whether or not the  sun is to be divided and portioned out, and other niceties of the sort  that are observed in set combats of man to man, that you know nothing  about, but I do. And you must know besides, that the true knight-errant,  though he may see ten giants, that not only touch the clouds with their  heads but pierce them, and that go, each of them, on two tall towers by  way of legs, and whose arms are like the masts of mighty ships, and each  eye like a great mill-wheel, and glowing brighter than a glass furnace,  must not on any account be dismayed by them. On the contrary, he must  attack and fall upon them with a gallant"]]]
