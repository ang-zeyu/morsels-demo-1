(#10)"],[1," body making outward sign  of repose where inwardly is none.\"    Of course, it would have been best, all round, for Merlin to waive  etiquette and quit and call it half a day, since he would never be  able to start that water, for he was a true magician of the time;  which is to say, the big miracles, the ones that gave him his  reputation, always had the luck to be performed when nobody but  Merlin was present; he couldn't start this well with all this crowd  around to see; a crowd was as bad for a magician's miracle in  that day as it was for a spiritualist's miracle in mine; there was  sure to be some skeptic on hand to turn up the gas at the crucial  moment and spoil everything.  But I did not want Merlin to retire  from the job until I was ready to take hold of it effectively  myself; and I could not do that until I got my things from Camelot,  and that would take two or three days.    My presence gave the monks hope, and cheered them up a good deal;  insomuch that they ate a square meal that night for the first time  in ten days.  As soon as their stomachs had been properly reinforced  with food, their spirits began to rise fast; when the mead began to  go round they rose faster.  By the time everybody was half-seas over,  the holy community was in good shape to make a night of it; so we  stayed by the board and put it through on that line.  Matters got  to be very jolly.  Good old questionable stories were told that made  the tears run down and cavernous mouths stand wide and the round  bellies shake with laughter; and questionable songs were bellowed out  in a mighty chorus that drowned the boom of the tolling bells.    At last I ventured a story myself; and vast was the success of it.  Not right off, of course, for the native of those islands does  not, as a rule, dissolve upon the early applications of a humorous  thing; but the fifth time I told it, they began to crack in places;  the eight time I told it, they began to crumble; at the twelfth  repetition they fell apart in chunks; and at the fifteenth they  disintegrated, and I got a broom and swept them up.  This language  is figurative.  Those islanders--well, they are slow pay at first,  in the matter of return for your investment of effort, but in the end  they make the pay of all other nations poor and small by contrast.    I was at the well next day betimes.  Merlin was there, enchanting  away like a beaver, but not raising the moisture.  He was not in  a pleasant humor; and every time I hinted that perhaps this contract  was a shade too hefty for a novice he unlimbered his tongue and  cursed like a bishop--French bishop of the Regency days, I mean.    Matters were about as I expected to find them.  The \"fountain\" was  an ordinary well, it had been dug in the ordinary way, and stoned up  in the ordinary way.  There was no miracle about it.  Even the lie  that had created its reputation was not miraculous; I could have  told it myself, with one hand tied behind me.  The well was in a  dark chamber which stood in the center of a cut-stone chapel, whose  walls were hung with pious pictures of a workmanship that would  have made a chromo feel good; pictures historically commemorative  of curative miracles which had been achieved by the waters when  nobody was looking.  That is, nobody but angels; they are always  on deck when there is a miracle to the fore--so as to get put in  the picture, perhaps.  Angels are as fond of that as a fire company;  look at the old masters.    The well-chamber was dimly lighted by lamps; the water was drawn  with a windlass and chain by monks, and poured into troughs which  delivered it into stone reservoirs outside in the chapel--when  there was water to draw, I mean--and none but monks could enter  the well-chamber.  I entered it, for I had temporary authority  to do so, by courtesy of my professional brother and subordinate.  But he hadn't entered it himself.  He did everything by incantations;  he never worked his intellect.  If he had stepped in there and used  his eyes, instead of his disordered mind, he could have cured  the well by natural means, and then turned it into a miracle in  the customary way; but no, he was an old numskull, a magician who  believed in his own magic; and no magician can thrive who is  handicapped with a superstition like that.    I had an idea that the well had sprung a leak; that some of the  wall stones near the bottom had fallen and exposed fissures that  allowed the water to escape.  I measured the chain--98 feet.  Then  I called in a couple of monks, locked the door, took a candle, and  made them lower me in the bucket.  When the chain was all paid out,  the candle confirmed my suspicion; a considerable section of the  wall was gone, exposing a good big fissure.    I almost regretted that my theory about the well's trouble was  correct, because I had another one that had a showy point or two  about it for a miracle.  I remembered that in America, many  centuries later, when an oil well ceased to flow, they used to  blast it out with a dynamite torpedo.  If I should find this well  dry and no explanation of it, I could astonish these people most  nobly by having a person of no especial value drop a dynamite  bomb into it.  It was my idea to appoint Merlin.  However, it was  plain that there was no occasion for the bomb.  One cannot have  everything the way he would like it.  A man has no business to  be depressed by a disappointment, anyway; he ought to make up his  mind to get even.  That is what I did.  I said to myself, I am in no  hurry, I can wait; that bomb will come good yet.  And it did, too.    When I was above ground again, I turned out the monks, and let down  a fish-line; the well was a hundred and fifty feet deep, and there  was forty-one feet of water in it.  I called in a monk and asked:    \"How deep is the well?\"    \"That, sir, I wit not, having never been told.\"    \"How does the water usually stand in it?\"    \"Near to the top, these two centuries, as the testimony goeth,  brought down to us through our predecessors.\"    It was true--as to recent times at least--for there was witness  to it, and better witness than a monk; only about twenty or thirty  feet of the chain showed wear and use, the rest of it was unworn  and rusty.  What had happened when the well gave out that other  time?  Without doubt some practical person had come along and  mended the leak, and then had come up and told the abbot he had  discovered by divination that if the sinful bath were destroyed  the well would flow again.  The leak had befallen again now, and  these children would have prayed, and processioned, and tolled  their bells for heavenly succor till they all dried up and blew  away, and no innocent of them all would ever have thought to drop  a fish-line into the well or go down in it and find out what was  really the matter.  Old habit of mind is one of the toughest things  to get away from in the world.  It transmits itself like physical  form and feature; and for a man, in those days, to have had an idea  that his ancestors hadn't had, would have brought him under suspicion  of being illegitimate.  I said to the monk:    \"It is a difficult miracle to restore water in a dry well, but we  will try, if my brother Merlin fails.  Brother Merlin is a very  passable artist, but only in the parlor-magic line, and he may  not succeed; in fact, is not likely to succeed.  But that should  be nothing to his discredit; the man that can do _this_ kind of  miracle knows enough to keep hotel.\"    \"Hotel?  I mind not to have heard--\"    \"Of hotel?  It's what you call hostel.  The man that can do this  miracle can keep hostel.  I can do this miracle; I shall do this  miracle; yet I do not try to conceal from you that it is a miracle  to tax the occult powers to the last strain.\"    \"None knoweth that truth better than the brotherhood, indeed; for  it is of record that aforetime it was parlous difficult and took  a year.  Natheless, God send you good success, and to that end  will we pray.\"    As a matter of business it was a good idea to get the notion around  that the thing was difficult.  Many a small thing has been made  large by the right kind of advertising.  That monk was filled up  with the difficulty of this enterprise; he would fill up the others.  In two days the solicitude would be booming.    On my way home at noon, I met Sandy.  She had been sampling the  hermits.  I said:    \"I would like to do that myself.  This is Wednesday.  Is there  a matinee?\"    \"A which, please you, sir?\"    \"Matinee.  Do they keep open afternoons?\"    \"Who?\"    \"The hermits, of course.\"    \"Keep open?\"    \"Yes, keep open.  Isn't that plain enough?  Do they knock off at noon?\"    \"Knock off?\"    \"Knock off?--yes, knock off.  What is the matter with knock off?  I never saw such a dunderhead; can't you understand anything at all?  In plain terms, do they shut up shop, draw the game, bank the fires--\"    \"Shut up shop, draw--\"    \"There, never mind, let it go; you make me tired.  You can't seem  to understand the simplest thing.\"    \"I would I might please thee, sir, and it is to me dole and sorrow  that I fail, albeit sith I am but a simple damsel and taught of  none, being from the cradle unbaptized in those deep waters of  learning that do anoint with a sovereignty him that partaketh of  that most noble sacrament, investing him with reverend state to  the mental eye of the humble mortal who, by bar and lack of that  great consecration seeth in his own unlearned estate but a symbol  of that other sort of lack and loss which men do publish to the  pitying eye with sackcloth trappings whereon the ashes of grief  do lie bepowdered and bestrewn, and so, when such shall in the  darkness of his mind encounter these golden phrases of high mystery,  these shut-up-shops, and draw-the-game, and bank-the-fires, it is  but by the grace of God that he burst not for envy of the mind that  can beget, and tongue that can "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7254"],[0,"Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America, During the (#10)"],[1,"  various tributary streams of the Uraricuera, from the confluence of  the Tacutu to the Valle de la Inundacion.    We have shown above that the Spaniards took the Rio Paragua, or  Parava, which falls into the Carony, for a lake, because the word  parava signifies sea, lake, river. Parima seems also to denote vaguely  great water; for the root par is found in the Carib words that  designate rivers, pools, lakes, and the ocean.* (* In Persian the root  water (ab) is found also in lake (abdan). For other etymologies of the  words Parima and Manoa see Gili volume 1 pages 81 and 141; and Gumilla  volume 1 page 403.) In Arabic and in Persian, bahr and deria are also  applied at the same time to the sea, to lakes, and to rivers; and this  practice, common to many nations in both worlds, has, on our ancient  maps, converted lakes into rivers and rivers into lakes. In support of  what I here advance, I shall appeal to very respectable testimony,  that of Father Caulin. \"When I inquired of the Indians,\" says this  missionary, who sojourned longer than I on the banks of the Lower  Orinoco, \"what Parima was, they answered that it was nothing more than  a river that issued from a chain of mountains, the opposite side of  which furnished waters to the Essequibo.\" Caulin, knowing nothing of  lake Amucu, attributes the erroneous opinion of the existence of an  inland sea solely to the inundations of the plains (a las inundaciones  dilatadas por los bajos del pais). According to him, the mistakes of  geographers arise from the vexatious circumstance of all the rivers of  Guiana having different names at their mouths and near their sources.  \"I have no doubt,\" he adds, \"that one of the upper branches of the Rio  Branco is that very Rio Parima which the Spaniards have taken for a  lake (a quien suponian laguna).\" Such are the opinions which the  historiographer of the Expedition of the Boundaries had formed on the  spot. He could not expect that La Cruz and Surville, mingling old  hypotheses with accurate ideas, would reproduce on their maps the Mar  Dorado or Mar Blanco. Thus, notwithstanding the numerous proofs which  I have furnished since my return from America, of the non-existence of  an inland sea the origin of the Orinoco, a map has been published in  my name,* on which the Laguna Parima figures anew. (* Carte de  l'Amerique, dressee sur les Observations de M. de Humboldt, par Fried.  Vienna 1818.)    From the whole of these statements it follows, first, that the Laguna  Rupunuwini, or Parima of the voyage of Raleigh and of the maps of  Hondius, is an imaginary lake, formed by the lake Amucu* (* This is  the lake Amaca of Surville and La Cruz. By a singular mistake, the  name of this lake is transformed to a village on Arrowsmith's map.)  and the tributary streams of the Uraricuera, which often overflow  their banks; secondly, that the Laguna Parime of Surville's map is the  lake Amucu, which gives rise to the Rio Pirara and (conjointly with  the Mahu, the Tacutu, the Uraricuera, or Rio Parima, properly so  called) to the Rio Branco; thirdly, that the Laguna Parime of La Cruz  is an imaginary swelling of the Rio Parime (confounded with the  Orinoco) below the junction of the Mahu with the Xurumu. The distance  from the mouth of the Mahu to that of the Tacutu is scarcely 0 degrees  40 minutes; La Cruz enlarges it to 7 degrees of latitude. He calls the  upper part of the Rio Branco (that which receives the Mahu) Orinoco or  Purumu. There can be no doubt of its being the Xurumu, one of the  tributary streams of the Tacutu, which is well known to the  inhabitants of the neighbouring fort of San Joaquim. All the names  that figure in the fable of El Dorado are found in the tributary  streams of the Rio Branco. Slight local circumstances, joined to the  remembrances of the salt lake of Mexico, more especially of the  celebrated lake Manoa in the Dorado des Omaguas, have served to  complete a picture created by the imagination of Raleigh and his two  lieutenants, Keymis and Masham. The inundations of the Rio Branco, I  conceive, may be compared at the utmost to those of the Red River of  Louisiana, between Nachitoches and Cados, but not to the Laguna de los  Xarayes, which is a temporary swelling of the Rio Paraguay.* (*  Southey volume 1 page 130. These periodical overflowings of the Rio  Paraguay have long acted the same part in the southern hemisphere, as  lake Parima has been made to perform in the northern. Hondius and  Sanson have made the Rio de la Plata, the Rio Topajos (a tributary  stream of the Amazon), the Rio Tocantines, and the Rio de San  Francisco, issue from the Laguna de los Xarayes.)    We have now examined a White Sea,* (* That of D'Anville and La Cruz,  and of the greater part of the modern maps.) which the principal of  the Rio Branco is made to traverse; and another,* (* The lake of  Surville, which takes the place of lake Amucu.) which is placed on the  east of this river, and communicates with it by the Cano Pirara. A  third lake* (* The lake which Surville calls Laguna tenida hasta ahora  or La una Parime.) is figured on the west of the Rio Branco,  respecting which I found recently some curious details in the  manuscript journal of the surgeon Hortsmann. \"At the distance of two  days' journey below the confluence of the Mahu (Tacutu) with the Rio  Parima (Uraricuera) a lake is found on top of a mountain. This lake is  stocked with the same fish as the Rio Parima; but the waters of the  former are black, and those of the latter white.\" May not Surville,  from a vague notion of this basin, have imagined, in his map prefixed  to Father Caulin's work, an Alpine lake of ten leagues in length, near  which, towards the east, rise at the same time the Orinoco, and the  Rio Idapa, a tributary stream of the Rio Negro? However vague may be  the account of the surgeon of Hildesheim, it is impossible to admit  that the mountain, which has a lake at its summit, is to the north of  the parallel of 2 degrees 30 minutes: and this latitude coincides  nearly with that of the Cerro Unturan. Hence it follows that the  Alpine lake of Hortsmann, which has escaped the attention of  D'Anville, and which is perhaps situate amid a group of mountains,  lies north-east of the portage from the Idapa to the Mavaca, and  south-east of the Orinoco, where it goes up above Esmeralda.    Most of the historians who have treated of the first ages of the  conquest seem persuaded that the name provincias or pais del Dorado  denoted originally every region abounding in gold. Forgetting the  precise etymology of the word El Dorado (the gilded), they have not  perceived that this tradition is a local fable, as were almost all the  ancient fables of the Greeks, the Hindoos, and the Persians. The  history of the gilded man belongs originally to the Andes of New  Grenada, and particularly to the plains in the vicinity of their  eastern side: we see it progressively advance, as I observed above,  three hundred leagues toward the east-north-east, from the sources of  the Caqueta to those of the Rio Branco and the Essequibo. Gold was  sought in different parts of South America before 1536, without the  word El Dorado having been ever pronounced, and without the belief of  the existence of any other centre of civilization and wealth, than the  empire of the Inca of Cuzco. Countries which now do not furnish  commerce with the smallest quantities of the precious metals, the  coast of Paria, Terra Firma (Castillo del Oro), the mountains of Santa  Marta, and the isthmus of Darien, then enjoyed the same celebrity  which has been more recently acquired by the auriferous lands of  Sonora, Choco, and Brazil.    Diego de Ordaz (1531) and Alonzo de Herrera (1535) directed their  journeys of discovery along the banks of the Lower Orinoco. The former  is the famous Conquistador of Mexico, who boasted that he had taken  sulphur out of the crater of the Peak of Popocatepetl, and whom the  emperor Charles V permitted to wear a burning volcano on his armorial  bearings. Ordaz, named Adelantado of all the country which he could  conquer between Brazil and the coast of Venezuela, which was then  called the country of the German Company of Welsers (Belzares) of  Augsburg, began his expedition by the mouth of the Maranon. He there  saw, in the hands of the natives, \"emeralds as big as a man's fist.\"  They were, no doubt, pieces of that saussurite jade, or compact  feldspar, which we brought home from the Orinoco, and which La  Condamine found in abundance at the mouth of the Rio Topayos. The  Indians related to Diego de Ordaz that on going up during a certain  number of suns toward the west, he would find a large rock (pena) of  green stone; but before they reached this pretended mountain of  emerald (rocks of euphotide?) a shipwreck put an end to all farther  discovery. The Spaniards saved themselves with difficulty in two small  vessels. They hastened to get out of the mouth of the Amazon; and the  currents, which in those parts run with violence to the north-west,  led Ordaz to the coast of Paria where, in the territory of the cacique  Yuripari (Uriapari, Viapari), Sedeno had constructed the Casa fuerte  de Paria. This post being very near the mouth of the Orinoco, the  Mexican Conquistador resolved to attempt an expedition on this great  river. He sojourned first at Carao (Caroa, Carora), a large Indian  village, which appears to me to have been a little to the east of the  confluence of the Carony; he then went up the Cabruta (Cabuta,  Cabritu), and to the mouth of the Meta (Metacuyu), where he found  great difficulty in passing his boats through the Raudal of Cariven.  The Aruacas, whom Ordaz employed as guides, advised him to go up the  Meta; where, on advancing towards the west, they asserted he would  find men clothed, and gold in abundance. Ordaz pursued in preference  the navigation of the Orinoco, but the cataracts of Tabaje (perhaps  even those of the"]]]
