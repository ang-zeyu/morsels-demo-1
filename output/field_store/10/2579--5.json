In language full of boast and  threatening, Divico reminded Caesar of the humiliation inflicted formerly  on the Roman arms. The proconsul replied that he was not forgetful of  old affronts, but that recent injuries were sufficient motives for his  conduct. Nevertheless, he offered peace, on condition that they should  give him hostages. \"The Helvetii,\" replied Divico, \"have learned from  their ancestors to receive, but not to give, hostages; the Romans ought  to know that.\" This proud reply closed the interview.    Nevertheless, the Helvetii appear to have been desirous of avoiding  battle, for next day they raised their camp, and, cut off from the  possibility of following the course of the Saone to proceed towards the  south, they took the easiest way to reach the country of the Santones,  by directing their march towards the sources of the Dheune and the  Bourbince. (_See Plate 4._) This broken country, moreover, permitted  them to resist the Romans with advantage. They followed across the  mountains of Charolais the Gaulish road, on the trace of which was, no  doubt, subsequently constructed the Roman way from Lyons to Autun,  vestiges of which still exist; the latter followed the course of the  Saone as far as Belleville, where it parted from it abruptly, crossing  over the Col d'Avenas, proceeding through the valley of the Grosne to  Cluny, and continuing by Saint-Vallier to Autun. At Saint-Vallier they  would quit this road, and march towards the Loire to pass it at  Decize.[179]    Caesar followed the Helvetii, and sent before him all his cavalry to  watch their march. These, too eager in the pursuit, came to blows with  the enemy's cavalry in a position of disadvantage, and experienced some  loss. Proud of having repulsed 4,000 men with 500 horsemen, the Helvetii  became sufficiently emboldened to venture sometimes to harass the Roman  army. But Caesar avoided engaging his troops; he was satisfied with  following, day by day, the enemies at a distance of five or six miles at  most (about eight kilometres), opposing the devastations they committed  on their passage, and waiting a favourable occasion to inflict a defeat  upon them.    The two armies continued their march extremely slowly, and the days  passed without offering the desired opportunity. Meanwhile, the  provisionment of the Roman army began to inspire serious uneasiness;  wheat arrived no longer by the Saone, for Caesar had been obliged to move  from it in order to keep up with the Helvetii. On another hand, the AEdui  delayed, under vain pretexts, sending the grain which they had promised.  The harvest, too, was not yet ripe, and even forage failed. As the day  for distribution approached, Caesar convoked the AEduan chiefs, who were  numerous in his camp, and overwhelmed them with reproaches. One of them,  Liscus, occupied in his country the supreme magistracy, under the name  of _vergobret_; he denounced Dumnorix, the brother of Divitiacus, as  opposing the sending of provisions; it was the same Dumnorix who had  heretofore secretly negotiated the passage of the Helvetii across the  country of the Sequani, and who, placed at the head of the AEduan  contingent, had, in the last combat, by retreating with his men, led to  the flight of the whole body of the cavalry. Caesar sent for Divitiacus,  a man devoted to the Roman people, and revealed to him the culpable  conduct of his brother, which merited an exemplary punishment.  Divitiacus expressed the same opinion, but, in tears, implored the  pardon of Dumnorix. Caesar granted it to him, and contented himself with  placing him under surveillance. It was, indeed, good policy not to  alienate the AEduan people by any excessive severity against a man of  power among them.    The Helvetii, after advancing northward as far as Saint-Vallier, had  turned to the west to reach the valley of the Loire. Arrived near  Issy-l'Eveque, they encamped on the banks of a tributary of the Somme,  at the foot of Mount Tauffrin, eight miles from the Roman army. Informed  of this circumstance, Caesar judged that the moment had arrived for  attacking them by surprise, and sent to reconnoitre by what circuits the  heights might be reached. He learnt that the access was easy, and  ordered Labienus to gain, with two legions, the summit of the mountain  by bye-roads, without giving alarm to the enemy, and to wait till he  himself, marching at the head of the four other legions, by the same  road as the Helvetii, should appear near their camp; then both were to  attack them at the same time. Labienus started at midnight, taking for  guides the men who had just explored the roads. Caesar, on his part,  began his march at two o'clock in the morning (_de quarta  vigilia_),[180] preceded by his cavalry. At the head of his scouts was  P. Considius, whose former services under L. Sylla, and subsequently  under M. Crassus, pointed him out as an experienced soldier.    At break of day Labienus occupied the heights, and Caesar was no more  than 1,500 paces from the camp of the barbarians; the latter suspected  neither his approach nor that of his lieutenant. Suddenly Considius  arrived at full gallop to announce that the mountain of which Labienus  was to take possession was in the power of the Helvetii; he had  recognised them, he said, by their arms and their military ensigns. At  this news, Caesar, fearing that he was not in sufficient force against  their whole army, with only four legions, chose a strong position on a  neighbouring hill, and drew up his men in order of battle. Labienus,  whose orders were not to engage in battle till he saw the troops of  Caesar near the enemy's camp, remained immovable, watching for him. It  was broad daylight when Caesar learnt that his troops had made themselves  masters of the mountain, and that the Helvetii had left their camp. They  escaped him thus, through the false report of Considius, who had been  blinded by a groundless terror.    Admitting that the Helvetii had passed near Issy-l'Eveque, Mount  Tauffrin, which rises at a distance of four kilometres to the west of  that village, answers to the conditions of the text. There is nothing to  contradict the notion that Labienus and Caesar may have, one occupied the  summit, the other approached the enemy's camp within 1,500 paces,  without being perceived; and the neighbouring ground presents heights  which permitted the Roman army to form in order of battle.[181]      [Sidenote: Defeat of the Helvetii near Bibracte.]    VI. That day the Helvetii continued their advance to Remilly, on the  Alene. Since the passage of the Saone, they had marched about a  fortnight, making an average of not more than eleven or twelve  kilometres a day.[182] According to our reckoning, it must have been the  end of the month of June. Caesar followed the Helvetii at the usual  distance, and established his camp at three miles' distance from theirs,  on the Cressonne, near Ternant.    Next day, as the Roman army had provisions left for no more than two  days,[183] and as, moreover, Bibracte (_Mont Beuvray_),[184] the  greatest and richest town of the AEdui, was not more than eighteen miles  (twenty-seven kilometres) distant, Caesar, to provision his army, turned  from the road which the Helvetii were following, and took that to  Bibracte. (_See Plate 4._) The enemy was informed of this circumstance  by some deserters from the troop of L. Emilius, decurion[185] of the  auxiliary cavalry. Believing that the Romans were going from them  through fear, and hoping to cut them off from their provisions, they  turned back, and began to harass the rear-guard.    Caesar immediately led his troops to a neighbouring hill--that which  rises between the two villages called the Grand-Marie and the  Petit-Marie (_see Plate 5_)--and sent his cavalry to impede the enemies  in their march, which gave him the time to form in order of battle. He  ranged, half way up the slope of the hill, his four legions of veterans,  in three lines, and the two legions raised in the Cisalpine on the  plateau above, along with the auxiliaries, so that his infantry covered  the whole height. The heavy baggage, and the bundles (_sarcinae_)[186]  with which the soldiers were loaded, were collected on one point, which  was defended by the troops of the reserve. While Caesar was making these  dispositions, the Helvetii, who came followed by all their wagons,  collected them in one place; they then, in close order, drove back the  cavalry, formed in phalanxes, and, making their way up the slope of the  hill occupied by the Roman infantry, advanced against the first  line.[187]    Caesar, to make the danger equal, and to deprive all of the possibility  of flight, sends away the horses of all the chiefs, and even his  own,[188] harangues his troops, and gives the signal for combat. The  Romans, from their elevated position, hurl the _pilum_,[189] break the  enemy's phalanxes, and rush upon them sword in hand. The engagement  becomes general. The Helvetii soon become embarrassed in their  movements: their bucklers, pierced and nailed together by the same  _pilum_, the head of which, bending back, can no longer be withdrawn,  deprive them of the use of their left arm; most of them, after having  long agitated their arms in vain, throw down their bucklers, and fight  without them. At last, covered with wounds, they give way, and retire to  the mountain of the castle of La Garde, at a distance of about 1,000  paces; but while they are pursued, the Boii and the Tulingi, who, to the  number of about 15,000, formed the last of the hostile columns, and  composed the rear-guard, rush upon the Romans, and without halting  attack their right flank."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45542"],[0,"Eighteen Months in the War Zone (#10)"],[1,"becomes ice at once.    Having a free day, I explored the place from Le Portel, the quaint  little fishing village where fishwives, with their wide, hooped skirts,  their quaint poke bonnets or characteristic snowy white headgear and  clogs, predominate, to the St. Pierre quarter, cobbled like the new  town itself, but built in tier after tier of terraces, characterised by  an indescribable, if picturesque, squalor and dirt.    Everywhere we are followed by children begging for \"souvenirs.\" I  wonder what the state of our clothes would be had we cut off a uniform  button for each one who asked!    The tide is high up over the front to-day. Ambulances and cars are held  up on the Wimereux road. It is a wonderful sight, the big waves rolling  over the main road, whilst venturesome drivers who run the gauntlet  find their cars immovable in three feet of water and subject to the  ungentle washing of the sea.     [Illustration: AMBULANCES HELD UP BY THE HIGH TIDE]      _November 24th._ Being on night duty with a private patient who is  so restless that neither of us gets a minute's peace, I am having an  excellent opportunity of observing things as they are; and, after  all, there is plenty to be noted that will never be brought to light.      _November 29th._ In the morning when one comes off duty, full of  anticipation of the exhilarating morning walk, the joy of the clear,  cold sea air, there are usually plenty of odd jobs to be done. At  present we are engaged in making sandbags for those hospitals which are  destitute of them. In this we have the assistance of two small French  Boy Scouts who, having noticed us staggering under the load of our  baskets, volunteered to find a wheelbarrow and bring us up a certain  quantity of sand every morning.          CHAPTER III    December, 1914      _December 2nd_. They say that the Germans have been finally driven  back, that our men are enjoying a rest from the trenches, that many  officers have gone home on forty-eight hours' leave.    Converted motor-buses with boarded windows, all of steel-grey hue, come  down with loads of cheery though exhausted men on their way home.    Most of the cases in hospital are now medical, rheumatism and the  newest disease, \"trench feet,\" which was at first identified as  frost-bite. Each medical officer has a different method for treating  it. Most wrap the limbs in cotton-wool, but the agony the men go  through whilst \"thawing\" is awful. Many feet are already gangrenous and  have to be amputated.    They are again clearing out, which leads us to expect a big battle.    Rumour has it that Belgrade has fallen to the Austrians.      _December 6th._ Yesterday morning, having for some weeks back collected  with great avidity all kinds of comforts for the men, I took my goods  up to the convalescent camp that stands on the hill by the Calais road.  We obtained a lift in an ambulance and wallowed in the indescribable  mud at the camp. It had been a frightful night. Hail, wind, thunder,  lightning, blinding rain--the elements let loose! Several of the tents  were down, and the men shivered as they ambled about their light  fatigue work. The condition of the convalescents is pitiable. They  grabbed things like so many wild beasts; indeed, they had the look of  weary wild beasts in their eyes.    I don't know which were the more acceptable--cigarettes or old papers.  The former to soothe their racked nerves and warm them up in the  tempestuous weather, the latter to divert their attention, momentarily  at least, from their own sufferings. Undoubtedly the illustrated  journals are most useful. The men seem unable to concentrate their  attention on anything not pictorial.    We took them knitted things too--and even our own body belts and gloves  were requisitioned in the vain effort to make our gifts go round,  and we came home with hands stiff with cold.      _December 8th._ In the afternoon we were allowed a glimpse at the  Indian camp, where, after seeing the wards, conspicuous for their  neatness and order and the lack of nurses (all Indian hospitals are  staffed, needless to say, by orderlies), we were entertained for tea in  the officers' mess.    It was a picturesque sight, that tent lighted by two smoky oil-lamps,  by the light of which four doctors were playing cards as we entered.    As we sat over the camp fire of glowing coals in a perforated bucket  such as night watchmen warm their hands by in the raw London mornings,  a sudden squall arose, threatening to bring the tent down. One felt  like part of an Arctic expedition at the overhead crash, the icy blast,  and could not help surmising as to the thoughts of the Indians at the  caprices of the European climate as their great, wistful eyes rested on  the barren fields.    The tales of their pluck, recuperative powers, and apparent  imperviousness to pain are astounding. The medical officers told us  that it is almost impossible to keep them in bed. No sooner are they  round from an anaesthetic than they are up and smoking, quite oblivious  of an amputated limb!      _December 12th, 2 a.m._ A dark, starless morning, and we have just  arrived back from Dunkirk. The road to Calais, when we left twelve  hours ago, was fairly plain sailing.    There were the barriers to pass (some fifteen between Boulogne and  Dunkirk) where the \"laissez-passer,\" describing car, occupants,  destination and object of visit, etc., has to be shown; and in between  we scorched along at top speed, thankful for the fact that there is no  speed limit in France, and getting frozen through and through despite  our furs and rugs.    After Calais things grew more interesting. For the first time  entrenchments, barbed-wire defences and guns hove in sight, whilst here  and there the desolate stretches of country were relieved by figures  against the skyline--old women working in the fields, or a solitary  picket of soldiers.    We drew into Dunkirk about four o'clock; each of us had different  business to transact; the four men on Red Cross work, I on a visit to  Lady S----, in charge of a Belgian hospital.    Incidentally, there were the streets and houses to visit, destroyed  only yesterday by German bombs. A miserable spectacle they were, the  skeleton ruins in the pouring rain; no less miserable-looking than we,  covered in the thick Flanders mud that defied all efforts to keep it  out of the car.    It was almost dinner-time when we found ourselves at the C---- Hotel,  and, whilst the men were sipping their vermouth, we noticed a man  busily engaged in what _seemed_ to be letter- but what _proved_ to  be leader-writing. He introduced himself as C----, the _Daily Mail_  correspondent whose articles adorn the central pages of that paper.    Truly the path of the war correspondents of to-day lies along no bed of  roses! Eyed with suspicion by the authorities, forced to change their  abode daily, they lead the life of veritable refugees.    The dining-room was a fine sight, as by degrees it filled up, each  table resplendent with Belgian, French or British uniforms; and we were  loath to leave the warm hotel for the blinding rain without. Whilst  waiting for the car Mr. C---- entertained us at the piano; anything we  asked for he played--rag-time, opera, comedy, classical music. And the  last sound, rendered more beautiful by means of his exquisite touch,  that greeted us as we passed into the night was the haunting Barcarolle  from the _Tales of Hoffmann_.    It was at Gravelines that we lost our way, at about ten o'clock. It  was pitch dark. Nowhere a light visible, only the powerful acetylene  headlamps of the car. We tried to find the main road and instead found  ourselves back in the town. We made another effort, but failed. We  aroused the inhabitants of a house where there seemed to be a red glow  behind the closed shutters.    \"Tout droit,\" they told us.    We went \"tout droit,\" and found ourselves back again. We fetched out  the proprietor of a hopeful-looking bar.    \"Tout droit,\" he said. This time we ran into a barrier, and only just  escaped being shot by the Belgian sentry.    \"Back into the town--and tout droit,\" were his directions. We got  back. There seemed no difficulty about _that_. We hammered in vain  at a door. Judging by the noise, we succeeded in arousing every dog  in the neighbourhood, but not a human being came to our rescue. More  wild spurts! Yet it was not until some two hours later that we found  ourselves on a broad road, which proved to be the right one. But our  troubles were not at an end even then, for the driver, by this time,  was in such a state of exasperation that he vowed nothing in the world  would persuade him to go farther than Calais. \"It's like driving in  the sea!\" he grumbled, as in truth it was, for the mud was literally  flowing over the floor of the car, and our condition was indescribable.    Eventually, by means of much persuasion, not untinged by bribery,  he was prevailed upon to finish the journey, throughout which he  maintained for the most part a surly silence, interpolated only by  semi-audible remarks about the folly of English people who _would_  travel in all weathers.      _December 13th._ It is now necessary for every worker in the hospitals  to have a permit. It is time, too, for many are the rumours of spies  who have crept in and gleaned valuable information from the wounded.    A word about the position of volunteer workers. There is no denying  that in the early days, before the staff of the Army hospitals was up  to the full strength required by the extraordinary demands of modern  warfare, they did an immense amount of good. But a plea must be put in  for the central organisation, which has been effected so wonderfully by  those in charge.    One by one the hospitals run by well-meaning but little experienced  women are vanishing or coming under War Office control. One by one  free-lance workers brought to the scene of action by"]]]
