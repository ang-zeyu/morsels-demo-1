They are obliged to pray three times8 a day; the first,  half an hour or less before sunrise, ordering it so that they may, just as the  sun rises, finish eight adorations, each containing three prostrations;9 the  second prayer they end at noon, when the sun begins to decline, in saying  which they perform five such adorations as the former: and in the same they do  the third time, ending just as the sun sets.  They fast three times a year,  the first time thirty days, the next nine days, and the last seven.  They  offer many sacrifices, but eat no part of them, burning them all.  They  abstain from beans, garlic, and some other pulse and vegetables.1  As       10  Strabo, l. 16, p. 1076, 1132.  1  Vide Diodor.

They go  on pilgrimage to a place near the city of Harran in Mesopotamia, where great  numbers of them dwell, and they have also a great respect for the temple of  Mecca, and the pyramids of Egypt;4 fancying these last to be the sepulchres of  Seth, and of Enoch and Sabi his two sons, whom they look on as the first  propagators of their religion; at these structures they sacrifice a cock and a  black calf, and offer up incense.5  Besides the book of Psalms, the only true  scripture they read, they have other books which they esteem equally sacred,  particularly one in the Chaldee tongue which they call the book of Seth, and  is full of moral discourses.  This sect say they took the name of Sabians from  the above-mentioned Sabi, though it seems rather to be derived from Saba,6 or  the host of heaven, which they worship.7  Travellers commonly call them  Christians of St. John the Baptist, whose disciples also they pretend to be,  using a kind of baptism, which is the greatest mark they bear of Christianity.  This is one of the religions, the practice of which Mohammed tolerated (on  paying tribute), and the professors of it are often included in that  expression of the Korân, \"those to whom the scriptures have been given,\" or  literally, the people of the book.     The idolatry of the Arabs then, as Sabians, chiefly consisted in  worshipping the fixed stars and planets, and the angels and their images,  which they honoured as inferior deities, and whose intercession they begged,  as their mediators with GOD.  For the Arabs acknowledged one supreme GOD, the  Creator and LORD of the universe, whom they called Allah Taâla, the most high  GOD; and their other deities, who were subordinate to him, they called simply  al Ilahât, i.e., the goddesses; which words the Grecians not understanding,  and it being their constant custom to resolve the religion of every other  nation into their own, and find out gods of their to match the others', they  pretend that the Arabs worshipped only two deities, Orotalt and Alilat, as  those names are corruptly written, whom they will have to be the same with  Bacchus and Urania; pitching on the former as one of the greatest of their own  gods, and educated in Arabia, and on the other, because of the veneration  shown by the Arabs to the stars.1     That they acknowledged one supreme GOD, appears, to omit other proof, from  their usual form of addressing themselves to him, which was this, \"I dedicate  myself to thy service, O GOD!  Thou hast no companion, except thy companion of  whom thou art absolute master, and of whatever is his.\"2  So that they  supposed the idols not to be sui juris, though they offered sacrifices and  other offerings to them, as well as to GOD, who was also often put off with  the least portion, as Mohammed upbraids them.  Thus when they planted fruit  trees, or sowed a field, they divided it by a line into two parts, setting one  apart       2  Idem ibid.  3  Hyde ubi supr. p. 124, &c.  4  D'Herbel. ubi  supr. 5  See Greaves' Pyramidogr. p. 6, 7.  6  Vide Poc. Spec. p.  138.  7  Thabet Ebn Korrah, a famous astronomer, and himself a Sabian,  wrote a treatise in Syriac concerning the doctrines, rites, and ceremonies of  this sect; from which, if it could be recovered, we might expect much better  information than any taken from the Arabian writers; vide Abulfarag, ubi sup.   1  Vide Herodot. 1. 3, c. 8; Arrian, p. 161, 162, and Strab. l. 16.   2  Al Shahrestani.            for their idols, and the other for GOD; if any of the fruits happened to fall  from the idol's part into GOD'S, they made restitution; but if from GOD'S part  into the idol's, they made no restitution.  So when they watered the idol's  grounds, if the water broke over the channels made for that purpose, and ran  on GOD'S part, they damned it up again; but if the contrary, they let it run  on, saying, they wanted what was GOD'S, but he wanted nothing.3  In the same  manner, if the offering designed for GOD happened to be better than that  designed for the idol, they made an exchange, but not otherwise.4     It was from this gross idolatry, or the worship of inferior deities, or  companions of GOD, as the Arabs continue to call them, that Mohammed reclaimed  his countrymen, establishing the sole worship of the true GOD among them; so  that how much soever the Mohammedans are to blame in other points, they are  far from being idolaters, as some ignorant writers have pretended.     The worship of the stars the Arabs might easily be led into, from their  observing the changes of weather to happen at the rising and setting of  certain of them,5 which after a long course of experience induced them to  ascribe a divine power to those stars, and to think themselves indebted to  them for their rains, a very great benefit and refreshment to their parched  country: this superstition the Korân particularly takes notice of.1     The ancient Arabians and Indians, between which two nations was a great  conformity of religions, had seven celebrated temples, dedicated to the seven  planets; one of which in particular, called Beit Ghomdân, was built in Sanaa,  the metropolis of Yaman, by Dahac, to the honour of al Zoharah or the planet  Venus, and was demolished by the Khalîf Othman;2 by whose murder was fulfilled  the prophetical inscription set, as is reported, over this temple, viz.,  \"Ghomdân, he who destroyeth thee shall be slain.3  The temple of Mecca is also  said to have been consecrated to Zohal, or Saturn.4     Though these deities were generally reverenced by the whole nation, yet  each tribe chose some one as the more peculiar object of their worship.     Thus as to the stars and planets, the tribe of Hamyar chiefly worshipped  the sun; Misam,5 al Debarân, or the Bull's-eye; Lakhm and Jodâm, al Moshtari,  or Jupiter; Tay, Sohail, or Canopus; Kais, Sirius, or the Dog-star; and Asad,  Otâred, or Mercury.6  Among the worshippers of Sirius, one Abu Cabsha was very  famous; some will have him to be the same with Waheb, Mohammed's grandfather  by the mother, but others say he was of the tribe of Khozâah.  This man used  his utmost endeavours to persuade the Koreish to leave their images and  worship this star; for which reason Mohammed, who endeavoured also to make  them leave their images, was by them nicknamed the son of Abu Cabsha.7  The  worship of this star is particularly hinted at in the Korân.8     Of the angels or intelligences which they worshipped, the Korân,9 makes  mention only of three, which were worshipped under female names;10  Allat, al  Uzza, and Manah.  These were by them called       3  Nodhm al dorr.  4  Al Beidâwi.  5  Vide Post. 1  Vide Poc.

Allât was the idol of the tribe of Thakîf who dwelt at Tayef, and had a  temple consecrated to her in a place called Nakhlah.  This idol al Mogheirah  destroyed by Mohammed's order, who sent him and Abu Sofiân on that commission  in the ninth year of the Hejra.1  The inhabitants of Tayef, especially the  women, bitterly lamented the loss of this their deity, which they were so fond  of, that they begged of Mohammed as a condition of peace, that it might not be  destroyed for three years, and not obtaining that, asked only a month's  respite; but he absolutely denied it.2  There are several derivations of this  word which the curious may learn from Dr. Pocock:3 it seems most probably to  be derived from the same root with Allah, to which it may be a feminine, and  will then signify the goddess.     Al Uzza, as some affirm, was the idol of the tribes of Koreish and  Kenânah,4 and part of the tribe of Salim:5 others6 tell us it was a tree called  the Egyptian thorn, or acacia, worshipped by the tribe of Ghatfân, first  consecrated by one Dhâlem, who built a chapel over it, called Boss, so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7446"],[0,"The Naturalist in La Plata (#10)"],[1,"ica.    Clavigero has nothing to say concerning the origin of this Californian  superstition; but with some knowledge of the puma's character, it is not  difficult to imagine what it may have been. No doubt these savages had  been very well acquainted from ancient times with the animal's instinct  of friendliness toward man, and its extreme hatred of other carnivores,  which prey on the human species; and finding it ranged on their side, as  it were, in the hard struggle of life in the desert, they were induced  to spare it, and even to regard it as a friend; and such a feeling,  among primitive men, might in the course of time degenerate into such a  superstition as that of the Californians.    I shall, in conclusion, relate here the story of Maldonada, which is not  generally known, although familiar to Buenos Ayreans as the story of  Lady Godiva's ride through Coventry is to the people of that town. The  case of Maldonada is circumstantially narrated by Rui Diaz de Guzman, in  his history of the colonization of the Plata: he was a person high in  authority in the young colonies, and is regarded by students of South  American history as an accurate and sober-minded chronicler of the  events of his own times. He relates that in the year 1536 the settlers  at Buenos Ayres, having exhausted their provisions, and being compelled  by hostile Indians to keep within their pallisades, were reduced to the  verge of starvation. The Governor Mendoza went off to seek help from the  other colonies up the river, deputing his authority to one Captain Ruiz,  who, according to all accounts, displayed an excessively tyrannous and  truculent disposition while in power. The people were finally reduced to  a ration of sis ounces of flour per day for each person; but as the  flour was putrid and only made them ill, they were forced to live on any  small animals they could capture, including snakes, frogs and toads.  Some horrible details are given by Rui Diaz, and other writers; one, Del  Barco Centenera, affirms that of two thousand persons in the town  eighteen hundred perished of hunger. During this unhappy time, beasts of  prey in large numbers were attracted to the settlement by the effluvium  of the corpses, buried just outside the pallisades; and this made the  condition of the survivors more miserable still, since they could  venture into the neighbouring woods only at the risk of a violent death.  Nevertheless, many did so venture, and among these was the young woman  Maldonada, who, losing herself in the forest, strayed to a distance, and  was eventually found by a party of Indians, and carried by them to their  village.    Some months later, Captain Ruiz discovered her whereabouts, and  persuaded the savages to bring her to the settlement; then, accusing her  of having gone to the Indian village in order to betray the colony, he  condemned her to be devoured by wild beasts. She was taken to a wood at  a distance of a league from the town, and left there, tied to a tree,  for the space of two nights and a day. A party of soldiers then went to  the spot, expecting to find her bones picked clean by the beasts, but  were greatly astonished to find Maldonada still alive, without hurt or  scratch. She told them that a puma had come to her aid, and had kept at  her side, defending her life against all the other beasts that  approached her. She was instantly released, and taken back to the town,  her deliverance through the action of the puma probably being looked on  as direct interposition of Providence to save her.    Rui Diaz concludes with the following paragraph, in which he affirms  that he knew the woman Maldonada, which may be taken as proof that she  was among the few that survived the first disastrous settlement and  lived on to more fortunate times: his pious pun on her name would be  lost in a translation:--\"De esta manera quedo libre la que ofrecieron a  las fieras: la cual mujer yo la conoci, y la llamaban la Maldonada, que  mas bien se le podia llamar la BIENDONADA; pues por este suceso se ha de  ver no haber merecido el castigo a que la ofrecieron.\"    If such a thing were to happen now, in any portion of southern South  America, where the puma's disposition is best known, it would not be  looked on as a miracle, as it was, and that unavoidably, in the case of  Maldonada.          CHAPTER III.    A WAVE OF LIFE,      For many years, while living in my own home on the pampas, I kept a  journal, in which all my daily observations on the habits of animals and  kindred matters were carefully noted. Turning back to 1872-3, I find my  jottings for that season contain a history of one of those waves of  life--for I can think of no better name for the phenomenon in  question--that are of such frequent occurrence in thinly-settled  regions, though in countries like England, seen very rarely, and on a  very limited scale. An exceptionally bounteous season, the accidental  mitigation of a check, or other favourable circumstance, often causes an  increase so sudden and inordinate of small prolific species, that when  we actually witness it we are no longer surprised at the notion  prevalent amongst the common people that mice, frogs, crickets, &c., are  occasionally rained down from the clouds.    In the summer of 1872-3 we had plenty of sunshine, with frequent  showers; so that the hot months brought no dearth of wild flowers, as in  most years. The abundance of flowers resulted in a wonderful increase of  humble bees. I have never known them so plentiful before; in and about  the plantation adjoining my house I found, during the season, no fewer  than seventeen nests.    The season was also favourable for mice; that is, of course, favourable  for the time being, unfavourable in the long run, since the short-lived,  undue preponderance of a species is invariably followed by a long period  of undue depression. These prolific little creatures were soon so  abundant that the dogs subsisted almost exclusively on them; the fowls  also, from incessantly pursuing and killing them, became quite rapacious  in their manner; whilst the sulphur tyrant-birds (Pitangus) and the  Guira cuckoos preyed on nothing but mice.    The domestic cats, as they invariably do in such plentiful seasons,  absented themselves from the house, assuming all the habits of their  wild congeners, and slinking from the sight of man--even of a former  fireside companion--with a shy secrecy in their motions, an apparent  affectation of fear, almost ludicrous to see. Foxes, weasels, and  opossums fared sumptuously. Even for the common armadillo (Dasypus  villosus) it was a season of affluence, for this creature is very adroit  in capturing mice. This fact might seem surprising to anyone who marks  the uncouth figure, toothless gums, and the motions--anything but light  and graceful--of the armadillo and perhaps fancying that, to be a  dexterous mouser, an animal should bear some resemblance in habits and  structure to the felidas. But animals, like men, are compelled to adapt  themselves to their surroundings; new habits are acquired, and the exact  co-relation between habit and structure is seldom maintained.    I kept an armadillo at this time, and good cheer and the sedentary life  he led in captivity made him excessively fat; but the mousing exploits  of even this individual were most interesting. Occasionally I took him  into the fields to give him a taste of liberty, though at such times I  always took the precaution to keep hold of a cord fastened to one of his  hind legs; for as often as he came to a kennel of one of his wild  fellows, he would attempt to escape into it. He invariably travelled  with an ungainly trotting gait, carrying his nose, beagle-like, close to  the ground. His sense of smell was exceedingly acute, and when near his  prey he became agitated, and quickened his motions, pausing frequently  to sniff the earth, till, discovering the exact spot where the mouse  lurked, he would stop and creep cautiously to it; then, after slowly  raising himself to a sitting posture, spring suddenly forwards, throwing  his body like a trap over the mouse, or nest of mice, concealed beneath  the grass.    A curious instance of intelligence in a cat was brought to my notice at  this time by one of my neighbours, a native. His children had made the  discovery that some excitement and fun was to be had by placing a long  hollow stalk of the giant thistle with a mouse in it--and every hollow  stalk at this time had one for a tenant--before a cat, and then watching  her movements. Smelling her prey, she would spring at one end of the  stalk--the end towards which the mouse would be moving at the same time,  but would catch nothing, for the mouse, instead of running out, would  turn back to run to the other end; whereupon the cat, all excitement,  would jump there to seize it; and so the contest would continue for a  long time, an exhibition of the cleverness and the stupidity of  instinct, both of the pursuer and the pursued. There were several cats  at the house, and all acted in the same way except one. When a stalk was  placed before this cat, instead of becoming excited like the others, it  went quickly to one end and smelt' at the opening, then, satisfied that  its prey was inside, it deliberately bit a long piece out of the stalk  with its teeth, then another strip, and so on progressively, until the  entire stick had been opened up to within six or eight inches of the  further end, when the mouse came out and was caught. Every stalk placed  before this cat was demolished in the same businesslike way; but the  other cats, though they were made to look on while the stick was being  broken up by their fellow, could never learn the trick.    In the autumn of the year countless numbers of storks (Ciconia maguari)  and of short-eared owls (Otus brachyotus) made their appearance. They  had also come to assist at the general feast.
