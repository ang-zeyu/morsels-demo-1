This is something very different from a blaze of light. A star of the  fifth magnitude is scarcely more than plainly visible to ordinary  vision. The area of the whole sky is, in round numbers, about 50,000  times that of the circle we have described. It follows that the total  quantity of light which we receive from all the stars is about equal to  that of 50,000 stars of the fifth magnitude--somewhat more than 1000 of  the first magnitude. This whole amount of light would have to be  multiplied by 90,000,000 to make a light equal to that of the sun. It  is, therefore, not at all necessary to consider how far the system must  extend in order that the heavens should blaze like the sun. Adopting  Lord Kelvin's hypothesis, we shall find that, in order that we may  receive from the stars the amount of light we have designated, this  system need not extend beyond some 5000 light-years. But this  hypothesis probably overestimates the thickness of the stars in space.  It does not seem probable that there are as many as 1,000,000,000 stars  within the sphere of 3300 light-years. Nor is it at all certain that  the light of the average star is equal to that of the sun. It is  impossible, in the present state of our knowledge, to assign any  definite value to this average. To do so is a problem similar to that  of assigning an average weight to each component of the animal  creation, from the microscopic insects which destroy our plants up to  the elephant. What we can say with a fair approximation to confidence  is that, if we could fly out in any direction to a distance of 20,000,  perhaps even of 10,000, light-years, we should find that we had left a  large fraction of our system behind us. We should see its boundary in  the direction in which we had travelled much more certainly than we see  it from our stand-point.    We should not dismiss this branch of the subject without saying that  considerations are frequently adduced by eminent authorities which tend  to impair our confidence in almost any conclusion as to the limits of  the stellar system. The main argument is based on the possibility that  light is extinguished in its passage through space; that beyond a  certain distance we cannot see a star, however bright, because its  light is entirely lost before reaching us. That there could be any loss  of light in passing through an absolute vacuum of any extent cannot be  admitted by the physicist of to-day without impairing what he considers  the fundamental principles of the vibration of light. But the  possibility that the celestial spaces are pervaded by matter which  might obstruct the passage of light is to be considered. We know that  minute meteoric particles are flying through our system in such numbers  that the earth encounters several millions of them every day, which  appear to us in the familiar phenomena of shooting-stars. If such  particles are scattered through all space, they must ultimately  obstruct the passage of light. We know little of the size of these  bodies, but, from the amount of energy contained in their light as they  are consumed in the passage through our atmosphere, it does not seem at  all likely that they are larger than grains of sand or, perhaps, minute  pebbles. They are probably vastly more numerous in the vicinity of the  sun than in the interstellar spaces, since they would naturally tend to  be collected by the sun's attraction. In fact there are some reasons  for believing that most of these bodies are the debris of comets; and  the latter are now known to belong to the solar system, and not to the  universe at large.    But whatever view we take of these possibilities, they cannot  invalidate our conclusion as to the general structure of the stellar  system as we know it. Were meteors so numerous as to cut off a large  fraction of the light from the more distant stars, we should see no  Milky Way, but the apparent thickness of the stars in every direction  would be nearly the same. The fact that so many more of these objects  are seen around the galactic belt than in the direction of its poles  shows that, whatever extinction light may suffer in going through the  greatest distances, we see nearly all that comes from stars not more  distant than the Milky Way itself.    Intimately connected with the subject we have discussed is the question  of the age of our system, if age it can be said to have. In considering  this question, the simplest hypothesis to suggest itself is that the  universe has existed forever in some such form as we now see it; that  it is a self-sustaining system, able to go on forever with only such  cycles of transformation as may repeat themselves indefinitely, and  may, therefore, have repeated themselves indefinitely in the past.  Ordinary observation does not make anything known to us which would  seem to invalidate this hypothesis. In looking upon the operations of  the universe, we may liken ourselves to a visitor to the earth from  another sphere who has to draw conclusions about the life of an  individual man from observations extending through a few days. During  that time, he would see no reason why the life of the man should have  either a beginning or an end. He sees a daily round of change, activity  and rest, nutrition and waste; but, at the end of the round, the  individual is seemingly restored to his state of the day before. Why  may not this round have been going on forever, and continue in the  future without end? It would take a profounder course of observation  and a longer time to show that, notwithstanding this seeming  restoration, an imperceptible residual of vital energy, necessary to  the continuance of life, has not been restored, and that the loss of  this residuum day by day must finally result in death.    The case is much the same with the great bodies of the universe.  Although, to superficial observation, it might seem that they could  radiate their light forever, the modern generalizations of physics show  that such cannot be the case. The radiation of light necessarily  involves a corresponding loss of heat and with it the expenditure of  some form of energy. The amount of energy within any body is  necessarily limited. The supply must be exhausted unless the energy of  the light sent out into infinite space is, in some way, restored to the  body which expended it. The possibility of such a restoration  completely transcends our science. How can the little vibration which  strikes our eye from some distant star, and which has been perhaps  thousands of years in reaching us, find its way back to its origin? The  light emitted by the sun 10,000 years ago is to-day pursuing its way in  a sphere whose surface is 10,000 light-years distant on all sides.  Science has nothing even to suggest the possibility of its restoration,  and the most delicate observations fail to show any return from the  unfathomable abyss.    Up to the time when radium was discovered, the most careful  investigations of all conceivable sources of supply had shown only one  which could possibly be of long duration. This is the contraction which  is produced in the great incandescent bodies of the universe by the  loss of the heat which they radiate. As remarked in the preceding  essay, the energy generated by the sun's contraction could not have  kept up its present supply of heat for much more than twenty or thirty  millions of years, while the study of earth and ocean shows evidence of  the action of a series of causes which must have been going on for  hundreds of millions of years.    The antagonism between the two conclusions is even more marked than  would appear from this statement. The period of the sun's heat set by  the astronomical physicist is that during which our luminary could  possibly have existed in its present form. The period set by the  geologist is not merely that of the sun's existence, but that during  which the causes effecting geological changes have not undergone any  complete revolution. If, at any time, the sun radiated much less than  its present amount of heat, no water could have existed on the earth's  surface except in the form of ice; there would have been scarcely any  evaporation, and the geological changes due to erosion could not have  taken place. Moreover, the commencement of the geological operations of  which we speak is by no means the commencement of the earth's  existence. The theories of both parties agree that, for untold aeons  before the geological changes now visible commenced, our planet was a  molten mass, perhaps even an incandescent globe like the sun. During  all those aeons the sun must have been in existence as a vast nebulous  mass, first reaching as far as the earth's orbit, and slowly  contracting its dimensions. And these aeons are to be included in any  estimate of the age of the sun.    The doctrine of cosmic evolution--the theory which in former times was  generally known as the nebular hypothesis--that the heavenly bodies  were formed by the slow contraction of heated nebulous masses, is  indicated by so many facts that it seems scarcely possible to doubt it  except on the theory that the laws of nature were, at some former time,  different from those which we now see in operation. Granting the  evolutionary hypothesis, every star has its lifetime. We can even lay  down the law by which it passes from infancy to old age. All stars do  not have the same length of life; the rule is that the larger the star,  or the greater the mass of matter which composes it, the longer will it  endure. Up to the present time, science can do nothing more than point  out these indications of a beginning, and their inevitable consequence,  that there is to be an end to the light and heat of every heavenly  body. But no cautious"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4069"],[0,"The Dawn of Canadian History : A Chronicle of Aboriginal Canada (#10)"],[1," had sailed only by 'dead reckoning'; this  means that if their ship was going at such and such a speed, it was  supposed to have made such and such a distance in a given time. But  when ships were being driven to and fro, and buffeted by adverse winds,  this reckoning became extremely uncertain.    John Cabot and his men mere tossed about considerably in their little  ship. Though they seem to have set out early in May of 1497, it was not  until June 24 that they sighted land. What the land was like, and what  they thought of it, we know from letters written in England by various  persons after their return. Thus we learn that it was a 'very good and  temperate country,' and that 'Brazil wood and silks grow there.' 'The  sea,' they reported, 'is covered with fishes, which are caught not only  with the net, but with baskets, a stone being tied to them in order  that the baskets may sink in the water.' Henceforth, it was said,  England would have no more need to buy fish from Iceland, for the  waters of the new land abounded in fish. Cabot and his men saw no  savages, but they found proof that the land was inhabited. Here and  there in the forest they saw trees which had been felled, and also  snares of a rude kind set to catch game. They were enthusiastic over  their success. They reported that the new land must certainly be  connected with Cipango, from which all the spices and precious stones  of the world originated. Only a scanty stock of provisions, they  declared, prevented them from sailing along the coast as far as Cathay  and Cipango. As it was they planted on the land a great cross with the  flag of England and also the banner of St Mark, the patron saint of  Cabot's city of Venice.    The older histories used always to speak as if John Cabot had landed  somewhere on the coast of Labrador, and had at best gone no farther  south than Newfoundland. Even if this were the whole truth about the  voyage, to Cabot and his men would belong the signal honour of having  been the first Europeans, since the Norsemen, to set foot on the  mainland of North America. Without doubt they were the first to unfurl  the flag of England, and to erect the cross upon soil which afterwards  became part of British North America. But this is not all. It is likely  that Cabot reached a point far south of Labrador. His supposed sailing  westward carried him in reality south of the latitude of Ireland. He  makes no mention of the icebergs which any voyager must meet on the  Labrador coast from June to August. His account of a temperate climate  suitable for growing dye-wood, of forest trees, and of a country so  fair that it seemed the gateway of the enchanted lands of the East, is  quite unsuited to the bare and forbidding aspect of Labrador. Cape  Breton island was probably the place of Cabot's landing. Its balmy  summer climate, the abundant fish of its waters, fit in with Cabot's  experiences. The evidence from maps, one of which was made by Cabot's  son Sebastian, points also to Cape Breton as the first landing-place of  English sailors in America.    There is no doubt of the stir made by Cabot's discovery on his safe  return to England. He was in London by August of 1497, and he became at  once the object of eager curiosity and interest. 'He is styled the  Great Admiral,' wrote a Venetian resident in London, 'and vast honour  is paid to him. He dresses in silk, and the English run after him like  mad people.' The sunlight of royal favour broke over him in a flood:  even Henry VII proved generous. The royal accounts show that, on August  10, 1497, the king gave ten pounds 'to him that found the new isle.' A  few months later the king granted to his 'well-beloved John Cabot, of  the parts of Venice, an annuity of twenty pounds sterling,' to be paid  out of the customs of the port of Bristol. The king, too, was lavish in  his promises of help for a new expedition. Henry's imagination had  evidently been fired with the idea of an Oriental empire. A  contemporary writer tells us that Cabot was to have ten armed ships. At  Cabot's request, the king conceded to him all the prisoners needed to  man this fleet, saving only persons condemned for high treason. It is  one of the ironies of history that on the first pages of its annals the  beautiful new world is offered to the criminals of Europe.    During the winter that followed, John Cabot was the hero of the hour.  Busy preparations went on for a new voyage. Letters patent were issued  giving Cabot power to take any six ships that he liked from the ports  of the kingdom, paying to their owners the same price only as if taken  for the king's service. The 'Grand Admiral' became a person of high  importance. On one friend he conferred the sovereignty of an island; to  others he made lavish promises; certain poor friars who offered to  embark on his coming voyage were to be bishops over the heathen of the  new land. Even the merchants of London ventured to send out goods for  trade, and brought to Cabot 'coarse cloth, caps, laces, points, and  other trifles.'    The second expedition sailed from the port of Bristol in May of 1498.  John Cabot and his son Sebastian were in command; of the younger  brothers we hear no more. But the high hopes of the voyagers were  doomed to disappointment. On arriving at the coast of America Cabot's  ships seem first to have turned towards the north. The fatal idea, that  the empires of Asia might be reached through the northern seas already  asserted its sway. The search for a north-west passage, that  will-o'-the-wisp of three centuries, had already begun. Many years  later Sebastian Cabot related to a friend at Seville some details  regarding this unfortunate attempt of his father to reach the spice  islands of the East. The fleet, he said, with its three hundred men,  first directed its course so far to the north that, even in the month  of July, monstrous heaps of ice were found floating on the sea. 'There  was,' so Sebastian told his friend, 'in a manner, continual daylight.'  The forbidding aspect of the coast, the bitter cold of the northern  seas, and the boundless extent of the silent drifting ice, chilled the  hopes of the explorers. They turned towards the south. Day after day,  week after week, they skirted the coast of North America. If we may  believe Sebastian's friend, they reached a point as far south as  Gibraltar in Europe. No more was there ice. The cold of Labrador  changed to soft breezes from the sanded coast of Carolina and from the  mild waters of the Gulf Stream. But of the fabled empires of Cathay and  Cipango, and the 'towns and castles' over which the Great Admiral was  to have dominion, they saw no trace. Reluctantly the expedition turned  again towards Europe, and with its turning ends our knowledge of what  happened on the voyage.    That the ships came home either as a fleet, or at least in part, we  have certain proof. We know that John Cabot returned to Bristol, for  the ancient accounts of the port show that he lived to draw at least  one or two instalments of his pension. But the sunlight of royal favour  no longer illumined his path. In the annals of English history the name  of John Cabot is never found again.    The son Sebastian survived to continue a life of maritime adventure, to  be counted one of the great sea-captains of the day, and to enjoy an  honourable old age. In the year 1512 we hear of him in the service of  Ferdinand of Spain. He seems to have won great renown as a maker of  maps and charts. He still cherished the idea of reaching Asia by way of  the northern seas of America. A north-west expedition with Sebastian in  command had been decided upon, it is said, by Ferdinand, when the death  of that illustrious sovereign prevented the realization of the project.  After Ferdinand's death, Cabot fell out with the grandees of the  Spanish court, left Madrid, and returned for some time to England. Some  have it that he made a new voyage in the service of Henry VIII, and  sailed through Hudson Strait, but this is probably only a confused  reminiscence, handed down by hearsay, of the earlier voyages. Cabot  served Spain again under Charles V, and made a voyage to Brazil and the  La Plata river. He reappears later in England, and was made Inspector  of the King's Ships by Edward VI. He was a leading spirit of the  Merchant Adventurers who, in Edward's reign, first opened up trade by  sea with Russia.    The voyages of the Bristol traders and the enterprise of England by no  means ended with the exploits of the Cabots. Though our ordinary  history books tell us nothing more of English voyages until we come to  the days of the great Elizabethan navigators, Drake, Frobisher,  Hawkins, and to the planting of Virginia, as a matter of fact many  voyages were made under Henry VII and Henry VIII. Both sovereigns seem  to have been anxious to continue the exploration of the western seas,  but they had not the good fortune again to secure such master-pilots as  John and Sebastian Cabot.    In the first place, it seems that the fishermen of England, as well as  those of the Breton coast, followed close in the track of the Cabots.  As soon as the Atlantic passage to Newfoundland had been robbed of the  terrors of the unknown, it was not regarded as difficult. With strong  east winds a ship of the sixteenth century could make the run from  Bristol or St Malo to the Grand Banks in less than twenty days. Once a  ship was on the Banks, the fish were found in an abundance utterly  unknown in European waters, and the ships usually returned home with  great cargoes. During the early years of the sixteenth century English,  French, and Portuguese fishermen went from Europe to the Banks in great  numbers. They landed at various points in Newfoundland and Cape Breton,  and became well acquainted with the outline of the coast. It was no  surprise to Jacques Cartier, for instance, on his first voyage, to find  a French fishing"]]]
