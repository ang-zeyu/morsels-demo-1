Should it be found too insignificant for cutting up, I shall no less  remain, Dear sir, Your most obedient servant, R. B.    I have forgotten the main thing--which is to beg you not to spoil  a loophole I have kept for backing out of the thing if necessary,  'sympathy of dear friends,' &c. &c., none of whom know anything about  it.    Monday Morning; Rev.--Fox.      The answer was clearly encouraging, and Mr. Browning wrote again:      Dear Sir,--In consequence of your kind permission I send, or will send,  a dozen copies of 'Pauline' and (to mitigate the infliction) Shelley's  Poem--on account of what you mentioned this morning. It will perhaps  be as well that you let me know their safe arrival by a line to R. B.  junior, Hanover Cottage, Southampton Street, Camberwell. You must not  think me too encroaching, if I make the getting back 'Rosalind and  Helen' an excuse for calling on you some evening--the said 'R. and  H.' has, I observe, been well thumbed and sedulously marked by an  acquaintance of mine, but I have not time to rub out his labour of love.  I am, dear sir, Yours very really, R. Browning. Camberwell: 2 o'clock.      At the left-hand corner of the first page of this note is written: 'The  parcel--a \"Pauline\" parcel--is come. I send one as a witness.'    On the inner page is written:    'Impromptu on hearing a sermon by the Rev. T. R.--pronounced \"heavy\"--    'A _heavy_ sermon!--sure the error's great, For not a word Tom uttered  _had its weight_.'    A third letter, also undated, but post-marked March 29, 1833, refers  probably to the promise or announcement of a favourable notice. A fourth  conveys Mr. Browning's thanks for the notice itself:      My dear Sir,--I have just received your letter, which I am desirous of  acknowledging before any further mark of your kindness reaches me;--I  can only offer you my simple thanks--but they are of the sort that one  can give only once or twice in a life: all things considered, I think  you are almost repaid, if you imagine what I must feel--and it will have  been worth while to have made a fool of myself, only to have obtained a  'case' which leaves my fine fellow Mandeville at a dead lock.    As for the book--I hope ere long to better it, and to deserve your  goodness.    In the meantime I shall not forget the extent to which I am, dear sir,  Your most obliged and obedient servant R. B. S. & O.'s, Conduit St.,  Thursday m-g.        I must intrude on your attention, my dear sir, once more than I had  intended--but a notice like the one I have read will have its effect at  all hazards.    I can only say that I am very proud to feel as grateful as I do, and  not altogether hopeless of justifying, by effort at least, your most  generous 'coming forward'. Hazlitt wrote his essays, as he somewhere  tells us, mainly to send them to some one in the country who had 'always  prophesied he would be something'!--I shall never write a line without  thinking of the source of my first praise, be assured. I am, dear sir,  Yours most truly and obliged, Robert Browning. March 31, 1833.      Mr. Fox was then editor of a periodical called the 'Monthly Repository',  which, as his daughter, Mrs. Bridell-Fox, writes in her graceful  article on Robert Browning, in the 'Argosy' for February 1890, he was  endeavouring to raise from its original denominational character into  a first-class literary and political journal. The articles comprised in  the volume for 1833 are certainly full of interest and variety, at once  more popular and more solid than those prescribed by the present fashion  of monthly magazines. He reviewed 'Pauline' favourably in its April  number--that is, as soon as it had appeared; and the young poet thus  received from him an introduction to what should have been, though it  probably was not, a large circle of intelligent readers.    The poem was characterized by its author, five years later, in a  fantastic note appended to a copy of it, as 'the only remaining crab  of the shapely Tree of Life in my Fool's Paradise.' This name is ill  bestowed upon a work which, however wild a fruit of Mr. Browning's  genius, contains, in its many lines of exquisite fancy and deep pathos,  so much that is rich and sweet. It had also, to discard metaphor,  its faults of exaggeration and confusion; and it is of these that Mr.  Browning was probably thinking when he wrote his more serious apologetic  preface to its reprint in 1868. But these faults were partly due to his  conception of the character which he had tried to depict; and partly to  the inherent difficulty of depicting one so complex, in a succession  of mental and moral states, irrespectively of the conditions of time,  place, and circumstance which were involved in them. Only a very  powerful imagination could have inspired such an attempt. A still more  conspicuous effort of creative genius reveals itself at its close. The  moment chosen for the 'Confession' has been that of a supreme moral or  physical crisis. The exhaustion attendant on this is directly expressed  by the person who makes it, and may also be recognized in the vivid, yet  confusing, intensity of the reminiscences of which it consists. But  we are left in complete doubt as to whether the crisis is that of  approaching death or incipient convalescence, or which character it  bears in the sufferer's mind; and the language used in the closing pages  is such as to suggest, without the slightest break in poetic continuity,  alternately the one conclusion and the other. This was intended by  Browning to assist his anonymity; and when the writer in 'Tait's  Magazine' spoke of the poem as a piece of pure bewilderment, he  expressed the natural judgment of the Philistine, while proving himself  such. If the notice by J. S. Mill, which this criticism excluded, was  indeed--as Mr. Browning always believed--much more sympathetic, I can  only record my astonishment; for there never was a large and cultivated  intelligence one can imagine less in harmony than his with the poetic  excesses, or even the poetic qualities, of 'Pauline'. But this is a  digression.    Mr. Fox, though an accomplished critic, made very light of the artistic  blemishes of the work. His admiration for it was as generous as it was  genuine; and, having recognized in it the hand of a rising poet, it was  more congenial to him to hail that poet's advent than to register his  shortcomings.      'The poem,' he says, 'though evidently a hasty and imperfect sketch, has  truth and life in it, which gave us the thrill, and laid hold of us with  the power, the sensation of which has never yet failed us as a test of  genius.'      But it had also, in his mind, a distinguishing characteristic, which  raised it above the sphere of merely artistic criticism. The article  continues:      'We have never read anything more purely confessional. The whole  composition is of the spirit, spiritual. The scenery is in the chambers  of thought; the agencies are powers and passions; the events are  transitions from one state of spiritual existence to another.'      And we learn from the context that he accepted this confessional and  introspective quality as an expression of the highest emotional life--of  the essence, therefore, of religion. On this point the sincerest  admirers of the poem may find themselves at issue with Mr. Fox. Its  sentiment is warmly religious; it is always, in a certain sense,  spiritual; but its intellectual activities are exercised on entirely  temporal ground, and this fact would generally be admitted as the  negation of spirituality in the religious sense of the word. No  difference, however, of opinion as to his judgment of 'Pauline' can  lessen our appreciation of Mr. Fox's encouraging kindness to its author.  No one who loved Mr. Browning in himself, or in his work, can read the  last lines of this review without a throb of affectionate gratitude  for the sympathy so ungrudgingly, and--as he wrote during his latest  years--so opportunely given:      'In recognizing a poet we cannot stand upon trifles nor fret ourselves  about such matters [as a few blemishes]. Time enough for that  afterwards, when larger works come before us. Archimedes in the bath had  many particulars to settle about specific gravities and Hiero's crown,  but he first gave a glorious leap and shouted 'Eureka!''      Many persons have discovered Mr. Browning since he has been known to  fame. One only discovered him in his obscurity.    Next to that of Mr. Fox stands the name of John Forster among the first  spontaneous appreciators of Mr. Browning's genius; and his admiration  was, in its own way, the more valuable for the circumstances which  precluded in it all possible, even unconscious, bias of personal  interest or sympathy. But this belongs to a somewhat later period of our  history.    I am dwelling at some length on this first experience of Mr. Browning's  literary career, because the confidence which it gave him determined its  immediate future, if not its ultimate course--because, also, the poem  itself is more important to the understanding of his mind than perhaps  any other of his isolated works. It was the earliest of his dramatic  creations; it was therefore inevitably the most instinct with himself;  and we may regard the 'Confession' as to a great extent his own, without  for an instant ignoring the imaginative element which necessarily and  certainly entered into it. At one moment, indeed, his utterance is so  emphatic that we should feel it to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6574"],[0,"Watchers of the Sky (#10)"],[1," account their own.     Yet, when that lanthorn led me     Back to the world where once I thought me wise;   I saw, on this my planet,     What souls, with awful eyes.   Hardly I dared to walk her fields     As in that strange re-birth   I looked on those wild miracles     The birds and flowers of earth.\"    Silence a moment held them, loth to break  The spell of that strange dream,                                   \"One proof the more\"  Said Wotton at last, \"that songs can mount and fly  To truth; for this fantastic vision of yours  Of life in other spheres, awakes in me,  Either that slumbering knowledge of Socrates,  Or some strange premonition that the years  Will prove it true. This music leads us far  From all our creeds, except that faith in law.  Your quest for knowledge--how it rests on that!  How sure the soul is that if truth destroy  The temple, in three days the truth will build  A nobler temple; and that order reigns  In all things. Even your atheist builds his doubt  On that strange faith; destroys his heaven and God  In absolute faith that his own thought is true  To law, God's lanthorn to our stumbling feet;  And so, despite himself, he worships God,  For where true souls are, there are God and heaven.\"--    \"It is an ancient wisdom. Long ago,\"  Said Kepler, \"under the glittering Eastern sky,  The shepherd king looked up at those great stars,  Those ordered hosts, and cried _Caeli narrant  Gloriam Dei!_                   Though there be some to-day  Who'd ape Lucretius, and believe themselves  Epicureans, little they know of him  Who, even in utter darkness, bowed his head,  To something nobler than the gods of Rome  Reigning beyond the darkness.                                They accept  The law, the music of these ordered worlds;  And straight deny the law's first postulate,  That out of nothingness nothing can be born,  Nor greater things from less. Can music rise  By chance from chaos, as they said that star  In Serpentarius rose? I told them, then,  That when I was a boy, with time to spare,  I played at anagrams. Out of my Latin name  _Johannes Keplerus_ came that sinister phrase  _Serpens in akuleo_. Struck by this,  I tried again, but trusted it to chance.  I took some playing cards, and wrote on each  One letter of my name. Then I began  To shuffle them; and, at every shuffle, I read  The letters, in their order, as they came,  To see what meaning chance might give to them.  Wotton, the gods and goddesses must have laughed  To see the weeks I lost in studying chance;  For had I scattered those cards into the black  Epicurean eternity, I'll swear  They'd still be playing at leap-frog in the dark,  And show no glimmer of sense. And yet--to hear  Those wittols talk, you'd think you'd but to mix  A bushel of good Greek letters in a sack  And shake them roundly for an age or so,  To pour the Odyssey out.                           At last, I told,  Those disputants what my wife had said. One night  When I was tired and all my mind a-dust  With pondering on their atoms, I was called  To supper, and she placed before me there  A most delicious salad. 'It would appear,'  I thought aloud, 'that if these pewter dishes,  Green hearts of lettuce, tarragon, slips of thyme,  Slices of hard boiled egg, and grains of salt.  With drops of water, vinegar and oil,  Had in a bottomless gulf been flying about  From all eternity, one sure certain day  The sweet invisible hand of Happy Chance  Would serve them as a salad.'                                'Likely enough,'  My wife replied, 'but not so good as mine,  Nor so well dressed.'\"                         They laughed. Susannah's voice  Broke in, \"I've made a better one. The receipt  Came from the _Golden Lion_. I have dished  Ducklings and peas and all. Come, John, say grace.\"          IV    GALILEO      I      (_Celeste, in the Convent at Arcetri, writes to her old lover at  Rome._)    My friend, my dearest friend, my own dear love,  I, who am dead to love, and see around me  The funeral tapers lighted, send this cry  Out of my heart to yours, before the end.  You told me once you would endure the rack  To save my heart one pang. O, save it now!  Last night there came a dreadful word from Rome  For my dear lord and father, summoning him  Before the inquisitors there, to take his trial  At threescore years and ten. There is a threat  Of torture, if his lips will not deny  The truth his eyes have seen.                                You know my father,  You know me, too. You never will believe  That he and I are enemies of the faith.  Could I, who put away all earthly love,  Deny the Cross to which I nailed this flesh?  Could he, who, on the night when all those heavens  Opened above us, with their circling worlds,  Knelt with me, crushed beneath that weight of glory,  Forget the Maker of that glory now?  You'll not believe it. Neither would the Church,  Had not his enemies poisoned all the springs  And fountain-heads of truth. It is not Rome  That summons him, but Magini, Sizy, Scheiner,  Lorini, all the blind, pedantic crew  That envy him his fame, and hate his works  For dwarfing theirs.                       Must such things always be  When truth is born?  Only five nights ago we walked together,  My father and I, here in the Convent garden;  And, as the dusk turned everything to dreams,  We dreamed together of his work well done  And happiness to be. We did not dream  That even then, muttering above his book,  His enemies, those enemies whom the truth  Stings into hate, were plotting to destroy him.  Yet something shadowed him. I recall his words--  \"The grapes are ripening. See, Celeste, how black  And heavy. We shall have good wine this year,\"--  \"Yes, all grows ripe,\" I said, \"your life-work, too,  Dear father. Are you happy now to know  Your book is printed, and the new world born?\"  He shook his head, a little sadly, I thought.  \"Autumn's too full of endings. Fruits grow ripe  And fall, and then comes winter.\"                                    \"Not for you!  Never,\" I said, \"for those who write their names  In heaven. Think, father, through all ages now  No one can ever watch that starry sky  Without remembering you. Your fame ...\"                                           And there  He stopped me, laid his hand upon my arm,  And standing in the darkness with dead leaves  Drifting around him, and his bare grey head  Bowed in complete humility, his voice  Shaken and low, he said like one in prayer,  \"Celeste, beware of that. Say truth, not fame.  If there be any happiness on earth,  It springs from truth alone, the truth we live  In act and thought. I have looked up there and seen  Too many worlds to talk of fame on earth.  Fame, on this grain of dust among the stars,  The trumpet of a gnat that thinks to halt  The great sun-clusters moving on their way  In silence! Yes, that's fame, but truth, Celeste,  Truth and its laws are constant, even up there;  That's where one man may face and fight the world.  His weakness turns to strength. He is made one  With universal forces, and he holds  The password to eternity.  Gate after gate swings back through all the heavens.  No sentry halts him, and no flaming sword.  Say truth, Celeste, not fame.\"                                 \"No, for I'll say  A better word,\" I told him. \"I'll say love.\"  He took my face between his hands and said--  His face all dark between me and the stars--  \"What's love, Celeste, but this dear face of truth  Upturned to heaven.\"                       He left me, and I heard,  Some twelve hours later, that this man whose soul  Was dedicate to Truth, was threatened now  With torture, if his lips did not deny  The truth he loved.                      I tell you all these things  Because to help him, you must understand him;  And even you may doubt him, if you hear  Only those plausible outside witnesses  Who never heard his heart-beats as have I.  So let me tell you all--his quest for truth,  And how this hate began.                           Even from the first,  He made his enemies of those almost-minds  Who chanced upon some new thing in the dark  And could not see its meaning, for he saw,  Always, the law illumining it within.  So when he heard of that strange optic-glass  Which brought the distance near, he thought it out  By reason, where that other hit upon it  Only by chance. He made his telescope;  And O, how vividly that day comes back,  When in their gorgeous robes the Senate stood  Beside him on that high Venetian tower,  Scanning the bare blue sea that showed no speck  Of sail. Then, one by one, he bade them look;  And one by one they gasped, \"a miracle.\"  Brown sails and red, a fleet of fishing boats,  See how the bright foam bursts around their bows!  See how the bare-legged sailors walk the decks!  Then, quickly looking up, as if to catch  The vision, ere it tricked them, all they saw  Was empty sea again.                       Many believed  That all was trickery, but he bade them note  The colours of the boats, and count their sails.  Then, in a little while, the naked eye  Saw on the sky-line certain specks that grew,  Took form and colour; and, within an hour,  Their magic fleet came foaming into port.  Whereat old senators, wagging their white beards,  And plucking at golden chains with stiff old claws  Too feeble for the sword-hilt, squeaked at once:  \"This glass will give us great advantages  In time of war.\"                   War, war, O God of love,  Even amidst their wonder at Thy world,  Dazed with new beauty, gifted with new powers,  These old men dreamed of blood. This was the thought  To which all else must pander, if he hoped  Even for one hour to see those dull eyes blaze  At his discoveries.                      \"Wolves,\" he called them, \"wolves\";  And yet he humoured them. He stooped to them.  Promised them more advantages, and talked  As elders do to children. You may call it  Weakness, and yet could any man do more,  Alone, against a world, "]]]
