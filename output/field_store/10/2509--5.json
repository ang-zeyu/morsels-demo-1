Salutes of 21 guns were fired at morning, noon, and sunset,  while on board our ship, which was decorated with all her colours, a  solemn _Te Deum_ was sung, after which the crew were mustered on parade.  The English ships of war also \"dressed,\" and returned our salute by one of  a similar number of guns. On the 30th there was a ball on board, to which  400 guests were invited, many of the _elite_ being overlooked through  sheer want of space or accommodation!    The hospitality extended to the Austrian officers was not however confined  to these public receptions, when they were thoroughly \"lionized\" during  their stay, but also included a constant round of invitations among  private circles, among which, without making invidious selections, where  we can but feel a lasting recollection of the cordial kindness we  everywhere experienced, we may specify those of H.E. Sir Wm. Denison, Sir  D. Cooper, Speaker, Stuart A. Donaldson, Esq. Chief Secretary, Dr. G.  Bennett, the eminent physician and naturalist, M. W. Sentis, French  Consul, and Captain Mann, chief engineer of the docks.    Here also our thanks are due to an estimable Austrian lady, a native of  Vienna, who, wafted on the pinions of Hymen to Australia, has not a little  contributed to uphold in that distant region the gentle dignity of the  Viennese ladies, and the renown of Germany for musical supremacy. This  lady, widely known in artistic circles as Mlle Amalie Mauthner, is now  Madame R----, having a few years since married a German gentleman settled  in Sydney. Quitting her home under the most auspicious anticipations for  the future, the newly-married lady arrived in Sydney just in time to see  her husband's house of business succumb under the first of the great  financial crises. Instead of a life of affluence and ease in the  gold-country, the sorely-tried lady was compelled to display her  irresistible energy and activity by availing herself of her eminent  musical attainments. The charming artist was speedily recognized and  cordially supported in Sydney. The wealthiest and most distinguished  families considered it an especial favour to be permitted to place their  children under Mad. R----'s tuition. Her concerts became the most  fashionable of the season, and the dark cloud which had gathered above the  young inexperienced wife on her arrival in Australia, had, thanks to her  marvellous energy and activity, gradually been dispelled, leaving a bright  sunny horizon of felicity and content.    We had but little opportunity of observing the phases of political life in  Sydney, our arrival being coincident with the \"dead season\" of politics.  We were just in time to be present at the spectacle of the prorogation of  Parliament. This ceremonial took place in the chamber of the Legislative  Council, the Governor-general officiating in person. The second chamber,  or Legislative Assembly, was, as in England, represented simply by a  deputation. Punctually at noon Black Rod threw open the doors and  announced in grave but loud tones, \"His Excellency the Governor-general of  New South Wales,\" upon which Sir William Denison entered the apartment  with much dignity, and assumed his seat under a sort of canopy. By his  side stood the Ministers, his private secretary, and an aide-de-camp.  Before him sat the President of the Legislative Council, and other high  dignitaries. Sir D. Cooper, Speaker of the Assembly,--whom we scarcely  recognized in his strange official costume, a black silk single-breasted  coat, richly laced with gold, and an immense full wig,--delivered a short  address, to which the Governor-general briefly responded, and the ceremony  was over and the Parliament prorogued. Australia now enjoys such a free  constitution, modelled after the English form, the administration of the  various colonies is so entirely autonomous, their duty to the mother  country so insignificant (so far as outward form goes), that the  colonists seem quite content with their present administration, and the  mal-contents, who once advocated separation and independence, even to the  length of ventilating the subject in Parliament, have now been reduced to  utter insignificance.    Each colony has, by the \"New Constitution Act\" of 1851, been provided with  the utmost freedom of self-government, the British Government only  reserving the right of veto in those cases where the colonial laws should  happen to run counter to the common law of the Empire. One hears, it is  true, many prognostications as to the result of dividing the country into  so many independent colonies, and having so many parliaments, especially  as to the immense preponderance that the inhabitants of the cities must  have over the scattered country population. A few even seem to be of  opinion that they must contain many elements eminently unsuitable to the  vitality of a mutually reliant, cohesive, law-abiding confederation. But  although some passing blots and temporary defects may be dragged to the  light of day, it must not be overlooked that the Australian continent is  almost as large as Europe, and that each of these colonies covers more  superficial area than most of the European states. As the laws and  administration are the same for all these, it is more probable that the  anticipated break up of moral power will rather take the form of  developing true political life, so that the masses will more honourably  and surely be enabled to appreciate their constitutional rights and  duties.    A few days before our departure some of the scientific staff had further  opportunity of communicating with the \"blacks.\" It was important to extend  our collection of craniological specimens for that branch of study, by  comparing the various races of men with each other, so as to enlarge our  knowledge of the physiological peculiarities of either sex and every race;  and as we had been told that numbers of skulls could be procured among the  _Gunyahs_, or sandstone cavities of Cook-river Bay, which had been a  favourite burial-place of the aborigines, we made an excursion thither,  still accompanied by our staunch friend, Mr. Hill.    Our light vehicle rattled merrily through the suburbs of New Town, a sort  of suburb of Sydney, thence over the Cook-river Dam, 1000 feet wide by 200  feet in length, to Coggera Cove, where several of the aborigines had  pitched a temporary camp. These were two Mestiza women with their  children, and Johnny, the last of the Sydney blacks, who might be about  40, and was a cripple in consequence of an injury sustained in childhood.  In 1836 there were 58 still alive; now Johnny is the last remaining  survivor!    We set off from Coggera Cove in a small, but safe, and well-built boat,  rowed by Johnny and some white colonists, bound for Cool-river Bay, but  our search in the sandstone caverns was unfortunately fruitless. Johnny  then conducted us to a spot where Tom Weiry, one of the last of the  chiefs, who lived at the mouth of Cool River, and died about twelve years  previous, had been buried. Tom Weiry, or Tom Ugly, as the English named  him, was a very athletic man, whose skeleton was a real prize for the  purposes of comparative anatomy. Close to the spot where, according to  Johnny, the last remains of the Australian chief reposed, were large  quantities of empty oyster-shells, indicating that the place in question  had once been a favourite resort of the \"blacks,\" attracted thither by the  prolific yield of this place in those shell-fish, one of their most highly  appreciated articles of food. At various spots traces of fires were  visible. The aborigines of the coast usually bury their dead clothed in  the woollen blanket they wore in life, with the heads seaward, and near  the coast, with but a few feet of earth over them. Unfortunately we had  our pains for our reward, although Johnny repeatedly assured us he had  himself, in picking up shell-fish, on that very spot seen projecting from  the sand human bones, that frightened the superstitious fellow from  prosecuting his search in that direction. Indeed, Johnny was positive some  other exploring naturalist had been there and walked off with our  contemplated anthropological prize.    We returned, our object unachieved, to our boat, and so back to Coggera  Cove, where we found tea and chocolate prepared in the renowned \"black  pot,\" that figures so much in bush life, off which we made an excellent  repast. With true kindliness Mr. Hill shared what we had brought with us  with the aborigines, who, on their part, showed themselves very obliging  and attentive.    A second excursion, still in Mr. Hill's company, was made after  craniological specimens to Long Bay, twelve miles distant, among whose  thickets a few natives had been residing for some weeks. The road thither  passed through gum tree forests, varied by wide grass plains covered with  the many-blossomed _Metrosidero_, with its long deep red stamens, and  brilliant _Melaleuca_, its twigs also nearly covered with white flowers,  among which rose the tapering flower-stem, ten or twelve feet high, of the  _Xanthorrhea_, something like reed-mace, surrounded by flights of  humming-birds, which were imbibing its delicious nectar with their long  bills. Great quantities of little birds were swarming about the brushwood  and rushes, occasionally coming quite trustfully so close to us that we  could have caught them with a butterfly net. We had been riding perhaps an  hour or two when Mr. Hill suddenly began to call in the native manner.  Those forthwith summoned by this quite unique sound replied from the  thicket, as if recognizing the approach of a friend, and in a minute or  two more we found ourselves in the midst of a number of aborigines of both  sexes, mostly naked, or with a coarse woollen cloth around them, lying at  full length on the ground in listless ease. Close by was a fire, over  which was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38480"],[0,"Scientific American, Vol. XXXIX.—No. 24. [New Series.], December 14, 1878 (#10)"],[1,"desiccation.

The annual official reports of the railroads of India place the length  of railways there at 7,5511/2 miles, of which 4921/2 miles were  completed during the year 1877, and 223 miles since the close of the  year. There are 8061/2 miles of double track; 5,9123/4 miles are  constructed on the 5 foot 6 inch gauge, and 1,6383/4 on narrower  gauges. The capital outlay on the State lines amounted to L3,122,051,  and on the guaranteed lines to L1,374,882, bringing the total capital  expenditure, up to the end of October, as regards the State, and to the  end of March last, as regards the guaranteed lines, to L113,144,541.  The expenditure up to the end of the year may be taken in round numbers  at L13,344,500. The revenue from all the open lines was L6,232,888, of  which L6,091,532 were earned by the guaranteed lines, with a capital of  L95,482,941, and L141,356 were earned by the State lines, on a capital  expenditure of L17,661,600. The net receipts from the guaranteed lines  exceeded the amount advanced for guaranteed interest by L1,454,591; the  year previous there was a deficit of L216,517.    A French engineer named Duponchel has made a report on the project of  a railroad across the Desert of Sahara. The projected railway would  run from Algiers to Timbuctoo, a distance of 2,500 kilometers. M.  Duponchel stated that the principal portion of the line would rest  during nearly its whole extent on layers of sand, and toward the end  on primitive volcanic rocks, granite, gneiss, etc. No mountainous  obstructions would have to be encountered. The average heat does not  appear to exceed 23 deg. or 24 deg. C. (73 2-5 deg. or 75 1-5 deg. Fah.), but account  must be taken of the great variations which occur in the 24 hours. For  instance, occasionally, a very cold night succeeds a temperature  of 40 deg. C. (104 deg. Fah.) in the day time. The great difficulty to be  overcome would be the want of water, which is not to be procured in  that region. M. Duponchel calculates that for three trains daily the  amount of water required would be 4,000 cubic meters, and that the  engineering science of the day is quite sufficient to supply even a  much greater quantity at the requisite points.    The government of Costa Rica has advertised for tenders for building  bridges on the second Atlantic Division of its railroad. There will  be needed 194 bridges. The bridges will vary in length from 3 feet  to 1,044 feet, and will be built for a track of 3 foot 31/2 inch gauge.  They will be of sufficient strength to stand a strain of 2,240 lbs.  to the lineal foot, in addition to the weight of the usual freight  carried.           *       *       *       *       *          THE WERDERMANN ELECTRIC LIGHT.      [Illustration: FIG. 1 THE WERDERMANN LAMP.]    It has been looked upon as essential that a certain distance should  separate the ends of the carbon electrodes used in electric lamps.  Every one has accepted this as an axiom. Mr. Werdermann's skepticism  has, however, caused him to doubt the axiom, and the result is that he  has discarded the electric arc space, and by placing his electrodes  in actual contact, has produced a lamp which provides the means of  dividing the electric current, and promises to give almost any number  of lights from a single machine. Mr. Werdermann's inventions, says the  _Engineering_, are secured by patents considerably in advance of those  of Mr. Edison, and may in their chief points be explained as follows:    In place of two electrodes of similar form and dimensions, one  electrode consists of a large bun-shaped disk of carbon placed with  the rounded face downward. The other carbon is a fine rod of carbon of  about 1/8 or 5-32 inch in diameter. The upper end of this is pointed  and maintained in contact with the center of the lower surface of the  disk. This rod is supported by means of a spring collar, which also  forms the circuit connection. This is within about 3/4 in. of the  top of the carbon, so that the 3/4 in. becomes incandescent, and the  contact between the two carbons being only a point, a small electric  arc is produced between the two carbons, while the electricity is at  the same time passed on through the carbon disk, and the connections  there attached to the next lamp.    [Illustration: DIAGRAM OF CURRENT.]    Referring to our diagrams, in Fig. 1 the upper carbon is shown at  C, and the rod carbon at c. The former is supported by means of an  adjustable jointed bracket, B, attached to the wood stand. The rod  carbon is guided by the spring collar on the top of the stand, and  to which the connection is made, and is supported by the fine cord  running over the pulley, P. This cord is attached to the clasp, D, at  the bottom of the rod, and to the balance weight, W, by which the rod  is maintained in constant, practical, though not absolute contact  with the disk. Round the upper part of the disk is a metal band, A, to  which the circuit wire is attached, and the current thus passed on to  the next lamps.    At a recent trial of this lamp, the current was derived from a small  Gramme electro-plating machine, requiring only 2 horse power to put  it in full work. It may therefore be assumed that this was about the  limit of the power at work to produce the light. At the commencement  of the proceedings two lights were maintained, each stated to be equal  to 320 sperm candles. At this rate the two lights would be equal to  640 candles, or 40 full power gas lights, each consuming 5 cubic feet  of 16 candle gas per hour. Such gas lights, it may be observed, are  not often seen, except in the argand form. The two lights burned with  extreme steadiness, there being no undulation, or flickering whatever,  although there was no glass globe to tone down any variations of  luster. The lights were perfectly bare and unprotected, and the place  where the trial was made was a workshop of moderate size.    Later in the evening one light was exhibited outside the building, in  an open thoroughfare, and the same perfect steadiness was observable.  After the two lights had been burning for a time they were  extinguished, and the current was sent through a row of ten lamps.  The light per lamp was of course reduced, but there was the remarkable  fact that ten lights were maintained by a comparatively weak machine,  driven by an engine exerting the power of only two horses.    The light of each of these ten lamps was stated to be that of 40  candles, making, therefore, a total of 400. A reduction of light,  consequent on the further division of the current, is thus apparent;  but for this loss there may be ample compensation in the superior  economy of a distributed light as compared with one that is  concentrated. In the case of the ten lamps, the light is equal to that  of 25 full power gas lights, consuming altogether 125 cubic feet of  gas per hour. The extremely small arc due to the peculiar arrangement  of the carbons in the Werdermann light has the advantage of offering  the least possible resistance to the passage of the current.    This resistance increases much more rapidly than is represented by  increase of distance between the carbon points. Hence the electric  power with Werdermann's lamp is economized to the utmost in this  respect, and it becomes possible--as in the recent experiment--to make  use of an electric current large in quantity but of low intensity.  The tension being small, there is the less difficulty with regard to  insulation. If one lamp or more should be accidentally extinguished,  the rest will continue to burn. The whole of the lamps can also be  extinguished and relit by merely stopping the current and then sending  it on again. No nice and troublesome adjustment with reference to the  length of the electric arc is requisite, and simple contact between  the point of the rod and the surface of the disk is sufficient for the  manifestation of the light.    In respect to duration, a carbon rod 5-32 in. in diameter, and a yard  long, obtained from Paris, costs a franc. This, placed in a large  lamp, having an estimated lighting power of 320 candles, will last  from 12 to 15 hours. The smaller lamps take a carbon of 1/8 in.  diameter.    Mr. Werdermann endeavors to make the resistance of the external  portion of the circuit equal to the internal resistance, in order to  obtain the greatest effect. It is well known that the best results  are obtained when the internal and external resistances are equal. The  method adopted is that known to electricians as the divided arc, and  will easily be understood from Fig. 2. Let B represent the source of  the electric current, and A a copper wire connected to the positive  and negative poles of the source as in the diagram. The wire, A, has  a certain resistance. Suppose, now, we arrange for the current to pass  as in the diagram, Fig. 3. By the insertion of the new wire, C, we  have lessened the total external resistance and increased the current,  as will be seen by reference to Ohm's law. C = E/(R+r) where C  = current; E = electromotive force; R = resistance external; r =  resistance internal. The fraction E/(R+r) increases as its denominator  is lessened.    The current passes along the two branches in equal quantities if the  resistances of the wires are equal, but inversely as the resistances  if they are unequal. Thus, if the branch, A, has a resistance, 9, and  C has a resistance, 1, 9-10 of the current will pass through C, and  1-10 through A. Similarly, for any number of branches the"]]]
