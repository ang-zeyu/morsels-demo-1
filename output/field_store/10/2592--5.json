Thirdly, a man should diligently attend to his inner Ground, that  there shall be nothing in it save God alone, and His eternal glory.  For alas! there are many men, both lay and clerical, who live  falsely beneath a fair show, and imagine that they can deceive the  everlasting God. No, in truth, thou deceivest thyself, and losest  the day of grace, and the favour of God, and makest thyself guilty  towards God, in that He gives the evil spirits power over thee, so  that thou canst do no good work. Therefore, watch while it is day,  that the hour of darkness and God's disfavour may not overtake thee,  and take heed that in thy inner ground God may dwell, and nought  besides. (75)    Even as each man in his baptism is placed under the charge of a  special angel, who is with him always and never leaves him, and  protects him waking and sleeping in all his ways and in all his  works, so every man has a special devil, who continually opposes him  and exercises him without ceasing. But if the man were wise and  diligent, the opposition of the devil and his exercises would be  much more profitable to him than the aid of the good angel; for if  there were no struggle, there could be no victory. (139)    SIN    WHEN a man has had the fair net of his soul torn by sin, he must  patch and mend it by a humble, repentant return to the grace and  mercy of God. He must act like one who wishes to make a crooked  stick straight: he bends the stick further back than it ought to go,  and by being thus bent back it becomes straight again. So must a man  do to his own nature. He must bend himself under all things which  belong to God, and break himself right off, inwardly and outwardly,  from all things which are not God.    Every deadly sin causes the precious blood of Christ to be shed  afresh. Jesus Christ is spiritually crucified many times every day.  (75)    FISHING FOR SOULS    THE fisherman throws his hook, that he may catch the fish; but the  fish itself takes the hook. When the fish takes the hook, the  fisherman is sure of the fish, and draws it to him. Even so, God has  thrown His hook and His net into all the world, before our feet,  before our eyes, before our minds, and He would gladly draw us  securely to Himself by means of all His creatures. By pleasurable  things He draws us on; by painful things He drives us on. He who  will not be drawn, is in fault; for he has not taken God's hook, nor  will he be caught in God's net. If he came therein, beyond doubt he  would be caught by God and would be drawn by God. It is not God's  fault if we will not be drawn; we should grasp the hand held out to  us. If a man were in a deep pool, and one tried to help him and pull  him out, would he not gladly grasp his hand and allow himself to be  pulled out? (42)    Where two things are so related to each other, that one may receive  something for the other, there must be something in common between  them. If they had nothing in common, there must be a middle term  between them, which has something in common both with the higher,  from which it may receive, and with the lower, to which it may  impart. Now God hath created all things, and especially mankind,  immediately for Himself. He created man for His pleasure. But by  sin, human nature was so far estranged from God, that it was  impossible for a man to attain to that, for which he was made. Now  Aristotle says that God and Nature are not unprofitable  workers--that is, what they work at, they carry to its end. Now God  created man that He might have pleasure in him. If then God's work  in creating mankind was not to be unprofitable, when they were so  far estranged from God by sin, that they could not receive that by  which they might return and attain the enjoyment of eternal  happiness, a Mediator was necessary between us and God, one who has  something in common with us and our natures, and also shares in the  nature of God. In order that on the one side, He might in Himself  destroy our sickness, which was a cause of all our sins, and also  destroy all our sins, to which our weakness has brought us; and on  the other side that He might include in Himself all the treasure of  grace and of God's honour, that He might be able to give us grace  richly, and forgiveness of our sins, and eternal glory hereafter,  this could only be, if the Son of God became man. (90)    Yea, the highest God and Lord of all lords, the Son of God, in His  deep love felt pity for us poor, sinful men, condemned to the flames  of hell. Though He was in the form of God, He thought it not robbery  (as St Paul says) to be equal with God, and He annihilated Himself,  and took upon Him the form of a servant, and was made like any other  man, being found in fashion as a man. He humbled Himself, and became  obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. (117)    THE EFFICACY OF DIVINE GRACE    ALL works which men and all creatures can ever work even to the end  of the world, without the grace of God--all of them together,  however great they may be, are an absolute nothing, as compared with  the smallest work which God has worked in men by His grace. As much  as God is better than all His creatures, so much better are His  works than all the works, or wisdom, or designs, which all men could  devise. Even the smallest drop of grace is better than all earthly  riches that are beneath the sun. Yea, a drop of grace is more noble  than all angels and all souls, and all the natural things that God  has made. And yet grace is given more richly by God to the soul than  any earthly gift. It is given more richly than brooks of water, than  the breath of the air, than the brightness of the sun; for spiritual  things are far finer and nobler than earthly things. The whole  Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, give grace to the soul, and  flow immediately into it; even the highest angel, in spite of his  great nobility, cannot do this. Grace looses us from the snares of  many temptations; it relieves us from the heavy burden of worldly  cares, and carries the spirit up to heaven, the land of spirits. It  kills the worm of conscience, which makes sins alive. Grace is a  very powerful thing. The man, to whom cometh but a little drop of  the light of grace, to him all that is not God becomes as bitter as  gall upon the tongue. (86)    Grace makes, contrary to nature, all sorrows sweet, and brings it  about that a man no longer feels any relish for things which  formerly gave him great pleasure and delight. On the other hand,  what formerly disgusted him, now delights him and is the desire of  his heart--for instance, weakness, sorrow, inwardness, humility,  self-abandonment, and detachment from all the creatures. All this is  in the highest degree dear to him, when this visitation of the Holy  Ghost, grace, has in truth come to him. Then the sick man, that is  to say the external man, with all his faculties is plunged  completely into the pool of water, even as the sick man who had been  for thirty-eight years by the pool at Jerusalem, and there washes  himself thoroughly in the exalted, noble, precious blood of Christ  Jesus. For grace in manifold ways bathes the soul in the wounds and  blood of the holy Lamb, Jesus Christ. (22)    PRAYER    THE essence of prayer is the ascent of the mind to God, as holy  teachers tell us. Therefore every good man, when he wishes to pray,  ought to collect his outer senses into himself, and look into his  mind, to see whether it be really turned to God. He who wishes that  his prayers may be truly heard, must keep himself turned away from  all temporal and external things, and all that is not Divine,  whether it be friend or joy (Freund oder Freude), and all vanities,  whether they be clothes or ornaments, and from everything of which  God is not the true beginning and ending, and from everything that  does not belong to Him. He must cut off his words and his conduct,  his manners and his demeanour, from all irregularity, inward or  outward. Dream not that that can be a true prayer, when a man only  babbles outwardly with his mouth, and reads many psalms, gabbling  them rapidly and hastily, while his mind wanders this way and that,  backwards and forwards. Much rather must the true prayer be, as St  Peter tells us, \"one-minded\"[39]that is, the mind must cleave to  God alone, and a man must look with the face of his soul turned  directly towards God, with a gentle, willing dependence on Him. (80)    If thy prayer has these conditions, thou mayst with true humility  fall at the feet of God, and pray for the gentle succour of God;  thou mayest knock at His fatherly heart, and ask for breadthat is,  for love. If a man had all the food in the world, and had not bread,  his food would be neither eatable, nor pleasant, nor useful. So it  is with all things, without the Love of God. Knock also at the door  through which we must go--namely, Christ Jesus. At this door, the  praying man must knock for three ends, if he wishes to be really  admitted. First he must knock devoutly, at the broken heart and the  open side, and enter in with all devotion, and in recognition of his  unfathomable poverty and nothingness, as poor Lazarus did at the  rich man's gate, and ask for crumbs of His grace. Then again, he  should knock at the door of the holy open wounds of His holy hands,  and pray for true Divine knowledge, that it may enlighten him and  exalt him. Finally, knock at the door of His holy feet, and pray for  true Divine love, which may unite thee with Him, and immerse and  cover thee in Him. (57)              MEDITATIONS ON THE SEVEN WORDS FROM THE CROSS            [From a devotional treatise on the Passion of Christ, published in a  Latin translation, by Surius, in 1548, and wrongly ascribed by him  to Tauler. The author was an unknown German of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4667"],[0,"Seven Wives and Seven Prisons (#10)"],[1,"fool I  confided to her the secret of my first marriage, and separation, and she  confided the same secret to her brother, a well-to-do wagon-maker in  Newark. So far as Elizabeth was concerned, she said she didn't care;  so long as the separation was mutual and final, since so many years  had elapsed, and especially since I hadn't seen the woman for full six  years, and was not supposed to know whether she was alive or dead, why,  it was as good as a divorce; so reasoned Elizabeth, and it was precisely  my own reasoning, and the reasoning which had got me into numberless  difficulties, to say nothing of jails and prisons. But the brother had  his doubts about it, and came and talked to me on the subject several  times. We quarrelled about it. He threatened to have me arrested for  bigamy. I told him that if he took a step in that direction I would flog  him. Then he had me brought before a justice for threatening him, with a  view to having me put under bonds to keep the peace. I employed a lawyer  who managed my case so well that the justice concluded there was no  cause of action against me.    But this lawyer informed me that the brother was putting, even then,  another rod in pickle for me, and that I had better clear out. I took  his advice, I went to the widow's house, packed my trunk, gathered  together what money I could readily lay hands upon, and with about $300  in my pocket, I started for New York, staying that night at a hotel in  Courtland street.    The following morning I went over to Jersey City, hired a saddle-horse,  and rode to Newark. The precise object of my journey I do not think I  knew myself; but I must have had some vague idea of persuading Elizabeth  to leave Newark and join me in New York or elsewhere. I confess, too,  that I was more or less under the influence of liquor, and considerably  more than less. However, no one would have noticed this in my appearance  or demeanor. I rode directly to Elizabeth's door, hitched my horse, and  went into the house. The moment my wife saw me she cried out:    \"For God's sake get out of this house and out of town as soon as you  can; they have been watching for you ever since yesterday; they've got a  warrant for your arrest; don't stay here one moment.\"    I asked her if she was willing to follow me, and she said she would  do so if she only dared but her brother had made an awful row, and had  sworn he would put me in prison anyhow; I had better go back to New York  and await events. I started for the door, and was unhitching my horse,  when the brother and a half dozen more were upon me. I sprang to the  saddle. They tried to stop me; the over-eager brother even caught me  by the foot; but I dashed through the crowd and rode like mad to Jersey  City, returned the horse to the livery stable, crossed the ferry to New  York, went to my hotel, got my trunk, and started for Hartford, Conn.,  where I arrived in the evening.    This was in the month of June, 1854. I went to the old Exchange Hotel in  State street, and very soon acquired a good practice. Indeed, it seems  as if I was always successful enough in my medical business--my mishaps  have been in the matrimonial line. When I had been in Hartford about  three months, and was well settled, I thought I would go down to New  York and see a married sister of Elizabeth's, who was living there, and  try to find out how matters were going on over in Newark. That I found  out fully, if not exactly to my satisfaction, will appear anon.    When I called at the sister's house, the servant told me she was out,  but would be back in an hour; so I left my name, promising to call  again. I returned again at one o'clock in the afternoon, and the sister  was in, but declined to see me. As I was coming down the steps, a  policeman who seemed to be lounging on the opposite side of the street,  beckoned to me, and suspecting nothing, I crossed over to see what he  wanted. He simply wanted to know my name, and when I gave it to him he  informed me that I was his prisoner. I asked for what? and he said \"as a  fugitive from justice in New Jersey.\"    This was for taking the pains to come down from Hartford to inquire  after the welfare of my wife! whose sister, the moment the servant told  her I had been there, and would call again, had gone to the nearest  police station and given information, or made statements, which led to  the setting of this latest trap for me. The policeman took me before a  justice who sent me to the Tombs. On my arrival there I managed to pick  up a lawyer, or rather one of the sharks of the place picked me up, and  said that for twenty-five dollars he would get me clear in three or  four hours. I gave him the money, and from that day till now, I have  never set eyes upon him. I lay in a cell all night, and next morning  Elizabeth's brother, to whom the sister in New York had sent word that  I was caged, came over from Newark to see me. He said he felt sorry for  me, but that he was \"bound to put me through.\" He then asked me if I  would go over to Newark without a requisition from the Governor of  New Jersey, and I told him I would not; whereupon he went away without  saying another word, and I waited all day to hear from the lawyer to  whom I had given twenty-five dollars, but he did not come.    So next day when the brother came over and asked me the same question,  I said I would go; wherein I was a fool; for I ought to have reflected  that he had had twenty-four hours in which to get a requisition, and  that he might in fact have made application for one already, without  getting it, and every delay favored my chances of getting out. But I had  no one to advise me, and so I went quietly with him and an officer to  the ferry, where we crossed and went by cars to Newark. I was at once  taken before a justice, who, after a hearing of the case, bound me over,  under bonds of only one thousand dollars, to take my trial for bigamy.    If I could have gone into the street I could have procured this  comparatively trifling bail in half an hour; as it was, after I was in  jail I sent for a man whom I knew, and gave him my gold watch and one  hundred dollars, all the money I had, to procure me bail, which he  promised to do; but he never did a thing for me, except to rob me.    A lawyer came to me and offered to take my case in hand for one hundred  dollars, but I had not the money to give him. I then sent to New York  for a lawyer whom I knew, and when he came to see me he took the same  view of the case that Elizabeth and I did; that is, that the long  separation between my first wife and myself, and my presumed ignorance  as to whether she was alive or dead, gave me full liberty to marry  again. At least, he thought any court would consider it an extenuating  circumstance, and he promised to be present at my trial and aid me all  he could.    I lay in Newark jail nine months, awaiting my trial. During that time I  had almost daily quarrels with the jailor, who abused me shamefully, and  told me I ought to go to State prison and stay there for life. Once he  took hold of me and I struck him, for which I was put in the dark cell  forty-eight hours. At last came my trial. The court appointed counsel  for me, for I had no money to fee a lawyer, and my New York friend was  on hand to advise and assist. I lad witnesses to show the length of time  that had elapsed since my separation from my first wife, and we also  raised the point as to whether the justice who married me, was really  a legal justice of the peace or not. The trial occupied two days. I  suppose all prisoners think so, but the Judge charged against me in  every point; the jury was out two hours, and then came in for advice on  a doubtful question; the judge gave them another blast against me, and  an hour after they came in with a verdict of \"guilty.\" I went back to  jail and two days afterwards was brought up for sentence which was--\"ten  years at hard labor in the State prison at Trenton.\"    Good heavens! All this for being courted and won by a widow!    The day following, I was taken in irons to Trenton. The Warden of  the prison, who wanted to console me, said that, for the offence, my  sentence was an awful one, and that he didn't believe I would be obliged  to serve out half of it. As I felt then, I did not believe I should live  out one-third of it. After I had gone through the routine of questions,  and had been put in the prison uniform, a cap was drawn down over my  face, as if I was about to be hung, and I was led, thus blind-folded,  around and around, evidently to confuse me, with regard to the interior  of the prison--in case I might ever have any idea of breaking out. At  last I was brought to a cell door and the cap was taken off. There were,  properly no \"cells\" in this prison--at least I never saw any; but good  sized rooms for two prisoners, not only to live in but to work in. I  found myself in a room with a man who was weaving carpets, and I was at  once instructed in the art of winding yarn on bobbins for him--in fact,  I was to be his \"bobbin-boy.\"    I pursued this monotonous occupation for two months, when I told the  keeper I did not like that business, and wanted to try something that  had a little more variety in it. Whereupon he put me at the cane chair  bottoming business, which gave me another room and another chum, and I  remained at this work while I was in the prison. In three weeks I could  bottom one chair, while my mate was bottoming nine or ten as his day's  work; but I told the keeper I did not mean to work hard, or work at all,  if I could help it. He was a very nice fellow and he only laughed and  let me do as I pleased. Indeed, I could not complain of my treatment  in any respect; I had a good clean room, good bed, and the fare was  wholesome and abundant. But then, there was that terrible, terrible  sentence of ten long years of this kind of life, if I should live  through it."]]]
