I can't go out; he'll guess something is the matter,\" she  cried to herself.    \"Polly?\" and there was a rap at the door.    \"Yes,\" said Polly from within.    \"Can I see you a minute?\"    Polly slowly opened the door, and tried to lift her brown eyes to his  face.    \"Oh, Polly,\" he pretended not to notice any thing amiss with her, \"I  came to tell you first; and you can help me to break it to father.\"    \"Oh, what is it?\" cried Polly, looking up quickly. \"Oh, Jasper,\" as she  saw that his face was drawn with the effort not to let her see the  distress he was in.    He tried to cover up his anxiety, but she saw a yellow paper in his  hand. \"Oh, Jasper, you've a telegram,\" she cried breathlessly.    \"Polly,\" said Jasper. He took her hand and held it firmly, \"you will  help father and me to bear it, I know.\"    \"Oh, Jasper, I will,\" promised Polly, clinging to his hand. \"Don't be  afraid to tell me, Jasper.\"    \"Listen; Marian has been thrown from her sleigh this morning; the horses  ran,\" said Jasper hurriedly. \"The telegram says 'Come.' She may be  living, Polly; don't look so.\"    For the room grew suddenly so dark to her that she wavered and would  have fallen had he not caught her. \"I won't faint,\" she cried, \"Jasper,  don't be afraid. There, I'm all right. Now, oh, what can I do?\"    \"Could you go with me when I tell father?\" asked Jasper. \"I am so afraid  I shall break it to him too sharply; and you know it won't do for him to  be startled. If you could, Polly.\"    For the second time, everything seemed to turn black before her eyes,  but Polly said bravely, \"Yes, I'll go, Jasper.\" And presently, they  hardly knew how, the two found themselves at old Mr. King's door.    There was a sound of voices within. \"Oh, dear me!\" exclaimed Polly, \"I  forgot Mamsie was here.\"    Jasper looked his surprise, but said nothing, and as they stood there  irresolutely, Mrs. Fisher opened the door and came out.    \"Why, Polly!\" she exclaimed.    \"Oh, Mrs. Fisher,\" cried Jasper, \"we can't explain now, we must see  father. But Polly will go and tell you,\" and in another minute they were  both standing before Mr. King.    The old gentleman was walking up and down his apartment, fuming at every  step. \"The presumption of the fellow! How did he dare without speaking  to me! Oh, eh, Polly\"--and then he caught sight of Jasper, back of her.    \"Father,\" began Jasper, \"I've had a telegram from brother Mason.\"    \"Oh, now what has he been doing?\" cried Mr. King irritably. \"I do wish  Mason wouldn't be so abrupt in his movements. I suppose he is going  abroad again. Well, let's hear.\"    Jasper tried to speak, but instead, looked at Polly.    \"Dear Grandpapa,\" cried Polly, going unsteadily to the old gentleman's  side, and taking his hand in both of hers. \"Oh, we must tell you  something very bad, and we don't know how to tell it, Grandpapa.\" She  looked up piteously into his face.    Old Mr. King put forth his other hand, and seized the back of a chair to  steady himself. \"Tell me at once, Polly,\" he said hoarsely. \"It  isn't--Marian?\" It was all he could do to utter the name.    \"She is hurt,\" said Polly, going to the heart of the matter without  delay, \"but oh, Grandpapa, it may not be very badly, and they want  Jasper to go on to New York.\"    [Illustration: \"WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL IT, GRANDPAPA.\"]    Mr. King turned to Jasper. \"Give me the telegram, my boy,\" he said  through white lips; when it was all read, \"Now tell Philip to pack me a  portmanteau.\"    \"Father,\" said Jasper, \"you are not going?\"    \"No questions are to be asked, Jasper,\" said his father. \"Be so good as  to see that Philip packs quickly, and that you are ready. And now,  Polly,\" the old gentleman turned to her, \"I want to take you along,  child, if your mother is willing. Will you go?\"    \"Oh, Grandpapa,\" cried Polly, \"if I only may; oh, do take me.\"    \"I don't want to go without you,\" said Mr. King. \"There, run, child, and  ask your mother if you may go. Send Phronsie to me; I must explain  matters to her and bid her good-by.\"    Alexia and some of the other girls were hurrying in the east doorway of  the King mansion, an hour later. \"Oh, where's Polly, Mrs. Fisher?\" cried  Cathie Harrison.    \"Polly has gone,\" said Mrs. Fisher, coming down the stairs. She looked  as if she wanted to cry, but her hands held the basket of sewing as  firmly as if no bad news had fallen upon the home.    \"Gone?\" cried all the girls. \"Oh, Mrs. Fisher, where? Do tell us where  Polly is?\"    For answer Mrs. Fisher made them all go into the little reception room  in an angle of the hall, where she told them the whole story.    \"If that isn't perfectly dreadful,\" cried Alexia Rhys, throwing her muff  into a chair, and herself on an ottoman. \"Why, we were going to make up  a theater party for to-morrow night. Mrs. Fisher, and now Polly is  gone.\"    Her look of dismay was copied by every girl so exactly, that Mrs. Fisher  had no relief in turning to any of the other four.    \"And there is her Recital--what will she do about that?\" cried Alexia,  rushing on in her complaint. \"Perhaps she'll give it up, after all,\" she  added, brightening. \"Now I most know she will, Mrs. Fisher,\" and she  started up and began to pirouette around the room.    \"Of course she has had to postpone it,\" said Mrs. Fisher, looking after  her, \"and she told Joel to write the notes to the pupils explaining  matters. But never you fear, Alexia, that Polly will give up that  Recital for good and all,\" she added, with a wise nod at her.    \"Well, she must give it up for now anyway,\" said Alexia, coming to a  pause to take breath, \"that's some comfort. To think of Joe writing  Polly's notes to the girls, oh, dear me!\"    \"Let us go and help him,\" proposed Cathie Harrison suddenly. \"He must  hate to do such poky work.\"    \"Oh, dear me,\" began Alexia, taking up her little bag to look at the  tiny watch in one corner. \"We haven't the time. Yes--come on,\" she burst  out incoherently; \"where is he, Mrs. Fisher?\"    \"In the library, hard at work,\" said Mrs. Fisher, with a bright smile at  them all.    \"Come on, girls,\" said Alexia, rushing on. \"Now that's what I admire  Mrs. Fisher for,\" she said, when they were well in the hall, \"she shows  when she's not pleased, and when she likes what a body does, as well.\"    \"I think she's just elegant,\" declared Cathie Harrison, who had  privately done a good deal of worshiping at Mrs. Fisher's shrine.    \"She's a dear,\" voted Alexia. \"Well, do come on. Oh, Joe!\" as they  reached the library door.    Joel sat back of the writing table, a mass of Polly's note paper and  envelopes sprawled before him, his head on his hands and his elbows on  the table. Back of him paced Pickering Dodge with a worried expression  of countenance.    \"You do look so funny,\" burst out Alexia with a laugh; \"doesn't he,  girls?\" to the bright bevy following her.    \"I guess you would if you were in my place,\" growled Joel, scarcely  giving them a glance. \"Go away, Alexia; you can't get me into a scrape  this morning--I've to dig at this.\"    \"I don't want to get you into a scrape,\" cried Alexia, with a cold  shoulder to Pickering, who had been claimed by the other girls, \"we're  going to help you.\"    \"Is that so?\" cried Joel radiantly; \"then I say you're just jolly,  Alexia,\" and he beamed at her.    \"Yes, we want to help,\" echoed Cathie, drawing up a chair to the other  side of the table. \"Now do set us to work, Joel.\"    \"Indeed and I will,\" he cried, spreading a clear place with a reckless  hand.    \"Take care,\" warned Alexia, \"take care; you are spoiling all Polly's  note paper. I wouldn't let you at my things, I can tell you, Joel  Pepper!\"    \"As if I'd ever do this sort of thing for you, Alexia,\" threw back Joel.    \"Well, do let us begin,\" begged Cathie, impatiently drumming on the  table, as the other two girls and Pickering Dodge drew near.    \"Yes, do,\" cried the girls, \"and we'll toss those notes off in no time.\"    \"I'll help you clear the table,\" cried Pickering; \"do let me. I can't  write those notes, but I can get the place ready;\" and he began to pile  the books on a chair. As he went around to Alexia's place she looked up  and fixed her gaze past him, not noticing his attempt to speak.    \"All right; if she wants to act like that, I'm willing,\" said Pickering  to himself savagely and coolly going on with his work.    \"Oh, dear me,\" groaned Cathie Harrison, \"isn't it perfectly dreadful to  have that dear sweet Mrs. Whitney hurt?\"    \"Ow!\" exclaimed Joel.    \"Do stop,\" cried Alexia with a nudge. \"Haven't you any more sense,  Cathie Harrison, than to speak of it?\"    [Illustration: \"NOW DO SET US TO WORK, JOEL\"]    Cathie smothered a retort, and bit her lips to keep it back.    \"Well, dear me, we are not working much,\" cried Alexia, pulling off her  gloves; \"how many notes have you to write, Joe?\"    \"Oh, a dozen, I believe,\" said Joel; \"that is, counting this one.\"    \"To whom is that?\" asked Alexia, peering over his shoulder. \"Oh, to Amy  Loughead.\"    \"Yes, I promised Polly this should go first. That Loughead girl was  expecting her over this morning. Oh, she's a precious nuisance,\"  grumbled Joel, dipping his pen in the ink.    \"Well, then, I will write to Desiree Frye,\" said Alexia. \"She was going  to play a solo, Polly said, at the Recital. Oh, dear me, what shall I  say?\"    \"Polly said tell them all what had happened, and that she should stay  away as long as Aunty needed her, but she hoped to be home soon, and she  would write them from New York.\"    \"Oh, Joe, what a lot,\" exclaimed Alexia, leaving her pen poised in mid  air.    \"Cut it short, then,\" said Joel. \"I don't care, only that's the sense of  it.\"    \"Oh, dear,\" began one of the girls, \"I can't bear to write of the  accident, and in the holidays, too.\"    Alexia made an uneasy gesture, scrawled two or three words, then threw  down"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7499"],[0,"Through Five Republics on Horseback, Being an Account of Many Wanderings in (#10)"],[1,"she does not persecute, but only that she does not persecute _saints_.  She punishes heretics--a very different thing. In the Rhemish New  Testament there is a note on the words, 'drunken with the blood of  saints,' which runs as follows: 'Protestants foolishly expound this of  Rome _because heretics are there put to death_. But _their_ blood is  not called _the blood of saints_, any more than the blood of thieves or  man-killers, or other malefactors; and for the shedding of it no  commonwealth shall give account.'\"    During my residence in Argentina a Jesuit priest in Cordoba publicly  stated that if he had his way he would burn to death every Protestant  in the country.    The following statements are from authorized documents, laws and  decrees of the Papacy:    \"The papacy teaches all her adherents that it is a sacred duty to  exterminate heresy.    \"Urban II. issued a decree that the murder of heretics was excusable.  'We do not count them murderers who, burning with the zeal of their  Catholic mother against the excommunicate, may happen to have slain  some of them.'\" [Footnote: \"Romanism and Reformation.\"]    In Argentine life the almanac plays an important part; in that each day  is dedicated to the commemoration of some saint, and the child born  must of necessity be named after the saint on whose day he or she  arrives into the world. The first question is, \"What name does it  bring?\" The baby may have chosen to come at a time when the calendar  shows an undesirable name, still the parents grumble not, for a saint  is a saint, and whatever names they bear must be good. The child is,  therefore, christened \"Caraciollo,\" or \"John Baptist,\" when, instead of  growing up to be a forerunner of Christ, he or she may, with more  likelihood, be a forerunner of the devil. Whatever name a child brings,  however, has Mary tacked on to it.    All names serve equally well for male or female children, as a  concluding \"o\" or \"a\" serves to distinguish the sex. Many men bear the  name of Joseph Mary. Numbers, also, both male and female, have been  baptized by the name of \"Jesus,\" \"Saviour,\" or \"Redeemer.\" If I were  asked the old question, \"What's in a name?\" I should answer, \"Very  little,\" for in South America the most insolent thief will often boast  in the appellation of _Don Justice_, and the lowest girl in the village  may be _Senorita Celestial_. _Don Jesus_ may be found incarcerated for  riotous conduct, and I have known _Don Saviour_ throw his unfortunate  wife and children down a well; _Don Destroyer_ would have been a more  appropriate name for him. _Mrs. Angel_ her husband sometimes finds not  such an angel after all, when she puts poison into his mate cup, a not  infrequent occurrence. Let none be deceived in thinking that the  appellation is any index to a man's character.    Dark, needy people--Rome's true children!    The school-books read: Which is the greatest country? _Ans._, Spain.  Who is the greatest man? _Ans._, The Pope. Why? Because he is  infallible.    It is his wish, and the priest's duty, to keep them in this darkness.  Yet,--One came from God, \"a light to lighten the Gentiles,\" and He  said, \"I am the Light of the world.\" Some day they may hear of Him and  themselves see the Light.    Already the day is breaking, and superstition must prepare to hide  itself. The uneducated native no longer pursues the railway train at  thundering pace to lasso it because the priest raved against its being  built. He even in some cases doubts if it is \"an invention of hell,\" as  he was taught.    The educated native, Alberdi, a publicist and an advocate of freedom,  in the discussion over religious rights of foreigners in the Argentine,  wrote: \"Spanish America reduced to Catholicism, with the exclusion of  any other cult, represents a solitary and silent convent of monks. The  dilemma is fatal,--either Catholics and unpopulated, or populated and  prosperous and tolerant in the matter of religion.\"          CHAPTER IV.    TEE PRAIRIE AND ITS INHABITANTS.      The Pampas, or prairie lands of the Argentine, stretch to the south and  west of Buenos Ayres, and cover some 800,000 square miles. On this vast  level plain, watered by sluggish streams or shallow lakes, boundless as  the ocean, seemingly limitless in extent, there is an exhilarating air  and a rich herbage on which browse countless herds of cattle, horses,  and flocks of sheep. The grass grows tall, and miles upon miles of rich  scarlet, white, or yellow flowers mingle with or overtop it. Beds of  thistles, in which the cattle completely hide themselves, stretch away  for leagues and leagues, and present an almost unbroken sheet of purple  flowers. So vast are these thistle-beds that a day's ride through them  only leaves the traveller with the same purple forest stretching away  to the horizon. The florist would be enchanted to see whole tracts of  land covered by the _Verbena Melindres_, which appears, even long  before you reach it, to be of a bright scarlet. There are also acres  and acres of the many-flowered camomile and numberless other plants;  while large tracts of low-lying land are covered with coarse pampa  grass, affording shelter for numberless deer, and many varieties of  ducks, cranes, flamingoes, swans and turkeys. Wood there is none, with  the exception of a solitary tree here and there at great distances,  generally marking the site of some cattle establishment OP _estancia_.  An _ombu_, or cluster of blue gums, is certain to be planted there.    On this prairie, man, notwithstanding the fact that he is the \"lord of  creation,\" is decidedly in the minority. Millions of four-footed  animals roam the plains, but he may be counted by hundreds. Let us turn  to him, however, in his isolated home, for the _Gaucho_ has been  described as one of the most interesting races on the face of the  earth. A descendant of the old conquerors, who, leaving their fair ones  in the Spanish peninsula, took unto them as wives the unclothed women  of the new world, he inherits the color and habits of the one with the  vices and dignity of the other. Living the wild, free life of the  Indian, and retaining the language of Spain; the finest horseman of the  world, and perhaps the worst assassin; the most open-handed and  hospitable, yet the accomplished purloiner of his neighbor's cattle;  imitating the Spaniard in the beautifully-chased silver trappings of  his horse, and the untutored Indian in his miserable adobe hovel;  spending his whole wealth in heavy gold or silver bell-shaped stirrups,  bridle, or spurs (the rowel of the latter sometimes having a diameter  of six inches), and leaving his home destitute of the veriest  necessities of life--such is the Gaucho. A horn or shell from the  river's bed makes his spoon, gourds provide him with his plates and  dishes; but his knife, with gold or silver handle and sheath, is almost  a little fortune in itself. Content in his dwelling to sit on a  bullock's skull, on horseback his saddle must be mounted in silver. His  own beard and hair he seldom trims, but his horse's mane and tail must  be assiduously tended. The baked-mud floor of his abode is littered  with filth and dirt, while he raves at a speck of mud on his  embroidered silk saddle-cloth.    The Gaucho is a strange contradiction. He has blushed at my good but  plain-looking saddle, yet courteously asked me to take a skull seat. He  may possess five hundred horses, but you search his kitchen in vain for  a plate. If you please him he will present you with his best horse,  waving away your thanks. If you displease him, his long knife will just  as readily find its way to your heart, for he kills his enemies with as  little compunction as he kills the ostrich. \"The Gaucho, with his proud  and dissolute air, is the most unique of all South American characters.  He is courageous and cruel, active and tireless. Never more at ease  than when on the wildest horse; on the ground, out of his element. His  politeness is excessive, his nature fierce.\" The children do not, like  ours, play with toys, but delight the parents' hearts by teasing a cat  or dog. These they will stick with a thorn or pointed bone to hear them  yell, or, later on, lasso and half choke them. \"They will put out their  eyes, and such like childish games, innocent little darlings that they  are.\" Cold-blooded torture is their delight, and they will cheer at the  sight of blood.    To describe the dress of this descendant of Adam I feel myself  incapable. A shirt and a big slouch hat seem to be the only articles of  attire like ours. Coat, trousers or shoes he does not wear. Instead of  the first mentioned, he uses the _poncho_, a long, broad blanket, with  a slit in the centre to admit his head. For trousers he wears very wide  white drawers, richly embroidered with broad needlework and stiffly  starched. Over these he puts a black _chiripa_, which really I cannot  describe other than as similar to the napkins the mother provides for  her child. Below this black and white leg covering come the long boots,  made from one piece of seamless hide. These boots are nothing more than  the skin from the hind legs of an animal--generally a full-grown horse.  The bend of the horse's leg makes the boot's heel. Naturally the toes  protrude, and this is not sewn up, for the Gaucho never puts more than  his big toe in the stirrup, which, like the bit in his horse's mouth,  must be of solid silver. A dandy will beautifully scallop these rawhide  boots around the tops and toes, and keep them soft with an occasional  application of grease. No heel is ever attached. Around the man's  waist, holding up his drawers and chiripa, is wound a long colored  belt, with tasseled ends left hanging over his boot, down the right  side; and over that he invariably wears a broad skin belt, clasped at  the front with silver and adorned all around with gold or silver coins.  In this the long knife is carried. "]]]
