I couldn't keep anything down that smells like that  for longer than one millionth of one split second. Holy catfish! Do you  suppose this Serrangi runs a slaughter house on the side? Boy! That  stench almost bounces when it hits you.\"    \"That's right,\" Freddy Farmer agreed. \"We should have remembered to  bring clothespins. Well, worse luck for us, we didn't. But what do you  say, Dave? Shall we get on with it?\"    \"Why not, we've come this far,\" Dave grunted, and started slouching  forward again. \"But, look, Freddy.\"    \"At what?\"    \"No, I mean, listen!\" Dave hissed out the corner of his mouth.  \"Bostworth handed us a pip this time. Like trying to win a ball game  in the last of the ninth with your team a couple of hundred runs  behind. What I mean is, that anything can happen from here on. Just  like Bostworth said, when we go through that door we're on our own. We  may strike out on three pitched balls, and then again we may run into  something mighty valuable to him. But there's two guys we've got to  look out for all the time. You and me. Now, if by any chance things do  get rough, keep close to me. We make it or don't, together. Okay?\"    \"Absolutely,\" Freddy Farmer replied quietly. \"Shoulder to shoulder all  the time, Dave, of course.\"    \"Maybe in Serrangi's place we'd better make it back to back,\" Dave  said. \"They're experts with knives in this part of the world, so I've  been told. So if we get back to back when things break bad, we'll at  least see who's doing what.\"    \"I'd feel happier if we were armed,\" Freddy Farmer said. \"I suppose  Bostworth was right when he said that carrying arms might get us into  trouble if we were searched. Just the same, though, I'd feel a lot  happier if we were armed.\"    \"You and me each, brother!\" Dave breathed softly as they neared the  front door of the smelly place. \"You and me each! However, maybe we'll  live to bless him for that word of caution.\"    \"Just so's we live will please me enough!\" Freddy muttered. Then as  they came almost abreast of the door, he added softly, \"I think it  would be best to speak bad French in this place. Much better than  English or German, don't you think?\"    \"Check, it'll be French,\" Dave said and gave Freddy's arm a quick  squeeze. \"Well, luck to us both. And do I hope I can keep that coffee  down! Okay, follow me, my little man.\"    Dave hesitated a moment, took a deep breath, and then pushed in  through the front door of the Devil's Den. He was instantly smacked in  the face by a babble of sound, and a stench that almost made his nose  drop off. For a second he could see only blurred yellow shadows, the  place was so heavy with cheap cigarette, and water-pipe smoke. Then as  he spotted an empty table to his left he gave a jerk of his head to  Freddy, and shuffled across the filthy floor and sat down. Leaning back  he lazily surveyed the place with his eyes. He had seen an awful lot of  terrible places since the first day of war, but the Devil's Den topped  them all, and then some. It was half store and half coffee shop. Along  one wall of the room, that was some forty feet deep and three quarters  as wide, was a series of shelves filled with bins that contained  everything from spices, tea, and native coffee to pith helmets and old  army uniforms. On the opposite side was a row of battered tables so  badly stained it was impossible to tell the original color of the wood.  The sirupy coffee of the hot countries was spilled all over the table,  and it was quite probable that no efforts had been made to mop up the  sticky drippings in the last six months. And where there wasn't coffee  there was dirt or cigarette ash.    Seated at the tables was a mixture of all races from Suez to Saigon,  and from Hongkong to Borneo. There were Malays and Chinese, Sumatrans  and Tamils from India, Filipinos and Punjabis, Arabs and Siamese,  Persians, and a smattering that had once claimed kinship with the white  races but had sunk so low they were no longer any part of a white man.    Dave's heart looped over and his stomach churned as he let his sleepy,  seemingly uninterested gaze travel slowly about the room. Many of those  there looked at him in return, but only for the smallest part of a  second. It seemed to be sort of an unwritten law that you didn't stare  too hard or too long at your fellow coffee drinkers in the Devil's Den.  Some of them didn't so much as lift their heads when Dave and Freddy  entered. Either they weren't interested in newcomers or else they were  too full of the poison of the Far East to get up the strength.    There was one, however, who took real interest in the arrival of the  two slouching ones in dirty sea water stained clothes. He was standing  near the steaming coffee urns at the far end of the room near a door.  As Dave's eyes passed over the scarred face with the cast in the right  eye it was all the young American could do to check himself from  starting violently. Serrangi's face would certainly scare even Satan,  himself. The man was not very tall, and he seemed not to have much  flesh on his bones. Yet somehow he gave you the impression of coiled  steel springs ready to lash out in any and all directions. A scarecrow,  perhaps, but with the strength of a killer in his thin arms, legs, and  body. But it was the eyes. Particularly the one with the cast. That one  was a dirty grey white; a dirty grey white beam of light that seemed to  go right through you and read your innermost thoughts on the way. For  perhaps a split second Dave had a look at the mysterious Serrangi, but  in that brief period of time he saw all he ever wanted to see of the  man.    He let his lazy gaze travel on and then brought it to rest on an evil  faced native waiter sliding toward them. The man came to a halt at  Dave's elbow and hissed something in a tongue Dave couldn't catch.    \"Bring coffee,\" Dave growled in heavily accented French. Then as an  afterthought, \"And cigarettes, too!\"    \"So?\" the native snarled right back in the same tongue. \"Here one sees  the color of a man's money first.\"    Dave glared and reluctantly pulled a small silver coin from his pocket  and slapped it on the table.    \"The color of a silver knife, eh?\" he grunted and jerked his head  toward the urns. \"Go bring us some!\"    The native waiter half bowed, flicked out a grimy paw and the silver  coin wasn't there anymore. At the same time he slithered around and  glided away. Dave had the feeling as though a snake had just wiggled  across his chest, and it was all he could do to stop the shiver that  welled up inside of him. Instead he slumped over the table and rubbed a  hand tentatively up and down the side of his face. He did it to cover  up the movement of his lips as he whispered to Freddy.    \"Nice joint!\" he breathed. \"I wonder if the floorshow's as good. Gives  you the creeps, doesn't it?\"    \"Goose pimples all over!\" Freddy replied. \"Am jolly well sure they'll  be permanent. Notice how our little friend gave us the eye? And is  still doing it? Rotten looking chap, for fair. Should jail him because  of his face alone. Horrible fellow. He.... Heads up, Dave!\"    The last just barely carried to Dave's ears but there was a tremor in  Freddy's voice that was just as good as a wild yell of alarm. He cut  short what he might have said to the English youth, made a final pass  at the side of his face then cupped his chin in his hand and stared  moodily off into space. Every part of him, though, was on the alert,  and in less than no time he realized why Freddy Farmer had breathed the  warning. A filthy native who had been seated by the front door when  they entered was slowly edging toward the table next to theirs, but not  noticeably so, unless you were on your guard, which good old Freddy  Farmer was proving he was!    Still staring off into space Dave watched the native out of the corner  of his eye. The man finally reached the table, muttered what sounded  like an apology to two half cast Malays seated at the table, slid into  a chair and promptly to all intent and purposes rested his forehead on  his folded arms on the table and went sound asleep. Even the sound of  his breathing was like that of a half doped man, but Dave Dawson was  not fooled one single bit. And neither was Freddy Farmer. One of the  dirty native's ears showed and they both felt certain that every sound  they made was being registered by that ear.    Shifting his position to a more comfortable one Dave let his eyes  meet Freddy's for the fraction of a second. In that swift period of  time a world of understanding passed between them. That native who  faked sleeping off the effects of some drug at the next table was  unquestionably one of Serrangi's men. He was there to eavesdrop on  their talk. To listen to every word they said, and perhaps send a  signal to Serrangi that could well be their death warrant. However,  that thought cheered them rather than caused icy fingers to clutch at  their hearts. If the man _was_ one of Serrangi's spies he was playing  right into their hands. What better opportunity could they ask for  than this one to give the code signal revealing them as Nazi agents in  Singapore?    It was perfect. It was made to order. Yet, on the other hand, it seemed  so perfect that Dave caught his brain swaying way over the other way.  To the side of extra, extra caution. Was this in reality a trap? Would  it be wise to mention the code word when a total stranger was sitting  so close? Had Bostworth's agent made that mistake when he entered the  Devil's Den, and it had proved to be a fatal one? Would it not be  better to wait, to spend a while over their first cup of coffee before  trying to contact possible Nazi agents in the room? It was perhaps best  to....    Dave cut off the rest of the thought as the shadow of the filthy native  waiter suddenly appeared at his elbow as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5067"],[0,"The Rainbow Trail (#10)"],[1," his help was to come, embraced  all that wild and speaking nature around and above him and surrendered  himself utterly.    \"I am young. I am free. I have my life to live,\" he said. \"I'll be a  man. I'll take what comes. Let me learn here!\"    When he had spoken out, settled once and for ever his attitude toward  his future, he seemed to be born again, wonderfully alive to the  influences around him, ready to trust what yet remained a mystery.    Then his thoughts reverted to Fay Larkin. Could this girl be known to  the Mormons? It was possible. Fay Larkin was an unusual name. Deep into  Shefford's heart had sunk the story Venters had told. Shefford found  that he had unconsciously created a like romance--he had been loving a  wild and strange and lonely girl, like beautiful Bess Venters. It was  a shock to learn the truth, but, as it had been only a dream, it could  hardly be vital.    Shefford retraced his steps toward the post. Halfway back he espied a  tall, dark figure moving toward him, and presently the shape and the  step seemed familiar. Then he recognized Nas Ta Bega. Soon they were  face to face. Shefford felt that the Indian had been trailing him over  the sand, and that this was to be a significant meeting. Remembering  Withers's revelation about the Navajo, Shefford scarcely knew how to  approach him now. There was no difference to be made out in Nas Ta  Bega's dark face and inscrutable eyes, yet there was a difference to be  felt in his presence. But the Indian did not speak, and turned to walk  by Shefford's side. Shefford could not long be silent.    \"Nas Ta Bega, were you looking for me?\" he asked.    \"You had no gun,\" replied the Indian.    But for his very low voice, his slow speaking of the words, Shefford  would have thought him a white man. For Shefford there was indeed an  instinct in this meeting, and he turned to face the Navajo.    \"Withers told me you had been educated, that you came back to the  desert, that you never showed your training.... Nas Ta Bega, did you  understand all I told Withers?\"    \"Yes,\" replied the Indian.    \"You won't betray me?\"    \"I am a Navajo.\"    \"Nas Ta Bega, you trail me--you say I had no gun.\" Shefford wanted  to ask this Indian if he cared to be the white man's friend, but the  question was not easy to put, and, besides, seemed unnecessary. \"I am  alone and strange in this wild country. I must learn.\"    \"Nas Ta Bega will show you the trails and the water-holes and how to  hide from Shadd.\"    \"For money--for silver you will do this?\" inquired Shefford.    Shefford felt that the Indian's silence was a rebuke. He remembered  Withers's singular praise of this red man. He realized he must change  his idea of Indians.    \"Nas Ta Bega, I know nothing. I feel like a child in the wilderness.  When I speak it is out of the mouths of those who have taught me. I must  find a new voice and a new life.... You heard my story to Withers. I am  an outcast from my own people. If you will be my friend--be so.\"    The Indian clasped Shefford's hand and held it in a response that  was more beautiful for its silence. So they stood for a moment in the  starlight.    \"Nas Ta Bega, what did Withers mean when he said go to the Navajo for a  faith?\" asked Shefford.    \"He meant the desert is my mother.... Will you go with Nas Ta Bega into  the canyon and the mountains?\"    \"Indeed I will.\"    They unclasped hands and turned toward the trading-post.    \"Nas Ta Bega, have you spoken my tongue to any other white man since you  returned to your home?\" asked Shefford.    \"No.\"    \"Why do you--why are you different for me?\"    The Indian maintained silence.    \"Is it because of--of Glen Naspa?\" inquired Shefford.    Nas Ta Bega stalked on, still silent, but Shefford divined that,  although his service to Glen Naspa would never be forgotten, still it  was not wholly responsible for the Indian's subtle sympathy.    \"Bi Nai! The Navajo will call his white friend Bi Nai--brother,\" said  Nas Ta Bega, and he spoke haltingly, not as if words were hard to find,  but strange to speak. \"I was stolen from my mother's hogan and taken to  California. They kept me ten years in a mission at San Bernardino and  four years in a school. They said my color and my hair were all that  was left of the Indian in me. But they could not see my heart. They took  fourteen years of my life. They wanted to make me a missionary among my  own people. But the white man's ways and his life and his God are not  the Indian's. They never can be.\"    How strangely productive of thought for Shefford to hear the Indian  talk! What fatality in this meeting and friendship! Upon Nas Ta Bega had  been forced education, training, religion, that had made him something  more and something less than an Indian. It was something assimilated  from the white man which made the Indian unhappy and alien in his own  home--something meant to be good for him and his kind that had ruined  him. For Shefford felt the passion and the tragedy of this Navajo.    \"Bi Nai, the Indian is dying!\" Nas Ta Bega's low voice was deep and  wonderful with its intensity of feeling. \"The white man robbed the  Indian of lands and homes, drove him into the deserts, made him a gaunt  and sleepless spiller of blood.... The blood is all spilled now, for  the Indian is broken. But the white man sells him rum and seduces his  daughters.... He will not leave the Indian in peace with his own God!...  Bi Nai, the Indian is dying!\"    . . . . . . . . . . .    That night Shefford lay in his blankets out under the open sky and the  stars. The earth had never meant much to him, and now it was a bed. He  had preached of the heavens, but until now had never studied them. An  Indian slept beside him. And not until the gray of morning had blotted  out the starlight did Shefford close his eyes.    . . . . . . . . . . .    With break of the next day came full, varied, and stirring incidents  to Shefford. He was strong, though unskilled at most kinds of outdoor  tasks. Withers had work for ten men, if they could have been found.  Shefford dug and packed and lifted till he was so sore and tired that  rest was a blessing.    He never succeeded in getting on a friendly footing with the Mormon  Whisner, though he kept up his agreeable and kindly advances. He  listened to the trader's wife as she told him about the Indians, and  what he learned he did not forget. And his wonder and respect increased  in proportion to his knowledge.    One day there rode into Kayenta the Mormon for whom Withers had been  waiting. His name was Joe Lake. He appeared young, and slipped off his  superb bay with a grace and activity that were astounding in one of his  huge bulk. He had a still, smooth face, with the color of red bronze and  the expression of a cherub; big, soft, dark eyes; and a winning smile.  He was surprisingly different from Whisner or any Mormon character that  Shefford had naturally conceived. His costume was that of the cowboy on  active service; and he packed a gun at his hip. The hand-shake he gave  Shefford was an ordeal for that young man and left him with his whole  right side momentarily benumbed.    \"I sure am glad to meet you,\" he said in a lazy, mild voice. And he  was taking friendly stock of Shefford when the bay mustang reached  with vicious muzzle to bite at him. Lake gave a jerk on the bridle that  almost brought the mustang to his knees. He reared then, snorted, and  came down to plant his forefeet wide apart, and watched his master with  defiant eyes. This mustang was the finest horse Shefford had ever seen.  He appeared quite large for his species, was almost red in color, had a  racy and powerful build, and a fine thoroughbred head with dark, fiery  eyes. He did not look mean, but he had spirit.    \"Navvy, you've sure got bad manners,\" said Lake, shaking the mustang's  bridle. He spoke as if he were chiding a refractory little boy. \"Didn't  I break you better'n that? What's this gentleman goin' to think of you?  Tryin' to bite my ear off!\"    Lake had arrived about the middle of the forenoon, and Withers announced  his intention of packing at once for the trip. Indians were sent out on  the ranges to drive in burros and mustangs. Shefford had his thrilling  expectancy somewhat chilled by what he considered must have been Lake's  reception of the trader's plan. Lake seemed to oppose him, and evidently  it took vehemence and argument on Withers's part to make the Mormon  tractable. But Withers won him over, and then he called Shefford to his  side.    \"You fellows got to be good friends,\" he said. \"You'll have charge of my  pack-trains. Nas Ta Bega wants to go with you. I'll feel safer about my  supplies and stock than I've ever been.... Joe, I'll back this stranger  for all I'm worth. He's square.... And, Shefford, Joe Lake is a Mormon  of the younger generation. I want to start you right. You can trust  him as you trust me. He's white clean through. And he's the best  horse-wrangler in Utah.\"    It was Lake who first offered his hand, and Shefford made haste to meet  it with his own. Neither of them spoke. Shefford intuitively felt  an alteration in Lake's regard, or at least a singular increase of  interest. Lake had been told that Shefford had been a clergyman, was now  a wanderer, without any religion. Again it seemed to Shefford that he  owed a forming of friendship to this singular fact. And it hurt him. But  strangely it came to him that he had taken a liking to a Mormon.    About one o'clock the pack-train left Kayenta. Nas Ta Bega led the way  up the slope. Following him climbed half a dozen patient, plodding,  heavily laden burros. Withers came next, and he turned in his saddle  to wave good-by to his wife. Joe Lake appeared to be busy keeping a  red mule and a wild gray mustang and a couple of restive blacks in the  trail. Shefford brought up in the rear.    His mount was a beautiful black mustang with three white feet, a white  spot on his nose,"]]]
