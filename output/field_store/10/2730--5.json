However, that  would be but trifling; our guns would cover the landing, and knock the  place about his ears; but to penetrate the jungle would be vastly more  difficult an affair. If, as is probable, he has succeeded in inducing  some of his neighbors to join him, they may have already sent strong  contingents, and the forest may be full of them. In that case it would  be quite beyond our power to rout them out, and I certainly should  not be justified in attempting it. The destruction of his town and  the burning of his palace would be a serious blow to him, but the  destruction of his piratical fleet would be a very much heavier one. If  we can achieve that, we shall have done good service.    \"The first thing to do is to find out whether there is a path either  from this river, or the other branch, to the pool. If so, at dark,  after destroying the town, we will recall all the men on shore, buoy the  anchor and drop it noiselessly, and drift down the river till we are far  enough away to use the engines, then steam down to the junction of the  two streams, and up again to the entrance to the creek on that side.  Then we will at once land a very strong party, land also two twenty-four  pounders, and drag them to the pool. We might hope to do so without any  opposition, for the Malays would no doubt be gathered at the edge of the  forest near the town to repel any attack we might make from there,  and before morning we might have the guns in position. I should take a  hundred empty sacks. These you would fill with earth when you get near  the pool, and form a battery with them behind the screen of bushes;  then, when you are ready, you will cut down the bushes and open fire.\"    \"I don't see why that should not succeed, sir. Of course the most  difficult part of the operation is dragging the guns. These native paths  are only broad enough for men in single file.\"    \"Yes, that is the difficulty. We could not employ axes to cut down the  trees, and to saw them down would be an interminable work. I think, Mr.  Ferguson, we should have to carry them.\"    \"I doubt if we could carry a twenty-four pounder, sir; but we might  carry an eighteen. They have bamboos of almost any length here, and if  we were to lash an eighteen pounder between two of them, I should say  that ten men each side ought to able to carry them, while as many more  might take the gun carriage.\"    \"We will get some bamboos today, Mr. Ferguson, and try the experiment of  how many men will be required to carry a gun; but now I think of it,  I fancy that it will be still easier to lay the guns down on a sledge  shaped piece of timber--these paths are smooth enough where the natives  tread, and the men could haul the guns along with ropes.\"    \"That would be better and easier, sir. The difficulty with the carriages  will be greatest, but they might be taken to pieces as far as possible  and slung on bamboos.\"    \"I think that we shall be able to manage all that,\" the captain said  cheerfully. \"The first thing is to find the path. There is almost sure  to be one from the village the Malay spoke of as close to the mouth  of the creek, and the pool, and if we send the boats up as soon as we  arrive at the creek, to row with muffled oars until they get near the  pool, and then land and find the path, it would diminish very much the  distance they would have to go and the work to be done.\"    \"It would be a great thing to find that out beforehand, sir. If you  like, I will drop down the river this afternoon in the gig; that will  attract no attention, for it will be thought that we are merely going  fishing or shooting. As soon as it is dark we will muffle the oars,  and row up the other branch, find the mouth of the creek and row up it,  first find how far it is to the pool, then drop down a quarter of a mile  and land, strike into the jungle, and look for the path. I should, of  course, choose a point where the creek bends that way, for as the path  no doubt goes straight from the village to the pool, it would be nearer  the creek at a bend than it would be at any other point. If it is a  sharp bend it might go quite close to it.\"    \"That would be a very good plan, Mr. Ferguson, and as you have proposed  it, you shall take command of the boat; otherwise I should have sent  either the third lieutenant or Morrison. I need not say that it will be  necessary to use the greatest caution, and to avoid all risks as much  as possible, though I fancy that my gig would run away from any of the  ordinary native craft; but, of course, the great point is to avoid being  noticed, for were one of our boats seen up the other river near the  creek, the alarm would be given, and the prahus might at once shift  their position, and make up the river, where we should have little  chance of finding them again.\"    \"I quite understand that, sir, and will be as careful as possible. I  will take one of the midshipmen with me, either Mr. Parkhurst or Mr.  Balderson; if the worst came to the worst and one of the men were hit,  he could man his oar, or, if I were myself badly wounded, could take the  command. I think it is Balderson's turn for boat duty.\"    \"Either of them will do,\" the captain said; \"they are both strong,  active lads, and as steady as you can expect lads to be.\"    Accordingly, at four in the afternoon the captain's gig was lowered. As  the rule was that all men on boat duty should go armed no surprise had  been excited when the order was given for the men to take their muskets  and cutlasses, though, when an extra supply of ammunition and a brace of  pistols were served out to each, they thought that something unusual was  in the wind, and there was a grin on the men's faces when a hamper of  provisions was placed in the bow of the boat. Dick was in a state of  high but suppressed delight when informed by the first lieutenant that  he was to accompany him on a boat expedition, and that he had better  take his cloak with him, as they might be out all night.    \"You can take your pistols with you, Mr. Balderson; it is not likely  that they will be wanted, but it is as well to carry them.\"    Dick borrowed a cutlass from the armorer and ground it down to a razor  edge, for his dirk was an altogether useless weapon if it came to  fighting. He was the more convinced that something more than usual was  intended when he saw the assistant surgeon place a parcel in the stern  sheets.    \"Bandages, I expect,\" he said. \"Where do you think we can be going,  Harry?\"    \"Perhaps you are going up the creek again, Dick. Who's going in  command?\"    \"I have not heard. Morrison says he has not been told off, so I suppose  it is Hopkins; in fact, if you are going up the creek, it is sure to  be him, as one of us who went up there before would certainly be  in command. It is rum they're taking the captain's gig. He is very  particular about it, and it is very seldom indeed that even the first  luff uses it.\"    \"I suppose they think it possible that you may be chased, and there  is no doubt she is far away the fastest boat on board. She is not a  dockyard boat, but, as you know, is one the captain had specially built  for himself, and for racing if we were at any station where there were  other warships.\"    When four o'clock came, and the first lieutenant, with his cloak over  his arm, came out and took his place in the boat, there was a general  look of surprise among the sailors leaning on the rail to see her put  off, for it was a very unusual thing for the first officer to take the  command when only a single boat's crew were going out on any expedition.    \"Row easy, men,\" Mr. Ferguson said, as he sat down on one side of the  coxswain, while Dick took his place on the other. \"Drop quietly down the  river. There is my fishing rod by your side, Mr. Balderson; you may as  well begin to put it together at once, so that the natives on shore may  see that we are going on a fishing expedition.\"    They rowed some ten miles down at a leisurely pace, and then the  boat's grapnel was dropped at a bend of the stream, where the water was  unusually deep, and several baskets of fish had been taken at various  times. A spare rod was brought out from under the seat, and Mr. Ferguson  and Dick began to fish, one on each side of the boat, while the men lay  on their oars, and a look of satisfaction came over their faces as the  lieutenant told them that they could smoke. Hitherto, Dick had been in  ignorance as to the object of the expedition. He had been much surprised  when the order had been given for the boat to row down the river, and it  was therefore evident that it was not the intention of the first officer  to again explore the creek.    Several fish were caught, but as soon as it became dark the lieutenant  said, \"You can throw them overboard again, Mr. Balderson; we don't want  any extra weight in the boat, and these fish must weigh thirty pounds at  least. Now what do you suppose we are going to do?\"    \"I have no idea, sir. I thought that we might be going up the creek that  Lieutenant Hopkins explored the other day, to have another look at the  prahus; but as we came down the river instead of going up, of course it  is not that.\"    \"No; we are going to explore the creek, but from the other end.\"    \"That will be first rate, sir, but I am afraid that we shan't find water  enough for the Serpent.\"    \"No, I fear that there is little chance of that; still we may obtain  information that will be valuable.\"    The night was a dark one, and an hour after sunset the grapnel was got  up, and the boat continued its way down the river, the oars being now  muffled, and the strictest silence ordered.    \"Keep your eyes open, Mr. Balderson,\" the lieutenant said. \"I think that  it must be another three miles to the point where "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7353"],[0,"Birds in Town & Village (#10)"],[1,"main idea is that birds that are fed on the premises, that  live and feed among the trees, search for and attack the gardeners'  enemies at every stage of their existence. At the same time he believes  that it is very bad to grow fruit near woods, as in such a case the  birds that live in the woods and are of no advantage to the garden,  swarm into it as the fruit ripens, and that it is only by liberal use of  nets that any reasonable portion of the fruit can be saved.    He answered that with regard to the last point he did not quite agree  with Mr. Witherspoon. All the gardens and orchards in the village were  raided by the birds from the wood, yet he reckoned they got as much  fruit from their trees as others who had no woods near them. Then there  was the big cherry plantation, one of the biggest in England, so that  people came from all parts in the blossoming time just to look at it,  and a wonderful sight it was. For a quarter of a mile this particular  orchard ran parallel with the wood; with nothing but the green road  between, and when the first fruit was ripening you could see all the big  trees on the edge of the wood swarming with birds--jays, thrushes,  blackbirds, doves, and all sorts of tits and little birds, just waiting  for a chance to pounce down and devour the cherries. The noise kept them  off, but many would dodge in, and even if a gun was fired close to them  the blackbirds would snatch a cherry and carry it off to the wood. That  didn't matter--a few cherries here and there didn't count. The starlings  were the worst robbers: if you didn't scare them they would strip a tree  and even an orchard in a few hours. But they were the easiest birds to  deal with: they went in flocks, and a shout or rattle or report of a gun  sent the lot of them away together.  His way of looking at it was this.  In the fruit season, which lasts only a few weeks, you are bound to  suffer from the attacks of birds, whether they are your own birds only  or your own combined with others from outside, unless you keep them off;  that those who do not keep them off are foolish or indolent, and deserve  to suffer. The fruit season was, he said, always an anxious time.    In conclusion, I remarked that the means used for protecting the fruit,  whether they served their purpose well or not, struck me as being very  unworthy of the times we lived in, and seemed to show that the British  fruit-growers, who were ahead of the world in all other matters  connected with their vocation, had quite neglected this one point. A  thousand years ago cultivators of the soil were scaring the birds from  their crops just as we are doing, with methods no better and no worse,  putting up scarecrows and old ragged garments and fluttering rags,  hanging a dead crow to a stick to warn the others off, shouting and  yelling and throwing stones. There appeared to be an opening here for  experiment and invention. Mere noise was not terrifying to birds, and  they soon discovered that an old hat on a stick had no injurious brains  in or under it. But certain sounds and colours and odours had a strong  effect on some animals. Sounds made to stimulate the screams of some  hawks would perhaps prove very terrifying to thrushes and other small  birds, and the effect of scarlet in large masses or long strips might be  tried. It would also be worth while to try the effect of artificial  sparrow-hawks and other birds of prey, perched conspicuously, moving and  perking their tails at intervals by clockwork. In fact, a hundred things  might be tried until something valuable was found, and when it lost its  value, for the birds would in time discover the deception, some new plan  adopted.    To this dissertation on what might be done, he answered that if any one  could find out or invent any new effective means to keep the birds from  the fruit, the fruit-growers would be very thankful for it; but that no  such invention could be looked for from those who are engaged on the  soil; that it must come from those who do not dig and sweat, but sit  still and work with their brains at new ideas.    This ended our conversation, and I left him more than satisfied at the  information he had given me, and with a higher opinion than ever of his  geniality and good practical sense.    It was a relief when the noisy, bird-scaring business was done with, and  the last market baskets of ripe cherries were carried away to the  station. Very splendid they looked in such large masses of crimson, as  the baskets were brought out and set down in the grassy road; but I  could not help thinking a little sadly that the thrushes and blackbirds  which had been surreptitiously shot, when fallen and fluttering in the  wet grass in the early morning, had shed life-drops of that same  beautiful colour.          VII      After the middle of June the common began to attract me more and more.  It was so extensive that, standing on its border, just beyond the last  straggling cottages and orchards, the further side was seen only as a  line of blue trees, indistinct in the distance. As I grew to know it  better, adding each day to my list from its varied bird life, the woods  and waterside were visited less and less frequently, and after the  bird-scaring noises began in the village, its wildness and quiet became  increasingly grateful. The silence of nature was broken only by bird  sounds, and the most frequent sound was that of the yellow bunting, as,  perched motionless on the summit of a gorse bush, his yellow head  conspicuous at a considerable distance, he emitted his thin monotonous  chant at regular intervals, like a painted toy-bird that sings by  machinery. There, too, sedentary as an owl in the daytime, the corn  bunting was common, discharging his brief song at intervals--a sound as  of shattering glass. The whinchat was rarely seen, but I constantly met  the small, prettily coloured stonechat flitting from bush to bush,  following me, and never ceasing his low, querulous tacking chirp,  anxious for the safety of his nest. Nightingales, blackcaps and  white-throats also nested there, and were louder and more emphatic in  their protests when approached. There were several grasshopper-warblers  on the common, all, very curiously as it seemed to me, clustered at one  spot, so that one could ramble over miles of ground without hearing  their singular note; but on approaching the place they inhabited one  gradually became conscious of a mysterious trilling buzz or whirr, low  at first and growing louder and more stridulous, until the hidden  singers were left behind, when by degrees it sank lower and lower again,  and ceased to be audible at a distance of about one hundred yards from  the points where it had sounded loudest. The birds hid in clumps of  furze and bramble so near together that the area covered by the buzzing  sound measured about two hundred yards across. This most singular sound  (for a warbler to make) is certainly not ventriloquial, although if one  comes to it with the sense of hearing disorganized by town noises or  unpractised, one is at a loss to determine the exact spot it comes from,  or even to know from which side it comes. While emitting its prolonged  sound the bird is so absorbed in its own performance that it is not  easily alarmed, and will sometimes continue singing with a human  listener standing within four or five yards of it. When one is near the  bird, and listens, standing motionless, the effect on the nerves of  hearing is very remarkable, considering the smallness of the sound,  which, without being unpleasant, is somewhat similar to that produced by  the vibration of the brake of a train; it is not powerful enough to jar  the nerves, but appears to pervade the entire system. Lying still, with  eyes closed, and three or four of these birds singing near, so that  their strains overlap and leave no silent intervals, the listener can  imagine that the sound originates within himself; that the numberless  fine cords of his nervous network tremble responsively to it.    There are a number of natural sounds that resemble more or less closely  the most unbirdlike note of this warbler--cicada, rattlesnake, and some  batrachians.  Some grasshoppers perhaps come nearest to it; but the most  sustained current of sound emitted by the insect is short compared to  the warbler's strain, also the vibrations are very much more rapid, and  not heard as vibrations, and the same effect is not produced.    The grasshopper warblers gave me so much pleasure that I was often at  the spot where they had their little colony of about half-a-dozen pairs,  and where I discovered they bred every year. At first I used to go to  any bush where I had caught sight of a bird and sit down within a few  yards of it and wait until the little hideling's shyness wore off, and  he would come out and start reeling. Afterwards I always went straight  to the same bush, because I thought the bird that used it as his  singing-place appeared less shy than the others. One day I spent a long  time listening to this favourite; delightedly watching him, perched on a  low twig on a level with my sight, and not more than five yards from me;  his body perfectly motionless, but the head and wide-open beak jerked  from side to side in a measured, mechanical way. I had a side view of  the bird, but every three seconds the head would be jerked towards me,  showing the bright yellow colour of the open mouth. The reeling would  last about three minutes, then the bird would unbend or unstiffen and  take a few hops about the bush, then stiffen and begin again. While thus  gazing and listening I, by chance, met with an experience of that rare  kind which invariably strikes the observer of birds as strange and  almost incredible--an example of the most perfect mimicry in a species  which has its own distinctive song and is not a mimic except once in a  while, and as it were by chance.
