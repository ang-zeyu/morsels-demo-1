Yes, here  was one of those strange anomalies peculiar to the colonies. A young  man, fresh from his University, of refined tastes and cultivated  intellect, was leading here the life of a boor, without companionship  or appreciation of any sort. His \"mate\" seemed to be a rough West  countryman, honest and well meaning enough, but utterly unsuited to Mr.  K----. It was the old story, of wild unpractical ideas hastily carried  out. Mr. K---- had arrived in New Zealand a couple of years before, with  all his worldly wealth,--1,000 pounds. Finding this would not go very  far in the purchase of a good sheep-run, and hearing some calculations  about the profit to be derived from breeding cattle, based upon  somebody's lucky speculation, he eagerly caught at one of the many  offers showered upon unfortunate \"new chums,\" and bought the worst and  bleakest bit of one of the worst and bleakest runs in the province. The  remainder of his money was laid out in purchasing stock; and now he had  sat down patiently to await, in his little hut, until such time as his  brilliant expectations would be realized. I may say here they became  fainter and fainter year by year, and at last faded away altogether;  leaving him at the end of three lonely, dreadful years with exactly half  his capital, but double his experience. However this has nothing to do  with my story, except that I can never think of our skating expedition  to that lonely lake, far back among those terrible hills, without a  thrill of compassion for the only living human being, who dwelt among  them.    It was too cold to dawdle about, however, that day. The frost lay white  and hard upon the ground, and we felt that we were cruel in leaving our  poor horses standing to get chilled whilst we amused ourselves. Although  my beloved Helen was not there, having been exchanged for the day in  favour of Master Mouse, a shaggy pony, whose paces were as rough as  its coat, I begged a red blanket from Mr. K----, and covered up Helen's  stable companion, whose sleek skin spoke of a milder temperature than  that on Lake Ida's \"gloomy shore.\" Our simple arrangements were  soon made. Mr. K---- left directions to his mate to prepare a repast  consisting of tea, bread, and mutton for us, and, each carrying our  skates, we made the best of our way across the frozen tussocks to the  lake. Mr. K---- proved an admirable guide over its surface, for he was  in the habit during the winter of getting all his firewood out of the  opposite \"bush,\" and bringing it across the lake on sledges drawn by  bullocks. We accused him of having cut up our ice dreadfully by these  means; but he took us to a part of the vast expanse where an unbroken  field of at least ten acres of ice stretched smoothly before us. Here  were no boards marked \"DANGEROUS,\" nor any intimation of the depth of  water beneath. The most timid person could feel no apprehension on ice  which seemed more solid than the earth; so accordingly in a few moments  we had buckled and strapped on our skates, and were skimming and  gliding--and I must add, falling--in all directions. We were very much  out of practice at first, except Mr. K----, who skated every day, taking  short cuts across the lake to track a stray heifer or explore a blind  gully.    I despair of making my readers see the scene as I saw it, or of  conveying any adequate idea of the intense, the appalling loneliness of  the spot. It really seemed to me as if our voices and laughter, so  far from breaking the deep eternal silence, only brought it out into  stronger relief. On either hand rose up, shear from the waters edge, a  great, barren, shingly mountain; before us loomed a dark pine forest,  whose black shadows crept up until they merged in the deep _crevasses_  and fissures of the Snowy Range. Behind us stretched the winding gullies  by which we had climbed to this mountain tarn, and Mr. K----'s little  hut and scrap of a garden and paddock gave the one touch of life, or  possibility of life, to this desolate region. In spite of all scenic  wet blankets we tried hard to be gay, and no one but myself would  acknowledge that we found the lonely grandeur of our \"rink\" too much for  us. We skated away perseveringly until we were both tired and hungry,  when we returned to Mr. K----'s hut, took a hasty meal, and mounted our  chilled steeds. Mr. C. H---- insisted on bringing poor Mr. K---- back  with us, though he was somewhat reluctant to come, alleging that a  few days spent in the society of his kind made the solitude of his  weather-board hut all the more dreary. The next day and yet the next  we returned to our gloomy skating ground, and when I turned round in my  saddle as we rode away on Friday evening, for a last look at Lake Ida  lying behind us in her winter black numbness, her aspect seemed more  forbidding than ever, for only the bare steep hill-sides could be seen;  the pine forest and white distant mountains were all blotted and blurred  out of sight by a heavy pall of cloud creeping slowly up.    \"Let us ride fast,\" cried Mr. K----, \"or we shall have a sou'-wester  upon us;\" so we galloped home as quickly as we could, over ground that  I don't really believe I could summon courage to walk across, ever so  slowly, to-day,--but then one's nerves and courage are in very different  order out in New Zealand to the low standard which rules for ladies in  England, who \"live at home in ease!\" Long before we reached home the  storm was pelting us: my little jacket was like a white board when I  took it off, for the sleet and snow had frozen as it fell. I was wet  to the skin, and so numb with cold I could hardly stand when we reached  home at last in the dark and down-pour. I could only get my things very  imperfectly dried, and had to manage as best I could, but yet no one  even thought of making the inquiry next morning when I came out to  breakfast, \"Have you caught cold?\" It would have seemed a ridiculous  question.        Chapter V: Toboggon-ing.    I cannot resist the temptation to touch upon one of the winter  amusements which came to us two years later. Yet the word \"amusement\"  seems out of place, no one in the Province having much heart to amuse  themselves, for the great snow storm of August, 1867, had just taken  place, and we were in the first days of bewilderment at the calamity  which had befallen us all. A week's incessant snow-fall, accompanied by  a fierce and freezing south-west wind, had not only covered the whole of  the mountains from base to brow with shining white, through which not  a single dark rock jutted, but had drifted on the plains for many feet  deep. Gullies had been filled up by the soft, driving flakes, creeks  were bridged over, and for three weeks and more all communication  between the stations and the various townships was cut off. The  full extent of our losses was unknown to us, and dreary as were our  forebodings of misfortune, none of us guessed that snow to be the  winding sheet of half a million of sheep. The magnificent semi-circle of  the Southern Alps stood out, for a hundred miles from north to south,  in appalling white distinctness, and no one in the whole Colony had ever  seen the splendid range thus free from fleck or flaw. We had done all  we could within working distance, but what was, the use of digging in  drifts thirty feet deep? Amidst, and almost above, the terrible anxiety  about our own individual safety,--for the snow was over the roof of  many of the station-houses,--came the pressing question, \"Where are the  sheep?\" A profound silence unbroken by bleat of lamb, or bark of dog,  or any sound of life, had reigned for many days, when a merciful  north-westerly gale sprung, up, and releasing the heavily-laden earth  from its white bondage, freed the miserable remnant of our flocks and  herds. At least, I should say, it freed those sheep which had travelled  down to the vallies, driven before the first pitiless gusts, but we  knew that many hundreds, if not thousands, of wethers must have been  surprised and imprisoned far back among the hills.    Such knowledge could not be acted upon, however, for no human being  could hope to plunge through the drifts around us. Old shepherds who  had lived on the run for fifteen years, confessed that they did not know  their way fifty yards from the homestead. The vallies were filled up,  so that one gully looked precisely like its fellow; rocks, scrub, Ti-ti  palms, all our local land-marks had disappeared; not a fence or gate  could be seen in all the country side. Here and there a long wave-like  line in the smooth mass would lead us to suppose that a wire fence lay  buried beneath its curves, but we had no means of knowing for certain.  Near the house every shrub and out-building, every hay-stack or  wood-heap, had all been covered up, and no man might even guess where  they lay.    This had been the terrible state of things, and although the blessed  warm wind had removed our immediate and pressing fear of starvation, we  could not hope to employ ourselves in searching for our missing sheep  for many days to come. None of us had been able to take any exercise for  more than a fortnight, and having done all that could possibly be done  near at hand, F---- set to work to manufacture some sledges out of old  packing-cases. Quite close to the house, a hill sloped smoothly for  about 300 yards, at an angle of 40 degrees; along its side lay a  perfectly level and deep drift, which did not show any signs of  thawing for more than a month, and we resolved to use this as a natural  _Montagne Russe_. The construction of a suitable sledge was the first  difficulty to be surmounted, and many were the dismal failures and  break-neck catastrophes which preceded what we considered a safe and  successful vehicle. Not only was it immensely"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5994"],[0,"Our Nervous Friends — Illustrating the Mastery of Nervousness (#10)"],[1,"-glass.    Much of each day had been spent in bed, and hot coffee and hot-water  bottles were required to keep off the nerve-racking chills which  otherwise followed each fainting spell. Her appetite never flagged.  She had been a heavy meat eater from childhood. There never was a  Denny meal without at least two kinds of meat, and one cup of coffee  always, more frequently two--no namby-pamby Postum effects, but the  genuine \"black-drip.\" In the face of much dental work, her sweet tooth  had never been filled. She loved food, and her appetite demanded  quantity as well as quality. Of peculiar significance was the fact  that throughout the years she had never had a spell when physically  and mentally comfortable, but, as the years passed, the amount of  discomfort which could provoke a nervous disturbance became less and  less. She was a well-informed woman, quite interesting on many  subjects, outside of herself, and had done much excellent reading.  Unafflicted, she would mentally have been more than usually  interesting. When her specialist began the investigation of her moral  self, he found her impressed with the belief that she was a \"saved  woman,\" ready and only waiting health that she might take up the  Lord's work. But as he sought her soul's deeper recesses, he uncovered  a quagmire. Resentment rankled against the sister who had left her  alone to meet the exhausting burdens of their parents' illness and  brother's drinking--a sister who had taken care of herself and her own  family, regardless. Worse than resentment smoldered against the  father, a dull, deadening enmity, born in the hateful hours of his  odious, but helpless, dementia. Burning deep was an unappeased protest  that, instead of the normal life and pleasures and opportunities of  other girls, she had been chained to his objectionable presence.    Treatment was undertaken, based upon a clear conception of her moral,  mental and physical needs. Seven months of intensive right-living were  enjoined. The greatest difficulty was found in compelling restraint  from food excesses. The love for good things to eat was theoretically  shelved, but, practically, the forces of desire and habit seemed  insurmountable. Her craving for \"good eats\" now and then discouraged  her resolutions and she periodically broke over the rigid hospital  regimen. But she was helped in every phase of her living. The skin  cleared; a hint of the roses returned; twenty-five pounds of more than  useless weight melted away and weeks passed with no threat of spell or  chill. She was renewing her youth. A righteous understanding of the  lessons which her years of sacrifice held, appealed to her judgment,  if not to her feelings, and, as a new being, she returned to the  church training-school.    Most fully had Miss Denny been instructed in principle and in practice  concerning the, for her, vital lessons of nutritional right-living.  Each step of the way had been made clear, and it had proven the right  way by the test of practical demonstration. The outlined schedule of  habits, including some denials and some gratuitous activity, kept her  in prime condition--in fact, in improving condition, for six highly  satisfactory months. Never had she accomplished so much; never did  life promise more, as the result of her own efforts. She had earned  comforts which had apparently deposed forever her old nervous enemies.  Victorious living seemed at her finger-tips. Then she sold her birth-  right.    She was feeling so well; why could she not be like other people?  Certainly once in a while she could have the things she \"loved.\" It  was only a small mess of pottage--some chops, a cup of real coffee,  some after-dinner mints. The doctor had proscribed them all, but \"Once  won't hurt.\" Her conscience did prick, but days passed; there was no  spell, no chill, no headache. \"It didn't hurt me\" was her triumphant  conclusion; and again she ventured and nothing happened--and again,  and again. Then the coffee every day and soon sweets and meats,  regardless; then coffee to keep her going. The message of the  returning fainting spells was unheeded, unless answered by  recklessness, for fear thoughts had come and old enmities and new ones  haunted in. Routine and regimen had gone weeks before, and now a  vacation had to be. She did not return to her work, but deluded  herself with a series of pretenses. Before the year was gone, the imps  of morbid toxins came into their own and she resorted to wines, later  to alcohol in stronger forms--and alcohol usually makes short work of  the fineness God gives woman.    We leave Clara Denny at forty, leave her on the road of license which  leads to ever-lowering levels.          CHAPTER VII    THE CRIME OF INACTIVITY      A half-century ago the Stoneleighs moved West and located in Hot  Springs. The wife had recently fallen heir to a few thousand dollars,  which, with unusual foresight, were invested in suburban property. Mr.  Stoneleigh was a large man, one generation removed from England,  active, and noticeably of a nervous type. He was industrious,  practically economical, single-minded; these qualities stood him in  the stead of shrewdness. From their small start he became rapidly  wealthy as a dealer in real estate. Mr. Stoneleigh was a generous  eater; his foods were truly simple in variety but luxurious in their  quality and richness. Prime roast-beef, fried potatoes, waffles and  griddle-cakes supplied him with heat, energy and avoirdupois. He  suddenly quit eating at fifty-eight--there was a cerebral hemorrhage  one night. His remains weighed one hundred and ninety-five.    The wife was a comfortable mixture of Irish and English. Her people  were so thrifty that she had but a common-school education. She was  the only child, her industrious mother let her go the way of least  resistance, and were we tracing responsibility of the criminality  behind our tragedy, Mrs. Stoneleigh's mother would probably be cited  as the guilty one. The way of least resistance is usually pretty easy-  going, and keeps within the valley of indulgence. Therefore, Mrs.  Stoneleigh worked none, was a true helpmate to her husband, at the  table, and like him, grew fat, and from mid-life waddled on, with her  hundred and eighty pounds. She was superstitiously very religious,  with the kind of religion that shudders at the thought of missing  Sunday morning service or failing to be a passive attendant at the  regular meetings of the Church Aid Society. Practically, the heathen  were taught American civilization, and she herself was assured  sumptuous reservations in Glory by generous donations to the various  missionary societies.    The only real ordeal which this woman ever faced was the birth of  Henry, her first child; she was very ill and suffered severely. The  mother instinct centered upon this boy the fulness of her devotion--a  devotion which never swerved nor faltered, a devotion which never  questioned, a devotion which became a self-forgetting servility. John  arrived almost unnoticed three years later, foreordained to be this  older brother's henchman as long as he remained at home. John  developed. Education was not featured in the Stoneleighs' program, so  John stopped after his first year at high school, but he was  energetic, and through serving Henry had learned to work. At twenty he  married, left the family roof, and starting life for himself in a  nearby metropolis became a successful coal-merchant.    Little Henry Stoneleigh would have thrilled any mother's heart with  pride. He had every quality a perfect baby should have, and grew into  a large handsome boy, healthy and strong; his disposition was the envy  of neighboring mothers; nor was it the sweet goodness of inertia, for  he was mentally and emotionally quick and responsive above the  average. Indulged by his mother from the beginning and always  preferred to his brother, he never recognized duty as duty. This young  life was innocent of anything which suggested routine; order for him  was a happen-so or an of-course result of his mother's or John's  efforts; the details necessary for neatness were never allowed to  ruffle his ease nor to interfere with his impulses. The Stoneleighs'  home was a generous pile, locally magnificent, but our young scion's  fine, front room was perennially a clutter. From his birth up, Henry  was never taught the rudiments of responsibility. His boyhood,  however, was not unattractive. He had inherited a large measure of  vitality and was protected from disappointments or irritations by the  many comforts which a mother's devotion and wealth can arrange and  provide. His memory was superior. The boy inherited not only an  exceptional physique, but mental ability which made his early studies  too easy to suggest any objection on his part. In fact, he was  actively interested in much of his school work and did well without  the conscious expenditure of energy. Little discrimination was shown  in the arrangements for his higher education; still he arrived at a  popular Western Boy's Academy, rather dubious in his own mind as to  just how large a place he would hold in the sun, with mother and John  back home. Rather rudely assailed were some of his easy-going habits,  and considerable ridicule from certain sources rapidly decided his  choice of companions. It was young Stoneleigh's misfortune that at  this epoch in his development he was situated where money could buy  immunities and attract apparent friendships. He was of fine  appearance, and should by all rights have made center on the Academy  football team, being the largest, heaviest, strongest boy in school.  But one day in football togs is the sum of his football history.  Academy days went in good feeds, the popularity purchased by his  freedom of purse and easy-going good fellowship, and much reading,  which he always enjoyed and which, with his good memory, made him  unusually well-informed."]]]
