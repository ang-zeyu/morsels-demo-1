That dread disease, diphtheria, had stolen the older brother and  laughing little sisters in one short week's time, so that now, as the sad  anniversary came near to hand, Mrs. Ellis' heart ached for her lost  birdlings and yearned more jealously than ever over her remaining little  one. Today his usually merry face was very grave and he looked very  thoughtful as he gave his mother her kiss and allowed himself to be drawn  upon her lap.    \"What ails mother's Pet? Is he sick?\" she asked anxiously.    \"No, Mother dear, I'm not sick, but I feel so sad at heart. You see,\"  he continued in answer to her questioning look, \"Robbie Goodman and I  always walk together going and coming from school, and I have noticed  that he has never worn any overcoat this winter, but you know its been  unusually warm and I thought perhaps his mother did not make him wrap  up like you did me, but this morning it was so cold and he was just  shivering, but he never had on any overcoat--just his mittens and muffler  and cap were his wraps. Of course I noticed it, for nearly everyone else  was all bundled up; but I didn't say anything as I did not want to be  impolite. After awhile he said, 'My, I am so cold,' and I said: 'Where's  your overcoat?' Then he told me it was too small and his papa can't buy  him any this winter so he is afraid he will have to stop school. His  mama says she would cut his papa's up for him, only then he would not  have any; and of course he must have one to wear when he goes to the  chapel and to see sick people. Even that one is thin and patched. He  says he and his little sisters have been praying so hard for an overcoat  for him and shoes for them, but they did not come at Christmas like they  thought they would, and they are real discouraged.    \"Tonight, Mother,\" continued Walter, \"he had an awful cold and coughed  just like our Harry did last year,\" and the long pent up tears flowed  from the child's eyes. As mother and son dried their tears, the child  looked up with perfect confidence as he said, \"The Lord will answer  Robbie's prayer, won't he. Mama?\"    [Illustration]    \"Yes darling,\" said Mrs. Ellis; and sent the child off to the play room.      \"By the way, my dear,\" remarked Mrs. Ellis as they sat chatting at the  tea-table after Walter had retired, \"what has become of that preacher  Goodman who preached for us once on trial?\"    \"Oh, he has a mission down on the other side of the city, but he lives  on this side as Moore gives him the house rent free. I met him the other  day. He looked very needy. The man had wonderful talents and might have  a rich congregation and improve himself; but he is persistent in his  ideas concerning this holiness movement, and of course a large church  like ours wants something to attract and interest instead of such  egotistical discourses. I, for one, go to sleep under them.\" And Mr.  Ellis drew himself up with a pompous air as he went into the library,  whither his wife presently followed.    He had picked up a newspaper and was apparently absorbed, but Mrs. Ellis  had not had her say, so she continued \"Walter was telling me about the  little boy. He--\"    \"Oh, yes,\" interrupted her husband, \"he met me in the hall and poured  out the whole story. The child's nerves were all wrought up, too. He  should not be allowed to worry over such things. He wants me to give up  buying him the fur-trimmed overcoat and get a coat and shoes for Goodman's  children, as they were praying so hard for them, but I have enough to  do without clothing other people's children. If Goodman would quit his  cranky notions and use his talents for people who could understand him,  instead of preaching to those ragamuffins he might now be receiving a  magnificent salary and clothing himself and family decently.\"    \"But Paul,\" said Mrs. Ellis, \"Surely you would not have Mr. Goodman  sacrifice his convictions simply for money and praise, when you yourself,  are convinced that his doctrines are sound? Besides he must be doing a  good work down among the poor classes of the city as it appears the rich  don't want him.\"    \"Then let the poor give enough to keep him.\"    \"They do give far beyond their means but the Lord calls on such as us  to give. I know it has been an unusually hard year but the Lord has  blessed us and He will hold us to an account. I feel very sad as the  anniversary of our darlings' departure draws near and I dread to think  of any little ones suffering while we could so easily help them.\"    \"I don't see how you can feel that we have been so blessed. When the  house is so quiet and I think of those white graves in the cemetery I  confess I feel very bitter.\"    \"Paul, my dear husband, don't feel that way. Just think of our three  treasures in heaven, an added claim to that glorious realm, away from  this cold and suffering. Remember also that we have one left, to live  for, to train. And, Paul, let us train him for the Master and in such a  way that we may never have the feeling that it were better if he, too,  had departed when he was pure and innocent. Let us encourage benevolence  and gentleness and if he wishes to go without the fur-trimmed coat, why  not do as he asks?\" Mrs. Ellis kissed her husband and quietly left the  room.    Long and late, Paul Ellis sat there and many things, ghosts of the past,  rose before him. As the midnight chimes rang out he knelt and prayed.  \"Oh, Lord, forgive me. I have gone astray and turned to my own way. I  have been prejudiced. It was my influence which turned the tide against  Robert Goodman. Thou knowest. Now, if Thou wilt only forgive and help  me I will walk in the light as Thou sendest it, even consenting to be  called a 'holiness crank.'\"    [Illustration: ]    A few days afterward Robert Goodman received a large package from an  unknown friend containing a warm overcoat and three pairs of shoes. His  father also received a present. It came through the mail and was an  honest confession of a wrong done him, also a check for one hundred  dollars. One year later this church gave a unanimous call to Brother  Goodman and the revival which broke out that winter was unprecedented  in the annals of that church. Verily, \"A little child shall lead them.\"      --Luella Watson Kinder, in _Christian Witness_        CARLETTA AND THE MERCHANT    \"If I could only have your faith, gladly would I--but I was born a  skeptic. I cannot look upon God and the future as _you_ do.\"    So said John Harvey as he walked with a friend under a dripping umbrella.  John Harvey was a skeptic of thirty years standing and apparently hardened  in his unbelief. Everybody had given him up as hopeless. Reasoning ever  so calmly made no impression on the rocky soil of his heart. Alas! it  was sad, very sad!    But one friend had never given him up. When spoken to about him--  \"I will talk with and pray for that man until I die,\" he said; \"and I  will have faith that he may yet come out of darkness into the marvelous  light.\"    And thus whenever he met him (John Harvey was always ready for a \"talk,\")  Mr. Hawkins pressed home the truth. In answer, on that stormy night, he  said: \"God can change a skeptic, John. He has more power over your heart  than you, and I mean still to pray for you.\"    \"Oh, I have no objections, none in the world--seeing is believing, you  know. I'm ready for any miracle; but I tell you it would take nothing  short of a miracle to convince me. Let's change the subject. I'm hungry  and it's too far to go up town to supper on this stormy night. Here's a  restaurant: let us stop here.\"    How warm and pleasant it looked in the long, brilliant dining saloon!    The two merchants had eaten, and were just on the point of rising when  a strain of soft music came through the open door--a child's sweet voice.    \"'Pon my word, that is pretty,\" said John Harvey; \"what purity in those  tones!\"    \"Out of here, you little baggage!\" cried a hoarse voice, and one of the  waiters pointed angrily to the door.    \"Let her come in,\" said John Harvey.    \"We don't allow them in this place, sir,\" said the waiter, \"but she can  go into the reading-room.\"    \"Well, let her go somewhere. I want to hear her,\" responded the gentleman.    All this time the two had seen the shadow of something hovering backwards  and forwards on the edge of the door; now they followed a slight little  figure, wrapped in a patched cloak, patched hood, and leaving the mark  of wet feet as she walked. Curious to see her face--she was very  small--John Harvey lured her to the farthest part of the great room where  there were but few gentlemen, and then motioned her to sing. The little  one looked timidly up. Her cheek was of olive darkness, but a flush  rested there, and out of the thinnest face, under the arch of broad  temples, deepened by masses of the blackest hair looked two eyes whose  softness and tender pleading would have touched the hardest heart.    \"That little thing is sick, I believe,\" said John Harvey, compassionately.  \"What do you sing, child?\" he added.    \"I sing Italian or a little English.\"    John Harvey looked at her shoes. \"Why,\" he exclaimed, and his lips  quivered, \"her feet are wet to her ankles; she will catch her death of  cold.\"    By this time the child had begun to sing, pushing back her hood, and  folding before her her little thin fingers. Her voice was wonderful; and  simple and common as were both air and words, the pathos of the tones  drew together several of the merchants in the reading-room. The little  song commenced thus:      \"There is a happy land,    Far, far away.\"    Never could the voice, the manner, of that child be forgotten. There  almost seemed a halo around her head; and when she had finished, her  great speaking eyes turned toward John Harvey.    \"Look here, child; where did you learn that song?\" he asked.    \"At the Sunday School, Sir.\"    \"And you"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7028"],[0,"The Clicking of Cuthbert (#10)"],[1,"ght_. Fore!\"    I watched him curiously. I never put a club into the hand of a beginner  without something of the feeling of the sculptor who surveys a mass of  shapeless clay. I experience the emotions of a creator. Here, I say to  myself, is a semi-sentient being into whose soulless carcass I am  breathing life. A moment before, he was, though technically living, a  mere clod. A moment hence he will be a golfer.    While I was still occupied with these meditations Mortimer swung at the  ball. The club, whizzing down, brushed the surface of the rubber  sphere, toppling it off the tee and propelling it six inches with a  slight slice on it.    \"Damnation!\" said Mortimer, unravelling himself.    I nodded approvingly. His drive had not been anything to write to the  golfing journals about, but he was picking up the technique of the  game.    \"What happened then?\"    I told him in a word.    \"Your stance was wrong, and your grip was wrong, and you moved your  head, and swayed your body, and took your eye off the ball, and  pressed, and forgot to use your wrists, and swung back too fast, and  let the hands get ahead of the club, and lost your balance, and omitted  to pivot on the ball of the left foot, and bent your right knee.\"    He was silent for a moment.    \"There is more in this pastime,\" he said, \"than the casual observer  would suspect.\"    I have noticed, and I suppose other people have noticed, that in the  golf education of every man there is a definite point at which he may  be said to have crossed the dividing line--the Rubicon, as it  were--that separates the golfer from the non-golfer. This moment comes  immediately after his first good drive. In the ninety minutes in which  I instructed Mortimer Sturgis that morning in the rudiments of the  game, he made every variety of drive known to science; but it was not  till we were about to leave that he made a good one.    A moment before he had surveyed his blistered hands with sombre  disgust.    \"It's no good,\" he said. \"I shall never learn this beast of a game. And  I don't want to either. It's only fit for lunatics. Where's the sense  in it? Hitting a rotten little ball with a stick! If I want exercise,  I'll take a stick and go and rattle it along the railings. There's  something _in_ that! Well, let's be getting along. No good wasting  the whole morning out here.\"    \"Try one more drive, and then we'll go.\"    \"All right. If you like. No sense in it, though.\"    He teed up the ball, took a careless stance, and flicked moodily. There  was a sharp crack, the ball shot off the tee, flew a hundred yards in a  dead straight line never ten feet above the ground, soared another  seventy yards in a graceful arc, struck the turf, rolled, and came to  rest within easy mashie distance of the green.    \"Splendid!\" I cried.    The man seemed stunned.    \"How did that happen?\"    I told him very simply.    \"Your stance was right, and your grip was right, and you kept your head  still, and didn't sway your body, and never took your eye off the ball,  and slowed back, and let the arms come well through, and rolled the  wrists, and let the club-head lead, and kept your balance, and pivoted  on the ball of the left foot, and didn't duck the right knee.\"    \"I see,\" he said. \"Yes, I thought that must be it.\"    \"Now let's go home.\"    \"Wait a minute. I just want to remember what I did while it's fresh in  my mind. Let me see, this was the way I stood. Or was it more like  this? No, like this.\" He turned to me, beaming. \"What a great idea it  was, my taking up golf! It's all nonsense what you read in the comic  papers about people foozling all over the place and breaking clubs and  all that. You've only to exercise a little reasonable care. And what a  corking game it is! Nothing like it in the world! I wonder if Betty is  up yet. I must go round and show her how I did that drive. A perfect  swing, with every ounce of weight, wrist, and muscle behind it. I meant  to keep it a secret from the dear girl till I had really learned, but  of course I _have_ learned now. Let's go round and rout her out.\"    He had given me my cue. I put my hand on his shoulder and spoke  sorrowfully.    \"Mortimer, my boy, I fear I have bad news for you.\"    \"Slow; back--keep the head---- What's that? Bad news?\"    \"About Betty.\"    \"About Betty? What about her? Don't sway the body--keep the eye on  the----\"    \"Prepare yourself for a shock, my boy. Yesterday afternoon Betty called  to see me. When she had gone I found that she had stolen my silver  matchbox.\"    \"Stolen your matchbox?\"    \"Stolen my matchbox.\"    \"Oh, well, I dare say there were faults on both sides,\" said Mortimer.  \"Tell me if I sway my body this time.\"    \"You don't grasp what I have said! Do you realize that Betty, the girl  you are going to marry, is a kleptomaniac?\"    \"A kleptomaniac!\"    \"That is the only possible explanation. Think what this means, my boy.  Think how you will feel every time your wife says she is going out to  do a little shopping! Think of yourself, left alone at home, watching  the clock, saying to yourself, 'Now she is lifting a pair of silk  stockings!' 'Now she is hiding gloves in her umbrella!' 'Just about  this moment she is getting away with a pearl necklace!'\"    \"Would she do that?\"    \"She would! She could not help herself. Or, rather, she could not  refrain from helping herself. How about it, my boy?\"    \"It only draws us closer together,\" he said.    I was touched, I own. My scheme had failed, but it had proved Mortimer  Sturgis to be of pure gold. He stood gazing down the fairway, wrapped  in thought.    \"By the way,\" he said, meditatively, \"I wonder if the dear girl ever  goes to any of those sales--those auction-sales, you know, where you're  allowed to inspect the things the day before? They often have some  pretty decent vases.\"    He broke off and fell into a reverie.           *       *       *       *       *    From this point onward Mortimer Sturgis proved the truth of what I said  to you about the perils of taking up golf at an advanced age. A  lifetime of observing my fellow-creatures has convinced me that Nature  intended us all to be golfers. In every human being the germ of golf is  implanted at birth, and suppression causes it to grow and grow till--it  may be at forty, fifty, sixty--it suddenly bursts its bonds and sweeps  over the victim like a tidal wave. The wise man, who begins to play in  childhood, is enabled to let the poison exude gradually from his  system, with no harmful results. But a man like Mortimer Sturgis, with  thirty-eight golfless years behind him, is swept off his feet. He is  carried away. He loses all sense of proportion. He is like the fly that  happens to be sitting on the wall of the dam just when the crack comes.    Mortimer Sturgis gave himself up without a struggle to an orgy of golf  such as I have never witnessed in any man. Within two days of that  first lesson he had accumulated a collection of clubs large enough to  have enabled him to open a shop; and he went on buying them at the rate  of two and three a day. On Sundays, when it was impossible to buy  clubs, he was like a lost spirit. True, he would do his regular four  rounds on the day of rest, but he never felt happy. The thought, as he  sliced into the rough, that the patent wooden-faced cleek which he  intended to purchase next morning might have made all the difference,  completely spoiled his enjoyment.    I remember him calling me up on the telephone at three o'clock one  morning to tell me that he had solved the problem of putting. He  intended in future, he said, to use a croquet mallet, and he wondered  that no one had ever thought of it before. The sound of his broken  groan when I informed him that croquet mallets were against the rules  haunted me for days.    His golf library kept pace with his collection of clubs. He bought all  the standard works, subscribed to all the golfing papers, and, when he  came across a paragraph in a magazine to the effect that Mr. Hutchings,  an ex-amateur champion, did not begin to play till he was past forty,  and that his opponent in the final, Mr. S. H. Fry, had never held a club  till his thirty-fifth year, he had it engraved on vellum and framed and  hung up beside his shaving-mirror.           *       *       *       *       *    And Betty, meanwhile? She, poor child, stared down the years into a  bleak future, in which she saw herself parted for ever from the man she  loved, and the golf-widow of another for whom--even when he won a medal  for lowest net at a weekly handicap with a score of a hundred and three  minus twenty-four--she could feel nothing warmer than respect. Those  were dreary days for Betty. We three--she and I and Eddie Denton--often  talked over Mortimer's strange obsession. Denton said that, except that  Mortimer had not come out in pink spots, his symptoms were almost  identical with those of the dreaded _mongo-mongo_, the scourge of  the West African hinterland. Poor Denton! He had already booked his  passage for Africa, and spent hours looking in the atlas for good  deserts.    In every fever of human affairs there comes at last the crisis. We may  emerge from it healed or we may plunge into still deeper depths of  soul-sickness; but always the crisis comes. I was privileged to be  present when it came in the affairs of Mortimer Sturgis and Betty  Weston.    I had gone into the club-house one afternoon at an hour when it is  usually empty, and the first thing I saw, as I entered the main room,  which looks out on the ninth green, was Mortimer. He was grovelling on  the floor, and I confess that, when I caught sight of him, my heart  stood still. I feared that his reason, sapped by dissipation, had given  way. I knew that for weeks, day in and day out, the niblick had hardly  ever been out of his hand, and no constitution can stand that.    He looked up as he heard my footstep.    \"Hallo,\" he said. \"Can you see "]]]
