While each rider was supposed to average seventy-five miles a trip,  riding from three to seven horses, accidents were likely to occur, and  it was not uncommon for a man to lose his way. Such delays meant serious  trouble in keeping the schedule, keyed up, as it was, to the highest  possible speed. It was confronting such emergencies, and in performing  the duties of comrades who had been killed or disabled while awaiting  their turns to ride, that the most exciting episodes took place.    Among the more famous riders[23] was Jim Moore who later became a  ranchman in the South Platte Valley, Nebraska. Moore made his greatest  ride on June 8, 1860. He happened to be at Midway Station, half way  between the Missouri River and Denver, when the west-bound messenger  arrived with important Government dispatches to California. Moore \"took  up the run,\" riding continuously one hundred and forty miles to old  Julesburg, the end of his division. Here he met the eastbound messenger,  also with important missives, from the Coast to Washington. By all the  rules of the game Moore should have rested a few hours at this point,  but his successor, who would have picked up the pouch and started  eastward, had been killed the day before. The mail must go, and the  schedule must be sustained. Without asking any favors of the man who had  just arrived from the West, Moore resumed the saddle, after a delay of  only ten minutes, without even stopping to eat, and was soon pounding  eastward on his return trip. He made it, too, in spite of lurking  Indians, hunger and fatigue, covering the round trip of two hundred and  eighty miles in fourteen hours and forty-six minutes an average speed of  over eighteen miles an hour. Furthermore, his west-bound mail had gone  through from St. Joseph to Sacramento on a record-making run of eight  days and nine hours.    William James, always called \"Bill\" James, was a native of Virginia. He  had crossed the plains with his parents in a wagon train when only five  years old. At eighteen, he was one of the best Pony Express riders in  the service. James's route lay between Simpson's Park and Cole Springs,  Nevada, in the Smoky Valley range of mountains. He rode only sixty miles  each way but covered his round trip of one hundred and twenty miles in  twelve hours, including all stops. He always rode California mustangs,  using five of these animals each way. His route crossed the summits of  two mountain ridges, lay through the Shoshone Indian country, and was  one of the loneliest and most dangerous divisions on the line. Yet  \"Bill\" never took time to think about danger, nor did he ever have any  serious trouble.    Theodore Rand rode the Pony Express during the entire period of its  organization. His run was from Box Elder to Julesburg, one hundred and  ten miles and he made the entire distance both ways by night. His  schedule, night run though it was, required a gait of ten miles an hour,  but Rand often made it at an average of twelve, thus saving time on the  through schedule for some unfortunate rider who might have trouble and  delay. Originally, Rand used only four or five horses each way, but this  number, in keeping with the revised policy of the Company, was afterward  doubled, an extra mount being furnished him every twelve or fifteen  miles.    Johnnie Frey who has already been mentioned as the first rider out of  St. Joseph, was little more than a boy when he entered the pony service.  He was a native Missourian, weighing less than one hundred and  twenty-five pounds. Though small in stature, he was every inch a man.  Frey's division ran from St. Joseph to Seneca, Kansas, eighty miles,  which he covered at an average of twelve and one half miles an hour,  including all stops. When the war started, Frey enlisted in the Union  army under General Blunt. His short but worthy career was cut short in  1863 when he fell in a hand-to-hand fight with rebel bushwhackers in  Arkansas. In this, his last fight, Frey is said to have killed five of  his assailants before being struck down.    Jim Beatley, whose real name was Foote, was another Virginian, about  twenty-five years of age. He rode on an eastern division, usually west  out of Seneca. On one occasion, he traveled from Seneca to Big Sandy,  fifty miles and back, doubling his route twice in one week. Beatley was  killed by a stage hand in a personal quarrel, the affair taking place on  a ranch in Southern Nebraska in 1862.    William Boulton was one of the older riders in the service; his age at  that time is given at about thirty-five. Boulton rode for about three  months with Beatley[24]. On one occasion, while running between Seneca  and Guittards', Boulton's horse gave out when five miles from the latter  station. Without a moment's delay, he removed his letter pouch and  hurried the mail in on foot, where a fresh horse was at once provided  and the schedule resumed.    Melville Baughn, usually known as \"Mel,\" had a pony run between Fort  Kearney and Thirty-two-mile Creek. Once while \"laying off\" between  trips, a thief made off with his favorite horse. Scarcely had the  miscreant gotten away when Baughn discovered the loss. Hastily saddling  another steed, \"Mel\" gave pursuit, and though handicapped, because the  outlaw had the pick of the stable, Baughn's superior horsemanship, even  on an inferior mount, soon told. After a chase of several miles, he  forced the fellow so hard that he abandoned the stolen animal at a place  called Loup Fork, and sneaked away. Recovering the horse, Baughn then  returned to his station, found a mail awaiting him, and was off on his  run without further delay. With him and his fellow employes, running  down a horse thief was but a trifling incident and an annoyance merely  because of the bother and delay which it necessitated. Baughn was  afterward hanged for murder at Seneca, but his services to the Pony  Express were above reproach.    Another Eastern Division man was Jack Keetly, who also rode from St.  Joseph to Seneca, alternating at times with Frey and Baughn. Keetley's  greatest performance, and one of the most remarkable ever achieved in  the service, was riding from Rock Creek to St. Joseph; then back to his  starting point and on to Seneca, and from Seneca once more to Rock  Creek--three hundred and forty miles without rest. He traveled continuously  for thirty-one hours, his entire run being at the rate of eleven miles  an hour. During the last five miles of his journey, he fell asleep in  the saddle and in this manner concluded his long trip.    Don C. Rising, who afterwards settled in Northern Kansas, was born in  Painted Post, Steuben County, New York, in 1844, and came West when  thirteen years of age. He rode in the pony service nearly a year, from  November, 1860, until the line was abandoned the following October, most  of his service being rendered before he was seventeen. Much of his time  was spent running eastward out of Fort Kearney until the telegraph had  reached that point and made the operation of the Express between the  fort and St. Joseph no longer necessary. On two occasions, Rising is  said to have maintained a continuous speed of twenty miles an hour while  carrying important dispatches between Big Sandy and Rock Creek.    One rider who was well known as \"Little Yank\" was a boy scarcely out of  his teens and weighing barely one hundred pounds. He rode along the  Platte River between Cottonwood Springs and old Julesburg and frequently  made one hundred miles on a single trip.    Another man named Hogan, of whom little is known, rode northwesterly out  of Julesburg across the Platte and to Mud Springs, eighty miles.    Jimmy Clark rode between various stations east of Fort Kearney, usually  between Big Sandy and Hollenburg. Sometimes his run took him as far West  as Liberty Farm on the Little Blue River.    James W. Brink, or \"Dock\" Brink as he was known to his associates, was  one of the early riders, entering the employ of the Pony Express Company  in April, 1860. While \"Dock\" made a good record as a courier, his chief  fame was gained in a fight at Rock Creek station, in which Brink and  Wild Bill[25] \"cleaned out\" the McCandless gang of outlaws, killing five  of their number.    Charles Cliff had an eighty-mile pony run when only seventeen years of  age, but, like Brink, young Cliff gained his greatest reputation as a  fighter,--in his case fighting Indians. It seems that while Cliff was  once freighting with a small train of nine wagons, it was attacked by a  party of one hundred Sioux Indians and besieged for three days until a  larger train approached and drove the redskins away. During the  conflict, Cliff received three bullets in his body and twenty-seven in  his clothing, but he soon recovered from his injuries, and was afterward  none the less valuable to the Pony Express service.    J. G. Kelley, later a citizen of Denver, was a veteran pony man. He  entered the employ of the company at the outset, and helped  Superintendent Roberts to lay out the route across Nevada. Along the  Carson River, tiresome stretches of corduroy road had to be built.  Kelley relates that in constructing this highway willow trees were cut  near the stream and the trunks cut into the desired lengths before being  laid in place. The men often had to carry these timbers in their arms  for three hundred yards, while the mosquitoes swarmed so thickly upon  their faces and hands as to make their real color and identity hard to  determine.    At the Sink of the Carson[26], a great depression of the river on its  course through the desert, Kelley assisted in building a fort for  protecting the line against Indians. Here there were no rocks nor  timber, and so the structure had to be built of adobe mud. To get this  mud to a proper consistency, the men tramped it all day with their bare  feet. The soil was soaked with alkali, and as a result,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4675"],[0,"The Sea-Witch; Or, The African Quadroon: A Story of the Slave Coast (#10)"],[1,"ety?\" he  asked, with unmistakable earnestness in his voice.    \"You have been more than kind to us, sir,\" she continued, \"you have been  preserver, protector, and friend, and it were strange if I did not feel  an interest for your welfare.\"    This she uttered so ingenuously, so frankly, that it seemed not in the  least indelicate or forward, while it thrilled the young commander's  heart.    \"Lady, since the moment you came on board, and I heard the tones of your  voice, a strange interest sprang up in my heart, an indescribable one,  and now that you express an interest in a poor wanderer's fate, you  attach to it a value that he himself has never regarded it as  possessing. But I read your suspicions, you have feared the worst--your  looks have betrayed it, and you were ready to believe that I am a--\"    \"Pirate!\" almost groaned his companion, \"You are not, pray say you are  not.\"    \"Not so bad as that, lady.\"    \"But you are then--\"    \"A slaver!\" said the young commander, turning from her and moodily  walking the deck; with a contracted brow and uneven step.          CHAPTER VIII.    THE QUADROON.      FOR several days succeeding that upon which Captain Ratlin had avowed  himself to his fair young companion to be engaged in the slave trade  upon the coast of Africa, the \"Sea Witch\" was occupied in running in  towards the land and exchanging signals with friends on shore, and then  standing off and on to watch a favorable moment for running to an  anchorage, without encountering one of the English or American cruisers  stationed on the coast. During this time the young commander and his  fair passenger found much time for conversation, and she strove with all  that power of persuasion and delicacy of tact peculiar to her sex, to  point out to the adventurous and generous-hearted commander the fearful  responsibility of the course he was pursuing.    Perhaps no other agent would have accomplished so much as she  did--indeed, no other could for a moment have gained his ear, and the  result even to herself was very apparent, very satisfactory. He, all  unconsciously yielded every argument to her, was only too ready and  willing to grant her the fullest accordance in what she asked or argued,  for though he dared not to say so, yet he felt that already he loved the  mild yet eloquent and lovely girl with a devotion that caused all other  interests to fade in importance. It was a novel idea to him to realize  that so fair and gentle a creature could entertain such sufficient  interest in him, a rough sailor, to strive and mould his conduct for  good.    On her part, it would be difficult for us to define the exact state of  feelings which actuated the beautiful girl whom we first introduced to  the reader in India. She felt an interest in the commander of the slaver  that she was afraid to acknowledge not only to her mother, but indeed to  herself. The tones of his voice came over her heart like the memory of  music that we have heard at some distant time, and in some forgotten  place; his eyes betrayed to her the love he dared not speak, and when  she did pause to consider their relation towards each other, she half  shuddered, and said to herself, \"Would to heaved this man was a poor  mechanic, anything but a slaver! How can I give my confidence to him,  and yet how can I withhold it, for he wins from me my very thoughts!\"    One evening just after sunset, Miss Huntington and her mother had been  tarrying on the quarter deck for a long while, watching the conversation  going on between the ship and the shore by means of flags, and observing  that the \"Sea Witch\" had run in closer than usual, the mother asked:    \"Shall we not land before long, Captain Ratlin? We have been in the  vicinity of the shore so long, that I begin to feel quite impatient.\"    \"To-night, madam, we shall be on shore. I cannot offer you very good  quarters at first, but you shall find conveyance to Sierra Leone  shortly, from whence you can sail for England.\"    \"We have to thank you for much kindness, sir,\" she continued,  gratefully.    \"Nay, madam, necessity and duty to my owners has rendered it imperative  for me to approach the coast cautiously, and hence a delay I could not  avoid.\"    \"You are too honest and manly a spirit, sir,\" said the mother, frankly,  \"to be engaged in such a trade. Ah, sir, why not turn your talents to a  more fitting purpose? The field of commerce is extensive, and such as  you need not look for command.\"    \"Madam, your daughter has already caused me to behold my position in a  very different light from what I did when I cleared my ship from the  last port.\"    \"I rejoice, Captain Ratlin, to hear you say so,\" was the frank rejoinder  of the mother, as she extended her hand to him, and which he pressed  respectfully.    \"She is thus frank and open with me,\" reasoned the young commander to  himself, \"because she has no reason for restraint; but were I to tell  her that I loved her child, that she was already so dear to me that I  would relinquish all things for her, that face, so friendly in its  expression now, would be suffused with disdain and scorn. No, no! such a  fate is not in store for me; a sailor should know but one mistress, and  she should be his ship. But the heart is a stubborn thing. I would not  have believed that ouch a change could come over me.\"    \"Stand by to let go the starboard bow anchor,\" he shouted, as the vessel  gradually crept shoreward with the oncoming of night, and, assumed the  position in which he desired to place her.    Her sails were gradually furled, and as she drew to her anchorage  ground, a quarter-boat a was lowered from the davits, while the chain  cable rang its loud report as it ran out at the hawser hole, and the  ship swung gradually with the set of the current, leaving her stern  towards the shore. But a few moments elapsed before Capt. Ratlin and his  two passengers, with such articles as they had brought on board, were  skimming over the short space between the ship and the shore, propelled  by a half-dozen stout rowers. It had already been explained to them that  at first it would be necessary to land them and offer them shelter at  Don Leonardo's slave factory, until a mode of conveyance could be  procured for them to reach Sierra Leone, so they were not surprised, but  placing full confidence in Captain Ratlin, were satisfied.    At the house of Don Leonardo, they were hospitably received, and found  the proprietor to be a rough Spaniard, with a dark quadroon daughter,  whose mulatto mother was dead. The household, though primitive, in many  particulars, was yet profusely supplied with every necessity, and even  many luxuries. In the rear of the house was a spacious barracoon, where  the slaves were collected and kept for shipment, and where they were  plentifully supplied with rice and vegetables, with salt meats, and the  means of doing their own cooking. All these things the new corners noted  at once, and indeed were very curious in fully understanding. There  seemed to be little restraint exercised about the place; the slaves were  looked at in the light of prisoners of war, and did not attempt escape.  They seemed to be quite indifferent themselves as to their fate, and  were very happy, with good food to eat, and a plenty of it.    One thing that both Mrs. Huntington and her daughter marked well was the  fact that Don Leonardo greeted Capt. Ratlin as one whom he had met  before, and that Maud, his daughter, also sprang forward to meet him  with unmistakable tokens of delight. On his part, both were cordially  greeted, and they spoke together like people whose time was precious and  whose business required despatch. Mrs. Huntington gathered enough from  their open and undisguised talk to learn, that as there was not a  sufficient number of negroes at the present moment on hand, that the  \"Sea Witch,\" with her light draft of water, must be run up a neighboring  river and be there moored away from the prying eyes of the cruisers on  the coast, until the proper hour should arrive for shipping her freight.  Therefore when Captain Ratlin left them, it was with a promise to return  and join them again within a few hours. He resolved to moor his vessel  under the shelter of the present favoring darkness, to which end he at  once repaired on board.    The two English ladies, both mother and daughter, found much to interest  them in Maud Leonardo. She seemed to be a strange girl, a rough diamond,  with all the tact and ready invention of her mulatto mother, and all  the fire of her Spanish father. They soon learned that this was not  Captain Ratlin's first visit to the coast, and that her father, as well  as herself, considered him the finest seaman and gentleman in the coast  trade. It was impossible not to see with what feeling Maud the Quadroon  dwelt upon the good qualities of him she referred to, declaring that he  was a father to all the people he took away in his ship, and how kind he  was to them; that he always knocked off their shackles at once and made  friends of them by real kindness.    Mrs. Huntington, to say nothing of her daughter, saw something more than  mere honest admiration in the enthusiastic girl's remarks about the  young commander, and the mother shrewdly determined to question her upon  the theme, and to weigh well her answers.    \"Captain Ratlin is very friendly to you, I suppose, Maud?\" said Mrs.  Huntington.    \"He is friendly to father, and that is the same thing,\" she replied,  simply.    \"Has he not brought you presents across the ocean?\" continued the  mother.    \"One,\" said Maud, with evident pleasure, rolling back a long sleeve, and  discovering to her new-made friends a rich golden bracelet, set with  pearls, a rare and beautiful ornament.    \"This is indeed beautiful,\" said the mother.    Mrs. Huntington examined the jewel, while her daughter turned  thoughtfully away! She could not be mistaken; she saw at once that"]]]
