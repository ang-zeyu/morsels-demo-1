One day--oh joy!--there  were a quantity of overgrown  lettuces, which had \"shot\" into  flower.      The Flopsy Bunnies simply stuffed  themselves with lettuces. By degrees,  one after another, they were overcome  with slumber, and lay down in the  mown grass.    Benjamin was not so much  overcome as his children. Before  going to sleep he was sufficiently  wide awake to put a paper bag  over his head to keep off the flies.    The little Flopsy Bunnies slept  delightfully in the warm sun.  From the lawn beyond the garden  came the distant clacketty sound  of the mowing machine. The blue-  bottles buzzed about the wall,  and a little old mouse picked over  the rubbish among the jam pots.    (I can tell you her name, she  was called Thomasina Tittle-  mouse, a woodmouse with a long  tail.)      She rustled across the paper  bag, and awakened Benjamin  Bunny.    The mouse apologized profusely,  and said that she knew  Peter Rabbit.    While she and Benjamin were  talking, close under the wall, they  heard a heavy tread above their  heads; and suddenly Mr. McGregor  emptied out a sackful of  lawn mowings right upon the top  of the sleeping Flopsy Bunnies!  Benjamin shrank down under his  paper bag. The mouse hid in a  jam pot.      The little rabbits smiled sweetly  in their sleep under the shower of  grass; they did not awake because  the lettuces had been so soporific.    They dreamt that their mother  Flopsy was tucking them up in a  hay bed.    Mr. McGregor looked down  after emptying his sack. He saw  some funny little brown tips of  ears sticking up through the lawn  mowings. He stared at them for  some time.    Presently a fly settled on one of  them and it moved.    Mr. McGregor climbed down on  to the rubbish heap--    \"One, two, three, four! five! six  leetle rabbits!\" said he as he  dropped them into his sack. The  Flopsy Bunnies dreamt that their  mother was turning them over in  bed. They stirred a little in their  sleep, but still they did not wake  up.      Mr. McGregor tied up the sack  and left it on the wall.    He went to put away the mowing  machine.    While he was gone, Mrs. Flopsy  Bunny (who had remained at  home) came across the field.    She looked suspiciously at the  sack and wondered where everybody  was?    Then the mouse came out of her  jam pot, and Benjamin took the  paper bag off his head, and they  told the doleful tale.    Benjamin and Flopsy were in  despair, they could not undo the  string.    But Mrs. Tittlemouse was a  resourceful person. She nibbled a  hole in the bottom corner of the  sack.      The little rabbits were pulled  out and pinched to wake them.    Their parents stuffed the empty  sack with three rotten vegetable  marrows, an old blackingbrush  and two decayed turnips.    Then they all hid under a bush  and watched for Mr. McGregor.    Mr. McGregor came back and  picked up the sack, and carried it  off.    He carried it hanging down, as  if it were rather heavy.    The Flopsy Bunnies followed at  a safe distance.      They watched him go into  his house.    And then they crept up to  the window to listen.    Mr. McGregor threw down the  sack on the stone floor in a way  that would have been extremely  painful to the Flopsy Bunnies, if  they had happened to have been  inside it.    They could hear him drag his  chair on the flags, and chuckle--    \"One, two, three, four, five, six  leetle rabbits!\" said Mr. McGregor.      \"Eh? What's that? What have  they been spoiling now?\" enquired  Mrs. McGregor.    \"One, two, three, four, five, six  leetle fat rabbits!\" repeated Mr.  McGregor, counting on his fingers  --\"one, two, three--\"    \"Don't you be silly: what do you  mean, you silly old man?\"    \"In the sack! one, two, three,  four, five, six!\" replied Mr. McGregor.    (The youngest Flopsy Bunny got  upon the windowsill.)    Mrs. McGregor took hold of the  sack and felt it. She said she could  feel six, but they must be OLD rabbits,  because they were so hard  and all different shapes.    \"Not fit to eat; but the skins will  do fine to line my old cloak.\"    \"Line your old cloak?\" shouted  Mr. McGregor--\"I shall sell them  and buy myself baccy!\"    \"Rabbit tobacco! I shall skin  them and cut off their heads.\"      Mrs. McGregor untied the  sack and put her hand inside.    When she felt the vegetables  she became very very angry.  She said that Mr. McGregor  had \"done it a purpose.\"    And Mr. McGregor was very  angry too. One of the rotten  marrows came flying through  the kitchen window, and hit  the youngest Flopsy Bunny.    It was rather hurt.      Then Benjamin and Flopsy  thought that it was time to go  home.    So Mr. McGregor did not get his  tobacco, and Mrs. McGregor did  not get her rabbit skins.    But next Christmas Thomasina  Tittlemouse got a present of  enough rabbit wool to make herself  a cloak and a hood, and a  handsome muff and a pair of  warm mittens.          THE TALE OF  MRS. TITTLEMOUSE    [Nellie's  Little Book]          Once upon a time there was  a woodmouse, and her name  was Mrs. Tittlemouse.    She lived in a bank under a hedge.    Such a funny house! There  were yards and yards of sandy  passages, leading to store-  rooms and nut cellars and  seed cellars, all amongst the  roots of the hedge.      There was a kitchen, a parlor,  a pantry, and a larder.    Also, there was Mrs. Tittle-  mouse's bedroom, where she  slept in a little box bed!    Mrs. Tittlemouse was a most  terribly tidy particular little  mouse, always sweeping and  dusting the soft sandy floors.    Sometimes a beetle lost its way  in the passages.    \"Shuh! shuh! little dirty feet!\"  said Mrs. Tittlemouse, clattering  her dustpan.      And one day a little old woman  ran up and down in a red spotty  cloak.    \"Your house is on fire, Mother  Ladybird! Fly away home to your  children!\"    Another day, a big fat spider  came in to shelter from the rain.    \"Beg pardon, is this not Miss  Muffet's?\"    \"Go away, you bold bad spider!  Leaving ends of cobweb all over  my nice clean house!\"    She bundled the spider out at a  window.    He let himself down the hedge  with a long thin bit of string.      Mrs. Tittlemouse went on her  way to a distant storeroom, to  fetch cherrystones and thistle-  down seed for dinner.    All along the passage she  sniffed, and looked at the floor.    \"I smell a smell of honey; is it  the cowslips outside, in the hedge?  I am sure I can see the marks of  little dirty feet.\"    Suddenly round a corner, she  met Babbitty Bumble--\"Zizz,  Bizz, Bizzz!\" said the bumble bee.    Mrs. Tittlemouse looked at her  severely. She wished that she had  a broom.    \"Good-day, Babbitty Bumble; I  should be glad to buy some bees-  wax. But what are you doing  down here? Why do you always  come in at a window, and say,  Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz?\" Mrs. Tittle-  mouse began to get cross.      \"Zizz, Wizz, Wizzz!\" replied  Babbitty Bumble in a peevish  squeak. She sidled down a passage,  and disappeared into a  storeroom which had been used  for acorns.    Mrs. Tittlemouse had eaten the  acorns before Christmas; the  storeroom ought to have been  empty.    But it was full of untidy dry  moss.    Mrs. Tittlemouse began to pull out the  moss. Three or four other bees put  their heads out, and buzzed fiercely.    \"I am not in the habit of letting  lodgings; this is an intrusion!\"  said Mrs. Tittlemouse.  \"I will have them turned out  --\" \"Buzz! Buzz! Buzzz!\"--\"I  wonder who would help me?\"  \"Bizz, Wizz, Wizzz!\"    --\"I will not have Mr. Jackson;  he never wipes his feet.\"      Mrs. Tittlemouse decided to  leave the bees till after dinner.    When she got back to the parlor,  she heard some one coughing  in a fat voice; and there sat Mr.  Jackson himself.    He was sitting all over a  small rocking chair, twiddling his  thumbs and smiling, with his feet  on the fender.    He lived in a drain below the  hedge, in a very dirty wet ditch.    \"How do you do, Mr. Jackson?  Deary me, you have got  very wet!\"    \"Thank you, thank you,  thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse!  I'll sit awhile and dry myself,\"  said Mr. Jackson.    He sat and smiled, and the  water dripped off his coat  tails. Mrs. Tittlemouse went  round with a mop.      He sat such a while that he had  to be asked if he would take some  dinner?    First she offered him cherry-  stones. \"Thank you, thank you,  Mrs. Tittlemouse! No teeth, no  teeth, no teeth!\" said Mr. Jackson.    He opened his mouth most  unnecessarily wide; he certainly had  not a tooth in his head.    Then she offered him thistle-  down seed--\"Tiddly, widdly,  widdly! Pouff, pouff, puff.\" said  Mr. Jackson. He blew the thistle-  down all over the room.    \"Thank you, thank you, thank  you, Mrs. Tittlemouse! Now what  I really--REALLY should like--  would be a little dish of honey!\"      \"I am afraid I have not got  any, Mr. Jackson!\" said Mrs.  Tittlemouse.    \"Tiddly, widdly, widdly,  Mrs. Tittlemouse!\" said the  smiling Mr. Jackson, \"I can SMELL it;  that is why I came to call.\"    Mr. Jackson rose ponderously  from the table, and began  to look into the cupboards.    Mrs. Tittlemouse followed him with  a dishcloth, to wipe his large  wet footmarks off the parlor floor.    When he had convinced himself  that there was no honey in the  cupboards, he began to walk  down the passage.    \"Indeed, indeed, you will stick  fast, Mr. Jackson!\"    \"Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs.  Tittlemouse!\"      First he squeezed into the pantry.    \"Tiddly, widdly, widdly? No  honey? No honey, Mrs. Tittlemouse?\"    There were three creepy-crawly  people hiding in the plate rack.  Two of them got away; but the  littlest one he caught.    Then he squeezed into the larder.  Miss Butterfly was tasting the  sugar; but she flew away out of  the window.    \"Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs.  Tittlemouse; you seem to have  plenty of visitors!\"    \"And without any invitation!\"  said Mrs. Thomasina Tittlemouse.      They went along the sandy  passage--\"Tiddly, widdly--\" \"Buzz!  Wizz!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5747"],[0,"Do and Dare — a Brave Boy's Fight for Fortune (#10)"],[1,"of seventy-five cents in postage stamps.\"    \"Very well. What inference do you draw from this?\"    \"Don't you see?\" answered Eben, in malicious triumph. \"That's where part  of the stamps went. This letter was put into the post office by Herbert  Carr this morning.\"    \"That is not true,\" said Herbert, quietly.    \"Maybe it isn't, but I guess you'll find Herbert Carr's name signed to  the letter,\" said Eben.    \"Have you seen the inside of the letter, Mr. Graham?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"Then how do you know Herbert Carr's name is signed to it?\"    \"I don't know, but I am pretty sure it is.\"    \"You think Herbert Carr wrote the letter?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"If there is no objection,\" said Melville, \"I will settle the matter by  opening it.\"    \"That's what I want you to do.\" said Eben Graham.    \"And I also,\" said Herbert.    Mr. Melville deliberately cut open one end of the envelope with a small  penknife, and drew out the folded sheet which it contained. As he did  so, a small sheet of postage stamps fell upon the floor.    \"There, do you see that?\" said Eben in triumph.    The sheet of stamps contained twenty-five three-cent stamps,  representing in value seventy-five cents.    \"Shall I read the letter, sir?\" asked Melville, of the judge.    \"If there is no objection.\"    Melville read it aloud, as follows:    \"WAYNEBORO, August 2lst. MESSRS. JONES & FITCH: I inclose seventy-five  cents in stamps, and will be glad to have you send me the articles you  advertise in the Weekly Gazette. Yours truly,    \"HERBERT CARR.\"    Herbert listened to the reading of this letter in amazement.    \"I never wrote that letter,\" he said, \"and I never heard of Jones &  Fitch before.\"    \"That's a likely story!\" sneered Eben Graham. \"I submit to Judge Slocum  that I have proved my case. I haven't found out when all the stamps  left, but I have shown where some are. One who will steal seventy-five  cents' worth of stamps will steal six dollars' worth.\"    \"I agree with you there, Mr. Graham,\" said George Melville. \"Will you be  kind enough to sit down at that table, and write to my dictation?\"    \"What should I do that for?\" asked Eben, suspiciously.    \"Never mind. Surely you can have no objection.\"    \"Well, no; I don't know as I have, though I think it's all foolishness.\"    He sat down, and a pen was handed him.    \"What shall I write?\" he asked.    \"Write 'Messrs. Jones & Fitch.'\"    \"What for?\" demanded Eben, looking discomposed.    \"That's my affair. Write.\"    Eben wrote the words, but he seemed to find some difficulty in doing so.  It was clear that he was trying to disguise his handwriting.    \"What next?\" he asked.    \"'I inclose seventy-five cents in stamps,'\" proceeded George Melville.    \"Do you want to throw suspicion on me?\" asked Eben, throwing down the  pen.    \"Keep on writing!\" said the judge.    Eben did so, but was very deliberate about it, and seemed very  particular as to how he penned his letter.    \"Very well!\" said Melville. \"Now, I wish Herbert Carr to take the pen,  and I will dictate the same letter.\"    Herbert readily took the seat just vacated by Eben, and rapidly wrote  the words dictated to him.    When he had finished his task, Mr. Melville took the two copies, and,  first examining them himself, handed them, together with the original  letter, to Justice Slocum.    \"I have only to ask your honor,\" he said, \"to compare these three notes  and decide for yourself whether the original was written by Herbert Carr  or Mr. Eben Graham, the witness against him.\"    Eben Graham looked very ill at ease, flushing and paling by turns while  the examination was going on.    \"I submit,\" he said, \"that this is a very extraordinary way of treating  a witness.\"    Justice Slocum, after a pause, said: \"I find that Mr. Eben Graham's  copy is unmistakably in the same handwriting as the original letter,  purporting to be written by Herbert Carr.\"    \"It's not so!\" faltered Eben.    \"Then,\" said George Melville, triumphantly, \"as it seems clear that my  young client is the victim of a base conspiracy, engineered by the man  who has brought this charge of dishonesty against him, I have only to  ask that he be honorably discharged.\"    \"The request is granted,\" said Justice Slocum. \"Herbert, you can go. It  is clear that you are innocent of the charge made against you.\"    \"I protest,\" began Eben Graham.    \"As for you, Mr. Graham,\" said the justice, severely, \"I have no words  to express my scorn and detestation of your conduct in deliberately  contriving a plot to ruin the reputation of an innocent boy, who has  never done you any harm. Should Herbert Carr desire it, he is at liberty  to sue you for having him arrested on a false charge trumped up by  yourself.\"    Eben began to look frightened.    \"I do not wish to punish Mr. Graham,\" said Herbert. \"It is enough for me  that my honesty has been vindicated.\"    \"Go, then,\" said the justice to Eben. \"It is fortunate for you that this  boy is so forbearing.\"    Eben Graham slunk out of the justice's office, looking meaner and more  contemptible than ever, while Herbert was surrounded by his friends, who  congratulated him upon the happy issue of the trial.          CHAPTER XIII. EBEN'S LAST HOPE FAILS.        Ebenezer Graham had taken no stock in his son's charge against Herbert.  He was not prejudiced in favor of Herbert, nor did he feel particularly  friendly to him, but he was a man of shrewdness and common sense, and he  knew that Herbert was not a fool. When Eben made known to him the fact  that the stamps and money were missing, he said keenly: \"What has become  of 'em?\"    \"I don't know,\" answered Eben, \"but I can guess well enough.\"    \"Guess, then,\" said his father, shortly.    \"You know Herbert Carr took my place last evening?\"    \"Well?\"    \"There's no doubt that he took the stamps and money.\"    \"That isn't very likely.\"    \"I feel sure of it--so sure that I mean to charge him with it.\"    \"Well, you can see what he says.\"    Ebenezer did not understand that Eben intended to have the boy arrested,  and would not have consented to it had he known. But Eben slipped out of  the store, and arranged for the arrest without his father's knowledge.  Indeed, he did not learn till the trial had already commenced, Eben  having made some excuse for his absence.    When Eben returned his father greeted him in a tone very far from  cordial.    \"Well, Eben, I hear you've gone and made a fool of yourself?\"    \"I have only been defending your property, father,\" said Eben, sullenly.  \"I thought you'd appreciate it better than this.\"    \"You've charged an innocent boy with theft, and now all his friends will  lay it up agin' us.\"    \"Were you going to be robbed without saying a word?\" asked Eben.    \"No, I'm not, Eben Graham; I'm goin' to say a word, and now's the time  to say it. You can't pull wool over my eyes. The money's gone, and the  stamps are gone, and somebody's got 'em.\"    \"Herbert Carr!\"    \"No, it isn't Herbert Carr. It's somebody nearer to me, I'm ashamed to  say, than Herbert Carr.\"    \"Do you mean to say I took them?\" asked Eben.    \"I won't bring a charge unless I can prove it, but I shall watch you  pretty closely after this.\"    \"In that case, I don't wish to work for you any longer; I throw up the  situation,\" said Eben, loftily.    \"Verv well. When are you going to leave town?\"    \"I ain't going to leave town at present.\"    \"Where are you going to board, then?\"    Eben regarded his father in dismay.    \"You're not going to send me adrift, are you?\" he asked, in  consternation.    \"I'm not going to support you in idleness; if you give up your situation  in the store, you'll have to go to work for somebody else.\"    \"I wish I could,\" thought Eben, thinking of the rich young man at the  hotel, from whom he had sought a position as companion.    \"Then I shall have to leave Wayneboro,\" he said; \"there's nothing to do  here.\"    \"Yes, there is; Farmer Collins wants a hired man.\"    \"A hired man!\" repeated Eben, scornfully. \"Do you think I am going--to  hire out on a farm?\"    \"You might do a great deal worse,\" answered Ebenezer, sensibly.    \"After being a dry-goods salesman in Boston, I haven't got down to that,  I beg to assure you,\" said Eben, with an air of consequence.    \"Then you will have to work in the store if you expect to stay at home,\"  said his father. \"And hark you, Eben Graham,\" he added, \"don't report  any more losses of money or stamps. I make you responsible for both.\"    Eben went back to his work in an uneasy frame of mind. He saw that  he had not succeeded in imposing upon his father, and that the  clear-sighted old gentleman strongly suspected where the missing  articles had gone. Eben might have told, had he felt inclined, that  the five-dollar bill had been mailed to a lottery agent in New York in  payment for a ticket in a Southern lottery, and that the stamps were  even now in his possession, and would be sold at the first opportunity.  His plan to throw suspicion upon Herbert had utterly failed, and the  cold looks with which he had been greeted showed what the villagers  thought of his attempt.    \"I won't stay in Wayneboro much longer,\" Eben inwardly resolved. \"It's  the dullest hole in creation. I can get along somehow in a large place,  but here there's positively nothing. Hire out on a farm, indeed! My  father ought to be ashamed to recommend such a thing to his only son,  when he's so well off. If he would only give me two hundred dollars, I  would go to California and trouble him no more. Plenty of people  make money in California, and why shouldn't I? If that ticket draws a  prize--\"    And then Eben went into calculations of what he would do if only he drew  a prize of a thousand dollars. That wasn't too much to expect, for  there were several of that amount, and several considerably larger. He  pictured how independent he would be with his prize, and how he would  tell his father that he could get along without him,"]]]
