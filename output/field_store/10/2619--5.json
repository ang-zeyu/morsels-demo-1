Only a part of the office an'--\"    The miller was already in at the door. In a moment, it seemed, he was  back again, having seen the damage done by the flood to his building.  But that damage was comparatively slight. It should not have caused  the old man to display such profound despair.    He wrung his hands, tore off his hat and stamped upon it on the walk,  and behaved in such a manner that it was little wonder Helen Cameron  was vastly frightened. He seemed beside himself with rage and despair.    Ruth, herself torn by conflicting emotions, could not bear to see the  old man so convulsed with what seemed to be anguish of spirit, without  offering her sympathy. During this week that she had been at the Red  Mill it could not be said that she had gained Uncle Jabez's  confidence--that she had drawn close to him at all. But it was not  for a will on her part to do so.    The girl now left Aunt Alvirah and Helen on the porch and walked  straight down to the old man. She was beside him, with a hand upon his  arm, before he was aware of her coming.    He stared at her so angrily--with such an expression of rage and  hopelessness upon his face--that she was held speechless for a  moment.    \"What do you know about it, girl?\" he demanded, hoarsely.    \"About what, Uncle?\" she returned.    \"The box--the cash-box--my money!\" he cried, in a low voice. \"Do you  know anything about it? Was it saved?\"    \"Oh, Uncle! We only got here in the automobile just in time to escape  the flood. The office was wrecked at that very moment. Was the box  there?\"    \"Gone! Gone!\" he murmured, shaking his head; and turning on his heel,  he strode into the mill.    The boy had taken the mules around to the stable. Ruth hesitated, then  followed the old man into the mill. There Jabez confronted Tom  Cameron, sitting on a sack of meal and watching the turbid waters  falling over the dam.    \"Ha! Young Cameron,\" muttered Uncle Jabez. \"You didn't see the  cash-box, of course?\"    \"Where was it?\" asked Tom, quietly.    \"In that office--on a shelf, with an old coat thrown over it. I  believed it to be as safe there as in the house with nobody but an old  woman to guard it.\"    \"Better put your money in the bank, sir,\" said Tom, coolly.    \"And have some sleek and oily scoundrel steal it, eh?\" snarled Uncle  Jabez.    \"Well, the water stole it, I reckon,\" Tom said. \"I'm sorry for you if  there was much money in the box. But I know nothing about it. Jasper  Parloe might have saved the box had he known about it; he was over  there by the office when the water tore away the wall.\"    \"Jasper Parloe!\" ejaculated Uncle Jabez, starting. \"Was he here?\"    \"He wasn't here long,\" chuckled Tom. \"He thought the mill was going  and he lit out in a hurry.\"    Uncle Jabez made another despairing gesture and walked away. Ruth  followed him and her hands closed upon the toil-hardened fist clenched  at his side.    \"I'm sorry, Uncle,\" she whispered.    He suddenly stared down at her.    \"There! I believe you be, child. But your being sorry can't help it  none. The money's gone--hard it come and it's hard to part with in  this way.\"    \"Was it a large sum, Uncle?\"    \"All the ready cash I had in the world. Every cent I owned. That boy  said, put it in a bank. I lost money when the Cheslow Bank failed  forty year ago. I don't get caught twice in the same trap--no, sir!  I've lost more this time; but no dishonest blackleg will have the  benefit of it, that's sure. The river's got it, and nobody will ever  be a cent the better off for it. All! All gone!\"    He jerked his hand away from Ruth's sympathetic pressure and walked  moodily away.      CHAPTER XII     THE CATASTROPHE    This was the beginning of some little confidence between Ruth and  Uncle Jabez. He had not been quite so stern and unbending, even in his  passion, as before. He said nothing more about the lost cash-box--  Aunt Alviry dared not even broach the subject--but Ruth tried to show  him in quiet ways that she was sorry for his loss.    Uncle Jabez was not a gentle man, however; his voice being so seldom  heard did not make it the less rough and passionate. There were times  when, because of his black looks, Ruth did not even dare address him.  And there was one topic she longed to address him upon very much  indeed. She wanted to go to school.    She had always been quick at her books, and had stood well in the  graded school of Darrowtown. There was a schoolhouse up the road from  the Red Mill--not half a mile away; this district school was a very  good one and the teacher had called on Aunt Alvirah and Ruth liked her  very much.    The flood had long since subsided and the repairs to the mill and the  dam were under way. Uncle Jabez grew no more pleasant, however, for  the freshet had damaged his dam so that all the water had to be let  out and he might go into midsummer with such low pressure behind the  dam that he could not run the mill through the drouth. This  possibility, together with the loss of the cash-box, made him--even  Aunt Alvirah admitted--\"like a dog with a sore head.\" Nevertheless  Ruth determined to speak to him about the school.    She chose an evening when the kitchen was particularly bright and  homelike and her uncle had eaten his supper as though he very much  enjoyed it. There was no cash-box for him to be absorbed in now; but  every evening he made countless calculations in an old ledger which he  took to bed with him with as much care as he had the money-box.    Before he opened his ledger on this evening, however, Ruth stood  beside him and put a hand upon his arm.    \"Uncle,\" she said, bravely, \"can I go to school?\"    He stared at her directly for a moment, from under his heavy brows;  but her own gaze never wavered.    \"How much schoolin' do you want?\" he demanded, harshly.    \"If you please Uncle Jabez, all I can get,\" replied Ruth.    \"Ha! Readin', writin', an' mighty little 'rithmatic--we called 'em  'the three R's '--did for me when I was a boy. The school tax they  put onto me ev'ry year is something wicked. And I never had chick nor  child to go to their blamed old school.\"    \"Let me go, Uncle, and so get some of your money back that way,\" Ruth  said, quickly, and smiling in her little, birdlike way with her head  on one side.    \"Ha! I don't know about that,\" he growled, shaking his head. \"I don't  see what I'll be makin' out of it.\"    \"Perhaps I can help you later, if you'll let me learn enough,\" she  urged. \"I can learn enough arithmetic to keep your books. I'll try  real hard.\"    \"I don't know about that,\" he said, again, eyeing her suspiciously.  \"The little money I make I kin keep watch of--when I'm here to watch  it, that is. There ain't no book-keeping necessary in my business. And  then--there's your Aunt Alviry. She needs you.\"    \"Don't you go for to say that, Jabez,\" interposed the old woman,  briskly. \"That child's the greatest help that ever was; but she can do  all that's necessary before and arter school, and on Saturdays. She's  a good smart child, Jabez. Let her have a chance to l'arn.\"    \"Ain't no good ever come of books,\" muttered the miller.    \"Oh, Uncle! Just let me show you,\" begged the girl, in her earnestness  clinging to his arm with both hands.    He looked down for a moment at her hands as though he would fling off  her hold. But he thought better of it, and waited fully a minute  before he spoke.    \"You know your Aunt Alviry needs ye,\" he said. \"If you kin fix it with  her, why I don't see as I need object.\"    \"Will it be too much trouble for you to get my trunk, Uncle, so that I  can begin going to school next week?\" Ruth asked.    \"Ain't you got nothin' to wear to school?\" he said. \"It's dress; is  it? Beginning that trouble airly; ain't ye?\"    He seemed to be quite cross again, and the girl looked at him in  surprise.    \"Dear Uncle! You will get the trunk from the station, won't you?\"    \"No I won't,\" he said. \"Because why? Because I can't.\"    \"You can't?\" she gasped, and even Aunt Alvirah looked startled.    \"That's what I said.\"    \"Why--why can't you?\" cried Ruth. \"Has something happened to my  trunk?\"    \"That's jest it--and it warn't no fault o' mine,\" said the miller. \"I  got the trunk like I said I would and it was in the wagon when we came  down the hill yonder.    \"Oh, oh!\" gasped Ruth, her hands clasped. \"You don't mean when you ran  the mules into the water, Uncle?\"    \"I had to get to my mill. I didn't know what was being done over  here,\" he said, uglily. \"And didn't I lose enough? What's the loss of  some old rags, and a trunk, 'side of my money?\"    He said it with such force, and with so angry a gesture, that she  shrank back from him. But her pain and disappointment were so strong  that she had to speak.    \"And the trunk was washed out of the wagon, Uncle Jabez? It's gone?\"    \"That's what happened to it, I suppose,\" he grunted, and dropping his  head, opened the ledger and began to study the long lines of figures  there displayed. Not a word to show that he was sorry for her loss. No  appreciation of the girl's pain and sorrow. He selfishly hugged to him  the misfortune of his own loss and gave no heed to Ruth.    But Aunt Alvirah caught her hand as she passed swiftly. The old woman  carried the plump little hand to her lips in mute sympathy, and then  Ruth broke away even from her and ran upstairs to her room. There she  cast herself upon the bed and, with her sobs smothered in the pillows,  gave way to the grief that had long been swelling her heart to the  bursting point.      CHAPTER XIII     BUTTER AND BUTTERCUPS    Such little keepsakes as remained of her father and mother--their  photographs, a thin old bracelet, her mother's wedding ring, her  father's battered silver watch had fortunately been in Ruth's bag.  Those keepsakes had been too precious to risk in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/499"],[0,"Tom Swift in the Land of Wonders; Or, The Underground Search for the Idol of (#10)"],[1,"influence of the  sturdy paddlers.    \"Well, this isn't so bad,\" observed Ned, as he made himself comfortable  in his canoe.  \"How about it, Tom?\"    \"Oh, no.  But this is only the beginning.\"    A canopy had been arranged over their boat to keep off the scorching  rays of the sun.  The boat containing the exploring party and Val  Jacinto took the lead, the baggage craft following.  At the place where  it flowed into the bay on which Puerto Cortes was built, the stream was  wide and deep.    The guide called something to the Indians, who increased their stroke.    \"I tell them to pull hard and that at the end of the day's journey they  will have much rest and refreshment,\" he translated to Professor Bumper  and the others.    \"Bless my ham sandwich, but they'll need plenty of some sort of  refreshment,\" said Mr. Damon, with a sigh.  \"I never knew it to be so  hot.\"    \"Don't complain yet,\" advised Tom, with a laugh.  \"The worst is yet to  come.\"    It really was not unpleasant traveling, aside from the heat.  And they  had expected that, coming as they had to a tropical land.  But, as Tom  said, what lay before them might be worse.    In a little while they had left behind them all signs of civilization.  The river narrowed and flowed sluggishly between the banks which were  luxuriant with tropical growth.  Now and then some lonely Indian hut  could be seen, and occasionally a craft propelled by a man who was  trying to gain a meager living from the rubber forest which hemmed in  the stream on either side.    As the canoe containing the men was paddled along, there floated down  beside it what seemed to be a big, rough log.    \"I wonder if that is mahogany,\" remarked Mr. Damon, reaching over to  touch it.  \"Mahogany is one of the most valuable woods of Honduras, and  if this is a log of that nature----    \"Bless my watch chain!\" he suddenly cried.  \"It's alive!\"    And the \"log\" was indeed so, for there was a sudden flash of white  teeth, a long red opening showed, and then came a click as an immense  alligator, having opened and closed his mouth, sank out of sight in a  swirl of water.    Mr. Damon drew back so suddenly that he tilted the canoe, and the black  paddlers looked around wonderingly.    \"Alligator,\" explained Jacinto succinctly, in their tongue.    \"Ugh!\" they grunted.    \"Bless my--bless my----\" hesitated Mr. Damon, and for one of the very  few times in his life his language failed him.    \"Are there many of them hereabouts?\" asked Ned, looking back at the  swirl left by the saurian.    \"Plenty,\" said the guide, with a shrug of his shoulders.  He seemed to  do as much talking that way, and with his hands, as he did in speech.  \"The river is full of them.\"    \"Dangerous?\" queried Tom.    \"Don't go in swimming,\" was the significant advice.  \"Wait, I'll show  you,\" and he called up the canoe just behind.    In this canoe was a quantity of provisions.  There was a chunk of meat  among other things, a gristly piece, seeing which Mr. Damon had  objected to its being brought along, but the guide had said it would do  for fish bait.  With a quick motion of his hand, as he sat in the  awning-covered stern with Tom, Ned and the others, Jacinto sent the  chunk of meat out into the muddy stream.    Hardly a second later there was a rushing in the water as though a  submarine were about to come up.  An ugly snout was raised, two rows of  keen teeth snapped shut as a scissors-like jaw opened, and the meat was  gone.    \"See!\" was the guide's remark, and something like a cold shiver of fear  passed over the white members of the party.  \"This water is not made in  which to swim.  Be careful!\"    \"We certainly shall,\" agreed Tom.  \"They're fierce.\"    \"And always hungry,\" observed Jacinto grimly.    \"And to think that I--that I nearly had my hand on it,\" murmured Mr.  Damon.  \"Ugh!  Bless my eyeglasses!\"    \"The alligator nearly had your hand,\" said the guide.  \"They can turn  in the water like a flash, wherefore it is not wise to pat one on the  tail lest it present its mouth instead.\"    They paddled on up the river, the dusky Indians now and then breaking  out into a chant that seemed to give their muscles new energy.  The  song, if song it was, passed from one boat to the other, and as the  chant boomed forth the craft shot ahead more swiftly.    They made a landing about noon, and lunch was served.  Tom and his  friends were hungry in spite of the heat.  Moreover, they were  experienced travelers and had learned not to fret over inconveniences  and discomforts.  The Indians ate by themselves, two acting as servants  to Jacinto and the professor's party.    As is usual in traveling in the tropics, a halt was made during the  heated middle of the day.  Then, as the afternoon shadows were waning,  the party again took to the canoes and paddled on up the river.    \"Do you know of a good place to stop during the night?\" asked Professor  Bumper of Jacinto.    \"Oh, yes; a most excellent place.  It is where I always bring  scientific parties I am guiding.  You may rely on me.\"    It was within an hour of dusk--none too much time to allow in which to  pitch camp in the tropics, where night follows day suddenly--when a  halt was called, as a turn of the river showed a little clearing on the  edge of the forest-bound river.    \"We stay here for the night,\" said Jacinto.  \"It is a good place.\"    \"It looks picturesque enough,\" observed Mr. Damon.  \"But it is rather  wild.\"    \"We are a good distance from a settlement,\" agreed the guide.  \"But one  can not explore--and find treasure in cities,\" and he shrugged his  shoulders again.    \"Find treasure?  What do you mean?\" asked Tom quickly.  \"Do you think  that we----?\"    \"Pardon, Senor,\" replied Jacinto softly.  \"I meant no offense.  I think  that all you scientific parties will take treasure if you can find it.\"    \"We are looking for traces of the old Honduras civilization,\" put in  Professor Bumper.    \"And doubtless you will find it,\" was the somewhat too courteous answer  of the guide.  \"Make camp quickly!\" he called to the Indians in their  tongue.  \"You must soon get under the nets or you will be eaten alive!\"  he told Tom.  \"There are many mosquitoes here.\"    The tents were set up, smudge fires built and supper quickly prepared.  Dusk fell rapidly, and as Tom and Ned walked a little way down toward  the river before turning in under the mosquito canopies, the young  financial man said:    \"Sort of lonesome and gloomy, isn't it, Tom?\"    \"Yes.  But you didn't expect to find a moving picture show in the wilds  of Honduras, did you?\"    \"No, and yet-- Look out! What's that?\" suddenly cried Ned, as a great  soft, black shadow seemed to sweep out of a clump of trees toward him.  Involuntarily he clutched Tom's arm and pointed, his face showing fear  in the fast-gathering darkness.          CHAPTER XI    THE VAMPIRES      Tom Swift looked deliberately around.  It was characteristic of him  that, though by nature he was prompt in action, he never acted so  hurriedly as to obscure his judgment.  So, though now Ned showed a  trace of strange excitement, Tom was cool.    \"What is it?\" asked the young inventor.  \"What's the matter?  What did  you think you saw, Ned; another alligator?\"    \"Alligator?  Nonsense! Up on shore?  I saw a black shadow, and I didn't  THINK I saw it, either.  I really did.\"    Tom laughed quietly.    \"A shadow!\" he exclaimed.  \"Since when were you afraid of shadows, Ned?\"    \"I'm not afraid of ordinary shadows,\" answered Ned, and in his voice  there was an uncertain tone.  \"I'm not afraid of my shadow or yours,  Tom, or anybody's that I can see.  But this wasn't any human shadow.  It was as if a great big blob of wet darkness had been waved over your  head.\"    \"That's a queer explanation,\" Tom said in a low voice.  \"A great big  blob of wet darkness!\"    \"But that just describes it,\" went on Ned, looking up and around.  \"It  was just as if you were in some dark room, and some one waved a wet  velvet cloak over your head--spooky like! It didn't make a sound, but  there was a smell as if a den of some wild beast was near here.  I  remember that odor from the time we went hunting with your electric  rifle in the jungle, and got near the den in the rocks where the tigers  lived.\"    \"Well, there is a wild beast smell all around here,\" admitted Tom,  sniffing the air.  \"It's the alligators in the river I guess.  You know  they have an odor of musk.\"    \"Do you mean to say you didn't feel that shadow flying over us just  now?\" asked Ned.    \"Well, I felt something sail through the air, but I took it to be a big  bird.  I didn't pay much attention.  To tell you the truth I was  thinking about Beecher--wondering when he would get here,\" added Tom  quickly as if to forestall any question as to whether or not his  thoughts had to do with Beecher in connection with Tom's affair of the  heart.    \"Well it wasn't a bird--at least not a regular bird,\" said Ned in a low  voice, as once more he looked at the dark and gloomy jungle that  stretched back from the river and behind the little clearing where the  camp had been made.    \"Come on!\" cried Tom, in what he tried to make a cheerful voice.  \"This  is getting on your nerves, Ned, and I didn't know you had any.  Let's  go back and turn in.  I'm dog-tired and the mosquitoes are beginning to  find that we're here.  Let's get under the nets.  Then the black  shadows won't get you.\"    Not at all unwilling to leave so gloomy a scene, Ned, after a brief  glance up and down the dark river, followed his chum.  They found  Professor Bumper and Mr. Damon in their tent, a separate one having  been set up for the two men adjoining that of the youths.    \"Bless my fountain pen!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon, as he caught sight of Tom  and Ned in the flickering light of the smudge fire between the two  canvas shelters.  \"We were just wondering what had become of you.\"    \"We were chasing shadows!\" laughed Tom.  \"At least Ned"]]]
