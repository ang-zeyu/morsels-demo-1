This  stately Jacobean mansion is close to Little Compton, but is really in  Oxfordshire. It has an old-world charm about it entirely its own; and  few ancestral homes can take us back to the days of Cavalier and  Roundhead with such realism, for the old furniture and pictures and  relics have never been disturbed since the house was built by Walter  Jones between the years 1603 and 1630. He purchased the estate from  Robert Catesby, the projector of the Gunpowder Plot, who sold the manor  to provide funds for carrying on that notorious conspiracy.    The great hall is a noble apartment, with raised dais and carved screen;  and the Royalist Joneses looking down upon you on all sides, conspicuous  among whom is Thomas Jones and valiant Captain Arthur Jones, whose sword  beside him shows the good service he did at Worcester fight. When the  day was lost, and Charles was journeying towards Boscobel, the captain  managed to ride his tired horse back to Chastleton. But a party of  Cromwellian soldiers were at his heels, and his wife had only just time  to hurry him into an ingeniously contrived hiding-place when the enemy  confronted her, and refused to budge from the very bedroom behind whose  panelled walls the fugitive was secreted. But Mrs. Arthur Jones had her  share of tact, and in preparing her unwelcome guests some refreshment,  she added a narcotic to the wine, which in time had effect. Her husband  was then released, and with a fresh horse he was soon beyond danger. The  little oak wainscoted chamber and the adjoining bedroom may still be  seen where this exciting episode took place. The drawing-room is very  rich in oak carvings, and the lofty marble chimney-piece bears in the  centre the Jones' arms. The ceiling with its massive pendants is a fine  example of the period.[16] The bedrooms are all hung with the original  tapestry and arras that was made for them. One of them contains the  State bed from old Woodstock Palace; and there are everywhere antique  dressing-tables, mirrors, and quaint embroidered coverlets, and old  chests and cabinets innumerable containing queer old dresses and coats  of the Georgian period, and, what is more remarkable, the identical  Jacobean ruffs and frills which are depicted in the old portraits in the  hall. Then there are cupboards full of delightful old china, and  decanters and wine glasses which were often produced to drink a health  to the \"King over the water.\" But of more direct historic interest is  Charles I.'s Bible, which was given by the widow of the last baronet of  the Juxon family--a grand-nephew of the archbishop--to the then  proprietor of Chastleton, John Jones. It is bound in gold stamped  leather, and bears the Royal arms with the initials C. R. It is dated  1629, and is full of queer old maps and illustrations, and upon the  fly-leaf is written--\"Juxon, Compton, Gloucestershire.\"    Some of the ancient cabinets at Chastleton are full of secret drawers,  and in one of them some years ago a very curious miniature of the martyr  king was discovered. It is painted on copper, and represents Charles I.  with the Order of St. George, and a set of designs drawn on talc,  illustrating the life of the ill-fated monarch from his coronation to  his execution. They are thus described by one of the past owners of  Chastleton: \"They consist of a face and bust in one miniature, in a case  accompanied with a set of eight or nine pictures drawn on talc, being  different scenes or dresses, which are to be laid on the miniature so  that the face of the miniature appears through a hole left for that  purpose: and thus the one miniature does duty in every one of the talc  pictures. These were accidentally discovered some twenty years ago.[17]  The miniature was well known, and was supposed to be complete in itself;  but one day whilst being handled by one of the family, then quite a  child, it fell to the ground, and being in that way forced open at the  back, those talc pictures were brought to light. The careful manner in  which they had been concealed, and the miniature thereby made to appear  no more than an ordinary portrait, seems to warrant the suggestion that  they were in the first instance the property of some affectionate  adherent of Charles, whose prudence persuaded him to conceal what his  loyalty no doubt taught him to value very highly. There is no direct  evidence to show that they belonged to Bishop Juxon; nor is there any  tradition that I ever heard connected with them. The two concluding  pictures of the series represent the decapitated head in the hand of the  executioner, and a hand placing the martyr's crown upon the brows.\"    There are two huge oak staircases running up to the top of the house,  where is the old gallery or ballroom, with a coved ceiling of ornamented  plaster-work, and above the mullioned windows grotesque monster heads  devised in the pargeting.    The grounds and gardens are quite in character: not made to harmonise,  as are so many gardens nowadays, but the original quaint cut box hedges  and trim walks. The grand old house in the centre with its rusty roof of  lichen, and hard by the little church nestling by its side with the  picturesque entrance gateway and dovecot, form together a delightful  group. Chastleton church contains some good brasses. The tower is oddly  placed over the south porch.    A couple of miles to the north, and the same distance beyond, are two  other interesting manor-houses, Barton-on-the-Heath and Little Woolford.  The former, a gabled Jacobean house, was once the seat of the  unfortunate Sir Thomas Overbury, who was done to death in the Tower by  the machinations of that evil couple, Carr, Earl of Somerset, and his  countess. Overbury, it will be remembered, had written the Court  favourite's love letters and poems, and knew too much of that guilty  courtship.    There are some good monuments to the Overburys in the church: a Norman  one with saddle-back tower. Near here is the Four-Shire Stone, described  by Leland as \"a large bigge stone; a Three-Mile-Stone from Rollerich  Stones, which is a very mark or line of Gloucestershire, Whichester  (Worcestershire), Warwickshire, and Oxfordshire.\"    Little Woolford manor-house, the old seat of the Ingrams, is now, or was  some years ago, used as a school. It is very picturesque, and its gables  of half-timber, facing the little courtyard, remind one of the  quadrangle of Ightham Mote. Opposite the Tudor entrance-gate is the  hall, with its open timber roof, minstrels' gallery, panelled walls, and  tall windows, still containing their ancient painted glass. Barton,  which properly should have its ghost, presumably is not so favoured; but  here there are two at least,--a certain \"White Lady,\" who, fortunately  for the juvenile scholars, does not appear until midnight; and the last  of the Ingrams, who has a restless way of tearing about on horseback in  the adjacent fields. This gentleman could not die decently in his bed,  but must needs, upon the point of dying, rush into the stable, mount his  favourite steed, and plunge into the raging tempest to meet his  adversary Death. What a pity there are not more educational  establishments like this. They might possibly make the pupils less  matter-of-fact and more imaginative. But we had almost forgotten a  moral lesson that is to be learned from a rude projection in the masonry  on the left-hand side of the entrance gateway. This is the oven, which  opens at the back of a wide hearth; and here some seventeenth-century  I O U's are said to have been found for money lost at play; while some  Cavaliers were concealed there in the time of the Civil Wars. But the  punishment for gambling was providentially arranged. Some Cromwellian  soldiers dropping in at the manor-house, lighted a tremendous fire, and  gave the unfortunate fugitives a roasting which they did not readily  forget. This is roughly as the story goes; indeed it goes further, for  by local report King Charles himself was one of the victims.    Brailes, a few miles to the north-east, is famous for its church, the  cathedral of southern Warwickshire; but it is principally interesting  exteriorly, the old benches having been long since cleared away and many  nineteenth-century \"improvements\" made. Still there are parts of the  fourteenth-century roof and a fine font, some ancient monuments,  particularly melodious old bells; and the lofty embattled  fifteenth-century tower is exceptionally graceful.    Buried in a hollow, and hidden from view by encircling trees and hills,  is that wonderful old mansion Compton Wyniates. The name (derived from  the ancient family of Compton and Wyniates, a corruption of vineyard,  for at an early period the vine was here cultivated) is suggestive of  something quaint, and indeed a more curious old house could not be  found. Its innumerable gables and twisted chimneys seem to be heaped up  in the most delightful confusion, in abandoned opposition to any  architectural regularity. The eye wanders from tower and turret until it  becomes bewildered by so many twists and angles. Look at the square box  of a house like Moor Park, for example, and wonder how it is that having  arrived at such picturesque perfection, taste should so degenerate. But  half the fascination of Compton Wyniates is its colour; its time-worn  dark-red brick and the grey-green lichens of ancient roofs. Upon one  side the curious gables and countless chimney clusters are reflected in  the moat, part of which now does service as a sunken garden.

But as to the Godhead he cannot give it to you, neither fulfil  his speech to you.  No, he was bitter against you and your descendants,  that will come after you.\"    8 And God withdrew His Word form them.      * At this time, the garments that the Lord had given them in Genesis  3:21 were burned off so that Adam and Eve were again naked.  Reference  chapter L whereby Adam and Eve seek garments with which to cover their  nakedness..          Chapter XLVII - The Devil's own Scheming.    1 Then Adam and Eve came into the cave, yet trembling at the fire that  had scorched their bodies.  So Adam said to Eve:--    2 \"Look, the fire has burnt our flesh in this world; but how will it be  when we are dead, and Satan shall punish our souls?  Is not our  deliverance long and far off, unless God come, and in mercy to us  fulfil His promise?\"    3 Then Adam and Eve passed into the cave, blessing themselves for  coming into it once more.  For it was in their thoughts, that they  never should enter it, when they saw the fire around it.    4 But as the sun was setting the fire was still burning and nearing  Adam and Eve in the cave, so that they could not sleep in it.  After  the sun had set, they went out of it.  This was the forty-seventh day  after they came out of the garden.    5 Adam and Eve then came under the top of hill by the garden to sleep,  as they were accustomed.    6 And they stood and prayed God to forgive them their sins, and then  fell asleep under the summit of the mountain.    7 But Satan, the hater of all good, thought within himself: \"Whereas  God has promised salvation to Adam by covenant, and that He would  deliver him out of all the hardships that have befallen him--but has  not promised me by covenant, and will not deliver me out of my  hardships; no, since He has promised him that He should make him and  his descendants live in the kingdom in which I once was--I will kill  Adam.    8 The earth shall be rid of him; and shall be left to me alone; so that  when he is dead he may not have any descendants left to inherit the  kingdom that shall remain my own realm; God will then be wanting me,  and He will restore it to me and my hosts.\"          Chapter XLVIII - Fifth apparition of Satan to Adam and Eve.    1 After this Satan called to his hosts, all of which came to him, and  said to him:--    2 \"O, our lord, what will you do?\"    3 He then said to them, \"You know that this Adam, whom God created out  of the dust, is the one who has taken our kingdom, come, let us gather  together and kill him; or hurl a rock at him and at Eve, and crush them  under it.\"    4 When Satan's hosts heard these words, they came to the part of the  mountain where Adam and Eve were asleep.    5 Then Satan and his host took a huge rock, broad and even, and without  blemish, thinking within himself, \"If there should be a hole in the  rock, when it fell on them, the hole in the rock might come over them,  and so they would escape and not die.\"    6 He then said to his hosts, \"Take up this stone, and throw it flat on  them, so that it doesn't roll off them to somewhere else.  And when you  have hurled it, get away from there quickly.\"    7 And they did as he told them.  But as the rock fell down from the  mountain toward Adam and Eve, God commanded the rock to become a dome  over them*, that did them no harm.  And so it was by God's order.    8 But when the rock fell, the whole earth quaked with it**, and was  shaken from the size of the rock.    9 And as it quaked and shook, Adam and Eve awoke from sleep, and found  themselves under a dome of rock.  But they didn't know what had  happened; because when the fell asleep they were under the sky, and not  under a dome; and when they saw it, they were afraid.    10 Then Adam said to Eve, \"Wherefore has the mountain bent itself, and  the earth quaked and shaken on our account?  And why has this rock  spread itself over us like a tent?    11 Does God intend to plague us and to shut us up in this prison? Or  will He close the earth over us?    12 He is angry with us for our having come out of the cave, without His  order; and for our having done so of our own accord, without consulting  Him, when we left the cave and came to this place.\"    13 Then Eve said, \"If, indeed, the earth quaked for our sake, and this  rock forms a tent over us because of our transgression, then we will be  sorry, O Adam, because our punishment will be long.    14 But get up and pray to God to let us know concerning this, and what  this rock is that is spread over us like a tent.\"    15 Then Adam stood up and prayed before the Lord, to let him know what  had brought about this difficult time.  And Adam stood praying like  that until the morning.      * The word \"dome\" is used here but the text does not specifically  suggest that the covering was round--only that it covered them on all  sides, however a dome is the most likely shape that would have be able  to withstand the impact with the ground.  From verse 9 that says \"when  they saw it\" and verse 11 that says \"shut us up in this prison\", we can  conclude that the dome had holes in its sides that were big enough to  let in light and air but were too small to allow Adam and Eve to  escape.  Another conclusion would be that the holes were large but too  high up for Adam and Eve to reach, however the former is more likely.    ** In verse 7 of the next chapter (XLIX), God tells Adam and Eve that  the ground was also lowered under them--\"I commanded . . . the rock  under you to lower itself\".          Chapter XLIX - The first prophecy of the Resurrection.    1 Then the Word of God came and said:--    2 \"O Adam, who counselled you, when you came out of the cave, to come  to this place?\"    3 And Adam said to God, \"O Lord, we came to this place because of the  heat of the fire, that came over us inside the cave.\"    4 Then the Lord God said to Adam, \"O Adam, you dread the heat of fire  for one night, but how will it be when you live in hell?    5 Yet, O Adam, don't be afraid, and don't believe that I have placed  this dome of rock over you to plague you with it.    6 It came from Satan, who had promised you the Godhead and majesty.  It  is he who threw down this rock to kill you under it, and Eve with you,  and thus to prevent you from living on the earth.    7 But, in mercy for you, just as that rock was falling down on you, I  commanded it to form an dome over you; and the rock under you to lower  itself.    8 And this sign, O Adam, will happen to Me at My coming on earth: Satan  will raise the people of the Jews to put Me to death; and they will lay  Me in a rock, and seal a large stone over Me, and I shall remain within  that rock three days and three nights.    9 But on the third day I shall rise again, and it shall be salvation to  you, O Adam, and to your descendants, to believe in Me.  But, O Adam, I  will not bring you from under this rock until three days and three  nights have passed.\"    10 And God withdrew His Word from Adam.    11 But Adam and Eve lived under the rock three days and three nights,  as God had told them.    12 And God did so to them because they had left their cave and had come  to  this same place without God's order.    13 But, after three days and three nights, God created an opening in  the dome of rock and allowed them to get out from under it.  Their  flesh was dried up, and their eyes and hearts were troubled from crying  and sorrow.          Chapter L - Adam and Eve seek to cover their nakedness.    1 Then Adam and Eve went forth and came into the Cave of Treasures, and  they stood praying in it the whole of that day, until the evening.    2 And this took place at the end of the fifty days after they had left  the garden.    3 But Adam and Eve rose again and prayed to God in the cave the whole  of that night, and begged for mercy from Him.    4 And when the day dawned, Adam said to Eve, \"Come!  Let us go and do  some work for our bodies.\"    5 So they went out of the cave, and came to the northern border of the  garden, and they looked for something to cover their bodies with*.  But  they found nothing, and knew not how to do the work.  Yet their bodies  were stained, and they were speechless from cold and heat.    6 Then Adam stood and asked God to show him something with which to  cover their bodies.    7 Then came the Word of God and said to him, \"O Adam, take Eve and come  to the seashore where you fasted before.  There you will find skins of  sheep that were left after lions ate the carcasses.  Take them and make  garments for yourselves, and clothe yourselves with them.      * Chapter XLVI, verse 1, says \"Satan blew into the fire ... so that  their bodies were singed\".  At this time, the garments that the Lord  had given them in Genesis 3:21 were burned off so that Adam and Eve  were again naked.          Chapter LI - \"What is his beauty that you should have followed him?\"    1 When Adam heard these words from God, he took Eve and went from the  northern end of the garden to the south of it, by the river of water  where they once fasted.    2 But as they were going on their way, and before they got there,  Satan, the wicked one, had heard the Word of God communing with Adam  respecting his covering.    3 It grieved him, and he hastened to the place where the sheep-skins  were, with the intention of taking them and throwing them into the sea,  or of burning them with fire, so that Adam and Eve would not find them.    4 But as he was about to take them, the Word of God came from heaven,  and bound him by the side of those skins until Adam and Eve came near  him.  But as they got closer "]]]
