Alas! by the same disease which we are deploring, we see that the  Palladium of Paris has been carried off in these sad times of ours,  wherein the zeal of that noble university, whose rays once shed light  into every corner of the world, has grown lukewarm, nay, is all but  frozen.  There the pen of every scribe is now at rest, generations of  books no longer succeed each other, and there is none who begins to  take place as a new author.  They wrap up their doctrines in unskilled  discourse, and are losing all propriety of logic, except that our  English subtleties, which they denounce in public, are the subject of  their furtive vigils.    Admirable Minerva seems to bend her course to all the nations of the  earth, and reacheth from end to end mightily, that she may reveal  herself to all mankind.  We see that she has already visited the  Indians, the Babylonians, the Egyptians and Greeks, the Arabs and the  Romans.  Now she has passed by Paris, and now has happily come to  Britain, the most noble of islands, nay, rather a microcosm in itself,  that she may show herself a debtor both to the Greeks and to the  Barbarians.  At which wondrous sight it is conceived by most men, that  as philosophy is now lukewarm in France, so her soldiery are unmanned  and languishing.        CHAPTER X    OF THE GRADUAL PERFECTING OF BOOKS    While assiduously seeking out the wisdom of the men of old, according  to the counsel of the Wise Man (Eccles. xxxix.):  The wise man, he  says, will seek out the wisdom of all the ancients, we have not thought  fit to be misled into the opinion that the first founders of the arts  have purged away all crudeness, knowing that the discoveries of each of  the faithful, when weighed in a faithful balance, makes a tiny portion  of science, but that by the anxious investigations of a multitude of  scholars, each as it were contributing his share, the mighty bodies of  the sciences have grown by successive augmentations to the immense bulk  that we now behold.  For the disciples, continually melting down the  doctrines of their masters, and passing them again through the furnace,  drove off the dross that had been previously overlooked, until there  came out refined gold tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times  to perfection, and stained by no admixture of error or doubt.    For not even Aristotle, although a man of gigantic intellect, in whom  it pleased Nature to try how much of reason she could bestow upon  mortality, and whom the Most High made only a little lower than the  angels, sucked from his own fingers those wonderful volumes which the  whole world can hardly contain.  But, on the contrary, with lynx-eyed  penetration he had seen through the sacred books of the Hebrews, the  Babylonians, the Egyptians, the Chaldaeans, the Persians and the Medes,  all of which learned Greece had transferred into her treasuries.  Whose  true sayings he received, but smoothed away their crudities, pruned  their superfluities, supplied their deficiencies, and removed their  errors.  And he held that we should give thanks not only to those who  teach rightly, but even to those who err, as affording the way of more  easily investigating truth, as he plainly declares in the second book  of his Metaphysics.  Thus many learned lawyers contributed to the  Pandects, many physicians to the Tegni, and it was by this means that  Avicenna edited his Canon, and Pliny his great work on Natural History,  and Ptolemy the Almagest.    For as in the writers of annals it is not difficult to see that the  later writer always presupposes the earlier, without whom he could by  no means relate the former times, so too we are to think of the authors  of the sciences.  For no man by himself has brought forth any science,  since between the earliest students and those of the latter time we  find intermediaries, ancient if they be compared with our own age, but  modern if we think of the foundations of learning, and these men we  consider the most learned.  What would Virgil, the chief poet among the  Latins, have achieved, if he had not despoiled Theocritus, Lucretius,  and Homer, and had not ploughed with their heifer?  What, unless again  and again he had read somewhat of Parthenius and Pindar, whose  eloquence he could by no means imitate?  What could Sallust, Tully,  Boethius, Macrobius, Lactantius, Martianus, and in short the whole  troop of Latin writers have done, if they had not seen the productions  of Athens or the volumes of the Greeks?  Certes, little would Jerome,  master of three languages, Ambrosius, Augustine, though he confesses  that he hated Greek, or even Gregory, who is said to have been wholly  ignorant of it, have contributed to the doctrine of the Church, if more  learned Greece had not furnished them from its stores.  As Rome,  watered by the streams of Greece, had earlier brought forth  philosophers in the image of the Greeks, in like fashion afterwards it  produced doctors of the orthodox faith.  The creeds we chant are the  sweat of Grecian brows, promulgated by their Councils, and established  by the martyrdom of many.    Yet their natural slowness, as it happens, turns to the glory of the  Latins, since as they were less learned in their studies, so they were  less perverse in their errors.  In truth, the Arian heresy had all but  eclipsed the whole Church; the Nestorian wickedness presumed to rave  with blasphemous rage against the Virgin, for it would have robbed the  Queen of Heaven, not in open fight but in disputation, of her name and  character as Mother of God, unless the invincible champion Cyril, ready  to do single battle, with the help of the Council of Ephesus, had in  vehemence of spirit utterly extinguished it.  Innumerable are the forms  as well as the authors of Greek heresies; for as they were the original  cultivators of our holy faith, so too they were the first sowers of  tares, as is shown by veracious history.  And thus they went on from  bad to worse, because in endeavouring to part the seamless vesture of  the Lord, they totally destroyed primitive simplicity of doctrine, and  blinded by the darkness of novelty would fall into the bottomless pit,  unless He provide for them in His inscrutable prerogative, whose wisdom  is past reckoning.    Let this suffice; for here we reach the limit of our power of judgment.  One thing, however, we conclude from the premises, that the ignorance  of the Greek tongue is now a great hindrance to the study of the Latin  writers, since without it the doctrines of the ancient authors, whether  Christian or Gentile, cannot be understood.  And we must come to a like  judgment as to Arabic in numerous astronomical treatises, and as to  Hebrew as regards the text of the Holy Bible, which deficiencies,  indeed, Clement V.  provides for, if only the bishops would faithfully  observe what they so lightly decree.  Wherefore we have taken care to  provide a Greek as well as a Hebrew grammar for our scholars, with  certain other aids, by the help of which studious readers may greatly  inform themselves in the writing, reading, and understanding of the  said tongues, although only the hearing of them can teach correctness  of idiom.        CHAPTER XI    WHY WE HAVE PREFERRED BOOKS OF LIBERAL LEARNING TO BOOKS OF LAW    That lucrative practice of positive law, designed for the dispensation  of earthly things, the more useful it is found by the children of this  world, so much the less does it aid the children of light in  comprehending the mysteries of holy writ and the secret sacraments of  the faith, seeing that it disposes us peculiarly to the friendship of  the world, by which man, as S.  James testifies, is made the enemy of  God.  Law indeed encourages rather than extinguishes the contentions of  mankind, which are the result of unbounded greed, by complicated laws,  which can be turned either way; though we know that it was created by  jurisconsults and pious princes for the purpose of assuaging these  contentions.  But in truth, as the same science deals with contraries,  and the power of reason can be used to opposite ends, and at the same  the human mind is more inclined to evil, it happens with the practisers  of this science that they usually devote themselves to promoting  contention rather than peace, and instead of quoting laws according to  the intent of the legislator, violently strain the language thereof to  effect their own purposes.    Wherefore, although the over-mastering love of books has possessed our  mind from boyhood, and to rejoice in their delights has been our only  pleasure, yet the appetite for the books of the civil law took less  hold of our affections, and we have spent but little labour and expense  in acquiring volumes of this kind.  For they are useful only as the  scorpion in treacle, as Aristotle, the sun of science, has said of  logic in his book De Pomo.  We have noticed a certain manifest  difference of nature between law and science, in that every science is  delighted and desires to open its inward parts and display the very  heart of its principles, and to show forth the roots from which it buds  and flourishes, and that the emanation of its springs may be seen of  all men; for thus from the cognate and harmonious light of the truth of  conclusion  to principles, the whole body of science will be full of  light, having no part dark.  But laws, on the contrary, since they are  only human enactments for the regulation of social life, or the yokes  of princes thrown over the necks of their subjects, refuse to be  brought to the standard of synteresis, the origin of equity, because  they feel that they possess more of arbitrary will than rational  judgment.  Wherefore the judgment of the wise for the most part is that  the causes of laws are not a fit subject of discussion.

He was prepared only as a forlorn hope is prepared, with  energy, with personal courage, with knowledge; and never were these more  needed.    With the telegram in his hand, he thought of his few English assistants,  and sighed; for the game they would play was the game of Hercules and  Death over the body of Alcestis.    Dicky noted the sigh, read the telegram, drank another glass of claret,  lighted a cigarette, drew his coffee to him, and said: \"The Khedive is  away--I'm off duty; take me.\"    Fielding looked surprised, yet with an eye of hope. If there was one man  in Egypt who could do useful work in the business, it was little Dicky  Donovan, who had a way with natives such as no man ever had in Egypt;  who knew no fear of anything mortal; who was as tireless as a beaver,  as keen-minded as a lynx is sharp-eyed. It was said to Dicky's discredit  that he had no heart, but Fielding knew better. When Dicky offered  himself now, Fielding said, almost feverishly: \"But, dear old D., you  don't see--\"    \"Don't I?--Well, then,           \"'What are the blessings of the sight?--          Oh, tell your poor blind boy!'\"    What Fielding told him did not alter his intention, nor was it  Fielding's wish that it should, though he felt it right to warn the  little man what sort of thing was in store for them.    \"As if I don't know, old lime-burner!\" answered Dicky coolly.    In an hour they were on the Amenhotep, and in two hours they were on the  way--a floating hospital--to the infected district of Kalamoun. There  the troubles began. It wasn't the heat, and it wasn't the work, and it  wasn't the everlasting care of the sick: it was the ceaseless hunt for  the disease-stricken, the still, tireless opposition of the natives, the  remorseless deception, the hopeless struggle against the covert odds.  With nothing behind: no support from the Government, no adequate  supplies, few capable men; and all the time the dead, inert,  dust-powdered air; the offices of policeman, doctor, apothecary, even  undertaker and gravedigger, to perform; and the endless weeks of it  all. A handful of good men under two leaders of nerve, conscience and  ability, to fight an invisible enemy, which, gaining headway, would  destroy its scores of thousands!    At the end of the first two months Fielding Bey became hopeless.    \"We can't throttle it,\" he said to Dicky Donovan. \"They don't give us  the ghost of a chance. To-day I found a dead-un hid in an oven under a  heap of flour to be used for to-morrow's baking; I found another doubled  up in a cupboard, and another under a pile of dourha which will be  ground into flour.\"    \"With twenty ghaffirs I beat five cane and dourha fields this morning,\"  said Dicky. \"Found three cases. They'd been taken out of the village  during the night.\"    \"Bad ones?\"    \"So so. They'll be worse before they're better. That was my morning's  flutter. This afternoon I found the huts these gentlemen call their  homes. I knocked holes in the roofs per usual, burnt everything that  wasn't wood, let in the light o' heaven, and splashed about limewash and  perchloride. That's my day's tot-up. Any particular trouble?\" he added,  eyeing Fielding closely.    Fielding fretfully jerked his foot on the floor, and lighted his pipe,  the first that day.    \"Heaps. I've put the barber in prison, and given the sarraf twenty  lashes for certifying that the death of the son of the Mamour was el  aadah--the ordinary. It was one of the worst cases I've ever seen. He  fell ill at ten and was dead at two, the permis d'inhumation was given  at four, and the usual thing occurred: the bodywashers got the bedding  and clothing, and the others the coverlet. God only knows who'll wear  that clothing, who'll sleep in that bed!\"    \"If the Lord would only send them sense, we'd supply sublimate  solution--douche and spray, and zinc for their little long boxes of  bones,\" mused Dicky, his eyes half shut, as he turned over in his hands  some scarabs a place-hunting official had brought him that day. \"Well,  that isn't all?\" he added, with a quick upward glance and a quizzical  smile. His eyes, however, as they fell on Fielding's, softened in a  peculiar way, and a troubled look flashed through them; for Fielding's  face was drawn and cold, though the eyes were feverish, and a bright  spot burned on his high cheek-bones.    \"No, it isn't all, Dicky. The devil's in the whole business. Steady,  sullen opposition meets us at every hand. Norman's been here--rode over  from Abdallah--twenty-five miles. A report's going through the native  villages, started at Abdallah, that our sanitary agents are throwing  yellow handkerchiefs in the faces of those they're going to isolate.\"    \"That's Hoskai Bey's yellow handkerchief. He's a good man, but he blows  his nose too much, and blows it with a flourish.... Has Norman gone  back?\"    \"No, I've made him lie down in my cabin. He says he can't sleep, says he  can only work. He looks ten years older. Abdallah's an awful place, and  it's a heavy district. The Mamour there's a scoundrel. He has influenced  the whole district against Norman and our men. Norman--you know what  an Alexander-Hannibal baby it is, all the head of him good for the best  sort of work anywhere, all the fat heart of him dripping sentiment--gave  a youngster a comfit the other day. By some infernal accident the child  fell ill two days afterwards--it had been sucking its father's old  shoe--and Norman just saved its life by the skin of his teeth. If the  child had died, there'd have been a riot probably. As it is, there's  talk that we're scattering poisoned sweetmeats to spread the disease.  He's done a plucky thing, though....\" He paused. Dicky looked up  inquiringly, and Fielding continued. \"There's a fellow called Mustapha  Kali, a hanger-on of the Mudir of the province. He spread a report that  this business was only a scare got up by us; that we poisoned the people  and buried them alive. What does Norman do? He promptly arrests him,  takes him to the Mudir, and says that the brute must be punished or  he'll carry the matter to the Khedive.\"    \"Here's to you, Mr. Norman!\" said Dicky, with a little laugh. \"What does  the Mudir do?\"    \"Doesn't know what to do. He tells Norman to say to me that if he puts  the fellow in prison there'll be a riot, for they'll make a martyr of  him. If he fines him it won't improve matters. So he asks me to name  a punishment which'll suit our case. He promises to give it 'his most  distinguished consideration.'\"    \"And what's your particular poison for him?\" asked Dicky, with his eyes  on the Cholera Hospital a few hundred yards away.    \"I don't know. If he's punished in the ordinary way it will only make  matters worse, as the Mudir says. Something's needed that will play our  game and turn the tables on the reptile too.\"    \"A sort of bite himself with his own fangs, eh?\" Dicky seemed only idly  watching the moving figures by the hospital.    \"Yes, but what is it? I can't inoculate him with bacilli. That's what'd  do the work, I fancy.\"    \"Pocket your fancy, Fielding,\" answered Dicky. \"Let me have a throw.\"    \"Go on. If you can't hit it off, it's no good, for my head doesn't think  these days: it only sees, and hears, and burns.\"    Dicky eyed Fielding keenly, and then, pouring out some whiskey for  himself, put the bottle on the floor beside him, casually as it were.  Then he said, with his girlish laugh, not quite so girlish these  days: \"I've got his sentence pat--it'll meet the case, or you may say,  'Cassio, never more be officer of mine.'\"    He drew over a piece of paper lying on the piano--for there was a piano  on the Amenhotep, and with what seemed an audacious levity Fielding  played in those rare moments when they were not working or sleeping; and  Fielding could really play! As Dicky wrote he read aloud in a kind of  legal monotone:       The citizen Mustapha Kali having asserted that there is no cholera,     and circulated various false statements concerning the treatment of     patients, is hereby appointed as hospital-assistant for three     months, in the Cholera Hospital of Kalamoun, that he may have     opportunity of correcting his opinions.             --Signed Ebn ben Hari, Mudir of Abdallah.    Fielding lay back and laughed--the first laugh on his lips for a  fortnight. He laughed till his dry, fevered lips took on a natural  moisture, and he said at last: \"You've pulled it off, D. That's  masterly. You and Norman have the only brains in this show. I get worse  every day; I do--upon my soul!\"    There was a curious anxious look in Dicky's eyes, but he only said: \"You  like it? Think it fills the bill, eh?\"    \"If the Mudir doesn't pass the sentence I'll shut up shop.\" He leaned  over anxiously to Dicky and gripped his arm. \"I tell you this pressure  of opposition has got to be removed, or we'll never get this beast of an  epidemic under, but we'll go under instead, my boy.\"    \"Oh, we're doing all right,\" Dicky answered, with only apparent  carelessness. \"We've got inspection of the trains, we've got some  sort of command of the foreshores, we've got the water changed in the  mosques, we've closed the fountains, we've stopped the markets, we've  put Sublimate Pasha and Limewash Effendi on the war-path, and--\"    \"And the natives believe in lighted tar-barrels and a cordon sanitaire!  No, D., things must take a turn, or the game's lost and we'll go with  it. Success is the only thing that'll save their lives--and ours: we  couldn't stand failure in this. A man can walk to the gates of hell to  do the hardest trick, and he'll come back one great blister and live,  if he's done the thing he set out for; but if he doesn't do it, he falls  into the furnace. He never comes back. Dicky, things must be pulled our  way, or we go to deep damnation.\"    Dicky turned a little pale, for there was high nervous excitement in  Fielding's"]]]
