The little folk listened to him quietly.    \"What shall we do?\" asked Ak.    \"These creatures are of no benefit to the world,\" said the Prince of  the Knooks; \"we must destroy them.\"    \"Their lives are devoted only to evil deeds,\" said the Prince of the  Ryls.  \"We must destroy them.\"    \"They have no conscience, and endeavor to make all mortals as bad as  themselves,\" said the Queen of the Fairies.  \"We must destroy them.\"    \"They have defied the great Ak, and threaten the life of our adopted  son,\" said beautiful Queen Zurline.  \"We must destroy them.\"    The Master Woodsman smiled.    \"You speak well,\" said he.  \"These Awgwas we know to be a powerful  race, and they will fight desperately; yet the outcome is certain.  For  we who live can never die, even though conquered by our enemies, while  every Awgwa who is struck down is one foe the less to oppose us.  Prepare, then, for battle, and let us resolve to show no mercy to the  wicked!\"    Thus arose that terrible war between the immortals and the spirits of  evil which is sung of in Fairyland to this very day.    The King Awgwa and his band determined to carry out the threat to  destroy Claus.  They now hated him for two reasons: he made children  happy and was a friend of the Master Woodsman.  But since Ak's visit  they had reason to fear the opposition of the immortals, and they  dreaded defeat.  So the King sent swift messengers to all parts of the  world to summon every evil creature to his aid.    And on the third day after the declaration of war a mighty army was at  the command of the King Awgwa.  There were three hundred Asiatic  Dragons, breathing fire that consumed everything it touched.  These  hated mankind and all good spirits.  And there were the three-eyed  Giants of Tatary, a host in themselves, who liked nothing better than  to fight.  And next came the Black Demons from Patalonia, with great  spreading wings like those of a bat, which swept terror and misery  through the world as they beat upon the air.  And joined to these were  the Goozzle-Goblins, with long talons as sharp as swords, with which  they clawed the flesh from their foes.  Finally, every mountain Awgwa  in the world had come to participate in the great battle with the  immortals.    The King Awgwa looked around upon this vast army and his heart beat  high with wicked pride, for he believed he would surely triumph over  his gentle enemies, who had never before been known to fight.  But the  Master Woodsman had not been idle.  None of his people was used to  warfare, yet now that they were called upon to face the hosts of evil  they willingly prepared for the fray.    Ak had commanded them to assemble in the Laughing Valley, where Claus,  ignorant of the terrible battle that was to be waged on his account,  was quietly making his toys.    Soon the entire Valley, from hill to hill, was filled with the little  immortals.  The Master Woodsman stood first, bearing a gleaming ax that  shone like burnished silver.  Next came the Ryls, armed with sharp  thorns from bramblebushes.  Then the Knooks, bearing the spears they  used when they were forced to prod their savage beasts into submission.  The Fairies, dressed in white gauze with rainbow-hued wings, bore  golden wands, and the Wood-nymphs, in their uniforms of oak-leaf green,  carried switches from ash trees as weapons.    Loud laughed the Awgwa King when he beheld the size and the arms of his  foes.  To be sure the mighty ax of the Woodsman was to be dreaded, but  the sweet-faced Nymphs and pretty Fairies, the gentle Ryls and crooked  Knooks were such harmless folk that he almost felt shame at having  called such a terrible host to oppose them.    \"Since these fools dare fight,\" he said to the leader of the Tatary  Giants, \"I will overwhelm them with our evil powers!\"    To begin the battle he poised a great stone in his left hand and cast  it full against the sturdy form of the Master Woodsman, who turned it  aside with his ax.  Then rushed the three-eyed Giants of Tatary upon  the Knooks, and the Goozzle-Goblins upon the Ryls, and the  firebreathing Dragons upon the sweet Fairies.  Because the Nymphs were  Ak's own people the band of Awgwas sought them out, thinking to  overcome them with ease.    But it is the Law that while Evil, unopposed, may accomplish terrible  deeds, the powers of Good can never be overthrown when opposed to Evil.  Well had it been for the King Awgwa had he known the Law!    His ignorance cost him his existence, for one flash of the ax borne by  the Master Woodsman of the World cleft the wicked King in twain and rid  the earth of the vilest creature it contained.    Greatly marveled the Tatary Giants when the spears of the little Knooks  pierced their thick walls of flesh and sent them reeling to the ground  with howls of agony.    Woe came upon the sharp-taloned Goblins when the thorns of the Ryls  reached their savage hearts and let their life-blood sprinkle all the  plain.  And afterward from every drop a thistle grew.    The Dragons paused astonished before the Fairy wands, from whence  rushed a power that caused their fiery breaths to flow back on  themselves so that they shriveled away and died.    As for the Awgwas, they had scant time to realize how they were  destroyed, for the ash switches of the Nymphs bore a charm unknown to  any Awgwa, and turned their foes into clods of earth at the slightest  touch!    When Ak leaned upon his gleaming ax and turned to look over the field  of battle he saw the few Giants who were able to run disappearing over  the distant hills on their return to Tatary.  The Goblins had perished  every one, as had the terrible Dragons, while all that remained of the  wicked Awgwas was a great number of earthen hillocks dotting the plain.    And now the immortals melted from the Valley like dew at sunrise, to  resume their duties in the Forest, while Ak walked slowly and  thoughtfully to the house of Claus and entered.    \"You have many toys ready for the children,\" said the Woodsman, \"and  now you may carry them across the plain to the dwellings and the  villages without fear.\"    \"Will not the Awgwas harm me?\" asked Claus, eagerly.    \"The Awgwas,\" said Ak, \"have perished!\"      Now I will gladly have done with wicked spirits and with fighting and  bloodshed.  It was not from choice that I told of the Awgwas and their  allies, and of their great battle with the immortals.  They were part  of this history, and could not be avoided.        8.  The First Journey with the Reindeer    Those were happy days for Claus when he carried his accumulation of  toys to the children who had awaited them so long.  During his  imprisonment in the Valley he had been so industrious that all his  shelves were filled with playthings, and after quickly supplying the  little ones living near by he saw he must now extend his travels to  wider fields.    Remembering the time when he had journeyed with Ak through all the  world, he knew children were everywhere, and he longed to make as many  as possible happy with his gifts.    So he loaded a great sack with all kinds of toys, slung it upon his  back that he might carry it more easily, and started off on a longer  trip than he had yet undertaken.    Wherever he showed his merry face, in hamlet or in farmhouse, he  received a cordial welcome, for his fame had spread into far lands.  At  each village the children swarmed about him, following his footsteps  wherever he went; and the women thanked him gratefully for the joy he  brought their little ones; and the men looked upon him curiously that  he should devote his time to such a queer occupation as toy-making.  But every one smiled on him and gave him kindly words, and Claus felt  amply repaid for his long journey.    When the sack was empty he went back again to the Laughing Valley and  once more filled it to the brim.  This time he followed another road,  into a different part of the country, and carried happiness to many  children who never before had owned a toy or guessed that such a  delightful plaything existed.    After a third journey, so far away that Claus was many days walking the  distance, the store of toys became exhausted and without delay he set  about making a fresh supply.    From seeing so many children and studying their tastes he had acquired  several new ideas about toys.    The dollies were, he had found, the most delightful of all playthings  for babies and little girls, and often those who could not say \"dolly\"  would call for a \"doll\" in their sweet baby talk.  So Claus resolved to  make many dolls, of all sizes, and to dress them in bright-colored  clothing.  The older boys--and even some of the girls--loved the images  of animals, so he still made cats and elephants and horses.  And many  of the little fellows had musical natures, and longed for drums and  cymbals and whistles and horns.  So he made a number of toy drums, with  tiny sticks to beat them with; and he made whistles from the willow  trees, and horns from the bog-reeds, and cymbals from bits of beaten  metal.    All this kept him busily at work, and before he realized it the winter  season came, with deeper snows than usual, and he knew he could not  leave the Valley with his heavy pack.  Moreover, the next trip would  take him farther from home than every before, and Jack Frost was  mischievous enough to nip his nose and ears if he undertook the long  journey while the Frost King reigned.  The Frost King was Jack's father  and never reproved him for his pranks.    So Claus remained at his work-bench; but he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5201"],[0,"Don Juan Tenorio (#10)"],[1,"         You are dreaming.    DON LUIS. ¿Por qué?
