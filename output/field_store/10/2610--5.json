How is the good knight? Not suffering,  I trust, greatly either in body or temper?\"    \"You shall repent this, Archibald Forbes,\" Allan Kerr exclaimed  furiously. \"It will be my turn next time.\"    And turning his horse he rode off at full speed, attended by his  followers.    \"We had best start at once, Master Archie,\" Sandy Graham said:  \"it is eight miles to the Kerrs' hold, and when Allan Kerr returns  there you may be sure they will call out their vassals and will be  here betimes in the morning. Best get another cart from the village,  for your men are weary and footsore, seeing that since yesterday  even they have been marching without ceasing. Elspie will by this  time have got supper ready.  There was a row of ducks and chickens  on the spit when I came away.\"    \"That were best, Sandy. Do you see to their comforts, and aid my  mother pack up such things as she most values, and I will go myself  down to the village for the cart, for I wish to speak with some  there.\"    Archie had no difficulty in engaging two carts, as he thought that  one would be needed for his mother and what possessions she might  take. Then he went from house to house and saw his old companions,  and told them of his plans, which filled them with delight. Having  done this he returned to the hold, hastily ate the supper which  had been put aside for him, and then saw that his mother's chests,  which contained all her possessions save a few articles of heavy  furniture, were placed in one of the carts. A bed was then laid  on its floor upon which she could sit comfortably. Elspie mounted  with her. Archie, Sandy, and the men took their places in the other  carts, and the party drove off. They had no fear of interruption,  for the Kerrs, ignorant of the number who had arrived with Archie  at Glen Cairn, would not venture to attack until they had gathered  a considerable force, and would not be likely to set out till  morning, and long before that time Dame Forbes would have arrived  at her sister's.    The journey was indeed performed without incident, the escort  leaving them when within two or three miles of Lanark, and making  their way direct to the craigs, whither Archie, the moment he had  seen his mother safely at Sir Robert Gordon's, returned. He did  not mount the craig, but wrapping himself in his cloak lay down at  its foot.    As soon as it was daylight he walked out a mile on the road towards  Glen Cairn. He soon saw a party approaching in military order. They  halted when they reached him. They were twenty in number, and were  the lads of his band at Glen Cairn, ranging between the ages of  sixteen and eighteen.  They had originally been stronger, but some  of the elders had already joined Wallace's followers.    \"Now,\" Archie said, \"I can explain matters farther than I did last  night. I have procured arms for you all, and I hope that you will  have opportunities of using them. But though some of you are old  enough to join Wallace's band, there are others whom he might not  deem fit to take part in such desperate enterprises.  Therefore  at first make but little show of your arms. I shall present you to  Sir William, telling him that I have brought you hither to serve  as messengers, and to enter towns held by the English and gather  news, seeing that lads would be less suspected than men. But I  propose farther, what I shall not tell him, that you shall form a  sort of bodyguard to him. He takes not sufficient care of himself,  and is ever getting into perils.  I propose that without his  knowing it, you shall be ever at hand when he goes into danger of  this sort, and may thus prevent his falling into the hands of his  enemies. Now, mind, lads, this is a great and honourable mission.  You must be discreet as well as brave, and ready all of you to give  your lives, if need be, for that of Scotland's champion. Your work  as messengers and scouts will be arduous and wearisome. You must  be quiet and well behaved--remember that boys' tricks and play  are out of place among men engaged in a desperate enterprise. Mingle  not much with the others. Be active and prompt in obeying orders,  and be assured that you will have opportunities of winning great  honour and credit, and of having your full share of hard knocks.  You will, as before, be divided into two companies, William Orr and  Andrew Macpherson being your lieutenants in my absence. You will  obey their orders as implicitly as mine. Cluny, you have, I suppose,  brought, as I bade you last night, some of your sister's garments?\"    \"Yes, Sir Archie,\" the boy, who was fair and slight, said, with a  smile on his face.    \"That is right. I know you are as hearty and strong as the rest;  but seeing that your face is the smoothest and softest of any,  you will do best should we need one in disguise as a girl. And now  come with me. I will show you where your arms are placed; but at  present you must not take them. If I led you as an armed band to  Wallace he might deem you too young. I must present you merely as  lads whom I know to be faithful and trustworthy, and who are willing  to act as messengers and scouts to his force.\"    So saying Archie led the band to the thicket where he had placed  their arms, and the lads were pleased when they saw the pikes,  swords, and head pieces. Then he led them up the craig to Wallace.    \"Why, whom have you here?\" Sir William exclaimed in surprise. \"This  will not do, Sir Archie. All lads are not like yourself, and were  I to take such boys into my ranks I should have all the mothers in  Scotland calling out against me.\"    \"I have not brought them to join your ranks, Sir William, although  many of them are stout fellows who might do good service at a  pinch. I have brought them to act as messengers and scouts. They  can carry orders whithersoever you may have occasion to send. They  can act as scouts to warn you of the approach of an enemy; or if  you need news of the state of any of the enemy's garrisons, they  can go thither and enter without being suspected, when a man might  be questioned and stopped. They are all sons of my father's vassals  at Glen Cairn, and I can answer for their fidelity. I will take  them specially under my own charge, and you will ever have a fleet  and active messenger at hand when you desire to send an order.\"    \"The idea is not a bad one,\" Sir William replied; \"and in such a  way a lad may well do the work of a man.  Very well, Sir Archie,  since you seem to have set your mind upon it I will not say nay.  At any rate we can give the matter a trial, understanding that you  take the charge of them and are responsible for them in all ways.  Now, lads,\" he said turning, \"you have heard that your lord, for  he is your rightful lord, and will, if Scotland gains the day, be  your real lord again, has answered for you. It is no boys' play  in which you have taken service, for the English, if they conquer  us, will show no further mercy to you than to others of my band. I  understand then that you are all prepared, if need be, to die for  Scotland. Is this so?\"    \"We are, sir,\" the lads exclaimed together.    \"Then so be it,\" Sir William said. \"Now, Sir Archie, do you fix  a place for their encampment, and make such other arrangements  as you may think fit. You will, of course, draw rations and other  necessaries for them as regular members of the band.\"    Archie descended with his troop from the craigs, and chose a spot  where they would be apart from the others. It was a small piece of  ground cut off by the stream which wound at the foot of the craigs,  so that to reach it it was necessary to wade knee deep through the  water. This was no inconvenience to the lads, all of whom, as was  common with their class at the time, were accustomed to go barefoot,  although they sometimes wore a sort of sandal. Bushes were cut  down, and arbours made capable of containing them. The spot was  but a little distance from the foot of the path up the craigs, and  any one descending the path could be seen from it.    Archie gave orders that one was always to be above in readiness to  start instantly with a message; that a sentry was to be placed at  the camp, who was to keep his eyes upon the path, and the moment  the one on duty above was seen to leave, the next upon the list was  to go up and take his place.  None were to wander about the wood,  but all were to remain in readiness for any duty which might be  required. The two lieutenants were charged to drill them constantly  at their exercises so as to accustom them to the weight and handle  of their arms. Two were to be sent off every morning to the depot  where the provisions were issued, to draw food for the whole for  the day, and four were to be posted five miles away on the roads  leading towards the craigs to give warning of the approach of any  enemies. These were to be relieved every six hours. They were to  be entirely unarmed, and none were to issue from the camp with arms  except when specially ordered.    Having made these arrangements, and taking with him one of the band  as the first on duty above, he rejoined Wallace at his post on the  craigs.    Wallace's numbers now increased fast. On hearing of the fall of  Lanark, and on the receipt of the proclamation calling upon all  true Scotchmen to join him in his effort to deliver their country  from its yoke, the people began to flock in in great numbers. Richard  Wallace of Riccarton and Robert Boyd came in with such force as  they could collect from Kyle and Cunningham, among whom were not  less than 1000 horsemen. Sir John Grahame, Sir John of Tinto, and  Auchinleck assembled about 3000 mounted troops and a large number  of foot, many of whom, however,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/48"],[0,"The 1992 CIA World Factbook (#10)"],[1,"ntina's      external debt has nearly doubled to $58 billion, creating severe debt      servicing difficulties and hurting the country's creditworthiness with      international lenders.

In turn, Armenia had depended on supplies of raw materials      and energy from the other republics. Most of these supplies enter the      republic by rail through Azerbaijan (85%) and Georgia (15%). The economy has      been severely hurt by ethnic strife with Azerbaijan over control of the      Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, a mostly Armenian-populated enclave      within the national boundaries of Azerbaijan. In addition to outright      warfare, the strife has included interdiction of Armenian imports on the      Azerbaijani railroads and expensive airlifts of supplies to beleagured      Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. An earthquake in December 1988 destroyed      about one-tenth of industrial capacity and housing, the repair of which has      not been possible because the supply of funds and real resources has been      disrupted by the reorganization and subsequent dismantling of the central      USSR administrative apparatus. Among facilities made unserviceable by the      earthquake are the Yerevan nuclear power plant, which had supplied 40% of      Armenia's needs for electric power and a plant that produced one-quarter of      the output of elevators in the former USSR.
