Each burrow was connected to a  surface runway by a tunnel. Often the tunnel was short and the hole  opened almost directly into the burrow from the surface runway. Others  had tunnels several meters long. Jameson (1947:137) reported every  burrow to have two connections with the surface. In the present study,  however, I found three arrangements in approximately equal frequency of  occurrence: (1) one hole to one tunnel leading to a burrow; (2) two  holes to two short tunnels which joined a long tunnel leading to a  burrow; and (3) two separate tunnels from the surface to a burrow. The  size, depth and number of underground burrows in the systems that I  studied varied and so did those reported in the literature. Jameson  (_loc. cit._) found burrows in eastern Kansas as deep as 18 inches, far  deeper than any found in my study. Fisher (1945:435) reported none  deeper than five inches in central Missouri. The soil data in my study,  as well as in the two reports cited immediately above, were not adequate  to permit conclusions, but the type and condition of the soil probably  determine the extent of burrowing by the voles of any given locality.    The number of voles using a runway system at one time was difficult to  ascertain. In one system, however, four adult individuals were trapped  in a ten day period. In August, 1952, at the conclusion of the  live-trapping program, a runway system was mapped which had included two  trapping stations. In the preceding ten days, four adult voles (three  males and one female) had been taken in both traps. During that time,  therefore, the runway system was shared by at least four voles. The  voles used an area that was considerably larger than that encompassed by  any one runway system, a fact obvious when the sizes of home ranges as  computed from trapping data were compared with the sizes of the runway  systems mapped. A runway system seemed not to be a complete unit, but  was only a part of the network of runways used by a single individual.      Activity    Although no special investigation of activity was made, some conclusions  concerning it were apparent in the data gathered. There have been a few  laboratory studies of the activity pattern of _Microtus_ by various  methods. Calhoun (1945:256) reported _M. ochrogaster_ to be mainly  nocturnal with activity reaching a peak between dark and midnight and  again just before dawn. Davis (1933:235), working with _M. agrestis_,  and Hatfield (1935:263), working with _M. californicus_, both found  voles to be more nocturnal than diurnal. In a field study of _M.  pennsylvanicus_, Hatt (1930:534) found the species to be chiefly  nocturnal, although some activity was reported throughout the day.  Hamilton (1937c:256-259), however, reported the same species to be more  active in the daytime. Agreement on the activity patterns of these  species of _Microtus_ has not yet been attained.    From occasional changes in the time of tending a trap line, and from  running lines of traps at night a few times in the summer of 1951, I  gained the impression that these voles were primarily diurnal.  Relatively few of them were caught in the hours of darkness. In summer,  however, their activity was mostly limited to the periods between dawn  and approximately eight o'clock and between sunset and dark. In colder  weather, there was increased activity on sunny days.          PREDATION      Although voles were a common item of prey for many species of predators  on the Reservation, no marked effect on the density of the population of  this vole could be attributed to predation pressure. Only when densities  reached a point that caused many voles to expose themselves abnormally  could they be heavily preyed upon. Their normally secretive habits,  keeping them more or less out of sight, suggest that they are an  especially obvious illustration of the concept that predation is an  expression of population vulnerability, rising to high levels only when  a population is ecologically insecure, rather than a major factor  regulating population levels (Errington, 1935; 1936; 1943; Errington _et  al_, 1940).    Scats from predatory mammals and reptiles and pellets from raptorial  birds were examined. Most of these materials were collected by Dr. Henry  S. Fitch, who kindly granted permission to use them. The results of the  study of the scats and pellets are summarized in Table 5. Remains of  voles were identified in 28 per cent of the scats of the copperhead  snake (_Ancistrodon contortix_) examined. Copperheads were moderately  common on the Reservation (Fitch, 1952:24) and were probably important  as predators on voles in some habitats. Uhler _et al_ (1939:611), in  Virginia, reported voles to be the most important prey item for  copperheads. A vole was taken from the stomach of a rattlesnake  (_Crotalus horridus_) found dead on a county road adjoining the  Reservation. Rattlesnakes were present in small numbers on the  Reservation but were usually found along rocky ledges rather than in  areas where voles were common (Fitch, _loc. cit._). The rattlesnakes  probably were less important as predators on voles than on other small  mammals more common in the usual habitat of these snakes. The blue racer  (_Coluber constrictor_) was common in grassland situations on the  Reservation (Fitch, 1952:24) and twice was observed in the role of a  predator on voles; one small blue racer entered a live-trap in pursuit  of a vole and another blue racer was observed holding a captured vole in  its mouth. The blue racer seems well adapted to hunt voles and probably  preys on them extensively. The pilot black snake (_Elaphe obsoleta_) has  been reported as a predator on _M. ochrogaster_ in the neighboring state  of Missouri (Korschgen, 1952:60) and was moderately common on the  Reservation (Fitch, _loc. cit._). _M. pennsylvanicus_, with habits  similar to those of _M. ochrogaster_, has been reported as a prey for  all of the above snakes (Uhler, _et al_, 1939).

All four birds were fairly common  permanent residents on the Reservation (Fitch, 1952:25). The low density  and the strict territoriality of the red-tailed hawk (Fitch, _et al_,  1946:207) prevented it from exerting any important influence on the  population of voles, even though individual red-tailed hawks ate many  voles. Predation by the long-eared owl was especially heavy; remains of  voles were identified in 72 per cent of its pellets examined. Korschgen  (1952:39) found remains of voles in 70 per cent of 704 pellets of the  long-eared owl. The reason for the heavy diet of _Microtus_ seems to be  that both the owl and the vole are especially active at dusk. A group of  long-eared owls, living near the edge of Quarry Field, probably exerted  an influence on the density of the local population of voles because of  the high ratio of predator to prey animals. The crows ate some, and  perhaps most, of their voles after the animals had died from other  causes. Other birds, mostly raptors, occurring in northeastern Kansas  and reported to prey on voles include the sharp-shinned hawk (_Accipiter  striatus_), Cooper's hawk (_A. cooperi_), red-shouldered hawk (_Buteo  lineatus_), broad-winged hawk (_B. platypterus_), American rough-legged  hawk (_B. lagopus_), ferruginous rough-legged hawk (_B. regalis_), marsh  hawk (_Circus cyaneus_), barn owl (_Tyto alba_), screech owl (_Otus  asio_), barred owl (_Strix varia_) and shrike (_Lanius excubitor_)  (Korschgen, 1952:26; 28; 34; 35; 37; McAtee, 1935:9-27; Wooster,  1936:396).    Coyotes, house cats and raccoons were identified as predators on voles  in the study areas. Remains of voles were present in 12 per cent of the  scats of the coyote (_Canis latrans_) examined. In Missouri, Korschgen  (1952:40-43) reported remains of voles in slightly more than 20 per cent  of the coyote stomachs that he examined. Fitch (1948:74), Hatt  (1930:559) and others have reported other species of _Microtus_ as eaten  by the coyote. Although coyotes were rarely seen on the Reservation,  coyote sign was abundant (Fitch, 1952:29) and coyotes probably ate large  numbers of voles. House cats (_Felis domesticus_), seemingly feral, were  observed to tour the trap lines on several occasions and were noted by  Fitch (_loc. cit._) as important predators on small vertebrates. Four  cats were killed in the course of the study and remains of voles were  found in the stomachs of all of them. On several occasions, raccoon  tracks were noted following the trap line when the traps had been  overturned and broken open, suggesting that raccoons are not averse to  eating voles although no further evidence of predation on voles by  raccoons was obtained. Fitch (_loc. cit._) reported raccoons (_Procyon  lotor_) to be moderately common on the Reservation. Reports of predation  by raccoons on voles are numerous (Hatt, 1930:554;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39421"],[0,"Mount Everest, the Reconnaissance, 1921 (#10)"],[1,"temple,  after which the head Lama accompanied us some way down the path to say  good-bye, hoping we would come and see them again on our return.    I have alluded several times to the hot springs at Kambu. These springs  are two days' journey from Yatung up the Kambu Valley, but can also be  reached quite easily from Phari. There is a curious account of these  springs written by an old Lama and translated by Major Campbell. The  writer describes the Upper Kambu Valley as quite a pleasant spot where  cooling streams and medicinal plants are found in abundance. Medicinal  waters of five kinds flow from the rocks, forming twelve pools, the  waters of which are efficacious in curing the 440 diseases to which the  human race is subject. The springs are then made to describe their own  qualities in the first person:--      1. THE LHAMO SPRING (The Spring of the Goddess): My virtue is derived    from the essence of stone--I am guarded by the Goddess Tsering, and my    virtue therefore consists in purging the sins and obscurities of the    human body. Those who bathe first in my waters will be purged of all    sin and the power of all diseases will be abated.      2. THE CHAGU SPRING (The Spring of the Vulture): My virtue is derived    from black sulphur. As regards my properties, a vulture with a broken    wing once fell into my waters and was healed. I benefit diseases of    women, also sores, gout and fractures. I possess particular virtue for    all diseases below the waist. I do not benefit neuralgia, nervous    diseases, or loss of appetite.      3 and 4. THE PON SPRINGS (The Springs of the Official): We two    brothers derive our properties from both yellow and black sulphur.    One of us provokes catarrh, while the other allays it. A learned man,    who wished us well, once said that we were beneficial in cases of    hemorrhoids, kidney diseases and rheumatism. We are not aware of    possessing these qualities, and rather tend to cause harm in such    cases.      5. THE TRAGGYE SPRING (The Spring born of the Rock): My virtue is    derived from a combination of sulphur and the essence of stone. I was    formerly efficacious in cases of diseases of the arteries and nerve    trouble, but later on the Brothers of the Pon Spring rushed down on    poor me like tyrants so that no one now regards me. The caretaker of    the Springs and visitors treats me like a beggar and pays no attention    to me. Even now if some person with the permission of the Brothers of    the Pon Spring would carry out some repairs, so as to separate my    waters from theirs, I would guarantee to benefit those suffering from    arterial diseases, nerve trouble, impurities of the blood and bile.      6. THE SERKA SPRING (The Spring of the Crevice): My virtues are    derived from sulphur and carbon. I am not beneficial to those    suffering from ailments arising from nerve trouble, bile and acidity.    I am beneficial to those suffering from chapped hands and feet due to    hard work among earth and stones and also in cases of diseases of the    kidneys and bladder. I am somewhat hurtful to those suffering from    headache arising from nervous catarrh, or impurities of the blood.      7. THE TANG SPRING (The Spring of the Plain): My virtues are derived    from carbon and a little sulphur. I am beneficial in cases of    hemorrhoids, kidney disease, rheumatism and other diseases below the    waist, also in cases of venereal disease. There is a danger of the    waist becoming bent like a bow through too much bathing in my waters.      8. THE TRAGGYAB SPRING (The Spring behind the Rock): I am beneficial    in cases of disease of the arteries and anaemia--I am not aware that    I am harmful in other cases.      9. THE TONGBU SPRING (The Spring of the Hole): My virtues are derived    from a large proportion of crystalline stone and a little sulphur. I    guarantee to be beneficial in cases of white phlegm, brown phlegm and    other forms of phlegmatic disease. Also in diseases arising out of    these, and in cases of impurities of the blood and colic pains. Please    bear this in mind.      10. THE NUB (The Western Spring): My virtues are derived from a little    carbon. I am beneficial in cases of liver disease, impurities of the    blood, flatulence, kidney disease, dyspepsia, brown phlegm, tumours,    gout, rheumatism, gleet, and complications arising from these. I do not    boast in the way that the other Springs do.      11. THE DZEPO SPRING (The Leper's Spring): I am cousin to the Western    Spring. He guarantees to cure diseases arising from two or three causes,    also kidney disease, flat foot, rheumatism and gout. I am beneficial in    cases of hemorrhoids, gout, rheumatism and diseases of the feet. I    possess particular virtue in cases of leprosy, sores and wounds.      12. THE LAMA SPRING (The Spring of the Lama): My virtues are derived    from a large proportion of lime and a little sulphur. I am beneficial    in cases of lung disease, tumours, dyspepsia, both chronic and recent,    poverty of the blood and venereal diseases.

COPIED BY TENRAB, CLEARLY AND EXACTLY, FROM THE ORIGINAL IN THE MALE          IRON DOG YEAR IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE EARTH MONTH.    After leaving the monastery we had a pleasant gallop across the  Lingmatang Plain, after which the valley narrowed again and the path  followed close beside the rushing stream. It was a delightful ride  through forests of birch, larch, juniper, spruce, silver fir and  mountain ash. Never anywhere have I seen birch trees grow to such a  size. They were grand rugged old trees that matched the rugged scenery  of the gorge. Blue poppies, fritillaries, ground orchids and  sweet-scented primulas grew along the path, and mixed up everywhere in  the forest were great bushes of _R. Cinnabarinum_, which varied in shade  from yellow and orange to deep red. Wagtails and white-crested redstarts  dodged about from rock to rock in the rushing stream, and the clear note  of the shrike could usually be heard above the noise of the waters. The  weather had luckily kept fine all day, so that we were able to dawdle  along and enjoy the scenery and flowers.    After going about 12 miles we came to the bungalow of Gautsa, situated  at a height of about 12,000 feet, and at the bottom of the gorge; here  we spent the night. During the night there was heavy rain, and when we  woke in the morning, fresh snow was low down on all the hills and within  1,500 feet of the bungalow. However, the day again proved brilliantly  fine. For breakfast we had been given some large wild-goose eggs  belonging to the bar-headed goose. Mine I had boiled, and found  excellent, though one was sufficient for a meal. Two that the others had  were rather _passe_, and were not equally appreciated. The day's path  was at first very stony and climbed steadily uphill beside the torrent  of the Ammo-chu. Pale blue iris, yellow primulas, a pink viburnum and a  large yellow-belled lonicera grew beside the path, but the rhododendrons  were still by far the most wonderful of the flowering shrubs. We passed  many big blue meconopsis, and some of these flowers measured fully 3  inches across. Dwarf rhododendrons, only a foot high--some pure white  and others pink, continued up until about 13,500 feet, and then the  hillsides became purple from another little rhododendron, which looked  in the distance like heather and gave the rounded hills quite a Scotch  appearance. As we rose higher the flowers decreased in number. Larks and  wheatears ran along the ground in front of us, and small tailless marmot  rats dodged in and out of their holes as we approached. The distance  from Goutsa to Phari was about 16 miles, of which the last 8 miles were  over flat country with a springy turf, on which it was a pleasure to be  able to canter again after having passed over so many miles of stony  roads. Chomolhari, the Mountain of the Goddess, stood up as a wonderful  sight with its sharp peak outlined against the clear blue sky. On its  summit the wind was evidently very strong, as we could see the fresh  snow being whirled off in clouds.    Phari is an extremely dirty village dominated by a stone fort and lying  under the shadow of the great mountain Chomolhari, 23,930 feet high. It  is 14,300 feet above sea level, and the climate there is always cold, as  it is never without a strong wind. In the afternoon the Jongpen, or  Governor of the district, came to call on me. He was a young man with an  intelligent and pleasant face, and came from the country between Khamba  Dzong and Shekar Dzong, so that he was able to give us much useful  information about the road; he promised that he would write to his  brother, who was acting as agent for him at his home, telling him to  entertain us and give us all facilities in the matters of transport and  supplies. He told us that he had received written instructions from the  Lhasa Government to arrange for supplies and transport for us, and he  promised that he would do his best. I gave him photographs that I had  taken last year of his fort, and also of Chomolhari; these pleased him  very much, and in return he presented us with a dried sheep which looked  mummified and smelt very strongly, but which proved very acceptable to  our coolies. It was necessary to stop here for several days as the  second party had to catch up, and they too needed a day's rest. Also the  transport that was to carry us along to Khamba Dzong would not be ready  for several days, so the following morning I went to call on the  Jongpen in his fort, where I found him living in some very dark rooms. I  presented him with one of the new lever electric torches, which he much  appreciated, though at first he and his servants were rather frightened  by it. He gave us tea and sweetmeats, and soon afterwards"]]]
