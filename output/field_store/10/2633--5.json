But it will be well to dwell a little longer on, and to bring out more  clearly, the point that woman's moral ideals are personal and  domestic, as distinguished from impersonal and public.    Let us note in this connexion that it would be difficult to conceive  of a woman who had become deaf to the appeal of personal and domestic  morality making it a matter of _amour propre_ to respond to a call of  public morality; and difficult to conceive of a woman recovering lost  self-respect by fulfilling such an obligation.    But one knows that woman will rise and respond to the call of any  strong human or transcendental personal affection.    Again, it is only a very exceptional woman who would, when put to her  election between the claims of a narrow and domestic and a wider or  public morality, subordinate the former to the latter.    In ordinary life, at any rate, one finds her following in such a case  the suggestions of domestic--I had almost called it animal--morality.    It would be difficult to find any one who would trust a woman to be  just to the rights of others in the case where the material interests  of her children, or of a devoted husband, were involved. And even to  consider the question of being in such a case intellectually just to  any one who came into competition with personal belongings like  husband and child would, of course, lie quite beyond the moral horizon  of ordinary woman.    It is not only the fact that the ideals of abstract justice and truth  would inevitably be brushed aside by woman in the interests of those  she loves which comes into consideration here; it is also the fact  that woman is almost without a moral sense in the matter of executing  a public trust such as voting or attaching herself to a political  association with a view to influencing votes.    There is between man and woman here a characteristic difference.    While it is, of course, not a secret to anybody that the baser sort of  man can at any time be diverted from the path of public morality by a  monetary bribe or other personal advantage, he will not, at any rate,  set at naught all public morality by doing so for a peppercorn. He  will, for instance, not join, for the sake of a daughter, a political  movement in which he has no belief; nor vote for this or that  candidate just to please a son; or censure a member of Parliament who  has in voting on female suffrage failed to consider the predilections  of his wife.    But woman, whether she be politically enfranchised as in Australasia,  or unenfranchised as at home; whether she be immoral in the sense of  being purely egoistic, or moral in the sense of being altruistic, very  rarely makes any secret or any shame of doing these things.    In this matter one would not be very far from the truth if one alleged  that there are no good women, but only women who have lived under the  influence of good men.    Even more serious than this postponement of public to private morality  is the fact that even reputedly ethical women will, in the interests  of what they take to be idealistic causes, violate laws which are  universally accepted as being of moral obligation.    I here pass over the recent epidemic of political crime among women to  advert to the want of conscience which permits, in connexion with  professedly idealistic causes, not only misrepresentations, but the  making of deliberately false statements on matters of public concern.    It is, for example, an illustration of the profoundly different moral  atmospheres in which men and women live that when a public woman  recently made, for what was to her an idealistic purpose, a  deliberately false statement of fact in _The Times_, she quite naively  confessed to it, seeing nothing whatever amiss in her action.    And it did not appear that any other woman suffragist could discern  any kind of immorality in it. The worst thing they could find to say  was that it perhaps was a little _gauche_ to confess to making a  deliberately false statement on a public question when it was for the  moment particularly desirable that woman should show up to best  advantage before the eyes of man.    We may now for a moment put aside the question of woman's public  morality and consider a question which is inextricably mixed up with  the question of the admission of woman to the suffrage. This is the  mental attitude and the programme of the female legislative reformer.      IV    MENTAL OUTLOOK AND PROGRAMME OF THE FEMALE LEGISLATIVE REFORMER    The suffragist woman, when she is the kind of woman who piques herself  upon her ethical impulses, will, even when she is intellectually very  poorly equipped, and there is no imprint of altruism upon her life,  assure you that nothing except the moral influence of woman, exerted  through the legislation, which her practical mind would be capable of  initiating, will ever avail to abate existing social evils, and to  effect the moral redemption of the world.    It will not be amiss first to try to introduce a little clearness and  order into our ideas upon those formidably difficult problems which  the female legislative reformer desires to attack, and then to  consider how a rational reforming mind would go to work in the matter  of proposing legislation for these.    _First_ would come those evils which result from individuals seeking  advantage to themselves by the direct infliction of injury upon  others. Violations of the criminal law and the various forms of  sweating and fleecing one's fellow-men come under this category.    _Then_ would come the evils which arise out of purveying physiological  and psychological refreshments and excitements, which are, according  as they are indulged in temperately or intemperately, grateful and  innocuous, or sources of disaster and ruin. The evils which are  associated with the drink traffic and the betting industry are typical  examples.    _Finally,_ there would come into consideration the evils of death or  physical suffering deliberately inflicted by man upon man with a view  to preventing worse evils. The evil of war would come under this  category. In this same category might also come the much lesser evil  of punitive measures inflicted upon criminals. And with this might be  coupled the evil of killing and inflicting physical suffering upon  animals for the advantage of man.    We may now consider how the rational legislative reformer would in  each case go to work.    He would not start with the assumption that it _must_ be possible by  some alteration of the law to abolish or conspicuously reduce any of  the afore-mentioned evils; nor yet with the assumption that, if a  particular alteration of the law would avail to bring about this  result, that alteration ought necessarily to be made. He would  recognise that many things which are theoretically desirable are  unattainable; and that many legislative measures which could perfectly  well be enforced would be barred by the fact that they would entail  deplorable unintended consequences.    The rational legislator whom we have here in view would accordingly  always take expert advice as to whether the desired object could be  achieved by legal compulsion; and as to whether a projected law which  satisfied the condition of being workable would give a balance of  advantages over disadvantages.    In connexion with a proposal for the prevention of sweating he would,  for instance, take expert advice as to whether its provisions could be  enforced; and whether, if enforceable, they would impose added  hardships on any class of employees or penalties on any innocent class  of employers.    In like manner in connexion with a proposed modification in criminal  procedure, the rational reformer would defer to the expert on the  question as to whether such modification would secure greater  certainty of punishment for the guilty without increasing the risk of  convicting the innocent.    In connexion with the second category of evils--the category under  which would come those of drinking and betting--the rational  legislative reformer would recognise the complete impracticability of  abolishing by legislative prohibition physiological indulgences and  the evils which sometimes attend upon them.    He would consider instead whether these attendant evils could be  reduced by making the regulating laws more stringent; and whether more  stringent restrictions--in addition to the fact that they would filch  from the all too small stock of human happiness--would not, by paving  the way for further invasions of personal liberty, cripple the free  development of the community.    On the former question, which only experts could properly answer, the  reasonable reformer would defer to their advice. The answer to the  last question he would think out for himself.    In connexion with the evils which are deliberately inflicted by man  with a view to reaping either personal profit, or profit for the  nation, or profit for humanity, the reasonable reformer would begin by  making clear to himself that the world we live in is not such a world  as idealism might conjure up, but a world of violence, in which life  must be taken and physical suffering be inflicted.    And he would recognise that the vital material interests of the nation  can be protected only by armed force; that civilisation can be  safeguarded only by punishing violations of the criminal law; and that  the taking of animal life and the infliction of a certain amount of  physical suffering upon animals is essential to human well-being,  comfort, and recreation; and essential also to the achievement of the  knowledge which is required to combat disease.    And the reasonable reformer will, in conformity with this, direct his  efforts, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51854"],[0,"The Rat Race (#10)"],[1,"nothing we could talk about that I wouldn't want her  to hear.\"    The G-Man looked as though he was worrying over whether he ought to  call Washington for permission. They hadn't taught him this one in  the F.B.I. academy of finger-printing, marksmanship, shadowing and  wire-tapping.    \"By the way, Mr. Harcourt,\" I added, \"I just learned as I came in that  you've been waiting for me since ten this morning. It's after three now  so I took the liberty of sending out for a sandwich and some coffee for  you. I thought you might like a bite of lunch while you are talking  with me.\"    The Special Agent looked as surprised as though he had found Hoover's  fingerprints on the murder-gun, but he nodded gamely.    \"Here it is now,\" I remarked, as there was a knock on the door and  a knowing-looking boy placed an appealing tray-load of sandwiches,  pickles and coffee in front of Mr. Harcourt.    \"Now you go right ahead and eat your lunch,\" I urged. \"Ask me for any  information in my possession and you shall have it. And of course  I'll have Miss Briggs send a complete transcript of our talk to you  at F.B.I. headquarters by registered mail. First of all, if you don't  mind, would you show me your official identification and let Miss  Briggs take down the number and so on. It's always best to put these  things in the record, isn't it?\"    The G-Man gulped and produced a battered identity card, complete with  fingerprints, number, Hoover's signature and a photograph which would  have justified his immediate arrest on suspicion of bank-robbery.    \"I imagine, Mr. Harcourt,\" I remarked, \"that you've had plenty of time  in the last five hours to question members of my staff about whatever  it is you think they might know about my business.\"    He looked up, almost pathetically. \"I asked a few questions,\" he  admitted. \"This is just an informal inquiry. Nothing for Grand Jury  action--yet.\"    I didn't like that last word.    \"Do you think I ought to call my lawyer in before I proceed with our  talk?\" I asked. \"I resent your reference to Grand Jury action. So far,  I don't even know what you wish to see me about and you have just made  a libelous statement in front of a reliable witness. Is that the way J.  Edgar Hoover trains his Gestapo?\"    \"I--well--\"    \"Come on, Harcourt, let's get on with it!\" I interrupted. \"I'm a busy  man and you've wasted five hours of the time my taxes help to pay for,  just waiting to take more of my time.\"    He pulled a black leather notebook out of his pocket and consulted it.    \"The Bureau was asked to interrogate you, Mr. Tompkins, on behalf of  another government agency.\"    \"Which? Internal Revenue? W.P.B.? The S.E.C?\"    \"No sir, it was none of those. I'm not at liberty to tell you which  one. I am simply instructed to ask you what you know about U.S.S.  Alaska and naval dispositions in the North Pacific.\"    I leaned back and laughed. \"Now I get it,\" I said. \"That's O.N.I, and  that triple-plated ass, Ranty Tolan, trying to win the war in the  barrooms of New York. It all goes back to a dream I had while I was  dozing at the Pond Club Monday afternoon. Something about the U.S.S.  Alaska being blown up off the Aleutians. Tolan was there when I woke up  and I passed a few remarks about my dream before I was fully awake, if  you know what I mean. That's all there is to it, Mr. Harcourt.\"    The Special Agent made a number of hen-tracks in his notebook.    \"Thank you very much, Mr. Tompkins,\" he said. \"No doubt you'll be able  to explain things if my chief wants to call you in. I don't think my  chief believes in dreams. Not that kind of dream. Not in war-time.\"    I laughed again. \"I'm afraid I can't help that. So far as I am  concerned, the F.B.I. can believe in my dream or stick it in the files.\"    Harcourt coughed. \"It's not easy working with O.N.I, or other  intelligence outfits,\" he said. \"They never tell us anything. The  trouble with your dream seems to be that the general public isn't  supposed to know that the U.S.S. Alaska is in commission and that the  Navy department has had no word from her since last Saturday.\"    \"Don't let that worry you,\" I said. \"If she was anywhere near the  Kuriles, she'd keep radio silence, specially off Paramushiro.\"    \"Oh!\" Harcourt remarked. \"O.N.I. didn't say anything about Paramushiro.  Thank you, Mr. Tompkins. We'll be in touch with you, off and on.\"    He rose, very politely, shook hands again, thanked me for the food,  nodded to Miss Briggs and made a definitely Grade A exit.    His steps died away down the corridor. Miss Briggs waited until he  was out of earshot then turned to me. \"You God damned fool!\" she said  fondly. \"You had him bluffed until you talked about Paramushiro. Why  did you admit anything?\"    I looked up at her broad, pleasant face.    \"So you've made a monkey out of me. I alibied you up and down. Listen,  Winnie, the F.B.I. have been all over the joint since early yesterday.  We were warned not to whisper a word to you. There was an agent waiting  to grill me when I got home last night. I told him you'd been spending  the week-end with me.\"    \"You told him--\" I was startled.    \"Sure! Why not? He wasn't interested in my morals. I told him about our  place up in the fifties and gave you a complete alibi from Friday close  of business until Monday noon. And now you have to make like a Nazi  with the ships in the Pacific. Say, what is it you've supposed to have  done--kissed MacArthur?\"    \"Damned if I know, Miss Briggs. That's part of the trouble.\"    \"Lay off that 'Miss Briggs' stuff. That was to punish you for giving  me the fish-eye when you came in. I'm your Arthurjean and the market's  closed so you'd better catch the subway uptown with me and I'll cook  you a steak dinner at our place.\"    This was too deep water for hesitation, so I took the plunge. Taking  my hat and coat I told the genteel receptionist that I'd be back in  the morning. I waited for Arthurjean at the foot of the elevators and  followed her lead, into the East Side subway and up to the 51st Street  station, on to \"our place.\"    It was very discreet--an old brown-stone front converted into small  apartments. There was no door-man and an automatic elevator prevented  any intrusive check on the comings and goings of the tenants. The  third-floor front had been made into a pleasant little two-room  suite--a \"master's bedroom\" (Why not 'mistress's?' I thought) with a  double-bed, dresser and chairs, and an array of ducks which revealed  the true Tompkins touch. There was a small sitting-dining room as  well, and a kitchenette with a satisfactory array of bottles in the  Frigidaire and a reasonable amount of groceries.    Arthurjean took off her hat and coat, fixed me a good stiff drink and  then disappeared into the bathroom. After a good deal of splashing and  gurgling, she reappeared clad in maroon satin pyjamas.    \"There,\" she said, \"now I feel better.\"    I smiled at her. \"Here's to Arthurjean!\" I said.    \"Nuts to Arthurjean,\" she replied. \"How about Winnie? You've always  been swell to me, and you know it. I don't care if you're a louse or  a souse. You can always come to me any time you're in trouble and  I'll fix you up. Now you're in trouble with the cops, so how about me  helping you? Huh?\"    \"You're a good kid,\" I said truthfully, for Arthurjean was indeed one  of God's own sweet tarts. \"The truth is I'm in all kinds of a jam. You  see, I can't seem to remember what I've been doing before last Monday.  It's sort of like loss of memory, only worse. This F.B.I. thing is only  one of my headaches.\"    She looked at me questioningly. \"So you don't remember where you were  before Monday?\" she asked. She slouched across the room, leaned down  and gave me a hearty kiss. \"Will that help you remember? It was like  I told that detective. You and me were right here in this place over  Easter and don't forget it.\"    I sighed. I liked Arthurjean, though she was as corned-beef and cabbage  to Germaine's caviar and champagne. \"Okay,\" I said. \"I won't forget it.\"    \"Attaboy!\" she agreed. \"Now that we've got that settled, suppose you  tell me where the hell you really were over the week-end. You stood me  up Friday night and today's the first time I've set eyes on you since  you left the office Friday morning. Boy, you may have some explaining  to do to the F.B.I., but it's nothing to what you got to explain to  momma.\"          CHAPTER 8      \"And so, Arthurjean,\" I concluded, \"my guess is that for some crazy  reason it's up to me to take up where Winnie left off and try to do a  good job with the hand he's dealt himself.\"    She remained silent, hunched on the floor beside me, with her maroon  pyjamas straining visibly and a pile of cigarette butts in the  ash-tray at her side.    \"Give me a break,\" I pleaded. \"When I tried to tell my wife--Winnie's  wife--Mrs. Tompkins, that is--all she could think of was to send me off  to a plush-lined booby-hatch until I was sane again. The others--at  least Virginia Rutherford--are beginning to suspect that something is  wrong and that damned dog knows it. So be original and pretend that I  might be telling the truth.\"    She didn't answer. Instead, she stood up, stretched, strolled over to  the kitchenette and mixed us both two good stiff drinks.    \"Mud in your eye!\" she said.    \"Glad to see you on board!\"    \"I don't see why not,\" she observed conversationally. \"I don't pretend  to be smart and I know that the other girls in the office think I'm  nothing but a tramp because I don't pretend I don't like men, but I'm  damned if I think that Winnie, who is one of God's sweetest dumb-bells,  could have dreamed up anything as screwy as this.\"    \"As I remember him, he wasn't any too bright,\" I said.    \"Skip it! He wasn't dumb in business. He picked up a couple of million  bucks and gave them a good home in his safe-deposit box. He wasn't so  hot on music and books and art--except for his damned ducks--but"]]]
