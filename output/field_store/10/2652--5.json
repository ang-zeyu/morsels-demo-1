[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/560"],[0,"Mr. Standfast (#10)"],[1," was home last I  was officially anti-war, when I wasn't stretched upon a bed of pain. Mr  Moxon Ivery don't take any stock in John S. Blenkiron as a serious  proposition. And while I've been here I've been so low down in the  social scale and working in so many devious ways that he can't connect  me up ... As I was saying, we've cut most of his wires, but the biggest  we haven't got at. He's still sending stuff out, and mighty  compromising stuff it is. Now listen close, Dick, for we're coming near  your own business.'    It appeared that Blenkiron had reason to suspect that the channel still  open had something to do with the North. He couldn't get closer than  that, till he heard from his people that a certain Abel Gresson had  turned up in Glasgow from the States. This Gresson he discovered was  the same as one Wrankester, who as a leader of the Industrial Workers  of the World had been mixed up in some ugly cases of sabotage in  Colorado. He kept his news to himself, for he didn't want the police to  interfere, but he had his own lot get into touch with Gresson and  shadow him closely. The man was very discreet but very mysterious, and  he would disappear for a week at a time, leaving no trace. For some  unknown reason--he couldn't explain why--Blenkiron had arrived at the  conclusion that Gresson was in touch with Ivery, so he made experiments  to prove it.    'I wanted various cross-bearings to make certain, and I got them the  night before last. My visit to Biggleswick was good business.'    'I don't know what they meant,' I said, 'but I know where they came in.  One was in your speech when you spoke of the Austrian socialists, and  Ivery took you up about them. The other was after supper when he quoted  the _Wiener Zeitung_.'    'You're no fool, Dick,' he said, with his slow smile. 'You've hit the  mark first shot. You know me and you could follow my process of thought  in those remarks. Ivery, not knowing me so well, and having his head  full of just that sort of argument, saw nothing unusual. Those bits of  noos were pumped into Gresson that he might pass them on. And he did  pass them on--to Ivery. They completed my chain.'    'But they were commonplace enough things which he might have guessed  for himself.'    'No, they weren't. They were the nicest tit-bits of political noos  which all the cranks have been reaching after.'    'Anyhow, they were quotations from German papers. He might have had the  papers themselves earlier than you thought.'    'Wrong again. The paragraph never appeared in the _Wiener Zeitung_. But  we faked up a torn bit of that noospaper, and a very pretty bit of  forgery it was, and Gresson, who's a kind of a scholar, was allowed to  have it. He passed it on. Ivery showed it me two nights ago. Nothing  like it ever sullied the columns of Boche journalism. No, it was a  perfectly final proof ... Now, Dick, it's up to you to get after  Gresson.'    'Right,' I said. 'I'm jolly glad I'm to start work again. I'm getting  fat from lack of exercise. I suppose you want me to catch Gresson out  in some piece of blackguardism and have him and Ivery snugly put away.'    'I don't want anything of the kind,' he said very slowly and  distinctly. 'You've got to attend very close to your instructions, I  cherish these two beauties as if they were my own white-headed boys. I  wouldn't for the world interfere with their comfort and liberty. I want  them to go on corresponding with their friends. I want to give them  every facility.'    He burst out laughing at my mystified face.    'See here, Dick. How do we want to treat the Boche? Why, to fill him up  with all the cunningest lies and get him to act on them. Now here is  Moxon Ivery, who has always given them good information. They trust him  absolutely, and we would be fools to spoil their confidence. Only, if  we can find out Moxon's methods, we can arrange to use them ourselves  and send noos in his name which isn't quite so genooine. Every word he  dispatches goes straight to the Grand High Secret General Staff, and  old Hindenburg and Ludendorff put towels round their heads and cipher  it out. We want to encourage them to go on doing it. We'll arrange to  send true stuff that don't matter, so as they'll continue to trust him,  and a few selected falsehoods that'll matter like hell. It's a game you  can't play for ever, but with luck I propose to play it long enough to  confuse Fritz's little plans.'    His face became serious and wore the air that our corps commander used  to have at the big pow-wow before a push.    'I'm not going to give you instructions, for you're man enough to make  your own. But I can give you the general hang of the situation. You  tell Ivery you're going North to inquire into industrial disputes at  first hand. That will seem to him natural and in line with your recent  behaviour. He'll tell his people that you're a guileless colonial who  feels disgruntled with Britain, and may come in useful. You'll go to a  man of mine in Glasgow, a red-hot agitator who chooses that way of  doing his bit for his country. It's a darned hard way and darned  dangerous. Through him you'll get in touch with Gresson, and you'll  keep alongside that bright citizen. Find out what he is doing, and get  a chance of following him. He must never suspect you, and for that  purpose you must be very near the edge of the law yourself. You go up  there as an unabashed pacifist and you'll live with folk that will turn  your stomach. Maybe you'll have to break some of these two-cent rules  the British Government have invented to defend the realm, and it's up  to you not to get caught out ... Remember, you'll get no help from me.  You've got to wise up about Gresson with the whole forces of the  British State arrayed officially against you. I guess it's a steep  proposition, but you're man enough to make good.'    As we shook hands, he added a last word. 'You must take your own time,  but it's not a case for slouching. Every day that passes Ivery is  sending out the worst kind of poison. The Boche is blowing up for a big  campaign in the field, and a big effort to shake the nerve and confuse  the judgement of our civilians. The whole earth's war-weary, and we've  about reached the danger-point. There's pretty big stakes hang on you,  Dick, for things are getting mighty delicate.'                *       *       *       *       *    I purchased a new novel in the shop and reached St Pancras in time to  have a cup of tea at the buffet. Ivery was at the bookstall buying an  evening paper. When we got into the carriage he seized my _Punch_ and  kept laughing and calling my attention to the pictures. As I looked at  him, I thought that he made a perfect picture of the citizen turned  countryman, going back of an evening to his innocent home. Everything  was right--his neat tweeds, his light spats, his spotted neckcloth, and  his Aquascutum.    Not that I dared look at him much. What I had learned made me eager to  search his face, but I did not dare show any increased interest. I had  always been a little off-hand with him, for I had never much liked him,  so I had to keep on the same manner. He was as merry as a grig, full of  chat and very friendly and amusing. I remember he picked up the book I  had brought off that morning to read in the train--the second volume of  Hazlitt's _Essays_, the last of my English classics--and discoursed so  wisely about books that I wished I had spent more time in his company  at Biggleswick.    'Hazlitt was the academic Radical of his day,' he said. 'He is always  lashing himself into a state of theoretical fury over abuses he has  never encountered in person. Men who are up against the real thing save  their breath for action.'    That gave me my cue to tell him about my journey to the North. I said I  had learned a lot in Biggleswick, but I wanted to see industrial life  at close quarters. 'Otherwise I might become like Hazlitt,' I said.    He was very interested and encouraging. 'That's the right way to set  about it,' he said. 'Where were you thinking of going?'    I told him that I had half thought of Barrow, but decided to try  Glasgow, since the Clyde seemed to be a warm corner.    'Right,' he said. 'I only wish I was coming with you. It'll take you a  little while to understand the language. You'll find a good deal of  senseless bellicosity among the workmen, for they've got parrot-cries  about the war as they used to have parrot-cries about their labour  politics. But there's plenty of shrewd brains and sound hearts too. You  must write and tell me your conclusions.'    It was a warm evening and he dozed the last part of the journey. I  looked at him and wished I could see into the mind at the back of that  mask-like face. I counted for nothing in his eyes, not even enough for  him to want to make me a tool, and I was setting out to try to make a  tool of him. It sounded a forlorn enterprise. And all the while I was  puzzled with a persistent sense of recognition. I told myself it was  idiocy, for a man with a face like that must have hints of resemblance  to a thousand people. But the idea kept nagging at me till we reached  our destination.    As we emerged from the station into the golden evening I saw Mary  Lamington again. She was with one of the Weekes girls, and after the  Biggleswick fashion was bareheaded, so that the sun glinted from her  hair. Ivery swept his hat off and made her a pretty speech, while I  faced her steady eyes with the expressionlessness of the stage  conspirator.    'A charming child,' he observed as we passed on. 'Not without a touch  of seriousness, too, which may yet be touched to noble issues.'    I considered, as I made my way to my final supper with the Jimsons,  that the said child was likely to prove a sufficiently serious business  for Mr Moxon Ivery before the game was out.        CHAPTER FOUR    Andrew Amos    I took the train three days later from King's Cross to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5605"],[0,"The Power of Movement in Plants (#10)"],[1,"nine times in the course of 14 ½ h. It swept a  large, extremely irregular, circular figure, returning at night to nearly  the same spot whence it had started early in the morning. The line was so  strongly zigzag that it apparently represented five ellipses, with their  longer axes pointing in various directions. With respect to the periodical  movements of the cotyledons, those of several young seedlings formed  together at 4 P.M. an angle of about 60o, and at 10 P.M. their lower parts  stood vertically and were in contact; their tips, however, as is usual in  the genus, were permanently reflexed. These cotyledons, at 7 A.M. on the  following morning, were again well expanded.    Lagenaria vulgaris (var. miniature Bottle-gourd) (Cucurbitaceae).--A  seedling opened its cotyledons, the movements of which were alone observed,  slightly on June 27th and closed them at night: next day, at noon (28th),  they included an angle of 53o, and at 10 P.M. they were in close contact,  so that each had risen 26 1/2o. At noon, on the 29th, they included an  angle of 118o, and at 10 P.M. an angle of 54o, so each had risen 32o. On the  following day they were still more open, and the nocturnal rise was  greater, but the angles were not measured. Two other seedlings were  observed, and behaved during three days in a closely similar manner. The  cotyledons, therefore,  [page 43]  open more and more on each succeeding day, and rise each night about 30o;  consequently during the first two nights of their life they stand  vertically and come into contact.    Fig. 30. Lagenaria vulgaris: circumnutation of a cotyledon, 1 ½ inch in  length, apex only 4 3/4 inches from the vertical glass, on which its  movements were traced from 7.35 A.M. July 11th to 9.5 A.M. on the 14th.  Figure here given reduced to one-third of original scale.    In order to ascertain more accurately the nature of these movements, the  hypocotyl of a seedling, with its cotyledons well expanded, was secured to  a little stick, and a filament with triangles of paper was affixed to one  of the cotyledons. The observations were made under a rather dim skylight,  and the temperature during the whole time was between 17 1/2o to 18o C. (63o  to 65o F.). Had the temperature been higher and the light brighter, the  movements would probably have been greater. On July 11th (see Fig. 30), the  cotyledon fell from 7.35 A.M. till 10 A.M.; it then rose (rapidly after 4  P.M.) till it stood quite vertically at 8.40 P.M. During the early morning  of the next day (12th) it fell, and continued to fall till 8 A.M., after  which hour it rose, then fell, and again rose, so that by 10.35 P.M. it  stood much higher than it did in the morning, but was not vertical as on  the preceding night. During the following early morning and whole day  (13th) it fell and circumnutated, but had not risen when observed late in  the evening; and this was probably due to the deficiency of heat or light,  or of both. We thus see that the cotyledons became more widely open at noon  on each succeeding day; and that they rose considerably each night, though  not acquiring a vertical position, except during the first two nights.    Cucumis dudaim (Cucurbitaceae).--Two seedlings had opened  [page 44]  their cotyledons for the first time during the day,--one to the extent of  90o and the other rather more; they remained in nearly the same position  until 10.40 P.M.; but by 7 A.M. on the following morning the one which had  been previously open to the extent of 90o had its cotyledons vertical and  completely shut; the other seedling had them nearly shut. Later in the  morning they opened in the ordinary manner. It appears therefore that the  cotyledons of this plant close and open at somewhat different periods from  those of the foregoing species of the allied genera of Cucurbita and  Lagenaria.    Fig. 31. Opuntia basilaris: conjoint circumnutation of hypocotyl and  cotyledon; filament fixed longitudinally to cotyledon, and movement traced  during 66 h. on horizontal glass. Movement of the terminal bead magnified  about 30 times, here reduced to one-third scale. Seedling kept in  hot-house, feebly illuminated from above.    Opuntia basilaris (Cacteae).--A seedling was carefully observed, because,  considering its appearance and the nature of the mature plant, it seemed  very unlikely that either the hypocotyl or cotyledons would circumnutate to  an appreciable extent. The cotyledons were well developed, being .9 of an  inch in length, .22 in breadth, and .15 in thickness. The almost  cylindrical hypocotyl, now bearing a minute spinous bud on its summit, was  only .45 of an inch in height, and .19 in diameter. The tracing (Fig. 31)  shows the combined movement of the hypocotyl and of one of the cotyledons,  from 4.45 P.M. on May 28th to 11 A.M. on the 31st. On the 29th a nearly  perfect ellipse was completed. On the 30th the hypocotyl moved, from some  unknown cause, in the same general direction in a zigzag line; but between  4.30 and 10 P.M. almost completed a second small ellipse. The cotyledons  move only a little up and down: thus at 10.15 P.M. they stood only 10o  higher than at noon. The chief seat of movement therefore, at least when  the cotyledons are rather old as in the present case, lies in the  hypocotyl. The ellipse described on the 29th had its longer axis directed  at nearly right angles to a line joining the two cotyledons. The actual  amount of movement of the bead at the end of the  [page 45]  filament was, as far as could be ascertained, about .14 of an inch.    Fig. 32. Helianthus annuus: circumnutation of hypocotyl, with filament  fixed across its summit, traced on a horizontal glass in darkness, from  8.45 A.M. to 10.45 P.M., and for an hour on following morning. Movement of  bead magnified 21 times, here reduced to one-half of original scale.    Helianthus annuus (Compositae).--The upper part of the hypocotyl moved  during the day-time in the course shown in the annexed figure (Fig. 32). As  the line runs in various directions, crossing itself several times, the  movement may be considered as one of circumnutation. The extreme actual  distance travelled was at least .1 of an inch. The movements of the  cotyledons of two seedlings were observed; one facing a north-east window,  and the other so feebly illuminated from above us as to be almost in  darkness. They continued to sink till about noon, when they began to rise;  but between 5 and 7 or 8 P.M. they either sank a little, or moved  laterally, and then again began to rise. At 7 A.M. on the following morning  those on the plant before the north-east window had opened so little that  they stood at an angle of 73o above the horizon, and were not observed any  longer. Those on the seedling which had been kept in almost complete  darkness, sank during the whole day, without rising about mid-day, but rose  during the night. On the third and fourth days they continued sinking  without any alternate ascending movement; and this, no doubt, was due to  the absence of light.    Primula Sinensis (Primulaceae).--A seedling was placed with the two  cotyledons parallel to a north-east window on a day when the light was  nearly uniform, and a filament was affixed to one of them.  From  observations subsequently made on another seedling with the stem secured to  a stick, the greater part of the movement shown in the annexed figure (Fig.  33), must have been that of the hypocotyl, though the cotyledons certainly  move up and down to a certain extent both during the day and night. The  movements of the same seedling were traced  [page 46]  on the following day with nearly the same result; and there can be no doubt  about the circumnutation of the hypocotyl.    Fig. 33. Primula Sinensis: conjoint circumnutation of hypocotyl and  cotyledon, traced on vertical glass, from 8.40 A.M. to 10.45 P.M. Movements  of bead magnified about 26 times.    Cyclamen Persicum (Primulaceae).--This plant is generally supposed to  produce only a single cotyledon, but Dr. H. Gressner* has shown that a  second one is developed after a long interval of time. The hypocotyl is  converted into a globular corm, even before the first cotyledon has broken  through the ground with its blade closely enfolded and with its petiole in  the form of an arch, like the arched hypocotyl or epicotyl of any ordinary  dicotyledonous plant. A glass filament was affixed to a cotyledon, .55 of  an inch in height, the petiole of which had straightened itself and stood  nearly vertical, but with the blade not as yet fully expanded. Its  movements were traced during 24 ½ h. on a horizontal glass, magnified 50  times; and in this interval it described two irregular small circles; it  therefore circumnutates, though on an extremely small scale.    Fig. 34. Stapelia sarpedon: circumnutation of hypocotyl, illuminated from  above, traced on horizontal glass, from 6.45 A.M. June 26th to 8.45 A.M.  28th. Temp. 23-24o C. Movement of bead magnified 21 times.    Stapelia sarpedon (Asclepiadeae).--This plant, when mature, resembles a  cactus. The flattened hypocotyl is fleshy, enlarged in the upper part, and  bears two rudimentary cotyledons. It breaks through the ground in an arched  form, with the rudimentary cotyledons closed or in contact. A filament was  affixed almost    * 'Bot. Zeitung,' 1874, p. 837.  [page 47]    vertically to the hypocotyl of a seedling half an inch high; and its  movements were traced during 50 h. on a horizontal glass (Fig. 34). From  some unknown cause it bowed itself to one side, and as this was effected by  a zigzag course, it probably circumnutated; but with hardly any other  seedling observed by us was this movement so obscurely shown.    Ipomoea caerulea vel Pharbitis nil (Convolvulaceae).--Seedlings of this  plant were observed because it is a twiner, the upper internodes of which  circumnutate conspicuously; but like other twining plants, the first few  internodes"]]]
