Tom went into the house. He found his father busy with some papers  at his desk.    \"Ah, it's you, is it, Tom?\" asked the inventor, looking up. \"I was  just wishing you would come in.\"    \"What for, dad?\"    \"Well, I have quite an important mission for you. I want you to go  on a journey.\"    \"A journey? Where?\"    \"To Albany. You see, I've been thinking over matters, and I have  been in correspondence with my lawyers in regard to my turbine  motor. I must take measures to protect myself. You know I have not  yet taken out a complete patent on the machine. I have not done so  because I did not want to put my model on exhibition in Washington.  I was afraid some of those unscrupulous men would take advantage of  me. Another point was that I had not perfected a certain device that  goes on the motor. That objection is now removed, and I am ready to  send my model to Washington, and take out the complete patent.\"    \"But I thought you said you wanted me to go to Albany.\"    \"So I do. I will explain. I have just had a letter from Reid &  Crawford, my Washington attorneys. Mr. Crawford, the junior member  of the firm, will be in Albany this week on some law business. He  agrees to receive my model and some papers there, and take them back  to Washington with him. In this way they will be well protected. You  see, I have to be on my guard, and if I send the model to Albany,  instead of the national capital, I may throw the plotters off the  track, for I feel that they are watching every move I make. As soon  as you or I should start for Washington they would be on our trail.  But you can go to Albany unsuspected. Mr. Crawford will wait for you  there. I want you to start day after to-morrow.\"    \"All right, dad. I can start now, if you say so.\"    \"No, there is no special need for haste. I have some matters to  arrange. You might go to the station and inquire about trains to the  State capital.\"    \"Am I going by train?\"    \"Certainly. How else could you go?\"    There was a look of excitement in Tom's eyes. He had a sudden idea.    \"Dad,\" he exclaimed, \"why couldn't I go on my motor-cycle?\"    \"Your motor-cycle?\"    \"Yes. I could easily make the trip on it in one day. The roads are  good, and I would enjoy it. I can carry the model back of me on the  saddle. It is not very large.\"    \"Well,\" said Mr. Swift slowly, for the idea was a new one to him, \"I  suppose that part would be all right. But you have not had much  experience riding a motor-cycle. Besides, you don't know the roads.\"    \"I can inquire. Will you let me go, dad?\"    Mr. Swift appeared to hesitate.    \"It will be fine!\" went on Tom. \"I would enjoy the trip, and there's  another thing. If we want to keep this matter secret the best plan  would be to let me go on my machine. If those men are on the watch,  they will not think that I have the model. They will think I'm just  going for a pleasure jaunt.\"    \"There's something in that,\" admitted Mr. Swift, and Tom, seeing  that his father was favorably inclined, renewed his arguments, until  the inventor finally agreed.    \"It will be a great trip!\" exclaimed Tom. \"I'll go all over my machine  now, to see that it's in good shape. You get your papers and model  ready, dad, and I'll take them to Albany for you. The motor-cycle will  come in handy.\"    But had Tom only known the dangers ahead of him, and the risks he  was to run, he would not have whistled so light heartedly as he went  over every nut and bolt on his machine.    Two days later, the valuable model, having been made into a  convenient package, and wrapped in water-proof paper, was fastened  back of the saddle on the motor-cycle. Tom carefully pinned in an  inside pocket the papers which were to be handed to Mr. Crawford. He  was to meet the lawyer at a hotel in Albany.    \"Now take care of yourself, Tom,\" cautioned his father as he bade  him good-by. \"Don't try to make speed, as there is no special rush.  And, above all, don't lose anything.\"    \"I'll not, dad,\" and with a wave of his hand to Mr. Swift and the  housekeeper, who stood in the door to see him off, Tom jumped into  the saddle, started the machine, and then, after sufficient momentum  had been attained, he turned on the gasolene and set the spark  lever. With rattles and bangs, which were quickly subdued by the  muffler, the machine gathered speed. Tom was off for Albany.          CHAPTER XI.    A VINDICTIVE TRAMP      Though Tom's father had told him there was no necessity for any  great speed, the young inventor could not resist the opportunity for  pushing his machine to the limit. The road was a level one and in  good condition, so the motor-cycle fairly flew along. The day was  pleasant, a warm sun shining overhead, and it was evident that early  summer was crowding spring rather closely.    \"This is glorious!\" exclaimed Tom aloud as he spun along. \"I'm glad I  persuaded dad to let me take this trip. It was a great idea. Wish Ned  Newton was along, though. He'd be company for me, but, as Ned would  say, there are two good reasons why he can't come. One is he has to  work in the bank, and the other is that he has no motor-cycle.\"    Tom swept past house after house along the road, heading in the  opposite direction from that in which lay the town of Shopton and  the city of Mansburg. For several miles Tom's route would lie  through a country district. The first large town he would reach  would be Centreford. He planned to get lunch there, and he had  brought a few sandwiches with him to eat along the road in case he  became hungry before he reached the place.    \"I hope the package containing the model doesn't jar off,\" mused the  lad as he reached behind to make sure that the precious bundle was  safe. \"Dad would be in a bad way if that should disappear. And the  papers, too.\" He put his hand to his inner pocket to feel that they  were secure. Coming to a little down-grade, Tom shut off some of the  power, the new levers he had arranged to control the gasolene and  spark working well.    \"I think I'll take the old wood road and pass through Pompville,\"  Tom decided, after covering another mile or two. He was approaching  a division in the highway. \"It's a bit sandy,\" he went on, \"and the  going will be heavy, but it will be a good chance to test my  machine. Besides, I'll save five miles, and, while I don't have to  hurry, I may need time on the other end. I'd rather arrive in Albany  a little before dusk than after dark. I can deliver the model and  papers and have a good night's sleep before starting back. So the  old wood road it will be.\"    The wood road, as Tom called it, was a seldom used highway, which,  originally, was laid out for just what the name indicated, to bring  wood from the forest. With the disappearance of most of the trees  the road became more used for ordinary traffic between the towns of  Pompville and Edgefield. But when the State built a new highway  connecting these two places the old road fell into disuse, though it  was several miles shorter than the new turnpike.    He turned from the main thoroughfare, and was soon spinning along  the sandy stretch, which was shaded with trees that in some places  met overhead, forming a leafy arch. It was cool and pleasant, and  Tom liked it.    \"It isn't as bad as I thought,\" he remarked. \"The sand is pretty  thick, but this machine of mine appears to be able to crawl through  it.\"    Indeed, the motor-cycle was doing remarkably well, but Tom found  that he had to turn on full power, for the big rubber wheels went  deep into the soft soil. Along Tom rode, picking out the firmest  places in the road. He was so intent on this that he did not pay  much attention to what was immediately ahead of him, knowing that he  was not very likely to meet other vehicles or pedestrians. He was  considerably startled therefore when, as he went around a turn in  the highway where the bushes grew thick, right down to the edge of  the road, to see a figure emerge from the underbrush and start  across the path. So quickly did the man appear that Tom was almost  upon him in an instant, and even though the young inventor shut off  the power and applied the brake, the front wheel hit the man and  knocked him down.    \"What's the matter with you? What are you trying to do--kill me? Why  don't you ring a bell or blow a horn when you're coming?\" The man had  sprung up from the soft sand where the wheel from the motor-cycle had  sent him and faced Tom angrily. Then the rider, who had quickly  dismounted, saw that his victim was a ragged tramp.    \"I'm sorry,\" began Tom. \"You came out of the bushes so quickly that  I didn't have a chance to warn you. Did I hurt you much?\"    \"Well, youse might have. 'Tain't your fault dat youse didn't,\" and  the tramp began to brush the dirt from his ragged coat. Tom was  instantly struck by a curious fact. The tramp in his second remarks  used language more in keeping with his character, whereas, in his  first surprise and anger, he had talked much as any other person  would. \"Youse fellers ain't got no right t' ride dem machines like  lightnin' along de roads,\" the ragged chap went on, and he still  clung to the use of words and expressions current among his  fraternity. Tom wondered at it, and then, ascribing the use of the  better language to the fright caused by being hit by the machine,  the lad thought no more about it at the time. There was occasion,  however, when he attached more meaning to it.    \"I'm very sorry,\" went on Tom. \"I'm sure I didn't mean to. You see,  I was going quite slowly, and--\"    \"You call dat slow, when youse hit me an' knocked me down?\" demanded  the tramp. \"I'd oughter have youse arrested, dat's what, an' I would  if dere was a cop handy.\"    \"I wasn't going at all fast,\" said Tom, a little nettled that his  conciliatory words should be so rudely received. \"If I had been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42324"],[0,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus (#10)"],[1,"I had  arrived at this point, and had become as well acquainted with the theory  and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of  the professors at Ingolstadt, my residence there being no longer  conducive to my improvements, I thought of returning to my friends and  my native town, when an incident happened that protracted my stay.    One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the  structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with life.  Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed? It was  a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery;  yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted,  if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our enquiries. I revolved  these circumstances in my mind, and determined thenceforth to apply  myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which  relate to physiology. Unless I had been animated by an almost  supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this study would have been  irksome, and almost intolerable. To examine the causes of life, we must  first have recourse to death. I became acquainted with the science of  anatomy: but this was not sufficient; I must also observe the natural  decay and corruption of the human body. In my education my father had  taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no  supernatural horrors. I do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale  of superstition, or to have feared the apparition of a spirit. Darkness  had no effect upon my fancy; and a churchyard was to me merely the  receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat of  beauty and strength, had become food for the worm. Now I was led to  examine the cause and progress of this decay, and forced to spend days  and nights in vaults and charnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon  every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human  feelings. I saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I  beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I  saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused,  examining and analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in  the change from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst  of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me--a light so brilliant  and wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the  immensity of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised, that  among so many men of genius who had directed their enquiries towards the  same science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing  a secret.    Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not  more certainly shine in the heavens, than that which I now affirm is  true. Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the  discovery were distinct and probable. After days and nights of  incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of  generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing  animation upon lifeless matter.    The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery soon  gave place to delight and rapture. After so much time spent in painful  labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires, was the most  gratifying consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so great  and overwhelming, that all the steps by which I had been progressively  led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result. What had been  the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world  was now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it all opened  upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a nature rather  to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them towards the  object of my search, than to exhibit that object already accomplished. I  was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead, and found a  passage to life, aided only by one glimmering, and seemingly  ineffectual, light.    I see by your eagerness, and the wonder and hope which your eyes  express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with  which I am acquainted; that cannot be: listen patiently until the end of  my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that  subject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was, to  your destruction and infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my  precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of  knowledge, and how much happier that man is who believes his native town  to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature  will allow.    When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated  a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it. Although  I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame  for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of fibres, muscles,  and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour.  I doubted at first whether I should attempt the creation of a being like  myself, or one of simpler organization; but my imagination was too much  exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give  life to an animal as complex and wonderful as man. The materials at  present within my command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an  undertaking; but I doubted not that I should ultimately succeed. I  prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my operations might be  incessantly baffled, and at last my work be imperfect: yet, when I  considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and  mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least  lay the foundations of future success. Nor could I consider the  magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its  impracticability. It was with these feelings that I began the creation  of a human being. As the minuteness of the parts formed a great  hinderance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to  make the being of a gigantic stature; that is to say, about eight feet  in height, and proportionably large. After having formed this  determination, and having spent some months in successfully collecting  and arranging my materials, I began.    No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like  a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death appeared  to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a  torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless me as  its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their  being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his child so  completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these reflections, I  thought, that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might  in process of time (although I now found it impossible) renew life where  death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.    These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking with  unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my person  had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very brink of  certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or  the next hour might realise. One secret which I alone possessed was the  hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight  labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued  nature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive the horrors of my secret  toil, as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave, or tortured  the living animal to animate the lifeless clay? My limbs now tremble,  and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but then a resistless, and  almost frantic, impulse, urged me forward; I seemed to have lost all  soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was indeed but a passing  trance, that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as, the  unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had returned to my old habits.  I collected bones from charnel-houses; and disturbed, with profane  fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame. In a solitary  chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house, and separated from all  the other apartments by a gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of  filthy creation: my eye-balls were starting from their sockets in  attending to the details of my employment. The dissecting room and the  slaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and often did my human  nature turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by  an eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work near to a  conclusion.    The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in  one pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow  a more plentiful harvest, or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage:  but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. And the same  feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to  forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had not  seen for so long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them; and I well  remembered the words of my father: \"I know that while you are pleased  with yourself, you will think of us with affection, and we shall hear  regularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard any interruption in  your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally  neglected.\"    I knew well therefore what would be my father's feelings; but I could  not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which  had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as it were,  to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the  great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature, should be  "]]]
