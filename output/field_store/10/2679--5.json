When gold is exchanged to settle the balances of trade between two  countries, it is not reckoned, if coined, at its face value, but  at its bullion value.    The word \"pecunia\" meant in ancient Greece and Rome a flock or  herd.    In those days live stock were used as a medium of exchange, or  money.    We keep the word and often use it as in \"pecuniary\" affairs, and  when we call a moneyless man, \"impecunious.\"    UNITED STATES MONEY    The United States Government reserves to itself the right under  the constitution, to coin and issue the money to be used by its  own people.    Formerly we had two standards of value, gold and silver, or  bimetalism.    If gold and silver were produced in relatively equal quantities,  the world would go on trading with money of both kinds, but the  proportions are not the same.    Among the Aztecs and Peruvians silver ranked with gold as two to  one, that is, two pounds of silver would purchase as much as one  pound of gold.    But when great silver mines were discovered and new methods were  discovered for extracting the metal, it became more and more  abundant, till it depreciated far below the former value it had in  its relation to gold.    Most of the commercial nations decided to have but one standard of  value, and that gold, long before the United States fell into  line.    Our money measure is known as the decimal, or metric. It would be  convenient, if we could follow the example of nearly all the other  commercial nations, and use the metric system for all our weights  and measures.    OUR METAL MONEY    In the United States Treasury at Washington, there are many  million dollars in silver coins and bullion.    The gold standard has not driven silver out of circulation, for it  is still found convenient to use it in settling immediately our  smaller business transactions.    When the silver dollar was first coined, and indeed up to the  present date, the intention was that it should contain about a  dollar's worth of silver, or 374 1/4 Troy grains of the pure  metal. This amount of silver was supposed to represent permanently  24 3/4 grains of pure gold, and it did so represent its value at  one time, and would have continued to do so, had the relative  output of both metals been the same.    Our chief mint is in Philadelphia, where is coined all the copper,  nickel, silver, and gold money in use.    To imitate these metals, even where the full value is given,  constitutes the criminal offence called \"counterfeiting.\"    In former times, some of our older readers will remember them, the  Government meant to have the metal in each coin of about its  unstamped value in the market.    In those days the cent was as large as our present silver half  dollar, and the copper two-cent piece was a monster in the way of  coinage.    Now our copper and nickel coins are small and can be carried  without testing strength of pockets. They are regarded as money  \"tokens.\"    Silver coins that are punched can be refused in the settlement of  a debt.    Punched gold coins should always be refused, for they are never of  their face value.    Silver coins may be used in the settlement of bills up to $5.00.    Gold coins are, of course, legal tender up to any amount.    PAPER MONEY    We usually class all paper money as \"bills.\"    There are three classes of bills, all quite different in their  inception and meaning. These are--    1. National bank notes.  2. Treasury notes or \"greenbacks.\"  3. Treasury certificates.    BANK NOTES    A national bank note is the guaranteed promise of some national  bank to pay coin or its equivalent to any one presenting the note  at the bank and asking to have the exchange made.    This exchange is called \"redeeming.\"    If you examine a bank bill you will notice that it is drawn much  like an ordinary business \"demand\" note, made payable to \"bearer,\"  and signed by the bank president and cashier.    For every dollar of its own sent out in the form of a bill by a  national bank, the Government holds a dollar of the bank's  collateral to guarantee the redemption of the note if the bank  should fail.    National bank notes are received in all business transactions,  because they are secured by the Government, yet there are cases in  which even the Government will not receive them in payment of a  claim, nor pay them out itself.    1. All import duties must be paid in gold.  2. The Government pays the interest on its own bonds in gold.    The Bureau of Engraving and Printing--a department of the United  States Treasury--makes and prints all the national bank notes.    On all these notes the names of the United States Treasurer and  the United States Register appear. The names look like signatures,  but they are facsimilies and are printed with the note.    The notes are printed on specially prepared paper, to imitate  which is regarded as a counterfeit.    Soiled and worn out bank notes may be exchanged for fresh ones at  the Treasury Department.    \"GREENBACKS\"    Greenbacks are treasury notes. The name comes from the color in  which they first appeared in the years of our Civil War.    The treasury note is really an engraved promissory note of the  United States Government made payable to the bearer, and bearing  the signatures of the Treasurer and Register of the Treasury.    These notes are issued in denominations of from five to ten  thousand dollars.    Formerly there were one and two-dollar treasury notes issued, and  we still find some of these \"old-timers\" in circulation.    There are so many treasury notes in circulation that the  Government, vast though its bullion and coin reserves are, could  not redeem them if presented at once.    The treasury note is a legal tender for any amount of  indebtedness.    The Government prints the following guarantee on every treasury  note:    \"This note is, by law, to be considered as good as coin. Any one  to whom you pay it must reckon it as equivalent to a dollar (or  face value in dollars) in value.\"    TREASURY CERTIFICATES    The treasury certificate is, in form, very much like the treasury  note, and it bears the signatures of the same officers.    Treasury certificates are of two kinds, gold and silver.    The gold certificates are printed in yellow.    The silver certificates are light black and white.    These certificates are issued against the great reserves of gold  and silver that are kept to redeem them.    The use of the gold certificate saves the loss of the gold that  comes through abrasion when handled.    A five-dollar silver certificate is much more convenient to carry  than five silver dollars.    These certificates, as may be seen, are issued for the convenience  of the public.    Certificates of either character will be redeemed to any amount,  in the metals for which they call, if presented at the United  States Treasury at Washington, or at any of the sub-treasuries to  be found in our larger cities.    WORN-OUT NOTES    Only those familiar with the work can realize the great quantities  of bank bills, treasury notes, and certificates continually being  made and sent out from Washington.    While a stream of clean, fresh paper of enormous value is going  out to be spread all over the country, another stream of soiled,  torn and altogether disreputable-looking paper is flowing back to  the Treasury.    The filthy paper is quite as valuable as the clean, so it is  properly checked, recorded, and credited before new paper is sent  out in its place.    They are now trying to make old bills presentable by washing them  at the Department. Meanwhile, most of them are ground again into  pulp, made into new paper, and all the first processes gone  through with to make the paper into money.          CHAPTER XIII    OUR POSTAL BUSINESS        Up to a few years ago, it was the city, town and village dweller  who reaped the greatest benefit from the post office.    In dense communities carriers leave the mail at the place to which  it is addressed. Where this is not done the walk for the mail is  not far.    Now the purpose of our Government, which is of the people and by  the people, is to treat all the people alike.    However, up to a few years ago the farmer, our most essential  producer, had not a fair deal.    Fortunately things have changed and are still changing for the  better.    Rural Free Delivery was an idea as just as it was grand, and as  welcome as it was necessary.    The good work began October 1, 1896.    The purpose of rural free delivery is to accommodate dwellers in  the country, whether farmers or not.    Through this branch of the service mails are carried daily, on  fixed lines of travel, to people who otherwise would have to go  long distances to reach a post office.    The Government requires that the states or counties shall keep in  good condition the roads traversed by the mail carriers.    Gates must not obstruct, and it is required that every unfordable  stream shall be bridged.    It is further required, as a condition for establishing a line for  rural free delivery, that each route of twenty-four or more miles  in length shall have at least one hundred families resident on  either side.    CLASSIFIED MAIL MATTER    Mail matter is divided into four classes. For each class a  different rate is charged.    First Class:--All letters, and all other written matter, with a  few exceptions, pay two cents for each ounce, or fraction of an  ounce.    Second Class:--Newspapers, magazines, and other periodicals, one  cent for each four ounces or fraction of four ounces. Publishers  of periodicals, sending direct from place of publication, get a  lower rate,--one cent a pound.    Third Class:--Books, circulars, and other printed matter, one cent  for two ounces or fraction of two ounces.    Fourth Class:--Merchandise and miscellaneous articles, weighing  not over four pounds, one cent for each ounce or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6168"],[0,"Fifty Famous People: A Book of Short Stories (#10)"],[1," that I came here,\" said Alexander. \"I came to  learn the customs of your people.\"    \"Very well, then,\" said the shah, \"stay with me a little while and  observe what you can.\"    While the shah and the king were talking, two countrymen came in. \"My  lord,\" said one, \"we have had a disagreement, and wish you to settle  the matter.\"    \"Tell me about it,\" said the shah.    \"Well, it is this way,\" answered the man: \"I bought a piece of ground  from this neighbor of mine, and paid him a fair price for it.  Yesterday, when I was digging in it, I found a box full of gold and  jewels. This treasure does not belong to me, for I bought only the  ground; but when I offered it to my neighbor he refused it.\"    The second man then spoke up and said, \"It is true that I sold him the  ground, but I did not reserve anything he might find in it. The  treasure is not mine, and therefore I am unwilling to take it.\"    The shah sat silent for a while, as if in thought. Then he said to the  first man, \"Have you a son?\"    \"Yes, a young man of promise,\" was the answer.    The shah turned to the second man: \"Have you a daughter?\"    \"I have,\" answered the man, \"--a beautiful girl.\"    \"Well, then, this is my judgment. Let the son marry the daughter, if  both agree, and give them the treasure as a wedding portion.\"    Alexander listened with great interest. \"You have judged wisely and  rightly,\" said he to the shah, \"but in my own country we should have  done differently.\"    \"What would you have done?\"    \"Well, we should have thrown both men into prison, and the treasure  would have been given to the king.\"    \"And is that what you call justice?\" asked the shah.    \"We call it policy,\" said Alexander.    \"Then let me ask you a question,\" said the shah. \"Does the sun shine  in your country?\"    \"Surely.\"    \"Does the rain fall there?\"    \"Oh, yes!\"    \"Is it possible! But are there any gentle, harmless animals in your  fields?\"    \"A great many.\"    \"Then,\" said the shah, \"it must be that the sun shines and the rain  falls for the sake of these poor beasts; for men so unjust do not  deserve such blessings.\"          THE GENERAL AND THE FOX        There was once a famous Greek general whose name was Aristomenes.  [Footnote: Aristomenes (_pro_. ar is tom'e neez).] He was brave and  wise; and his countrymen loved him.    Once, however, in a great battle with the Spartans, his army was beaten  and he was taken prisoner.    In those days, people had not learned to be kind to their enemies. In  war, they were savage and cruel; for war always makes men so.    The Spartans hated Aristomenes. He had given them a great deal of  trouble, and they wished to destroy him.    On a mountain near their city, there was a narrow chasm or hole in the  rocks. It was very deep, and there was no way to climb out of it.    The Spartans said to one another, \"Let us throw this fellow into the  rocky chasm. Then we may be sure that he will never trouble us again.\"    So a party of soldiers led him up into the mountain and placed him on  the edge of the yawning hole in the rocks. \"See the place to which we  send all our enemies,\" they said. And they threw him in.    No one knows how he escaped being dashed to pieces. Some of the Greeks  said that an eagle caught him in her beak and carried him unharmed to  the bottom. But that is not likely.    I think that he must have fallen upon some bushes and vines that grew  in some parts of the chasm. At any rate he was not hurt much.    He groped around in the dim light, but could not find any way of  escape. The rocky walls surrounded him on every side. There was no  place where he could set his foot to climb out.    For three days he lay in his strange prison. He grew weak from  hunger and thirst. He expected to die from starvation.    Suddenly he was startled by a noise close by him. Something was moving  among the rocks at the bottom of the chasm. He watched quietly, and  soon saw a large fox coming towards him.    He lay quite still till the animal was very near. Then he sprang up  quickly and seized it by the tail.    The frightened fox scampered away as fast as it could; and Aristomenes  followed, clinging to its tail. It ran into a narrow cleft which he  had not seen before, and then through a long, dark passage which was  barely large enough for a man's body.    Aristomenes held on. At last he saw a ray of light far ahead of him.  It was the sunlight streaming in at the entrance to the passage. But  soon the way became too narrow for his body to pass through. What  should he do? He let go of the fox, and it ran out. Then with great  labor he began to widen the passageway. Here the rocks were smaller,  and he soon loosened them enough to allow him to squeeze through. In  a short time he was free and in the open air.    Some days after this the Spartans heard strange news: \"Aristomenes is  again at the head of the Greek army.\" They could not believe it.          THE BOMB        Did you ever hear of King Charles the Twelfth, of Sweden? He lived two  hundred years ago, and was famous for his courage in defending his  country.    One day he was in the midst of a great battle. The small house in which  he had taken shelter was almost between the two armies.    He called to one of his officers and bade him sit down and write a  short order for him.    The officer began to write, but just as he finished the first word,  a bomb came through the roof of the house and struck the floor close  by him. He dropped the pen and sprang to his feet. He was pale with  fear. \"What is the matter?\" asked the king.    \"Oh, sir,\" he answered, \"the bomb! the bomb!\"    \"Yes, I see,\" said the king. \"But what has the bomb to do with what  I wish you to write? Sit down, and take your pen. When your country  is in danger, you should forget your own safety.\"        A STORY OF OLD ROME    There was a great famine in Rome. The summer had been very dry and the  corn crop had failed. There was no bread in the city. The people were  starving.    One day, to the great joy of all, some ships arrived from another  country. These ships were loaded with corn. Here was food enough for  all.    The rulers of the city met to decide what should be done with the corn.    \"Divide it among the poor people who need it so badly,\" said some.  \"Let it be a free gift to them from the city.\"    But one of the rulers was not willing to do this. His name was  Coriolanus, [Footnote: Co ri o la'nus.] and he was very rich.    \"These people are poor because they have been too lazy to work,\" he  said. \"They do not deserve any gifts from the city. Let those who wish  any corn bring money and buy it.\"    When the people heard about this speech of the rich man, Coriolanus,  they were very angry.    \"He is no true Roman,\" said some.    \"He is selfish and unjust,\" said others.    \"He is an enemy to the poor. Kill him! kill him!\" cried the mob. They  did not kill him, but they drove him out of the city and bade him never  return.    Coriolanus made his way to the city of Antium, [Footnote: Antium  (_pro._ an'shi um).] which was not far from Rome. The people of Antium  were enemies of the Romans and had often been at war with them. So they  welcomed Coriolanus very kindly and made him the general of their army.    Coriolanus began at once to make ready for war against Rome. He  persuaded other towns near Antium to send their soldiers to help him.    Soon, at the head of a very great army, he marched toward the city  which had once been his home. The rude soldiers of Antium overran all  the country around Rome. They burned the villages and farmhouses. They  filled the land with terror.    Coriolanus pitched his camp quite near to the city. His army was the  greatest that the Romans had ever seen. They knew that they were  helpless before so strong an enemy.    \"Surrender your city to me,\" said Coriolanus. \"Agree to obey the laws  that I shall make for you. Do this, or I will burn Rome and destroy  all its people.\"    The Romans answered, \"We must have time to think of this matter. Give  us a few days to learn what sort of laws you will make for us, and  then we will say whether we can submit to them or not.\"    \"I will give you thirty days to consider the matter,\" said Coriolanus.    Then he told them what laws he would require them to obey. These laws  were so severe that all said, \"It will be better to die at once.\"    At the end of the thirty days, four of the city's rulers went out to  beg him to show mercy to the people of Rome. These rulers were old  men, with wise faces and long white beards. They went out bareheaded  and very humble.    Coriolanus would not listen to them. He drove them back with threats,  and told them that they should expect no mercy from him; but he agreed  to give them three more days to consider the matter.    The next day, all the priests and learned men went out to beg for  mercy. These were dressed in their long flowing robes, and all knelt  humbly before him. But he drove them back with scornful words.    On the last day, the great army which Coriolanus had led from Antium  was drawn up in battle array. It was ready to march upon the city and  destroy it.    All Rome was in terror. There seemed to be no way to escape the anger  of this furious man.    Then the rulers, in their despair, said, \"Let us go up to the house  where Coriolanus used to live when he was one of us. His mother and  his wife are still there. They are noble women, and they love Rome.  Let us ask them to go out and beg our enemy to have mercy upon us. His  heart will be hard indeed if he can refuse his mother and his wife.\"    The two noble women were willing to do all that they could to save  their city. So, leading his little children by the hand, they went out  to meet Coriolanus. Behind them followed a long procession of the  women of Rome. Coriolanus was in his tent. When he saw his mother and  his wife and his children, he was filled with joy. But when they made"]]]
