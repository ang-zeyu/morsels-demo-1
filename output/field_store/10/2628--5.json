In obedience to those altruistic tendencies which, with due recognition  of the law of self-preservation, comprehend the duty of man, it is  necessary that the terms and conditions upon which others may acquire  freehold estates in tropical Queensland--the most fruitful and the most  desirable part of Australia--should be briefly detailed. As insurance  against intrusion, a small area of the island had been secured from the  Government under special lease for a term of thirty years, at the rental  of 2 shillings 6 pence per acre per annum. This lease was maintained  only for the period during which our verdant sentiments were put to the  test. That phase having passed without the destruction of a single  illusion, no restraint was imposed upon the passion to possess the land.  Negotiations resulted in a certain acreage being proclaimed open to  selection, and in such case the original applicant has the prior right.  What is termed under the exceedingly liberal land laws of Queensland an  agricultural homestead may comprise 160 acres, 320 acres, or 640 acres,  in accordance with the classification of the land as of first, second, or  third quality. The selector must pay 2 shillings 6 pence per acre at the  rate Of 3 pence per acre for ten years, and must reside continuously on  the land. Five years are allowed for the completion of  improvements--house, clearing, fencing, cultivation, etc., which in  valuation must equal 10 shillings, 5 shillings, or 2 shillings 6 pence  per acre respectively, according to the classification of the land. At  the end of the five years the selector may pay in a lump sum the second  moiety of rent, making the total 2 shillings 6 pence per acre, and he is  thereupon entitled to the issue of a deed of grant of the land in  fee-simple. Otherwise payments may extend over the term of ten years,  when the land becomes freehold. Briefly, for the sum Of 2 shillings 6  pence per acre distributed over ten years, in addition to a trifle for  survey fees (also payable in easy instalments) and the construction of  improvements equal in value to 2 shillings 6 pence per acre, the freehold  of land unsurpassed in fertility in the whole world may be acquired. The  selector may build his own hut and erect his fences of timber from his  clearing, and the officials assess improvements on a liberal scale. Who  would not be a landed proprietor under such terms? Other clauses of the  Land Act are far more encouraging. Not only are payments held in abeyance  until the selector is able to meet them out of his earnings from the  land, but in special cases monetary assistance is afforded him. Literally  the meekest of men may inherit the choicest part of the earth.    What has been said of the natural features of Dunk Island is applicable  to the coastal tract extending, say, 300 miles, than which no land is  more fertile. A very notable advantage is enjoyed here. Brammo Bay is but  three or four minutes' steam from the track of vessels which make weekly  trips up and down the coast, and by arrangements with the proprietary of  one of the lines we have the boon of a regular weekly mail and of cheap  carriage of supplies. Without this connecting link, life on the island  would have been very different. The Companies running parallel lines of  steamers, one skirting the coast and the other outside the islands in  deep water, have done much to open up the wealth of the agricultural land  of North Queensland. Trade follows the flag. Here the flag of the  mercantile marine has frequently been first planted to demonstrate the  certainty of trade.    Without apology, a few facts are submitted which utterly condemn the  practicability of one department of island enterprise, and which possibly  (without protest) may provide a reason for the placing of other branches of  industry beyond the pale of recognition by those who devote every moment  of time to, and make never-ending sacrifices of ease and health and  comfort on behalf of, what folks term the main chance. When after some  expenditure in the purchase of plant and material, and no little labour,  the couple of beehives that formed the original stock of a project for  the harvesting of the nectar which had hitherto gone to waste or been  disposed of by unreflecting birds, had increased to a dozen, and honey  of pleasant and varying flavour flowed from the separator at frequent  intervals, hopes ran high of the earning of a modest profit from one of  the cleanest, nicest, most entertaining and innoxious of pursuits.    No one who takes up bees and who studies their manners and methods can  allow his admiration to remain dormant. It is not the fault of the bees  if he does not become ashamed of himself in some respects; nor are they  to blame if the wisest men fail quite to comprehend some of the wonders  they perform. Only by those \"who list with care extreme,\" are their  gentle tones heard aright; and even from such are some secrets hidden.  How is it that an egg deposited by the queen-mother in a more than  ordinarily capacious compartment hatches a grub, \"just like any other,\"  which grub, feasting upon the concentrated food stored within its cell,  expands and lengthens and emerges an amber queen in all her glory?  Bee-keepers learn that the queen and the drones are the only perfect  insects in the hive, the hoard of willing, bustling slaves being females  in a state of arrested development. Each worker might have been a queen  but for the fact that environment and a special food were not vouchsafed  in the embryonic stage. By making artificial queen-cells, which the  workers provide for, men bring about the birth of queens at will. Not yet  has the secret of the manufacture of royal jelly been revealed. But is it  not the common belief that the spacious compartment and the special food  work the transformation of what otherwise would have been a brief-lifed  toiler to an insect of majestic proportions, regal adornment and imperial  instinct, whose wants are anticipated and who has no duty to perform save  that of increasing and multiplying her faithful subjects? Man controls  the development of an insect. May not those who complain of the disparity  between the births of females and males still listen to hope's  \"flattering tale\"? Such is one of the homilies of the hive.    Interest in bee-culture grows; and some of the habits of the insect came  to be understood and, inevitably, admired, the while all convenient  vessels available, even to the never-to-be-despised kerosene tins, were  utilised to store the nectar garnered from myriads of blossoms. But as  time passed the fair prospects faded. Less and less quantities of honey  were stored. The separator seldom buzzed with soothing melody as the  honey, whirled from the dripping frames of combs, pattered against its  resonant sides. Bees seemed less and less numerous. An air of idleness,  almost dissoluteness and despair, brooded over some of the hives. The  strong robbed the weak; and the weak contented themselves with gathering  in listless groups, murmuring plaintively. If the hives were inquiringly  tapped, instead of a furious and instant alarm and angry outpouring of  excited and wrathful citizens, eager to sacrifice themselves in the  defence of the rights of the commonwealth, there was merely a buzzing  remonstrance, indicative of decreased population, weakness and  disconsolation.    The cause of so great a change in the character and demeanour of citizens  who erstwhile worked as honey carriers all day, and who during the hot,  still nights did duty as animated ventilating fans to maintain a free  circulation of air through the hive, had to be investigated. Soon it was  revealed in the presence of two species of birds, the Australian  bee-eater (MEROPS ORNATUS) and the white-rumped wood-swallow (ARTAMUS  LEUCOGASTA). The former is one of the handsomest of the smaller birds of  Australia, its chief colouring being varying shades of green with  bronze-brown and black head and blue back; and to add to its appearance  and pride two graceful feather-shafts of black protrude from the green  and yellow of the tail. It travels in small companies of, say, from four  and five to a couple of dozen, and in its flight occasionally seems to  pause with wings and tail outspread, revealing all its charms. Fond it  is, too, of perching on bare twigs commanding a wide survey, whence It  darts with unerring precision to catch bees and other insects on the  wing. If its prey takes unkindly to its fate, the bird batters it to  death on its perch ere swallowing it with a twitter of satisfaction. The  wood-swallow wears a becoming suit of soft pearly grey and white, to  contrast with its black head and throat. It has a graceful, soaring  flight and a cheerful chirrup. At certain seasons scores congregate on a  branch, perching in a row, so closely compact that their breasts show as  a continuous band of white. When one leaves his place to catch an insect,  the others close up the ranks and dress the line, and on returning,  wrangle and scold as he may, he needs must take an outside place. Let a  bush fire be started, and flocks of wood-swallows whirl and circle along  the flanks of the circling smoke, taking flying insects on the wing, or  deftly pick \"thin, high-elbowed creatures,\" scuttling up tree-trunks out  of the way of the flames. Those were the marauders who confounded  anticipations of a comfortable livelihood in the decent calling of an  apiarist. They devoured bees by the hundred every day. Every hive paid  dreadful toll to them, for they found food so plentiful, and with so  little exertion, that they made the vicinity of the hives a permanent  abiding place. For a brief season I found myself confronted by a problem.  I had to apply my own favourite theories and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/512"],[0,"Mosses from an Old Manse, and Other Stories (#10)"],[1," occasion, he was struck by its expression of simplicity and  sweetness,--qualities that had not entered into his idea of her  character, and which made him ask anew what manner of mortal she might  be. Nor did he fail again to observe, or imagine, an analogy between  the beautiful girl and the gorgeous shrub that hung its gemlike flowers  over the fountain,--a resemblance which Beatrice seemed to have  indulged a fantastic humor in heightening, both by the arrangement of  her dress and the selection of its hues.    Approaching the shrub, she threw open her arms, as with a passionate  ardor, and drew its branches into an intimate embrace--so intimate that  her features were hidden in its leafy bosom and her glistening ringlets  all intermingled with the flowers.    \"Give me thy breath, my sister,\" exclaimed Beatrice; \"for I am faint  with common air. And give me this flower of thine, which I separate  with gentlest fingers from the stem and place it close beside my heart.\"    With these words the beautiful daughter of Rappaccini plucked one of  the richest blossoms of the shrub, and was about to fasten it in her  bosom. But now, unless Giovanni's draughts of wine had bewildered his  senses, a singular incident occurred. A small orange-colored reptile,  of the lizard or chameleon species, chanced to be creeping along the  path, just at the feet of Beatrice. It appeared to Giovanni,--but, at  the distance from which he gazed, he could scarcely have seen anything  so minute,--it appeared to him, however, that a drop or two of moisture  from the broken stem of the flower descended upon the lizard's head.  For an instant the reptile contorted itself violently, and then lay  motionless in the sunshine. Beatrice observed this remarkable  phenomenon and crossed herself, sadly, but without surprise; nor did  she therefore hesitate to arrange the fatal flower in her bosom. There  it blushed, and almost glimmered with the dazzling effect of a precious  stone, adding to her dress and aspect the one appropriate charm which  nothing else in the world could have supplied. But Giovanni, out of the  shadow of his window, bent forward and shrank back, and murmured and  trembled.    \"Am I awake? Have I my senses?\" said he to himself. \"What is this  being? Beautiful shall I call her, or inexpressibly terrible?\"    Beatrice now strayed carelessly through the garden, approaching closer  beneath Giovanni's window, so that he was compelled to thrust his head  quite out of its concealment in order to gratify the intense and  painful curiosity which she excited. At this moment there came a  beautiful insect over the garden wall; it had, perhaps, wandered  through the city, and found no flowers or verdure among those antique  haunts of men until the heavy perfumes of Dr. Rappaccini's shrubs had  lured it from afar. Without alighting on the flowers, this winged  brightness seemed to be attracted by Beatrice, and lingered in the air  and fluttered about her head. Now, here it could not be but that  Giovanni Guasconti's eyes deceived him. Be that as it might, he fancied  that, while Beatrice was gazing at the insect with childish delight, it  grew faint and fell at her feet; its bright wings shivered; it was  dead--from no cause that he could discern, unless it were the  atmosphere of her breath. Again Beatrice crossed herself and sighed  heavily as she bent over the dead insect.    An impulsive movement of Giovanni drew her eyes to the window. There  she beheld the beautiful head of the young man--rather a Grecian than  an Italian head, with fair, regular features, and a glistening of gold  among his ringlets--gazing down upon her like a being that hovered in  mid air. Scarcely knowing what he did, Giovanni threw down the bouquet  which he had hitherto held in his hand.    \"Signora,\" said he, \"there are pure and healthful flowers. Wear them  for the sake of Giovanni Guasconti.\"    \"Thanks, signor,\" replied Beatrice, with her rich voice, that came  forth as it were like a gush of music, and with a mirthful expression  half childish and half woman-like. \"I accept your gift, and would fain  recompense it with this precious purple flower; but if I toss it into  the air it will not reach you. So Signor Guasconti must even content  himself with my thanks.\"    She lifted the bouquet from the ground, and then, as if inwardly  ashamed at having stepped aside from her maidenly reserve to respond to  a stranger's greeting, passed swiftly homeward through the garden. But  few as the moments were, it seemed to Giovanni, when she was on the  point of vanishing beneath the sculptured portal, that his beautiful  bouquet was already beginning to wither in her grasp. It was an idle  thought; there could be no possibility of distinguishing a faded flower  from a fresh one at so great a distance.    For many days after this incident the young man avoided the window that  looked into Dr. Rappaccini's garden, as if something ugly and monstrous  would have blasted his eyesight had he been betrayed into a glance. He  felt conscious of having put himself, to a certain extent, within the  influence of an unintelligible power by the communication which he had  opened with Beatrice. The wisest course would have been, if his heart  were in any real danger, to quit his lodgings and Padua itself at once;  the next wiser, to have accustomed himself, as far as possible, to the  familiar and daylight view of Beatrice--thus bringing her rigidly and  systematically within the limits of ordinary experience. Least of all,  while avoiding her sight, ought Giovanni to have remained so near this  extraordinary being that the proximity and possibility even of  intercourse should give a kind of substance and reality to the wild  vagaries which his imagination ran riot continually in producing.  Guasconti had not a deep heart--or, at all events, its depths were not  sounded now; but he had a quick fancy, and an ardent southern  temperament, which rose every instant to a higher fever pitch. Whether  or no Beatrice possessed those terrible attributes, that fatal breath,  the affinity with those so beautiful and deadly flowers which were  indicated by what Giovanni had witnessed, she had at least instilled a  fierce and subtle poison into his system. It was not love, although her  rich beauty was a madness to him; nor horror, even while he fancied her  spirit to be imbued with the same baneful essence that seemed to  pervade her physical frame; but a wild offspring of both love and  horror that had each parent in it, and burned like one and shivered  like the other. Giovanni knew not what to dread; still less did he know  what to hope; yet hope and dread kept a continual warfare in his  breast, alternately vanquishing one another and starting up afresh to  renew the contest. Blessed are all simple emotions, be they dark or  bright! It is the lurid intermixture of the two that produces the  illuminating blaze of the infernal regions.    Sometimes he endeavored to assuage the fever of his spirit by a rapid  walk through the streets of Padua or beyond its gates: his footsteps  kept time with the throbbings of his brain, so that the walk was apt to  accelerate itself to a race. One day he found himself arrested; his arm  was seized by a portly personage, who had turned back on recognizing  the young man and expended much breath in overtaking him.    \"Signor Giovanni! Stay, my young friend!\" cried he. \"Have you forgotten  me? That might well be the case if I were as much altered as yourself.\"    It was Baglioni, whom Giovanni had avoided ever since their first  meeting, from a doubt that the professor's sagacity would look too  deeply into his secrets. Endeavoring to recover himself, he stared  forth wildly from his inner world into the outer one and spoke like a  man in a dream.    \"Yes; I am Giovanni Guasconti. You are Professor Pietro Baglioni. Now  let me pass!\"    \"Not yet, not yet, Signor Giovanni Guasconti,\" said the professor,  smiling, but at the same time scrutinizing the youth with an earnest  glance. \"What! did I grow up side by side with your father? and shall  his son pass me like a stranger in these old streets of Padua? Stand  still, Signor Giovanni; for we must have a word or two before we part.\"    \"Speedily, then, most worshipful professor, speedily,\" said Giovanni,  with feverish impatience. \"Does not your worship see that I am in  haste?\"    Now, while he was speaking there came a man in black along the street,  stooping and moving feebly like a person in inferior health. His face  was all overspread with a most sickly and sallow hue, but yet so  pervaded with an expression of piercing and active intellect that an  observer might easily have overlooked the merely physical attributes  and have seen only this wonderful energy. As he passed, this person  exchanged a cold and distant salutation with Baglioni, but fixed his  eyes upon Giovanni with an intentness that seemed to bring out whatever  was within him worthy of notice. Nevertheless, there was a peculiar  quietness in the look, as if taking merely a speculative, not a human  interest, in the young man.    \"It is Dr. Rappaccini!\" whispered the professor when the stranger had  passed. \"Has he ever seen your face before?\"    \"Not that I know,\" answered Giovanni, starting at the name.    \"He HAS seen you! he must have seen you!\" said Baglioni, hastily. \"For  some purpose or other, this man of science is making a study of you. I  know that look of his! It is the same that coldly illuminates his face  as he bends over a bird, a mouse, or a butterfly, which, in pursuance  of some experiment, he has killed by the perfume of a flower; a look as  deep as Nature itself, but without Nature's warmth of love. Signor  Giovanni, I will stake my life upon it, you are the subject of one of  Rappaccini's experiments!\"    \"Will you make a fool of me?\" cried Giovanni, passionately. \"THAT,  signor professor, were an untoward"]]]
