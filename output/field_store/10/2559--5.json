A lobster spilled some soup on Cap'n  Bill's bald head and made him yell for a minute, because it was hot  and he had not expected it, but the queen apologized very sweetly  for the awkwardness of her servants, and the sailor soon forgot all  about the incident in his enjoyment of the meal.    After the feast ended, they all went to the big reception room,  where some of the mermaids played upon harps while others sang  pretty songs. They danced together, too--a graceful, swimming dance,  so queer to the little girl that it interested and amused her  greatly. Cap'n Bill seemed a bit bashful among so many beautiful  mermaids, yet he was pleased when the queen offered him a place  beside her throne, where he could see and hear all the delightful  entertainment provided for the royal guests. He did not talk much,  being a man of few words except when alone with Trot, but his  light-blue eyes were big and round with wonder at the sights he saw.    Trot and the sailor man went to bed early and slept soundly upon  their sponge-covered couches. The little girl never wakened until  long after the sun was shining down through the glass roof of her  room, and when she opened her eyes she was startled to find a number  of big, small and middle-sized fishes staring at her through the  glass. \"That's one bad thing 'bout this mermaid palace,\" she said to  herself. \"It's too public. Ever'thing in the sea can look at you  through the glass as much as it likes. I wouldn't mind fishes  looking at me if they hadn't such big eyes, an'--goodness me!  There's a monster that's all head! And there goes a fish with a sail  on its back, an' here's old Mummercubble, I'm sure, for he's got a  head just like a pig.\"    She might have watched the fishes on the roof for hours, had she not  remembered it was late and breakfast must be ready. So she dressed  and made her toilet, and swam down into the palace to find Cap'n  Bill and the mermaids politely waiting for her to join them. The sea  maidens were as fresh and lovely as ever, while each and all proved  sweet tempered and merry, even at the breakfast table--and that is  where people are cross, if they ever are. During the meal the queen  said, \"I shall take you this morning to the most interesting part of  the ocean, where the largest and most remarkable sea creatures live.  And we must visit King Anko, too, for the sea serpent would feel  hurt and slighted if I did not bring my guests to call upon him.\"    \"That will be nice,\" said Trot eagerly.    But Cap'n Bill asked, \"Is there any danger, ma'am?\"    \"I think not,\" replied Queen Aquareine. \"I cannot say that you will  be exposed to any danger at all, so long as I'm with you. But we are  going into the neighborhood of such fierce and even terrible beings  which would attack you at once did they suspect you to be earth  people. So in order to guard your safety, I intend to draw the Magic  Circle around both of you before we start.\"    \"What is the Magic Circle?\" asked Trot.    \"A fairy charm that prevents any enemy from touching you. No monster  of the sea, however powerful, will be able to reach your body while  you are protected by the Magic Circle,\" declared the Queen.    \"Oh, then I'll not be a bit afraid,\" returned the child with perfect  confidence.    \"Am I to have the Magic Circle drawn around me, too?\" asked Cap'n  Bill.    \"Of course,\" answered Aquareine. \"You will need no other protection  than that, yet both Princess Clia and I will both be with you. For  today I shall leave Merla to rule our palaces in my place until we  return.\"    No sooner was breakfast finished than Trot was anxious to start. The  girl was also curious to discover what the powerful Magic Circle  might prove to be, but she was a little disappointed in the  ceremony. The queen merely grasped her fairy wand in her right hand  and swam around the child in a circle, from left to right. Then she  took her wand in her left hand and swam around Trot in another  circle, from right to left. \"Now, my dear,\" said she, \"you are safe  from any creature we are liable to meet.\"    She performed the same ceremony for Cap'n Bill, who was doubtful  about the Magic Circle because he felt the same after it as he had  before. But he said nothing of his unbelief, and soon they left the  palace and started upon their journey.          CHAPTER 9    THE BASHFUL OCTOPUS      It was a lovely day, and the sea was like azure under the rays of  the sun.    Over the flower beds and through the gardens they swam, emerging  into the open sea in a direction opposite that taken by the visitors  the day before. The party consisted of but four: Queen Aquareine,  Princess Clia, Trot and Cap'n Bill.    \"People who live upon the land know only those sea creatures which  they are able to catch in nets or upon hooks or those which become  disabled and are washed ashore,\" remarked the Queen as they swam  swiftly through the clear water. \"And those who sail in ships see  only the creatures who chance to come to the surface. But in the  deep ocean caverns are queer beings that no mortal has ever heard of  or beheld, and some of these we are to visit. We shall also see some  sea shrubs and flowering weeds which are sure to delight you with  their beauty.\"    The sights really began before they had gone very far from the  palace, and a school of butterfly fish, having gorgeous colors  spattered over their broad wings, was first to delight the  strangers. They swam just as butterflies fly, with a darting, jerky  motion, and called a merry \"Good morning!\" to the mermaids as they  passed.    \"These butterfly fish are remarkably active,\" said the Princess,  \"and their quick motions protect them from their enemies. We like to  meet them; they are always so gay and good-natured.\"    \"Why, so am I!\" cried a sharp voice just beside them, and they all  paused to discover what creature had spoken to them.    \"Take care,\" said Clia in a low voice. \"It's an octopus.\"    Trot looked eagerly around. A long, brown arm stretched across their  way in front and another just behind them, but that did not worry  her. The octopus himself came slowly sliding up to them and proved  to be well worth looking at. He wore a red coat with brass buttons,  and a silk hat was tipped over one ear. His eyes were somewhat dull  and watery, and he had a moustache of long, hair-like \"feelers\" that  curled stiffly at the ends. When he tried to smile at them, he  showed two rows of sharp, white teeth. In spite of his red coat and  yellow-embroidered vest, his standing collar and carefully tied  cravat, the legs of the octopus were bare, and Trot noticed he used  some of his legs for arms, as in one of them was held a slender cane  and in another a handkerchief.    \"Well, well!\" said the Octopus. \"Are you all dumb? Or don't you know  enough to be civil when you meet a neighbor?\"    \"We know how to be civil to our friends,\" replied Trot, who did not  like the way he spoke.    \"Well, are we not friends, then?\" asked the Octopus in an airy tone  of voice.    \"I think not,\" said the little girl. \"Octopuses are horrid  creatures.\"    \"OctoPI, if you please; octoPI,\" said the monster with a laugh.    \"I don't see any pie that pleases me,\" replied Trot, beginning to  get angry.    \"OctoPUS means one of us; two or more are called octoPI,\" remarked  the creature, as if correcting her speech.    \"I suppose a lot of you would be a whole bakery!\" she said  scornfully.    \"Our name is Latin. It was given to us by learned scientists years  ago,\" said the Octopus.    \"That's true enough,\" agreed Cap'n Bill. \"The learned scientists  named ev'ry blamed thing they come across, an' gener'ly they picked  out names as nobody could understand or pernounce.\"    \"That isn't our fault, sir,\" said the Octopus. \"Indeed, it's pretty  hard for us to go through life with such terrible names. Think of  the poor little seahorse. He used to be a merry and cheerful fellow,  but since they named him 'hippocampus' he hasn't smiled once.\"    \"Let's go,\" said Trot. \"I don't like to 'sociate with octopuses.\"    \"OctoPI,\" said the creature, again correcting her.    \"You're jus' as horrid whether you're puses or pies,\" she declared.    \"Horrid!\" cried the monster in a shocked tone of voice.    \"Not only horrid, but horrible!\" persisted the girl.    \"May I ask in what way?\" he inquired, and it was easy to see he was  offended.    \"Why, ev'rybody knows that octopuses are jus' wicked an' deceitful,\"  she said. \"Up on the earth, where I live, we call the Stannerd Oil  Company an octopus, an' the Coal Trust an octopus, an'--\"    \"Stop, stop!\" cried the monster in a pleading voice. \"Do you mean to  tell me that the earth people whom I have always respected compare  me to the Stannerd Oil Company?\"    \"Yes,\" said Trot positively.    \"Oh, what a disgrace! What a cruel, direful, dreadful disgrace!\"  moaned the Octopus, drooping his head in shame, and Trot could see  great tears falling down his cheeks.    \"This comes of having a bad name,\" said the Queen gently, for she  was moved by the monster's grief.    \"It is unjust! It is cruel and unjust!\" sobbed the creature  mournfully. \"Just because we have several long arms and take  whatever we can reach, they accuse us of being like--like--oh, I  cannot say it! It is too shameful, too humiliating.\"    \"Come, let's go,\" said Trot again. So they left the poor octopus  weeping and wiping his watery eyes with his handkerchief and swam on  their way. \"I'm not a bit sorry for him,\" remarked the child, \"for  his legs remind me of serpents.\"    \"So they do me,\" agreed Cap'n Bill.    \"But the octopi are not very bad,\" said the Princess, \"and we get  along with them much better than we"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/436"],[0,"The Master Key (#10)"],[1,"into the soft earth.    A man rushed eagerly towards it, but the next moment he threw up his  hands and fell upon his back, unconscious.  Others who ran to assist  their fallen comrade quickly tumbled into a heap beside him.    It was evident to Rob that the tube had fallen in such a position that  the button was being pressed continually and a current of electric  fluid issued to shock whoever came near.  Not wishing to injure these  people he dropped to the ground and drew the tube from the earth, thus  releasing the pressure upon the button.    But the villagers had now decided that the boy was their enemy, and no  sooner had he touched the ground than a shower of stones and sticks  rained about him.  Not one reached his body, however, for the Garment  of Repulsion stopped their flight and returned them to rattle with more  or less force against those who had thrown them--\"like regular  boomerangs,\" thought Rob.    To receive their own blows in this fashion seemed so like magic to the  simple folk that with roars of fear and pain they ran away in all  directions.    \"It's no use stopping here,\" remarked Rob, regretfully, \"for I've  spoiled my welcome by this accident.  I think these people are Irish,  by their looks and speech, so I must be somewhere in the Emerald Isle.\"    He consulted his map and decided upon the general direction he should  take to reach England, after which he again rose into the air and  before long was passing over the channel towards the shores of England.    Either his map or compass or his calculations proved wrong, for it was  high noon before, having changed his direction a half dozen times, he  came to the great city of London.  He saw at a glance that it would  never do to drop into the crowded streets, unless he wanted to become  an object of public curiosity; so he looked around for a suitable place  to alight.    Near by was a monstrous church that sent a sharp steeple far into the  air.  Rob examined this spire and saw a narrow opening in the masonry  that led to a small room where a chime of bells hung.  He crept through  the opening and, finding a ladder that connected the belfry with a  platform below, began to descend.    There were three ladders, and then a winding flight of narrow, rickety  stairs to be passed before Rob finally reached a small room in the body  of the church.  This room proved to have two doors, one connecting with  the auditorium and the other letting into a side street.  Both were  locked, but Rob pointed the electric tube at the outside door and broke  the lock in an instant.  Then he walked into the street as composedly  as if he had lived all his life in London.    There were plenty of sights to see, you may be sure, and Rob walked  around until he was so tired that he was glad to rest upon one of the  benches in a beautiful park.  Here, half hidden by the trees, he amused  himself by looking at the Record of Events.    \"London's a great town, and no mistake,\" he said to himself; \"but let's  see what the British are doing in South Africa to-day.\"    He turned the cylinder to \"South Africa,\" and, opening the lid, at once  became interested.  An English column, commanded by a brave but  stubborn officer, was surrounded by the Boer forces and fighting  desperately to avoid capture or annihilation.    \"This would be interesting to King Edward,\" thought the boy.  \"Guess  I'll hunt him up and tell him about it.\"    A few steps away stood a policeman.  Rob approached him and asked:    \"Where's the king to-day?\"    The officer looked at him with mingled surprise and suspicion.    \"'Is Majesty is sojournin' at Marlb'ro 'Ouse, just now,\" was the reply.  \"Per'aps you wants to make 'im a wissit,\" he continued, with lofty  sarcasm.    \"That's it, exactly,\" said Rob.  \"I'm an American, and thought while I  was in London I'd drop in on His Royal Highness and say 'hello' to him.\"    The officer chuckled, as if much amused.    \"Hamericans is bloomin' green,\" he remarked, \"so youse can stand for  Hamerican, right enough.  No other wissitors is such blarsted fools.  But yon's the palace, an' I s'pose 'is Majesty'll give ye a 'ot  reception.\"    \"Thanks; I'll look him up,\" said the boy, and left the officer  convulsed with laughter.    He soon knew why.  The palace was surrounded by a cordon of the king's  own life guards, who admitted no one save those who presented proper  credentials.    \"There's only one thing to do;\" thought Rob, \"and that's to walk  straight in, as I haven't any friends to give me a regular  introduction.\"    So he boldly advanced to the gate, where he found himself stopped by  crossed carbines and a cry of \"Halt!\"    \"Excuse me,\" said Rob; \"I'm in a hurry.\"    He pushed the carbines aside and marched on.  The soldiers made thrusts  at him with their weapons, and an officer jabbed at his breast with a  glittering sword, but the Garment of Repulsion protected him from these  dangers as well as from a hail of bullets that followed his advancing  figure.    He reached the entrance of the palace only to face another group of  guardsmen and a second order to halt, and as these soldiers were over  six feet tall and stood shoulder to shoulder Rob saw that he could not  hope to pass them without using his electric tube.    \"Stand aside, you fellows!\" he ordered.    There was no response.  He extended the tube and, as he pressed the  button, described a semi-circle with the instrument.  Immediately the  tall guardsmen toppled over like so many tenpins, and Rob stepped  across their bodies and penetrated to the reception room, where a  brilliant assemblage awaited, in hushed and anxious groups, for  opportunity to obtain audience with the king.    \"I hope his Majesty isn't busy,\" said Rob to a solemn-visaged official  who confronted him.  \"I want to have a little talk with him.\"    \"I--I--ah--beg pardon!\" exclaimed the astounded master of ceremonies.  \"What name, please?\"    \"Oh, never mind my name,\" replied Rob, and pushing the gentleman aside  he entered the audience chamber of the great king.    King Edward was engaged in earnest consultation with one of his  ministers, and after a look of surprise in Rob's direction and a grave  bow he bestowed no further attention upon the intruder.    But Rob was not to be baffled now.    \"Your Majesty,\" he interrupted, \"I've important news for you.  A big  fight is taking place in South Africa and your soldiers will probably  be cut into mince meat.\"    The minister strode towards the boy angrily.    \"Explain this intrusion!\" he cried.    \"I have explained.  The Boers are having a regular killing-bee.  Here!  take a look at it yourselves.\"    He drew the Record from his pocket, and at the movement the minister  shrank back as if he suspected it was an infernal machine and might  blow his head off; but the king stepped quietly to the boy's side and  looked into the box when Rob threw open the lid.    As he comprehended the full wonder of the phenomenon he was observing  Edward uttered a low cry of amazement, but thereafter he silently gazed  upon the fierce battle that still raged far away upon the African VELD.  Before long his keen eye recognized the troops engaged and realized  their imminent danger.    \"They'll be utterly annihilated!\" he gasped.  \"What shall we do?\"    \"Oh, we can't do anything just now,\" answered Rob.  \"But it's curious  to watch how bravely the poor fellows fight for their lives.\"    The minister, who by this time was also peering into the box, groaned  aloud, and then all three forgot their surroundings in the tragedy they  were beholding.    Hemmed in by vastly superior numbers, the English were calmly and  stubbornly resisting every inch of advance and selling their lives as  dearly as possible.  Their leader fell pierced by a hundred bullets,  and the king, who had known him from boyhood, passed his hand across  his eyes as if to shut out the awful sight.  But the fascination of the  battle forced him to look again, and the next moment he cried aloud:    \"Look there!  Look there!\"    Over the edge of a line of hills appeared the helmets of a file of  English soldiers.  They reached the summit, followed by rank after  rank, until the hillside was alive with them.  And then, with a ringing  cheer that came like a faint echo to the ears of the three watchers,  they broke into a run and dashed forward to the rescue of their brave  comrades.  The Boers faltered, gave back, and the next moment fled  precipitately, while the exhausted survivors of the courageous band  fell sobbing into the arms of their rescuers.    Rob closed the lid of the Record with a sudden snap that betrayed his  deep feeling, and the king pretended to cough behind his handkerchief  and stealthily wiped his eyes.    \"'Twasn't so bad, after all,\" remarked the boy, with assumed  cheerfulness; \"but it looked mighty ticklish for your men at one time.\"    King Edward regarded the boy curiously, remembering his abrupt entrance  and the marvelous device he had exhibited.    \"What do you call that?\" he asked, pointing at the Record with a finger  that trembled slightly from excitement.    \"It is a new electrical invention,\" replied Rob, replacing it in his  pocket, \"and so constructed that events are reproduced at the exact  moment they occur.\"    \"Where can I purchase one?\" demanded the king, eagerly.    \"They're not for sale,\" said Rob.  \"This one of mine is the first that  ever happened.\"    \"Oh!\"    \"I really think,\" continued the boy, nodding sagely, \"that it wouldn't  be well to have these Records scattered around.  Their use would give  some folks unfair advantage over others, you know.\"    \"Certainly.\"    \"I only showed you this battle because I happened to be in London at  the time and thought you'd be interested.\"    \"It was very kind of you,\" said Edward; \"but how did you gain  admittance?\"    \"Well, to tell the truth, I was obliged to knock over a few of your  tall life-guards.  They seem to think you're a"]]]
