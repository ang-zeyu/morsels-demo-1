An hour  was sufficient to bring him to the base, where he halted.    He had not forgotten the warning of the trapper, but, like almost any  inexperienced person, he could not see any cause for alarm. He scanned  every part of the prairie and mountain that was in his field of  vision, but could detect nothing alarming.    He supposed the parting admonition of Baldy was merely a general  warning, such as a cautious person gives to one whom he has reason to  fear is somewhat careless in his conduct.    It therefore required little self-argument upon his part after putting  his man in proper 'condition,' to start off on a ramble up the  mountain side. It was not his intention to remain more than an hour or  so, unless he came across some game. He had a goodly quantity of  ammunition, and was careful that his rifle was loaded, so as not to be  taken unawares by any emergency.    Although Johnny Brainerd was afflicted with misshapen form, yet he was  very quick and active upon his feet, and bounded along over the rocks,  and across the chasms like a deer, with such a buoyancy of spirits  that he forgot danger.    However, he had gone but a short distance, when he was startled by a  low fierce growl, and turning his head, saw to his horror, that he had  nearly run against a colossal animal, which he at once recognized as  the dreaded grizzly bear.    Such a meeting would have startled an experienced hunter, and it was  therefore with no steady nerve that he hastily brought his piece to  his shoulder and fired.    The shot struck the bear in the body, doing just what his shot at the  buffalo had done some time before. It thoroughly angered him, without  inflicting anything like a serious wound. With a growl of fury the  brute made straight for him.    What would the boy have given, as he sped down the mountain side, were  he now in his wagon, whirled over the prairie at a rate which would  enable him to laugh to scorn any such speed as that of the brute.    At first he had hopes of reaching his refuge, but he was not long in  seeing that it was impossible, and found that if he escaped he must  find some refuge very speedily.    When he suddenly found himself beneath a goodly-sized tree it looked  like a providential indication to him, and throwing his gun to the  ground, he ascended the tree in the shortest time that he had ever  made.    He was none too soon as it was, for the bear was so close beneath him  that he felt the brush of its claws along his feet, as he nervously  jerked them beyond its reach.    Hastily scrambling to the very top of the tree, he secured himself  among the limbs, and then glanced down to see what his enemy was  doing. Great was his relief to find him sitting on his haunches,  contenting himself with merely casting wistful glances upward.    The sensation of even temporary safety was a relief, but when a full  hour had dragged by, with scarcely a single change of position upon  the part of the brute, Johnny began to ask himself what was to be the  end of all this.    It looked as though the grizzly had resolved in making his dinner upon  the youngster who had dared to fire a shot at him. The patience of an  animal is proverbially greater than that of a human being, and that of  the bear certainly exceeded to a great degree that of his expected  prey who crouched in the limbs above.                            CHAPTER XII. THE GRIZZLY BEAR.    FROM WHERE young Brainerd was perched on the tree it was impossible to  catch a glimpse of the steam man, so patiently awaiting his return.  The distance was also too great for him to make himself beard by the  miners, who were hard at work twenty miles away.    Fruitful in expedients, it was not long before the boy found a  resource in his trouble. Tearing a large strip from his coat, he tore  this into smaller strips, until he had secured a rope half a dozen  yards in length. Upon the end of this he placed a loop, and then,  descending to the lowest limb, he devoted himself to the task of  drooping it over the end of his gun. It fortunately had fallen in such  a manner that the muzzle was somewhat elevated, so that here was a  good opportunity for the exercise of his skill and patience.    When the first attempt was made the bear suddenly clawed at it and  tore it from the boy's hand before he could jerk it beyond his reach.  So he was compelled to make another one.    Nothing discouraged, the boy soon had this completed, and it was  dropped down more cautiously than before. When the grizzly made a  lunge at it, it was deftly twitched out of his way.    This was repeated several times, until the brute became disgusted with  the sport, and dropping down behind the tree, let the boy do all the  fishing he chose.    Now was his time, but the boy did not allow his eagerness to overcome  the steadiness of his nerves. It required no little skill, but he  finally succeeded in dropping the noose over the muzzle of the gun and  jerked it up taut.    With a heart beating high with hope, Johnny saw it lifted clear of the  ground, and he began carefully drawing it up. The grizzly looked  curiously at his maneuvers, and once made as if to move toward the  dangling rifle; but, ere his mind was settled, it was drawn beyond his  reach, and the cold muzzle was grasped in the hand of the eagerly  waiting boy.    While drawing it up, he had been debating with himself as to the best  means of killing the brute. Remembering that his first shot had done  no harm, he sensibly concluded that he had not yet learned the  vulnerable part of the monster.    His gun was loaded very carefully, and when everything was ready he  made a noise, to attract the attention of the brute. The bear looked  up instantly, when the gun was aimed straight at his right eye.    Ere the grizzly could withdraw his gaze, the piece was discharged, and  the bullet sped true, crashing into the skull of the colossal brute.  With a howling grunt, he rose upon his hind feet, clawed the air a few  moments, and then dropped dead.    Young Brainerd waited until he was certain that the last spark of life  had fled, when he cautiously descended the tree, scarcely able to  realize the truth that he had slain a grizzly bear, the monarch of the  western wilderness. But such was the fact, and he felt more pride at  the thought than if he had slain a dozen buffaloes.    'If I only had him in the wagon,' he reflected, 'I'd take him into  camp, for they will never believe I killed a grizzly bear.'    However, it occurred to him that he might secure some memento, and  accordingly he cut several claws and placed them in his pocket. This  done, he concluded that, as the afternoon was well advanced, it was  time he started homeward.    His hurried flight from the ferocious brute had bewildered him  somewhat, and, when he took the direction he judged to be the right  one, he found nothing familiar or remembered, from which fact he  concluded he was going astray.    But a little computation on his part, and he soon righted himself, and  was walking along quite hopefully, when he received another severe  shock of terror, at hearing the unmistakable whoop of an Indian,  instantly followed by several others.    Immediately he recalled the warning given by the trapper, and looked  furtively about, to make sure that he was not already in their hands.  His great anxiety now was to reach the steam man and leave the  neighborhood, which was rapidly becoming untenable.    So he began stealing forward as rapidly as possible, at the same time  keeping a sharp lookout for danger. It required a half-hour,  proceeding at this rate, before reaching the base of the mountain. The  moment he did so, he looked all around in quest of the steam man, whom  he had been compelled to desert for so long a time.    He discovered it standing several hundred yards away; but, to his  dismay, there were fully a dozen Indians standing and walking about  it, examining every portion with the greatest curiosity.    Here was a dilemma indeed, and the boy began to believe that he had  gotten himself into an inextricable difficulty, for how to reach the  steam man and renew the fire, under the circumstances, was a question  which might well puzzle an older head to answer.    It was unfortunate that the machine should have been taken at this  great disadvantage, for it was stripping it of its terror to those  Indians, who were such inveterate enemies to the whites. They had  probably viewed it with wonder and fear at first; but finding it  undemonstrative, had gradually gathered courage, until they had  congregated around it, and made as critical a scrutiny as they know  how.    Whatever fear or terror they had felt at first sight was now gone; for  they seemed on the most familiar terms with it.    Several climbed into the wagon, others passed in and around the helpless  giant, and one valiant follow bit him a thwack on the stomach with his  tomahawk.    This blow hurt the boy far more than it did the iron man, and he could  hardly repress a cry of pain, as he looked upon the destruction of his  wonderful friend as almost inevitable.    The savage, however, contented himself with this demonstration, and  immediately after walked away toward the mountain. The observant boy  knew what this meant, and he withdrew from his temporary hiding-place,  and started to watch him.    The fact that the Indian followed precisely the path taken by him, did  not remove the uneasiness, and he made up his mind that nothing but  danger was to come to him from this proceeding.    When the Indian had reached the spot where the dead grizzly bear lay,  he paused in the greatest wonderment. Here was something which he did  not understand.    The dead carcass showed that somebody had slain him, and the shot in  the eye looked as though it had been done by an experienced hunter.

A black swan and four  ducks, which they had shot on their way out, afforded a savoury meal for  those in the ship.    On the 31st the commander went up the freshwater river with Mr.  Barrallier.* (* This river had already been seen by Mr. Bowen.) At night  they encamped on its banks when there came on an exceeding heavy storm of  rain with thunder and lightning and high wind. They traced a branch of  the river on the right as far as their boat could go and then followed  its course on shore along the bank and found it was fed by the greater  river only. This carried them inland and they discovered marks of fires  made by the natives. The log book records that they met none of the  blacks at any place though there were native dog tracks in abundance.  \"Towards the end of this branching stream the country appeared to afford  plots of very rich pasture. At some considerable distance the land rose  to a height, and being covered with large trees which appeared to have  been shattered by storms had for this reason obtained the name of Mount  Rugged. We marched pretty far inland and found the country everywhere  free from inundations and exhibiting a very picturesque appearance. The  day was remarkably fine but in the woods the air was close and  disagreeably sultry. My people had killed a small black snake...the same  kind...is common about Sydney. We pursued our course up the river and Mr.  Barrallier completed his survey.\"    The water in the river was found to be good and perfectly sweet, and the  casks were filled. Among the birds seen was a bell-bird which has \"no  remarkable plumage but a note not unlike the tinkling of a bell, so that  when a number of these birds are collected together the noise they make  is similar to that made by the bells of a team of horses.\" The  laughing-bird (whose note can only be compared to the ha! ha! ha! of a  hearty laughing companion) was the first to salute the explorers in the  morning. The whistling duck, so called because of the whistling noise  made with its wings when flying, was shot here, and a grey parrot was  caught alive. Mr. Barrallier shot a rare cockatoo.* (* It was stuffed and  afterwards given to General Davies, R.A., by Governor King.) The wet  weather afterwards gave little chance of meeting with birds, and the  explorers made their way through the woods until they reached an  extensive level country. This plain extended out of their sight on the  one side and on the other was bounded by hills. Paths beaten down by  kangaroos crossed and recrossed it. The face of the country was almost  everywhere level and productive, free from swamp and secured from  inundation.    Grant thus describes the journey back to the ship: \"We returned to the  river-side and ordered the boat to drop lower down a few miles through a  forest of stately timber trees. I had a few of them cut down and brought  on board...I brought Governor King specimens of light woods and a species  of sassafras discovered by my second mate...On our way down the river we  stopped at the place where we had passed the preceding night and found  our fire still burning. To this spot we gave the name of The Halfway  House, being halfway up the river.\"    The commander now revisited Churchill's Island: \"I found my people had  cleared the spot I had laid out for a garden, and that there was nothing  wanting but to prepare the ground to receive such seeds as I should  choose to plant...It was no easy matter...for we had neither hoe nor  spade with us...however, we were in possession of a coal shovel which,  though it was thin and much worn, served the purpose.    \"My men, who slept on the ground they had cleared...in a hut built for  the occasion, informed me that one of their comrades was awakened out of  his sleep by some animal that seemed to be gnawing his hair. He supposed  it to be the bandicoot rat. I sent on board for a dog which we had  brought with us from Sydney. This dog remained with the people on the  island, and, as they reported to me, was one night engaged with some  animal apparently of equal strength, for it brought him to the ground and  made him howl...The ground was now prepared and I sowed my several sorts  of seeds, wheat, Indian corn, and peas, some grains of rice and some  coffee berries; and I did not forget to plant potatoes. With the trunks  of the trees I felled I raised a block house of 24 feet by 12 which will  probably remain some years, the supporters being well fixed in the  earth.\"    Full of enthusiasm regarding his visit in general, Grant is more so about  Churchill's Island: \"I scarcely know a place I should sooner call mine  than this little island.\" And he also tells how he planted the stones of  fruit trees round the hut which his men had built there. Of the traces of  iron seen, he adds: \"We turned up a few stones and some interspersed with  veins of iron ore, indeed so rich in metal that they had a visible effect  on the needle of our compass; stones of a like kind are found about  Sydney.\" In the pages of his journal and also of his log he describes  very minutely the manner in which European seeds were first sown in the  soil of the British colony of Victoria. That they were successfully  planted we learn from a subsequent page in Murray's log when he, in  command of the Lady Nelson, visited the same spot.    To return to the narrative. \"On the 12th* (* In the narrative, through a  printer's error, this date appears as 21st.) of April Mr. Bowen, while  seeking for water in the ship's launch, discovered near the mouth of the  freshwater river part of a canoe which had sunk near the mouth. He  brought it back to the ship together with two paddles and some fishing  line.\" The canoe differed greatly from those made by the natives of Port  Jackson, being framed out of timber, and instead of being tied together  at the ends \"was left open, the space being afterwards filled with grass  worked up with strong clay.\"    At the termination of the voyage, it was handed over, along with the  other specimens collected, to Governor King.    The Lady Nelson now changed her berth and moored close by the opposite  shore, \"in order to be near a small island lying in the opening of the  extensive arms described by Mr. Bass of which this port has two branching  out to the northward.\" Grant named this island Margaret Island in honour  of Mrs. Schanck who had given him several articles which proved useful on  board the Lady Nelson.    The tide ebbing very fast, the brig was soon in shoal water, but the  bottom being a soft mud and the weather calm there was no danger to be  apprehended, yet, says Grant: \"As I am no friend to vessels being on the  ground by carrying out a hawser I soon hauled her off and brought yet her  nearer to Margaret's Island. We found this island to be in general flat,  but well covered with wood. Here we deposited some seeds but did not find  the soil equally rich with that of Churchill's Island.\" Having lost some  of their drinking water, the Commander writes: \"Luckily I heard the  bullfrog, which is common in New South Wales, and I made towards the  thicket from whence his croaking issued and there found a present supply.  This arm reminded me of the appearance of Porchester Lake when the tide  is out. Indeed the entire view of Western Port has no small resemblance  to Spithead and Portsmouth Harbour. On the 17th we got under weigh and at  night brought up in 12 fathoms water with rather a foul bottom. In the  morning we discovered a sand shoal whereon the waves were breaking very  heavily close to us...We shifted our berth and brought up in a small nook  or bay which I named Elizabeth Cove in honour of Miss Elizabeth King,  daughter of Governor King, then at Sydney.\" The greater part of Grant's  survey of Western Port was completed by April 22nd, but the Lady Nelson  was detained there by bad weather until the 29th, when, at break of day,  she weighed and stood out of the port, passing to the westward of Seal  Islands.    Grant then proceeded to make a survey of the coast from Western Port  eastward as far as Wilson's Promontory, which he says he carried out for  a distance of seventy miles, but winter being now advanced little more  could be done in the way of surveying, and as the wet weather was  prejudicial to the instruments, he resolved to make the best of his way  to Sydney; bad weather caused the ship to put into Botany Bay, but she  eventually arrived on May 14th, 1801.    On his return to Sydney Grant refers to the good health of those on  board: \"I had not from the time of my departure a sick man among my  ship's company, one man only excepted, whose skull had been fractured.\"  He also tells us that while in Botany Bay he had the satisfaction of  receiving a letter from Governor King, in which he expressed himself well  pleased with what had been done.    We know that the Governor was keenly disappointed that Grant had failed  for the second time to explore Governor King's Bay and to fulfil other  duties which had been expected of him. The voyage, however, must have had  its compensations, as Barrallier was able not only to survey Jervis Bay  and Western Port (the map of the former is not at the Admiralty), but  also to obtain much of the information contained in the combined chart of  his \"discoveries made in Bass Strait up to March 1802,\" reproduced above.      CHAPTER 3.    COLONEL PATERSON AND LIEUTENANT GRANT SURVEY HUNTER RIVER.    During the month of May the Lady Nelson became more closely associated  with the town of Sydney, with whose fortunes her own were ever afterwards  identified.* (* The Lady Nelson was borne as a contingent expense of the  colony from the time of her arrival at Sydney until the 16th October,  1802, then as tender to H.M.S.
