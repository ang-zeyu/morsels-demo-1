Sheridan, General, United States Army â€” Complete (#10)"],[1,"Vancouver, distant about thirty-six miles, which they reached  that night; and communicated the condition of affairs.  As the  necessity for early relief to the settlers and the re-establishment  of communication with the Dalles were apparent, all the force that  could be spared was ordered out, and in consequence I immediately  received directions to go with my detachment of dragoons, numbering  about forty effective men, to the relief of the middle blockhouse,  which really meant to retake the Cascades.  I got ready at once, and  believing that a piece of artillery would be of service to me, asked  for one, but as there proved to be no guns at the post, I should have  been obliged to proceed without one had it not been that the regular  steamer from San Francisco to Portland was lying at the Vancouver  dock unloading military supplies, and the commander, Captain Dall,  supplied me with the steamer's small iron cannon, mounted on a wooden  platform, which he used in firing salutes at different ports on the  arrival and departure of the vessel.  Finding at the arsenal a supply  of solid shot that would fit the gun, I had it put upon the steamboat  Belle, employed to carry my command to the scene of operations, and  started up the Columbia River at 2 A.M. on the morning of the 27th.  We reached the Lower Cascades early in the day, where, selecting a  favorable place for the purpose, I disembarked my men and gun on the  north bank of the river, so that I could send back the steamboat to  bring up any volunteer assistance that in the mean time might have  been collected at Vancouver.    The Columbia River was very high at the time, and the water had  backed up into the slough about the foot of the Lower Cascades to  such a degree that it left me only a narrow neck of firm ground to  advance over toward the point occupied by the Indians.  On this neck  of land the hostiles had taken position, as I soon learned by  frequent shots, loud shouting, and much blustering; they, by the most  exasperating yells and indecent exhibitions, daring me to the  contest.    After getting well in hand everything connected with my little  command, I advanced with five or six men to the edge of a growth of  underbrush to make a reconnoissance.  We stole along under cover of  this underbrush until we reached the open ground leading over the  causeway or narrow neck before mentioned, when the enemy opened fire  and killed a soldier near my side by a shot which, just grazing the  bridge of my nose, struck him in the neck, opening an artery and  breaking the spinal cord.  He died instantly.  The Indians at once  made a rush for the body, but my men in the rear, coming quickly to  the rescue, drove them back; and Captain Doll's gun being now brought  into play, many solid shot were thrown into the jungle where they lay  concealed, with the effect of considerably moderating their  impetuosity.  Further skirmishing at long range took place at  intervals during the day, with little gain or loss, however, to  either side, for both parties held positions which could not be  assailed in flank, and only the extreme of rashness in either could  prompt a front attack.  My left was protected by the back water  driven into the slough by the high stage of the river, and my right  rested secure on the main stream.  Between us was only the narrow  neck of land, to cross which would be certain death.  The position of  the Indians was almost the exact counterpart of ours.    In the evening I sent a report of the situation back to Vancouver by  the steamboat, retaining a large Hudson's Bay bateau which I had  brought up with me.  Examining this I found it would carry about  twenty men, and made up my mind that early next morning I would cross  the command to the opposite or south side of the Columbia River, and  make my way up along the mountain base until I arrived abreast the  middle blockhouse, which was still closely besieged, and then at some  favorable point recross to the north bank to its relief, endeavoring  in this manner to pass around and to the rear of the Indians, whose  position confronting me was too strong for a direct attack.  This  plan was hazardous, but I believed it could be successfully carried  out if the boat could be taken with me; but should I not be able to  do this I felt that the object contemplated in sending me out would  miserably fail, and the small band cooped up at the block-house would  soon starve or fall a prey to the Indians, so I concluded to risk all  the chances the plan involved.    On the morning of March 28 the savages were still in my front, and  after giving them some solid shot from Captain Dall's gun we slipped  down to the river-bank, and the detachment crossed by means of the  Hudson's Bay boat, making a landing on the opposite shore at a point  where the south channel of the river, after flowing around Bradford's  Island, joins the main stream.  It was then about 9 o'clock, and  everything had thus far proceeded favorably, but examination of the  channel showed that it would be impossible to get the boat up the  rapids along the mainland, and that success could only be assured by  crossing the south channel just below the rapids to the island, along  the shore of which there was every probability we could pull the boat  through the rocks and swift water until the head of the rapids was  reached, from which point to the block-house there was smooth water.  Telling the men of the embarrassment in which I found myself, and  that if I could get enough of them to man the boat and pull it up the  stream by a rope to the shore we would cross to the island and make  the attempt, all volunteered to go, but as ten men seemed sufficient  I selected that number to accompany me.  Before starting, however, I  deemed it prudent to find out if possible what was engaging the  attention of the Indians, who had not yet discovered that we had left  their front.  I therefore climbed up the side of the abrupt mountain  which skirted the water's edge until I could see across the island.  From this point I observed the Indians running horse-races and  otherwise enjoying themselves behind the line they had held against  me the day before.  The squaws decked out in gay colors, and the men  gaudily dressed in war bonnets, made the scene most attractive, but  as everything looked propitious for the dangerous enterprise in hand  I spent little time watching them.  Quickly returning to the boat, I  crossed to the island with my ten men, threw ashore the rope attached  to the bow, and commenced the difficult task of pulling her up the  rapids.  We got along slowly at first, but soon striking a camp of  old squaws who had been left on the island for safety, and had not  gone over to the mainland to see the races, we utilized them to our  advantage.  With unmistakable threats and signs we made them not only  keep quiet, but also give us much needed assistance in pulling  vigorously on the towrope of our boat.    I was laboring under a dreadful strain of mental anxiety during all  this time, for had the Indians discovered what we were about, they  could easily have come over to the island in their canoes, and, by  forcing us to take up our arms to repel their attack, doubtless would  have obliged the abandonment of the boat, and that essential adjunct  to the final success of my plan would have gone down the rapids.  Indeed, under such circumstances, it would have been impossible for  ten men to hold out against the two or three hundred Indians; but the  island forming an excellent screen to our movements, we were not  discovered, and when we reached the smooth water at the upper end of  the rapids we quickly crossed over and joined the rest of the men,  who in the meantime had worked their way along the south bank of the  river parallel with us.  I felt very grateful to the old squaws for  the assistance they rendered.  They worked well under compulsion, and  manifested no disposition to strike for higher wages.  Indeed, I was  so much relieved when we had crossed over from the island and joined  the rest of the party, that I mentally thanked the squaws one and  all.  I had much difficulty in keeping the men on the main shore from  cheering at our success, but hurriedly taking into the bateau all of  them it could carry, I sent the balance along the southern bank,  where the railroad is now built, until both detachments arrived at a  point opposite the block-house, when, crossing to the north bank, I  landed below the blockhouse some little distance, and returned the  boat for the balance of the men, who joined me in a few minutes.    When the Indians attacked the people at the Cascades on the 26th,  word was sent to Colonel Wright, who had already got out from the  Dalles a few miles on his expedition to the Spokane country.  He  immediately turned his column back, and soon after I had landed and  communicated with the beleaguered block-house the advance of his  command arrived under Lieutenant-Colonel Edward J. Steptoe.  I  reported to Steptoe, and related what had occurred during the past  thirty-six hours, gave him a description of the festivities that were  going on at the lower Cascades, and also communicated the  intelligence that the Yakimas had been joined by the Cascade Indians  when the place was first attacked.  I also told him it was my belief  that when he pushed down the main shore the latter tribe without  doubt would cross over to the island we had just left, while the  former would take to the mountains.  Steptoe coincided with me in  this opinion, and informing me that Lieutenant Alexander Piper would  join my detachment with a mountain' howitzer, directed me to convey  the command to the island and gobble up all who came over to it.    Lieutenant Piper and I landed on the island with the first boatload,  and after disembarking the howitzer we fired two or three shots to  let the Indians know we had artillery"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4363"],[0,"Beyond Good and Evil (#10)"],[1,"we  find ourselves here, both with our speech and our silence, at the OTHER  extreme of all modern ideology and gregarious desirability, as their  antipodes perhaps? What wonder that we \"free spirits\" are not exactly  the most communicative spirits? that we do not wish to betray in every  respect WHAT a spirit can free itself from, and WHERE perhaps it will  then be driven? And as to the import of the dangerous formula, \"Beyond  Good and Evil,\" with which we at least avoid confusion, we ARE something  else than \"libres-penseurs,\" \"liben pensatori\" \"free-thinkers,\"  and whatever these honest advocates of \"modern ideas\" like to call  themselves. Having been at home, or at least guests, in many realms of  the spirit, having escaped again and again from the gloomy, agreeable  nooks in which preferences and prejudices, youth, origin, the accident  of men and books, or even the weariness of travel seemed to confine us,  full of malice against the seductions of dependency which he concealed  in honours, money, positions, or exaltation of the senses, grateful even  for distress and the vicissitudes of illness, because they always free  us from some rule, and its \"prejudice,\" grateful to the God, devil,  sheep, and worm in us, inquisitive to a fault, investigators to the  point of cruelty, with unhesitating fingers for the intangible, with  teeth and stomachs for the most indigestible, ready for any business  that requires sagacity and acute senses, ready for every adventure,  owing to an excess of \"free will\", with anterior and posterior souls,  into the ultimate intentions of which it is difficult to pry, with  foregrounds and backgrounds to the end of which no foot may run, hidden  ones under the mantles of light, appropriators, although we resemble  heirs and spendthrifts, arrangers and collectors from morning till  night, misers of our wealth and our full-crammed drawers, economical  in learning and forgetting, inventive in scheming, sometimes proud of  tables of categories, sometimes pedants, sometimes night-owls of  work even in full day, yea, if necessary, even scarecrows--and it is  necessary nowadays, that is to say, inasmuch as we are the born, sworn,  jealous friends of SOLITUDE, of our own profoundest midnight and midday  solitude--such kind of men are we, we free spirits! And perhaps ye are  also something of the same kind, ye coming ones? ye NEW philosophers?        CHAPTER III. THE RELIGIOUS MOOD      45. The human soul and its limits, the range of man's inner experiences  hitherto attained, the heights, depths, and distances of these  experiences, the entire history of the soul UP TO THE PRESENT TIME,  and its still unexhausted possibilities: this is the preordained  hunting-domain for a born psychologist and lover of a \"big hunt\". But  how often must he say despairingly to himself: \"A single individual!  alas, only a single individual! and this great forest, this virgin  forest!\" So he would like to have some hundreds of hunting assistants,  and fine trained hounds, that he could send into the history of the  human soul, to drive HIS game together. In vain: again and again he  experiences, profoundly and bitterly, how difficult it is to find  assistants and dogs for all the things that directly excite his  curiosity. The evil of sending scholars into new and dangerous  hunting-domains, where courage, sagacity, and subtlety in every sense  are required, is that they are no longer serviceable just when the \"BIG  hunt,\" and also the great danger commences,--it is precisely then that  they lose their keen eye and nose. In order, for instance, to divine and  determine what sort of history the problem of KNOWLEDGE AND CONSCIENCE  has hitherto had in the souls of homines religiosi, a person would  perhaps himself have to possess as profound, as bruised, as immense an  experience as the intellectual conscience of Pascal; and then he would  still require that wide-spread heaven of clear, wicked spirituality,  which, from above, would be able to oversee, arrange, and effectively  formulize this mass of dangerous and painful experiences.--But who  could do me this service! And who would have time to wait for such  servants!--they evidently appear too rarely, they are so improbable at  all times! Eventually one must do everything ONESELF in order to know  something; which means that one has MUCH to do!--But a curiosity like  mine is once for all the most agreeable of vices--pardon me! I mean to  say that the love of truth has its reward in heaven, and already upon  earth.    46. Faith, such as early Christianity desired, and not infrequently  achieved in the midst of a skeptical and southernly free-spirited world,  which had centuries of struggle between philosophical schools behind  it and in it, counting besides the education in tolerance which  the Imperium Romanum gave--this faith is NOT that sincere, austere  slave-faith by which perhaps a Luther or a Cromwell, or some other  northern barbarian of the spirit remained attached to his God and  Christianity, it is much rather the faith of Pascal, which resembles in  a terrible manner a continuous suicide of reason--a tough, long-lived,  worm-like reason, which is not to be slain at once and with a single  blow. The Christian faith from the beginning, is sacrifice the sacrifice  of all freedom, all pride, all self-confidence of spirit, it is at  the same time subjection, self-derision, and self-mutilation. There is  cruelty and religious Phoenicianism in this faith, which is adapted to a  tender, many-sided, and very fastidious conscience, it takes for granted  that the subjection of the spirit is indescribably PAINFUL, that all the  past and all the habits of such a spirit resist the absurdissimum, in  the form of which \"faith\" comes to it. Modern men, with their obtuseness  as regards all Christian nomenclature, have no longer the sense for the  terribly superlative conception which was implied to an antique taste by  the paradox of the formula, \"God on the Cross\". Hitherto there had never  and nowhere been such boldness in inversion, nor anything at once so  dreadful, questioning, and questionable as this formula: it promised a  transvaluation of all ancient values--It was the Orient, the PROFOUND  Orient, it was the Oriental slave who thus took revenge on Rome and its  noble, light-minded toleration, on the Roman \"Catholicism\" of non-faith,  and it was always not the faith, but the freedom from the faith, the  half-stoical and smiling indifference to the seriousness of the faith,  which made the slaves indignant at their masters and revolt against  them. \"Enlightenment\" causes revolt, for the slave desires the  unconditioned, he understands nothing but the tyrannous, even in morals,  he loves as he hates, without NUANCE, to the very depths, to the point  of pain, to the point of sickness--his many HIDDEN sufferings make  him revolt against the noble taste which seems to DENY suffering. The  skepticism with regard to suffering, fundamentally only an attitude of  aristocratic morality, was not the least of the causes, also, of the  last great slave-insurrection which began with the French Revolution.    47. Wherever the religious neurosis has appeared on the earth so far,  we find it connected with three dangerous prescriptions as to regimen:  solitude, fasting, and sexual abstinence--but without its being possible  to determine with certainty which is cause and which is effect, or IF  any relation at all of cause and effect exists there. This latter doubt  is justified by the fact that one of the most regular symptoms among  savage as well as among civilized peoples is the most sudden and  excessive sensuality, which then with equal suddenness transforms into  penitential paroxysms, world-renunciation, and will-renunciation, both  symptoms perhaps explainable as disguised epilepsy? But nowhere is it  MORE obligatory to put aside explanations around no other type has there  grown such a mass of absurdity and superstition, no other type seems to  have been more interesting to men and even to philosophers--perhaps it  is time to become just a little indifferent here, to learn caution, or,  better still, to look AWAY, TO GO AWAY--Yet in the background of the  most recent philosophy, that of Schopenhauer, we find almost as the  problem in itself, this terrible note of interrogation of the religious  crisis and awakening. How is the negation of will POSSIBLE? how is the  saint possible?--that seems to have been the very question with which  Schopenhauer made a start and became a philosopher. And thus it was a  genuine Schopenhauerian consequence, that his most convinced adherent  (perhaps also his last, as far as Germany is concerned), namely, Richard  Wagner, should bring his own life-work to an end just here, and should  finally put that terrible and eternal type upon the stage as Kundry,  type vecu, and as it loved and lived, at the very time that the  mad-doctors in almost all European countries had an opportunity to study  the type close at hand, wherever the religious neurosis--or as I call  it, \"the religious mood\"--made its latest epidemical outbreak and  display as the \"Salvation Army\"--If it be a question, however, as to  what has been so extremely interesting to men of all sorts in all ages,  and even to philosophers, in the whole phenomenon of the saint, it  is undoubtedly the appearance of the miraculous therein--namely, the  immediate SUCCESSION OF OPPOSITES, of states of the soul regarded as  morally antithetical: it was believed here to be self-evident that  a \"bad man\" was all at once turned into a \"saint,\" a good man. The  hitherto existing psychology was wrecked at this point, is it not  possible it may have happened principally because psychology had placed  itself under the dominion of morals, because it BELIEVED in oppositions  of moral values, and saw, read, and INTERPRETED these oppositions  into the text and facts of the case? What? \"Mir"]]]
