I speak  of the rare tracts in which the old barbarous hospitality still  lingers. You make one more at his eating tray, and an additional  mattress appears in the sleeping-room. When you depart, you leave if  you like a little present, merely for a memorial, with your  entertainer; he would be offended if you offered it him openly as a  remuneration, and you give    [p.37]some trifling sums to the servants. Thus you will be welcome  wherever you go. If perchance you are detained perforce in such a  situation,-which may easily happen to you, medical man,-you have only  to make yourself as disagreeable as possible, by calling for all manner  of impossible things. Shame is a passion with Eastern nations. Your  host would blush to point out to you the indecorum of your conduct; and  the laws of hospitality oblige him to supply the every want of a guest,  even though he be a detenu.    But of all Orientals, the most antipathetical companion to an  Englishman is, I believe, an East-Indian. Like the fox in the fable,  fulsomely flattering at first, he gradually becomes easily friendly,  disagreeably familiar, offensively rude, which ends by rousing the  \"spirit of the British lion.\" Nothing delights the Hindi so much as an  opportunity of safely venting the spleen with which he regards his  victors.[FN#11] He will sit in the presence of a    [p.38]magistrate, or an officer, the very picture of cringing  submissiveness. But after leaving the room, he is as different from his  former self as a counsel in court from a counsel at a concert, a sea  captain at a club dinner from a sea captain on his quarter-deck. Then  he will discover that the English are not brave, nor clever, nor  generous, nor civilised, nor anything but surpassing rogues; that every  official takes bribes, that their manners are utterly offensive, and  that they are rank infidels. Then he will descant complacently upon the  probability of a general Bartholomew's Day in the East, and look  forward to the hour when enlightened Young India will arise and drive  the \"foul invader\" from the land.[FN#12] Then he will submit his  political opinions nakedly, that India should be wrested from the  Company and given to the Queen, or taken from the Queen and given to  the French. If the Indian has been a European traveller, so much the  worse for you. He has blushed to own,-explaining, however , conquest by  bribery,-that 50,000 Englishmen hold 150,000,000 of his compatriots in  thrall, and for aught you know, republicanism may have become his idol.  He has lost all fear of the white face, and having been accustomed to  unburden his mind in    \"The land where, girt by friend or foe,  A man may say the thing he will,\"-    he pursues the same course in other lands where it is exceedingly  misplaced. His doctrines of liberty and    [p.39]equality he applies to you personally and practically, by not  rising when you enter or leave the room,-at first you could scarcely  induce him to sit down,-by not offering you his pipe, by turning away  when you address him; in fact, by a variety of similar small affronts  which none knows better to manage skilfully and with almost impalpable  gradations. If-and how he prays for it!-an opportunity of refusing you  anything presents itself, he does it with an    \"In rice strength,  In an Indian manliness,[FN#13]\"    say the Arabs. And the Persians apply the following pithy tale to their  neighbours. \"Brother,\" said the leopard to the jackal, \"I crave a few  of thy cast-off hairs; I want them for medicine;[FN#14] where can I  find them?\" \"Wa'llahi!\" replied the jackal, \"I don't exactly know-I  seldom change my coat-I wander about the hills. Allah is  bounteous,[FN#15] brother! hairs are not so easily shed.\"    Woe to the unhappy Englishman, Pasha, or private soldier, who must  serve an Eastern lord! Worst of all, if the master be an Indian, who,  hating all Europeans,[FN#16]  [p.40]adds an especial spite to Oriental coarseness, treachery, and  tyranny. Even the experiment of associating with them is almost too  hard to bear. But a useful deduction may be drawn from such  observations; and as few have had greater experience than myself, I  venture to express my opinion with confidence, however unpopular or  unfashionable it may be.    I am convinced that the natives of India cannot respect a European who  mixes with them familiarly, or especially who imitates their customs,  manners, and dress. The tight pantaloons, the authoritative voice, the  pococurante manner, and the broken Hindustani impose upon them-have a  weight which learning and honesty, which wit and courage, have not.  This is to them the master's attitude: they bend to it like those  Scythian slaves that faced the sword but fled from the horsewhip. Such  would never be the case amongst a brave people, the Afghan for  instance; and for the same reason it is not so, we read, with \"White  Plume,\" the North American Indian. \"The free trapper combines in the  eye of an Indian (American) girl, all that is dashing and heroic in a  warrior of her own race, whose gait and garb and bravery he emulates,  with all that is gallant and glorious in the white man.\" There is but  one cause for this phenomenon; the \"imbelles Indi\" are still, with few  exceptions,[FN#17] a cowardly and slavish people, who would raise  themselves by depreciating those superior to them in the scale of  creation. The Afghans and American aborigines, being chivalrous races,  rather exaggerate the valour of their foes, because by so doing they  exalt their own.[FN#18]    [FN#1] Villages notorious for the peculiar Egyptian revelry, an  undoubted relic of the good old times, when \"the most religious of men\"  revelled at Canopus with an ardent piety in honour of Isis and Osiris.  [FN#2] \"Haykal\" was a pleasant fellow, who, having basely abused the  confidence of the fair ones of Wardan, described their charms in  sarcastic verse, and stuck his scroll upon the door of the village  mosque, taking at the same time the wise precaution to change his  lodgings without delay. The very mention of his name affronts the brave  Wardanenses to the last extent, making them savage as Oxford bargees.  [FN#3] The Barrage is a handsome bridge,-putting the style of  architecture out of consideration,-the work of French engineers,  originally projected by Napoleon the First. It was intended to act as a  dam, raising the waters of the Nile and conducting them to Suez, the  salt lakes, and a variety of other places, through a number of canals,  which, however, have not yet been opened. Meanwhile, it acts upon the  river's trunk as did the sea of old upon its embouchures, blocking it  up and converting the land around it to the condition of a swamp.  Moreover, it would have cleaned out the bed by means of sluice gates,  forming an artificial increase of current to draw off the deposit; but  the gates are wanting, so the piers, serving only to raise the soil by  increasing the deposit of silt, collect and detain suspended matter,  which otherwise would not settle. Briefly, by a trifling expenditure  the Barrage might be made a blessing to Egypt; in its present state it  is a calamity, an \"enormous, cruel wonder,\" more crushing to the people  than were the pyramids and sphinxes of old.  [FN#4] Those skilled in simples, Eastern as well as Western, praise  garlic highly, declaring that it \"strengthens the body, prepares the  constitution for fatigue, brightens the sight, and, by increasing the  digestive power, obviates the ill-effects arising from sudden change of  air and water.\" The traveller inserts it into his dietary in some  pleasant form, as \"Provence-butter,\" because he observes that, wherever  fever and ague abound, the people, ignorant of cause but observant of  effect, make it a common article of food. The old Egyptians highly  esteemed this vegetable, which, with onions and leeks, enters into the  list of articles so much regretted by the Hebrews (Numbers, xi. 5;  Koran, chap. 2). The modern people of the Nile, like the Spaniards,  delight in onions, which, as they contain between 25 and 30 per cent.  of gluten, are highly nutritive. In Arabia, however, the stranger must  use this vegetable sparingly. The city people despise it as the food of  a Fellah-a boor. The Wahhabis have a prejudice against onions, leeks,  and garlic, because the Prophet disliked their strong smell, and all  strict Moslems refuse to eat them immediately before visiting the  mosque, or meeting for public prayer.

Some authors relate a more  facetious termination of the colloquy.Â—M.C. de Perceval (Essai, &c., vol.  iii. p. 314.)  [FN#14] Â“Limping Osman,Â” as the Persians contemptuously call him, was slain  by rebels, and therefore became a martyr according to the Sunnis. The  ShiÂ’ahs justify the murder, saying it was the act of an Â“Ijma al-Muslimin,Â”  or the general consensus of Al-Islam, which in their opinion ratifies  an act of Â“lynch law.Â”  [FN#15] This specifying the father Affan, proves him to have been a  Moslem. Abu BakrÂ’s father, Â“Kahafah,Â” and OmarÂ’s Â“Al-Khattab,Â” are not mentioned by  name in the Ceremonies of Visitation.  [FN#16] The Christian reader must remember that the Moslems rank  angelic nature, under certain conditions, below human nature.  [FN#17] Osman married two daughters of the Prophet, a circumstance  which the Sunnis quote as honourable to him: the ShiÂ’ahs, on the  contrary, declare that he killed them both by ill-treatment.  [FN#18] These men are generally descendants of the Saint whose tomb  they own: they receive pensions from the Mudir of the Mosque, and  retain all fees presented to them by visitors. Some families are  respectably supported in this way.  [FN#19] This woman, according to some accounts, also saved MohammedÂ’s  life, when an Arab Kahin or diviner, foreseeing that the child was  destined to subvert the national faith, urged the bystanders to bury  their swords in his bosom. The Sharifs of Meccah still entrust their  children to the Badawin, that they may be hardened by the discipline of  the Desert. And the late Pasha of Egypt gave one of his sons in charge  of the Anizah tribe, near Akabah. Burckhardt (Travels in Arabia, vol.  i. p. 427) makes some sensible remarks about this custom, which cannot  be too much praised.  [FN#20] Al- Â“Sadiyah,Â” a double entendre; it means auspicious, and also  alludes to HalimahÂ’s tribe, the Benu SaÂ’ad.  [FN#21] Both these words are titles of the Prophet. Al-Mustafa means  the Â“ChosenÂ”; Al-Mujtaba, the Â“Accepted.Â”  [FN#22] There being, according to the Moslems, many heavens and many  earths.  [FN#23] See chapter xx.  [FN#24] The ShafeÂ’i school allows its disciples to curse Al-Yazid, the  son of MuÂ’awiyah, whose cruelties to the descendants of the Prophet, and  crimes and vices, have made him the Judas Iscariot of Al-Islam. I have  heard Hanafi Moslems, especially Sayyids, revile him; but this is not,  strictly speaking, correct. The ShiÂ’ahs, of course, place no limits to  their abuse of him. You first call a man Â“Omar,Â” then Â“Shimr,Â” (the slayer of  Al-Hosayn), and lastly, Â“Yazid,Â” beyond which insult does not extend.  [FN#25] Ukayl or Akil, as many write the name, died at Damascus, during  the Caliphate of Al-MuÂ’awiyah. Some say he was buried there, others that  his corpse was transplanted to Al-Madinah, and buried in a place where  formerly his house, known as Â“Dar Ukayl,Â” stood.  [FN#26] Some are of opinion that the ceremonies of Ziyarat formerly  did, and still should begin here. But the order of visitation differs  infinitely, and no two authors seem to agree. I was led by Shaykh  Hamid, and indulged in no scruples.  [FN#27] Burckhardt makes a series of mistakes upon this subject. Â“Hassan  ibn Aly, whose trunk only lies buried here (in El Bakia), his head  having been sent to Cairo, where it is preserved in the fine Mosque  called El-Hassanya.Â” The Mosque Al-Hasanayn (the Â“two HasansÂ”) is supposed to  contain only the head of Al-Hosayn, which, when the Crusaders took  Ascalon, was brought from thence by Sultan Salih or Beybars, and  conveyed to Cairo. As I have said before, the Persians in Egypt openly  show their contempt of this tradition. It must be remembered that  Al-Hasan died poisoned at Al-Madinah by his wife JaÂ’adah. Al-Hosayn, on  the other hand, was slain and decapitated at Kerbela. According to the  ShiÂ’ahs, Zayn al-Abidin obtained from Yazid, after a space of forty days,  his fatherÂ’s head, and carried it back to Kerbela, for which reason the  event is known to the Persians as Â“Chilleyeh sar o tan,Â” the Â“forty days of  (separation between) the head and trunk.Â” They vehemently deny that the  body lies at Kerbela, and the head at Cairo. Others, again, declare  that Al-HosaynÂ’s head was sent by Yazid to Amir bin al-As, the governor  of Al-Madinah, and was by him buried near FatimahÂ’s Tomb. Nor are they  wanting who declare, that after YazidÂ’s death the head was found in his  treasury, and was shrouded and buried at Damascus. Such is the  uncertainty which hangs over the early history of Al-Islam[.]  [FN#28] The names of the fifth and sixth Imams, Mohammed al-Bakia and  JaÂ’afar al-Sadik, were omitted by Hamid, as doubtful whether they are  really buried here or not.  [FN#29] Moslem historians seem to delight in the obscurity which hangs  over the ladyÂ’s last resting-place, as if it were an honour even for the  receptacle of her ashes to be concealed from the eyes of men. Some  place her in the Harim, relying upon this tradition: Â“Fatimah, feeling  about to die, rose up joyfully, performed the greater ablution, dressed  herself in pure garments, spread a mat upon the floor of her house near  the ProphetÂ’s Tomb, lay down fronting the Kiblah, placed her hand under  her cheek, and said to her attendant, Â“I am pure and in a pure dress; now  let no one uncover my body, but bury me where I lie!Â” When Ali returned  he found his wife dead, and complied with her last wishes. Omar bin Abd  al-Aziz believed this tradition, when he included the room in the  Mosque; and generally in Al-Islam Fatimah is supposed to be buried in  the Harim. Those who suppose the ProphetÂ’s daughter to be buried in  Al-Bakia rely upon a saying of the Imam Hasan, Â“If men will not allow me  to sleep beside my grandsire, place me in Al-Bakia, by my mother.Â” They  give the following account of his death and burial. His body was bathed  and shrouded by Ali and Omar Salmah. Others say that Asma Bint Umays,  the wife of Abu Bakr, was present with Fatimah, who at her last hour  complained of being carried out, as was the custom of those days, to  burial like a man. Asma promised to make her a covered bier, like a  brideÂ’s litter, of palm sticks, in shape like what she had seen in  Abyssinia: whereupon Fatimah smiled for the first time after her fatherÂ’s  death, and exacted from her a promise to allow no one entrance as long  as her corpse was in the house. Ayishah, shortly afterwards knocking at  the door, was refused admittance by Asma; the former complained of this  to her father, and declared that her stepmother had been making a brideÂ’s  litter to carry out the corpse. Abu Bakr went to the door, and when  informed by his wife that all was the result of FatimahÂ’s orders, he  returned home making no objection. The death of the ProphetÂ’s daughter  was concealed by her own desire from high and low; she was buried at  night, and none accompanied her bier, or prayed at her grave, except  Ali and a few relatives. The ShiÂ’ahs found a charge of irreverence and  disrespect against Abu Bakr for absence on this occasion. The third  place which claims FatimahÂ’s honoured remains, is a small Mosque in  Al-Bakia, South of the Sepulchre of Abbas. It was called Bayt  al-HuznÂ—House of MourningÂ—because here the lady passed the end of her days,  lamenting the loss of her father. Her tomb appears to have formerly  been shown there. Now visitors pray, and pray only twice,Â—at the Harim,  and in the Kubbat al-Abbasiyah.  [FN#30] The other celebrities in Al-Bakia are:Â—    Fatimah bint AsÂ’ad, mother of Ali. She was buried with great religious  pomp. The Prophet shrouded her with his own garment (to prevent hell  from touching her), dug her grave, lay down in it (that it might never  squeeze or be narrow to her), assisted in carrying the bier, prayed  over her, and proclaimed her certain of future felicity. Over her tomb  was written, Â“The grave hath not closed upon one like Fatimah, daughter  of AsÂ’ad.Â” Historians relate that Mohammed lay down in only four graves: 1.  KhadijahÂ’s, at Meccah. 2. KasimÂ’s, her son by him. 3. That of Umm Ruman,  AyishahÂ’s mother. 4. That of Abdullah al-Mazni, a friend and companion.    Abd al-Rahman bin Auf was interred near Osman bin MazÂ’un. Ayishah offered  to bury him in her house near the Prophet, but he replied that he did  not wish to narrow her abode, and that he had promised to sleep by the  side of his friend MazÂ’un. I have already alluded to the belief that none  has been able to occupy the spare place in the Hujrah.    Ibn Hufazah al-Sahmi, who was one of the Ashab al-Hijratayn (who had  accompanied both flights, the greater and the lesser), here died of a  wound received at Ohod, and was buried in Shawwal, A.H. 3, one month  after Osman bin MazÂ’un.    Abdullah bin MasÂ’ud, who, according to others, is buried at Kufah.    SaÂ’ad ibn Zararah, interred near Osman bin MazÂ’un.    SaÂ’ad bin MaÂ’az, who was buried by the Prophet. He died of a wound received  during the battle of the Moat.    Abd al-Rahman al-Ausat, son of Omar, the Caliph. He was generally known  as Abu Shahmah, the Â“Father of FatÂ”: he sickened and died, after receiving  from his father the religious floggingÂ—impudicitiae causa.    Abu Sufiyan bin al-Haris, grandson of Abd al-Muttalib. He was buried  near Abdullah bin JaÂ’afar al-Tayyar, popularly known as the Â“most generous  of the Arabs,Â” and near Ukayl bin Abi Talib, the brother of Ali mentioned  above.    These are the principal names mentioned by popular authors. The curious  reader will find in old histories a multitude of others, whose graves  are now utterly forgotten at Al-Madinah.  [FN#31] See chapter xix.  [FN#32] The story is related in another way. Whilst Mohammed was  praying the Asr or afternoon prayer at the Harim he turned his face  towards Meccah. Some of the Companions ran instantly to all the  Mosques, informing the people of the change. In many places they were  not"]]]
