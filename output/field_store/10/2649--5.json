It was now October, 1830. A revelation had been given through the mouth  of the prophet in which elders Oliver Cowdery, Peter Whitmer, Tiber  Peterson and Parley P. Pratt were appointed to go into the wilderness  through the Western States, and to the Indian Territory.    These elders journeyed until they came to the spiritual pastorate of  Sydney Rigdon, in Ohio. He received the elders cordially, and Parley  presented his former friend and instructor with the Book of Mormon, and  related to him the history of the same.    \"The news of our coming,\" says Parley, \"was soon noised abroad, and the  news of the discovery of the Book of Mormon and the marvelous events  connected with it. The interest and excitement now became general in  Kirtland, and in all the region round about. The people thronged us  night and day, insomuch that we had no time for rest or retirement.  Meetings were convened in different neighborhoods, and multitudes came  together soliciting our attendance; while thousands flocked about us  daily, some to be taught, some for curiosity, some to obey the gospel,  and some to dispute or resist it.    \"In two or three weeks from our arrival in the neighborhood with the  news, we had baptized one hundred and twenty-seven souls; and this  number soon increased to one thousand. The disciples were filled with  joy and gladness; while rage and lying was abundantly manifested by  gainsayers. Faith was strong, joy was great, and persecution heavy.    \"We proceeded to ordain Sidney Rigdon, Isaac Morley, John Murdock,  Lyman Wight, Edward Partridge, and many others to the ministry; and  leaving them to take care of the churches, and to minister the gospel,  we took leave of the saints, and continued our journey.\"    Thus was fulfilled the vision of \"Mother Whitney.\" Kirtland had  heard the \"word of the Lord.\" The angel that spoke from the cloud,  at midnight, in Kirtland, was endowed with the gift of prophesy. The  \"daughter of the voice\" which followed Israel down through the ages was  potent still--was still an oracle to the children of the covenant.    Footnotes:    1. She died in the early persecution of the church, and when Parley was  in prison for the gospel's sake her spirit visited and comforted him.        CHAPTER VIII.    WAR OF THE INVISIBLE POWERS--THEIR MASTER--JEHOVAH'S MEDIUM.    \"You have prayed me here! Now what do you want of me?\"    The Master had come!    But who was he?    Whence came he?    Good or evil?    Whose prayers had been answered?    --    There was in Kirtland a controversy between the powers of good and  evil, for the mastery. Powers good and evil it would seem to an  ordinary discernment. Certainly powers representing two sources.    This was the prime manifestation of the new dispensation. This  contention of the invisibles for a foothold among mortals.    A Mormon iliad! for such it is! It is the epic of two worlds, in which  the invisibles, with mortals, take their respective parts.    And now it is the dispensation of the fullness of times! Now all the  powers visible and invisible contend for the mastery of the earth in  the stupendous drama of the last days. This is what Mormonism means.    It is a war of the powers above and below to decide who shall give the  next civilization to earth; which power shall incarnate that supreme  civilization with its spirit and genius.    Similar how exactly this has been repeated since Moses and the  magicians of Egypt, and Daniel and the magicians of Babylon, contended.    One had risen up in the august name of Jehovah. Mormonism represents  the powers invisible of the Hebrew God.    Shall Jehovah reign in the coming time? Shall he be the Lord God  omnipotent? This, in its entirety, is the Mormon problem.    Joseph is the prophet of that stupendous question, to be decided in  this grand controversy of the two worlds--this controversy of mortals  and immortals!    There are lords many and gods many, but to the prophet and his people  there is but one God--Jehovah is his name.    A Mormon iliad, nothing else; and a war of the invisibles--a war of  spiritual empires.    That war was once in Kirtland, when the first temple of a new  civilization rose, to proclaim the supreme name of the God of Israel.    No sooner had the Church of Latter-day Saints been established in  the West than remarkable spiritual manifestations appeared. This was  exactly in accordance with the faith and expectations of the disciples;  for the promise to them was that these signs should follow the believer.    But there was a power that the saints could not understand. That it was  a power from the invisible world all readily discerned.    An influence both strange and potent! The power which was not  comprehended was greater, for the time, in its manifestations, than the  spirit which the disciples better understood.    These spiritual manifestations occurred remarkably at the house of  Elder Whitney, where the saints met often to speak one to the other,  and to pray for the power.    The power had come!    It was in the house which had been overshadowed by the magic cloud at  midnight, out of which the angel had prophesied of the coming of the  word of the Lord.    The Lord had come!    His word was given. But which Lord? and whose word? That was the  question in that hour of spiritual controversy.    Similar manifestations were also had in other branches of the church;  and they were given at those meetings called \"testimony meetings.\" At  these the saints testified one to the other of the \"great work of God  in the last days,\" and magnified the gifts of the spirit. But there  were two kinds of gifts and two kinds of spirits.    Some of these manifestations were very similar to those of \"modern  spiritualism.\" Especially was this the case with what are styled  physical manifestations.    Others read revelations from their hands; holding them up as a book  before them. From this book they read passages of new scriptures. Books  of new revelations had been unsealed.    In letters of light and letters of gold, writing appeared to their  vision, on the hands of these \"mediums.\"    What was singular and confounding to the elders was that many, who  could neither read nor write, while under \"the influence,\" uttered  beautiful language extemporaneously. At this these \"mediums\" of the  Mormon Church (twenty years before our \"modern mediums\" were known),  would exclaim concerning the \"power of God\" manifested through them;  challenging the elders, after the spirit had gone out of them, with  their own natural inability to utter such wonderful sayings, and do  such marvelous things.    As might be expected the majority of these \"mediums\" were among the  sisters. In modern spiritual parlance, they were more \"inspirational.\"  Indeed for the manifestation of both powers the sisters have always  been the \"best mediums\" (adopting the descriptive epithet now so  popular and suggestive).    And this manifestation of the \"two powers\" in the church followed  the preaching of the Mormon gospel all over the world, especially in  America and Great Britain. It was God's spell and the spell of some  other spiritual genius.    Where the one power was most manifested, there it was always found that  the power from the \"other source\" was about equally displayed.    So abounding and counterbalancing were these two powers in nearly all  the branches of the church in the early rise of Mormonism, in America  and Great Britain, that spiritual manifestations became regarded very  generally as fire that could burn as well as bless and build up the  work of God.    An early hymn of the dispensation told that \"the great prince of  darkness was mustering his forces;\" that a battle was coming \"between  the two kingdoms;\" that the armies were \"gathering round,\" and that  they would \"soon in close battle be found.\"    To this is to be attributed the decline of spiritual gifts in a later  period in the Mormon Church, for the \"spirits\" were poured out so  abundantly that the saints began to fear visions, and angels, and  prophesy, and the \"speaking in tongues.\"    Thus the sisters, who ever are the \"best mediums\" of spiritual gifts in  the church, have, in latter years, been shorn of their glory. But the  gifts still remain with them; and the prophesy is that some day, when  there is sufficient wisdom combined with faith, more than the primitive  power will be displayed, and the angels will daily walk and talk with  the people of God.    But in Kirtland in that day there was the controversy of the invisibles.    --    It was in the beginning of the year 1831 that a sleigh drove into the  little town of Kirtland. There were in it a man and his wife with her  girl, and a man servant driving.    They seemed to be travelers, and to have come a long distance rather  than from a neighboring village; indeed they had come from another  State; hundreds of miles from home now; far away in those days for a  man to be thus traveling in midwinter with his wife.    But they were not emigrants; at least seemingly not such; certainly not  emigrants of an ordinary kind.    No caravan followed in their wake with merchandise for the western  market, nor a train of goods and servants to make a home in a  neighboring State.    A solitary sleigh; a man with his wife and two servants; a solitary  sleigh, and far from home.    That they were not fugitives was apparent in the manly boldness of  the chief personage and the somewhat imperial presence of the woman  by his side. This personal air of confidence, and a certain conscious  importance, were quite marked in both, especially in the man.    They were two decided personages come West. Some event was in their  coming. This much the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54337"],[0,"Reminiscences of Joseph, the Prophet, and the Coming Forth of the Book of Mormon (#10)"],[1," stone very much like the Prophet's seer stone, and after  the Prophet had looked an unusual length of time, he raised his head,  saying, \"Martin, what in the world is the matter? all is dark as  Egypt.\" Martin smiled, and confessed. Joseph said, \"Martin, why did you  do this?\" Martin answered: \"To stop the mouths of fools, who tell me  you know all this by heart, and are deceiving me.\"    Father Sanford Porter, while living in Jackson County, Mo., in 1832,  Was desirous to know how the Prophet translated the characters which  were engraven on the gold plates, and made it a matter of prayer. While  the Prophet was receiving a revelation in Jackson County, Missouri,  Father Porter was present in the room and while observing that the  Prophet would speak a sentence to be written by a scribe engaged for  that purpose, the scribe would say, \"It is written,\" and if written  correctly the sentence before the Prophet would disappear and another  sentence would appear likewise, but if not written correctly by the  scribe the sentence would remain, and after the necessary correction  had been made, the sentence would disappear.    Many years ago Father Porter related to me that it was shown unto  him, that by the aid of the Urim and Thummim the Prophet could see a  sentence as if in gold letters, which he would read, and when it was  written another sentence would appear. Martin Harris stated to me  as above that when he had written the sentence that was presented,  if written correctly it would disappear and another sentence would  appear, and so continue. At the conclusion of the revelation Joseph was  receiving, Father Porter said that the Prophet remarked that he had  never found such great faith as was manifested in that house on that  occasion.    The writer is satisfied that there never was a greater prophet, seer  and revelator on this earth than Joseph Smith, the Prophet of God.    CHAPTER 4    The Seven Lines of Characters that were translated by Joseph Smith are  taken by Martin Harris to Prof. Anthon, fulfilling the words of the  Prophet Isaiah, 29th chapter: \"Read this, I pray thee, but he says, I  cannot, for it is sealed.\"    The seven lines of characters presented in the accompanying engraving  were copied by the hand of Joseph Smith in Harmony, Pennsylvania, in  the year 1827, he then being in the twenty-second year of his age. They  were copied from a book of gold plates which he found hidden in a stone  box, the box being nicely jointed together and set in cement. The six  slabs of stone forming the box were so dressed that they were smooth  and square on the inside, but rough on the outside. Indeed, they were  so rough that the capstone, which was crowning, looked something like  a cobblestone, for at the time of being found a small portion was laid  bare and protruded from the hill side. No one, unless in possession  of the knowledge of what was therein contained, would have paid any  attention to the stone in passing.    Most certainly, it was very ingeniously constructed and hidden in a  very choice spot of ground. It was first found in the spring of 1823,  and the young man who found it was only in the seventeenth year of  his age. He was too young and inexperienced at that time to receive  so valuable a treasure, for it must be in weight about forty pounds  or more of pure gold, and in sheets that were very thin like unto  thin sheets of tin plate; and they were covered with engravings of  a very curious workmanship, showing great skill by those who were  the engravers. There were several different persons who did the  work of engraving. The plates contained a history which reached out  over a period of a thousand years, beginning 600 B. C., and continuing  until 420 AD. The history had necessarily to be very brief, and when  translated was called the Book of Mormon--that is, the portion which  was translated, for there is a portion yet held in reserve, which was  sealed with three extra rings, and which will yet, in the due time of  the Lord, be revealed and translated.    All these plates were fastened together with three great rings, so  that each plate could be turned over in the same manner as if hinged  together. So we are led to see that these people were very skilled,  and were also careful in preserving their history. That history brings  to light who the people were that left so many ruined cities, towers,  temples and other relics, many of which are found with hieroglyphics of  a similar character to the seven lines presented. The Book of Mormon,  translated from those plates, makes a book of 623 pages, and is at  the present time printed in about fifteen different languages. In the  box with the gold plates was a breast-plate made of gold and valued  at about five hundred dollars. Attached to this breast-plate was a  Urim and Thummim or interpreters. The latter was in form like unto  an old-fashioned pair of spectacles, two clear stones set in rims of  silver. I have conversed with Martin Harris, who handled them, and he  said he had placed them as he would a pair of spectacles, but they were  too large for him, as if they had been made for a larger race of people  than the present generation.    This Urim and Thummim was similar to what we read of in the Bible of  olden times and which only belonged to seers, revelators and prophets.  These were hidden with the book, to help the one to whom they should be  entrusted to translate them correctly.    The hill from whence those plates were taken is fully described in  another chapter.    I will vouch for the correctness of the characters, as I have compared  them with the original copy, which is still in existence, intact,  just as it was when Martin Harris, as a messenger, took it with the  translation Joseph Smith had made, to Professor Anthon of New York.  The copy here presented was traced from the original copy, and this  engraving, made by Mr. John Held, of Salt Lake City, is an exact  reproduction of it.    In the year 1871 I was favored with the privilege of bringing Martin  Harris from Kirtland, Ohio, to Utah. While on our journey, I had many  opportunities of conversing with him upon this subject, as well as  upon many other incidents which occurred at the early period of the  translation. Soon after presenting the seven lines of characters to  Professor Anthon, be (Martin Harris) aided the young Prophet by acting  as scribe during a portion of the translation. The learned Professor  Anthon, after having the lines of characters presented to him, examined  them carefully, and gave a certificate stating that they were Egyptian  characters and had been correctly translated. Mr. Harris, with the  certificate, started to leave, but when he had advanced as far as the  door, the Professor called to him, asking where he obtained those  plates. Harris replied:    \"In a hill near Palmyra, New York.\"    \"Then bring the book to me and I will translate the plates for you.\"    \"I can not do so,\" said Martin, \"for a part of them is sealed.\"    \"Then,\" replied Mr. Anthon, \"I cannot read a sealed book,\" upon which  he recalled the certificate and tore it up.    Martin Harris said to me, \"At that time I was not aware that the  Prophet Isaiah, in the twenty-ninth chapter of his writings, had  predicted that those exact words would be uttered and the prophecy thus  fulfilled by Prof. Anthon. For the better information of the reader  we will refer to the book of Isaiah, beginning at the 11th and 12th  verses, which reads as follows:     \"And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that   is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this,   I pray thee: and he said, I cannot, for it is sealed. And the book [not   the words or seven lines of characters] is delivered to him that is not   learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.    It is well known that Joseph Smith was not learned, and claimed to  be only a farmer's boy without the opportunities for a scholastic  education; for he had, as Peter the fisherman, to work for his living.    Permit me to offer some striking evidence to show that the Prophet was  not learned, by the word directly over the lines of characters. How  natural it would be for a boy unlearned to leave out the silent h and  further to substitute the o for the e, as it is written by his own  hand, thus--Caractors. This I offer as evidence of the fulfillment of  Isaiah's words, 29th chapter and 12th verse, \"I am not learned.\"    Well, indeed, may the prophet say in the same chapter:    \"Cry ye out, and cry; they are drunken, but not with wine; they  stagger, but not with strong drink.\"    I ask what kind of drunkenness can this mean, unless as really inferred  by Isaiah's own words: \"For the Lord hath poured out upon you the  spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your  rulers, the seers hath he covered.\"    At the time the book came forth there were upon the earth no prophets  or seers to guide the people. There had been prophets from the time of  Adam to Moses and from Moses to Jesus Christ, John the Revelator being  the last prophet of that time, 96 AD.    And the Book came forth and a new prophet arose after that long period,  and at a time when people were drunken with confusion regarding the  true religious light, for there were about six hundred different  religious sects staggering against each other, each one claiming to be  the true church that Christ established, with one lord, one faith, one  baptism, and one God and Father of all.    Every Bible student should know that Jesus placed in his church: first,  twelve apostles, then seventies, elders, pastors, teachers, gifts and  blessings for the perfecting of the saints. After the apostasy from  the Church of Christ, the mother of harlots made all nations drunken  with the wine of her fornication, divided up into fragments, without  prophets, seers or revelators.
