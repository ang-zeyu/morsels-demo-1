She was motionless. They would have thought her asleep, but her eyes  were not closed. She was dead. The poor child's sorrows and sufferings  were ended forever.    The stern Republicans who now held dominion over England, men of iron  as they were, could not but be touched with the unhappy fate of this  their beautiful and innocent victim; and they so far relented from the  severity of the policy which they had pursued toward the ill-fated  family as to send the little Gloucester, after his sister's death,  home to his mother.          CHAPTER V.    THE PRINCE'S RECEPTION AT PARIS.        So complicated a story as that of the family of Charles can not be  related, in all its parts, in the exact order of time; and having now  shown under what circumstances the various members of the family made  their escape from the dangers which threatened them in England, we  return to follow the adventures of Prince Charles during his residence  on the Continent, and, more particularly in this chapter, to describe  his reception by the royal family of France. He was one of the first  of the children that escaped, having arrived in France in 1646. His  father was not beheaded until two years afterward.    In order that the reader may understand distinctly the situation in  which Charles found himself on his arrival at Paris, we must first  describe the condition of the royal family of France at this time.  They resided sometimes at Fontainebleau, a splendid palace in the midst  of a magnificent park about forty miles from the city. Henrietta, it  will be recollected, was the sister of a king of France. This king was  Louis XIII. He died, however, not far from the time of Queen Henrietta's  arrival in the country, leaving his little son Louis, then five years  old, heir to the crown. The little Louis of course became king  immediately, in name, as Louis XIV., and in the later periods of his  life he attained to so high a degree of prosperity and power, that he  has been, ever since his day, considered one of the most renowned of  all the French kings. He was, of course, Prince Charles's cousin. At  the period of Prince Charles's arrival, however, he was a mere child,  being then about eight years old. Of course, he was too young really  to exercise any of the powers of the government. His mother, Anne of  Austria, was made regent, and authorized to govern the country until  the young king should arrive at a suitable age to exercise his  hereditary powers in his own name. Anne of Austria had been always  very kind to Henrietta, and had always rendered her assistance whenever  she had been reduced to any special extremity of distress. It was she  who had sent the supplies of money and clothing to Henrietta when she  fled, sick and destitute, to Exeter, vainly hoping to find repose and  the means of restoration there.    Besides King Louis XIII., who had died, Henrietta had another brother,  whose name was Gaston, duke of Orleans. The Duke of Orleans had a  daughter, who was styled the Duchess of Montpensier, deriving the title  from her mother. She was, of course, also a cousin of Prince Charles.  Her father, being brother of the late king, and uncle of the present  one, was made lieutenant general of the kingdom, having thus the second  place, that is, the place next to the queen, in the management of the  affairs of the realm. Thus the little king commenced his reign by  having in his court his mother as queen regent, his uncle lieutenant  general, and his aunt, an exiled queen from a sister realm, his guest.  He had also in his household his brother Philip, younger than himself,  his cousin the young Duchess of Montpensier, and his cousin the Prince  Charles. The family relationship of all these individuals will be made  more clear by being presented in a tabular form, as follows:      ROYAL FAMILY OF FRANCE IN THE TIME OF LOUIS XIV.              Louis XIII.                   Louis XIV.            Anne of Austria.              Philip, 8 years old.    HENRY IV  Gaston, duke of Orleans.      Duchess of Montpensier  Duchess of Montpensier.              Henrietta Maria.              Prince Charles, 16.            King Charles I.      In the above table, the first column contains the name of Henry IV.,  the second those of three of his children, with the persons whom they  respectively married, and the third the four grandchildren, who, as  cousins, now found themselves domesticated together in the royal palaces  of France.    The young king was, as has already been said, about eight years old  at the time of Prince Charles's arrival. The palace in which he resided  when in the city was the Palace Royal, which was then, and has been  ever since, one of the most celebrated buildings in the world. It was  built at an enormous expense, during a previous reign, by a powerful  minister of state, who was, in ecclesiastical rank, a cardinal, and  his mansion was named, accordingly, the Palace Cardinal. It had,  however, been recently taken as a royal residence, and its name changed  to Palace Royal. Here the queen regent had her grand apartments of  state, every thing being as rich as the most lavish expenditure could  make it. She had one apartment, called an oratory, a sort of closet  for prayer, which was lighted by a large window, the sash of which was  made of silver. The interior of the room was ornamented with the most  costly paintings and furniture, and was enriched with a profusion of  silver and gold. The little king had his range of apartments too, with  a whole household of officers and attendants as little as himself.  These children were occupied continually with ceremonies, and pageants,  and mock military parades, in which they figured in miniature arms and  badges of authority, and with dresses made to imitate those of real  monarchs and ministers of state. Every thing was regulated with the  utmost regard to etiquette and punctilio, and without any limits or  bounds to the expense. Thus, though the youthful officers of the little  monarch's household exercised no real power, they displayed all the  forms and appearances of royalty with more than usual pomp and splendor.  It was a species of child's play, it is true, but it was probably the  most grand and magnificent child's play that the world has ever  witnessed. It was into this extraordinary scene that Prince Charles  found himself ushered on his arrival in France.    At the time of the prince's arrival the court happened to be residing,  not at Paris, but at Fontainebleau. Fontainebleau, as has already been  stated, is about forty miles from Paris, to the southward. There is  a very splendid palace and castle there, built originally in very  ancient times. There is a town near, both the castle and the town being  in the midst of a vast park and forest, one of the most extended and  magnificent royal domains in Europe. This forest has been reserved as  a hunting ground for the French kings from a very early age. It covers  an area of forty thousand acres, being thus many miles in extent. The  royal family were at this palace at the time of Prince Charles's  arrival, celebrating the festivities of a marriage. The prince  accordingly, as we shall presently see, went there to join them.    There were two persons who were anticipating the prince's arrival in  France with special interest, his mother, and his young cousin, the  Duchess of Montpensier. Her Christian name was Anne Marie Louisa.  [Footnote: She is commonly called, in the annals of the day in which  she lived, _Mademoiselle_, as she was, _par eminence_, the young lady  of the court. In history she is commonly called Mademoiselle de  Montpensier; we shall call her, in this narrative, simply Anne Maria,  as that is, for our purpose, the most convenient designation.] She was  a gay, frivolous, and coquettish girl, of about nineteen, immensely  rich, being the heiress of the vast estates of her mother, who was not  living. Her father, though he was the lieutenant general of the realm,  and the former king's brother, was not rich. His wife, when she died,  had bequeathed all her vast estates to her daughter Anne Maria was  naturally haughty and vain, and; as her father was accustomed to come  occasionally to her to get supplies of money, she was made vainer and  more self-conceited still by his dependence upon her. Several matches  had been proposed to her, and among them the Emperor of Germany had  been named. He was a widower. His first wife, who had been Anne Maria's  aunt, had just died. As the emperor was a potentate of great importance,  the young belle thought she should prefer him to any of the others who  had been proposed, and she made no secret of this her choice. It is  true that he had made no proposal to her, but she presumed that he  would do so after a suitable time had elapsed from the death of his  first wife, and Anne Maria was contented to wait, considering the lofty  elevation to which she would attain on becoming his bride.    But Queen Henrietta Maria had another plan. She was very desirous to  obtain Anne Maria for the wife of her son Charles. There were many  reasons for this. The young lady was a princess of the royal family  of France; she possessed, too, an immense fortune, and was young and  beautiful withal, though not quite so young as Charles himself. He was  sixteen, and she was about nineteen. It is true that Charles was now,  in some sense, a fugitive and an exile, destitute of property, and  without a home. Still he was a prince. He was the heir apparent of the  kingdoms of England and Scotland. He was young and accomplished. These  high qualifications, somewhat exaggerated, perhaps, by maternal  partiality, seemed quite sufficient to Henrietta to induce the proud  duchess to become the prince's bride.

Titanic: Its Story and Its Lessons (#10)"],[1,"d, but  imagine that they were cut in the same way, for we were washed clear  of the Titanic at once by the force of the stream and floated away as  the oars were got out.    I think we all felt that that was quite the most exciting thing we had  yet been through, and a great sigh of relief and gratitude went up as  we swung away from the boat above our heads; but I heard no one cry  aloud during the experience--not a woman's voice was raised in fear or  hysteria. I think we all learnt many things that night about the bogey  called \"fear,\" and how the facing of it is much less than the dread of  it.    The crew was made up of cooks and stewards, mostly the former, I  think; their white jackets showing up in the darkness as they pulled  away, two to an oar: I do not think they can have had any practice in  rowing, for all night long their oars crossed and clashed; if our  safety had depended on speed or accuracy in keeping time it would have  gone hard with us. Shouting began from one end of the boat to the  other as to what we should do, where we should go, and no one seemed  to have any knowledge how to act. At last we asked, \"Who is in charge  of this boat?\" but there was no reply. We then agreed by general  consent that the stoker who stood in the stern with the tiller should  act as captain, and from that time he directed the course, shouting to  other boats and keeping in touch with them. Not that there was  anywhere to go or anything we could do. Our plan of action was simple:  to keep all the boats together as far as possible and wait until we  were picked up by other liners. The crew had apparently heard of the  wireless communications before they left the Titanic, but I never  heard them say that we were in touch with any boat but the Olympic: it  was always the Olympic that was coming to our rescue. They thought  they knew even her distance, and making a calculation, we came to the  conclusion that we ought to be picked up by her about two o'clock in  the afternoon. But this was not our only hope of rescue: we watched  all the time the darkness lasted for steamers' lights, thinking there  might be a chance of other steamers coming near enough to see the  lights which some of our boats carried. I am sure there was no feeling  in the minds of any one that we should not be picked up next day: we  knew that wireless messages would go out from ship to ship, and as one  of the stokers said: \"The sea will be covered with ships to-morrow  afternoon: they will race up from all over the sea to find us.\" Some  even thought that fast torpedo boats might run up ahead of the  Olympic. And yet the Olympic was, after all, the farthest away of them  all; eight other ships lay within three hundred miles of us.    How thankful we should have been to know how near help was, and how  many ships had heard our message and were rushing to the Titanic's  aid. I think nothing has surprised us more than to learn so many ships  were near enough to rescue us in a few hours. Almost immediately after  leaving the Titanic we saw what we all said was a ship's lights down  on the horizon on the Titanic's port side: two lights, one above the  other, and plainly not one of our boats; we even rowed in that  direction for some time, but the lights drew away and disappeared  below the horizon.    But this is rather anticipating: we did none of these things first. We  had no eyes for anything but the ship we had just left. As the oarsmen  pulled slowly away we all turned and took a long look at the mighty  vessel towering high above our midget boat, and I know it must have  been the most extraordinary sight I shall ever be called upon to  witness; I realize now how totally inadequate language is to convey to  some other person who was not there any real impression of what we  saw.    But the task must be attempted: the whole picture is so intensely  dramatic that, while it is not possible to place on paper for eyes to  see the actual likeness of the ship as she lay there, some sketch of  the scene will be possible. First of all, the climatic conditions were  extraordinary. The night was one of the most beautiful I have ever  seen: the sky without a single cloud to mar the perfect brilliance of  the stars, clustered so thickly together that in places there seemed  almost more dazzling points of light set in the black sky than  background of sky itself; and each star seemed, in the keen  atmosphere, free from any haze, to have increased its brilliance  tenfold and to twinkle and glitter with a staccato flash that made the  sky seem nothing but a setting made for them in which to display their  wonder. They seemed so near, and their light so much more intense than  ever before, that fancy suggested they saw this beautiful ship in dire  distress below and all their energies had awakened to flash messages  across the black dome of the sky to each other; telling and warning of  the calamity happening in the world beneath. Later, when the Titanic  had gone down and we lay still on the sea waiting for the day to dawn  or a ship to come, I remember looking up at the perfect sky and  realizing why Shakespeare wrote the beautiful words he puts in the  mouth of Lorenzo:--        \"Jessica, look how the floor of heaven    Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold.    There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st    But in his motion like an angel sings,    Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubims;    Such harmony is in immortal souls;    But whilst this muddy vesture of decay    Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.\"      But it seemed almost as if we could--that night: the stars seemed  really to be alive and to talk. The complete absence of haze produced  a phenomenon I had never seen before: where the sky met the sea the  line was as clear and definite as the edge of a knife, so that the  water and the air never merged gradually into each other and blended  to a softened rounded horizon, but each element was so exclusively  separate that where a star came low down in the sky near the clear-cut  edge of the waterline, it still lost none of its brilliance. As the  earth revolved and the water edge came up and covered partially the  star, as it were, it simply cut the star in two, the upper half  continuing to sparkle as long as it was not entirely hidden, and  throwing a long beam of light along the sea to us.    In the evidence before the United States Senate Committee the captain  of one of the ships near us that night said the stars were so  extraordinarily bright near the horizon that he was deceived into  thinking that they were ships' lights: he did not remember seeing such  a night before. Those who were afloat will all agree with that  statement: _we_ were often deceived into thinking they were  lights of a ship.    And next the cold air! Here again was something quite new to us: there  was not a breath of wind to blow keenly round us as we stood in the  boat, and because of its continued persistence to make us feel cold;  it was just a keen, bitter, icy, motionless cold that came from  nowhere and yet was there all the time; the stillness of it--if one  can imagine \"cold\" being motionless and still--was what seemed new and  strange.    And these--the sky and the air--were overhead; and below was the sea.  Here again something uncommon: the surface was like a lake of oil,  heaving gently up and down with a quiet motion that rocked our boat  dreamily to and fro. We did not need to keep her head to the swell:  often I watched her lying broadside on to the tide, and with a boat  loaded as we were, this would have been impossible with anything like  a swell. The sea slipped away smoothly under the boat, and I think we  never heard it lapping on the sides, so oily in appearance was the  water. So when one of the stokers said he had been to sea for  twenty-six years and never yet seen such a calm night, we accepted it  as true without comment. Just as expressive was the remark of  another--\"It reminds me of a bloomin' picnic!\" It was quite true; it  did: a picnic on a lake, or a quiet inland river like the Cam, or a  backwater on the Thames.    And so in these conditions of sky and air and sea, we gazed broadside  on the Titanic from a short distance. She was absolutely still--indeed  from the first it seemed as if the blow from the iceberg had taken all  the courage out of her and she had just come quietly to rest and was  settling down without an effort to save herself, without a murmur of  protest against such a foul blow. For the sea could not rock her: the  wind was not there to howl noisily round the decks, and make the ropes  hum; from the first what must have impressed all as they watched was  the sense of stillness about her and the slow, insensible way she sank  lower and lower in the sea, like a stricken animal.    The mere bulk alone of the ship viewed from the sea below was an  awe-inspiring sight. Imagine a ship nearly a sixth of a mile long, 75  feet high to the top decks, with four enormous funnels above the  decks, and masts again high above the funnels; with her hundreds of  portholes, all her saloons and other rooms brilliant with light, and  all round her, little boats filled with those who until a few hours  before had trod her decks and read in her libraries and listened to  the music of her band in happy content; and who were now looking up in  amazement at the enormous mass above them and rowing away from her  because she was sinking.    I had often wanted to see her from some distance away, and only a few  hours before, in conversation at lunch with a fellow-passenger, had  registered a vow to get a proper view of her lines and dimensions when  we landed at New York: to stand some distance away to take in a full  view of her beautiful proportions, which the narrow approach to the  dock at Southampton made impossible. Little did I think that the  opportunity was to be found so quickly and so dramatically. The"]]]
