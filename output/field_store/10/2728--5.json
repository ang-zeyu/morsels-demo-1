Such  extension or continuance of a certain generic character is, on the other  hand, not apprehended on the apprehension of the first individual, and  perception of the latter kind thence is 'non-determinate.' That it is  such is not due to non-apprehension of structure, colour, generic  character and so on, for all these attributes are equally objects of  sensuous perception (and hence perceived as belonging to the first  individual also). Moreover that which possesses structure cannot be  perceived apart from the structure, and hence in the case of the  apprehension of the first individual there is already perception of  structure, giving rise to the judgment 'The thing is such and such.' In  the case of the second, third, &c., individuals, on the other hand, we  apprehend, in addition to the thing possessing structure and to the  structure itself, the special attribute of the persistence of the  generic character, and hence the perception is 'determinate.' From all  this it follows that perception never has for its object that which is  devoid of all difference.          The bhedâbheda view is untenable.    The same arguments tend to refute the view that there is difference and  absence of difference at the same time (the so-called bhedâbheda view).  Take the judgment 'This is such and such'; how can we realise here the  non-difference of 'being this' and 'being such and such'? The 'such and  such' denotes a peculiar make characterised, e.g. by a dewlap, the  'this' denotes the thing distinguished by that peculiar make; the  non-difference of these two is thus contradicted by immediate  consciousness. At the outset the thing perceived is perceived as  separate from all other things, and this separation is founded on the  fact that the thing is distinguished by a special constitution, let us  say the generic characteristics of a cow, expressed by the term 'such  and such.' In general, wherever we cognise the relation of  distinguishing attribute and thing distinguished thereby, the two  clearly present themselves to our mind as absolutely different.  Somethings--e.g. staffs and bracelets--appear sometimes as having a  separate, independent existence of their own; at other times they  present themselves as distinguishing attributes of other things or  beings (i.e. of the persons carrying staffs or wearing bracelets). Other  entities--e.g. the generic character of cows--have a being only in so  far as they constitute the form of substances, and thus always present  themselves as distinguishing attributes of those substances. In both  cases there is the same relation of distinguishing attribute and thing  distinguished thereby, and these two are apprehended as absolutely  different. The difference between the two classes of entities is only  that staffs, bracelets, and similar things are capable of being  apprehended in separation from other things, while the generic  characteristics of a species are absolutely incapable thereof. The  assertion, therefore, that the difference of things is refuted by  immediate consciousness, is based on the plain denial of a certain form  of consciousness, the one namely--admitted by every one--which is  expressed in the judgment 'This thing is such and such.'--This same  point is clearly expounded by the Sûtrakâra in II, 2, 33.          Inference also teaches difference.    Perception thus having for its object only what is marked by difference,  inference also is in the same case; for its object is only what is  distinguished by connexion with things known through perception and  other means of knowledge. And thus, even in the case of disagreement as  to the number of the different instruments of knowledge, a thing devoid  of difference could not be established by any of them since the  instruments of knowledge acknowledged by all have only one and the same  object, viz. what is marked by difference. And a person who maintains  the existence of a thing devoid of difference on the ground of  differences affecting that very thing simply contradicts himself without  knowing what he does; he is in fact no better than a man who asserts  that his own mother never had any children.          Perception does not reveal mere being.    In reply to the assertion that perception causes the apprehension of  pure Being only, and therefore cannot have difference for its object;  and that 'difference' cannot be defined because it does not admit of  being set forth in definite alternatives; we point out that these  charges are completely refuted by the fact that the only objects of  perception are things distinguished by generic character and so on, and  that generic character and so on--as being relative things--give at once  rise to the judgment as to the distinction between themselves and the  things in which they inhere. You yourself admit that in the case of  knowledge and in that of colour and other qualities this relation holds  good, viz. that something which gives rise to a judgment about another  thing at the same time gives rise to a judgment about itself; the same  may therefore be admitted with regard to difference [FOOTNOTE 44:1].    For this reason the charge of a regressus in infinitum and a logical  seesaw (see above, p. 32) cannot be upheld. For even if perceptive  cognition takes place within one moment, we apprehend within that moment  the generic character which constitutes on the one hand the difference  of the thing from others, and on the other hand the peculiar character  of the thing itself; and thus there remains nothing to be apprehended in  a second moment.    Moreover, if perception made us apprehend only pure Being judgments  clearly referring to different objects--such as 'Here is a jar,' 'There  is a piece of cloth'--would be devoid of all meaning. And if through  perception we did not apprehend difference--as marked by generic  character, &c., constituting the structure or make of a thing, why  should a man searching for a horse not be satisfied with finding a  buffalo? And if mere Being only were the object of all our cognitions,  why should we not remember, in the case of each particular cognition,  all the words which are connected with all our cognitions? And further,  if the cognition of a horse and that of an elephant had one object only,  the later cognition would cause us to apprehend only what was  apprehended before, and there being thus no difference (of object of  cognition) there would be nothing to distinguish the later state of  cognition from remembrance. If on the other hand a difference is  admitted for each state of consciousness, we admit thereby that  perception has for its objects things affected with difference.    If all acts of cognition had one and the same object only, everything  would be apprehended by one act of cognition; and from this it would  follow that there are no persons either deaf or blind!    Nor does, as a matter of fact, the eye apprehend mere Being only; for  what it does apprehend is colour and the coloured thing, and those other  qualities (viz. extension, &c.), which inhere in the thing together with  colour. Nor does feeling do so; for it has for its objects things  palpable. Nor have the ear and the other senses mere Being for their  object; but they relate to what is distinguished by a special sound or  taste or smell. Hence there is not any source of knowledge causing us to  apprehend mere Being. If moreover the senses had for their object mere  Being free from all difference, it would follow that Scripture which has  the same object would (not be originative of knowledge but) perform the  function of a mere anuvâda, i.e. it would merely make statements about  something, the knowledge of which is already established by some other  means. And further, according to your own doctrine, mere Being, i.e.  Brahman, would hold the position of an object with regard to the  instruments of knowledge; and thus there would cling to it all the  imperfections indicated by yourself--non-intelligent nature,  perishableness and so on.--From all this we conclude that perception has  for its object only what is distinguished by difference manifesting  itself in generic character and so on, which constitute the make or  structure of a thing. (That the generic character of a thing is nothing  else but its particular structure follows) from the fact that we do not  perceive anything, different from structure, which could be claimed as  constituting the object of the cognition that several individuals  possess one and the same general form. And as our theory sufficiently  accounts for the ordinary notions as to generic character, and as  moreover even those who hold generic character to be something different  from structure admit that there is such a thing as (common) structure,  we adhere to the conclusion that generic character is nothing but  structure. By 'structure' we understand special or distinctive form; and  we acknowledge different forms of that kind according to the different  classes of things. And as the current judgments as to things being  different from one another can be explained on the basis of the  apprehension of generic character, and as no additional entity is  observed to exist, and as even those who maintain the existence of such  an additional thing admit the existence of generic character, we further  conclude that difference (bheda) is nothing but generic character (jâti).--  But if this were so, the judgment as to difference would immediately  follow from the judgment as to generic character, as soon as the latter  is apprehended!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/73"],[0,"The Red Badge of Courage: An Episode of the American Civil War (#10)"],[1,"to bury  himself.  He wished to get out of hearing of the crackling shots which  were to him like voices.    The ground was cluttered with vines and bushes, and the trees grew  close and spread out like bouquets.  He was obliged to force his way  with much noise.  The creepers, catching against his legs, cried out  harshly as their sprays were torn from the barks of trees.  The  swishing saplings tried to make known his presence to the world.  He  could not conciliate the forest.  As he made his way, it was always  calling out protestations.  When he separated embraces of trees and  vines the disturbed foliages waved their arms and turned their face  leaves toward him.  He dreaded lest these noisy motions and cries  should bring men to look at him.  So he went far, seeking dark and  intricate places.    After a time the sound of musketry grew faint and the cannon boomed in  the distance.  The sun, suddenly apparent, blazed among the trees.  The  insects were making rhythmical noises.  They seemed to be grinding  their teeth in unison.  A woodpecker stuck his impudent head around the  side of a tree.  A bird flew on lighthearted wing.    Off was the rumble of death.  It seemed now that Nature had no ears.    This landscape gave him assurance.  A fair field holding life.  It was  the religion of peace.  It would die if its timid eyes were compelled  to see blood.  He conceived Nature to be a woman with a deep aversion  to tragedy.    He threw a pine cone at a jovial squirrel, and he ran with chattering  fear.  High in a treetop he stopped, and, poking his head cautiously  from behind a branch, looked down with an air of trepidation.    The youth felt triumphant at this exhibition.  There was the law, he  said.  Nature had given him a sign.  The squirrel, immediately upon  recognizing danger, had taken to his legs without ado.  He did not  stand stolidly baring his furry belly to the missile, and die with an  upward glance at the sympathetic heavens.  On the contrary, he had fled  as fast as his legs could carry him; and he was but an ordinary  squirrel, too--doubtless no philosopher of his race.  The youth wended,  feeling that Nature was of his mind.  She re-enforced his argument with  proofs that lived where the sun shone.    Once he found himself almost into a swamp.  He was obliged to walk upon  bog tufts and watch his feet to keep from the oily mire.  Pausing at  one time to look about him he saw, out at some black water, a small  animal pounce in and emerge directly with a gleaming fish.    The youth went again into the deep thickets.  The brushed branches made  a noise that drowned the sounds of cannon.  He walked on, going from  obscurity into promises of a greater obscurity.    At length he reached a place where the high, arching boughs made a  chapel.  He softly pushed the green doors aside and entered.  Pine  needles were a gentle brown carpet.  There was a religious half light.    Near the threshold he stopped, horror-stricken at the sight of a thing.    He was being looked at by a dead man who was seated with his back  against a columnlike tree.  The corpse was dressed in a uniform that  had once been blue, but was now faded to a melancholy shade of green.  The eyes, staring at the youth, had changed to the dull hue to be seen  on the side of a dead fish.  The mouth was open.  Its red had changed  to an appalling yellow.  Over the gray skin of the face ran little  ants.  One was trundling some sort of bundle along the upper lip.    The youth gave a shriek as he confronted the thing.  He was for moments  turned to stone before it.  He remained staring into the liquid-looking  eyes.  The dead man and the living man exchanged a long look.  Then the  youth cautiously put one hand behind him and brought it against a tree.  Leaning upon this he retreated, step by step, with his face still  toward the thing.  He feared that if he turned his back the body might  spring up and stealthily pursue him.    The branches, pushing against him, threatened to throw him over upon  it.  His unguided feet, too, caught aggravatingly in brambles; and with  it all he received a subtle suggestion to touch the corpse.  As he  thought of his hand upon it he shuddered profoundly.    At last he burst the bonds which had fastened him to the spot and fled,  unheeding the underbrush.  He was pursued by the sight of black ants  swarming greedily upon the gray face and venturing horribly near to the  eyes.    After a time he paused, and, breathless and panting, listened.  He  imagined some strange voice would come from the dead throat and squawk  after him in horrible menaces.    The trees about the portal of the chapel moved soughingly in a soft  wind.  A sad silence was upon the little guarding edifice.          Chapter 8      The trees began softly to sing a hymn of twilight.  The sun sank until  slanted bronze rays struck the forest.  There was a lull in the noises  of insects as if they had bowed their beaks and were making a  devotional pause.  There was silence save for the chanted chorus of the  trees.    Then, upon this stillness, there suddenly broke a tremendous clangor of  sounds.  A crimson roar came from the distance.    The youth stopped.  He was transfixed by this terrific medley of all  noises.  It was as if worlds were being rended.  There was the ripping  sound of musketry and the breaking crash of the artillery.    His mind flew in all directions.  He conceived the two armies to be at  each other panther fashion.  He listened for a time.  Then he began to  run in the direction of the battle.  He saw that it was an ironical  thing for him to be running thus toward that which he had been at such  pains to avoid.  But he said, in substance, to himself that if the  earth and the moon were about to clash, many persons would doubtless  plan to get upon the roofs to witness the collision.    As he ran, he became aware that the forest had stopped its music, as if  at last becoming capable of hearing the foreign sounds.  The trees  hushed and stood motionless.  Everything seemed to be listening to the  crackle and clatter and earthshaking thunder.  The chorus peaked over  the still earth.    It suddenly occurred to the youth that the fight in which he had been  was, after all, but perfunctory popping.  In the hearing of this  present din he was doubtful if he had seen real battle scenes.  This  uproar explained a celestial battle; it was tumbling hordes a-struggle  in the air.    Reflecting, he saw a sort of a humor in the point of view of himself  and his fellows during the late encounter.  They had taken themselves  and the enemy very seriously and had imagined that they were deciding  the war.  Individuals must have supposed that they were cutting the  letters of their names deep into everlasting tablets of brass, or  enshrining their reputations forever in the hearts of their countrymen,  while, as to fact, the affair would appear in printed reports under a  meek and immaterial title.  But he saw that it was good, else, he said,  in battle every one would surely run save forlorn hopes and their ilk.    He went rapidly on.  He wished to come to the edge of the forest that  he might peer out.    As he hastened, there passed through his mind pictures of stupendous  conflicts.  His accumulated thought upon such subjects was used to form  scenes.  The noise was as the voice of an eloquent being, describing.    Sometimes the brambles formed chains and tried to hold him back.  Trees, confronting him, stretched out their arms and forbade him to  pass.  After its previous hostility this new resistance of the forest  filled him with a fine bitterness.  It seemed that Nature could not be  quite ready to kill him.    But he obstinately took roundabout ways, and presently he was where he  could see long gray walls of vapor where lay battle lines.  The voices  of cannon shook him.  The musketry sounded in long irregular surges  that played havoc with his ears.  He stood regardant for a moment.  His  eyes had an awestruck expression.  He gawked in the direction of the  fight.    Presently he proceeded again on his forward way.  The battle was like  the grinding of an immense and terrible machine to him.  Its  complexities and powers, its grim processes, fascinated him.  He must  go close and see it produce corpses.    He came to a fence and clambered over it.  On the far side, the ground  was littered with clothes and guns.  A newspaper, folded up, lay in the  dirt.  A dead soldier was stretched with his face hidden in his arm.  Farther off there was a group of four or five corpses keeping mournful  company.  A hot sun had blazed upon this spot.    In this place the youth felt that he was an invader.  This forgotten  part of the battle ground was owned by the dead men, and he hurried, in  the vague apprehension that one of the swollen forms would rise and  tell him to begone.    He came finally to a road from which he could see in the distance dark  and agitated bodies of troops, smoke-fringed.  In the lane was a  blood-stained crowd streaming to the rear.  The wounded men were  cursing, groaning, and wailing.  In the air, always, was a mighty swell  of sound that it seemed could sway the earth.  With the courageous  words of the artillery and the spiteful sentences of the musketry  mingled red cheers.  And from this region of noises came the steady  current of the maimed.    One of the wounded men had a shoeful of blood.  He hopped like a  schoolboy in a game.  He was laughing hysterically.    One was swearing that he had been shot in the arm through the  commanding general's mismanagement of the army.  One was marching with  an air imitative of some sublime drum major.  Upon his features was an  unholy mixture of merriment and agony.  As he marched he sang a bit of  doggerel in a high and quavering voice:        \"Sing a song 'a vic'try,    A pocketful 'a bullets,    Five an' twenty dead men    Baked in a--pie.\"    Parts "]]]
