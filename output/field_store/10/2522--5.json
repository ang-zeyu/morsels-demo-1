Getting up at four o'clock of a March morning to kindle fires and  attend to the animals was not the most delectable duty that our  labor-despising young recruit could have chosen; but if he repented of  the venture he had made nobody was the wiser. Sleeping of stormy nights  in corn-cribs or under sheds, could not be by any stretch of imagination  converted into a highly romantic or heroic mode of lodging one's self.  The squalid manner of living of the few inhabitants of Missouri at this  period, gave a forlorn aspect to the country which is lacking in the  wilderness itself;--a thought which sometimes occurred to Joe like a  hope for the future. Mountain-fare he began to think must be better than  the boiled corn and pork of the Missourians. Antelope and buffalo meat  were more suitable viands for a hunter than coon and opossum. Thus those  very duties which seemed undignified, and those hardships without danger  or glory, which marked the beginning of his career made him ambitious of  a more free and hazardous life on the plains and in the mountains.    Among the recruits was a young man not far from Joe's own age, named  Robert Newell, from Ohio. One morning, when the company was encamped  near Boonville, the two young men were out looking for their mules, when  they encountered an elderly woman returning from the milking yard with a  gourd of milk. Newell made some remark on the style of vessel she  carried, when she broke out in a sharp voice,--    \"Young chap, I'll bet you run off from your mother! Who'll mend them  holes in the elbow of your coat? You're a purty looking chap to go to  the mountains, among them Injuns! They'll _kill_ you. You'd better go  back home!\"    Considering that these frontier people knew what Indian fighting was,  this was no doubt sound and disinterested advice, notwithstanding it  was given somewhat sharply. And so the young men felt it to be; but it  was not in the nature of either of them to turn back from a course  because there was danger in it. The thought of home, and somebody to  mend their coats, was, however, for the time strongly presented. But the  company moved on, with undiminished numbers, stared at by the few  inhabitants, and having their own little adventures, until they came to  Independence, the last station before committing themselves to the  wilderness.    At this place, which contained a dwelling-house, cotton-gin, and  grocery, the camp tarried for a few days to adjust the packs, and  prepare for a final start across the plains. On Sunday the settlers got  together for a shooting-match, in which some of the travelers joined,  without winning many laurels. Coon-skins, deer-skins, and bees-wax  changed hands freely among the settlers, whose skill with the rifle was  greater than their hoard of silver dollars. This was the last vestige of  civilization which the company could hope to behold for years; and rude  as it was, yet won from them many a parting look as they finally took  their way across the plains toward the Arkansas River.    Often on this part of the march a dead silence fell upon the party,  which remained unbroken for miles of the way. Many no doubt were  regretting homes by them abandoned, or wondering dreamily how many and  whom of that company would ever see the Missouri country again. Many  indeed went the way the woman of the gourd had prophesied; but not the  hero of this story, nor his comrade Newell.    The route of Captain Sublette led across the country from near the mouth  of the Kansas River to the River Arkansas; thence to the South Fork of  the Platte; thence on to the North Fork of that River, to where Ft.  Laramie now stands; thence up the North Fork to the Sweetwater, and  thence across in a still northwesterly direction to the head of Wind  River.    The manner of camp-travel is now so well known through the writings of  Irving, and still more from the great numbers which have crossed the  plains since _Astoria_ and _Bonneville_ were written, that it would be  superfluous here to enter upon a particular description of a train on  that journey. A strict half-military discipline had to be maintained,  regular duties assigned to each person, precautions taken against the  loss of animals either by straying or Indian stampeding, etc. Some of  the men were appointed as camp-keepers, who had all these things to look  after, besides standing guard. A few were selected as hunters, and these  were free to come and go, as their calling required. None but the most  experienced were chosen for hunters, on a march; therefore our recruit  could not aspire to that dignity yet.    The first adventure the company met with worthy of mention after leaving  Independence, was in crossing the country between the Arkansas and the  Platte. Here the camp was surprised one morning by a band of Indians a  thousand strong, that came sweeping down upon them in such warlike style  that even Captain Sublette was fain to believe it his last battle. Upon  the open prairie there is no such thing as flight, nor any cover under  which to conceal a party even for a few moments. It is always fight or  die, if the assailants are in the humor for war.    Happily on this occasion the band proved to be more peaceably disposed  than their appearance indicated, being the warriors of several  tribes--the Sioux, Arapahoes, Kiowas, and Cheyennes, who had been  holding a council to consider probably what mischief they could do to  some other tribes. The spectacle they presented as they came at full  speed on horseback, armed, painted, brandishing their weapons, and  yelling in first-rate Indian style, was one which might well strike with  a palsy the stoutest heart and arm. What were a band of sixty men  against a thousand armed warriors in full fighting trim, with spears,  shields, bows, battle-axes, and not a few guns?    But it is the rule of the mountain-men to _fight_--and that there is a  chance for life until the breath is out of the body; therefore Captain  Sublette had his little force drawn up in line of battle. On came the  savages, whooping and swinging their weapons above their heads. Sublette  turned to his men. \"When you hear my shot, then fire.\" Still they came  on, until within about fifty paces of the line of waiting men. Sublette  turned his head, and saw his command with their guns all up to their  faces ready to fire, then raised his own gun. Just at this moment the  principal chief sprang off his horse and laid his weapon on the ground,  making signs of peace. Then followed a talk, and after the giving of a  considerable present, Sublette was allowed to depart. This he did with  all dispatch, the company putting as much distance as possible between  themselves and their visitors before making their next camp. Considering  the warlike character of these tribes and their superior numbers, it was  as narrow an escape on the part of the company as it was an exceptional  freak of generosity on the part of the savages to allow it. But Indians  have all a great respect for a man who shows no fear; and it was most  probably the warlike movement of Captain Sublette and his party which  inspired a willingness on the part of the chief to accept a present,  when he had the power to have taken the whole train. Besides, according  to Indian logic, the present cost him nothing, and it might cost him  many warriors to capture the train. Had there been the least wavering  on Sublette's part, or fear in the countenances of his men, the end of  the affair would have been different. This adventure was a grand  initiation of the raw recruits, giving them both an insight into savage  modes of attack, and an opportunity to test their own nerve.    The company proceeded without accident, and arrived, about the first of  July, at the rendezvous, which was appointed for this year on the Popo  Agie, one of the streams which form the head-waters of Bighorn River.    Now, indeed, young Joe had an opportunity of seeing something of the  life upon which he had entered. As customary, when the traveling partner  arrived at rendezvous with the year's merchandise, there was a meeting  of all the partners, if they were within reach of the appointed place.  On this occasion Smith was absent on his tour through California and  Western Oregon, as has been related in the prefatory chapter. Jackson,  the resident partner, and commander for the previous year, was not yet  in; and Sublette had just arrived with the goods from St. Louis.    All the different hunting and trapping parties and Indian allies were  gathered together, so that the camp contained several hundred men, with  their riding and pack-horses. Nor were Indian women and children wanting  to give variety and an appearance of domesticity to the scene.    [Illustration: _THE SUMMER RENDEZVOUS._]    The Summer rendezvous was always chosen in some valley where there was  grass for the animals, and game for the camp. The plains along the Popo  Agie, besides furnishing these necessary bounties, were bordered by  picturesque mountain ranges, whose naked bluffs of red sandstone glowed  in the morning and evening sun with a mellowness of coloring charming to  the eye of the Virginia recruit. The waving grass of the plain,  variegated with wild flowers; the clear summer heavens flecked with  white clouds that threw soft shadows in passing; the grazing animals  scattered about the meadows; the lodges of the _Booshways_,[A] around  which clustered the camp in motley garb and brilliant coloring; gay  laughter, and the murmur of soft Indian voices, all made up a most  spirited and enchanting picture, in which the eye of an artist could not  fail to delight.

Its total length is nine inches and a quarter; the bill is nine lines from  the gape to the tip, and four from the base of the nostrils, at which part  the bill is not so proportionably broad as in the Swallow Berryeater (pl.  21.): the colour blueish-black, paler at the base: the whole head, sides,  chin, and part of the throat are black, the feathers of the crown a little  lengthened and pointed, giving a slight appearance of a crest: the wings  and tail are dusky-black on the inner shafts and green on the outer; the  whole of the upper plumage olive-green, and of the under pale  greenish-yellow crossed with short dusky transverse lines from the breast  downwards; under wing and tail-covers the same. Tail four inches from the  base, slightly divaricated, and of twelve feathers. Wings four inches and a  half, the first quill very short, the third, fourth and fifth of equal  length. Legs black.

Zool._ viii.      1. 105.           *       *       *       *       *    The Kingsfishers have such a general similarity of form, that the most  casual observer is able to distinguish them: a very long straight bill,  short wings, and (in general) a shorter tail with very small legs, are the  prominent distinctions of such as are usually seen; and the richness of  plumage that generally pervades them cannot be better exemplified than in  our own beautiful species, the common Kingsfisher, not unfrequent in many  parts of England.    These birds, hitherto placed in systems under one genus, nevertheless  contain two distinct groups differing materially in the construction of  that primary organ of supporting life, the bill; and in their physical  distribution, or the countries they respectively inhabit, two most  important considerations in the natural arrangement of animals under the  present elevated views of the philosophic zoologist, with whom the study of  Nature consists no longer in the study of words, the retention of names, or  even the accurate description of species.    These considerations have induced me to form these birds into two genera,  the definitions of which are now given: those retained under the old genus  of _Alcedo_ appear to be scattered (though sparingly) in every part of the  old and the new world. Their bills seem formed for swallowing their food  more in an entire state, similar to the Herons. In each of these genera one  species exists with only three toes, a remarkable circumstance, which in an  artificial system would endanger their being united in a separate genus;  but which, from the remarkable smallness of the inner toe in all the other  species, cannot I apprehend point out any peculiarity either in their habit  or economy: and this opinion I find is likewise entertained by Professor  Temminck.    Total length seven inches and a quarter. Bill from the gape two inches one  line, the upper mandible rather longest, and both with a slight appearance  of a notch; the colour black. All the upper plumage, as well as the sides  of the head, ears, and stripe beyond, fine ultramarine blue, more vivid on  the rump and tail-covers, and duller on the tail, wing-covers, and lesser  quill-margins; front blackish; from the nostrils to the eye a whitish line,  and from the ears on each side the neck a whitish stripe, which almost  forms a collar round the nape. Quill-feathers sooty black. All the under  parts orange ferrugineous; throat and belly nearly white. Tail very short,  nearly hid by the upper covers. Feet red, claws black. The inner fore-toe  wanting, but a slight rudiment of it exists in my specimen.    Since writing the above, I find this bird is figured and described in a  beautiful work commenced by Lewin on the birds of New Holland, which Mr.  Brown, the learned possessor of the Banksian library, pointed out to me. I  believe but a few copies are known. Lewin observes, \"it inhabits heads of  rivers, visiting dead trees, from the branches of which it darts on its  prey in the water beneath, and is sometimes completely immersed by the  velocity of its descent.\"    Dr. Latham has very well described it, but quite overlooked the  construction of the feet.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 27    [Illustration]    HALCYON collaris.    _Collared Crabeater._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Rostrum longissimum, rectum, validum, ad basin latius quam altius,      lateribus tetragonis; mandibula superiore rectissima, ad basin      rotundata; inferiore carinata, recurvata, margine superioris inferiorem      obtegente.
