One would think that they  preferred india-rubber children, which could neither be sick nor die,  and could always be repaired. What an entanglement in the brains of  these poor women! Why such abominations to avoid pregnancy, and to avoid  the love of the little ones?    \"Love, the most joyous condition of the soul, is represented as a  danger. And why? Because, when a man does not live as a man, he is  worse than a beast. A woman cannot look upon a child otherwise than as  a pleasure. It is true that it is painful to give birth to it, but what  little hands! . . . Oh, the little hands! Oh, the little feet! Oh, its  smile! Oh, its little body! Oh, its prattle! Oh, its hiccough! In a  word, it is a feeling of animal, sensual maternity. But as for any idea  as to the mysterious significance of the appearance of a new human being  to replace us, there is scarcely a sign of it.    \"Nothing of it appears in all that is said and done. No one has any  faith now in a baptism of the child, and yet that was nothing but a  reminder of the human significance of the newborn babe.    \"They have rejected all that, but they have not replaced it, and there  remain only the dresses, the laces, the little hands, the little  feet, and whatever exists in the animal. But the animal has neither  imagination, nor foresight, nor reason, nor a doctor.    \"No! not even a doctor! The chicken droops its head, overwhelmed, or the  calf dies; the hen clucks and the cow lows for a time, and then these  beasts continue to live, forgetting what has happened.    \"With us, if the child falls sick, what is to be done, how to care for  it, what doctor to call, where to go? If it dies, there will be no more  little hands or little feet, and then what is the use of the sufferings  endured? The cow does not ask all that, and this is why children are a  source of misery. The cow has no imagination, and for that reason cannot  think how it might have saved the child if it had done this or that, and  its grief, founded in its physical being, lasts but a very short time.  It is only a condition, and not that sorrow which becomes exaggerated  to the point of despair, thanks to idleness and satiety. The cow has not  that reasoning faculty which would enable it to ask the why. Why endure  all these tortures? What was the use of so much love, if the little  ones were to die? The cow has no logic which tells it to have no more  children, and, if any come accidentally, to neither love nor nurse them,  that it may not suffer. But our wives reason, and reason in this way,  and that is why I said that, when a man does not live as a man, he is  beneath the animal.\"    \"But then, how is it necessary to act, in your opinion, in order to  treat children humanly?\" I asked.    \"How? Why, love them humanly.\"    \"Well, do not mothers love their children?\"    \"They do not love them humanly, or very seldom do, and that is why they  do not love them even as dogs. Mark this, a hen, a goose, a wolf, will  always remain to woman inaccessible ideals of animal love. It is a rare  thing for a woman to throw herself, at the peril of her life, upon an  elephant to snatch her child away, whereas a hen or a sparrow will not  fail to fly at a dog and sacrifice itself utterly for its children.  Observe this, also. Woman has the power to limit her physical love for  her children, which an animal cannot do. Does that mean that, because of  this, woman is inferior to the animal? No. She is superior (and even to  say superior is unjust, she is not superior, she is different), but she  has other duties, human duties. She can restrain herself in the matter  of animal love, and transfer her love to the soul of the child. That is  what woman's role should be, and that is precisely what we do not see in  our society. We read of the heroic acts of mothers who sacrifice their  children in the name of a superior idea, and these things seem to us  like tales of the ancient world, which do not concern us. And yet I  believe that, if the mother has not some ideal, in the name of which she  can sacrifice the animal feeling, and if this force finds no employment,  she will transfer it to chimerical attempts to physically preserve her  child, aided in this task by the doctor, and she will suffer as she does  suffer.    \"So it was with my wife. Whether there was one child or five, the  feeling remained the same. In fact, it was a little better when there  had been five. Life was always poisoned with fear for the children, not  only from their real or imaginary diseases, but even by their simple  presence. For my part, at least, throughout my conjugal life, all my  interests and all my happiness depended upon the health of my children,  their condition, their studies. Children, it is needless to say, are a  serious consideration; but all ought to live, and in our days parents  can no longer live. Regular life does not exist for them. The whole life  of the family hangs by a hair. What a terrible thing it is to suddenly  receive the news that little Basile is vomiting, or that Lise has a  cramp in the stomach! Immediately you abandon everything, you forget  everything, everything becomes nothing. The essential thing is the  doctor, the enema, the temperature. You cannot begin a conversation but  little Pierre comes running in with an anxious air to ask if he may eat  an apple, or what jacket he shall put on, or else it is the servant who  enters with a screaming baby.    \"Regular, steady family life does not exist. Where you live, and  consequently what you do, depends upon the health of the little ones,  the health of the little ones depends upon nobody, and, thanks to the  doctors, who pretend to aid health, your entire life is disturbed. It is  a perpetual peril. Scarcely do we believe ourselves out of it when a new  danger comes: more attempts to save. Always the situation of sailors  on a foundering vessel. Sometimes it seemed to me that this was done on  purpose, that my wife feigned anxiety in order to conquer me, since that  solved the question so simply for her benefit. It seemed to me that all  that she did at those times was done for its effect upon me, but now I  see that she herself, my wife, suffered and was tortured on account of  the little ones, their health, and their diseases.    \"A torture to both of us, but to her the children were also a means of  forgetting herself, like an intoxication. I often noticed, when she was  very sad, that she was relieved, when a child fell sick, at being able  to take refuge in this intoxication. It was involuntary intoxication,  because as yet there was nothing else. On every side we heard that Mrs.  So-and-so had lost children, that Dr. So-and-so had saved the child  of Mrs. So-and-so, and that in a certain family all had moved from the  house in which they were living, and thereby saved the little ones. And  the doctors, with a serious air, confirmed this, sustaining my wife in  her opinions. She was not prone to fear, but the doctor dropped some  word, like corruption of the blood, scarlatina, or else--heaven help  us--diphtheria, and off she went.    \"It was impossible for it to be otherwise. Women in the old days had the  belief that 'God has given, God has taken away,' that the soul of the  little angel is going to heaven, and that it is better to die innocent  than to die in sin. If the women of to-day had something like this  faith, they could endure more peacefully the sickness of their children.  But of all that there does not remain even a trace. And yet it is  necessary to believe in something; consequently they stupidly believe in  medicine, and not even in medicine, but in the doctor. One believes in  X, another in Z, and, like all believers, they do not see the idiocy of  their beliefs. They believe quia absurdum, because, in reality, if they  did not believe in a stupid way, they would see the vanity of all that  these brigands prescribe for them. Scarlatina is a contagious disease;  so, when one lives in a large city, half the family has to move away  from its residence (we did it twice), and yet every man in the city is a  centre through which pass innumerable diameters, carrying threads of all  sorts of contagions. There is no obstacle: the baker, the tailor, the  coachman, the laundresses.    \"And I would undertake, for every man who moves on account of contagion,  to find in his new dwelling-place another contagion similar, if not the  same.    \"But that is not all. Every one knows rich people who, after a case of  diphtheria, destroy everything in their residences, and then fall sick  in houses newly built and furnished. Every one knows, likewise, numbers  of men who come in contact with sick people and do not get infected. Our  anxieties are due to the people who circulate tall stories. One woman  says that she has an excellent doctor. 'Pardon me,' answers the other,  'he killed such a one,' or such a one. And vice versa. Bring her  another, who knows no more, who learned from the same books, who treats  according to the same formulas, but who goes about in a carriage, and  asks a hundred roubles a visit, and she will have faith in him.    \"It all lies in the fact that our women are savages. They have no belief  in God, but some of them believe in the evil eye, and the others in  doctors who charge high fees. If they had faith they would know that  scarlatina, diphtheria, etc., are not so terrible, since they cannot  disturb that which man can and should love,--the soul. There can result  from them only that which none of us can avoid,--disease and death.  Without faith in God, they love only physically, and all their energy is  concentrated upon the preservation of life, which cannot be preserved,  and which the doctors promise the fools of both sexes to save. And from  that time there is nothing to be done; the doctors must be summoned.    \"Thus the presence of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/690"],[0,"Proposed Roads to Freedom (#10)"],[1,"y, but these  are to spring from universal consent, not from any  enforced submission of even the smallest minority.  We shall examine in a later chapter how far such  an ideal is realizable, but it cannot be denied that  Kropotkin presents it with extraordinary persuasiveness  and charm.    We should be doing more than justice to Anarchism  if we did not say something of its darker side,  the side which has brought it into conflict with the  police and made it a word of terror to ordinary citizens.  In its general doctrines there is nothing essentially  involving violent methods or a virulent hatred  of the rich, and many who adopt these general doctrines  are personally gentle and temperamentally  averse from violence. But the general tone of the  Anarchist press and public is bitter to a degree that  seems scarcely sane, and the appeal, especially in  Latin countries, is rather to envy of the fortunate  than to pity for the unfortunate. A vivid and readable,  though not wholly reliable, account, from a  hostile point of view, is given in a book called ``Le  Peril Anarchiste,'' by Felix Dubois,[17] which  incidentally reproduces a number of cartoons from anarchist  journals. The revolt against law naturally leads,  except in those who are controlled by a real passion  for humanity, to a relaxation of all the usually  accepted moral rules, and to a bitter spirit of  retaliatory cruelty out of which good can hardly come.      [17] Paris, 1894.      One of the most curious features of popular  Anarchism is its martyrology, aping Christian forms,  with the guillotine (in France) in place of the cross.  Many who have suffered death at the hands of the  authorities on account of acts of violence were no  doubt genuine sufferers for their belief in a cause,  but others, equally honored, are more questionable.  One of the most curious examples of this outlet for  the repressed religious impulse is the cult of Ravachol,  who was guillotined in 1892 on account of  various dynamite outrages. His past was dubious,  but he died defiantly; his last words were three lines  from a well-known Anarchist song, the ``Chant du  Pere Duchesne'':--              Si tu veux etre heureux,                 Nom de Dieu!            Pends ton proprietaire.    As was natural, the leading Anarchists took no part  in the canonization of his memory; nevertheless it  proceeded, with the most amazing extravagances.    It would be wholly unfair to judge Anarchist  doctrine, or the views of its leading exponents, by  such phenomena; but it remains a fact that Anarchism  attracts to itself much that lies on the borderland  of insanity and common crime.[18] This must be  remembered in exculpation of the authorities and  the thoughtless public, who often confound in a common  detestation the parasites of the movement and  the truly heroic and high-minded men who have elaborated  its theories and sacrificed comfort and success  to their propagation.      [18] The attitude of all the better Anarchists is that expressed  by L. S. Bevington in the words: ``Of course we know that  among those who call themselves Anarchists there are a minority  of unbalanced enthusiasts who look upon every illegal and sensational  act of violence as a matter for hysterical jubilation.  Very useful to the police and the press, unsteady in intellect  and of weak moral principle, they have repeatedly shown themselves  accessible to venal considerations. They, and their violence,  and their professed Anarchism are purchasable, and in  the last resort they are welcome and efficient partisans of the  bourgeoisie in its remorseless war against the deliverers of the  people.'' His conclusion is a very wise one: ``Let us leave  indiscriminate killing and injuring to the Government--to its  Statesmen, its Stockbrokers, its Officers, and its Law.'' (``Anarchism  and Violence,'' pp. 9-10.  Liberty Press, Chiswick, 1896.)      The terrorist campaign in which such men as  Ravachol were active practically came to an end in  1894. After that time, under the influence of Pelloutier,  the better sort of Anarchists found a less  harmful outlet by advocating Revolutionary Syndicalism  in the Trade Unions and Bourses du Travail.[19]      [19] See next Chapter.      The ECONOMIC organization of society, as conceived  by Anarchist Communists, does not differ  greatly from that which is sought by Socialists.  Their difference from Socialists is in the matter of  government: they demand that government shall  require the consent of all the governed, and not only  of a majority. It is undeniable that the rule of a  majority may be almost as hostile to freedom as the  rule of a minority: the divine right of majorities is a  dogma as little possessed of absolute truth as any  other. A strong democratic State may easily be led  into oppression of its best citizens, namely, those  those independence of mind would make them a force  for progress. Experience of democratic parliamentary  government has shown that it falls very far  short of what was expected of it by early Socialists,  and the Anarchist revolt against it is not surprising.  But in the form of pure Anarchism, this revolt has  remained weak and sporadic. It is Syndicalism, and  the movements to which Syndicalism has given rise,  that have popularized the revolt against parliamentary  government and purely political means of emancipating  the wage earner. But this movement must  be dealt with in a separate chapter.        CHAPTER III    THE SYNDICALIST REVOLT      SYNDICALISM arose in France as a revolt against  political Socialism, and in order to understand it  we must trace in brief outline the positions attained  by Socialist parties in the various countries.    After a severe setback, caused by the Franco-  Prussian war, Socialism gradually revived, and in all  the countries of Western Europe Socialist parties  have increased their numerical strength almost  continuously during the last forty years; but, as is  invariably the case with a growing sect, the intensity  of faith has diminished as the number of believers  has increased.    In Germany the Socialist party became the  strongest faction of the Reichstag, and, in spite of  differences of opinion among its members, it preserved  its formal unity with that instinct for military  discipline which characterizes the German nation.  In the Reichstag election of 1912 it polled a third  of the total number of votes cast, and returned 110  members out of a total of 397. After the death of  Bebel, the Revisionists, who received their first  impulse from Bernstein, overcame the more strict  Marxians, and the party became in effect merely one  of advanced Radicalism. It is too soon to guess what  will be the effect of the split between Majority and  Minority Socialists which has occurred during the  war. There is in Germany hardly a trace of Syndicalism;  its characteristic doctrine, the preference of  industrial to political action, has found scarcely  any support.    In England Marx has never had many followers.  Socialism there has been inspired in the main by the  Fabians (founded in 1883), who threw over the  advocacy of revolution, the Marxian doctrine of  value, and the class-war. What remained was State  Socialism and a doctrine of ``permeation.'' Civil  servants were to be permeated with the realization  that Socialism would enormously increase their  power. Trade Unions were to be permeated with the  belief that the day for purely industrial action was  past, and that they must look to government (inspired  secretly by sympathetic civil servants) to bring  about, bit by bit, such parts of the Socialist program  as were not likely to rouse much hostility in the rich.  The Independent Labor Party (formed in 1893) was  largely inspired at first by the ideas of the Fabians,  though retaining to the present day, and especially  since the outbreak of the war, much more of the  original Socialist ardor. It aimed always at  co-operation with the industrial organizations of  wage-earners, and, chiefly through its efforts, the  Labor Party[20] was formed in 1900 out of a  combination of the Trade Unions and the political  Socialists. To this party, since 1909, all the important  Unions have belonged, but in spite of the fact  that its strength is derived from Trade Unions, it  has stood always for political rather than industrial  action. Its Socialism has been of a theoretical and  academic order, and in practice, until the outbreak  of war, the Labor members in Parliament (of whom  30 were elected in 1906 and 42 in December, 1910)  might be reckoned almost as a part of the Liberal  Party.      [20] Of which the Independent Labor Party is only a section.      France, unlike England and Germany, was not  content merely to repeat the old shibboleths with  continually diminishing conviction. In France[21] a new  movement, originally known as Revolutionary  Syndicalism--and afterward simply as Syndicalism--  kept alive the vigor of the original impulse, and  remained true to the spirit of the older Socialists,  while departing from the letter. Syndicalism, unlike  Socialism and Anarchism, began from an existing  organization and developed the ideas appropriate  to it, whereas Socialism and Anarchism began with  the ideas and only afterward developed the organizations  which were their vehicle. In order to understand  Syndicalism, we have first to describe Trade  Union organization in France, and its political  environment. The ideas of Syndicalism will then  appear as the natural outcome of the political and  economic situation. Hardly any of these ideas are  new; almost all are derived from the Bakunist section  of the old International.[21] The old International  had considerable success in France before the Franco-  Prussian War; indeed, in 1869, it is estimated to  have had a French membership of a quarter of a million.
