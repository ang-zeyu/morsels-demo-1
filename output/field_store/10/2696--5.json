This is the finest of all gingerbread, but should not be kept  long, as in a few days it becomes very hard and stale.      A DOVER CAKE.      Half a pint of milk.    A half tea-spoonful of pearl-ash, dissolved in a little vinegar.    One pound of sifted flour.    One pound of powdered white sugar.    Half a pound of butter.    Six eggs.    One glass of brandy.    Half a glass of rose-water.    One grated nutmeg.    A tea-spoonful of powdered cinnamon.    Dissolve the pearl-ash in vinegar. Stir the sugar and butter to a  cream, and add to it gradually, the spice and liquor. Beat the  eggs very light, and stir them into the butter and sugar,  alternately, with the flour. Add, gradually, the milk, and stir  the whole very hard.    Butter a large tin pan, and put in the mixture. Bake it two hours  or more, in a moderate oven. If not thick, an hour or an hour and  a half will be sufficient.    Wrap it in a thick cloth, and keep it from the air, and it will  continue moist and fresh for two weeks. The pearl-ash will give it  a dark colour.    It will be much improved by a pound of raisins, stoned and cut in  half, and a pound of currants, well washed and dried.    Flour the fruit well, and stir it in at the last.      CRULLERS.      Half a pound of butter.    Three quarters of a pound of powdered white sugar.    Six eggs, or seven if they are small.    Two pounds of flour, sifted.    A grated nutmeg.    A tea-spoonful of powdered cinnamon.    A table-spoonful of rose-water.    Cut the butter into the flour, add the sugar and spice, and mix  them well together.    Beat the eggs and pour them into the pan of flour, &c. Add the  rose water, and mix the whole into a dough. If the eggs and  rose-water are not found sufficient to wet it, add a very little  cold water. Mix the dough very well with a knife.    Spread some flour on your paste-board, take the dough out of the  pan, and knead it very well. Cut it into small pieces, and knead  each separately. Put all the pieces together, and knead the whole  in one lump. Roll it out into a large square sheet, about half an  inch thick. Take a jagging-iron, or, If you have not one, a sharp  knife; run it along the sheet, and cut the dough into long narrow  slips. Twist them up in various forms. Have ready an iron pan with  melted lard. Lay the crullers lightly in it, and fry them of a  light brown, turning them with a knife and fork, so as not to  break them, and taking care that both sides are equally done.    When sufficiently fried, spread them on a large dish to cool, and  grate loaf-sugar over them.    Crullers may be made in a plainer way, with the best brown sugar,  (rolled very fine.) and without spice or rose-water.    They can be fried, or rather boiled, in a deep iron pot. They  should be done in a large quantity of lard, and taken out with a  skimmer that has holes in it, and held on the skimmer till the  lard drains from them. If for family use, they can be made an inch  thick.      DOUGH-NUTS.      Three pounds of sifted flour.    A pound of powdered sugar.    Three quarters of a pound of butter.    Four eggs.    Half a large tea-cup full of best brewer's yeast.    A pint and a half of milk.    A tea-spoonful of powdered cinnamon.    A grated nutmeg.    A table-spoonful of rose-water.    Cut up the butter in the flour. Add the sugar, spice, and  rose-water. Beat the eggs very light, and pour them into the  mixture. Add the yeast, (half a tea-cup or two wine-glasses full,)  and then stir in the milk by degrees, so as to make it a soft  dough. Cover it, and set it to rise.    When quite light, cut it in diamonds with a jagging-iron or a  sharp knife, and fry them in lard. Grate loaf sugar over them when  done.      WAFFLES.      Six eggs.    A pint of milk.    A quarter of a pound of butter.    A quarter of a pound of powdered white sugar.    A pound and a half of flour, sifted.    A tea-spoonful of powdered cinnamon.    Warm the milk slightly. Cut up the butter in it and stir it a  little. Beat the eggs well, and pour them into the butter and  milk. Sprinkle in half the flour, gradually. Stir in the sugar, by  degrees, and add the spice. Stir in, gradually, the remainder of  the flour, so that it becomes a thick batter. Heat your waffle-iron;  then grease it well, and pour in some of the butter. Shut the  iron tight, and bake the waffle on both sides, by turning the iron.    As the waffles are baked, spread them out separately on a clean  napkin. When enough are done for a plate-full, lay them on a plate  in two piles, buttering them, and sprinkling each with beaten  cinnamon.      SOFT MUFFINS.      Five eggs.    A quart of milk.    Two ounces of butter.    A tea-spoonful of salt.    Two large table-spoonfuls of brewer's yeast or four made of      home-made yeast.    Enough of sifted flour to make a stiff batter.    Warm the milk and butter together, and add to them the salt. Beat  the eggs very light and stir them into the milk and butter. Then  stir in the yeast, and lastly, sufficient flour to make a thick  batter.    Cover the mixture, and set it to rise, in a warm place, about  three hours.    When it is quite light, grease your baking-iron, and your muffin  rings. Set the rings on the iron, and pour the batter into them.  Bake them a light brown. When you split them to put on the butter,  do not cut them with a knife, but pull them open With your hands.  Cutting them while hot will make them heavy.      INDIAN BATTER CAKES.      A quart of sifted indian meal.  \\    A handful of wheat flour sifted. }mixed.    Three eggs, well beaten.        /    Two table-spoonfuls of fresh brewer's yeast, or four of home-made      yeast.    A tea-spoonful of salt.    A quart of milk.    Make the milk quite warm, and then put into it the yeast and salt,  stirring them well. Beat the eggs, and stir them into the mixture.  Then, gradually stir in the flour and indian meal.    Cover the batter, and set it to rise four or five hours. Or if the  weather is cold, and you want the cakes for breakfast, you may mix  the batter late the night before.    Should you find it sour in the morning, dissolve a small  tea-spoonful of pearl-ash in as much water as will cover it, and  stir it into the batter, letting it set afterwards at least half  an hour. This will take off the acid.    Grease your baking-iron, and pour on it a ladle-full of the  batter. When brown on one side, turn the cake on the other.    [Footnote: Indian batter cakes may be made in a plain and  expeditious way, by putting three pints of cold water or cold milk  into a pan, and gradually sifting into it (stirring all the time)  a quart of indian meal mixed with half a pint of wheat-flour, and  a small spoonful of salt. Stir it very hard, and it may be baked  immediately, as it is not necessary to set it to rise.]      FLANNEL CAKES OR CRUMPETS.      Two pounds of flour, sifted.    Four eggs.    Three table-spoonfuls of the best brewer's yeast, or four and a      half of home-made yeast.    A pint of milk.    Mix a tea-spoonful of salt with the flour, and set the pan before  the fire. Then warm the milk, and stir into it the flour so as to  make a stiff batter. Beat the eggs very light, and stir them into  the yeast. Add the eggs and yeast to the batter, and beat all well  together. If it is too stiff, add a little more warm milk.    Cover the pan closely and set it to rise near the fire. Bake it,  when quite light.    Have your baking-iron hot. Grease it, and pour on a ladle-full of  batter. Let it bake slowly, and when done on one side, turn it on  the other.    Butter the cakes, cut them across, and send them to table hot.      ROLLS.      Three pints of flour, sifted.    Two tea-spoonfuls of salt.    Four table-spoonfuls of the best brewer's yeast, or six of      home-made yeast.    Half a pint more of warm water, and a little more flour to mix in      before the kneading.    Mix the salt with the flour, and make a deep hole in the middle.  Stir the warm water into the yeast, and pour it into the hole in  the flour. Stir it with a spoon just enough to make a thin batter,  and sprinkle some flour over the top. Cover the pan, and set it in  a warm place for several hours.    When it is light, add half a pint more of lukewarm water; and make  its with a little more flour, into a dough. Knead it very well for  ten minutes. Then divide it into small pieces, and knead each  separately. Make them into round cakes or rolls. Cover them, and  set them to rise about an hour and a half.    Bake them, and when done, let them remain in the oven, without the  lid, for about ten minutes.            PART THE THIRD    SWEETMEATS.      GENERAL DIRECTIONS.    In preparing sugar for sweetmeats, let it be entirely dissolved,  before you put it on the fire. If you dissolve it in water, allow  about half a pint of water to a pound of sugar.    If you boil the sugar before you add the fruit to it, it will be  improved in clearness by passing it through a flannel bag. Skim  off the brown scum, all the time it is boiling.    If sweetmeats are boiled too long, they lose their flavour and  become of a dark colour.    If boiled too short a time, they will not keep well.    You may ascertain when jelly is done, by dropping a small spoonful  into a glass of water.    If it spreads and mixes with the water, it requires more boiling.  If it sticks in a lump to the bottom, it is sufficiently done.  This trial must be made after the jelly is cold.    Raspberry jelly requires more boiling than any other sort. Black  currant jelly less.      APPLE JELLY.    Take the best pippin, or bell-flower apples. No others will make  good jelly. Pare, core, and quarter them. Lay them in a preserving  kettle, and put to them as much water only, as will cover them,  and as much lemon-peel as you choose. Boil them till they are  soft, but not till they break. Drain off the water through a  colander, and mash the apples with the hack of a spoon.

I want to find  my table.'    He surveyed the restaurant with a melancholy eye.    'Everything changed!' He spoke sadly, as Ulysses might have done  when his boat put in at Ithaca. 'Every darned thing different  since I was here last. New waiter, head-waiter I never saw before  in my life, different-coloured carpet--'    'Cheer up, Nutty, old thing!' said Miss Leonard. 'You'll feel  better when you've had something to eat. I hope you had the sense  to tip the head-waiter, or there won't be any table. Funny how  these places go up and down in New York. A year ago the whole  management would turn out and kiss you if you looked like spending  a couple of dollars here. Now it costs the earth to get in at  all.'    'Why's that?' asked Nutty.    'Lady Pauline Wetherby, of course. Didn't you know this was where  she danced?'    'Never heard of her,' said Nutty, in a sort of ecstasy of wistful  gloom. 'That will show you how long I've been away. Who is she?'    Miss Leonard invoked the name of Mike.    'Don't you ever get the papers in your village, Nutty?'    'I never read the papers. I don't suppose I've read a paper for  years. I can't stand 'em. Who is Lady Pauline Wetherby?'    'She does Greek dances--at least, I suppose they're Greek. They  all are nowadays, unless they're Russian. She's an English  peeress.'    Miss Leonard's friend said she was crazy about these picturesque  old English families; and they went in to supper.           *       *       *       *       *    Looking back on the evening later and reviewing its leading  features, Lord Dawlish came to the conclusion that he never  completely recovered from the first shock of the Good Sport. He  was conscious all the time of a dream-like feeling, as if he were  watching himself from somewhere outside himself. From some  conning-tower in this fourth dimension he perceived himself eating  broiled lobster and drinking champagne and heard himself bearing  an adequate part in the conversation; but his movements were  largely automatic.           *       *       *       *       *    Time passed. It seemed to Lord Dawlish, watching from without,  that things were livening up. He seemed to perceive a quickening  of the _tempo_ of the revels, an added abandon. Nutty was  getting quite bright. He had the air of one who recalls the good  old days, of one who in familiar scenes re-enacts the joys of his  vanished youth. The chastened melancholy induced by many months of  fetching of pails of water, of scrubbing floors with a mop, and of  jumping like a firecracker to avoid excited bees had been purged  from him by the lights and the music and the wine. He was telling  a long anecdote, laughing at it, throwing a crust of bread at an  adjacent waiter, and refilling his glass at the same time. It is  not easy to do all these things simultaneously, and the fact that  Nutty did them with notable success was proof that he was picking  up.    Miss Daisy Leonard was still demure, but as she had just slipped a  piece of ice down the back of Nutty's neck one may assume that she  was feeling at her ease and had overcome any diffidence or shyness  which might have interfered with her complete enjoyment of the  festivities. As for the Good Sport, she was larger, blonder, and  more exuberant than ever and she was addressing someone as 'Bill'.    Perhaps the most remarkable phenomenon of the evening, as it  advanced, was the change it wrought in Lord Dawlish's attitude  toward this same Good Sport. He was not conscious of the beginning  of the change; he awoke to the realization of it suddenly. At the  beginning of supper his views on her had been definite and clear.  When they had first been introduced to each other he had had a  stunned feeling that this sort of thing ought not to be allowed at  large, and his battered brain had instinctively recalled that line  of Tennyson: 'The curse is come upon me.' But now, warmed with  food and drink and smoking an excellent cigar, he found that a  gentler, more charitable mood had descended upon him.    He argued with himself in extenuation of the girl's peculiar  idiosyncrasies. Was it, he asked himself, altogether her fault  that she was so massive and spoke as if she were addressing an  open-air meeting in a strong gale? Perhaps it was hereditary.  Perhaps her father had been a circus giant and her mother the  strong woman of the troupe. And for the unrestraint of her manner  defective training in early girlhood would account. He began to  regard her with a quiet, kindly commiseration, which in its turn  changed into a sort of brotherly affection. He discovered that he  liked her. He liked her very much. She was so big and jolly and  robust, and spoke in such a clear, full voice. He was glad that  she was patting his hand. He was glad that he had asked her to  call him Bill.    People were dancing now. It has been claimed by patriots that  American dyspeptics lead the world. This supremacy, though partly  due, no doubt, to vast supplies of pie absorbed in youth, may be  attributed to a certain extent also to the national habit of  dancing during meals. Lord Dawlish had that sturdy reverence for  his interior organism which is the birthright of every Briton. And  at the beginning of supper he had resolved that nothing should  induce him to court disaster in this fashion. But as the time went  on he began to waver.    The situation was awkward. Nutty and Miss Leonard were repeatedly  leaving the table to tread the measure, and on these occasions the  Good Sport's wistfulness was a haunting reproach. Nor was the  spectacle of Nutty in action without its effect on Bill's  resolution. Nutty dancing was a sight to stir the most stolid.    Bill wavered. The music had started again now, one of those  twentieth-century eruptions of sound that begin like a train going  through a tunnel and continue like audible electric shocks, that  set the feet tapping beneath the table and the spine thrilling  with an unaccustomed exhilaration. Every drop of blood in his body  cried to him 'Dance!' He could resist no longer.    'Shall we?' he said.    Bill should not have danced. He was an estimable young man,  honest, amiable, with high ideals. He had played an excellent game  of football at the university; his golf handicap was plus two; and  he was no mean performer with the gloves. But we all of us have  our limitations, and Bill had his. He was not a good dancer. He  was energetic, but he required more elbow room than the ordinary  dancing floor provides. As a dancer, in fact, he closely resembled  a Newfoundland puppy trying to run across a field.    It takes a good deal to daunt the New York dancing man, but the  invasion of the floor by Bill and the Good Sport undoubtedly  caused a profound and even painful sensation. Linked together they  formed a living projectile which might well have intimidated the  bravest. Nutty was their first victim. They caught him in  mid-step--one of those fancy steps which he was just beginning to  exhume from the cobwebbed recesses of his memory--and swept him  away. After which they descended resistlessly upon a stout  gentleman of middle age, chiefly conspicuous for the glittering  diamonds which he wore and the stoical manner in which he danced  to and fro on one spot of not more than a few inches in size in  the exact centre of the room. He had apparently staked out a claim  to this small spot, a claim which the other dancers had decided to  respect; but Bill and the Good Sport, coming up from behind, had  him two yards away from it at the first impact. Then, scattering  apologies broadcast like a medieval monarch distributing largesse,  Bill whirled his partner round by sheer muscular force and began  what he intended to be a movement toward the farther corner,  skirting the edge of the floor. It was his simple belief that  there was more safety there than in the middle.    He had not reckoned with Heinrich Joerg. Indeed, he was not aware  of Heinrich Joerg's existence. Yet fate was shortly to bring them  together, with far-reaching results. Heinrich Joerg had left the  Fatherland a good many years before with the prudent purpose of  escaping military service. After various vicissitudes in the land  of his adoption--which it would be extremely interesting to  relate, but which must wait for a more favourable opportunity--he  had secured a useful and not ill-recompensed situation as one of  the staff of Reigelheimer's Restaurant. He was, in point of fact,  a waiter, and he comes into the story at this point bearing a tray  full of glasses, knives, forks, and pats of butter on little  plates. He was setting a table for some new arrivals, and in order  to obtain more scope for that task he had left the crowded aisle  beyond the table and come round to the edge of the dancing-floor.    He should not have come out on to the dancing-floor. In another  moment he was admitting that himself. For just as he was lowering  his tray and bending over the table in the pursuance of his  professional duties, along came Bill at his customary high rate  of speed, propelling his partner before him, and for the first  time since he left home Heinrich was conscious of a regret that he  had done so. There are worse things than military service!    It was the table that saved Bill. He clutched at it and it  supported him. He was thus enabled to keep the Good Sport from  falling and to assist Heinrich to rise from the morass of glasses,  knives, and pats of butter in which he was wallowing. Then, the  dance having been abandoned by mutual consent, he helped his now  somewhat hysterical partner back to their table.    Remorse came upon Bill. He was sorry that he had danced; sorry  that he had upset Heinrich; sorry that he had subjected the Good  Sport's nervous system to such a strain; sorry that so much glass  had been broken "]]]
