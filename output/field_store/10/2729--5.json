There is not a  single act of defence to which the voter was subjected by law when the  Constitution was framed, to which he is not subject now, and subject  because he is a voter. The vote is not given to him as a reward for  standing ready to give this service to the state; it is a recognition by  the state that, as he must stand ready to defend it, he should assist in  establishing the laws which it may call upon him to enforce. As he has  assisted to frame them, he cannot refuse to defend them. Woman's only  relation to this defence is that of beneficiary, and therefore her  relation to the laws with which that defence is associated must be one of  advice and not of control. Fortunately for her, advice may prove sometimes  to be control of the most satisfactory kind, a kind that admits of mental  power and does not exact physical.    The statement is further made by Suffragists that \"though woman needs  protection of one man against his whole sex, in pioneer life, in threading  her way through a lonely forest, on the highway, or in the streets of a  metropolis on a dark night, she sometimes needs, too, the protection of  all men against this one. But even if she could be sure, as she is not, of  the ever-present, all-protecting power of one strong arm, that would  be weak indeed compared with the subtle, all-pervading influence of just  and equal laws for all women. Hence woman's need of the ballot, that she  may hold in her own right hand the weapon of self-protection and defence.\"  The possession of the ballot has not been able to secure for men \"the  subtle and all-pervading influence of just and equal laws,\" and despite  his holding the ballot in his own hand, man has had to hold also a more  apparent weapon if he visit a striker's camp or meddle with an anarchist  riot. Something more tangible than protective influence is needed to make  the public streets of this city safe for women in broad daylight. Again,  they say that \"Wisdom would suggest division of labor in peace as well as  in war.\" Wisdom would have no chance to make such a suggestion, if women  attempted to do the same work as do men, in the same way. There is true  division of labor now, in peace as well as in war.    Suffragists mention as a final indignity the extension of the suffrage to  the negro. Their protest only serves to suggest another forcible  illustration of the fact that law and the enforcement of law may be  different things. The suffrage is not extended to the negro. The Congress  of the United States voted that it should be so extended; and while the  Government stood behind his vote with its military power, the negro voted.  But no one pretends that he has done so, to any practical extent, since  that time. Unarmed, the negro finds that he cannot enforce his own vote  against the will of white men armed to the teeth. The \"all-pervading  influence of just and equal laws\" cannot enforce it for him. Would the  women be any better off, if the men chose that they should not exercise  the vote? Who would enforce it?    This fact and argument show how little arbitration has to do with the  practical decision concerning suffrage. Suffrage writers and speakers harp  upon the thought that arbitration will take the place of force. That  method of settling disputes cannot come too quickly, but it has not come  yet. It has no real bearing on the organization of the state as resting  upon the civil and military service of its citizens. England consented to  arbitrate with the powerful United States, but refused to arbitrate with  defenceless Nicaragua in a far less important matter. Congress has  seriously considered exterminating the remnant of the beautiful herd of  seals that once played in our Northern Pacific waters, because British  subjects have continued, in violation of the Arbitration treaty, to kill  the animals with cruelty. Behind arbitration, as behind all law and order,  military power must always stand and must sometimes be used. One more  proof that the vote is not the real power, but only its insignia, lies in  the fact that legislation has not been able to put an end to strikes and  riots. Laws that forbid them are passed with all due form; but when they  come, as come they do, the reading of the riot act is suspended and the  regiments are ordered to Chicago, or Buffalo, or Brooklyn, or Homestead,  or Cripple Creek, or Cleveland, or the Indian country. The force of those  bodies was not \"brutal,\" it was physical power obeying mental; and unless  mental power can command physical, there is no way in which mental power  can enforce its decrees in government. There are now facing us tremendous  moral issues, which presage tremendous struggles; and a very notable  example of the dangers that would attend woman suffrage is suggested by  them. If women had the power to create a numerical majority when there was  a majority of the law's natural and only defenders against them, they  might soon precipitate a crisis that would lead to bloodshed, which they  would be powerless either to prevent or to allay. Would the majority of  men submit to the minority of men associated with non-combatants? American  history furnishes no reason for supposing that they would. The Dorr War in  Rhode Island is a case in point, in local matters. I am neither an  alarmist nor a believer in war as a panacea; but if we discuss this  subject at all, we must discuss it with facts and not fancies in our  minds.    Dr. Jacobi again says, in her book: \"It may be said, for it has been said,  that the objection to seeing a vote of seven hundred men overcome by a  coalition of three hundred men with eight hundred women, lies in the fact  that the defeated minority knows, if it had a free hand and was allowed to  use fisticuffs, it could pound into a jelly a majority composed so largely  of women. It would feel, therefore, sullen, restive, and justly indignant,  that it should be prohibited from using this power and obliged to submit  to a merely nominal force and supremacy.\"    The objection to seeing seven hundred men defeated by a coalition of three  hundred men with eight hundred women, lies in the fact that the defeated  minority knows that it has a free hand, and that nothing less than eight  hundred men could prevent it from using its physical power, were it so  inclined. Only a force and supremacy that was real, and not nominal, could  make it to submit. The rhetorical trick of belittling the matter by  speaking of it as \"fisticuffs\" will not pass in this discussion. When the  South Carolina negroes on election day looked into the rifle-barrels of  the Red-shirt clubs, it was no matter of fisticuffs. When every statesman  in our country was eagerly seeking a peaceful solution of the Hayes-Tilden  dispute, it was not fisticuffs that they feared. When the Dostie  convention was broken up and its leaders murdered in New Orleans, it was  not by means of fisticuffs. When the Chicago anarchists threw their bomb  into the ranks of the policemen in Haymarket Square, they were not playing  at fisticuffs. When the rail way strikers in Pittsburg stopped the trains,  \"killed\" the locomotives, and burned the freight, there was no fisticuffs  about it. And when a Southern minority refused to abide by the result of  the election of 1860, and the Northern majority shouldered muskets and  went down and compelled them to, not the most flippant writer would have  thought of calling it fisticuffs. All these are simply readily recalled  instances of the necessity for power in the enforcement of law.    She goes on to say: \"But is it only in such a hypothetical case that a  minority would know it could, if allowed to resort to physical force,  shiver to fragments the majority? The burly brakemen in railroad strikes  would, probably, in a fair hand-to-hand encounter, be much bested over all  the stockholders of the road,--weakened, not only because they included  women in their midst, but also by sedentary habits and predominately  indoor occupations. Why do they not try this way of settling their  difficulties? Why do not the classes in England, who still remain entirely  disfranchised, and with whom rests so much physical strength, drop their  fists into the balance as Brennus did his sword, and cut short the futile,  womanish discussion? The answer is ready in every one's mouth. It is not  that it cannot be done, but that, on the whole, people are all agreed that  it is best it should not be done. It is not that physical force is  respected less, but that mental force is respected more.\"    I reply that both these things have been attempted over and over again,  and the agreement of all the wise and good people that it is best that it  should not be done cannot prevent it. Behind the burly brakemen who have  seized the train, and the stockholders to whom it lawfully belongs, there  lies a power greater than all the brakemen and stockholders together. We  call it the power of law. It is, in fact, the power of a sovereign people,  who, having made that law, are able to enforce it against the breakers of  it. It is necessary, in the discussion of this point, to have clearly in  mind the difference between sovereign power and delegated power. When a  member of a stock company attends the annual meeting and casts one vote  for every share that he holds, he is exercising delegated power. The  sovereign people, acting through their representatives in the legislature,  have delegated to the company the power to regulate its affairs in this  way, and guaranteed to each shareholder this privilege. Should a  combination of some of the shareholders attempt to prevent one from  exercising it, he would appeal to the court, and behind the court stands  the power of the people, many times larger than any stock company that  exists.

Soft, cautious footsteps may be heard, and anyone whose eyes are  accustomed to the gloom might have seen three figures creeping quietly  down the street on the side opposite the hotel.  Right over against that building they paused.    \"That is the place\" said one of the three, a giant almost in size.    \"Curse them! they always manage to get comfortable quarters, while I am  an outcast,\" said another, who spoke like an Englishman.    \"Death, gentlemen! what better quarters can you desire than my cave, in  which you have spent several pleasant evenings?\"    \"Bah! Captain Mathias, you have never tasted the sweets of  civilisation.\"    \"And, Signor Hunstani, how much the better are you through having  tasted those sweets?\"    \"Peace, peace!\" growled the giant. \"Let us unite in thought and action,  and to-night obtain our long-sought revenge.\"    \"Well, Toro, I am sure I don't want to quarrel with anyone, except  Harkaway.\"    \"Curse him! and especially that American.\"    \"Hush! let your curses be not loud but deep; you'll awake the town if  you swear so.\"    \"Have I not good cause to? Has he not beaten and put me to shame?\"    \"And have I not suffered equal pain and shame? Yet I am content to bide  my time; you should have patience, Toro.\"    \"Come, come to business, my friends,\" said Captain Mathias; \"there is  the house where our foe resides. How are we to proceed?\"    \"Quietly; hush!\" said Hunston. \"Confound it, how still the air is; the  whole street seems to echo back the lightest whisper.\"    \"Let me get once inside, and I care not if all the street hears,\"  muttered Toro.    \"Which proves you care not if you are unsuccessful,\" said the Greek.    \"How so?\"    \"If we are heard, we shall have the whole street in arms against us,  and I fancy these Inglesi, with their boys and the blacks, are quite  sufficient for the three of us.\"    \"Bah!\" exclaimed Toro.    \"Seriously, though, let us consider how to get into this place,\" said  Hunston.    \"There's the door facing us.\"    \"But have you the key?\"    \"No, but I could send my foot through that plank as easily as  anything,\" growled Toro.    \"Certainly, and you would undoubtedly alarm the whole household by  doing so, whereas we wish to catch them sleeping.\"    \"Well, then, how about the windows?\"    \"Too high to reach,\" said Hunston, \"unless we had a ladder.\"    \"And I doubt if such a thing can be found in the town,\" interposed  Captain Mathias.    \"Well, then, let us see what there is at the back of the house.  Captain, you have eyes like a cat or an owl; just glance up and down  the street to see if there is anyone about.\"    The Greek looked in all directions.    \"Not even a mouse is stirring,\" said he.    So the three villains, drawing their cloaks closely round them, stole  silently away from the shelter of the friendly doorway, where the  foregoing conversation had taken place, and proceeded round to the back  of the hotel.    To reach the point desired, they had, of course, to cross the road,  which was tolerably wide, and then skirt a kind of paddock.    There were few stars to be seen, and the moon--a new one, and perhaps  not yet fully acquainted with her business--was partly hidden behind  some clouds, though not so entirely obscured but that the forms of the  three brigands cast deep shadows on the ground.    But surely that is not a shadow, which as they move, moves also from an  adjoining doorway, and follows them.    Like them, it is wrapped in a cloak; like them, it stalks along slowly  and erect, but unlike them, it makes no noise.    Its footfall is silent as that of the panther lurking in the jungle.    Its very breath, if it has any, seems hushed.    The three villains go slowly, and the shadow, or substance, whatever it  may be, keeps the same pace, till they reach the open field at the back  of the hotel.    Hunston, Toro, and the Greek then stand side by side looking towards  the hotel, but the shadow sinks down out of sight by the side of the  fence.    Another hasty look round, and then the Greek brigand pronounced that  they were safe.    \"No fear of being interrupted here.\"    \"Well now let us settle,\" said Toro; \"I am anxious to be at them.\"    \"But see,\" said Hunston, \"there are lights moving; it is not safe yet.\"    \"Not till half-an-hour after midnight.\"    \"And now----\"    \"It is half-past ten o'clock.\"    \"Two hours,\" groaned Toro.    \"Better wait four than fail,\" said Hunston.    \"Cold-blooded Englishman, what know you of the furious rate at which my  blood boils in my veins? In that house is the man who struck me to the  earth.\"    \"Wait two hours, then you may have a good chance of paying off the  score.\"    \"And I will, too, with greater interest than even usurer charged his  hapless client. I wonder which room the cursed Americano sleeps in.\"    \"The third room on the right-hand side of the first corridor, where you  ascend the great staircase.\"    Captain Mathias said this as promptly and positively as though he  himself had shown our friends to bed.    After a pause he continued--    \"Mr. and Mrs. Harkaway have the first room; Mr. and Mrs. Harvey the  second; the third is a double-bedded apartment, one couch being  occupied by the American, the other by the two boys.\"    \"You seem to have pretty exact information, captain,\" said Hunston.    \"Yes, there is little going on there that does not come to my ears. One  of the porters is a spy in my employ.\"    \"Why did you not get a key from him?\"    \"I have one; it opens the back door.\"    Toro had, during the last bit of conversation, been growling to himself  a choice vocabulary of Italian oaths, occasionally shaking his fist at  the building which contained the objects of his hatred.    He now turned to his companions.    \"And where do you propose to pass the two hours that must elapse?\"    \"At the bottom of yonder field is a thicket, where we shall be free  from observation. We can smoke our pipes there. By-the-bye, the patrol  goes round about midnight.\"    \"We must be cautious,\" said Hunston.    \"Come along, then.\"    The three villains then walked off in the direction of the thicket  where they were to hide.    A minute afterwards a shadow rose from the ditch where he had been  crouching, and stood looking after them long after they had been lost  in the gloom.    \"Just in time,\" muttered the so-called shadow, who was in good truth as  substantial flesh and blood as any in Greece.    \"If I had not wandered hither in search of my daughter, probably  half-a-dozen murders would have been committed. However, I'll thwart the  rascals, as sure as my name is Petrus.\"    For Petrus it was, from Magic Island, who had been playing spy on the  movements of the three conspirators.    He stood there in deep thought for a few minutes.    \"I must warn some of the people in the hotel, but I should like to get  this business over without alarming Mrs. Harkaway or the other lady.  The question is, how?\"    He reached the front door of the hotel, and pulled at the bell handle.    After an interval of two or three minutes, a light shone through the  keyhole, and a voice asked--    \"Who is there?\"    \"A traveller, in search of food and bed.\"    \"Are you alone?\"    \"Yes.\"    Then the door was unbolted, and the traveller entered.    \"Is the proprietor of the hotel in bed yet?\" he asked.    \"I don't know, sir.\"    \"He must be roused at once. I have important news for him from a  distant land.\"    The porter stared, but did not seem inclined to call the proprietor,  noticing which, Petrus said--    \"I shall be sorry to alarm all the house, when I only want one person;  but if you don't quickly bring him, I'll ring half a dozen of these  bells at such a rate that he'll think the house is on fire.\"    Seeing the stranger was in earnest, the porter went to the proprietor's  room, and soon returned with him to the hall where Petrus was waiting.    \"I should like to have a few words with you _in private_, sir,\"  said the traveller, with a strong emphasis on the words we have  italicised.    \"Certainly. You may go to bed, Theodorus.\"    The porter somewhat sulkily retired to a kind of pantry, where he  slept, and the proprietor of the hotel, softly following, turned the  key upon him.    \"I have my doubts about that fellow,\" he said as he returned. \"But now,  sir, what is your pleasure with me?\"    Petrus at once told him what he had heard, and great was the alarm of  the hotel-keeper.    \"What shall we do? Send for the police?\"    Petrus, after a short silence, said--    \"No.\"    \"What then? I cannot allow my guests to be murdered. Why, these  scoundrels have already made one attempt on Mr. Harkaway and his  friends at a masquerade.\"    Just at that moment a guttural voice was heard singing--                         \"Ole Ikey Mole                        Was a lushy ole soul,                        And a lushy ole soul was he.\"    \"Now den, you nigger, be quiet,\" said another voice.    \"Who are these people?\" asked Petrus.    \"Two black men in attendance on the Harkaway party,\" said the  proprietor of the hotel.    \"Just the men. I know a little of them. I have fought side by side with  them. Now I have a proposal to make, which is that we put these  brigands to flight in a ludicrous manner, which will annoy them more  than being beaten in fight. Myself and the black men will do it with  your assistance and permission.\"    \"Anything, so that there is no bloodshed.\"    \"That I will guarantee. Please call the two worthy dark-skins.\"    Sunday and Monday, who had been keeping it up in the kitchen, were  called and acquainted with the state of affairs.    \"What, Massa Petrus,\" said Sunday in surprise, \"what you do here? Am  you got dat black rascal pirate with you?\"    \"No; the pirate chief is dead. You will find his bones on the  island--Magic Island, as young Jack Harkaway named it. Yes, my revenge  is complete.
