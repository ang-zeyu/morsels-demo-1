Here let me pause in pointing out the unwisdom of the Saints, to make  an explanation, lest there should be a misunderstanding of what is thus  far set down respecting their transgressions, by reason of which they  were prevailed against by their enemies. These transgressions, be it  understood, were no violations of the laws of the land, nor did they  consist in any acts of aggression or of trespass upon their Missouri  neighbors. The old settlers of Missouri themselves are our witnesses  here; for in all their procedure in this Jackson county persecution  there is no accusation made against the Saints of violations of the  law. On the contrary, in their public utterances against the Saints and  in justification of their own course, the old settlers declare--after  expressing their determination to rid their society of the Saints,  peacefully if they could, but forcibly if they must--\"_that the arm of  the civil law does not afford us a guarantee, or at least a sufficient  one, against the evils which are now inflicted upon us, and seem to  be increasing by the said religious sect_.\" [27] A more emphatic  acknowledgement that the alleged offenses of the Saints were not  cognizable by the laws, that the Saints had not violated the laws of  the land, could not be made.    In their second manifesto the mob said: \"_The evil is one that no one  could have foreseen, and is therefore unprovided for by the laws;  and the delays incident to legislation would put the mischief beyond  remedy_.\" [28] Another admission that amounts to a declaration, that  the Saints, whatever the nature of the complaints made against them  were, had not violated any of the laws of the state, that their  offending was not cognizable by the laws of the land.    The transgressions and sinfulness referred to in the revelations and  letters of reproof and warning quoted, and for which transgressions  the Saints were left in the hands of their enemies, were sins against  each other and the Lord--unbelief in the word of God, hardness of heart  towards each other, rejection of the servants of God, fault-finding,  bickerings, jealousies, covetousness, pride, idleness, boastfulness,  levity of thought and conduct, disregard of the scriptures, especially  of the Book of Mormon, neglecting to instruct their children in sacred  things and to bring them up in the fear and admonition of the Lord; all  of which were displeasing to the Lord, contrary to His commandments,  and a violation of the conditions upon which He had promised to redeem  Zion and preserve His people from their enemies. \"Ye call {XLI} upon my  name for revelations;\" said the Lord to the Elders in Zion, \"and I give  them unto you; and inasmuch as ye keep not my sayings, which I give  unto you, ye become transgressors, and justice and judgment are the  penalty which is affixed to my law. * * * I, the Lord, am bound when ye  do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise.\" [29]    This, then, was the nature of their offenses; they sinned against  the Lord in the particulars named; they sinned against each other in  the manner described; they did not trespass against their non-Mormon  neighbors, nor break the laws of the land; but they failed to live  in accordance with the high moral and spiritual law of the Gospel;  they failed to meet the conditions on which God was pledged to their  maintenance upon the land of Zion, and hence were left in the hands of  their enemies.    At the commencement of this subdivision of the Introduction I called  attention to the great things which God had revealed to the Saints, the  greatness of the dispensation committed unto them, accompanied by the  promise to establish Zion and give unto the Saints the land thereof  as an everlasting inheritance. It would be marvelous indeed, and past  all human experience, if these great things did not turn the heads of  some of the weak-minded, and make them vain-glorious and boastful. I  doubt not for a moment that many vain and foolish things were said by  such characters in the presence of, and perhaps directly to, the old  settlers of Jackson county, about the Saints taking possession of the  land, and the wicked being driven away. There was doubtless enough of  this kind of talk to give color to what the Missourians charged on this  head, viz., \"They [the Saints] declare openly that their God hath given  them this county of land, and that sooner or later they must and will  take possession of our lands for an inheritance.\"    The Missourians made much of, and attached a sinister meaning to  the following expression in one of the revelations to the Saints:  \"_The land of Zion shall not be obtained but by purchase or by  blood, otherwise there is none inheritance for you_.\" [30] This the  Missourians pretended to regard as a threat to take possession of  their land by armed conquest. Had they read the context of the passage  they would have known how entirely groundless were their fears, if  indeed they had any fears, for I am convinced that all their expressed  apprehensions on this head were mere pretense. The passage and its  context are: \"Wherefore the land of Zion shall not be obtained but by  purchase or by blood, otherwise there is none inheritance for you. _And  if by purchase, behold you {XLII} are blessed; and if by blood, as you  are forbidden to shed blood, lo, your enemies are upon you, and ye  shall be scourged from city to city, and from synagogue to synagogue  and but few shall stand to receive an inheritance_.\" [31]    Clearly this is a warning to the Saints, not a threat to the  Missourians. If the Saints obtained the land by purchase they were  blessed. If by blood--since the Saints were forbidden to shed blood,  lo their enemies would be upon them and they would be driven from  city to city--not the Missourians, but the Saints. In consequence of  the agitation of this matter by the foolish, the following passage  occurred in _The Evening and Morning Star_ for July, 1833, addressed  to the churches scattered abroad: \"To suppose that we can come up here  and take possession of this land by the shedding of blood, would be  setting at nought the law of the glorious Gospel, and also the word  of our great Redeemer. And to suppose that we can take possession of  this country without making regular purchases of the same according to  the laws of our nation, would be reproaching this great Republic, in  which the most of us were born, and under whose auspices we all have  protection.\" [32]    Of this the Missourians said that whether they were to be dispossessed  of their lands \"by the hand of the destroying angel, the judgments of  God, or the arm of power, they [the Saints] are not fully agreed among  themselves. Some recent remarks in the _Evening and Morning Star_,  their organ in this place, by their tendency to moderate such hopes,  and repress such desires, show plainly that many of this deluded and  infatuated people have been taught to believe that our lands were to be  won from us by the sword!\" [33]    Thus the very efforts of the Church to correct the misconceptions and  silence the utterances of the over-zealous and foolish members, were  made to contribute as proof that the Saints contemplated the very armed  conquest of the land which they disclaimed. History, however, will do  the Saints justice, and it will say, and now says, that neither their  general principles, nor the special commandments under which they  moved into the land of Zion, nor any act of theirs warranted the least  suspicion that they at any time contemplated taking possession of the  land by force, or in any other manner whatsoever except by purchase  and possession under the laws of the state of Missouri and the United  States. And while history will do them this justice it will at the  same time say that the \"fears\" of the Missourians on this head were  simulated; that to the foolish boasts of a few ignorant persons they  attached an undue importance because it happened to give a coloring to  their pretended fears in the eyes of those at a distance who had no  {XLIII} opportunity to learn the truth, and tended to prejudice the  public mind against the Saints, and thus served the purpose of their  enemies.    In like manner there may have been some talk among the same class of  people--the ignorant and over-zealous Church members--respecting the  Indians, and their future union with the Saints in redeeming the land  of Zion; a circumstance which led the good people of Clay county and  Governor Dunklin, to refer to the charge of the Saints holding illicit  communication with the Indians, designing to employ them in taking  possession of the land of Zion. Of this charge also history will and  does vindicate the Saints. It will, and does say, that they disclaimed  holding any such communication; that neither their general principles  nor any special commandment from God, and particularly that no action  of theirs warranted any suspicion on the subject, much less justified  the charge of such a diabolical purpose.    After the Saints withdrew from Clay county and at the suggestion  of her citizens--including some of the most influential men in  western Missouri, some of whom afterwards attained national  reputations--located in the sparsely settled counties of Caldwell and  Daviess, the situation became somewhat changed. For two years the work  of purchasing lands, locating settlements, opening farms, establishing  merchantile houses, and preparing for manufacturing and commercial  enterprises went steadily on. In Caldwell and adjoining counties, by  the autumn of 1838, the Saints had opened two thousand farms, and paid  to the general government three hundred and eighteen thousand dollars  for land, which at the minimum price for government land would give  them over two"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47708"],[0,"Biography and Family Record of Lorenzo Snow (#10)"],[1,"to a gun.  Hunting, in the forests of Ohio, was a pastime that to me possessed the  most fascinating attractions. It never occurred to my mind that it was  wrong--that indulging in \"what was sport to me was death to them;\" that  in shooting turkeys, squirrels, etc., I was taking life that I could  not give; therefore I indulged in the murderous sport without the least  compunction of conscience.    But at this time a change came over me. While moving slowly  forward in pursuit of something to kill, my mind was arrested with  the reflection on the nature of my pursuit--that of amusing myself by  giving pain and death to harmless, innocent creatures that perhaps had  as much right to life and enjoyment as myself. I realized that such  indulgence was without any justification, and feeling condemned, I  laid my gun on my shoulder, returned home, and from that time to this  have felt no inclination for that murderous amusement. In fact, years  had elapsed since the days of boyhood sport, and in the interval I  had neither time nor opportunity for reckless indulgence. Education,  the leading star of my youth, had so entirely engrossed my ambition  that, until the Gospel of the Lord Jesus took possession of my mind,  it was the genii before which everything else had to bow; then, almost  simultaneously, missionary labors succeeded book studies, and no room  was left for sportive scenes.    A spirit of mobocracy, which had previously manifested itself, was  continually on the increase all around us, and very naturally suggested  to our minds the thought of preparation for defense. The house we  lived in, with the plantation on which it stood, father purchased on  his arrival, and paid for in full. It was a \"double log house,\" with  an alley about three feet wide between the two. In this alley our  faithful watchdog was stationed, and we knew that no intruder could  possibly reach either door before the dog would give an alarm, which,  so far, was very satisfactory. But, to our deep regret, the mobocrats,  finding the dog out of sight of the house, shot him down. He had, by  his affectionate faithfulness, so won our love and confidence that he  almost seemed one of the family--we sincerely mourned his loss, and I  assisted my brothers in giving him a formal burial.    Amid the threatenings of mobocrats to either drive or destroy us, a  circumstance occurred, which, though seriously exciting at the time,  afterwards afforded us much amusement. One night at about 11 o'clock,  we all were suddenly aroused from sleep by the discharge of fire  arms, accompanied with loud shouts, apparently about a mile distant.  We supposed that our enemies had commenced their depredations by  putting their threats into execution, and were making an attack on  our people, and the probability was that they would visit us in turn.  We immediately began to prepare for defense by barricading the doors  and windows, and distributing among all the members of the family  such weapons for protection as were available, viz: one sword, two or  three guns, pitchforks, axes, shovels and tongs, etc. We proposed that  mother take her choice, and she thought that she could do the best  execution with the shovel. With no small degree of anxiety, not only  for ourselves, but also in behalf of our friends situated at the point  from which the exciting sounds proceeded, we kept up a sleepless watch  until morning, when intelligence was brought, explaining the cause of  the night alarm, as follows: A company of our brethren had been to a  distant settlement to accomplish some business requisite in consequence  of threatened mob violence, and on their return, having peacefully and  successfully accomplished their object, discharged their fire arms,  accompanied with a shout expressive of their happy success--resulting  in our false alarm and subsequent amusement.

The journal speaks: About the first of October of this year (1838),  the spirit of my missionary calling pressed so heavily upon my mind,  that I longed to engage in its labors. Elder Abel Butterfield, who  had accompanied me on a mission in Ohio, proposed to be my traveling  companion at this time, and although not having yet fully recovered  from the effects of my summer sickness, and had not strength sufficient  to endure much fatigue, I felt that I must go. My father and others  thought it not prudent, but my trust was in God, and I felt an  assurance that He would give me strength and restore me to soundness  of health sooner if I went forth depending on Him, than if I remained  at home. Accordingly, with the necessary books and a few underclothes  packed in my valise, I bid adieu to father, mother, brothers and  sisters, and, with Brother Butterfield, started forth to proclaim the  word of the Lord to those who had ears to hear. At first I could only  walk a short distance before I was compelled to sit down and rest, but  my ability to walk gradually increased until I was perfectly restored.    The second day after we started, we arrived in Far West, where we  stopped a short time to visit our friends. Father Smith, the Patriarch,  gave us his blessing and much good fatherly counsel, and expressed much  sympathy for us in connection with our mission through the southern  part of Missouri, the immediate field of our prospective labors. At  that time the excitement against the Latter-day Saints had been fanned  to fever heat in every part of the State, consequently it was more than  probable that we should meet with abuse and have to submit to many  hardships.    In going the rounds in Far West, we called on Elder Thomas B. Marsh,  then President of the Quorum of the Twelve. I think at that time he  was indulging a spirit of apostacy, which, not long after, culminated  in his severance from the Church. In our conversation with him, our  spirits and his did not intermingle, and he seemed utterly blind in  relation to the condition of things and the spirit of the times. He  expressed unbounded charity for our enemies--said he did not think they  intended us much harm--they were not naturally inclined to wickedness,  etc. It is a noticeable feature in those who cherish a spirit of  apostacy from the light of the Gospel, that they adopt the doctrine of  Universalism and think none too wicked for a complete and unconditional  salvation.    On leaving Far West, we directed our course to the Missouri River,  where we found a camp of our brethren, some of whom were intending  to go down the river and return to their homes, somewhere in the  southern part of the State. We joined together in constructing a kind  of water-craft--it was not a canoe, neither a skiff or raft, and  to name it a boat would be preposterous; but, whatever its proper  cognomen, its capacity was sufficient to accommodate five men, and, on  the seventeenth of October, in the midst of a heavy fall of snow, we  launched it, and started on a most perilous passage down the turbid  waters of a turbulent river. At that season of the year the stream  was very low, and frequently through the day we experienced much  difficulty in following the channel. We took turns in rowing, and, as  night approached, we began in sober earnest to look out for a suitable  landing, but were forced to continue on until it was quite dark, when  we were every moment in danger of being upset by \"sawyers,\" for we  could hardly discern them in time to shun them. Those \"sawyers\" were  trees or parts of trees--one end firmly embedded in the bottom of the  stream, while the other end, by the motion and pressure of the current,  was constantly vaccillating up and down, often swiftly and powerfully.    We met with several narrow escapes, and anxiously watched for a place  of landing. At length we espied upon the bank a bright light, to which  we directed our course, and, much to our relief, were enabled to bring  our little bark safely to land, and after securing it, we climbed  up the bank, and directly found ourselves in the presence of rough,  savage looking fellows, who told us they were hunters and trappers; but  their appearance and conversation, and the whisperings of the Spirit,  impressed us at once with the feeling that there was more safety on  the river, searching our way amid the threatening \"sawyers,\" than in  remaining through the night in such forbidding company. Accordingly we  again embarked, and pushed into the fluctuating stream. It was very  dark, and as we cautiously wended our way, our ears were ever and anon  saluted with the fearful sounds of the dashing \"sawyers\" ahead. It was  prudent to keep as close to the bank as possible, in order to avail  ourselves of the first opportunity to secure a landing.    We had one man at the bow to watch for \"sawyers,\" while the others  kept a vigilant look out for a place to haul up. The dense darkness of  the stormy night prevented us discovering danger until we were on the  point of being enveloped in it, and in several instances, our escape  seemed truly miraculous. At last our perilous night voyage terminated,  having drifted into a swift current which fortunately forced us upon  a low place in the bank, covered with willows, briers and thorns,  through which, after having fastened our bark, "]]]
