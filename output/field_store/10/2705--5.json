I rose, and wanted to leave.    Wanda said nothing, but embraced me and drew me back on the ottoman.  She began to kiss me anew, and this silent language was so  comprehensible, so convincing--    And it told me more than I dared to understand.    A languid abandonment pervaded Wanda's entire being. What a  voluptuous softness there was in the gloaming of her half-closed  eyes, in the red flood of her hair which shimmered faintly under the  white powder, in the red and white satin which crackled about her  with every movement, in the swelling ermine of the _kazabaika_  in which she carelessly nestled.    \"Please,\" I stammered, \"but you will be angry with me.\"    \"Do with me what you will,\" she whispered.    \"Well, then whip me, or I shall go mad.\"    \"Haven't I forbidden you,\" said Wanda sternly, \"but you are  incorrigible.\"    \"Oh, I am so terribly in love.\" I had sunken on my knees, and was  burying my glowing face in her lap.    \"I really believe,\" said Wanda thoughtfully, \"that your madness is  nothing but a demonic, unsatisfied sensuality. _Our unnatural way  of life must generate such illnesses._ Were you less virtuous, you  would be completely sane.\"    \"Well then, make me sane,\" I murmured. My hands were running through  her hair and playing tremblingly with the gleaming fur, which rose  and fell like a moonlit wave upon her heaving bosom, and drove all  my senses into confusion.    And I kissed her. No, she kissed me savagely, pitilessly, as if she  wanted to slay me with her kisses. I was as in a delirium, and had  long since lost my reason, but now I, too, was breathless. I sought  to free myself.    \"What is the matter?\" asked Wanda.    \"I am suffering agonies.\"    \"You are suffering--\" she broke out into a loud amused laughter.    \"You laugh!\" I moaned, \"have you no idea--\"    She was serious all of a sudden. She raised my head in her hands,  and with a violent gesture drew me to her breast.    \"Wanda,\" I stammered.    \"Of course, you enjoy suffering,\" she said, and laughed again, \"but  wait, I'll bring you to your senses.\"    \"No, I will no longer ask,\" I exclaimed, \"whether you want to belong  to me for always or for only a brief moment of intoxication. I want  to drain my happiness to the full. You are mine now, and I would  rather lose you than never to have had you.\"    \"Now you are sensible,\" she said. She kissed me again with her  murderous lips. I tore the ermine apart and the covering of lace and  her naked breast surged against mine.    Then my senses left me--    The first thing I remember is the moment when I saw blood dripping  from my hand, and she asked apathetically: \"Did you scratch me?\"    \"No, I believe, I have bitten you.\"           *       *       *       *       *    It is strange how every relation in life assumes a different face as  soon as a new person enters.    We spent marvellous days together; we visited the mountains and  lakes, we read together, and I completed Wanda's portrait. And how  we loved one another, how beautiful her smiling face was!    Then a friend of hers arrived, a divorced woman somewhat older, more  experienced, and less scrupulous than Wanda. Her influence is already  making itself felt in every direction.    Wanda wrinkles her brows, and displays a certain impatience with me.    Has she ceased loving me?           *       *       *       *       *    For almost a fortnight this unbearable restraint has lain upon us.  Her friend lives with her, and we are never alone. A circle of men  surrounds the young women. With my seriousness and melancholy I am  playing an absurd role as lover. Wanda treats me like a stranger.    To-day, while out walking, she staid behind with me. I saw that this  was done intentionally, and I rejoiced. But what did she tell me?    \"My friend doesn't understand how I can love you. She doesn't think  you either handsome or particularly attractive otherwise. She is  telling me from morning till night about the glamour of the frivolous  life in the capital, hinting at the advantages to which I could lay  claim, the large parties which I would find there, and the  distinguished and handsome admirers which I would attract. But of  what use is all this, since it happens that I love you.\"    For a moment I lost my breath, then I said: \"I have no wish to stand  in the way of your happiness, Wanda. Do not consider me.\" Then I  raised my hat, and let her go ahead. She looked at me surprised, but  did not answer a syllable.    When by chance I happened to be close to her on the way back, she  secretly pressed my hand. Her glance was so radiant, so full of  promised happiness, that in a moment all the torments of these days  were forgotten and all their wounds healed.    I now am aware again of how much I love her.           *       *       *       *       *    \"My friend has complained about you,\" said Wanda to-day.    \"Perhaps she feels that I despise her.\"    \"But why do you despise her, you foolish young man?\" exclaimed  Wanda, pulling my ears with both hands.    \"Because she is a hypocrite,\" I said. \"I respect only a woman who is  actually virtuous, or who openly lives for pleasure's sake.\"    \"Like me, for instance,\" replied Wanda jestingly, \"but you see,  child, a woman can only do that in the rarest cases. She can neither  be as gaily sensual, nor as spiritually free as man; her state is  always a mixture of the sensual and spiritual. Her heart desires to  enchain man permanently, while she herself is ever subject to the  desire for change. The result is a conflict, and thus usually against  her wishes lies and deception enter into her actions and personality  and corrupt her character.\"    \"Certainly that is true,\" I said. \"The transcendental character with  which woman wants to stamp love leads her to deception.\"    \"But the world likewise demands it,\" Wanda interrupted. \"Look at  this woman. She has a husband and a lover in Lemberg and has found  a new admirer here. She deceives all three and yet is honored by all  and respected by the world.\"    \"I don't care,\" I exclaimed, \"but she is to leave you alone; she  treats you like an article of commerce.\"    \"Why not?\" the beautiful woman interrupted vivaciously. \"Every woman  has the instinct or desire to draw advantage out of her attractions,  and much is to be said for giving one's self without love or pleasure  because if you do it in cold blood, you can reap profit to best  advantage.\"    \"Wanda, what are you saying?\"    \"Why not?\" she said, \"and take note of what I am about to say to you.  _Never feel secure with the woman you love,_ for there are more  dangers in woman's nature than you imagine. Women are neither as  _good_ as their admirers and defenders maintain, nor as _bad_ as their  enemies make them out to be. _Woman's character is characterlessness._  The best woman will momentarily go down into the mire, and the worst  unexpectedly rises to deeds of greatness and goodness and puts to  shame those that despise her. No woman is so good or so bad, but that  at any moment she is capable of the most diabolical as well as of the  most divine, of the filthiest as well as of the purest, thoughts,  emotions, and actions. In spite of all the advances of civilization,  woman has remained as she came out of the hand of nature. She has the  nature of a savage, who is faithful or faithless, magnanimous or  cruel, according to the impulse that dominates at the moment.  Throughout history it has always been a serious deep culture which has  produced moral character. Man even when he is selfish or evil always  follows _principles,_ woman never follows anything but _impulses._  Don't ever forget that, and never feel secure with the woman you  love.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Her friend has left. At last an evening alone with her again. It  seems as if Wanda had saved up all the love, which had been kept from  her, for this superlative evening; never had she been so kind, so  near, so full of tenderness.    What happiness to cling to her lips, and to die away in her arms! In  a state of relaxation and wholly mine, her head rests against my  breast, and with drunken rapture our eyes seek each other.    I cannot yet believe, comprehend, that this woman is mine, wholly  mine.    \"She is right on one point,\" Wanda began, without moving, without  opening her eyes, as if she were asleep.    \"Who?\"    She remained silent.    \"Your friend?\"    She nodded. \"Yes, she is right, you are not a man, you are a  dreamer, a charming cavalier, and you certainly would be a priceless  slave, but I cannot imagine you as husband.\"    I was frightened.    \"What is the matter? You are trembling?\"    \"I tremble at the thought of how easily I might lose you,\" I replied.    \"Are you made less happy now, because of this?\" she replied. \"Does  it rob you of any of your joys, that I have belonged to another  before I did to you, that others after you will possess me, and would  you enjoy less if another were made happy simultaneously with you?\"    \"Wanda!\"    \"You see,\" she continued, \"that would be a way out. You won't ever  lose me then. I care deeply for you and intellectually we are  harmonious, and I should like to live with you always, if in addition  to you I might have--\"    \"What an idea,\" I cried. \"You fill me with a sort of horror.\"    \"Do you love me any the less?\"    \"On the contrary.\"    Wanda had raised herself on her left arm. \"I believe,\" she said,  \"that to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6877"],[0,"The Head of Kay's (#10)"],[1,"\"you'd better start now to pack  them all up again. And why, my son? Because you are no longer a  Blackburnite. That's what.\"    Kennedy stared.    \"I've just had the whole yarn from Blackburn,\" continued Jimmy Silver.  \"Our dear old pal, Mr Kay, wanting somebody in his house capable of  keeping order, by way of a change, has gone to the Old Man and  borrowed you. So _you're_ head of Kay's now. There's an honour  for you.\"          IX    THE SENSATIONS OF AN EXILE      \"What\" shouted Kennedy.    He sprang to his feet as if he had had an electric shock.    Jimmy Silver, having satisfied his passion for the dramatic by the  abruptness with which he had exploded his mine, now felt himself at  liberty to be sympathetic.    \"It's quite true,\" he said. \"And that's just how I felt when Blackburn  told me. Blackburn's as sick as anything. Naturally he doesn't see the  point of handing you over to Kay. But the Old Man insisted, so he  caved in. He wanted to see you as soon as you arrived. You'd better go  now. I'll finish your packing.\"    This was noble of Jimmy, for of all the duties of life he loathed  packing most.    \"Thanks awfully,\" said Kennedy, \"but don't you bother. I'll do it when  I get back. But what's it all about? What made Kay want a man? Why  won't Fenn do? And why me?\"    \"Well, it's easy to see why they chose you. They reflected that you'd  had the advantage of being in Blackburn's with me, and seeing how a  house really should be run. Kay wants a head for his house. Off he  goes to the Old Man. 'Look here,' he says, 'I want somebody shunted  into my happy home, or it'll bust up. And it's no good trying to put  me off with an inferior article, because I won't have it. It must be  somebody who's been trained from youth up by Silver.' 'Then,' says the  Old Man, reflectively, 'you can't do better than take Kennedy. I  happen to know that Silver has spent years in showing him the straight  and narrow path. You take Kennedy.' 'All right,' says Kay; 'I always  thought Kennedy a bit of an ass myself, but if he's studied under  Silver he ought to know how to manage a house. I'll take him. Advise  our Mr Blackburn to that effect, and ask him to deliver the goods at  his earliest convenience. Adoo, mess-mate, adoo!' And there you  are--that's how it was.\"    \"But what's wrong with Fenn?\"    \"My dear chap! Remember last term. Didn't Fenn have a regular scrap  with Kay, and get shoved into extra for it? And didn't he wreck the  concert in the most sportsmanlike way with that encore of his? Think  the Old Man is going to take that grinning? Not much! Fenn made a  ripping fifty against Kent in the holidays--I saw him do it--but they  don't count that. It's a wonder they didn't ask him to leave. Of  course, I think it's jolly rough on Fenn, but I don't see that you can  blame them. Not the Old Man, at any rate. He couldn't do anything  else. It's all Kay's fault that all this has happened, of course. I'm  awfully sorry for you having to go into that beastly hole, but from  Kay's point of view it's a jolly sound move. You may reform the  place.\"    \"I doubt it.\"    \"So do I--very much. I didn't say you would--I said you might. I  wonder if Kay means to give you a free hand. It all depends on that.\"    \"Yes. If he's going to interfere with me as he used to with Fenn,  he'll want to bring in another head to improve on me.\"    \"Rather a good idea, that,\" said Jimmy Silver, laughing, as he always  did when any humorous possibilities suggested themselves to him. \"If  he brings in somebody to improve on you, and then somebody else to  improve on him, and then another chap to improve on him, he ought to  have a decent house in half-a-dozen years or so.\"    \"The worst of it is,\" said Kennedy, \"that I've got to go to Kay's as a  sort of rival to Fenn. I shouldn't mind so much if it wasn't for that.  I wonder how he'll take it! Do you think he knows about it yet? He  didn't enjoy being head, but that's no reason why he shouldn't cut up  rough at being shoved back to second prefect. It's a beastly  situation.\"    \"Beastly,\" agreed Jimmy Silver. \"Look here,\" he added, after a pause,  \"there's no reason, you know, why this should make any difference. To  us, I mean. What I mean to say is, I don't see why we shouldn't see  each other just as often, and so on, simply because you are in another  house, and all that sort of thing. You know what I mean.\"    He spoke shamefacedly, as was his habit whenever he was serious. He  liked Kennedy better than anyone he knew, and hated to show his  feelings. Anything remotely connected with sentiment made him  uncomfortable.    \"Of course,\" said Kennedy, awkwardly.    \"You'll want a refuge,\" said Silver, in his normal manner, \"now that  you're going to see wild life in Kay's. Don't forget that I'm always  at home in my study in the afternoons--admission on presentation of a  visiting-card.\"    \"All right,\" said Kennedy, \"I'll remember. I suppose I'd better go and  see Blackburn now.\"    Mr Blackburn was in his study. He was obviously disgusted and  irritated by what had happened. Loyalty to the headmaster, and an  appreciation of his position as a member of the staff led him to try  and conceal his feelings as much as possible in his interview with  Kennedy, but the latter understood as plainly as if his house-master  had burst into a flow of abuse and complaint. There had always been an  excellent understanding--indeed, a friendship--between Kennedy and Mr  Blackburn, and the master was just as sorry to lose his second prefect  as the latter was to go.    \"Well, Kennedy,\" he said, pleasantly. \"I hope you had a good time in  the holidays. I suppose Silver has told you the melancholy news--that  you are to desert us this term? It is a great pity. We shall all be  very sorry to lose you. I don't look forward to seeing you bowl us all  out in the house-matches next summer,\" he added, with a smile, \"though  we shall expect a few full-pitches to leg, for the sake of old times.\"    He meant well, but the picture he conjured up almost made Kennedy  break down. Nothing up to the present had made him realise the  completeness of his exile so keenly as this remark of Mr Blackburn's  about his bowling against the side for which he had taken so many  wickets in the past. It was a painful thought.    \"I am afraid you won't have quite such a pleasant time in Mr Kay's as  you have had here,\" resumed the house-master. \"Of course, I know that,  strictly speaking, I ought not to talk like this about another  master's house; but you can scarcely be unaware of the reasons that  have led to this change. You must know that you are being sent to pull  Mr Kay's house together. This is strictly between ourselves, of  course. I think you have a difficult task before you, but I don't  fancy that you will find it too much for you. And mind you come here  as often as you please. I am sure Silver and the others will be glad  to see you. Goodbye, Kennedy. I think you ought to be getting across  now to Mr Kay's. I told him that you would be there before half-past  nine. Good night.\"    \"Good night, sir,\" said Kennedy.    He wandered out into the house dining-room. Somehow, though Kay's was  only next door, he could not get rid of the feeling that he was about  to start on a long journey, and would never see his old house again.  And in a sense this was so. He would probably visit Blackburn's  tomorrow afternoon, but it would not be the same. Jimmy Silver would  greet him like a brother, and he would brew in the same study in which  he had always brewed, and sit in the same chair; but it would not be  the same. He would be an outsider, a visitor, a stranger within the  gates, and--worst of all--a Kayite. Nothing could alter that.    The walk of the dining-room were covered with photographs of the house  cricket and football teams for the last fifteen years. Looking at  them, he felt more than ever how entirely his school life had been  bound up in his house. From his first day at Eckleton he had been  taught the simple creed of the Blackburnite, that Eckleton was the  finest school in the three kingdoms, and that Blackburn's was the  finest house in the finest school.    Under the gas-bracket by the door hung the first photograph in which  he appeared, the cricket team of four years ago. He had just got the  last place in front of Challis on the strength of a tremendous catch  for the house second in a scratch game two days before the  house-matches began. It had been a glaring fluke, but it had impressed  Denny, the head of the house, who happened to see it, and had won him  his place.    He walked round the room, looking at each photograph in turn. It  seemed incredible that he had no longer any right to an interest in  the success of Blackburn's. He could have endured leaving all this  when his time at school was up, for that would have been the natural  result of the passing of years. But to be transplanted abruptly and  with a wrench from his native soil was too much. He went upstairs to  pack, suffering from as severe an attack of the blues as any youth of  eighteen had experienced since blues were first invented.    Jimmy Silver hovered round, while he packed, with expressions of  sympathy and bitter remarks concerning Mr Kay and his wicked works,  and, when the operation was concluded, helped Kennedy carry his box  over to his new house with the air of one seeing a friend off to the  parts beyond the equator.    It was ten o'clock by the time the front door of Kay's closed upon its  new head. Kennedy went to the matron's sanctum to be instructed in the  geography of the house. The matron, a severe lady, whose faith in  human nature had been terribly shaken by five years of office in  Kay's, showed him his dormitory and study with a lack of geniality  which added a deeper tinge of azure to Kennedy's blues. \"So you've  come to live here, have you?\" her manner seemed to say; \"well, I pity  you, that's all. A nice time"]]]
