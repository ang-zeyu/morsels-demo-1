I alighted and my friend took  charge of my horse and stationed himself at the door while I got down  on all fours and crawled inside. I seated myself on a little bench at  one side of the entrance. When my eyes got accustomed to the dense  atmosphere of the place, I observed that the room was full of people,  dancing in couples with a peculiar slow-waltz step. The ladies stayed  in their places while the men made the rounds of the hall. After a few  turns with a lady, they shuffled along to the next one, continually  exchanging their partners. As the dancers passed me by, one after  another, they noticed me, and many among them scowled and looked angry  and displeased. Suddenly the drum stopped for a few minutes. Then it  began in a faster tempo. Now the men remained stationary, while the  ladies made the circuit of the room and each one in her turn passed in  front of me. They looked lovely in their costumes of finely embroidered  snow-white single garments, trimmed with many silver ornaments and  trinkets and in their short calico skirts and beautiful moccasins.  Their limbs were tastefully swathed in white buckskin leggins, which  completed the costume.    Faster and faster beat the drum, and the sobbing, rhythmic sound  thrilled my senses and filled my heart with an indescribable weird,  fierce longing. I saw a maiden approach taller and finer than the rest.  One glance of her soft, wild eyes and I flew to her arms. \"Back,  Indians!\" I shouted, \"honor your queen!\" and entered the lists of the  frolicsome dance. Wilder beat the drum and faster. As the old Indian  warmed to his work, he broke out in a doleful, monotonous song, the  words of which I did not understand. It sounded to me like this:      Anna-Hannah--    Anna-Hannah--    May-Ah!--    Anna-Hannah-Sarah-Wah!    Moolow-Hoolow, Ji-Hi-Tlack!    Anna-Hannah--    May-Ah-Ha!    So it went on indefinitely.    To lay this troubled spirit I tossed him a handful of coins, with the  unfortunate result that his guttural song became, if anything, more  loud and boisterous. I had no thought of exchanging my partner, as the  Aztec maiden clung to me. With closed eyes and parted lips she moved as  in a blissful dream. I have known Christian people become frantic under  the impetus of great religious excitement and I have seen them act very  strangely, also have I seen Indians similarly affected during their  medicine-ghost dances. Now I, who had not thought it possible of  myself, had become more savage and uncontrollable than any one. I  suppose it was the irritating, monotonous sound of the war drum that  did it, jarring my nerves, and the peculiar Indian odor in the stifling  hot air of the close room, enhanced by the exhilarating sensation of  threatening danger, and that in the presence of the adored sex.  Assuredly all this was more than enough to set me off, as I am  naturally impulsive and of a high-strung nervous temperament.    I must say that considering the modest costumes of these Indian ladies  and their bashful and shrinking disposition, it does seem strange that  they should fascinate one like myself of the Saxon race. To be sure the  sight of the bared shoulders and necks of society belles when undressed  in the decollete fashion of their ball gowns ravishes and gluts our  sensuality, but a momentary glimpse of the Indian maid's brown knee  flashing by during the excitement of the fandango is just as  suggestive, and the inch of hand-made embroidery on the edge of their  short skirts is as effective as priceless lace on gowns of worth. And  the Indian fashion has this to recommend it, that it is the less  expensive of the two costumes. Ever watchful, ever on the alert, I saw  the sheen of a knife flash from its scabbard in the hazy air, and my  beautiful partner shivered and moaned in my arms. \"Dog of an Indian,  dare and die,\" shouted I, angrily. Four times I made the circuit of the  room, and when again opposite the entrance of this man-kennel, I heard  the voice of my faithful friend, Don Reyes Alvarado, calling me  anxiously. I gave my lovely partner in charge of her tender-hearted  sisters, for the poor wild thing had fainted and lay limply in my arms.  The strong arm of my companion grasped me and drew me out into the  fresh air, where I almost collapsed, overcome.    \"Surely, amigo,\" said Reyes, \"you will not blame me now for not  entering, but you have endurance, for Dios! I should not have survived  so long. Thank God you came out alive! When I saw them pass in knives,  I had my doubts and momentarily expected to hear the report of your  revolver. But when I saw you pass by infatuated with Jtz-Li-Cama, the  cacique's daughter and wife of the murderous scoundrel, El Macho, then  I gave you up. Oh, see what is happening now. Amigo, you have broken up  the dance. So it seemed. The drum was silent now and we heard the  voices of men arguing in the Aztec idiom. Of a sudden the lights were  extinguished and the crowd came out with a rush, and silently they  stole away in the darkness.    \"Now, amigo,\" said Reyes, \"let me tell you something, which may haply  serve you well. Knowing that an American accomplishes things which a  Mexican like myself must let alone, I advise you to try for the hidden  treasure of La Gran Quivira. Seeing that you are in the good graces of  Jtz-Li-Cama, you might prevail with the cacique to guide you. He is  said to be the only living man who knows the secret of the trove in the  ruins of the sacred temple of the ancient city. The Indians believe  that this treasure, which the Aztecs hid from the Spaniards, is guarded  by a terrible phantom dog, the specter of one of the great dogs of  Fernando Cortez which ravened among their Aztec ancestors. They fear  the specter of this fabled Perro de la Malinche more than anything else  on earth, as it is said to harrow their souls in Hades as it ravened  their bodies when in the flesh.\"    After smoking a few cigarritos, my friend proposed to ride home, as  there was really nothing else to be done. We rode slowly along,  enjoying the beautiful night of this faultless climate, and I shall  ever remember this night to my last day. There was a pleasant,  refreshing odor in the air, the scent of the wild thyme which grows in  these sand dunes. The moon rose over the Manzana range and flooded the  broad valley with its soft, silvery rays. Suddenly, at a sharp turn of  the trail, we found ourselves surrounded by silent forms arisen from  the misty ground. \"Don Reyes Alvarado,\" spoke the voice of the Indian,  known as the macho, \"I have come for revenge and am now ready to wipe  out the insults you heaped on me when you charged me with the theft of  your calves. I challenge thee to fight. Alight from thy horse, cowardly  Spaniard! To-night of all nights shalt thou feel the Indians' blade  between thy ribs.\" \"Fight him, amigo,\" I said. \"I shall enforce fair  play.\" But my friend Reyes whom I knew to be a man of both strength and  courage, weakened, being cowed with the superstition of the unlucky  Noche Triste. \"Tomorrow I shall fight thee, Indian,\" he answered \"not  at nighttime, like a thieving coyote.\" \"If thou wert not astride thy  horse and out of my reach, thou wouldst not dare say that to me, thou  cuckold dupe of the Americans!\" sneered the Indian. This insult to my  companion angered me, and I demanded a retraction and an apology  therefor from the Indian. When the macho flatly refused and repeated  the insult in a more aggravating manner, I replied that I feared not to  meet him or any other goatherding Indian and was ready to fight him on  the spot.    Saying this, I dismounted and threw my horse's bridle to my friend  Reyes to hold. Then the cacique, or Pueblo chief, the father of  Jtz-Li-Cama, appeared and demanded our weapons. \"I shall not interfere  in this fight, senores,\" said he, \"if you surrender your weapons to me,  the lawful alguacil (officer) of this district.\" He then took the  macho's knife, and I gave him my revolver and stripped for the fray.    I advanced and scratched a circle of about twelve feet diameter in the  deep sand with my foot, then I stepped to the center of this ring and  awaited my antagonist. I cautioned my friend Reyes to see to it that no  one else overstepped the line. To the lonely sand dunes of the Rio  Grande unwittingly I thus introduced the manly sport of the prize ring.  But the battle was not fought for lucre or fame, nor according to the  London Prize Ring Rules; it was fought in defense of a friend's honor,  and the stake was life or death. The Indian made a rush for me, but I  avoided him and warded off his blows. I did not touch him till I saw my  chance, and then I tapped him under the chin which sent him sprawling.  He arose promptly and came for me in a rage, when I felled him with a  blow on the head. Again he came, and this time he gave me a stunning  blow in the face, which maddened me so, that I took the offensive and  laid him low with a terrific hit. I was now thoroughly infuriated and  threw all caution to the winds. When he arose once more, I attacked  him. He took to his heels and I followed him up. I noticed then that  the whole crowd of Indians were running after us, but I had now become  reckless and did not mind. Then I stumbled over a root and fell face  down in the sand. Before I could arise fully the macho had turned and  thrown himself upon me. I managed to turn over on my back and gripped  him by throat and face, so that he was really in my power, and I felt  that he was subdued so that I could easily force him under, and, small  wonder, for with the terrible grip of my hand had I once crushed a  man's fingers in a wrestling match. Now I used the macho's body as a  shield against the furious onslaught of his people, who attacked me  with rocks, clubs, and anything they could lay hands to."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43008"],[0,"Around the Yule Log (#10)"],[1," rest. Then came storms, and awful things upon the earth. A  many-headed monster roamed the village, seizing the children, throwing  them into a sack, and devouring them at its leisure. Giants descended  from the hills and robbed the lonely traveler. In Denmark a frightful  creature covered with a hairy robe was wont to creep into houses after  dark to steal the products of the harvest, and, if it found nothing,  would utter maledictions and threats, showing at the same time from  beneath its covering a black face and mouth full of fire.    As Christmas time draws near, and the sun turns northward once more,  Woden issues forth upon a white horse, and, followed by howling packs  of dogs, drives the evil spirits to their hiding-places in the  mountains. Sometimes in his wild hunt he sweeps through a house and  leaves behind him a dog, who crouches upon the hearth and stays there  for one year, whining, moaning, feeding on ashes, and snapping at all  who approach. On the next Christmas, Woden comes for him again, and  the dog leaps through the chimney to rejoin the howling pack in the  tree-tops.    To this day the Germans associate the coming of Christ with the return  of the sun, and the approach of spring. One of their poets sings:        \"The sun in winter is God in grief,      Is Christ who cometh to bring relief.      Beneath its blessed radiance, man      Forgets that his life is but a span.        \"The sun in winter is Christmastide,      Which scatters its blessings far and wide,      And sheds, through faith, o'er time's dark sea,      The morning rays of eternity.\"    \"That Christmas is a holiday of light and victory,\" begins Cassel, in  his account of the day,[1] \"every one who has lived within its  influence knows full well. This victory is more sure than the return  of spring, to which we look forward in December with such cheerful  hope. The Spirit of Truth dwells upon loftier heights than does the  creature, and its brightness chases away the shadows of many a gloomy  hour, darker than the longest night of midwinter.\"        [1] _Weihnachten: Ursprunge, Brauche und Aberglauben._--Cassel,           Leipzig.    And now the wonderful hour draws nigh. It is Christmas Eve. All nature  is hushed. As the shepherds once sat around their fire upon the plains  of Bethlehem, discussing, perchance, the strange portents attending  the birth of the son of Zacharias, so to-night the peasants in their  huts along the shores of the Baltic, or in the shadows of the Black  Forest, sit before the Yule log, and talk of the birth of the Son of  man. Suddenly the village bells toll for midnight. The sun appears  upon the horizon and leaps three times for joy; the birds throughout  the forest break forth into singing; every fir-tree blossoms into  fairest flower and fruitage, and is clothed once more in soft leaves,  in place of the sharp, spearpointed needles into which they were  condemned to shrink when a fir-tree was used for the Saviour's cross.  All the good people of the village are praying; and hark! the cattle,  upon their knees in the stable, are talking together in low tones. \"_A  child is bo-or-rn!_\" lows the cow. \"_True-e-e_,\" returns the ass.  \"_Where, where, where?_\" calls the shrill voice of the cock--and the  lambs answer, \"_In Be-e-t-t-'lem!_\" The horses alone have nothing to  say, and are upright on their feet; for when Christ was born, so the  story goes, the horses who happened to be near the manger stamped and  were rude, while the great, sweet-breathed oxen gazed upon the wee  Baby with their mild eyes, and, with the asses and lambs, knelt in  worship. For this hardness of heart horses are condemned to never have  their fill of grass, and to this day they feed eagerly in the fields,  but are never satisfied.    While these strange things are happening in the stables of the little  German village, the gnomes are busy in the mountains, throwing out  gold and precious treasures of the earth where men shall find them the  coming year.    When Christmas morning dawns, which in the northern countries is not  before nine or ten in the forenoon, the first loaves that come smoking  from the housewife's oven are given to the cattle. In Sweden it is the  custom to tie a sheaf of grain to a pole and set it up where the birds  may alight and take part in the joy and good cheer of the day. Before  long the village beggars are knocking at the door, and the humblest  peasant, remembering that it is the day on which God gave his  only-begotten Son to the world, dispenses with a free hand his gifts  to all that come.    Evergreen, and, in particular, the fir-tree, has been from the  earliest times associated with Christmas, and countless tales and  legends are perfumed with its spicy odors. Many are the German songs  that are full of its praises.        \"O northern fir, O northern fir,        In thee my heart delighteth,      How oft thy boughs at Christmastide      Have shed their blessings far and wide;--        In thee my heart delighteth.\"    Hans Christian Andersen, whose happiest hours were those spent in  writing pure and sweet fairytales for children, has told the story of  the fir-tree in his own gentle way. Here is one more child-song,  freely translated from Cassel's notes:        Within the wood a fir-tree stands,        So stately to be seen;      In summer, spring and winter, too,        Its cloak is ever green.        Its tiny needles, fine and sharp--        Some pointing up, some down--      The thistle-finch doth take, to sew        Her pretty yellow gown.        Through snow and ice the Christ-child sends        The good old Santa Klaus,      Who straightway hews the fir-tree down        And bears it to the house.        With loving hand, the Christ-child hangs        The nuts and apples there;      A taper small upon each twig,        And cakes and dainties rare.        Then comes the blessed Christmas night,        The bell is rung--and lo!      There stands the fir-tree, green and still,        Its branches all aglow.        Thou fir-tree in the forest dark,        Soon shalt thou hence be borne.      Rejoice! for then thy branches, too,        The Christ-child shall adorn.    In Scandinavia two fir boughs are nailed crosswise before the door on  Christmas day. Children go about the village, knocking at the windows  with fir twigs, and receiving gifts of sugar plums. The Alsatian  peasantry relate that the apostle to the people on the Rhine and  Moselle was the son of the widow of Nain. Long after his miraculous  resurrection he was sent westward by Saint Peter. One day he came to  the steep banks of the Rhine, and, stopping to rest, fell asleep from  weariness, in the shade of a fir-tree. On awaking, he found that his  pilgrim's staff had grown into the trunk of the fir, and thus plainly  indicated that he had reached the appointed end of his journey.    In England, the same veneration seems to have been bestowed, time out  of mind, upon the holly. Its glossy, pointed leaves symbolize the  crown of thorns, and the berries the crimson blood-drops that gathered  upon the Saviour's brow. Like the fir, it is ever green and full of  life--as the love of Christ to mankind. Indeed this almost instinctive  association of green boughs and all bright, growing things with the  joy and beauty of religious life, extends throughout written history.  The Israelites in the desert were taught (if they had not already  adopted a custom which was thus merely confirmed and sanctified) to  \"take the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the  boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice  before the Lord your God seven days\" (Leviticus 23: 40).    So, too, the wreaths of green leaves attributed to the Greek and Roman  deities, and awarded to those who seemed most godlike, in peace or  war. When Christ entered Jerusalem, the fittest expressions of the  joy, the thanksgiving and the reverent worship of the multitude were  the palm branches, strewn in the path of him who was victorious over  Evil, and who--not conquered death, but showed him to be only the  angel of Life, with the shadowy side of his face turned towards us, as  he comes between us and the Everlasting Light.    In the early days of England the Druids were accustomed to go forth at  Christmas and gather the sacred mistletoe; while even the poor and  humbler folk brought evergreen and hung it up in their cottages, that  the gentle spirits of the forest might dwell there in safety till the  sun should shine again. In these modern days it has become the fashion  to use evergreens more and more generously. The two largest of the  Boston markets are surrounded, for a week preceding Christmas day,  with a spicy forest of spruce and fir-trees, while the sidewalks are  half hidden beneath great fragrant heaps of \"princess pine\" and  \"creeping Jenny,\" in the form of wreaths, crosses and trimming. Holly,  too, is used in larger quantities every year, and altogether the times  seem to be returning, which dear old Sir Walter longed for when he  sung:        Heap on more wood!--the wind is chill      But let it whistle as it will,      We'll keep our Christmas merry still.      Each age has deemed the new-born year      The fittest time for festal cheer.      And well our Christian sires of old      Loved when the year its course had rolled,      And brought blithe Christmas back again,      With all its hospitable train.      Domestic and religious rite      Gave honor to the holy night;      On Christmas eve the bells were rung;      On Christmas eve the mass was sung;      That only night in all the year,      Saw the stoled priest the chalice rear.        The damsel donned her kirtle sheen;      The hall was dressed with holly green;      Forth to the wood did merry men go,      To gather in the mistletoe.      Then opened wide the baron's hall      To vassal, tenant, serf, and all;      Power laid his rod of rule aside,  "]]]
