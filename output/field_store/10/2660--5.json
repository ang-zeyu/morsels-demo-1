To those who say that our expenditures for public works and other  means for recovery are a waste that we cannot afford, I answer that  no country, however rich, can afford the waste of its human  resources.  Demoralization caused by vast unemployment is our  greatest extravagance.  Morally, it is the greatest menace to our  social order.  Some people try to tell me that we must make up our  minds that for the future we shall permanently have millions of  unemployed just as other countries have had them for over a decade.  What may be necessary for those countries is not my responsibility  to determine.  But as for this country, I stand or fall by my  refusal to accept as a necessary condition of our future a  permanent army of unemployed.  On the contrary, we must make it a  national principle that we will not tolerate a large army of  unemployed and that we will arrange our national economy to end our  present unemployment as soon as we can and then to take wise  measures against its return.  I do not want to think that it is the  destiny of any American to remain permanently on relief rolls.    Those, fortunately few in number, who are frightened by boldness  and cowed by the necessity for making decisions, complain that all  we have done is unnecessary and subject to great risks.  Now that  these people are coming out of their storm cellars, they forget  that there ever was a storm.  They point to England.  They would have  you believe that England has made progress out of her depression by  a do-nothing policy, by letting nature take her course.  England has  her peculiarities and we have ours but I do not believe any  intelligent observer can accuse England of undue orthodoxy in the  present emergency.    Did England let nature take her course?  No.  Did England hold to the  gold standard when her reserves were threatened?  No.  Has England  gone back to the gold standard today?  No.  Did England hesitate to  call in ten billion dollars of her war bonds bearing 5 percent  interest, to issue new bonds therefore bearing only 3-1/2 percent  interest, thereby saving the British treasury one hundred and fifty  million dollars a year in interest alone?  No.  And let it be  recorded that the British bankers helped.  Is it not a fact that  ever since the year 1909, Great Britain in many ways has advanced  further along lines of social security than the United States?  Is  it not a fact that relations between capital and labor on the basis  of collective bargaining are much further advanced in Great Britain  than in the United States?  It is perhaps not strange that the  conservative British press has told us with pardonable irony that  much of our New Deal program is only an attempt to catch up with  English reforms that go back ten years or more.    Nearly all Americans are sensible and calm people.  We do not get  greatly excited nor is our peace of mind disturbed, whether we be  businessmen or workers or farmers, by awesome pronouncements  concerning the unconstitutionality of some of our measures of  recovery and relief and reform.  We are not frightened by  reactionary lawyers or political editors.  All of these cries have  been heard before.  More than twenty years ago, when Theodore  Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson were attempting to correct abuses in  our national life, the great Chief Justice White said:    \"There is great danger it seems to me to arise from the constant  habit which prevails where anything is opposed or objected to, of  referring without rhyme or reason to the Constitution as a means of  preventing its accomplishment, thus creating the general impression  that the Constitution is but a barrier to progress instead of being  the broad highway through which alone true progress may be  enjoyed.\"    In our efforts for recovery we have avoided on the one hand the  theory that business should and must be taken over into an all-  embracing government.  We have avoided on the other hand the equally  untenable theory that it is an interference with liberty to offer  reasonable help when private enterprise is in need of help.  The  course we have followed fits the American practice of government--a  practice of taking action step by step, of regulating only to meet  concrete needs--a practice of courageous recognition of change.  I  believe with Abraham Lincoln, that \"The legitimate object of  government is to do for a community of people whatever they need to  have done but cannot do at all or cannot do so well for themselves  in their separate and individual capacities.\"    I am not for a return to that definition of liberty under which for  many years a free people were being gradually regimented into the  service of the privileged few.  I prefer and I am sure you prefer  that broader definition of liberty under which we are moving  forward to greater freedom, to greater security for the average man  than he has ever known before in the history of America.        April 28, 1935.      Since my annual message to the Congress on January fourth, last, I  have not addressed the general public over the air.  In the many  weeks since that time the Congress has devoted itself to the  arduous task of formulating legislation necessary to the country's  welfare.  It has made and is making distinct progress.    Before I come to any of the specific measures, however, I want to  leave in your minds one clear fact.  The administration and the  Congress are not proceeding in any haphazard fashion in this task  of government.  Each of our steps has a definite relationship to  every other step.  The job of creating a program for the nation's  welfare is, in some respects, like the building of a ship.  At  different points on the coast where I often visit they build great  seagoing ships.  When one of these ships is under construction and  the steel frames have been set in the keel, it is difficult for a  person who does not know ships to tell how it will finally look  when it is sailing the high seas.    It may seem confused to some, but out of the multitude of detailed  parts that go into the making of the structure the creation of a  useful instrument for man ultimately comes.  It is that way with the  making of a national policy.  The objective of the nation has  greatly changed in three years.  Before that time individual self-  interest and group selfishness were paramount in public thinking.  The general good was at a discount.    Three years of hard thinking have changed the picture.  More and  more people, because of clearer thinking and a better  understanding, are considering the whole rather than a mere part  relating to one section or to one crop, or to one industry, or to  an individual private occupation.  That is a tremendous gain for the  principles of democracy.  The overwhelming majority of people in  this country know how to sift the wheat from the chaff in what they  hear and what they read.  They know that the process of the  constructive rebuilding of America cannot be done in a day or a  year, but that it is being done in spite of the few who seek to  confuse them and to profit by their confusion.  Americans as a whole  are feeling a lot better--a lot more cheerful than for many, many  years.    The most difficult place in the world to get a clear open  perspective of the country as a whole is Washington.  I am reminded  sometimes of what President Wilson once said:  \"So many people come  to Washington who know things that are not so, and so few people  who know anything about what the people of the United States are  thinking about.\"  That is why I occasionally leave this scene of  action for a few days to go fishing or back home to Hyde Park, so  that I can have a chance to think quietly about the country as a  whole.  \"To get away from the trees\", as they say, \"and to look at  the whole forest.\"  This duty of seeing the country in a long-range  perspective is one which, in a very special manner, attaches to  this office to which you have chosen me.  Did you ever stop to think  that there are, after all, only two positions in the nation that  are filled by the vote of all of the voters--the President and the  Vice-President?  That makes it particularly necessary for the Vice-  President and for me to conceive of our duty toward the entire  country.  I speak, therefore, tonight, to and of the American people  as a whole.    My most immediate concern is in carrying out the purposes of the  great work program just enacted by the Congress.  Its first  objective is to put men and women now on the relief rolls to work  and, incidentally, to assist materially in our already unmistakable  march toward recovery.  I shall not confuse my discussion by a  multitude of figures.  So many figures are quoted to prove so many  things.  Sometimes it depends upon what paper you read and what  broadcast you hear.  Therefore, let us keep our minds on two or  three simple, essential facts in connection with this problem of  unemployment.  It is true that while business and industry are  definitely better our relief rolls are still too large.  However,  for the first time in five years the relief rolls have declined  instead of increased during the winter months.  They are still  declining.  The simple fact is that many million more people have  private work today than two years ago today or one year ago today,  and every day that passes offers more chances to work for those who  want to work.  In spite of the fact that unemployment remains a  serious problem here as in every other nation, we have come to  recognize the possibility and the necessity of certain helpful  remedial measures.  These measures are of two kinds.  The first is to  make provisions intended to relieve, to minimize, and to prevent  future unemployment; the second is to establish the practical means  to help"]]]
