May I be in the favour of the king until the day shall come of my death.    _(This is finished from beginning to end, as was found in the writing.)_          Remarks      The Adventures of Sanehat appears to have been a popular tale, as  portions of three copies remain. The first papyrus known (Berlin No.  1) was imperfect at the beginning; but since then a flake of limestone  found in a tomb bore the beginning of the tale, and the same part is  found on a papyrus in the Amherst collection. The main text has been  translated by Chabas (\"Le papyrus de Berlin,\" 37-51), Goodwin, and  Maspero (\"Mel. d'arch.,\" iii. 68, 140, and \"Contes Populaire,\"  89-130); while the beginning is treated in \"Memoires de l'institut  Egyptien,\" ii. 1-23, and in Proc. S.B.A., 452. The present translation  is mainly based on Mr. Griffith's readings in all cases of difficulty.    This is perhaps the most interesting of all the tales, because it bears  such signs of being written in the times of which it treats, it throws  so much light on the life of the time in Egypt and Syria, and if not a  real narrative, it is at least so probable that it may be accepted  without much difficulty. For my own part, I incline to look on it as  strictly historical; and in the absence of a single point of doubt, I  shall here treat it as seriously as the biographical inscriptions of  the early tombs. Possibly some day the tomb of Sanehat may be found,  and the whole inscription be read complete upon the walls.    The name Sa-nehat means \"son of the sycamore,\" probably from his having  been born, or living, at some place where was a celebrated sacred  sycamore. This was a common tree in ancient, as in modern, Egypt; but an  allusion in the tale, to Sanehat turning his back on the sycamore, when  he was fleeing apparently up the west side of the Delta, makes it  probable that the sycamore was that of Aa-tenen, now Batnun, at the  middle of the west side of the Delta.    The titles given to Sanehat at the opening are of a very high rank, and  imply that he was the son either of the king or of a great noble. And  his position in the queen's household shows him to have been of  importance; the manner in which he is received by the royal family at  the end implying that he was quite familiar with them in early days.    But the great difficulty in the account has been the sudden panic of  Sanehat on hearing of the death of Amenemhat, and no explanation of this  has yet been brought forward. It seems not unlikely that he was a son of  Amenemhat by some concubine. This would at once account for his high  titles--for his belonging to the royal household--for his fear of his  elder brother Usertesen, who might see in him a rival, and try to slay  him after his father's death--for the command to him to leave all his  possessions and family behind him in Syria, as the condition of his  being allowed to return to end his days in Egypt--for his familiar  reception by the royal family, and for the property given to him on his  return.    The date recorded for the death of Sehote-pabra--Amenemhat I., the  founder of the XIIth Dynasty--agrees with the limit of his reign on the  monuments. And the expressions for his death are valuable as showing  the manner in which a king's decease was regarded; under the emblem of  a hawk--the bird of Ra--he flew up and joined the sun.    Sometime before his death Amenemhat had been in retirement; after twenty  years of reign (which was probably rather late in his life, as he seems  to have forced his way to the front as a successful man and founder of a  family) he had associated his son, the first Usertesen, on the throne,  and apparently resigned active life; for in the third year of Usertesen  we find the coregent summoning his court and decreeing the founding of  the temple of Heliopolis without any mention of his father. The old  king, however, lived yet ten years after his retirement, and died (as  this narrative shows us) during an expedition of his son Usertesen.    The time of year mentioned here would fall in about the middle of the  inundation in those days. Hence it seems that the military expeditions  were made after the harvest was secured, and while the country was  under water and the population disengaged from other labour.    The course of Sanehat's flight southward, reaching the Nile at Cairo  after two days' haste, indicates that the army was somewhere west of the  Delta. This would point to its being on the road to the oasis of the  Natron Lakes, which would be the natural course for a body of men  needing water supply. His throwing himself between two bushes to hide  from the army shows that the message came early in the day, otherwise he  would have fled in the dark. He then fled a day's journey to the south,  turning his back on the sycamore, and slept in the open field at  Shi-Seneferu somewhere below the Barrage. The second day he reached the  Nile opposite Old Cairo in the afternoon, and ferried himself over,  passed the quarries at Gebel Mokattam, and the red hill of Gebel Ahmar,  and came to a frontier wall before dark. This cannot have been far from  Old Cairo, by the time; and as Heliopolis was in course of building by  Usertesen, it would be probably on the desert near there, for the  protection of the town.  Passing the desert guards by night he pushed  on and reached Peten, near Belbeis, by dawn, and turned east toward  the valley of Kemur, or Wady Tumilat. Here in his extremity he was  found by the Sati or Asiatics, and rescued. This shows that the  eastern desert was left to the wandering tribes, and was without any  regular government at this period; though all the eastern Delta was  already well in Egyptian hands, as we know by the monuments at  Bubastis, Dedamun, and Tanis.    The land of Adim to which Sanehat fled appears to be the same as Edom or  the southeast corner of Syria. It was evidently near the upper Tenu, or  Rutennu, who seem to have dwelt on the hill country of Palestine. The  hill and the plain of Palestine are so markedly different, that in all  ages they have tended to be held by opposing people. In the time of  Sanehat the upper Tenu who held the hills were opposed to the Tenu in  general who held the plains; later on the Semites of the hills opposed  the Philistines of the plain, and now the _fellah_ of the hills  opposes the Bedawi of the plain. The district of Amuanshi in which  Sanehat settled was a goodly land, bearing figs and grapes and olives,  flowing with wine and honey and oil, yielding barley and wheat without  end, and much cattle. This abundance points rather to the hill country  near Hebron or between there and Belt Jibrin, as this south part of  the hills is notably fertile. The Tenu who came to defy Sanehat, being  in opposition to the upper Tenu, were probably those of the plain; and  the opposition to Sanehat may have arisen from his encroaching on the  fertile plain at the foot of his hills, as he was in the best of the  land \"on the border of the next land.\"    The Egyptian was evidently looked on as being of a superior race by the  Tenu, and his civilisation won for him the confidence which many  wandering Englishmen now find in Africa or Polynesia, like John Dunn.  The set combat of two champions seems--by the large gathering--to have  been a well-recognised custom among the Tenu, while it exactly accords  with Goliath's offer in later times. And raising the shout of victory  on the back of the fallen champion reminds us of David's standing on  Goliath.    The transition from the recital of the Syrian adventures to the petition  to Pharaoh is not marked in the manuscript; but from the construction  the beginning of the petition is evidently at the place here marked. The  manner in which Sanehat appeals to the queen shows how well he must have  been known to her in his former days.    The decree in reply to Sanehat is in the regular style of royal  decrees of the period. Apparently by a clerical error the scribe has  substituted the name Amenemhat for Userte-sen, but the Horus name and  the throne name leave no doubt that Usertesen I. is intended here. The  tone of the reply is as gracious as possible, according with the  king's character as stated by Sanehat, \"He is a friend of great  sweetness, and knows how to gain love.\" He quite recognises the  inquiries after the queen, and replies concerning her. And then he  assures Sanehat of welcome on his return, and promises him all that he  asks, including a tomb \"in the company of the royal children,\" a full  recognition of his real rank.  Incidentally we learn that the Amu  buried their dead wrapped in a sheep's skin; as we also learn, further  on, that they anointed themselves with oil (olive?), wore the hair  long, and slept on the ground.    The funeral that is promised accords with the burials of the XIIth  Dynasty: the gilded case, the head painted blue, and the canopy of  cypress wood, are all known of this period, but would be out of place in  describing a Ramesside burial.    Sanehat's reply is a full course of the usual religious adulation, and  differs in this remarkably from his petition.  In fact it is hard to  be certain where his petition begins; possibly the opening of it has  been lost out of the text in copying from a mutilated papyrus; or  possibly it was sent merely as a memorandum of Sanehat's position and  desires, without venturing to address it personally to the king; or  even it may have not been allowable then to make such petitions  formally, so as to leave the initiative to the king's free will, just  as it is not allowable nowadays to question royalty, but only to  answer when spoken to.    The proposal to bring forward his fellow-sheikhs as witnesses of his  unabated loyalty is very curious, and seems superfluous after  Usertesen's assurances. Beyond Abisha of the Amu at Beni Hasan, these  are the only early personal names of Syrians that we know. The Fenkhu in  this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7401"],[0,"A Crystal Age (#10)"],[1,"rs, we come to the wilderness of Coradine, which seems  barren and desolate to our sight, accustomed to the deep verdure of  woods and valleys, and the blue mists of an abundant moisture. There a  stony soil brings forth only thorns, and thistles, and sere tufts of  grass; and blustering winds rush over the unsheltered reaches, where the  rough-haired goats huddle for warmth; and there is no melody save the  many-toned voices of the wind and the plover's wild cry. There dwell the  children of Coradine, on the threshold of the wind-vexed wilderness,  where the stupendous columns of green glass uphold the roof of the House  of Coradine; the ocean's voice is in their rooms, and the inland-blowing  wind brings to them the salt spray and yellow sand swept at low tide  from the desolate floors of the sea, and the white-winged bird flying  from the black tempest screams aloud in their shadowy halls. There, from  the high terraces, when the moon is at its full, we see the children of  Coradine gathered together, arrayed like no others, in shining garments  of gossamer threads, when, like thistle-down chased by eddying winds,  now whirling in a cloud, now scattering far apart, they dance their  moonlight dances on the wide alabaster floors; and coming and going they  pass away, and seem to melt into the moonlight, yet ever to return again  with changeful melody and new measures. And, seeing this, all those  things in which we ourselves excel seem poor in comparison, becoming  pale in our memories. For the winds and waves, and the whiteness and  grace, has been ever with them; and the winged seed of the thistle, and  the flight of the gull, and the storm-vexed sea, flowering in foam, and  the light of the moon on sea and barren land, have taught them this art,  and a swiftness and grace which they alone possess.    \"Yet does this moonlight dance, which is the chief glory of the House of  Coradine, grow pale in the mind, and is speedily forgotten, when another  is seen; and, going on our way from house to house, we learn how  everywhere the various riches of the world have been taken into his soul  by man, and made part of his life. Nor are we inferior to others, having  also an art and chief excellence which is ours only, and the fame of  which has long gone forth into the world; so that from many distant  lands pilgrims gather yearly to our fields to listen to our harvest  melody, when the sun-ripened fruits have been garnered, and our lips and  hands make undying music, to gladden the hearts of those that hear it  all their lives long. For then do we rejoice beyond others, rising like  bright-winged insects from our lowly state to a higher life of glory and  joy, which is ours for the space of three whole days. Then the august  Mother, in a brazen chariot, is drawn from field to field by milk-white  bulls with golden horns; then her children are gathered about her in  shining yellow garments, with armlets of gold upon their arms; and with  voice and instruments of forms unknown to the stranger, they make glad  the listening fields with the great harvest melody.    \"In ancient days the children of our house conceived it in their hearts,  hearing it in all nature's voices; and it was with them day and night,  and they whispered it to one another when it was no louder than the  whisper of the wind in the forest leaves; and as the Builder of the  world brings from an hundred far places the mist, and the dew, and the  sunshine, and the light west wind, to give to the morning hour its  freshness and glory; and as we, his humbler followers, seek far off in  caverns of the hills and in the dark bowels of the earth for minerals  and dyes that outshine the flowers and the sun, to beautify the walls of  our house, so everywhere by night and day for long centuries did we  listen to all sounds, and made their mystery and melody ours, until this  great song was perfected in our hearts, and the fame of it in all lands  has caused our house to be called the House of the Harvest Melody; and  when the yearly pilgrims behold our procession in the fields, and listen  to our song, all the glory of the world seems to pass before them,  overcoming their hearts, until, bursting into tears and loud cries, they  cast themselves upon the earth and worship the Father of the whole  world.    \"This shall be the chief glory of our house for ever; when a thousand  years have gone by, and we that are now living, like those that have  been, are mingled with the nature we come from, and speak to our  children only in the wind's voice, and the cry of the passage-bird,  pilgrims shall still come to these sun-bright fields, to rejoice, and  worship the Father of the world, and bless the august Mother of the  house, from whose sacred womb ever comes to it life and love and joy,  and the harvest melody that shall endure for ever.\"              Chapter 6    The reading went on, not of course \"for ever,\" like that harvest melody  he spoke of, but for a considerable time. The words, I concluded, were  for the initiated, and not for me, and after a while I gave up trying to  make out what it was all about. Those last expressions I have quoted  about the \"august Mother of the house\" were unintelligible, and appeared  to me meaningless. I had already come to the conclusion that however  many of the ladies of the establishment might have experienced the  pleasures and pains of maternity, there was really no mother of the  house in the sense that there was a father of the house: that is to say,  one possessing authority over the others and calling them all her  children indiscriminately. Yet this mysterious non-existent mother of  the house was continually being spoken of, as I found now and afterwards  when I listened to the talk around me. After thinking the matter over, I  came to the conclusion that \"mother of the house\" was merely a  convenient fiction, and simply stood for the general sense of the  women-folk, or something of the sort. It was perhaps stupid of me, but  the story of Mistrelde, who died young, leaving only eight children, I  had regarded as a mere legend or fable of antiquity.    To return to the reading. Just as I had been absorbed before in that  beautiful book without being able to read it, so now I listened to that  melodious and majestic voice, experiencing a singular pleasure without  properly understanding the sense. I remembered now with a painful  feeling of inferiority that my _thick_ speech had been remarked On  earlier in the day; and I could not but think that, compared with the  speech of this people, it was thick. In their rare physical beauty, the  color of their eyes and hair, and in their fascinating dress, they had  struck me as being utterly unlike any people ever seen by me. But it was  perhaps in their clear, sweet, penetrative voice, which sometimes  reminded me of a tender-toned wind instrument, that they most differed  from others.    The reading, I have said, had struck me as almost of the nature of a  religious service; nevertheless, everything went on as before--reading,  working, and occasional conversation; but the subdued talking and moving  about did not interfere with one's pleasure in the old man's musical  speech any more than the soft murmur and flying about of honey bees  would prevent one from enjoying the singing of a skylark. Emboldened by  what I saw the others doing, I left my seat and made my way across the  floor to Yoletta's side, stealing through the gloom with great caution  to avoid making a clatter with those abominable boots.    \"May I sit down near you?\" said I with some hesitation; but she  encouraged me with a smile and placed a cushion for me.    I settled myself down in the most graceful position I could assume,  which was not at all graceful, doubling my objectionable legs out of her  sight; and then began my trouble, for I was greatly perplexed to know  what to say to her. I thought of lawn-tennis and archery. Ellen Terry's  acting, the Royal Academy Exhibition, private theatricals, and twenty  things besides, but they all seemed unsuitable subjects to start  conversation with in this case. There was, I began to fear, no common  ground on which we could meet and exchange thoughts, or, at any rate,  words. Then I remembered that ground, common and broad enough, of our  human feelings, especially the sweet and important feeling of love. But  how was I to lead up to it? The work she was engaged with at length  suggested an opening, and the opportunity to make a pretty little  speech.    \"Your sight must be as good as your eyes are pretty,\" said I, \"to enable  you to work in such a dim light.\"    \"Oh, the light is good enough,\" she answered, taking no notice of the  compliment. \"Besides, this is such easy work I could do it in the dark.\"    \"It is very pretty work--may I look at it?\"    She handed the stuff to me, but instead of taking it in the ordinary  way, I placed my hand under hers, and, holding up cloth and hand  together, proceeded to give a minute and prolonged scrutiny to her work.    \"Do you know that I am enjoying two distinct pleasures at one and the  same time?\" said I. \"One is in seeing your work, the other in holding  your hand; and I think the last pleasure even greater than the first.\"  As she made no reply, I added somewhat lamely: \"May I--keep on holding  it?\"    \"That would prevent me from working,\" she answered, with the utmost  gravity. \"But you may hold it for a little while.\"    \"Oh, thank you,\" I exclaimed, delighted with the privilege; and then, to  make the most of my precious \"little while,\" I pressed it warmly,  whereupon she cried out aloud: \"Oh, Smith, you are squeezing too  hard--you hurt my hand!\"    I dropped it instantly in the greatest confusion. \"Oh, for goodness  sake,\" I stammered, \"please, do not make such an outcry! You don't know  what a hobble you'll get me into.\"    Fortunately, no notice was taken of the exclamation, though it was hard  to"]]]
