She spun round like a top;  and as she got her bearing again, sent one of her formidable missiles into  her huge opponent.    \"The officers of the _Monitor_ at this time had gained such confidence in  the impregnability of their battery that they no longer fired at random  nor hastily. The fight then assumed its most interesting aspect. The  _Monitor_ went round the _Merrimac_ repeatedly, probing her sides, seeking  for weak points, and reserving her fire with coolness, until she had the  right spot and the right range, and made her experiments accordingly. In  this way the _Merrimac_ received three shots.... Neither of these three  shots rebounded at all, but appeared to cut their way clear through iron  and wood into the ship.\"(21) Soon after receiving the third shot, the  _Merrimac_ made off at full speed, and the contest was not renewed. Thus  ended this particular episode of the American war.         [Illustration: ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN THE \"MERRIMAC\" AND \"MONITOR.\"]    Lieutenant Worden was in the pilot-house of the _Monitor_ when the  _Merrimac_ directed a whole broadside at her, and was, besides being  thrown down and stunned by the concussion, temporarily blinded by the  minute fragments of shells and powder driven through the eye-holes--only an  inch each in diameter--made through the iron to enable them to keep a  look-out. He was carried away, but, on recovering consciousness, his first  thoughts reverted to the action. \"Have I saved the _Minnesota_?\" said he,  eagerly. \"Yes; and whipped the _Merrimac_!\" was the answer. \"Then,\"  replied he, \"I don't care what becomes of me.\" The concussion in the  turret is described as something terrible; and several of the men, though  not otherwise hurt, were rendered insensible for the time. Each side  claimed that they had seriously damaged the other, but there seems to have  been no foundation for these assertions in facts.    But although this, the original _Monitor_, was efficient, if not  omnipotent, in the calm waters at the mouth of the James River, she was,  as might be expected with her flat, barge-like bottom, a bad sea-boat, and  was afterwards lost. Her ports had to be closed and caulked, being only  five feet above the water, and she was therefore unable to work her guns  at sea. Her constructor had neglected Sir Walter Raleigh's advice to  Prince Henry touching the model of a ship, \"that her ports be so laid, as  that she may carry out her guns all weathers.\" She plunged  heavily--completely submerging her pilot-house at times, the sea washing  over and into her turret. The heavy shocks and jars of the armour, as it  came down upon the waves, made her leaky, and she went to the bottom in  spite of pumps capable of throwing 2,000 gallons a minute, which were in  good order and working incessantly.      [Illustration: THE PERUVIAN IRONCLAD _HUASCAR_ ATTACKED BY TWO CHILIAN                                 IRONCLADS.]    Since the conclusion of the American war, the ironclad question has  assumed serious aspects, and many facts could be cited to show that they  have not by any means always confirmed the first impressions of their  strength and invulnerability. Two recent cases will be fresh in the  memories of our readers. The first is the recent engagement off Peru  between the Peruvian ironclad turret-ship _Huascar_ and the British  unarmoured men-of-war _Shah_ and _Amethyst_. With the political aspect of  the affair we have nothing, of course, to do, in our present work. It was  really a question between the guns quite as much as between the vessels.  The _Huascar_ is only a moderately-strong armoured vessel, her plates  being the same thickness as those of the earliest English ironclad, the  _Warrior_, and her armament is two 300-pounders in her turret, and three  shell-guns. On the other hand, the _Shah_, the principal one of the two  British vessels, is only a large iron vessel sheathed in wood, and not  armoured at all; but she carries, besides smaller guns, a formidable  armament in the shape of two 12-ton and sixteen 61/2-ton guns. An eyewitness  of the engagement states(22) that, after three hours' firing, at a  distance of from 400 to 3,000 yards, the only damage inflicted by the  opposing vessels was a hole in the _Huascar's_ side, made by a shell, the  bursting of which killed one man. \"One 9-in. shot (from a 12-ton gun) also  penetrated three inches into the turret without effecting any material  damage. There were nearly 100 dents of various depths in the plates, but  none of sufficient depth to materially injure them. The upper works--boats,  and everything destructible by shell--were, of course, destroyed. Her  colours were also shot down.\" According to theory, the _Shah's_ two larger  guns should have penetrated the _Huascar's_ sides when fired at upwards of  3,000 yards' distance. The facts are very different, doubtless because the  shots struck the armour obliquely, at any angles but right ones. The  _Huascar_ was admirably handled and manoeuvred, but her gunnery was so  indifferent that none of the shots even struck the _Shah_, except to cut  away a couple of ropes, and the latter kept up so hot a fire of shells  that the crew of the former were completely demoralised, and the officers  had to train and fire the guns. She eventually escaped to Iquique, under  cover of a pitchy-dark night. The same correspondent admits, however, that  the _Shah_, although a magnificent vessel, is not fitted for the South  American station, since Peru has three ironclads, Chili two, and Brazil  and the River Plate Republics several, against which no ordinary English  man-of-war could cope, were the former properly handled.                 [Illustration: THE PERUVIAN IRONCLAD _HUASCAR_.]    The recent story of the saucy Russian merchantman,(23) which not merely  dared the Turkish ironclad, but fought her for five hours, and inflicted  quite as much damage as she received, will also be remembered, although it  may be taken just for what it is worth. One Captain Baranoff, of the  Imperial Russian Navy, had, in an article published in the _Golos_, of St.  Petersburg, recommended his Government to abandon ironclads, avoid naval  battles, and confine operations at sea to the letting loose of a number of  cruisers against the enemy's merchantmen. Where a naval engagement was  inevitable, he \"preferred fighting with small craft, making up by agility  and speed what they lacked in cuirass, and if the worst came to the worst,  easily replaced by other specimens of the same type.\" The article created  much notice; and at the beginning of the present war, the author was given  to understand by the Russian Admiralty that he should have an opportunity  of proving his theories by deeds. The _Vesta_, an ordinary iron steamer of  light build, was selected; she had been employed previously in no more  warlike functions than the conveyance of corn and tallow from Russia to  foreign ports. She was equipped immediately with a few 6-in. mortars, her  decks being strengthened to receive them, but no other changes were made.  On the morning of the 23rd of July, cruising in the Black Sea, Captain  Baranoff encountered the Turkish ironclad _Assari Tefvik_, a formidable  vessel armoured with twelve inches of iron, and carrying 12-ton guns, and  nothing daunted by the disproportion in size and strength, immediately  engaged her. Both vessels were skilfully manoeuvred, the ironclad moving  about with extraordinary alertness and speed. She was only hit three times  with large balls; the second went through her deck, \"kindling a fire which  was quickly extinguished;\" the third was believed to have injured the  turret. Meantime, the _Vesta_ was herself badly injured, a grenade hitting  her close to the powder-magazine, which would have soon blown up but for  the rapid measures taken by her commander. Her rudder was struck and  partially disabled, but still she was not sunk, as she should have been,  according to all theoretical considerations. She eventually steamed back  again to Sebastopol--after two other vessels had come to the ironclad's  assistance--covered with glory, having for five hours worried, and somewhat  injured, a giant vessel to which, in proportion, she was but a weak and  miserable dwarf.    It will be obvious that from neither of the above cases can any positive  inferences be safely drawn. In the former case, the weaker vessel had the  stronger guns, and so matters were partially balanced; in the second  example, the ironclad ought to have easily sunk the merchantman by means  of her heavy guns, even from a great distance--but she didn't. The ironclad  question will engage our attention again, as it will, we fear, that of the  nation, for a very long time to come.

Linn. Soc.       London, 13:75, type from Jamaica.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Tropical region of southern       part of state.    The specimens from northwest of El Encino were shot deep (250 yards) in  a cave; specimens of _Myotis nigricans_ were obtained in the same cave.  A female taken on May 24 carried a single embryo that was 43 mm. in  crown-rump length. Six March-taken females reported by de la Torre  (1954:114) had one embryo each that varied from 20 to 38 mm. in length.    _Artibeus jamaicensis_ and _A. lituratus_ are the largest bats known  from Tamaulipas. In addition to the differences between the two species  pointed out by Lukens and Davis (1957:9), I note, in Tamaulipas at  least, that the postorbital constriction is narrower in relation to the  condylobasal length in _lituratus_, 24.6 (23.7-26.0) per cent as  compared to 27.9 (26.7-29.9) per cent in _jamaicensis_.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 19: 10 km.

Mus., 99:447, May 10.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Tropical region in southern       part of state.    Two specimens from the Rio Sabinas were taken in a mist net placed  across the small, crevicelike entrance to a cave. Ten pregnant females  taken in late May each contained a single embryo; average crown-rump  length of the 10 embryos was 43 (35-55) mm.    Tamaulipan specimens of _lituratus_ do not differ appreciably in color  from topotypes except that the facial stripes are narrow and, in three  individuals, poorly marked. Lukens and Davis (1957:9) reported that  females from Guerrero were paler than the males, but the male examined  in this study does not differ in color from the females seen.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 15: Rancho       Pano Ayuctle, 6 mi.

Zool.,       Paris, ser. 2, 12:427, October, type from Mexico. Type       locality restricted to Mirador, Veracruz, by Hershkovitz,       Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., 99:449, May 10, 1949.         1908. _Artibeus toltecus_, Andersen, Proc. Zool. Soc.       London, p. 296, April 7.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Probably lowlands of southern       part of state; known presently only from Rancho Pano       Ayuctle.    _Artibeus toltecus_ is closely related to another species, _A.  aztecus_, that occurs also in Tamaulipas. Externally, _toltecus_  differs from _aztecus_ in being smaller and darker; cranially,  _toltecus_ also is the smaller and the P2 and M2 are more angular  lingually than in _aztecus_, in which the teeth are rounded. One of the  most important differences between these two species is that they occur  at different altitudes. Davis (1958:165) reported that _toltecus_  occurred at elevations below 5000 feet at more southerly localities in  Mexico, whereas _aztecus_ occurred above 5000 feet. In Tamaulipas the  two species probably have parallel distributions from south to north  but _A. toltecus_ is known from Rancho Pano Ayuctle at an elevation of  300 feet in rain forest, whereas _A. aztecus_ is known from Rancho del  Cielo at an elevation of 3300 feet in cloud forest. The two localities  are only four miles apart.    One of the specimens examined (GMS 10640) is smaller, cranially and  externally (see beyond), than any recorded by Davis (1958:165).         _Measurements._--Some external and cranial measurements of       two females and a male (GMS 10668, 10646 and 10640) are,       respectively, as follows: length of hind foot, 12.5, 12.0,       11.0; length of ear from notch, 15, 17, 15; length of       forearm, 40.5, 40.0, 36.5; greatest length of skull, 20.9,       20.7, 19.7; zygomatic breadth, 12.3, 12.3, 11.7; least       interorbital constriction, 5.2, 5.0, 5.0; length of       maxillary tooth-row, 6.8, 6.8, 6.5; breadth of braincase,       9.3, 9.2, 9.1.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 3 from Rio       Sabinas, near Gomez Farias (Rancho Pano Ayuctle) (GMS).      =Artibeus aztecus= Andersen    Aztec Fruit-eating Bat         1906. _Artibeus aztecus_ Andersen, Ann. Mag. Nat.

I follow Davis (1958:165) in treating _A. aztecus_ and _A. toltecus_ as  distinct species. Differences between the two are discussed in the  preceding account of _toltecus_.    One specimen examined (AMNH 146980) is distinctly larger than the  others here assigned to _A. aztecus_, but does not exceed the maximal  measurements given by Davis (_loc. cit._) for the species. This  specimen also has a narrower M2, and relatively and actually narrower  braincase than other specimens (see measurements).    Specimens from Rancho del Cielo were collected in a limestone cave in  the cloud forest. A female taken on July 2 carried a small embryo and  another obtained on August 14 had an embryo that appeared to be nearly  ready for birth.         _Measurements._--Respective external and cranial       measurements of three males (AMNH, uncatalogued) and a       female (AMNH 146980) are as follows: total length, 58, 65,       66, 73; length of hind foot, 13, 12, 12, 13; length of       forearm, --, 43, 40, 41; greatest length of skull, 21.6,       22.4, 21.5, 23.0; zygomatic breadth, 13.0, 12.8, 13.0, 12.4;       least interorbital constriction, 5.2, 5.7, 5.5, 6.0; length       of maxillary tooth-row, 7.0, 7.1, 6.9, 7.1; breadth of       braincase, 10.0, 9.8, 10.0, 9.5.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 7, all from       Rancho del Cielo, 3300 ft., (AMNH).      =Enchistenes hartii= (Thomas)    Little Fruit-eating Bat         1892. _Artibeus hartii_ Thomas, Ann.

London, 2:224, September 7.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Known only from Aserradero       del Infernillo.    _Enchistenes hartii_ is known from Tamaulipas only by the cranium  reported by Goodwin (1954:5), and this is the northernmost known  occurrence. The bat has not been reported from any other Mexican state  bordering on the Gulf of Mexico.      =Centurio senex= Gray    Wrinkle-faced Bat         1842. _Centurio senex_ Gray, Ann. Mag. Nat.

Nat.       Hist., 87:327, December 31, 1946).         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Tropical areas of southern       part of state.    The single specimen examined, a female weighing 23 grams that carried  an embryo (17 mm. crown-rump length), was taken on June 14 in a mist  net stretched between oak trees in the Sierra de Tamaulipas. One other  female and one cranium have been reported from Tamaulipas.    The specimen examined differs from two seen from southern Mexico (5 mi.  SW Teapa, Tabasco, and 2 mi. S Tollosa, Oaxaca) in being brownish  instead of grayish, but resembles in color two specimens from Cozumel  Island, Quintana Roo.         _Measurements._--A female from the Sierra de Tamaulipas       affords the following measurements: Total length, 67; length       of hind foot, 13; length of ear from notch, 15; length of       forearm, 43.1; condylobasal length, 15.0; zygomatic breadth,       5.1; palatal length, 4.1; least interorbital constriction,       5.3; length of maxillary tooth-row, 5.1.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimen examined, one from the       Sierra de Tamaulipas, 3 mi. S, 14 mi. W Piedra, 1300 ft.         Additional records: Rancho Pano Ayuctle (de la Torre,       1954:114); Aserradero del Infernillo (Goodwin, 1954:5).      =Desmodus rotundus murinus= Wagner    Vampire         1840. _D[esmodus]. murinus_ Wagner, _in_ Schreber, Die       Saeugthiere ..., Suppl., 1:337, type from Mexico.         1912. _Desmodus rotundus murinus_, Osgood, Field Mus.

Hall and Kelson (1959:151) listed a place 12 kilometers west and 8  kilometers north of Ciudad Victoria as the northernmost locality of  record for _Desmodus_, but three specimens from Cueva La Esperanza, 6  kilometers southwest of Rancho Santa Rosa, are from a site slightly to  the northwestward (12 mi.) of the locality first mentioned and a  specimen from 13 miles west and six and a half miles north of Jimenez  represents the northeasternmost known occurrence of _Desmodus_ in  eastern Mexico.    Most of the vampires examined in this study were taken in caves; those  from four miles southwest of Padilla were obtained from a hollow tree.
