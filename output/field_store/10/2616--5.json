What they were thinking of Arisia's Lens cannot be expressed in words.    \"Well, go on,\" Kinnison finally said. \"Give me the rest of it--the  stinger that you've been holding back.\"    \"The messages--_as messages_--were clear and plain. The backgrounds,  however, the connotations and implications, were not. Some of their  codes and standards seem to be radically different from ours--so  utterly and fantastically different that I simply cannot reconcile  either their conduct or their ethics with their obviously high  intelligence and their advanced state of development. However,  they have at least some minds of tremendous power, and none of  the peculiarities I deduced were of such a nature as to preclude  Lensmanship. Therefore I am going to Pluto; and from there--I hope--to  Palain Seven. If there's a Lensman there, I'll get him.\"    \"You will, at that,\" Kinnison paid quiet tribute to what he, better  than anyone else, knew that his friend had.    \"But enough of me--how are you doing?\"    \"As well as can be expected at this stage of the game. The thing is  developing along three main lines. First, the pirates. Since that kind  of thing is more or less my own line I'm handling it myself, unless and  until you find someone better qualified. I've got Jack and Costigan  working on it now.    \"Second; drugs, vice, and so on. I hope you find somebody to take this  line over, because, frankly, I'm in over my depth and want to get out.  Knobos and DalNalten are trying to find out if there's anything to  the idea that there may be a planetary, or even inter-planetary, ring  involved. Since Sid Fletcher isn't a Lensman I couldn't disconnect him  openly from his job, but he knows a lot about the dope-vice situation  and is working practically full time with the other two.    \"Third; pure--or rather, decidedly impure--politics. The more I studied  _that_ subject, the clearer it became that politics would be the worst  and biggest battle of the three. There are too many angles I don't  know a damned thing about, such as what to do about the succession of  foaming, screaming fits your friend Senator Morgan will be throwing  the minute he finds out what our Galactic Patrol is going to do. So I  ducked the whole political line.    \"Now you know as well as I do--better, probably--that Morgan is only  the Pernicious Activities Committee of the North American Senate.  Multiply him by the thousands of others, all over space, who will be on  our necks before the Patrol can get its space-legs, and you will see  that all that stuff will have to be handled by a Lensman who, as well  as being a mighty smooth operator, will have to know _all_ the answers  and will have to have plenty of guts. I've got the guts, but none of  the other prime requisites. Jill hasn't, although she's got everything  else. Fairchild, your Relations ace, isn't a Lensman and can never  become one. So you can see quite plainly who has got to handle politics  himself.\"    \"You may be right ... but this Lensman business comes first....\" Samms  pondered, then brightened. \"Perhaps--probably--I can find somebody on  this trip--a Palainian, say--who is better qualified than any of us.\"    Kinnison snorted. \"If you can, I'll buy you a week in any Venerian  relaxerie you want to name.\"    \"Better start saving up your credits, then, because from what I already  know of the Palainian mentality such a development is distinctly more  than a possibility.\" Samms paused, his eyes narrowing. \"I don't know  whether it would make Morgan and his kind more rabid or less so to have  a non-Solarian entity possess authority in our affairs political--but  at least it would be something new and different. But in spite of what  you said about 'ducking' politics, what have you got Northrop, Jill and  Fairchild doing?\"    \"Well, we had a couple of discussions. I couldn't give either Jill or  Dick orders, of course....\"    \"Wouldn't, you mean,\" Samms corrected.    \"Couldn't,\" Kinnison insisted. \"Jill, besides being your daughter and  Lensman grade, had no official connection with either the Triplanetary  Service or the Solarian Patrol. And the Service, including Fairchild,  is still Triplanetary; and it will have to stay Triplanetary until  you have found enough Lensmen so that you can spring your twin  surprises--Galactic Council and Galactic Patrol. However, Northrop and  Fairchild are keeping their eyes and ears open and their mouths shut,  and Jill is finding out whatever she can about drugs and so on, as  well as the various political angles. They'll report to you--facts,  deductions, guesses, and recommendations--whenever you say the word.\"    \"Nice work, Rod. Thanks. I think I'll call Jill now, before I  go--wonder where she is? ... but I wonder ... with the Lens perhaps  telephones are superfluous? I'll try it.\"    \"JILL!\" he thought intensely into his Lens, forming as he did so a  mental image of his gorgeous daughter as he knew her. But he found,  greatly to his surprise, that neither elaboration nor emphasis was  necessary.    \"Ouch!\" came the almost instantaneous answer, long before his thought  was complete. \"Don't think so hard, Dad, it hurts--I almost missed a  step.\" Virgilia was actually there with him; inside his own mind; in  closer touch with him than she had ever before been. \"Back so soon?  Shall we report now, or aren't you ready to go to work yet?\"    \"Skipping for the moment your aspersions on my present activities--not  quite.\" Samms moderated the intensity of his thought to a  conversational level. \"Just wanted to check with you. Come in, Rod.\" In  flashing thoughts he brought her up to date. \"Jill, do you agree with  what Rod here has just told me?\"    \"Yes. Fully. So do the boys.\"    \"That settles it, then--unless, of course, I can find a more capable  substitute.\"    \"Of course--but we will believe that when we see it.\"    \"Where are you and what are you doing?\"    \"Washington, D.C. European Embassy. Dancing with Herkimer Third,  Senator Morgan's Number One secretary. I was going to make passes at  him--in a perfectly lady-like way, of course--but it wasn't necessary.  He thinks he can break down my resistance.\"    \"Careful, Jill! That kind of stuff....\"    \"Is very old stuff indeed, Daddy dear. Simple. And Herkimer Third isn't  really a menace; he just thinks he is. Take a look--you can, can't  you, with your Lens?\"    \"Perhaps ... Oh, yes. I see him as well as you do.\" Fully en rapport  with the girl as he was, so that his mind received simultaneously with  hers any stimulus which she was willing to share, it seemed as though a  keen, handsome, deeply tanned face bent down from a distance of inches  toward his own. \"But I don't like it a bit--and him even less.\"    \"That's because you aren't a girl,\" Jill giggled mentally. \"This is  fun; and it won't hurt him a bit, except maybe for a slightly bruised  vanity, when I don't fall down flat at his feet. And I'm learning a lot  that he hasn't any suspicion he's giving away.\"    \"Knowing you, I believe that. But don't ... that is ... well, be _very_  careful not to get your fingers burned. The job isn't worth it--yet.\"    \"Don't worry, Dad.\" She laughed unaffectedly. \"When it comes to  playboys like this one, I've got millions and skillions and whillions  of ohms of resistance. But here comes Senator Morgan himself, with a  fat and repulsive Venerian--he's calling my boy-friend away from me,  with what he thinks is an imperceptible high-sign, into a huddle--and  my olfactory nerves perceive a rich and fruity aroma, as of  skunk--so ... I hate to seem to be giving a Solarian Councillor the  heave-ho, but if I want to read what goes on--and I certainly do--I'll  have to concentrate. As soon as you get back give us a call and we'll  report. Take it easy, Dad!\"    \"You're the one to be told that, not me. Good hunting, Jill!\"    Samms, still seated calmly at his desk, reached out and pressed a  button marked \"GARAGE\". His office was on the seventieth floor;  the garage occupied level after level of sub-basement. The screen  brightened; a keen young face appeared.    \"Good evening, Jim. Will you please send my car up to the Wright Skyway  feeder?\"    \"At once, sir. It will be there in seventy five seconds.\"    Samms cut off; and, after a brief exchange of thought with Kinnison,  went out into the hall and along it to the \"DOWN\" shaft. There,  going free, he stepped through a doorless, unguarded archway into  over a thousand feet of air. Although it was long after conventional  office hours the shaft was still fairly busy, but that made no  difference--inertialess collisions cannot even be felt. He bulleted  downward to the sixth floor, where he brought himself to an  instantaneous halt.    Leaving the shaft, he joined the now thinning crowd hurrying toward  the exit. A girl with meticulously plucked eyebrows and an astounding  hair-do, catching sight of his Lens, took her hands out of her breeches  pockets--skirts went out, as office dress, when up-and-down open-shaft  velocities of a hundred or so miles per hour replaced elevators--nudged  her companion, and whispered excitedly:    \"Look there! Quick! I never saw one close up before, did you? That's  him--himself! First Lensman Samms!\"    At the Portal, the Lensman as a matter of habit held out his car-check,  but such formalities were no longer necessary, or even possible.  Everybody knew, or wanted to be thought of as knowing, Virgil Samms.    \"Stall four sixty five, First Lensman, sir,\" the uniformed gateman told  him, without even glancing at the extended disk.    \"Thank you, Tom.\"    \"This way, please, sir, First Lensman,\" and a youth, teeth gleaming  white in a startlingly black face, strode proudly to the indicated  stall and opened the vehicle's door.    \"Thank you, Danny,\" Samms said, as appreciatively as though he did not  know exactly where his ground-car was.    He got in. The door jammed itself gently shut.

We have  been learning that the dairyman is more closely related to  bacteria and their activities than almost any other class of  persons. Modern dairying, apart from the matter of keeping the  cow, consists largely in trying to prevent bacteria from growing  in milk or in stimulating their growth in cream, butter, and  cheese. These chief products of the dairy will be considered  separately.    SOURCES OF BACTERIA IN MILK.    The first fact that claims our attention is, that milk at the time  it is secreted from the udder of the healthy cow contains no  bacteria. Although bacteria are almost ubiquitous, they are not  found in the circulating fluids of healthy animals, and are not  secreted by their glands. Milk when first secreted by the milk  gland is therefore free from bacteria. It has taken a long time to  demonstrate this fact, but it has been finally satisfactorily  proved. Secondly, it has been demonstrated that practically all of  the normal changes which occur in milk after its secretion are  caused by the growth of bacteria. This, too, was long denied, and  for quite a number of years after putrefactions and fermentations  were generally acknowledged to be caused by the growth of micro-  organisms, the changes which occurred in milk were excepted from  the rule. The uniformity with which milk will sour, and the  difficulty, or seeming impossibility, of preventing this change,  led to the belief that the souring of milk was a normal change  characteristic of milk, just as clotting is characteristic of  blood. This was, however, eventually disproved, and it was finally  demonstrated that, beyond a few physical changes connected with  evaporation and a slight oxidation of the fat, milk, if kept free  from bacteria, will undergo no change. If bacteria are not  present, it will remain sweet indefinitely.    But it is impossible to draw milk from the cow in such a manner  that it will be free from bacteria except by the use of  precautions absolutely impracticable in ordinary dairying. As milk  is commonly drawn, it is sure to be contaminated by bacteria, and  by the time it has entered the milk pail it contains frequently as  many as half a million, or even a million, bacteria in every cubic  inch of the milk. This seems almost incredible, but it has been  demonstrated in many cases and is beyond question. Since these  bacteria are not in the secreted milk, they must come from some  external sources, and these sources are the following:    The first in importance is the cow herself; for while her milk  when secreted is sterile, and while there are no bacteria in her  blood, nevertheless the cow is the most prolific source of  bacterial contamination. In the first place, the milk ducts are  full of them. After each milking a little milk is always left in  the duct, and this furnishes an ideal place for bacteria to grow.  Some bacteria from the air or elsewhere are sure to get into these  ducts after the milking, and they begin at once to multiply  rapidly. By the next milking they become very abundant in the  ducts, and the first milk drawn washes most of them at once into  the milk pail, where they can continue their growth in the milk.  Again, the exterior of the cow's body contains them in abundance.  Every hair, every particle of dirt, every bit of dried manure, is  a lurking place for millions of bacteria. The hind quarters of a  cow are commonly in a condition of much filth, for the farmer  rarely grooms his cow, and during the milking, by her movements,  by the switching of her tail, and by the rubbing she gets from the  milker, no inconsiderable amount of this dirt and filth is brushed  off and falls into the milk pail The farmer understands this  source of dirt and usually feels it necessary to strain the milk  after the milking. But the straining it receives through a coarse  cloth, while it will remove the coarser particles of dirt, has no  effect upon the bacteria, for these pass through any strainer  unimpeded. Again, the milk vessels themselves contain bacteria, for  they are never washed absolutely clean. After the most thorough  washing which the milk pail receives from the kitchen, there will  always be left many bacteria clinging in the cracks of the tin or  in the wood, ready to begin to grow as soon as the milk once more  fills the pail The milker himself contributes to the supply, for  he goes to the milking with unclean hands, unclean clothes, and  not a few bacteria get from him to his milk pail. Lastly, we find  the air of the milking stall furnishing its quota of milk bacteria.  This source of bacteria is, how ever, not so great as was formerly  believed. That the air may contain many bacteria in its dust is  certain, and doubtless these fall in some quantity into the milk,  especially if the cattle are allowed to feed upon dusty hay before  and during the milking. But unless the air is thus full of dust  this source of bacteria is not very great, and compared with the  bacteria from the other sources the air bacteria are unimportant.    The milk thus gets filled with bacteria, and since it furnishes an  excellent food these bacteria begin at once to grow. The milk when  drawn is warm and at a temperature which especially stimulates  bacterial growth. They multiply with great rapidity, and in the  course of a few hours increase perhaps a thousandfold. The numbers  which may be found after twenty-four hours are sometimes  inconceivable; market milk may contain as many as five hundred  millions per cubic inch; and while this is a decidedly extreme  number, milk that is a day old will almost always contain many  millions in each cubic inch, the number depending upon the age of  the milk and its temperature. During this growth the bacteria  have, of course, not been without their effect. Recognising as we  do that bacteria are agents for chemical change, we are prepared  to see the milk undergoing some modifications during this rapid  multiplication of bacteria. The changes which these bacteria  produce in the milk and its products are numerous, and decidedly  affect its value. They are both advantageous and disadvantageous  to the dairyman. They are nuisances so far as concerns the milk  producer, but allies of the butter and cheese maker.    THE EFFECT OF BACTERIA ON MILK.    The first and most universal change effected in milk is its  SOURING. So universal is this phenomenon that it is generally  regarded as an inevitable change which can not be avoided, and, as  already pointed out, has in the past been regarded as a normal  property of milk. To-day, however, the phenomenon is well  understood. It is due to the action of certain of the milk  bacteria upon the milk sugar which converts it into lactic acid,  and this acid gives the sour taste and curdles the milk. After  this acid is produced in small quantity its presence proves  deleterious to the growth of the bacteria, and further bacterial  growth is checked. After souring, therefore, the milk for some  time does not ordinarily undergo any further changes.    Milk souring has been commonly regarded as a single phenomenon,  alike in all cases. When it was first studied by bacteriologists  it was thought to be due in all cases to a single species of  micro-organism which was discovered to be commonly present and  named Bacillus acidi lactici (Fig. 19). This bacterium has  certainly the power of souring milk rapidly, and is found to be  very common in dairies in Europe. As soon as bacteriologists  turned their attention more closely to the subject it was found  that the spontaneous souring of milk was not always caused by the  same species of bacterium. Instead of finding this Bacillus acidi  lactici always present, they found that quite a number of  different species of bacteria have the power of souring milk, and  are found in different specimens of soured milk. The number of  species of bacteria which have been found to sour milk has  increased until something over a hundred are known to have this  power. These different species do not affect the milk in the same  way. All produce some acid, but they differ in the kind and the  amount of acid, and especially in the other changes which are  effected at the same time that the milk is soured, so that the  resulting soured milk is quite variable. In spite of this variety,  however, the most recent work tends to show that the majority of  cases of spontaneous souring of milk are produced by bacteria  which, though somewhat variable, probably constitute a single  species, and are identical with the Bacillus acidi lactici (Fig.  19). This species, found common in the dairies of Europe,  according to recent investigations occurs in this country as well.  We may say, then, that while there are many species of bacteria  infesting the dairy which can sour the milk, there is one which is  more common and more universally found than others, and this is  the ordinary cause of milk souring.    When we study more carefully the effect upon the milk of the  different species of bacteria found in the dairy, we find that  there is a great variety of changes which they produce when they  are allowed to grow in milk. The dairyman experiences many  troubles with his milk. It sometimes curdles without becoming  acid. Sometimes it becomes bitter, or acquires an unpleasant  \"tainted\" taste, or, again, a \"soapy\" taste. Occasionally a  dairyman finds his milk becoming slimy, instead of souring and  curdling in the normal fashion. At such times, after a number of  hours, the milk becomes so slimy that it can be drawn into long  threads. Such an infection proves very troublesome, for many a  time it persists in spite of all attempts made to remedy it.  Again, in other cases the milk will turn blue, acquiring about the  time it becomes sour a beautiful sky-blue colour. Or it may become  red, or occasionally yellow. All of these"]]]
