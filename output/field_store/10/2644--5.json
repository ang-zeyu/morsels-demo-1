[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5341"],[0,"Kilmeny of the Orchard (#10)"],[1,"night. It was a long while before I had  the heart to read her books. But when I did I thought them so beautiful.  They were poetry and it was like music put into words.\"    \"I will bring you some books to read, if you would like them,\" said  Eric.    Her great blue eyes gleamed with interest and delight.    \"Oh, thank you, I would like it very much. I have read mine over so  often that I know them nearly all by heart. One cannot get tired of  really beautiful things, but sometimes I feel that I would like some new  books.\"    \"Are you never lonely, Kilmeny?\"    \"Oh, no, how could I be? There is always plenty for me to do, helping  Aunt Janet about the house. I can do a great many things\"--she glanced  up at him with a pretty pride as her flying pencil traced the words. \"I  can cook and sew. Aunt Janet says I am a very good housekeeper, and she  does not praise people very often or very much. And then, when I am  not helping her, I have my dear, dear violin. That is all the company I  want. But I like to read and hear of the big world so far away and the  people who live there and the things that are done. It must be a very  wonderful place.\"    \"Wouldn't you like to go out into it and see its wonders and meet those  people yourself?\" he asked, smiling at her.    At once he saw that, in some way he could not understand, he had hurt  her. She snatched her pencil and wrote, with such swiftness of  motion and energy of expression that it almost seemed as if she had  passionately exclaimed the words aloud,    \"No, no, no. I do not want to go anywhere away from home. I do not want  ever to see strangers or have them see me. I could not bear it.\"    He thought that possibly the consciousness of her defect accounted  for this. Yet she did not seem sensitive about her dumbness and made  frequent casual references to it in her written remarks. Or perhaps  it was the shadow on her birth. Yet she was so innocent that it seemed  unlikely she could realize or understand the existence of such a shadow.  Eric finally decided that it was merely the rather morbid shrinking of a  sensitive child who had been brought up in an unwholesome and unnatural  way. At last the lengthening shadows warned him that it was time to go.    \"You won't forget to come to-morrow evening and play for me,\" he said,  rising reluctantly. She answered by a quick little shake of her sleek,  dark head, and a smile that was eloquent. He watched her as she walked  across the orchard,        \"With the moon's beauty and the moon's soft pace,\"    and along the wild cherry lane. At the corner of the firs she paused and  waved her hand to him before turning it.    When Eric reached home old Robert Williamson was having a lunch of bread  and milk in the kitchen. He looked up, with a friendly grin, as Eric  strode in, whistling.    \"Been having a walk, Master?\" he queried.    \"Yes,\" said Eric.    Unconsciously and involuntarily he infused so much triumph into the  simple monosyllable that even old Robert felt it. Mrs. Williamson, who  was cutting bread at the end of the table, laid down her knife and loaf,  and looked at the young man with a softly troubled expression in her  eyes. She wondered if he had been back to the Connors orchard--and if he  could have seen Kilmeny Gordon again.    \"You didn't discover a gold mine, I s'pose?\" said old Robert dryly. \"You  look as if you might have.\"        CHAPTER VIII. AT THE GATE OF EDEN    When Eric went to the old Connors orchard the next evening he found  Kilmeny waiting for him on the bench under the white lilac tree, with  the violin in her lap. As soon as she saw him she caught it up and began  to play an airy delicate little melody that sounded like the laughter of  daisies.    When it was finished she dropped her bow, and looked up at him with  flushed cheeks and questioning eyes.    \"What did that say to you?\" she wrote.    \"It said something like this,\" answered Eric, falling into her humour  smilingly. \"Welcome, my friend. It is a very beautiful evening. The sky  is so blue and the apple blossoms so sweet. The wind and I have been  here alone together and the wind is a good companion, but still I am  glad to see you. It is an evening on which it is good to be alive and to  wander in an orchard that is fine and white. Welcome, my friend.\"    She clapped her hands, looking like a pleased child.    \"You are very quick to understand,\" she wrote. \"That was just what I  meant. Of course I did not think it in just those words, but that was  the FEELING of it. I felt that I was so glad I was alive, and that the  apple blossoms and the white lilacs and the trees and I were all pleased  together to see you come. You are quicker than Neil. He is almost always  puzzled to understand my music, and I am puzzled to understand his.  Sometimes it frightens me. It seems as if there were something in it  trying to take hold of me--something I do not like and want to run away  from.\"    Somehow Eric did not like her references to Neil. The idea of that  handsome, low-born boy seeing Kilmeny every day, talking to her, sitting  at the same table with her, dwelling under the same roof, meeting her in  the hundred intimacies of daily life, was distasteful to him. He put the  thought away from him, and flung himself down on the long grass at her  feet.    \"Now play for me, please,\" he said. \"I want to lie here and listen to  you.\"    \"And look at you,\" he might have added. He could not tell which was  the greater pleasure. Her beauty, more wonderful than any pictured  loveliness he had ever seen, delighted him. Every tint and curve and  outline of her face was flawless. Her music enthralled him. This child,  he told himself as he listened, had genius. But it was being wholly  wasted. He found himself thinking resentfully of the people who were her  guardians, and who were responsible for her strange life. They had done  her a great and irremediable wrong. How dared they doom her to such an  existence? If her defect of utterance had been attended to in time, who  knew but that it might have been cured? Now it was probably too late.  Nature had given her a royal birthright of beauty and talent, but their  selfish and unpardonable neglect had made it of no account.    What divine music she lured out of the old violin--merry and sad, gay  and sorrowful by turns, music such as the stars of morning might have  made singing together, music that the fairies might have danced to in  their revels among the green hills or on yellow sands, music that might  have mourned over the grave of a dead hope. Then she drifted into a  still sweeter strain. As he listened to it he realized that the whole  soul and nature of the girl were revealing themselves to him through her  music--the beauty and purity of her thoughts, her childhood dreams and  her maiden reveries. There was no thought of concealment about her; she  could not help the revelation she was unconscious of making.    At last she laid her violin aside and wrote,    \"I have done my best to give you pleasure. It is your turn now. Do you  remember a promise you made me last night? Have you kept it?\"    He gave her the two books he had brought for her--a modern novel and  a volume of poetry unknown to her. He had hesitated a little over the  former; but the book was so fine and full of beauty that he thought it  could not bruise the bloom of her innocence ever so slightly. He had  no doubts about the poetry. It was the utterance of one of those great  inspired souls whose passing tread has made the kingdom of their birth  and labour a veritable Holy Land.    He read her some of the poems. Then he talked to her of his college days  and friends. The minutes passed very swiftly. There was just then no  world for him outside of that old orchard with its falling blossoms and  its shadows and its crooning winds.    Once, when he told her the story of some college pranks wherein the  endless feuds of freshmen and sophomores figured, she clapped her hands  together according to her habit, and laughed aloud--a clear, musical,  silvery peal. It fell on Eric's ear with a shock of surprise. He thought  it strange that she could laugh like that when she could not speak.  Wherein lay the defect that closed for her the gates of speech? Was it  possible that it could be removed?    \"Kilmeny,\" he said gravely after a moment's reflection, during which  he had looked up as she sat with the ruddy sunlight falling through the  lilac branches on her bare, silky head like a shower of red jewels, \"do  you mind if I ask you something about your inability to speak? Will it  hurt you to talk of the matter with me?\"    She shook her head.    \"Oh, no,\" she wrote, \"I do not mind at all. Of course I am sorry I  cannot speak, but I am quite used to the thought and it never hurts me  at all.\"    \"Then, Kilmeny, tell me this. Do you know why it is that you are unable  to speak, when all your other faculties are so perfect?\"    \"No, I do not know at all why I cannot speak. I asked mother once and  she told me it was a judgment on her for a great sin she had committed,  and she looked so strangely that I was frightened, and I never spoke of  it to her or anyone else again.\"    \"Were you ever taken to a doctor to have your tongue and organs of  speech examined?\"    \"No. I remember when I was a very little girl that Uncle Thomas wanted  to take me to a doctor in Charlottetown and see if anything could be  done for me, but mother would not let him. She said it would be no use.  And I do not think Uncle Thomas thought it would be, either.\"    \"You can laugh very naturally. Can you make any other sound?\"    \"Yes, sometimes. When I am pleased or frightened I have made little  cries. But it is only when I am not thinking of it at all that I can do  that. If I TRY to make a sound I cannot do it at all.\"    This seemed to Eric more mysterious than ever.    \"Do you ever try to speak--to utter words?\" he persisted.    \"Oh yes, very"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53416"],[0,"Only a Girl's Love (#10)"],[1,"that attracted, almost fascinated, her.    It was in a voice almost hushed by the indescribable effect produced by  the face, that she said:    \"And he is like that?\"    \"It is lifelike,\" he answered. \"I, who painted it, should not say it,  but it is like him nevertheless--that is Leycester Wyndward. Why did  you ask?\"    Stella hesitated.    \"Because--I scarcely know. It is such a strange face, uncle. The  eyes--what is it in the eyes that makes me almost unable to look away  from them?\"    \"The reflection of a man's soul, Stella,\" he said.    It was a strange answer, and the girl looked down at the strange face  interrogatively.    \"The reflection of a man's soul, Stella. The Wyndwards have always  been a wild, reckless, passionate race; here, in this village, they  have innumerable legends of the daring deeds of the lords of Wyndward.  Murder, rapine, and high-handed tyranny in the olden times, wild  license and desperate profligacy in these modern ones; but of all the  race this Leycester Wyndward is the wildest and most heedless. Look  at him, Stella, you see him here in his loose shooting-jacket, built  by Poole; with the diamond pin in his irreproachable scarf, with  his hair cut to the regulation length: I see him in armor with his  sword upraised to watch the passionate fire of his eyes. There is a  picture in the great gallery up yonder of one of the Wyndwards clad  just so, in armor of glittering steel, with one foot on the body of a  prostrate foe, one hand upraised to strike the death-dealing blow of  his battle-ax. Yes, Leycester Wyndward should have lived four centuries  back.\"    Stella smiled.    \"Has he committed many murders, uncle, burnt down many villages?\"    The old man started and looked up at the exquisite face, with its arch  smile beaming in the dark eyes and curving the red, ripe lips, and  smiled in response.    \"I was dreaming, Stella; an odd trick of mine. No, men of his stamp  are sadly circumscribed nowadays. We have left them no vent for their  natures now, excepting the gambling-table, the turf, and----\" he roused  suddenly. \"Yes, it's a beautiful face, Stella, but it belongs to a man  who has done more harm in his day than all his forefathers did before  him. It is rather a good thing that Wyndward Hall stands so firmly, or  else Leycester would have melted it at ecarte and baccarat long ago.\"    \"Is he so bad then?\" murmured Stella.    Her uncle smiled.    \"Bad is a mild word, Stella; and yet--look at the face again. I have  seen it softened by a smile such as might have been worn by an innocent  child; I have heard those lips laugh as--as women are supposed to laugh  before this world has driven all laughter out of them; and when those  eyes smile there is no resisting them for man or woman.\"    He stopped suddenly and looked up.    \"I am wandering on like an old mill. Put the picture away, Stella.\"    She took it from him and carried it across the room, but stood for  a moment silently regarding it by the lamp light. As she did so, a  strange fancy made her start and set the picture on the table suddenly.  It seemed to her as if the dark eyes had suddenly softened in their  intense fixed gaze and smiled at her.    It was the trick of a warm, imaginative temperament, and it took  possession of her so completely that with a swift gesture she laid her  hand over the dark eyes and so hid them.    Then, with a laugh at her own folly, she put the picture against the  wall and went back to the window and sat beside the old man.    \"Tell me about your past life, Stella,\" he said, in a low voice.    \"It seems to me as if you had always been here. You have a quiet way of  speaking and moving about, child.\"    \"I learnt that while papa was ill,\" she said, simply. \"Sometimes he  would sit for hours playing softly, and I did not wish to disturb him.\"    \"I remember, I remember,\" he murmured. \"Stella, the world should have  known something of him; he was a born musician.\"    \"He used to say the same of you, uncle; you should have been a famous  artist.\"    The old man looked up with a smile.    \"My child, there are many men whom the world knows nothing of--luckily  for them. Your father and I were dreamers, both; the world likes men of  action. Can you play?\"    She rose and stood for a moment hesitating. In the corner of the room  there was a small chamber organ--one of those wonderful instruments  which in a small space combine the grand tones of a cathedral organ  with the melodious softness of a flute. It was one of the few luxuries  which the artist had permitted himself, and he was in the habit of  playing snatches of Verdi and Rossini, of Schubert and Mozart, when the  fading light compelled him to lay the brush aside.    Stella went up to it softly and seated herself, and presently began to  play. She attempted no difficult fugue or brilliant march, but played  a simple Florentine vesper hymn, which she had heard floating from the  devout lips of the women kneeling before the altar of the great church  in Florence, and presently began to sing it.    The old man started as the first clear bird-like notes rose softly  upon the evening air, and then covering his face with his hands went  straight to dreamland.    The vesper hymn died softly, slowly out, and she rose, but with a  gesture of his hand he motioned her to remain at the organ.    \"You have your father's voice, Stella; sing again.\"    She sang a pleasant ditty this time, with a touch of pathos in the  refrain, and hearing a slight noise as she finished, looked round, and  saw the old man rise, and with quivering lips turn toward the door.    The young girl's sweet voice had brought back the past and its dead too  plainly, and he had gone out lest she should see his emotion.    Stella rose and went to the window, and stood looking into the night.  The moonlight was glinting the river in the distance, and falling  in great masses upon the lawn at her feet. Half unconsciously she  opened the window, and stepping out, found herself in a small garden,  beautifully kept and fragrant with violets; her love for flowers was  a passion, and she stepped on to the path in search of them. The path  led in zigzag fashion to a little wooden gate, by which the garden was  entered from the lane. Stella found some violets, and looking about in  search of further treasure store, saw a bunch of lilac blossom growing  in the lane side.    To open the gate and run lightly up the side of the bank was the  impulse of the moment, and she obeyed it; there were still deeper  masses of flowers a little further down, and she was walking toward  them when she heard the sound of a horse galloping toward her.    For a moment she was so startled by the unexpected sound that she  stood looking toward the direction whence it came, and in that moment  a horse and rider turned the corner and made full pelt for the spot  where she was standing. Stella glanced back toward the little white  gate to discover that it was not in sight, and that she had gone  further than she intended. It was of no use to attempt to get back  before the horseman reached her, there was only time to get out of the  way. Lightly springing up the bank, she stood under the lilac tree and  waited.    As she did so, the horse and man came out of the shadow into the  moonlight. To Stella, both looked tremendously big and tall in the  deceptive light, but it was not the size, but the attitude of the rider  which struck her and chained her attention.    She could not see his face, but the figure was that of a young man,  tall and stalwart, and full of a strange, masterful grace which  displayed itself in the easy, reckless way in which he sat the great  animal, and in the poise of the head which, slightly thrown back,  seemed in its very attitude eloquent of pride and defiance. There was  something strange and unusual about the whole bearing that struck  Stella, unused as she was to meeting horsemen in an English country  lane.    As he came a little nearer she noticed that he was dressed in evening  dress, excepting his coat, which was of velvet, and sat loosely, yet  gracefully, upon the stalwart frame. In simple truth the rider had  thrown off his dress coat for a smoking jacket, and still wore his  dress boots. Stella saw the moonlight shining upon them and upon a  ruby, which blazed sullenly upon the white hand which held the whip.    As if rider and horse were one, they came up the lane, and were abreast  of her, the man all unconscious of her presence. But not so the horse;  his quick, restless eye had caught sight of the shimmer of Stella's  dress, and with a toss of the head he swerved aside and stood still.  The rider brought his eyes from the sky, and raising his whip, cut the  horse across the flank, with a gesture of impatient anger; but the  horse--a splendid, huge-boned Irish mare, as fiery and obstinate as a  lion--rose on its hind legs instantly, and the whip came down again.    \"Confound you! what is the matter?\" exclaimed its master. \"Go on, you  idiot!\"    The horse pricked its ears at the sound of the familiar voice, but  stood stock still, quivering in every limb.    Stella saw the whip raised again, and instinctively, before she was  aware of it, her womanly protest sprang from her lips.    \"No! no!\"    At the sound of the eager, imploring voice, the rider kept his whip  poised in the air, then let his arm fall, and dragging rather than  guiding the horse, forced it near the hedge.    \"Who is it? Who are you?\" he demanded, angrily. \"What the----\"    Then he stopped suddenly, and stared speechlessly, motionless, and  transfixed--horse and rider, as it were, turned to stone.    Tall and graceful, with that grace which belongs to the girlhood which  stands on the threshold of womanhood, with her exquisite face fixed in  an expression of mingled fear and pity, and a shyness struggling with  maidenly pride, she made a picture which was lovely enough to satisfy  the"]]]
