The governor  replied that he could call out the militia and escort them back to  their homes; but he considered that he had no authority to detail any  force for their protection after he had thus reinstated them. As to go  back under those circumstances would be exposing themselves to more  violence from their enemies, they could not avail themselves of the  governor's proffered assistance to return.    The Saints remained scattered through Clay and the surrounding counties  until 1836, when, at the request of the citizens of Clay County, who  had kindly received them in their affliction, they moved northward and  petitioned for the forming of a new county. The new county was called  Caldwell, and the county seat, Far West.    The rapidity with which the new county increased in population and  prosperity, aroused the jealousy of the people in surrounding counties;  and as the inhabitants of Jackson had despoiled the Saints with  impunity, it encouraged others that were like-minded to attempt the  same thing. Especially was this the case when they saw those who had  taken a prominent part in expelling the Saints from Jackson County,  holding high positions in the state.    The fact that the religion of the Saints was different from that  professed by their neighbors was of itself sufficient to arouse the  hatred and jealousy of the sectarian ministers, who throughout all the  Missouri troubles took not only an active but a leading part. A leading  part in what? In murdering, plundering, driving, imprisoning, whipping  and turning out of their homes their fellow men! A fine occupation for  ministers of the gospel truly! And for what? Because the Saints bore  witness that God had restored to the earth the gospel of Jesus Christ  in its fullness; that the Priesthood to administer in its ordinances  was again conferred on men; and they announced it as their intention to  beautify the earth and prepare a portion of it for the coming of the  Son of God. For this they were hated by the Missourians, and considered  the legitimate prey of the despoiler.    Another circumstance that increased the hatred and jealousy of the  Missourians against the Saints was the growing political power of  the latter; and it was at a political election in Gallatin, Daviess  County--a county joining Caldwell on the north--that the troubles in  the autumn of 1838 began.    A number of the Saints had settled in Daviess County, and being  citizens of the United States, and of the state and county where they  lived, and possessing all the qualifications of voters, they essayed  to cast their ballots at the aforesaid election, but some of the old  settlers sought forcibly to prevent them; a thing which the brethren  would not quietly submit to, and a disturbance was the result. Upon  that difficulty the mob founded their pretext for the commencement  of open hostilities. The clouds which had been gathering hatred and  jealousy for so long, burst almost without warning upon the unprotected  heads of the Saints.    Scenes of mob violence were of almost daily occurrence; property was  destroyed, men were tied up and beaten until blood streamed down their  backs; the chastity of women was forcibly outraged; cattle and hogs  were wantonly shot down; houses were ruthlessly burned in the presence  of their owners; fields of grain destroyed--but this was not the  worst--helpless women and children were brutally murdered together with  defenseless old men, some of whom had fought in the continental army  during the American Revolution. Elder Taylor, in relating these scenes  some thirty years after they had occurred, refers to one who had been  of the class last named:    \"My mind wanders back upwardly of thirty years ago,\" he says, \"when in  the state of Missouri, Mr. McBride, a gray-haired, venerable veteran  of the Revolution, with feeble frame and tottering steps, cried to  a Missouri patriot: 'Spare my life, I am a revolutionary soldier,  I fought for liberty, would you murder me? What is my offense, I  believe in God and revelation?' This frenzied disciple of a misplaced  faith said, 'Take that you God d--d Mormon,' and with the butt of his  gun he dashed his brains out, and he lay quivering there, his white  locks clotted with his own brains and gore, on the soil that he had  heretofore shed his blood to redeem--a sacrifice at the shrine of  liberty!\"    Taking advantage of the disturbance at the election in Gallatin, some  of the old settlers at Millport, in the same county, set fire to  their log huts and then fled southward, spreading the report that the  Mormons had burned their houses and driven them from their lands. At  this rumor, false though it was, a wave of popular indignation passed  through the state, which Governor Boggs took advantage of to issue an  exterminating order, and called out the militia of the state to execute  it.    Governor Boggs was the more ready to issue this infamous order, because  he himself had imbibed a hatred of the Saints, and had been an active  participant against them in the Jackson County troubles.    By this edict the Governor virtually converted the mobs that had been  plundering the Saints into the state militia, and gave them full  license to continue the war on the Saints, which they did in the most  brutal manner.    The result of these outrages was that some four hundred of the Saints  were either murdered outright or died from exposure and hardship  inflicted upon them in this unhallowed persecution; from twelve to  fifteen thousand citizens of the United States were expelled from the  state of Missouri--from the lands they had purchased of the general  government; while their homes were destroyed, and their stock and much  other property were confiscated. Many of the leaders in the Church,  among them the Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum, were cast into  prison.    Elder Taylor was a witness of these high-handed and unlawful  proceedings, and a sufferer in some of them. One circumstance he  relates which I do not remember to have seen elsewhere, and hence give  it here:    \"On one occasion, when some thirty-five hundred of the mob forces were  approaching Far West, our officer, Colonel Hinkle, sought to betray  us, and as a preliminary step, ordered us to retreat. 'Retreat!'  exclaimed Joseph Smith. 'Why, where in the name of God shall we go?'  Then turning to our men he said: 'Boys, follow me.' About two hundred  men went out on the open prairie to meet the thirty-five hundred.  While these forces faced each other, a flag of truce came in from the  mob bearing the message that it was their intention to destroy Far  West; but there was a man and his family--of the name of Lightner--not  Mormons, who had friends among the attacking party, and they desired  this family to leave the city before it was destroyed. This message was  sent to the family. They replied that they had always been treated with  consideration by the Mormons, and they would stay with them. This reply  the Prophet Joseph took in person to the flag of truce man; and just  then a troop of cavalry, two hundred strong, was seen approaching, and  Joseph added this to the answer sent by the non-Mormon family: 'Go tell  your general for me that if he does not immediately withdraw his men, I  will send them to hell!'\"    Notwithstanding their superiority in numbers the mob beat a hasty and  inglorious retreat.    Such were the scenes enacted in Missouri during the stay of Elder  Taylor in that state; and it was in the midst of such scenes as these,  on the 19th of December, 1838, that he was ordained an Apostle of the  Lord Jesus Christ, by Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball.    Footnotes    1. Ether XIII, and III. Nephi XX and XXI.        CHAPTER VII.    BANISHED FROM MISSOURI--RETURNS TO FULFILL A PROPHECY--STARTS ON HIS  MISSION TO ENGLAND--SICKNESS BY THE WAY--ARRIVAL IN NEW YORK.    The Saints, after their expulsion from the State of Missouri, found a  temporary resting place in Quincy, Illinois, and to that city, after  visiting the Prophet Joseph Smith in Liberty prison, the place of his  incarceration, Elder Taylor made his way.    Several of the Apostles who met there held a consultation in respect to  the revelation which had been given the July previous, commanding their  quorum to take leave of the Saints in the city of Far West, on the 26th  day of April, 1839, at the building spot of the Lord's house, previous  to crossing the Atlantic on a mission to foreign lands. It had been  the constant boast of the mob from the time the revelation was made  known, that this was one of \"Joe Smith's\" revelations that should fail  of fulfillment if no other did. But the several Apostles who took part  in the above mentioned consultation, among whom was Elder Taylor, were  determined that the revelation should not fail, and agreed to return to  Far West by different routes, and meet at the temple site on the day  appointed.    Their undertaking was successful. Five of the Apostles were at the  temple site before daylight of the day appointed, together with a  number of high priests, elders and priests. At this meeting they  excommunicated a number of persons from the Church, ordained Wilford  Woodruff and George A. Smith apostles, and others were ordained to the  office of seventy. Prayer was offered up by the apostles in the order  of their standing in their quorum. It was a brilliant, moonlight night,  according to Elder Taylor, and out on the still air, strong and clear  rose that glorious song of Zion--        ADAM ONDI-AHMAN. [1]        This earth was once a garden place,      With all her glories common;      And men did live a holy race,      And worship Jesus face to face--               In Adam-ondi-Ahman.

If it was Jake Burke, alias Happy Harry, and his  crowd, including Appleson, Morse and Featherton, they're a bad  lot. I wouldn't want father to know they were around, for he'd be  sure to worry himself sick. He never really got over the time they  attacked me, and got the patent away. Dad sure thought he was  ruined then.\"    \"Now if I tell him I was chloroformed again to-night, and that I  think it was Burke and his crowd, he'd be sure to get ill over it.  So I'm just going to keep mum.\"    \"Well, perhaps it's the best plan. But you ought to do something.\"    \"Oh, I will, Ned, don't worry about that. I feel much better now.\"    \"How did it happen?\" asked Ned, his curiosity not yet satisfied.    \"I don't know, exactly. I was in the booth, talking to you, and  not paying much attention to anything else. I was adjusting and  readjusting the current, trying to get that image to appear on the  plate. All at once, I felt someone back of me, and, before I could  turn, that hand, with the chloroform sponge, was over my mouth and  nose. I struggled, and called out, but it wasn't much use.\"    \"But they didn't do anything else--they didn't take anything; did  they, Tom?\"    \"I don't know, Ned. We'll have to look around. They must have  sneaked into the shop. I left the door open, you see. It would  have been easy enough.\"    \"How many were there?\"    \"I couldn't tell. I only felt one fellow at me; but he may have  had others with him.\"    \"What particular invention were they after, Tom?\"    \"I'm sure I don't know. There are several models in here that  would be valuable. I know one thing, though, they couldn't have  been after my photo telephone,\" and Tom laughed grimly.    \"Why not?\" Ned wanted to know.    \"Because it's a failure--that's what! It's a dead, sure failure,  Ned, and I'm going to give it up!\" and Tom spoke bitterly.    \"Oh, don't say that!\" urged his chum. \"You may be right on the  verge of perfecting it, Tom. Didn't you see any image at all on  the plate?\"    \"Not a shadow. I must be on the wrong track. Well, never mind  about that now. I'm going to look around, and see if those fellows  took anything.\"    Tom was feeling more like himself again, the effects of the  chloroform having passed away. He had breathed the fumes of it for  only a little while, so no harm had been done. He and Ned made an  examination of the shop, but found nothing missing.    There were no traces of the intruders, however, though the two  chums looked carefully about outside the building.    \"You were too quick for them, Ned,\" said Tom. \"You came as soon as  I called. They heard me speaking, and must have known that I had  given the alarm.\"    \"Yes, I didn't lose any time,\" admitted Ned, \"but I didn't see a  sign of anyone as I ran up.\"    \"They must have been pretty quick at getting away. Well, now to  decide what's best to do to-night.\"    After some consultation and consideration it was decided to set  the burglar alarms in every building of the Swift plant. Some time  previous, when he had been working on a number of valuable  inventions, unscrupulous men had tried to steal his ideas and  models. To prevent this Tom had arranged a system of burglar  alarms, and had also fitted up a wizard camera that would take  moving pictures of anyone coming within its focus. The camera  could be set to work at night, in connection with the burglar  alarms.    The apparatus was effective, and thus an end was put to the  efforts of the criminals. But now it seemed Tom would have to take  new precautionary measures. His camera, however, was not  available, as he had loaned it to a scientific society for  exhibition.    \"But we'll attach the burglar wires,\" decided Tom, \"and see what  happens.\"    \"It might be a good plan to have Koku on guard,\" said Tom's chum.  \"That giant could handle four or five of the chaps as easily as  you and I could tackle one.\"    \"That's right,\" agreed Tom. \"I'll put him on guard. Whew! That  chloroform is giving me a headache. Guess I'll go to bed. I wish  you'd stay over to-night, Ned, if you haven't anything else to do.  I may need you.\"    \"Then of course I'll stay, Tom. I'll telephone home that I won't  be in.\"    A little later Tom had put away his new photo telephone apparatus,  and had prepared for the warm reception of any unbidden callers.    \"I wish I hadn't started on this new invention,\" said Tom, half  bitterly, as he locked up the main parts of his machine, \"I know  it will never work.\"    \"Oh, yes it will,\" spoke Ned, cheerfully. \"You never failed yet,  Tom Swift, in anything you undertook, and you're not going to  now.\"    \"Well, that's good of you to say, Ned, but I think you're wrong  this time. But I'm not going to think any more about it to-night,  anyhow. Now to find Koku and put him on watch.\"    The giant listened carefully to Tom's simple instructions.    \"If any bad men come in the night, Koku,\" said the young inventor,  \"you catch them!\"    \"Yes, master, me catch!\" said Koku, grimly. \"Me catch!\" and he  stretched out his powerful arms, and clenched his big hands in a  way that boded no good to evildoers.    Nothing was said to Mr. Swift, to Mrs. Baggert, or to Eradicate  about what had happened, for Tom did not want to worry them. The  burglar alarms were set, Koku took his place where he could watch  the signals, and at the same time be ready to rush out, for,  somehow, Tom had an idea that the men who had attacked him would  come back.    Tom and Ned occupied adjoining rooms, and soon were ready for bed.  But, somehow, Tom could not sleep. He lay awake, tossing from side  to side, and, in spite of his resolution not to think about his  photo telephone invention, his mind ran on nothing but that.    \"I can't see what next to do to make it work,\" he told himself,  over and over again. \"Something is wrong--but what?\"    At length he fell into a fitful doze, and he had a wild dream that  he was sliding down hill on a big mirror in which all sorts of  reflections were seen--reflections that he could not get to show  in the selenium plates.    Then Tom felt the mirror bobbing up and down like a motor boat in  a storm. He felt the vibration, and he heard a voice calling in  his ear:    \"Get up, Tom! Get up!\"    \"Yes! What is it?\" he sleepily exclaimed,    \"Hush!\" was the caution he heard, and then he realized that his  dream had been caused by Ned shaking him.    \"Well?\" whispered Tom, in tense tones.    \"Midnight visitors!\" answered his chum \"The burglar alarm has just  gone off! The airship hangar drop fell. Koku has gone out. Come  on!\"            CHAPTER XI    THE AIRSHIP IS TAKEN      Tom leaped silently out of bed, and stood for a moment half  dazed, so soundly had he been sleeping.    \"Come on!\" urged Ned softly, realizing that his chum had not fully  comprehended. \"Koku will hold them until we get there. I haven't  roused anyone else.\"    \"That's right,\" whispered Tom, as he began putting on his clothes.  \"I don't want father to know. When did it happen?\"    \"Just a little while ago. I couldn't sleep very well, but I fell  into a doze, and then I heard the buzzer of the alarm go off. I  saw that the drop, showing that the hangar had been entered, had  fallen. I got to the window in time to see Koku going toward the  shed from his little coop. Then I came to you.\"    \"Glad you did,\" answered Tom. \"I didn't think I was sleeping so  soundly.\"    Together the two chums made their way from their rooms down the  dimly-lighted hall to a side door, whence they could reach the  airship hangar, or shed.    \"Won't we need something--a gun or--\" began Ned.    \"Clubs are better--especially at night when you can't see to aim  very well,\" whispered back Tom. \"I've got a couple of good ones  downstairs. I could use my electric rifle, and set it merely to  disable temporarily whoever the charge hit, but it's a little too  risky. Koku has a habit of getting in the way at the most  unexpected times. He's so big, you know. I think clubs will be  best.\"    \"All right, Tom, just as you say,\" agreed Ned. \"But who do you  think it can be?\"    \"I haven't the least idea. Probably the same fellows who were  after me before, though. This time I'll find out what their game  is, and what they're after.\"    The chums reached the lower hall, and there Tom picked out two  African war clubs which he had brought back with him from one of  his many trips into wild lands.    \"These are just the thing!\" exclaimed Ned, swinging his about.    \"Careful,\" cautioned Tom, \"If you hit something you'll rouse the  house, and I don't want my father and Mrs. Baggert, to say nothing  of Eradicate, awakened.\"    \"Excuse me,\" murmured Ned. \"But we'd better be getting a move on.\"    \"That's right,\" agreed Tom. He dropped into a side pocket a small  but powerful electric flash lamp, and then he and Ned let  themselves out.    There had been a bright moon, but it was now overcast by clouds.  However, there was sufficient light to enable the two lads to see  objects quite clearly. All about them were the various buildings  that made up the manufacturing and experimental plant of Tom Swift  and his father. Farthest away from the house was the big shed  where once Tom had kept a balloon, but which was now given over to  his several airships. In front of it was a big, level grassy  space, needed to enable the aircraft to get a \"running start\"  before they could mount into the clouds.    \"See anything of Koku?\" whispered Ned.    \"No,\" answered Tom, in the same cautious voice. \"I guess he must  be hiding--\"    \"There he goes now!\" hissed Ned, pointing to a big figure that was  approaching the hangar. It was undoubtedly that of the giant, and  he could be seen, in the dim light, stalking cautiously along.    \"I wonder where the uninvited guests are?\" asked Tom.    \"Probably in the airship shed,\" answered Ned. \"Koku was after them  as soon as the alarm went off, and they couldn't have gotten away.  They must be inside there yet."]]]
