Through the mortal life and sacrificial death of  our Lord Jesus Christ the demands of justice have been fully met, and  the way is opened for the lawful ministration of mercy so far as the  effects of the Fall are concerned.    Sin, followed by death, came into the world through the transgression  of one man. The entailment of mortality upon that man's posterity, with  all its elements of a fallen state, is natural, we say, because we  think we know something about heredity. Is it any more truly natural  that one man's transgression should be of universal effect than that  the redeeming and saving achievement of One, fully empowered and  qualified for the work of atonement, should be of universal blessing?  The ancient Apostles were explicit in answer. Thus spake Paul:  \"Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to  condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came  upon all men unto justification of life.\" (Rom. 5:18). And further:  \"For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man  Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all.\" (1 Tim. 2:5-6).    Christ, victor over sin and death, established His right to prescribe  the conditions under which man may attain salvation, and these are  summarized as obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel. That  the physical, mental, and spiritual agony preceding and accompanying  the crucifixion was real and necessary to the accomplishment of His  fore-appointed mission has been affirmed by the Christ in the current  dispensation: \"For behold I, God, have suffered these things for all,  that they might not suffer if they would repent; but if they would not  repent, they must suffer even as I. Which suffering caused myself, even  God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at  every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit: and would that I might  not drink the bitter cup and shrink--Nevertheless, glory be to the  Father, and I partook and finished my preparation unto the children of  men. Wherefore, I command you again to repent.\" (D&C 19:16-20).        -- 15 --    HOW DOES CHRIST SAVE?    His Plan Combines Justice and Mercy    THE results of the Atonement accomplished by the Lord Jesus Christ  comprise (1) universal deliverance from bodily death, that is to say  the assured resurrection of all the dead, and (2) deliverance from the  effects of individual sin.    It is but just that since death has been entailed upon the entire race  through the act of our first parents, redemption therefrom should  be likewise universal, without effort or sacrifice on our part.  We shall each be resurrected from death, our disembodied spirits  tabernacling again in their bodies of flesh and bones, whether we  be relatively clean, or filthy from sin; but the time or order of  our respective liberation from the grave will be determined by our  state of righteousness or guilt. So the Scriptures aver. (See e. g.  John 5:28-29; 1 Cor. 15:23; Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 9:6-13; and D&C  88:96-102.)    Herein is a lawful adjustment between justice and mercy. We are mortal  through no personal fault; we shall be made immortal without personal  merit. Such is justice. And though many have committed crimes far  more heinous than Adam's disobedience, even they shall eventually be  absolved from their hereditary mortality. Such is mercy.    The Divine plan of salvation, made effective through the Atonement,  is likewise of universal application, so that every man may become a  beneficiary thereof; but that plan is not self-operative. The Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints summarizes the conditions in this  wise:    \"We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for  Adam's transgression.    \"We believe that, through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be  saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.\"    However great his moral weakness and sinful tendencies entailed by  heredity, every responsible individual knows right from wrong, with  some degree of conviction; and in the final judgment of that soul every  element, whether of extenuation or crimination, will be taken into  due account. Means of making amends for sin, and thereby establishing  eligibility as fit subjects for remission or forgiveness, are freely  offered to all men; but the prescribed conditions must be complied with  or the incubus of sin can not be lifted.    Salvation is not to be had for the mere asking. It is too precious  a pearl to be wantonly cast at the feet of the unrepentant and  unregenerate who, heedless of its eternal worth, would fain tread it  into the mire wherein they wallow. Christ's plan for saving the souls  of men contemplates no universal and unconditional remission of sins.  That would be justice travestied and mercy corrupted. So far as I am  personally responsible for sin, I, and I alone am accountable. This is  just. But though I make all material restitution possible to my brother  whom I may have wronged, I cannot alone wipe the stain of guilt from  my soul. To obtain remission from God whose laws I have violated, to  be again reconciled to Him through expiation for my transgression, I  am in dire need of help. That help is provided through obedience to  the laws and ordinances of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I am not left  without hope; but on the contrary have the Divine assurance of possible  emancipation. This is mercy, indeed.    \"He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that  believeth not shall be damned.\" (Mark 16:16). So spake the Christ. The  belief here specified must mean that active, vital, potent belief which  we distinctively designate faith. A mere assent of the mind to any  proposition, without application and action, remains a mental concept  and nothing more. Our Lord's association of belief with baptism is  proof that no empty or idle belief can avail to save. Genuine faith in  the Lord Jesus Christ naturally leads to obedience to His commands; and  the firstfruits of faith are embodied in repentance. None but the truly  repentant believer is an acceptable subject for baptism.    Thus no man can consistently hope for salvation in the Kingdom of God  except through the Atonement of Jesus Christ; and the Atonement is made  operative for the remission of sins through individual compliance with  the conditions explicitly set forth by \"the author of eternal salvation  unto all them that obey him.\" (Heb. 5:9). Christ's method of saving  souls is that of providing definite means, which any one may accept or  reject to his own eternal gain or loss.    Universal amnesty for crime may serve to increase crime. God's system  of benevolence, which comprises and exceeds all that we call charity,  consists in helping sinners to help themselves. Indiscriminate giving  fosters pauperism in both the temporal and the spiritual sense. Man  alone cannot save himself; and just as truly, Christ alone cannot save  him. Obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel is the price of  salvation.    An ancient Hebrew prophet thus set forth in simplicity the plan of  salvation dependent upon the Atonement of Christ:    \"His blood atoneth for the sins of those who have fallen by the  transgression of Adam, who have died, not knowing the will of God  concerning them, or who have ignorantly sinned. But, wo, wo unto him  who knoweth that he rebelleth against God; for salvation cometh to  none such, except it be through repentance and faith on the Lord Jesus  Christ.\" (Book of Mormon, Mosiah 3:11-12).    In these latter days the Lord hath given this commandment unto the  Church: \"Thou shalt declare repentance and faith on the Savior and  remission of sins by baptism and by fire, yea, even the Holy Ghost.\"  (D&C 19:31.)        -- 16 --    HEAVEN AND HELL    Graded Conditions in the Hereafter    THE destiny of souls in the hereafter is a subject of persistent  interest and concern in human belief and speculation. Even pagan  literature and the languages of heathendom testify to a general though  ofttimes vague conception of two widely separated places or strongly  contrasted states of future existence, which are in the main equivalent  to the heaven and the hell of dogmatic theology.    The Holy Scriptures generalize the future estate of the righteous as  heaven, and the opposite as hell, without giving warrant, however,  for the belief that but two places or kingdoms are provided, to one  or the other of which every soul is to be consigned according to the  balance-sheet of his life's account, and perhaps on a very small margin  of merit or guilt. Equally unscriptural is the inference that the state  of the soul at death determines that soul's place and environment  throughout eternity, forever deprived of opportunity of progression.    When left to his imagination, without the guidance of revelation, man  conjures up a heaven and a hell to suit his fancy. Thus, to the mind  of the savage, heaven is a hunting-ground with game a-plenty; to the  carnal, heaven promises perpetual gratification of senses and passions;  to the lover of truth and the devotee of righteousness, heaven is the  assurance of limitless advancement in wisdom and achievement. And to  each of these, hell is the eternal realization of deprivation, loss,  disappointment and consequent anguish.    Divine revelation is the only source of sure knowledge as to what  awaits man beyond the grave, and from this we learn that at death  the spirits of all men pass to an intermediate state, in which they  associate with their kind, the good with the good, the wicked with the  wicked, and so shall endure in happiness or awful suspense until the  time appointed for their resurrection. Paradise is the dwelling"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47192"],[0,"History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Volume 2 (#10)"],[1,"every      principle of justice and equity; and this is demonstrated from      the fact, that when just laws were issued by the king, which were      perfectly equitable, they were so lost to a sense of righteousness      that they disregarded those laws, notwithstanding an obedience to      them would have produced at the time, as regards their own personal      comfort and advantage, the happiest result possible. They were      entirely destitute of harmony and virtue, so much so that virtuous      laws they despised. They had proven themselves unworthy a place      in the joys of the prince, because they had for a series of years      lived in open violation of his government. Certainly, then, those      two classes of men could not hold the reins of the same government      at the same time in peace; for internal jars, broils, and discords      would rack it to the center, were such a form {11} of government      to exist under such a system. The virtuous could not enjoy peace      in the constant and unceasing schemes and evil plans of the      wicked; neither could the wicked have enjoyment in the constant      perseverance of the righteous to do justly. That there must be      an agreement in this government, or it could not stand, must be      admitted by all. Should the king convey the reins into the hands of      the rebellious the government must soon fall; for every government,      from the creation to the present, when it ceased to be virtuous,      and failed to execute justice, sooner or later has been overthrown.      And without virtuous principles to actuate a government all care      for justice is soon lost, and the only motive which prompts it      to act is ambition and selfishness. Should the king admit these      rebels into his house to make them equal with the others, he would      condescend beneath his dignity, because he once issued virtuous      laws which were received by a part of his subjects, and the reward      affixed was a seat at the marriage feast, and an adoption into his      own family as lawful heirs. So that should he now offer any thing      different he would destroy forever that government which he once so      diligently labored to establish and preserve and which he once had      wisdom to organize. Such individuals as the last named, would be      a bane to a virtuous government, and would prove its overthrow if      suffered to hold a part in conducting it.        We take the sacred writings into our hands, and admit that they      were given by direct inspiration for the good of man. We believe      that God condescended to speak from the heavens and declare His      will concerning the human family, to give them just and holy laws,      to regulate their conduct, and guide them in a direct way, that in      due time He might take them to Himself, and make them joint heirs      with His Son. But when this fact is admitted, that the immediate      will of heaven is contained in the scriptures, are we not bound as      rational creatures to live in accordance to all its precepts? Will      the mere admission, that this is the will of heaven ever benefit us      if we do not comply with all his teachings? Do we offer violence to      the Supreme Intelligence of heaven, when we admit the truth of its      teachings, and do not obey them? Do we not descend below our own      knowledge, and the better wisdom which heaven has endowed us with,      by such a course of conduct? For these reasons, if we have direct      revelations given us from heaven, surely those revelations were      never given to be trifled with, without the trifler's incurring      displeasure and vengence upon his own head, if there is any justice      in heaven; and that there is must be admitted by every individual      who admits the truth and force of God's teachings, His blessings      and cursings, as contained in the sacred volume.        Here, then, we have this part of our subject immediately before      us {12} for consideration: God has in reserve a time, or period      appointed in His own bosom, when He will bring all His subjects,      who have obeyed His voice and kept His commandments, into His      celestial rest. This rest is of such perfection and glory, that      man has need of a preparation before he can, according to the laws      of that kingdom, enter it and enjoy its blessings. This being the      fact, God has given certain laws to the human family, which, if      observed, are sufficient to prepare them to inherit this rest.      This, then, we conclude, was the purpose of God in giving His laws      to us: if not, why, or for what were they given? If the whole      family of man were as well off without them as they might be with      them, for what purpose or intent were they ever given? Was it that      God wanted to merely show that He could talk? It would be nonsense      to suppose that He would condescend to talk in vain: for it would      be in vain, and to no purpose whatever [if the law of God were of      no benefit to man]: because, all the commandments contained in      the law of the Lord, have the sure promise annexed of a reward to      all who obey, predicated upon the fact that they are really the      promises of a Being who cannot lie, One who is abundantly able to      fulfill every tittle of His word: and if man were as well prepared,      or could be as well prepared, to meet God without their ever having      been given in the first instance, why were they ever given? for      certainly, in that case they can now do him no good.        As we previously remarked, all well established and properly      organized governments have certain fixed and prominent laws for      the regulation and management of the same. If man has grown to      wisdom and is capable of discerning the propriety of laws to govern      nations, what less can be expected from the Ruler and Upholder of      the universe? Can we suppose that He has a kingdom without laws?      Or do we believe that it is composed of an innumerable company of      beings who are entirely beyond all law? Consequently have need      of nothing to govern or regulate them? Would not such ideas be a      reproach to our Great Parent, and at variance with His glorious      intelligence? Would it not be asserting that man had found out a      secret beyond Deity? That he had learned that it was good to have      laws, while God after existing from eternity and having power to      create man, had not found out that it was proper to have laws for      his government? We admit that God is the great source and fountain      from whence proceeds all good; that He is perfect intelligence,      and that His wisdom is alone sufficient to govern and regulate      the mighty creations and worlds which shine and blaze with such      magnificence and splendor over our heads, as though touched with      His anger and moved by His Almighty word. And if so, it is done      and regulated by law; for without law all must certainly fall into      chaos. If, then, we admit that God is the source of all wisdom and      understanding, we must admit that by His direct inspiration He      has {13} taught man that law is necessary in order to govern and      regulate His own immediate interest and welfare: for this reason,      that law is beneficial to promote peace and happiness among men.      And as before remarked, God is the source from whence proceeds all      good; and if man is benefitted by law, then certainly, law is good;      and if law is good then law, or the principle of it emanated from      God; for God is the source of all good; consequently, then, he was      the first Author of law, or the principle of it, to mankind.        We would remind you, brethren, of the fatigues, trials, privations,      and persecutions, which the ancient saints endured for the sole      purpose of persuading men of the excellence and propriety of the      faith of Christ, were it in our opinion necessary, or if it would      serve in any respect to stimulate you to labor in the vineyard of      the Lord with any more diligence. But we have reason to believe (if      you make the holy Scriptures a sufficient part of your studies),      that their perseverance is known to you all; as also that they      were willing to sacrifice the present honors and pleasures of      this world, that they might obtain an assurance of a crown of      life from the hand of our Lord; and their excellent example in      labor, which manifests their zeal to us in the cause which they      embraced, you are daily striving to pattern. And not only these      examples of the Saints, but the commandments of our Lord, we hope      are constantly revolving in your hearts, teaching you, not only His      will in proclaiming His Gospel, but His meekness and perfect walk      before all, even in those times of severe persecutions and abuse      which were heaped upon him by a wicked and adulterous generation.      Remember, brethren, that He has called you unto holiness; and need      we say, to be like Him in purity? How wise, how holy; how chaste,      and how perfect, then, you ought to conduct yourselves in His      sight; and remember, too, that His eyes are continually upon you.      Viewing these facts in a proper light, you cannot be insensible,      that without a strict observance of all His divine requirements,      you may, at least, be found wanting; and if so, you will admit,      that your lot will be cast among the unprofitable servants. We      beseech you, therefore, brethren, to improve upon all things      committed to your charge, that you lose not your reward.        No doubt, the course which we pursued in our last communication to      you, is yet familiar to your minds; that we there endeavored to      show, as far as possible, the propriety, in part, of adhering to      the law of heaven; and also, the consistency in"]]]
