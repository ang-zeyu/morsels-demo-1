Grades of Celestial Glory.--The Prophet also taught that there are  grades of glory, even in the celestial kingdom; his exact language  being: \"In the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees\" (D&C  131:1).        CHAPTER V.    Water and Spirit Birth.    The Initial Ceremony.--As faith is the first principle of the gospel  of Christ, so baptism is the initial ceremony. Baptism is twofold,  corresponding to the soul, its subject, which is both spiritual and  temporal. It signifies for that soul rebirth and illumination.    \"Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\"    \"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into  the kingdom of God\" (John 3:3,5).    So said the King of that kingdom, the only One empowered to prescribe  conditions upon which men might become his subjects, or his fellow  citizens, in that heavenly common-wealth where he shines first and  foremost among the sons of God.    Jesus to Nicodemus.--Jesus, when he uttered those words, was speaking  to Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews, a Pharisee, and, as some suppose,  a member of the Sanhedrim. Favorably inclined toward the unpopular  Nazarene, yet too politic to be seen associating with him openly,  Nicodemus came to him by night, avowing a belief that he was \"a teacher  come from God.\" In response to this confession of faith, Jesus taught  Nicodemus the doctrine embodied in the lines I have quoted.    A Subject of Controversy.--\"Except a man be born of water and of the  Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\" Probably no theme  connected with the gospel of Christ has caused more controversy than  this positive and important declaration, the meaning of which, however  plain to Christians anciently, has been a matter of uncertainty to  their successors all down the centuries. From the days of the early  Greek fathers of the Christian Church, to the days of St. Augustine,  the great theologian of the Western or Roman Catholic division of that  church; from his time to the time of Luther and Calvin, and thence on  into the present age, men have disputed over the significance of those  sacred words, over the mystical birth of water and of spirit, declared  by the world's Redeemer to be the doorway to his Church, the portal of  admittance into his kingdom.    What is Baptism?--Over the general meaning of the phrase, \"born of  water and of the Spirit,\" there may have been no serious contention. In  all or most of the Christian denominations, Catholic and Protestant,  that phrase means baptism, the ordinance whereby a person is initiated  into the Church. But what does baptism mean? That is the problem. The  significance, form, purpose, and effects of the ordinance, and whether  or not it is necessary to salvation--these questions have furnished  the backbone of the controversy. And yet they are questions easily  answered, problems readily solved, if we take the Holy Spirit for our  guide, and wrest not the Scriptures.    The Savior's Example.--The New Testament teaches plainly the necessity  of baptism. The words of Jesus, already quoted, may be reinforced by  the following passages:    \"Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of  him.    \"But John forbade Him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and  comest thou to me?    \"And Jesus, answering, said unto him: Suffer it to be so now, for thus  it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.\"  (Matthew 3:13-15.)    A Universal Requirement.--If it was becoming in the Son of God to be  baptized, it is becoming in all who follow in his footsteps and hope  to be with him hereafter. They must be baptized with the baptism that  he was baptized with--not only the baptism of suffering, through which  \"the captain of our salvation\" was \"made perfect,\" but the baptism of  water and of spirit, received by him at the River Jordan, nineteen  centuries ago.    King and Subject.--Can you conceive of a kingdom in which the king  is required to obey the laws ordained for its government, while his  subjects are not required to obey them? Far more likely, is it not,  that the king, rather than the subject, would be exempt from such  obedience? But the laws of God's kingdom are just and impartial,  bearing with equal pressure upon all. \"The Son doeth nothing but what  he hath seen the Father do;\" nor does he require of us what he himself  is not willing to render. \"Follow me,\" is the watchward of his mission,  and it applies to baptism as much as to anything.    To Fulfil All Righteousness.--True, baptism is \"for the remission  of sins\" (Mark 1:4; Acts 2:38) and Jesus \"grew up without sin unto  salvation.\" Hence, there was no sin in him to remit. Why, then, was he  baptized? John saw this point when Jesus presented himself for baptism:  \"I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?\" While we  cannot impute sin to the sinless, and say that Jesus was baptized, like  an ordinary man, for the remission of his sins, we can and should take  him at his word, that it was becoming in him, and is becoming in us, to  be baptized, in order \"to fulfil all righteousness.\"    Necessity of Baptism Not Obviated by Christ's Baptism.--Some hold that  Jesus was baptized vicariously for original sin, the sin of the world,  resulting from the transgression of Adam. That load of guilt, it is  argued, had to be remitted, and hence the Savior, who had taken the  burden upon him, was baptized that it might be washed away. I cannot  vouch for the correctness of that view; but this I know: The baptism  of Jesus did not obviate the necessity of baptism, any more than his  suffering of the pangs of every man, woman and child (2 Ne.9:21, 22),  did away with human suffering. Men still suffer, notwithstanding that  infinite atonement--necessary, in order that the resurrection might  pass upon all men. And they must still be baptized for the remission  of their own sins, notwithstanding the baptism of \"the Lamb of God,  which taketh away the sin of the world\" (John 1:29). Christ plainly  taught, after his own baptism, the necessity of baptism as a universal  requirement, obligatory upon all capable of faith and repentance.    Little Children Exempt.--The only class exempt are infants, or children  young enough to be without sin. Obviously they cannot repent, and are  therefore not fit subjects for baptism. Jesus said: \"Suffer the little  children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the  kingdom of heaven.\" Again: \"Except ye humble yourselves and become as  this little child, ye shall in no wise enter the kingdom of heaven.\"  This shows not only that little children are sinless, but that they  are types of the innocence and purity required of men and women, who,  because not sinless, must be baptized and have their sins remitted,  before they can enter into that kingdom where no sin, no uncleanness,  can come. For this cause--that men and women must \"become as little  children\" before entering there--baptism, the doorway, is compared to a  birth, the entry of an infant into life. For this reason also, converts  to Christ in ancient times were referred to as \"new-born babes.\" Peter  so styled them (2:2); and the first principles of the gospel, those  easiest to comprehend, to mentally digest, were termed both by him and  by Paul, \"the milk of the word,\" in contradistinction to \"the meat of  the word\"--advanced principles and mysteries (1 Pet. 2:2; Heb. 5:12-14;  1 Cor. 3:2). The effect of baptism is to make men childlike, not in  ignorance, nor in physical weakness, but in innocence and humility.    Mormon to Moroni.--Upon this theme Mormon writes thus to his son  Moroni, voicing the word of the Lord:    \"Listen to the words of Christ, your Redeemer, your Lord and your God.  Behold, I came into the world not to call the righteous, but sinners  to repentance; the whole need no physician, but they that are sick;  wherefore little children are whole, for they are not capable of  committing sin; wherefore the curse of Adam is taken from them in me,  that it hath no power over them; and the law of circumcision is done  away in me.    \"And after this manner did the Holy Ghost manifest the word of God unto  me; wherefore my beloved son, I know that it is solemn mockery before  God, that ye should baptize little children.    \"Behold, I say unto you, that this thing shall ye teach, repentance and  baptism unto those who are accountable and capable of committing sin;  yea, teach parents that they must repent, and be baptized, and humble  themselves as their little children. * * *    \"Little children cannot repent; wherefore it is awful wickedness to  deny the pure mercies of God unto them, for they are alive in him  because of his mercy. * * * The power of redemption cometh on all them  that have no law; wherefore, he that is not condemned, or he that is  under no condemnation, cannot repent; and unto such baptism availeth  nothing.\" (Moroni 8:8-10, 19, 22.)    Children Become Accountable.--As children advance in years, however,  they become accountable, and then, like adults, they must yield  obedience to the requirements of the gospel. The Lord explained this  matter to Adam in these words:    \"Inasmuch as thy children are conceived in sin, even so when they begin  to grow up, sin"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5061"],[0,"The Children's Book of Christmas Stories (#10)"],[1," an hour, when the sun should be fairly set; but it did not  feel like Christmas, for the afternoon was mild and sweet, and the wind  in the leafless boughs sang, as it moved about, as though to imitate  the vanished birds. Soft trills and whistles, odd little shakes and  twitters--it was astonishing what pretty noises the wind made, for it  was in good humor, as winds should be on the Blessed Night; all its  storm-tones and bass-notes were for the moment laid aside, and gently as  though hushing a baby to sleep, it cooed and rustled and brushed to and  fro in the leafless woods.    Toinette stood, pitcher in hand, beside the well. \"Wishing Well,\" the  people called it, for they believed that if any one standing there bowed  to the East, repeated a certain rhyme and wished a wish, the wish would  certainly come true. Unluckily, nobody knew exactly what the rhyme  should be. Toinette did not; she was wishing that she did, as she stood  with her eyes fixed on the bubbling water. How nice it would be! she  thought. What beautiful things should be hers, if it were only to  wish and to have. She would be beautiful, rich, good--oh, so good.  The children should love her dearly, and never be disagreeable. Mother  should not work so hard--they should all go back to France--which mother  said was si belle. Oh, dear, how nice it would be. Meantime, the sun  sank lower, and mother at home was waiting for the water, but Toinette  forgot that.    Suddenly she started. A low sound of crying met her ear, and something  like a tiny moan. It seemed close by but she saw nothing.    Hastily she filled her pitcher and turned to go. But again the sound  came, an unmistakable sob, right under her feet. Toinette stopped short.    \"What is the matter?\" she called out bravely. \"Is anybody there? and if  there is, why don't I see you?\"    A third sob--and all at once, down on the ground beside her, a tiny  figure became visible, so small that Toinette had to kneel and stoop  her head to see it plainly. The figure was that of an odd little man. He  wore a garb of green bright and glancing as the scales of a beetle. In  his mite of a hand was a cap, out of which stuck a long pointed feather.  Two specks of tears stood on his cheeks and he fixed on Toinette a  glance so sharp and so sad that it made her feel sorry and frightened  and confused all at once.    \"Why how funny this is!\" she said, speaking to herself out loud.    \"Not at all,\" replied the little man, in a voice as dry and crisp as  the chirr of a grasshopper. \"Anything but funny. I wish you wouldn't use  such words. It hurts my feelings, Toinette.\"    \"Do you know my name, then?\" cried Toinette, astonished. \"That's  strange. But what is the matter? Why are you crying so, little man?\"    \"I'm not a little man. I'm an elf,\" responded the dry voice; \"and I  think you'd cry if you had an engagement out to tea, and found yourself  spiked on a great bayonet, so that you couldn't move an inch. Look!\" He  turned a little as he spoke and Toinette saw a long rose-thorn sticking  through the back of the green robe. The little man could by no means  reach the thorn, and it held him fast prisoner to the place.    \"Is that all? I'll take it out for you,\" she said.    \"Be careful--oh, be careful,\" entreated the little man. \"This is my  new dress, you know--my Christmas suit, and it's got to last a year. If  there is a hole in it, Peascod will tickle me and Bean Blossom tease,  till I shall wish myself dead.\" He stamped with vexation at the thought.    \"Now, you mustn't do that,\" said Toinette, in a motherly tone, \"else  you'll tear it yourself, you know.\" She broke off the thorn as she  spoke, and gently drew it out. The elf anxiously examined the stuff. A  tiny puncture only was visible and his face brightened.    \"You're a good child,\" he said. \"I'll do as much for you some day,  perhaps.\"    \"I would have come before if I had seen you,\" remarked Toinette,  timidly. \"But I didn't see you a bit.\"    \"No, because I had my cap on,\" cried the elf. He placed it on his head  as he spoke, and hey, presto! nobody was there, only a voice which  laughed and said: \"Well--don't stare so. Lay your finger on me now.\"    \"Oh,\" said Toinette, with a gasp. \"How wonderful. What fun it must be  to do that. The children wouldn't see me. I should steal in and surprise  them; they would go on talking, and never guess that I was there. I  should so like it. Do elves ever lend their caps to anybody? I wish  you'd lend me yours. It must be so nice to be invisible.\"    \"Ho,\" cried the elf, appearing suddenly again. \"Lend my cap, indeed!  Why it wouldn't stay on the very tip of your ear, it's so small. As for  nice, that depends. Sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn't. No, the  only way for mortal people to be invisible is to gather the fern-seed  and put it in their shoes.\"    \"Gather it? Where? I never saw any seed to the ferns,\" said Toinette,  staring about her.    \"Of course not--we elves take care of that,\" replied the little man.  \"Nobody finds the fern-seed but ourselves. I'll tell you what, though.  You were such a nice child to take out the thorn so cleverly, that  I'll give you a little of the seed. Then you can try the fun of being  invisible, to your heart's content.\"    \"Will you really? How delightful. May I have it now?\"    \"Bless me. Do you think I carry my pockets stuffed with it?\" said the  elf. \"Not at all. Go home, say not a word to any one, but leave your  bedroom window open to night, and you'll see what you'll see.\"    He laid his finger on his nose as he spoke, gave a jump like a  grasshopper, clapping on his cap as he went, and vanished. Toinette  lingered a moment, in hopes that he might come back, then took her  pitcher and hurried home. The woods were very dusky by this time; but  full of her strange adventures, she did not remember to feel afraid.    \"How long you have been,\" said her mother. \"It's late for a little maid  like you to be up. You must make better speed another time, my child.\"    Toinette pouted as she was apt to do when reproved. The children  clamoured to know what had kept her, and she spoke pettishly and  crossly; so that they too became cross, and presently went away into the  outer kitchen to play by themselves. The children were apt to creep away  when Toinette came. It made her angry and unhappy at times that they  should do so, but she did not realize that it was in great part her own  fault, and so did not set herself to mend it.    \"Tell me a 'tory,\" said baby Jeanneton, creeping to her knee a little  later. But Toinette's head was full of the elf; she had no time to spare  for Jeanneton.    \"Oh, not to-night,\" she replied. \"Ask mother to tell you one.\"    \"Mother's busy,\" said Jeanneton wistfully.    Toinette took no notice and the little one crept away disconsolately.    Bedtime at last. Toinette set the casement open, and lay a long time  waiting and watching; then she fell asleep. She waked with a sneeze and  jump and sat up in bed. Behold, on the coverlet stood her elfin friend,  with a long train of other elves beside him, all clad in the beetle-wing  green, and wearing little pointed caps. More were coming in at the  window; outside a few were drifting about in the moon rays, which lit  their sparkling robes till they glittered like so many fireflies. The  odd thing was, that though the caps were on, Toinette could see the  elves distinctly and this surprised her so much, that again she thought  out loud and said, \"How funny.\"    \"You mean about the caps,\" replied her special elf, who seemed to have  the power of reading thought.    \"Yes, you can see us to-night, caps and all. Spells lose their value on  Christmas Eve, always. Peascod, where is the box? Do you still wish to  try the experiment of being invisible, Toinette?\"    \"Oh, yes--indeed I do.\"    \"Very well; so let it be.\"    As he spoke he beckoned, and two elves puffing and panting like little  men with a heavy load, dragged forward a droll little box about the size  of a pumpkin-seed.    One of them lifted the cover.    \"Pay the porter, please, ma'am,\" he said giving Toinette's ear a  mischievous tweak with his sharp fingers.    \"Hands off, you bad Peascod!\" cried Toinette's elf. \"This is my girl.  She shan't be pinched!\" He dealt Peascod a blow with his tiny hand as  he spoke and looked so brave and warlike that he seemed at least an inch  taller than he had before. Toinette admired him very much; and Peascod  slunk away with an abashed giggle muttering that Thistle needn't be so  ready with his fist.    Thistle--for thus, it seemed, Toinette's friend was named--dipped his  fingers in the box, which was full of fine brown seeds, and shook a  handful into each of Toinette's shoes, as they stood, toes together by  the bedside.    \"Now you have your wish,\" he said, \"and can go about and do what you  like, no one seeing. The charm will end at sunset. Make the most of it  while you can; but if you want to end it sooner, shake the seeds from  the shoes and then you are just as usual.\"    \"Oh, I shan't want to,\" protested Toinette; \"I'm sure I shan't.\"    \"Good-bye,\" said Thistle, with a mocking little laugh.    \"Good-bye, and thank you ever so much,\" replied Toinette.    \"Good-bye, good-bye,\" replied the other elves, in shrill chorus. They  clustered together, as if in consultation; then straight out of the  window they flew like a swarm of gauzy-winged bees, and melted into the  moonlight. Toinette jumped up and ran to watch them but the little men  were gone--not a trace of them was to be seen; so she shut the window,  went back to bed and presently in the midst of her amazed and excited  thoughts fell asleep.    She waked in the morning, with a queer, doubtful feeling. Had she  dreamed, or had it really happened? She put on her best petticoat and  laced her blue bodice; for she thought the mother would perhaps take  them across the wood to the little chapel for the Christmas service. Her  long "]]]
