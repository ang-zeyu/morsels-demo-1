I embarked at Cenchreae in a fifty-oared  Samian vessel, the best ship that ever was built.    \"It does not surprise me that I am the first Greek to arrive in  Naukratis. We encountered terrific storms at sea, and could not have  escaped with our lives, if the big-bellied Samian galley, with her Ibis  beak and fish's tail had not been so splendidly timbered and manned.    \"How far the other homeward-bound passengers may have been driven out  of their course, I cannot tell; we found shelter in the harbor of Samos,  and were able to put to sea again after ten days.    \"We ran into the mouth of the Nile this morning. I went on board my own  bark at once, and was so favored by Boreas, who at least at the end of  my voyage, seemed willing to prove that he still felt kindly towards his  old Kallias, that I caught sight of this most friendly of all houses a  few moments since. I saw the waving flag, the brightly lighted windows,  and debated within myself whether to enter or not; but Rhodopis, your  fascination proved irresistible, and besides, I was bursting with all  my untold news, longing to share your feast, and to tell you, over the  viands and the wine, things that you have not even allowed yourselves to  dream of.\"    Kallias settled himself comfortably on one of the cushions, and before  beginning to tell his news, produced and presented to Rhodopis a  magnificent gold bracelet in the form of a serpent's, which he had  bought for a large sum at Samos, in the goldsmith's workshop of the very  Theodorus who was now sitting with him at table.    \"This I have brought for you,\"' he said, turning to the delighted  Rhodopis, \"but for you, friend Phanes, I have something still better.  Guess, who won the four-horse chariot-race?\"    \"An Athenian?\" asked Phanes, and his face glowed with excitement; for  the victory gained by one citizen at the Olympic games belonged to his  whole people, and the Olympic olive-branch was the greatest honor and  happiness that could fall to the lot, either of a single Hellene, or an  entire Greek tribe.    \"Rightly guessed, Phanes!\" cried the bringer of this joyful news, \"The  first prize has been carried off by an Athenian; and not only so, your  own cousin Cimon, the son of Kypselos, the brother of that Miltiades,  who, nine Olympiads ago, earned us the same honor, is the man who has  conquered this year; and with the same steeds that gained him the prize  at the last games.       [The second triumph won by the steeds of Cimon must have taken     place, as Duneker correctly remarks, about the year 528. The same     horses won the race for the third time at the next Olympic games,     consequently four years later. As token of his gratitude Cimon     caused a monument to be erected in their honor in \"the hollow way\"     near Athens. We may here remind our readers that the Greeks made     use of the Olympic games to determine the date of each year. They     took place every four years. The first was fixed 776 B. C. Each     separate year was named the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th of such or such an     Olympiad.]    \"The fame of the Alkmaeonidae is, verily, darkening more and more before  the Philaidae. Are not you proud, Phanes? do not you feel joy at the  glory of your family?\"    In his delight Phanes had risen from his seat, and seemed suddenly to  have increased in stature by a whole head.    With a look of ineffable pride and consciousness of his own position,  he gave his hand to the messenger of victory. The latter, embracing his  countryman, continued:    \"Yes, we have a right to feel proud and happy, Phanes; you especially,  for no sooner had the judges unanimously awarded the prize to Cimon,  than he ordered the heralds to proclaim the tyrant Pisistratus as  the owner of the splendid team, and therefore victor in the race.  Pisistratus at once caused it to be announced that your family was free  to return to Athens, and so now, Phanes, the long-wished for hour of  your return home is awaiting you.\"    But at these words Phanes turned pale, his look of conscious pride  changed into one of indignation, and he exclaimed:    \"At this I am to rejoice, foolish Kallias? rather bid me weep that a  descendant of Ajax should be capable of laying his well-won fame thus  ignominiously at a tyrant's feet! No! I swear by Athene, by Father Zeus,  and by Apollo, that I will sooner starve in foreign lands than take one  step homeward, so long as the Pisistratidae hold my country in bondage.  When I leave the service of Amasis, I shall be free, free as a bird in  the air; but I would rather be the slave of a peasant in foreign lands,  than hold the highest office under Pisistratus. The sovereign power in  Athens belongs to us, its nobles; but Cimon by laying his chaplet at the  feet of Pisistratus has acknowledged the tyrants, and branded himself as  their servant. He shall hear that Phanes cares little for the tyrant's  clemency. I choose to remain an exile till my country is free, till her  nobles and people govern themselves, and dictate their own laws. Phanes  will never do homage to the oppressor, though all the Philaidae, the  Alkmaeonidae, and even the men of your own house, Kallias, the rich  Daduchi, should fall down at his feet!\"    With flashing eyes he looked round on the assembly; Kallias too  scrutinized the faces of the guests with conscious pride, as if he would  say:    \"See, friends, the kind of men produced by my glorious country!\"    Taking the hand of Phanes again, he said to him: \"The tyrants are as  hateful to me as to you, my friend; but I have seen, that, so long  as Pisistratus lives, the tyranny cannot be overthrown. His allies,  Lygdamis of Naxos and Polykrates of Samos, are powerful; but the  greatest danger for our freedom lies in his own moderation and prudence.  During my recent stay in Greece I saw with alarm that the mass of the  people in Athens love their oppressor like a father. Notwithstanding  his great power, he leaves the commonwealth in the enjoyment of Solon's  constitution. He adorns the city with the most magnificent buildings.  They say that the new temple of Zeus, now being built of glorious marble  by Kallaeschrus, Antistates and Porinus (who must be known to you,  Theodorus), will surpass every building that has yet been erected by the  Hellenes. He understands how to attract poets and artists of all kinds  to Athens, he has had the poems of Homer put into writing, and the  prophecies of Musaeus collected by Onomakritus. He lays out new streets  and arranges fresh festivals; trade flourishes under his rule, and the  people find themselves well off, in spite of the many taxes laid upon  them. But what are the people? a vulgar multitude who, like the gnats,  fly towards every thing brilliant, and, so long as the taper burns, will  continue to flutter round it, even though they burn their wings in doing  so. Let Pisistratus' torch burn out, Phanes, and I'll swear that the  fickle crowd will flock around the returning nobles, the new light, just  as they now do around the tyrant.    \"Give me your hand once more, you true son of Ajax; for you, my friends,  I have still many an interesting piece of news untold.    \"The chariot-race, as I have just related, was won by Cimon who gave  the olive-branch to Pisistratus. Four finer horses than his I never  saw. Arkesilaus of Cyrene, Kleosthenes of Epidamnus, Aster of Sybaris,  Hekataeus of Miletus and many more had also sent splendid teams. Indeed  the games this time were more than brilliant. All Hellas had sent  deputies. Rhoda of the Ardeates, in distant Iberia, the wealthy  Tartessus, Sinope in the far East on the shores of Pontus, in short,  every tribe that could boast of Hellenic descent was well represented.  The Sybarite deputies were of a dazzling beauty; the Spartans, homely  and simple, but handsome as Achilles, tall and strong as Hercules; the  Athenians remarkable for their supple limbs and graceful movements,  and the men of Crotona were led by Milo, strongest of mortal birth. The  Samian and Milesian deputies vied in splendor and gorgeousness of attire  with those from Corinth and Mitylene: the flower of the Greek youth was  assembled there, and, in the space allotted to spectators, were seated,  not only men of every age, class and nation, but many virgins, fair and  lovely maidens, who had come to Olympia, more especially from Sparta,  in order to encourage the men during the games by their acclamations and  applause. The market was set up beyond the Alphaeus, and there traders  from all parts of the world were to be seen; Greeks, Carthaginians,  Lydians, Phrygians and shrewd Phoenicians from Palestine settled weighty  business transactions, or offered their goods to the public from tents  and booths. But how can I possibly describe to you the surging throngs  of the populace, the echoing choruses, the smoking festal hecatombs, the  bright and variegated costumes, the sumptuousness of the equipages, the  clang of the different dialects and the joyful cries of friends meeting  again after years of separation; or the splendid appearance of the  envoys, the crowds of lookers-on and venders of small wares, the  brilliant effect produced by the masses of spectators, who filled to  overflowing the space allotted to them, the eager suspense during the  progress of the games, and the never ending shouts of joy when the  victory was decided; the solemn investiture with the olive-branch,  cut with a golden knife by the Elean boy, (whose parents must both be  living), from the sacred tree in the Altis planted so many centuries ago  by Hercules himself; or lastly, the prolonged acclamations which,  like peals of thunder, resounded in the Stadium, when Milo of Crotona  appeared, bearing on his shoulders the bronze statue of himself cast by  Dameas, and carried it through the Stadium into the Altis without"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5529"],[0,"The Bride of the Nile — Complete (#10)"],[1,"Abyla, whom you  fell upon like wolves in a sheepfold? You--you and Compassionate!\" The  vehement girl, to whom no one had ever shown any pity, and on whose  soul the word had fallen like a mockery, who for long hours had been  suffering suppressed and torturing misery, felt it a relief to give free  vent to the anguish of her soul; she ended with a hard laugh, and waved  her hand round her head as though to disperse a swarm of gadflies.    What a woman!    Orion's gaze was fixed on her in horror--but in enchantment. Yes, his  mother had judged her rightly. No gentle, tender-hearted woman laughed  like that; but she was grand, splendid, wonderful in her wrath. She  reminded him of the picture of the goddess of vengeance, by Apelles,  which he had seen in Constantinople. His mother shrugged her shoulders  and cast a meaning glance at the widow, and even his father was startled  at the sight. He knew what had roused her; still he felt that he could  not permit this, and he recalled the excited girl to her senses by  speaking her name, half-reproachfully and half-regretfully, at first  quite gently but then louder and more severely.    She started like a sleep-walker suddenly awaked from her trance, passed  her hand over her eyes, and said, as she bowed her head before the  governor:    \"Forgive me, Uncle, I am sorry for what has occurred--but it was  too much for me. You know what my past has been, and when I am  reminded--when I must listen to the praises even of the wretches to whom  my father and brother....\"    A loud sob interrupted her; little Mary was clinging to her and weeping.  Orion could hardly keep himself from hastening to her and clasping her  in his arms. Ah, how well her woman's weakness became the noble girl!  How strongly it drew him to her!    But Paula soon recovered from it; even while the governor was soothing  her with kind words she mastered her violent agitation, and said gently,  though her tears still quietly flowed: \"Let me go to my room, I beg....\"    \"Good-night, then, child,\" said the Mukaukas affectionately, and Paula  turned towards the door with a silent greeting to the rest of the party;  but the Moslem detained her and said:    \"I know who you are, noble daughter of Thomas, and I have heard that  your brother was the bridegroom who had come to Abyla to solemnize his  marriage with the daughter of the prefect of Tripolis. Alas, alas! I  myself was there with my merchandise at the fair, when a maddened horde  of my fellow-believers fell upon the peaceful town. Poor child, poor  child! Your father was the greatest and most redoubtable of our foes.  Whether still on earth or in heaven he yet, no doubt honors our sword  as we honor his. But your brother, whom we sent to his grave as a  bridegroom--he cursed us with his dying breath. You have inherited his  rancor; and when it surges up against me, a Moslem, I can do no more  than bow my head and do penance for the guilt of those whose blood runs  in my veins and whose faith I confess. I have nothing to plead--no,  noble maiden, nothing that can excuse the deed of Abyla. There--there  alone it was the fate of my grey hairs to be ashamed of my  fellow-Moslems--believe me, maiden, it was grievous to me. War, and  the memory of many friends slain and of wealth lightly plundered had  unchained men's passion; and where passion's pinions wave, whether in  the struggle for mine and thine or for other possessions, ever since the  days of Cain and Abel, it is always and everywhere the same.\"    Paula, who till now had stood motionless in front of the old man, shook  her head and said bitterly:    \"But all this will not give me back my father and brother. You yourself  look like a kind-hearted man; but for the future--if you are as just as  you are kind--find out to whom you are speaking before you talk of the  compassion of the Moslems!\"    She once more bowed good-night and left the room. Orion followed her;  come what might he must see her. But he returned a few minutes after,  breathing hard and with his teeth set. He had taken her hand, had tried  to tell her all a loving heart could find to say; but how sharply, how  icily had he been repulsed, with what an air of intolerable scorn had  she turned her back upon him! And now that he was in their midst again  he scarcely heard his father express his regrets that so painful a scene  should have occurred under his roof, while the Arab said that he could  quite understand why the daughter of Thomas should have been betrayed to  anger: the massacre of Abyla was quite inexcusable.    \"But then,\" the old man went on, \"in what war do not such things take  place? Even the Christian is not always master of himself: you  yourself I know, lost two promising sons--and who were the murderers?  Christians--your own fellow-believers...\"    \"The bitterest foes of my beliefs,\" said the governor slowly, and every  syllable was a calm and dignified reproof to the Moslem for supposing  that the creed of those who had killed his sons could be his. As  he spoke he opened his eyes wide with the look of those hard,  opaquely-glittering stones which his ancestors had been wont to set for  eyes in their portrait statues. But he suddenly closed them again and  said indifferently:    \"At what price do you value your hanging? I have a fancy to buy it. Name  your lowest terms: I cannot bear to bargain.\"    \"I had thought of asking five hundred thousand drachmae,\" said the  dealer. \"Four hundred thousand drachmae, and it is yours.\"    The governor's wife clasped her hands at such a sum and made warning  signals to her husband, shaking her head disapprovingly, when Orion,  making a great effort to show that he too took an interest in this  important transaction, said: \"It may be worth three hundred thousand.\"    \"Four hundred thousand,\" repeated the merchant coolly. \"Your father  wished to know the lowest price, and I am asking no more than is  right. The rubies and garnets in these grapes, the pearls in the myrtle  blossoms, the turquoises in the forget-me-nots, the diamonds hanging  as dew on the grass, the emeralds which give brilliancy to the green  leaves--this one especially, which is an immense stone--alone are worth  more.\"    \"Then why do you not cut them out of the tissue?\" asked Neforis.    \"Because I cannot bear to destroy this noble work,\" replied the Arab. \"I  will sell it as it is or not at all.\" At these words the Mukaukas  nodded to his son, heedless of the disapprobation his wife persisted in  expressing, asked for a tablet which lay near the chessboard, and on it  wrote a few words.    \"We are agreed,\" he said to the merchant. \"The treasurer, Nilus, will  hand you the payment to-morrow morning on presenting this order.\"    A fresh emotion now took possession of Orion, and crying: \"Splendid!  Splendid!\" he rushed up to his father and excitedly kissed his hand.  Then, turning to his mother, whose eyes were full of tears of vexation,  he put his hand under her chin, kissed her brow, and exclaimed with  triumphant satisfaction: \"This is how we and the emperor do business!  When the father is the most liberal of men the son is apt to look small.  Meaning no harm, worthy merchant! As far as the hanging is concerned,  it may be more precious than all the treasures of Croesus; but you have  something yet to give us into the bargain before you load your camels  with our gold: Tell us what the whole work was like before it was  divided.\"    The Moslem, who had placed the precious tablet in his girdle, at once  obeyed this request.    \"You know how enormous were its length and breadth,\" he began. \"The hall  it decorated could hold several thousand guests, besides space for  a hundred body guards to stand on each side of the throne. As many  weavers, embroiderers and jewellers as there are days in the year  worked on it, they say, for the years of a man's life. The woven picture  represented paradise as the Persians imagine it--full of green trees,  flowers and fruits. Here you can still see a fragment of the sparkling  fountain which, when seen from a distance, with its sprinkling of  diamonds, sapphires and emeralds, looked like living water. Here the  pearls represent the foam on a wave. These leaves, cut across here,  belonged to a rose-bush which grew by the fountain of Eden before the  evil of the first rain fell on the world.    \"Originally all roses were white, but as the limbs of the first woman  shone with more dazzling whiteness they blushed for shame, and since  then there are crimson as well as white roses. So the Persians say.\"    \"And this--our piece?\" asked Orion.    \"This,\" replied the merchant, with a pleasant glance at the young man,  \"was the very middle of the hanging. On the left you see the judgment  at the bridge of Chinvat. The damned were not represented, but only the  winged, Fravashi, Genii who, as the Persians believe, dwell one with  each mortal as his guardian angel through life, united to him but  separable. They were depicted in stormy pursuit of the damned--the  miscreant followers of Angramainjus, the evil Spirit, of whom you must  imagine a vast multitude fleeing before them. The souls in bliss, the  pure and faithful servants of the Persian divinity Auramazda, enter with  songs of triumph into the flower-decked pleasure-garden, while at their  feet the spirits were shown of those who were neither altogether cursed  nor altogether blessed, vanishing in humble silence into a dusky grove.  The pure enjoyed the gifts of paradise in peace and contentment.--All  this was explained to me by a priest of the Fire-worshippers. Here, you  see, is a huge bunch of grapes which one of the happy ones is about to  pluck; the hand is uninjured--the arm unfortunately is cut through; but  here is a splendid fragment of the wreath of fruit and flowers which  framed the whole. That emerald forming a bud--how much do you think it  is worth?\"    \"A magnificent stone!\" cried Orion. \"Even Heliodora "]]]
