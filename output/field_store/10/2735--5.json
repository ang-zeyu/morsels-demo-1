He had  the name, of course, upon Flinders' chart of 1799.* (* The new chart  which Flinders gave to Baudin was published after Le Geographe left  Havre. The chart which he had in his possession was the one advertised in  the Moniteur on 8th Vendemiaire, Revolutionary Year 10. (September 30,  1800): \"Nouvelle carte du detroit de Basse, situe entre la Nouvelle  Galles Meridionale, a la Nouvelle Hollande, lequel separe ces deux  parties; avec la route du vaisseau qui l'a parcouru et partie de la cote  a l'est de la Nouvelle Hollande, levee par Flinders. Prix deux francs.\"  This chart had been reproduced by the French Department of Marine from  the one published by Flinders in England in 1799, and several copies of  it had been supplied to Baudin and his officers for the use of the  expedition, though it was also offered for sale. See the Moniteur, 27  Thermidor, Revolutionary Year 11 (August 15, 1803), as to the engraving  of the chart at the French depot for the use of the expedition.)    At the second interview Baudin was more inquisitive than he had been on  the previous day. He had then been more disposed to talk about his own  discoveries in southern Tasmania than to ask questions about the  Investigator's work. \"It somewhat surprised me,\" said Flinders, \"that  Captain Baudin made no inquiries concerning my business upon this unknown  coast, but as he seemed more desirous of communicating information I was  happy to receive it.\" Another of the inaccuracies of Peron is that \"M.  Flinders showed a great reserve concerning his particular operations.\"  There was no need of reserve, and none was shown. But \"tact teaches when  to be silent,\" as Disraeli's Mr. Wilton observed; and an occasion for the  exercise of this virtue is presented when information likely to be  valuable is being given. Reflection, and what his officers had been able  to learn from Flinders' boat crew, however, had stimulated Baudin's  curiosity. On the 9th, therefore, he asked questions. Flinders, so far  from maintaining reserve, readily explained the discoveries he had made,  and furnished Baudin with some useful information for his own voyage. He  described how he had explored the whole of the south coast as far as the  place of meeting;* (* Manuscript Journal.) related how he had obtained  water at Port Lincoln by digging in the clay; pointed out Kangaroo Island  across the water, where an abundance of fresh meat might be procured;  \"told him the name I had affixed to the island,\" in consequence of the  marsupials shot there; and \"as proof of the refreshment to be obtained at  the island, pointed to the kangaroo skin caps worn by my boat's crew.\"  The return made for this courtesy was that upon the Terre Napoleon maps  the name Flinders gave was ignored, and \"L'Ile Decres\" was scored upon  it, this being done while the true discoverer was pent up in French  custody in an island of the Indian Ocean.    The most interesting statement made by Baudin will be dealt with in the  next chapter. The two commanders conversed on the 8th for about half an  hour, and on the second occasion, when Flinders presented the new chart  of Bass Strait, for a shorter period. Early on the morning of the 9th  they bade each other adieu. Flinders returned to the Investigator, and  the two ships sailed away--the French to retrace the coast already  followed by Flinders, but to find nothing that was new, because he had  left so little to be found; the English to proceed, first to King Island  and Port Phillip, and then through Bass Strait to Port Jackson, where the  two commanders met again.      CHAPTER 3. PORT PHILLIP.    Conflict of evidence between Baudin, Peron, and Freycinet as to whether  the French ships had sighted Port Phillip.  Baudin's statement corroborated by documents.  Examination of Freycinet's statement.  The impossibility of doing what Peron and Freycinet asserted was done.    One statement made by Captain Baudin to Flinders has been reserved for  separate treatment, because it merits careful examination.* (* The more  so as the conflict of evidence to be pointed out seems to have escaped  the notice of writers on Australian history. The contradictions are not  observed in Bonwick's Port Phillip Settlement, in Rusden's Discovery,  Survey, and Settlement of Port Phillip, in Shillinglaw's Historical  Records of Port Phillip, in Labilliere's Early History of Victoria, in  Mr. Gyles Turner's History of the Colony of Victoria, nor in any other  work with which the author is acquainted.)    He gave an account of the storm in Bass Strait which had separated him  from Le Naturaliste on March 21, and went on to say that \"having since  had fair winds and fine weather, he had explored the south coast from  Westernport to our place of meeting without finding any river, inlet, or  other shelter which afforded anchorage.\" In his report to the Admiralty,  dated May 11, 1802, Flinders related what Baudin told him on this point,  in the following terms, which it is worth while to compare with those  used by him in his book, quoted above: \"Captain Baudin informed me that  after parting with the Naturaliste in the Strait, in a heavy gale, he had  had fine weather, and had kept the coast close on board from Westernport  to the place of meeting, but that he had found no bay or place where a  vessel could anchor, the coast having but few bights in it, and those  affording nothing to interest.\" It will be seen that the official report  and the account given to the public twelve years later are in close  agreement. The important fact to be noticed is that Le Geographe had  slipped past Port Phillip without observing the entrance, and that her  captain was at this time entirely ignorant of the existence of the  harbour which has since become the seat of one of the greatest cities in  the southern hemisphere.    Now this statement, which is sufficiently surprising without the  introduction of complicating contradictions, becomes quite mysterious  when compared with the accounts given by Lieutenant Louis de Freycinet  and Francois Peron, the joint authors of the official history of the  French voyage. It is astonishing in itself, because a vessel sent out on  a voyage of exploration would not be expected to overlook so important a  feature as Port Phillip. Here was not a small river with a sandbar over  its mouth, but an extensive area of land-locked sea, with an opening a  mile and a half wide, flanked by rocky head-lands, fronted by usually  turbulent waters, at the head of a deep indentation of the coast. The  entrance to Port Phillip is not, it must be acknowledged, so easy to  perceive from the outside as would appear from a hasty examination of the  map. If the reader will take a good atlas in which there is a map of Port  Phillip, and will hold the plate in a horizontal position sufficiently  below the level of the eye to permit the entrance to be seen ALONG the  page, he will look at it very much as it is regarded from a ship at sea.*  (* A reduced copy of the Admiralty chart of the entrance (1907) is  prefixed to this chapter. The reader can perform the experiment with  that.) It will be noticed that a clear view into the port, except from a  particular angle, is blocked by the land on the eastern side (Point  Nepean) overlapping the tongue of land just inside the port on the  western side (Shortland's Bluff). Not until a vessel stands fairly close  and opposite to the entrance, so that the two lighthouses on the western  side, at Queenscliff, \"open out,\" can the passage be discerned.* (*  Ferguson, Sailing Directions for Port Phillip, 1854--he was  harbour-master at the time--says (page 9): \"Vessels having passed Cape  Schanck should keep a good offing in running down towards the entrance  until they open out the lighthouses, WHICH ARE NOT SEEN BEFORE BEARING  NORTH 1/2 EAST OWING TO THE HIGH LAND OF POINT NEPEAN INTERVENING.\"  Findley, Navigation of the South Pacific Ocean, 1863, has a remark about  the approach to the port from the west: \"In approaching Port Phillip from  the westward, the entrance cannot be distinguished until Nepean Point,  the eastern point, bears north-north-east, when Shortland's Bluff, on  which the lighthouses are erected, opens out, and a view of the estuary  is obtained.\" A Treatise on the Navigation of Port Phillip, by Captain  Evans (a pilot of thirty-six years' experience), has also been  consulted.) Indeed, a pilot of much experience has assured the writer  that ships, whose captains know the port, are sometimes seen \"dodging  about\" (the phrase is the pilot's) looking for the entrance. Yet it may  be allowed that if Le Geographe had sailed close in, with the shore on  her starboard quarter, and the coast had been examined with care, she  would hardly have missed the port; and, her special business being  exploration, she certainly ought not to have missed it.* (* In Appendix  B, at the end of this chapter, are given quotations from the journals of  Murray and Flinders, in which they record how they first saw the port.)    But although Baudin said he had seen nothing \"to interest,\" both Peron  and Freycinet, in their volumes--published years later, after they had  learnt of the discovery of Port Phillip by Lieutenant John Murray in  January 1802--stated that it was seen from Le Geographe on March 30.  Peron wrote that shortly after daybreak, the ship being in the curve of  the coast called Baie Talleyrand on the Terre Napoleon maps--that is,  between Cape Schanck on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7452"],[0,"Autobiography of a Yogi (#10)"],[1,"ne; the heart opens only  to the human chant of being.\"    We strolled to the inviting sunshine at the entrance, where throngs  of devotees were passing to and fro.    \"You are young.\" The sage surveyed me thoughtfully. \"India too is  young. The ancient RISHIS {FN5-3} laid down ineradicable patterns  of spiritual living. Their hoary dictums suffice for this day  and land.  Not outmoded, not unsophisticated against the guiles  of materialism, the disciplinary precepts mold India still. By  millenniums-more than embarrassed scholars care to compute!-the  skeptic Time has validated Vedic worth. Take it for your heritage.\"    As I was reverently bidding farewell to the eloquent SADHU, he  revealed a clairvoyant perception:    \"After you leave here today, an unusual experience will come your  way.\"    I quitted the temple precincts and wandered along aimlessly. Turning  a corner, I ran into an old acquaintance-one of those long-winded  fellows whose conversational powers ignore time and embrace eternity.    \"I will let you go in a very short while, if you will tell me all  that has happened during the six years of our separation.\"    \"What a paradox! I must leave you now.\"    But he held me by the hand, forcing out tidbits of information.  He was like a ravenous wolf, I thought in amusement; the longer I  spoke, the more hungrily he sniffed for news. Inwardly I petitioned  the Goddess Kali to devise a graceful means of escape.    My companion left me abruptly. I sighed with relief and doubled my  pace, dreading any relapse into the garrulous fever. Hearing rapid  footsteps behind me, I quickened my speed. I dared not look back.  But with a bound, the youth rejoined me, jovially clasping my  shoulder.    \"I forgot to tell you of Gandha Baba (Perfume Saint), who is gracing  yonder house.\" He pointed to a dwelling a few yards distant. \"Do  meet him; he is interesting. You may have an unusual experience.  Good-by,\" and he actually left me.    The similarly worded prediction of the SADHU at Kalighat Temple  flashed to my mind. Definitely intrigued, I entered the house and  was ushered into a commodious parlor. A crowd of people were sitting,  Orient-wise, here and there on a thick orange-colored carpet. An  awed whisper reached my ear:    \"Behold Gandha Baba on the leopard skin. He can give the natural  perfume of any flower to a scentless one, or revive a wilted blossom,  or make a person's skin exude delightful fragrance.\"    I looked directly at the saint; his quick gaze rested on mine. He  was plump and bearded, with dark skin and large, gleaming eyes.    \"Son, I am glad to see you. Say what you want. Would you like some  perfume?\"    \"What for?\" I thought his remark rather childish.    \"To experience the miraculous way of enjoying perfumes.\"    \"Harnessing God to make odors?\"    \"What of it? God makes perfume anyway.\"    \"Yes, but He fashions frail bottles of petals for fresh use and  discard. Can you materialize flowers?\"    \"I materialize perfumes, little friend.\"    \"Then scent factories will go out of business.\"    \"I will permit them to keep their trade! My own purpose is to  demonstrate the power of God.\"    \"Sir, is it necessary to prove God? Isn't He performing miracles  in everything, everywhere?\"    \"Yes, but we too should manifest some of His infinite creative  variety.\"    \"How long did it take to master your art?\"    \"Twelve years.\"    \"For manufacturing scents by astral means! It seems, my honored  saint, you have been wasting a dozen years for fragrances which  you can obtain with a few rupees from a florist's shop.\"    \"Perfumes fade with flowers.\"    \"Perfumes fade with death. Why should I desire that which pleases  the body only?\"    \"Mr. Philosopher, you please my mind. Now, stretch forth your right  hand.\" He made a gesture of blessing.    I was a few feet away from Gandha Baba; no one else was near  enough to contact my body. I extended my hand, which the yogi did  not touch.    \"What perfume do you want?\"    \"Rose.\"    \"Be it so.\"    To my great surprise, the charming fragrance of rose was wafted  strongly from the center of my palm. I smilingly took a large white  scentless flower from a near-by vase.    \"Can this odorless blossom be permeated with jasmine?\"    \"Be it so.\"    A jasmine fragrance instantly shot from the petals. I thanked the  wonder-worker and seated myself by one of his students. He informed  me that Gandha Baba, whose proper name was Vishudhananda, had  learned many astonishing yoga secrets from a master in Tibet. The  Tibetan yogi, I was assured, had attained the age of over a thousand  years.    \"His disciple Gandha Baba does not always perform his perfume-feats  in the simple verbal manner you have just witnessed.\" The student  spoke with obvious pride in his master. \"His procedure differs  widely, to accord with diversity in temperaments. He is marvelous!  Many members of the Calcutta intelligentsia are among his followers.\"    I inwardly resolved not to add myself to their number. A guru too  literally \"marvelous\" was not to my liking. With polite thanks to  Gandha Baba, I departed. Sauntering home, I reflected on the three  varied encounters the day had brought forth.    My sister Uma met me as I entered our Gurpar Road door.    \"You are getting quite stylish, using perfumes!\"    Without a word, I motioned her to smell my hand.    \"What an attractive rose fragrance! It is unusually strong!\"    Thinking it was \"strongly unusual,\" I silently placed the astrally  scented blossom under her nostrils.    \"Oh, I love jasmine!\" She seized the flower. A ludicrous bafflement  passed over her face as she repeatedly sniffed the odor of jasmine  from a type of flower she well knew to be scentless. Her reactions  disarmed my suspicion that Gandha Baba had induced an auto-suggestive  state whereby I alone could detect the fragrances.    Later I heard from a friend, Alakananda, that the \"Perfume Saint\"  had a power which I wish were possessed by the starving millions  of Asia and, today, of Europe as well.    \"I was present with a hundred other guests at Gandha Baba's home  in Burdwan,\" Alakananda told me. \"It was a gala occasion. Because  the yogi was reputed to have the power of extracting objects  out of thin air, I laughingly requested him to materialize some  out-of-season tangerines. Immediately the LUCHIS {FN5-4} which  were present on all the banana-leaf plates became puffed up. Each  of the bread-envelopes proved to contain a peeled tangerine. I bit  into my own with some trepidation, but found it delicious.\"    Years later I understood by inner realization how Gandha Baba  accomplished his materializations. The method, alas! is beyond the  reach of the world's hungry hordes.    The different sensory stimuli to which man reacts-tactual, visual,  gustatory, auditory, and olfactory-are produced by vibratory  variations in electrons and protons. The vibrations in turn are  regulated by \"lifetrons,\" subtle life forces or finer-than-atomic  energies intelligently charged with the five distinctive sensory  idea-substances.    Gandha Baba, tuning himself with the cosmic force by certain yogic  practices, was able to guide the lifetrons to rearrange their  vibratory structure and objectivize the desired result. His perfume,  fruit and other miracles were actual materializations of mundane  vibrations, and not inner sensations hypnotically produced. {FN5-5}    Performances of miracles such as shown by the \"Perfume Saint\" are  spectacular but spiritually useless. Having little purpose beyond  entertainment, they are digressions from a serious search for God.    Hypnotism has been used by physicians in minor operations as a sort  of psychical chloroform for persons who might be endangered by an  anesthetic. But a hypnotic state is harmful to those often subjected to  it; a negative psychological effect ensues which in time deranges  the brain cells. Hypnotism is trespass into the territory of  another's consciousness. Its temporary phenomena have nothing in  common with the miracles performed by men of divine realization.  Awake in God, true saints effect changes in this dream-world by  means of a will harmoniously attuned to the Creative Cosmic Dreamer.    Ostentatious display of unusual powers are decried by masters. The  Persian mystic, Abu Said, once laughed at certain FAKIRS who were  proud of their miraculous powers over water, air, and space.    \"A frog is also at home in the water!\" Abu Said pointed out in gentle  scorn. \"The crow and the vulture easily fly in the air; the Devil  is simultaneously present in the East and in the West! A true man  is he who dwells in righteousness among his fellow men, who buys  and sells, yet is never for a single instant forgetful of God!\"  On another occasion the great Persian teacher gave his views on  the religious life thus: \"To lay aside what you have in your head  (selfish desires and ambitions); to freely bestow what you have in  your hand; and never to flinch from the blows of adversity!\"    Neither the impartial sage at Kalighat Temple nor the Tibetan-trained  yogi had satisfied my yearning for a guru. My heart needed no  tutor for its recognitions, and cried its own \"Bravos!\" the more  resoundingly because unoften summoned from silence. When I finally  met my master, he taught me by sublimity of example alone the  measure of a true man.    {FN5-1} Kali represents the eternal principle in nature. She is  traditionally pictured as a four-armed woman, standing on the form  of the God Shiva or the Infinite, because nature or the phenomenal  world is rooted in the Noumenon. The four arms symbolize cardinal  attributes, two beneficent, two destructive, indicating the essential  duality of matter or creation.    {FN5-2} Cosmic illusion; literally, \"the measurer.\" MAYA is the  magical power in creation by which limitations and divisions are  apparently present in the Immeasurable and Inseparable.
