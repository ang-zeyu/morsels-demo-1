Pace reported that the money of  France and Spain was flowing on all sides, and was of opinion that the  empire was \"the dearest merchandise that ever was sold,\" and would prove  \"the worst that ever was bought to him that shall obtain it.\" Yet still  he professed to have hopes, and even asked for money to enter the lists  of corruption. But this was needless, as the election at last proceeded  quickly. The Pope came round to the side of Charles as being the least  of two evils, and Charles was elected on 28th June.    Thus Wolsey succeeded in satisfying his master's demands without  committing England to any breach with either of her allies. Henry VIII.  could scarcely be gratified at the part that he had played, but Wolsey  could convince him that he had tried his best, and that at any rate no  harm had been done. Though Henry's proceedings were known to Francis and  Charles, there was nothing at which they could take offence. Henry had  behaved with duplicity, but that was only to be expected in those days;  he had not pronounced himself strongly against either. The ill-will that  had long been simmering between Charles V. and Francis I. had risen to  the surface, and the long rivalry between the two monarchs was now  declared. Each looked for allies, and the most important ally was  England. Each had hopes of winning over the English king, and Wolsey  wished to keep alive, without satisfying, the hopes of both, and so  establish still more securely the power of England as holding the  balance of the peace of Europe.    Wolsey's conduct in this matter throws much light on his relations to  the king, and the method by which he retained his influence and managed  to carry out his own designs. He appreciated the truth that a statesman  must lead while seeming to follow--a truth which applies equally to all  forms of government. Wolsey was responsible to no one but the king, and  so had a better opportunity than has a statesman who serves a democracy  to obtain permission to carry out a consecutive policy. But, on the  other hand, he was more liable to be thwarted and interrupted in matters  of detail by the interference of a superior. Wolsey's far-seeing policy  was endangered by the king's vanity and obstinacy; he could not ask for  time to justify his own wisdom, but was forced to obey. Yet even then he  would not abandon his own position and set himself to minimise the  inconvenience. It is impossible to know how often Wolsey was at other  times obliged to give way to the king and adopt the second-best course;  but in this case we find clear indications of the process. When he was  driven from his course, he contrived that the deviation should be as  unimportant as possible.    Wolsey's task of maintaining peace by English mediation was beset with  difficulties now that the breach between Francis I. and Charles V. was  clearly made. It was necessary for England to be friendly to both, and  not to be drawn by its friendliness towards either to offend the other.  In the matter of the imperial election English influence had been  somewhat on the side of Charles, and Francis was now the one who needed  propitiation. The treaty with France had provided for a personal  interview between the two kings, and Francis was anxious that it should  take place at once. For this purpose he strove to win the good offices  of Wolsey. He assured him that in case of a papal election he could  command fourteen votes which should be given in his favour. Moreover, he  conferred on him a signal mark of his confidence by nominating him his  plenipotentiary for the arrangements about the forthcoming interview. By  this all difficulties were removed, and Wolsey stood forward before the  eyes of Europe as the accredited representative of the kings of England  and France at the same time. It is no wonder that men marvelled at such  an unheard-of position for an English subject.    But nothing that Francis had to give could turn Wolsey away from his own  path. No sooner did he know that the French interview was agreed upon  than he suggested to Charles that it would be well for him also to have  a meeting with the English king. The proposal was eagerly accepted, and  Wolsey conducted the negotiations about both interviews side by side.  Rarely did two meetings cause such a flow of ink and raise so many  knotty points. At last it was agreed that Charles should visit Henry in  England in an informal way before the French interview took place. It  was difficult to induce the punctilious Spaniards to give way to  Wolsey's requirements. It was a hard thing for one who bore the  high-sounding title of Emperor to agree to visit a King of England on  his own terms. But Wolsey was resolute that everything should be done in  such a way as to give France the least cause of complaint. When the  Spanish envoys objected to his arrangements or proposed alterations, he  brought them to their bearings by saying, \"Very well; then do not do it  and begone.\" They were made to feel their dependence on himself. The  interview was of their seeking, and must be held on terms which he  proposed, or not at all. This, no doubt, was felt to be very haughty  conduct on Wolsey's part; but he had set on foot the scheme of this  double interview, by which Henry was to be glorified and England's  mediatorial position assured. It was his business to see that his plan  succeeded. So he turned a deaf ear to the offers of the Spanish  ambassadors. He was not to be moved by the promise of ecclesiastical  revenues in Spain. Even when the influence of Spain was proffered to  secure his election to the Papacy, he coldly refused.    It has been said that Wolsey was open to bribes, and his seemingly  tortuous policy has been accounted for by the supposition that he  inclined to the side which promised him most. This, however, is an  entire mistake. Wolsey went his own way; but at the same time he did not  disregard his personal profit. He was too great a man to be bribed; but  his greatness entailed magnificence, and magnificence is expensive. He  regarded it as natural that sovereigns who threw work upon his shoulders  should make some recognition of his labours. This was the custom of the  time; and Wolsey was by no means singular in receiving gifts from  foreign kings. The chief lords of Henry's Court received pensions from  the King of France; and the lords of the French Court were similarly  rewarded by Henry. This was merely a complimentary custom, and was open  and avowed. Wolsey received a pension from Francis I., and a further sum  as compensation for the bishopric of Tournai, which he resigned when  Tournai was returned to France. In like manner, Charles V. rewarded him  by a Spanish bishopric; but Wolsey declined the office of bishop, and  preferred to receive a fixed pension secured on the revenues of the see.  This iniquitous arrangement was carried out with the Pope's consent; and  such like arrangements were by no means rare. They were the natural  result of the excessive wealth of the Church, which was diverted to the  royal uses by a series of fictions, more or less barefaced, but all  tending to the weakening of the ecclesiastical organisation. Still the  fact remains that Wolsey thought no shame of receiving pensions from  Francis and Charles alike; but there was nothing secret nor  extraordinary in this. Wolsey regarded it as only obvious that his  statesmanship should be rewarded by those for whom it was exercised; but  the Emperor and the King of France never hoped that by these pensions  they would attach Wolsey to their side. The promise by which they tried  to win him was the promise of the Papacy; and to this Wolsey turned a  deaf ear. \"He is seven times more powerful than the Pope,\" wrote the  Venetian ambassador; and perhaps Wolsey himself at this time was of the  same opinion.    Meanwhile Francis was annoyed when he heard of these dealings with  Charles, and tried to counteract them by pressing for an early date of  his meeting with Henry VIII. It is amazing to find how large a part  domestic events were made to play in these matters of high policy when  occasion needed. Francis urged that he was very anxious for his queen to  be present to welcome Katharine; but she was expecting her confinement,  and if the interview did not take place soon she would be unable to  appear. Wolsey replied with equal concern for family affairs, that the  Emperor was anxious to visit his aunt, whom he had never seen, and Henry  could not be so churlish as to refuse a visit from his wife's relative.  Katharine, on her side, was overjoyed at this renewal of intimacy with  the Spanish Court, to whose interests she was strongly attached, and  tried to prevent the understanding with France, by declaring that she  could not possibly have her dresses ready under three months. In her  dislike of the French alliance Queen Katharine expressed the popular  sentiment. The people had long regarded France as the natural enemy of  England, and were slow to give up their prejudices. The nobles grew more  and more discontented with Wolsey's policy, which they did not care to  understand. They only saw that their expectations of a return to power  were utterly disappointed; Wolsey, backed by officials such as Pace, was  all-powerful, and they were disregarded. Wolsey was working absolutely  single-handed. It is a remarkable proof of his skill that he was able to  draw the king to follow him unhesitatingly, at the sacrifice of his  personal popularity, and in spite of the representations of those who  were immediately around him.    Moreover, Wolsey, in his capacity of representative of the Kings of  England and France, had in his hands the entire management of all  concerning the coming interview. He fixed the place with due regard to  the honour of England, almost on English soil.

There it remained, and the  Colonel remained in the middle of the floor, his soft hat on the back of  his head, one hand planted firmly on the gold head of his stick, and  the other tugging at his goatee, pulling down his chin to the quizzical  angle.    \"Whoopee!\" he cried.    The effect of this was to make one perspire freely. Stephen perspired.  And as there seemed no logical answer, he made none.    Suddenly Mr. Carvel turned, shaking with a laughter he could not  control, and strode into the private office the door slammed behind him.  Mr. Brice's impulse was flight. But he controlled himself.    First of all there was an eloquent silence. Then a ripple of guffaws.  Then the scratch-scratch of a quill pen, and finally the Judge's voice.    \"Carvel, what the devil's the matter with you, sir?\"    A squall of guffaws blew through the transom, and the Colonel was heard  slapping his knee.    \"Judge Whipple,\" said he, his voice vibrating from suppressed  explosions, \"I am happy to see that you have overcome some of your  ridiculous prejudices, sir.\"    \"What prejudices, sir?\" the Judge was heard to shout.    \"Toward slavery, Judge,\" said Mr. Carvel, seeming to recover his  gravity. \"You are a broader man than I thought, sir.\"    An unintelligible gurgle came from the Judge. Then he said.    \"Carvel, haven't you and I quarrelled enough on that subject?\"    \"You didn't happen to attend the nigger auction this morning when you  were at the court?\" asked the Colonel, blandly.    \"Colonel,\" said the Judge, \"I've warned you a hundred times against the  stuff you lay out on your counter for customers.\"    \"You weren't at the auction, then,\" continued the Colonel, undisturbed.  \"You missed it, sir. You missed seeing this young man you've just  employed buy the prettiest quadroon wench I ever set eyes on.\"    Now indeed was poor Stephen on his feet. But whether to fly in at the  one entrance or out at the other, he was undecided.    \"Colonel,\" said Mr. Whipple, \"is that true?\"    \"Sir!\" \"MR. BRICE!\"    It did not seem to Stephen as if he was walking when he went toward the  ground glass door. He opened it. There was Colonel Carvel seated on the  bed, his goatee in his hand. And there was the Judge leaning forward  from his hips, straight as a ramrod. Fire was darting from beneath his  bushy eyebrows. \"Mr. Brice,\" said he, \"there is one question I always  ask of those whom I employ. I omitted it in your case because I have  known your father and your grandfather before you. What is your opinion,  sir, on the subject of holding human beings in bondage?\"    The answer was immediate,--likewise simple.    \"I do not believe in it, Mr. Whipple.\"    The Judge shot out of his chair like a long jack-in-the box, and towered  to his full height.    \"Mr. Brice, did you, or did you not, buy a woman at auction to-day?\"    \"I did, sir.\"    Mr. Whipple literally staggered. But Stephen caught a glimpse of the  Colonel's hand slipping from his chin cover his mouth.    \"Good God, sir!\" cried the Judge, and he sat down heavily. \"You say that  you are an Abolitionist?\"    \"No, sir, I do not say that. But it does not need an Abolitionist to  condemn what I saw this morning.\"    \"Are you a slave-owner, sir?\" said Mr. Whipple.    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Then get your coat and hat and leave my office, Mr. Brice.\"    Stephen's coat was on his arm. He slipped it on, and turned to go. He  was, if the truth were told, more amused than angry. It was Colonel  Carvel's voice that stopped him.    \"Hold on, Judge,\" he drawled, \"I reckon you haven't got all the packing  out of that case.\"    Mr. Whipple locked at him in a sort of stupefaction. Then he glanced at  Stephen.    \"Come back here, sir,\" he cried. \"I'll give you hearing. No man shall  say that I am not just.\"    Stephen looked gratefully at the Colonel.    \"I did not expect one, sir,\" he said..    \"And you don't deserve one, sir,\" cried the Judge.    \"I think I do,\" replied Stephen, quietly.    The Judge suppressed something.    \"What did you do with this person?\" he demanded    \"I took her to Miss Crane's boarding-house,\" said Stephen.    It was the Colonel's turn to explode. The guffaw which came from hire  drowned every other sound.    \"Good God!\" said the Judge, helplessly. Again he looked at the Colonel,  and this time something very like mirth shivered his lean frame. \"And  what do you intend to do with her?\" he asked in strange tones.    \"To give her freedom, sir, as soon as I can find somebody to go on her  bond.\"    Again silence. Mr. Whipple rubbed his nose with more than customary  violence, and looked very hard at Mr. Carvel, whose face was  inscrutable. It was a solemn moment.    \"Mr. Brice,\" said the Judge, at length, \"take off your coat, sir I will  go her bond.\"    It was Stephen's turn to be taken aback. He stood regarding the Judge  curiously, wondering what manner of man he was. He did not know that  this question had puzzled many before him.    \"Thank you, sir,\" he said.    His hand was on the knob of the door, when Mr. Whipple called him back  abruptly. His voice had lost some of its gruffness.    \"What were your father's ideas about slavery, Mr. Brice?\"    The young man thought a moment, as if seeking to be exact.    \"I suppose he would have put slavery among the necessary evils, sir,\"  he said, at length. \"But he never could bear to have the liberator  mentioned in his presence. He was not at all in sympathy with Phillips,  or Parker, or Summer. And such was the general feeling among his  friends.\"    \"Then,\" said the Judge, \"contrary to popular opinion in the West and  South, Boston is not all Abolition.\"    Stephen smiled.    \"The conservative classes are not at all Abolitionists, sir.\"    \"The conservative classes!\" growled the Judge, \"the conservative  classes! I am tired of hearing about the conservative classes. Why not  come out with it, sir, and say the moneyed classes, who would rather  see souls held in bondage than risk their worldly goods in an attempt to  liberate them?\"    Stephen flushed. It was not at all clear to him then how he was to get  along with Judge Whipple. But he kept his temper.    \"I am sure that you do them an injustice, sir,\" he said, with more  feeling them he had yet shown. \"I am not speaking of the rich alone, and  I think that if you knew Boston you would not say that the conservative  class there is wholly composed of wealthy people. Many of may father's  friends were by no means wealthy. And I know that if he had been poor he  would have held the same views.\"    Stephen did not mark the quick look of approval which Colonel Carvel  gave him. Judge Whipple merely rubbed his nose.    \"Well, sir,\" he said, \"what were his views, then?\"    \"My father regarded slaves as property, sir. And conservative people\"  (Stephen stuck to the word) \"respect property the world over. My  father's argument was this: If men are deprived by violence of one kind  of property which they hold under the law, all other kinds of property  will be endangered. The result will be anarchy. Furthermore, he  recognized that the economic conditions in the South make slavery  necessary to prosperity. And he regarded the covenant made between the  states of the two sections as sacred.\"    There was a brief silence, during which the uncompromising expression of  the Judge did not change.    \"And do you, sir?\" he demanded.    \"I am not sure, sir, after what I saw yesterday. I--I must have time to  see more of it.\"    \"Good Lord,\" said Colonel Carvel, \"if the conservative people of  the North act this way when they see a slave sale, what will the  Abolitionists do? Whipple,\" he added slowly, but with conviction, \"this  means war.\"    Then the Colonel got to his feet, and bowed to Stephen with ceremony.    \"Whatever you believe, sir,\" he said, \"permit me to shake your hand. You  are a brave man, sir. And although my own belief is that the black race  is held in subjection by a divine decree, I can admire what you have  done, Mr. Brice. It was a noble act, sir,--a right noble act. And I have  more respect for the people of Boston, now, sir, than I ever had before,  sir.\"    Having delivered himself of this somewhat dubious compliment (which he  meant well), the Colonel departed.    Judge Whipple said nothing.          CHAPTER VII. CALLERS    If the Brices had created an excitement upon their arrival, it was as  nothing to the mad delirium which raged at Miss Crane's boarding-house.  during the second afternoon of their stay. Twenty times was Miss Crane  on the point of requesting Mrs. Brice to leave, and twenty times, by the  advice of Mrs. Abner Deed, she desisted. The culmination came when the  news leaked out that Mr. Stephen Brice had bought the young woman in  order to give her freedom. Like those who have done noble acts since the  world began, Stephen that night was both a hero and a fool. The cream  from which heroes is made is very apt to turn.    \"Phew!\" cried Stephen, when they had reached their room after tea,  \"wasn't that meal a fearful experience? Let's find a hovel, mother, and  go and live in it. We can't stand it here any longer.\"    \"Not if you persist in your career of reforming an Institution, my son,\"  answered the widow, smiling.    \"It was beastly hard luck,\" said he, \"that I should have been shouldered  with that experience the first day. But I have tried to think it over  calmly since, and I can see nothing else to have done.\" He paused in his  pacing up and down, a smile struggling with his serious look. \"It was  quite a hot-headed business for one of the staid Brices, wasn't it?\"    \"The family has never been called impetuous,\" replied his mother. \"It  must be the Western air.\"    He began his pacing again. His mother had not said one word about the  money. Neither had he. Once more he stopped before her.    \"We are at least a year nearer the poor-house,\" he said; \"you haven't  scolded me "]]]
