I  haven't a word to say against him, especially when he goes to the  kitchen; I only want to know if he is going to stop here a night or two  or a year or two. Talk to him about it tomorrow with my love. I wonder  if he can make bisque soup.\"    Daisy Quantock carried quite a quantity of material for reflection  upstairs with her, then she went to bed, pausing a moment opposite the  Guru's door, from inside of which came sounds of breathing so deep that  it sounded almost like snoring. But she seemed to detect a timbre of  spirituality about it which convinced her that he was holding high  communion with the Guides. It was round him that her thoughts centred,  he was the tree through the branches of which they scampered  chattering.    Her first and main interest in him was sheer Guruism, for she was one  of those intensely happy people who pass through life in ecstatic  pursuit of some idea which those who do not share it call a fad. Well  might poor Robert remember the devastation of his home when Daisy,  after the perusal of a little pamphlet which she picked up on a  book-stall called \"The Uric Acid Monthly,\" came to the shattering  conclusion that her buxom frame consisted almost entirely of  waste-products which must be eliminated. For a greedy man the situation  was frankly intolerable, for when he continued his ordinary diet (this  was before the cursed advent of the Christian Science cook) she kept  pointing to his well-furnished plate, and told him that every atom of  that beef or mutton and potatoes, turned from the moment he swallowed it  into chromogens and toxins, and that his apparent appetite was merely the  result of fermentation. For herself her platter was an abominable mess  of cheese and protein-powder and apples and salad-oil, while round her,  like saucers of specimen seeds were ranged little piles of nuts and  pine-branches, which supplied body-building material, and which she  weighed out with scrupulous accuracy, in accordance with the directions  of the \"Uric Acid Monthly.\" Tea and coffee were taboo, since they  flooded the blood with purins, and the kitchen boiler rumbled day and  night to supply the rivers of boiling water with which (taken in sips)  she inundated her system. Strange gaunt females used to come down from  London, with small parcels full of tough food that tasted of  travelling-bags and contained so much nutrition that a port-manteau  full of it would furnish the daily rations of any army. Luckily even  her iron constitution could not stand the strain of such ideal living  for long, and her growing anaemia threatened to undermine a  constitution seriously impaired by the precepts of perfect health. A  course of beef-steaks and other substantial viands loaded with uric  acid restored her to her former vigour.    Thus reinforced, she plunged with the same energy as she had devoted to  repelling uric acid into the embrace of Christian Science. The  inhumanity of that sect towards both herself and others took complete  possession of her, and when her husband complained on a bitter January  morning that his smoking-room was like an icehouse, because the  housemaid had forgotten to light the fire, she had no touch of pity for  him, since she knew that there was no such thing as cold or heat or  pain, and therefore you could not feel cold. But now, since, according  to the new creed, such things as uric acid, chromogens and purins had  no existence, she could safely indulge in decent viands again. But her  unhappy husband was not a real gainer in this respect, for while he  ate, she tirelessly discoursed to him on the new creed, and asked him  to recite with her the True Statement of Being. And on the top of that  she dismissed the admirable cook, and engaged the miscreant from whom  he suffered still, though Christian Science, which had allowed her cold  to make so long a false claim on her, had followed the uric-acid fad  into the limbo of her discarded beliefs.    But now once more she had temporarily discovered the secret of life in  the teachings of the Guru, and it was, as has been mentioned, sheer  Guruism that constituted the main attraction of the new creed. That  then being taken for granted, she turned her mind to certain  side-issues, which to a true Riseholmite were of entrancing interest.  She felt a strong suspicion that Lucia contemplated annexing her Guru  altogether, for otherwise she would not have returned so enthusiastic a  response to her note, nor have sent Georgie to deliver it, nor have  professed so violent an interest in the Guru. What then was the  correctly diabolical policy to pursue? Should Daisy Quantock refuse to  take him to Mrs Lucas altogether, with a message of regret that he did  not feel himself sent? Even if she did this, did she feel herself  strong enough to throw down the gauntlet (in the shape of the Guru)  and, using him as the attraction, challenge darling Lucia to mutual  combat, in order to decide who should be the leader of all that was  advanced and cultured in Riseholme society? Still following that  ramification of this policy, should she bribe Georgie over to her own  revolutionary camp, by promising him instruction from the Guru? Or  following a less dashing line, should she take darling Lucia and  Georgie into the charmed circle, and while retaining her own right of  treasure trove, yet share it with them in some inner ring, dispensing  the Guru to them, if they were good, in small doses?    Mrs Quantock's mind resembled in its workings the manoeuvres of a moth  distracted by the glory of several bright lights. It dashed at one, got  slightly singed, and forgetting all about that turned its attention to  the second, and the third, taking headers into each in turn, without  deciding which, on the whole, was the most enchanting of those  luminaries. So, in order to curb the exuberance of these frenzied  excursions she got a half sheet of paper, and noted down the  alternatives that she must choose from.    \"(I) Shall I keep him entirely to myself?    \"(II) Shall I run him for all he is worth, and leave out L?    \"(III) Shall I get G on my side?    \"(IV) Shall I give L and G bits?\"    She paused a moment: then remembering that he had voluntarily helped  her very pretty housemaid to make the beds that morning, saying that  his business (like the Prince of Wales's) was to serve, she added:    \"(V) Shall I ask him to be my cook?\"    For a few seconds the brightness of her eager interest was dimmed as  the unworthy suspicion occurred to her that perhaps the prettiness of  her housemaid had something to do with his usefulness in the bedrooms,  but she instantly dismissed it. There was the bottle of brandy, too,  which he had ordered from Rush's. When she had begged him to order  anything he wanted and cause it to be put down to her account, she had  not actually contemplated brandy. Then remembering that one of the most  necessary conditions for progress in Yoga, was that the disciple should  have complete confidence in the Guru, she chased that also out of her  mind. But still, even when the lines of all possible policies were  written down, she could come to no decision, and putting her paper by  her bed, decided to sleep over it. The rhythmical sounds of hallowed  breathing came steadily from next door, and she murmured \"Om, Om,\" in  time with them.    The hours of the morning between breakfast and lunch were the time  which the inhabitants of Riseholme chiefly devoted to spying on each  other. They went about from shop to shop on household businesses,  occasionally making purchases which they carried away with them in  little paper parcels with convenient loops of string, but the real  object of these excursions was to see what everybody else was doing,  and learn what fresh interests had sprung up like mushrooms during the  night. Georgie would be matching silks at the draper's, and very  naturally he would carry them from the obscurity of the interior to the  door in order to be certain about the shades, and keep his eye on the  comings and goings in the street, and very naturally Mr Lucas on his  way to the market gardener's to enquire whether he had yet received the  bulbs from Holland, would tell him that Lucia had received the  piano-arrangement of the Mozart trio. Georgie for his part would mention  that Hermy and Ursy were expected that evening, and Peppino enriched by  this item would \"toddle on,\" as his phrase went, to meet and exchange  confidences with the next spy. He had noticed incidentally that Georgie  carried a small oblong box with hard corners, which, perfectly  correctly, he conjectured to be cigarettes for Hermy and Ursy, since  Georgie never smoked.    \"Well, I must be toddling on,\" he said, after identifying Georgie's box  of cigarettes, and being rather puzzled by a bulge in Georgie's pocket.  \"You'll be looking in some time this morning, perhaps.\"    Georgie had not been quite sure that he would (for he was very busy  owing to the arrival of his sisters, and the necessity of going to Mr  Holroyd's, in order that that artist might accurately match the shade  of his hair with a view to the expensive toupet), but the mention of  the arrival of the Mozart now decided him. He intended anyhow before he  went home for lunch to stroll past The Hurst, and see if he did not  hear--to adopt a mixed metaphor--the sound of the diligent practice of  that classical morsel going on inside. Probably the soft pedal would be  down, but he had marvellously acute hearing, and he would be very much  surprised if he did not hear the recognisable chords, and even more  surprised if, when they came to practise the piece together, Lucia did  not give"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6841"],[0,"Mosaics of Grecian History (#10)"],[1,"weapons glittering in their hands)    Mankind is broken loose from moral bands:    No rights of hospitality remain;    The guest by him who harbored him is slain;    The son-in-law pursues the father's life;    The wife her husband murders, he the wife;    The step-dame poison for the son prepares,    The son inquires into his father's years.    Faith flies, and Piety in exile mourns;    And Justice, here oppressed, to heaven returns.    The Scriptures assert that the wickedness of mankind was the cause  of the Noachian flood, or deluge. So, also, we find that, in Grecian  mythology, like causes led to the deluge of Deuca'lion. Therefore,  before giving Ovid's account of this latter event, we give, from  Hesiod, a curious account of      THE ORIGIN OF EVIL, AND ITS INTRODUCTION INTO THE WORLD.    It appears from the legend that, during a controversy between  the gods and men, Pro-me'theus, [Footnote: In most Greek proper  names ending in 'eus', the 'eus' is pronounced in one syllable;  as Or'pheus, pronounced Or'phuse.] who is said to have surpassed  all his fellow-men in intellectual vigor and sagacity, stole fire  from the skies, and, concealing it in a hollow staff, brought it  to man. Jupiter, angry at the theft of that which had been reserved  from mortals for wise purposes, resolved to punish Prometheus, and  through him all mankind, to show that it was not given to man to  elude the wisdom of the gods. He therefore caused Vulcan to form  an image of air and water, to give it human voice and strength,  and make it assume the form of a beautiful woman, like the immortal  goddesses themselves. Minerva endowed this new creation with  artistic skill, Venus gave her the witchery of beauty, Mercury  inspired her with an artful disposition, and the Graces added  all their charms. But we append the following extracts from the  beautifully written account by Hesiod, beginning with the command  which Jupiter gave to Vulcan, the fire-god:      Thus spoke the sire, whom heaven and earth obey,    And bade the fire-god mould his plastic clay;    In-breathe the human voice within her breast;    With firm-strung nerves th'elastic limbs invest;    Her aspect fair as goddesses above--    A virgin's likeness, with the brows of love.      He bade Minerva teach the skill that dyes    The wool with color's as the shuttle flies:    He called the magic of Love's charming queen    To breathe around a witchery of mien;    Then plant the rankling stings of keen desire    And cares that trick the limbs with pranked attire:    Bade Her'mes [Footnote: Mercury.] last impart the Craft refined    Of thievish manners, and a shameless mind.      He gives command--the inferior powers obey--    The crippled artist [Footnote: Vulcan.] moulds the tempered clay:    A maid's coy image rose at Jove's behest;    Minerva clasped the zone, diffused too vest;    Adored Persuasion and the Graces young    Her tapered limbs with golden jewels hung;    Round her smooth brow the beauteous-tressed Hours    A garland twined of Spring's purpureal flowers.      The whole attire Minerva's graceful art    Disposed, adjusted, formed to every part;    And last, the winged herald [Footnote: Mercury.] of the skies,    Slayers of Argus, gave the gift of lies--    Gave trickish manners, honeyed words instilled,    As he that rolls the deepening thunder willed:    Then by the feathered messenger of Heaven    The name PANDO'RA to the maid was given;    For all the gods conferred a gifted grace    To crown this mischief of the mortal race.    Thus furnished, Pandora was brought as a gift from Jupiter to  the dwelling of Ep-i-me'theus, the brother of Prometheus; and  the former, dazzled by her charms, received her in spite of the  warnings of his sagacious brother, and made her his wife.      The sire commands the winged herald bear    The finished nymph, th' inextricable snare.    To Epimetheus was the present brought:    Prometheus' warning vanished from his thought--    That he disdain each offering of the skies,    And straight restore, lest ill to man arise.    But he received, and, conscious, knew too late    Th' insidious gift, and felt the curse of fate.    In the dwelling of Epimetheus stood a closed casket, which he  had been forbidden to open; but Pandora, disregarding the  injunction, raised the lid; when lo! to her consternation, all  the evils hitherto unknown to mortals poured out, and spread  themselves over the earth. In terror at the sight of these monsters,  Pandora shut down the lid just in time to prevent the escape of  Hope, which thus remained to man, his chief support and consolation  amid the trials of his pilgrimage.      On earth, of yore, the sons of men abode    From evil free, and labor's galling load;    Free from diseases that; with racking rage,    Precipitate the pale decline of age.    Now swift the days of manhood haste away,    And misery's pressure turns the temples gray.    The Woman's hands an ample casket bear;    She lifts the lid--she scatters ill in air.      Hope sole remained within, nor took her flight--    Beneath the vessel's verge concealed from light;    Issued the rest, in quick dispersion buried,    And woes innumerous roamed the breathing world:    With ills the land is full, with ills the sea;    Diseases haunt our frail humanity;    Self-wandering through the noon, at night they glide    Voiceless--a voice the power all-wise denied:    Know, then, this awful truth: it is not given    To elude the wisdom of omniscient Heaven.      --Trans. by ELTON.    PROFESSOR BLACKIE has made this legend the subject of a pleasing  poem, from which we take the following extracts, beginning with  the acceptance by Epimetheus of the gift from Jupiter. The deluded  mortal exclaims--      \"Bless thee, bless thee, gentle Hermes!      Once I sinned, and strove    Vainly with my haughty brother      'Gainst Olympian Jove.    Now my doubts his love hath vanquished;      Evil knows not he,    Whose free-streaming grace prepared      Such gift of gods for me.    Henceforth I and fair Pandora,      Joined in holy love,    Only one in heaven will worship--      Cloud-compelling Jove.\"    Thus he; and from the god received      The glorious gift of Jove,    And with fond embracement clasped her,      Thrilled by potent love;    And in loving dalliance with her      Lived from day to day,    While her bounteous smiles diffusive      Scared pale care away.      By the mountain, by the river,      'Neath the shaggy pine,    By the cool and grassy fountain      Where clear waters shine,    He with her did lightly stray,      Or softly did recline,    Drinking sweet intoxication      From that form divine.      One day, when the moon had wheeled      Four honeyed weeks away,    From her chamber came Pandora      Decked with trappings gay,    And before fond Epimetheus      Fondly she did stand,    A box all bright with lucid opal      Holding in her hand.      \"Dainty box!\" cried Epimetheus.      \"Dainty well may't be,\"    Quoth Pandora--\"curious Vulcan      Framed it cunningly;    Jove bestowed it in my dowry:      Like bright Phoebus' ray    It shines without; within, what wealth      I know not to this day.\"    It will be observed in what follows that the poet does not strictly  adhere to the legend as given by Hesiod, in which it is stated  that Pandora, probably under the influence of curiosity, herself  raised the lid of the mysterious casket. The poet, instead,  attributes the act to Epimetheus, and so relieves Pandora of the  odium and the guilt.      \"Let me see,\" quoth Epimetheus,      \"What my touch can do!\"    And swiftly to his finger's call      The box wide open flew.    O heaven! O hell! What Pandemonium      In the pouncet dwells!    How it quakes, and how it quivers;      How it seethes and swells!    Misty steams from it upwreathing,      Wave on wave is spread!    Like a charnel-vault, 'tis breathing      Vapors of the dead!    Fumes on fumes as from a throat      Of sooty Vulcan rise,    Clouds of red and blue and yellow      Blotting the fair skies!    And the air, with noisome stenches,      As from things that rot,    Chokes the breather--exhalation      From the infernal pot.    And amid the thick-curled vapors      Ghastly shapes I see    Of dire diseases, Epimetheus,      Launched on earth by thee.    A horrid crew! Some lean and dwindled,      Some with boils and blains    Blistered, some with tumors swollen,      And water in the veins;    Some with purple blotches bloated,      Some with humors flowing    Putrid, some with creeping tetter      Like a lichen growing    O'er the dry skin scaly-crusted;      Some with twisted spine    Dwarfing low with torture slow      The human form divine;    Limping some, some limbless lying;      Fever, with frantic air,    And pale consumption veiling death      With looks serenely fair.      All the troop of cureless evils,      Rushing reinless forth    From thy damned box, Pandora,      Seize the tainted earth!    And to lay the marshalled legions      Of our fiendish pains,    Hope alone, a sorry charmer,      In the box remains.    Epimetheus knew the dolors,      But he knew too late;    Jealous Jove himself, now vainly,      Would revoke the fate.    And he cursed the fair Pandora,      But he cursed in vain;    Still, to fools, the fleeting pleasure      Buys the lasting pain!      WHAT PROMETHEUS PERSONIFIED.    PROFESSOR BLACKIE says, regarding Prometheus, that the common  conception of him is, that he was the representative of freedom  in contest with despotism. He thinks, however, that Goethe is  nearer the depth of the myth when, in his beautiful lyric, he  represents Prometheus as the impersonation of that indefatigable  endurance in man which conquers the earth by skilful labor, in  opposition to and despite; those terrible influences of the wild,  elemental forces of Nature which the Greeks supposed were  concentrated in the person of Jove.
