In our former lectures we treated of the being, character,  perfections, and attributes of God. What we mean by perfections, is,  the perfections which belong to all the attributes of his nature. We  shall, in this lecture, speak of the Godhead: we mean the Father, Son,  and Holy Spirit.    2. There are two personages who constitute the great, matchless,  governing, and supreme power over all things--by whom all things  were created and made, that are created and made, whether visible or  invisible: whether in heaven, on earth, or in the earth, under the  earth, or throughout the immensity of space--They are the Father and  the Son: the Father being a personage of spirit, glory, and power:  possessing all perfection and fullness: the Son, who was in the bosom  of the Father, a personage of tabernacle, made, or fashioned like unto  man, or being in the form and likeness of man, or, rather, man was  formed after his likeness, and in his image;--he is also the express  image and likeness of the personage of the Father: possessing all the  fullness of the Father, or the same fulness with the Father; being  begotten of him, and ordained from before the foundation of the world  to be a propitiation for the sins of all those who should believe on  his name, and is called the Son because of the flesh--and descended in  suffering below that which man can suffer, or, in other words, suffered  greater sufferings, and was exposed to more powerful contradictions  than any man can be. But notwithstanding all this, he kept the law of  God, and remained without sin: Showing thereby that it is in the power  of man to keep the law and remain also without sin. And also, that  by him a righteous judgment might come upon all flesh, and that all  who walk not in the law of God, may justly be condemned by the law,  and have no excuse for their sins. And he being the Only Begotten of  the Father, full of grace and truth, and having overcome, received a  fullness of the glory of the Father--possessing the same mind with the  Father, which mind is the Holy Spirit, that bears record of the Father  and the Son, and these three are one, or in other words, these three  constitute the great, matchless, governing and supreme power over all  things: by whom all things were created and made, that were created and  made: and these three constitute the Godhead, and are one: the Father  and the Son possessing the same mind, the same wisdom, glory, power,  and fullness: Filling all in all--the Son being filled with the fulness  of the Mind, glory, and power, or, in other words, the Spirit, glory,  and power, of the Father--possessing all knowledge and glory, and the  same kingdom: sitting at the right hand of power, in the express image  and likeness of the Father--a mediator for man--being filled with the  fullness of the mind of the Father, or, in other words, the Spirit of  the Father: which Spirit is shed forth upon all who believe on his name  and keep his commandments: and all those who keep his commandments  shall grow up from grace to grace, and become heirs of the heavenly  kingdom, and joint heirs with Jesus Christ; possessing the same mind,  being transformed into the same image or likeness, even the express  image of him who fills all in all: being filled with the fullness of  his glory, and become one in him, even as the Father, Son and Holy  Spirit are one.    3. From the foregoing account of the Godhead, which is given in his  revelations, the Saints have a sure foundation laid for the exercise  of faith unto life and salvation, through the atonement and mediation  of Jesus Christ, by whose blood they have a forgiveness of sins, and  also a sure reward laid up for them in heaven, even that of partaking  of the fulness of the Father and the Son, through the Spirit. As the  Son partakes of the fullness of the Father through the Spirit, so the  saints are, by the same Spirit, to be partakers of the same fullness,  to enjoy the same glory; for as the Father and the Son are one, so in  like manner the saints are to be one in them, through the love of the  Father, the mediation of Jesus Christ, and the gift of the Holy Spirit;  they are to be heirs of God, and joint heirs with Jesus Christ.    _Question_. Of what do the foregoing lectures treat?    _Answer_. Of the being, perfections, and attributes of the Deity. [§5.  ¶1.]    Q. What are we to understand by the Reflections of the Deity?    A. The perfections which belong to his attributes.    Q. How many personages are there in the Godhead?    A. Two : the Father and Son. [§5. ¶1.]    Q. How do you prove that there are two personages in the Godhead?    A. By the Scriptures. Gen. 1:26. Also §2. ¶6. And the Lord God said  unto the Only Begotten, who was with him from the beginning, Let us  make man in our image, after our likeness:--and it was done. Gen. 3:22.  And the Lord God said unto the Only Begotten, Behold, the man is become  as one of us: to know good and evil. John, 17:5. And now, O Father,  glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with you  before the world was. [§5. ¶2.]    Q. What is the Father?    A. He is a personage of glory and of power. [§5. ¶2.]    Q. How do you prove that the Father is a personage of glory and of  power?    A. Isaiah 60:19. The Sun shall be no more thy light by day, neither for  brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the Lord shall be  unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory. 1 Chron. 29:11  Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory. Ps 29:3  The voice of the Lord is upon the waters: the God of glory thunders.  Ps 79:9. Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name.  Romans 1:23. And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an  image made like to corruptible man. Secondly, of power. 1 Chron. 29:4  Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory. Jer.  32:17 Ah! Lord God, behold thou hast made the earth and the heavens  by thy great power, and stretched-out arm; and there is nothing too  hard for thee. Deut 4:37. And because he loved thy fathers therefore  he chose their seed after them, and brought them out in his sight with  his mighty power. 2 Samuel 22:33. God is my strength and power. Job 26  commencing with the 7th verse to the end of the chapter. He stretcheth  out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.  He binds up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent  under them. He holds back the face of his throne, and spreads his  cloud upon it. He has compassed the waters with bounds, until the  day and night come to an end. The pillars of heaven tremble, and are  astonished at his reproof. He divideth the sea with his power, and by  his understanding he smites through the proud. By his Spirit he has  garnished the heavens; his hand has formed the crooked serpent. Lo,  these are parts of his ways! but how little a portion is heard of him?  But the thunder of his power who can understand?    Q. What is the Son?    A. First, he is a personage of tabernacle. [§5. ¶2.]    Q. How do you prove it?    A. John 14:9,10,11, Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time  with you, and yet have you not known me, Philip? He that has seen me  has seen the Father; and how do you say then, Show us the Father? Do  you not believe, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The  words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that  dwells in me he does the works. Believe me that I am in the Father and  the Father in me. Secondly, and being a personage of tabernacle, was  made or fashioned like unto man, or being in the form and likeness of  man. [§5. ¶2.] Philip. 2. Let this mind be in you, which was also in  Christ Jesus; who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to  be equal with God; but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him  the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of man, and, being  found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto  death, even the death of the cross. Heb. 2. 14, 16. Forasmuch then as  the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise  took part of the same. For verily he took not on him the nature of  angels: but he took on him the seed of Abraham. Thirdly, he is also in  the likeness of the personage of the Father. [§5. ¶2.] Heb 1. 1,2,3.  God, who at sundry times, and in divers manners, spake in times past to  the fathers, by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us  by his Son,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5669"],[0,"Considerations on Representative Government (#10)"],[1,"vested in the entire aggregate of the  community, every citizen not only having a voice in the exercise of  that ultimate sovereignty, but being, at least occasionally, called on  to take an actual part in the government by the personal discharge of  some public function, local or general.    To test this proposition, it has to be examined in reference to the  two branches into which, as pointed out in the last chapter, the  inquiry into the goodness of a government conveniently divides itself,  namely, how far it promotes the good management of the affairs of  society by means of the existing faculties, moral, intellectual, and  active, of its various members, and what is its effect in improving or  deteriorating those faculties.    The ideally best form of government, it is scarcely necessary to say,  does not mean one which is practicable or eligible in all states of  civilization, but the one which, in the circumstances in which it is  practicable and eligible, is attended with the greatest amount of  beneficial consequences, immediate and prospective. A completely  popular government is the only polity which can make out any claim to  this character. It is pre-eminent in both the departments between  which the excellence of a political Constitution is divided. It is  both more favorable to present good government, and promotes a better  and higher form of national character than any other polity  whatsoever.    Its superiority in reference to present well-being rests upon two  principles, of as universal truth and applicability as any general  propositions which can be laid down respecting human affairs. The  first is, that the rights and interests of every or any person are  only secure from being disregarded when the person interested is  himself able, and habitually disposed to stand up for them. The second  is, that the general prosperity attains a greater height, and is more  widely diffused, in proportion to the amount and variety of the  personal energies enlisted in promoting it.    Putting these two propositions into a shape more special to their  present application--human beings are only secure from evil at the  hands of others in proportion as they have the power of being, and  are, self-_protecting_; and they only achieve a high degree of success  in their struggle with Nature in proportion as they are  self-_dependent_, relying on what they themselves can do, either  separately or in concert, rather than on what others do for them.    The former proposition--that each is the only safe guardian of his own  rights and interests--is one of those elementary maxims of prudence  which every person capable of conducting his own affairs implicitly  acts upon wherever he himself is interested. Many, indeed, have a  great dislike to it as a political doctrine, and are fond of holding  it up to obloquy as a doctrine of universal selfishness. To which we  may answer, that whenever it ceases to be true that mankind, as a  rule, prefer themselves to others, and those nearest to them to those  more remote, from that moment Communism is not only practicable, but  the only defensible form of society, and will, when that time arrives,  be assuredly carried into effect. For my own part, not believing in  universal selfishness, I have no difficulty in admitting that  Communism would even now be practicable among the _elite_ of mankind,  and may become so among the rest. But as this opinion is any thing but  popular with those defenders of existing institutions who find fault  with the doctrine of the general predominance of self-interest, I am  inclined to think they do in reality believe that most men consider  themselves before other people. It is not, however, necessary to  affirm even thus much in order to support the claim of all to  participate in the sovereign power. We need not suppose that when  power resides in an exclusive class, that class will knowingly and  deliberately sacrifice the other classes to themselves: it suffices  that, in the absence of its natural defenders, the interest of the  excluded is always in danger of being overlooked; and, when looked at,  is seen with very different eyes from those of the persons whom it  directly concerns. In this country, for example, what are called the  working-classes may be considered as excluded from all direct  participation in the government. I do not believe that the classes who  do participate in it have in general any intention of sacrificing the  working classes to themselves. They once had that intention; witness  the persevering attempts so long made to keep down wages by law. But  in the present day, their ordinary disposition is the very opposite:  they willingly make considerable sacrifices, especially of their  pecuniary interest, for the benefit of the working classes, and err  rather by too lavish and indiscriminating beneficence; nor do I  believe that any rulers in history have been actuated by a more  sincere desire to do their duty towards the poorer portion of their  countrymen. Yet does Parliament, or almost any of the members  composing it, ever for an instant look at any question with the eyes  of a working man? When a subject arises in which the laborers as such  have an interest, is it regarded from any point of view but that of  the employers of labor? I do not say that the working men's view of  these questions is in general nearer to the truth than the other, but  it is sometimes quite as near; and in any case it ought to be  respectfully listened to, instead of being, as it is, not merely  turned away from, but ignored. On the question of strikes, for  instance, it is doubtful if there is so much as one among the leading  members of either House who is not firmly convinced that the reason of  the matter is unqualifiedly on the side of the masters, and that the  men's view of it is simply absurd. Those who have studied the question  know well how far this is from being the case, and in how different,  and how infinitely less superficial a manner the point would have to  be argued, if the classes who strike were able to make themselves  heard in Parliament.    It is an adherent condition of human affairs that no intention,  however sincere, of protecting the interests of others can make it  safe or salutary to tie up their own hands. Still more obviously true  is it that by their own hands only can any positive and durable  improvement of their circumstances in life be worked out. Through the  joint influence of these two principles, all free communities have  both been more exempt from social injustice and crime, and have  attained more brilliant prosperity than any others, or than they  themselves after they lost their freedom. Contrast the free states of  the world, while their freedom lasted, with the cotemporary subjects  of monarchical or oligarchical despotism: the Greek cities with the  Persian satrapies; the Italian republics and the free towns of  Flanders and Germany, with the feudal monarchies of Europe;  Switzerland, Holland, and England, with Austria or ante-revolutionary  France. Their superior prosperity was too obvious ever to have been  gainsayed; while their superiority in good government and social  relations is proved by the prosperity, and is manifest besides in  every page of history. If we compare, not one age with another, but  the different governments which coexisted in the same age, no amount  of disorder which exaggeration itself can pretend to have existed  amidst the publicity of the free states can be compared for a moment  with the contemptuous trampling upon the mass of the people which  pervaded the whole life of the monarchical countries, or the  disgusting individual tyranny which was of more than daily occurrence  under the systems of plunder which they called fiscal arrangements,  and in the secrecy of their frightful courts of justice.    It must be acknowledged that the benefits of freedom, so far as they  have hitherto been enjoyed, were obtained by the extension of its  privileges to a part only of the community; and that a government in  which they are extended impartially to all is a desideratum still  unrealized. But, though every approach to this has an independent  value, and in many cases more than an approach could not, in the  existing state of general improvement, be made, the participation of  all in these benefits is the ideally perfect conception of free  government. In proportion as any, no matter who, are excluded from it,  the interests of the excluded are left without the guaranty accorded  to the rest, and they themselves have less scope and encouragement  than they might otherwise have to that exertion of their energies for  the good of themselves and of the community, to which the general  prosperity is always proportioned.    Thus stands the case as regards present well-being--the good  management of the affairs of the existing generation. If we now pass  to the influence of the form of government upon character, we shall  find the superiority of popular government over every other to be, if  possible, still more decided and indisputable.    This question really depends upon a still more fundamental one, viz.,  which of two common types of character, for the general good of  humanity, it is most desirable should predominate--the active or the  passive type; that which struggles against evils, or that which  endures them; that which bends to circumstances, or that which  endeavours to make circumstances bend to itself.    The commonplaces of moralists and the general sympathies of mankind  are in favor of the passive type. Energetic characters may be admired,  but the acquiescent and submissive are those which most men personally  prefer. The passiveness of our neighbors increases our sense of  security, and plays into the hands of our wilfulness. Passive  characters, if we do not happen to need their activity, seem an  obstruction the less in our own path. A "]]]
