According to A. Agassiz, however, this is not the case, but  on the contrary \"the whole larva and all its appendages are gradually  drawn into the body, and appropriated.\"[30]    Fig. 39 represents the larva of a sea-egg (_Echino cidaris_) after  Mueller.[31] The body is transparent, shaped somewhat like a double  easel, but with two long horns in front, which, as well as the posterior  processes, are supported by calcareous rods. This larva swims by means  of minute vibratile hairs, or ciliae. It has a mouth, stomach, and in  fact a well-defined alimentary canal; but no nerves or other internal  organs have yet been discovered in it. After swimming about in this  condition for a while, it begins to show signs of change. An involution  of the integument takes place on one side of the back, and continues to  deepen till it reaches a mass or store of what is called blastema, or  the raw material of the animal body. This blastema then begins to  change, and gradually assumes the form of the perfect Echinoderm.[32]    [Illustration: FIG. 39.--Larva of _Echino cidaris_, seen from above x 6/10  (after Mueller).]    [Illustration: FIG. 40, Larva of _Echinus_, x 100. _A_, front arm; _F_,  arms of the mouth process; _B_, posterior side arm; _E_(1), accessory  arm of the mouth process; _a_, mouth; _a'_, oesophagus; _b_, stomach;  _b'_, intestine; _o_, posterior orifice; _d_, ciliated bands; _f_,  ciliated epaulets; _c_, disc of future _Echinus_ (after Mueller).]    Fig. 40 represents a larva, probably of another sea-egg (_Echinus  lividus_), from the Mediterranean, and shows the commencement of the  sea-egg within the body of the larva. The capital letters denote the  different arms: _a_ is the mouth, _a'_ the oesophagus, _b_ the  stomach, _b'_ the intestine, _f_ the ciliated lobes or epaulets, _c_ the  young sea-egg.    The development of the beautiful _Comatula rosacea_ (Fig. 41) has been  described in the \"Philosophical Transactions,\" by Prof. Wyville Thomson  and Dr. Carpenter.[33] The larva quits the egg, as shown in Fig. 42, in  the form of an oval body about 1/30 inch in length, something like a  barrel, surrounded by four bands or hoops of long vibratile hairs or  ciliae. There is also a tuft of still longer hairs at the narrower  posterior end of the body. Gradually a number of minute calcareous  spines and plates make their appearance (Fig. 43) in the body of this  larva, and at length arrange themselves in a definite order, so as to  form a bent calcareous club or rod with an enlarged head.    [Illustration: FIG. 41.--_Comatula rosacea_ (after Forbes).]    [Illustration: FIG. 42, Larva of Comatula rosacea (after Thomson). 43,  Larva of _Comatula rosacea_, more advanced. 44, Larva of Comatula rosacea,  in the Pentacrinus state.]    As this process continues, the little creature gradually loses its power  of swimming, and, sinking to the bottom, looses the bands of ciliae, and  attaches itself by its base to some stone or other solid substance, the  knob of the club being free. The calcareous framework increases in size,  and the expanded head forms itself into a cup, round which from five to  fifteen delicate tentacles, as shown in Fig. 44, make their appearance.    In this stage the young animal resembles one of the stalked Crinoids, a  family of Echinoderms very abundant in earlier geological periods, but  which has almost disappeared, being, as we see, now represented by the  young states of existing more advanced, free, species. This attached,  plant-like condition of _Comatula_ was indeed at first supposed to be a  mature form, and was named Pentacrinus; but we now know that it is only  a stage in the development of _Comatula_. The so-called Pentacrinus  increases considerably in size, and after various gradual changes, which  time does not now permit me to describe, quits the stalk, and becomes a  free _Comatula_.    The metamorphoses of the Starfishes are also very remarkable. Sars  discovered, in the year 1835, a curious little creature about an inch in  length, which he named _Bipinnaria asterigera_ (Figs. 45-47), and which  he then supposed to be allied to the ciliograde Medusae. Subsequent  observations, however, made in 1844, suggested to him that it was the  larva of a Starfish, and in 1847 MM. Koren and Danielssen satisfied  themselves that this was the case.    Figs. 45 and 46 represent the front and side view of a Bipinnaria found  by Mueller[34] near Marseilles. _a_ is the mouth, _b_ the oesophagus,  _c_ the stomach, _c_' the intestine. Fig. 47 represents a somewhat older  specimen, in which the Starfish (_k_) is already beginning to make its  appearance.    [Illustration: FIG. 45, Larva of Starfish (Bipinnaria), x 100 (after  Mueller). 46, Larva of Starfish (Bipinnaria), x 100, seen from the  side--_a_, mouth; _b_, oesophagus; _c_, stomach; _c'_, intestine. 47,  Larva of another Bipinnaria, showing the commencement of the  Starfish--_g_, canal of the ciliated sac; _i_, rudiments of tentacles;  _d_, ciliated band.]    But while certain Starfishes thus go through metamorphoses similar in  character, and not less remarkable than those of sea-eggs, there are  others--as, for instance, the genus _Asteracanthion_--in which development  may be said to be direct--the organs and appendages special to the  Pseud-embryo being in abeyance; while in another genus, _Pteraster_, they  are reduced to a mere investing membrane.[35]    Among the Ophiurans also we find two well-marked types of development.  Some passing through metamorphoses, while others, as for instance  _Ophiopholis bellis_, \"is developed very much after the method of  _Asteracanthion Muelleri_, without passing through the Plutean  stage.\"[36]    Even in the same species of Echinoderm the degree of development  attained by the larva differs to a certain extent according to the  temperature, the supply of food, &c. Thus in _Comatula_, specimens which  are liberally supplied with sea-water, and kept warm, hurry as it were  through their early stages, and the free larva becomes distorted by the  growing Pentacrinus (see Fig. 43), almost before it has attained its  perfect form. On the other hand, under less favourable conditions, if  the temperature is low and food less abundant, the early stages are  prolonged, the larva is longer lived, and reaches a much higher degree  of independent development. Similar differences occur in the development  of other animals, as for instance, in the Hydroids,[37] and among the  insects themselves, in Flies;[38] and it is obvious that these facts  throw much light on the nature and origin of the metamorphoses of  insects, which subject we shall now proceed to consider.          CHAPTER IV.    _ON THE ORIGIN OF METAMORPHOSES._      The question still remains, Why do insects pass through metamorphoses?  Messrs. Kirby and Spence tell us they \"can only answer that such is the  will of the Creator;\"[39] this, however, is a general confession of  faith, not an explanation of metamorphoses. So indeed they themselves  appear to have felt; for they immediately proceed to make a suggestion.  \"Yet one reason,\" they say, \"for this conformation may be hazarded. A  very important part assigned to insects in the economy of nature, as we  shall hereafter show, is that of speedily removing superabundant and  decaying animal and vegetable matter. For such agents an insatiable  voracity is an indispensable qualification, and not less so unusual  powers of multiplication. But these faculties are in a great degree  incompatible; an insect occupied in the work of reproduction could not  continue its voracious feeding. Its life, therefore, after leaving the  egg, is divided into three stages.\"    But there are some insects--as, for instance, the Aphides--which  certainly are not among the least voracious, and which grow and breed at  the same time. There are also many scavengers among other groups of  animals--such, for instance, as the dog, the pig, and the vulture--which  undergo no metamorphosis.    It is certainly true that, as a general rule, growth and reproduction do  not occur together; and it follows, almost as a necessary consequence,  that in such cases the first must precede the second. But this has no  immediate connection with the occurrence of metamorphoses. The question  is not, why an insect does not generally begin to breed until it has  ceased to grow, but why, in attaining to its perfect form, it passes  through such remarkable changes; why these changes are so sudden and  apparently violent; and why they are so often closed by a state of  immobility--that of the chrysalis or pupa; for undoubtedly the quiescent  and death-like condition of the pupa is one of the most remarkable  phenomena of insect-metamorphoses.    In the first place, it must be observed that many animals which differ  considerably in their mature state, resemble one another more nearly  when young. Thus birds of the same genus, or of closely allied genera,  which, when mature, differ much in colour, are often very similarly  coloured when young. The young of the lion and the puma are often  striped, and the foetal Black whale has teeth, like its ally the Sperm  whale.    In fact, the great majority of animals do go through well-marked  metamorphoses, though in many cases they are passed through within the  egg, and thus do not come within the popular ken. \"La larve,\" says,  Quatrefages, \"n'est qu'un embryon a vie independante.\"[40] Those  naturalists who accept in any form the theory of evolution, consider  that \"the embryonal state of each species reproduces more or less  completely"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38233"],[0,"Birds Every Child Should Know (#10)"],[1,"end of April or the first of May, these tireless gleaners  return to us from Central and South America where they have spent the  winter, which of course you know, is no winter on the other side of  the equator, but a continuation of summer for them. Competition for  food being more fierce in the tropics than it is here, millions of  birds besides the warblers and vireos travel from beyond the Isthmus  of Panama to the United States and back again every year in order that  they may live in perpetual summer with an abundance of food. If any  child thinks that birds are mere creatures of pleasure, who sing to  pass the time away, he doesn't begin to understand how hard they must  work for a living. They cannot limit their labours to an eight-hour  day. However, they keep cheerful through at least sixteen busy hours.    {71}    THE RED-EYED VIREO    Almost everywhere in the Eastern United States and Canada, the  red-eyed vireo is the most common member of his family. The only  individual touch to his costume that helps to distinguish him is a  gray cap edged with a black line which runs parallel to his  conspicuous white eyebrow. He wears a dull olive coat and a white  vest. But listen to the Preacher! You have no need to meet him face to  face in order to know him: _\"You see it--you know it--do you hear  me?--do you believe it?\"_ he propounds incessantly through the long  summer days, even after most other birds are silent. You cannot  mistake his voice. With a rising inflection at the end of each short,  jerky sentence, he asks a question very distinctly and sweetly, then  pauses an instant as if waiting for a reply--an unusually courteous  orator. His monotonous monologue, repeated over and over again, comes  to us from the elms and maples in the village street, the orchard and  woodland, where he keeps steadily and deliberately at work. Some boys  say they can whittle better if they whistle. Vireos seem to hunt more  thoroughly if they sing.    Like the rest of his kin, the red-eyed vireo is quite tame. A little  girl I know actually stroked the pretty head of a mother bird as she  sat brooding in her exquisite nest, and a week later {72} carried one  of the young birds all around the garden on a rake handle.    Vireos are remarkably fine builders--among the very best. Although  their nests are not so deep as the Baltimore orioles', the shape and  weave are similar. The red-eye usually prefers to swing her cradle  from a small crotch in an oak or apple tree or sapling, and securely  lace it through the rim on to the forked twigs. Nests vary in  appearance, but you will notice that these weavers show a preference  for dried grass as a foundation into which are wrought bits of bark,  lichen, wasps' nest \"paper,\" spider web, plant down, and curly vine  tendrils.      THE WHITE-EYED VIREO    It is not often that you can get close enough to any bird to see the  white of his eyes, but the brighter olive green of this vivacious  little white-eyed vireo's upper parts, his white breast, faintly  washed with yellow on the sides, and the two yellowish white bars on  his wings help you to recognise him at a distance. Imagine my surprise  to meet him in Bermuda, over six hundred miles out at sea from the  Carolina coast, where he, too, was taking a winter vacation! In those  beautiful islands, where our familiar catbirds and cardinals also  abound, {73} the white-eyed vireo is the most common bird to be seen.  His sweet, vigorous, irregular interrogation may be heard all day. But  there he is known by quite a different name--\"Chick of the Village.\"  It was a pleasant shock to hear, _\"Now, who are you, eh?\"_ piquantly  sung out at me, a stranger in the islands, by this old acquaintance in  a hibiscus bush within a few steps of the pier where the steamer  landed.    In the United States where he nests, his manners are less sociable; in  fact they are rather pert, even churlish at times, and never very  friendly. Here he loves to hide in such low, briery, bushy tangles as  the chat and catbird choose. By no stretch of the imagination would  his chic Bermuda name fit him here, for he has little to do with  villages and he resents your advances toward more intimate  acquaintance with harsh, cackling scoldings, half to himself, half to  you, until you, in turn, resent his impertinence and leave him alone--  just what the independent little fellow wanted. He has a strong,  decided character, you perceive.    His precious nest, so jealously guarded, is a deeper cup than that of  his cousin with the red eye, deeper than that of any of the other  vireos, and it usually contains three favourite materials in addition  to those generally chosen by them: they are bits of wood usually  stolen from some woodpecker's hole, shreds of paper, {74} and yards  and yards of fine caterpillar silk, by which the nest is hung from its  slender fork in the thicket. It also contains, not infrequently, alas!  a cowbird's most unwelcome egg.      THE YELLOW-THROATED VIREO    In a family not conspicuous for its fine feathers, this is certainly  the beauty. The clear lemon yellow worn at its throat spreads over its  vest; its coat is a richer and more yellowish green than the other  vireos wear, and its two white wing-bars are as conspicuous as the  white-eyed vireo's. Moreover its mellow and rich voice, like a  contralto's, is raised to a higher pitch at the end of a sweetly sung  triplet. _\"See me; I'm here; where are you?\"_ the singer inquires over  and over again from the trees in the woodland, or perhaps in the  village when nesting duties are not engrossing. Don't mistake it for  the chat simply because its throat is yellow.    As this is the beauty of the family, so is it also the best nest  builder.      THE WARBLING VIREO    High up in the top of elms and maples that line village streets where  the red-eyed vireo loves {75} to hunt, even among the trees of so busy  a thoroughfare as Boston Common, an almost continuous warble in the  early summer indicates that some unseen singer is hidden there; but  even if you get a glimpse of the warbling vireo you could not tell him  from his red-eyed cousin at that height. Modestly dressed, without  even a white eye-brow or wing-bars to relieve his plain dusty olive  and whitish clothes, he is the least impressive member of his  retiring, inconspicuous family. He asks you no questions in jerky,  colloquial triplets of song, so you may know by his voice at least  that he is not the red-eyed vireo. Some self-conscious birds, like the  song sparrow, mount to a conspicuous perch before they begin to sing,  as if they had to deliver a distinct number on a programme before a  waiting audience. Not so with this industrious little gleaner to whom  singing and dining seem to be a part of the same performance--one and  inseparable. He sings as he goes, snatching a bit of insect food  between warbles.    Although towns do not affright him, he really prefers wooded  border-land and clearings, especially where birch trees abound, when  it is time to rear a family.      [Illustration]    A red-eyed vireo baby in his cradle      [Illustration]    Out of it      [Illustration]    Home of the loggerhead shrike, with plenty of convenient hooks for  this butcher bird to hang meat on.      {76}    CHAPTER VI    BIRDS NOT OF A FEATHER      Two Butcher-birds    Cedar Waxwing    Scarlet Tanager      {77}    {78}    {79}    THE BUTCHER-BIRDS OR SHRIKES    Is it not curious that among our so-called song birds there should be  two, about the size of robins, the loggerhead and the northern shrike,  with the hawk-like habit of killing little birds and mice, and the  squirrel's and blue jay's trick of storing what they cannot eat? They  are butchers, with the thrifty custom of hanging up their meat, which  only improves in flavour and tenderness after a day or two of curing.  Then, even if storms should drive their little prey to shelter and  snow should cover the fields, they need not worry nor starve seeing an  abundance in their larder provided for the proverbial rainy day.    In the Southern and Middle States, where the smaller loggerhead shrike  is most common, some children say he looks like a mockingbird; but the  feathers on his back are surely quite a different gray, a light-bluish  ash, and pearly on his under parts, with white in his black wings and  tail which is conspicuous as he flies. His powerful head, which is  large for his size, has a heavy black line running from the end of his  mouth across his cheek, and his strong bill has a hook on the end  which is useful in tearing the {80} flesh from his victim's bones. He  really looks like nothing but just what he is--a butcher-bird. See  him, quiet and preoccupied, perched on a telegraph pole on the lookout  for a dinner! A kingbird, or other flycatcher which chooses similar  perches, would sail off suddenly into the air if a winged insect hove  in sight, snap it up, make an aerial loop in its flight and return to  its old place. Not so the solitary, sanguinary shrike. When his  wonderfully keen eyes detect a grasshopper, a cricket, a big beetle, a  lizard, a little mouse, or a sparrow at a distance in a field, he  drops like an eagle upon the victim, seizes it with his strong beak,  and flies with steady flapping strokes of the wings, close along the  ground, straight to the nearest honey locust or spiny thorn; then  rises with a sudden upward turn into the tree to impale his prey.  Hawks, who use the same method of procuring food, have very strong  feet; their talons are of great help in holding and killing their  victims; but the shrikes, which have rather weak, sparrow-like feet,  for perching only, are really compelled in many cases to make use of  stout thorns or sharp twigs to help them quiet the struggles of their  victims.
