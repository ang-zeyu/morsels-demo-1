And Setna said, \"Na-nefer-ka-ptah, is it aught disgraceful  (that you lay on me to do)?\" And Na-nefer-ka-ptah said, \"Setna, you know  this, that Ahura and Mer-ab, her child, behold! they are in Koptos;  bring them here into this tomb, by the skill of a good scribe. Let it be  impressed upon you to take pains, and to go to Koptos to bring them  here.\" Setna then went out from the tomb to the king, and told the king  all that Na-nefer-ka-ptah had told him.    The king said, \"Setna, go to Koptos and bring back Ahura and Mer-ab.\" He  answered the king, \"Let one give me the royal boat and its belongings.\"  And they gave him the royal boat and its belongings, and he left the  haven, and sailed without stopping till he came to Koptos.    And they made this known to the priests of Isis at Koptos and to the  high priest of Isis; and behold they came down to him, and gave him  their hand to the shore. He went up with them and entered into the  temple of Isis of Koptos and of Harpo-krates. He ordered one to offer  for him an ox, a goose, and some wine, and he made a burnt-offering and  a drink-offering before Isis of Koptos and Harpokrates. He went to the  cemetery of Koptos with the priests of Isis and the high priest of Isis.  They dug about for three days and three nights, for they searched even  in all the catacombs which were in the cemetery of Koptos; they turned  over the steles of the scribes of the \"double house of life,\" and read  the inscriptions that they found on them. But they could not find the  resting-place of Ahura and Mer-ab.    Now Na-nefer-ka-ptah perceived that they could not find the  resting-place of Ahura and her child Mer-ab. So he raised himself up as  a venerable, very old, ancient, and came before Setna. And Setna saw  him, and Setna said to the ancient, \"You look like a very old man, do  you know where is the resting-place of Ahura and her child Mer-ab?\"  The ancient said to Setna, \"It was told by the father of the father of  my father to the father of my father, and the father of my father has  told it to my father; the resting-place of Ahura and of her child Mer-ab  is in a mound south of the town of Pehemato (?)\" And Setna said to the  ancient, \"Perhaps we may do damage to Pehemato, and you are ready to  lead one to the town for the sake of that.\" The ancient replied to  Setna, \"If one listens to me, shall he therefore destroy the town of  Pehemato! If they do not find Ahura and her child Mer-ab under the south  corner of their town may I be disgraced.\" They attended to the ancient,  and found the resting-place of Ahura and her child Mer-ab under the  south corner of the town of Pehemato. Setna laid them in the royal boat  to bring them as honoured persons, and restored the town of Pehemato as  it originally was. And Na-nefer-ka-ptah made Setna to know that it was  he who had come to Koptos, to enable them to find out where the  resting-place was of Ahura and her child Mer-ab.    So Setna left the haven in the royal boat, and sailed without stopping,  and reached Memphis with all the soldiers who were with him. And when  they told the king he came down to the royal boat. He took them as  honoured persons escorted to the catacombs, in which Na-nefer-ka-ptah  was, and smoothed down the ground over them.    _This is the completed writing of the tale of Setna Kha-em-uast, and  Na-nefer-ka-ptah, and his wife Ahura, and their Mid Mer-ab. It was  written in the 35th year, the month Tybi._          REMARKS      This tale of Setna only exists in one copy, a demotic papyrus in the  Ghizeh Museum. The demotic was published in facsimile by Mariette in  1871, among \"Les Papyrus du Musee de Boulaq;\" and it has been  translated by Brugsch, Revillout, Maspero, and Hess. The last  version--\"Der Demotische Roman von Stne Ha-m-us, von J. J. Hess\"--being  a full study of the text with discussion and glossary, has been followed  here; while the interpretation of Maspero has also been kept in view in  the rendering of obscure passages.    Unhappily the opening of this tale is lost, and I have therefore  restored it by a recital of the circumstances which are referred to in  what remains. Nothing has been introduced which is not necessarily  involved or stated in the existing text. The limit of this restoration  is marked by ]; the papyrus beginning with the words, \"It is you who are  not dealing rightly with me.\"    The construction is complicated by the mixture of times and persons; and  we must remember that it was written in the Ptolemaic period concerning  an age long past. It stood to the author much as Tennyson's \"Harold\"  stands to us, referring to an historical age, without too strict a tie  to facts and details. Five different acts, as we may call them, succeed  one another. In the first act--which is entirely lost, and here only  outlined--the circumstances which led Setna of the XIXth Dynasty to  search for the magic book must have been related. In the second act  Ahura recites the long history of herself and family, to deter Setna  from his purpose. This act is a complete tale by itself, and belongs to  a time some generations before Setna; it is here supposed to belong to  the time of Amenhotep III., in the details of costume adopted for  illustration. The third act is Setna's struggle as a rival magician to  Na-nefer-ka-ptah, from which he finally comes off victorious by his  brother's use of a talisman, and so secures possession of the coveted  magic book. The fourth act--which I have here only summarised--shows how  Na-nefer-ka-ptah resorts to a bewitchment of Setna by a sprite, by  subjection to whom he loses his magic power. The fifth act shows Setna  as subjected to Na-nefer-ka-ptah, and ordered by him to bring the bodies  of his wife and child to Memphis into his tomb.    While, therefore, the sentimental climax of the tale--the restoration of  the unity of the family in one tomb--belongs to persons of the XVIIIth  Dynasty, the action of the tale is entirely of the XIXth Dynasty, for  what happened in the XVIIIth Dynasty (second act) is all related in the  XIXth. And the actual composition of it belongs to Ptolemaic times, not  only on the evidence of the manuscript, but also of the language; this  being certified by the importance of Isis and Horus at Koptos, which is  essentially a late worship there.    Turning now to the details, we may note that the statement that Setna  Kha-em-uast was a son of User-maat-ra (or Ramessu II.) occurs in the  fourth act which is here only summarised. Among the sons of Ramessu  historically known, the Prince Kha-em-uast (or \"Glory-in-Thebes\") was  the most important; he appears to have been the eldest son, exercising  the highest offices during his father's life. That the succession fell  on the thirteenth son, Mer-en-ptah, was doubtless due to the elder sons  having died during the preternaturally long reign of Ramessu.    The other main personage here is Na-nefer-ka-ptah (or \"Excellent is the  _ka_ of Ptah\"), who is said to be the son of a King Mer-neb-ptah. No  such name is known among historical kings; and it is probably a popular  corruption or abbreviation. It was pronounced Minibptah, the r being  dropped in early times. It would seem most like Mine-ptah or  Mer-en-ptah, the son and successor of Ramessu II.; but as the date of  Mer-neb-ptah is supposed to be some generations before that, such a  supposition would involve a great confusion on the scribes' part.  Another possibility is that it represents Amenhotep III.,  Neb-maat-ra-mer-ptah, pronounced as Nimu-rimiptah, which might be  shortened to Neb-mer-ptah or Mer-neb-ptah. Such a time would well suit  the tale, and that reign has been adopted here in fixing the style of  the dress of Ahura and her family.    This tale shows how far the _ka_ or double might wander from its body or  tomb. Here Ahura and her child lie buried at Koptos, while her husband's  tomb is at Memphis. But that does not separate them in death; her _ka_  left her tomb and went down to Memphis to live with the _ka_ of her  husband in his tomb. Thus, when Setna forces the tomb of  Na-nefer-ka-ptah, he finds Ahura seated by him with the precious magic  roll between them and the child Mer-ab; and the voluble Ahura recounts  all their history, and weeps when the roll is carried away by Setna. Yet  all the time her body is at Koptos, and the penalty imposed on Setna is  that of bringing her body to the tomb where her _ka_ already was  dwelling. If a _ka_ could thus wander so many hundred miles from its  body to gratify its affections, it would doubtless run some risks of  starving, or having to put up with impure food; or might even lose its  way, and rather than intrude on the wrong tomb, have to roam as a  vagabond _ka._ It was to guard against these misfortunes that a supply  of formulas were provided for it, by which it should obtain a guarantee  against such misfortunes--a kind of spiritual directory or guide to the  unprotected; and such formulas, when once accepted as valid, were  copied, repeated, enlarged, and added to, until they became the complex  and elaborate work--The Book of the Dead, Perhaps nothing else  gives such a view of the action of the _ka_ as this tale of Setna.    There is here also an insight into the arrangement of marriages in  Egypt. It does not seem that anything was determined about a marriage  during childhood; it is only when the children are full-grown that a  dispute arises between the king and queen as to their disposal. But the  parents decide the whole question. It is, of course, well known that the  Egyptians had no laws against consanguinity in marriages; on the  contrary, it was with them, as with the Persians, essential for a king  to marry in the royal family, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7423"],[0,"Mike (#10)"],[1,"tree, and a splash compared with which  the first had been as nothing, and all was over.    The dark waters were lashed into a maelstrom; and then two streaming  figures squelched up the further bank.    [Illustration: THE DARK WATERS WERE LASHED INTO A MAELSTROM]    The school stood in silent consternation. It was no occasion for light  apologies.    \"Do you know,\" said Wyatt, as he watched the Law shaking the water  from itself on the other side of the pond, \"I'm not half sure that we  hadn't better be moving!\"          CHAPTER IX    BEFORE THE STORM      Your real, devastating row has many points of resemblance with a  prairie fire. A man on a prairie lights his pipe, and throws away the  match. The flame catches a bunch of dry grass, and, before any one can  realise what is happening, sheets of fire are racing over the country;  and the interested neighbours are following their example. (I have  already compared a row with a thunderstorm; but both comparisons may  stand. In dealing with so vast a matter as a row there must be no  stint.)    The tomato which hit Wyatt in the face was the thrown-away match. But  for the unerring aim of the town marksman great events would never  have happened. A tomato is a trivial thing (though it is possible that  the man whom it hits may not think so), but in the present case, it  was the direct cause of epoch-making trouble.    The tomato hit Wyatt. Wyatt, with others, went to look for the  thrower. The remnants of the thrower's friends were placed in the  pond, and \"with them,\" as they say in the courts of law, Police  Constable Alfred Butt.    Following the chain of events, we find Mr. Butt, having prudently  changed his clothes, calling upon the headmaster.    The headmaster was grave and sympathetic; Mr. Butt fierce and  revengeful.    The imagination of the force is proverbial. Nurtured on motor-cars and  fed with stop-watches, it has become world-famous. Mr. Butt gave free  rein to it.    \"Threw me in, they did, sir. Yes, sir.\"    \"Threw you in!\"    \"Yes, sir. _Plop_!\" said Mr. Butt, with a certain sad relish.    \"Really, really!\" said the headmaster. \"Indeed! This is--dear me! I  shall certainly--They threw you in!--Yes, I shall--certainly----\"    Encouraged by this appreciative reception of his story, Mr. Butt  started it again, right from the beginning.    \"I was on my beat, sir, and I thought I heard a disturbance. I says to  myself, ''Allo,' I says, 'a frakkus. Lots of them all gathered  together, and fighting.' I says, beginning to suspect something,  'Wot's this all about, I wonder?' I says. 'Blow me if I don't think  it's a frakkus.' And,\" concluded Mr. Butt, with the air of one  confiding a secret, \"and it _was_ a frakkus!\"    \"And these boys actually threw you into the pond?\"    \"_Plop_, sir! Mrs. Butt is drying my uniform at home at this very  moment as we sit talking here, sir. She says to me, 'Why, whatever  _'ave_ you been a-doing? You're all wet.' And,\" he added, again  with the confidential air, \"I _was_ wet, too. Wringin' wet.\"    The headmaster's frown deepened.    \"And you are certain that your assailants were boys from the school?\"    \"Sure as I am that I'm sitting here, sir. They all 'ad their caps on  their heads, sir.\"    \"I have never heard of such a thing. I can hardly believe that it is  possible. They actually seized you, and threw you into the water----\"    \"_Splish_, sir!\" said the policeman, with a vividness of imagery  both surprising and gratifying.    The headmaster tapped restlessly on the floor with his foot.    \"How many boys were there?\" he asked.    \"Couple of 'undred, sir,\" said Mr. Butt promptly.    \"Two hundred!\"    \"It was dark, sir, and I couldn't see not to say properly; but if you  ask me my frank and private opinion I should say couple of 'undred.\"    \"H'm--Well, I will look into the matter at once. They shall be  punished.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Ye-e-s--H'm--Yes--Most severely.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Yes--Thank you, constable. Good-night.\"    \"Good-night, sir.\"    The headmaster of Wrykyn was not a motorist. Owing to this  disadvantage he made a mistake. Had he been a motorist, he would have  known that statements by the police in the matter of figures must be  divided by any number from two to ten, according to discretion. As it  was, he accepted Constable Butt's report almost as it stood. He  thought that he might possibly have been mistaken as to the exact  numbers of those concerned in his immersion; but he accepted the  statement in so far as it indicated that the thing had been the work  of a considerable section of the school, and not of only one or two  individuals. And this made all the difference to his method of dealing  with the affair. Had he known how few were the numbers of those  responsible for the cold in the head which subsequently attacked  Constable Butt, he would have asked for their names, and an extra  lesson would have settled the entire matter.    As it was, however, he got the impression that the school, as a whole,  was culpable, and he proceeded to punish the school as a whole.    It happened that, about a week before the pond episode, a certain  member of the Royal Family had recovered from a dangerous illness,  which at one time had looked like being fatal. No official holiday had  been given to the schools in honour of the recovery, but Eton and  Harrow had set the example, which was followed throughout the kingdom,  and Wrykyn had come into line with the rest. Only two days before the  O.W.'s matches the headmaster had given out a notice in the hall that  the following Friday would be a whole holiday; and the school, always  ready to stop work, had approved of the announcement exceedingly.    The step which the headmaster decided to take by way of avenging Mr.  Butt's wrongs was to stop this holiday.    He gave out a notice to that effect on the Monday.    The school was thunderstruck. It could not understand it. The pond  affair had, of course, become public property; and those who had had  nothing to do with it had been much amused. \"There'll be a frightful  row about it,\" they had said, thrilled with the pleasant excitement of  those who see trouble approaching and themselves looking on from a  comfortable distance without risk or uneasiness. They were not  malicious. They did not want to see their friends in difficulties. But  there is no denying that a row does break the monotony of a school  term. The thrilling feeling that something is going to happen is the  salt of life....    And here they were, right in it after all. The blow had fallen, and  crushed guilty and innocent alike.           *       *       *       *       *    The school's attitude can be summed up in three words. It was one  vast, blank, astounded \"Here, I say!\"    Everybody was saying it, though not always in those words. When  condensed, everybody's comment on the situation came to that.           *       *       *       *       *    There is something rather pathetic in the indignation of a school. It  must always, or nearly always, expend itself in words, and in private  at that. Even the consolation of getting on to platforms and shouting  at itself is denied to it. A public school has no Hyde Park.    There is every probability--in fact, it is certain--that, but for one  malcontent, the school's indignation would have been allowed to simmer  down in the usual way, and finally become a mere vague memory.    The malcontent was Wyatt. He had been responsible for the starting of  the matter, and he proceeded now to carry it on till it blazed up into  the biggest thing of its kind ever known at Wrykyn--the Great Picnic.           *       *       *       *       *    Any one who knows the public schools, their ironbound conservatism,  and, as a whole, intense respect for order and authority, will  appreciate the magnitude of his feat, even though he may not approve  of it. Leaders of men are rare. Leaders of boys are almost unknown. It  requires genius to sway a school.    It would be an absorbing task for a psychologist to trace the various  stages by which an impossibility was changed into a reality. Wyatt's  coolness and matter-of-fact determination were his chief weapons. His  popularity and reputation for lawlessness helped him. A conversation  which he had with Neville-Smith, a day-boy, is typical of the way in  which he forced his point of view on the school.    Neville-Smith was thoroughly representative of the average Wrykynian.  He could play his part in any minor \"rag\" which interested him, and  probably considered himself, on the whole, a daring sort of person.  But at heart he had an enormous respect for authority. Before he came  to Wyatt, he would not have dreamed of proceeding beyond words in his  revolt. Wyatt acted on him like some drug.    Neville-Smith came upon Wyatt on his way to the nets. The notice  concerning the holiday had only been given out that morning, and he  was full of it. He expressed his opinion of the headmaster freely and  in well-chosen words. He said it was a swindle, that it was all rot,  and that it was a beastly shame. He added that something ought to be  done about it.    \"What are you going to do?\" asked Wyatt.    \"Well,\" said Neville-Smith a little awkwardly, guiltily conscious that  he had been frothing, and scenting sarcasm, \"I don't suppose one can  actually _do_ anything.\"    \"Why not?\" said Wyatt.    \"What do you mean?\"    \"Why don't you take the holiday?\"    \"What? Not turn up on Friday!\"    \"Yes. I'm not going to.\"    Neville-Smith stopped and stared. Wyatt was unmoved.    \"You're what?\"    \"I simply sha'n't go to school.\"    \"You're rotting.\"    \"All right.\"    \"No, but, I say, ragging barred. Are you just going to cut off, though  the holiday's been stopped?\"    \"That's the idea.\"    \"You'll get sacked.\"    \"I suppose so. But only because I shall be the only one to do it. If  the whole school took Friday off, they couldn't do much. They couldn't  sack the"]]]
