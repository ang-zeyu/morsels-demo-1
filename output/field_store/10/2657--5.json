Oil   production is vital to the economy, contributing about 60% to GDP.   Despite the signing of a peace accord in November 1994 between the   Angola government and the UNITA insurgents, sporadic fighting   continues and many farmers remain reluctant to return to their fields.   As a result, much of the country's food requirements must still be   imported. Angola has rich natural resources - notably gold, diamonds,   and arable land, in addition to large oil deposits - but will need to   observe the cease-fire, implement the peace agreement, and reform   government policies if it is to achieve its potential.

And no doubt the little piece of propaganda gave every satisfaction to  those who ordered it, or they would not have passed it out to the Tyd,  and the touching little scene would never have reached our eyes. At  the same time the little tale would have been better suited to the  psychology of other countries if he had made the War Lord kneel when  he prayed in Cologne Cathedral, and if he had represented the Military  Staff as standing out of respect to One who, outside Germany, is held  in greater respect than the All Highest.    And had the War Lord really knelt is it not possible that he might  have found pity, humility, or even contrition? Things easily  overlooked in so large a cathedral when sitting erect, as a War Lord,  before the priests' choir, but to be noticed perhaps with one's eyes  turned to the ground.    Perhaps he nearly found one of those things. Perhaps he felt (who  knows?) just for a moment, that in the dimness of those enormous  aisles was something he had lost a long, long while ago.    One is not mistaken to credit the very bad with feeling far, faint  appeals from things of glory like Cologne Cathedral; it is that the  appeals come to them too far and faint on their headlong descent to  ruin.    For what was the War Lord seeking? Did he know that pity for his poor  slaughtered people, huddled by him on to our ceaseless machine guns,  might be found by seeking there? Or was it only that the lost thing,  whatever it was, made that faint appeal to him, passing the door by  chance, and drew him in, as the scent of some herb or flower in a  moment draws us back years to look for something lost in our youth; we  gaze back, wondering, and do not find it.    And to think that perhaps he lost it by very little! That, but for  that proud attitude and the respectful staff, he might have seen what  was lost, and have come out bringing pity for his people. Might have  said to the crowd that gave him that ovation, as we read, outside the  door: \"My pride has driven you to this needless war, my ambition has  made a sacrifice of millions, but it is over, and it shall be no more;  I will make no more conquests.\"    They would have killed him. But for that renunciation, perhaps,  however late, the curses of the widows of his people might have kept  away from his grave.    But he did not find it. He sat at prayer. Then he stood. Then he  marched out: and his staff marched out behind him. And in the gloom of  the floor of the vast Cologne Cathedral lie the things that the Kaiser  did not find and never will find now. Unnoticed thus, and in some  silent moment, passes a man's last chance.          The Last Mirage      The desolation that the German offensive has added to the dominions of  the Kaiser cannot easily be imagined by any one who has never seen a  desert. Look at it on the map and it is full of the names of towns and  villages; it is in Europe, where there are no deserts; it is a fertile  province among places of famous names. Surely it is a proud addition  to an ambitious monarch's possessions. Surely there is something there  that it is worth while to have conquered at the cost of army corps.  No, nothing. They are mirage towns. The farms grow Dead Sea fruit.  France recedes before the imperial clutch. France smiles, but not for  him. His new towns seem to be his because their names have not yet  been removed from any map, but they crumble at his approach because  France is not for him. His deadly ambition makes a waste before it as  it goes, clutching for cities. It comes to them and the cities are not  there.    I have seen mirages and have heard others told of, but the best  mirages of all we never hear described; the mirage that waterless  travellers see at the last. Those fountains rising out of onyx basins,  blue and straight into incredible heights, and falling and flooding  cool white marble; the haze of spray above their feathery heads  through which the pale green domes of weathered copper shimmer and  shake a little; mysterious temples, the tombs of unknown kings; the  cataracts coming down from rose-quartz cliffs, far off but seen quite  clearly, growing to rivers bearing curious barges to the golden courts  of Sahara. These things we never see; they are seen at the last by men  who die of thirst.    Even so has the Kaiser looked at the smiling plains of France. Even so  has he looked on her famous ancient cities and the farms and the  fertile fields and the woods and orchards of Picardy. With effort and  trouble he has moved towards them. As he comes near to them the cities  crumble, the woods shrivel and fall, the farms fade out of Picardy,  even the hedgerows go; it is bare, bare desert. He had been sure of  Paris, he had dreamed of Versailles and some monstrous coronation, he  had thought his insatiable avarice would be sated. For he had plotted  for conquest of the world, that boundless greed of his goading him on  as a man in the grip of thirst broods upon lakes.    He sees victory near him now. That also will fade in the desert of old  barbed wire and weeds. When will he see that a doom is over all his  ambitions? For his dreams of victory are like those last dreams that  come in deceptive deserts to dying men.    There is nothing good for him in the desert of the Somme. Bapaume is  not really there, though it be marked on his maps; it is only a  wilderness of slates and brick. Peronne looks like a city a long way  off, but when you come near it is only the shells of houses. Poziere,  Le Sars, Sapigny, are gone altogether.    And all is Dead Sea fruit in a visible desert. The reports of German  victories there are mirage like all the rest; they too will fade into  weeds and old barbed wire.    And the advances that look like victories, and the ruins that look  like cities, and the shell-beaten broken fields that look like  farms,--they and the dreams of conquest and all the plots and ambitions,  they are all the mirage of a dying dynasty in a desert it made for its  doom.    Bones lead up to the desert, bones are scattered about it, it is the  most menacing and calamitous waste of all the deadly places that have  been inclement to man. It flatters the Hohenzollerns with visions of  victory now because they are doomed by it and are about to die. When  their race has died the earth shall smile again, for their deadly  mirage shall oppress us no more. The cities shall rise again and the  farms come back; hedgerows and orchards shall be seen again; the woods  shall slowly lift their heads from the dust; and gardens shall come  again where the desert was, to bloom in happier ages that forget the  Hohenzollerns.          A Famous Man      Last winter a famous figure walked in Behagnies. Soldiers came to see  him from their billets all down the Arras road, from Ervillers and  from Sapigny, and from the ghosts of villages back from the road,  places that once were villages but are only names now. They would walk  three or four miles, those who could not get lorries, for his was one  of those names that all men know, not such a name as a soldier or poet  may win, but a name that all men know. They used to go there at  evening.    Four miles away on the left as you went from Ervillers, the guns  mumbled over the hills, low hills over which the Verys from the  trenches put up their heads and peered around,--greeny, yellowy  heads that turned the sky sickly, and the clouds lit up and went grey  again all the night long. As you got near to Behagnies you lost sight  of the Verys, but the guns mumbled on. A silly little train used to  run on one's left, which used to whistle loudly, as though it asked to  be shelled, but I never saw a shell coming its way; perhaps it knew  that the German gunners could not calculate how slow it went. It  crossed the road as you got down to Behagnies.    You passed the graves of two or three German soldiers with their names  on white wooden crosses,--men killed in 1914; and then a little  cemetery of a French cavalry regiment, where a big cross stood in the  middle with a wreath and a tricolor badge, and the names of the men.  And then one saw trees. That was always a wonder, whether one saw  their dark shapes in the evening, or whether one saw them by day, and  knew from the look of their leaves whether autumn had come yet, or  gone. In winter at evening one just saw the black bulk of them, but  that was no less marvellous than seeing them green in summer; trees by  the side of the Arras-Bapaume road, trees in mid-desert in the awful  region of Somme. There were not many of them, just a cluster, fewer  than the date palms in an oasis in Sahara, but an oasis is an oasis  wherever you find it, and a few trees make it. There are little places  here and there, few enough as the Arabs know, that the Sahara's deadly  sand has never been able to devastate; and there are places even in  the Somme that German malice, obeying the Kaiser as the sand of Sahara  obeys the accursed sirocco, has not been able to destroy quite to the  uttermost. That little cluster of trees at Behagnies is one of these;  Divisional Headquarters used to shelter beneath them; and near them  was a statue on a lawn which probably stood by the windows of some  fine house, though there is no trace of the house but the lawn and  that statue now.    And over the way on the left a little further on, just past the  officers' club, a large hall stood where one saw that famous figure,  whom officers and men alike would come so far to see.    The hall would hold perhaps four or five hundred seats in front of a  stage fitted up very simply with red, white and blue cloths, but  fitted up by some one that understood the job; and at the back of that  stage on those winter evenings walked on his flat and world-renowned"]]]
