In these cases the natives see in the  snake the envoy of Death, the fulfiller of the will of the bloodthirsty  Kali, the spouse of Shiva.    But evening, after the scorchingly hot day, was so tempting, and held  out to us from the distance such promise of delicious coolness, that we  decided upon risking our fate. In the heart of this wondrous nature one  longs to shake off earthly chains, and unite oneself with the boundless  life, so that death itself has its attractions in India.    Besides, the full moon was about to rise at eight p.m. Three hours'  ascent of the mountain, on such a moonlit, tropical night as would tax  the descriptive powers of the greatest artists, was worth any sacrifice.  Apropos, among the few artists who can fix upon canvas the subtle charm  of a moonlit night in India public opinion begins to name our own V.V.  Vereshtchagin.    Having dined hurriedly in the dak bungalow we asked for our sedan  chairs, and, drawing our roof-like topees over our eyes, we started.  Eight coolies, clad, as usual, in vine-leaves, took possession of each  chair and hurried up the mountain, uttering the shrieks and yells no  true Hindu can dispense with. Each chair was accompanied besides by a  relay of eight more porters. So we were sixty-four, without counting  the Hindus and their servants--an army sufficient to frighten any stray  leopard or jungle tiger, in fact any animal, except our fearless cousins  on the side of our great-grandfather Hanuman. As soon as we turned into  a thicket at the foot of the Mountain, several dozens of these kinsmen  joined our procession. Thanks to the achievements of Rama's ally,  monkeys are sacred in India. The Government, emulating the earlier  wisdom of the East India Company, forbids everyone to molest them, not  only when met with in the forests, which in all justice belong to them,  but even when they invade the city gardens. Leaping from one branch  to another, chattering like magpies, and making the most formidable  grimaces, they followed us all the way, like so many midnight spooks.  Sometimes they hung on the trees in full moonlight, like forest nymphs  of Russian mythology; sometimes they preceded us, awaiting our arrival  at the turns of the road as if showing us the way. They never left us.  One monkey babe alighted on my knees. In a moment the authoress of his  being, jumping without any ceremony over the coolies' shoulders, came to  his rescue, picked him up, and, after making the most ungodly grimace at  me, ran away with him.    \"Bandras (monkeys) bring luck with their presence,\" remarked one of  the Hindus, as if to console me for the loss of my crumpled topee.  \"Besides,\" he added, \"seeing them here we may be sure that there is not  a single tiger for ten miles round.\"    Higher and higher we ascended by the steep winding path, and the forest  grew perceptibly thicker, darker, and more impenetrable. Some of the  thickets were as dark as graves. Passing under hundred-year-old banyans  it was impossible to distinguish one's own finger at the distance of two  inches. It seemed to me that in certain places it would not be possible  to advance without feeling our way, but our coolies never made a false  step, but hastened onwards. Not one of us uttered a word. It was as if  we had agreed to be silent at these moments. We felt as though wrapped  in the heavy veil of dark-ness, and no sound was heard but the short,  irregular breathing of the porters, and the cadence of their quick,  nervous footsteps upon the stony soil of the path. One felt sick at  heart and ashamed of belonging to that human race, one part of which  makes of the other mere beasts of burden. These poor wretches are paid  for their work four annas a day all the year round. Four annas for going  eight miles upwards and eight miles downwards not less than twice a  day; altogether thirty-two miles up and down a mountain 1,500 feet high,  carrying a burden of two hundredweight! However, India is a country  where everything is adjusted to never changing customs, and four annas a  day is the pay for unskilled labor of any kind.    Gradually open spaces and glades became more frequent and the light grew  as intense as by day. Millions of grasshoppers were shrilling in  the forest, filling the air with a metallic throbbing, and flocks of  frightened parrots rushed from tree to tree. Sometimes the thundering,  prolonged roars of tigers rose from the bottom of the precipices thickly  covered with all kinds of vegetation. Shikaris assure us that, on a  quiet night, the roaring of these beasts can be heard for many miles  around. The panorama, lit up, as if by Bengal fires, changed at every  turn. Rivers, fields, forests, and rocks, spread out at our feet over  an enormous distance, moved and trembled, iridescent, in the silvery  moonlight, like the tides of a mirage. The fantastic character of the  pictures made us hold our breath. Our heads grew giddy if, by chance, we  glanced down into the depths by the flickering moonlight. We felt that  the precipice, 2,000 feet deep, was fascinating us. One of our American  fellow travelers, who had begun the voyage on horseback, had to  dismount, afraid of being unable to resist the temptation to dive head  foremost into the abyss.    Several times we met with lonely pedestrians, men and young women,  coming down Mataran on their way home after a day's work. It often  happens that some of them never reach home. The police unconcernedly  report that the missing man has been carried off by a tiger, or killed  by a snake. All is said, and he is soon entirely forgotten. One person,  more or less, out of the two hundred and forty millions who inhabit  India does not matter much! But there exists a very strange superstition  in the Deccan about this mysterious, and only partially explored,  mountain. The natives assert that, in spite of the considerable number  of victims, there has never been found a single skeleton. The corpse,  whether intact or mangled by tigers, is immediately carried away by the  monkeys, who, in the latter case, gather the scattered bones, and bury  them skillfully in deep holes, that no traces ever remain. Englishmen  laugh at this superstition, but the police do not deny the fact of the  entire disappearance of the bodies. When the sides of the mountain were  excavated, in the course of the construction of the railway, separate  bones, with the marks of tigers' teeth upon them, broken bracelets, and  other adornments, were found at an incredible depth from the surface.  The fact of these things being broken showed clearly that they were not  buried by men, because, neither the religion of the Hindus, nor their  greed, would allow them to break and bury silver and gold. Is it  possible, then, that, as amongst men one hand washes the other, so in  the animal kingdom one species conceals the crimes of another?    Having spent the night in a Portuguese inn, woven like an eagle's nest  out of bamboos, and clinging to the almost vertical side of a rock, we  rose at daybreak, and, having visited all the points de vue famed for  their beauty, made our preparations to return to Narel. By daylight  the panorama was still more splendid than by night; volumes would not  suffice to describe it. Had it not been that on three sides the horizon  was shut out by rugged ridges of mountain, the whole of the Deccan  plateau would have appeared before our eyes. Bombay was so distinct that  it seemed quite near to us, and the channel that separates the town from  Salsetta shone like a tiny silvery streak. It winds like a snake on its  way to the port, surrounding Kanari and other islets, which look the  very image of green peas scattered on the white cloth of its bright  waters, and, finally, joins the blinding line of the Indian Ocean in the  extreme distance. On the outer side is the northern Konkan, terminated  by the Tal-Ghats, the needle-like summits of the Jano-Maoli rocks, and,  lastly, the battlemented ridge of Funell, whose bold silhouette stands  out in strong relief against the distant blue of the dim sky, like a  giant's castle in some fairy tale. Further on looms Parbul, whose flat  summit, in the days of old, was the seat of the gods, whence, according  to the legends, Vishnu spoke to mortals. And there below, where the  defile widens into a valley, all covered with huge separate rocks, each  of which is crowded with historical and mythological legends, you may  perceive the dim blue ridge of mountains, still loftier and still more  strangely shaped. That is Khandala, which is overhung by a huge stone  block, known by the name of the Duke's Nose. On the opposite side, under  the very summit of the mountain, is situated Karli, which, according  to the unanimous opinion or archeologists, is the most ancient and best  preserved of Indian cave temples.    One who has traversed the passes of the Caucasus again and again; one  who, from the top of the Cross Mountain, has beheld beneath her feet  thunderstorms and lightnings; who has visited the Alps and the Rigi;  who is well acquainted with the Andes and Cordilleras, and knows  every corner of the Catskills in America, may be allowed, I hope, the  expression of a humble opinion. The Caucasian Mountains, I do not deny,  are more majestic than Ghats of India, and their splendour cannot be  dimmed by comparison with these; but their beauty is of a type, if I may  use this expression. At their sight one experiences true delight, but  at the same time a sensation of awe. One feels like a pigmy before  these Titans of nature. But in India, the Himalayas excepted, mountains  produce quite a different impression. The highest summits of the Deccan,  as well as of the triangular ridge that fringes Northern Hindostan, and  of the Eastern Ghats, do not exceed 3,000 feet. Only in the Ghats of the  Malabar coast,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6702"],[0,"Life of Harriet Beecher Stowe (#10)"],[1,"saying  things that when I come to reflect I almost always go over to your  side.... My mind is often perplexed, and such thoughts arise in it  that I cannot pray, and I become bewildered. The wonder to me is, how  all ministers and all Christians can feel themselves so inexcusably  sinful, when it seems to me we all come into the world in such a way  that it would be miraculous if we did not sin. Mr. Hawes always says in  prayer, 'We have nothing to offer in extenuation of any of our sins,'  and I always think when he says it, that we have everything to offer  in extenuation. The case seems to me exactly as if I had been brought  into the world with such a thirst for ardent spirits that there was  just a possibility, though no hope, that I should resist, and then  my eternal happiness made dependent on my being temperate. Sometimes  when I try to confess my sins, I feel that after all I am more to be  pitied than blamed, for I have never known the time when I have not  had a temptation within me so strong that it was certain I should not  overcome it. This thought shocks me, but it comes with such force, and  so appealingly, to all my consciousness, that it stifles all sense of  sin....    \"Sometimes when I read the Bible, it seems to be wholly grounded on  the idea that the sin of man is astonishing, inexcusable, and without  palliation or cause, and the atonement is spoken of as such a wonderful  and undeserved mercy that I am filled with amazement. Yet if I give up  the Bible I gain nothing, for the providence of God in nature is just  as full of mystery, and of the two I think that the Bible, with all its  difficulties, is preferable to being without it; for the Bible holds  out the hope that in a future world all shall be made plain.... So you  see I am, as Mr. Hawes says, 'on the waves,' and all I can do is to  take the word of God that He does do right and there I rest.\"    The following summer, in July, she writes to Edward: \"I have never  been so happy as this summer. I began it in more suffering than I  ever before have felt, but there is One whom I daily thank for all  that suffering, since I hope that it has brought me at last to rest  entirely in Him. I do hope that my long, long course of wandering and  darkness and unhappiness is over, and that I have found in Him who died  for me all, and more than all, I could desire. Oh, Edward, you can  feel as I do; you can speak of Him! There are few, very few, who can.  Christians in general do not seem to look to Him as their best friend,  or realize anything of his unutterable love. They speak with a cold,  vague, reverential awe, but do not speak as if in the habit of close  and near communion; as if they confided to Him every joy and sorrow and  constantly looked to Him for direction and guidance. I cannot express  to you, my brother, I cannot tell you, how that Saviour appears to me.  To bear with one so imperfect, so weak, so inconsistent, as myself,  implied, long-suffering and patience more than words can express. I  love most to look on Christ as my teacher, as one who, knowing the  utmost of my sinfulness, my waywardness, my folly, can still have  patience; can reform, purify, and daily make me more like himself.\"    So, after four years of struggling and suffering, she returns to the  place where she started from as a child of thirteen. It has been  like watching a ship with straining masts and storm-beaten sails,  buffeted by the waves, making for the harbor, and coming at last to  quiet anchorage. There have been, of course, times of darkness and  depression, but never any permanent loss of the religious trustfulness  and peace of mind indicated by this letter.    The next three years were passed partly in Boston, and partly in  Guilford and Hartford. Writing of this period of her life to the Rev.  Charles Beecher, she says:--        MY DEAR BROTHER,--The looking over of father's letters      in the period of his Boston life brings forcibly to      my mind many recollections. At this time I was more      with him, and associated in companionship of thought      and feeling for a longer period than any other of my      experience.    In the summer of 1832 she writes to Miss May, revealing her spiritual  and intellectual life in a degree unusual, even for her.    \"After the disquisition on myself above cited, you will be prepared to  understand the changes through which this wonderful _ego et me ipse_  has passed.    \"The amount of the matter has been, as this inner world of mine has  become worn out and untenable, I have at last concluded to come out of  it and live in the external one, and, as F---- S---- once advised me,  to give up the pernicious habit of meditation to the first Methodist  minister that would take it, and try to mix in society somewhat as  another person would.    \"'_Horas non numero nisi serenas._' Uncle Samuel, who sits by me,  has just been reading the above motto, the inscription on a sun-dial  in Venice. It strikes me as having a distant relationship to what I  was going to say. I have come to a firm resolution to count no hours  but unclouded ones, and to let all others slip out of my memory and  reckoning as quickly as possible....    \"I am trying to cultivate a general spirit of kindliness towards  everybody. Instead of shrinking into a corner to notice how other  people behave, I am holding out my hand to the right and to the left,  and forming casual or incidental acquaintances with all who will be  acquainted with me. In this way I find society full of interest and  pleasure--a pleasure which pleaseth me more because it is not old and  worn out. From these friendships I expect little; therefore generally  receive more than I expect. From past friendships I have expected  everything, and must of necessity have been disappointed. The kind  words and looks and smiles I call forth by looking and smiling are not  much by themselves, but they form a very pretty flower border to the  way of life. They embellish the day or the hour as it passes, and when  they fade they only do just as you expected they would. This kind of  pleasure in acquaintanceship is new to me. I never tried it before.  When I used to meet persons, the first inquiry was, 'Have they such and  such a character, or have they anything that might possibly be of use  or harm to me?'\"    It is striking, the degree of interest a letter had for her.    \"Your long letter came this morning. It revived much in my heart.  Just think how glad I must have been this morning to hear from you. I  was glad.... I thought of it through all the vexations of school this  morning.... I have a letter at home; and when I came home from school,  I went leisurely over it.    \"This evening I have spent in a little social party,--a dozen or  so,--and I have been zealously talking all the evening. When I  came to my cold, lonely room, there was your letter lying on the  dressing-table. It touched me with a sort of painful pleasure, for it  seems to me uncertain, improbable, that I shall ever return and find  you as I have found your letter. Oh, my dear G----, it is scarcely  well to love friends thus. The greater part that I see cannot move me  deeply. They are present, and I enjoy them; they pass and I forget  them. But those that I love differently; those that I LOVE; and oh,  how much that word means! I feel sadly about them. They may change;  they must die; they are separated from me, and I ask myself why should  I wish to love with all the pains and penalties of such conditions? I  check myself when expressing feelings like this, so much has been said  of it by the sentimental, who talk what they could not have felt. But  it is so deeply, sincerely so in me, that sometimes it will overflow.  Well, there is a heaven,--a heaven,--a world of love, and love after  all is the life-blood, the existence, the all in all of mind.\"    This is the key to her whole life. She was impelled by love, and did  what she did, and wrote what she did, under the impulse of love. Never  could \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" or \"The Minister's Wooing\" have been written,  unless by one to whom love was the \"life-blood of existence, the all in  all of mind.\" Years afterwards Mrs. Browning was to express this same  thought in the language of poetry.        \"But when a soul by choice and conscience doth       Throw out her full force on another soul,       The conscience and the concentration both       Make mere life love. For life in perfect whole       And aim consummated is love in sooth,       As nature's magnet heat rounds pole with pole.\"          CHAPTER III    CINCINNATI, 1832-1836.        DR. BEECHER CALLED TO CINCINNATI.--THE WESTWARD      JOURNEY.--FIRST LETTER FROM HOME.--DESCRIPTION      OF WALNUT HILLS.--STARTING A NEW SCHOOL.--INWARD      GLIMPSES.--THE SEMI-COLON CLUB.--EARLY IMPRESSIONS OF      SLAVERY.--A JOURNEY TO THE EAST.--THOUGHTS AROUSED BY      FIRST VISIT TO NIAGARA.--MARRIAGE TO PROFESSOR STOWE.      IN 1832, after having been settled for six years over the Hanover  Street Church in Boston, Dr. Beecher received and finally accepted a  most urgent call to become President of Lane Theological Seminary in  Cincinnati. This institution had been chartered in 1829, and in 1831  funds to the amount of nearly $70,000 had been promised to it provided  that Dr. Beecher accepted the presidency. It was hard for this New  England family to sever the ties of a lifetime and enter on so long  a journey to the far distant West of those days; but being fully  persuaded that their duty lay in this direction, they undertook to  perform it cheerfully and willingly. With Dr. Beecher and his wife were  to go Miss Catherine Beecher, who had conceived the scheme of founding  in Cincinnati, then considered the capital of the West, a female  college, and Harriet, who was to act as her principal assistant. In the  party were also George, who was to enter Lane as a student, Isabella,  James, the youngest son, "]]]
