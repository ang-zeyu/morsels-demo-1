For instance, during a scarcity or a hard  winter, not all of those who experience privation have recourse to  theft, but some prefer to endure want, however undeserved, without  ceasing to be honest, whilst others are at the utmost driven to  beg their food; and amongst those who yield to the suggestion of  crime, some stop short at simple theft, whilst others go as far as  robbery with violence.    But the true difference between the born and the occasional  criminal is that, with the former, the <p 42>external cause is  less operative than the internal tendency, because this tendency  possesses, as it were, a centrifugal force, driving the individual  to commit crime, whilst, for the occasional criminal, it is rather  a case of feeble power of resistance against external causes, to  which most of the inducement to crime is due.    The casual provocation of crime in the born criminal is generally  the outcome of an instinct or tendency already existing, and far  more of a pretext than an occasion of crime.  With the occasional  criminal, on the other hand, it is the casual provocation which  matures, no doubt in a favouring soil, the growth of criminal  tendencies not previously developed.    For this reason Lombroso calls the occasional criminals  ``criminaloids,'' in order to show precisely that they have a  distinctly abnormal constitution, though in a less degree than the  born criminals, just as we have the metal and the metalloid, the  epileptic and the epileptoid.    And this, again, is the reason why Lombroso's criticisms on my  description of occasional criminals are lacking in force.  He  says, as Benedikt said at the Congress at Rome, that all criminals  are criminals by birth, so that there is no such thing as an  occasional criminal, in the sense of a _*normal_ individual  casually launched into crime.  But I have not, any more than  Garofalo, drawn such a picture of the occasional criminal, for as  a matter of fact I have said precisely the opposite, as indeed  Lombroso himself acknowledges a little further on (ii. 422),  <p 43>namely, that between the born and the occasional criminal  there is only a difference of degree and modality, as in all the  criminal classes.    To cite a few details of criminal psychology, it may be stated  that of the two physiological conditions of crime, moral  insensibility and improvidence, occasional crime is especially due  to the latter, and inborn and habitual crime to the former.  With  the born criminal it is, above all, the lack or the weakness of  moral sense which fails to withstand crime, whereas with the  occasional criminal the moral sense is almost normal, but  inability to realise beforehand the consequences of his act causes  him to yield to external influences.    Every man, however pure and honest he may be, is conscious now and  then of a transitory notion of some dishonest or criminal action.  But with the honest man, exactly because he is physically and  morally normal, this notion of crime, which simultaneously summons  up the idea of its grievous consequences, glances off the surface  of the normal conscience, and is a mere flash without the thunder.  With the man who is less normal and has less forethought, the  notion dwells, resists the weak repulsion of a not too vigorous  moral sense, and finally prevails; for, as Victor Hugo says,  ``Face to face with duty, to hesitate is to be lost.''[11]      [11] For instance, I will recall a fact which Morel has related of  himself, how one day, as he was crossing a bridge in Paris, he saw  a working-man gazing into the water, and a homicidal idea flashed  across his mind, so that he had to hurry away, for fear of  yielding to the temptation to throw the man into the water.  Again, there is the case of Humboldt's nurse, who was attacked one  day by the temptation to kill her charge, and ran with him to his  mother in order to avoid a <p 44>disaster.  Brierre de Boismont  also tells us of a learned man who, at the sight of a picture in a  public gallery, was tempted to cut the canvas, and ran away from  his impulse to crime.    <p 44>    The criminal of passion is one who is strong enough to resist  ordinary temptations of no exceptional force, to which the  occasional criminal would yield, but who does not resist  psychological storms which indeed are sometimes actually  irresistible.    The forms of occasional criminality, which are determined by these  ordinary temptations, are also determined by age, sex, poverty,  worldly influences, influences of moral environment, alcoholism,  personal surroundings, and imitation.  Tarde has ably demonstrated  the persistent influence of these conditions on the actions of  men.    In this connection, Lombroso has drawn a clear distinction between  two varieties of occasional criminals: the ``pseudo-criminals,''  or normal human beings who commit involuntary offences, or  offences which do not spring from perversity, and do not hurt  society, though they are punishable by law, and ``criminaloids,''  who commit ordinary offences, but differ from true criminals for  the reasons already given.      A final observation is necessary in regard to this anthropological  classification of criminals, and it meets various objections  raised by our syllogistic critics.  The difference existing  amongst the five categories is only one of degree, and depends  upon their organic and psychological types, and upon the influence  of physical and social environment.    In every natural classification the differences <p 45>between  various groups and varieties are never anything but relative.  This deprives them of none of their theoretical and practical  importance, and so it is with this anthropological classification  of criminals.    It follows that, as in natural history we advance by degrees and  shades from the inorganic to the organic creation, life beginning  in the mineral domain with the laws of crystallisation, so in  criminal anthropology we pass by degrees and shades from the mad  to the born criminal, through the links of moral madmen and  epileptics; and from the born criminal to the occasional, through  the link of the habitual criminal, who begins by being an  occasional criminal, and ends by acquiring and transmitting to his  children the characteristics of the born criminal.  And finally,  we pass from the occasional criminal to the criminal of passion,  who is but a species of the other, and who further, with his  neurotic and epileptoid temperament, not infrequently approximates  to the criminal of unsound mind.    Thus in our everyday life, as in science, we very often find  intermediate types, for complete and unmixed types are always the  most uncommon.  And whilst legislators and judges, in their  complacent psychology, exact and establish marked lines of  cleavage between the sane and the insane criminal, experts in  psychiatry and anthropology are often constrained to place a  prisoner somewhere between the mad and the born criminal, or  between the occasional criminal and the normal man.    But it is evident that even when a criminal cannot be classed  precisely in one or the other category, and <p 46>stands between  the two, this is in itself a sufficiently definite classification,  especially from a sociological point of view.  There is  consequently no weight in the objection of those who, basing their  argument on an abstract and nebulous idea of the criminal in  general, and judging him merely according to the crime which has  been committed, without knowing his personal characteristics and  the circumstances of his environment, affirm that criminal  anthropology cannot classify all who are detained and accused.    In my experience, however, as a counsel and as an observer, I have  never had any difficulty in classifying all persons detained or  condemned for crimes and offences, by relying upon organic, and  especially upon psychological symptoms.    Thus, as Garofalo recently said, whilst the accepted criminal  science recognises only two terms, the offence and the punishment,  criminal sociology on the other hand recognises three: the crime,  the criminal, and the means best calculated for social self-  defence.  And it may be concluded that up to this time, science,  legislation, and, in a minor degree, but without any scientific  method, the administration of justice, have judged and punished  crime in the person of the criminal, but that hereafter it will be  necessary to judge the criminal as well as the crime.      After these general observations on the anthropological classes of  criminals, it might seem necessary to establish their respective  numerical proportions.  But as there is no absolute separation  between one <p 47>and another, and as the frequency of the several  criminal types varies according to the crimes or offences, natural  or otherwise, against persons or property, no precise account can  be rendered of the criminal world as a whole.    By way of approximation, however, it may be said in the first  place that the classes of mad criminals and criminals of passion  are the least numerous, and represent something like 5 or 10 per  cent. of the total.    On the other hand, we have seen that born and habitual criminals  are about 40 or 50 per cent.; so that the occasional criminals  would also be between 40 and 50 per cent.    These are figures which naturally vary according to the different  groups of crime and of criminals which come under observation, and  which cannot be more accurately determined without a series of  special studies in criminal anthropology, as I said when answering  the objections which have been raised against the methods of this  novel science.    It remains for us, before concluding our first"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47703"],[0,"Wilford Woodruff, Fourth President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day (#10)"],[1,"spirit of the Lord has rested upon me for two weeks  and said, \"Go to Rhode Island.\"' In about an hour after this my brother  Asahel arrived on a visit. After shaking hands with him, almost the  first words he spoke were: 'I wonder what the Lord wants of me in  Rhode Island! The spirit of the Lord has been upon me for two or three  weeks and has told me to go to Rhode Island.' This caused us to marvel  exceedingly. We had not seen each other for several months. My brother  Azmon thought that as we were ready to go to New York, we better not  go to Rhode Island. To this we consented with great reluctance. I  felt sure it was our duty to go there, although at that time it was a  mystery.\"    Later on when the gospel came to them in New York, Wilford learned  that if they had gone to Rhode Island they would have met Elders Orson  Hyde and Samuel H. Smith and would have thus received the gospel at an  earlier date than they did by at least one year. Had they gone to Rhode  Island and received the gospel there, they would have undoubtedly gone  direct to Kirtland, Ohio. As it was, they stopped in New York where  they purchased a farm.    {31} This incident furnished an illustration of the safety of obeying  the spirit of the Lord, even when the reason at the time is not  apparent. The example of Adam is a further illustration of that same  beautiful truth. \"Adam, why dost thou offer sacrifice?\" asked the  angel. \"I know not,\" was the reply, \"save that God has commanded me.\"  Such illustrations show the folly of basing one's conduct wholly upon  experience, or upon the powers of human understanding. There are other  lamps to guide our feet than that of experience or the wisdom of man.  The incident is a striking illustration also of the untruth of that  sometime infidel dogma which says: \"We doubt all things in order to  prove all things.\" It is better to hold with inspired men: \"We believe  all things from God in order to know all things.\"    Wilford Woodruff and his brother Azmon bade their father good-bye. With  $800, and a tin trunk each, they journeyed to Richland, Oswego County,  New York. There they purchased a farm of 140 acres and a good dwelling  house at a cost of $1,800. They paid the amount they had with them, the  balance at a subsequent date.    During their residence in Richland, the cholera made its appearance  in the United States. Azmon was seized by the dread malady. Of this  circumstance and the faith of his brother, Wilford writes: \"Azmon was a  very peculiar person from his childhood. He was very strict in reading  the Bible and in attending to his prayers. He enjoyed much of the  spirit of the Lord and had considerable light. I was greatly edified by  his teachings and conversations. When he was sick, he did not employ a  physician, but trusted in the Lord absolutely. In the fall of 1833 he  had a very severe attack of the cholera. His wife and I laid our hands  upon his head agreeable to his request and prayed for him. We asked the  Lord to rebuke the disease and commanded it to depart from him. From  that hour the cholera was checked. He was immediately healed. The next  morning he was able to arise from his bed and walk. Such was his faith.  He had passed through many ordeals of sickness and was always healed by  the power of God and without medical aid.\"    This recital brings us to the winter of 1833 when the full blaze of the  gospel light was about to shine in splendor upon the soul of Wilford  Woodruff.    {32}        CHAPTER 5.    BAPTISM, 1833.    Elders Visit Richland, N. Y.--The New Message.--Wilford Woodruff's  Testimony.--The Book of Mormon.--Healing Power.--Baptism.--Ordained a  Teacher.    The movement westward when Wilford Woodruff located in Richland, New  York was in full accord with the restless energy and ambitious purposes  of a new and active generation. The movement called for the best talent  and most ardent workers of those times. In Richland this young man  gave his old time zeal to a new found occupation. What lay at hand to  do he did with all his might. The duties and occupations of his life  were with him never temporary, never makeshifts, and he never waited  for something to turn up. Nor did the frequent interruptions in his  occupations all through life ever give to him an unsteady aim, or a  waning enthusiasm. When he plowed in the earth, he saw God's will in  the furrows. There was divine harmony in the click of the mill, and  the song of heaven in the warblings of the birds. He \"settled down\" in  Richland with the fervent expectation that, God willing, it should be  to him a permanent home.    In the midst of the busy life he had taken up in his new home, there  came to him a message of joy, a warning voice, to whose accents his  soul had long been attuned. In the winter of 1833, and on the 29th day  of December, there came to his home two humble elders of the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They were Zera Pulsipher and Elijah  Cheney. At the time of their appearance, he and his brother Azmon  were away from the house engaged in their daily labors; but Azmon's  wife knew very well the frame of mind, both of her husband and his  brother Wilford. Their hopes and expectations had been the subject of  conversation in their humble home. She therefore received the elders  kindly and gave them to understand that her husband and his brother  would be anxious to hear them preach.    According to the custom of the Mormon elders then, as now, a meeting  was appointed at the schoolhouse and notices were circulated throughout  the village. The story of this new experience is told by Wilford  Woodruff in a simple and beautiful manner: {33} \"Upon my arrival home  my sister-in-law informed me of the meeting. I immediately turned out  my horses and started for the schoolhouse without waiting for supper.  On my way I prayed most sincerely that the Lord would give me His  spirit, and that if these men were the servants of God I might know it,  and that my heart might be prepared to receive the divine message they  had to deliver.    \"When I reached the place of meeting, I found the house already packed.  My brother Azmon was there before I arrived. He was equally eager to  hear what these men had to say. I crowded my way through the assembly  and seated myself upon one of the writing desks where I could see and  hear everything that took place.    \"Elder Pulsipher opened with prayer. He knelt down and asked the Lord  in the name of Jesus Christ for what he wanted. His manner of prayer  and the influence which went with it impressed me greatly. The spirit  of the Lord rested upon me and bore witness that he was a servant  of God. After singing, he preached to the people for an hour and a  half. The spirit of God rested mightily upon him and he bore a strong  testimony of the divine authenticity of the Book of Mormon and of the  mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith. I believed all that he said. The  spirit bore witness of its truth. Elder Cheney then arose and added his  testimony to the truth of the words of Elder Pulsipher.    \"Liberty was then given by the elders to any one in the congregation  to arise and speak for or against what they had heard as they might  choose. Almost instantly I found myself upon my feet. The spirit of the  Lord urged me to bear testimony to the truth of the message delivered  by these elders. I exhorted my neighbors and friends not to oppose  these men; for they were the true servants of God. They had preached  to us that night the pure gospel of Jesus Christ. When I sat down, my  brother Azmon arose and bore a similar testimony. He was followed by  several others.\"    No more beautiful illustration of the manner in which this new message  found its way into the homes of thousands of people could be given than  that taken from the quotations herein given. The power of an elder's  testimony has borne down upon {34} the souls of men and women until  like the Saints of old they have exclaimed: \"Men and brethren, what  shall we do.\" The spirit of this meeting was not only convincing, but  controlling in its power. No man arose to say nay. If there were present  in that meeting a spirit of dissent, opposition, or hatred, it was  quelled and silenced by the power of God manifested in the testimonies  of those humble men.    The Woodruff brothers were aroused to a spirit of investigation. They  were full of hope and of grand expectations. They wanted to harmonize  the new message with the word of God as pronounced in Holy Writ. They  had rested heretofore their faith upon its teachings. In all matters  religious, it had been their supreme guide. They were anxious to know  more, and therefore took the elders with them to their home and sat up  late that night conversing upon the principles of the gospel.    Wilford began at once to read the Book of Mormon. \"As I did so,\" he  writes, \"the spirit bore witness that the record which it contained  was true. I opened my eyes to see, my ears to hear, and my heart to  understand. I also opened my doors to entertain the servants of God.\"  He at once became a living witness to the truth of the promise made  in that book that whoso should read it with a prayerful heart should  have a witness of its truth, and whoso should receive the record and  not condemn it because of the imperfections which might appear in its  language should know greater things to come. The spirit of that book  brought divine harmony to his soul so wonderfully attuned to the spirit  and language of the Bible.    Those were days of grand opportunities for a soul that had been so long  in a state of hunger and thirst after righteousness. The new message  brought to him a new enthusiasm. On the 30th of the month, Wilford and  the elders called upon Noah Holton, a preacher of the Freewill Baptist  denomination, whose daughter was very ill. After listening to the  elders for some time, Mr. Holton made a solemn covenant to go"]]]
