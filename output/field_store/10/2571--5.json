The supposed Part of the People during Revolution.      The laws of the psychology of crowds show us that the people  never acts without leaders, and that although it plays a  considerable part in revolutions by following and exaggerating  the impulses received, it never directs its own movements.    In all political revolutions we discover the action of leaders.  They do not create the ideas which serve as the basis of  revolutions, but they utilise them as a means of action.  Ideas,  leaders, armies, and crowds constitute four elements which all  have their part to play in revolutions.    The crowd, roused by the leaders, acts especially by means of its  mass.  Its action is comparable to that of the shell which  perforates an armour-plate by the momentum of a force it did not  create.  Rarely does the crowd understand anything of the  revolutions accomplished with its assistance.  It obediently  follows its leaders without even trying to find out what they  want.  It overthrew Charles X. because of his Ordinances without  having any idea of the contents of the latter, and would have  been greatly embarrassed had it been asked at a later date why it  overthrew Louis-Philippe.    Deceived by appearances, many authors, from Michelet to Aulard,  have supposed that the people effected our great Revolution.    ``The principal actor,'' said Michelet, ``is the people.''    ``It is an error to say,'' writes M. Aulard, ``that the French  Revolution was effected by a few distinguished people or a few  heroes. . . .  I believe that in the whole history of the period  included between 1789 and 1799 not a single person stands out who  led or shaped events: neither Louis XVI. nor Mirabeau nor Danton  nor Robespierre.  Must we say that it was the French people that  was the real hero of the French Revolution?  Yes--provided we see  the French people not as a multitude but as a number of organised  groups.''    And in a recent work M. A. Cochin insists on this conception of  popular action.    ``And here is the wonder:  Michelet is right.  In proportion as  we know them better the facts seem to consecrate the fiction:  this crowd, without chiefs and without laws, the very image of  chaos, did for five years govern and command, speak and act, with  a precision, a consistency, and an entirety that were  marvellous.  Anarchy gave lessons in order and discipline to the  defeated party of order . . . twenty-five millions of men, spread  over an area of 30,000 square leagues, acted as one.''    Certainly if this simultaneous conduct of the people had been  spontaneous, as the author supposes, it would have been  marvellous.  M. Aulard himself understands very well the  impossibilities of such a phenomenon, for he is careful, in  speaking of the people, to say that he is speaking of groups, and  that these groups may have been guided by leaders:--    ``And what, then, cemented the national unity?  Who saved this  nation, attacked by the king and rent by civil war?  Was it  Danton?  Was it Robespierre?  Was it Carnot?  Certainly these  individual men were of service: but unity was in fact maintained  and independence assured by the grouping of the French into  communes and popular societies--people's clubs.  It was the  municipal and Jacobin organisation of France that forced the  coalition of Europe to retreat.  But in each group, if we look  more closely, there were two or three individuals more capable  than the rest, who, whether leaders or led, executed decisions  and had the appearance of leaders, but who (if, for instance, we  read the proceedings of the people's clubs) seem to us to have  drawn their strength far more from their group than from  themselves.    M. Aulard's mistake consists in supposing that all these groups  were derived ``from a spontaneous movement of fraternity and  reason.''  France at that time was covered with thousands of  little clubs, receiving a single impulsion from the great  Jacobin Club of Paris, and obeying it with perfect docility.  This is what reality teaches us, though the illusions of the  Jacobins do not permit them to accept the fact.[3]        [3] In the historical manuals which M. Aulard has prepared for  the use of classes in collaboration with M. Debidour the  role attributed to the people as an entity is even more  marked.  We see it intervening continually and spontaneously;  here are a few examples:--    The ``Day'' of June the 20th:  ``The king dismissed the  Girondist members.  The people of Paris, indignant, rose  spontaneously and invaded the Tuileries.''    The ``Day'' of August 10th:  ``The Legislative Assembly dared  not overthrow it; it was the people of Paris, aided by the  Federals of the Departments, who effected this revolution at the  price of its blood.''    The conflict of the Girondists and the Mountain:  ``This  discord in the face of the enemy was dangerous.  The people put  an end to it on the days of the 31st of May and the 2nd of June,  1793, when it forced the Convention to expel the leaders of the  Gironde from its midst and to decree their arrest.''        4.  The Popular Entity and its Constituent Elements.      In order to answer to certain theoretical conceptions the people  was erected into a mystic entity, endowed with all the powers and  all the virtues, incessantly praised by the politicians, and  overwhelmed with flattery.  We shall see what we are to make of  this conception of the part played by the people in the French  Revolution.    To the Jacobins of this epoch, as to those of our own days, this  popular entity constitutes a superior personality possessing the  attributes, peculiar to divinities, of never having to answer for  its actions and never making a mistake.  Its wishes must be  humbly acceded.  The people may kill, burn, ravage, commit the  most frightful cruelties, glorify its hero to-day and throw him  into the gutter to-morrow; it is all one; the politicians will  not cease to vaunt its virtues, its high wisdom, and to bow to  its every decision.[4]        [4] These pretensions do at least seem to be growing untenable to  the more advanced republicans.    ``The rage with the socialists'' writes M. Clemenceau, ``is to  endow with all the virtues, as though by a superhuman reason, the  crowd whose reason cannot be much to boast of.''  The famous  statesman might say more correctly that reason not only cannot be  prominent in the crowd but is practically nonexistent.          Now in what does this entity really consist, this mysterious  fetich which revolutionists have revered for more than a century?    It may be decomposed into two distinct categories.  The first  includes the peasants, traders, and workers of all sorts who need  tranquillity and order that they may exercise their calling.  This people forms the majority, but a majority which never caused  a revolution.  Living in laborious silence, it is ignored by the  historians.    The second category, which plays a capital part in all national  disturbances, consists of a subversive social residue dominated  by a criminal mentality.  Degenerates of alcoholism and poverty,  thieves, beggars, destitute ``casuals,'' indifferent workers  without employment--these constitute the dangerous bulk of the  armies of insurrection.    The fear of punishment prevents many of them from becoming  criminals at ordinary times, but they do become criminals as soon  as they can exercise their evil instincts without danger.    To this sinister substratum are due the massacres which stain all  revolutions.    It was this class which, guided by its leaders, continually  invaded the great revolutionary Assemblies.  These regiments of  disorder had no other ideal than that of massacre, pillage, and  incendiarism.  Their indifference to theories and principles was  complete.    To the elements recruited from the lowest dregs of the populace  are added, by way of contagion, a host of idle and indifferent  persons who are simply drawn into the movement.  They shout  because there are men shouting, and revolt because there is a  revolt, without having the vaguest idea of the cause of shouting  or revolution.  The suggestive power of their environment  absolutely hypnotises them, and impels them to action.    These noisy and maleficent crowds, the kernel of all  insurrections, from antiquity to our own times, are the only  crowds known to the orator.  To the orator they are the sovereign  people.  As a matter of fact this sovereign people is principally  composed of the lower populace of whom Thiers said:--    ``Since the time when Tacitus saw it applaud the crimes of the  emperors the vile populace has not changed.  These barbarians who  swarm at the bottom of societies are always ready to stain the  people with every crime, at the beck of every power, and to the  dishonour of every cause.''    At no period of history was the role of the lowest elements  of the population exercised in such a lasting fashion as in the  French Revolution.    The massacres began as soon as the beast was unchained--that is,  from 1789, long before the Convention.  They were carried  out with all possible refinements of cruelty.  During the killing  of September the prisoners were slowly chopped to bits by sabre-  cuts in order to prolong their agonies and amuse the spectators,  who experienced the greatest delight before the spectacle of the  convulsions of the victims and their shrieks of agony.    Similar scenes were observed all over France, even in the early  days of the Revolution, although the foreign war did not excuse  them then, nor any other pretext.    From March to September a whole series of burnings, killings, and  pillagings drenched all France in blood.  Taine cites one hundred  and twenty such cases.

Two of our number now commenced work as tailors in the village  of Independence, while the others crossed the frontier line and  commenced a mission among the Lamanites, or Indians.    Passing through the tribe of Shawnees we tarried one night with  them, and the next day crossed the Kansas river and entered among  the Delawares. We immediately inquired for the residence of the  principal Chief, and were soon introduced to an aged and venerable  looking man, who had long stood at the head of the Delawares, and  been looked up to as the Great Grandfather, or Sachem of ten  nations or tribes.    He was seated on a sofa of furs, skins and blankets, before a  fire in the centre of his lodge; which was a comfortable cabin,  consisting of two large rooms.    His wives were neatly dressed, partly in calicoes and partly in  skins; and wore a vast amount of silver ornaments. As we entered  his cabin he took us by the hand with a hearty welcome, and then  motioned us to be seated on a pleasant seat of blankets, or robes.  His wives, at his bidding, set before us a tin pan full of beans  and corn boiled tip together, which proved to be good eating;  although three of us made use alternately of the same wooden spoon.    There was an interpreter present and through him we commenced to  make known our errand, and to tell him of the Book of Mormon. We  asked him to call the council his nation together and give us a  hearing in full. He promised to consider on it till next day, in  the meantime recommending us to a certain Mr. Pool for entertainment;  this was their blacksmith, employed by government.    The man entertained us kindly and comfortably. Next morning we  again called on Mr. Anderson, the old chief, and explained to him  something of the Book. He was at first unwilling to call his  council; made several excuses, and finally refused; as he had ever  been opposed to the introduction of missionaries among his tribe.    We continued the conversation a little longer, till he at last  began to understand the nature of the Book. He then changed his  mind; became suddenly interested, and requested us to proceed no  further with our conversation till he could call a council. He  despatched a messenger, and in about an hour had some forty men  collected around us in his lodge, who, after shaking us by the  hand, were seated in silence; and in a grave and dignified manner  awaited the announcement of what we had to offer. The chief then  requested us to proceed; or rather, begin where we began before,  and to complete our communication. Elder Cowdery then commenced as  follows:    \"Aged Chief and Venerable Council of the Delaware nation; we are  glad of this opportunity to address you as our red brethren and  friends. We have travelled a long distance from towards the rising  sun to bring you glad news; we have travelled the wilderness,  crossed the deep and wide rivers, and waded in the deep snows, and  in the face of the storms of winter, to communicate to you great  knowledge which has lately come to our ears and hearts; and which  will do the red man good as well as the pale face.    \"Once the red men were many; they occupied the country from sea  to sea--from the rising to the setting sun; the whole land was  theirs; the Great Spirit gave it to them, and no pale faces dwelt  among them. But now they are few in numbers; their possessions are  small, and the pale faces are many.    \"Thousands of moons ago, when the red men's forefathers dwelt in  peace and possessed this whole land, the Great Spirit talked with  them, and revealed His law and His will, and much knowledge to  their wise men and prophets. This they wrote in a Book; together  with their history, and the things which should befall their  children in the latter days.    \"This Book was written on plates of gold, and handed down from  father to son for many ages and generations. It was then that the  people prospered, and were strong and mighty; they cultivated the  earth; built buildings and cities, and abounded in all good things,  as the pale faces now do.    \"But they became wicked; they killed one another and shed much  blood; they killed their prophets and wise men, and sought to  destroy the Book. The Great Spirit became angry, and would speak to  them no more; they had no more good and wise dreams; no more  visions; no more angels sent among them by the Great Spirit; and  the Lord commanded Mormon and Moroni, their last wise men and  prophets, to hide the Book in the earth, that it might be preserved  in safety, and be found and made known in the latter day to the  pale faces who should possess the land; that they might again make  it known to the red man; in order to restore them to the knowledge  of the will of the Great Spirit and to His favor. And if the red  man would then receive this Book and learn the things written in  it, and do according thereunto, they should cease to fight and kill  one another; should become one people; cultivate the earth in  peace, in common with the pale faces, who were willing to believe  and obey the same Book, and be good men and live in peace.    \"Then should the red men become great, and have plenty to eat  and good clothes to wear, and should be in favor with the Great  Spirit and be his children, while he would be their Great Father,  and talk with them, and raise up prophets and wise and good men  amongst them again, who should teach them many things.    \"This Book, which contained these things, was hid in the earth  by Moroni, in a hill called by him, Cumorah, which hill is now in  the State of New York, near the village of Palmyra, in Ontario  County.    \"In that neighborhood there lived a young man named Joseph  Smith, who prayed to the Great Spirit much, in order that he might  know the truth; and the Great Spirit sent an angel to him, and told  him where this Book was hid by Moroni; and commanded him to go and  get it. He accordingly went to the place, and dug in the earth, and  found the Book written on golden plates.    \"But it was written in the language of the forefathers of the  red man; therefore this young man, being a pale face, could not  understand it; but the angel told him and showed him, and gave him  knowledge of the language, and how to interpret the Book. So he  interpreted it into the language of the pale faces, and wrote it on  paper, and caused it to be printed, and published thousands of  copies of among them; and then sent us to the red men to bring some  copies of it to them, and to tell them this news. So we have now  come from him, and here is a copy of the Book, which we now present  to our red friend, the chief of the Delawares, and which we hope he  will cause to be read and known among his tribe; it will do them  good.\"    We then presented him with a Book of Mormon.    There was a pause in the council, and some conversation in their  own tongue, after which the chief made the following reply: \"We  feel truly thankful to our white friends who have come so far, and  been at such pains to tell us good news, and especially this new  news concerning the Book of our forefathers; it makes us glad in  here\"--placing his hand on his heart.    \"It is now winter, we are new settlers in this place; the snow  is deep, our cattle and horses are dying, our wigwams are poor; we  have much to do in the spring--to build houses, and fence and make  farms; but we will build a council house, and meet together, and  you shall read to us and teach us more concerning the Book of our  fathers and the will of the Great Spirit.\"    We again lodged at Mr. Pool's, told him of the Book, had a very  pleasant interview with him, and he became a believer and advocate  for the Book, and served as an interpreter.    We continued for several days to instruct the old chief and many  of his tribe. The interest became more and more intense on their  part, from day to day, until at length nearly the whole tribe began  to feel a spirit of inquiry and excitement on the subject.    We found several among them who could read, and to them we gave  copies of the Book, explaining to them that it was the Book of  their forefathers.    Some began to rejoice exceedingly, and took great pains to tell  the news to others, in their own language.    The excitement now reached the frontier settlements in Missouri,  and stirred up the jealousy and envy of the Indian agents and  sectarian missionaries to that degree that we were soon ordered out  of the Indian country as disturbers of the peace; and even  threatened with the military in case of non-compliance.    We accordingly departed from the Indian country, and came over  the line, and commenced laboring in Jackson County, Missouri, among  the whites. We were well received, and listened to by many; and  some were baptized and added to the Church.    Thus ended our first Indian Mission, in which we had preached  the gospel in its fullness, and distributed the record of their  forefathers among three tribes, viz: the Catteraugus Indians, near  Buffalo, N. Y., the Wyandots of Ohio, and the Delawares west of  Missouri.    We trust that at some future day, when the servants of God go  forth in power to the remnant of Joseph, some precious seed will be  found growing in their hearts, which was sown by us in that early  day.    It was now the 14th of February, 1831. The cold north wind which  had blown for several weeks, accompanied with very severe weather,  had begun to give place to a milder breeze from the south; and the  deep snows were fast settling down, with every prospect of  returning spring.
