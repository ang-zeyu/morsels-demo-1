He distorts the  human figure with perfect justification. Not only must the whole  figure follow the lines of the triangle, but each limb must grow  narrower from bottom to top. Raphael's \"Holy Family\" is an  example of triangular composition used only for the harmonizing  of the group, and without any mystical motive.]    So the abstract idea is creeping into art, although, only  yesterday, it was scorned and obscured by purely material ideals.  Its gradual advance is natural enough, for in proportion as the  organic form falls into the background, the abstract ideal  achieves greater prominence.    But the organic form possesses all the same an inner harmony of  its own, which may be either the same as that of its abstract  parallel (thus producing a simple combination of the two  elements) or totally different (in which case the combination may  be unavoidably discordant). However diminished in importance the  organic form may be, its inner note will always be heard; and for  this reason the choice of material objects is an important one.  The spiritual accord of the organic with the abstract element may  strengthen the appeal of the latter (as much by contrast as by  similarity) or may destroy it.    Suppose a rhomboidal composition, made up of a number of human  figures. The artist asks himself: Are these human figures an  absolute necessity to the composition, or should they be replaced  by other forms, and that without affecting the fundamental  harmony of the whole? If the answer is \"Yes,\" we have a case in  which the material appeal directly weakens the abstract appeal.  The human form must either be replaced by another object which,  whether by similarity or contrast, will strengthen the abstract  appeal, or must remain a purely non-material symbol. [Footnote:  Cf. Translator's Introduction, pp. xviii and xx.--M.T.H.S.]    Once more the metaphor of the piano. For \"colour\" or \"form\"  substitute \"object.\" Every object has its own life and therefore  its own appeal; man is continually subject to these appeals. But  the results are often dubbed either sub--or super-conscious.  Nature, that is to say the ever-changing surroundings of man,  sets in vibration the strings of the piano (the soul) by  manipulation of the keys (the various objects with their several  appeals).    The impressions we receive, which often appear merely chaotic,  consist of three elements: the impression of the colour of the  object, of its form, and of its combined colour and form, i.e. of  the object itself.    At this point the individuality of the artist comes to the front  and disposes, as he wills, these three elements. IT IS CLEAR,  THEREFORE, THAT THE CHOICE OF OBJECT (i.e. OF ONE OF THE ELEMENTS  IN THE HARMONY OF FORM) MUST BE DECIDED ONLY BY A CORRESPONDING  VIBRATION IN THE HUMAN SOUL; AND THIS IS A THIRD GUIDING  PRINCIPLE OF THE INNER NEED.    The more abstract is form, the more clear and direct is its  appeal. In any composition the material side may be more or less  omitted in proportion as the forms used are more or less  material, and for them substituted pure abstractions, or largely  dematerialized objects. The more an artist uses these abstracted  forms, the deeper and more confidently will he advance into the  kingdom of the abstract. And after him will follow the gazer at  his pictures, who also will have gradually acquired a greater  familiarity with the language of that kingdom.    Must we then abandon utterly all material objects and paint  solely in abstractions? The problem of harmonizing the appeal of  the material and the non-material shows us the answer to this  question. As every word spoken rouses an inner vibration, so  likewise does every object represented. To deprive oneself of  this possibility is to limit one's powers of expression. That is  at any rate the case at present. But besides this answer to the  question, there is another, and one which art can always employ  to any question beginning with \"must\": There is no \"must\" in art,  because art is free.    With regard to the second problem of composition, the creation of  the single elements which are to compose the whole, it must be  remembered that the same form in the same circumstances will  always have the same inner appeal. Only the circumstances are  constantly varying. It results that: (1) The ideal harmony alters  according to the relation to other forms of the form which causes  it. (2) Even in similar relationship a slight approach to or  withdrawal from other forms may affect the harmony. [Footnote:  This is what is meant by \"an appeal of motion.\" For example, the  appeal of an upright triangle is more steadfast and quiet than  that of one set obliquely on its side.] Nothing is absolute.  Form-composition rests on a relative basis, depending on (1) the  alterations in the mutual relations of forms one to another, (2)  alterations in each individual form, down to the very smallest.  Every form is as sensitive as a puff of smoke, the slightest  breath will alter it completely. This extreme mobility makes it  easier to obtain similar harmonies from the use of different  forms, than from a repetition of the same one; though of course  an exact replica of a spiritual harmony can never be produced. So  long as we are susceptible only to the appeal of a whole  composition, this fact is of mainly theoretical importance. But  when we become more sensitive by a constant use of abstract forms  (which have no material interpretation) it will become of great  practical significance. And so as art becomes more difficult, its  wealth of expression in form becomes greater and greater. At the  same time the question of distortion in drawing falls out and is  replaced by the question how far the inner appeal of the  particular form is veiled or given full expression. And once more  the possibilities are extended, for combinations of veiled and  fully expressed appeals suggest new LEITMOTIVEN in composition.    Without such development as this, form-composition is impossible.  To anyone who cannot experience the inner appeal of form (whether  material or abstract) such composition can never be other than  meaningless. Apparently aimless alterations in form-arrangement  will make art seem merely a game. So once more we are faced with  the same principle, which is to set art free, the principle of  the inner need.    When features or limbs for artistic reasons are changed or  distorted, men reject the artistic problem and fall back on the  secondary question of anatomy. But, on our argument, this  secondary consideration does not appear, only the real, artistic  question remaining. These apparently irresponsible, but really  well-reasoned alterations in form provide one of the storehouses  of artistic possibilities.    The adaptability of forms, their organic but inward variations,  their motion in the picture, their inclination to material or  abstract, their mutual relations, either individually or as parts  of a whole; further, the concord or discord of the various  elements of a picture, the handling of groups, the combinations  of veiled and openly expressed appeals, the use of rhythmical or  unrhythmical, of geometrical or non-geometrical forms, their  contiguity or separation--all these things are the material for  counterpoint in painting.    But so long as colour is excluded, such counterpoint is confined  to black and white. Colour provides a whole wealth of  possibilities of her own, and when combined with form, yet a  further series of possibilities. And all these will be  expressions of the inner need.    The inner need is built up of three mystical elements: (1) Every  artist, as a creator, has something in him which calls for  expression (this is the element of personality). (2) Every  artist, as child of his age, is impelled to express the spirit of  his age (this is the element of style)--dictated by the period  and particular country to which the artist belongs (it is  doubtful how long the latter distinction will continue to exist).  (3) Every artist, as a servant of art, has to help the cause of  art (this is the element of pure artistry, which is constant in  all ages and among all nationalities).    A full understanding of the first two elements is necessary for a  realization of the third. But he who has this realization will  recognize that a rudely carved Indian column is an expression of  the same spirit as actuates any real work of art of today.    In the past and even today much talk is heard of \"personality\" in  art. Talk of the coming \"style\" becomes more frequent daily. But  for all their importance today, these questions will have  disappeared after a few hundred or thousand years.    Only the third element--that of pure artistry--will remain for  ever. An Egyptian carving speaks to us today more subtly than it  did to its chronological contemporaries; for they judged it with  the hampering knowledge of period and personality. But we can  judge purely as an expression of the eternal artistry.    Similarly--the greater the part played in a modern work of art by  the two elements of style and personality, the better will it be  appreciated by people today; but a modern work of art which is  full of the third element, will fail to reach the contemporary  soul. For many centuries have to pass away before the third  element can be received with understanding. But the artist in  whose work this third element predominates is the really great  artist.    Because the elements of style and personality make up what is  called the periodic characteristics of any work of art, the  \"development\" of artistic forms must depend on their separation  from the element of pure artistry, which knows neither period nor  nationality. But as style and personality create in every epoch  certain definite forms, which, for all their superficial"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/533"],[0,"The Song of the Cardinal (#10)"],[1," oak.  Then he stood  behind her and pointed out the sumac and the female bird.    \"Jest you keep still a minute, an' you'll feel paid for comin' all  right, honey,\" he whispered, \"but don't make any sudden movement.\"    \"I don't know as I ever saw a worse-lookin' specimen 'an she is,\"  answered Maria.    \"She looks first-class to him.  There's no kick comin' on his part, I  can tell you,\" replied Abram.    The bride hopped shyly through the sumac.  She pecked at the dried  berries, and frequently tried to improve her plumage, which certainly  had been badly draggled; and there was a drop of blood dried at the  base of her beak.  She plainly showed the effects of her rough  experience, and yet she was a most attractive bird; for the dimples in  her plump body showed through the feathers, and instead of the usual  wickedly black eyes of the cardinal family, hers were a soft tender  brown touched by a love-light there was no mistaking.  She was a  beautiful bird, and she was doing all in her power to make herself  dainty again.  Her movements clearly indicated how timid she was, and  yet she remained in the sumac as if she feared to leave it; and  frequently peered expectantly among the tree-tops.    There was a burst of exultation down the river.  The little bird gave  her plumage a fluff, and watched anxiously.  On came the Cardinal like  a flaming rocket, calling to her on wing.  He alighted beside her,  dropped into her beak a morsel of food, gave her a kiss to aid  digestion, caressingly ran his beak the length of her wing quills, and  flew to the dogwood.  Mrs. Cardinal enjoyed the meal.  It struck her  palate exactly right.  She liked the kiss and caress, cared, in fact,  for all that he did for her, and with the appreciation of his  tenderness came repentance for the dreadful chase she had led him in  her foolish fright, and an impulse to repay.  She took a dainty hop  toward the dogwood, and the invitation she sent him was exquisite.  With a shrill whistle of exultant triumph the Cardinal answered at a  headlong rush.    The farmer's grip tightened on his wife's shoulder, but Maria turned  toward him with blazing, tear-filled eyes.  \"An' you call yourself a  decent man, Abram Johnson?\"    \"Decent?\" quavered the astonished Abram.  \"Decent?  I believe I am.\"    \"I believe you ain't,\" hotly retorted his wife.  \"You don't know what  decency is, if you go peekin' at them.  They ain't birds!  They're  folks!\"    \"Maria,\" pled Abram, \"Maria, honey.\"    \"I am plumb ashamed of you,\" broke in Maria.  \"How d'you s'pose she'd  feel if she knew there was a man here peekin' at her?  Ain't she got a  right to be lovin' and tender? Ain't she got a right to pay him best  she knows?  They're jest common human bein's, an' I don't know where  you got privilege to spy on a female when she's doin' the best she  knows.\"    Maria broke from his grasp and started down the line fence.    In a few strides Abram had her in his arms, his withered cheek with its  springtime bloom pressed against her equally withered, tear-stained one.    \"Maria,\" he whispered, waveringly, \"Maria, honey, I wasn't meanin' any  disrespect to the sex.\"    Maria wiped her eyes on the corner of her shawl.  \"I don't s'pose you  was, Abram,\" she admitted; \"but you're jest like all the rest o' the  men.  You never think!  Now you go on with your plowin' an' let that  little female alone.\"    She unclasped his arms and turned homeward.    \"Honey,\" called Abram softly, \"since you brought 'em that pocketful o'  wheat, you might as well let me have it.\"    \"Landy!\" exclaimed Maria, blushing; \"I plumb forgot my wheat!  I  thought maybe, bein' so early, pickin' was scarce, an' if you'd put out  a little wheat an' a few crumbs, they'd stay an' nest in the sumac, as  you're so fond o' them.\"    \"Jest what I'm fairly prayin' they'll do, an' I been carryin' stuff an'  pettin' him up best I knowed for a week,\" said Abram, as he knelt, and  cupped his shrunken hands, while Maria guided the wheat from her apron  into them.  \"I'll scatter it along the top rail, an' they'll be after  it in fifteen minutes.  Thank you, Maria.  'T was good o' you to think  of it.\"    Maria watched him steadily.  How dear he was! How dear he always had  been!  How happy they were together! \"Abram,\" she asked, hesitatingly,  \"is there anything else I could do for--your birds?\"    They were creatures of habitual repression, and the inner glimpses they  had taken of each other that day were surprises they scarcely knew how  to meet.  Abram said nothing, because he could not.  He slowly shook  his head, and turned to the plow, his eyes misty.  Maria started toward  the line fence, but she paused repeatedly to listen; and it was no  wonder, for all the redbirds from miles down the river had gathered  around the sumac to see if there were a battle in birdland; but it was  only the Cardinal, turning somersaults in the air, and screaming with  bursting exuberance: \"Come here! Come here!\"        Chapter 4    \"So dear! So dear!\" crooned the Cardinal      She had taken possession of the sumac.  The location was her selection  and he loudly applauded her choice.  She placed the first twig, and  after examining it carefully, he spent the day carrying her others just  as much alike as possible.  If she used a dried grass blade, he carried  grass blades until she began dropping them on the ground.  If she  worked in a bit of wild grape-vine bark, he peeled grape-vines until  she would have no more.  It never occurred to him that he was the  largest cardinal in the woods, in those days, and he had forgotten that  he wore a red coat.  She was not a skilled architect.  Her nest  certainly was a loose ramshackle affair; but she had built it, and had  allowed him to help her.  It was hers; and he improvised a paean in its  praise.  Every morning he perched on the edge of the nest and gazed in  songless wonder at each beautiful new egg; and whenever she came to  brood she sat as if entranced, eyeing her treasures in an ecstasy of  proud possession.    Then she nestled them against her warm breast, and turned adoring eyes  toward the Cardinal.  If he sang from the dogwood, she faced that way.  If he rocked on the wild grape-vine, she turned in her nest.  If he  went to the corn field for grubs, she stood astride her eggs and peered  down, watching his every movement with unconcealed anxiety.  The  Cardinal forgot to be vain of his beauty; she delighted in it every  hour of the day.  Shy and timid beyond belief she had been during her  courtship; but she made reparation by being an incomparably generous  and devoted mate.    And the Cardinal! He was astonished to find himself capable of so much  and such varied feeling.  It was not enough that he brooded while she  went to bathe and exercise.  The daintiest of every morsel he found was  carried to her.  When she refused to swallow another particle, he  perched on a twig close by the nest many times in a day; and with sleek  feathers and lowered crest, gazed at her in silent worshipful adoration.    Up and down the river bank he flamed and rioted.  In the sumac he  uttered not the faintest \"Chip!\" that might attract attention.  He was  so anxious to be inconspicuous that he appeared only half his real  size.  Always on leaving he gave her a tender little peck and ran his  beak the length of her wing--a characteristic caress that he delighted  to bestow on her.    If he felt that he was disturbing her too often, he perched on the  dogwood and sang for life, and love, and happiness.  His music was in a  minor key now.  The high, exultant, ringing notes of passion were  mellowed and subdued.  He was improvising cradle songs and lullabies.  He was telling her how he loved her, how he would fight for her, how he  was watching over her, how he would signal if any danger were  approaching, how proud he was of her, what a perfect nest she had  built, how beautiful he thought her eggs, what magnificent babies they  would produce.  Full of tenderness, melting with love, liquid with  sweetness, the Cardinal sang to his patient little brooding mate: \"So  dear! So dear!\"    The farmer leaned on his corn-planter and listened to him intently.  \"I  swanny!  If he hasn't changed his song again, an' this time I'm blest  if I can tell what he's saying!\"  Every time the Cardinal lifted his  voice, the clip of the corn-planter ceased, and Abram hung on the notes  and studied them over.    One night he said to his wife: \"Maria, have you been noticin' the  redbird of late?  He's changed to a new tune, an' this time I'm  completely stalled.  I can't for the life of me make out what he's  saying.  S'pose you step down to-morrow an' see if you can catch it for  me.  I'd give a pretty to know!\"    Maria felt flattered.  She always had believed that she had a musical  ear.  Here was an opportunity to test it and please Abram at the same  time.  She hastened her work the following morning, and very early  slipped along the line fence.  Hiding behind the oak, with straining  ear and throbbing heart, she eagerly listened.  \"Clip, clip,\" came the  sound of the planter, as Abram's dear old figure trudged up the hill.  \"Chip! Chip!\" came the warning of the Cardinal, as he flew to his mate.    He gave her some food, stroked her wing, and flying to the dogwood,  sang of the love that encompassed him.  As he trilled forth his tender  caressing strain, the heart of the listening woman translated as did  that of the brooding bird.    With shining eyes and flushed cheeks, she sped down the fence.  Panting  and palpitating with excitement, she met Abram half-way on his return  trip.  Forgetful of her habitual reserve, she threw her arms around his  neck, and drawing his face to hers, she cried: \"Oh, Abram!  I got it!  I got it!  I know what he's saying! Oh, Abram, my love!  My own!  To me  so dear!  So dear!\"    \"So dear!  So dear!\" echoed the Cardinal.    The bewilderment in Abram's face melted into"]]]
