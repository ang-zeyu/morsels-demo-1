The young priest Gioberti was not long in  incurring the hostility of the Jesuits, because, although he sought  the ultimate supremacy of the Papal See, he desired it as a moral  rather than as a physical supremacy, and he most ardently hoped for the  expulsion of the Austrians from Lombardy and the absolute independence  of Piedmont from Viennese influence. His was, however, too brilliant a  mind to be denied, and, despite the efforts of the Court party, Charles  Albert, who was always cognizant of the abilities of other men, soon  after his accession to the throne in 1831 nominated the young priest to  be one of the royal chaplains.    As chaplain of the court Gioberti quickly assumed prominence. His nature  was open and frank, he made friends easily, he wrote on ecclesiastical  and political subjects, and his patriotism was known to be unbounded.  He soon had gathered a party about him, and his influence over the  King grew rapidly. Charles Albert's own views on Italian policy were at  that time almost identical with Gioberti's, he would have been glad to  acknowledge a confederation of Italian states under the presidency of  the Pope, provided the foreign princelings could be disposed of without  bloodshed. This, however, the clerical party did not approve of, any  change being to their view revolutionary, and the realization that the  chaplain was gaining the private ear of the King finally compelled them  to mark him for exile.    Aware of this disaffection in the Church party at Turin, Gioberti in  1833 asked permission of Charles Albert to resign his chaplaincy, but,  before his request was granted he was suddenly arrested one day while  walking with a friend in the public gardens of the city, and placed  in prison. The influence of the clerical party was so all-powerful in  the Piedmont of that day that no attempt to secure Gioberti's release  was effective, and no popular demonstration at such an outrage could  take place. He was given no trial, and his case was the subject of  no apparent judicial process. After four months' imprisonment he was  informed that his banishment had been decreed, and he was at once  conducted to the frontier in charge of a carabineer. At the same time  his name was stricken off the roll of the theological doctors of the  College of Turin.    Driven into exile because of his political opinions, even as Mazzini  was exiled as a suspect rather than because of any proof against him,  Gioberti reached Paris in October, 1833. Like so many other great  Italians of that day he was destined to spend many years away from  his beloved country. Without friends, family, or money, his career  apparently ruined, his hopes shattered, Gioberti was to sound the depths  of a courageous man's despair. Mazzini took himself to London to eke  out a meager living as a teacher of Italian, and with the same thought  Gioberti went to Brussels. Here he undertook to teach philosophy, and  finally obtained employment in assisting his friend Gaggia in the  management of a small college. All his leisure time he devoted to  studying and writing on philosophy, rising early, and working the better  part of the night, and producing work after work of great value in  philosophic inquiry, all of which bore especially upon the needs of his  own countrymen.    His stay in Brussels, which lasted from 1834 to 1845, saw the production  of his greatest books, all deeply earnest, and each one causing in  turn the greatest interest and emotion in Italy. The volume of his  work was most remarkable, treatises appearing at short intervals,  each one of which would have sufficed to represent a lifetime's study.  His first work was the result of a friendship formed in Brussels with  a young fellow-exile, Paolo Pallia, who on one occasion expressed  to Gioberti certain doubts as to the reality of revelations and a  future life. Gioberti at once commenced work upon his \"La Teorica del  Sovran-naturale,\" which was finished and published in 1838. This was  followed in 1839 and 1840 by his three volumes called \"Introduzione  allo Studio della Filosofia.\" In all these writings he stands apart  from his contemporary European philosophers. Method of speculation  is with him subjective and psychological. He adopts much from Plato.  Throughout all his writings religion is synonomous with civilization,  and he repeatedly states that religion is the true and only expression  of the _idea_ in this life, and is one with the real civilization of  history. Civilization is the means to perfection, of which religion is  the essence.    These strictly philosophic works were followed by the essays \"Del Bello\"  and \"Del Buono,\" and after a short interval by a magnificent exposure  of the Jesuit Order, \"Il Gesuita Moderno,\" and his \"Del Primato Morale e  Civile degli Italiani,\" and \"Prolegomeni.\"    It was the \"Primato\" which gave the exiled Gioberti his place as a  great factor in the struggle for Italian independence. His ideas seem  strangely archaic now, but they were compelling in 1846. He himself  says: \"I intend to show ... that Italy alone has the qualities required  to become the chief of nations, and that although to-day she has almost  completely lost that chiefship, it is in her power to recover it, and  I will state the most important conditions of that renovation.... As  infant civilization was born between two rivers, so renewed and adult  civilization arose between two seas; the former in fertile Mesopotamia,  whence it easily spread over Asia, Africa and the west; the latter  in Italy, which divides the Tyrrhene and Adriatic seas, thus forming  the central promontory of Europe and placed in a position to dominate  the rest of the hemisphere.... In the Church there is neither Greek  nor Barbarian, and all nations form a cosmopolitan society, as all  the tribes of Israel a single nation. But as, in the Jewish nation,  genealogy determined the tenure of the hierarchy, and the sons of Levi  received the custody of the Law and the service of the Temple, so in  the Christian commonwealth the division of the nations is in a manner  involved in the order of the Catholic Church. And, the Church having a  supreme head, we must recognize a moral pre-eminence where Heaven has  established its seat, and where nearer, quicker, more immediate and  more uninterrupted are the in-breathings of its voice. This preeminence  certainly does not transgress the natural order of divine intentions,  real and efficient in their working and in the obligations they impose.  So that the Italians, humanly speaking, are the Levites of Christianity,  having been chosen by Providence to keep the Christian Pontificate, and  to protect with love, with veneration, and if necessary by arms, the  ark of the new covenant.... Let the nations, then, turn their eyes to  Italy, their ancient and loving mother, who holds the seeds of their  regeneration. Italy is the organ of the supreme reason and the royal and  ideal word; the fountain, rule and guardian of every other reason and  eloquence; for there resides the Head that rules, the Arm that moves,  the Tongue that commands and the Heart that animates Christianity at  large.... As Rome is the seat of Christian wisdom, Piedmont is to-day  the principal home of Italian military strength. Seated on the slopes of  the Alps, as a wedge between Austria and France, and as a guard to the  peninsula, of which it is the vestibule and peristyle, it is destined  to watch from its mountains, and crush in its ravines, every foreign  aggressor, compelling its powerful neighbors to respect the common  independence of Italy.\"    Such expression will suffice to show that Gioberti was in no sense a  reliable prophet, but a philosopher of deeply religious strain who was  seeking to reconcile the political freedom of Italy with the suzerainty  of the Pope. He discountenanced all plotting and conspiracy, both of  which were being advocated by Mazzini's appeals to \"Young Italy,\" and  built his country out of a confederation of states. Mazzini, impractical  as he was in many respects, did at least realize that no such loosely  joined federation could stand six months, and insisted above all in  actual political hegemony of the states.    Gioberti's \"Primato,\" deeply suggestive in itself to intellectual  Italy, was given a remarkable impetus by the election at about the  same time as its appearance of a new Pope. Pius IX., elected to the  papal chair in June, 1846, seemed the very man to bring about the  realization of Gioberti's hopes. As Cardinal Mastai Ferreti he had been  immensely popular, and he was known as a man of great amiability, keenly  interested in new ideas, and ardent in the cause of Italian unity of  action. His first act was to proclaim a general amnesty for political  offenses, by which thousands of prisoners who had spent years in Roman  prisons, or abroad in exile, many ignorant of the charges brought  against them, were allowed to return to family and friends. He visited  the poor and superintended the relief of the sick, even working among  the Jewish quarters of Rome. He favored the construction of railroads,  modified the restrictions of the press, and organized an advisory  council of leading citizens. Small wonder that a world which had been  used to the infinitely narrow-minded reactionaries Leo XII. and Gregory  XVI. hailed Pius IX. as the regenerator of both church and state.    To a large degree Pius and Gioberti had both felt the same enthusiasms,  and believed in the same principles, the cardinal one being that society  was to be reformed by the Roman Church, and the government of society  vested in the Church as a court of highest appeal. Different desires led  the two men to this conclusion, Gioberti hoping that reform would come  by means of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4361"],[0,"Memoirs of General William T. Sherman — Complete (#10)"],[1,"petticoat and spangles.  Adam was personated by her brother--the  same who has since become somewhat famous as the person on whom is  founded the McGarrahan claim.  God Almighty was personated, and  heaven's occupants seemed very human.  Yet the play was pretty,  interesting, and elicited universal applause.  All the month of  February we were by day preparing for our long stay in the country,  and at night making the most of the balls and parties of the most  primitive kind, picking up a smattering of Spanish, and extending  our acquaintance with the people and the costumbrea del pais.  I  can well recall that Ord and I, impatient to look inland, got  permission and started for the Mission of San Juan Bautista.  Mounted on horses, and with our carbines, we took the road by El  Toro, quite a prominent hill, around which passes the road to the  south, following the Saunas or Monterey River.  After about twenty  miles over a sandy country covered with oak-bushes and scrub, we  entered quite a pretty valley in which there was a ranch at the  foot of the Toro.  Resting there a while and getting some  information, we again started in the direction of a mountain to the  north of the Saunas, called the Gavillano.  It was quite dark when  we reached the Saunas River, which we attempted to pass at several  points, but found it full of water, and the quicksands were bad.  Hearing the bark of a dog, we changed our course in that direction,  and, on hailing, were answered by voices which directed us where to  cross.  Our knowledge of the language was limited, but we managed  to understand, and to founder through the sand and water, and  reached a small adobe-house on the banks of the Salinas, where we  spent the night: The house was a single room, without floor or  glass; only a rude door, and window with bars.  Not a particle of  food but meat, yet the man and woman entertained us with the  language of lords put themselves, their house, and every thing, at  our  \"disposition,\" and made little barefoot children dance for our  entertainment.  We made our supper of beef, and slept on a  bullock's hide on the dirt-floor.  In the morning we crossed the  Salinas Plain, about fifteen miles of level ground, taking a shot  occasionally at wild-geese, which abounded there, and entering the  well-wooded valley that comes out from the foot of the Gavillano.  We had cruised about all day, and it was almost dark when we  reached the house of a Senor Gomez, father of those who at Monterey  had performed the parts of Adam and Eve.  His house was a two-story  adobe, and had a fence in front.  It was situated well up among the  foot-hills of the Gavillano, and could not be seen until within a  few yards.  We hitched our horses to the fence and went in just as  Gomez was about to sit down to a tempting supper of stewed hare and  tortillas.  We were officers and caballeros and could not be  ignored.  After turning our horses to grass, at his invitation we  joined him at supper.  The allowance, though ample for one, was  rather short for three, and I thought the Spanish grandiloquent  politeness of Gomez, who was fat and old, was not over-cordial.  However, down we sat, and I was helped to a dish of rabbit, with  what I thought to be an abundant sauce of tomato.  Taking a good  mouthful, I felt as though I had taken liquid fire; the tomato was  chile colorado, or red pepper, of the purest kind.  It nearly  killed me, and I saw Gomez's eyes twinkle, for he saw that his  share of supper was increased.--I contented myself with bits of  the meat, and an abundant supply of tortillas.  Ord was better  case-hardened, and stood it better.  We staid at Gomez's that  night, sleeping, as all did, on the ground, and the next morning we  crossed the hill by the bridle-path to the old Mission of San Juan  Bautista.  The Mission was in a beautiful valley, very level, and  bounded on all sides by hills.  The plain was covered with  wild-grasses and mustard, and had abundant water.  Cattle and  horses were seen in all directions, and it was manifest that the  priests who first occupied the country were good judges of land.  It was Sunday, and all the people, about, a hundred, had come to  church from the country round about.  Ord was somewhat of a  Catholic, and entered the church with his clanking spars and  kneeled down, attracting the attention of all, for he had on the  uniform of an American officer.  As soon as church was out, all  rushed to the various sports.  I saw the priest, with his gray  robes tucked up, playing at billiards, others were cock fighting,  and some at horse-racing.  My horse had become lame, and I resolved  to buy another.  As soon as it was known that I wanted a horse,  several came for me, and displayed their horses by dashing past and  hauling them up short.  There was a fine black stallion that  attracted my notice, and, after trying him myself, I concluded a  purchase.  I left with the seller my own lame horse, which he was  to bring to me at Monterey, when I was to pay him ten dollars for  the other.  The Mission of San Juan bore the marks of high  prosperity at a former period, and had a good pear-orchard just  under the plateau where stood the church.  After spending the day,  Ord and I returned to Monterey, about thirty-five miles, by a  shorter route, Thus passed the month of February, and, though there  were no mails or regular expresses, we heard occasionally from  Yerba Buena and Sutter's Fort to the north, and from the army and  navy about Los Angeles at the south.  We also knew that a quarrel  had grown up at Los Angeles, between General Kearney, Colonel  Fremont, and Commodore Stockton, as to the right to control affairs  in California.  Kearney had with him only the fragments of the two  companies of dragoons, which had come across from New Mexico with  him, and had been handled very roughly by Don Andreas Pico, at San  Pascual, in which engagement Captains Moore and Johnson, and  Lieutenant Hammond, were killed, and Kearney himself wounded.  There remained with him Colonel Swords, quartermaster; Captain H.  S. Turner, First Dragoons; Captains Emory and Warner, Topographical  Engineers; Assistant Surgeon Griffin, and Lieutenant J. W.  Davidson.  Fremont had marched down from the north with a battalion  of volunteers; Commodore Stockton had marched up from San Diego to  Los Angeles, with General Kearney, his dragoons, and a battalion of  sailors and marines, and was soon joined there by Fremont, and they  jointly received the surrender of the insurgents under Andreas  Pico.  We also knew that General R. B. Mason had been ordered to  California; that Colonel John D. Stevenson was coming out to  California with a regiment of New York Volunteers; that Commodore  Shubrick had orders also from the Navy Department to control  matters afloat; that General Kearney, by virtue of his rank, had  the right to control all the land-forces in the service of the  United States; and that Fremont claimed the same right by virtue of  a letter he had received from Colonel Benton, then a Senator, and a  man of great influence with Polk's Administration.  So that among  the younger officers the query was very natural, \"Who the devil is  Governor of California?\"  One day I was on board the Independence  frigate, dining with the ward-room officers, when a war-vessel was  reported in the offing, which in due time was made out to be the  Cyane, Captain DuPont.  After dinner we were all on deck to watch  the new arrival, the ships meanwhile exchanging signals, which were  interpreted that General Kearney was on board.  As the Cyane  approached, a boat was sent to meet her, with Commodore Shubrick's  flag-officer, Lieutenant Lewis, to carry the usual messages, and to  invite General Kearney to come on board the Independence as the  guest of Commodore Shubrick.  Quite a number of officers were on  deck, among them  Lieutenants Wise, Montgomery Lewis, William  Chapman, and others, noted wits and wags of the navy.  In due time  the Cyane anchored close by, and our boat was seen returning with a  stranger in the stern-sheets, clothed in army blue.  As the boat  came nearer, we saw that it was General Kearney with an old dragoon  coat on, and an army-cap, to which the general had added the broad  vizor, cut from a full-dress hat, to shade his face and eyes  against the glaring sun of the Gila region.  Chapman exclaimed:  \"Fellows, the problem is solved; there is the grand-vizier (visor)  by G-d!  He is Governor of California.\"    All hands received the general with great heartiness, and he soon  passed out of our sight into the commodore's cabin.  Between  Commodore Shubrick and General Kearney existed from that time  forward the greatest harmony and good feeling, and no further  trouble existed as to the controlling power on the Pacific coast.  General Kearney had dispatched from San Diego his quartermaster,  Colonel Swords, to the Sandwich Islands, to purchase clothing and  stores for his men, and had come up to Monterey, bringing with him  Turner and Warner, leaving Emory and the company of dragoons below.  He was delighted to find a full strong company of artillery,  subject to his orders, well supplied with clothing and money in all  respects, and, much to the disgust of our Captain Tompkins, he took  half of his company clothing and part of the money held by me for  the relief of his worn-out and almost naked dragoons left behind at  Los Angeles.  In a few days he moved on shore, took up his quarters  at Larkin's house, and established his headquarters, with Captain  Turner as his adjutant general.  One day Turner and Warner were at  my tent, and, seeing a store-bag full of socks, drawers, and calico  shirts, of which I had laid in a three years' supply, and of which  they had none, made known to me their wants, and I told them to  help themselves, which Turner and Warner did.  The latter, however,  insisted on paying me the cost, and"]]]
