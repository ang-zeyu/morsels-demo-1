When the Babe's sister revisited the ancestral home at  the end of the term, she brought Miss Beezley with her to spend a week.  What she saw in Miss Beezley was to the Babe a matter for wonder, but  she must have liked her, or she would not have gone out of her way to  seek her company. Be that as it may, the Babe would have gone a very  long way out of his way to avoid her company. He led a fine, healthy,  out-of-doors life during that week, and doubtless did himself a lot of  good. But times will occur when it is imperative that a man shall be  under the family roof. Meal-times, for instance. The Babe could not  subsist without food, and he was obliged, Miss Beezley or no Miss  Beezley, to present himself on these occasions. This, by the way, was  in the Easter holidays, so that there was no school to give him an  excuse for absence.    Breakfast was a nightmare, lunch was rather worse, and as for dinner,  it was quite unspeakable. Miss Beezley seemed to gather force during  the day. It was not the actual presence of the lady that revolted the  Babe, for that was passable enough. It was her conversation that  killed. She refused to let the Babe alone. She was intensely learned  herself, and seemed to take a morbid delight in dissecting his  ignorance, and showing everybody the pieces. Also, she persisted in  calling him Mr MacArthur in a way that seemed somehow to point out and  emphasize his youthfulness. She added it to her remarks as a sort of  after-thought or echo.    'Do you read Browning, Mr MacArthur?' she would say suddenly, having  apparently waited carefully until she saw that his mouth was full.    The Babe would swallow convulsively, choke, blush, and finally say--    'No, not much.'    'Ah!' This in a tone of pity not untinged with scorn.    'When you say \"not much\", Mr MacArthur, what exactly do you mean? Have  you read any of his poems?'    'Oh, yes, one or two.'    'Ah! Have you read \"Pippa Passes\"?'    'No, I think not.'    'Surely you must know, Mr MacArthur, whether you have or not. Have you  read \"Fifine at the Fair\"?'    'No.'    'Have you read \"Sordello\"?'    'No.'    'What _have_ you read, Mr MacArthur?'    Brought to bay in this fashion, he would have to admit that he had read  'The Pied Piper of Hamelin', and not a syllable more, and Miss Beezley  would look at him for a moment and sigh softly. The Babe's subsequent  share in the conversation, provided the Dragon made no further  onslaught, was not large.    One never-to-be-forgotten day, shortly before the end of her visit, a  series of horrible accidents resulted in their being left to lunch  together alone. The Babe had received no previous warning, and when he  was suddenly confronted with this terrible state of affairs he almost  swooned. The lady's steady and critical inspection of his style of  carving a chicken completed his downfall. His previous experience of  carving had been limited to those entertainments which went by the name  of 'study-gorges', where, if you wanted to help a chicken, you took  hold of one leg, invited an accomplice to attach himself to the other,  and pulled.    But, though unskilful, he was plucky and energetic. He lofted the bird  out of the dish on to the tablecloth twice in the first minute.  Stifling a mad inclination to call out 'Fore!' or something to that  effect, he laughed a hollow, mirthless laugh, and replaced the errant  fowl. When a third attack ended in the same way, Miss Beezley asked  permission to try what she could do. She tried, and in two minutes the  chicken was neatly dismembered. The Babe re-seated himself in an  over-wrought state.    'Tell me about St Austin's, Mr MacArthur,' said Miss Beezley, as the  Babe was trying to think of something to say--not about the weather.  'Do you play football?'    'Yes.'    'Ah!'    A prolonged silence.    'Do you--' began the Babe at last.    'Tell me--' began Miss Beezley, simultaneously.    'I beg your pardon,' said the Babe; 'you were saying--?'    'Not at all, Mr MacArthur. _You_ were saying--?'    'I was only going to ask you if you played croquet?'    'Yes; do you?'    'No.'    'Ah!'    'If this is going to continue,' thought the Babe, 'I shall be  reluctantly compelled to commit suicide.'    There was another long pause.    'Tell me the names of some of the masters at St Austin's, Mr  MacArthur,' said Miss Beezley. She habitually spoke as if she were an  examination paper, and her manner might have seemed to some to verge  upon the autocratic, but the Babe was too thankful that the question  was not on Browning or the higher algebra to notice this. He reeled off  a list of names.    '... Then there's Merevale--rather a decent sort--and Dacre.'    'What sort of a man is Mr Dacre?'    'Rather a rotter, I think.'    'What is a rotter, Mr MacArthur?'    'Well, I don't know how to describe it exactly. He doesn't play cricket  or anything. He's generally considered rather a crock.'    'Really! This is very interesting, Mr MacArthur. And what is a crock? I  suppose what it comes to,' she added, as the Babe did his best to find  a definition, 'is this, that you yourself dislike him.' The Babe  admitted the impeachment. Mr Dacre had a finished gift of sarcasm which  had made him writhe on several occasions, and sarcastic masters are  rarely very popular.    'Ah!' said Miss Beezley. She made frequent use of that monosyllable. It  generally gave the Babe the same sort of feeling as he had been  accustomed to experience in the happy days of his childhood when he had  been caught stealing jam.    Miss Beezley went at last, and the Babe felt like a convict who has  just received a free pardon.    One afternoon in the following term he was playing fives with  Charteris, a prefect in Merevale's House. Charteris was remarkable from  the fact that he edited and published at his own expense an unofficial  and highly personal paper, called _The Glow Worm_, which was a  great deal more in demand than the recognized School magazine, _The  Austinian_, and always paid its expenses handsomely.    Charteris had the journalistic taint very badly. He was always the  first to get wind of any piece of School news. On this occasion he was  in possession of an exclusive item. The Babe was the first person to  whom he communicated it.    'Have you heard the latest romance in high life, Babe?' he observed, as  they were leaving the court. 'But of course you haven't. You never do  hear anything.'    'Well?' asked the Babe, patiently.    'You know Dacre?'    'I seem to have heard the name somewhere.'    'He's going to be married.'    'Yes. Don't trouble to try and look interested. You're one of those  offensive people who mind their own business and nobody else's. Only I  thought I'd tell you. Then you'll have a remote chance of understanding  my quips on the subject in next week's _Glow Worm_. You laddies  frae the north have to be carefully prepared for the subtler flights of  wit.'    'Thanks,' said the Babe, placidly. 'Good-night.'    The Headmaster intercepted the Babe a few days after he was going home  after a scratch game of football. 'MacArthur,' said he, 'you pass Mr  Dacre's House, do you not, on your way home? Then would you mind asking  him from me to take preparation tonight? I find I shall be unable to be  there.' It was the custom at St Austin's for the Head to preside at  preparation once a week; but he performed this duty, like the  celebrated Irishman, as often as he could avoid it.    The Babe accepted the commission. He was shown into the drawing-room.  To his consternation, for he was not a society man, there appeared to  be a species of tea-party going on. As the door opened, somebody was  just finishing a remark.    '... faculty which he displayed in such poems as \"Sordello\",' said the  voice.    The Babe knew that voice.    He would have fled if he had been able, but the servant was already  announcing him. Mr Dacre began to do the honours.    'Mr MacArthur and I have met before,' said Miss Beezley, for it was  she. 'Curiously enough, the subject which we have just been discussing  is one in which he takes, I think, a great interest. I was saying, Mr  MacArthur, when you came in, that few of Tennyson's works show the  poetic faculty which Browning displays in \"Sordello\".'    The Babe looked helplessly at Mr Dacre.    'I think you are taking MacArthur out of his depth there,' said Mr  Dacre. 'Was there something you wanted to see me about, MacArthur?'    The Babe delivered his message.    'Oh, yes, certainly,' said Mr Dacre. 'Shall you be passing the School  House tonight? If so, you might give the Headmaster my compliments, and  say I shall be delighted.'    The Babe had had no intention of going out of his way to that extent,  but the chance of escape offered by the suggestion was too good to be  missed. He went.    On his way he called at Merevale's, and asked to see Charteris.    'Look here, Charteris,' he said, 'you remember telling me that Dacre  was going to be married?'    'Yes.'    'Well, do you know her name by any chance?'    'I ken it weel, ma braw Hielander. She is a Miss Beezley.'    'Great Scott!' said the Babe.    'Hullo! Why, was your young heart set in that direction? You amaze and  pain me, Babe. I think we'd better have a story on the subject in  _The Glow Worm_, with you as hero and Dacre as villain. It shall  end happily, of course. I'll write it myself.'    'You'd better,' said the Babe, grimly. 'Oh, I say, Charteris.'    'Well?'    'When I come as a boarder, I shall be a House-prefect, shan't I, as I'm  in the Sixth?'    'Yes.'    'And prefects have to go to breakfast and supper, and that sort of  thing, pretty often with the House-beak, don't they?'    'Such are the facts of the case.'    'Thanks. That's all. Go away and do some work. Good-night.'    The cup went to Merevale's that year. The Babe played a singularly  brilliant game for them.          [8]    THE MANOEUVRES OF CHARTERIS"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6984"],[0,"The Pothunters (#10)"],[1," a line or two. It was the most beautiful spot in a country  noted for its fine scenery. Dense woods were its chief feature. And by  dense I mean well-supplied not only with trees (excellent things in  themselves, but for the most part useless to the nest hunter), but also  with a fascinating tangle of undergrowth, where every bush seemed to  harbour eggs. All carefully preserved, too. That was the chief charm of  the place. Since the sad episodes of Morton-Smith and Ainsworth, the  School for the most part had looked askance at the Dingle. Once a  select party from Dacre's House, headed by Babington, who always got  himself into hot water when possible, had ventured into the forbidden  land, and had returned hurriedly later in the afternoon with every sign  of exhaustion, hinting breathlessly at keepers, dogs, and a pursuit  that had lasted fifty minutes without a check. Since then no one had  been daring enough to brave the terrors so carefully prepared for them  by Milord Sir Venner and his minions, and the proud owner of the Dingle  walked his woods in solitary state. Occasionally he would personally  conduct some favoured guest thither and show him the wonders of the  place. But this was not a frequent occurrence. On still-less frequent  occasions, there were large shooting parties in the Dingle. But, as a  rule, the word was 'Keepers only. No others need apply'.    A futile iron railing, some three feet in height, shut in the Dingle.  Barrett jumped this lightly, and entered forthwith into Paradise. The  place was full of nests. As Barrett took a step forward there was a  sudden whirring of wings, and a bird rose from a bush close beside him.  He went to inspect, and found a nest with seven eggs in it. Only a  thrush, of course. As no one ever wants thrushes' eggs the world is  over-stocked with them. Still, it gave promise of good things to come.  Barrett pushed on through the bushes and the promise was fulfilled. He  came upon another nest. Five eggs this time, of a variety he was unable  with his moderate knowledge to classify. At any rate, he had not got  them in his collection. Nor, to the best of his belief, had Grey. He  took one for each of them.    Now this was all very well, thought Barrett, but what he had come for  was the ovular deposit of the water-wagtail. Through the trees he could  see the silver gleam of the brook at the foot of the hill. The woods  sloped down to the very edge. Then came the brook, widening out here  into the size of a small river. Then woods again all up the side of the  opposite hill. Barrett hurried down the slope.    He had put on flannels for this emergency. He was prepared to wade, to  swim if necessary. He hoped that it would not be necessary, for in  April water is generally inclined to be chilly. Of keepers he had up  till now seen no sign. Once he had heard the distant bark of a dog. It  seemed to come from far across the stream and he had not troubled about  it.    In the midst of the bushes on the bank stood a tree. It was not tall  compared to the other trees of the Dingle, but standing alone as it did  amongst the undergrowth it attracted the eye at once. Barrett, looking  at it, saw something which made him forget water-wagtails for the  moment. In a fork in one of the upper branches was a nest, an enormous  nest, roughly constructed of sticks. It was a very jerry-built  residence, evidently run up for the season by some prudent bird who  knew by experience that no nest could last through the winter, and so  had declined to waste his time in useless decorative work. But what  bird was it? No doubt there are experts to whom a wood-pigeon's nest is  something apart and distinct from the nest of the magpie, but to your  unsophisticated amateur a nest that is large may be anything--rook's,  magpie's, pigeon's, or great auk's. To such an one the only true test  lies in the eggs. _Solvitur ambulando_. Barrett laid the pill-boxes,  containing the precious specimens he had found in the nest at the top  of the hill, at the foot of the tree, and began to climb.    It was to be a day of surprises for him. When he had got half way up he  found himself on a kind of ledge, which appeared to be a kind of  junction at which the tree branched off into two parts. To the left was  the nest, high up in its fork. To the right was another shoot. He  realized at once, with keen disappointment, that it would be useless to  go further. The branches were obviously not strong enough to bear his  weight. He looked down, preparatory to commencing the descent, and to  his astonishment found himself looking into a black cavern. In his  eagerness to reach the nest he had not noticed before that the tree was  hollow.    This made up for a great many things. His disappointment became less  keen. Few things are more interesting than a hollow tree.    'Wonder how deep it goes down,' he said to himself. He broke off a  piece of wood and dropped it down the hollow. It seemed to reach the  ground uncommonly soon. He tried another piece. The sound of its fall  came up to him almost simultaneously. Evidently the hole was not deep.  He placed his hands on the edge, and let himself gently down into the  darkness. His feet touched something solid almost immediately. As far  as he could judge, the depth of the cavity was not more than five feet.  Standing up at his full height he could just rest his chin on the edge.    He seemed to be standing on some sort of a floor, roughly made, but too  regular to be the work of nature. Evidently someone had been here  before. He bent down to make certain. There was more room to move about  in than he suspected. A man sitting down would find it not  uncomfortable.    He brushed his hand along the floor. Certainly it seemed to be  constructed of boards. Then his hand hit something small and hard. He  groped about until his fingers closed on it. It was--what was it? He  could hardly make out for the moment. Suddenly, as he moved it,  something inside it rattled. Now he knew what it was. It was the very  thing he most needed, a box of matches.    The first match he struck promptly and naturally went out. No first  match ever stays alight for more than three-fifths of a second. The  second was more successful. The sudden light dazzled him for a moment.  When his eyes had grown accustomed to it, the match went out. He lit a  third, and this time he saw all round the little chamber. 'Great  Scott,' he said, 'the place is a regular poultry shop.' All round the  sides were hung pheasants and partridges in various stages of maturity.  Here and there the fur of a rabbit or a hare showed up amongst the  feathers. Barrett hit on the solution of the problem directly. He had  been shown a similar collection once in a tree on his father's land.  The place was the headquarters of some poacher. Barrett was full of  admiration for the ingenuity of the man in finding so safe a  hiding-place.    He continued his search. In one angle of the tree was a piece of  sacking. Barrett lifted it. He caught a glimpse of something bright,  but before he could confirm the vague suspicion that flashed upon him,  his match burnt down and lay smouldering on the floor. His hand  trembled with excitement as he started to light another. It broke off  in his hand. At last he succeeded. The light flashed up, and there  beside the piece of sacking which had covered them were two cups. He  recognized them instantly.    'Jove,' he gasped. 'The Sports pots! Now, how on earth--'    At this moment something happened which took his attention away from  his discovery with painful suddenness. From beneath him came the  muffled whine of a dog. He listened, holding his breath. No, he was not  mistaken. The dog whined again, and broke into an excited bark.  Somebody at the foot of the tree began to speak.          [8]    BARRETT CEASES TO EXPLORE      'Fetchimout!' said the voice, all in one word.    'Nice cheery remark to make!' thought Barrett. 'He'll have to do a good  bit of digging before he fetches _me_ out. I'm a fixture for the  present.'    There was a sound of scratching as if the dog, in his eagerness to  oblige, were trying to uproot the tree. Barrett, realizing that unless  the keeper took it into his head to climb, which was unlikely, he was  as safe as if he had been in his study at Philpott's, chuckled within  himself, and listened intently.    'What is it, then?' said the keeper. 'Good dog, at 'em! Fetch him out,  Jack.'    Jack barked excitedly, and redoubled his efforts.    The sound of scratching proceeded.    'R-r-r-ats-s-s!' said the mendacious keeper. Jack had evidently paused  for breath. Barrett began quite to sympathize with him. The thought  that the animal was getting farther away from the object of his search  with every ounce of earth he removed, tickled him hugely. He would have  liked to have been able to see the operations, though. At present it  was like listening to a conversation through a telephone. He could only  guess at what was going on.    Then he heard somebody whistling 'The Lincolnshire Poacher', a  strangely inappropriate air in the mouth of a keeper. The sound was too  far away to be the work of Jack's owner, unless he had gone for a  stroll since his last remark. No, it was another keeper. A new voice  came up to him.    ''Ullo, Ned, what's the dog after?'    'Thinks 'e's smelt a rabbit, seems to me.'    ''Ain't a rabbit hole 'ere.'    'Thinks there is, anyhow. Look at the pore beast!'    They both laughed. Jack meanwhile, unaware that he was turning himself  into an exhibition to make a keeper's holiday, dug assiduously. 'Come  away, Jack,' said the first keeper at length. 'Ain't nothin' there.  Ought to know that, clever dog like you.'    There was a sound as if he had pulled Jack bodily from his hole.    'Wait! 'Ere, Ned, what's that on the ground there?' Barrett gasped. His  pill-boxes had been discovered. Surely they would put two and two  together now, and "]]]
