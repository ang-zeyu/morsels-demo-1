Even when I was in the seventh and  eighth grades, when I had to fill out certain school papers and  was told to put an M for male or an F for female, there was a wee  bit of embarrassment or shyness associated with the use of gender  words.  The use of the word \"sex\" was still guarded against,  except in writing.  The word was never spoken in mixed company.  The word \"gender\" was considered bad enough.    And speaking of dirty-mouthed kids--no one in our family ever  used any kind of dirty words, at least not in my presence.  Some  of the brothers I grew up with are in their seventies now and I  can truthfully say, I can not recall ever having heard one of  them \"cuss\" nor utter a dirty word.    We have all heard of that proverbial corner around which  prosperity is lurking.  Well, at the Exum place we finally  rounded that corner and bumped right into it.  We got a  telephone.    I'm sure we didn't have a telephone at the Flint place.  But by  about the time I started to school, almost everyone in our  neighborhood had one.  There were maybe eight or ten parties on  the same line.    We owned our own telephone, put up our own lines, and bought our  own batteries.  Having so many on one line wasn't the best  arrangement but it was better than no phone at all.  It was a big  step forward at that time in the history of our community.    Every day at noon--straight up twelve o'clock--the operator would  ring a long, long ring.  We could set our clocks by it and we  could listen to the weather forecast immediately after the long  ring.  I don't know where they got the weather information,  probably from a record of what the weather did on that same day a  year ago, or maybe from the almanac.  Anyway, wherever they got  it, most of us listened to it and were stuck with it.    In the above paragraph I said the operator would ring.  That's  not exactly right.  It's true, she was a woman operator.  And we  kids knew she was a woman, but we didn't know she was an  operator.  We only knew her as \"Central.\"  As far as we were  concerned, her name might just as well have been Mrs. Central.    At any rate, when we wanted to ring someone on our line, out our  direction from \"Central,\" all we had to do was turn the crank and  ring their ring.  For instance, our ring was a long and four  shorts.  But, if we wanted to talk to someone on a line out  another direction from Hamlin, we had to ring a long ring to get  \"Central\" and get her to connect our line to the other line.  Then she would ring that party for us.    When any of us tried and tried to ring Central and couldn't get  her to answer, naturally all the phones on our line would be  ringing at the same time, and usually some neighbor on our line  would volunteer to ring for us and help us get through to  Central.  Perhaps the neighbor's phone had a stronger magneto, or  perhaps two or three of us ringing at the same time might send a  stronger current and get through to her.  We tried everything.    Come to think of it, there was the possibility that Central's  phone had been ringing from the beginning.  It was just barely  possible that she was eating a sandwich in another room.  And of  course, we shouldn't overlook the possibility that she might have  been out in the little house backed up to the alley.    Speaking of getting through to the operator, let me tell you  about one day when the operator got through to me.  Now, on this  particular day, Frank was the operator.  He was in command.    Frank, Earl, Joel and I were hoeing cotton.  Frank, being the  oldest and the one who would have to answer to Papa if the work  didn't get done, was working hard and was way out ahead of the  rest of us.  I was the youngest and least and was way behind, but  not too far behind to be able to talk to Earl and Joel.    After awhile Frank looked back and found us doing a lot of  standing and talking and not much working.  He shouted to us to  get to work.  We did for awhile because we knew Frank was boss.  But again we got to talking more than hoeing and Frank yelled  again, \"Get to work back there!\"    Now, I know it was hard on Frank, he being the oldest and having  all the responsibility for getting the hoeing done.  It was hard  on me too, just being the youngest with no responsibility.    Finally Frank got so far ahead that it seemed not so necessary to  obey him.  Some of us read the Bible with that same attitude.  We  seem to think that God has gone so far away we need not obey him  any more.  But I suppose God knows when we are loafing and  getting further behind, just as Frank knew about us boys that  day.  Anyway, we got more and more lax and Frank got more and  more tense.  Then he shouted again.  \"Get to work back there!\"    Earl looked at me and said, \"Tell him to come and make you.\"    Now, Earl always was one to recommend that someone else do  something he wouldn't do for anything.  But Earl also knew me and  he was reasonably sure I would do it.  That would leave him  guiltless and he would get to see the fun.  His pleasure would be  twofold.  He would glory in the thought that he had caused me to  do something that we both knew I shouldn't do and he would enjoy  seeing me get a good licking which he knew I had needed many  times more than I had gotten.    At the same time, I was eager to show off and furnish  entertainment for my \"fans.\"  So, I shouted back, \"Come and make  me!\"    And Frank did just that.    I knew what was coming long before he got to me.  I knew it would  hurt and I knew I deserved every bit of it.  But it was funny--in  a way.    By the time Frank got to me I was flat on my back with my feet  toward him.  I kicked furiously.  My laughing hindered me  somewhat but I managed to keep him at bay for awhile.    My feet were flying and aimed in his direction.  He circled  around me, trying to get at my weaker end--my head.  After two or  three rounds, he got me, and I got what was coming to me.    I was so tickled, it didn't seem to hurt at first.  But the more  I laughed the harder he whipped me.  If I remember right, I think  I quit laughing before he quit whipping.  Anyway, I had my fun  and my punishment, Earl and Joel saw a good show and Frank did  what he had to do.  And I worked harder after that.    Do you think I told Mama and Papa what Frank did to me?  Of  course not.  That would have brought a reprimand from them.  I  knew I had done wrong.  I also knew I had better let well enough  alone.    And did Frank tell them I had been a bad boy?  Certainly not.  He  had handled the situation well and we all knew he could do it  again next time.  That's the way our family discipline worked.    There were a lot of disadvantages to being little when I was  growing up.  I don't mean like the whipping I got from Frank.  That was okay.  I needed that.  I mean like things I wanted to  do.  There were so many things I wanted to do that Mama and Papa  wouldn't let me do.  They would say, \"You're too little.\"    With Earl and Joel, it was different.  They were not too little--  never had been.  At least, if they had been, I couldn't remember  it.    One thing I wanted to do was go hunting with Uncle Robert and his  greyhounds.  I remember I went one time, but most of the times I  was too little.  I had to stay home and hear them tell about the  rabbit hunt afterwards.    I guess the time they let me go was when they weren't going very  far and they figured I could keep up with the others for awhile.    Anyway, Robert had some dogs that were mighty fast and well  matched.  It was hard for a jack rabbit to get away from them.  Old Queen was his fastest one.  She was his lead dog.  Old Pluto  was almost as fast.  He would run in single file behind Old  Queen, and when a rabbit began to circle, Old Pluto would begin  to cut the corner to keep the rabbit going straight.    A rabbit likes to circle back to his home territory.  He knows  the lay of the land at home and figures he has a better chance to  survive.  But Robert's dogs wouldn't let him circle back.  That  seemed to frustrate him and make him easier to catch.    Robert also had about three other running dogs.  They were not  quite as fast as Queen and Pluto but they played important roles  in the pack.  They were good to spread out and help flush rabbits  out of the weeds and brush.  And they were also there at the end  of the chase to catch the rabbit in case he dodged quickly and  the two leading dogs failed to catch him.    When those dogs jumped a jack rabbit, you could just about write  him off as another dead rabbit.  About the only way a rabbit  could escape was to run into a patch of tall, thick feed where  the dogs couldn't see him.    Other men wanted to buy Robert's dogs at times but he took pride  in owning the best greyhounds for miles around, and his best ones  were not for sale.    Uncle Robert was a favorite of us boys.  He was Papa's youngest  brother and was only eight years older than Frank.  We liked just  about everything about him, especially the way he paid us when we  worked for him.  When we hoed or picked cotton for him, he paid  us as soon as we were through, and he paid us in cash, never by  check.  We hated checks.  Some men paid us boys by check, with  all our wages figured in together, usually along with Papa's.  Then we had to wait for Papa to go to town and get the money,  which might be as much as a week later.    But not so with Uncle Robert.  When time came for him to pay us  boys--as soon as the job was finished--he made it a point to have  a pocket full of coins so he could pay us then and there.  There  was no piece of paper, no writing and no waiting.  And he paid  each of us separately.    Another thing I was too little to do was go upstairs at  Grandma's.  Yet, I didn't mind that so much because I wasn't the  only one.  Even Earl and Joel couldn't go up there.    Robert and Ed were still living at home and not married.  Their  rooms were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54331"],[0,"Life of a Pioneer: Being the Autobiography of James S. Brown (#10)"],[1,"suffer, and I would never be  sorry for the action I had taken or for my enlistment. Every word he  said to me has been fulfilled to the very letter.    Uncle Alexander Stephens and I then went to a tent where men were  giving in their names as volunteers. We handed in our names, and were  enrolled as members of the historic Mormon Battalion.

IT was about one o'clock in the afternoon of July 9 when we bade our  friends an affectionate farewell, and started on what we understood to  be a journey of one hundred and thirty-eight miles, to join the army  of the United States at our country's call. We had provisions enough  put up to last us on our trip. The night previous our old clothes  had received the necessary repairs. Our preparations were hasty and  incomplete, for we had been told (by an unauthorized person, as we  afterwards learned) that when we got to Sarpy's Point, on the Missouri  River, we would draw uniforms, clothing, blankets, and rations, and  would have to cast aside our old clothes.    Our initial trip was begun without a blanket to wrap ourselves in,  as we thought we could find shelter in the camps along the line of  march. But in this we were mistaken, for everybody seemed to have  all they could do to shelter their own. The first night we camped on  the bank of a small stream, where we fell in with twelve or fifteen  other volunteers who had not so much as a bit of bread, but plenty of  assurance in asking for what others had. We divided with them, then  scraped what leaves we could and laid down thereon, with a chunk of  wood for our pillow. Next morning we divided our last morsel of food  with what we learned later were the very roughest element of the  battalion.    For five days we journeyed, much of the time in heavy rain and deep  mud, sleeping on the wet ground without blankets or other kind of  bedding, and living on elm bark and occasionally a very small ration  of buttermilk handed to us by humane sisters as we passed their tents.  We thought our experience was pretty rough, but I do not remember that  I heard murmuring from the lips of anyone, for we felt that we were in  the service of God and our country.    When we reached the Missouri River we found that some four hundred men  had rendezvoused there. In the camps of the Latter-day Saints, close  by, there were some thousands of men, women and children; a brush  bowery had been erected, where the people met for religious worship.  We soon found friends who welcomed us to camp, and we were invited to  a social dance and farewell party. We had excellent music, the best  dinner that the country could afford, and, above all, a spirit of  brotherly love and union that I have never seen surpassed. With all on  the altar of sacrifice for God and His kingdom and for our country, it  seemed that everything and everybody looked to the accomplishment of  one grand, common cause, not a dissenting voice being heard from anyone.    July 16, 1846, we were mustered into the service of the United States,  and, under command of Col. James Allen, marched down the bluffs to the  Missouri bottoms, where we camped in a cottonwood grove. Some flour  and other provisions were issued to us, and we peeled the bark off  a tree for a bread tray or kneading trough. Some rolled their dough  around sticks and stuck or held it before the fire, and others baked  their bread in the ashes; for we had not yet drawn any camp equipage.  We received one blanket apiece, and had that charged up, the amount to  be taken out of our pay.    I am not writing a history of the Mormon Battalion, but am relating my  individual experiences in that detachment of the United States army, as  I recollect them; so it will not be expected of me to tell much of what  others saw, or to narrate events as they remember them, but as they  impressed themselves upon my mind at the time of occurrence.    Just before our last farewell to friends at the Missouri River, and  preparatory to taking up our line of march, we were formed into a  hollow square, and President Brigham Young, with Heber C. Kimball and  others of the Apostles, came to our camp, rode into the square, and  gave us parting blessings and instructions. The words of President  Young, as they fastened themselves upon my memory, were in substance as  follows: \"Now, brethren, you are going as soldiers at your country's  call. You will travel in a foreign land, in an enemy's country; and  if you will live your religion, obey your officers, attend to your  prayers, and as you travel in an enemy's land, hold sacred the property  of the people, never taking anything that does not belong to you only  in case of starvation; though you may be traveling in an enemy's  country, do not disturb fruit orchards or chicken coops or beehives, do  not take anything but what you pay for--although it is customary for  soldiers to plunder their enemies in time of war, it is wrong--always  spare life when possible; if you obey this counsel, attending to  your prayers to the Lord, I promise you in the name of the Lord God  of Israel that not one soul of you shall fall by the hands of the  enemy. You will pass over battlefields; battles will be fought in your  front and in your rear, on your right hand and on your left, and your  enemies shall flee before you. Your names shall be held in honorable  remembrance to the latest generation.\"    Heber C. Kimball and other prominent men of the Church confirmed what  President Young had said, and all bade us an affectionate farewell,  with \"God bless you and spare your lives.\"    Thus we set out in good cheer on our journey of more than two thousand  miles in a section of the continent wholly unknown to us.    In the month of July, from about the 20th, we passed down through the  towns and villages along the river, for two hundred miles, to Fort  Leavenworth. The heat was excessive, and the roads dusty, when we  started out. A great part of the way we had only a small ration of  food, for it did not seem to be in the country, and we suffered much  from want. We took regular turns in standing guard around the camp and  in herding the stock. Heavy rains came on, and for several days we  pressed forward amid such terrible storms as I never had experienced  before. With less than half rations, and that badly or insufficiently  cooked, from lack of proper utensils and experience, and having to lie  on the ground without any bedding save one blanket each, it is a wonder  the entire camp were not down sick instead of a few. But with all this  hardship there were no desertions and few complaints. Everything seemed  to move harmoniously among the men.    The command crossed the river at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and soon  afterwards we drew a tent to each mess of six men. This afforded us  great relief at nights, protecting us from the dews and rain; but in  the daytime the whiteness of the tents seemed to intensify the heat so  that there was no comfort in them. While at Fort Leavenworth we washed  our old clothing and made ourselves as comfortable as possible. Soon we  drew camp equipage and rations from the government. We got flintlock  muskets, and accoutrements consisting of bayonets, cartridge-boxes,  straps and belts, canteens, haversacks, etc., also a knapsack each.  We drew our first pay, forty-two dollars each, sent part of it to our  families, and fitted ourselves out with new clothes and shoes.    With all the paraphernalia of soldiers, we seemed so burdened as to  be able neither to run nor to fight. Then to be obliged to travel all  day under a broiling sun, or in driving rain or fierce winds, across  sandy deserts and over trackless mountains, going sometimes sixty to  ninety miles without water, in an enemy's country--kind reader, you  may picture such scenes in your imagination, but it is impossible for  you to realize the conditions except by actual experience therein.  It is equally impossible for me to find language to describe fitly  the situation at that time at the United States military post of Fort  Leavenworth.    The place being an outfitting station for United States forces in the  war with Mexico, all was bustle and activity; steamboats were unloading  material, and teams filled the streets; many of the new recruits  were very rough indeed, and drinking and fighting seemed to be their  pastime; myself and companions were amazed and shocked at the profane  and vulgar language and vile actions that we were compelled to listen  to and witness; with all else, squads of soldiers were being drilled,  the bugle sound was frequent, as were also the beating of the drum and  the playing of the fife; everywhere the men were preparing for victory  or death, and many were so reckless they did not seem to care which  came.    As our battalion was preparing quietly for the great march before us,  a band of very small Mexican mules was brought in to be used as teams  in our transportation department. The animals were unaccustomed to  harness, and very wild, so there was a detail of men from each company  assigned to do the harnessing. It fell to my lot to engage in the work,  and great was my surprise to see one of those little mules dragging  three to five men about the yards. I thought I was able to handle one  of the little long-eared animals myself, but had the conceit taken out  of me in quick order by having my hands"]]]
