Niccolo, (dell'Abate) for many exquisite productions,  and that they are entitled to the fame of having been the first who  introduced Roman taste into France, with all the beau ideal of ancient  painting and sculpture.\" At the Te of Mantua there remains the frieze of  stuccos, so highly commended by Vasari, from Primaticcio's own hand, as  well as a few pictures, which last, however, are not so assuredly his. His  pictures indeed are objects of the utmost rarity in Italy, and in Bologna  itself. In the grand Zambeccari gallery there is a concert by him, with  three female figures, altogether enchanting; the forms, the motions, the  colouring, the taste of the lines and folding so easy and chaste, all  combined with a certain originality pervading the whole, are well  calculated to attract and rivet the eye at the first moment. When dying, he  assigned Niccolo Abati, called too dell'Abate, to continue his grand works,  because he had brought him from Bologna, and laid the ground-work of his  fortunes. An account of this delightful painter may be found in the  Modenese School. He was not Primaticcio's pupil, but one Ruggiero Ruggieri  was, and conducted by him into France, he left few paintings in his own  country; to whom we may perhaps add one Francesco Caccianemici, called by  Vasari his disciple, from whose hand, at Bologna, there only remain a few  doubtful specimens.    Much under the same circumstances as Primaticcio and Abati appeared  Pellegrino Pellegrini, whose patronymic was Tibaldi, a native of Valdelsa  in the Milanese; though residing from his childhood, educated, and  established at Bologna. He next filled the same situation at the court of  Spain, as the two preceding had done at that of France; he decorated it  with his paintings, improved its taste in architecture, formed pupils, and  rose in fortune until he at length became Marquess of that Valdelsa, where  his father and uncle had resided as poor masons before they went to  Bologna. It is not known who first imbued his liberal spirit with the  elements of learning; but Vasari traces his progress from some pictures of  his in the refectory of S. Michele in Bosco, copied by Tibaldi when young,  along with other select pieces at Bologna. From this place he follows him  to Rome in 1547, eager to study the finest works in that capital, where,  after three years' residence, he re-conducts him to Bologna, still very  young, but advanced in the knowledge of his art. His style was in great  part formed upon the models of Michelangiolo--vast, correct in drawing,  bold, and happy in his foreshortenings; yet, at the same time, tempered  with so much mellowness and softness, as to induce the Caracci to  denominate him the reformed Michelangiolo. The first work which he  conducted, subsequent to the year 1550, is in the Bolognese Institution,  and it is the most perfect, in Vasari's opinion, ever executed by him. It  contains in particular various stories from the Odyssey, and this work,  with that by Niccolino, mentioned elsewhere,[11] both executed for the  Institution, were afterwards finely engraved by Sig. Antonio Buratti of  Venice, accompanied with the lives of the two painters, written by Zanotti.  Both there, and in the great merchants' hall at Ancona, where he  subsequently represented Hercules, the monster-slayer, Tibaldi exhibited  the true method of imitating the terrible in the style of Michelangiolo,  which consisted in a fear of too nearly approaching him. Although Vasari  greatly commends these works, the Caracci, to whose judgment we would  rather defer, have bestowed higher praises on those executed by Pellegrino  for the church of S. Jacopo; and it was on these pictures that both the  Caracci and their pupils bestowed most study. In one is represented the  preaching of St. John in the desert; in another the separation of the elect  from the wicked, where, in the features of the celestial messenger  announcing the tidings, Pellegrino displayed those of his favourite  Michelangiolo. What a school for design and for expression is here! What  art in the distribution of such a throng of figures, in varying and in  grouping them! In Loreto too, and in different adjacent cities, he produced  other histories, less celebrated perhaps, but all nearly as deserving of  the burin as those executed at Bologna. Such is the Entrance of Trajan into  Ancona, in possession of the Marchese Mancinforte; and various exploits of  Scipio, belonging to the accomplished nobleman, Marchese Ciccolini, which  decorate one of his halls, where he himself pointed them out to me. It is a  work conceived in a more refined and graceful taste than we meet with in  other compositions of Tibaldi; and of the same composition I have seen some  of his pictures on a very small scale; but rare, like all his pieces in  oil; wrought with the exquisite finish of a miniaturist; mostly rich in  figures, full of fine spirit, vivid colouring, and decorated with all the  pleasing perspectives that architecture could afford. This indeed was his  favourite art; which, after he had afforded some beautiful specimens of it  in Piceno, and next at Milan, procured him an appointment from Philip II.  to superintend the engineers at the Spanish Court. There again, after the  lapse of twenty years, during which he never touched the easel, he resumed  the art of painting; and we meet with a list of his works in the Escurial  of Mazzolari.         Footnote 11: In vol. iv. p. 47.    Domenico Tibaldi de' Pellegrini, once conjectured to be the son, was the  pupil and brother of Pellegrino; and his name is in great repute among the  architects and engravers of Bologna. His epitaph at San Mammolo states him  also to have been a distinguished painter; but we must receive the  authority of epitaphs with some caution; and not even a portrait from his  hand is to be met with. Faberio speaks less highly of his powers, and in  the funeral oration upon Agostino Caracci, whose master he had been, he  mentions him as an able designer, engraver, and architect. Pellegrino's  pupils in painting, and no obscure artists, were Girolamo Miruoli,  commended by Vasari among the artists of Romagna, who left one of his  frescos at the Servi, in Bologna, and several other pieces at Parma, where  he filled the office of court-painter, and there died; and secondly, Gio.  Francesco Bezzi, called Nosadella, who painted a great deal at Bologna and  in other cities, in the style of his master, exaggerating it in point of  power, but not equalling it in care, and in short, reducing it to mere  mechanic labour and despatch.    Vasari, in his life of Parmigianino, has mentioned with praise Vincenzio  Caccianemici, of a good family in Bologna, respecting whom there have been  some discussions, to avoid confounding him with Francesco, who bore the  same surname. The correctors of the old _Guide_ suppose him to be the  author of a Decollation of St. John, placed at S. Petronio, in the family  chapel; a picture well designed and better coloured, and executed, as they  observe, in the style of Parmigianino.    Whilst the three great geniuses of the Bolognese School were residing  abroad, the two first mentioned in France, and the third in Milan, and  afterwards in Spain, the art continued stationary, or, more correctly,  declined in Bologna. In the year 1569 three masters are pointed out by  Vasari, namely, Fontana, Sabbatini, and Sammachini, whom he calls  Fumaccini. For what reason he excluded Ercole Procaccini, an artist, if not  of great genius, at least of finished execution, I am unable to say.  Certain it is that Lomazzo, whilst he resided with him in Milan, mentioned  him in the highest terms, and enumerated in the list of his pupils  Sabbatini, and Sammachini too. I shall not here repeat what I have detailed  in the Milanese School respecting Ercole and his sons; but, passing on to  the others, I shall begin with Fontana, the principal cause of the decline  above alluded to.    The long protracted life of this artist comprehended the whole of the  period now under our view, and even extended beyond it. Born in the time of  Francia, educated by Imola, who at his death selected him to finish one of  his pictures, and subsequently employed for a long period as the assistant  of Vaga, and of Vasari, he continued to labour and to teach without  intermission, until the Caracci, once his disciples, drew all his  commissions and followers to themselves. For this result he was indebted to  his own conduct. Devoted to pleasure (the most fatal enemy to an artist's  reputation) he could only provide the means of gratification by burthening  himself with works, and executing them with little care. He possessed a  fertility of ideas, a vehemence, and a cultivation of mind, well adapted  for works of magnitude. Abandoning, therefore, the careful finish of  Francucci, he adopted the method of Vasari, and like him covered with his  works a vast number of walls in a short space of time, and nearly in the  same taste. In design he is more negligent than Vasari, in his motions more  energetic; his colours have the same yellow cast, but rather more delicacy.  In Citta di Castello a hall of the noble family of Vitelli is filled with  family histories, painted by him in a few weeks, as Malvasia informs us,  and the work confirms the assertion. Similar specimens, or but little  superior, are met with in Rome, at the Villa Giulia, and at the Palazzo di  Toscana, in the Campo Marzio, and in various houses in Bologna. Yet in  other places he appears an artist of merit for a declining age; as in his  Epiphany, at the Grazie, where he displays a facility, a pomp of drapery,  and a magnificence nearly approaching the style of Paul Veronese. This work  bears the name of the painter written in letters of gold. But his best  claim to distinction is founded on his portraits, which are more "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4011"],[0,"Epicoene; Or, The Silent Woman (#10)"],[1," next, if she shall have a new servant? and how many? which of her     family would make the best bawd, male, or female? what precedence     she shall have by her next match? and sets down the answers, and     believes them above the scriptures. Nay, perhaps she will study the     art.       MOR: Gentle sir, have you done? have you had your pleasure of me?     I'll think of these things.       TRUE: Yes sir: and then comes reeking home of vapour and sweat,     with going a foot, and lies in a month of a new face, all oil and     birdlime; and rises in asses' milk, and is cleansed with a new     fucus: God be wi' you, sir. One thing more, which I had almost     forgot. This too, with whom you are to marry, may have made a     conveyance of her virginity afore hand, as your wise widows do of     their states, before they marry, in trust to some friend, sir: who     can tell? Or if she have not done it yet, she may do, upon the     wedding-day, or the night before, and antedate you cuckold. The     like has been heard of in nature.

MOR: O, Cutbeard, Cutbeard, Cutbeard! here has been a cut-throat     with me: help me in to my bed, and give me physic with thy counsel.       [EXEUNT.]       SCENE 2.2.       A ROOM IN SIR JOHN DAW'S HOUSE.       ENTER DAW, CLERIMONT, DAUPHINE, AND EPICOENE.       DAW: Nay, an she will, let her refuse at her own charges: 'tis     nothing to me, gentlemen: but she will not be invited to the like     feasts or guests every day.       CLER: O, by no means, she may not refuse--to stay at home, if you     love your reputation: 'Slight, you are invited thither o' purpose     to be seen, and laughed at by the lady of the college, and her     shadows. This trumpeter hath proclaim'd you.     [ASIDE TO EPICOENE.]       DAUP: You shall not go; let him be laugh'd at in your stead, for     not bringing you: and put him to his extemporal faculty of fooling     and talking loud, to satisfy the company.     [ASIDE TO EPICOENE.]       CLER: He will suspect us, talk aloud.--'Pray, mistress Epicoene,     let us see your verses; we have sir John Daw's leave: do not     conceal your servant's merit, and your own glories.       EPI: They'll prove my servant's glories, if you have his leave so     soon.       DAUP: His vain-glories, lady!       DAW: Shew them, shew them, mistress, I dare own them.       EPI: Judge you, what glories.       DAW: Nay, I'll read them myself too: an author must recite his     own works. It is a madrigal of Modesty.     Modest, and fair, for fair and good are near     Neighbours, howe'er.--       DAUP: Very good.       CLER: Ay, is't not?       DAW: No noble virtue ever was alone,     But two in one.       DAUP: Excellent!       CLER: That again, I pray, sir John.       DAUP: It has something in't like rare wit and sense.       CLER: Peace.       DAW: No noble virtue ever was alone,     But two in one.     Then, when I praise sweet modesty, I praise     Bright beauty's rays:     And having praised both beauty and modesty,     I have praised thee.       DAUP: Admirable!       CLER: How it chimes, and cries tink in the close, divinely!       DAUP: Ay, 'tis Seneca.       CLER: No, I think 'tis Plutarch.       DAW: The dor on Plutarch, and Seneca! I hate it: they are mine own     imaginations, by that light. I wonder those fellows have such     credit with gentlemen.       CLER: They are very grave authors.       DAW: Grave asses! mere essayists: a few loose sentences, and that's     all. A man would talk so, his whole age: I do utter as good things     every hour, if they were collected and observed, as either of     them.       DAUP: Indeed, sir John!       CLER: He must needs; living among the wits and braveries too.       DAUP: Ay, and being president of them, as he is.       DAW: There's Aristotle, a mere common-place fellow; Plato, a     discourser; Thucydides and Livy, tedious and dry; Tacitus, an     entire knot: sometimes worth the untying, very seldom.       CLER: What do you think of the poets, sir John?       DAW: Not worthy to be named for authors. Homer, an old tedious,     prolix ass, talks of curriers, and chines of beef. Virgil of     dunging of land, and bees. Horace, of I know not what.       CLER: I think so.       DAW: And so Pindarus, Lycophron, Anacreon, Catullus, Seneca the     tragedian, Lucan, Propertius, Tibullus, Martial, Juvenal,     Ausonius, Statius, Politian, Valerius Flaccus, and the rest--       CLER: What a sack full of their names he has got!       DAUP: And how he pours them out! Politian with Valerius Flaccus!       CLER: Was not the character right of him?       DAUP: As could be made, i'faith.       DAW: And Persius, a crabbed coxcomb, not to be endured.       DAUP: Why, whom do you account for authors, sir John Daw?       DAW: Syntagma juris civilis; Corpus juris civilis; Corpus juris     canonici; the king of Spain's bible--       DAUP: Is the king of Spain's bible an author?       CLER: Yes, and Syntagma.       DAUP: What was that Syntagma, sir?       DAW: A civil lawyer, a Spaniard.       DAUP: Sure, Corpus was a Dutchman.       CLER: Ay, both the Corpuses, I knew 'em: they were very corpulent     authors.       DAW: And, then there's Vatablus, Pomponatius, Symancha: the other     are not to be received, within the thought of a scholar.       DAUP: 'Fore God, you have a simple learned servant, lady,--     in titles. [ASIDE.]       CLER: I wonder that he is not called to the helm, and made a     counsellor!       DAUP: He is one extraordinary.       CLER: Nay, but in ordinary: to say truth, the state wants such.       DAUP: Why that will follow.       CLER: I muse a mistress can be so silent to the dotes of such a     servant.       DAW: 'Tis her virtue, sir. I have written somewhat of her silence     too.       DAUP: In verse, sir John?       CLER: What else?       DAUP: Why? how can you justify your own being of a poet, that so     slight all the old poets?       DAW: Why? every man that writes in verse is not a poet; you have of     the wits that write verses, and yet are no poets: they are poets     that live by it, the poor fellows that live by it.       DAUP: Why, would not you live by your verses, sir John?       CLER: No, 'twere pity he should. A knight live by his verses? he     did not make them to that end, I hope.       DAUP: And yet the noble Sidney lives by his, and the noble family     not ashamed.       CLER: Ay, he profest himself; but sir John Daw has more caution:     he'll not hinder his own rising in the state so much. Do you     think he will? Your verses, good sir John, and no poems.       DAW: Silence in woman, is like speech in man,     Deny't who can.       DAUP: Not I, believe it: your reason, sir.       DAW: Nor, is't a tale,     That female vice should be a virtue male,     Or masculine vice a female virtue be:     You shall it see     Prov'd with increase;     I know to speak, and she to hold her peace.     Do you conceive me, gentlemen?       DAUP: No, faith; how mean you \"with increase,\" sir John?       DAW: Why, with increase is, when I court her for the common cause of     mankind; and she says nothing, but \"consentire videtur\": and in     time is gravida.       DAUP: Then this is a ballad of procreation?       CLER: A madrigal of procreation; you mistake.       EPI: 'Pray give me my verses again, servant.       DAW: If you'll ask them aloud, you shall.     [WALKS ASIDE WITH THE PAPERS.]       [ENTER TRUEWIT WITH HIS HORN.]       CLER: See, here's Truewit again!--Where hast thou been, in the     name of madness! thus accoutred with thy horn?       TRUE: Where the sound of it might have pierced your sense with     gladness, had you been in ear-reach of it. Dauphine, fall down     and worship me: I have forbid the bans, lad: I have been with thy     virtuous uncle, and have broke the match.       DAUP: You have not, I hope.       TRUE: Yes faith; if thou shouldst hope otherwise, I should repent me:     this horn got me entrance; kiss it. I had no other way to get in,     but by faining to be a post; but when I got in once, I proved none,     but rather the contrary, turn'd him into a post, or a stone, or     what is stiffer, with thundering into him the incommodities of a     wife, and the miseries of marriage. If ever Gorgon were seen in     the shape of a woman, he hath seen her in my description: I have     put him off o' that scent for ever.--Why do you not applaud and     adore me, sirs? why stand you mute? are you stupid? You are not     worthy of the benefit.       DAUP: Did not I tell you? Mischief!--       CLER: I would you had placed this benefit somewhere else.       TRUE: Why so?       CLER: 'Slight, you have done the most inconsiderate, rash, weak     thing, that ever man did to his friend.       DAUP: Friend! if the most malicious enemy I have, had studied to     inflict an injury upon me, it could not be a greater.       TRUE: Wherein, for Gods-sake? Gentlemen, come to yourselves again.       DAUP: But I presaged thus much afore to you.       CLER: Would my lips had been solder'd when I spake on't. Slight,     what moved you to be thus impertinent?       TRUE: My masters, do not put on this strange face to pay my     courtesy; off with this visor. Have good turns done you, and thank     'em this way!       DAUP: 'Fore heav'n, you have undone me. That which I have plotted     for, and been maturing now these four months, you have blasted in a     minute: Now I am lost, I may speak. This gentlewoman was lodged     here by me o' purpose, and, to be put upon my uncle, hath profest     this obstinate silence for my sake; "]]]
