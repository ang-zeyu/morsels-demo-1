'You' means  me--then Ribby is not going to even taste the pie herself? A pink and  white pie-dish! Ribby is sure to go out to buy the muffins..... Oh what  a good idea! Why shouldn't I rush along and put my pie into Ribby's oven  when Ribby isn't there?\"    Duchess was quite delighted with her own cleverness!    Ribby in the meantime had received Duchess's answer, and as soon as she  was sure that the little dog would come--she popped HER pie into the  oven. There were two ovens, one above the other; some other knobs and  handles were only ornamental and not intended to open. Ribby put the pie  into the lower oven; the door was very stiff.    \"The top oven bakes too quickly,\" said Ribby to herself. \"It is a pie of  the most delicate and tender mouse minced up with bacon. And I have  taken out all the bones; because Duchess did nearly choke herself with a  fish-bone last time I gave a party. She eats a little fast--rather big  mouthfuls. But a most genteel and elegant little dog infinitely superior  company to Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.\"    Ribby put on some coal and swept up the hearth. Then she went out with a  can to the well, for water to fill up the kettle.    Then she began to set the room in order, for it was the sitting-room as  well as the kitchen. She shook the mats out at the front-door and put  them straight; the hearth-rug was a rabbit-skin. She dusted the clock  and the ornaments on the mantelpiece, and she polished and rubbed the  tables and chairs.    Then she spread a very clean white table-cloth, and set out her best  china tea-set, which she took out of a wall-cupboard near the fireplace.  The tea-cups were white with a pattern of pink roses; and the  dinner-plates were white and blue.    When Ribby had laid the table she took a jug and a blue and white dish,  and went out down the field to the farm, to fetch milk and butter.    When she came back, she peeped into the bottom oven; the pie looked very  comfortable.    Ribby put on her shawl and bonnet and went out again with a basket, to  the village shop to buy a packet of tea, a pound of lump sugar, and a  pot of marmalade.    And just at the same time, Duchess came out of HER house, at the other  end of the village.    Ribby met Duchess half-way own the street, also carrying a basket,  covered with a cloth. They only bowed to one another; they did not  speak, because they were going to have a party.    As soon as Duchess had got round the corner out of sight--she simply  ran! Straight away to Ribby's house!    Ribby went into the shop and bought what she required, and came out,  after a pleasant gossip with Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.    Cousin Tabitha was disdainful afterwards in conversation--    \"A little DOG indeed! Just as if there were no CATS in Sawrey! And a PIE  for afternoon tea! The very idea!\" said Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.    Ribby went on to Timothy Baker's and bought the muffins. Then she went  home.    There seemed to be a sort of scuffling noise in the back passage, as she  was coming in at the front door.    \"I trust that is not that Pie: the spoons are locked up, however,\" said  Ribby.    But there was nobody there. Ribby opened the bottom oven door with some  difficulty, and turned the pie. There began to be a pleasing smell of  baked mouse!    Duchess in the meantime, had slipped out at the back door.    \"It is a very odd thing that Ribby's pie was NOT in the oven when I put  mine in! And I can t find it anywhere; I have looked all over the house.  I put MY pie into a nice hot oven at the top. I could not turn any of  the other handles; I think that they are all shams,\" said Duchess, \"but  I wish I could have removed the pie made of mouse! I cannot think what  she has done with it? I heard Ribby coming and I had to run out by the  back door!\"    Duchess went home and brushed her beautiful black coat; and then she  picked a bunch of flowers in her garden as a present for Ribby; and  passed the time until the clock struck four.    Ribby--having assured herself by careful search that there was really no  one hiding in the cupboard or in the larder--went upstairs to change her  dress.    She put on a lilac silk gown, for the party, and an embroidered muslin  apron and tippet.    \"It is very strange,\" said Ribby, \"I did not THINK I left that drawer  pulled out; has somebody been trying on my mittens?\"    She came downstairs again, and made the tea, and put the teapot on the  hob. She peeped again into the BOTTOM oven, the pie had become a lovely  brown, and it was steaming hot.    She sat down before the fire to wait for the little dog. \"I am glad I  used the BOTTOM oven,\" said Ribby, \"the top one would certainly have  been very much too hot. I wonder why that cupboard door was open? Can  there really have been some one in the house?\"    Very punctually at four o'clock, Duchess started to go to the party. She  ran so fast through the village that she was too early, and she had to  wait a little while in the lane that leads down to Ribby's house.    \"I wonder if Ribby has taken MY pie out of the oven yet?\" said Duchess,  \"and whatever can have become of the other pie made of mouse?\"    At a quarter past four to the minute, there came a most genteel little  tap-tappity. \"Is Mrs. Ribston at home?\" inquired Duchess in the porch.    \"Come in! and how do you do, my dear Duchess?\" cried Ribby. \"I hope I  see you well?\"    \"Quite well, I thank you, and how do YOU do, my dear Ribby?\" said  Duchess. \"I've brought you some flowers; what a delicious smell of pie!\"    \"Oh, what lovely flowers! Yes, it is mouse and bacon!\"    \"Do not talk about food, my dear Ribby,\" said Duchess; \"what a lovely  white tea-cloth!.... Is it done to a turn? Is it still in the oven?\"    \"I think it wants another five minutes,\" said Ribby. \"Just a shade  longer; I will pour out the tea, while we wait. Do you take sugar, my  dear Duchess?\"    \"Oh yes, please! my dear Ribby; and may I have a lump upon my nose?\"    \"With pleasure, my dear Duchess; how beautifully you beg! Oh, how  sweetly pretty!\"    Duchess sat up with the sugar on her nose and sniffed--    \"How good that pie smells! I do love veal and ham--I mean to say mouse  and bacon----\"    She dropped the sugar in confusion, and had to go hunting under the  tea-table, so did not see which oven Ribby opened in order to get out  the pie.    Ribby set the pie upon the table; there was a very savoury smell.    Duchess came out from under the table-cloth munching sugar, and sat up  on a chair.    \"I will first cut the pie for you; I am going to have muffin and  marmalade,\" said Ribby.    \"Do you really prefer muffin? Mind the patty-pan!\"    \"I beg your pardon?\" said Ribby.    \"May I pass you the marmalade?\" said Duchess hurriedly.    The pie proved extremely toothsome, and the muffins light and hot. They  disappeared rapidly, especially the pie!    \"I think\"--(thought the Duchess to herself)--\"I THINK it would be wiser  if I helped myself to pie; though Ribby did not seem to notice anything  when she was cutting it. What very small fine pieces it has cooked into!  I did not remember that I had minced it up so fine; I suppose this is a  quicker oven than my own.\"    \"How fast Duchess is eating!\" thought Ribby to herself, as she buttered  her fifth muffin.    The pie-dish was emptying rapidly! Duchess had had four helps already,  and was fumbling with the spoon.    \"A little more bacon, my dear Duchess?\" said Ribby.    \"Thank you, my dear Ribby; I was only feeling for the patty-pan.\"    \"The patty-pan? my dear Duchess?\"    \"The patty-pan that held up the pie-crust,\" said Duchess, blushing under  her black coat.    \"Oh, I didn't put one in, my dear Duchess,\" said Ribby; \"I don't think  that it is necessary in pies made of mouse.\"    Duchess fumbled with the spoon--\"I can't find it!\" she said anxiously.    \"There isn't a patty-pan,\" said Ribby, looking perplexed.    \"Yes, indeed, my dear Ribby; where can it have gone to?\" said Duchess.    \"There most certainly is not one, my dear Duchess. I disapprove of tin  articles in puddings and pies. It is most undesirable--(especially when  people swallow in lumps!)\" she added in a lower voice.    Duchess looked very much alarmed, and continued to scoop the inside of  the pie-dish.    \"My Great-aunt Squintina (grandmother of Cousin Tabitha Twitchit)--died  of a thimble in a Christmas plum-pudding. _I_ never put any article of  metal in MY puddings or pies.\"    Duchess looked aghast, and tilted up the pie-dish.    \"I have only four patty-pans, and they are all in the cupboard.\"    Duchess set up a howl.    \"I shall die! I shall die! I have swallowed a patty-pan! Oh, my dear  Ribby, I do feel so ill!\"    \"It is impossible, my dear Duchess; there was not a patty-pan.\"    Duchess moaned and whined and rocked herself about.    \"Oh I feel so dreadful. I have swallowed a patty-pan!\"    \"There was NOTHING in the pie,\" said Ribby severely.    \"Yes there WAS, my dear Ribby, I am sure I have swallowed it!\"    \"Let me prop you up with a pillow, my dear Duchess; where do you think  you feel it?\"    \"Oh I do feel so ill ALL OVER me, my dear Ribby; I have swallowed a  large tin patty-pan with a sharp scalloped edge!\"    \"Shall I run for the doctor? I will just lock up the spoons!\"    \"Oh yes, yes! fetch Dr. Maggotty, my dear Ribby: he is a Pie himself, he  will certainly understand.\"    Ribby settled Duchess in an armchair before the fire, and went out and  hurried to the village to look for the doctor.    She found him at the smithy.    He was occupied in putting rusty nails into a bottle of ink, which he  had obtained at the post office.    \"Gammon? ha! HA!\" said he, with his head on one side.    Ribby explained that her guest had swallowed a patty-pan.    \"Spinach? ha! HA!\" said he,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5827"],[0,"The Problems of Philosophy (#10)"],[1,"to be observed that all such expectations are only _probable_; thus  we have not to seek for a proof that they _must_ be fulfilled, but  only for some reason in favour of the view that they are _likely_ to be  fulfilled.    Now in dealing with this question we must, to begin with, make an  important distinction, without which we should soon become involved  in hopeless confusions. Experience has shown us that, hitherto, the  frequent repetition of some uniform succession or coexistence has been a  _cause_ of our expecting the same succession or coexistence on the next  occasion. Food that has a certain appearance generally has a certain  taste, and it is a severe shock to our expectations when the familiar  appearance is found to be associated with an unusual taste. Things which  we see become associated, by habit, with certain tactile sensations  which we expect if we touch them; one of the horrors of a ghost (in  many ghost-stories) is that it fails to give us any sensations of touch.  Uneducated people who go abroad for the first time are so surprised as  to be incredulous when they find their native language not understood.    And this kind of association is not confined to men; in animals also it  is very strong. A horse which has been often driven along a certain  road resists the attempt to drive him in a different direction. Domestic  animals expect food when they see the person who usually feeds them. We  know that all these rather crude expectations of uniformity are liable  to be misleading. The man who has fed the chicken every day throughout  its life at last wrings its neck instead, showing that more refined  views as to the uniformity of nature would have been useful to the  chicken.    But in spite of the misleadingness of such expectations, they  nevertheless exist. The mere fact that something has happened a certain  number of times causes animals and men to expect that it will happen  again. Thus our instincts certainly cause us to believe that the sun  will rise to-morrow, but we may be in no better a position than the  chicken which unexpectedly has its neck wrung. We have therefore to  distinguish the fact that past uniformities _cause_ expectations as to  the future, from the question whether there is any reasonable ground for  giving weight to such expectations after the question of their validity  has been raised.    The problem we have to discuss is whether there is any reason for  believing in what is called 'the uniformity of nature'. The belief in  the uniformity of nature is the belief that everything that has happened  or will happen is an instance of some general law to which there are no  exceptions. The crude expectations which we have been considering are  all subject to exceptions, and therefore liable to disappoint those who  entertain them. But science habitually assumes, at least as a working  hypothesis, that general rules which have exceptions can be replaced by  general rules which have no exceptions. 'Unsupported bodies in air fall'  is a general rule to which balloons and aeroplanes are exceptions. But  the laws of motion and the law of gravitation, which account for the  fact that most bodies fall, also account for the fact that balloons and  aeroplanes can rise; thus the laws of motion and the law of gravitation  are not subject to these exceptions.    The belief that the sun will rise to-morrow might be falsified if the  earth came suddenly into contact with a large body which destroyed its  rotation; but the laws of motion and the law of gravitation would not  be infringed by such an event. The business of science is to find  uniformities, such as the laws of motion and the law of gravitation,  to which, so far as our experience extends, there are no exceptions.  In this search science has been remarkably successful, and it may be  conceded that such uniformities have held hitherto. This brings us back  to the question: Have we any reason, assuming that they have always held  in the past, to suppose that they will hold in the future?    It has been argued that we have reason to know that the future will  resemble the past, because what was the future has constantly become the  past, and has always been found to resemble the past, so that we really  have experience of the future, namely of times which were formerly  future, which we may call past futures. But such an argument really begs  the very question at issue. We have experience of past futures, but not  of future futures, and the question is: Will future futures resemble  past futures? This question is not to be answered by an argument which  starts from past futures alone. We have therefore still to seek for some  principle which shall enable us to know that the future will follow the  same laws as the past.    The reference to the future in this question is not essential. The same  question arises when we apply the laws that work in our experience to  past things of which we have no experience--as, for example, in geology,  or in theories as to the origin of the Solar System. The question we  really have to ask is: 'When two things have been found to be often  associated, and no instance is known of the one occurring without the  other, does the occurrence of one of the two, in a fresh instance, give  any good ground for expecting the other?' On our answer to this question  must depend the validity of the whole of our expectations as to the  future, the whole of the results obtained by induction, and in fact  practically all the beliefs upon which our daily life is based.    It must be conceded, to begin with, that the fact that two things have  been found often together and never apart does not, by itself, suffice  to _prove_ demonstratively that they will be found together in the next  case we examine. The most we can hope is that the oftener things are  found together, the more probable it becomes that they will be found  together another time, and that, if they have been found together often  enough, the probability will amount _almost_ to certainty. It can  never quite reach certainty, because we know that in spite of frequent  repetitions there sometimes is a failure at the last, as in the case  of the chicken whose neck is wrung. Thus probability is all we ought to  seek.    It might be urged, as against the view we are advocating, that we  know all natural phenomena to be subject to the reign of law, and that  sometimes, on the basis of observation, we can see that only one law  can possibly fit the facts of the case. Now to this view there are two  answers. The first is that, even if _some_ law which has no exceptions  applies to our case, we can never, in practice, be sure that we have  discovered that law and not one to which there are exceptions. The  second is that the reign of law would seem to be itself only probable,  and that our belief that it will hold in the future, or in unexamined  cases in the past, is itself based upon the very principle we are  examining.    The principle we are examining may be called the _principle of  induction_, and its two parts may be stated as follows:    (a) When a thing of a certain sort A has been found to be associated  with a thing of a certain other sort B, and has never been found  dissociated from a thing of the sort B, the greater the number of cases  in which A and B have been associated, the greater is the probability  that they will be associated in a fresh case in which one of them is  known to be present;    (b) Under the same circumstances, a sufficient number of cases of  association will make the probability of a fresh association nearly a  certainty, and will make it approach certainty without limit.    As just stated, the principle applies only to the verification of our  expectation in a single fresh instance. But we want also to know that  there is a probability in favour of the general law that things of the  sort A are _always_ associated with things of the sort B, provided a  sufficient number of cases of association are known, and no cases of  failure of association are known. The probability of the general law is  obviously less than the probability of the particular case, since if the  general law is true, the particular case must also be true, whereas  the particular case may be true without the general law being true.  Nevertheless the probability of the general law is increased by  repetitions, just as the probability of the particular case is. We may  therefore repeat the two parts of our principle as regards the general  law, thus:    (a) The greater the number of cases in which a thing of the sort A has  been found associated with a thing of the sort B, the more probable it  is (if no cases of failure of association are known) that A is always  associated with B;    b) Under the same circumstances, a sufficient number of cases of the  association of A with B will make it nearly certain that A is always  associated with B, and will make this general law approach certainty  without limit.    It should be noted that probability is always relative to certain data.  In our case, the data are merely the known cases of coexistence of A and  B. There may be other data, which _might_ be taken into account, which  would gravely alter the probability. For example, a man who had seen a  great many white swans might argue, by our principle, that on the  data it was _probable_ that all swans were white, and this might be a  perfectly sound argument. The argument is not disproved by the fact that  some swans are black, because a thing may very well happen in spite of  the fact that some data render it improbable. In the case of the swans,  a man might know that colour is a very variable characteristic in many  species of animals, and that, therefore, an induction as to colour is  peculiarly liable to error. But this knowledge would be a fresh datum,  by no means proving that the probability relatively to our previous data  had been"]]]
