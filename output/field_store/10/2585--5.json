Who is prepared to say that the faithful will not take the  cup of blessing, even in the heavens, and drink wine in our heavenly  Father's kingdom? Who can say that the river of life that proceeds  from the throne of God in the celestial city, shall not be employed to  perpetuate the remembrance of baptismal water of adoption, and even  perpetuate sinless purity, like the leaves of healing that grow on the  banks of the crystal stream?    Is it a thing incredible with you, sir, that God should remit sins  through baptism? It is with difficulty that I can persuade myself that  you are so distrustful of the power or wisdom of God! You read and  expound the scriptures from Sabbath to Sabbath. You certainly believe  that Naaman's leprosy was washed away by water-baptism in Jordan; you  also must believe that men were healed of mortal diseases, by simply  looking at a brazen serpent lifted up in the wilderness. Do you not  believe that the walls of Jericho fell down under the simple blast of  the rams' horns? and that the simple touch of the hem of a garment,  or of handkerchiefs, was attended with healing virtue to them that  believed?    Why were the learned and devout Judaic churches surprised that Peter  should proclaim to thousands--\"be baptized for the _remission_ of your  sins?\" and, on another occasion, even _command_ Cornelius, as pious and  devout a believer as yourself, to be baptized in order that he might  be \"_saved_\"--telling the churches in a general circular epistle, that  baptism would _save_ them as much as water _saved_ Noah? Why should  those same churches withdraw fellowship from Paul because he believed  Annanias, saying to him, \"arise and be baptized and wash away thy  sins,\" even as your church have disfellowshipped me, because I believe  as Paul did, and obey the same gospel which he preached, with all its  miraculous gifts, blessings, and priesthood? The secret and solution of  the whole surprise of the Judaic and modern churches are, that _both_  overlook the efficacious _simplicity_ of Christ's ordinances, and know  not the \"power of God,\" by which a mere look, touch, baptismal rite, or  the imposition of a hand, may secure blessings rich as heaven--power as  great as Gabriel's--knowledge as high as the throne of God--and life  and felicity as endless as eternity!    Greatly blessed, sir, is that man commissioned immediately from the  heavens to administer baptism unto repentance for _remission_ of sins;  and blessed are they who receive remission of sins from the hands of  those who act in \"Christ's stead.\" Hence the grateful acknowledgements  of David, repeated by Paul--\"Blessed are they whose iniquities are  forgiven, whose sins are covered.\" Men who obey the gospel are as well  satisfied that their sins are forgiven through baptism, as you, sir,  would be satisfied of the validity and legality of a deed, signed and  sealed by his excellency the chief magistrate of your State. They  rejoice in the same, without ambiguity or fear of being deceived. The  spirit of bondage and fear (which is in sectarian churches) does no  longer wither up their hope, and blight the joy of their acceptance  with God.    The heavens, that before seem clouded with dismal forebodings and  doubtful omens, that kept the excellent Dr. Payson even, on a  tumultuous sea of mental storms and calms, is now clear and tranquil  all the day and all the year. They rejoice in the Lord ever more;  and they know of a truth, that by keeping the commandments of  God, their peace is like the gentle and ever-onward current of a  river. Driven from \"city to city, and from one nation to another  people;\" and \"every where spoken against,\" belied, robbed, and  arraigned before \"magistrates\" for thefts, treason, blasphemy, &c.,  they are distressed indeed, but not with mental doubts and fears.  No; far from it; they are borne down with expulsion from place to  place--burning their houses--despoiling their goods under shadow of  legal prosecution--whippings--priestly and editorial calumnies! These  things, sir, distress their bodies, and cause cold, and nakedness, and  hunger, and an uncertain dwelling place; but do not by any means impair  their peace in believing, or their joy in the Holy Ghost. None of these  things move them.    Yours,    ORSON SPENCER.        LETTER V.    THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST.    _Liverpool, June_ 29, 1842.    Reverend and Dear Sir,--The subject of my fifth letter is one of  surpassing importance. It is, sir, the \"GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST,\" by the  laying on of hands.    The magnitude of the subject warrants me to say, in few words, what  belongs to it, without those copious scripture references which you  can look after at your leisure. If you will honestly listen to my  description of the office-work of the Holy Ghost, you will clearly  perceive, that, since the time Jesus left the earth, it is more  extensive and important than even the work of the other personages of  the Godhead.    The Holy Ghost performs the double office of a WITNESS on earth and a  RECORDER in heaven. Being an unembodied personage, he can move among  men without the danger of being mobbed and killed, as was not the case  with Jesus Christ. He takes up the work of man's redemption, just where  Jesus Christ left it, and has a distinct part to act until the second  coming of Christ, that in due time He also may obtain glory with the  Father, even as Jesus does--yea, a fulness of the Godhead by himself.    According to promise he came on the day of Pentecost, either with a  retinue of sanctified spirits, or in the simple unity and grandeur of  his own potent agency, and filled the house. He then disbursed among  the disciples a variety of tongues--gifts for men which the Conqueror  had promised. With the keys of revelation, peculiar to his office, he  unlocked their understanding (with perfect impunity to himself) and  bore witness that Jesus was Christ. His testimony not only confirmed  the disciples, who had been previously baptized, beyond the shadow of  all further doubt, but convinced some thousands of the sin of unbelief.    He immediately informed Peter, to whom Christ had promised to send the  keys of the presidency over the church by the Holy Ghost (for he could  do nothing till the Holy Ghost should bring them), that He, the Holy  Ghost, would ever be an attendant upon penitent believers that should  be \"baptized for remission of sins,\" whenever his minister should lay  on hands. He authorized him to make a solemn standing PROMISE to this  effect, viz.: that the Holy Ghost's presence as a WITNESS to truth,  should invariably follow the imposition of hands. But he also gave  him to understand, that none should lay on hands or preach but such  as should be called by revelation, even as was Aaron. He assured him  that he would henceforth abide with the church, and enable obedient  believers to work certain miraculous signs, such as healing the sick,  casting out devils, nullifying the properties of poison wickedly  administered, and speaking with new tongues--and these and other  confirmations of the truth should invariably attend the true church  to the end of the world, or as long as true believers continued on  the earth; and if these miraculous signs did not follow believers,  they might know that they were rejected of God, as reprobate silver is  rejected of men.    The Holy Ghost further informed him, that He was the LIVING WITNESS  on earth, in connexion with the WATER and the BLOOD, and sealed up  the testimony of all the witnesses concerning all believers on earth,  and then took them to heaven and recorded them in the BOOKS, by the  mutual agreement of the Father and the Son, against a time of awards  and punishments. He also informed him that he always obtained a perfect  knowledge of Jesus Christ's mind touching all church transactions  on earth, and faithfully communicated the same to chosen men and  believers, according to their capacity to receive and use such  knowledge; and should continue to act in this Office of enlightening  and comforting the church, \"until they all come to the unity of the  faith and the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ,\" which  he possessed before he left the earth. And he would also communicate  Christ's mind concerning the destinies of nations, and the judgments,  famines, and pestilences, &c., with which Jesus Christ would visit the  earth.    The Holy Ghost would also reveal the deep purposes of God, not only  concerning the future glory of the Church, but also concerning  individuals that lived before the foundations of the world, and what  would be their state in worlds that are future. And even all things  that Jesus Christ knew concerning the interest, salvation, and endless  felicity and glory of the church--and the misery and final undoing of  such as obey not God, the Holy Ghost would communicate in visions,  dreams, and revelations. Thus the earth would be filled with knowledge,  and Christ would again return here with all the departed saints, and  literally bring down a celestial city of splendid mansions--even the  New Jerusalem--and God would once more dwell with men in peace.    Let it be understood, that not only apostles, but all obedient  believers in the primitive age had the gift of the Holy Ghost, and,  consequently, the \"spirit of prophecy.\" \"He that hath the testimony  of Jesus hath the spirit of prophecy.\" How do men have the testimony  of Jesus? I answer, through the agency of the Holy Ghost. Let it  be understood, and marked with INDELIBLE EMPHASIS, that the HOLY  SPIRIT is the GREAT WITNESS on earth--that He, the spirit of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45899"],[0,"Studies of Travel: Italy (#10)"],[1,"rpose, and the wall  of Aurelian was not yet.    The history of Ostia from the ninth century onwards, from the vain  attempt of Gregory the Fourth to turn Ostia into _Gregoriopolis_,  belongs to another, though almost adjacent, site. New Ostia, with its  castle, its cathedral, its gateway, its one or two narrow streets, but  with seemingly hardly a dozen inhabitants, is a sadder sight than old  Ostia, with no inhabitant except the stalwart _custode_, who defends  himself against Ostian air by daily doses of quinine. Yet the castle  of Cardinal Estouteville ranks high among picturesque fortresses; the  cathedral shows a mixture of classical and Gothic detail for which  nothing in Rome prepares us; fragments of ancient work lie around;  the staircase of the bishop's palace, the palace of the first among  cardinals, is rich in ancient inscriptions. But we hasten on to the  older site. There is something specially striking in its half-excavated  state. We tread the ancient pavement, between the ancient houses, of a  street dug out of a cornfield on either side. The wall of Ancus loses  itself in a bank of earth. Here a house, there a temple, is dug out,  leaving just space enough to see it among surrounding blades of corn.  At Pompeii, too, the diggings are not finished; but there one part is  dug, another is not; here we thread our way along what is dug with the  far greater mass of the undug to right and left of us. So far we are  content; the undug may soon be promoted to the state of the dug, and  Mother Earth is a safe keeper of antiquities. It is otherwise with  Father Tiber. When he is close on one side of us, there is, as our  guide truly tells us, no small danger. He once, as Horace witnesses,  set forth to destroy the monuments of Numa at Rome; he is clearly  minded to do the like by the monuments of Numa's grandson at Ostia.          The Alban Mount.      What is the common point of connexion between all the lands and places  which bear the name of Alba, Albania, or something like it? They lie  so far apart, they are inhabited by people of such utterly different  nations and languages, that it is strange if there be any point of  connexion among them, while it is at least as strange if the name has  settled down on so many remote spots by sheer accident only. We must  not forget that our own land has an interest in the question: we dwell  in the Isle of Albion, and its northern part is specially Albanach or  Albany. An English lady living on the eastern shore of the Hadriatic  was lately complimented by a Scotch lady because, being an Albanian,  she spoke such good English. It was afterwards suggested to her that  she might have answered with a _tu quoque_ or something more; the  Englishwoman was no Albanian; the Scotchwoman in a certain sense was.  But have Albanians of either of these kinds anything to do either with  the Duke of Al_v_a--for in his tongue \"non aliud est _v_i_v_ere quam  _b_i_b_ere\"--or with the Albania beyond the Euxine? Then again it is  singular to read, say in Dionysios of Halikarnassos, the local wars of  Rome and Alba Longa described under exactly the same gentile names as  those by which Imperial Anna describes strife between the New Rome and  those Ghegs and Tosks who have again begun to make themselves famous.  It is [Greek: Rhomaioi] and [Greek: Albanoi] in both cases, without  the change of jot or tittle. In this case, at least, we believe that  philologers would deny the slightest kindred between the names; but  the casual identity is thereby only made the more startling. A  malicious critic might say that Anna's Romans were as unlike old  Romans as her Albanians could be unlike the men of Alba Longa. But her  Romans did at least claim to be Romans, sharers in the inheritance of  the wolf and the eagle; while her Albanians certainly laid no claims  to any rights in the Alban sow and her thirty pigs.    Rome, undutiful daughter, swept away her mother city so thoroughly  that its site has become a matter of dispute. But the name lived on in  derivative forms. Alba perished, but the Alban lake and the Alban mount  kept their places, to play no small part in the history of Rome. There  is the lake, there is the great drain for its waters, so strangely  interwoven with the tale of Veii. There is the mount, with the road  by which the chariot of Marcellus went up in triumph; there are still  the displaced stones of the temple which was the religious centre  of the Latin name. But for the fanaticism of the last Stewart, the  pillared front of the Latin Jupiter might still form the proudest of  crowns for the height on which the gazer from the walls of Rome fixes  his eye more commonly than on any other. And, if Alba perished, she  did in a manner rise again. The neighbourhood of dead Alba became as  favourite a quarter for the villas of Roman nobles as the neighbourhood  of living Tusculum. There the great Pompeius had a dwelling; there,  according to one version of his story, his body--or perhaps only his  head--found a stately tomb, though Hadrian could make his verse by the  Alexandrian Shore to say that no tomb had been found for him who had  so many temples. But of all villas on Alban ground, of all _Albana_,  the _Albanum_ of the Emperors, with its spacious gardens, its long  terraces still to be traced, of course came to be the greatest. The  walled station of the Imperial guards, the fellow of the Praetorian  camp at Rome, became the kernel of a new town, and Albano still  exists, an episcopal city, seat of a cardinal-bishop, and it still  keeps its character as a summer retreat for those who, now as of old,  seek to escape the smoke and wealth and noise of lordly Rome. Albano  and Alba stand in somewhat the same relation as Spalato and Salona.  In both cases the new city grew out of an Imperial dwelling-place in  the neighborhood of the old. But there is this wide difference between  them, that Alba has utterly perished, while Salona survives in ample  ruins. Alba had vanished ages and ages before Albano arose. Spalato  stood ready to be a city of refuge for those who fled from Salona in  her day of overthrow.    The town of Albano itself contains a good many antiquities, the most  prominent among which, that which greets the eye on the entrance from  Rome, is the huge tower-like pile, so cruelly stripped of its hewn  stone, which, truly or falsely, passes for the tomb of Cnaeus Pompeius  Magnus. More striking on a close examination, though spoiled in its  effect by a Papal freak of restoration, is the tomb which hovers  between the names of Aruns son of Porsena and the Horatii and Curiatii.  Which of the two would Sir George Lewis have looked on as the more  impossible? This is the tomb which so singularly forestalled the  outline of the Glastonbury kitchen--before its chimneys perished--and  thereby of the Museum laboratory at Oxford. A good deal of the wall of  the camp, a good deal of an amphitheatre on the hill-side, and several  other fragments of the earlier Imperial time, are still to be seen.  But after all Albano really exists, not for its own sake, but as a  starting-point for the Alban lake and the Alban mount, and hardly less  as a starting-point for         ... the still glassy lake that sleeps       Beneath Aricia's trees.    Aricia has changed its site; the small modern town has flown up to  the level of the _arx_, to be approached by Albano by almost the only  work on which we do not grudge to see the name of Pius IX. The viaduct  of that \"Pontifex Optimus Maximus\"--his votaries seem never quite to  distinguish between him and Jupiter--is really a work worthy of Caesars  or consuls. Below it new Aricia has left the elder city, its fragments  of walls and of the Appian Way, to be sought for in the valley below,  the crater, so wise men tell us, of an extinct volcano, the biggest  surely even in this region where craters meet us at every step. Scraps  of primaeval wall, hardly to be distinguished from the rocks, prepare  us for what we are to see at places further out of the ordinary track;  walls of the days of Sulla join on alike to what we have seen at Rome,  and to what we are to see at Cori. But, after all, the \"still glassy  lake\" to which the grove of the \"rex nemorensis\" has given the name of  Nemi, is the true glory of Aricia. How well we remember being puzzled  years and years ago with the thrilling run of the lines--         Those trees in whose dim shadow         The ghastly priest doth reign,       The priest who slew the slayer,         And shall himself be slain.    In these days the fault would be held to lie with the poet for  venturing on an allusion which it might need a little research to take  in. In those days we thought in such cases that the fault lay with  ourselves; we admired without understanding till we lighted on the  explanation which enabled us to understand as well. As such a process  is a wholesome one, we will leave the lines without comment; not to  speak of books of reference, the story will be found, in a somewhat  grotesque form, in Dr. Merivale's chapter on the reign of Caius, better  known as Caligula.    The ghastly priest has gone from Nemi; but the lake is there still,  and the successors of the trees. Access is courteously granted by  the present owner, who, we may believe, has never slain anybody, and  who, we hope, may not be slain himself. But though we may admire Nemi  from close by, we do not fully understand Nemi and its place among  things, till we can look upon it in company with its greater fellow  of Alba. That is, we must climb the Alban mount, or a good part of  its height. But we go first to the Alban lake itself; and to do so  we go along its rim and slide down the side of its crater. There we  find the _emissarius_, so deftly cut in the rock, and which has done  its work so well for so many ages. Who made it? Camillus, or some  one long before Camillus?
