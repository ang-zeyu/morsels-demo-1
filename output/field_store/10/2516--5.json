Slanting vertical lines on         each chart designate midnight (2400 Hrs.) of each day.]    Nights of high trapping success usually were associated with days having  solar insolation below the average. Insolation was measured with a  recording pyrheliometer at a regional weather station (M-2) on the  middle of Chapin Mesa, at an elevation of 7,150 feet (Erdman, Douglas,  and Marr, in press). This station was approximately one mile south of  the trapping grid; isolation at this site would have been essentially  the same as that received by the trapping grid. Below-average isolation  for one day indicates cloudy conditions, which are accompanied by  increased humidity, but may or may not be accompanied by precipitation.  Trapping on nights preceded and followed by days of average or above  average isolation with average humidities--indicative of clear days and  clear moonlit nights--did not yield appreciably higher catches of mice  than other nights. Hence there was no evidence that mice tended to  avoid, or to seek out, traps on clear moonlit nights.    On cold, humid nights in autumn numerous mice caught in Sherman live  traps succumbed from exposure, even though nesting material (kapok or  cotton) and food were in the traps. Occasionally mice succumbed to heat  when traps were inadvertently exposed to too much sunlight. Apparently  little heat is required to kill individuals of either species. Traps in  which animals died due to excessive heat usually were not hot to the  touch; in most instances the traps were checked before 9:00 A. M.,  several hours before the sun caused maximum heating. Such individuals  may have licked the fur of their chests in an attempt to lower their  body temperatures. Although mice characteristically salivate before  succumbing from heat, these individuals had moist fur over the entire  chest and upper parts of the front legs, indicating licking. Mice killed  by exposure to heat or cold usually were juveniles or young; subadult  and adult individuals of both species were more tolerant. Older animals  would be expected to have better homeostatic controls than younger  individuals.          HABITAT PREFERENCE      In Mesa Verde _P. truei_ and _P. maniculatus_ occur together only at the  fringes of the pinyon-juniper woodland, where ecotonal areas provide  less than optimum habitats for both species. Almost all individuals of  _P. truei_ occur only in pinyon-juniper woodland, whereas _P.  maniculatus_ occurs only in more open habitats, such as grassy meadows  and stands of sagebrush.    Pinyon mice were abundant in a variety of associations within the  pinyon-juniper woodland. The highest population densities were in  pinyon-juniper woodland having an understory of mixed shrubs. In such an  association, _Poa fendleriana_ usually is the dominant grass in the  ground cover. _P. truei_ was especially abundant along brushy slopes  where mixed shrubs (_Amelanchier_, _Cercocarpos_ and _Fendlera_) were  codominant with pinyon pines and Utah junipers. The pinyon-juniper-mixed  shrub area west of Far View Ruins was almost optimum habitat for _P.  truei_.    _P. truei_ was abundant on the rocky ridge of Wetherill Mesa near Mug  House; the pinyon-juniper woodland here has a _Cercocarpos_ understory,  and appears to provide close to optimum conditions for this species.    Not all associations of the pinyon-juniper woodland support large  numbers of _P. truei_. Pinyon-juniper woodland having a ground cover of  _Poa fendleriana_, and no shrubs, supports few mice; the woodland on  Wetherill Mesa near Long House is an example. Juniper-pinyon woodland  having a _Purshia tridentata_ understory also supports only a few mice.  Such areas occur on the southern ends of the mesas and are  characterized by widely-spaced trees and little ground cover--a  reflection of the relatively low amounts of precipitation received by  the southern end of the park.    _P. truei_ was not found in grasslands on Navajo Hill, or in meadows at  the southern end of Moccasin Mesa. The old burned areas on the northern  end of Wetherill Mesa and on Morfield Ridge now support numerous grasses  and shrubs, but _P. truei_ appears not to live there.    _P. truei_ tends to avoid stands of sagebrush, or grasslands, lacking  pinyon or juniper trees. _P. truei_ may venture into such areas while  feeding. This species is found in thickets of Gambel oak and in areas  with an overstory of mixed shrubs only when a living pinyon-juniper  canopy is present, or when a woodland adjoins these areas.    Rocky terrain apparently is not a requirement for _P. truei_, since much  of the pinyon-juniper woodland that is free of rocks supports large  numbers. Optimum habitat, however, had a rocky floor. In such places,  rocks probably are of secondary importance, whereas the shrubs and other  plants growing on rocky soils are important for food and cover. Rocks  likely provide additional nesting sites, and allow a larger population  to live in an area than might otherwise be possible.    In Mesa Verde the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, prefers open areas  having dense stands of grasses, or brushy areas adjoining open terrain.  This species lives in stands of big sagebrush; in grassy areas having an  oak-chaparral or mixed-shrub-overstory; and in grasslands without  shrubs, such as on the southern end of Moccasin Mesa. Pure stands of  sagebrush did not support large numbers of mice unless there was  additional cover nearby in the form of shrubs or oak brush.    Optimum habitats for _P. maniculatus_ were on Navajo Hill, in the burned  areas on Morfield Ridge, on the northern end of Wetherill Mesa, and in  the grassy areas near the entrance of the park. The trapping areas in  the first three mentioned had heavy growths of grass and an overstory of  shrubs.    Some individuals of _P. maniculatus_ ventured into pinyon-juniper  woodland and entered traps. Such animals usually were found in places  having a heavy understory of sagebrush, or in disturbed places within  the woodland.    _P. maniculatus_, but not _P. truei_, was taken in the arid  pinyon-juniper-bitterbrush stand on the southern end of Wetherill Mesa.  _P. maniculatus_ also was present, in about equal numbers with _P.  truei_, in a pinyon-juniper-muttongrass stand north of Long House. Both  of these localities supported only a few mice.    _P. maniculatus_ is found more frequently in pinyon-juniper woodland  when the population density is high, and when such woodlands adjoin  grasslands or sagebrush areas. As mentioned earlier, _P. truei_ and _P.  maniculatus_ occur together in ecotonal areas between the forest and  grassy or brushy areas. In Mesa Verde the deer mouse inhabits exposed  grassy areas that have mostly shrubs in the open canopy.    _P. maniculatus_ is the first to colonize areas that have been burned;  this species invades such areas as soon as primary successional  vegetation becomes established. It can be stated that in general, _P.  maniculatus_ will be found in the harsher, more arid habitats. If the  habitat is so inhospitable that only a few mice can survive there, _P.  maniculatus_ will be present. _P. truei_ apparently requires the more  moderate conditions found in the pinyon-juniper forest, and this species  does not venture far from the edge of the forest.          NESTING AND NEST CONSTRUCTION      Ten individuals of _P. truei_ and three of _P. maniculatus_ were  followed to their nesting places. Photographs were taken of the nesting  sites before and after uncovering. Plants or other materials used in  their construction and any commensal arthropods present were saved and  later identified.    Nests of _P. truei_ usually were associated with juniper trees. Dead  branches and trunks of juniper trees decay from the inside, and the  resulting hollows are favored sites for the nests. Pinyon pine trees  tend to decay from the outside and were not used as nesting sites by _P.  truei_. Nests of _P. truei_ were found in hollow trunks and branches of  otherwise healthy juniper trees, and in hollow logs lying on the ground.  The heartwood apparently rots rapidly in juniper trees, but the sapwood  remains intact for many years--even after the tree is lying on the  ground. For example, a part of the pinyon-juniper woodland on the  southern end of Chapin Mesa was burned in 1858, and the hollow trunks of  junipers were still standing in 1966. Almost all of the pinyon pine  trees that were killed by that fire have since decayed; their former  presence is verified only by the crumbling remnants of their trunks that  lie on the ground throughout the burned area.    The following accounts illustrate the preferences of the two species of  mice in selection of nesting sites:    No. 105, _P. truei_, adult. On July 22, 1964, after being released from  a trap, this female ran to a serviceberry bush 10 feet south of station  I4d, preened herself, ate a berry from the bush, and disappeared under a  large rock at the base of the bush. Subsequent excavation revealed a  large nest composed of grasses (_Poa fendleriana_, _Sitanion"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38961"],[0,"Narrative of the surveying voyages of His Majesty's ships Adventure and Beagle, (#10)"],[1,"hundred men, under  Sarmiento. A city was marked out, and named Jesus,[28] in a valley well  provided with water. The {31} ships were blown away to sea, leaving the  colonists very destitute; fortunately, however, they were enabled to  return, but were four times, afterwards, obliged to put to sea, from stress  of weather. On the last return, one of the ships, La Trinidad, was run on  shore. The ardour of Ribera being damped by repeated misfortunes, he  returned to Spain, without the knowledge or consent of Sarmiento, leaving,  for the use of the colony, only one ship, the Maria.    While unloading the Trinidad, the Spaniards were attacked by Indians, whom  they dispersed.    Sarmiento, after making the necessary arrangements at Jesus, set out by  land with one hundred men, to go to Point St. Anna,[29] the ship Maria  being ordered to follow. On the journey, the sufferings of the party were  very great, as well from the fatiguing nature of the march, as from their  being harassed by the natives, with whom they had an engagement, in which  one was killed, and ten men were wounded. A mutiny among his people then  broke out, which was quelled by assistance from the ship. At last they  reached their destination, and founded, with the usual solemnities, the  city of King Philip (or San Felipe).    At the latter end of March, while preparing habitations, the winter set in  so suddenly, that for fifteen days it did not cease to snow. Sarmiento,  then, after quelling a mutiny which had broken out afresh among the  soldiers, embarked with thirty men to visit the first encampment at Jesus,  and to superintend the erection of forts in the Narrow; but upon reaching  the anchorage, a gale of wind forced him to sea, and, lasting twenty days,  obliged him (with his people blinded and frost-bitten) to bear up for Rio  de Janeiro.    Here his ship was stranded; upon which he chartered a vessel to convey  flour to the Strait, and went himself to Pernambuco, to procure large boats  for carrying supplies to his {32} colony, and assisting in the recovery of  his stranded ship; she had, however, drifted off, and sunk near Bahia; and  all his boats were destroyed. Still Sarmiento persevered in his zealous  efforts to succour his friends in the Strait; and succeeded in procuring a  vessel of fifty or sixty tons, which, loaded with arms and whatever he  considered useful, sailed, and reached Rio de Janeiro a month after the  departure of the first vessel (January 1585). He followed, but in the  latitude of 39deg met with a furious gale, which drove him back to Rio de  Janeiro, where the vessel that had preceded him had returned in distress.    Disappointed in his attempts to carry succour to the colony, he determined  to go to Spain; but on his voyage thither, to complete the catalogue of his  misfortunes, his ship was captured by three English vessels, and taken to  England, after which the ill-fated colony in the Strait was neglected, if  not entirely forgotten.    Two months after Sarmiento's departure from the Strait of Magalhaens, in  the month of August, the middle of the winter of that region, the party  belonging to the first establishment at Jesus set off by land, and joined  that at San Felipe, with the unwelcome tidings of their deserted state. But  as the provisions at San Felipe were insufficient to support all the  people, Andres de Viedma, who, after Sarmiento's departure, had assumed the  command, detached two hundred soldiers, under the command of Juan Iniguez,  back to Jesus, for the purpose of communicating with any ship that might  make her appearance, and awaiting the expected return of Sarmiento; but the  winter and following summer passed by without any relief.    In this unhappy state, the colonists were obliged to think only of  providing for their safety, and built two boats; in which fifty people  embarked, besides Viedma, Suarez, a Franciscan friar named Antonio, and  five Spanish women. They had not proceeded farther than Point Santa  Brigida,[30] {33} when one of the boats struck upon a reef, and was lost,  but the people were saved. The loss of this boat caused them to give up  every hope of saving themselves in that way; and Viedma, with Suarez, the  friar, and twenty soldiers, returned in the remaining boat to San Felipe,  leaving the rest of the party, consisting of thirty men and five women, to  support themselves through the approaching winter as they could. After that  season had passed, Viedma sent to collect the wanderers; but fifteen men,  and three women only, could be found; the rest having died of hunger and  disease. The survivors then determined upon going to the first  establishment at Jesus; on their way to which they passed by the skeletons  of the two hundred who had been first detached. Travelling onwards, they  observed three ships entering the strait, which anchored at a distance to  the southward.    During the night, Viedma and his companions kept up large fires, supposing  that the ships belonged to their own nation. Next morning a boat was  despatched from them; and three of Viedma's party obtained permission to go  and reconnoitre her. Having approached near enough, a signal was made; upon  which, the people in the boat pulled towards the beach, and said they were  from England, bound to Peru, and that if the Spaniards wanted a passage,  they had better embark. After some hesitation, arising from the fear of  trusting themselves in the power of heretics, they consented; and one was  permitted to get in, but the other two were left on the beach. In the boat  was the enterprizing Cavendish[31] himself, who, on hearing the particulars  of their story, sent the other two soldiers to Viedma, offering to take him  and the residue of his people on board. Cavendish returned to his ship;  but, without further delay, sailed on to the Isla dos Patos (Santa  Magdalena Island), where he leisurely salted down six casks of penguins;  and then proceeded to San Felipe, for wood and water; he remained there  four days (during which time he destroyed the houses of the Spaniards, and  embarked six guns); and thence continued his voyage. The person saved {34}  by Cavendish, whose name was Tome Hernandez, afterwards escaped from him at  Quintero, near Valparaiso; and, proceeding to Peru, gave an account of the  fate of this cruelly neglected colony.    This was the first, and perhaps will be the last, attempt made to occupy a  country, offering no encouragement for a human being; a region, where the  soil is swampy, cold, and unfit for cultivation, and whose climate is  thoroughly cheerless.    The name, San Felipe, ceased with the colony; for Cavendish called it Port  Famine, in allusion to the fate of the colonists, all of whom, except the  man he took away, and one saved two years afterwards (in 1589), by Andrew  Mericke,[32] perished from hunger and its attendant diseases; and by this  appellation the bay has since been universally known. To commemorate the  ill-fated town, a very thickly-wooded mountain at the bottom of the bay,  which forms a conspicuous and picturesque object, has been named by us  Mount San Felipe.    At this port, Sarmiento, on his first voyage through the Strait,  communicated with a large party of Indians, in consequence of which he  called it Bahia de la Gente; and the river, which now bears the name of  Sedger, he named San Juan. Of this river Sarmiento took formal possession,  as well as of the whole Strait, for the 'Mui Poderoso y mui Catolico Senor  Phelipe Segundo,' &c. &c. It was also here that, in consequence of the  miraculous preservation of his vessel on many {35} occasions, he attempted  to change the name of the strait to Estrecho de la Madre de Dios; but it  had been too long called Magalhaens, for even the influence of Sarmiento,  backed by the power of Philip, to persuade the world to countenance so  great an injustice.     \"Magallanes, Senor, fue el primer hombre    Que abriendo este camino le dio nombre.\"                        Ercilla Araucana, Cant. I. oct. 8.    During an excursion with Mr. Tarn to Eagle Bay,[33] beyond Cape San Isidro,  we found many wigwams. They were then novelties to us, and we were ignorant  of their being such certain indications of very sheltered places, as  subsequent experience has shown them to be. We often used them, after they  had been well cleaned out: a boat's sail, thrown over the hemispherical  roof, was a sufficient protection from rain;--and from wind they are always  well defended by their situation. Here we saw, for the first time, that  most remarkable bird the Steamer-duck. Before steam-boats were in general  use, this bird was denominated, from its swiftness in skimming over the  surface of the water, the 'race-horse,' a name which occurs frequently in  Cook's, Byron's, and other voyages. It is a gigantic duck, the largest I  have met with. It has the lobated hind-toe, legs placed far backwards, and  other characteristics of the oceanic ducks.[34] The principal peculiarity  of this bird is, the shortness and remarkably small size of the wings,  which, not having sufficient power to raise the body, serve only to propel  it along, rather than through the water, and are used like the paddles of a  steam-vessel. Aided by these and its strong, broad-webbed feet, it moves  with astonishing velocity. {36} It would not be an exaggeration to state  its speed at from twelve to fifteen miles an hour. The peculiar form of the  wing, and the short rigid feathers which cover it, together with the power  this bird possesses of remaining a considerable length of time under water,  constitute it a striking link between the genera _Anas_ and _Aptenodytes_.  It has been noticed by many former navigators. The largest we found  measured forty inches, from the extremity of the bill, to that of the tail,  and weighed thirteen pounds; but Captain Cook mentions, in his second  voyage, that the weight of one was twenty-nine"]]]
