Armenian  leaders remain preoccupied by the long conflict with Azerbaijan over  Nagorno-Karabakh, a primarily Armenian-populated region, assigned to  Soviet Azerbaijan in the 1920s by Moscow. Armenia and Azerbaijan began  fighting over the area in 1988; the struggle escalated after both  countries attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By  May 1994, when a cease-fire took hold, Armenian forces held not  only Nagorno-Karabakh but also a significant portion of Azerbaijan  proper. The economies of both sides have been hurt by their inability  to make substantial progress toward a peaceful resolution.

Since the implosion of the  USSR in December 1991, Armenia has switched to small-scale agriculture  away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet era. The  agricultural sector has long-term needs for more investment and updated  technology. The privatization of industry has been at a slower pace, but  has been given renewed emphasis by the current administration. Armenia  is a food importer, and its mineral deposits (gold, bauxite) are small.  The ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated  region of Nagorno-Karabakh and the breakup of the centrally directed  economic system of the former Soviet Union contributed to a severe  economic decline in the early 1990s. By 1994, however, the Armenian  Government had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic program  that has resulted in positive growth rates in 1995-2001. Armenia also  managed to slash inflation and to privatize most small- and medium-sized  enterprises.

Lest the car should not roll fast  enough, the agents of these companies, known by their long fox-tails and  their cunning looks, turn round the spokes of the wheels, upon which are  marked the names of the several stocks, and their value, sometimes high  and sometimes low, according to the turns of the wheel. Upon the ground  are the merchandise, day-books and ledgers of legitimate commerce,  crushed under the chariot of Folly. Behind is an immense crowd of  persons, of all ages, sexes, and conditions, clamoring after Fortune,  and fighting with each other to get a portion of the shares which she  distributes so bountifully among them. In the clouds sits a demon,  blowing bubbles of soap, which are also the objects of the admiration  and cupidity of the crowd, who jump upon one another's backs to reach  them ere they burst. Right in the pathway of the car, and blocking up  the passage, stands a large building, with three doors, through one of  which it must pass, if it proceeds further, and all the crowd along  with it. Over the first door are the words, \"Hopital des Foux,\" over the  second, \"Hopital des Malades,\" and over the third, \"Hopital des Gueux.\"  Another caricature represented Law sitting in a large cauldron,  boiling over the flames of popular madness, surrounded by an impetuous  multitude, who were pouring all their gold and silver into it, and  receiving gladly in exchange the bits of paper which he distributed  among them by handsfull.    While this excitement lasted, Law took good care not to expose himself  unguarded in the streets. Shut up in the apartments of the Regent, he  was secure from all attack, and, whenever he ventured abroad, it was  either incognito, or in one of the Royal carriages, with a powerful  escort. An amusing anecdote is recorded of the detestation in which he  was held by the people, and the ill treatment he would have met, had  he fallen into their hands. A gentleman, of the name of Boursel, was  passing in his carriage down the Rue St. Antoine, when his further  progress was stayed by a hackneycoach that had blocked up the road. M.  Boursel's servant called impatiently to the hackneycoachman to get out  of the way, and, on his refusal, struck him a blow on the face. A crowd  was soon drawn together by the disturbance, and M. Boursel got out of  the carriage to restore order. The hackney-coachman, imagining that he  had now another assailant, bethought him of an expedient to rid himself  of both, and called out as loudly as he was able, \"Help! help! murder!  murder! Here are Law and his servant going to kill me! Help! help!\"  At this cry, the people came out of their shops, armed with sticks  and other weapons, while the mob gathered stones to inflict summary  vengeance upon the supposed financier. Happily for M. Boursel and his  servant, the door of the church of the Jesuits stood wide open, and,  seeing the fearful odds against them, they rushed towards it with all  speed. They reached the altar, pursued by the people, and would have  been ill treated even there, if, finding the door open leading to the  sacristy, they had not sprang through, and closed it after them. The  mob were then persuaded to leave the church by the alarmed and indignant  priests; and, finding M. Boursel's carriage still in the streets, they  vented their ill-will against it, and did it considerable damage.    The twenty-five millions secured on the municipal revenues of the city  of Paris, bearing so low an interest as two and a half per cent., were  not very popular among the large holders of Mississippi stock. The  conversion of the securities was, therefore, a work of considerable  difficulty; for many preferred to retain the falling paper of Law's  Company, in the hope that a favourable turn might take place. On the  15th of August, with a view to hasten the conversion, an edict was  passed, declaring that all notes for sums between one thousand and ten  thousand livres; should not pass current, except for the purchase of  annuities and bank accounts, or for the payment of instalments still due  on the shares of the company.    In October following another edict was passed, depriving these notes  of all value whatever after the month of November next ensuing. The  management of the mint, the farming of the revenue, and all the other  advantages and privileges of the India, or Mississippi Company, were  taken from them, and they were reduced to a mere private company. This  was the deathblow to the whole system, which had now got into the hands  of its enemies. Law had lost all influence in the Council of Finance,  and the company, being despoiled of its immunities, could no longer hold  out the shadow of a prospect of being able to fulfil its engagements.  All those suspected of illegal profits at the time the public delusion  was at its height, were sought out and amerced in heavy fines. It was  previously ordered that a list of the original proprietors should be  made out, and that such persons as still retained their shares should  place them in deposit with the company, and that those who had neglected  to complete the shares for which they had put down their names, should  now purchase them of the company, at the rate of 13,500 livres for each  share of 500 livres. Rather than submit to pay this enormous sum for  stock which was actually at a discount, the shareholders packed up all  their portable effects, and endeavoured to find a refuge in foreign  countries. Orders were immediately issued to the authorities at the  ports and frontiers, to apprehend all travellers who sought to leave the  kingdom, and keep them in custody, until it was ascertained whether  they had any plate or jewellery with them, or were concerned in the late  stock-jobbing. Against such few as escaped, the punishment of death was  recorded, while the most arbitrary proceedings were instituted against  those who remained.    Law himself, in a moment of despair, determined to leave a country where  his life was no longer secure. He at first only demanded permission to  retire from Paris to one of his country-seats; a permission which the  Regent cheerfully granted. The latter was much affected at the unhappy  turn affairs had taken, but his faith continued unmoved in the truth  and efficacy of Law's financial system. His eyes were opened to his own  errors, and during the few remaining years of his life, he constantly  longed for an opportunity of again establishing the system upon a  securer basis. At Law's last interview with the Prince, he is reported  to have said--\"I confess that I have committed many faults; I committed  them because I am a man, and all men are liable to error; but I  declare to you most solemnly that none of them proceeded from wicked  or dishonest motives, and that nothing of the kind will be found in the  whole course of my conduct.\"    Two or three days after his departure the Regent sent him a very kind  letter, permitting him to leave the kingdom whenever he pleased, and  stating that he had ordered his passports to be made ready. He at  the same time offered him any sum of money he might require. Law  respectfully declined the money, and set out for Brussels in a  postchaise belonging to Madame de Prie, the mistress of the Duke of  Bourbon, escorted by six horse-guards. From thence he proceeded to  Venice, where he remained for some months, the object of the greatest  curiosity to the people, who believed him to be the possessor of  enormous wealth. No opinion, however, could be more erroneous. With  more generosity than could have been expected from a man who during the  greatest part of his life had been a professed gambler, he had refused  to enrich himself at the expense of a ruined nation. During the height  of the popular frenzy for Mississippi stock, he had never doubted of  the final success of his projects, in making France the richest and most  powerful nation of Europe. He invested all his gains in the purchase  of landed property in France--a sure proof of his own belief in the  stability of his schemes. He had hoarded no plate or jewellery, and sent  no money, like the dishonest jobbers, to foreign countries. His all,  with the exception of one diamond, worth about five or six thousand  pounds sterling, was invested in the French soil; and when he left that  country, he left it almost a beggar. This fact alone ought to rescue  his memory from the charge of knavery, so often and so unjustly brought  against him.    As soon as his departure was known, all his estates and his valuable  library were confiscated. Among the rest, an annuity of 200,000 livres,  (8000 pounds sterling,) on the lives of his wife and children, which  had been purchased for five millions of livres, was forfeited,  notwithstanding that a special edict, drawn up for the purpose in the  days of his prosperity, had expressly declared that it should never be  confiscated for any cause whatever. Great discontent existed among the  people that Law had been suffered to escape. The mob and the Parliament  would have been pleased to have seen him hanged. The few who had not  suffered by the commercial revolution, rejoiced that the quack had  left the country; but all those (and they were by far the most numerous  class) whose fortunes were implicated, regretted that his intimate  knowledge of the distress of the country, and of the causes that had led  to it, had not been rendered more available in discovering a remedy.    At a meeting of the Council of Finance, and the general council of the  Regency, documents were laid upon the table, from which it appeared that  the amount of notes in circulation was 2700 millions. The Regent was  called upon to explain how it happened that there was a discrepancy  between the dates at which these issues "]]]
