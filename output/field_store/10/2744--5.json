She had a selection of good slides  showing many different countries, and when her pupils were somewhat  accustomed to these she would test their knowledge by exhibiting one and  asking them where it was, whether in a hot or cold country, what kind of  people lived in such a place, what fruits, flowers, and animals would be  found there, and for what reasons British traders went to it. If the  girls made mistakes she would show them again the particular slides  relating to the place, explaining where they had been wrong, and taking  them, by means of the eye, on a short foreign tour.    \"Imagine you're there and you'll feel quite travellers!\" she would say.  \"Now on this slide you notice a little pathway up the hill among some  trees. If you could walk up that path what would you be likely to find?  What language would the people, whom you met, speak? And how would they  be dressed?\"    Geography on these lines became very attractive, and, as in the case of  the history lessons, the girls eagerly looked out all kinds of points in  books of reference so as to come to class armed with information about  the birds, flowers, or native customs of some particular country. By  visualising the place, imagining themselves to be there, and relating all  they saw, they created such vivid mental pictures that they could almost  believe they had spent the hour really in Africa or South America, as the  case might be.    \"You'd know what clothes to take with you to India or Canada at any  rate,\" said Miss Mitchell, \"and what sort of a life you must be prepared  to live there. Before the term is over I think you'll realise what  British women are doing all over the globe. Climatic conditions have an  immense effect upon people and ought to be properly understood. The  knowledge of these is the foundation of the brotherhood of races.\"    It was not only in history and geography that Miss Mitchell made  innovations. French also was to be on a different method. It had always  been a successful subject at 'The Moorings,' though it had developed  along old-fashioned lines. Mademoiselle Chavasse, however, had left, and  the new Mademoiselle came from a very up-to-date School of Languages in  London. She taught largely by the oral system, making her pupils repeat  words and build them into sentences, like babies learning to talk. She  used English as little as possible, trying to make them catch ideas in  French without the medium of translation. Thus, in a beginners' class she  would hold up a book and say, \"le livre,\" then placing it _on_ the  table or _under_ the table would extend her sentence to show the use  of the prepositions. The girls soon began to grasp the method, and learnt  to reply in French to simple questions asked them, and were given by  degrees a larger vocabulary and encouraged to try to express themselves,  however imperfectly, in the foreign tongue. She also instituted French  games, and set the whole school singing, \"Qui passe ce chemin si tard?\"  or \"Sur le pont d'Avignon,\" while several of the Fifth form who could  write letters in French were put into correspondence with schoolgirls in  France.    Miss Pollard and Miss Fanny, who had gasped a little at some of the  drastic changes, were pleased with the improvement in the teaching of  French, and still more so with the innovations with regard to music. This  had been a very special subject at St. Cyprian's College, where Miss  Mitchell had been educated, and she was anxious to introduce some of the  leading features. Her theory was that most girls learn to play the piano,  a few practise the violin, but hardly any are taught to understand and  appreciate music, apart from their own often unskilful performances. She  arranged, therefore, to hold a weekly class at which a short lecture  would be given on the works of some famous composers, with musical  illustrations. A few of the selections could be played by the pupils  themselves or by Miss Fanny, and others could be rendered by a  gramophone. The main object was to make the girls familiar with the best  compositions and cultivate their musical taste.    \"Constant listening is the only way to learn appreciation,\" said Miss  Mitchell. \"You form a taste for literature by reading the best authors,  not by trying to write poetry yourself! Learning an instrument is a good  training, but certainly only a part of music--to understand it and  criticise it is quite another matter.\"    So all the school, including even the little girls, met to listen to the  masterpieces of Beethoven, Chopin, or Schubert, and were encouraged to  note particular points and to discuss them intelligently.    \"At the end of the term,\" said Miss Mitchell, \"we'll have a concert, just  among ourselves, and then I hope some of you will surprise me. You must  all practise hard, because it will be a great honour to be asked to play  on that particular afternoon.\"    In revising the curriculum of 'The Moorings' upon these very modern  lines, Miss Mitchell did not neglect the athletic side. The school did  not yet possess a gymnasium, but there were classes for drill and  calisthenics, and games were compulsory.    \"A good thing too!\" commented Merle. \"Some of the girls are fearful  slackers! They've never been accustomed to stir themselves. Maude Carey  hardly knows how to run. I believe she thinks it's unladylike! And Nesta  would shirk if she could. Those kids need a fearful amount of coaching. I  shall have my work cut out with them.\"    Merle, owing to her enthusiasm for sports, had been chosen as Games  Captain, and was doing her best to cultivate a proper enthusiasm for  hockey in the school. In this matter she had the full co-operation of the  new mistress. Merle liked Miss Mitchell, whose cheery, breezy, practical  ways particularly appealed to her. Merle was not given to violent  affections, especially for teachers, so this attraction was almost a  matter of first love. She, who had never minded blame at school, found  herself caring tremendously for praise in class. It raised the standard  of her work enormously. She could do very well if she tried. She had  always poked fun at girls who took much trouble over home lessons, and  had been accustomed to leave her own till the last possible moment. It  was certainly a new phase to find her getting out her books immediately  after tea, or practising for half an hour before breakfast. She was ready  to do anything to win notice from Miss Mitchell, and was decidedly  jealous that Iva and Nesta, being boarders, were able to see more of her,  and thus establish a greater intimacy. Merle always wanted to 'go one  better' than the other monitresses. The status of all four was exactly  equal, and so far there was no head girl at 'The Moorings.' Merle had  indeed taken a most prominent part at the general meeting of the school,  but though she might be the unacknowledged leader, that gave her no  increased authority. Sometimes her excess of zeal led to ructions. Miss  Mitchell had strongly urged the necessity of improving the games, and  particularly of training the juniors to play hockey properly. Merle  seized upon them at every opportunity and made them practise. One  afternoon, as everybody filed out at four o'clock, she captured her  recruits and began some instruction. But unfortunately it happened that  Winnie and Joyce, who were her aptest pupils, were wanted by Nesta for  schemes of her own, and she came and called them in.    \"Can't spare them now!\" objected Merle briefly.    \"Sorry! But they'll have to come!\"    \"Not if their Games Captain wants them!\"    \"I'm their hostel monitress!\"    \"Miss Mitchell asked me to see to the hockey!\"    \"Then you must get day-girls to stay for your practice. I've instructions  to see that all the boarders come straight back to the hostel after  school!\"    Merle gave way with a very bad grace. She felt that Nesta was interfering  out of sheer officiousness.    \"What a jack-in-office!\" she grumbled under her breath. \"I believe those  boarders may do anything they like until tea-time. Nesta needn't plume  herself upon being prime favourite with Miss Mitchell. She may whisk  Joyce and Winnie off now and spoil our practice, but I'll be even with  her in some other way!\"    In talking about the various school institutions, Miss Mitchell mentioned  one day that there ought to be a general record of the various societies  and their officers, and the work which they had undertaken to do.    \"It should be kept in the study so as to be available any time for  reference,\" she said. \"It would be a far simpler method than having to  ask the secretaries for particulars.\"    This gave Merle an idea. She said nothing to her fellow-monitresses, but  she at once began to compile the list which Miss Mitchell wanted. She was  determined to do it beautifully. Her handwriting was not remarkably good,  so she decided to type it. There was a little typewriter in Uncle David's  consulting-room, which he allowed her to use, and though she was so far  from being an adept at it that it actually took her longer than using pen  and ink, she thought the result would justify the trouble. She meant to  stitch the sheets together and fasten them inside a cardboard cover,  decorated with an artistic design. She set to work upon it with much  energy and enthusiasm.    She was leaving school one afternoon when Muriel Burnitt ran up to her.    \"By the by, Merle! Can you give me the names of the committee of the  Nature Club? I can't just remember them all.\"    \"What d'you want them for?\" asked Merle suspiciously.    \"Oh, to write out for Miss Mitchell! She was asking for a list the other  day.\"    \"Fay Macleod is secretary of the Nature Club. She'd be able to tell you  exactly,\" temporised Merle.    \"So she would! I'll ask her to-morrow.\"    Merle went home with her head in a whirl. It was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7836"],[0,"Jewish History : An Essay in the Philosophy of History (#10)"],[1,"intermingling of Greek philosophy with Jewish religious conceptions  resulted in a new religio-philosophic doctrine, with a mystic tinge,  of which Philo is the chief exponent. In Jerusalem, Judaism appeared  as a system of practical ceremonies and moral principles; in  Alexandria, it presented itself as a complex of abstract symbols and  poetical allegories. The Alexandrian form of Judaism might satisfy the  intellect, but it could not appeal to the feelings. It may have made  Judaism accessible to the cultivated minority, to the upper ten  thousand with philosophic training; for the masses of the heathen  people Judaism continued unintelligible. Yet it was pre-eminently the  masses that were strongly possessed by religious craving. Disappointed  in their old beliefs, they panted after a new belief, after spiritual  enlightenment. In the decaying classical world, which had so long  filled out life with materialistic and intellectual interests, the  moral and religious feelings, the desire for a living faith, for an  active inspiration, had awakened, and was growing with irresistible  force.    Then, from deep out of the bosom of Judaism, there sprang a moral,  religious doctrine destined to allay the burning thirst for religion,  and bring about a reorganization of the heathen world. The originators  of Christianity stood wholly upon the ground of Judaism. In their  teachings were reflected as well the lofty moral principles of the  Pharisee leader as the contemplative aims of the Essenes. But the same  external circumstances that had put Judaism under the necessity of  choosing a sharply-defined practical, national policy, made it  impossible for Judaism to fraternize with the preachers of the new  doctrine. Judaism, in fact, was compelled to put aside entirely the  thought of universal missionary activity. Instead, it had to devote  its powers to the more pressing task of guarding the spiritual unity  of a nation whose political bonds were visibly dropping away.    For just then the Jewish nation, gory with its own blood, was  struggling in the talons of the Roman eagle. Its sons fought  heroically, without thought of self. When, finally, physical strength  gave out, their spiritual energy rose to an intenser degree. The state  was annihilated, the nation remained alive. At the very moment when  the Temple was enwrapped in flames, and the Roman legions flooded  Jerusalem, the spiritual leaders of Jewry sat musing, busily casting  about for a means whereby, without a state, without a capital, without  a Temple, Jewish unity might be maintained. And they solved the  difficult problem.          VII    THE TERTIARY TALMUDIC OR NATIONAL-RELIGIOUS PERIOD      The solution of the problem consisted chiefly in more strictly  following out the process of isolation. In a time in which the worship  of God preached by Judaism was rapidly spreading to all parts of the  classical world, and the fundamental principles of the Jewish religion  were steadily gaining appreciation and active adherence, this intense  desire for seclusion may at first glance seem curious. But the  phenomenon is perfectly simple. A foremost factor was national  feeling, enhanced to a tremendous degree at the time of the  destruction of Jerusalem. Lacking a political basis, it was  transferred to religious soil. Every tradition, every custom, however  insignificant, was cherished as a jewel. Though without a state and  without territory, the Jews desired to form a nation, if only a  spiritual nation, complete in itself. They considered themselves then  as before the sole guardians of the law of God. They did not believe  in a speedy fulfilment of the prophetical promise concerning \"the end  of time\" when all nations would be converted to God. A scrupulous  keeper of the Law, Judaism would not hear of the compromises that  heathendom, lately entered into the bosom of the faith, claimed as its  due consideration. It refused to sacrifice a single feature of its  simple dogmatism, of its essential ceremonies, such as circumcision  and Sabbath rest. Moreover, in the period following close upon the  fall of the Temple, a part of the people still nursed the hope of  political restoration, a hope repudiating in its totality the  proclamation of quite another Messianic doctrine. The delusion ended  tragically in Bar Kochba's hapless rebellion (135 C. E.), whose  disastrous issue cut off the last remnant of hope for the restoration  of an \"earthly kingdom.\" Thereafter the ideal of a spiritual state was  replaced by the ideal of a spiritual nation, rallying about a peculiar  religious banner. Jewry grew more and more absorbed in itself. Its  seclusion from the rest of the world became progressively more  complete. Instinct dictated this course as an escape from the danger  of extinction, or, at least, of stagnation. It was conscious of  possessing enough vitality and energy to live for itself and work out  its own salvation. It had its spiritual interests, its peculiar  ideals, and a firm belief in the future. It constituted an ancient  order, whose patent of nobility had been conferred upon it in the days  of the hoary past by the Lord God Himself. Such as it was, it could  not consent to ally itself with _parvenus_, ennobled but to-day,  and yesterday still bowing down before \"gods of silver and gods of  gold.\" This white-haired old man, with a stormy past full of  experiences and thought, would not mingle with the scatter-brained  crowd, would not descend to the level of neophytes dominated by  fleeting, youthful enthusiasm. Loyally this weather-bronzed,  inflexible guardian of the Law stuck to his post--the post entrusted  to him by God Himself--and, faithful to his duty, held fast to the  principle _j'y suis, j'y reste_.    As a political nation threatened by its neighbors seeks support in its  army, and provides sufficient implements of war, so a spiritual nation  must have spiritual weapons of defense at its command. Such weapons  were forged in great numbers, and deposited in the vast arsenal called  the Talmud. The Talmud represents a complicated spiritual discipline,  enjoining unconditional obedience to a higher invisible power. Where  discipline is concerned, questions as to the necessity for one or  another regulation are out of place. Every regulation is necessary, if  only because it contributes to the desired end, namely, discipline.  Let no one ask, then, to what purpose the innumerable religious and  ritual regulations, sometimes reaching the extreme of pettiness, to  what purpose the comprehensive code in which every step in the life of  the faithful is foreseen. The Talmudic religious provisions, all taken  together, aim to put the regimen of the nation on a strictly uniform  basis, so that everywhere the Jew may be able to distinguish a brother  in faith by his peculiar mode of life. It is a uniform with insignia,  by which soldiers of the same regiment recognize one another. Despite  the vast extent of the Jewish diaspora, the Jews formed a  well-articulated spiritual army, an invisible \"state of God\"  (_civitas dei_). Hence these \"knights of the spirit,\" the  citizens of this invisible state, had to wear a distinct uniform, and  be governed by a suitable code of army regulations.    As a protection for Jewish national unity, which was exposed to the  greatest danger after the downfall of the state, there arose and  developed, without any external influence whatsoever, an extraordinary  dictatorship, unofficial and spiritual. The legislative activity of  all the dictators--such as, Rabbi Jochanan ben Zakkai, Rabbi Akiba,  the Hillelites, and the Shammaites--was formulated in the Mishna, the  \"oral law,\" which was the substructure of the Talmud. Their activity  had a characteristic feature, which deserves somewhat particularized  description. The laws were not laid down arbitrarily and without  ceremony. In order to possess binding force, they required the  authoritative confirmation to be found in the Mosaic Books. From  these, whether by logical or by forced interpretation of the holy  text, its words, or, perchance, its letters, they had to be derived.  Each law, barring only the original \"traditions,\" the _Halacha  le-Moshe mi-Sinai_, was promulgated over the supreme signature, as  it were, that is, with the authentication of a word from the Holy  Scriptures. Or it was inferred from another law so authenticated. The  elaboration of every law was thus connected with a very complicated  process of thought, requiring both inductive and deductive reasoning,  and uniting juridical interpretation with the refinements of  casuistry. This legislation was the beginning of Talmudic science,  which from that time on, for many centuries, growing with the ages,  claimed in chief part the intellectual activity of Jewry. The schools  and the academies worked out a system of laws at once religious and  practical in character, which constituted, in turn, the object of  further theoretic study in the same schools and academies. In the  course of time, however, the means became the end. Theoretic  investigation of the law, extending and developing to the furthest  limits, in itself, without reference to its practical value, afforded  satisfaction to the spiritual need. The results of theorizing often  attained the binding force of law in practical life, not because  circumstances ordered it, but simply because one or another academy,  by dint of logic or casuistry, had established it as law. The number  of such deductions from original and secondary laws increased in  geometric progression, and practical life all but failed to keep up  with the theory. The \"close of the Mishna,\" that is, its reduction to  writing, had no daunting effect upon the zeal for research. If  anything, a new and strong impetus was imparted to it. As up to that  time the text of the Holy Scriptures had been made the basis of  interpretation, giving rise to the most diverse"]]]
