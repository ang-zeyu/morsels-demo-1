Mrs. Griggs  says it NEVER belonged to Jasper Dale's mother, for she thought it a sin  to wear anything but print and drugget; and this dress was of PALE BLUE  silk. Besides that, there was a pair of blue satin slippers on the floor  beside it--HIGH-HEELED slippers. And on the fly-leaves of the books  the name 'Alice' was written. Now, there never was an Alice in the Dale  connection and nobody ever heard of the Awkward Man having a sweetheart.  There, isn't that a lovely mystery?\"    \"It's a pretty queer yarn,\" said Felix. \"I wonder if it is true--and  what it means.\"    \"I intend to find out what it means,\" said the Story Girl. \"I am going  to get acquainted with the Awkward Man sometime, and then I'll find out  his Alice-secret.\"    \"I don't see how you'll ever get acquainted with him,\" said Felicity.  \"He never goes anywhere except to church. He just stays home and reads  books when he isn't working. Mother says he is a perfect hermit.\"    \"I'll manage it somehow,\" said the Story Girl--and we had no doubt that  she would. \"But I must wait until I'm a little older, for he wouldn't  tell the secret of the west room to a little girl. And I mustn't wait  till I'm TOO old, for he is frightened of grown-up girls, because he  thinks they laugh at his awkwardness. I know I will like him. He has  such a nice face, even if he is awkward. He looks like a man you could  tell things to.\"    \"Well, I'd like a man who could move around without falling over his own  feet,\" said Felicity. \"And then the look of him! Uncle Roger says he is  long, lank, lean, narrow, and contracted.\"    \"Things always sound worse than they are when Uncle Roger says them,\"  said the Story Girl. \"Uncle Edward says Jasper Dale is a very clever man  and it's a great pity he wasn't able to finish his college course. He  went to college two years, you know. Then his father died, and he stayed  home with his mother because she was very delicate. I call him a hero. I  wonder if it is true that he writes poetry. Mrs. Griggs says it is. She  says she has seen him writing it in a brown book. She said she couldn't  get near enough to read it, but she knew it was poetry by the shape of  it.\"    \"Very likely. If that blue silk dress story is true, I'd believe  ANYTHING of him,\" said Felicity.    We were near Golden Milestone now. The house was a big, weather-gray  structure, overgrown with vines and climbing roses. Something about  the three square windows in the second story gave it an appearance of  winking at us in a friendly fashion through its vines--at least, so the  Story Girl said; and, indeed, we could see it for ourselves after she  had once pointed it out to us.    We did not get into the house, however. We met the Awkward man in his  yard, and he gave us a quarter apiece for our library. He did not seem  awkward or shy; but then we were only children, and his foot was on his  native heath.    He was a tall, slender man, who did not look his forty years, so  unwrinkled was his high, white forehead, so clear and lustrous his  large, dark-blue eyes, so free from silver threads his rather long black  hair. He had large hands and feet, and walked with a slight stoop. I  am afraid we stared at him rather rudely while the Story Girl talked  to him. But was not an Awkward Man, who was also a hermit and kept blue  silk dresses in a locked room, and possibly wrote poetry, a legitimate  object of curiosity? I leave it to you.    When we got away we compared notes, and found that we all liked him--and  this, although he had said little and had appeared somewhat glad to get  rid of us.    \"He gave us the money like a gentleman,\" said the Story Girl. \"I felt he  didn't grudge it. And now for Mr. Campbell. It was on HIS account I put  on my red silk. I don't suppose the Awkward Man noticed it at all, but  Mr. Campbell will, or I'm much mistaken.\"        CHAPTER VII. HOW BETTY SHERMAN WON A HUSBAND    The rest of us did not share the Story Girl's enthusiasm regarding  our call on Mr. Campbell. We secretly dreaded it. If, as was said, he  detested children, who knew what sort of a reception we might meet?    Mr. Campbell was a rich, retired farmer, who took life easily. He had  visited New York and Boston, Toronto and Montreal; he had even been as  far as the Pacific coast. Therefore he was regarded in Carlisle as a  much travelled man; and he was known to be \"well read\" and intelligent.  But it was also known that Mr. Campbell was not always in a good  humour. If he liked you there was nothing he would not do for you; if he  disliked you--well, you were not left in ignorance of it. In short, we  had the impression that Mr. Campbell resembled the famous little girl  with the curl in the middle of her forehead. \"When he was good, he was  very, very good, and when he was bad he was horrid.\" What if this were  one of his horrid days?    \"He can't DO anything to us, you know,\" said the Story Girl. \"He may be  rude, but that won't hurt any one but himself.\"    \"Hard words break no bones,\" observed Felicity philosophically.    \"But they hurt your feelings. I am afraid of Mr. Campbell,\" said Cecily  candidly.    \"Perhaps we'd better give up and go home,\" suggested Dan.    \"You can go home if you like,\" said the Story Girl scornfully. \"But I am  going to see Mr. Campbell. I know I can manage him. But if I have to go  alone, and he gives me anything, I'll keep it all for my own collection,  mind you.\"    That settled it. We were not going to let the Story Girl get ahead of us  in the manner of collecting.    Mr. Campbell's housekeeper ushered us into his parlour and left us.  Presently Mr. Campbell himself was standing in the doorway, looking us  over. We took heart of grace. It seemed to be one of his good days,  for there was a quizzical smile on his broad, clean-shaven,  strongly-featured face. Mr. Campbell was a tall man, with a massive  head, well thatched with thick, black hair, gray-streaked. He had  big, black eyes, with many wrinkles around them, and a thin, firm,  long-lipped mouth. We thought him handsome, for an old man.    His gaze wandered over us with uncomplimentary indifference until it  fell on the Story Girl, leaning back in an arm-chair. She looked like a  slender red lily in the unstudied grace of her attitude. A spark flashed  into Mr. Campbell's black eyes.    \"Is this a Sunday School deputation?\" he inquired rather ironically.    \"No. We have come to ask a favour of you,\" said the Story Girl.    The magic of her voice worked its will on Mr. Campbell, as on all  others. He came in, sat down, hooked his thumb into his vest pocket, and  smiled at her.    \"What is it?\" he asked.    \"We are collecting for our school library, and we have called to ask you  for a contribution,\" she replied.    \"Why should I contribute to your school library?\" demanded Mr. Campbell.    This was a poser for us. Why should he, indeed? But the Story Girl  was quite equal to it. Leaning forward, and throwing an indescribable  witchery into tone and eyes and smile, she said,    \"Because a lady asks you.\"    Mr. Campbell chuckled.    \"The best of all reasons,\" he said. \"But see here, my dear young lady,  I'm an old miser and curmudgeon, as you may have heard. I HATE to part  with my money, even for a good reason. And I NEVER part with any of  it, unless I am to receive some benefit from the expenditure. Now, what  earthly good could I get from your three by six school library? None  whatever. But I shall make you a fair offer. I have heard from my  housekeeper's urchin of a son that you are a 'master hand' to tell  stories. Tell me one, here and now. I shall pay you in proportion to the  entertainment you afford me. Come now, and do your prettiest.\"    There was a fine mockery in his tone that put the Story Girl on her  mettle instantly. She sprang to her feet, an amazing change coming over  her. Her eyes flashed and burned; crimson spots glowed in her cheeks.    \"I shall tell you the story of the Sherman girls, and how Betty Sherman  won a husband,\" she said.    We gasped. Was the Story Girl crazy? Or had she forgotten that Betty  Sherman was Mr. Campbell's own great-grandmother, and that her method  of winning a husband was not exactly in accordance with maidenly  traditions.    But Mr. Campbell chuckled again.    \"An excellent test,\" he said. \"If you can amuse ME with that story you  must be a wonder. I've heard it so often that it has no more interest  for me than the alphabet.\"    \"One cold winter day, eighty years ago,\" began the Story Girl without  further parley, \"Donald Fraser was sitting by the window of his new  house, playing his fiddle for company, and looking out over the white,  frozen bay before his door. It was bitter, bitter cold, and a storm was  brewing. But, storm, or no storm, Donald meant to go over the bay that  evening to see Nancy Sherman. He was thinking of her as he played 'Annie  Laurie,' for Nancy was more beautiful than the lady of the song. 'Her  face, it is the fairest that e'er the sun shone on,' hummed Donald--and  oh, he thought so, too! He did not know whether Nancy cared for him or  not. He had many rivals. But he knew that if she would not come to be  the mistress of his new house no one else ever should. So he sat there  that afternoon and dreamed of her, as he played sweet old songs and  rollicking jigs on his fiddle.    \"While he was playing a sleigh drove up to the door, and Neil Campbell  came in. Donald was not overly glad to see him, for he suspected where  he was going. Neil Campbell, who was Highland Scotch and lived down  at Berwick, was courting Nancy Sherman, too; and, what was far worse,  Nancy's father favoured him, because he was a richer man than Donald  Fraser. But Donald was not going to show all he thought--Scotch people  never do--and he pretended to be very glad to see Neil and made him  heartily welcome.    \"Neil sat down by the roaring fire, looking quite well"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53506"],[0,"A Collection of Kachári Folk-Tales and Rhymes (#10)"],[1,"er, bought merchandise,  and hired a boat, and took two men with him; and, after doing obeisance  to his mother, set forth into strange lands. And at last he moored  his boat at the ghat of a certain village, and sent his men out to  hawk his goods. But he himself stayed with the boat. And at that ghat  dwelt an aged couple, who possessed a white and beautiful swan which  they cherished as their own child, and fed with their own food. And  one day at midday, when men were enjoying their siesta, the merchant  lad saw the white swan remove her swan dress and bathe in the river,  a lovely slim maiden. Whereupon he began to pay great regard to the  old couple, and gave them of his store without money. But as time  went by, all his goods were disposed of, and then he went to the old  people and offered them a great price for their swan. Nor when they  would give it to him for nothing would he accept it, seeing that it  were a sin to take a wife as a gift. So, finally he made them take  much money and went away home, taking his swan with him. But when he  reached home, behold the swan remained a swan, and the lad was sore  vexed and lost his sleep and his food, so that his mother was in fear,  and asked sundry of the villagers what might be the matter.    And, finally, one of them, who was a wise woman, said to her:  \"Something has happened to him while he was away trading, and now  you must find out what it was. And the way to do it is this: You must  get a fair girl to comb his hair; and let her pretend to grieve that  he is so ill, and let her cry into his hair, and to a fair maiden he  will tell what he would never say to his mother.\" So a girl came and  combed his hair, and wept silently till the tears fell on his head, and  when he asked what ailed her, said she could not bear to see him pine  away. So at last he told her of the white swan, which turned before  his very eyes into a lovely maiden, but that now it remained ever a  white swan, though he was pining away for very love of her. So she went  and told the mother, and the mother told the wise woman, who bade them  get the lad to lie awake till midnight and then the swan-maiden would  arise, and, assuming her maiden form, would worship her own country's  gods. And then he was to leap up suddenly and cast her swan skin on the  hearth and burn it; and then of a surety she would remain a maiden. So  the lad prepared a basin of oil and ashes and a yak's tail, and did  as the wise woman bade. And in the depth of night, the swan came and  felt him all over with her beak. But he never stirred a whit. And then,  believing him to be asleep, she stripped off her swan's skin slowly,  and prayed aloud to the gods of her own country. Then the lad got  out of bed very silently, and seizing the swan's skin thrust it in  the ashes. And when she smelled the burning feathers, she cried aloud  \"Ah! what have you done? what have you done?\" and fell senseless on  the floor. But he anointed her with the oil, and fanned her with the  yak's tail, till presently her great eyes opened and he saw that she  loved him. And then they lived happily ever afterwards. And that's all!            BROTHER AND SISTER.    A certain king died, and soon after his death his wife bare him a  daughter, as she had heretofore borne him a son. And then she too  died. But before she died, she bade her son \"Strike hard, but once  only!\" And she committed her daughter to his care. And, though they  lost their kingdom and were forced to beg their bread, the brother  was a good brother, and took care of his sister until they came to  a certain kingdom, the king of which took pity on them and kept them  in his own palace.    Now, in that kingdom dwelt seven thieves, who oppressed the king,  so that he was compelled to send them fowls, pigs, cattle, and  pigeons every day. And when the brother heard of this, he begged  the king to let him go and kill the thieves. And when the king was  unwilling to let him undertake the enterprise, the brother insisted,  and, borrowing a horse and a sword from the king, went to the thieves'  house, and there tied up his horse and waited with drawn sword at the  door. And when the eldest thief came out, he cut him down, and so in  turn he cut down each of them. But the youngest of all was suspicious  and came out cautiously, so that the brother was not able to kill  him at one blow. So, mindful of his mother's saying, he shut him up  in one of the thieves' houses, and put a lock upon the door. And then  he went and told all that had happened to the king; who, as a reward  made the brother and sister custodians of the thieves' houses. And  so they went and stayed there, and the brother said to his sister  \"You can go into and examine all the houses except the one that is  locked.\" And the brother was a mighty hunter. But before he went out  a hunting, he mixed pulse and grain, and, filling a plate with the  mixture, bade his sister separate the seeds while he was away. And  this occupied her a whole day. And then she went and examined all the  rooms in the thieves' houses. And in some were cattle, and in some  fowls, and in some horses, and so forth. But her mind was ill at ease,  because she might not examine the house that was locked. \"For,\" she  said to herself, \"if I do not see what is in that house, I cannot be  happy.\" So she went and saw, and there she found a man half dead with  his wound; and when he besought her, she pitied him, and fetched him  such medicines as he required of her. So that at the end of some days  he was healed, and in course of time they two fell in love with one  another. And the wicked thief began to teach the girl how she should  bring about the destruction of her brother. And he bade her, when her  brother returned, to pretend to be ill, and to say that nothing would  cure her save a drink of tigress' milk. And when her brother heard  this, he set out in search of a she-tiger. And, as luck would have it,  he found a she-tiger with a bone stuck in her teeth. So, after binding  her with a vow, he extracted the bone from her teeth, and then he told  her what he required. So she gave him of her milk, and also one of her  whelps. And then he returned home. And at dawn the thief asked the  sister \"Did he bring you the tigress's milk?\" And she replied \"That  he did, and he brought a tiger's whelp also.\" On which the thief was  much discomfited. Then he bade her ask her brother fetch some water  from a certain tank, well knowing that to fetch water from that tank,  was certain death. On which she said to her brother \"If you can only  get me water from that tank, I shall certainly be well.\" So the brother  took his horse and a sword, and a hound, and also the tiger's whelp,  and set out. And on the way he came to a great tree and stopped to  rest in the shade; and while he was resting, a huge snake came and  began climbing up the tree. And, seeing it, the brother cut the snake  in two with his sword; and when a second snake came, he slew that,  too. And while he was still resting, a bird came flying to the tree  with food for her nestlings. But they refused to eat. And when their  mother asked them why they would not eat, they said \"Unless you take  pity on the man who is resting under the tree, we cannot eat.\" So the  mother bird promised; and, having fed her nestlings, flew down to the  brother and asked him what he desired. And he said that he desired  water from a certain tank. But the bird knew all about the properties  of the tank, and told the brother. Now, near the tank dwelt a maiden,  the guardian of the tank; and he entered into her house, and told her  his heart's desire. But she said to him \"You must not go near the tank,  for you will die. You must marry me. And as for your sister, she has  disobeyed your word, and has married the thief you nearly killed, and  their desire is only to be rid of you.\" So they two were married, and,  going to the thief's house, slew the thief and the wicked sister. And  then they lived happily ever afterwards. And that's all!            THE STORY OF THE TOAD. [13]    There was an aged couple, who were very poor. But they had a fish trap,  which they set at night; and the fish they caught they exchanged for  rice. And one night it happened that no fish got into the trap, but  only toads, so that the trap was brimfull. And at early dawn, when  the cock crowed, the old man came, and finding the trap very heavy  was rejoiced, and hoisting it on to his back waddled away. And when  he got home he woke up his wife, crying \"Old woman, old woman, not up  yet? The day has dawned.\" So the old woman jumped up, and blew up the  fire, and the old couple squatted over it, warming themselves. And  the old man said \"We are in luck to-day! The trap is brimfull.\" Then  the old woman said \"Let's see, let's see.\" So the old man tumbled  out the contents of the trap, and, behold, they were all toads. So  the old woman said \"We are in luck to-day! We shall have lots to  eat to-day!\" And the old man bid her kill the toads without further  words. And the old woman, taking her stick, ran about after the  toads and slew them one by one. But one alone, half dead with fear,  crawled under the old woman's stool. But the rest she skinned and  cleaned. Then, removing the stool, the old man saw the survivor, and  said to the old woman \"There is one left; kill that, too!\" But the  toad called out \"Ah! father, do not kill me. I will plough for you,  and hoe for you, and plant out paddy for you!\" But the old man replied  \"How shall a toad do all these things? Your ploughing and hoeing would  be a bitter business! You only want to get off being killed.\" But he  pleaded so sore, and begged so hard, that they took pity on him and  let him stay in their house. And so the days went by till the rainy  season came round, and the toad went off to plough in the field. And  as he was sitting on the handle of the plough urging on his cattle,  a king"]]]
