Concealed or openly, it goes  through his writings with the same constancy that streams flow through  plains that go out from glacier mountains. In the English translations  of his romances elaborate descriptions of other forms of perversion of  the genesic instinct have been largely expurgated, but it is impossible  to purge them entirely of the incest theme, for in many of his writings  it is beyond the verbal description. It is the atmosphere of the book.  Take, for instance, the novel \"L'Innocente.\" On the face of it, it is  the narration of the conduct of a man who, having wedded a superior  woman of great intellectual charm and bodily attractions, yields to the  temptations of the life of dissipation in which he had distinguished  himself previous to an ideal matrimony and a contented paternity. He  realizes that his digressions are scandalous, and that their frequent  deliberate repetitions justify his wife in living apart from him, though  her love, being beyond control, still continues. They agree to live with  each other as brother and sister. The moment he succeeds in placing her  in his soul as his sister an irresistible impulse seizes him to have  carnal possession of her, and the burden of the book is a description of  his seduction of his own wife, who in the new covenant is his sister.  Meanwhile with consummate art he has described in the first chapter as  the only true love that which exists between brother and sister, his  apostrophe of it having been called forth by recalling the sister whom  death had fortunately removed.    Before he has accomplished the seduction of his wife-sister he has  precipitated her into a vulgar adventure with his own brother, a pattern  of all the virtues. It is a part of his consummate art to create  circumstantial evidence that will tend to put the paternity of her child  upon a fellow author who in other days had been civil and courteous to  his wife, and had sent her a copy of his latest book with an enigmatical  inscription on the fly-leaf, but in reality he succeeds in creating an  atmosphere from which one senses with readiness that the real father is  his brother. The book, in so far as it is concerned with the nobility of  Giuliana, the sweetness of life in the country, the lovability of her  mother and her children, the way in which Giuliana's emotions and  thought after the advent of the child are shaped that she may grow to  hate it as he hates it, as well as the mental elaborations that justify  him in seeking to destroy it, and the accomplishment of it, are done in  a way that shows the author to be not only intimately familiar with the  workings of the normal human mind but with the depraved human mind.    From the beginning of his literary career D'Annunzio was at no pains to  conceal that he was the model from which he painted his heroes. The  reader who identifies him with Tullio Hermil is the perspicacious  reader, in the eyes of the author; the reader who considers the conduct  of Tullio, infracting as it does the canons of law, of morality, and of  decency, as the conduct of a superman, is, in the judgment of the  author, the sapient reader. He who sees in Tullio and his conduct a  beast abnormally freighted with lubricity, lacking in inhibitory  qualities of a man unguided and uninfluenced by any obligation to God or  man, and knowing no other obligation than the pursuit of his own  pleasures and desires, is a fool, a weakling, an inanimate mass of  protoplasm moulded in the form of a human being unworthy of  consideration. D'Annunzio conceived himself a superman long before he  began to write romances, and I am not one of those who believe that he  got his conception from Nietzsche. He got it from the same indescribable  source that that unbalanced monster of materialism got his. Its roots if  they could be traced back to the days of the Hebrew prophets would be  found to have their germinal sprouts in some descendant of Samuel or  David.    D'Annunzio's romances are a mixture of materialism, sensualism, and  pessimism reduced in a pagan mortar to a homogeneous consistency, and  then skilfully admixed with honey so that it is acceptable to the  Christian palate, but, once it has got beyond the taste-buds of the  tongue, once it is taken into the system, its poisonous, corroding, and  destructive qualities become operative. I doubt if D'Annunzio ever wrote  a word or line in his plays or romances that any one was the better for  having read or heard, and by better I mean that he added to his  spiritual possessions, to his inherent nobility, or to his aspirations  for a moral perfection, one iota. I doubt if any normal human being,  normal physically, mentally, and spiritually, can read \"Il Piacere\"  without feeling ill and humiliated, not because of the picture that the  author draws of himself in the guise of Andrea Sperelli, this finished  expert in the employments of love, nor of Donna Maria, nor of the woman  more infernally expert in those matters, nor the score of other  characters which he paints with a master-hand, but because of the way in  which he draws his bow across the overtaut strings of sensuousness until  they scream and wail in frenzied fashion and then finally burst asunder.  The way in which he makes an appeal to his perverted sensuality through  vicarious overstimulation of the senses with which he was endowed for  self-conservation and self-preservation, the senses of smell and sight  and touch and hearing, is in itself a perversion. He stimulates them  until they shriek for mercy or for immersion in some benumbing balm. The  true pervert is he who puts out of proportion and out of perspective the  sources of aesthetic emanation, and who concentrates them upon the  percipient apparatus of one or other of the senses so that it may be  excited to a frenzied activity. The description of Andrea's room, in  which he awaits Donna Maria, with its perfumes, lights, and colors, and  the description of his toilet articles and his bedroom is one of the  most nauseating things in all literature. Like Nietzsche, D'Annunzio  looks upon women as creatures of an inferior race, instruments of  pleasure and procreation who were created to serve. When they no longer  are amusing, useful, or serviceable they are to be brushed aside and  with the same _sang froid_ as one would put aside an automobile that had  broken down, worn out, or because it's \"corpo non e piu giovane,\" as he  kept saying of Foscarina in \"Il Fuoco,\" who belonged to him, \"like the  thing one holds in his fist, like the ring on one's finger, like a  glove, like a garment, like a word that may be spoken or not, like a  draft that may be drunk or poured on the ground.\"    In \"Vergini delle Rocce\" he expounds the theory that inequality is the  essence of the state, and in this book as well as in \"Il Trionfo della  Morte\" we find all the passion of language and of sentiment that one  finds in Nietzsche. It is no longer to be doubted that he had kept his  word \"noi tendiamo l'orecchio alla voce del magnanimo Zarathustra e  prepariamo nell' arte con sicura fede l'avvento del Uebermensch del  superuomo\"--we listen to the voicing of the magnanimous Zarathustra and  we prepare with unfaltering faith for the coming of the superman to the  arts.    In his life of Cola di Rienzo D'Annunzio again took occasion to lampoon  and traduce the common people, describing them as the great beast which  must be crushed and annihilated. \"Il Trionfo della Morte\" is the very  essence of Heraclitan philosophy and Dionysan ethics. The hero, who is a  paragon of knowledge which he displays for the reader's edification,  meets the young and pretty wife of a business man who bores her. He is  successful finally in permitting her to pass a few weeks with him in his  villa by the sea. During these weeks they run the gamut of every  conceivable sensation and the reader gets a description of them and of  the gradual hatred that develops in him for his subjection of her.  \"Every human soul carries in it for love a definite quality of sensitive  force. This quality is used up with time and when it is used up no  effort can prevent love from ceasing.\" But, unlike the animal when his  concupiscence is satiated and he is still urged to greater display, the  hero is not content with driving her from him; he must needs mete out  the same fate to her that he did to the infant in \"Il Piacere,\" so he  lures her to the edge of a sea cliff and hurls her into space. \"She  would in death become for me matter of thought, pure ideality; from a  precarious and imperfect existence she would enter into an existence  complete and definite, forsaking forever the infirmities of her weak,  luxurious flesh. Destroy to possess. There is no other way for him who  seeks the absolute in love.\"    The reader yields to the enchantment of his style, to the seductiveness  of his lyrism, to the intoxications of his descriptions of beauty; and  the critic and fellow writer to his mastery of technic and consummate  mastery of behavioristic psychology. From the critics' point of view  \"The Triumph of Death\" and \"The Fire\" are the high-water marks of  D'Annunzio as a stylist, and they mark his completest moral dissolution.    In \"Il Fuoco\" we get the same ethics, philosophy, aesthetics, and  glorification of sensuousness that we get in all his other books. Here  the two leading characters are exact replicas of himself and of the  world's greatest actress of her day portrayed in an environment, Venice,  that is redolent of beauty in decay, like a cracked Grecian vase  overfilled with withered rose leaves which fall from it at every puff of  wind. This environment makes an ideal palette upon which he blends the  colors whose pigments he has been selecting and experimenting with for a  quarter of a century. The publication of it promoted his voluntary exile "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41990"],[0,"The Cid Campeador: A Historical Romance (#10)"],[1,"the law of Mahomet and must fight against it  still; however, for all that, I cannot deny that Mahomet was a wise man,  in one thing at least--permitting a man to have three wives. I would not  only allow three but three hundred, so that none of them could claim  more than the three-hundredth part of a man's love. A man returns home,  after a long journey, sore and weary, and instead of finding a woman to  welcome him with open arms, he finds a regular fury, who receives him  with abuse and with scratches enough to blind him.\"    With these wise reflections Fernan ascended the stairs, and, entering  the chamber of Mayorica, he found her, bathed in tears, sitting on a  chair, in such a condition that it awoke compassion to see her. Such,  then, did our squire feel, and as pity is said to be akin to love, his  returned in such a degree that his angry thoughts were well-nigh  forgotten.    \"Who has offended you, Mayorica of my soul?\" exclaimed Fernan,  approaching the damsel with open arms; but she suddenly arose, and  seizing, with great fury, the squire by the neck, cried out--    \"Ah, traitor, and worse than traitor! I will choke you, so that you may  never more deceive honourable girls who are worth more than your whole  race.\"    \"I vow by Judas Iscariot! by the soul of Beelzebub!\" muttered Fernan  with stifled voice, struggling to get free from his enraged sweetheart.  \"Let go, let go, you vixen, or I shall make you do so, even if I have to  strike you.\"    And making a violent effort, he found himself free from the young woman,  whom he pushed from him across the floor, though he did not do so before  getting some scratches on his face.    Mayorica, knowing that her nails were insufficient weapons to fight  against so robust a lover, had recourse to the usual one of women, that  is, to her tongue, and Fernan to a similar one, as he considered it was  not courteous and honourable to fight with stronger weapons, especially  when his adversary was a woman.    \"Woe is me! who, having refused the love even of hidalgos, have kept my  honour intact for the sake of such a low-born squire, a greater traitor  than Judas himself!\" cried Mayorica, bursting out again into torrents of  tears, that would have softened a stone.    Fernan laid aside his annoyance and endeavoured to conquer the anger of  his sweetheart with mild reasoning, for his heart was as soft as wax  when dealing with women, as it was hard as flint before his enemies on  the field of battle. And besides, what should a man do but humble  himself before a woman who at thirty years of age--for Mayorica was not  a day younger--comes with unstained honour to a man, in order that he  may claim her as his own?    \"Be quiet, be quiet, Mayorica of my soul! I always look on you as my  own, and I have always loved you, and ever will love you,\" he  interrupted, with endearing accents and an affectionate gaze.    \"Ah, you villain!\" replied the young woman, \"it was not enough for you  to act the traitor but you must also come to me with lies in your mouth.  You then want to deny what my very eyes have witnessed?\"    \"Let not that pain you, Mayorica; with my arms I did not give my heart  to that peasant girl, Aldonza; I keep it always for you.\"    \"Be off, traitor! your ridiculous excuses enrage me more than they  appease me. Depart from me, and never, as long as you live, dare to look  on me again with eyes of affection.\"    It appeared to Fernan that the anger of Mayorica was lasting much too  long; thus it was that, his patience failing him, he determined to make  use of his arithmetical argument, and if he could not succeed in  convincing her with it, to renounce the attempt, and even, if necessary,  his love itself.    \"Well, then,\" he said, \"I am fond of Aldonza, but, I swear to you, of no  other but you and her. I have told you a thousand times that, according  to my calculations, there are two women in Spain for every man. Is it  not nonsense, then, to blame me for only claiming what belongs to me,  when I go no farther?\"    \"Be off with you, shameless wretch!\" exclaimed Mayorica, at the height  of her exasperation.    \"Yes, and at once,\" said Fernan; \"for Aldonza is awaiting me, in order  to repay with interest the embrace I gave her.\"    Saying this, he quitted the chamber of Mayorica and went off to his own,  muttering on his way--    \"By the soul of Beelzebub, how this nonsense, this obstinacy, this  absurdity of women, makes my blood boil! I will rest myself to-night,  for I need to do so, and to-morrow I will compensate myself with Aldonza  for the ingratitude of Mayorica. That girl is affectionate and not cross  and quarrelsome, like the vixen I have just left.\"          CHAPTER VI    HOW FERNAN DESPAIRED OF GETTING WOMEN TO UNDERSTAND REASON, AND HOW  DIEGO LAINEZ HOPED THAT HIS HONOUR WILL BE AVENGED      Morning began to break when a cross-bowman, who was keeping watch on the  battlements of the Castle of Vivar, heard the trampling of horses at a  short distance from the fortifications, and a moment after he saw  advancing a body of horsemen and also men on foot, who seemed to bear a  litter. He put to his mouth the speaking-trumpet which hung from his  neck, and cried out, \"Who goes there?\" Those who were approaching  answered by a signal, which he evidently understood, as the bridges and  the portcullis were at once lowered, and the cort[`e]ge entered the  courtyard.    A short time before Fernan had left the castle by an iron-bound door,  which led to the stables and which was used for the egress and ingress  of the servants of the lords of Vivar, especially in the night-time,  when the principal entrance was defended by a double portcullis and a  gate, too heavy to raise frequently.    Whither was the squire going so early in the morning? It is easy to  guess, if we remember the last words he used when retiring to rest a few  hours before. Notwithstanding his quarrel with Mayorica, he had slept  that night like a dead man, until an early hour of the morning, at which  time he awoke, as was his custom, and hastened off to the dwelling of  Aldonza, for she lived at some distance, and he had to be back in the  castle before his master arose, when he should have to be in attendance  on him. We must, however, tell who the girl was whom he was about to  visit, and also who the old woman was with whom she lived. To do this it  is only necessary to copy literally the words of the chronicler, who  writes: \"The girl was named Aldonza, and was very pretty and attractive,  so that there was none like her in those parts. Many gallants sought her  affection, but it was of no avail, as she was in love with a gentle  squire named Fernan, who belonged to the house of the honoured Diego  Lainez. There lived with her an old witch, by name Mari-Perez, whom all  the maidens and youths that were in love went to consult.\"    Far be it from us to question the text which we have just quoted: the  reader can do it if he so desires. If the occupation of Mari-Perez may  not be considered a very honourable one, let the blame rest with the  chronicler, and let it be put down to malice, for it looks as if he  harboured such against her, to judge by the way he expresses himself.  All we shall add is that Aldonza called the old woman with whom she  lived \"mother,\" but we are certain that she was not such, for if she  were so, that fact would have been mentioned in the chronicle, which  goes into much detail regarding the persons who figure in it.    Aldonza and the woman she called her mother resided in a cottage  situated amongst the trees of a lonely glen, through which rushed a  torrent, whose roar contributed not a little to increase the  superstitious dread with which the inhabitants of the country  surrounding Vivar approached the dwelling-place of the witch, for by  that name Mari-Perez was commonly known. Fernan, however, who did not  trouble himself much about witchcraft, knocked at the door of Aldonza,  consoling himself with the thoughts of the good reception he would  receive from Aldonza, compared with the scratches which Mayorica had  inflicted on him. The girl appeared at the small window above the door  and asked who was there.    \"It's me,\" answered the squire; \"open the door, for this mist that's  rising from the brook is freezing me.\"    \"Wait,\" said Aldonza, and taking up a jug of water, she threw it out on  the unfortunate Fernan, exclaiming--    \"You will die here, traitor, villain, ruffian, blackguard! Do you think  you can deceive me any longer? It is you that are tricked now!\"    And not content with having wetted him to the skin with the water and  nearly broken his head with the jug, she began to hurl down on him such  a quantity of tiles, stones, and other projectiles, that if he had not  sheltered himself at once behind the trunk of an oak tree, which luckily  happened to be near, she would have nearly killed him, considering her  fury and the accuracy with which she aimed.    \"Halt, you minx!\" exclaimed Fernan, soaked through not only with water,  but also with blood. \"As sure as I catch you, I'll take every inch of  skin off your back with lashes. Is it thus, you vixen, that you treat so  faithful a lover as I am? Would that I had never set my eyes on a jade  like you! May I lose my strength if at this very moment I do not, with  blows and lashes, half kill both you and the witch who lives with you!\"    Thus speaking, the squire rushed at the door and gave it a furious kick,  in order to break it in; but his own head narrowly escaped being broken  in by another jug and more tiles and stones, which made him return to  his tree more quickly than he could have wished.    \"What did I do to you? what did I do to you, that you should attack me  with such fury?\"    \"Be off, traitor!\" replied the girl; \"be off to the castle, and tell her  who awaits you there that from this day forward you are hers alone.\"    The enamoured Fernan came now to the"]]]
