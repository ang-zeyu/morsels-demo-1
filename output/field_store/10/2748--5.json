Another time they were at a wedding, when suddenly the lake-maiden fell  a-sobbing and a-weeping, amid the joy and mirth of all around her.    Her husband tapped her on the shoulder, and asked her, \"Why do you  weep?\"    \"Because they are entering into trouble; and trouble is upon you; for  that is the second causeless blow you have given me. Be careful; the  third is the last.\"    The husband was careful never to strike her again. But one day at a  funeral she suddenly burst out into fits of laughter. Her husband  forgot, and touched her rather roughly on the shoulder, saying, \"Is  this a time for laughter?\"    \"I laugh,\" she said, \"because those that die go out of trouble, but  your trouble has come. The last blow has been struck; our marriage is  at an end, and so farewell.\" And with that she rose up and left the  house and went to their home.    Then she, looking round upon her home, called to the cattle she had  brought with her:      Brindle cow, white speckled,    Spotted cow, bold freckled,    Old white face, and gray Geringer,    And the white bull from the king's coast,    Grey ox, and black calf,    All, all, follow me home,    Now the black calf had just been slaughtered, and was hanging on the  hook; but it got off the hook alive and well and followed her; and the  oxen, though they were ploughing, trailed the plough with them and did  her bidding. So she fled to the lake again, they following her, and  with them plunged into the dark waters.    And to this day is the furrow seen which the plough left as it was  dragged across the mountains to the tarn.    Only once did she come again, when her sons were grown to manhood, and  then she gave them gifts of healing by which they won the name of  Meddygon Myddvai, the physicians of Myddvai.        THE SPRIGHTLY TAILOR    A sprightly tailor was employed by the great Macdonald, in his castle  at Saddell, in order to make the laird a pair of trews, used in olden  time. And trews being the vest and breeches united in one piece, and  ornamented with fringes, were very comfortable, and suitable to be worn  in walking or dancing. And Macdonald had said to the tailor, that if he  would make the trews by night in the church, he would get a handsome  reward. For it was thought that the old ruined church was haunted, and  that fearsome things were to be seen there at night.    The tailor was well aware of this; but he was a sprightly man, and when  the laird dared him to make the trews by night in the church, the  tailor was not to be daunted, but took it in hand to gain the prize.  So, when night came, away he went up the glen, about half a mile  distance from the castle, till he came to the old church. Then he chose  him a nice gravestone for a seat and he lighted his candle, and put on  his thimble, and set to work at the trews; plying his needle nimbly,  and thinking about the hire that the laird would have to give him.    For some time he got on pretty well, until he felt the floor all of a  tremble under his feet; and looking about him, but keeping his fingers  at work, he saw the appearance of a great human head rising up through  the stone pavement of the church. And when the head had risen above the  surface, there came from it a great, great voice. And the voice said:  \"Do you see this great head of mine?\"    \"I see that, but I'll sew this!\" replied the sprightly tailor; and he  stitched away at the trews.    Then the head rose higher up through the pavement, until its neck  appeared. And when its neck was shown, the thundering voice came again  and said: \"Do you see this great neck of mine?\"    \"I see that, but I'll sew this!\" said the sprightly tailor; and he  stitched away at his trews.    Then the head and neck rose higher still, until the great shoulders and  chest were shown above the ground. And again the mighty voice  thundered: \"Do you see this great chest of mine?\"    And again the sprightly tailor replied: \"I see that, but I'll sew  this!\" and stitched away at his trews.    And still it kept rising through the pavement, until it shook a great  pair of arms in the tailor's face, and said: \"Do you see these great  arms of mine?\"    \"I see those, but I'll sew this!\" answered the tailor; and he stitched  hard at his trews, for he knew that he had no time to lose.    The sprightly tailor was taking the long stitches, when he saw it  gradually rising and rising through the floor, until it lifted out a  great leg, and stamping with it upon the pavement, said in a roaring  voice: \"Do you see this great leg of mine?\"    \"Aye, aye: I see that, but I'll sew this!\" cried the tailor; and his  fingers flew with the needle, and he took such long stitches, that he  was just come to the end of the trews, when it was taking up its other  leg. But before it could pull it out of the pavement, the sprightly  tailor had finished his task; and, blowing out his candle, and  springing from off his gravestone, he buckled up, and ran out of the  church with the trews under his arm. Then the fearsome thing gave a  loud roar, and stamped with both his feet upon the pavement, and out of  the church he went after the sprightly tailor.    Down the glen they ran, faster than the stream when the flood rides it;  but the tailor had got the start and a nimble pair of legs, and he did  not choose to lose the laird's reward. And though the thing roared to  him to stop, yet the sprightly tailor was not the man to be beholden to  a monster. So he held his trews tight, and let no darkness grow under  his feet, until he had reached Saddell Castle. He had no sooner got  inside the gate, and shut it, than the apparition came up to it; and,  enraged at losing his prize, struck the wall above the gate, and left  there the mark of his five great fingers. Ye may see them plainly to  this day, if ye'll only peer close enough.    But the sprightly tailor gained his reward: for Macdonald paid him  handsomely for the trews, and never discovered that a few of the  stitches were somewhat long.        THE STORY OF DEIRDRE    There was a man in Ireland once who was called Malcolm Harper. The man  was a right good man, and he had a goodly share of this world's goods.  He had a wife, but no family. What did Malcolm hear but that a  soothsayer had come home to the place, and as the man was a right good  man, he wished that the soothsayer might come near them. Whether it was  that he was invited or that he came of himself, the soothsayer came to  the house of Malcolm.    \"Are you doing any soothsaying?\" says Malcolm.    \"Yes, I am doing a little. Are you in need of soothsaying?\"    \"Well, I do not mind taking soothsaying from you, if you had  soothsaying for me, and you would be willing to do it.\"    \"Well, I will do soothsaying for you. What kind of soothsaying do you  want?\"    \"Well, the soothsaying I wanted was that you would tell me my lot or  what will happen to me, if you can give me knowledge of it.\"    \"Well, I am going out, and when I return, I will tell you.\"    And the soothsayer went forth out of the house and he was not long  outside when he returned.    \"Well,\" said the soothsayer, \"I saw in my second sight that it is on  account of a daughter of yours that the greatest amount of blood shall  be shed that has ever been shed in Erin since time and race began. And  the three most famous heroes that ever were found will lose their heads  on her account.\"    After a time a daughter was born to Malcolm, he did not allow a living  being to come to his house, only himself and the nurse. He asked this  woman, \"Will you yourself bring up the child to keep her in hiding far  away where eye will not see a sight of her nor ear hear a word about  her?\"    The woman said she would, so Malcolm got three men, and he took them  away to a large mountain, distant and far from reach, without the  knowledge or notice of any one. He caused there a hillock, round and  green, to be dug out of the middle, and the hole thus made to be  covered carefully over so that a little company could dwell there  together. This was done.    Deirdre and her foster-mother dwelt in the bothy mid the hills without  the knowledge or the suspicion of any living person about them and  without anything occurring, until Deirdre was sixteen years of age.  Deirdre grew like the white sapling, straight and trim as the rash on  the moss. She was the creature of fairest form, of loveliest aspect,  and of gentlest nature that existed between earth and heaven in all  Ireland--whatever colour of hue she had before, there was nobody that  looked into her face but she would blush fiery red over it.    The woman that had charge of her, gave Deirdre every information and  skill of which she herself had knowledge and skill. There was not a  blade of grass growing from root, nor a bird singing in the wood, nor a  star shining from heaven but Deirdre had a name for it. But one thing,  she did not wish her to have either part or parley with any single  living man of the rest of the world. But on a gloomy winter night, with  black, scowling clouds, a hunter of game was wearily travelling the  hills, and what happened but that he missed the trail of the hunt, and  lost his course and companions. A drowsiness came upon the man as he  wearily wandered over the hills, and he lay down by the side of the  beautiful green knoll in which Deirdre lived, and he slept. The man was  faint from hunger and wandering, and benumbed with cold, and a deep  sleep fell upon him. When he lay down beside the green hill where  Deirdre was, a troubled dream came to the man, and he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7896"],[0,"The Eight Strokes of the Clock (#10)"],[1,"? It reminds one of Newton's apple.... One day, the sun,  passing through the water in that bottle, must have set fire to a scrap of  cotton or the head of a match; and, as you had the sun at your disposal  just now, you said to yourself, 'Now's the time,' and stood the bottle in  the right position. My congratulations, Gaston!... Look, here's a sheet of  paper. Write down: 'It was I who murdered M. Guillaume.' Write, I tell  you!\"    Leaning over the young man, with all his implacable force of will he  compelled him to write, guiding his hand and dictating the sentences.  Dutreuil, exhausted, at the end of his strength, wrote as he was told.    \"Here's the confession, Mr. Chief-inspector,\" said Renine. \"You will be  good enough to take it to M. Dudouis. These gentlemen,\" turning to the  waiters, from the restaurant, \"will, I am sure, consent to serve as  witnesses.\"    And, seeing that Dutreuil, overwhelmed by what had happened, did not move,  he gave him a shake:    \"Hi, you, look alive! Now that you've been fool enough to confess, make an  end of the job, my gentle idiot!\"    The other watched him, standing in front of him.    \"Obviously,\" Renine continued, \"you're only a simpleton. The hat-box was  fairly burnt to ashes: so were the notes. That hat-box, my dear fellow, is  a different one; and those notes belong to me. I even burnt six of them to  make you swallow the stunt. And you couldn't make out what had happened.  What an owl you must be! To furnish me with evidence at the last moment,  when I hadn't a single proof of my own! And such evidence! A written  confession! Written before witnesses!... Look here, my man, if they do cut  off your head--as I sincerely hope they will--upon my word, you'll have  jolly well deserved it! Good-bye, Dutreuil!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Downstairs, in the street, Renine asked Hortense Daniel to take the car, go  to Madeleine Aubrieux and tell her what had happened.    \"And you?\" asked Hortense.    \"I have a lot to do ... urgent appointments....\"    \"And you deny yourself the pleasure of bringing the good news?\"    \"It's one of the pleasures that pall upon one. The only pleasure that never  flags is that of the fight itself. Afterwards, things cease to be  interesting.\"    She took his hand and for a moment held it in both her own. She would have  liked to express all her admiration to that strange man, who seemed to  do good as a sort of game and who did it with something like genius. But  she was unable to speak. All these rapid incidents had upset her. Emotion  constricted her throat and brought the tears to her eyes.    Renine bowed his head, saying:    \"Thank you. I have my reward.\"          III    THE CASE OF JEAN LOUIS      \"Monsieur,\" continued the young girl, addressing Serge Renine, \"it was  while I was spending the Easter holidays at Nice with my father that I made  the acquaintance of Jean Louis d'Imbleval....\"    Renine interrupted her:    \"Excuse me, mademoiselle, but just now you spoke of this young man as Jean  Louis Vaurois.\"    \"That's his name also,\" she said.    \"Has he two names then?\"    \"I don't know ... I don't know anything about it,\" she said, with some  embarrassment, \"and that is why, by Hortense's advice, I came to ask for  your help.\"    This conversation was taking place in Renine's flat on the Boulevard  Haussmann, to which Hortense had brought her friend Genevieve Aymard, a  slender, pretty little creature with a face over-shadowed by an expression  of the greatest melancholy.    \"Renine will be successful, take my word for it, Genevieve. You will,  Renine, won't you?\"    \"Please tell me the rest of the story, mademoiselle,\" he said.    Genevieve continued:    \"I was already engaged at the time to a man whom I loathe and detest. My  father was trying to force me to marry him and is still trying to do so.  Jean Louis and I felt the keenest sympathy for each other, a sympathy that  soon developed into a profound and passionate affection which, I can assure  you, was equally sincere on both sides. On my return to Paris, Jean Louis,  who lives in the country with his mother and his aunt, took rooms in our  part of the town; and, as I am allowed to go out by myself, we used to see  each other daily. I need not tell you that we were engaged to be married. I  told my father so. And this is what he said: 'I don't particularly like the  fellow. But, whether it's he or another, what I want is that you should get  married. So let him come and ask for your hand. If not, you must do as I  say.' In the middle of June, Jean Louis went home to arrange matters with  his mother and aunt. I received some passionate letters; and then just  these few words:        'There are too many obstacles in the way of our happiness. I give up.      I am mad with despair. I love you more than ever. Good-bye and forgive      me.'    \"Since then, I have received nothing: no reply to my letters and  telegrams.\"    \"Perhaps he has fallen in love with somebody else?\" asked Renine. \"Or there  may be some old connection which he is unable to shake off.\"    Genevieve shook her head:    \"Monsieur, believe me, if our engagement had been broken off for an  ordinary reason, I should not have allowed Hortense to trouble you. But it  is something quite different, I am absolutely convinced. There's a mystery  in Jean Louis' life, or rather an endless number of mysteries which hamper  and pursue him. I never saw such distress in a human face; and, from  the first moment of our meeting, I was conscious in him of a grief and  melancholy which have always persisted, even at times when he was giving  himself to our love with the greatest confidence.\"    \"But your impression must have been confirmed by minor details, by things  which happened to strike you as peculiar?\"    \"I don't quite know what to say.\"    \"These two names, for instance?\"    \"Yes, there was certainly that.\"    \"By what name did he introduce himself to you?\"    \"Jean Louis d'Imbleval.\"    \"But Jean Louis Vaurois?\"    \"That's what my father calls him.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Because that was how he was introduced to my father, at Nice, by a  gentleman who knew him. Besides, he carries visiting-cards which describe  him under either name.\"    \"Have you never questioned him on this point?\"    \"Yes, I have, twice. The first time, he said that his aunt's name was  Vaurois and his mother's d'Imbleval.\"    \"And the second time?\"    \"He told me the contrary: he spoke of his mother as Vaurois and of his aunt  as d'Imbleval. I pointed this out. He coloured up and I thought it better  not to question him any further.\"    \"Does he live far from Paris?\"    \"Right down in Brittany: at the Manoir d'Elseven, five miles from Carhaix.\"    Renine rose and asked the girl, seriously:    \"Are you quite certain that he loves you, mademoiselle?\"    \"I am certain of it and I know too that he represents all my life and all  my happiness. He alone can save me. If he can't, then I shall be married  in a week's time to a man whom I hate. I have promised my father; and the  banns have been published.\"    \"We shall leave for Carhaix, Madame Daniel and I, this evening,\" said  Renine.    That evening he and Hortense took the train for Brittany. They reached  Carhaix at ten o'clock in the morning; and, after lunch, at half past  twelve o'clock they stepped into a car borrowed from a leading resident of  the district.    \"You're looking a little pale, my dear,\" said Renine, with a laugh, as they  alighted by the gate of the garden at Elseven.    \"I'm very fond of Genevieve,\" she said. \"She's the only friend I have. And  I'm feeling frightened.\"    He called her attention to the fact that the central gate was flanked by  two wickets bearing the names of Madame d'Imbleval and Madame Vaurois  respectively. Each of these wickets opened on a narrow path which ran among  the shrubberies of box and aucuba to the left and right of the main avenue.  The avenue itself led to an old manor-house, long, low and picturesque, but  provided with two clumsily-built, ugly wings, each in a different style of  architecture and each forming the destination of one of the side-paths.  Madame d'Imbleval evidently lived on the left and Madame Vaurois on the  right.    Hortense and Renine listened. Shrill, hasty voices were disputing inside  the house. The sound came through one of the windows of the ground-floor,  which was level with the garden and covered throughout its length with red  creepers and white roses.    \"We can't go any farther,\" said Hortense. \"It would be indiscreet.\"    \"All the more reason,\" whispered Renine. \"Look here: if we walk straight  ahead, we shan't be seen by the people who are quarrelling.\"    The sounds of conflict were by no means abating; and, when they reached the  window next to the front-door, through the roses and creepers they could  both see and hear two old ladies shrieking at the tops of their voices and  shaking their fists at each other.    The women were standing in the foreground, in a large dining-room where  the table was not yet cleared; and at the farther side of the table sat a  young man, doubtless Jean Louis himself, smoking his pipe and reading a  newspaper, without appearing to trouble about the two old harridans.    One of these, a thin, tall woman, was wearing a purple silk dress; and her  hair was dressed in a mass of curls much too yellow for the ravaged face  around which they tumbled. The other, who was still thinner, but quite  short, was bustling round the room in a cotton dressing-gown and displayed  a red, painted face blazing with anger:    \"A baggage, that's what you are!\" she yelped. \"The wickedest woman in the  world and a thief into the bargain!\"    \"I, a thief!\" screamed the other.    \"What about that business with the ducks at ten francs apiece: don't you  call that thieving?\"    \"Hold your tongue, you low creature! Who stole the fifty-franc note from my  dressing-table? Lord, that I should have "]]]
