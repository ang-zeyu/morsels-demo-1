[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7144"],[0,"While the Billy Boils (#10)"],[1,"pass  a lot of their time in the house. They mark the circle described by the  broom, and take care to keep two or three inches beyond it. Every now  and then you see a fowl on the dresser amongst the crockery, and there  is great concern to get it out before it breaks something. While dinner  is in progress two steers get into the wheat through a broken rail which  has been spliced with stringy-bark, and a calf or two break into  the vineyard. And yet this careless Australian selector, who is too  shiftless to put up a decent fence, or build a decent house and who  knows little or nothing about farming, would seem by his conversation  to have read up all the great social and political questions of the  day. Here are some fragments of conversation caught at the  dinner-table. Present--the selector, the missus, the neighbour,  Corney George--nicknamed \"Henry George\"--Tommy, Jacky, and the younger  children. The spaces represent interruptions by the fowls and children:    Corney George (continuing conversation): \"But Henry George says, in  'Progress and Poverty,' he says--\"    Missus (to the fowls): \"Shoo! Shoo!\"    Corney: \"He says--\"    Tom: \"Marther, jist speak to this Jack.\"    Missus (to Jack): \"If you can't behave yourself, leave the table.\"    Tom [Corney, probably]: \"He says in Progress and--\"    Missus: \"Shoo!\"    Neighbour: \"I think 'Lookin' Backwards' is more--\"    Missus: \"Shoo! Shoo! Tom, can't you see that fowl?\"    Selector: \"Now I think 'Caesar's Column' is more likely--Just look at--\"    Missus: \"Shoo! Shoo!\"    Selector: \"Just look at the French Revolution.\"    Corney: \"Now, Henry George-\"    Tom: \"Marther! I seen a old-man kangaroo up on--\"    Missus: \"Shut up! Eat your dinner an' hold your tongue. Carn't you see  someone's speakin'?\"    Selector: \"Just look at the French--\"    Missus (to the fowls): \"Shoo! Shoo!\" (turning suddenly and unexpectedly  on Jacky): \"Take your fingers out of the sugar!--Blast yer! that I  should say such a thing.\"    Neighbour: \"But 'Lookin' Backwards\"'    Missus: \"There you go, Tom! Didn't I say you'd spill that tea? Go away  from the table!\"    Selector: \"I think 'Caesar's Column' is the only natural--\"    Missus: \"Shoo! Shoo!\" She loses patience, gets up and fetches a young  rooster with the flat of the broom, sending him flying into the yard; he  falls with his head towards the door and starts in again. Later on the  conversation is about Deeming.    Selector: \"There's no doubt the man's mad--\"    Missus: \"Deeming! That Windsor wretch! Why, if I was in the law I'd have  him boiled alive! Don't tell me he didn't know what he was doing! Why,  I'd have him--\"    Corney: \"But, missus, you--\"    Missus (to the fowls): \"Shoo! Shoo!\"        THAT THERE DOG O' MINE      Macquarie the shearer had met with an accident. To tell the truth, he  had been in a drunken row at a wayside shanty, from which he had escaped  with three fractured ribs, a cracked head, and various minor abrasions.  His dog, Tally, had been a sober but savage participator in the drunken  row, and had escaped with a broken leg. Macquarie afterwards shouldered  his swag and staggered and struggled along the track ten miles to the  Union Town hospital. Lord knows how he did it. He didn't exactly know  himself. Tally limped behind all the way, on three legs.    The doctors examined the man's injuries and were surprised at his  endurance. Even doctors are surprised sometimes--though they don't  always show it. Of course they would take him in, but they objected to  Tally. Dogs were not allowed on the premises.    \"You will have to turn that dog out,\" they said to the shearer, as he  sat on the edge of a bed.    Macquarie said nothing.    \"We cannot allow dogs about the place, my man,\" said the doctor in a  louder tone, thinking the man was deaf.    \"Tie him up in the yard then.\"    \"No. He must go out. Dogs are not permitted on the grounds.\"    Macquarie rose slowly to his feet, shut his agony behind his set  teeth, painfully buttoned his shirt over his hairy chest, took up his  waistcoat, and staggered to the corner where the swag lay.    \"What are you going to do?\" they asked.    \"You ain't going to let my dog stop?\"    \"No. It's against the rules. There are no dogs allowed on premises.\"    He stooped and lifted his swag, but the pain was too great, and he  leaned back against the wall.    \"Come, come now! man alive!\" exclaimed the doctor, impatiently. \"You  must be mad. You know you are not in a fit state to go out. Let the  wardsman help you to undress.\"    \"No!\" said Macquarie. \"No. If you won't take my dog in you don't take  me. He's got a broken leg and wants fixing up just--just as much as--as  I do. If I'm good enough to come in, he's good enough--and--and better.\"    He paused awhile, breathing painfully, and then went on.    \"That--that there old dog of mine has follered me faithful and true,  these twelve long hard and hungry years. He's about--about the only  thing that ever cared whether I lived or fell and rotted on the cursed  track.\"    He rested again; then he continued: \"That--that there dog was pupped  on the track,\" he said, with a sad sort of a smile. \"I carried him for  months in a billy, and afterwards on my swag when he knocked up.... And  the old slut--his mother--she'd foller along quite contented--and sniff  the billy now and again--just to see if he was all right.... She follered  me for God knows how many years. She follered me till she was blind--and  for a year after. She follered me till she could crawl along through the  dust no longer, and--and then I killed her, because I couldn't leave her  behind alive!\"    He rested again.    \"And this here old dog,\" he continued, touching Tally's upturned nose  with his knotted fingers, \"this here old dog has follered me for--for  ten years; through floods and droughts, through fair times and--and  hard--mostly hard; and kept me from going mad when I had no mate nor  money on the lonely track; and watched over me for weeks when I was  drunk--drugged and poisoned at the cursed shanties; and saved my life  more'n once, and got kicks and curses very often for thanks; and forgave  me for it all; and--and fought for me. He was the only living thing that  stood up for me against that crawling push of curs when they set onter  me at the shanty back yonder--and he left his mark on some of 'em too;  and--and so did I.\"    He took another spell.    Then he drew in his breath, shut his teeth hard, shouldered his swag,  stepped into the doorway, and faced round again.    The dog limped out of the corner and looked up anxiously.    \"That there dog,\" said Macquarie to the hospital staff in general, \"is a  better dog than I'm a man--or you too, it seems--and a better Christian.  He's been a better mate to me than I ever was to any man--or any man  to me. He's watched over me; kep' me from getting robbed many a time;  fought for me; saved my life and took drunken kicks and curses for  thanks--and forgave me. He's been a true, straight, honest, and faithful  mate to me--and I ain't going to desert him now. I ain't going to kick  him out in the road with a broken leg. I--Oh, my God! my back!\"    He groaned and lurched forward, but they caught him, slipped off the  swag, and laid him on a bed.    Half an hour later the shearer was comfortably fixed up.    \"Where's my dog!\" he asked, when he came to himself.    \"Oh, the dog's all right,\" said the nurse, rather impatiently. \"Don't  bother. The doctor's setting his leg out in the yard.\"          GOING BLIND      I met him in the Full-and-Plenty Dining Rooms. It was a cheap place in  the city, with good beds upstairs let at one shilling per night--\"Board  and residence for respectable single men, fifteen shillings per week.\"  I was a respectable single man then. I boarded and resided there. I  boarded at a greasy little table in the greasy little corner under the  fluffy little staircase in the hot and greasy little dining-room or  restaurant downstairs. They called it dining-rooms, but it was only one  room, and them wasn't half enough room in it to work your elbows when  the seven little tables and forty-nine chairs were occupied. There was  not room for an ordinary-sized steward to pass up and down between the  tables; but our waiter was not an ordinary-sized man--he was a living  skeleton in miniature. We handed the soup, and the \"roast beef one,\" and  \"roast lamb one,\" \"corn beef and cabbage one,\" \"veal and stuffing one,\"  and the \"veal and pickled pork,\" one--or two, or three, as the case  might be--and the tea and coffee, and the various kinds of puddings--we  handed them over each other, and dodged the drops as well as we could.  The very hot and very greasy little kitchen was adjacent, and it  contained the bathroom and other conveniences, behind screens of  whitewashed boards.    I resided upstairs in a room where there were five beds and one  wash-stand; one candle-stick, with a very short bit of soft yellow  candle in it; the back of a hair-brush, with about a dozen bristles in  it; and half a comb--the big-tooth end--with nine and a half teeth at  irregular distances apart.    He was a typical bushman, not one of those tall, straight, wiry, brown  men of the West, but from the old Selection Districts, where many  drovers came from, and of the old bush school; one of those slight  active little fellows whom we used to see in cabbage-tree hats, Crimean  shirts, strapped trousers, and elastic-side boots--\"larstins,\" they  called them. They could dance well; sing indifferently, and mostly  through their noses, the old bush songs; play the concertina horribly;  and ride like--like--well, they _could_ ride.    He seemed as if he had forgotten to grow old and die out with this old  colonial school to which he belonged. They _had_ careless and forgetful  ways about them. His name was Jack Gunther, he said, and he'd come to  Sydney to try to get something done to his eyes.

You must judge how frequently a lesson like  this is needed, and how much parsing should be done orally day by day. In  their +Oral Analysis+ let the pupils give at first the reasons for every  statement, but guard against their doing this mechanically and in set  terms; and, when you think it can safely be done, let them drop it. But ask  now and then, whenever you think they have grown careless or are guessing,  for the reason of this, that, or the other step taken.    Here it may be well to emphasize the fact that the part of speech to which  any word belongs is determined by the use of the word, and not from its  form. Such exercises as the following are suggested:--        Use _right_ words.      Act _right_.      _Right_ the wrong.      You are in the _right_.    Pupils will be interested in finding sentences that illustrate the  different uses of the same word. It is hardly necessary for us to make  lists of words that have different uses. Any dictionary will furnish  abundant examples. It is an excellent practice to point out such words in  the regular exercises for analysis.           *       *       *       *       *    LESSON 27.    REVIEW.

Introductory Hints.+--In saying _Washington captured_, we do not fully  express the act performed by Washington. If we add a noun and say,  _Washington captured Cornwallis_, we complete the predicate by naming that  which receives the act.    Whatever fills out, or completes, is a +Complement+. As _Cornwallis_  completes the expression of the act by naming the thing acted upon--the  object--we call it the +Object Complement+. Connected objects completing  the same verb form a +Compound Object Complement+; as, Washington captured  _Cornwallis_ and his _army_.      +DEFINITION.--The _Object Complement of a Sentence_ completes the  predicate, and names that which receives the act.+    The complement with all its modifiers is called the +Modified Complement.+    +Analysis.+    1.

NOUNS AND ADJECTIVES AS ATTRIBUTE COMPLEMENTS.    +Introductory Hints+.--The subject presents one idea; the predicate  presents another, and asserts it of the first. _Corn is growing_ presents  the idea of the thing, corn, and the idea of the act, growing, and asserts  the act of the thing. _Corn growing_ lacks the asserting word, and _Corn_  is lacks the word denoting the idea to be asserted.    In logic, the asserting word is called the _copula_--it shows that the two  ideas are coupled into a thought--and the word expressing the idea asserted  is called the predicate. But, as one word often performs both offices, e.  g., Corn _grows_, and, as it is disputed whether any word can assert  without expressing something of the idea asserted, we pass this distinction  by as not essential in grammar, and call both that which asserts and that  which expresses the idea asserted, by one name--the predicate. [Footnote:  We may call the verb the predicate; but, when it is followed by a  complement, it is an incomplete predicate.]    The _maple leaves become_. The verb become does not make a complete  predicate; it does not fully express the idea to be asserted. The idea may  be completely expressed by adding the adjective _red_, denoting the quality  we wish to assert of leaves, or attribute to them--_The maple leaves become  red_.    _Lizards are reptiles_. The noun _reptiles_, naming the class of the  animals called lizards, performs a like office for the asserting word are.  _Rolfe's wife was Pocahontas_. _Pocahontas_ completes the predicate by  presenting a second idea, which _was_ asserts to be identical with that of  the subject.    When the completing word expressing the idea to be attributed does not  unite with the asserting word to make a single verb, we distinguish it as  the +Attribute Complement.+ [Footnote: _Subjective Complement_ may, if  preferred, be used instead of Attribute Complement.] Connected attribute  complements of the same verb form a +Compound Attribute Complement+.    Most grammarians call the adjective and the noun, when so used, the  +Predicate Adjective+ and the +Predicate Noun+.      +DEFINITION.--The _Attribute Complement_ of a Sentence completes the  predicate and belongs to the subject.+    Analysis.    1. Slang is vulgar.      Slang   |   is   \\ vulgar  ==========|=================            |    +Explanation+.--The line standing for the attribute complement is, like the  object line, a continuation of the predicate line; but notice that the line  which separates the incomplete predicate from the complement slants toward  the subject to show that the complement is an attribute of it.    +Oral Analysis+.--_Vulgar_ is the attribute complement, completing the  predicate and expressing a quality of slang; _is vulgar_ is the entire  predicate.    2. The sea is fascinating and treacherous.  3. The mountains are grand, tranquil, and lovable.  4. The Saxon words in English are simple, homely, and substantial.  5. The French and the Latin words in English are elegant, dignified, and     artificial. [Footnote: The assertion in this sentence is true only in     the main.]  6. The ear is the ever-open gateway of the soul.  7. The verb is the life of the sentence.  8. Good-breeding is surface-Christianity.  9. A dainty plant is the ivy green.    +Explanation+.--The subject names that of which the speaker says something.  The terms in which he says it,--the predicate,--he, of course, assumes that  the hearer already understands. Settle, then, which--plant or ivy--Dickens  supposed the reader to know least about, and which, therefore, Dickens was  telling him about; and you settle which word--_plant_ or _ivy_--is the  subject. (Is it not the writer's poetical conception of \"the green ivy\"  that the reader is supposed not to possess?)    10. The highest outcome of culture is simplicity.  11. Stillness of person and steadiness of features are signal marks of      good-breeding.  12. The north wind is full of courage, and puts the stamina of endurance      into a man.  13.
