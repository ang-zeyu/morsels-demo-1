This was Cockyloo, the good chick; but the black one was named  Peck, and was a quarrelsome bad fowl, as we shall see.    Mrs. Partlet, the mamma, was very proud of her fine family; for the  eight little daughters were all white and very pretty. She led them out  into the farmyard, clucking and scratching busily; for all were hungry,  and ran chirping round her to pick up the worms and seeds she found for  them. Cocky soon began to help take care of his sisters; and when a nice  corn or a fat bug was found, he would step back and let little Downy or  Snowball have it. But Peck would run and push them away, and gobble up  the food greedily. He chased them away from the pan where the meal was,  and picked the down off their necks if they tried to get their share.  His mother scolded him when the little ones ran to hide under her wings;  but he didn't care, and was very naughty. Cocky began to crow when he  was very young, and had such a fine voice that people liked to hear  his loud, clear \"Cock-a-doodle-doo!\" early in the morning; for he woke  before the sun was up, and began his song. Peck used to grumble at being  roused at dawn, for he was lazy; but the hens bustled up, and were glad  to get out of the hen-house.    The father cock had been killed by a dog; so they made Cocky king of the  farmyard, and Peck was very jealous of him.    \"I came out of the shell first, and I am the oldest; so I ought to be  king,\" he said.    \"But we don't like you, because you are selfish, cross, and lazy. We  want Cocky; he is so lively, kind, and brave. He will make a splendid  bird, and _he_ must be our king,\" answered the hens; and Peck had to  mind, or they would have pulled every feather out of his little tail.    He resolved to do some harm to his good brother, and plagued him all he  could. One day, when Cocky was swinging with three of his sisters on a  bush that hung over the brook, Peck asked a stupid donkey feeding near  to come and put his heavy foot on the bush. He did it, and crack went  the branch, splash went the poor chicks into the water, and all were  drowned but Cocky, who flew across and was saved. Poor little Hop,  Chirp, and Downy went floating down the brook like balls of white foam,  and were never seen again. All the hens mourned for them, and put a  black feather in their heads to show how sorry they were. Mamma Partlet  was heart-broken to lose three darlings at once; but Cocky comforted  her, and never told how it happened, because he was ashamed to have  people know what a bad bird Peck was.    A butterfly saw it all, and he told Granny Cockletop about it; and the  hens were so angry that they turned Peck out of the barnyard, and he had  to go and live in the woods alone. He said he didn't care; but he did,  and was very unhappy, and used to go and peep into the pleasant field  where the fowls scratched and talked together. He dared not show  himself, for they would have driven him out. But kind Cocky saw him, and  would run with some nice bit and creep through the fence into the wood,  saying,--\"Poor brother, I'm sorry for you, and I'll come and play with  you, and tell you the news.\"    Now in this wood lived a fox, and he had been planning to eat Peck as  soon as he was fat; for he missed the good corn and meal he used to  have, and grew very thin living on grasshoppers and berries. While he  waited the sly fellow made friends with Peck, though the bird knew that  foxes ate hens.    \"I'm not afraid, and I don't believe old Granny Cockletop's tales. I  can take care of myself, I guess,\" he said, and went on playing with  the fox, who got him to tell all about the hen-house,--how the door was  fastened, and where the plump chickens roosted, and what time they went  to bed,--so that he could creep in and steal a good supper by and by.  Silly Peck never guessed what harm he was doing, and only laughed when  Cocky said,--    \"You will be sorry if you play with the fox. He is a bad fellow; so be  careful and sleep on a high branch, and keep out of his way, as I do.\"    Cocky was fat and large, and the fox longed to eat him, but never could,  because he wisely ran home whenever he saw the rogue hiding in the wood.  This made Peck angry, for he wanted his brother to stay and play; and  so one day, when Cocky ran off in the midst of a nice game, Peck said to  the fox,--    \"See here, if you want to catch that fellow, I'll tell you how to do it.  He has promised to bring me some food to-night, when all the rest are  at roost. He will hide and not get shut up; then, when those cross old  biddies are asleep, he will cluck softly, and I am to go in and eat all  I want out of the pan. You hide on the top of the hen-house; and while  he talks to me, you can pounce on him. Then I shall be the only cock  here, and they will have to make me king.\"    \"All right,\" said the fox, much pleased with the plan, and very glad  that Peck had a chance to get fatter.    So when it was night, Peck crept through the broken paling and waited  till he heard the signal. Now, good Cocky had saved up nice bits from  his own dinner, and put them in a paper hidden under a bush. He spread  them all out in the barnyard and called; and Peck came in a great hurry  to eat them, never stopping to say, \"Thank you.\"    Cocky stood by talking pleasantly till a little shower came up.    \"Peck, dear, put this nice thick paper over you; then you will be dry,  and can go on eating. I'll step under that burdock leaf and wait till  you are done,\" said Cocky; and Peck was too busy gobbling up the food to  remember anything else.    Now the fox had just crept up on the hen-house roof; and when he peeped  down, there was just light enough to see a white thing bobbing about.    \"Ah, ha! that's Cockyloo; now for a good supper!\" And with a jump he  seized Peck by the head before he could explain the mistake.    One squawk, and the naughty bird was dead; but though the paper fell  off, and the fox saw what he had done, it was too late, and he began to  eat Peck up, while Cocky flew into a tree and crowed so loud that the  farmer ran with his gun and shot the fox before he could squeeze through  the hole in the fence with the fowl in his mouth.    After that the hens felt safe, for there were no more foxes; and when  they heard about Peck they did not mourn at all, but liked Cocky better  than ever, and lived happily together, with nothing to trouble them.    King Cockyloo grew to be a splendid bird,--pure white, with a tall red  comb on his head, long spurs on his yellow legs, many fine feathers in  his tail, and eyes that shone like diamonds. His crow was so loud that  it could be heard all over the neighborhood, and people used to say,  \"Hark! hear Farmer Hunt's cock crow. Isn't it a sweet sound to wake us  in the dawn?\" All the other cocks used to answer him, and there was a  fine matinee concert every day.    He was a good brother, and led his five little sisters all about the  field, feeding, guarding, and amusing them; for mamma was lame now, and  could not stir far from the yard. It was a pretty sight to see Cocky run  home with a worm in his bill or a nice berry, and give it to his mother,  who was very proud of her handsome son. Even old Granny Cockletop, who  scolded about everything, liked him; and often said, as the hens sat  scuffling in the dust,--    \"A fine bird, my dears, a very fine bird, and I know he will do  something remarkable before he dies.\"    She was right for once; and this is what he did.    One day the farmer had to go away and stay all night, leaving the old  lady alone with two boys. They were not afraid; for they had a gun, and  quite longed for a chance to fire it. Now it happened that the farmer  had a good deal of money in the house, and some bad men knew it; so they  waited for him to go away that they might steal it. Cocky was picking  about in the field when he heard voices behind the wall, and peeping  through a hole saw two shabby men hiding there.    \"At twelve, to-night, when all are asleep, we will creep in at the  kitchen window and steal the money. You shall watch on the outside and  whistle if any one comes along while I'm looking for the box where the  farmer keeps it,\" said one man.    \"You needn't be afraid; there is no dog, and no one to wake the family,  so we are quite safe,\" said the other man; and then they both went to  sleep till night came.    Cocky was much troubled, and didn't know what to do. He could not tell  the old lady about it; for he could only cackle and crow, and she would  not understand that language. So he went about all day looking very  sober, and would not chase grasshoppers, play hide-and-seek under the  big burdock leaves, or hunt the cricket with his sisters. At sunset he  did not go into the hen-house with the rest, but flew up to the shed  roof over the kitchen, and sat there in the cold ready to scare the  robbers with a loud crow, as he could do nothing else.    At midnight the men came creeping along; one stopped outside, and the  other went in. Presently he handed a basket of silver out, and went back  for the money. Just as he came creeping along with the box, Cocky gave a  loud, long crow, that frightened the robbers and woke the boys. The man  with the basket ran away in such a hurry that he tumbled into a well;  the other was going to get out of the window, when Cocky flew down and  picked at his eyes and flapped his wings in his face, so that he turned  to run some other way, and met the boys, who fired at him and shot him  in the legs. The old lady popped her head out of the upper window and  rang the dinner-bell, and called \"Fire! fire!\" so loud that it roused  the neighbors, who came running to see what the trouble could be.    They fished one man out of the well and picked up the wounded one, and  carried them both off to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7439"],[0,"English Fairy Tales (#10)"],[1,"what were their several powers, and their labours, and their names, and  how they might be summoned, and how tasks might be imposed on them, and  how they might be chained to be as slaves to man.    Now the master had a pupil who was but a foolish lad, and he acted as  servant to the great master, but never was he suffered to look into the  black book, hardly to enter the private room.    One day the master was out, and then the lad, as curious as could be,  hurried to the chamber where his master kept his wondrous apparatus  for changing copper into gold, and lead into silver, and where was his  mirror in which he could see all that was passing in the world, and  where was the shell which when held to the ear whispered all the words  that were being spoken by anyone the master desired to know about. The  lad tried in vain with the crucibles to turn copper and lead into gold  and silver--he looked long and vainly into the mirror; smoke and clouds  passed over it, but he saw nothing plain, and the shell to his ear  produced only indistinct murmurings, like the breaking of distant seas  on an unknown shore. \"I can do nothing,\" he said; \"as I don't know the  right words to utter, and they are locked up in yon book.\"    He looked round, and, see! the book was unfastened; the master had  forgotten to lock it before he went out. The boy rushed to it, and  unclosed the volume. It was written with red and black ink, and much of  it he could not understand; but he put his finger on a line and spelled  it through.    At once the room was darkened, and the house trembled; a clap of thunder  rolled through the passage and the old room, and there stood before him  a horrible, horrible form, breathing fire, and with eyes like burning  lamps. It was the demon Beelzebub, whom he had called up to serve him.    \"Set me a task!\" said he, with a voice like the roaring of an iron  furnace.    The boy only trembled, and his hair stood up.    \"Set me a task, or I shall strangle thee!\"    But the lad could not speak. Then the evil spirit stepped towards him,  and putting forth his hands touched his throat. The fingers burned his  flesh. \"Set me a task!\"    \"Water yon flower,\" cried the boy in despair, pointing to a geranium  which stood in a pot on the floor. Instantly the spirit left the room,  but in another instant he returned with a barrel on his back, and poured  its contents over the flower; and again and again he went and came, and  poured more and more water, till the floor of the room was ankle-deep.    \"Enough, enough!\" gasped the lad; but the demon heeded him not; the lad  didn't know the words by which to send him away, and still he fetched  water.    It rose to the boy's knees and still more water was poured. It mounted  to his waist, and Beelzebub still kept on bringing barrels full. It rose  to his armpits, and he scrambled to the table-top. And now the water  in the room stood up to the window and washed against the glass, and  swirled around his feet on the table. It still rose; it reached his  breast. In vain he cried; the evil spirit would not be dismissed, and  to this day he would have been pouring water, and would have drowned  all Yorkshire. But the master remembered on his journey that he had  not locked his book, and therefore returned, and at the moment when  the water was bubbling about the pupil's chin, rushed into the room and  spoke the words which cast Beelzebub back into his fiery home.          TITTY MOUSE AND TATTY MOUSE    Titty Mouse and Tatty Mouse both lived in a house,    Titty Mouse went a leasing and Tatty Mouse went a leasing,    So they both went a leasing.    Titty Mouse leased an ear of corn, and Tatty Mouse leased an ear of  corn,    So they both leased an ear of corn.    Titty Mouse made a pudding, and Tatty Mouse made a pudding,    So they both made a pudding.    And Tatty Mouse put her pudding into the pot to boil,    But when Titty went to put hers in, the pot tumbled over, and scalded  her to death.    Then Tatty sat down and wept; then a three-legged stool said: \"Tatty,  why do you weep?\" \"Titty's dead,\" said Tatty, \"and so I weep;\" \"then,\"  said the stool, \"I'll hop,\" so the stool hopped.    Then a broom in the corner of the room said, \"Stool, why do you hop?\"  \"Oh!\" said the stool, \"Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and so I hop;\"  \"then,\" said the broom, \"I'll sweep,\" so the broom began to sweep.    \"Then,\" said the door, \"Broom, why do you sweep?\" \"Oh!\" said the broom,  \"Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and the stool hops, and so I sweep;\"  \"Then,\" said the door, \"I'll jar,\" so the door jarred.    \"Then,\" said the window, \"Door, why do you jar?\" \"Oh!\" said the door,  \"Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and the stool hops, and the broom  sweeps, and so I jar.\"    \"Then,\" said the window, \"I'll creak,\" so the window creaked. Now there  was an old form outside the house, and when the window creaked, the form  said: \"Window, why do you creak?\" \"Oh!\" said the window, \"Titty's dead,  and Tatty weeps, and the stool hops, and the broom sweeps, the door  jars, and so I creak.\"    \"Then,\" said the old form, \"I'll run round the house;\" then the old form  ran round the house. Now there was a fine large walnut-tree growing by  the cottage, and the tree said to the form: \"Form, why do you run round  the house?\" \"Oh!\" said the form, \"Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and the  stool hops, and the broom sweeps, the door jars, and the window creaks,  and so I run round the house.\"    \"Then,\" said the walnut-tree, \"I'll shed my leaves,\" so the walnut-tree  shed all its beautiful green leaves. Now there was a little bird perched  on one of the boughs of the tree, and when all the leaves fell, it  said: \"Walnut-tree, why do you shed your leaves?\" \"Oh!\" said the tree,  \"Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, the stool hops, and the broom sweeps,  the door jars, and the window creaks, the old form runs round the house,  and so I shed my leaves.\"    \"Then,\" said the little bird, \"I'll moult all my feathers,\" so he  moulted all his pretty feathers. Now there was a little girl walking  below, carrying a jug of milk for her brothers and sisters' supper,  and when she saw the poor little bird moult all its feathers, she said:  \"Little bird, why do you moult all your feathers?\" \"Oh!\" said the little  bird, \"Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, the stool hops, and the broom  sweeps, the door jars, and the window creaks, the old form runs round  the house, the walnut-tree sheds its leaves, and so I moult all my  feathers.\"    \"Then,\" said the little girl, \"I'll spill the milk,\" so she dropt the  pitcher and spilt the milk. Now there was an old man just by on the top  of a ladder thatching a rick, and when he saw the little girl spill the  milk, he said: \"Little girl, what do you mean by spilling the milk, your  little brothers and sisters must go without their supper.\" Then said  the little girl: \"Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, the stool hops, and the  broom sweeps, the door jars, and the window creaks, the old form runs  round the house, the walnut-tree sheds all its leaves, the little bird  moults all its feathers, and so I spill the milk.\"    \"Oh!\" said the old man, \"then I'll tumble off the ladder and break my  neck,\" so he tumbled off the ladder and broke his neck; and when the old  man broke his neck, the great walnut-tree fell down with a crash, and  upset the old form and house, and the house falling knocked the window  out, and the window knocked the door down, and the door upset the broom,  and the broom upset the stool, and poor little Tatty Mouse was buried  beneath the ruins.          JACK AND HIS GOLDEN SNUFF-BOX    Once upon a time, and a very good time it was, though it was neither in  my time nor in your time nor in any one else's time, there was an old  man and an old woman, and they had one son, and they lived in a great  forest. And their son never saw any other people in his life, but he  knew that there was some more in the world besides his own father and  mother, because he had lots of books, and he used to read every day  about them. And when he read about some pretty young women, he used  to go mad to see some of them; till one day, when his father was out  cutting wood, he told his mother that he wished to go away to look for  his living in some other country, and to see some other people besides  them two. And he said, \"I see nothing at all here but great trees around  me; and if I stay here, maybe I shall go mad before I see anything.\" The  young man's father was out all this time, when this talk was going on  between him and his poor old mother.    The old woman begins by saying to her son before leaving, \"Well, well,  my poor boy, if you want to go, it's better for you to go, and God  be with you.\"--(The old woman thought for the best when she said  that.)--\"But stop a bit before you go. Which would you like best for me  to make you, a little cake and bless you, or a big cake and curse you?\"  \"Dear, dear!\" said he, \"make me a big cake. Maybe I shall be hungry on  the road.\" The old woman made the big cake, and she went on top of the  house, and she cursed him as far as she could see him.    He presently meets with his father, and the old man says to him: \"Where  are you going, my poor boy?\" when the son told the father the same tale  as he told his mother. \"Well,\" says his father, \"I'm sorry to see you  going away, but if you've made your mind to go, it's better for you to  go.\"    The poor lad had not gone far, when his father called him back; then  the old man drew out of his pocket a golden snuff-box, and said to him:  \"Here, take this little box, and put it in your pocket, and be sure not  to open it till you are near your death.\" And away went poor Jack upon  his road, and walked till he was tired and hungry, for he had eaten all  his cake upon the road; and by this time night was upon him, so he could  hardly see his way before him. He could see some light a long way before  him, and he made "]]]
