So that one cannot expect from them free  discussion of the very essence of the question--that is, of the  change in men's life which must result from applying Christ's  teaching to the existing order of the world.  Such free discussion  I only expected from worldly, freethinking critics who are not  bound to Christ's teaching in any way, and can therefore take an  independent view of it.  I had anticipated that freethinking  writers would look at Christ, not merely, like the Churchmen, as  the founder of a religion of personal salvation, but, to express  it in their language, as a reformer who laid down new principles  of life and destroyed the old, and whose reforms are not yet  complete, but are still in progress even now.    Such a view of Christ and his teaching follows from my book. But to my  astonishment, out of the great number of critics of my book there was  not one, either Russian or foreign, who treated the subject from the  side from which it was approached in the book--that is, who criticised  Christ's doctrines as philosophical, moral, and social principles, to  use their scientific expressions. This was not done in a single  criticism. The freethinking Russian critics taking my book as though its  whole contents could be reduced to non-resistance to evil, and  understanding the doctrine of non-resistance to evil itself (no doubt  for greater convenience in refuting it) as though it would prohibit  every kind of conflict with evil, fell vehemently upon this doctrine,  and for some years past have been very successfully proving that  Christ's teaching is mistaken in so far as it forbids resistance to  evil. Their refutations of this hypothetical doctrine of Christ were all  the more successful since they knew beforehand that their arguments  could not be contested or corrected, for the censorship, not having  passed the book, did not pass articles in its defense.    It is a remarkable thing that among us, where one cannot say a  word about the Holy Scriptures without the prohibition of the  censorship, for some years past there have been in all the  journals constant attacks and criticisms on the command of Christ  simply and directly stated in Matt. v. 39.  The Russian advanced  critics, obviously unaware of all that has been done to elucidate  the question of non-resistance, and sometimes even imagining  apparently that the rule of non-resistance to evil had been  invented by me personally, fell foul of the very idea of it.  They  opposed it and attacked it, and advancing with great heat  arguments which had long ago been analyzed and refuted from every  point of view, they demonstrated that a man ought invariably to  defend (with violence) all the injured and oppressed, and that  thus the doctrine of non-resistance to evil is an immoral  doctrine.    To all Russian critics the whole import of Christ's command seemed  reducible to the fact that it would hinder them from the active  opposition to evil to which they are accustomed.  So that the  principle of non-resistance to evil by force has been attacked by  two opposing camps: the conservatives, because this principle  would hinder their activity in resistance to evil as applied to  the revolutionists, in persecution and punishment of them; the  revolutionists, too, because this principle would hinder their  resistance to evil as applied to the conservatives and the  overthrowing of them.  The conservatives were indignant at the  doctrine of non-resistance to evil by force hindering the  energetic destruction of the revolutionary elements, which may  ruin the national prosperity; the revolutionists were indignant at  the doctrine of non-resistance to evil by force hindering the  overthrow of the conservatives, who are ruining the national  prosperity.  It is worthy of remark in this connection that the  revolutionists have attacked the principle of non-resistance to  evil by force, in spite of the fact that it is the greatest terror  and danger for every despotism.  For ever since the beginning of  the world, the use of violence of every kind, from the Inquisition  to the Schlusselburg fortress, has rested and still rests on the  opposite principle of the necessity of resisting evil by force.    Besides this, the Russian critics have pointed out the fact that  the application of the command of non-resistance to practical life  would turn mankind aside out of the path of civilization along  which it is moving.  The path of civilization on which mankind in  Europe is moving is in their opinion the one along which all  mankind ought always to move.    So much for the general character of the Russian critics.    Foreign critics started from the same premises, but their  discussions of my book were somewhat different from those of  Russian critics, not only in being less bitter, and in showing  more culture, but even in the subject-matter.    In discussing my book and the Gospel teaching generally, as it is  expressed in the Sermon on the Mount, the foreign critics  maintained that such doctrine is not peculiarly Christian  (Christian doctrine is either Catholicism or Protestantism  according to their views)--the teaching of the Sermon on the Mount  is only a string of very pretty impracticable dreams DU CHARMANT  DOCTEUR, as Reran says, fit for the simple and half-savage  inhabitants of Galilee who lived eighteen hundred years ago, and  for the half-savage Russian peasants--Sutaev and Bondarev--and the  Russian mystic Tolstoy, but not at all consistent with a high  degree of European culture.    The foreign freethinking critics have tried in a delicate manner,  without being offensive to me, to give the impression that my  conviction that mankind could be guided by such a naive doctrine  as that of the Sermon on the Mount proceeds from two causes: that  such a conviction is partly due to my want of knowledge, my  ignorance of history, my ignorance of all the vain attempts to  apply the principles of the Sermon on the Mount to life, which  have been made in history and have led to nothing; and partly it  is due to my failing to appreciate the full value of the lofty  civilization to which mankind has attained at present, with its  Krupp cannons, smokeless powder, colonization of Africa, Irish  Coercion Bill, parliamentary government, journalism, strikes, and  the Eiffel Tower.    So wrote de Vogue and Leroy Beaulieu and Matthew Arnold; so wrote  the American author Savage, and Ingersoll, the popular  freethinking American preacher, and many others.    \"Christ's teaching is no use, because it is inconsistent with our  industrial age,\" says Ingersoll naively, expressing in this  utterance, with perfect directness and simplicity, the exact  notion of Christ's teaching held by persons of refinement and  culture of our times.  The teaching is no use for our industrial  age, precisely as though the existence of this industrial age were  a sacred fact which ought not to and could not be changed.  It is  just as though drunkards when advised how they could be brought to  habits of sobriety should answer that the advice is incompatible  with their habit of taking alcohol.    The arguments of all the freethinking critics, Russian and foreign  alike, different as they may be in tone and manner of  presentation, all amount essentially to the same strange  misapprehension--namely, that Christ's teaching, one of the  consequences of which is non-resistance to evil, is of no use to  us because it requires a change of our life.    Christ's teaching is useless because, if it were carried into practice,  life could not go on as at present; we must add: if we have begun by  living sinfully, as we do live and are accustomed to live. Not only is  the question of non-resistance to evil not discussed; the very mention  of the fact that the duty of non-resistance enters into Christ's  teaching is regarded as satisfactory proof of the impracticability of  the whole teaching.    Meanwhile one would have thought it was necessary to point out at  least some kind of solution of the following question, since it is  at the root of almost everything that interests us.    The question amounts to this: In what way are we to decide men's  disputes, when some men consider evil what others consider good,  and VICE VERSA?  And to reply that that is evil which I think  evil, in spite of the fact that my opponent thinks it good, is not  a solution of the difficulty.  There can only be two solutions:  either to find a real unquestionable criterion of what is evil or  not to resist evil by force.    The first course has been tried ever since the beginning of  historical times, and, as we all know, it has not hitherto led to  any successful results.    The second solution--not forcibly to resist what we consider evil  until we have found a universal criterion--that is the solution  given by Christ.    We may consider the answer given by Christ unsatisfactory; we may  replace it by another and better, by finding a criterion by which  evil could be defined for all men unanimously and simultaneously;  we may simply, like savage nations, not recognize the existence of  the question.  But we cannot treat the question as the learned  critics of Christianity do.  They pretend either that no such  question exists at all or that the question is solved by granting  to certain persons or assemblies of persons the right to define  evil and to resist it by force.  But we know all the while that  granting such a right to certain persons does not decide the  question (still less so when we are ourselves the certain  persons), since there are always people who do not recognize this  right in the authorized persons or assemblies.    But this assumption, that what seems evil to us is really evil,  shows a complete misunderstanding of the question, and lies at the  root of the argument of freethinking critics about the Christian  religion.

So we came through Tuscany to Siena, and found her all agog with  excitement for the Palio, with pennons flying and music echoing  down her streets, and her inns already full to overflowing.    Ah, Siena, with your gaunt red palaces and your lily tower, and  your ineffectual walls which thread the vineyards like old men  dreaming life away in memories, it is you who are the heart of  Tuscany! You are not pale and beautiful like Florence, not such a  great lady; nor have you the silent grace of Pisa, but how lovable,  how intimate you are! Their dignity would ill become you with your  stormy and undignified past, of which De Commines said: 'La Ville  est de tout temps en partialite, et se gouverne plus follement  qu'aucune Ville d'Italie.'    [Illustration: SIENA: TORRE DEL MANGIA.]    But in no other place is the traveller welcomed with such song and  laughter as in Siena, when she holds high festival. I, who have  only seen her in her Palio days, cannot think that life is ever  dull or languid in her streets and _piazze_. I have peopled her  with mediaeval ghosts since that day in mid-August when I woke and  found them in possession. At every sound of music I look round  for silken banners, and pretty boys in doublet and hose escorting  steel-clad warriors, or the gay spendthrifts of whom Folgore of  San Gimignano sang. For on that day I caught a glimpse of the  Middle Ages, with their knights and pages and their companies of  men-at-arms. I heard the brave music of their drums, and saw the  old Siena, ruddy and black-browed, clamouring loud-voiced in the  Piazza del Campo--a happy child one moment, and the next a bundle  of conflicting passions, remembering century-old grievances, and  raking up dead feuds to make a Tuscan holiday.    [Illustration: SIENA: TORCH-REST.]    It was in the Piazza del Campo, or to give it its modern name which  does not please me half as much, the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele,  that I grew to know Siena best. Here she was the city of the  Quattrocento, of which I love to dream, fantastic and beautiful,  with untold possibilities lurking behind the walls of her tall red  palaces. The Campo lies in the hollow where the three hills of  Siena meet, and its shape is an irregular semi-circle. I can best  describe it by saying that it is like an enormous cockle, slightly  concave--rose-coloured, for it is paved with red brick--and with  ribs or flutings of grey stone which converge towards the deepest  hollow in front of the Palazzo Pubblico. Encircle this by a wide,  flagged roadway, and ring it round with noble palaces, many of  them of great beauty, with Gothic arch and lancet window. At the  deepest hollow of the shell build up a palace for the rulers of  the most unruly republic in the whole peninsula. Fashion it of  exceeding beauty with a facade which follows the curve of the  piazza. Build it of Siena's red brick; break its long lines with  Gothic windows cloven by slender columns; grace it with magnificent  arched doors; decorate it with scutcheons and crests; and high on  its wall place the golden monogram of Holy Flame which Bernardino,  Siena's gentlest saint, identified with his life. At its side  build an arcaded chapel of white marble, stained by time, filled  with the faded frescoes of Il Sodoma; and from this chapel picture  yourself a tower, not like the tower of any city out of Tuscany,  which springs up into the heavens with the natural grace of growing  things, so that you do not think of it as brick or stone, but as  some beautiful and splendid flower which grew up in one mediaeval  night while Siena slept, and has blossomed ever since.    Even Florence cannot show the like of this. It is so beautiful and  characteristic that it is worthy of mention beside the Piazzetta  of St. Mark's at Venice. And at night it is a revelation of the  Middle Ages to pass from the Via Cavour, with its lighted shops and  its gay streams of men and women, into the dim and romantic Campo.  Night covers the passing of time. The song and laughter of modern  Sienese life, flowing down to the Lizza to promenade, comes like an  echo across the years. It is very still in the Campo at night, and  empty except perhaps for Beppo, the seller of water-melons, whose  guttering candle suffices to show his pink and succulent wares. But  one evening while we stood in the shadow of the Palazzo Comunale we  heard some stray musicians singing an old choir-chant in the Via  del Casato. It was as though the ghosts of pilgrims were toiling  up the Via dei Pellegrini, just as they used to do, past the great  ruined palace of Il Magnifico, to lay their troubles at the feet  of the Queen of Sorrows. Overhead the Torre del Mangia, released  from the shadows of the battlemented court, soared up to the  stars more like a lily than ever with the moonlight silvering its  machicolations. And we remembered that in the morning we had seen  it with its head in the drifting clouds, and the sunlight below.    But it was not only for its mediaeval beauty that we loved the  Campo. This is Siena's heart. Here she has fought and loved and  hated and rejoiced, ay, and died too. And if her stones have been  too often stained with blood in civil warfare she has gentler  memories--here Provenzano Salvani, the victor of Monte Aperto,  cast all dignity aside 'when at his glory's topmost height,' and  begged for alms to ransom a friend who languished in some foreign  prison; here Bernardino preached so eloquently of Divine Love that  he almost moved the unregenerate young Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini,  afterwards Pius II., to repentance. And here, while the armies of  Spain were beleaguering their city, and they were faint for food,  the youths of Siena came to play their games till they were called  back to guard the city walls, to the joy and amazement of Blaise  de Montluc, the French Governor, who never tired of praising the  Sienese for their chivalry and the courage and beauty of their  women.    Here, too, in a few days' time, came Siena and all the strangers  that were within her gates to see the Palio!    [Illustration: A STREET IN SIENA.]    The _Prove_ were run first. Early in the week a sandtrack was  prepared, and as if by magic an amphitheatre of seats sprang  up round the piazza. There are six of these _prove_, or trial  races, for the selection of horses for the Palio; and they are  run on the evening of the 13th, the morning and evening of the  two following days, and the morning of the 16th of August.[7] The  Palio festivities really begin on the 13th of August, for although  the Sienese do not attend the _prove_ in great numbers there are  generally some thousand spectators who shout themselves hoarse with  excitement; and feeling sometimes runs high when there is rivalry  between ancient enemies like the _contrade_ of the Oca and the  Torre.    On that morning, too, the streets are full of peasants driving  their white oxen in pairs before them to the annual fair, which  is still held outside the Porta Camollia in honour of our Lady  of Mid-August. It has dwindled considerably from the seven days'  _fiera_ which marked the occasion in the Middle Ages, but it is  still a picturesque sight. The peasants drive standing up, like  Roman charioteers, behind their milk-white steers, whose heads are  bound with scarlet fillets, and their soft dewlaps girdled by  a bell. The sellers of water-melons do a thriving business with  the thirsty drovers, and the piazza is a sea of tossing horns and  smooth white backs from the battlemented city wall to the column  which marks the spot where Leonora of Portugal met her betrothed,  the Emperor Frederick III.    On Sunday Siena was comparatively quiet, although there were  _prove_ in the Piazza del Campo both morning and evening, and a  general air of merriment throughout the city. We heard mass in the  cathedral where the banners of the various _contrade_ hung from  the piers of the nave; and the wonderful graffito pavement which,  according to a seventeenth-century custom, is covered with boards  for the rest of the year to preserve it from injury, was laid bare.  And then we went down to Fontebranda to see how the _Contrada_ of  the Oca, Saint Catherine's _contrada_, was preparing for the Palio.  We found it delightfully confident of victory. The sacristan of  Saint Catherine's house took us into the chapel which was once her  father's workshop, and would not let us go until we had heard the  history of the many Palii which the victorious Oca had won in past  years--assisted no doubt by the prayers of Santa Caterina in heaven  to the holy Mother of God.    [Illustration: SIENA: S. DOMENICO AND THE VIA BENINCASA.]    The philosopher loves Fontebranda. To him it is the most romantic  spot in Siena. It is certainly one of the most picturesque, whether  you stand at the head of the steep Via Benincasa and see San  Domenico's gaunt red walls towering above its houses, or whether  you look towards the city from the church. A winding road leads up  through gardens from the Valley of Fontebranda to the city gate.  Above the wall tall, green-shuttered palaces rise tier on tier to  the cathedral, whose delicately arcaded dome and tower crown the  hill. To the right the loggia'd houses of the tanners sweep down  the Via Benincasa to Fontebranda's mediaeval fountain; and the  keen, unpleasant smell of the tanneries, which was one of the first  things we noticed in Siena, is everywhere. Fontebranda is changed  but little since the days when Saint Catherine lived there with  her parents. Then as now it was full of tanneries, then as now the  men worked half in their dark windowless shops and half out in the  street: in her day the loggia'd houses were here; the yellow skins  were drying in the road; and San Domenico, up whose hill she toiled  to prayer, was the same grim fortress-church as now.
