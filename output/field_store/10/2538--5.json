Acid stains and scars could not hide the beauty of those  mobile hands, the hands of an artist and a dreamer. An artist Dr. Bird  was, albeit his artistry expressed itself in the most delicate and  complicated experiments in the realms of pure and applied science that  the world has ever seen, rather than in the commoner forms of art.    The doctor finished his task of weighing a porcelain crucible, set it  carefully into a dessicator, and turned to his friend.    \"What's on your mind, Carnes?\" he asked. \"You look worried. Is there  another counterfeit on the market?\"    The operative shook his head.    \"Have you been reading those stories that the papers have been carrying  about Mammoth Cave?\" he asked.    Dr. Bird emitted a snort of disgust.    \"I read the first one of them part way through on the strength of its  being an Associated Press dispatch,\" he replied, \"but that was enough.  It didn't exactly impress me with its veracity, and, from a viewpoint of  literature, the thing was impossible. I have no time to pore over the  lucubrations of an inspired press agent.\"    \"So you dismissed them as mere press agent work?\"    \"Certainly. What else could they be? Things like that don't happen  fortuitously just as the tourist season is about to open. I suppose that  those yarns will bring flocks of the curious to Kentucky though: the  public always responds well to sea serpent yarns.\"    \"Mammoth Cave has been closed to visitors for the season,\" said Carnes  quietly.    \"What?\" cried the doctor in surprise. \"Was there really something to  those wild yarns?\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"There was, and what is more to the point, there still is. At least  there is enough to it that I am leaving for Kentucky this evening, and I  came here for the express purpose of asking you whether you wanted to  come along. Bolton suggested that I ask you: he said that the whole  thing sounded to him like magic and that magic was more in your line  than in ours. He made out a request for your services and I have it in  my pocket now. Are you interested?\"    \"How does the secret service cut in on it?\" asked the doctor. \"It seems  to me that it is a state matter. Mammoth Cave isn't a National Park.\"    \"Apparently you haven't followed the papers. It _was_ a state matter  until the Governor asked for federal troops. Whenever the regulars get  into trouble, the federal government is rather apt to take a hand.\"    \"I didn't know that regulars had been sent there. Tell me about the  case.\"    \"Will you come along?\"    Dr. Bird shook his head slowly.    \"I really don't see how I can spare the time, Carnes,\" he said. \"I am in  the midst of some work of the utmost importance and it hasn't reached  the stage where I can turn it over to an assistant.\"    \"Then I won't bother you with the details,\" replied Carnes as he rose.    \"Sit down, confound you!\" cried the doctor. \"You know better than to try  to pull that on me. Tell me your case, and then I'll tell you whether  I'll go or not. I can't spare the time, but, on the other hand, if it  sounds interesting enough....\"           *       *       *       *       *    Carnes laughed.    \"All right, Doctor,\" he said, \"I'll take enough time to tell you about  it even if you can't go. Do you know anything about it?\"    \"No. I read the first story half way through and then stopped. Start at  the beginning and tell me the whole thing.\"    \"Have you ever been to Mammoth Cave?\"    \"No.\"    \"It, or rather they, for while it is called Mammoth Cave it is really a  series of caves, are located in Edmonson County in Central Kentucky, on  a spur railroad from Glasgow Junction on the Louisville and Nashville  Railroad. They are natural limestone caverns with the customary  stalactite and stalagmite formation, but are unusually large and very  beautiful. The caves are quite extensive and they are on different  levels, so that a guide is necessary if one wants to enter them and be  at all sure of finding the way out. Visitors are taken over a regular  route and are seldom allowed to visit portions of the cave off these  routes. Large parts of the cave have never been thoroughly explored or  mapped. So much for the scene.    \"About a month ago a party from Philadelphia who were motoring through  Kentucky, entered the cave with a regular guide. The party consisted of  a man and his wife and their two children, a boy of fourteen and a girl  of twelve. They went quite a distance back into the caves and then, as  the mother was feeling tired, she and her husband sat down, intending to  wait until the guide showed the children some sights which lay just  ahead and then return to them. The guide and the children never  returned.\"    \"What happened?\"    \"No one knows. All that is known is the bare fact that they have not  been seen since.\"    \"A kidnapping case?\"    \"Apparently not, in the light of later happenings, although that was at  first thought to be the explanation. The parents waited for some time.  The mother says that she heard faint screams in the distance some ten  minutes after the guide and the children left, but they were very far  away and she isn't sure that she heard them at all. At any rate, they  didn't impress her at the time.           *       *       *       *       *    \"When half an hour had passed they began to feel anxious, and the father  took a torch and started out to hunt for them. The usual thing happened;  he got lost. When _he_ failed to return, the mother, now thoroughly  alarmed, made her way, by some uncanny sense of direction, to the  entrance and gave the alarm. In half an hour a dozen search parties were  on their way into the cave. The father was soon located, not far from  the beaten trail, but despite three days of constant search, the  children were not located. The only trace of them that was found was a  bracelet which the mother identified. It was found in the cavern some  distance from the beaten path and was broken, as though by violence.  There were no other signs of a struggle.    \"When the bracelet was found, the kidnapping theory gained vogue, for  John Harrel, the missing guide, knew the cave well and natives of the  vicinity scouted the idea that he might be lost. Inspired by the large  reward offered by the father, fresh parties began to explore the unknown  portions of the cave. And then came the second tragedy. Two of the  searchers failed to return. This time there seemed to be little doubt of  violence, for screams and a pistol shot were faintly heard by other  searchers, together with a peculiar 'screaming howl,' as it was  described by those who heard it. A search was at once made toward the  spot where the bracelet had been picked up, and the gun of one of the  missing men was found within fifty yards of the spot where the bracelet  had been discovered. One cylinder of the revolver had been discharged.\"    \"Were there any signs on the floor?\"    \"The searchers said that the floor appeared to be rather more moist and  slimy than usual, but that was all. They also spoke of a very faint  smell of musk, but this observation was not confirmed by others who  arrived a few moments later.\"    \"What happened next?\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"The Governor was appealed to and a company of the National Guard was  sent from Louisville to Mammoth Cave. They took up camp at the mouth of  the cave and prevented everyone from entering. Soldiers armed with  service rifles penetrated the caverns, but found nothing. Visitors were  excluded, and the guardsmen established regular patrols and sentry posts  in the cave with the result that one night, when time came for a relief,  the only trace that could be found of one of the guards was his rifle.  It had not been fired. Double guards were then posted, and nothing  happened for several days--and then another sentry disappeared. His  companion came rushing out of the cave screaming. When he recovered, he  admitted that both he and the missing man had gone to sleep and that he  awoke to find his comrade gone. He called, and he says that the answer  he received was a peculiar whistling noise which raised all the hair on  the back of his neck. He flashed his electric torch all around, but  could see nothing. He swears, however, that he heard a slipping, sliding  noise approaching him, and he felt that some one was looking at him. He  stood it as long as he could and then threw down his rifle and ran for  his life.\"    \"Had he been drinking?\"    \"No. It wasn't delirium either, as was shown by the fact that a patrol  found his gun where he had thrown it, but no trace of the other sentry.  After this second experience, the guardsmen weren't very eager to enter  the cave, and the Governor asked for regulars. A company of infantry was  ordered down from Fort Thomas to relieve the guardsmen, but they fared  worse than their predecessors. They lost two men the first night of  their guard. The regulars weren't caught napping, for the main guard  heard five shots fired. They rushed a patrol to the scene and found both  of the rifles which had been fired, but the men were gone.    \"The officer of the day made a thorough search of the vicinity and  found, some two hundred yards from the spot where the sentries had been  posted, a crack in the wall through which the body of a man could be  forced. This bodycrack had fresh blood on each side of it. Several of  his men volunteered to enter the hole and search, but the lieutenant  would not allow it. Instead, he armed himself with a couple of  hand-grenades and an electric torch and entered himself. That was last  Tuesday, and he has not returned.\"    \"Was there any disturbance heard from the crack?\"    \"None at all. A guard was posted with two machine-guns pointed at the  crack in the wall, and a guard of eight men and a sergeant stationed  there. Last night, about six o'clock, while the guard were sitting  around their guns,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41533"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 6 (of 6) (#10)"],[1," _ib._    Damiani, Felice, da Gubbio, his works from 1586 to 1606. _MS._ ii. 162.
