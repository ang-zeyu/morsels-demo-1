It almost makes me long to sail away in a  gallant barque.\"    There were other cases in connection with the rotten-egging of  Capitalistic candidates on the Imperial Hotel balcony, and it was partly  on the evidence of Douglas and his friends that certain respectable  Labour leaders got heavy terms of imprisonment for rioting and  \"sedition\" and \"inciting,\" in connection with organized attacks on  blacklegs and their escorts.    Retribution, if it was retribution, came suddenly and in a most  unexpected manner to Lord Douglas.    It seems he employed a second carpenter for six months to repair and  make certain additions to the hotel, and put him off under various  pretences until he owed him a hundred pounds or thereabout. At last,  immediately after an exciting interview with Lord Douglas, the carpenter  died suddenly of heart disease. The widow, a strong-minded bushwoman,  put a bailiff in the hotel on a very short notice--and against the  advice of her lawyer, who thought the case hopeless--and the Lord  Douglas bubble promptly burst. He had somehow come to be regarded as the  proprietor of the hotel, but now the real proprietors or proprietor--he  was still said to be a priest--turned Douglas out and put in a new  manager. The old servants were paid after some trouble. The local  storekeepers and one or two firms in Sydney, who had large accounts  against the Imperial Hotel (and had trusted it, mainly because it was  patronized by Capitalism and Fat), were never paid.    Lord Douglas cleared out to Sydney, leaving his wife and children, for  the present, with her brother, a hay-and-corn storekeeper, who also had  a large and hopeless account against the hotel; and when the brother  went broke and left the district she rented a two-roomed cottage and  took in dressmaking.    Dressmaking didn't pay so well in the bush then as it did in the old  diggings days when sewing-machines were scarce and the possession of one  meant an independent living to any girl--when diggers paid ten shillings  for a strip of \"flannen\" doubled over and sewn together, with holes for  arms and head, and called a shirt. Mrs Douglas had a hard time, with her  two little girls, who were still better and more prettily dressed than  any other children in Bourke. One grocer still called on her for orders  and pretended to be satisfied to wait \"till Mr Douglas came back,\" and  when she would no longer order what he considered sufficient provisions  for her and the children, and commenced buying sugar, etc., by the  pound, for cash, he one day sent a box of groceries round to her. He  pretended it was a mistake.    \"However,\" he said, \"I'd be very much obliged if you could use 'em,  Mrs Douglas. I'm overstocked now; haven't got room for another tin of  sardines in the shop. Don't you worry about bills, Mrs Douglas; I can  wait till Douglas comes home. I did well enough out of the Imperial  Hotel when your husband had it, and a pound's worth of groceries won't  hurt me now. I'm only too glad to get rid of some of the stock.\"    She cried a little, thought of the children, and kept the groceries.    \"I suppose I'll be sold up soon meself if things don't git brighter,\"  said that grocer to a friend, \"so it doesn't matter much.\"    The same with Foley the butcher, who had a brogue with a sort of  drawling groan in it, and was a cynic of the Mitchell school.    \"You see,\" he said, \"she's as proud as the devil, but when I send round  a bit o' rawst, or porrk, or the undercut o' the blade-bawn, she thinks  o' the little gur-r-rls before she thinks o' sendin' it back to me.  That's where I've got the pull on her.\"    The Giraffe borrowed a horse and tip-dray one day at the beginning of  winter and cut a load of firewood in the bush, and next morning, at  daylight, Mrs Douglas was nearly startled out of her life by a crash at  the end of the cottage, which made her think that the chimney had fallen  in, or a tree fallen on the house; and when she slipped on a wrapper and  looked out, she saw a load of short-cut wood by the chimney, and caught  a glimpse of the back view of the Giraffe, who stood in the dray with  his legs wide apart and was disappearing into the edge of the scrub; and  soon the rapid clock-clock-clock of the wheels died away in the west, as  if he were making for West Australia.    The next we heard of Lord Douglas he had got two years' hard for  embezzlement in connection with some canvassing he had taken up. Mrs  Douglas fell ill--a touch of brain-fever--and one of the labourers'  wives took care of the children while two others took turns in nursing.  While she was recovering, Bob Brothers sent round the hat, and, after a  conclave in the Union Office--as mysterious as any meeting ever called  with the object of downing bloated Capitalism--it was discovered that  one of the chaps--who didn't wish his name to be mentioned--had borrowed  just twenty-five pounds from Lord Douglas in the old days and now wished  to return it to Mrs Douglas. So the thing was managed, and if she had  any suspicions she kept them to herself. She started a little fancy  goods shop and got along fairly comfortable.    Douglas, by the way, was, publicly, supposed, for her sake and because  of the little girls, to be away in West Australia on the goldfields.      Time passes without much notice out back, and one hot day, when the sun  hung behind the fierce sandstorms from the northwest as dully lurid as  he ever showed in a London fog, Lord Douglas got out of the train that  had just finished its five-hundred-miles' run, and not seeing a new-chum  porter, who started forward by force of habit to take his bag, he walked  stiffly off the platform and down the main street towards his wife's  cottage.    He was very gaunt, and his eyes, to those who passed him closely, seemed  to have a furtive, hunted expression. He had let his beard grow, and it  had grown grey.    It was within a few days of Christmas--the same Christmas that we lost  the Pretty Girl in the Salvation Army. As a rule the big shearing-sheds  within a fortnight of Bourke cut out in time for the shearers to reach  the town and have their Christmas dinners and sprees--and for some of  them to be locked up over Christmas Day--within sound of a church-going  bell. Most of the chaps gathered in the Shearers' Union Office on New  Year's Eve and discussed Douglas amongst other things.    \"I vote we kick the cow out of the town!\" snarled One-eyed Bogan,  viciously.    \"We can't do that,\" said Bob Brothers (the Giraffe), speaking more  promptly than usual. \"There's his wife and youngsters to consider, yer  know.\"    \"He something well deserted his wife,\" snarled Began, \"an' now he comes  crawlin' back to her to keep him.\"    \"Well,\" said Mitchell, mildly, \"but we ain't all got as much against him  as you have, Began.\"    \"He made a crimson jail-bird of me!\" snapped Bogan. \"Well,\" said  Mitchell, \"that didn't hurt you much, anyway; it rather improved  your character if anything. Besides, he made a jail-bird of himself  afterwards, so you ought to have a fellow-feeling--a feathered feeling,  so to speak. Now you needn't be offended, Bogan, we're all jail-birds at  heart, only we haven't all got the pluck.\"    \"I'm in favour of blanky well tarrin' an' featherin' him an' kickin' him  out of the town!\" shouted Bogan. \"It would be a good turn to his wife,  too; she'd be well rid of the----.\"    \"Perhaps she's fond of him,\" suggested Mitchell; \"I've known such cases  before. I saw them sitting together on the veranda last night when they  thought no one was looking.\"    \"He deserted her,\" said One-eyed Bogan, in a climbing-down tone, \"and  left her to starve.\"    \"Perhaps the police were to blame for that,\" said Mitchell. \"You know  you deserted all your old mates once for three months, Bogan, and it  wasn't your fault.\"    \"He seems to be a crimson pet of yours, Jack Mitchell,\" said Bogan,  firing up.    \"Ah, well, all I know,\" said Mitchell, standing up and stretching  himself wearily, \"all I know is that he looked like a gentleman once,  and treated us like a gentleman, and cheated us like a gentleman, and  ran some of us in like a gentleman, and, as far as I can see, he's  served his time like a gentleman and come back to face us and  live himself down like a man. I always had a sneaking regard for a  gentleman.\"    \"Why, Mitchell, I'm beginning to think you are a gentleman yourself,\"  said Jake Boreham.    \"Well,\" said Mitchell, \"I used to have a suspicion once that I had a  drop of blue blood in me somewhere, and it worried me a lot; but I asked  my old mother about it one day, and she scalded me--God bless her!--and  father chased me with a stockwhip, so I gave up making inquiries.\"    \"You'll join the bloomin' Capitalists next,\" sneered One-eyed Bogan.    \"I wish I could, Bogan,\" said Mitchell. \"I'd take a trip to Paris and  see for myself whether the Frenchwomen are as bad as they're made out to  be, or go to Japan. But what are we going to do about Douglas?\"    \"Kick the skunk out of town, or boycott him!\" said one or two. \"He ought  to be tarred and feathered and hanged.\"    \"Couldn't do worse than hang him,\" commented Jake Boreham, cheerfully.    \"Oh, yes, we could,\" said Mitchell, sitting down, resting his elbows on  his knees, and marking his points with one forefinger on the other. \"For  instance, we might boil him slow in tar. We might skin him alive. We  might put him in a cage and poke him with sticks, with his wife and  children in another cage to look on and enjoy the fun.\"    The chaps, who had been sitting quietly listening to Mitchell, and  grinning, suddenly became serious and shifted their positions uneasily.    \"But I can tell you what would hurt his feelings more than anything else  we could do,\" said Mitchell.    \"Well, what is it, Jack?\" said Tom Hall,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7070"],[0,"The Treasure of the Incas: A Story of Adventure in Peru (#10)"],[1,"away on the north, and that if  he is not there, Senor Pasquez, to whom I have a letter, will be likely  to tell me where he is to be found, for he is often employed by him.  However, I am as anxious as you to see him. As it is only eleven  o'clock yet, there is no reason why we should not go to Miraflores.  They will get mules for us at the hotel, and tell us which road to  take.\"    It was not necessary, however, to go into the hotel, for when they  returned, two or three men with mules were waiting to be hired. They  engaged two animals, and as the man of whom they hired them had a  third, and he was ready to accompany them for a small fee, they agreed  to take him with them.    Before they were a mile out of the town the mist cleared off and the  sun shone brightly. The heat, however, was by no means too great to be  pleasant. Miraflores was a charming village, or rather small town,  nestling among gardens and orchards.    \"I want to find a muleteer named Dias Otero,\" Harry said to their guide  as they rode into the place.    \"I know him well,\" he said. \"Everyone about here knows Dias. His wife  was a cousin of my mother's.\"    \"Do you know whether he is at home now?\"    \"Yes, senor; I saw him in Lima three days ago. He had just come down  from the mountains. He had been away two months, and certainly will not  have started again so soon. Shall I lead you to his house at once?\"    \"Do so; it is to see him that I have come to this town. He worked for a  long time with a friend of mine some years ago, and I have brought a  message from him. I may be some time talking with him, so when I go in  you can tie up your mules for a while.\"    \"That is his house,\" the man said presently.    It lay in the outskirts of the town, and was neater than the generality  of houses, and the garden was a mass of flowers. They dismounted,  handed over the mules to their owner, and walked to the door. An Indian  of some five-and-forty years came out as they did so.    \"Are you Dias Otero?\" Harry asked.    \"The same, senor.\"    \"I have just arrived from England, and bring a letter to you from Senor  Barnett, with whom you travelled for two or three years some time ago.\"    The man's face lit up with pleasure. \"Will you enter, senor. Friends of  Senor Barnett may command my services in any way. It is a delight to  hear from him. He writes to me sometimes, but in these troubles letters  do not always come. I love the senor; there never was a kinder master.  He once saved my life at the risk of his own. Is there any hope of his  coming out again?\"    \"I do not think so, Dias. He is strong and well, but I do not think he  is likely to start again on a journey of exploration. He is my greatest  friend. My brother and I were left under his charge when we were young,  and he has been almost a father to us. It is he who has sent us out to  you. Here is his letter.\"    \"Will you read it to me, senor. I cannot read; I am always obliged to  get somebody to read my letters, and write answers for me.\"    The letter was of course in Spanish, and Harry read:    \"Dear friend Dias,    \"I am sending out to you a gentleman, Mr. Prendergast, an officer of  the British Navy, in whom I am deeply interested. His brother  accompanies him. I beg that you will treat them as you would me, and  every service you can render him consider as rendered to myself. From a  reason which he will no doubt explain to you in time, it is of the  deepest importance to him that he should grow rich in the course of the  next two years. He asked my advice, and I said to him, 'There is no one  I know of who could possibly put you in the way of so doing better than  my friend Dias Otero. I believe it is in his power to do so if he is  willing.' I also believe that for my sake you will aid him. He will  place himself wholly in your hands. He does not care what danger he  runs, or what hardships he has to go through in order to attain his  purpose. I know that I need not say more to you. He has two years  before him; long before that I am sure you will be as interested in him  as you were in me. He has sufficient means to pay all expenses of  travel for the time he will be out there. I know that you are descended  from nobles of high rank at the court of the Incas when the Spaniards  arrived, and that secrets known to but few were passed down from father  to son in your family. If you can use any of those secrets to the  advantage of my friend, I pray you most earnestly to do so. I trust  that this letter will find you and your good wife in health. Had I been  ten years younger I would have come out with my friends to aid them in  their adventure, but I know that in putting them into your hands I  shall be doing them a vastly greater service than I could do were I  able to come in person.\"    When Harry ceased, the Indian sat for some time without speaking, then  he said:    \"It is a matter that I must think over, senor. It is a very grave one,  and had any other man than Senor Barnett asked this service of me no  money could have tempted me to assent to it. It is not only that my  life would be in danger, but that my name would be held up to  execration by all my people were I to divulge the secret that even the  tortures of the Spaniards could not wring from us. I must think it over  before I answer. I suppose you are staying at the Hotel Morin; I will  call and see you when I have thought the matter over. It is a grave  question, and it may be three or four days before I can decide.\"    \"I thank you, Dias; but there is no occasion for you to give a final  decision now. Whether or no, we shall travel for a while, and I trust  that you will go with us with your mules and be our guide, as you did  to Mr. Barnett. It will be time enough when you know us better to give  us a final answer; it is not to be expected that even for Senor  Barnett's sake you would do this immense service for strangers,  therefore I pray you to leave the matter open. Make arrangements for  your mules and yourself for a three months' journey in the mountains,  show us what there is to see of the gold and silver placers, and the  quicksilver mines at Huanuco. At the end of that time you will know us  and can say whether you are ready to aid us in our search.\"    The native bowed his head gravely.    \"I will think it over,\" he said; \"and now, senors, let us put that  aside. My wife has been busy since you entered in preparing a simple  meal, and I ask you to honour me by partaking of it.\"    \"With pleasure, Dias.\"    It consisted of _puchero_, a stew consisting of a piece of beef,  cabbage, sweet-potatoes, salt pork, sausage-meat, pigs' feet, yuccas,  bananas, quinces, peas, rice, salt, and an abundance of Chili peppers.  This had been cooked for six hours and was now warmed up. Two bottles  of excellent native wine, a flask of spirits, and some water were also  put on the table. The Indian declined to sit down with them, saying  that he had taken a meal an hour before.    While they ate he chatted with them, asking questions of their voyage  and telling them of the state of things in the country.    \"It is always the same, senors, there is a revolution and two or three  battles; then either the president or the one who wants to be president  escapes from the country or is taken and shot, and in a day or two  there is a fresh pronunciamiento. We thought that when the Spaniards  had been driven out we should have had peace, but it is not so; we have  had San Martin, and Bolivar, and Aguero, and Santa Cruz, and Sucre.  Bolivar again finally defeated the Spaniards at Ayacucho. Rodil held  possession of Callao castle, and defended it until January of this  year. We in the villages have not suffered--those who liked fighting  went out with one or other of the generals; some have returned, others  have been killed--but Lima has suffered greatly. Sometimes the people  have taken one side, sometimes the other, and though the general they  supported was sometimes victorious for a short time, in the end they  suffered. Most of the old Spanish families perished; numbers died in  the castle of Callao, where many thousands of the best blood of Lima  took refuge, and of these well-nigh half died of hunger and misery  before Rodil surrendered.\"    \"But does not this make travelling very unsafe?\"    The Indian shrugged his shoulders.    \"Peru is a large country, senor, and those who want to keep out of the  way of the armies and lighting can do so; I myself have continued my  occupation and have never fallen in with the armies. That is because  the fighting is principally in the plains, or round Cuzco; for the men  do not go into the mountains except as fugitives, as they could not  find food there for an army. It is these fugitives who render the road  somewhat unsafe; starving men must take what they can get. They do not  interfere with the great silver convoys from Potosi or other mines--a  loaf of bread is worth more than a bar of silver in the mountains--but  they will plunder persons coming down with goods to the town or going  up with their purchases. Once or twice I have had to give up the food I  carried with me, but I have had little to grumble at, and I do not  think you need trouble yourself about them; we will take care to avoid  them as far as possible.\"    After chatting for an hour they left the cottage, and, mounting their  mules, returned to Lima.    \"I think he will help us, Harry,\" Bertie said as soon as they set out.    \"I think so too, but we must not press him to begin with. Of course  there is a question too as to how far he can help us. He may know  vaguely where the rich mines once existed; but you must remember that  they have been lost for three hundred years, and it may be impossible  for even a man who has received the traditions as to their positions to  hit upon the precise spot. The mountains, you see, are tremendous;  there must be innumerable ravines and gorges among them. It is"]]]
