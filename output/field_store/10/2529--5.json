[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4075"],[0,"The Intrusion of Jimmy (#10)"],[1," was not to be stopped. The gad-fly was vexing  him, and he had to move.    For a year, he had wandered, realizing every day the truth of  Horace's philosophy for those who travel, that a man cannot change  his feelings with his climate, until finally he had found himself,  as every wanderer does, at Charing Cross.    At this point, he had tried to rally. Such running away, he told  himself, was futile. He would stand still and fight the fever in  him.    He had been fighting it now for a matter of two weeks, and already  he was contemplating retreat. A man at luncheon had been talking  about Japan--    Watching the crowd, Jimmy had found his attention attracted chiefly  by a party of three, a few tables away. The party consisted of a  girl, rather pretty, a lady of middle age and stately demeanor,  plainly her mother, and a light-haired, weedy young man in the  twenties. It had been the almost incessant prattle of this youth and  the peculiarly high-pitched, gurgling laugh which shot from him at  short intervals that had drawn Jimmy's notice upon them. And it was  the curious cessation of both prattle and laugh that now made him  look again in their direction.    The young man faced Jimmy; and Jimmy, looking at him, could see that  all was not well with him. He was pale. He talked at random. A  slight perspiration was noticeable on his forehead.    Jimmy caught his eye. There was a hunted look in it.    Given the time and the place, there were only two things that could  have caused this look. Either the light-haired young man had seen a  ghost, or he had suddenly realized that he had not enough money to  pay the check.    Jimmy's heart went out to the sufferer. He took a card from his  case, scribbled the words, \"Can I help?\" on it, and gave it to a  waiter to take to the young man, who was now in a state bordering on  collapse.    The next moment, the light-haired one was at his table, talking in a  feverish whisper.    \"I say,\" he said, \"it's frightfully good of you, old chap! It's  frightfully awkward. I've come out with too little money. I hardly  like to--you've never seen me before--\"    \"Don't rub in my misfortunes,\" pleaded Jimmy. \"It wasn't my fault.\"    He placed a five-pound note on the table.    \"Say when,\" he said, producing another.    \"I say, thanks fearfully,\" the young man said. \"I don't know what  I'd have done.\" He grabbed at the note. \"I'll let you have it back  to-morrow. Here's my card. Is your address on your card? I can't  remember. Oh, by Jove, I've got it in my hand all the time.\" The  gurgling laugh came into action again, freshened and strengthened by  its rest. \"Savoy Mansions, eh? I'll come round to-morrow. Thanks  frightfully again, old chap. I don't know what I should have done.\"    \"It's been a treat,\" said Jimmy, deprecatingly.    The young man flitted back to his table, bearing the spoil. Jimmy  looked at the card he had left. \"Lord Dreever,\" it read, and in the  corner the name of a well-known club. The name Dreever was familiar  to Jimmy. Everyone knew of Dreever Castle, partly because it was one  of the oldest houses in England, but principally because for  centuries it had been advertised by a particularly gruesome ghost-story.  Everyone had heard of the secret of Dreever, which was known  only to the earl and the family lawyer, and confided to the heir at  midnight on his twenty-first birthday. Jimmy had come across the  story in corners of the papers all over the States, from New York to  Onehorseville, Iowa. He looked with interest at the light-haired  young man, the latest depository of the awful secret. It was  popularly supposed that the heir, after hearing it, never smiled  again; but it did not seem to have affected the present Lord Dreever  to any great extent. His gurgling laugh was drowning the orchestra.  Probably, Jimmy thought, when the family lawyer had told the  light-haired young man the secret, the latter's comment had been, \"No,  really? By Jove, I say, you know!\"    Jimmy paid his bill, and got up to go.    It was a perfect summer night--too perfect for bed. Jimmy strolled  on to the Embankment, and stood leaning over the balustrade, looking  across the river at the vague, mysterious mass of buildings on the  Surrey side.    He must have been standing there for some time, his thoughts far  away, when a voice spoke at his elbow.    \"I say. Excuse me, have you--Hullo!\" It was his light-haired  lordship of Dreever. \"I say, by Jove, why we're always meeting!\"    A tramp on a bench close by stirred uneasily in his sleep as the  gurgling laugh rippled the air.    \"Been looking at the water?\" inquired Lord Dreever. \"I have. I often  do. Don't you think it sort of makes a chap feel--oh, you know. Sort  of--I don't know how to put it.\"    \"Mushy?\" said Jimmy.    \"I was going to say poetical. Suppose there's a girl--\"    He paused, and looked down at the water. Jimmy was sympathetic with  this mood of contemplation, for in his case, too, there was a girl.    \"I saw my party off in a taxi,\" continued Lord Dreever, \"and came  down here for a smoke; only, I hadn't a match. Have you--?\"    Jimmy handed over his match-box. Lord Dreever lighted a cigar, and  fixed his gaze once more on the river.    \"Ripping it looks,\" he said.    Jimmy nodded.    \"Funny thing,\" said Lord Dreever. \"In the daytime, the water here  looks all muddy and beastly. Damn' depressing, I call it. But at  night--\" He paused. \"I say,\" he went on after a moment, \"Did you see  the girl I was with at the Savoy?\"    \"Yes,\" said Jimmy.    \"She's a ripper,\" said Lord Dreever, devoutly.    On the Thames Embankment, in the small hours of a summer morning,  there is no such thing as a stranger. The man you talk with is a  friend, and, if he will listen--as, by the etiquette of the place,  he must--you may pour out your heart to him without restraint. It is  expected of you!    \"I'm fearfully in love with her,\" said his lordship.    \"She looked a charming girl,\" said Jimmy.    They examined the water in silence. From somewhere out in the  night came the sound of oars, as the police-boat moved on its  patrol.    \"Does she make you want to go to Japan?\" asked Jimmy, suddenly.    \"Eh?\" said Lord Dreever, startled. \"Japan?\"    Jimmy adroitly abandoned the position of confidant, and seized that  of confider.    \"I met a girl a year ago--only really met her once, and even then--oh,  well! Anyway, it's made me so restless that I haven't been able  to stay in one place for more than a month on end. I tried Morocco,  and had to quit. I tried Spain, and that wasn't any good, either.  The other day, I heard a fellow say that Japan was a pretty  interesting sort of country. I was wondering whether I wouldn't give  it a trial.\"    Lord Dreever regarded this traveled man with interest.    \"It beats me,\" he said, wonderingly. \"What do you want to leg it  about the world like that for? What's the trouble? Why don't you  stay where the girl is?\"    \"I don't know where she is.\"    \"Don't know?\"    \"She disappeared.\"    \"Where did you see her last?\" asked his lordship, as if Molly were a  mislaid penknife.    \"New York.\"    \"But how do you mean, disappeared? Don't you know her address?\"    \"I don't even know her name.\"    \"But dash it all, I say, I mean! Have you ever spoken to her?\"    \"Only once. It's rather a complicated story. At any rate, she's  gone.\"    Lord Dreever said that it was a rum business. Jimmy conceded the  point.    \"Seems to me,\" said his lordship, \"we're both in the cart.\"    \"What's your trouble?\"    Lord Dreever hesitated.    \"Oh, well, it's only that I want to marry one girl, and my uncle's  dead set on my marrying another.\"    \"Are you afraid of hurting your uncle's feelings?\"    \"It's not so much hurting his feelings. It's--oh, well, it's too  long to tell now. I think I'll be getting home. I'm staying at our  place in Eaton Square.\"    \"How are you going? If you'll walk, I'll come some of the way with  you.\"    \"Right you are. Let's be pushing along, shall we?\"    They turned up into the Strand, and through Trafalgar Square into  Piccadilly. Piccadilly has a restful aspect in the small hours. Some  men were cleaning the road with water from a long hose. The swishing  of the torrent on the parched wood was musical.    Just beyond the gate of Hyde Park, to the right of the road, stands  a cabmen's shelter. Conversation and emotion had made Lord Dreever  thirsty. He suggested coffee as a suitable conclusion to the night's  revels.    \"I often go in here when I'm up in town,\" he said. \"The cabbies  don't mind. They're sportsmen.\"    The shelter was nearly full when they opened the door. It was very  warm inside. A cabman gets so much fresh air in the exercise of his  professional duties that he is apt to avoid it in private life. The  air was heavy with conflicting scents. Fried onions seemed to be  having the best of the struggle for the moment, though plug tobacco  competed gallantly. A keenly analytical nose might also have  detected the presence of steak and coffee.    A dispute seemed to be in progress as they entered.    \"You don't wish you was in Russher,\" said a voice.    \"Yus, I do wish I wos in Russher,\" retorted a shriveled mummy of a  cabman, who was blowing patiently at a saucerful of coffee.    \"Why do you wish you was in Russher?\" asked the interlocutor,  introducing a Massa Bones and Massa Johnsing touch into the  dialogue.    \"Because yer can wade over yer knees in bla-a-a-ad there,\" said the  mummy.    \"In wot?\"    \"In bla-a-ad--ruddy bla-a-ad! That's why I wish I wos in Russher.\"    \"Cheery cove that,\" said Lord Dreever. \"I say, can you give us some  coffee?\"    \"I might try Russia instead of Japan,\" said Jimmy, meditatively.    The lethal liquid was brought. Conversation began again. Other  experts gave their views on the internal affairs of Russia. Jimmy  would have enjoyed it more if he had been less sleepy. His back was  wedged comfortably against the wall of the shelter, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40780"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage: King AEthelbert - King George III, 600 A.D. - 1776 (#10)"],[1,"ild, while the child still be within  her, let him pay full compensation for the woman and half compensation  for the child according to the wergeld of the father's kin. Let the  fine payable to the king always be 60 shillings, until the  corresponding simple compensation rises to 30 shillings. When the  simple compensation rises to that level, then let the fine be 120  shillings. Formerly there was a defined fine for a gold-thief, and a  horse-thief and a bee-thief and many special fines greater than others.  Now all are alike except for an illegal slayer and that is 120  shillings.  10. If a man has intercourse with the wife of a 1200 shilling wergeld  man, let him pay in compensation 120 shillings to the husband. For a  600 shilling wergeld man i.e. husband, let him pay in compensation 100  shillings. For a common man [ceorl] i.e. husband, let him make  compensation of 40 shillings.  11. If someone grabs the breast of a common woman, let him compensate  with five shillings. If he throws her to the ground but does not have  sexual intercourse with her, let him compensate with 60 shillings. If  he has sexual intercourse with her let him compensate with sixty  shillings. If some other man had previously lain with her, then let the  compensation be half that. If someone accuse her of complicity, let her  clear herself with an oath guaranteed by sixty hides of land, or  forfeit half the compensation. If this happens to a nobly born woman,  let the compensation increase in proportion to the wergeld.  12. If someone burns or cuts down another person's trees without  permission, let him pay over 5 shillings for each substantial tree, and  thereafter, no matter how many there are, five pence for each tree, and  thirty shillings as a fine.  13. In the course of their joint work felling trees, if someone is  killed by accident, let the tree involved be given to his kin, and let  them remove it off the property within 30 days; otherwise let him  possess it that owns the forest.  14. If someone is born dumb or deaf, so that he can neither deny or  confess his sins, let the father make compensation for his misdeeds.  15. If someone fights or draws his weapon in the presence of an  archbishop, let him make compensation with 150 shillings. If this  occurs before another bishop or royal official [earldorman] let him  make compensation with 100 shillings.  16. If someone steals a cow or mare and drives off a foal or calf, let  him pay over one shilling as well as paying compensation for the adult  animals according to their value.  17. If anyone entrust a child into the keeping of others, and he i.e.  the offspring die while in that guardianship, let him that did the  fostering prove his innocence of any crime if anyone accuse him of it.  18. If anyone grabs at a nun's clothing or breast with sexual intent,  unless with her consent, let him pay double the rate of compensation we  previously arranged for a lay-person. If she commit adultery and she is  a betrothed woman, if she is a commoner, let 60 shillings be paid in  compensation to the guarantor, and let that be in livestock or cattle,  but let no one give any human as part of it. If she be of 600 shilling  wergeld, let 100 shillings be paid in compensation to the guarantor. If  she be of 1200 shilling wergeld, let compensation of 120 shillings be  paid to the guarantor.  19. If anyone lends his weapon to another so that he may kill with it,  they may combine, if they are willing, in the matter of paying the  wergeld. If they are unwilling to co-operate, let him that proffered  the weapon pay a third part of the wergeld and a third part of the  fine. If he i.e. the loaner of the weapon prefer to clear himself and  assert that he knew of no evil-intent in making the loan, he may do so.  20. If someone entrust cattle to another man's monk, without the  approval of the patron if that monk, and it gets lost, let he that  originally owned it suffer the loss.  21. If a priest slay another man, let all that he i.e. the priest  brought into the monastic community be turned over to the possession of  the victim's representatives, and let the bishop unfrock him; then he  shall be removed from the monastery, unless the civil patron interceded  for him.  22. If someone wishes in the local assembly to declare a claim for debt  to the king's officer, and then wishes to cancel it, let him impute  i.e. transfer it to a truer source if he can. If he cannot, let him  forfeit the single value.  23. If a dog rends or bites someone, for the first misdeed let the  owner hand over 6 shillings, if he is still giving it food. For as  second occurrence, let him give 12 shillings, and for a third 30  shillings. If, upon any of these misdeeds, the dog escapes, nonetheless  the penalty proceeds. If the dog commit more misdeeds and he i.e. the  owner still keeps him, let him pay compensation at the level of a full  wergeld as well as wound-compensation according to what he i.e. the dog  has done.  24. If an ox wounds someone, let him i.e. the owner hand the animal  over or come forward with some solution.  25. If someone forces a commoner's slave-woman to sexual intercourse,  let him compensate the owner with 5 shillings and pay 60 shillings  fine. If a male slave compel a female slave to sexual intercourse, let  him atone with his testicles.  26. If someone force an underage woman into sexual intercourse, let the  compensation be as that of an adult person.  27. If someone without kin on his father's side gets into a fight and  kills someone, if he has maternal relatives, let them pay a third part  of the wergeld; and a third part his guild-brethren; for a third part  unpaid let him flee. If he has no maternal relatives, let the  guild-brethren pay a half; for a half unpaid let him flee.  28. If someone kill a man so circumstanced and if he has no kinfolk,  let them pay half the wergeld to the king, half to his guild-brethren.  29. If anyone in a group kills a 200 shilling wergeld man who is  guiltless, let him that acknowledges the blow pay over wergeld and  fine, and let every man who was of the party hand over 30 shillings in  token of his complicity.  30. If it is a case of a 600 shilling wergeld man, let each of them pay  60 shillings as a token of their complicity, and let him that struck  the fatal blow pay wergeld and fine.  31. If he that is killed is a 1200 shilling wergeld man, let each of  them pay 120 shillings, and let the one who struck the fatal blow pay  wergeld and fine. If a group commit this sort of killing, and later  deny responsibility on oath, let them all be accused, and let them pay  over the wergeld as a group, and together pay one fine such as  corresponds to the wergeld.  32. If someone commits slander and it is proved against him, let him  make atonement with no lighter penalty than having is tongue cut out.  It i.e. the tongue must not be redeemed for any lesser value than would  be reckoned in proportion to the wergeld.  33. If someone reproach another with breach of church-witnessed pledge  and wishes to accuse him of not fulfilling any of those pledges that he  gave him, let the accuser make his preliminary oath in four churches,  and the other i.e. the accused, if he wishes to assert his good faith -  let him do that in twelve churches.  34. Also it is laid down for traders that they should produce before  the king's officer at the local assembly those people that they are  taking inland with them, and let it be established how many of them  there are. And let them take only such men as they can afterward be  accountable for at the local assembly. An if they have need of more men  along with them on their journey, let it always be declared, as often  as is necessary, to the king's officer before the assembly.  35. If someone restrains a free man who is innocent, let him pay  compensation of ten shillings. If he flogs him, compensation of twenty  shillings. If he put him to torture compensation of thirty shillings.  If as a humiliation he shave his head like a homolan, let him pay  compensation of ten shillings. If he shaves him i.e. his head like a  priest's, without binding him let him pay compensation of thirty  shillings. If he shaves off his beard, let him pay compensation of  twenty shillings. If he ties him up and then shaves his head like a  priest's, let him pay compensation of sixty shillings.  36. It is established that if someone has a spear over his shoulder and  someone else impales himself upon it, he i.e. the spear-carrier shall  pay the wergeld without any fine. If he is impaled from in front, let  him i.e. the spear-carrier pay the wergeld. If someone accuses him i.e.  the spear-carrier of deliberately doing it, let him assert his  innocence at a rate corresponding to the fine, and by that finish with  the fine. And this applies if the point is above the rest of the shaft;  if they are both level, point and shaft, let it count as no risk.  37. If someone wants to seek a new lord, transferring from one district  to another district, let him do it with the knowledge of the chief  officer to whom he was originally responsible in his shire. If he does  it without his i.e. the officer's knowledge, let him who harbours him  as his follower pay over 120 shillings as a fine. But let him divide  it, paying the king half in the shire where the man was originally  answerable, and half in that he has moved to. If he i.e. the man who  moves had done anything wrong where he came from, let him who receives  him as his follower pay the compensation and a fine of 120 shillings to  the king.  38. If someone starts a fight in front of the king's officer at an  assembly, let him pay compensation of wergeld and a fine, as it is  customary; and as a priority a fine of 120 shillings to the officer  [earldorman] concerned. If he disturb the assembly by drawing a weapon,  let him pay 120 shillings to the officer by way of fine. If something  of this sort occurs before"]]]
