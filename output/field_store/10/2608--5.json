That Miss Dougall writes from intimate acquaintance with the early  history of the Mormons is apparent on every page; that she has followed  the order of events, all acquainted with the history of our people well  know; and if, as she explains in her preface, she has taken \"necessary  liberty with incidents,\" those that she has used have not been  violently wrested, and those invented have not been much out of harmony  with the facts of history.    The point at which her work is vulnerable is the point of view  from which she treats her subject. In studying the character and  achievements of Joseph Smith, she was evidently not ready to accept him  as a prophet truly inspired of God, nor could she accept the theory  of \"conscious invention\" as a reasonable explanation of his life's  work; for, had that been the source of his efforts in rounding a  religion, \"it would not have left sufficient power to carry him through  persecution, in which his life hung in the balance and his cause  appeared to be lost;\" nor could she believe \"that the class of earnest  men who constituted the rank and file of his early following would  have been so long deceived by a deliberate hypocrite.\" \"It appears to  me,\" she explains \"more likely that Smith was genuinely deluded by  the automatic freaks of a vigorous but undisciplined brain, and that  yielding to these, he became confirmed in the hysterical temperament  which always adds to delusion self-deception, and to self-deception,  half-conscious fraud.\" She calls to aid of her theory--and with marked  skill, be it said--the inclination of the times toward superstition.  \"In his day,\" she remarks, \"it was necessary to reject a marvel or  admit its spiritual significance; granting the honest delusion as to  his vision and his book, his only choice lay between counting himself  the sport of devils or the agent of heaven; an optimistic temperament  cast the die.\"    This is Miss Dougall's point of view in the treatment of her subject,  and it is utterly untenable. The facts in which Mormonism had its  origin are of such a character that they cannot be resolved into  delusion or mistake. Either they were truth or conscious, Simon-pure  invention. It is not possible to place the matter on middle ground.  Joseph Smith was either a true prophet or a conscious fraud or villain.  Had his religion found its origin in the visions of his own mind,  without any connection with material objects, as was the case with  Emanuel Sweedenborg, then there would have been room for Miss Dougall's  theory; but the facts in which Mormonism had its origin had to do with  quite a different order of things. The ancient record of America,  revealed to Joseph Smith by an angel, and which was finally given into  his keeping to translate, was no visionary book--no mere creation of an  overwrought brain but actual substance, sensible to touch as to sight,  consisting of golden plates, with length, breadth, and thickness.  Each plate was about seven by eight inches in dimension, and somewhat  thinner than common tin; the whole bound together by rings made a  volume some six inches in thickness. These plates Joseph Smith claimed  to have handled, and during the time they were in his possession--some  two years--he frequently removed them from place to place in the most  matter-of-fact way. Others saw and handled them, also, not only the  three men to whom the angel Moroni exhibited them, and whose testimony  accompanies every Book of Mormon published, but eight other men, whose  testimony is also published in every Book of Mormon, testify that  Joseph Smith showed the plates to them; that they saw and handled  them, and examined the characters engraven thereon. It cannot be said  that Joseph Smith and these men were self-deceived in such things; not  even the \"automatic freaks of a vigorous but undisciplined brain,\"  could delude itself in such matters. The Book of Mormon plates had an  existence, and Joseph Smith and others who testified to the fact saw  and handled them, or they were conscious frauds and lied and conspired  to deceive.    So with many other manifestations which the claims to have received.  Many of them consisted of and conversations with resurrected  personages--men of flesh and bone--who laid their hands upon the head  of Joseph Smith and others who were with him. There was no chance for  self-delusion or mistake to enter into such transactions, and no theory  based upon the idea of Joseph Smith being \"confirmed in the hysterical  temperament\" can explain away these stubborn facts, however well  intentioned or skilfully worked out.    It is to be regretted that Miss Dougall has not extended her studies  of Mormonism beyond the Nauvoo period; had she done so she would have  escaped some errors that now appear in her work, such as treating  seriously the story of the Danite organization, which never had any  existence by reason of any sanction given it by Church authorities. Nor  would she have assumed so largely the ignorance of early converts of  Mormonism, upon which she depends strongly for the working out of her  theory Joseph Smith's character. Here in Utah, in the past, we have had  with us very many of those early converts to Mormonism; some of them  are still with us, and could Miss Dougall have met them she would have  found them people of rather superior intelligence and character, and  not at all the ignorant and superstitious persons they are generally  supposed to have been. Nor would she have committed the blunder of  saying that Mormons revered but one prophet. While it is doubtless true  that Joseph Smith will always hold a pre-eminence among the prophets in  the Church, yet the Mormons believe that all the men who have succeeded  him in the Presidency of the Church have held the same keys of  authority, possessed the same rights, and exercised the same prophetic  powers that were exercised by him.    In conclusion, let me say, it has been suggested that certain \"claims  made for the early followers of Joseph Smith were later repudiated  by members of the sect.\" That is not true, so far as the Church  is concerned. What individual members scattered over the country  formerly occupied by the Saints, but over whom the Church has no  jurisdiction--what they may have repudiated of Joseph Smith's early or  even later teachings we cannot, of course, say; but for the Church,  it can be said that not one of the early claims or teachings of the  Prophet Joseph Smith has ever been repudiated, nor is there any  institution or doctrine of the Church, which did not arise from his  teachings; for all of which he is morally responsible. Such changes  as have taken place are but the natural developments of that which he  founded.    FOREWORD.    This review of Mr. Harry Leon Wilson's book was submitted to several  eastern papers for publication, but was not accepted by any of them.  The refusal of the article by the several eastern publications to  which it was submitted illustrates in a way the difficulties which  the Mormon people have now for a long time met with in correcting the  misrepresentations made of them, and from which they have suffered  so much. Here was a book of no small pretentious the work of a  popular author, pretending to deal with the historical facts and  character of a great people much in the public eye, and very much  maligned and seriously misrepresented by the writer of \"The Lions.\"  Yet no correction of this misrepresentation would be allowed by the  publications to which this review was submitted. Mr. Wilson's book had  a wide circulation, and every consideration of fairness demanded that  the people suffering from its falsehoods should be heard if they asked  for that hearing and presented their case in a proper spirit, and in a  literary style suitable for such a controversy. Of the suitableness of  the article I shall leave the reader to judge. After being rejected by  eastern papers, it was finally published in the Deseret Evening News of  October 5th, 1903.    III.    \"THE LIONS OF THE LORD.\"    I have just read the \"Lions of the Lord,\" by Harry Leon Wilson. An  extended friendly review of it in a leading Utah paper volunteers the  statement that \"Mr. Wilson gained his principal information during a  few weeks' visit in Salt Lake last fall, and some time spent over the  Schroeder Mormon library, now in Iowa.\" No one can doubt the accuracy  of the statement; the treatment of the theme bears every evidence of  the author's hasty and shallow thought upon the subject with which he  attempts to deal. But he \"spent some time over the Schroeder Mormon  library;\" yes, and what is more, he was undoubtedly \"coached\" by Mr.  Schroeder while at work in the library; for the salacious fiction which  that \"gentleman\" of unsavory reputation in Utah used to serve up to the  delectation of the readers of his \"Lucifer's Lantern\" is altogether too  evident in Mr. Wilson's book, and justly entitled him to recognition as  collaborator with Mr. Wilson in its production.    Since inadvertently the source of the author's inspiration and  information is disclosed, a word respecting Mr. Schroeder, the  should-be-recognized collaborator of Mr. Wilson, becomes necessary  in this review. Mr. Schroeder is known to fame in Utah first as a  lawyer who stands under the recorded public censure of the Supreme  Court of the state of Utah for unprofessional conduct, as is witnessed  in the tenth volume of the Utah Reports of the Supreme Court of the  state. Secondly he is known locally as the collector of a library on  Mormonism, in which prominence and preference is given to anti-Mormon  works redolent of that putridity so delectable to men of debased  natures and perverted tastes. Thirdly, and perhaps most prominently,  he is known as the author, proprietor, and publisher of \"Lucifer's  Lantern,\" that may be described as an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4776"],[0,"Political Ideals (#10)"],[1," animals and often leads them to put to death  any markedly peculiar member of the herd.    The next most important is the feeling of insecurity aroused by doubt  as to the beliefs by which we are in the habit of regulating our  lives.  Whoever has tried to explain the philosophy of Berkeley to a  plain man will have seen in its unadulterated form the anger aroused  by this feeling.  What the plain man derives from Berkeley's  philosophy at a first hearing is an uncomfortable suspicion that  nothing is solid, so that it is rash to sit on a chair or to expect  the floor to sustain us.  Because this suspicion is uncomfortable, it  is irritating, except to those who regard the whole argument as merely  nonsense.  And in a more or less analogous way any questioning of what  has been taken for granted destroys the feeling of standing on solid  ground, and produces a condition of bewildered fear.    A third reason which makes men dislike novel opinions is that vested  interests are bound up with old beliefs.  The long fight of the church  against science, from Giordano Bruno to Darwin, is attributable to  this motive among others.  The horror of socialism which existed in  the remote past was entirely attributable to this cause.  But it would  be a mistake to assume, as is done by those who seek economic motives  everywhere, that vested interests are the principal source of anger  against novelties in thought.  If this were the case, intellectual  progress would be much more rapid than it is.    The instinct of conventionality, horror of uncertainty, and vested  interests, all militate against the acceptance of a new idea.  And it  is even harder to think of a new idea than to get it accepted; most  people might spend a lifetime in reflection without ever making a  genuinely original discovery.    In view of all these obstacles, it is not likely that any society at  any time will suffer from a plethora of heretical opinions.  Least of  all is this likely in a modern civilized society, where the conditions  of life are in constant rapid change, and demand, for successful  adaptation, an equally rapid change in intellectual outlook.  There  should be an attempt, therefore, to encourage, rather than discourage,  the expression of new beliefs and the dissemination of knowledge  tending to support them.  But the very opposite is, in fact, the case.  From childhood upward, everything is done to make the minds of men and  women conventional and sterile.  And if, by misadventure, some spark  of imagination remains, its unfortunate possessor is considered  unsound and dangerous, worthy only of contempt in time of peace and of  prison or a traitor's death in time of war.  Yet such men are known to  have been in the past the chief benefactors of mankind, and are the  very men who receive most honor as soon as they are safely dead.    The whole realm of thought and opinion is utterly unsuited to public  control; it ought to be as free, and as spontaneous as is possible to  those who know what others have believed.  The state is justified in  insisting that children shall be educated, but it is not justified in  forcing their education to proceed on a uniform plan and to be  directed to the production of a dead level of glib uniformity.  Education, and the life of the mind generally, is a matter in which  individual initiative is the chief thing needed; the function of the  state should begin and end with insistence on some kind of education,  and, if possible, a kind which promotes mental individualism, not a  kind which happens to conform to the prejudices of government  officials.      III    Questions of practical morals raise more difficult problems than  questions of mere opinion.  The thugs honestly believe it their duty  to commit murders, but the government does not acquiesce.  The  conscientious objectors honestly hold the opposite opinion, and again  the government does not acquiesce.  Killing is a state prerogative; it  is equally criminal to do it unbidden and not to do it when bidden.  The same applies to theft, unless it is on a large scale or by one who  is already rich.  Thugs and thieves are men who use force in their  dealings with their neighbors, and we may lay it down broadly that the  private use of force should be prohibited except in rare cases,  however conscientious may be its motive.  But this principle will not  justify compelling men to use force at the bidding of the state, when  they do not believe it justified by the occasion.  The punishment of  conscientious objectors seems clearly a violation of individual  liberty within its legitimate sphere.    It is generally assumed without question that the state has a right to  punish certain kinds of sexual irregularity.  No one doubts that the  Mormons sincerely believed polygamy to be a desirable practice, yet  the United States required them to abandon its legal recognition, and  probably any other Christian country would have done likewise.  Nevertheless, I do not think this prohibition was wise.  Polygamy is  legally permitted in many parts of the world, but is not much  practised except by chiefs and potentates.  If, as Europeans generally  believe, it is an undesirable custom, it is probable that the Mormons  would have soon abandoned it, except perhaps for a few men of  exceptional position.  If, on the other hand, it had proved a  successful experiment, the world would have acquired a piece of  knowledge which it is now unable to possess.  I think in all such  cases the law should only intervene when there is some injury  inflicted without the consent of the injured person.    It is obvious that men and women would not tolerate having their wives  or husbands selected by the state, whatever eugenists might have to  say in favor of such a plan.  In this it seems clear that ordinary  public opinion is in the right, not because people choose wisely, but  because any choice of their own is better than a forced marriage.  What applies to marriage ought also to apply to the choice of a trade  or profession; although some men have no marked preferences, most men  greatly prefer some occupations to others, and are far more likely to  be useful citizens if they follow their preferences than if they are  thwarted by a public authority.    The case of the man who has an intense conviction that he ought to do  a certain kind of work is peculiar, and perhaps not very common; but  it is important because it includes some very important individuals.  Joan of Arc and Florence Nightingale defied convention in obedience to  a feeling of this sort; reformers and agitators in unpopular causes,  such as Mazzini, have belonged to this class; so have many men of  science.  In cases of this kind the individual conviction deserves the  greatest respect, even if there seems no obvious justification for it.  Obedience to the impulse is very unlikely to do much harm, and may  well do great good.  The practical difficulty is to distinguish such  impulses from desires which produce similar manifestations.  Many  young people wish to be authors without having an impulse to write any  particular book, or wish to be painters without having an impulse to  create any particular picture.  But a little experience will usually  show the difference between a genuine and a spurious impulse; and  there is less harm in indulging the spurious impulse for a time than  in thwarting the impulse which is genuine.  Nevertheless, the plain  man almost always has a tendency to thwart the genuine impulse,  because it seems anarchic and unreasonable, and is seldom able to give  a good account of itself in advance.    What is markedly true of some notable personalities is true, in a  lesser degree, of almost every individual who has much vigor or force  of life; there is an impulse towards activity of some kind, as a rule  not very definite in youth, but growing gradually more sharply  outlined under the influence of education and opportunity.  The direct  impulse toward a kind of activity for its own sake must be  distinguished from the desire for the expected effects of the  activity.  A young man may desire the rewards of great achievement  without having any spontaneous impulse toward the activities which  lead to achievement.  But those who actually achieve much, although  they may desire the rewards, have also something in their nature which  inclines them to choose a certain kind of work as the road which they  must travel if their ambition is to be satisfied.  This artist's  impulse, as it may be called, is a thing of infinite value to the  individual, and often to the world; to respect it in oneself and in  others makes up nine tenths of the good life.  In most human beings it  is rather frail, rather easily destroyed or disturbed; parents and  teachers are too often hostile to it, and our economic system crushes  out its last remnants in young men and young women.  The result is  that human beings cease to be individual, or to retain the native  pride that is their birthright; they become machine-made, tame,  convenient for the bureaucrat and the drill-sergeant, capable of being  tabulated in statistics without anything being omitted.  This is the  fundamental evil resulting from lack of liberty; and it is an evil  which is being continually intensified as population grows more dense  and the machinery of organization grows more efficient.    The things that men desire are many and various: admiration,  affection, power, security, ease, outlets for energy, are among the  commonest of motives.  But such abstractions do not touch what makes  the difference between one man and another.  Whenever I go to the  zoological gardens, I am struck by the fact that all the movements of  a stork have some common quality, differing from the movements of a  parrot or an ostrich.  It is impossible to put in words what the  common quality is, and yet we feel that each thing an animal does is  the"]]]
