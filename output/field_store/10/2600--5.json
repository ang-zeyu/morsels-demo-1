For my part, after the nicest inquiry I could  make, I am not able to discover that anything else is meant by those  words; and I once more entreat the reader to sound his own thoughts, and  not suffer himself to be imposed on by words. If he can conceive it  possible either for his ideas or their archetypes to exist without being  perceived, then I give up the cause; but if he cannot, he will  acknowledge it is unreasonable for him to stand up in defence of he knows  not what, and pretend to charge on me as an absurdity the not assenting  to those propositions which at bottom have no meaning in them.    46. ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM.--It will not be amiss to observe how far  the received principles of philosophy are themselves chargeable  with those pretended absurdities. (1) It is thought strangely absurd  that upon closing my eyelids all the visible objects around me  should be reduced to nothing; and yet is not this what philosophers  commonly acknowledge, when they agree on all hands that light and  colours, which alone are the proper and immediate objects of sight,  are mere sensations that exist no longer than they are perceived?  (2)Again, it may to some perhaps seem very incredible that things should  be every moment creating, yet this very notion is commonly taught in the  schools. For the SCHOOLMEN, though they acknowledge the existence of  Matter, and that the whole mundane fabric is framed out of it, are  nevertheless of opinion that it cannot subsist without the divine  conservation, which by them is expounded to be a continual creation.    47. (3) Further, a little thought will discover to us that though we allow  the existence of Matter or corporeal substance, yet it will unavoidably  follow, FROM THE PRINCIPLES WHICH ARE NOW GENERALLY ADMITTED, that the  PARTICULAR bodies, of what kind soever, do none of them exist whilst they  are not perceived. For, it is evident from sect. II and the following  sections, that the Matter philosophers contend for is an incomprehensible  somewhat, WHICH HAS NONE OF THOSE PARTICULAR QUALITIES WHEREBY THE  BODIES FALLING UNDER OUR SENSES ARE DISTINGUISHED ONE FROM ANOTHER.  (2) But, to make this more plain, it must be remarked that the infinite  divisibility of Matter is now universally allowed, at least by the most  approved and considerable philosophers, who on the received principles  demonstrate it beyond all exception. Hence, it follows there is an  infinite number of parts in each particle of Matter which are not  perceived by sense. The reason therefore that any particular body seems  to be of a finite magnitude, or exhibits only a finite number of parts to  sense, is, not because it contains no more, since in itself it contains  an infinite number of parts, BUT BECAUSE THE SENSE IS NOT ACUTE ENOUGH TO  DISCERN THEM. In proportion therefore as the sense is rendered more  acute, it perceives a greater number of parts in the object, that is, the  object appears greater, and its figure varies, those parts in its  extremities which were before unperceivable appearing now to bound it in  very different lines and angles from those perceived by an obtuser sense.  And at length, after various changes of size and shape, when the sense  becomes infinitely acute the body shall seem infinite. During all which  there is no alteration in the body, but only in the sense. EACH BODY  THEREFORE, CONSIDERED IN ITSELF, IS INFINITELY EXTENDED, AND CONSEQUENTLY  VOID OF ALL SHAPE OR FIGURE. From which it follows that, though we should  grant the existence of Matter to be never so certain, yet it is withal as  certain, the materialists themselves are by their own principles forced  to acknowledge, that neither the particular bodies perceived by sense,  nor anything like them, exists without the mind. Matter, I say, and each  particle thereof, is according to them infinite and shapeless, AND IT IS  THE MIND THAT FRAMES ALL THAT VARIETY OF BODIES WHICH COMPOSE THE VISIBLE  WORLD, ANY ONE WHEREOF DOES NOT EXIST LONGER THAN IT IS PERCEIVED.    48. If we consider it, the objection proposed in sect. 45 will not be  found reasonably charged on the principles we have premised, so as in  truth to make any objection at all against our notions. For, though we  hold indeed the objects of sense to be nothing else but ideas which  cannot exist unperceived; yet we may not hence conclude they have no  existence except only while they are perceived by US, since THERE MAY BE  SOME OTHER SPIRIT THAT PERCEIVES THEM THOUGH WE DO NOT. Wherever bodies  are said to have no existence without the mind, I would not be understood  to mean this or that particular mind, but ALL MINDS WHATSOEVER. It does  not therefore follow from the foregoing principles that bodies are  annihilated and created every moment, or exist not at all during the  intervals between our perception of them.    49. FIFTH OBJECTION.--ANSWER.--Fifthly, it may perhaps be OBJECTED  that if extension and figure exist only in the mind, it follows  that the mind is extended and figured; since extension is a mode or  attribute which (to speak with the schools) is predicated of the  subject in which it exists. I ANSWER, (1) Those qualities are in the  mind ONLY AS THEY ARE PERCEIVED BY IT--that is, not by way of MODE  or ATTRIBUTE, but only by way of IDEA; and it no more follows the  soul or mind is extended, because extension exists in it alone,  than it does that it is red or blue, because those colours are ON  ALL HANDS acknowledged to exist in it, and nowhere else. (2) As to what  philosophers say of subject and mode, that seems very groundless and  unintelligible. For instance, in this proposition \"a die is hard,  extended, and square,\" they will have it that the word die denotes a  subject or substance, distinct from the hardness, extension, and figure  which are predicated of it, and in which they exist. This I cannot  comprehend: to me a die seems to be nothing distinct from those things  which are termed its modes or accidents. And, to say a die is hard,  extended, and square is not to attribute those qualities to a subject  distinct from and supporting them, but only an explication of the meaning  of the word DIE.    50. SIXTH OBJECTION, FROM NATURAL PHILOSOPHY.--ANSWER.--Sixthly,  you will say there have been a great many things explained by  matter and motion; take away these and you destroy the whole  corpuscular philosophy, and undermine those mechanical principles which  have been applied with so much success to account for the PHENOMENA. In  short, whatever advances have been made, either by ancient or modern  philosophers, in the study of nature do all proceed on the supposition  that corporeal substance or Matter doth really exist. To this I ANSWER  that there is not any one PHENOMENON explained on that supposition which  may not as well be explained without it, as might easily be made appear  by an INDUCTION OF PARTICULARS. To explain the PHENOMENA, is all one as  to show why, upon such and such occasions, we are affected with such and  such ideas. But (1) how Matter should operate on a Spirit, or produce any  idea in it, is what no philosopher will pretend to explain; it is  therefore evident there can be no use of Matter in natural philosophy.  Besides, (2) they who attempt to account for things do it not by CORPOREAL  SUBSTANCE, but by figure, motion, and other qualities, which are in truth  no more than mere ideas, and, therefore, cannot be the cause of anything,  as has been already shown. See sect. 25.    51. SEVENTH OBJECTION.--ANSWER.--Seventhly, it will upon this be  demanded whether it does not seem ABSURD TO TAKE AWAY NATURAL CAUSES,  AND ASCRIBE EVERYTHING TO THE IMMEDIATE OPERATION OF SPIRITS? We  must no longer say upon these principles that fire heats, or water  cools, but that a Spirit heats, and so forth. Would not a man be  deservedly laughed at, who should talk after this manner? I ANSWER,  he would so; in such things we ought to THINK WITH THE LEARNED,  AND SPEAK WITH THE VULGAR. They who to demonstration are convinced  of the truth of the Copernican system do nevertheless say \"the sun  rises,\" \"the sun sets,\" or \"comes to the meridian\"; and if they  affected a contrary style in common talk it would without doubt appear  very ridiculous. A little reflexion on what is here said will make it  manifest that the common use of language would receive no manner of  alteration or disturbance from the admission of our tenets.    52. IN THE ORDINARY AFFAIRS OF LIFE, ANY PHRASES MAY BE RETAINED, so long  as they excite in us proper sentiments, or dispositions to act in such a  manner as is necessary for our WELL-BEING, how false soever they may be  if taken in a strict and SPECULATIVE SENSE. Nay, this is unavoidable,  since, propriety being regulated by CUSTOM, language is suited to the  RECEIVED opinions, which are not always the truest. Hence it is  impossible, even in the most rigid, philosophic reasonings, so far to  alter the bent and genius of the tongue we speak, as never to give a  handle for cavillers to pretend difficulties and inconsistencies. But, a  fair and ingenuous reader will collect the sense from the scope and tenor  and connexion of a discourse, making allowances for those inaccurate  modes of speech which use has made inevitable.    53. As to the OPINION THAT THERE ARE NO CORPOREAL CAUSES, this has been  heretofore maintained by some of the Schoolmen, as it is of late by  others among the modern philosophers, who though they allow Matter to  exist, yet will have God alone to be the immediate efficient cause of all  things. These men saw that amongst all the objects of sense there was  none which had any power or activity included in it; and that by  consequence this was likewise true of whatever bodies they supposed to  exist without the mind, like unto the immediate objects of sense. But  then, that they should suppose an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4724"],[0,"Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous in Opposition to Sceptics and (#10)"],[1," natural philosophy, all contemplation of the  contrivance, order, and adjustment of things--an infinite Mind should be  necessarily inferred from the bare EXISTENCE OF THE SENSIBLE WORLD, is  an advantage to them only who have made this easy reflexion: that the  sensible world is that which we perceive by our several senses; and that  nothing is perceived by the senses beside ideas; and that no idea  or archetype of an idea can exist otherwise than in a mind. You may now,  without any laborious search into the sciences, without any subtlety of  reason, or tedious length of discourse, oppose and baffle the most  strenuous advocate for Atheism. Those miserable refuges, whether in an  eternal succession of unthinking causes and effects, or in a fortuitous  concourse of atoms; those wild imaginations of Vanini, Hobbes, and  Spinoza: in a word, the whole system of Atheism, is it not entirely  overthrown, by this single reflexion on the repugnancy included in  supposing the whole, or any part, even the most rude and shapeless, of  the visible world, to exist without a mind? Let any one of those abettors  of impiety but look into his own thoughts, and there try if he can  conceive how so much as a rock, a desert, a chaos, or confused jumble of  atoms; how anything at all, either sensible or imaginable, can exist  independent of a Mind, and he need go no farther to be convinced of his  folly. Can anything be fairer than to put a dispute on such an issue, and  leave it to a man himself to see if he can conceive, even in thought,  what he holds to be true in fact, and from a notional to allow it a real  existence?    HYL.  It cannot be denied there is something highly serviceable to  religion in what you advance. But do you not think it looks very like a  notion entertained by some eminent moderns, of SEEING ALL THINGS IN  GOD?    PHIL.  I would gladly know that opinion: pray explain it to me.    HYL.  They conceive that the soul, being immaterial, is incapable of  being united with material things, so as to perceive them in themselves;  but that she perceives them by her union with the substance of God,  which, being spiritual, is therefore purely intelligible, or capable of  being the immediate object of a spirit's thought. Besides the Divine  essence contains in it perfections correspondent to each created being;  and which are, for that reason, proper to exhibit or represent them to  the mind.    PHIL.  I do not understand how our ideas, which are things altogether  passive and inert, can be the essence, or any part (or like any part) of  the essence or substance of God, who is an impassive, indivisible,  pure, active being. Many more difficulties and objections there are which  occur at first view against this hypothesis; but I shall only add that it  is liable to all the absurdities of the common hypothesis, in making a  created world exist otherwise than in the mind of a Spirit. Besides all  which it hath this peculiar to itself; that it makes that material world  serve to no purpose. And, if it pass for a good argument against other  hypotheses in the sciences, that they suppose Nature, or the Divine  wisdom, to make something in vain, or do that by tedious roundabout  methods which might have been performed in a much more easy and  compendious way, what shall we think of that hypothesis which supposes  the whole world made in vain?    HYL.  But what say you? Are not you too of opinion that we see all  things in God? If I mistake not, what you advance comes near it.    PHIL.  Few men think; yet all have opinions. Hence men's opinions are  superficial and confused. It is nothing strange that tenets which in  themselves are ever so different, should nevertheless be confounded with  each other, by those who do not consider them attentively. I shall not  therefore be surprised if some men imagine that I run into the enthusiasm  of Malebranche; though in truth I am very remote from it. He builds on  the most abstract general ideas, which I entirely disclaim. He asserts an  absolute external world, which I deny. He maintains that we are deceived  by our senses, and, know not the real natures or the true forms and  figures of extended beings; of all which I hold the direct contrary. So  that upon the whole there are no Principles more fundamentally opposite  than his and mine. It must be owned that I entirely agree with what  the holy Scripture saith, \"That in God we live and move and have our  being.\" But that we see things in His essence, after the manner above set  forth, I am far from believing. Take here in brief my meaning:--It is  evident that the things I perceive are my own ideas, and that no idea can  exist unless it be in a mind: nor is it less plain that these ideas or  things by me perceived, either themselves or their archetypes, exist  independently of my mind, since I know myself not to be their author, it  being out of my power to determine at pleasure what particular ideas I  shall be affected with upon opening my eyes or ears: they must therefore  exist in some other Mind, whose Will it is they should be exhibited  to me. The things, I say, immediately perceived are ideas or sensations,  call them which you will. But how can any idea or sensation exist in, or  be produced by, anything but a mind or spirit? This indeed is  inconceivable. And to assert that which is inconceivable is to talk  nonsense: is it not?    HYL.  Without doubt.    PHIL.  But, on the other hand, it is very conceivable that they should  exist in and be produced by a spirit; since this is no more than I daily  experience in myself, inasmuch as I perceive numberless ideas; and, by an  act of my will, can form a great variety of them, and raise them up in my  imagination: though, it must be confessed, these creatures of the fancy  are not altogether so distinct, so strong, vivid, and permanent, as those  perceived by my senses--which latter are called RED THINGS. From all  which I conclude, THERE IS A MIND WHICH AFFECTS ME EVERY MOMENT WITH ALL  THE SENSIBLE IMPRESSIONS I PERCEIVE. AND, from the variety, order, and  manner of these, I conclude THE AUTHOR OF THEM TO BE WISE, POWERFUL,  AND GOOD, BEYOND COMPREHENSION. MARK it well; I do not say, I see  things by perceiving that which represents them in the intelligible  Substance of God. This I do not understand; but I say, the things by me  perceived are known by the understanding, and produced by the will of an  infinite Spirit. And is not all this most plain and evident? Is there any  more in it than what a little observation in our own minds, and that  which passeth in them, not only enables us to conceive, but also obliges  us to acknowledge.    HYL.  I think I understand you very clearly; and own the proof you give  of a Deity seems no less evident than it is surprising. But, allowing  that God is the supreme and universal Cause of an things, yet, may there  not be still a Third Nature besides Spirits and Ideas? May we not admit a  subordinate and limited cause of our ideas? In a word, may there not for  all that be MATTER?    PHIL.  How often must I inculcate the same thing? You allow the things  immediately perceived by sense to exist nowhere without the mind; but  there is nothing perceived by sense which is not perceived immediately:  therefore there is nothing sensible that exists without the mind. The  Matter, therefore, which you still insist on is something intelligible, I  suppose; something that may be discovered by reason, and not by sense.    HYL.  You are in the right.    PHIL.  Pray let me know what reasoning your belief of Matter is grounded  on; and what this Matter is, in your present sense of it.    HYL.  I find myself affected with various ideas, whereof I know I am not  the cause; neither are they the cause of themselves, or of one another,  or capable of subsisting by themselves, as being altogether inactive,  fleeting, dependent beings. They have therefore SOME cause distinct  from me and them: of which I pretend to know no more than that it is THE  CAUSE OF MY IDEAS. And this thing, whatever it be, I call Matter.    PHIL.  Tell me, Hylas, hath every one a liberty to change the current  proper signification attached to a common name in any language? For  example, suppose a traveller should tell you that in a certain country  men pass unhurt through the fire; and, upon explaining himself, you found  he meant by the word fire that which others call WATER. Or, if he  should assert that there are trees that walk upon two legs, meaning men  by the term TREES. Would you think this reasonable?    HYL.  No; I should think it very absurd. Common custom is the standard  of propriety in language. And for any man to affect speaking improperly  is to pervert the use of speech, and can never serve to a better purpose  than to protract and multiply disputes, where there is no difference in  opinion.    PHIL.  And doth not MATTER, in the common current acceptation of the  word, signify an extended, solid, moveable, unthinking, inactive  Substance?    HYL.  It doth.    PHIL.  And, hath it not been made evident that no SUCH substance can  possibly exist? And, though it should be allowed to exist, yet how can  that which is INACTIVE be a CAUSE; or that which is UNTHINKING be a  CAUSE OF THOUGHT? You may, indeed, if you please, annex to the word  MATTER a contrary meaning to what is vulgarly received; and tell me you  understand by it, an unextended, thinking, active being, which is the  cause of our ideas. But what else is this than to play with words, and  run into that very fault you just now condemned with so much reason? I do  by no means find fault with your reasoning, in that you collect a cause  from the PHENOMENA: BUT I deny that THE cause deducible by reason  can properly be termed Matter.    HYL.  There is indeed something in what you say. But I am afraid  you do not thoroughly comprehend my meaning. I would by no means be  thought to deny that God, or an"]]]
