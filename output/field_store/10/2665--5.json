[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/583"],[0,"The Woman in White (#10)"],[1,"tried to take her out walking;  sat before she looked at anything, before she talked of anything,  before she answered Yes, or No, to the commonest question--always with  the same serene smile on her lips, the same vacantly-attentive turn of  the head, the same snugly-comfortable position of her hands and arms,  under every possible change of domestic circumstances.  A mild, a  compliant, an unutterably tranquil and harmless old lady, who never by  any chance suggested the idea that she had been actually alive since  the hour of her birth.  Nature has so much to do in this world, and is  engaged in generating such a vast variety of co-existent productions,  that she must surely be now and then too flurried and confused to  distinguish between the different processes that she is carrying on at  the same time. Starting from this point of view, it will always remain  my private persuasion that Nature was absorbed in making cabbages when  Mrs. Vesey was born, and that the good lady suffered the consequences  of a vegetable preoccupation in the mind of the Mother of us all.    \"Now, Mrs. Vesey,\" said Miss Halcombe, looking brighter, sharper, and  readier than ever, by contrast with the undemonstrative old lady at her  side, \"what will you have? A cutlet?\"    Mrs. Vesey crossed her dimpled hands on the edge of the table, smiled  placidly, and said, \"Yes, dear.\"    \"What is that opposite Mr. Hartright? Boiled chicken, is it not? I  thought you liked boiled chicken better than cutlet, Mrs. Vesey?\"    Mrs. Vesey took her dimpled hands off the edge of the table and crossed  them on her lap instead; nodded contemplatively at the boiled chicken,  and said, \"Yes, dear.\"    \"Well, but which will you have, to-day? Shall Mr. Hartright give you  some chicken? or shall I give you some cutlet?\"    Mrs. Vesey put one of her dimpled hands back again on the edge of the  table; hesitated drowsily, and said, \"Which you please, dear.\"    \"Mercy on me! it's a question for your taste, my good lady, not for  mine.  Suppose you have a little of both? and suppose you begin with  the chicken, because Mr. Hartright looks devoured by anxiety to carve  for you.\"    Mrs. Vesey put the other dimpled hand back on the edge of the table;  brightened dimly one moment; went out again the next; bowed obediently,  and said, \"If you please, sir.\"    Surely a mild, a compliant, an unutterably tranquil and harmless old  lady! But enough, perhaps, for the present, of Mrs. Vesey.      All this time, there were no signs of Miss Fairlie.  We finished our  luncheon; and still she never appeared.  Miss Halcombe, whose quick eye  nothing escaped, noticed the looks that I cast, from time to time, in  the direction of the door.    \"I understand you, Mr. Hartright,\" she said; \"you are wondering what  has become of your other pupil.  She has been downstairs, and has got  over her headache; but has not sufficiently recovered her appetite to  join us at lunch.  If you will put yourself under my charge, I think I  can undertake to find her somewhere in the garden.\"    She took up a parasol lying on a chair near her, and led the way out,  by a long window at the bottom of the room, which opened on to the  lawn.  It is almost unnecessary to say that we left Mrs. Vesey still  seated at the table, with her dimpled hands still crossed on the edge  of it; apparently settled in that position for the rest of the  afternoon.    As we crossed the lawn, Miss Halcombe looked at me significantly, and  shook her head.    \"That mysterious adventure of yours,\" she said, \"still remains involved  in its own appropriate midnight darkness.  I have been all the morning  looking over my mother's letters, and I have made no discoveries yet.  However, don't despair, Mr. Hartright.  This is a matter of curiosity;  and you have got a woman for your ally. Under such conditions success  is certain, sooner or later.  The letters are not exhausted.  I have  three packets still left, and you may confidently rely on my spending  the whole evening over them.\"    Here, then, was one of my anticipations of the morning still  unfulfilled.  I began to wonder, next, whether my introduction to Miss  Fairlie would disappoint the expectations that I had been forming of  her since breakfast-time.    \"And how did you get on with Mr. Fairlie?\" inquired Miss Halcombe, as  we left the lawn and turned into a shrubbery.  \"Was he particularly  nervous this morning? Never mind considering about your answer, Mr.  Hartright.  The mere fact of your being obliged to consider is enough  for me.  I see in your face that he WAS particularly nervous; and, as I  am amiably unwilling to throw you into the same condition, I ask no  more.\"    We turned off into a winding path while she was speaking, and  approached a pretty summer-house, built of wood, in the form of a  miniature Swiss chalet.  The one room of the summer-house, as we  ascended the steps of the door, was occupied by a young lady.  She was  standing near a rustic table, looking out at the inland view of moor  and hill presented by a gap in the trees, and absently turning over the  leaves of a little sketch-book that lay at her side.  This was Miss  Fairlie.    How can I describe her? How can I separate her from my own sensations,  and from all that has happened in the later time? How can I see her  again as she looked when my eyes first rested on her--as she should  look, now, to the eyes that are about to see her in these pages?    The water-colour drawing that I made of Laura Fairlie, at an after  period, in the place and attitude in which I first saw her, lies on my  desk while I write.  I look at it, and there dawns upon me brightly,  from the dark greenish-brown background of the summer-house, a light,  youthful figure, clothed in a simple muslin dress, the pattern of it  formed by broad alternate stripes of delicate blue and white.  A scarf  of the same material sits crisply and closely round her shoulders, and  a little straw hat of the natural colour, plainly and sparingly trimmed  with ribbon to match the gown, covers her head, and throws its soft  pearly shadow over the upper part of her face.  Her hair is of so faint  and pale a brown--not flaxen, and yet almost as light; not golden, and  yet almost as glossy--that it nearly melts, here and there, into the  shadow of the hat.  It is plainly parted and drawn back over her ears,  and the line of it ripples naturally as it crosses her forehead. The  eyebrows are rather darker than the hair; and the eyes are of that  soft, limpid, turquoise blue, so often sung by the poets, so seldom  seen in real life.  Lovely eyes in colour, lovely eyes in form--large  and tender and quietly thoughtful--but beautiful above all things in  the clear truthfulness of look that dwells in their inmost depths, and  shines through all their changes of expression with the light of a  purer and a better world.  The charm--most gently and yet most  distinctly expressed--which they shed over the whole face, so covers  and transforms its little natural human blemishes elsewhere, that it is  difficult to estimate the relative merits and defects of the other  features.  It is hard to see that the lower part of the face is too  delicately refined away towards the chin to be in full and fair  proportion with the upper part; that the nose, in escaping the aquiline  bend (always hard and cruel in a woman, no matter how abstractedly  perfect it may be), has erred a little in the other extreme, and has  missed the ideal straightness of line; and that the sweet, sensitive  lips are subject to a slight nervous contraction, when she smiles,  which draws them upward a little at one corner, towards the cheek.  It  might be possible to note these blemishes in another woman's face but  it is not easy to dwell on them in hers, so subtly are they connected  with all that is individual and characteristic in her expression, and  so closely does the expression depend for its full play and life, in  every other feature, on the moving impulse of the eyes.    Does my poor portrait of her, my fond, patient labour of long and happy  days, show me these things? Ah, how few of them are in the dim  mechanical drawing, and how many in the mind with which I regard it! A  fair, delicate girl, in a pretty light dress, trifling with the leaves  of a sketch-book, while she looks up from it with truthful, innocent  blue eyes--that is all the drawing can say; all, perhaps, that even the  deeper reach of thought and pen can say in their language, either.  The  woman who first gives life, light, and form to our shadowy conceptions  of beauty, fills a void in our spiritual nature that has remained  unknown to us till she appeared.  Sympathies that lie too deep for  words, too deep almost for thoughts, are touched, at such times, by  other charms than those which the senses feel and which the resources  of expression can realise.  The mystery which underlies the beauty of  women is never raised above the reach of all expression until it has  claimed kindred with the deeper mystery in our own souls. Then, and  then only, has it passed beyond the narrow region on which light falls,  in this world, from the pencil and the pen.    Think of her as you thought of the first woman who quickened the pulses  within you that the rest of her sex had no art to stir. Let the kind,  candid blue eyes meet yours, as they met mine, with the one matchless  look which we both remember so well.  Let her voice speak the music  that you once loved best, attuned as sweetly to your ear as to mine.  Let her footstep, as she comes and goes, in these pages, be like that  other footstep to whose airy fall your own heart once beat time.  Take  her as the visionary nursling of your own fancy; and she will grow upon  you, all the more clearly, as the living woman who dwells in mine.    Among the sensations that crowded on me, when my eyes first looked upon  her--familiar sensations which we all know, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/584"],[0,"Our Nig; Or, Sketches from the Life of a Free Black, in a Two-story White House, (#10)"],[1,"having a nigger go, except to drive others  there? Why, according to you and James, we should very soon have her in  the parlor, as smart as our own girls. It's of no use talking to you or  James. If you should go on as you would like, it would not be six months  before she would be leaving me; and that won't do. Just think how much  profit she was to us last summer. We had no work hired out; she did the  work of two girls--\"    \"And got the whippings for two with it!\" remarked Mr. Bellmont.    \"I'll beat the money out of her, if I can't get her worth any other  way,\" retorted Mrs. B. sharply. While this scene was passing, Frado was  trying to utter the prayer of the publican, \"God be merciful to me a  sinner.\"          CHAPTER IX.    DEATH.        We have now      But a small portion of what men call time,      To hold communion.      SPRING opened, and James, instead of rallying, as was hoped, grew worse  daily. Aunt Abby and Frado were the constant allies of Susan. Mrs.  Bellmont dared not lift him. She was not \"strong enough,\" she said.    It was very offensive to Mrs. B. to have Nab about James so much. She  had thrown out many a hint to detain her from so often visiting the  sick-room; but Aunt Abby was too well accustomed to her ways to mind  them. After various unsuccessful efforts, she resorted to the following  expedient. As she heard her cross the entry below, to ascend the stairs,  she slipped out and held the latch of the door which led into the upper  entry.    \"James does not want to see you, or any one else,\" she said.    Aunt Abby hesitated, and returned slowly to her own room; wondering if  it were really James' wish not to see her. She did not venture again  that day, but still felt disturbed and anxious about him. She inquired  of Frado, and learned that he was no worse. She asked her if James did  not wish her to come and see him; what could it mean?    Quite late next morning, Susan came to see what had become of her aunt.    \"Your mother said James did not wish to see me, and I was afraid I tired  him.\"    \"Why, aunt, that is a mistake, I KNOW. What could mother mean?\" asked  Susan.    The next time she went to the sitting-room she asked her mother,--    \"Why does not Aunt Abby visit James as she has done? Where is she?\"    \"At home. I hope that she will stay there,\" was the answer.    \"I should think she would come in and see James,\" continued Susan.    \"I told her he did not want to see her, and to stay out. You need make  no stir about it; remember:\" she added, with one of her fiery glances.    Susan kept silence. It was a day or two before James spoke of her  absence. The family were at dinner, and Frado was watching beside him.  He inquired the cause of her absence, and SHE told him all. After the  family returned he sent his wife for her. When she entered, he took her  hand, and said, \"Come to me often, Aunt. Come any time,--I am always  glad to see you. I have but a little longer to be with you,--come often,  Aunt. Now please help lift me up, and see if I can rest a little.\"    Frado was called in, and Susan and Mrs. B. all attempted; Mrs. B. was  too weak; she did not feel able to lift so much. So the three succeeded  in relieving the sufferer.    Frado returned to her work. Mrs. B. followed. Seizing Frado, she said  she would \"cure her of tale-bearing,\" and, placing the wedge of wood  between her teeth, she beat her cruelly with the raw-hide. Aunt Abby  heard the blows, and came to see if she could hinder them.    Surprised at her sudden appearance, Mrs. B. suddenly stopped, but  forbade her removing the wood till she gave her permission, and  commanded Nab to go home.    She was thus tortured when Mr. Bellmont came in, and, making inquiries  which she did not, because she could not, answer, approached her; and  seeing her situation, quickly removed the instrument of torture, and  sought his wife. Their conversation we will omit; suffice it to say, a  storm raged which required many days to exhaust its strength.    Frado was becoming seriously ill. She had no relish for food, and was  constantly overworked, and then she had such solicitude about the  future. She wished to pray for pardon. She did try to pray. Her mistress  had told her it would \"do no good for her to attempt prayer; prayer was  for whites, not for blacks. If she minded her mistress, and did what she  commanded, it was all that was required of her.\"    This did not satisfy her, or appease her longings. She knew her  instructions did not harmonize with those of the man of God or Aunt  Abby's. She resolved to persevere. She said nothing on the subject,  unless asked. It was evident to all her mind was deeply exercised. James  longed to speak with her alone on the subject. An opportunity presented  soon, while the family were at tea. It was usual to summon Aunt Abby to  keep company with her, as his death was expected hourly.    As she took her accustomed seat, he asked, \"Are you afraid to stay with  me alone, Frado?\"    \"No,\" she replied, and stepped to the window to conceal her emotion.    \"Come here, and sit by me; I wish to talk with you.\"    She approached him, and, taking her hand, he remarked:    \"How poor you are, Frado! I want to tell you that I fear I shall never  be able to talk with you again. It is the last time, perhaps, I shall  EVER talk with you. You are old enough to remember my dying words and  profit by them. I have been sick a long time; I shall die pretty soon.  My Heavenly Father is calling me home. Had it been his will to let me  live I should take you to live with me; but, as it is, I shall go and  leave you. But, Frado, if you will be a good girl, and love and serve  God, it will be but a short time before we are in a HEAVENLY home  together. There will never be any sickness or sorrow there.\"    Frado, overcome with grief, sobbed, and buried her face in his pillow.  She expected he would die; but to hear him speak of his departure  himself was unexpected.    \"Bid me good bye, Frado.\"    She kissed him, and sank on her knees by his bedside; his hand rested on  her head; his eyes were closed; his lips moved in prayer for this  disconsolate child.    His wife entered, and interpreting the scene, gave him some  restoratives, and withdrew for a short time.    It was a great effort for Frado to cease sobbing; but she dared not be  seen below in tears; so she choked her grief, and descended to her usual  toil. Susan perceived a change in her husband. She felt that death was  near.    He tenderly looked on her, and said, \"Susan, my wife, our farewells are  all spoken. I feel prepared to go. I shall meet you in heaven. Death is  indeed creeping fast upon me. Let me see them all once more. Teach  Charlie the way to heaven; lead him up as you come.\"    The family all assembled. He could not talk as he wished to them. He  seemed to sink into unconsciousness. They watched him for hours. He had  labored hard for breath some time, when he seemed to awake suddenly, and  exclaimed, \"Hark! do you hear it?\"    \"Hear what, my son?\" asked the father.    \"Their call. Look, look, at the shining ones! Oh, let me go and be at  rest!\"    As if waiting for this petition, the Angel of Death severed the golden  thread, and he was in heaven. At midnight the messenger came.    They called Frado to see his last struggle. Sinking on her knees at the  foot of his bed, she buried her face in the clothes, and wept like one  inconsolable. They led her from the room. She seemed to be too much  absorbed to know it was necessary for her to leave. Next day she would  steal into the chamber as often as she could, to weep over his remains,  and ponder his last words to her. She moved about the house like an  automaton. Every duty performed--but an abstraction from all, which  shewed her thoughts were busied elsewhere. Susan wished her to attend  his burial as one of the family. Lewis and Mary and Jack it was not  thought best to send for, as the season would not allow them time for  the journey. Susan provided her with a dress for the occasion, which was  her first intimation that she would be allowed to mingle her grief with  others.    The day of the burial she was attired in her mourning dress; but Susan,  in her grief, had forgotten a bonnet.    She hastily ransacked the closets, and found one of Mary's, trimmed with  bright pink ribbon.    It was too late to change the ribbon, and she was unwilling to leave  Frado at home; she knew it would be the wish of James she should go with  her. So tying it on, she said, \"Never mind, Frado, you shall see where  our dear James is buried.\" As she passed out, she heard the whispers of  the by-standers, \"Look there! see there! how that looks,--a black dress  and a pink ribbon!\"    Another time, such remarks would have wounded Frado. She had now a  sorrow with which such were small in comparison.    As she saw his body lowered in the grave she wished to share it; but she  was not fit to die. She could not go where he was if she did. She did  not love God; she did not serve him or know how to.    She retired at night to mourn over her unfitness for heaven, and gaze  out upon the stars, which, she felt, studded the entrance of heaven,  above which James reposed in the bosom of Jesus, to which her desires  were hastening. She wished she could see God, and ask him for eternal  life. Aunt Abby had taught her that He was ever looking upon her. Oh, if  she could see him, or hear him speak words of forgiveness. Her anxiety  increased; her health seemed impaired, and she felt constrained to go to  Aunt Abby and tell her all about her conflicts.    She received her like a returning wanderer; seriously urged her to  accept of Christ; explained the way; read to her from the Bible, and  remarked upon such passages as applied to her state. She warned her  against stifling that voice which was calling her to heaven; echoed the  farewell words of James, and told her to come to her with her  difficulties, "]]]
