But when we talk about slaves, we do not mean the sort of people about  whom you have read in the pages of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\" It is true that  the position of those slaves who tilled the fields was a very unpleasant  one, but the average freeman who had come down in the world and who had  been obliged to hire himself out as a farm hand led just as miserable  a life. In the cities, furthermore, many of the slaves were more  prosperous than the poorer classes of the freemen. For the Greeks, who  loved moderation in all things, did not like to treat their slaves after  the fashion which afterward was so common in Rome, where a slave had as  few rights as an engine in a modern factory and could be thrown to the  wild animals upon the smallest pretext.    The Greeks accepted slavery as a necessary institution, without which no  city could possibly become the home of a truly civilised people.    The slaves also took care of those tasks which nowadays are performed by  the business men and the professional men. As for those household duties  which take up so much of the time of your mother and which worry your  father when he comes home from his office, the Greeks, who understood  the value of leisure, had reduced such duties to the smallest possible  minimum by living amidst surroundings of extreme simplicity.    To begin with, their homes were very plain. Even the rich nobles spent  their lives in a sort of adobe barn, which lacked all the comforts which  a modern workman expects as his natural right. A Greek home consisted  of four walls and a roof. There was a door which led into the street but  there were no windows. The kitchen, the living rooms and the sleeping  quarters were built around an open courtyard in which there was a small  fountain, or a statue and a few plants to make it look bright. Within  this courtyard the family lived when it did not rain or when it was not  too cold. In one corner of the yard the cook (who was a slave) prepared  the meal and in another corner, the teacher (who was also a  slave) taught the children the alpha beta gamma and the tables of  multiplication and in still another corner the lady of the house, who  rarely left her domain (since it was not considered good form for a  married woman to be seen on the street too often) was repairing her  husband's coat with her seamstresses (who were slaves,) and in the  little office, right off the door, the master was inspecting the  accounts which the overseer of his farm (who was a slave) had just  brought to him.    When dinner was ready the family came together but the meal was a very  simple one and did not take much time. The Greeks seem to have regarded  eating as an unavoidable evil and not a pastime, which kills many dreary  hours and eventually kills many dreary people. They lived on bread and  on wine, with a little meat and some green vegetables. They drank water  only when nothing else was available because they did not think it very  healthy. They loved to call on each other for dinner, but our idea of a  festive meal, where everybody is supposed to eat much more than is good  for him, would have disgusted them. They came together at the table for  the purpose of a good talk and a good glass of wine and water, but as  they were moderate people they despised those who drank too much.    The same simplicity which prevailed in the dining room also dominated  their choice of clothes. They liked to be clean and well groomed, to  have their hair and beards neatly cut, to feel their bodies strong with  the exercise and the swimming of the gymnasium, but they never followed  the Asiatic fashion which prescribed loud colours and strange patterns.  They wore a long white coat and they managed to look as smart as a  modern Italian officer in his long blue cape.    They loved to see their wives wear ornaments but they thought it very  vulgar to display their wealth (or their wives) in public and whenever  the women left their home they were as inconspicuous as possible.    In short, the story of Greek life is a story not only of moderation but  also of simplicity. \"Things,\" chairs and tables and books and houses and  carriages, are apt to take up a great deal of their owner's time. In the  end they invariably make him their slave and his hours are spent looking  after their wants, keeping them polished and brushed and painted. The  Greeks, before everything else, wanted to be \"free,\" both in mind and  in body. That they might maintain their liberty, and be truly free in  spirit, they reduced their daily needs to the lowest possible point.          THE GREEK THEATRE    THE ORIGINS OF THE THEATRE, THE FIRST FORM OF PUBLIC AMUSEMENT      AT a very early stage of their history the Greeks had begun to collect  the poems, which had been written in honor of their brave ancestors who  had driven the Pelasgians out of Hellas and had destroyed the power of  Troy. These poems were recited in public and everybody came to listen to  them. But the theatre, the form of entertainment which has become almost  a necessary part of our own lives, did not grow out of these recited  heroic tales. It had such a curious origin that I must tell you  something about it in a separate chapter    The Greeks had always been fond of parades. Every year they held solemn  processions in honor of Dionysos the God of the wine. As everybody in  Greece drank wine (the Greeks thought water only useful for the purpose  of swimming and sailing) this particular Divinity was as popular as a  God of the Soda-Fountain would be in our own land.    And because the Wine-God was supposed to live in the vineyards, amidst a  merry mob of Satyrs (strange creatures who were half man and half goat),  the crowd that joined the procession used to wear goat-skins and to  hee-haw like real billy-goats. The Greek word for goat is \"tragos\" and  the Greek word for singer is \"oidos.\" The singer who meh-mehed like a  goat therefore was called a \"tragos-oidos\" or goat singer, and it is  this strange name which developed into the modern word \"Tragedy,\" which  means in the theatrical sense a piece with an unhappy ending, just as  Comedy (which really means the singing of something \"comos\" or gay) is  the name given to a play which ends happily.    But how, you will ask, did this noisy chorus of masqueraders, stamping  around like wild goats, ever develop into the noble tragedies which have  filled the theatres of the world for almost two thousand years?    The connecting link between the goat-singer and Hamlet is really very  simple as I shall show you in a moment.    The singing chorus was very amusing in the beginning and attracted large  crowds of spectators who stood along the side of the road and laughed.  But soon this business of tree-hawing grew tiresome and the Greeks  thought dullness an evil only comparable to ugliness or sickness. They  asked for something more entertaining. Then an inventive young poet  from the village of Icaria in Attica hit upon a new idea which proved a  tremendous success. He made one of the members of the goat-chorus step  forward and engage in conversation with the leader of the musicians who  marched at the head of the parade playing upon their pipes of Pan.  This individual was allowed to step out of line. He waved his arms and  gesticulated while he spoke (that is to say he \"acted\" while the others  merely stood by and sang) and he asked a lot of questions, which the  bandmaster answered according to the roll of papyrus upon which the poet  had written down these answers before the show began.    This rough and ready conversation--the dialogue--which told the story  of Dionysos or one of the other Gods, became at once popular with the  crowd. Henceforth every Dionysian procession had an \"acted scene\" and  very soon the \"acting\" was considered more important than the procession  and the meh-mehing.    AEschylus, the most successful of all \"tragedians\" who wrote no less  than eighty plays during his long life (from 526 to 455) made a  bold step forward when he introduced two \"actors\" instead of one. A  generation later Sophocles increased the number of actors to three. When  Euripides began to write his terrible tragedies in the middle of the  fifth century, B.C., he was allowed as many actors as he liked and  when Aristophanes wrote those famous comedies in which he poked fun  at everybody and everything, including the Gods of Mount Olympus, the  chorus had been reduced to the role of mere bystanders who were lined up  behind the principal performers and who sang \"this is a terrible world\"  while the hero in the foreground committed a crime against the will of  the Gods.    This new form of dramatic entertainment demanded a proper setting, and  soon every Greek city owned a theatre, cut out of the rock of a nearby  hill. The spectators sat upon wooden benches and faced a wide circle  (our present orchestra where you pay three dollars and thirty cents for  a seat). Upon this half-circle, which was the stage, the actors and the  chorus took their stand. Behind them there was a tent where they made  up with large clay masks which hid their faces and which showed the  spectators whether the actors were supposed to be happy and smiling or  unhappy and weeping. The Greek word for tent is \"skene\" and that is the  reason why we talk of the \"scenery\" of the stage.    When once the tragedy had become part of Greek life, the people took  it very seriously and never went to the theatre to give their minds a  vacation. A new play became as important an event as an election and  a successful playwright was received with greater honors than those  bestowed upon a general who had just returned from a famous victory.          THE PERSIAN WARS    HOW THE GREEKS DEFENDED EUROPE AGAINST ASIATIC "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/766"],[0,"David Copperfield (#10)"],[1,"Mrs. Gummidge was knitting in her corner, in a very wretched  and miserable condition. Peggotty had been working cheerfully. Ham had  been patching up a great pair of waterboots; and I, with little Em'ly  by my side, had been reading to them. Mrs. Gummidge had never made any  other remark than a forlorn sigh, and had never raised her eyes since  tea.    'Well, Mates,' said Mr. Peggotty, taking his seat, 'and how are you?'    We all said something, or looked something, to welcome him, except Mrs.  Gummidge, who only shook her head over her knitting.    'What's amiss?' said Mr. Peggotty, with a clap of his hands. 'Cheer up,  old Mawther!' (Mr. Peggotty meant old girl.)    Mrs. Gummidge did not appear to be able to cheer up. She took out an old  black silk handkerchief and wiped her eyes; but instead of putting it  in her pocket, kept it out, and wiped them again, and still kept it out,  ready for use.    'What's amiss, dame?' said Mr. Peggotty.    'Nothing,' returned Mrs. Gummidge. 'You've come from The Willing Mind,  Dan'l?'    'Why yes, I've took a short spell at The Willing Mind tonight,' said Mr.  Peggotty.    'I'm sorry I should drive you there,' said Mrs. Gummidge.    'Drive! I don't want no driving,' returned Mr. Peggotty with an honest  laugh. 'I only go too ready.'    'Very ready,' said Mrs. Gummidge, shaking her head, and wiping her eyes.  'Yes, yes, very ready. I am sorry it should be along of me that you're  so ready.'    'Along o' you! It an't along o' you!' said Mr. Peggotty. 'Don't ye  believe a bit on it.'    'Yes, yes, it is,' cried Mrs. Gummidge. 'I know what I am. I know that I  am a lone lorn creetur', and not only that everythink goes contrary with  me, but that I go contrary with everybody. Yes, yes. I feel more than  other people do, and I show it more. It's my misfortun'.'    I really couldn't help thinking, as I sat taking in all this, that the  misfortune extended to some other members of that family besides Mrs.  Gummidge. But Mr. Peggotty made no such retort, only answering with  another entreaty to Mrs. Gummidge to cheer up.    'I an't what I could wish myself to be,' said Mrs. Gummidge. 'I am far  from it. I know what I am. My troubles has made me contrary. I feel my  troubles, and they make me contrary. I wish I didn't feel 'em, but I  do. I wish I could be hardened to 'em, but I an't. I make the house  uncomfortable. I don't wonder at it. I've made your sister so all day,  and Master Davy.'    Here I was suddenly melted, and roared out, 'No, you haven't, Mrs.  Gummidge,' in great mental distress.    'It's far from right that I should do it,' said Mrs. Gummidge. 'It an't  a fit return. I had better go into the house and die. I am a lone lorn  creetur', and had much better not make myself contrary here. If thinks  must go contrary with me, and I must go contrary myself, let me go  contrary in my parish. Dan'l, I'd better go into the house, and die and  be a riddance!'    Mrs. Gummidge retired with these words, and betook herself to bed. When  she was gone, Mr. Peggotty, who had not exhibited a trace of any feeling  but the profoundest sympathy, looked round upon us, and nodding his head  with a lively expression of that sentiment still animating his face,  said in a whisper:    'She's been thinking of the old 'un!'    I did not quite understand what old one Mrs. Gummidge was supposed to  have fixed her mind upon, until Peggotty, on seeing me to bed, explained  that it was the late Mr. Gummidge; and that her brother always took that  for a received truth on such occasions, and that it always had a moving  effect upon him. Some time after he was in his hammock that night, I  heard him myself repeat to Ham, 'Poor thing! She's been thinking of the  old 'un!' And whenever Mrs. Gummidge was overcome in a similar manner  during the remainder of our stay (which happened some few times), he  always said the same thing in extenuation of the circumstance, and  always with the tenderest commiseration.    So the fortnight slipped away, varied by nothing but the variation of  the tide, which altered Mr. Peggotty's times of going out and coming in,  and altered Ham's engagements also. When the latter was unemployed, he  sometimes walked with us to show us the boats and ships, and once  or twice he took us for a row. I don't know why one slight set of  impressions should be more particularly associated with a place than  another, though I believe this obtains with most people, in reference  especially to the associations of their childhood. I never hear the  name, or read the name, of Yarmouth, but I am reminded of a certain  Sunday morning on the beach, the bells ringing for church, little Em'ly  leaning on my shoulder, Ham lazily dropping stones into the water, and  the sun, away at sea, just breaking through the heavy mist, and showing  us the ships, like their own shadows.    At last the day came for going home. I bore up against the separation  from Mr. Peggotty and Mrs. Gummidge, but my agony of mind at leaving  little Em'ly was piercing. We went arm-in-arm to the public-house where  the carrier put up, and I promised, on the road, to write to her. (I  redeemed that promise afterwards, in characters larger than those in  which apartments are usually announced in manuscript, as being to let.)  We were greatly overcome at parting; and if ever, in my life, I have had  a void made in my heart, I had one made that day.    Now, all the time I had been on my visit, I had been ungrateful to my  home again, and had thought little or nothing about it. But I was no  sooner turned towards it, than my reproachful young conscience seemed  to point that way with a ready finger; and I felt, all the more for the  sinking of my spirits, that it was my nest, and that my mother was my  comforter and friend.    This gained upon me as we went along; so that the nearer we drew, the  more familiar the objects became that we passed, the more excited I was  to get there, and to run into her arms. But Peggotty, instead of sharing  in those transports, tried to check them (though very kindly), and  looked confused and out of sorts.    Blunderstone Rookery would come, however, in spite of her, when the  carrier's horse pleased--and did. How well I recollect it, on a cold  grey afternoon, with a dull sky, threatening rain!    The door opened, and I looked, half laughing and half crying in my  pleasant agitation, for my mother. It was not she, but a strange  servant.    'Why, Peggotty!' I said, ruefully, 'isn't she come home?'    'Yes, yes, Master Davy,' said Peggotty. 'She's come home. Wait a bit,  Master Davy, and I'll--I'll tell you something.'    Between her agitation, and her natural awkwardness in getting out of the  cart, Peggotty was making a most extraordinary festoon of herself, but  I felt too blank and strange to tell her so. When she had got down, she  took me by the hand; led me, wondering, into the kitchen; and shut the  door.    'Peggotty!' said I, quite frightened. 'What's the matter?'    'Nothing's the matter, bless you, Master Davy dear!' she answered,  assuming an air of sprightliness.    'Something's the matter, I'm sure. Where's mama?'    'Where's mama, Master Davy?' repeated Peggotty.    'Yes. Why hasn't she come out to the gate, and what have we come in here  for? Oh, Peggotty!' My eyes were full, and I felt as if I were going to  tumble down.    'Bless the precious boy!' cried Peggotty, taking hold of me. 'What is  it? Speak, my pet!'    'Not dead, too! Oh, she's not dead, Peggotty?'    Peggotty cried out No! with an astonishing volume of voice; and then sat  down, and began to pant, and said I had given her a turn.    I gave her a hug to take away the turn, or to give her another turn  in the right direction, and then stood before her, looking at her in  anxious inquiry.    'You see, dear, I should have told you before now,' said Peggotty,  'but I hadn't an opportunity. I ought to have made it, perhaps, but  I couldn't azackly'--that was always the substitute for exactly, in  Peggotty's militia of words--'bring my mind to it.'    'Go on, Peggotty,' said I, more frightened than before.    'Master Davy,' said Peggotty, untying her bonnet with a shaking hand,  and speaking in a breathless sort of way. 'What do you think? You have  got a Pa!'    I trembled, and turned white. Something--I don't know what, or  how--connected with the grave in the churchyard, and the raising of the  dead, seemed to strike me like an unwholesome wind.    'A new one,' said Peggotty.    'A new one?' I repeated.    Peggotty gave a gasp, as if she were swallowing something that was very  hard, and, putting out her hand, said:    'Come and see him.'    'I don't want to see him.' --'And your mama,' said Peggotty.    I ceased to draw back, and we went straight to the best parlour, where  she left me. On one side of the fire, sat my mother; on the other, Mr.  Murdstone. My mother dropped her work, and arose hurriedly, but timidly  I thought.    'Now, Clara my dear,' said Mr. Murdstone. 'Recollect! control yourself,  always control yourself! Davy boy, how do you do?'    I gave him my hand. After a moment of suspense, I went and kissed my  mother: she kissed me, patted me gently on the shoulder, and sat down  again to her work. I could not look at her, I could not look at him,  I knew quite well that he was looking at us both; and I turned to the  window and looked out there, at some shrubs that were drooping their  heads in the cold.    As soon as I could creep away, I crept upstairs. My old dear bedroom was  changed, and I was to lie a long way off. I rambled downstairs to find  anything that was like itself, so altered it all seemed; and roamed into  the yard. I very soon started back from there, for the empty dog-kennel  was filled up with a great dog--deep mouthed and black-haired like  Him--and he was very angry at the sight of me, and sprang out to get at  me.
