But when Mother Pepper and Mrs. Whitney did come home from the meeting,  oh! what a time there was. They all fell upon her, as soon as the door  opened, and the whole air was filled with \"little brown house.\" \"May  we--may we?\" \"A whole week.\" \"Two days, Mamsie, do say yes,\" and  Phronsie's glad little chirp \"Grandpapa wants to go, he does!\" ending  every other exclamation.    \"What a babel,\" cried Mrs. Pepper, her black eyes roving over the  excited group. \"Now what is it all about? Baby, you tell mother first.\"    Phronsie was not too big to jump into the comfortable lap, and while  her fingers played with the bonnet strings, she laid the whole  delightful plan open, the others hanging over them in ill-suppressed  excitement.    \"Well, you see, Mamsie,\" she began deliberately.    \"Oh! you are so slow, Phronsie,\" exclaimed Polly, \"do hurry.\"    \"Let her take her own time,\" said Mr. King, \"go on, child.\"    \"Dear Grandpapa,\" proceeded Phronsie, turning her yellow head to look  at him, her hand yet among the bonnet strings, \"is going to take us  all, every single one, to see the little brown house, and just touch it  once, and be sure it's there, and peek in the doors and windows and\"--    \"No, no,\" roared Joel, \"we're going to stay, and a week too,\" hopping  confidently up and down.    \"Oh, Joe! not a week,\" corrected Polly with glowing cheeks, \"perhaps  two days; we don't know yet.\"    \"Three--three,\" begged Van, pushing his head further into the center of  the group. \"Mrs. Pepper, do say you want to stay three days,\" he begged.    \"I haven't said I wanted to go yet,\" she answered with a smile.    \"Now, every one of you keep quiet,\" commanded Mr. King, raising his  hand, \"or you'll spoil the whole thing. Phronsie shall tell her story  as she likes.\"    Thereupon the rest, with the shadow of his warning that the whole might  be spoiled, fell back to a vigorous restraint once more.    \"Perhaps,\" cried Phronsie with shining eyes, and grasping the strings  tighter she leaned forward and pressed her red lips on the mother's  mouth, \"we'll go in and stay. Oh, Mamsie!\"    That \"Oh, Mamsie!\" carried the day, and every one hanging on the  conversation knew as soon as they heard it that a victory had been won.    \"It's no use to contend against the Fates,\" said Mrs. Whitney,  laughing, \"Mrs. Pepper, you and I know that.\"    \"That's so,\" cried old Mr. King, \"and whoever finds it out early in  life, is the lucky one. Now, children, off with you and talk it over,\"  he cried, dismissing them as if they were all below their teens. \"I  want to talk with Mrs. Pepper now.\"    And in two days they were ready to go. Mrs. Chatterton with nose high  in the air, and plentiful expressions of disgust at such a mid-winter  expedition, taking herself off to make a visit of corresponding length  to some distant relatives.    \"I hope and pray this may not get into a society paper,\" she cried at  the last, as she was seated in the carriage, \"but of course it will;  outre things always do. And we shall be disgraced for life. One comfort  remains to me, I am not in it.\"    Mr. King, holding the carriage door, laughed long and loudly. \"No,  Cousin Eunice,\" he said, \"you are not in it. Take comfort in that  thought. Good-by,\" and the carriage rolled off.    Mother Pepper and the five little Peppers were going back to the little  brown house. \"Really and truly we are,\" as Phronsie kept saying over  and over again with every revolution of the car-wheels, in a crooning  fashion, and making it impossible for Mr. King to shiver in  apprehension at the step he was taking. Were not two cases of blankets  and household comforts safely packed away in the luggage car? \"It's not  such a dreadful risk,\" said the old gentleman gruffly to himself, \"it's  quite a common occurrence nowadays to take a winter outing in the  country. We're all right,\" and he re-enforced himself further by  frequent glances at Mrs. Pepper's black bonnet, two seats off.    It was to be a three-days' frolic, after all. Not that the whole party  were to stay in the little brown house. O dear, no! how could they? It  was only big enough for the Peppers. So Mrs. Whitney and her three  boys, with Mr. King, and Jasper, who concealed many disappointed  feelings, planned to settle down in the old hotel at Hingham.    And before anybody imagined they could reach there so soon, there they  were at Badgertown Center, to find Mr. Tisbett waiting there on his  stage-box as if he had not stirred from it for five years.    \"Sho, now!\" he called out from his elevated position to Mrs. Pepper, as  she stepped down from the car, \"it's good to see you, though. Land! how  many of ye be there? And is that Phronsie? Sho, now!\"    \"Did you get my letter?\" exclaimed Mother Pepper to Mrs. Henderson, who  was pressing up to grasp her hand, and preparing to fall on the young  folks separately. The parson stood just back, biding his time with a  smile.    \"Is it possible?\" he exclaimed; \"are these tall boys and girls the five  little Peppers? It can't be, Mrs. Pepper,\" as at last he had her hand.  \"You are imposing on us.\"    And then the village people who had held back until their pastor and  his wife paid their respects, rushed up and claimed their rights, and  it was high holiday indeed for Badgertown.    \"My goodness!\" exclaimed Mr. King at a little remove and viewing the  scene with great disfavor, \"this is worse than the danger of taking  cold. Have they no sense, to carry on like this?\"    \"They're so glad to see the Peppers again, father,\" said Mrs. Whitney  with bright eyes. \"You took them away from all these good people, you  know; it's but fair to give them up for one day.\"    The old gentleman fumed and fretted, however, in a subdued fashion; at  last wisely turning his back, he began to stalk down the platform,  under pretense of examining the landscape.    \"Your friends will stay with us,\" Mrs. Henderson was saying in a gently  decisive manner, \"the old parsonage is big enough,\" she added with a  laugh.    \"Oh! you are so good and thoughtful, dear Mrs. Henderson,\" cried Mrs.  Pepper with delight at the thought of the homelike warmth of the  parsonage life awaiting the old gentleman, for whom she was dreading  the dreary hotel.    \"I'm good to ourselves,\" declared the parson's wife gaily.    Jasper gave a shout when the new arrangement was declared, as it  presently was by Percy and Van, who flung themselves after him as he  was seeing to the luggage with Ben, and his face glowed with the  greatest satisfaction.    \"That is jolly,\" he exclaimed, \"and that's a fact! Now, Ben, we're but  a stone's throw apart. Rather different, isn't it, old fellow, from the  time when I used to race over from Hingham with Prince at my heels?\"    Dr. Fisher's little thin, wiry figure was now seen advancing upon the  central group, and everybody fell away to let him have his chance to  welcome the Peppers.    \"I couldn't get here before,\" he cried, his eyes glowing behind his  spectacles. \"I've left a very sick patient. This is good,\" he took them  all in with a loving glance, but his hand held to Polly. \"Now I'm going  to drive you down in my gig,\" he said to her at last. \"Will you come?\"    \"Yes, indeed,\" cried Polly in delight, as her mother smiled approval,  and she ran off to let him help her in. \"It's only yesterday since you  took me to drive, Dr. Fisher, and you gave me my stove--is it?\" And so  she rambled on, the little doctor quite charmed to hear it all.    But Mr. Tisbett had a truly dreadful time placing his party in the old  stage, as the townsfolk, fearful that so good a chance for seeing the  Peppers would not happen during the three days' stay, insisted on  crowding up close to the ancient vehicle, and getting in everybody's  way, thereby calling forth some exclamations from Mr. King that could  not be regarded as exactly complimentary. And quite sure that he was a  frightful tyrant, they fell back with many a pitying glance at the  Pepper family whom he was endeavoring to assist into their places.    At last it was all accomplished in some way, and Mr. Tisbett cracked  his whip, Mrs. Pepper and Phronsie leaned out of the window to bow  right and left into smiling faces, Ben and Davie did the same over  their heads.    \"Good-by,\" sang out Joel, whom the stage driver had taken up beside  him. \"Here we are, off for the little brown house. G'lang!\"          VII    OLD TIMES AGAIN      \"Don't let me look--oh! don't let me look,\" cried Polly in the old gig,  and twisting around, she hid her face against the faded green cloth  side. \"I ought not to see the little brown house before Mamsie and the  others do.\"    \"I'll turn down the lane,\" said the little doctor, \"so\"; and suiting  the action to the word, Polly could feel that they were winding down  the narrow little road over toward Grandma Bascom's. She could almost  smell the violets and anemones under the carpet of snow, and could  scarcely restrain herself from jumping out for a riotous run.    \"Don't go too far away,\" she cried in sudden alarm. \"We must be there  by the time the stage does.\" And she applied her eye to the little  circular glass in the back of the gig. \"Will it never come--oh! here it  is, here it is, dear Dr. Fisher.\" And with a quick flourish around of  the old horse, they were soon before the little brown house, and  helping out the inmates of the stage, who with more speed than grace  were hurrying over the steps.    Joel was down before Mr. Tisbett had fairly drawn up in front of the  gate. \"Hold on,\" roared the stage driver, \"I don't want you to break  your neck with me.\"    \"It's really here!\" cried Phronsie with wide eyes, standing quite still  on a hummock of frozen snow, with her eyes riveted "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5637"],[0,"Literary and Philosophical Essays: French, German and Italian (#10)"],[1,"master bethinke himselfe whereto his charge  tendeth, and that he imprint not so much in his schollers mind the  date of the ruine of Carthage, as the manners of Hanniball and  Scipio, nor so much where Marcellus died, as because he was unworthy  of his devoire [Footnote: Task.] he died there: that he teach him  not so much to know Histories as to judge of them. It is amongst  things that best agree with my humour, the subject to which our  spirits doe most diversly applie themselves. I have read in Titus  Livius a number of things, which peradventure others never read, in  whom Plutarke haply read a hundred more than ever I could read, and  which perhaps the author himselfe did never intend to set downe. To  some kind of men it is a meere gramaticali studie, but to others a  perfect anatomie [Footnote: Dissection, analytical exposition.] of  Philosophie; by meanes whereof the secretest part of our nature is  searched into. There are in Plutarke many ample discourses most  worthy to be knowne: for in my judgement, he is the chiefe work-  master of such works, whereof there are a thousand, whereat he hath  but slightly glanced; for with his finger he doth but point us out a  way to walke in, if we list; and is sometimes pleased to give but a  touch at the quickest and maine point of a discourse, from whence  they are by diligent studie to be drawne, and so brought into open  market. As that saying of his, That the inhabitants of Asia served  but one alone, because they could not pronounce one onely syllable,  which is Non, gave perhaps both subject and occasion to my friend  Boetie to compose his booke of voluntarie servitude. If it were no  more but to see Plutarke wrest a slight action to mans life, or a  word that seemeth to beare no such sence, it will serve for a whole  discourse. It is pittie men of understanding should so much love  brevitie; without doubt their reputation is thereby better, but we  the worse. Plutarke had rather we should commend him for his  judgement than for his knowledge, he loveth better to leave a kind  of longing-desire in us of him, than a satietie. He knew verie well  that even in good things too much may be said: and that Alexandridas  did justly reprove him who spake verie good sentences to the  Ephores, but they were over tedious. Oh stranger, quoth he, thou  speakest what thou oughtest, otherwise then [Footnote: Than.] thou  shouldest. Those that have leane and thin bodies stuffe them up with  bumbasting. [Footnote: Padding.] And such as have but poore matter,  will puffe it up with loftie words. There is a marvelous  cleerenesse, or as I may terme it an enlightning of mans judgement  drawne from the commerce of men, and by frequenting abroad in the  world; we are all so contrived and compact in our selves, that our  sight is made shorter by the length of our nose. When Socrates was  demaunded whence he was, he answered, not of Athens, but of the  world; for he, who had his imagination more full and farther  stretching, embraced all the world for his native Citie, and  extended his acquaintance, his societie, and affections to all man-  kind: and not as we do, that looke no further than our feet. If the  frost chance to nip the vines about my village, my Priest doth  presently argue that the wrath of God hangs over our head, and  threatneth all mankind: and judgeth that the Pippe [Footnote: A  disease.] is alreadie falne upon the Canibals.    In viewing these intestine and civill broiles of ours, who doth not  exclaime, that this worlds vast frame is neere unto a dissolution,  and that the day of judgement is readie to fall on us? never  remembering that many worse revolutions have been seene, and that  whilest we are plunged in griefe, and overwhelmed in sorrow, a  thousand other parts of the world besides are blessed with  happinesse, and wallow in pleasures, and never thinke on us?  whereas, when I behold our lives, our licence, and impunitie, I  wonder to see them so milde and easie. He on whose head it haileth,  thinks all the Hemispheare besides to be in a storme and tempest.  And as that dull-pated Savoyard said, that if the seelie [Footnote  31: Simple.] King of France could cunningly have managed his  fortune, he might verie well have made himselfe chiefe Steward of  his Lords household, whose imagination conceived no other greatnesse  than his Masters; we are all insensible of this kind of errour: an  errour of great consequence and prejudice. But whosoever shall  present unto his inward eyes, as it were in a Table, the Idea of the  great image of our universall mother Nature, attired in her richest  robes, sitting in the throne of her Majestic, and in her visage  shall read so generall and so constant a varietie; he that therein  shall view himselfe, not himselfe alone, but a whole Kingdome, to be  in respect of a great circle but the smallest point that can be  imagined, he onely can value things according to their essentiall  greatnesse and proportion. This great universe (which some multiplie  as Species under one Genus) is the true looking-glasse wherein we  must looke, if we will know whether we be of a good stamp or in the  right byase. To conclude, I would have this worlds-frame to be my  Schollers choise-booke. [Footnote: Book of examples] So many strange  humours, sundrie sects, varying judgements, diverse opinions,  different lawes, and fantasticall customes teach us to judge rightly  of ours, and instruct our judgement to acknowledge his imperfections  and naturall weaknesse, which is no easie an apprentiship: So many  innovations of estates, so many fals of Princes, and changes of  publike fortune, may and ought to teach us, not to make so great  accompt of ours: So many names, so many victories, and so many  conquests buried in darke oblivion, makes the hope to perpetuate our  names but ridiculous, by the surprising of ten Argo-lettiers,  [Footnote: Mounted Bowmen.] or of a small cottage, which is knowne  but by his fall. The pride and fiercenesse of so many strange and  gorgeous shewes: the pride-puft majestie of so many courts, and of  their greatnesse, ought to confirme and assure our sight,  undauntedly to beare the affronts and thunder-claps of ours, without  feeling our eyes: So many thousands of men, lowlaide in their graves  afore us, may encourage us not to feare, or be dismaied to go meet  so good companie in the other world, and so of all things else. Our  life (said Pithagoras) drawes neare unto the great and populous  assemblies of the Olympike games, wherein some, to get the glorie  and to win the goale of the games, exercise their bodies with all  industrie; others, for greedinesse of gaine, bring thither  marchandise to sell: others there are (and those be not the worst)  that seek after no other good, but to marke how wherefore, and to  what end, all things are done: and to be spectators or observers of  other mens lives and actions, that so they may the better judge and  direct their owne. Unto examples may all the most profitable  Discourses of Philosophic be sorted, which ought to be the touch-  stone of human actions, and a rule to square them by, to whom may be  said,        ---quid fas optare, quid asper       Vtile nummus habet, patriae charisque propinquis       Quantum elargiri deceat, quem te Deus esse       lussit, et humana qua parte locaius es in re.       [Footnote: Pers. Sat. iii. 69.]       Quid sumus, aut quidnam victuri gignimur.       [Footnote: Ib. 67.]         What thou maiest wish, what profit may come cleare,       From new-stampt coyne, to friends and countrie deare       What thou ought'st give: whom God would have thee bee,       And in what part mongst men he placed thee.       What we are, and wherefore,       To live heer we were bore.    What it is to know, and not to know (which ought to be the scope of  studie), what valour, what temperance, and what justice is: what  difference there is betweene ambition and avarice, bondage and  freedome, subjection and libertie, by which markes a man may  distinguish true and perfect contentment, and how far-forth one  ought to feare or apprehend death, griefe, or shame.         Et quo quemque modo fugiatque. feratque laborem.       [Footnote: Virg. Aen. 1. iii. 853.]         How ev'ry labour he may plie,       And beare, or ev'ry labour flie.    What wards or springs move us, and the causes of so many motions in  us: For me seemeth, that the first discourses, wherewith his conceit  should be sprinkled, ought to be those that rule his manners and  direct his sense; which will both teach him to know himselfe, and  how to live and how to die well. Among the liberall Sciences, let us  begin with that which makes us free: Indeed, they may all, in some  sort stead us, as an instruction to our life, and use of it, as all  other things else serve the same to some purpose or other. But let  us make especiall choice of that which may directly and pertinently  serve the same. If we could restraine and adapt the appurtenances of  our life to their right byase and naturall limits, we should find  the best part of the Sciences that now are in use, cleane out of  fashion with us: yea, and in those that are most in use, there are  certaine by-wayes and deep-flows most profitable, which we should do  well to leave, and according to the institution of Socrates, limit  the course of our studies in those where profit is wanting.                        ----sapere aude,       Incipe: vivendi qui recte prorogat horam,       Rusticus expectat dum defluat amnis, at ille       Labitur, et labetur in omne volubilis avum.
