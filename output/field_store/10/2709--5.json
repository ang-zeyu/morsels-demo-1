[47] When the league was formed, these separate portions readily resumed  their ancient tie of fraternity. Thus, of the Turtle clan, all the  members became brothers again, nominal members of one family, whether  Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas, or Senecas; and so, too, of the  remaining clans. All the Iroquois, irrespective of nationality, were  therefore divided into eight families, each tracing its descent to a  common mother, and each designated by its distinctive emblem or totem.  This connection of clan or family was exceedingly strong, and by it the  five nations of the league were linked together as by an eightfold  chain.    [47] With a view to clearness, the above statement is made categorical.  It requires, however, to be qualified. It is not quite certain, that, at  the formation of the confederacy, there were eight clans, though there  is positive proof of the existence of seven. Neither is it certain,  that, at the separation, every clan was represented in every nation.  Among the Mohawks and Oneidas there is no positive proof of the  existence of more than three clans,--the Wolf, Bear, and Tortoise;  though there is presumptive evidence of the existence of several  others.--See Morgan, 81, note.    The eight clans of the Iroquois were as follows: Wolf, Bear, Beaver,  Tortoise, Deer, Snipe, Heron, Hawk. (Morgan, 79.) The clans of the Snipe  and the Heron are the same designated in an early French document as La  famille du Petit Pluvier and La famille du Grand Pluvier. (New York  Colonial Documents, IX. 47.) The anonymous author of this document adds  a ninth clan, that of the Potato, meaning the wild Indian potato,  Glycine apios. This clan, if it existed, was very inconspicuous, and of  little importance.    Remarkable analogies exist between Iroquois clanship and that of other  tribes. The eight clans of the Iroquois were separated into two  divisions, four in each. Originally, marriage was interdicted between  all the members of the same division, but in time the interdict was  limited to the members of the individual clans. Another tribe, the  Choctaws, remote from the Iroquois, and radically different in language,  had also eight clans, similarly divided, with a similar interdict of  marriage.--Gallatin, Synopsis, 109.    The Creeks, according to the account given by their old chief,  Sekopechi, to Mr. D. W. Eakins, were divided into nine clans, named in  most cases from animals: clanship being transmitted, as usual, through  the female.    The clans were by no means equal in numbers, influence, or honor. So  marked were the distinctions among them, that some of the early writers  recognize only the three most conspicuous,--those of the Tortoise, the  Bear, and the Wolf. To some of the clans, in each nation, belonged the  right of giving a chief to the nation and to the league. Others had the  right of giving three, or, in one case, four chiefs; while others could  give none. As Indian clanship was but an extension of the family  relation, these chiefs were, in a certain sense, hereditary; but the law  of inheritance, though binding, was extremely elastic, and capable of  stretching to the farthest limits of the clan. The chief was almost  invariably succeeded by a near relative, always through the female, as a  brother by the same mother, or a nephew by the sister's side. But if  these were manifestly unfit, they were passed over, and a chief was  chosen at a council of the clan from among remoter kindred. In these  cases, the successor is said to have been nominated by the matron of the  late chief's household. [48] Be this as it may, the choice was never  adverse to the popular inclination. The new chief was \"raised up,\" or  installed, by a formal council of the sachems of the league; and on  entering upon his office, he dropped his own name, and assumed that  which, since the formation of the league, had belonged to this especial  chieftainship.    [48] Lafitau, I. 471.    The number of these principal chiefs, or, as they have been called by  way of distinction, sachems, varied in the several nations from eight to  fourteen. The sachems of the five nations, fifty in all, assembled in  council, formed the government of the confederacy. All met as equals,  but a peculiar dignity was ever attached to the Atotarho of the  Onondagas.    There was a class of subordinate chiefs, in no sense hereditary, but  rising to office by address, ability, or valor. Yet the rank was clearly  defined, and the new chief installed at a formal council. This class  embodied, as might be supposed, the best talent of the nation, and the  most prominent warriors and orators of the Iroquois have belonged to it.  In its character and functions, however, it was purely civil. Like the  sachems, these chiefs held their councils, and exercised an influence  proportionate to their number and abilities.    There was another council, between which and that of the subordinate  chiefs the line of demarcation seems not to have been very definite. The  Jesuit Lafitau calls it \"the senate.\" Familiar with the Iroquois at the  height of their prosperity, he describes it as the central and  controlling power, so far, at least, as the separate nations were  concerned. In its character it was essentially popular, but popular in  the best sense, and one which can find its application only in a small  community. Any man took part in it whose age and experience qualified  him to do so. It was merely the gathered wisdom of the nation. Lafitau  compares it to the Roman Senate, in the early and rude age of the  Republic, and affirms that it loses nothing by the comparison. He thus  describes it: \"It is a greasy assemblage, sitting sur leur derriÃ¨re,  crouched like apes, their knees as high as their ears, or lying, some on  their bellies, some on their backs, each with a pipe in his mouth,  discussing affairs of state with as much coolness and gravity as the  Spanish Junta or the Grand Council of Venice.\" [49]    [49] Lafitau, I. 478.    The young warriors had also their councils; so, too, had the women; and  the opinions and wishes of each were represented by means of deputies  before the \"senate,\" or council of the old men, as well as before the  grand confederate council of the sachems.    The government of this unique republic resided wholly in councils. By  councils all questions were settled, all regulations  established,--social, political, military, and religious. The war-path,  the chase, the council-fire,--in these was the life of the Iroquois; and  it is hard to say to which of the three he was most devoted.    The great council of the fifty sachems formed, as we have seen, the  government of the league. Whenever a subject arose before any of the  nations, of importance enough to demand its assembling, the sachems of  that nation might summon their colleagues by means of runners, bearing  messages and belts of wampum. The usual place of meeting was the valley  of Onondaga, the political as well as geographical centre of the  confederacy. Thither, if the matter were one of deep and general  interest, not the sachems alone, but the greater part of the population,  gathered from east and west, swarming in the hospitable lodges of the  town, or bivouacked by thousands in the surrounding fields and forests.  While the sachems deliberated in the council-house, the chiefs and old  men, the warriors, and often the women, were holding their respective  councils apart; and their opinions, laid by their deputies before the  council of sachems, were never without influence on its decisions.    The utmost order and deliberation reigned in the council, with rigorous  adherence to the Indian notions of parliamentary propriety. The  conference opened with an address to the spirits, or the chief of all  the spirits. There was no heat in debate. No speaker interrupted  another. Each gave his opinion in turn, supporting it with what reason  or rhetoric he could command,--but not until he had stated the subject  of discussion in full, to prove that he understood it, repeating also  the arguments, pro and con, of previous speakers. Thus their debates  were excessively prolix; and the consumption of tobacco was immoderate.  The result, however, was a thorough sifting of the matter in hand; while  the practised astuteness of these savage politicians was a marvel to  their civilized contemporaries. \"It is by a most subtle policy,\" says  Lafitau, \"that they have taken the ascendant over the other nations,  divided and overcome the most warlike, made themselves a terror to the  most remote, and now hold a peaceful neutrality between the French and  English, courted and feared by both.\" [50]    [50] Lafitau, I. 480.--Many other French writers speak to the same  effect. The following are the words of the soldier historian, La  Potherie, after describing the organization of the league: \"C'est donc  lÃ  cette politique qui les unit si bien, Ã  peu prÃ¨s comme tous les  ressorts d'une horloge, qui par une liaison admirable de toutes les  parties qui les composent, contribuent toutes unanimement au merveilleux  effet qui en resulte.\"--Hist. de l'AmÃ©rique Septentrionale, III. 32.--He  adds: \"Les FranÃ§ois ont avoÃ¼Ã© eux-mÃªmes qu'ils Ã©toient nez pour la  guerre, & quelques maux qu'ils nous ayent faits nous les avons toujours  estimez.\"--Ibid., 2.--La Potherie's book was published in 1722.    Unlike the Hurons, they required an entire unanimity in their decisions.  The ease and frequency with which a requisition seemingly so difficult  was fulfilled afford a striking illustration of Indian nature,--on one  side, so stubborn, tenacious, and impracticable; on the other, so pliant  and acquiescent. An explanation of this harmony is to be found also in  an intense spirit of nationality: for never since the days of Sparta  were individual life and national life more completely fused into one.

This key is made in three sizes and the first will  carry a current of 5 _amperes_[Footnote: See _Appendix_ for  definition.] and costs $4.00, the second will carry a current of 10  amperes and costs $6.50, while the third will carry a current of 20  amperes and costs $7.50.    The Spark Gap.--Either a fixed, a rotary, or a quenched spark gap can  be used with this set, but the former is seldom used except with  spark-coil sets, as it is very hard to keep the sparks from arcing  when large currents are used. A rotary spark gap comprises a wheel,  driven by a small electric motor, with projecting plugs, or  electrodes, on it and a pair of stationary plugs on each side of the  wheel as shown at C. The number of sparks per second can be varied by  changing the speed of the wheel and when it is rotated rapidly it  sends out signals of a high pitch which are easy to read at the  receiving end. A rotary gap with a 110-volt motor costs about $25.00.    A quenched spark gap not only eliminates the noise of the ordinary gap  but, when properly designed, it increases the range of an induction  coil set some 200 per cent. A 1/4 kilowatt quenched gap costs $10.00.  [Footnote: See Appendix for definition.]    The High Tension Condenser.--Since, if you are an amateur, you can  only send out waves that are 200 meters in length, you can only use a  condenser that has a capacitance of .007 _microfarad_. [Footnote: See  Appendix for definition.] A sectional high tension condenser like the  one described in connection with _Set No. 1_ can be used with this  set but it must have a capacitance of not more than .007 microfarad. A  condenser of this value for a 1/4-kilowatt transformer costs $7.00;  for a 1/2-kilowatt transformer $14.00, and for a 1-kilowatt  transformer $21.00. See E, Fig. 19.    The Oscillation Transformer.--With an oscillation transformer you can  tune much more sharply than with a single inductance coil tuner. The  primary coil is formed of 6 turns of copper strip, or No. 9 copper  wire, and the secondary is formed of 9 turns of strip, or wire. The  primary coil, which is the outside coil, is hinged to the base and can  be raised or lowered like the lid of a box. When it is lowered the  primary and secondary coils are in the same plane and when it is  raised the coils set at an angle to each other. It is shown at D and  costs $5.00.    Connecting Up the Apparatus. For Alternating Current.--Screw the key  to the table about the middle of it and near the front edge; place the  high tension condenser back of it and the oscillation transformer back  of the latter; set the alternating current transformer to the left of  the oscillation transformer and place the rotary or quenched spark gap  in front of it.    Now bring a pair of _No. 12_ or _14_ insulated wires from the 110 volt  lighting leads and connect them with a single-throw, double-pole  switch; connect one pole of the switch with one of the posts of the  primary coil of the alternating power transformer and connect the  other post of the latter with one of the posts of your key, and the  other post of this with the other pole of the switch. Now connect the  motor of the rotary spark gap to the power circuit and put a  single-pole, single-throw switch in the motor circuit, all of which is  shown at A in Fig. 22.    [Illustration: (A) Fig. 22.--Top View of Apparatus Layout for Sending  Set No. 2.]    [Illustration: (B) Fig. 22.--Wiring Diagram for Sending Set No. 2.]    Next connect the posts of the secondary coil to the posts of the  rotary or quenched spark gap and connect one post of the latter to one  post of the condenser, the other post of this to the post of the  primary coil of the oscillation transformer, which is the inside coil,  and the clip of the primary coil to the other spark gap post. This  completes the closed oscillation circuit. Finally connect the post of  the secondary coil of the oscillation transformer to the ground and  the clip of it to the wire leading to the aerial when you are ready to  tune the set. A wiring diagram of the connections is shown at B.    For Direct Current.--Where you have 110 volt direct current you must  connect in an electrolytic interrupter. This interrupter, which is  shown at A and B in Fig. 23, consists of (1) a jar filled with a  solution of 1 part of sulphuric acid and 9 parts of water, (2) a lead  electrode having a large surface fastened to the cover of surface that  sets in a porcelain sleeve and whose end rests on the bottom of the  jar.    [Illustration: Fig. 23.--Using 110 Volt Direct Current with an  Alternating Current Transformer.]    When these electrodes are connected in series with the primary of a  large spark coil or an alternating current transformer, see C, and a  direct current of from 40 to 110 volts is made to pass through it, the  current is made and broken from 1,000 to 10,000 times a minute. By  raising or lowering the sleeve, thus exposing more or less of the  platinum, or alloy point, the number of interruptions per minute can  be varied at will. As the electrolytic interrupter will only operate  in one direction, you must connect it with its platinum, or alloy  anode, to the + or _positive_ power lead and the lead cathode to the -  or _negative_ power lead. You can find out which is which by  connecting in the interrupter and trying it, or you can use a polarity  indicator. An electrolytic interrupter can be bought for as little as  $3.00.    How to Adjust Your Transmitter. Tuning With a Hot Wire Ammeter.--A  transmitter can be tuned in two different ways and these are: (1) by  adjusting the length of the spark gap and the tuning coil so that the  greatest amount of energy is set up in the oscillating circuits, and  (2) by adjusting the apparatus so that it will send out waves of a  given length.    To adjust the transmitter so that the circuits will be in tune you  should have a _hot wire ammeter_, or radiation ammeter, as it is  called, which is shown in Fig. 24. It consists of a thin platinum wire  through which the high-frequency currents surge and these heat it; the  expansion and contraction of the wire moves a needle over a scale  marked off into fractions of an ampere. When the spark gap and tuning  coil of your set are properly adjusted, the needle will swing farthest  to the right over the scale and you will then know that the aerial  wire system, or open oscillation circuit, and the closed oscillation  circuit are in tune and radiating the greatest amount of energy.    [Illustration: Fig. 24.--Principle of the Hot Wire Ammeter.]    To Send Out a 200 Meter Wave Length.--If you are using a condenser  having a capacitance of .007 microfarad, which is the largest capacity  value that the Government will allow an amateur to use, then if you  have a hot wire ammeter in your aerial and tune the inductance coil or  coils until the ammeter shows the largest amount of energy flowing  through it you will know that your transmitter is tuned and that the  aerial is sending out waves whose length is 200 meters. To tune to  different wave lengths you must have a _wave-meter_.    The Use of the Aerial Switch.--Where you intend to install both a  transmitter and a receptor you will need a throwover switch, or  _aerial switch_, as it is called. An ordinary double-pole,  double-throw switch, as shown at A in Fig. 25, can be used, or a  switch made especially for the purpose as at B is handier because the  arc of the throw is much less.    [Illustration: Fig. 25.--Kinds of Aerial Switches.]    Aerial Switch for a Complete Sending and Receiving Set.--You can buy a  double-pole, double-throw switch mounted on a porcelain base for about  75 cents and this will serve for _Set No. 1_. Screw this switch on  your table between the sending and receiving sets and then connect one  of the middle posts of it with the ground wire and the other middle  post with the lightning switch which connects with the aerial. Connect  the post of the tuning coil with one of the end posts of the switch  and the clip of the tuning coil with the other and complementary post  of the switch. This done, connect one of the opposite end posts of the  switch to the post of the receiving tuning coil and connect the  sliding contact of the latter with the other and complementary post of  the switch as shown in Fig. 26.    [Illustration: Fig. 26.--Wiring Diagram for Complete Sending and  Receiving Set No. 1.]    Connecting in the Lightning Switch.--The aerial wire connects with the  middle post of the lightning switch, while one of the end posts lead  to one of the middle posts of the aerial switch. The other end post of  the lightning switch leads to a separate ground outside the building,  as the wiring diagrams Figs. 26 and 27 show.    [Illustration: Fig. 27.--Wiring Diagram for Complete Sending and  Receiving Set No. 2.]          CHAPTER V    ELECTRICITY SIMPLY EXPLAINED      It is easy to understand how electricity behaves and what it does if  you get the right idea of it at the start. In the first place, if you  will think of electricity as being a fluid like water its fundamental  actions will be greatly simplified. Both water and electricity may be  at rest or in motion. When at rest, under certain conditions, either  one will develop pressure, and this pressure when released will cause  them to flow through their respective conductors and thus produce a  current.    Electricity at Rest and in Motion.--Any wire or a conductor of any  kind can be charged with electricity, but a Leyden jar, or other  condenser, is generally used to hold an electric charge because it has  a much larger _capacitance_, as its capacity is called, than a wire.  As a simple analogue of a condenser, suppose you have a tank of water  raised above a second tank and that these are connected together by  means of a pipe with a"]]]
