Incident began early on the Monday.  We had sallied forth from a  desolate little junction within quite a few miles of Milchester, had  been caught in a shower, had run for shelter to a wayside inn. A  florid, overdressed man was drinking in the parlor, and I could have  sworn it was at the sight of him that Raffles recoiled on the  threshold, and afterwards insisted on returning to the station through  the rain.  He assured me, however, that the odor of stale ale had  almost knocked him down.  And I had to make what I could of his  speculative, downcast eyes and knitted brows.    Milchester Abbey is a gray, quadrangular pile, deep-set in rich woody  country, and twinkling with triple rows of quaint windows, every one of  which seemed alight as we drove up just in time to dress for dinner.  The carriage had whirled us under I know not how many triumphal arches  in process of construction, and past the tents and flag-poles of a  juicy-looking cricket-field, on which Raffles undertook to bowl up to  his reputation.  But the chief signs of festival were within, where we  found an enormous house-party assembled, including more persons of  pomp, majesty, and dominion than I had ever encountered in one room  before.  I confess I felt overpowered.  Our errand and my own presences  combined to rob me of an address upon which I have sometimes plumed  myself; and I have a grim recollection of my nervous relief when dinner  was at last announced.  I little knew what an ordeal it was to prove.    I had taken in a much less formidable young lady than might have fallen  to my lot.  Indeed I began by blessing my good fortune in this respect.  Miss Melhuish was merely the rector's daughter, and she had only been  asked to make an even number.  She informed me of both facts before the  soup reached us, and her subsequent conversation was characterized by  the same engaging candor. It exposed what was little short of a mania  for imparting information.  I had simply to listen, to nod, and to be  thankful.    When I confessed to knowing very few of those present, even by sight,  my entertaining companion proceeded to tell me who everybody was,  beginning on my left and working conscientiously round to her right.  This lasted quite a long time, and really interested me; but a great  deal that followed did not, and, obviously to recapture my unworthy  attention, Miss Melhuish suddenly asked me, in a sensational whisper,  whether I could keep a secret.    I said I thought I might, whereupon another question followed, in still  lower and more thrilling accents:    \"Are you afraid of burglars?\"    Burglars!  I was roused at last.  The word stabbed me.  I repeated it  in horrified query.    \"So I've found something to interest you at last!\" said Miss Melhuish,  in naive triumph. \"Yes--burglars!  But don't speak so loud.  It's  supposed to be kept a great secret.  I really oughtn't to tell you at  all!\"    \"But what is there to tell?\" I whispered with satisfactory impatience.    \"You promise not to speak of it?\"    \"Of course!\"    \"Well, then, there are burglars in the neighborhood.\"    \"Have they committed any robberies?\"    \"Not yet.\"    \"Then how do you know?\"    \"They've been seen.  In the district.  Two well-known London thieves!\"    Two!  I looked at Raffles.  I had done so often during the evening,  envying him his high spirits, his iron nerve, his buoyant wit, his  perfect ease and self-possession.  But now I pitied him; through all my  own terror and consternation, I pitied him as he sat eating and  drinking, and laughing and talking, without a cloud of fear or of  embarrassment on his handsome, taking, daredevil face.  I caught up my  champagne and emptied the glass.    \"Who has seen them?\" I then asked calmly.    \"A detective.  They were traced down from town a few days ago.  They  are believed to have designs on the Abbey!\"    \"But why aren't they run in?\"    \"Exactly what I asked papa on the way here this evening; he says there  is no warrant out against the men at present, and all that can be done  is to watch their movements.\"    \"Oh! so they are being watched?\"    \"Yes, by a detective who is down here on purpose.  And I heard Lord  Amersteth tell papa that they had been seen this afternoon at Warbeck  Junction!\"    The very place where Raffles and I had been caught in the rain!  Our  stampede from the inn was now explained; on the other hand, I was no  longer to be taken by surprise by anything that my companion might have  to tell me; and I succeeded in looking her in the face with a smile.    \"This is really quite exciting, Miss Melhuish,\" said I.  \"May I ask how  you come to know so much about it?\"    \"It's papa,\" was the confidential reply.  \"Lord Amersteth consulted  him, and he consulted me. But for goodness' sake don't let it get  about!  I can't think WHAT tempted me to tell you!\"    \"You may trust me, Miss Melhuish.  But--aren't you frightened?\"    Miss Melhuish giggled.    \"Not a bit!  They won't come to the rectory. There's nothing for them  there.  But look round the table: look at the diamonds: look at old  Lady Melrose's necklace alone!\"    The Dowager Marchioness of Melrose was one of the few persons whom it  had been unnecessary to point out to me.  She sat on Lord Amersteth's  right, flourishing her ear-trumpet, and drinking champagne with her  usual notorious freedom, as dissipated and kindly a dame as the world  has ever seen.  It was a necklace of diamonds and sapphires that rose  and fell about her ample neck.    \"They say it's worth five thousand pounds at least,\" continued my  companion.  \"Lady Margaret told me so this morning (that's Lady  Margaret next your Mr. Raffles, you know); and the old dear WILL wear  them every night.  Think what a haul they would be!  No; we don't feel  in immediate danger at the rectory.\"    When the ladies rose, Miss Melhuish bound me to fresh vows of secrecy;  and left me, I should think, with some remorse for her indiscretion,  but more satisfaction at the importance which it had undoubtedly given  her in my eyes.  The opinion may smack of vanity, though, in reality,  the very springs of conversation reside in that same human, universal  itch to thrill the auditor.  The peculiarity of Miss Melhuish was that  she must be thrilling at all costs.  And thrilling she had surely been.    I spare you my feelings of the next two hours. I tried hard to get a  word with Raffles, but again and again I failed.  In the dining-room he  and Crowley lit their cigarettes with the same match, and had their  heads together all the time.  In the drawing-room I had the  mortification of hearing him talk interminable nonsense into the  ear-trumpet of Lady Melrose, whom he knew in town.  Lastly, in the  billiard-room, they had a great and lengthy pool, while I sat aloof and  chafed more than ever in the company of a very serious Scotchman, who  had arrived since dinner, and who would talk of nothing but the recent  improvements in instantaneous photography.  He had not come to play in  the matches (he told me), but to obtain for Lord Amersteth such a  series of cricket photographs as had never been taken before; whether  as an amateur or a professional photographer I was unable to determine.  I remember, however, seeking distraction in little bursts of resolute  attention to the conversation of this bore.  And so at last the long  ordeal ended; glasses were emptied, men said good-night, and I followed  Raffles to his room.    \"It's all up!\" I gasped, as he turned up the gas and I shut the door.  \"We're being watched. We've been followed down from town.  There's a  detective here on the spot!\"    \"How do YOU know?\" asked Raffles, turning upon me quite sharply, but  without the least dismay.  And I told him how I knew.    \"Of course,\" I added, \"it was the fellow we saw in the inn this  afternoon.\"    \"The detective?\" said Raffles.  \"Do you mean to say you don't know a  detective when you see one, Bunny?\"    \"If that wasn't the fellow, which is?\"    Raffles shook his head.    \"To think that you've been talking to him for the last hour in the  billiard-room and couldn't spot what he was!\"    \"The Scotch photographer--\"    I paused aghast.    \"Scotch he is,\" said Raffles, \"and photographer he may be.  He is also  Inspector Mackenzie of Scotland Yard--the very man I sent the message  to that night last April.  And you couldn't spot who he was in a whole  hour! O Bunny, Bunny, you were never built for crime!\"    \"But,\" said I, \"if that was Mackenzie, who was the fellow you bolted  from at Warbeck?\"    \"The man he's watching.\"    \"But he's watching us!\"    Raffles looked at me with a pitying eye, and shook his head again  before handing me his open cigarette-case.    \"I don't know whether smoking's forbidden in one's bedroom, but you'd  better take one of these and stand tight, Bunny, because I'm going to  say something offensive.\"    I helped myself with a laugh.    \"Say what you like, my dear fellow, if it really isn't you and I that  Mackenzie's after.\"    \"Well, then, it isn't, and it couldn't be, and nobody but a born Bunny  would suppose for a moment that it was!  Do you seriously think he  would sit there and knowingly watch his man playing pool under his  nose?  Well, he might; he's a cool hand, Mackenzie; but I'm not cool  enough to win a pool under such conditions.  At least I don't think I  am; it would be interesting to see.  The situation wasn't free from  strain as it was, though I knew he wasn't thinking of us.  Crowley told  me all about it after dinner, you see, and then I'd seen one of the men  for myself this afternoon. You thought it was a detective who made me  turn tail at that inn.  I really don't know why I didn't tell you at  the time, but it was just the opposite.

The fact that they have made so  careful an examination of the castle would seem in itself to show that  they intended to renew the attempt in another form if the first onset  failed, and, moreover, the scattering of the force afterwards while the  knights still remained with a large body here points in the same  direction.\"    Guy on descending from the keep joined Sir Eustace and his wife in their  apartments.    \"The lad has borne himself bravely,\" Sir Eustace said approvingly to his  wife; \"he was standing beside me when their shot was bringing down the  dust round our ears, and he neither started nor flinched, though in truth  it was far from pleasant, especially as we had nothing to do but to look  on. It may be next time we shall have sterner fighting, and I doubt not  that he will bear himself well.\"    \"Could I not come up and carry your messages, father?\" Henry asked; \"I am  not strong like Guy, but I could do that.\"    \"He is too young for it yet, Eustace,\" Dame Margaret broke in.    \"Nay, wife,\" the knight said gently, \"the lad is not too young for such  service. There will be little danger in it, for his head will not show  over the battlements, and it is well that he should learn to hear without  fear the whizz of an arrow or the shock of a great stone from a ballista,  the clash of arms, and the shouting of men. As he says, he is not yet  strong enough to bear arms, but he will learn to brace his nerves and show  a bold front in danger; that is a lesson that cannot be learned too young.  Yes, Henry, you shall be my messenger. If they try an assault to-night,  you shall put on for the first time the steel cap and breastpiece I had  made for you in England; there will be no danger of your being hit by  crossbow bolt or arrow, but there may be splinters of stone flying when a  missile hits the battlement. Take no arms with you, only your dagger; they  would be useless to you, and would hamper your movements in getting past  the men on the wall, or in running up and down the steps leading to it.  Now you had better lie down; both Guy and myself are going to do so. At  sunset, if no alarm comes before, you will be called.\"    \"We must not coddle the boy, Margaret,\" he said as Guy and Henry went off.  \"I know that he is not physically strong as yet, and sorry I am that it  should be so, but he might exert himself more than he does, and he is apt  to think too much of his ailments. I was glad when he volunteered to do  something, for it is at least as well that he should be able to stand fire  even if he cannot learn the use of arms; moreover, it may be that after  once bearing a part in a fray he may incline more warmly to warlike  exercises than he has hitherto done; it may rouse in him a spirit which  has so far been wanting. I have often thought that it would have been  better if Agnes had been the boy and he the girl; she has far more courage  and fire than he has. You remember when that savage bull chased them, how  she saw him first over the stile and got tossed over after him for her  pains?\"    Dame Margaret nodded. \"I am not likely to forget it, Eustace, seeing that  her arm was broken and I had to nurse her for six weeks. Do you know that  she was up on the top of the keep while the fighting was going on? Of  course I was there myself, and she begged so hard to be allowed to remain  with me that I had not the heart to say her nay.\"    \"Was Henry there too?\"    \"Oh, yes; and shouted with the best of them when the enemy fled over the  hill. Even Charlie was there, and as excited as either of them. Of course,  I had to hold him up sometimes for him to be able to see what was going  on; and he looked rather pale at first, when they opened fire, but he soon  plucked up when he saw that their shot did no damage near us. You see he  is a strong healthy boy; while Henry has always been weak, although I do  not think that he lacks courage.\"    \"He ought not, wife; he comes from a fighting stock on either side. But I  fear that unless he changes greatly he is cut out rather for a monk than a  man-at-arms. And now I will lie down, for you may be sure that I shall not  close an eye to-night. Did you note the banner of Hugh de Fruges with the  others?\"    \"Yes, and I felt more uncomfortable after seeing it. He is a crafty man,  Eustace.\"    \"He is not a brave one,\" the knight said scornfully. \"I challenged him to  meet me outside in a fair field, and the craven did not answer me, and Sir  Clugnet had to make speech for him and decline the offer.\"    \"You will need all your vigilance, Eustace. I trust that every man within  the walls is faithful to us; but if there be a traitor, be sure that Sir  Hugh will endeavour to plot with him, nay, he may already have done so.\"    \"They would have no chance of making communication with him were there a  dozen of them, wife. Long Tom and his comrades will take good care that  none come near enough for speech.\"    The day passed away in perfect quiet. From time to time word came down  from the look-out that the scattered soldiers were returning laden with a  great quantity of young trees, wattles, and doors. Dame Margaret kept  watch in her room, and allowed no messengers to enter her husband's  apartments.    \"If there be need, I will wake him,\" she said; \"but he knows well enough  what the French have gone for, and there is naught to do until they  advance to the attack.\"    Guy slept but a short time, and as he frequently started up under the  impression that the horn was sounding an alarm, in the afternoon he got up  and went down into the courtyard. For some time he wandered about in the  quarters occupied by the tenants. These had now settled down; the children  were playing about as unconcernedly as if they had been on their fathers'  farms; women were washing clothes or preparing the evening meal over  little charcoal fires. A certain quantity of meat had been served out to  each family, and they were therefore doing better than in their own  houses, for meat was a luxury seldom touched by the French peasantry.    Almost all who had entered the castle had brought with them a supply of  herbs and vegetables; these, with a handful or two of coarsely-ground meal  boiled into broth, constituted their usual fare, and the addition of a  portion of meat afforded them great satisfaction. Some of the men were  still asleep, in preparation for a long night's work; others were standing  about talking in little groups; some were on the walls watching with  gloomy faces the smoke wreaths that still rose from what had been their  homes. Ducks, geese, and hens walked about unconcernedly looking for any  stray grains that had passed unnoticed when they had last been fed, and a  chorus of dissatisfied grunting arose from the pigs that had a large pen  in the yard next to the huts. These were still smarting under a sense of  injury excited not only by their removal from their familiar haunts, but  by the fact that most of them had been hastily marked by a clipping of  some kind in the ear in order to enable their owners to distinguish them  from the others. Boys were carrying buckets of water from a well in the  court-yard to the troughs for the cattle and horses, and the men-at-arms  were cleaning their armour and polishing their steel caps.    \"Well, Tom, I hope we shall get on as well to-night as we did this  morning,\" Guy said to the leader of the archers.    \"I hope so, Master Guy, but I would rather fight by day than by night; it  is random work when you can neither see your mark nor look straight along  your arrow. If we had a moon we should do well enough, but on these dark  nights skill does not go for much; still, I doubt not that we shall give a  good account of ourselves, for at any rate we shall be able to make them  out before they come to close work. The women have been making a great  store of torches to-day, and that will help us a bit, though I would that  they could be planted fifty yards beyond the moat instead of on the walls,  for although they will be of some use to us they will be of even more to  the enemy. What think you that their plan will be?\"    \"I should say that they are intending to march forward covered by mantlets  of wattles and hides. They will plant them near the edge of the moat, and  throw up some earthworks to shelter them and their machines; no doubt they  will use the doors they have fetched from all the farmhouses for the same  purpose.\"    \"The doors will be more to the point, certainly,\" the bowman said. \"As to  their hides and wattles, at fifty yards I will warrant our arrows go  through them as if they were paper; but I cannot say as much about stout  oaken doors--that is a target that I have never shot against; I fear that  the shock would shiver the shafts. The mantlets too would serve them to  some purpose, for we should not know exactly where they were standing  behind them. As for their machines, they cannot have many of them.\"    \"They had something like a score of waggons with them, Tom; these would  carry the beams for half a dozen big ballistas; besides, they have their  cannon.\"    \"I don't make much account of the cannon,\" the archer said; \"they take  pretty nearly an hour to load and fire them, and at that rate, however  hard a shot may hit, it would be some time before they wrought much damage  on the walls. It is the sound more than the danger that makes men afraid  of the things, and, for my part, I would not take the trouble of dragging  them about. They are all very well on the walls of a castle, though I see  not that even there they are of great advantage over the old machines. It  is true that they shoot further, but that is of no great use. It is when  the enemy come to attack that you want to kill them, and at fifty yards I  would kill more men "]]]
