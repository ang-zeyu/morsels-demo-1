Uncle Henry was astonished.    \"How can a wooden thing be so intelligent?\" he asked.    \"Why, I gave him some sawdust brains the last time I fitted his head  with new ears,\" explained the Wizard.  \"The sawdust was made from hard  knots, and now the Sawhorse is able to think out any knotty problem he  meets with.\"    \"I see,\" said Uncle Henry.    \"I don't,\" remarked Aunt Em; but no one paid any attention to this  statement.    Before long they came to a stately building that stood upon a green  plain with handsome shade trees grouped here and there.    \"What is that?\" asked Uncle Henry.    \"That,\" replied the Wizard, \"is the Royal Athletic College of Oz, which  is directed by Professor H. M. Wogglebug, T.E.\"    \"Let's stop and make a call,\" suggested Dorothy.    So the Sawhorse drew up in front of the great building and they were  met at the door by the learned Wogglebug himself.  He seemed fully as  tall as the Wizard, and was dressed in a red and white checked vest and  a blue swallow-tailed coat, and had yellow knee breeches and purple  silk stockings upon his slender legs.  A tall hat was jauntily set upon  his head and he wore spectacles over his big bright eyes.    \"Welcome, Dorothy,\" said the Wogglebug; \"and welcome to all your  friends.  We are indeed pleased to receive you at this great Temple of  Learning.\"    \"I thought it was an Athletic College,\" said the Shaggy Man.    \"It is, my dear sir,\" answered the Wogglebug, proudly.  \"Here it is  that we teach the youth of our great land scientific College  Athletics--in all their purity.\"    \"Don't you teach them anything else?\" asked Dorothy.  \"Don't they get  any reading, writing and 'rithmetic?\"    \"Oh, yes; of course.  They get all those, and more,\" returned the  Professor.  \"But such things occupy little of their time.  Please  follow me and I will show you how my scholars are usually occupied.  This is a class hour and they are all busy.\"    They followed him to a big field back of the college building, where  several hundred young Ozites were at their classes.  In one place they  played football, in another baseball.  Some played tennis, some golf;  some were swimming in a big pool.  Upon a river which wound through the  grounds several crews in racing boats were rowing with great  enthusiasm.  Other groups of students played basketball and cricket,  while in one place a ring was roped in to permit boxing and wrestling  by the energetic youths.  All the collegians seemed busy and there was  much laughter and shouting.    \"This college,\" said Professor Wogglebug, complacently, \"is a great  success.  Its educational value is undisputed, and we are turning out  many great and valuable citizens every year.\"    \"But when do they study?\" asked Dorothy.    \"Study?\" said the Wogglebug, looking perplexed at the question.    \"Yes; when do they get their 'rithmetic, and jogerfy, and such things?\"    \"Oh, they take doses of those every night and morning,\" was the reply.    \"What do you mean by doses?\" Dorothy inquired, wonderingly.    \"Why, we use the newly invented School Pills, made by your friend the  Wizard.  These pills we have found to be very effective, and they save  a lot of time.  Please step this way and I will show you our Laboratory  of Learning.\"    He led them to a room in the building where many large bottles were  standing in rows upon shelves.    \"These are the Algebra Pills,\" said the Professor, taking down one of  the bottles.  \"One at night, on retiring, is equal to four hours of  study.  Here are the Geography Pills--one at night and one in the  morning.  In this next bottle are the Latin Pills--one three times a  day.  Then we have the Grammar Pills--one before each meal--and the  Spelling Pills, which are taken whenever needed.\"    \"Your scholars must have to take a lot of pills,\" remarked Dorothy,  thoughtfully.  \"How do they take 'em, in applesauce?\"    \"No, my dear.  They are sugar-coated and are quickly and easily  swallowed.  I believe the students would rather take the pills than  study, and certainly the pills are a more effective method.  You see,  until these School Pills were invented we wasted a lot of time in study  that may now be better employed in practicing athletics.\"    \"Seems to me the pills are a good thing,\" said Omby Amby, who  remembered how it used to make his head ache as a boy to study  arithmetic.    \"They are, sir,\" declared the Wogglebug, earnestly.  \"They give us an  advantage over all other colleges, because at no loss of time our boys  become thoroughly conversant with Greek and Latin, Mathematics and  Geography, Grammar and Literature.  You see they are never obliged to  interrupt their games to acquire the lesser branches of learning.\"    \"It's a great invention, I'm sure,\" said Dorothy, looking admiringly at  the Wizard, who blushed modestly at this praise.    \"We live in an age of progress,\" announced Professor Wogglebug,  pompously.  \"It is easier to swallow knowledge than to acquire it  laboriously from books.  Is it not so, my friends?\"    \"Some folks can swallow anything,\" said Aunt Em, \"but to me this seems  too much like taking medicine.\"    \"Young men in college always have to take their medicine, one way or  another,\" observed the Wizard, with a smile; \"and, as our Professor  says, these School Pills have proved to be a great success.  One day  while I was making them I happened to drop one of them, and one of  Billina's chickens gobbled it up.  A few minutes afterward this chick  got upon a roost and recited 'The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck'  without making a single mistake.  Then it recited 'The Charge of the  Light Brigade' and afterwards 'Excelsior.'  You see, the chicken had  eaten an Elocution Pill.\"    They now bade good-bye to the Professor, and thanking him for his kind  reception mounted again into the red wagon and continued their journey.        10.  How the Cuttenclips Lived    The travelers had taken no provisions with them because they knew that  they would be welcomed wherever they might go in the Land of Oz, and  that the people would feed and lodge them with genuine hospitality.  So  about noon they stopped at a farm-house and were given a delicious  luncheon of bread and milk, fruits and wheat cakes with maple syrup.  After resting a while and strolling through the orchards with their  host--a round, jolly farmer--they got into the wagon and again started  the Sawhorse along the pretty, winding road.    There were signposts at all the corners, and finally they came to one  which read:      TAKE THIS ROAD TO THE CUTTENCLIPS      There was also a hand pointing in the right direction, so they turned  the Sawhorse that way and found it a very good road, but seemingly  little traveled.    \"I've never seen the Cuttenclips before,\" remarked Dorothy.    \"Nor I,\" said the Captain General.    \"Nor I,\" said the Wizard.    \"Nor I,\" said Billina.    \"I've hardly been out of the Emerald City since I arrived in this  country,\" added the Shaggy Man.    \"Why, none of us has been there, then,\" exclaimed the little girl.  \"I  wonder what the Cuttenclips are like.\"    \"We shall soon find out,\" said the Wizard, with a sly laugh.  \"I've  heard they are rather flimsy things.\"    The farm-houses became fewer as they proceeded, and the path was at  times so faint that the Sawhorse had hard work to keep in the road.  The wagon began to jounce, too; so they were obliged to go slowly.    After a somewhat wearisome journey they came in sight of a high wall,  painted blue with pink ornaments.  This wall was circular, and seemed  to enclose a large space.  It was so high that only the tops of the  trees could be seen above it.    The path led up to a small door in the wall, which was closed and  latched.  Upon the door was a sign in gold letters reading as follows:      VISITORS are requested to MOVE SLOWLY and CAREFULLY, and to avoid  COUGHING or making any BREEZE or DRAUGHT.      \"That's strange,\" said the Shaggy Man, reading the sign aloud.  \"Who  ARE the Cuttenclips, anyhow?\"    \"Why, they're paper dolls,\" answered Dorothy.  \"Didn't you know that?\"    \"Paper dolls!  Then let's go somewhere else,\" said Uncle Henry.  \"We're  all too old to play with dolls, Dorothy.\"    \"But these are different,\" declared the girl.  \"They're alive.\"    \"Alive!\" gasped Aunt Em, in amazement.    \"Yes.  Let's go in,\" said Dorothy.    So they all got out of the wagon, since the door in the wall was not  big enough for them to drive the Sawhorse and wagon through it.    \"You stay here, Toto!\" commanded Dorothy, shaking her finger at the  little dog.  \"You're so careless that you might make a breeze if I let  you inside.\"    Toto wagged his tail as if disappointed at being left behind; but he  made no effort to follow them.  The Wizard unlatched the door, which  opened outward, and they all looked eagerly inside.    Just before the entrance was drawn up a line of tiny soldiers, with  uniforms brightly painted and paper guns upon their shoulders.  They  were exactly alike, from one end of the line to the other, and all were  cut out of paper and joined together in the centers of their bodies.    As the visitors entered the enclosure the Wizard let the door swing  back into place, and at once the line of soldiers tumbled over, fell  flat upon their backs, and lay fluttering upon the ground.    \"Hi there!\" called one of them; \"what do you mean by slamming the door  and blowing us over?\"    \"I beg"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5173"],[0,"The Religion of the Samurai (#10)"],[1,"53.  It is still flourishing as the head  temple of the So To Sect.      In 1247, being requested by Toki-yori, the Regent General  (1247-1263), he came down to Kama-kura, where he stayed half a year  and went back to Ei-hei-ji.  After some time Toki-yori, to show his  gratitude for the master, drew up a certificate granting a large  tract of land as the property of Ei-hei-ji, and handed it over to  Gen-myo, a disciple of Do-gen.  The carrier of the certificate was so  pleased with the donation that he displayed it to all his brethren  and produced it before the master, who severely reproached him  saying: \"O, shame on thee, wretch!  Thou art -defiled by the desire  of worldly riches even to thy inmost soul, just as noodle is stained  with oil.  Thou canst not be purified from it to all eternity.  I am  afraid thou wilt bring shame on the Right Law.\"  On the spot Gen-myo  was deprived of his holy robe and excommunicated.  Furthermore, the  master ordered the 'polluted' seat in the Meditation Hall, where  Gen-myo was wont to sit, to be removed, and the 'polluted' earth  under the seat to be dug out to the depth of seven feet.    In 1250 the ex-Emperor Go-sa-ga (1243-1246) sent a special messenger  twice to the Ei-hei monastery to do honour to the master with the  donation of a purple robe, but he declined to accept it.  And when  the mark of distinction was offered for the third time, he accepted  it, expressing his feelings by the following verses:    \"Although in Ei-hei's vale the shallow waters leap,  Yet thrice it came, Imperial favour deep.  The Ape may smile and laugh the Crane  At aged Monk in purple as insane.\"    He was never seen putting on the purple robe, being always clad in  black, that was better suited to his secluded life.        4. The Social State of Japan when Zen was established by Ei-sai and  Do-gen.    Now we have to observe the condition of the country when Zen was  introduced into Japan by Ei-sai and Do-gen.  Nobilities that had so  long governed the island were nobilities no more.  Enervated by their  luxuries, effeminated by their ease, made insipient by their  debauchery, they were entirely powerless.  All that they possessed in  reality was the nominal rank and hereditary birth.  On the contrary,  despised as the ignorant, sneered at as the upstart, put in contempt  as the vulgar, the Samurai or military class had everything in their  hands.  It was the time when Yori-tomo[FN#79] (1148-1199) conquered  all over the empire, and established the Samurai Government at  Kama-kura.  It was the time when even the emperors were dethroned or  exiled at will by the Samurai.  It was the time when even the  Buddhist monks[FN#80] frequently took up arms to force their will.  It was the time when Japan's independence was endangered by Kublai,  the terror of the world.  It was the time when the whole nation was  full of martial spirit.  It is beyond doubt that to these rising  Samurais, rude and simple, the philosophical doctrines of Buddhism,  represented by Ten Dai and Shin Gon, were too complicated and too  alien to their nature.  But in Zen they could find something  congenial to their nature, something that touched their chord of  sympathy, because Zen was the doctrine of chivalry in a certain sense.      [FN#79]  The Samurai Government was first established by Yoritomo, of  the Minamoto family, in 1186, and Japan was under the control of the  military class until 1867, when the political power was finally  restored to the Imperial house.    [FN#80]  They were degenerated monks (who were called monk-soldiers),  belonging to great monasteries such as En-ryaku-ji (Hi-yei),  Ko-fuku-ji (at Nara), Mi-i-dera, etc.        5. The Resemblance of the Zen Monk to the Samurai.    Let us point out in brief the similarities between Zen and Japanese  chivalry.  First, both the Samurai and the Zen monk have to undergo a  strict discipline and endure privation without complaint.  Even such  a prominent teacher as Ei-sai, for example, lived contentedly in such  needy circumstances that on one occasion[FN#81] he and his disciples  had nothing to eat for several days.  Fortunately, they were  requested by a believer to recite the Scriptures, and presented with  two rolls of silk.  The hungry young monks, whose mouths watered  already at the expectation of a long-looked-for dinner, were  disappointed when that silk was given to a poor man, who called on  Ei-sai to obtain some help.  Fast continued for a whole week, when  another poor follow came in and asked Ei-sai to give something.  At  this time, having nothing to show his substantial mark of sympathy  towards the poor, Ei-sai tore off the gilt glory of the image of  Buddha Bhecajya and gave it.  The young monks, bitten both by hunger  and by anger at this outrageous act to the object of worship,  questioned Ei-sai by way of reproach: \"Is it, sir, right for us  Buddhists to demolish the image of a Buddha?\"  \"Well,\" replied Ei-sai  promptly, \"Buddha would give even his own life for the sake of  suffering people.  How could he be reluctant to give his halo?\"  This  anecdote clearly shows us self-sacrifice is of first importance in  the Zen discipline.    [FN#81]  The incident is told by Do-gen in his Zui-mon-ki.      6. The Honest Poverty of the Zen Monk and the Samurai.    Secondly, the so-called honest poverty is a characteristic of both  the Zen monk and the Samurai.  To get rich by an ignoble means is  against the rules of Japanese chivalry or Bushido.  The Samurai would  rather starve than to live by some expedient unworthy of his dignity.   There are many instances, in the Japanese history, of Samurais who  were really starved to death in spite of their having a hundred  pieces of gold carefully preserved to meet the expenses at the time  of an emergency; hence the proverb: \"The falcon would not feed on the  ear of corn, even if he should starve.\"  Similarly, we know of no  case of Zen monks, ancient and modern, who got rich by any ignoble  means.  They would rather face poverty with gladness of heart.  Fu-gai, one of the most distinguished Zen masters just before the  Restoration, supported many student monks in his monastery.  They  were often too numerous to be supported by his scant means.  This  troubled his disciple much whose duty it was to look after the  food-supply, as there was no other means to meet the increased demand  than to supply with worse stuff.  Accordingly, one day the disciple  advised Fu-gai not to admit new students any more into the monastery.   Then the master, making no reply, lolled out his tongue and said:  \"Now look into my mouth, and tell if there be any tongue in it.\"  The  perplexed disciple answered affirmatively.  \"Then don't bother  yourself about it.  If there be any tongue, I can taste any sort of  food.\"  Honest poverty may, without exaggeration, be called one of  the characteristics of the Samurais and of the Zen monks; hence a  proverb: \"The Zen monk has no money, moneyed Monto[FN#82] knows  nothing.\"      [FN#82]  The priest belonging to Shin Shu, who are generally rich.        7. The Manliness of the Zen Monk and of the Samurai.    Thirdly, both the Zen monk and the Samurai were distinguished by  their manliness and dignity in manner, sometimes amounting to  rudeness.  This is due partly to the hard discipline that they  underwent, and partly to the mode of instruction.  The following  story,[FN#83] translated by Mr. D. Suzuki, a friend of mine, may well  exemplify our statement:      [FN#83]  The Journal of the Pali Text Society, 1906-1907.      When Rin-zai[FN#84] was assiduously applying himself to Zen  discipline under Obak (Huang Po in Chinese, who died 850), the head  monk recognized his genius.  One day the monk asked him how long he  had been in the monastery, to which Rin-zai replied: 'Three years.'  The elder said: 'Have you ever approached the master and asked his  instruction in Buddhism?'  Rin-zai said: 'I have never done this, for  I did not know what to ask.'  'Why, you might go to the master and  ask him what is the essence of Buddhism?'      [FN#84]  Lin Tsi, the founder of the Lin Tsi school.      \"Rin-zai, according to this advice, approached Obak and repeated the  question, but before he finished the master gave him a slap.    \"When Rin-zai came back, the elder asked how the interview went.  Said Rin-zai: 'Before I could finish my question the master slapped  me, but I fail to grasp its meaning.'  The elder said: 'You go to him  again and ask the same question.'  When he did so, he received the  same response from the master.  But Rin-zai was urged again to try it  for the third time, but the outcome did not improve.    \"At last he went to the elder, and said 'In obedience to your kind  suggestion, I have repeated my question three times, and been slapped  three times.  I deeply regret that, owing to my stupidity, I am  unable to comprehend the hidden meaning of all this.  I shall leave  this place and go somewhere else.'  Said the elder: 'If you wish to  depart, do not fail to go and see the master to say him farewell.'    \"Immediately after this the elder saw the master, and said: 'That  young novice, who asked about Buddhism three times, is a remarkable  fellow.  When he comes to take leave of you, be so gracious as to  direct him properly.  After a hard training, he will prove to be a  great master, and, like a huge tree, he will give a refreshing  shelter to the world.'    \"When Rin-zai came to see the master, the latter advised him not to  go anywhere else, but to Dai-gu (Tai-yu) of Kaoan, for he would be  able to instruct him in the faith.    \"Rin-zai went to Dai-gu, who asked him whence he came.  Being  informed that he was from Obak, Dai-gu further inquired what  instruction he had under the master.  Rin-zai answered: 'I asked him  three times about the essence of Buddhism, and he slapped me three  times.  But I am yet unable to see whether I had any fault or not.'  Dai-gu said: 'Ob"]]]
