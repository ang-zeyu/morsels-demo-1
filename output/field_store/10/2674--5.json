The devil could not compel mankind to do evil; all was  voluntary. Those who resisted the Spirit of God, would be liable to  be led into temptation, and then the association of heaven would be  withdrawn from those who refused to be made partakers of such great  glory. God _would not_ exert any compulsory means, and the devil _could  not_; and such ideas as were entertained [on these subjects] by many  were absurd.\" What beautiful harmony between the Prophet's doctrine  here and that of the Apostle James: \"Let no man say when he is tempted,  I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither  tempteth he any man: But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of  his own lusts, and enticed. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringing  forth sin: and sin when it is finished, bringeth forth death.\" [30]    Of election, a term used generally in connection with reprobation, when  commenting on the 9th Chapter of Romans,--wherein Paul is supposed to  teach the doctrine of election,--the Prophet is represented as saying:  \"He then spoke on the subject of election, and read the 9th chapter of  Romans, from which it was evident that the election there spoken of  was pertaining to the flesh, and had reference to the seed of Abraham,  according to the promise God made to Abraham, saying, 'In thee, and in  thy seed, all the families of the earth shall be blessed.' * * * The  whole of the chapter had reference to the Priesthood and the house of  Israel: and unconditional election of individuals to eternal life was  not taught by the Apostles. God did elect or predestinate, that all  those who would be saved, should be saved in Christ Jesus, and through  obedience to the Gospel, but He passes over no man's sins, but visits  them with correction, and if His children will not repent of their sins  He will discard them.\"    These several doctrines mark rapid development in the Prophet's work  as an instructor in sacred things, and clearly indicate his increasing  capacity and power as Prophet, Seer and Teacher.

Commenting once in a half humorous way upon his \"exalted\" military  rank, the Prophet said to Josiah Quincy, who remarks that the Prophet  at the time of his visit to Nauvoo (May, 1843), was at the head of  3,000 men equipped by the state of Illinois, represents him as having  said:    \"I decided that the commander of my troops ought to be a  lieutenant-general, and I was, of course, chosen to that position.  I sent my certificate of election to Governor Ford, and received in  return a commission of lieutenant-general of the Nauvoo Legion of the  militia of the State of Illinois. Now, on examining the constitution  of the United States, I find that an officer must be tried by a  court martial composed of his equals in rank; and as I am the only  lieutenant-general in the country, I think they will find it pretty  hard to try me.\" _Figures of the Past_, p. 383.    4.

The Departure of the Twelve for England--Manifestation of God's Power  in Healing the Sick at Commerce.    [Sidenote: The Prophet's Literary Methods.]    _Friday, July 5, 1839._--I was dictating history, I say dictating, for  I seldom use the pen myself. I always dictate all my communications,  but employ a scribe to write them.    _Saturday, 6._--I was at home reviewing the Church records.    [Sidenote: Farewell to the Twelve.]    _Sunday, 7._--I was at the meeting held in the open air, at which a  large assemblage was expected to listen to the farewell address of the  Twelve, who were then about to take their departure on a most important  mission, namely to the nations of the earth and the islands of the sea.    Elder John E. Page being the first of the Twelve present, opened the  meeting by addressing a few words of an introductory nature; after  singing and prayer, Elder Page {2} delivered a very interesting  discourse on the subject of the Book of Mormon, recapitulating,  in short terms, the principles of a former discourse on the same  subject, and afterwards proceeded to read portions from the Bible and  Book of Mormon concerning the best criterions whereby to judge of  the authenticity of the latter; and then went on to show in a very  satisfactory manner, that no impostor would ever attempt to make such  promises as are contained on pages five hundred forty-one, [1] and five  hundred and thirty-four. [2] He then bore testimony.    After noon the meeting was again opened by prayer. Elder John Taylor  spoke on the subject of this dispensation; the other angel which John  saw, having the everlasting Gospel to preach, he then bore testimony of  the truth of the Book of Mormon.    Elder Woodruff's address went chiefly to exhortation to the Saints;  after which he also bore his testimony.    Elder Orson Hyde next came forward, and having alluded to his own late  fall, [3] exhorted all to perseverance in the things of God, expressed  himself one with his brethren, and bore testimony to his knowledge of  the truth, and the misery of falling from it.    Elder Brigham Young made some very appropriate remarks, and also bore  testimony to the truth of these things, and gave an invitation to come  forward and be baptized, when three manifested their determination to  renounce the world and take upon themselves the name of Jesus Christ.  One brother was then confirmed; after which President Sidney Rigdon  addressed the meeting in a very feeling manner. He showed that it must  be no small matter which could induce men to leave their families  and their homes to travel over all the earth amidst persecutions and  trials, such as always followed the preaching of this Gospel. He then  addressed himself to {3} the Twelve and gave them some counsel and  consolation as far as lay in his power; after which I requested their  prayers, and promised to pray for them.    The meeting was large and respectable; a great number were present  who did not belong to the Church. The most perfect order prevailed  throughout. The meeting was dismissed about half-past five, when we  repaired to the water, and the three candidates were baptized and  confirmed.    [Sidenote: The L. D. S. Hymn Book.]    _Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, 8th, 9th and 10th of July_.--I was with  the Twelve selecting hymns, for the purpose of compiling a hymn book.    About this time much sickness began to manifest itself among the  brethren, as well as among the inhabitants of the place, so that this  week and the following were generally spent in visiting the sick and  administering to them; some had faith enough and were healed; others  had not.    [Sidenote: Administration to the sick.]    _Sunday, 21_.--There was no meeting on account of much rain and much  sickness; however many of the sick were this day raised up by the power  of God, through the instrumentality of the Elders of Israel ministering  unto them in the name of Jesus Christ.    _Monday and Tuesday, 22nd and 23rd_.--The sick were administered  unto with great success, [4] but many remain sick, and new cases are  occurring daily.    {4} _Discourses by the Brothers Pratt_.    _Sunday 28_.--Meeting was held as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60736"],[0,"History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Volume 5 (#10)"],[1,"\"_Gods_\" in the revelation on marriage and in  other revelations, tends to prove common authorship. In the revelation  on marriage we have the following: \"And henceforth are not _Gods_, but  are angels of God forever and ever\" (v. 17); \"it cannot be received  there because the angels and the _Gods_ are appointed there, by whom  they cannot pass\" etc. (v. 18); \"then shall they be _Gods_ because they  have no end; then shall they be _Gods_ because they have all power\"  (v. 20); and sit upon thrones, and are not angels, but are _Gods_ (v.  36); in the revelation called the Vision, Doc. and Cov. Sec. 76, which  revelation was given in February, 1832, and first published in {XL}  the _Evening and Morning Star_ of July, 1833, (vol. 1, number 2, p.  28) occurs the following: \"And are priests of the most high, * * *  wherefore, as it is written, they are _Gods_ even the Sons of God\" (v.  58) also in Sec. 121; \"Nothing shall be withheld, whether there be one  God or many _Gods_, they shall be manifest (v. 28); according to that  which was ordained in the midst of the Council of the Eternal God of  all other _Gods_, before this world was\" (v. 32).    The phrase, \"My house is a house of order,\" is used in the revelation  on marriage (v. 18), also in Doc. and Cov., section 88, the phrase  occurs, \"a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God\" (v. 119);  \"this shall be the order of the house of the presidency\" (v. 128).    In closing the revelation on marriage the paragraph reads as follows:  \"And now, as pertaining to this law, verily, verily I say unto you,  I will reveal more unto you hereafter; therefore let this suffice  for the present. Behold, I am Alpha and Omega. Amen.\" This is  somewhat characteristic of the closing of a number of revelations  in the Doctrine and Covenants. The revelation in section 60 closes  with--\"Behold, this is sufficient for you * * * the residue hereafter.  Even so. Amen.\" Section 84 closes, \"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning  and the end. Amen\" (v. 120). Section 94 closes: \"And now I give you no  more at this time\" (v. 17). Section 95 closes \"Let the higher part of  the inner court be dedicated unto me for the school of mine apostles,  saith Son Ahman; or in other words, Alphus, or in other words, Omegus,  even Jesus Christ your Lord. Amen\" (v. 17).    In other revelations the expression Alpha and Omega comes in the body  of the revelation as for instance in section 45, \"Verily I say unto you  that I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the light and  life of the world\" (v. 7). The same phraseology is used in the body of  section 63, v. 60.    In section 19 it opens the revelation, \"I am Alpha and Omega, Christ  the Lord, yea even I am He, the beginning and the end, the Redeemer  of the world\" (v. 1). \"Behold, and hearken unto the voice of Him who  has all power, who is from everlasting to everlasting, even Alpha and  Omega, the beginning and the end\" (section 61, v. 1).    Other revelations close in the same impressive manner and with the  somewhat equivalent expressions in English, instead of the use of the  Greek terms, Alpha and Omega. Thus section 18 closes: \"Behold, I, Jesus  Christ, your Lord and your God and your Redeemer by the power of my  spirit have spoken it\" (v. 47). Section 1 ends, \"For behold and lo, the  Lord is God and the Spirit beareth record, and the record is true, and  the truth abideth forever and ever. Amen\" (v. 39).    The same occurs in section 75 and 14; but whether the phrase occurs  in the opening of the revelation or the middle of it, or in the  closing paragraph, it occurs with sufficient frequency to be noted  as a peculiarity {XLI} of the Prophet's phraseology, and aids in the  identification of his inspired style.    The term \"forgiveness of sin\" occurs in the revelation on marriage as  follows: \"Behold, I have seen your sacrifices [Joseph's], and will  forgive all your sins.\" This is both a principle and phraseology  frequent in the revelations, as an example, section 64: \"There are  those who have sought occasion against him (Joseph) without cause;  nevertheless he has sinned, but verily I say unto you, I, the Lord,  forgive sins unto those who confess their sins before me\" (v. 7). Let  the spirit of this be compared with the following from the revelation  on marriage: \"Let no one, therefore, set on my servant Joseph, for I  will justify him, for he shall do the sacrifices which I require at  his hands for his transgressions, saith the Lord your God\" (v. 60).  \"Again, verily I say, let mine handmaid forgive my servant Joseph his  trespasses, and then shall she be forgiven her trespasses wherein she  has trespassed against me\" (v. 56).    In the revelation on marriage occurs the following phraseology:  \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, that whatsoever you seal on earth,  shall be sealed in heaven; and whatsoever you bind on earth, in my  name, and by my word, saith the Lord, it shall be eternally bound in  the heavens\" (v. 46). The same phraseology is used in section 124  in speaking of Hyrum Smith, who was appointed to hold the keys of  the patriarchal blessings upon the heads of God's people; namely,  \"Whosoever he blesses shall be blessed, and whosoever he curses shall  be cursed; and whatsoever he shall bind on earth shall be bound in  heaven; and whatsoever he shall loose on earth shall be loosed in  heaven\" (v. 93). In section 128 the same phraseology is used in  describing the power of the priesthood (v. 8). And again in v. 10,  quoting it from the New Testament (Matt. 16: 18, 19).    In verse 26 on the revelation on marriage, this phraseology is found:  \"They shall be destroyed in the flesh and shall be delivered unto the  buffetings of Satan, unto the day of redemption, saith the Lord God.\"  The same phraseology occurs in section 82. \"The soul that sins * * *  shall be delivered over to the buffeting of Satan until the day of  redemption\" (v. 21). The same phraseology occurs in section 78, v.  12; section 104, v. 9, 10. In the revelation on marriage this passage  occurs: \"I give unto my servant Joseph, that he shall be made ruler  over many things, for he hath been faithful over a few things.\" In  Section 117 practically the some phraseology occurs with reference to  William Marks, \"Let my servant, William Marks, be faithful over a few  things, and he shall be a ruler over many.\"    Again it is said: \"and if they commit no murder, wherein they shed  innocent blood--yet they shall come forth in the first resurrection and  {XLII} enter into their exaltation; but they shall be destroyed in the  flesh, and shall be delivered unto the buffetings of Satan unto the  day of redemption, saith the Lord God\" (v. 26). \"The blasphemy against  the Holy Ghost, which shall not be forgiven in the world, nor out of  the world is in that ye commit murder, wherein ye shed innocent blood,  and assent unto my death after ye have received my new and everlasting  covenant\" (v. 27). That is to say, the doctrine is here set forth that  the murderer hath not eternal life abiding in him (1 John 3:15). There  is no forgiveness for him in this world or in the world to come. The  same idea is to be found in other revelations of Joseph Smith. Notably  in section 42: \"Behold, I speak unto the Church. Thou shalt not kill;  and he that kills shall not have forgiveness in this world nor in the  world to come\" (v. 18); \"if any persons among you shall kill, they  shall be delivered up and dealt with according to the law of the land;  for remember, that he hath no forgiveness\" (v. 79); then again and in  connection with breaking covenant, note the following expression: \"And  this is all according to the oath and covenant of the priesthood. *  * * But whoso breaketh this covenant, after he hath received it, and  altogether turned therefrom, shall not have forgiveness in this world  or in the world to come (v. 39-40).    The expression \"new and everlasting covenant\" (v. 4) occurs several  times in the revelation on marriage: \"as pertaining to the new and  everlasting covenant it was instituted,\" etc. (v. 6); \"if a man marry  a wife * * * * * by the new and everlasting covenant, and it is  sealed,\" etc. (v. 19). The phrase occurs a number of other times in the  revelation, viz., in verses 26, 27, 41 and 42. It occurs also in many  other revelations by Joseph Smith: In section 1--\"That mine everlasting  covenant might be established\" (v. 22); \"this is a new and everlasting  covenant\" (Sec. 22: 1); \"I have sent mine everlasting covenant into the  world\" (Sec. 45: 9); same in Sec. 49, 9; 66, 2; 76, 101; 78: 11, and in  at least a score of other sections.    _5. The Evidence of Recurrence of Principles in the Revelation on  Marriage That are Found in Other Revelations Through Joseph Smith_.    Principles that appear in previous revelations reappear in this  revelation on marriage: for example, it is said in Sec. 130: \"There is  a law irrevocably decreed in heaven, before the foundations of this  world, upon which all blessings are predicated; and when we obtain  any blessing from God it is by obedience to that law upon which it is  predicated.\" In Sec. 88, occurs the following: \"All kingdoms have a law  given: and there are many kingdoms; and unto every kingdom is given a  law; and unto every law there are certain bounds also and conditions.  All beings who abide not in those conditions are not justified,\" verse  {XLIII} 36 to 38. In the revelation on marriage this doctrine is set  forth in the following passage: \"No one can reject this covenant and be  permitted to enter into my glory; for all who will have a blessing at  my hands shall abide the law which was appointed for that blessing, and  the conditions thereof, as were instituted from before the foundation  of the world. * * * * * * * * * And will I appoint unto you, saith the  Lord, except it be by law, even as I and my Father ordained unto you,  before the world was! * * * * * * * * * * * I am the Lord thy"]]]
