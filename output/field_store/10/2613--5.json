It was above my head, but  afterward I secured it by means of a ladder, and carried it home.  Shortly there emerged a yet larger Cecropia, and luck seemed with  me.  I could find them everywhere through June, the time of their  emergence, later their eggs, and the tiny caterpillars that  hatched from them.  During the summer I found these caterpillars,  in different stages of growth, until fall, when after their last  moult and casting of skin, they reached the final period of  feeding; some were over four inches in length, a beautiful shade of  greenish blue, with red and yellow warty projections--tubercles,  according to scientific works.    It is easy to find the cocoons these caterpillars spin, because  they are the largest woven by any moth, and placed in such a variety  of accessible spots.  They can be found in orchards, high on branches,  and on water sprouts at the base of trees.  Frequently they are spun  on swamp willows, box-elder, maple, or wild cherry.  Mr. Black once  found for me the largest cocoon I ever have seen; a pale tan colour  with silvery lights, woven against the inside of a hollow log.  Perhaps the most beautiful of all, a dull red, was found under the  flooring of an old bridge crossing a stream in the heart of the swamp,  by a girl not unknown to fiction, who brought it to me.  In a deserted  orchard close the Wabash, Raymond once found a pair of empty  cocoons at the foot of a big apple tree, fastened to the same  twigs, and within two inches of each other.    But the most wonderful thing of all occurred when Wallace Hardison,  a faithful friend to my work, sawed a board from the roof of his  chicken house and carried to me twin Cecropia cocoons, spun so  closely together they were touching, and slightly interwoven.  By the closest examination I could discover slight difference  between them.  The one on the right was a trifle fuller in the body,  wider at the top, a shade lighter in colour, and the inner case  seemed heavier.    All winter those cocoons occupied the place of state in my collection.  Every few days I tried them to see if they gave the solid thump  indicating healthy pupae, and listened to learn if they were moving.  By May they were under constant surveillance.  On the fourteenth I  was called from home a few hours to attend the funeral of a friend.  I think nothing short of a funeral would have taken me, for the moth  from a single cocoon had emerged on the eleventh.  I hurried home  near noon, only to find that I was late, for one was out, and the  top of the other cocoon heaving with the movements of the second.    The moth that had escaped was a male.  It clung to the side of the  board, wings limp, its abdomen damp.  The opening from which it  came was so covered with terra cotta coloured down that I thought  at first it must have disfigured itself; but full development  proved it could spare that much and yet appear all right.    In the fall I had driven a nail through one corner of the board,  and tacked it against the south side of the Cabin, where I made  reproductions of the cocoons.  The nail had been left, and now it  suggested the same place.  A light stroke on the head of the nail,  covered with cloth to prevent jarring, fastened the board on a log.  Never in all my life did I hurry as on that day, and I called my  entire family into service.  The Deacon stood at one elbow, Molly-Cotton  at the other, and the gardener in the rear.  There was not a second  to be lost, and no time for an unnecessary movement; for in the heat  and bright sunshine those moths would emerge and develop with amazing  rapidity.    Molly-Cotton held an umbrella over them to prevent this as much as  possible; the Deacon handed plate holders, and Brenner ran errands.  Working as fast as I could make my fingers fly in setting up the camera,  and getting a focus, the second moth's head was out, its front feet  struggling to pull up the body; and its antennae beginning to lift,  when I was ready for the first snap at half-past eleven.    By the time I inserted the slide, turned the plate holder and  removed another slide, the first moth to appear had climbed up  the board a few steps, and the second was halfway  out.  Its  antennae were nearly horizontal now, and from its position I  decided that the wings as they lay in the pupa case were folded  neither to the back nor to the front, but pressed against the body  in a lengthwise crumpled mass, the heavy front rib, or costa, on  top.    Again I changed plates with all speed.  By the time I was ready  for the third snap the male had reached the top of the board, its  wings opened for the first time, and began a queer trembling  motion.  The second one had emerged and was running into the first,  so I held my  finger in the line of its advance, and when it  climbed on I lowered it to the edge to the board beside the  cocoons.  It immediately clung to the wood.  The big pursy  abdomen and smaller antennae, that now turned forward in position,  proved this a female.  The exposure was made not ten seconds after  she cleared the case, and with her back to the lens, so the position  and condition of the wings and antennae on emergence can be seen  clearly.    Quickly as possible I changed the plates again; the time that  elapsed could not have been over half a minute.  The male was trying  to creep up the wall, and the increase in the length and expansion  of the female's wings could be seen.  The colours on both were  exquisite, but they  grew a trifle less brilliant as the moths  became dry.    Again I turned to the business of plate changing.  The heat was  intense, and perspiration was streaming from my  face.  I called  to Molly-Cotton to shield the moths while I made the change.  \"Drat the moths!\" cried the Deacon.  \"Shade your mother!\"  Being  an obedient girl, she shifted the umbrella, and by the time I was  ready for business, the male was on the logs and travelling up the  side of the Cabin.  The female was climbing toward the logs also,  so that a side view showed her wings already beginning to lift  above her back.    I had only five snapshot plates in my holders, so I was compelled  to stop.  It was as well, for surely the record was complete, and  I was almost prostrate with excitement and heat.  Several days  later I opened each of the cocoons and made interior studies.  The  one on the right was split down the left side and turned back to  show the bed of spun silk of exquisite colour that covers the inner  case.  Some say this silk has no commercial value, as it is cut  in lengths reaching from the top around the inner case and back to  the top again; others think it can be used.  The one on the left  was opened down the front of the outer case, the silk parted and  the heavy inner case cut from top to bottom to show the smooth  interior wall, the thin pupa case burst by the exit of the moth,  and the cast caterpillar skin crowded at the bottom.    The pair mated that same night, and the female began laying eggs  by noon the following day.  She dotted them in lines over the  inside of her box, and on leaves placed in it, and at times piled  them in a heap instead of placing them as do these moths in  freedom.  Having taken a picture of a full-grown caterpillar of this  moth brought to me by Mr. Andrew Idlewine, I now had a complete  Cecropia history; eggs, full-grown caterpillars, twin cocoons, and  the story of the emergence of the moths that wintered in them.  I  do not suppose Mr. Hardison thought he was doing anything unusual  when he brought me those cocoons, yet by bringing them, he made  it possible for me to secure this series of twin Cecropia moths,  male and female, a thing never before recorded by lepidopterist  or photographer so far as I can learn.    The Cecropia is a moth whose acquaintance nature-loving city  people can cultivate.  In December of 1906, on a tree, maple I  think, near No. 2230 North Delaware Street, Indianapolis, I found  four cocoons of this moth, and on the next tree, save one, another.  Then I began watching, and in the coming days I counted them by  the hundred through the city.  Several bushels of these cocoons  could have been clipped in Indianapolis alone, and there is no  reason why any other city that has maple, elm, catalpa, and  other shade trees would not have as many; so that any one who  would like can find them easily.    Cecropia cocoons bewilder a beginner by their difference in shape.  You cannot determine the sex of the moth by the size of the  cocoon.  In the case of the twins, the cocoon of the female was  the larger; but I have known male and female alike to emerge from  large or small.  You are fairly sure of selecting a pair if you  depend upon weight.  The females are heavier than the males, because  they emerge with quantities of eggs ready to deposit as soon as they  have mated. If any one wants to winter a pair of moths, they  are reasonably sure of doing so by selecting the heaviest  and lightest cocoons they can find.    In the selection of cocoons, hold them to the ear, and with a  quick motion reverse them end for end.  If there is a dull, solid  thump, the moth is alive, and will emerge all right.  If this thump  is lacking, and there is a rattle like a small seed shaking in a  dry pod, it means that the caterpillar has gone into the cocoon  with one of the tiny parasites that infest these worms, clinging  to it, and the pupa has been eaten by the parasite.    In fall and late summer are the best times to find cocoons, as  birds tear open many of them in winter; and when weatherbeaten  they fade, and do not show the exquisite shadings of silk of those  newly spun.  When fresh, the colours range from almost white  through lightest tans and browns to a genuine red, and there is a  silvery effect that is lovely on some of the large, baggy ones,  hidden under bridges.  Out of doors the moths emerge in middle May  or June, but they are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4912"],[0,"Wacousta : a tale of the Pontiac conspiracy (Complete) (#10)"],[1,"ce: \"if my prayers of gratitude  to Heaven give offence, may the hour never come when my lips shall  pronounce their bitterest curse upon your severity!\"    There was something so painfully wild--so solemnly prophetic--in these  sounds of sorrow as they fell faintly upon the ear, and especially  under the extraordinary circumstances of the night, that they might  have been taken for the warnings of some supernatural agency. During  their utterance, not even the breathing of human life was to be heard  in the ranks. In the next instant, however, Sergeant-major Bletson was  seen repairing, with long and hasty strides, to the barrack whence the  voice proceeded, and the interruption was heard no more.    Meanwhile the officers, who had been summoned from the ranks for the  purpose of forming the court-martial, still lingered in the centre of  the square, apparently waiting for the order of their superior, before  they should resume their respective stations. As the quick and  comprehensive glance of Colonel de Haldimar now embraced the group, he  at once became sensible of the absence of one of the seniors, all of  whom he had desired should be selected for the court-martial.    \"Mr. Lawson,\" he remarked, somewhat sternly, as the Adjutant now  returned from delivering over his prisoner to Ensign Fortescue, \"I  thought I understood from your report the officers were all present!\"    \"I believe, sir, my report will be found perfectly correct,\" returned  the Adjutant, in a tone which, without being disrespectful, marked his  offended sense of the implication.    \"And Lieutenant Murphy--\"    \"Is here, sir,\" said the Adjutant, pointing to a couple of files of the  guard, who were bearing a heavy burden, and following into the square.  \"Lieutenant Murphy,\" he pursued, \"has been shot on the ramparts; and I  have, as directed by Captain Blessington, caused the body to be brought  here, that I may receive your orders respecting the interment.\" As he  spoke, he removed a long military grey cloak, which completely  enshrouded the corpse, and disclosed, by the light of the still  brightly flaming torches of the gunners, the features of the  unfortunate Murphy.    \"How did he meet his death?\" enquired the governor; without, however,  manifesting the slightest surprise, or appearing at all moved at the  discovery.    \"By a rifle shot fired from the common, near the old bomb proof,\"  observed Captain Blessington, as the adjutant looked to him for the  particular explanation he could not render himself.    \"Ah! this reminds me,\" pursued the austere commandant,--\"there was a  shot fired also from the ramparts. By whom, and at what?\"    \"By me, sir,\" said Lieutenant Valletort, coming forward from the ranks,  \"and at what I conceived to be an Indian, lurking as a spy upon the  common.\"    \"Then, Lieutenant Sir Everard Valletort, no repetition of these  firings, if you please; and let it be borne in mind by all, that  although, from the peculiar nature of the service in which we are  engaged, I so far depart from the established regulations of the army  as to permit my officers to arm themselves with rifles, they are to be  used only as occasion may require in the hour of conflict, and not for  the purpose of throwing a whole garrison into alarm by trials of skill  and dexterity upon shadows at this unseasonable hour.\"    \"I was not aware, sir,\" returned Sir Everard proudly, and secretly  galled at being thus addressed before the men, \"it could be deemed a  military crime to destroy an enemy at whatever hour he might present  himself, and especially on such an occasion as the present. As for my  firing at a shadow, those who heard the yell that followed the second  shot, can determine that it came from no shadow, but from a fierce and  vindictive enemy. The cry denoted even something more than the ordinary  defiance of an Indian: it seemed to express a fiendish sentiment of  personal triumph and revenge.\"    The governor started involuntarily. \"Do you imagine, Sir Everard  Valletort, the aim of your rifle was true--that you hit him?\"    This question was asked so hurriedly, and in a tone so different from  that in which he had hitherto spoken, that the officers around  simultaneously raised their eyes to those of their colonel with an  expression of undissembled surprise. He observed it, and instantly  resumed his habitual sternness of look and manner.    \"I rather fear not, sir,\" replied Sir Everard, who had principally  remarked the emotion; \"but may I hope (and this was said with  emphasis), in the evident disappointment you experience at my want of  success, my offence may be overlooked?\"    The governor fixed his penetrating eyes on the speaker, as if he would  have read his inmost mind; and then calmly, and even impressively,  observed,--    \"Sir Everard Valletort, I do overlook the offence, and hope you may as  easily forgive yourself. It were well, however, that your indiscretion,  which can only find its excuse in your being so young an officer, had  not been altogether without some good result. Had you killed or  disabled the--the savage, there might have been a decent palliative  offered; but what must be your feelings, sir, when you reflect, the  death of yon officer,\" and he pointed to the corpse of the unhappy  Murphy, \"is, in a great degree, attributable to yourself? Had you not  provoked the anger of the savage, and given a direction to his aim by  the impotent and wanton discharge of your own rifle, this accident  would never have happened.\"    This severe reproving of an officer, who had acted from the most  praiseworthy of motives, and who could not possibly have anticipated  the unfortunate catastrophe that had occurred, was considered  especially harsh and unkind by every one present; and a low and almost  inaudible murmur passed through the company to which Sir Everard was  attached. For a minute or two that officer also appeared deeply pained,  not more from the reproof itself than from the new light in which the  observation of his chief had taught him to view, for the first time,  the causes that had led to the fall of Murphy. Finding, however, that  the governor had no further remark to address to him, he once more  returned to his station in the ranks.    \"Mr. Lawson,\" resumed the commandant, turning to the adjutant, \"let  this victim be carried to the spot on which he fell, and there  interred. I know no better grave for a soldier than beneath the sod  that has been moistened with his blood. Recollect,\" he continued, as  the adjutant once more led the party out of the area,--\"no firing, Mr.  Lawson. The duty must be silently performed, and without the risk of  provoking a forest of arrows, or a shower of bullets from the savages.  Major Blackwater,\" he pursued, as soon as the corpse had been removed,  \"let the men pile their arms even as they now stand, and remain ready  to fall in at a minute's notice. Should any thing extraordinary happen  before the morning, you will, of course, apprise me.\" He then strode  out of the area with the same haughty and measured step that had  characterised his entrance.    \"Our colonel does not appear to be in one of his most amiable moods  to-night,\" observed Captain Blessington, as the officers, after having  disposed of their respective companies, now proceeded along the  ramparts to assist at the last funeral offices of their unhappy  associate. \"He was disposed to be severe, and must have put you, in  some measure, out of conceit with your favourite rifle, Valletort.\"    \"True,\" rejoined the Baronet, who had already rallied from the  momentary depression of his spirits, \"he hit me devilish hard, I  confess, and was disposed to display more of the commanding officer  than quite suits my ideas of the service. His words were as caustic as  his looks; and could both have pierced me to the quick, there was no  inclination on his part wanting. By my soul I could .... but I forgive  him. He is the father of my friend: and for that reason will I chew the  cud of my mortification, nor suffer, if possible, a sense of his  unkindness to rankle at my heart. At all events, Blessington, my mind  is made up, and resign or exchange I certainly shall the instant I can  find a decent loop-hole to creep out of.\"    Sir Everard fancied the ear of his captain was alone listening to these  expressions of his feeling, or in all probability he would not have  uttered them. As he concluded the last sentence, however, he felt his  arm gently grasped by one who walked a pace or two silently in their  rear. He turned, and recognised Charles de Haldimar.    \"I am sure, Valletort, you will believe how much pained I have been at  the severity of my father; but, indeed, there was nothing personally  offensive intended. Blessington can tell you as well as myself it is  his manner altogether. Nay, that although he is the first in seniority  after Blackwater, the governor treats him with the same distance and  hauteur he would use towards the youngest ensign in the service. Such  are the effects of his long military habits, and his ideas of the  absolutism of command. Am I not right, Blessington?\"    \"Quite right, Charles. Sir Everard may satisfy himself his is no  solitary instance of the stern severity of your father. Still, I  confess, notwithstanding the rigidity of manner which he seems, on all  occasions, to think so indispensable to the maintenance of authority in  a commanding officer, I never knew him so inclined to find fault as he  is to-night.\"    \"Perhaps,\" observed Valletort, good humouredly, \"his conscience is  rather restless; and he is willing to get rid of it and his spleen  together. I would wager my rifle against the worthless scalp of the  rascal I fired at to-night, that this same stranger, whose asserted  appearance has called us from our comfortable beds, is but the creation  of his disturbed dreams. Indeed, how is it possible any thing formed of  flesh and blood could have"]]]
