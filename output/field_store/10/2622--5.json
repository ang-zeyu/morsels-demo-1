The resolution was passed without dissent, and thus the appeal to  Congress for redress of the outrages committed against the Saints by  Missouri ended.    At a conference of The Church held in April following, a number of  resolutions were adopted, regretting and condemning the action of the  Senate judiciary committee, and approving the course pursued by their  delegation to Congress, Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon and Elias Higbee,  and requesting them to continue their exertions to obtain redress for  a suffering people as opportunities became more favorable for such  efforts, and if at last all hopes of obtaining satisfaction for the  injuries done us be entirely blasted, that they then \"appeal our case  to the Court of Heaven, believing that the Great Jehovah, who rules  over the destiny of nations, and who notices the falling sparrows,  will undoubtedly redress our wrongs, and ere long avenge us of our  adversaries.\"    Footnotes    1. Letter to Hyrum Smith, Dec. 5, 1839.        CHAPTER X.    ORSON HYDE'S MISSION TO JERUSALEM.    THOSE who have read \"The Missouri Persecutions,\" will remember the  disaffection of Orson Hyde at Far West, and the statements he made  in connection with Thomas B. Marsh against The Church, in the autumn  of 1838--that time when men's hearts were failing them for fear, and  death and destruction were rife; when even strong hearts grew faint  and brave cheeks were blanched. Well, as stated in the account of his  disaffection, like Peter of old, this modern Apostle wept bitterly  for his error, returned to The Church, was forgiven; and during the  conference held at Commerce in April, 1840, he was called to go on a  mission to Jerusalem.    It appears that Elder Hyde in a heavenly vision saw himself on the  Mount of Olives blessing the land for the return of the people of  Judah, hence, that he might be obedient to the vision, he was appointed  to go to that land for the purpose mentioned. In the letter of  appointment, which the Prophet gave him, occurs the following passage:        The Jewish nation have been scattered abroad among the Gentiles for      a long period; and in our estimation the time of the commencement      of their return to the Holy Land has already arrived. * * * It      is highly important, in our opinion, that the present views and      movements of the Jewish people be sought after, and laid before the      American people for their consideration, their profit and their      learning.    On the 15th of the same month that Elder Hyde was called, he left his  family at Nauvoo and started for Jerusalem without purse or scrip. The  next day he met with John E. Page, who subsequently to the conference  at which Orson Hyde had been called, was appointed to go with him to  the Holy Land.    They traveled through several States together, preaching as they went.  In the city of Cincinnati they succeeded in raising up a large and  prosperous branch of The Church; and while Elder Page remained in  Cincinnati to strengthen the Saints, Elder Hyde made his way to New  York.    These labors consumed the summer of 1840, and in January, 1841, the  word of the Lord came to the Prophet Joseph saying that he was not  well pleased with the long delays of his servants in starting on  their mission to Jerusalem, and they were requested to hasten their  departure. In the meantime, however, Elder Page had lost the spirit of  his appointment and had no disposition to go, but Orson Hyde on the  receipt of this reproof set sail at once from New York for England.    It is not our design to follow him through all his meanderings in  Europe, or relate his trials or his perils in crossing the mighty seas,  and passing through states in which war was raging. He succeeded in  reaching the Holy City some time in October, and on the twenty-fourth  of that month, 1841, early in the morning, was seated on the Mount of  Olives, as he had seen himself in vision; and wrote the prayer he had  to offer in behalf of the Jews and their city, which had been for so  long a time trodden down of the Gentiles.    In that prayer he referred to the prophecies of God's servants in  relation to the Jews and Jerusalem, and asked that all might be  fulfilled. He called for the richest blessings of heaven upon the  Jews; he blessed, by virtue of his Priesthood, the city, the land, and  all the elements, to the end that Judah might be gathered, Jerusalem  rebuilt, and become an holy city, that the Lord's name might be  glorified in all the earth. At the conclusion of his prayer, he says:        On the top of the Mount of Olives, I erected a pile of stones, as a      witness according to ancient custom. On what was anciently called      Mount Zion, where the temple stood, I erected another, and used the      rod according to the prediction upon my head.    Just what he meant by saying that he had used the rod \"according to  prediction on his head,\" I have been unable to learn, except that it  was a rod with which he had measured the city.    I have called the attention of my readers to this mission of Elder  Hyde's to Jerusalem, because it doubtless has a greater significance  than most people would be inclined to give it. The rebuilding of  Jerusalem is regarded by Mormonism as of as much importance as the  establishment of Zion; the gathering of the dispersed of Judah is as  much a part of the great latter-day work as the reassembling of the  other tribes of Israel; and the commencement of that work was made by  Elder Hyde, when by the authority of his apostleship, he consecrated  that land to the return of the house of Judah, to inhabit it, and  rebuild their city according to the predictions of their prophets. It  may be somewhat beyond the scope of this chapter to call attention  to it, but surely it will be of interest to the reader to know that  this apostolic mission and blessing upon the Holy Land has not been  fruitless, but blessings as a result are flowing unto it, and the Jews  are beginning to return to it. At the time of Apostle Hyde's visit  and ceremonies on the Mount of Olives, but very few Jews were in the  city or in Judea. As late as twenty years ago the consular reports  show that there were not more than fifteen or twenty thousand Jews in  all Jerusalem. But in a popular magazine for August, 1896, under the  editorial caption--\"The Plan for a Hebrew Nation\"--the magazine said:        A movement of which Americans hear very little, but which may have      an important effect upon the history of the coming century, is      going forward upon the shores of the Mediterranean. This is the      return of the Jews to their ancient home in Palestine--the Zionite      movement it is called. For hundreds of years there has been talk of      the Jew returning to Jerusalem. Through all his years of oppression      and wandering, this vision of his native land has been held before      his eyes by certain of his teachers. But it is only in the last      twelve years, since the renewal of persecution in Russia, that      the idea has taken shape. There are now more than four thousand      colonists in Palestine. At Jaffa the schools are Hebrew, the      ancient language being spoken altogether, and a Hebrew literature      is being developed. The works of the great English, French and      German authors are being translated, and writers of their own race      are being encouraged.        The Zionite movement is backed by the influence of the Rothschilds      and other great Jewish families and societies, and as we see its      stirring in every country, we can believe it only requires a      great popular leader to make it one of the important movements in      history. That it is not purely religious, but racial, is proven      by the co-operation of Rabinowitz, the Christian Jew who became      so well known here during the World's Fair Congress. There is      already one Jewish Christian colony in Palestine. * * * As a Jewish      state, Palestine might well become a country that would claim      consideration among the family of nations. If the Zionite continues      to grow, such a result is almost assured.    During the same month, namely, in its impression of August 11th, 1896,  the St. Louis _Globe-Democrat_ published the following:        Only two decades ago there were not more than fifteen or twenty      thousand Jews in Jerusalem. At that [time] no houses were to be      found outside the walls of the city. Since then many changes have      taken place and the Hebrew population--mainly on account of the      increase of the Jewish immigration from Russia--now stands at      between sixty and seventy thousand. Whole streets of houses have      been built outside the walls on the site of the ancient suburban      districts, which for hundreds of years have remained deserted. It      is not, however, only in Jerusalem itself that the Jews abound,      but throughout Palestine they are buying farms and establishing      themselves in a surprisingly rapid manner. In Jerusalem they form      at present a larger community than either the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50357"],[0,"Origin of the 'Reorganized' Church and the Question of Succession (#10)"],[1,"in August 1842,  and moreover, it was but carrying out the design of the Prophet Joseph  Smith. When men accuse the Saints of fleeing to the west desiring to  get beyond the borders of the United States, and of being disloyal to  the American government, they not only place themselves at variance  with the facts of history, but utter a miserable falsehood that merits  only the severest contempt. In B. H. Roberts' \"Succession,\" pages 109  to 126, a complete array of evidence regarding the exodus as outlined  by Joseph Smith may be found.    2. In several of the revelations given to the Church in the beginning,  the doctrine of common consent is made mandatory. In the revelation of  April 6, 1830, the date of the organization of the Church--the Lord  says: \"The elders are to receive their licenses from other elders,  by vote of the Church (branch) to which they belong, or from the  conferences.\" * * * * * No person is to be ordained to any office in  this Church, where there is a regularly organized branch of the same,  without the vote of that Church.\" In section 26, verse 2: \"All things  shall be done by common consent in the Church, by much prayer and  faith, for all things ye shall receive by faith.\" See also Sec. 124:144.    The Saints by vote accepted the Twelve Apostles as the presiding  quorum of the Church at this special conference August 8, and again  at the regular conference in October. This fact settled the matter of  succession according to the revelations. These authorities and their  successors, have been sustained at each conference of the Church, twice  a year, and at the quarterly conferences of the various stakes four  times a year from that day to this. The question of succession was,  therefore, settled at Nauvoo when the assembled Saints voted to sustain  the Apostles as the presiding quorum of the Church. The attempt of any  party or parties, before any other body, to set up the Church and to  ordain officers in conflict with the action of the Church on the dates  previously mentioned, would be illegally done; just as much so as if in  the municipality, state or nation, after the majority of the citizens  had elected officers (and that almost unanimously) to serve them, a few  disgruntled, defeated, candidates and their sympathizers should appoint  another election, hold it by themselves and then declare that the  regularly and properly elected officers were rejected and unauthorized  to serve. Such a thing in the nation could be no more foolish or absurd  than were the attempts of apostates to set up a _new organization_  of the Church from a handful of disgruntled office-seekers and their  sympathizers. In one case there would be as much authority as in the  other and no more.    But the contention of Reorganites has been, that the apostles assumed  authority and powers that did not belong to them. That their duty was  in the world and it was the prerogative of the high council of Nauvoo  with William Marks and counselors, at their head, to direct the affairs  of the Church. They say:    \"That the Twelve usurped authority, and assumed privileges and duties  after the death of Joseph and Hyrum which did not belong to them, is  seen in the fact that their mission and calling was to travel abroad  among the branches, and throughout the world, preaching, organizing  branches, thus building up the Church outside of Zion and the organized  stakes. That such was their mission and calling may be seen in the law  of the Church which is further confirmed in the teachings of the martyr  as follows:    \"'The Twelve _will have no right_ to go into Zion, or any of its  stakes, and there undertake to regulate the affairs thereof, where  there is a standing high council. But it is _their duty to go abroad_  and regulate all matters relative to the different branches of the  Church.' Joseph Smith's History, Mill. Star, Vol. 15, p. 261.    \"After the death of Joseph, the Twelve superseded, by their arrogant,  despotic acts, the standing high council at the stake of Nauvoo,  of both which the late President Wm. Marks was president. And this  usurpation thus begun, has been perpetuated till now; entailing  darkness, discord, and misrule upon that faction of the Church.\" (The  Successor pp. 14, 15).    Alexander H. Smith, presiding patriarch of the \"Reorganized\" church,  and then one of their \"apostles,\" made the following statement, March  29, 1885, in Salt Lake City:    \"At the evening meeting his remarks were directed to the subject of  the reorganization of the church, in which he showed why this measure  became necessary, and how Brigham Young and the Twelve Apostles usurped  the leadership. He quoted from declarations of Joseph Smith and Brigham  Young, and the revelations to show what the organization and order of  the priesthood were, and how, in case of death of the prophet, the  word of the Lord, was to be given to the Saints. It was to be through  the high council of the chief or center stake of Zion, in which  jurisdiction the Twelve Apostles had no business whatever. Their work  and powers extended only to matters beyond the borders of Zion. When  the prophet was killed, therefore, the right and duty to rule fell upon  the high council at Nauvoo, of which Elder Marks was the president. But  Brigham Young and eight others of the Twelve, brushed this order of the  priesthood to one side, and seized the reins of government themselves.\"  (Saints' Herald, Vol. 32:342).    This argument set forth in the \"Successor\" and by Alexander H. Smith,  which has been quite universal in the \"Reorganized\" Church, would  not be quite so bad if it was not for a number of insurmountable  difficulties and objections that stand in the way. In the first place  the objectors fail to state that the powers of the high council and  stake presidency at Nauvoo, were limited to the affairs of the stake,  and outside of that they held no jurisdiction. Following the martyrdom,  the Church was considering matters that affected the whole Church  and not merely the stake at Nauvoo. The Twelve Apostles, therefore,  assumed by legal right their proper place as the presiding quorum of  the Church, and were so sustained. The revelation on Priesthood (sec.  107) says the Twelve Apostles, form a quorum equal in authority with  the First Presidency (verse 24) and it was the duty of the Apostles,  not only to ordain evangelical ministers (Patriarchs) but also to  ordain and set in order all the other officers of the Church, (verse  58). We read that \"God hath set some in the Church, _first_ apostles,  secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers,\" etc. (I. Cor. 12:28) not  _first_ high councils and presidents of Stakes. Neither are the duties  of the Apostles confined to their labors out side of the Stakes of Zion.    3. If Jason W. Briggs joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints June 6, 1841, and resided in Wisconsin from that time till 1854,  he cannot be considered a faithful member of the Church, \"who desired  to do the will of heaven;\" for in remaining at Beloit during all these  years he was going contrary to the word of the Lord given to the  Prophet in 1841. On January 15th of that year, the Lord said through  the Presidency, Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon and Hyrum Smith, and on  divers other occasions, that the Saints scattered abroad should come  to Nauvoo and Hancock county. Here is the command: \"Let all those who  _appreciate the blessings of the Gospel_, and realize the importance  of _obeying the commandments of heaven_ * * * first prepare for the  general gathering. _Let them dispose of their effects as fast as  circumstances will possibly admit_, without making too great sacrifice,  and _remove to our city and county_. * * * _This cannot be too forcibly  impressed_ on the _minds of all_, and the elders are hereby instructed  to proclaim this word in all places where the Saints reside in their  public ministrations, _for this is according to the instructions we  have received from the Lord_. (My italics.)    Again, on May 24, 1841, the Prophet said this gathering to Hancock and  Lee counties was \"important and should be attended to _by all who feel  an interest in the prosperity of this corner stone of Zion_,\" and the  Twelve Apostles a short time later, under the direction of the First  Presidency, in an epistle to the Saints, said: \"We say to _all Saints  who desire to do the will of heaven_, arise, and tarry not, but come  up hither to the place of gathering _as speedily as possible_.\" (My  italics.)    Mr. Briggs visited Nauvoo once in 1843, but again returned to Wisconsin  (Reorg. Hist. 3:737) where he lived until 1854, either defying this  commandment or else ignoring it, thus proving he was not in harmony  with the Presidency of the Church, and was one who did not \"desire to  do the will of heaven.\" If he had been faithful he would have gone  to Nauvoo and remained there and assisted in the building of the  Temple, but he did not do so, _was not diligent_ and went contrary to  the \"instructions\" the Presidency had \"received from the Lord.\" That  the Lord would not choose such an unfaithful servant to build up His  Church, give him revelations and cause him to stand as president pro  tem., in the place of the Seed of Joseph Smith, which Reorganites claim  Jason W. Briggs did, is obvious and requires no further comment.    4. I have been taken to task for saying that about this time Jason  W. Briggs organized the Beloit branch for the Strang organization.  Reorganites claim that the Beloit branch was raised up in 1842 or  1843--they don't know just when. For the sake of the argument we will  grant that a branch was organized at Beloit in 1842 or 1843. If so,  the faithful members of that branch removed to Nauvoo, agreeable to  the commandment of the Lord previously quoted. Those who remained  at Beloit, like Jason W. Briggs, were not faithful in that they did  not \"desire to do the will of heaven.\""]]]
