When he did speak it  was to ask: \"Grant, how many wolves do you think there are in that  pack?\" Knowing where he was from, and suspecting that he thought I would  over-estimate the number, I determined to show my acquaintance with the  animal by putting the estimate below what possibly could be correct, and  answered:  \"Oh, about twenty,\" very indifferently.  He smiled and rode  on.  In a minute we were close upon them, and before they saw us.  There  were just TWO of them.  Seated upon their haunches, with their mouths  close together, they had made all the noise we had been hearing for the  past ten minutes.  I have often thought of this incident since when I  have heard the noise of a few disappointed politicians who had deserted  their associates.  There are always more of them before they are  counted.    A week or two before leaving Corpus Christi on this trip, I had been  promoted from brevet second-lieutenant, 4th infantry, to full  second-lieutenant, 7th infantry.  Frank Gardner,(*1) of the 7th, was  promoted to the 4th in the same orders.  We immediately made application  to be transferred, so as to get back to our old regiments.  On my  return, I found that our application had been approved at Washington.  While in the 7th infantry I was in the company of Captain Holmes,  afterwards a Lieutenant-general in the Confederate army. I never came in  contact with him in the war of the Rebellion, nor did he render any very  conspicuous service in his high rank.  My transfer carried me to the  company of Captain McCall, who resigned from the army after the Mexican  war and settled in Philadelphia.  He was prompt, however, to volunteer  when the rebellion broke out, and soon rose to the rank of major-general  in the Union army.  I was not fortunate enough to meet him after he  resigned. In the old army he was esteemed very highly as a soldier and  gentleman. Our relations were always most pleasant.    The preparations at Corpus Christi for an advance progressed as rapidly  in the absence of some twenty or more lieutenants as if we had been  there.  The principal business consisted in securing mules, and getting  them broken to harness.  The process was slow but amusing.  The animals  sold to the government were all young and unbroken, even to the saddle,  and were quite as wild as the wild horses of the prairie.  Usually a  number would be brought in by a company of Mexicans, partners in the  delivery.  The mules were first driven into a stockade, called a corral,  inclosing an acre or more of ground.  The Mexicans,--who were all  experienced in throwing the lasso,--would go into the corral on  horseback, with their lassos attached to the pommels of their saddles.  Soldiers detailed as teamsters and black smiths would also enter the  corral, the former with ropes to serve as halters, the latter with  branding irons and a fire to keep the irons heated.  A lasso was then  thrown over the neck of a mule, when he would immediately go to the  length of his tether, first one end, then the other in the air.  While  he was thus plunging and gyrating, another lasso would be thrown by  another Mexican, catching the animal by a fore-foot.  This would bring  the mule to the ground, when he was seized and held by the teamsters  while the blacksmith put upon him, with hot irons, the initials \"U. S.\"  Ropes were then put about the neck, with a slipnoose which would tighten  around the throat if pulled.  With a man on each side holding these  ropes, the mule was released from his other bindings and allowed to  rise.  With more or less difficulty he would be conducted to a picket  rope outside and fastened there.  The delivery of that mule was then  complete. This process was gone through with every mule and wild horse  with the army of occupation.    The method of breaking them was less cruel and much more amusing.  It is  a well-known fact that where domestic animals are used for specific  purposes from generation to generation, the descendants are easily, as a  rule, subdued to the same uses.  At that time in Northern Mexico the  mule, or his ancestors, the horse and the ass, was seldom used except  for the saddle or pack.  At all events the Corpus Christi mule resisted  the new use to which he was being put.  The treatment he was subjected  to in order to overcome his prejudices was summary and effective.    The soldiers were principally foreigners who had enlisted in our large  cities, and, with the exception of a chance drayman among them, it is  not probable that any of the men who reported themselves as competent  teamsters had ever driven a mule-team in their lives, or indeed that  many had had any previous experience in driving any animal whatever to  harness.  Numbers together can accomplish what twice their number acting  individually could not perform.  Five mules were allotted to each wagon.  A teamster would select at the picket rope five animals of nearly the  same color and general appearance for his team.  With a full corps of  assistants, other teamsters, he would then proceed to get his mules  together.  In two's the men would approach each animal selected,  avoiding as far as possible its heels.  Two ropes would be put about the  neck of each animal, with a slip noose, so that he could be choked if  too unruly.  They were then led out, harnessed by force and hitched to  the wagon in the position they had to keep ever after.  Two men remained  on either side of the leader, with the lassos about its neck, and one  man retained the same restraining influence over each of the others.  All being ready, the hold would be slackened and the team started. The  first motion was generally five mules in the air at one time, backs  bowed, hind feet extended to the rear.  After repeating this movement a  few times the leaders would start to run.  This would bring the  breeching tight against the mules at the wheels, which these last seemed  to regard as a most unwarrantable attempt at coercion and would resist  by taking a seat, sometimes going so far as to lie down.  In time all  were broken in to do their duty submissively if not cheerfully, but  there never was a time during the war when it was safe to let a Mexican  mule get entirely loose.  Their drivers were all teamsters by the time  they got through.    I recollect one case of a mule that had worked in a team under the  saddle, not only for some time at Corpus Christi, where he was broken,  but all the way to the point opposite Matamoras, then to Camargo, where  he got loose from his fastenings during the night.  He did not run away  at first, but staid in the neighborhood for a day or two, coming up  sometimes to the feed trough even; but on the approach of the teamster  he always got out of the way.  At last, growing tired of the constant  effort to catch him, he disappeared altogether.  Nothing short of a  Mexican with his lasso could have caught him.  Regulations would not  have warranted the expenditure of a dollar in hiring a man with a lasso  to catch that mule; but they did allow the expenditure \"of the mule,\" on  a certificate that he had run away without any fault of the  quartermaster on whose returns he was borne, and also the purchase of  another to take his place.  I am a competent witness, for I was  regimental quartermaster at the time.    While at Corpus Christi all the officers who had a fancy for riding kept  horses.  The animals cost but little in the first instance, and when  picketed they would get their living without any cost.  I had three not  long before the army moved, but a sad accident bereft me of them all at  one time.  A colored boy who gave them all the attention they got  --besides looking after my tent and that of a class-mate and  fellow-lieutenant and cooking for us, all for about eight dollars per  month, was riding one to water and leading the other two.  The led  horses pulled him from his seat and all three ran away.  They never were  heard of afterwards.  Shortly after that some one told Captain Bliss,  General Taylor's Adjutant-General, of my misfortune.  \"Yes; I heard  Grant lost five or six dollars' worth of horses the other day,\" he  replied.  That was a slander; they were broken to the saddle when I got  them and cost nearly twenty dollars.  I never suspected the colored boy  of malicious intent in letting them get away, because, if they had not  escaped, he could have had one of them to ride on the long march then in  prospect.        CHAPTER VI.    ADVANCE OF THE ARMY--CROSSING THE COLORADO--THE RIO GRANDE.    At last the preparations were complete and orders were issued for the  advance to begin on the 8th of March.  General Taylor had an army of not  more than three thousand men.  One battery, the siege guns and all the  convalescent troops were sent on by water to Brazos Santiago, at the  mouth of the Rio Grande.  A guard was left back at Corpus Christi to  look after public property and to take care of those who were too sick  to be removed.  The remainder of the army, probably not more than twenty  five hundred men, was divided into three brigades, with the cavalry  independent.  Colonel Twiggs, with seven companies of dragoons and a  battery of light artillery, moved on the 8th.  He was followed by the  three infantry brigades, with a day's interval between the commands.  Thus the rear brigade did not move from Corpus Christi until the 11th of  March.  In view of the immense bodies of men moved on the same day over  narrow roads, through dense forests and across large streams, in our  late war, it seems strange now that a body of less than three thousand  men should have been broken into four columns, separated by a day's  march.    General Taylor was opposed to anything like plundering by the troops,  and in this instance, I doubt not, he looked upon the enemy as the  aggrieved party and was not willing to injure them further than his  instructions from Washington demanded.
