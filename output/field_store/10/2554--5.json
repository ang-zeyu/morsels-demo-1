(_The stage gradually becomes lighter, whilst the light of the magic  head diminishes. The Witch, contentedly to Gretel, who still stands  there motionless._)        Now Gretel, be obedient and wise,      while Haensel's growing fat and nice.      We'll feed him up, you'll see my reason,      and with sweet almonds and raisins season.      I'll go indoors, the things to prepare,      and you remain here where you are!    (_She grins as she holds up her finger warningly, and goes into the  house._)    GRETEL (_stiff and motionless_).        O, what a horrid witch she is!    HAeNSEL (_whispering hastily_).        Gretel, sh! don't speak so loud!      Be very sharp, watch well and see      whatever she may do to me!      Pretend to do all she commands--      O, there she's coming back, sh! hush!    (_The Witch comes out, satisfies herself that Gretel is still standing  motionless, and then spreads before Haensel almonds and raisins from a  basket._)    THE WITCH.        Now, little man,      come prithee enjoy yourself!    (_Sticking a raisin into Haensel's mouth._)        Eat, minion, eat or die!      Here are cakes, O so nice!      (_Turns to Gretel and disenchants her with a juniper-branch._)      Hocus pocus, elder-bush!      Rigid body loosen, hush!      (_Gretel moves again._)      Now up and move again, bright and blithesome,      limbs are become again supple and lithesome.      Go, my poppet, go my pet,      you the table now shall set,      little knife, little fork, little dish, little plate,      little serviette for my little mate!      Now get everything ready and nice,      or else I shall lock you up too in a trice!    (_She threatens and titters. Gretel hurries off. The Witch, to Haensel,  who pretends to be asleep._)        The fool is slumb'ring, it does seem queer      how youth can sleep and have no fear!      Well, sleep away, you simple sheep,      soon you will sleep your last long sleep!      But first with Gretel I'll begin--      off you, dear maiden, I will dine;      you are so tender, plump, and good,      just the thing for witches' food!    (_She opens the oven door and sniffs in it, her face lighted up by the  deep red glare of the fire._)        The dough has risen, so we'll go on preparing.      Hark, how the sticks in the fire are crackling!    (_She pushes a couple more faggots under, the fire flames up and then  dies down again. The Witch rubbing her hands with glee._)        Yes, Gretel mine,      how well off you I'll dine!      See, see, O how sly!      When in the oven she's peeping,      quickly behind her I'm creeping!      One little push, bang      goes the door, clang!      Then soon will Gretel be      just done to a T!      and when from the oven I take her      she'll look like a cake from the baker,      by magic fire red      changed into gingerbread!      See, see how sly!      Hi hi! hi hi!    (_In her wild delight she seizes a broomstick and begins to ride upon  it._)              So hop, hop, hop,            gallop, lop, lop!            My broomstick nag,            come do not lag!    (_She rides excitedly round on the broomstick._)              At dawn of day            I ride away,            am here and there            and everywhere!    (_She rides again; Gretel meanwhile is watching at the window._)        At midnight hour, when none can know,      to join the witches' dance I go!            And three and four            are witches' lore,            and five and six            are witches' tricks,            and nine is one,            and ten is none,            and seven is nil,            or what she will!      And thus they ride till dawn of day!    (_Hopping madly along, she rides to the back of the stage and vanishes  for a time behind the cottage. Here the Witch becomes visible again; she  comes to the foreground, where she suddenly pulls up and dismounts._)        Prr, broomstick, hi!    (_She hobbles back to the stable and tickles Haensel with a birch twig  till he awakes._)        Up, awake, my mankin young;      come show to me your tongue!    (_Haensel puts his tongue out. The Witch smacks with her tongue._)        Dainty morsel! dainty morsel!      Little toothsome mankin come,      now let me see your thumb!    (_Haensel pokes out a small bone._)        Gemini! Oho!      O how scraggy, how lean!      Urchin, you're a scraggy one,      as bad as a skeleton!    (_Calls._)        Maiden, Gretel!    (_Gretel appears at the door._)        Bring some raisins and almonds sweet,      Haensel wants some more to eat.    (_Gretel runs into the house, and returns immediately with a basket full  of almonds and raisins._)    GRETEL.        Here are the almonds.    (_Whilst the Witch is feeding Haensel, Gretel gets behind her and makes  the gestures of disenchantment with the juniper-branch._)    GRETEL (_softly_).        Hocus pocus, elder-bush,      Rigid body loosen, hush!    THE WITCH (_turning suddenly round_).        What were you saying, little goose?    GRETEL (_confusedly_).        Only--much good may it do to Hans!    THE WITCH.        Eh?    GRETEL (_louder_).        Much good may it do to Hans!    THE WITCH.        He he he, my little miss,      I'll stop your mouth with this!    (_Sticks a raisin into Gretel's mouth._)        Eat, minion, eat or die!      Here are cakes, O so nice!    (_She opens the oven door; the heat has apparently diminished. Meanwhile  Haensel makes violent signs to Gretel._)    HAeNSEL    (_softly opening the stable door_).        Sister dear,      O beware!    THE WITCH (_looking greedily at Gretel_).        She makes my mouth water,      this pretty little daughter!            Come, Gretel mine,            sugar-maiden mine!    (_Gretel comes towards her._)        Peep in the oven, be steady,      see if the gingerbread's ready!            Carefully look, pet,            whether it's cooked yet,            but if it wants more,            shut quick the door!    (_Gretel hesitates._)    HAeNSEL    (_slipping out of the stable)_.        Sister dear,      have a care!    GRETEL    (_making herself out very awkward_).        I don't understand what I have to do!    THE WITCH.        Just stand on tip-toe,      head bending forward;      try it, I pray,      it's merely play!    HAeNSEL    (_pulling Gretel back by her frock_).        Sister dear,      now take care!    GRETEL (_shyly_).        I'm such a goose, don't understand!      You'll have to show me      how to stand on tip-toe!    THE WITCH    (_makes a movement of impatience_).        Do as I say,      it's merely play!    (_She begins creeping up to the oven, muttering all the time, and just  as she is bending over it, Haensel and Gretel give her a good push,  which sends her toppling over into it, upon which they quickly shut the  door._)    HAeNSEL AND GRETEL (_mocking her_).        Then \"One little push, bang      goes the door, clang!\"      You, not Gretel, then will be      just done to a T!    (_Haensel and Gretel fall into one another's arms._)    BOTH.        Hurrah! now sing the witch is dead,                really dead!      No more to dread!        Hurrah! now sing the witch is still,                deathly still!      We can eat our fill!        Now all the spell is o'er,                really o'er!      We fear no more!    (_They seize each other's hands._)            Yes, let us happy be,          dancing so merrily;          now the old witch is gone,          we'll have no end of fun!          Hey! hurrah, hurrah!          Hip hurrah! Hip hurrah!                Hurrah!    (_They take each other round the waist and waltz together, first in the  front of the stage, and then gradually in the direction of the Witch's  house. When they get there Haensel breaks loose from Gretel and rushes  into the house, shutting the door after him. Then from the upper window  he throws down apples, pears, oranges, gilded nuts, and all kinds of  sweetmeats into Gretel's outstretched apron. Meanwhile the oven begins  crackling loudly, and the flames burn high. Then there is a loud crash,  and the oven falls thundering into bits. Haensel and Gretel, who in  their terror let their sweetmeats all fall down, hurry towards the oven  startled, and stand there motionless. Their astonishment increases when  they become aware of a troop of children around them, whose disguise of  cakes has fallen from them._)    HAeNSEL AND GRETEL (_spoken_).        There, see those little children dear,      I wonder how they all came here!      Scene IV.    THE GINGERBREAD CHILDREN    (_motionless and with closed eyes, as the cake figures were before_).            We're saved, we're freed          for evermore!    GRETEL.        Your eyes are shut--pray who are you?      You're sleeping, and yet you're singing too!    THE GINGERBREAD CHILDREN    (_always very softly_).        O touch us, we pray,      that we may all awake!    HAeNSEL (_to Gretel, embarrassed_).        O touch them for me,      I dare not try!    GRETEL.        Yes, let me stroke this innocent face!    (_She caresses the nearest child, who opens its eyes and smiles._)    OTHER GINGERBREAD CHILDREN    (_softly_).        O touch me too, O touch me too,      that I also may awake!    (_Gretel goes and caresses all the rest of the children, who open  their eyes and smile, without moving; meanwhile Haensel seizes the  juniper-branch._)    HAeNSEL.        Hocus pocus, elder-bush!      Rigid body loosen, hush!    SOME OF THE CHILDREN    (_jump up and hurry towards Haensel and Gretel from all sides_).        We thank, we thank you both!    THE CHILDREN.        The spell is broke and we are free,      we'll sing and we'll dance and we'll shout for glee!      Come, children all, and form a ring,      join hands together while we sing.      Then sing and spring,      then dance and sing,      for cakes and all good things we bring.

It is evident that  Mr. Oxley had this impression on his mind, when he turned towards the  coast; but the wet state of the lowlands prevented him from ascertaining  its correctness or error. Doubt, consequently, still existed as to the  nature of the country he had left behind him; a question in which the best  interests of the colony were apparently involved. Subsequently to these  discoveries, Mr. Surveyor Mechan, accompanied by Mr. Hamilton Hume, a  colonist of considerable experience, explored the country more to the  southward and westward of Sydney, and discovered most of the new country  called Argyle, and also Lake Bathurst.    Mr. Hume was afterwards associated with a Mr. Hovel, in an excursion to  the south coast, under the auspices of Sir Thomas Brisbane. After a most  persevering and laborious journey, they reached the sea; but it is  uncertain whether they made Port Philips, or Western Port. Mr. Hume, whose  practical experience will yield to that of no man, entertains a conviction  that it was to the former they descended from the neighbouring ranges; but  Mr. Hovel, I believe supports a contrary opinion. In the early stage of  their journey, they passed over York or Yass Plains; and, after crossing  the Morumbidgee, were generally entangled among mountain ranges that  increased in height to the east and south-east. They crossed three  considerable rivers, falling westerly, which they named the Goulburn, the  Hume, and the Ovens; and found a beautiful and well-watered country in the  vicinity of the coast.    In 1826, Mr. Allan Cunningham, Botanical Collector to his late Majesty,  traversed a considerable portion of the interior to the north of Bathurst,  and, with a laudable zeal, devoted his labours to the acquisition of  general information, as well as to his more immediate professional  pursuits. In 1827, this gentleman again bent his steps towards the  northward, and succeeded in gaining the 28th parallel of latitude; and,  on a subsequent occasion, having taken his departure from Moreton Bay, he  connected his former journey with that settlement, and thus contributed  largely to our knowledge of the mountain country between it and the  capital. Mr. Cunningham, who, independently of his individual excursions,  had not only circumnavigated the Australian Continent with Capt. King,  but had formed also one of the party with Mr. Oxley, in the journeys  before noticed, had adopted this gentleman's opinion with regard to the  swampy and inhospitable character of the distant interior. Its depressed  appearance from the high ground on which Mr. Cunningham subsequently  moved, tended to confirm this opinion, which was moreover daily gaining  strength from the reports of the natives, who became more frequent in  their intercourse with the whites, and who reported that there were large  waters to the westward, on which the natives had canoes, and in which  there were fish of great size.    It became, therefore, a current opinion, that the western interior of New  Holland comprehended an extensive basin, of which the ocean of reeds which  had proved so formidable to Mr. Oxley, formed most probably the outskirts;  and it was generally thought that an expedition proceeding into the  interior, would encounter marshes of vast extent, which would be extremely  difficult to turn, and no less dangerous to enter.    It remained to be proved, however, whether these conjectures were founded  in fact. The chief difficulty lay in the character of the country, and in  providing the necessary means to ensure success. Those which were resorted  to will be found in the succeeding chapter. Whether they would have been  found sufficient and applicable had the interior been wholly under water,  is doubtful; and my impression on this point induced me to make more  efficient arrangements on the second expedition.            EXPEDITION DOWN THE BANKS OF THE MACQUARIE RIVER IN 1828 AND 1829.          CHAPTER I.        State of the Colony in 1828-29--Objects of the Expedition--Departure  from Sydney--Wellington Valley--Progress down the Macquarie--Arrival at  Mount Harris--Stopped by the marshes--Encamp amidst reeds--Excursions down  the river--Its termination--Appearance of the marshes--Opthalmic  affection of the men--Mr. Hume's successful journey to the northward--  Journey across the plain--Second great marsh--Perplexities--Situation of  the exploring party--Consequent resolutions.      The year 1826 was remarkable for the commencement of one of those fearful  droughts to which we have reason to believe the climate of New South Wales  is periodically subject. It continued during the two following years with  unabated severity. The surface of the earth became so parched up that  minor vegetation ceased upon it. Culinary herbs were raised with  difficulty, and crops failed even in the most favourable situations.  Settlers drove their flocks and herds to distant tracts for pasture and  water, neither remaining for them in the located districts. The interior  suffered equally with the coast, and men, at length, began to despond  under so alarming a visitation. It almost appeared as if the Australian  sky were never again to be traversed by a cloud.    OBJECTS OF THE EXPEDITION.    But, however severe for the colony the seasons had proved, or were likely  to prove, it was borne in mind at this critical moment, that the wet and  swampy state of the interior had alone prevented Mr. Oxley from  penetrating further into it, in 1818. Each successive report from  Wellington Valley, the most distant settlement to the N. W., confirmed the  news of the unusually dry state of the lowlands, and of the exhausted  appearance of the streams falling into them. It was, consequently, hoped  that an expedition, pursuing the line of the Macquarie, would have a  greater chance of success than the late Surveyor General had; and that the  difficulties he had to contend against would be found to be greatly  diminished, if not altogether removed. The immediate fitting out of an  expedition was therefore decided upon, for the express purpose of  ascertaining the nature and extent of that basin into which the Macquarie  was supposed to fall, and whether any connection existed between it and  the streams falling westerly. As I had early taken a great interest in the  geography of New South Wales, the Governor was pleased to appoint me to  the command of this expedition.    JOURNEY FROM SYDNEY TO EMU PLAINS.    In the month of September, 1828, I received his Excellency's commands to  prepare for my journey; and by the commencement of November, had organized  my party, and completed the necessary arrangements. On the 9th of that  month, I waited on the Governor, at Parramatta, to receive his definitive  instructions. As the establishments at Sydney had been unable to supply me  with the necessary number of horses and oxen, instructions had been  forwarded to Mr. Maxwell, the superintendent of Wellington Valley, to  train a certain number for my use; and I was now directed to push for that  settlement without loss of time. I returned to Sydney in the afternoon of  the 9th, and on the 10th took leave of my brother officers, to commence a  journey of very dubious issue; and, in company with my friend,  Staff-surgeon M'Leod, who had obtained permission to accompany me to the  limits of the colony, followed my men along the great western road. We  moved leisurely over the level country, between the coast and the Nepean  River, and availed ourselves of the kind hospitality of those of our  friends whose property lay along that line of road, to secure more  comfortable places of rest than the inns would have afforded.    We reached Sheane, the residence of Dr. Harris, on the 11th, and were  received by him with the characteristic kindness with which friends or  strangers are ever welcomed by that gentleman, He had accompanied  Mr. Oxley as a volunteer in 1818, and his name was then given to the  mount which formed the extreme point to which the main body of the first  expedition down the banks of the Macquarie penetrated, in a westerly  direction.    The general appearance of the property of Dr. Harris, showed how much  perseverance and labour had effected towards its improvement. Many acres  of ground bore a promising crop, over which a gloomy forest had once  waved. The Doctor's farming establishment was as complete as his husbandry  seemed to be prosperous; but he did not appear to be satisfied with the  extent of his dwelling, to which he was making considerable additions,  although I should have thought it large enough for all ordinary purposes  of residence or hospitality. The rewards of successful industry were  everywhere visible.    FROM EMU PLAINS TO WELLINGTON VALLEY.    On the 13th, we gained Regent's Ville, the more splendid mansion of Sir  John Jamieson, which overlooks the Nepean River, and commands the most  beautiful and extensive views of the Blue Mountains. Crossing the ford on  the 14th, we overtook the men as they were toiling up the first ascent of  those rugged bulwarks, which certainly gave no favourable earnest of the  road before us; and, as we could scarcely hope to reach the level country  to the westward without the occurrence of some accident, I determined to  keep near the drays, that I might be on hand should my presence be  required. We gained O'Connell's plains on the 20th November, and arrived  at Bathurst on the 22nd, with no other damage than the loss of one of the  props supporting the boat which snapped in two as we descended Mount York.  On examination, it was found that the boat had also received a slight  contusion, but it admitted of easy repair.    I was detained at Bathurst longer than I intended, in consequence of  indisposition, and during my stay there"]]]
