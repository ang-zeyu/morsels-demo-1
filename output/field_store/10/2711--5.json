[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6955"],[0,"The Prince and Betty (#10)"],[1," a perfectly  good prince for her to marry. Some fool notion of romance, of course. Not  that he was angry. He did not blame her any more than the surgeon blames  a patient for the possession of an unsuitable appendix. There was no  animus in the matter. Her mind was suffering from foolish ideas, and he  was the surgeon whose task it was to operate upon it. That was all. One  had to expect foolishness in women. It was their nature. The only thing  to do was to tie a rope to them and let them run around till they were  tired of it, then pull them in. He saw his way to managing Betty.    Nor did he anticipate trouble with John. He had taken an estimate of  John's character, and it did not seem to him likely that it contained  unsuspected depths. He set John down, as he had told Betty, as a young  man acute enough to know when he had a good job and sufficiently  sensible to make concessions in order to retain it. Betty, after the  manner of woman, might make a fuss before yielding to the inevitable,  but from level-headed John he looked for placid acquiescence.    His mood, as the automobile whirred its way down the hill toward the  town, was sunny. He looked on life benevolently and found it good. The  view appealed to him more than it had managed to do on other days. As a  rule, he was the man of blood and iron who had no time for admiring  scenery, but to-day he vouchsafed it a not unkindly glance. It was  certainly a dandy little place, this island of his. A vineyard on the  right caught his eye. He made a mental note to uproot it and run up a  hotel in its place. Further down the hill, he selected a site for a  villa, where the mimosa blazed, and another where at present there were  a number of utterly useless violets. A certain practical element was  apt, perhaps, to color Mr. Scobell's half-hours with nature.    The sight of the steamboat leaving the harbor on its journey to  Marseilles gave him another idea. Now that Mervo was a going concern, a  real live proposition, it was high time that it should have an adequate  service of boats. The present system of one a day was absurd. He made a  note to look into the matter. These people wanted waking up.    Arriving at the Palace, he was informed that His Highness had gone out  shortly after breakfast, and had not returned. The majordomo gave the  information with a tinkle of disapproval in his voice. Before taking up  his duties at Mervo, he had held a similar position in the household of  a German prince, where rigid ceremonial obtained, and John's cheerful  disregard of the formalities frankly shocked him. To take the present  case for instance: When His Highness of Swartzheim had felt inclined to  enjoy the air of a morning, it had been a domestic event full of stir  and pomp. He had not merely crammed a soft hat over his eyes and  strolled out with his hands in his pockets, but without a word to his  household staff as to where he was going or when he might be expected  to return.    Mr. Scobell received the news equably, and directed his chauffeur to  return to the villa. He could not have done better, for, on his  arrival, he was met with the information that His Highness had called  to see him shortly after he had left, and was now waiting in the  morning-room.    The sound of footsteps came to Mr. Scobell's ears as he approached the  room. His Highness appeared to be pacing the floor like a caged animal  at the luncheon hour. The resemblance was heightened by the expression  in the royal eye as His Highness swung round at the opening of the door  and faced the financier.    \"Why, say, Prince,\" said Mr. Scobell, \"this is lucky. I been looking  for you. I just been to the Palace, and the main guy there told me you  had gone out.\"    \"I did. And I met your stepdaughter.\"    Mr. Scobell was astonished. Fate was certainly smoothing his way if it  arranged meetings between Betty and the Prince before he had time to do  it himself. There might be no need for the iron hand after all.    \"You did?\" he said. \"Say, how the Heck did you come to do that? What  did you know about Betty?\"    \"Miss Silver and I had met before, in America, when I was in college.\"    Mr. Scobell slapped his thigh joyously.    \"Gee, it's all working out like a fiction story in the magazines!\"    \"Is it?\" said John. \"How? And, for the matter of that, what?\"    Mr. Scobell answered question with question. \"Say, Prince, you and  Betty were pretty good friends in the old days, I guess?\"    John looked at him coldly.    \"We won't discuss that, if you don't mind,\" he said.    His tone annoyed Mr. Scobell. Off came the velvet glove, and the iron  hand displayed itself. His green eyes glowed dully and the tip of his  nose wriggled, as was its habit in times of emotion.    \"Is that so?\" he cried, regarding John with disfavor. \"Well, I guess!  Won't discuss it! You gotta discuss it, Your Royal Texas League  Highness! You want making a head shorter, my bucko. You--\"    John's demeanor had become so dangerous that he broke off abruptly, and  with an unostentatious movement, as of a man strolling carelessly about  his private sanctum, put himself within easy reach of the door handle.    He then became satirical.    \"Maybe Your Serene, Imperial Two-by-Fourness would care to suggest a  subject we can discuss?\"    John took a step forward.    \"Yes, I will,\" he said between his teeth. \"You were talking to Miss  Silver about me this morning. She told me one or two of the things you  said, and they opened my eyes. Until I heard them, I had not quite  understood my position. I do now. You said, among other things, that I  was your hired man.\"    \"It wasn't intended for you to hear,\" said Mr. Scobell, slightly  mollified, \"and Betty shouldn't oughter have handed it to you. I don't  wonder you feel raw. I wouldn't say that sort of thing to a guy's face.  Sure, no. Tact's my middle name. But, since you have heard it, well--!\"    \"Don't apologize. You were quite right. I was a fool not to see it  before. No description could have been fairer. You might have said much  more. You might have added that I was nothing more than a steerer for a  gambling hell.\"    \"Oh, come, Prince!\"    There was a knock at the door. A footman entered, bearing, with a  detached air, as if he disclaimed all responsibility, a letter on a  silver tray.    Mr. Scobell slit the envelope, and began to read. As he did so his eyes  grew round, and his mouth slowly opened till his cigar stump, after  hanging for a moment from his lower lip, dropped off like an exhausted  bivalve and rolled along the carpet.    \"Prince,\" he gasped, \"she's gone. Betty!\"    \"Gone! What do you mean?\"    \"She's beaten it. She's half-way to Marseilles by now. Gee, and I saw  the darned boat going out!\"    \"She's gone!\"    \"This is from her. Listen what she says:       \"_By the time you read this I shall be gone. I am going back     to America as quickly as I can. I am giving this to a boy to     take to you directly the boat has started. Please do not try     to bring me back. I would sooner die than marry the Prince._\"    John started violently.    \"What!\" he cried.    Mr. Scobell nodded sympathy.    \"That's what she says. She sure has it in bad for you. What does she  mean? Seeing you and she are old friends--\"    \"I don't understand. Why does she say that to you? Why should she think  that you knew that I had asked her to marry me?\"    \"Eh?\" cried Mr. Scobell. \"You asked her to marry you? And she turned  you down! Prince, this beats the band. Say, you and I must get together  and do something. The girl's mad. See here, you aren't wise to what's  been happening. I been fixing this thing up. I fetched you over here,  and then I fetched Betty, and I was going to have you two marry. I told  Betty all about it this morning.\"    John cut through his explanations with a sudden sharp cry. A blinding  blaze of understanding had flashed upon him. It was as if he had been  groping his way in a dark cavern and had stumbled unexpectedly into  brilliant sunlight. He understood everything now. Every word that Betty  had spoken, every gesture that she had made, had become amazingly  clear. He saw now why she had shrunk back from him, why her eyes had  worn that look. He dared not face the picture of himself as he must  have appeared in those eyes, the man whom Mr. Benjamin Scobell's Casino  was paying to marry her, the hired man earning his wages by speaking  words of love.    A feeling of physical sickness came over him. He held to the table for  support as he had held to the sandstone rock. And then came rage, rage  such as he had never felt before, rage that he had not thought himself  capable of feeling. It swept over him in a wave, pouring through his  veins and blinding him, and he clung to the table till his knuckles  whitened under the strain, for he knew that he was very near to murder.    A minute passed. He walked to the window, and stood there, looking out.  Vaguely he heard Mr. Scobell's voice at his back, talking on, but the  words had no meaning for him.    He had begun to think with a curious coolness. His detachment surprised  him. It was one of those rare moments in a man's life when, from the  outside, through a breach in that wall of excuses and self-deception  which he has been at such pains to build, he looks at himself  impartially.    The sight that John saw through the wall was not comforting. It was not  a heroic soul that, stripped of its defenses, shivered beneath the  scrutiny. In another mood he would have mended the breach, excusing and  extenuating, but not now. He looked at himself without pity, and saw  himself weak, slothful, devoid of all that was clean and fine, and a  bitter contempt filled him.    Outside the window, a blaze of color, Mervo smiled up at him, and  suddenly he found himself loathing its exotic beauty. He felt stifled.  This was no place for a man. A vision of clean winds and wide spaces  came to him.    And just then, at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6971"],[0,"Judaism (#10)"],[1,"all this not only while submitting  to Law, but under the stress of a passionate submission to it. He added  in particular a new beauty to the Sabbath. Many of the most fascinatingly  religious rites connected now with the Sabbath are of his devising. The  white Sabbath garb, the joyous mystical hymns full of the Bride and of  Love, the special Sabbath foods, the notion of the 'over-Soul'--these  and many other of the Lurian rites and fancies still hold wide sway  in the Orient. The 'over-Soul' was a very inspiring conception, which  certainly did not originate with Luria. According to a Talmudic Rabbi  (Resh Lakish, third century), on Adam was bestowed a higher soul on  the Sabbath, which he lost at the close of the day. Luria seized upon  this mystical idea, and used it at once to spiritualise the Sabbath and  attach to it an ecstatic joyousness. The ritual of the 'over-Soul' was  an elaborate means by which a relation was established between heaven  and earth. But all this symbolism had but the slightest connection with  dogma. It was practical through and through. It emerged in a number of new  rites, it based itself on and became the cause of a deepening devotion to  morality. Luria would have looked with dismay on the moral laxity which  did later on intrude, in consequence of unbridled emotionalism and mystic  hysteria. There comes the point when he that interprets Law emotionally  is no longer Law-abiding. The antinomian crisis thus produced meets us in  the careers of many who, like Sabbatai Zebi, assumed the Messianic role.    Jewish mysticism, starting as an ascetic corrective to the conventional  hedonism, lost its ascetic character and degenerated into licentiousness.  This was the case with the eighteenth-century mysticism known as  Chassidism, though, as its name ('Saintliness') implies, it was  innocent enough at its initiation. Violent dances, and other emotional  and sensual stimulations, led to a state of exaltation during which  the line of morality was overstepped. But there was nevertheless,  as Dr. Schechter has shown, considerable spiritual worth and beauty  in Chassidism. It transferred the centre of gravity from thinking to  feeling; it led away from the worship of Scripture to the love of God.  The fresh air of religion was breathed once more, the stars and the open  sky replaced the midnight lamp and the college. But it was destined to  raise a fog more murky than the confined atmosphere of the study. The  man with the book was often nearer God than was the man of the earth.    The opposition of Talmudism against the neo-mysticism was thus on the  whole just and salutary. This opposition, no doubt, was bitter chiefly  when mysticism became revolutionary in practice, when it invaded the  established customs of legalistic orthodoxy. But it was also felt that  mysticism went dangerously near to a denial of the absolute Unity of  God. It was more difficult to attack it on its theoretical than on its  practical side, however. The Jewish mystic did sometimes adopt a most  irritating policy of deliberately altering customs as though for the  very pleasure of change. Now in most religious controversies discipline  counts for more than belief. As Salimbene asserts of his own day:  'It was far less dangerous to debate in the schools whether God really  existed, than to wear publicly and pertinaciously a frock and cowl of  any but the orthodox cut.' But the Talmudists' antagonism to mysticism  was not exclusively of this kind in the eighteenth century. Mysticism  is often mere delusion. In the last resort man has no other guide than  his reason. It is his own reason that convinces him of the limitations  of his reason. But those limitations are not to be overpassed by a  visionary self-introspection, unless this, too, is subjected to rational  criticism. Mysticism does its true part when it applies this criticism  also to the current forms, conventions, and institutions. Conventions,  forms, and institutions, after all, represent the corporate wisdom,  the accumulated experiences of men throughout the ages. Mysticism is the  experience of one. Each does right to test the corporate experience by  his own experience. But he must not elevate himself into a law even for  himself. That, in a sentence, would summarise the attitude of Judaism  towards mysticism. It is medicine, not a food.        CHAPTER VII    ESCHATOLOGY      That the soul has a life of its own after death was a firmly fixed  idea in Judaism, though, except in the works of philosophers and in  the liberal theology of modern Judaism, the grosser conception of a  bodily Resurrection was predominant over the purely spiritual idea of  Immortality. Curiously enough, Maimonides, who formulated the belief in  Resurrection as a dogma of the Synagogue, himself held that the world to  come is altogether free from material factors. At a much earlier period  (in the third century) Rab had said (Ber. 17 a): 'Not as this world is  the world to come. In the world to come there is no eating or drinking,  no sexual intercourse, no barter, no envy, hatred, or contention. But the  righteous sit with their crowns on their heads, enjoying the splendour  of the Shechinah (the Divine Presence).' Commenting on this in various  places, Maimonides emphatically asserts the spirituality of the future  life. In his _Siraj_ he says, with reference to the utterance of  Rab just quoted: 'By the remark of the Sages \"with their crowns on their  heads\" is meant the preservation of the soul in the intellectual sphere,  and the merging of the two into one.... By their remark \"enjoying the  splendour of the Shechinah\" is meant that those souls will reap bliss in  what they comprehend of the Creator, just as the Angels enjoy felicity in  what they understand of His existence. And so the felicity and the final  goal consists in reaching to this exalted company and attaining this high  pitch.' Again, in his philosophical _Guide_ (I. xli.), Maimonides  distinguishes three kinds of 'soul': (1) The principle of animality, (2)  the principle of humanity, and (3) the principle of intellectuality, that  part of man's individuality which can exist independently of the body,  and therefore alone survives death. Even more remarkable is the fact that  Maimonides enunciates the same opinion in his Code (Laws of Repentance,  viii. 2). For the Code differs from the other two of the three main  works of Maimonides in that it is less personal, and expresses what the  author conceives to be the general opinion of Judaism as interpreted by  its most authoritative teachers.    There can be no question but that this repeated insistence of Maimonides  has strongly affected all subsequent Jewish thought. To him, eternal  bliss consists in perfect spiritual communion with God. 'He who desires to  serve God from Love must not serve to win the future world. But he does  right and eschews wrong because he is man, and owes it to his manhood  to perfect himself. This effort brings him to the type of perfect man,  whose soul shall live in the state that befits it, viz. in the world to  come.' Thus the world to come is a state rather than a place.    But Maimonides' view was not accepted without dispute. It was indeed  quite easy to cite Rabbinic passages in which the world to come is  identified with the bodily Resurrection. Against Maimonides were produced  such Talmudic utterances as the following: 'Said Rabbi Chiya b. Joseph,  the Righteous shall arise clad in their garments, for if a grain of wheat  which is buried naked comes forth with many garments, how much more shall  the righteous arise full garbed, seeing that they were interred with  shrouds' (Kethub. 111 b). Again, 'Rabbi Jannai said to his children,  Bury me not in white garments or in black: not in white, lest I be not  held worthy (of heaven) and thus may be like a bridegroom among mourners  (in Gehenna); nor in black, lest if I am held worthy, I be like a mourner  among bridegrooms (in heaven). But bury me in coloured garments (so that  my appearance will be partly in keeping with either fate),' (Sabbath,  114 a). Or finally: 'They arise with their blemishes, and then are healed'  (Sanh. 91 b).    The popular fancy, in its natural longing for a personal existence  after the bodily death, certainly seized upon the belief in Resurrection  with avidity. It had its roots partly in the individual consciousness,  partly in the communal. For the Resurrection was closely connected with  such hopes as those expressed in Ezekiel's vision of the re-animation  of Israel's dry bones (Ezek. xxxvii.). Thus popular theology adopted  many ideas based on the Resurrection. The myth of the Leviathan hardly  belongs here, for, widespread as it was, it was certainly not regarded  in a material light. The Leviathan was created on the fifth day, and  its flesh will be served as a banquet for the righteous at the advent  of Messiah. The mediaeval poets found much attraction in this idea,  and allowed their imagination full play concerning the details of  the divine repast. Maimonides entirely spiritualised the idea, and  his example was here decisive. The conception of the Resurrection  had other consequences. As the scene of the Resurrection is to be  Jerusalem, there grew up a strong desire to be buried on the western  slope of Mount Olivet. In fact, many burial and mourning customs of  the Synagogue originated from a belief in the bodily Resurrection. But  even in the orthodox liturgy the direct references to it are vague and  idealised. Two passages of great beauty may be cited. The first is taken  from the _Authorised Daily Prayer Book_ (ed. Singer, p. 5):    'O my God, the soul which Thou gavest me is pure; Thou didst create it,  Thou didst form it, Thou didst breathe it into me; Thou preservest it  within me; and Thou wilt take it from me, but wilt restore it unto me  hereafter. So long as the soul is within me, I will give thanks unto  Thee,"]]]
