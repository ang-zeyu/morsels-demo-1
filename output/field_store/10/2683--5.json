Did I tire of the voyage in all that  time? Not a bit of it! I was never in better trim in all my life, and  was eager for the more perilous experience of rounding the Horn.    It was not at all strange in a life common to sailors that, having  already crossed the Atlantic twice and being now half-way from Boston  to the Horn, I should find myself still among friends. My  determination to sail westward from Gibraltar not only enabled me to  escape the pirates of the Red Sea, but, in bringing me to Pernambuco,  landed me on familiar shores. I had made many voyages to this and  other ports in Brazil. In 1893 I was employed as master to take the  famous Ericsson ship _Destroyer_ from New York to Brazil to go against  the rebel Mello and his party. The _Destroyer_, by the way, carried a  submarine cannon of enormous length.    In the same expedition went the _Nictheroy_, the ship purchased by the  United States government during the Spanish war and renamed the  _Buffalo_. The _Destroyer_ was in many ways the better ship of the  two, but the Brazilians in their curious war sank her themselves at  Bahia. With her sank my hope of recovering wages due me; still, I  could but try to recover, for to me it meant a great deal. But now  within two years the whirligig of time had brought the Mello party  into power, and although it was the legal government which had  employed me, the so-called \"rebels\" felt under less obligation to me  than I could have wished.    During these visits to Brazil I had made the acquaintance of Dr.  Perera, owner and editor of \"El Commercio Jornal,\" and soon after the  _Spray_ was safely moored in Upper Topsail Reach, the doctor, who is a  very enthusiastic yachtsman, came to pay me a visit and to carry me up  the waterway of the lagoon to his country residence. The approach to  his mansion by the waterside was guarded by his armada, a fleet of  boats including a Chinese sampan, a Norwegian pram, and a Cape Ann  dory, the last of which he obtained from the _Destroyer_. The doctor  dined me often on good Brazilian fare, that I might, as he said,  \"salle gordo\" for the voyage; but he found that even on the best I  fattened slowly.    Fruits and vegetables and all other provisions necessary for the  voyage having been taken in, on the 23d of October I unmoored and made  ready for sea. Here I encountered one of the unforgiving Mello faction  in the person of the collector of customs, who charged the _Spray_  tonnage dues when she cleared, notwithstanding that she sailed with a  yacht license and should have been exempt from port charges. Our  consul reminded the collector of this and of the fact--without much  diplomacy, I thought--that it was I who brought the _Destroyer_ to  Brazil. \"Oh, yes,\" said the bland collector; \"we remember it very  well,\" for it was now in a small way his turn.    Mr. Lungrin, a merchant, to help me out of the trifling difficulty,  offered to freight the _Spray_ with a cargo of gunpowder for Bahia,  which would have put me in funds; and when the insurance companies  refused to take the risk on cargo shipped on a vessel manned by a crew  of only one, he offered to ship it without insurance, taking all the  risk himself. This was perhaps paying me a greater compliment than I  deserved. The reason why I did not accept the business was that in so  doing I found that I should vitiate my yacht license and run into more  expense for harbor dues around the world than the freight would amount  to. Instead of all this, another old merchant friend came to my  assistance, advancing the cash direct.    While at Pernambuco I shortened the boom, which had been broken when  off the coast of Morocco, by removing the broken piece, which took  about four feet off the inboard end; I also refitted the jaws. On  October 24,1895, a fine day even as days go in Brazil, the _Spray_  sailed, having had abundant good cheer. Making about one hundred miles  a day along the coast, I arrived at Rio de Janeiro November 5, without  any event worth mentioning, and about noon cast anchor near  Villaganon, to await the official port visit. On the following day I  bestirred myself to meet the highest lord of the admiralty and the  ministers, to inquire concerning the matter of wages due me from the  beloved _Destroyer_. The high official I met said: \"Captain, so far as  we are concerned, you may have the ship, and if you care to accept her  we will send an officer to show you where she is.\" I knew well enough  where she was at that moment. The top of her smoke-stack being awash  in Bahia, it was more than likely that she rested on the bottom there.  I thanked the kind officer, but declined his offer.    The _Spray_, with a number of old shipmasters on board, sailed about  the harbor of Rio the day before she put to sea. As I had decided to  give the _Spray_ a yawl rig for the tempestuous waters of Patagonia, I  here placed on the stern a semicircular brace to support a jigger  mast. These old captains inspected the _Spray's_ rigging, and each one  contributed something to her outfit. Captain Jones, who had acted as  my interpreter at Rio, gave her an anchor, and one of the steamers  gave her a cable to match it. She never dragged Jones's anchor once on  the voyage, and the cable not only stood the strain on a lee shore,  but when towed off Cape Horn helped break combing seas astern that  threatened to board her.          CHAPTER VI      Departure from Rio de Janeiro--The _Spray_ ashore on the sands of  Uruguay--A narrow escape from shipwreck--The boy who found a  sloop--The _Spray_ floated but somewhat damaged--Courtesies from the  British consul at Maldonado--A warm greeting at Montevideo--An  excursion to Buenos Aires--Shortening the mast and bowsprit.    On November 28 the _Spray_ sailed from Rio de Janeiro, and first of  all ran into a gale of wind, which tore up things generally along the  coast, doing considerable damage to shipping. It was well for her,  perhaps, that she was clear of the land. Coasting along on this part  of the voyage, I observed that while some of the small vessels I  fell in with were able to outsail the _Spray_ by day, they fell astern  of her by night. To the _Spray_ day and night were the same; to the  others clearly there was a difference. On one of the very fine days  experienced after leaving Rio, the steamship _South Wales_ spoke the  _Spray_ and unsolicited gave the longitude by chronometer as 48  degrees W., \"as near as I can make it,\" the captain said. The _Spray_,  with her tin clock, had exactly the same reckoning. I was feeling at  ease in my primitive method of navigation, but it startled me not a  little to find my position by account verified by the ship's  chronometer. On December 5 a barkantine hove in sight, and for several  days the two vessels sailed along the coast together. Right here a  current was experienced setting north, making it necessary to hug the  shore, with which the _Spray_ became rather familiar. Here I confess a  weakness: I hugged the shore entirely too close. In a word, at  daybreak on the morning of December 11 the _Spray_ ran hard and fast  on the beach. This was annoying; but I soon found that the sloop was  in no great danger. The false appearance of the sand-hills under a  bright moon had deceived me, and I lamented now that I had trusted to  appearances at all. The sea, though moderately smooth, still carried a  swell which broke with some force on the shore. I managed to launch my  small dory from the deck, and ran out a kedge-anchor and warp; but it  was too late to kedge the sloop off, for the tide was falling and she  had already sewed a foot. Then I went about \"laying out\" the larger  anchor, which was no easy matter, for my only life-boat, the frail  dory, when the anchor and cable were in it, was swamped at once in the  surf, the load being too great for her. Then I cut the cable and made  two loads of it instead of one. The anchor, with forty fathoms bent  and already buoyed, I now took and succeeded in getting through the  surf; but my dory was leaking fast, and by the time I had rowed far  enough to drop the anchor she was full to the gunwale and sinking.  There was not a moment to spare, and I saw clearly that if I failed  now all might be lost. I sprang from the oars to my feet, and lifting  the anchor above my head, threw it clear just as she was turning over.  I grasped her gunwale and held on as she turned bottom up, for I  suddenly remembered that I could not swim. Then I tried to right her,  but with too much eagerness, for she rolled clean over, and left me as  before, clinging to her gunwale, while my body was still in the water.  Giving a moment to cool reflection, I found that although the wind was  blowing moderately toward the land, the current was carrying me to  sea, and that something would have to be done. Three times I had been  under water, in trying to right the dory, and I was just saying, \"Now  I lay me,\" when I was seized by a determination to try yet once more,  so that no one of the prophets of evil I had left behind me could say,  \"I told you so.\" Whatever the danger may have been, much or little, I  can truly say that the moment was the most serene of my life.    [Illustration: \"I suddenly remembered that I could not swim.\"]    After righting the dory for the fourth time, I finally succeeded by  the utmost care in keeping her upright while I hauled myself into her  and with one of the oars, which I had recovered, paddled to the shore,  somewhat the worse for wear and pretty full of salt water. The  position of my vessel, now high and dry, gave me anxiety. To get her  afloat again was all I thought of or cared for. I had little  difficulty in carrying the second part of my cable out and securing it  to the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6322"],[0,"Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America, During the (#10)"],[1," parallel of Charlestown, opposite  Cape Henlopen, from 40 to 50 leagues. The rapidity of the current  is from three to five miles an hour where the stream is narrowest,  and is only one mile as it advances towards the north. The waters  of the Mexican Gulf; forcibly drawn to north-east, preserve their  warm temperature to such a point, that in 40 and 41 degrees of  latitude I found them at 22.5 degrees (18 degrees R.) when, out of  the current, the heat of the ocean at its surface was scarcely 17.5  degrees (14 degrees R.). In the parallel of New York and Oporto,  the temperature of the Gulf-stream is consequently equal to that of  the seas of the tropics in the 18th degree of latitude, as, for  instance, in the parallel of Porto Rico and the islands of Cape  Verd.    To the east of the port of Boston, and on the meridian of Halifax,  in latitude 41 degrees 25 minutes, and longitude 67 degrees, the  current is near 80 leagues broad. From this point it turns suddenly  to the east, so that its western edge, as it bends, becomes the  western limit of the running waters, skirting the extremity of the  great bank of Newfoundland, which M. Volney ingeniously calls the  bar of the mouth of this enormous sea-river. The cold waters of  this bank, which according to my experiments are at a temperature  of 8.7 or 10 degrees (7 or 8 degrees R.) present a striking  contrast with the waters of the torrid zone, driven northward by  the Gulf-stream, the temperature of which is from 21 to 22.5  degrees (17 to 18 degrees R.). in these latitudes, the caloric is  distributed in a singular manner throughout the ocean; the waters  of the bank are 9.4 degrees colder than the neighbouring sea; and  this sea is 3 degrees colder than the current. These zones can have  no equilibrium of temperature, having a source of heat, or a cause  of refrigeration, which is peculiar to each, and the influence of  which is permanent.    From the bank of Newfoundland, or from the 52nd degree of longitude  to the Azores, the Gulf-stream continues its course to east and  east-south-east. The waters are still acted upon by the impulsion  they received near a thousand leagues distance, in the straits of  Florida, between the island of Cuba and the shoals of Tortoise  Island. This distance is double the length of the course of the  river Amazon, from Jaen or the straits of Manseriche to Grand Para.  On the meridian of the islands of Corvo and Flores, the most  western of the group of the Azores, the breadth of the current is  160 leagues. When vessels, on their return from South America to  Europe, endeavour to make these two islands to rectify their  longitude, they are always sensible of the motion of the waters to  south-east. At the 33rd degree of latitude the equinoctial current  of the tropics is in the near vicinity of the Gulf-stream. In this  part of the ocean, we may in a single day pass from waters that  flow towards the west, into those which run to the south-east or  east-south-east.    From the Azores, the current of Florida turns towards the straits  of Gibraltar, the isle of Madeira, and the group of the Canary  Islands. The opening of the Pillars of Hercules has no doubt  accelerated the motion of the waters towards the east. We may in  this point of view assert, that the strait, by which the  Mediterranean communicates with the Atlantic, produces its effects  at a great distance; but it is probable also, that, without the  existence of this strait, vessels sailing to Teneriffe would be  driven south-east by a cause which we must seek on the coasts of  the New World. Every motion is the cause of another motion in the  vast basin of the seas as well as in the aerial ocean. Tracing the  currents to their most distant sources, and reflecting on their  variable celerity, sometimes decreasing as between the gulf of  Florida and the bank of Newfoundland; at other times augmenting, as  in the neighbourhood of the straits of Gibraltar, and near the  Canary Islands, we cannot doubt but the same cause which impels the  waters to make the circuitous sweep of the gulf of Mexico, agitates  them also near the island of Madeira.    On the south of that island, we may follow the current, in its  direction south-east and south-south-east towards the coast of  Africa, between Cape Cantin and Cape Bojador. In those latitudes a  vessel becalmed is running on the coast, while, according to the  uncorrected reckoning, it was supposed to be a good distance out at  sea. Were the motion of the waters caused by the opening at the  straits of Gibraltar, why, on the south of those straits, should it  not follow an opposite direction? On the contrary, in the 25th and  26th degrees of latitude, the current flows at first direct south,  and then south-west. Cape Blanc, which, after Cape Verd, is the  most salient promontory, seems to have an influence on this  direction, and in this parallel the waters, of which we have  followed the course from the coasts of Honduras to those of Africa,  mingle with the great current of the tropics to resume their tour  from east to west. Several hundred leagues westward of the Canary  Islands, the motion peculiar to the equinoctial waters is felt in  the temperate zone from the 28th and 29th degrees of north  latitude; but on the meridian of the island of Ferro, vessels sail  southward as far as the tropic of Cancer, before they find  themselves, by their reckoning, eastward of their right course.* (*  See Humboldt's Cosmos volume 1 page 312 Bohn's edition.)    We have just seen that between the parallels of 11 and 43 degrees,  the waters of the Atlantic are driven by the currents in a  continual whirlpool. Supposing that a molecule of water returns to  the same place from which it departed, we can estimate, from our  present knowledge of the swiftness of currents, that this circuit  of 3800 leagues is not terminated in less than two years and ten  months. A boat, which may be supposed to receive no impulsion from  the winds, would require thirteen months to go from the Canary  Islands to the coast of Caracas, ten months to make the tour of the  gulf of Mexico and reach Tortoise Shoals opposite the port of the  Havannah, while forty or fifty days might be sufficient to carry it  from the straits of Florida to the bank of Newfoundland. It would  be difficult to fix the rapidity of the retrograde current from  this bank to the shores of Africa; estimating the mean velocity of  the waters at seven or eight miles in twenty-four hours, we may  allow ten or eleven months for this last distance. Such are the  effects of the slow but regular motion which agitates the waters of  the Atlantic. Those of the river Amazon take nearly forty-five days  to flow from Tomependa to Grand Para.    A short time before my arrival at Teneriffe, the sea had left in  the road of Santa Cruz the trunk of a cedrela odorata covered with  the bark. This American tree vegetates within the tropics, or in  the neighbouring regions. It had no doubt been torn up on the coast  of the continent, or of that of Honduras. The nature of the wood,  and the lichens which covered its bark, bore evidence that this  trunk had not belonged to these submarine forests which ancient  revolutions of the globe have deposited in the polar regions. If  the cedrela, instead of having been cast on the strand of  Teneriffe, had been carried farther south, It would probably have  made the whole tour of the Atlantic, and returned to its native  soil with the general current of the tropics. This conjecture is  supported by a fact of more ancient date, recorded in the history  of the Canaries by the abbe Viera. In 1770, a small vessel laden  with corn, and bound from the island of Lancerota, to Santa Cruz,  in Teneriffe, was driven out to sea, while none of the crew were on  board. The motion of the waters from east to west, carried it to  America, where it went on shore at La Guayra, near Caracas.    Whilst the art of navigation was yet in its infancy, the  Gulf-stream suggested to the mind of Christopher Columbus certain  indications of the existence of western regions. Two corpses, the  features of which indicated a race of unknown men, were cast ashore  on the Azores, towards the end of the 15th century. Nearly at the  same period, the brother-in-law of Columbus, Peter Correa, governor  of Porto Santo, found on the strand of that island pieces of bamboo  of extraordinary size, brought thither by the western currents. The  dead bodies and the bamboos attracted the attention of the Genoese  navigator, who conjectured that both came from a continent situate  towards the west. We now know that in the torrid zone the  trade-winds and the current of the tropics are in opposition to  every motion of the waves in the direction of the earth's rotation.  The productions of the new world cannot reach the old but by the  very high latitudes, and in following the direction of the current  of Florida. The fruits of several trees of the Antilles are often  washed ashore on the coasts of the islands of Ferro and Gomera.  Before the discovery of America, the Canarians considered these  fruits as coming from the enchanted isle of St. Borondon, which  according to the reveries of pilots, and certain legends, was  situated towards the west in an unknown part of the ocean, buried,  as was supposed, in eternal mists.    My chief view in tracing a sketch of the currents of the Atlantic  is to prove that the motion of the waters towards the south-east,  from Cape St. Vincent to the Canary Islands, is the effect of the  general motion to which the surface of the ocean is subjected at  its western extremity. We shall give but a very succinct account of  the arm of the Gulf-stream, which in the 45th and 50th degrees of  latitude, near the bank called the Bonnet Flamand, runs from  south-west to north-east towards the coasts of Europe. This partial  current becomes very strong at those times when the west winds"]]]
