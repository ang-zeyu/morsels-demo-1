For one dizzy instant he felt as if he were being dismembered in the  grip of an earthquake; then suddenly he was free, sprawling on the  floor, and the monster was gasping out its life beneath him, its red  eyes turned upward, the hilt of the poniard quivering in its breast. His  desperate stab had gone home.    Conan was panting as if after long conflict, trembling in every limb.  Some of his joints felt as if they had been dislocated, and blood  dripped from scratches on his skin where the monster's talons had  ripped; his muscles and tendons had been savagely wrenched and twisted.  If the beast had lived a second longer, it would surely have dismembered  him. But the Cimmerian's mighty strength had resisted, for the fleeting  instant it had endured, the dying convulsion of the ape that would have  torn a lesser man limb from limb.          6    The Thrust of a Knife      Conan stooped and tore the knife from the monster's breast. Then he went  swiftly up the stair. What other shapes of fear the darkness held he  could not guess, but he had no desire to encounter any more. This  touch-and-go sort of battling was too strenuous even for the giant  Cimmerian. The moonlight was fading from the floor, the darkness closing  in, and something like panic pursued him up the stair. He breathed a  gusty sigh of relief when he reached the head, and felt the third key  turn in the lock. He opened the door slightly, and craned his neck to  peer through, half expecting an attack from some human or bestial enemy.    He looked into a bare stone corridor, dimly lighted, and a slender,  supple figure stood before the door.    'Your Majesty!' It was a low, vibrant cry, half in relief and half in  fear. The girl sprang to his side, then hesitated as if abashed.    'You bleed,' she said. 'You have been hurt!'    He brushed aside the implication with an impatient hand.    'Scratches that wouldn't hurt a baby. Your skewer came in handy, though.  But for it Tarascus' monkey would be cracking my shin-bones for the  marrow right now. But what now?'    'Follow me,' she whispered. 'I will lead you outside the city wall. I  have a horse concealed there.'    She turned to lead the way down the corridor, but he laid a heavy hand  on her naked shoulder.    'Walk beside me,' he instructed her softly, passing his massive arm  about her lithe waist. 'You've played me fair so far, and I'm inclined  to believe in you; but I've lived this long only because I've trusted no  one too far, man or woman. So! Now if you play me false you won't live  to enjoy the jest.'    She did not flinch at sight of the reddened poniard or the contact of  his hard muscles about her supple body.    'Cut me down without mercy if I play you false,' she answered. 'The very  feel of your arm about me, even in menace, is as the fulfillment of a  dream.'    The vaulted corridor ended at a door, which she opened. Outside lay  another black man, a giant in turban and silk loin-cloth, with a curved  sword lying on the flags near his hand. He did not move.    'I drugged his wine,' she whispered, swerving to avoid the recumbent  figure. 'He is the last, and outer, guard of the pits. None ever escaped  from them before, and none has ever wished to seek them; so only these  black men guard them. Only these of all the servants knew it was King  Conan that Xaltotun brought a prisoner in his chariot. I was watching,  sleepless, from an upper casement that opened into the court, while the  other girls slept; for I knew that a battle was being fought, or had  been fought, in the west, and I feared for you....    'I saw the blacks carry you up the stair, and I recognized you in the  torchlight. I slipped into this wing of the palace tonight, in time to  see them carry you to the pits. I had not dared come here before  nightfall. You must have lain in drugged senselessness all day in  Xaltotun's chamber.    'Oh, let us be wary! Strange things are afoot in the palace tonight. The  slaves said that Xaltotun slept as he often sleeps, drugged by the lotus  of Stygia, but Tarascus is in the palace. He entered secretly, through  the postern, wrapped in his cloak which was dusty as with long travel,  and attended only by his squire, the lean silent Arideus. I cannot  understand, but I am afraid.'    They came out at the foot of a narrow, winding stair, and mounting it,  passed through a narrow panel which she slid aside. When they had passed  through, she slipped it back in place, and it became merely a portion of  the ornate wall. They were in a more spacious corridor, carpeted and  tapestried, over which hanging lamps shed a golden glow.    Conan listened intently, but he heard no sound throughout the palace. He  did not know in what part of the palace he was, or in which direction  lay the chamber of Xaltotun. The girl was trembling as she drew him  along the corridor, to halt presently beside an alcove masked with satin  tapestry. Drawing this aside, she motioned for him to step into the  niche, and whispered: 'Wait here! Beyond that door at the end of the  corridor we are likely to meet slaves or eunuchs at any time of the day  or night. I will go and see if the way is clear, before we essay it.'    Instantly his hair-trigger suspicions were aroused.    'Are you leading me into a trap?'    Tears sprang into her dark eyes. She sank to her knees and seized his  muscular hand.    'Oh, my king, do not mistrust me now!' Her voice shook with desperate  urgency. 'If you doubt and hesitate, we are lost! Why should I bring you  up out of the pits to betray you now?'    'All right,' he muttered. 'I'll trust you; though, by Crom, the habits  of a lifetime are not easily put aside. Yet I wouldn't harm you now, if  you brought all the swordsmen in Nemedia upon me. But for you Tarascus'  cursed ape would have come upon me in chains and unarmed. Do as you  wish, girl.'    Kissing his hands, she sprang lithely up and ran down the corridor, to  vanish through a heavy double door.    He glanced after her, wondering if he was a fool to trust her; then he  shrugged his mighty shoulders and pulled the satin hangings together,  masking his refuge. It was not strange that a passionate young beauty  should be risking her life to aid him; such things had happened often  enough in his life. Many women had looked on him with favor, in the days  of his wanderings, and in the time of his kingship.    Yet he did not remain motionless in the alcove, waiting for her return.  Following his instincts, he explored the niche for another exit, and  presently found one--the opening of a narrow passage, masked by the  tapestries, that ran to an ornately carved door, barely visible in the  dim light that filtered in from the outer corridor. And as he stared  into it, somewhere beyond that carven door he heard the sound of another  door opening and shutting, and then a low mumble of voices. The familiar  sound of one of those voices caused a sinister expression to cross his  dark face. Without hesitation he glided down the passage, and crouched  like a stalking panther beside the door. It was not locked, and  manipulating it delicately, he pushed it open a crack, with a reckless  disregard for possible consequences that only he could have explained or  defended.    It was masked on the other side by tapestries, but through a thin slit  in the velvet he looked into a chamber lit by a candle on an ebony  table. There were two men in that chamber. One was a scarred,  sinister-looking ruffian in leather breeks and ragged cloak; the other  was Tarascus, king of Nemedia.    Tarascus seemed ill at ease. He was slightly pale, and he kept starting  and glancing about him, as if expecting and fearing to hear some sound  or footstep.    'Go swiftly and at once,' he was saying. 'He is deep in drugged slumber,  but I know not when he may awaken.'    'Strange to hear words of fear issuing from the lips of Tarascus,'  rumbled the other in a harsh, deep voice.    The king frowned.    'I fear no common man, as you well know. But when I saw the cliffs fall  at Valkia I knew that this devil we had resurrected was no charlatan. I  fear his powers, because I do not know the full extent of them. But I  know that somehow they are connected with this accursed thing which I  have stolen from him. It brought him back to life; so it must be the  source of his sorcery.    'He had it hidden well; but following my secret order a slave spied on  him and saw him place it in a golden chest, and saw where he hid the  chest. Even so, I would not have dared steal it had Xaltotun himself not  been sunk in lotus slumber.    'I believe it is the secret of his power. With it Orastes brought him  back to life. With it he will make us all slaves, if we are not wary. So  take it and cast it into the sea as I have bidden you. And be sure you  are so far from land that neither tide nor storm can wash it up on the  beach. You have been paid.'    'So I have,' grunted the ruffian. 'And I owe more than gold to you,  king; I owe you a debt of gratitude. Even thieves can be grateful.'    'Whatever debt you may feel you owe me,' answered Tarascus, 'will be  paid when you have hurled this thing into the sea.'    'I'll ride for Zingara and take ship from Kordava,' promised the other.  'I dare not show my head in Argos, because of the matter of a murder or  so--'    'I care not, so it is done. Here it is; a horse awaits you in the court.  Go, and go swiftly!'    Something passed between them, something that flamed like living fire.  Conan had only a brief glimpse of it; and then the ruffian pulled a  slouch hat over his eyes, drew his cloak about his shoulder, and hurried  from the chamber. And as the door closed behind him, Conan moved with  the devastating fury of unchained blood-lust. He had held himself in  check so long as he could. The sight of his enemy so near him set his  wild blood seething and swept away all caution and restraint.

Certainly the WHIZZER made good time on the earth.    Tom was anxiously watching the gages and other instruments. He  wanted a little more speed, but could not seem to get it. He ran the  motor to the utmost, and then, seeing the necessity of making an  attempt to get up into the air, before the end of the speeding  ground was reached, he pulled the elevating plane lever.    The front of the WHIZZER rose, and then settled down. Tom quickly  shut off the power, and jammed on the brake, an arrangement of  spikes that dug into the earth, for the high board fence loomed up  before him.    \"What's the matter?\" cried Mr. Fenwick, anxiously.    \"Couldn't get up speed enough,\" answered the young inventor. \"We  must have more momentum to make her rise.\"    \"Can it be gotten?\"    \"I think so. I'll gear the motor higher.\"    It took an hour to do this. Once more the scale test was applied. It  registered a pull of fifteen hundred pounds now.    \"We'll go up,\" said Tom, grimly.    Once more the motors spit out fire, and the propellers whirled so  that they looked like mere circles of light. Once more the WHIZZER  shot over the ground, but this time, as she neared the fence, she  rose up like a bird, cleared it like a trick horse, and soared off  into the air!    The WHIZZER was flying!          CHAPTER X    OVER THE OCEAN      \"Hurrah!\" cried Mr. Fenwick in delight. \"My machine is really flying  at last!\"    \"Yes,\" answered Tom, as he adjusted various levers and gears, \"she  is going. It's not as high as I'd like, but it is doing very well,  considering the weight of the craft, and the fact that we have not  used the gas bag. I'm going to let that fill now, and we'll go up.  Don't you want to steer, Mr. Fenwick?\"    \"No, you manage it, Tom, until it's in good running shape. I don't  want to 'hoodoo' it. I worked as hard as I could, and never got more  than two feet off the ground. Now I'm really sailing. It's great!\"    He was very enthusiastic, and Tom himself was not a little pleased  at his own success, for certainly the airship had looked to be a  very dubious proposition at first.    \"Bless my gaiters! But we are doing pretty well,\" remarked Mr.  Damon, looking down on the field where Mr. Fenwick's friends and the  machinists were gathered, cheering and waving their hands.    \"We'll do better,\" declared Tom.    He had already set the gas machine in operation, and was now looking  over the electric apparatus, to see that it was working well. It  needed some adjustments, which he made.    All this while the WHIZZER was moving about in a big circle, for the  rudder had been automatically set to so swing the craft. It was  about two hundred feet high, but soon after the gas began to enter  the bag it rose until it was nearly five thousand feet high. This  satisfied Tom that the airship could do better than he expected, and  he decided to return nearer earth.    In going down, he put the craft through a number of evolutions  designed to test her ability to answer the rudders promptly. The lad  saw opportunity for making a number of changes, and suggested them  to Mr. Fenwick.    \"Are you going any farther?\" asked the owner of the WHIZZER, as he  saw that his craft was slowly settling.    \"No, I think we've done enough for the first day,\" said Tom, \"But  I'd like you to handle her now, Mr. Fenwick. You can make the  landing, while I watch the motor and other machines.\"    \"Yes. I guess I can make a landing all right,\" assented the  inventor. \"I'm better at coming down than going up.\"    He did make a good descent, and received the congratulation of his  friends as he stepped from the airship. Tom was also given much  praise for his success in making the craft go at all, for Mr.  Fenwick and his acquaintances had about given up hope that she ever  would rise.    \"Well, what do you think of her?\" Mr. Fenwick wanted to know of the  young inventor, who replied that, as soon as some further changes  had been made, they would attempt a long flight.    This promise was kept two days later. They were busy days for Tom,  Mr. Fenwick and the latter's assistants. Tom sent a short note to  his father telling of the proposed long flight, and intimated that  he might make a call in Shopton if all went well. He also sent a  wire to Miss Nestor, hinting that she might have some apple  turnovers ready for him.    But Tom never called for that particular pastry, though it was  gotten ready for him when the girl received his message.    All was in readiness for the long flight, and a preliminary test had  demonstrated that the WHIZZER had been wonderfully improved by the  changes Tom made. The young inventor looked over the supply of food  Mr. Fenwick had placed aboard, glanced at the other stores, and  asked:    \"How long do you expect to be gone, Mr. Fenwick?\"    \"Why, don't you think we can stay out a week?\"    \"That's quite a while,\" responded Tom. \"We may be glad to return in  two days, or less. But I think we're all ready to start. Are any of  your friends going?\"    \"I've tried to pursuade some of them to accompany me, but they are a  bit timid,\" said the inventor. \"I guess we three will make up the  party this time, though if our trip is a successful one I'll be  overwhelmed with requests for rides, I suppose.\"    As before, a little crowd gathered to see the start. The day was  warm, but there was a slight haziness which Tom did not like. He  hoped, though, that it would pass over before they had gone far.    \"Do you wish to head for any particular spot, Mr. Fenwick?\" asked  Tom, as they were entering the cabin.    \"Yes, I would like to go down and circle Cape May, New Jersey, if we  could. I have a friend who has a summer cottage there, and he was  always laughing at my airship. I'd just like to drop down in front  of his place now, and pay him a call.\"    \"We'll try it,\" assented Tom, with a smile.    An auspicious start was made, the WHIZZER taking the air after a  short flight across the ground, and then, with the lifting gas  aiding in pulling the craft upward, the airship started to sail high  over the city of Philadelphia.    So swiftly did it rise that the cheers of the little crowd of Mr.  Fenwick's friends were scarcely heard. Up and up it went, and then a  little later, to the astonishment of the crowds in the streets, Tom  put the airship twice in a circle around the statue of William Penn,  on the top of the City Hall.    \"Now you steer,\" the lad invited Mr. Fenwick. \"Take her straight  across the Delaware River, and over Camden, New Jersey, and then  head south, for Cape May. We ought to make it in an hour, for we are  getting up good speed.\"    Leaving the owner in charge of his craft, to that gentleman's no  small delight, Tom and Mr. Damon began an inspection of the  electrical and other machinery. There was much that needed  attention, but Tom soon had the automatic apparatus in working  order, and then less attention need be given to it.    Several times the young investor looked out of the windows with  which the cabin was fitted. Mr. Damon noticed this.    \"Bless my shoe laces, Tom,\" he said. \"What's the matter?\"    \"I don't like the looks of the weather,\" was the answer. \"I think  we're in for a storm.\"    \"Then let's put back.\"    \"No, it would be too bad to disappoint Mr. Fenwick, now that we have  made such a good start. He wants to make a long flight, and I can't  blame him,\" spoke Tom, in a low voice.    \"But if there's danger--\"    \"Oh, well, we can soon be at Cape May, and start back. The wind is  freshening rather suddenly, though,\" and Tom looked at the  anemometer, which showed a speed of twenty miles an hour. However,  it was in their favor, aiding them to make faster time.    The speed of the WHIZZER was now about forty miles an hour, not fast  for an air craft, but sufficiently speedy in trying out a new  machine. Tom looked at the barograph, and noted that they had  attained an altitude of seven thousand five hundred feet.    \"That's better than millionaire Daxtel's distance of seven thousand  one hundred and five feet,\" remarked the lad, with a smile, \"and it  breaks Jackson's climb of seven thousand three hundred and three  feet, which is pretty good for your machine, Mr. Fenwick.\"    \"Do you really think so?\" asked the pleased inventor.    \"Yes. And we'll do better than that in time, but it's best to go  slow at first, until we see how she is standing the strain. This is  high and fast enough for the present.\"    They kept on, and as Tom saw that the machinery was working well, he  let it out a little, The WHIZZER at once leaped forward, and, a  little later they came within sight of Cape May, the Jersey coast  resort.    \"Now to drop down and visit my friend,\" said Mr. Fenwick, with a  smile. \"Won't he be surprised!\"    \"I don't think we'd better do it,\" said Tom.    \"Why not?\"    \"Well, the wind is getting stronger every minute and it will be  against us on the way back. If we descend, and try to make another  ascension we may fail. We're up in the air now, and it may be easy  to turn around and go back. Then, again, it may not, but it  certainly will be easier to shift around up here than down on the  ground. So I'd rather not descend--that is, not entirely to the  ground.\"    \"Well, just as you say, though I wanted my friend to know I could  build a successful airship.\"    \"Oh, we can get around that. I'll take her down as low as is safe,  and fly over his house, if you'll point it out, and you can drop him  a message in one of the pasteboard tubes we carry for that purpose.\"    \"That's a good idea,\" assented Mr. Fenwick. \"I'll do it.\"    Tom sent the WHIZZER down until the hotels and cottages could be  made out quite plainly. After looking with a pair of opera glasses,  Mr. Fenwick picked out the residence of his friend, and Tom prepared  to circle about the roof.    By this time the presence of the airship had become known to  hundreds, and crowds were eagerly watching "]]]
