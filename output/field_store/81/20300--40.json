But  she did say it, and, moreover, I caught Mary Gillespie and Adella  Gilbert exchanging significant smiles.  That settled it, and made  me quite reckless.  \"In for a penny, in for a pound,\" thought I,  and I said with a pensive smile:    \"Nobody here knew anything about him, and it was all long, long  ago.\"    \"What was his name?\" asked Wilhelmina.    \"Cecil Fenwick,\" I answered promptly.  Cecil had always been my  favorite name for a man; it figured quite frequently in the blank  book.  As for the Fenwick part of it, I had a bit of newspaper in  my hand, measuring a hem, with \"Try Fenwick's Porous Plasters\"  printed across it, and I simply joined the two in sudden and  irrevocable matrimony.    \"Where did you meet him?\" asked Georgie.    I hastily reviewed my past.  There was only one place to locate  Cecil Fenwick.  The only time I had ever been far enough away  from Avonlea in my life was when I was eighteen and had gone to  visit an aunt in New Brunswick.    \"In Blakely, New Brunswick,\" I said, almost believing that I had  when I saw how they all took it in unsuspectingly.  \"I was just  eighteen and he was twenty-three.\"    \"What did he look like?\" Susette wanted to know.    \"Oh, he was very handsome.\"  I proceeded glibly to sketch my  ideal.  To tell the dreadful truth, I was enjoying myself; I  could see respect dawning in those girls' eyes, and I knew that I  had forever thrown off my reproach.  Henceforth I should be a  woman with a romantic past, faithful to the one love of her  life--a very, very different thing from an old maid who had never  had a lover.    \"He was tall and dark, with lovely, curly black hair and  brilliant, piercing eyes.  He had a splendid chin, and a fine  nose, and the most fascinating smile!\"    \"What was he?\" asked Maggie.    \"A young lawyer,\" I said, my choice of profession decided by an  enlarged crayon portrait of Mary Gillespie's deceased brother on  an easel before me.  He had been a lawyer.    \"Why didn't you marry him?\" demanded Susette.    \"We quarreled,\" I answered sadly.  \"A terribly bitter quarrel.  Oh, we were both so young and so foolish.  It was my fault.  I  vexed Cecil by flirting with another man\"--wasn't I coming on!--\"and  he was jealous and angry.  He went out West and never came  back.  I have never seen him since, and I do not even know if he  is alive.  But--but--I could never care for any other man.\"    \"Oh, how interesting!\" sighed Wilhelmina.  \"I do so love sad love  stories.  But perhaps he will come back some day yet, Miss  Holmes.\"    \"Oh, no, never now,\" I said, shaking my head.  \"He has forgotten  all about me, I dare say.  Or if he hasn't, he has never forgiven  me.\"    Mary Gillespie's Susan Jane announced tea at this moment, and I  was thankful, for my imagination was giving out, and I didn't  know what question those girls would ask next.  But I felt  already a change in the mental atmosphere surrounding me, and all  through supper I was thrilled with a secret exultation.  Repentant?  Ashamed?  Not a bit of it!  I'd have done the same  thing over again, and all I felt sorry for was that I hadn't done  it long ago.    When I got home that night Nancy looked at me wonderingly, and  said:    \"You look like a girl to-night, Miss Charlotte.\"    \"I feel like one,\" I said laughing; and I ran to my room and did  what I had never done before--wrote a second poem in the same  day.  I had to have some outlet for my feelings.  I called it \"In  Summer Days of Long Ago,\" and I worked Mary Gillespie's roses and  Cecil Fenwick's eyes into it, and made it so sad and reminiscent  and minor-musicky that I felt perfectly happy.    For the next two months all went well and merrily.  Nobody ever  said anything more to me about Cecil Fenwick, but the girls all  chattered freely to me of their little love affairs, and I became  a sort of general confidant for them.  It just warmed up the  cockles of my heart, and I began to enjoy the Sewing Circle  famously.  I got a lot of pretty new dresses and the dearest hat,  and I went everywhere I was asked and had a good time.    But there is one thing you can be perfectly sure of.  If you do  wrong you are going to be punished for it sometime, somehow and  somewhere.  My punishment was delayed for two months, and then it  descended on my head and I was crushed to the very dust.    Another new family besides the Mercers had come to Avonlea in the  spring--the Maxwells.  There were just Mr. and Mrs. Maxwell; they  were a middle-aged couple and very well off.  Mr. Maxwell had  bought the lumber mills, and they lived up at the old Spencer  place which had always been \"the\" place of Avonlea.  They lived  quietly, and Mrs. Maxwell hardly ever went anywhere because she  was delicate.  She was out when I called and I was out when she  returned my call, so that I had never met her.    It was the Sewing Circle day again--at Sarah Gardiner's this  time.  I was late; everybody else was there when I arrived, and  the minute I entered the room I knew something had happened,  although I couldn't imagine what.  Everybody looked at me in the  strangest way.  Of course, Wilhelmina Mercer was the first to set  her tongue going.    \"Oh, Miss Holmes, have you seen him yet?\" she exclaimed.    \"Seen whom?\" I said non-excitedly, getting out my thimble and  patterns.    \"Why, Cecil Fenwick.  He's here--in Avonlea--visiting his sister,  Mrs. Maxwell.\"    I suppose I did what they expected me to do.  I dropped  everything I held, and Josephine Cameron said afterwards that  Charlotte Holmes would never be paler when she was in her coffin.  If they had just known why I turned so pale!    \"It's impossible!\" I said blankly.    \"It's really true,\" said Wilhelmina, delighted at this  development, as she supposed it, of my romance.  \"I was up to see  Mrs. Maxwell last night, and I met him.\"    \"It--can't be--the same--Cecil Fenwick,\" I said faintly, because  I had to say something.    \"Oh, yes, it is.  He belongs in Blakely, New Brunswick, and he's  a lawyer, and he's been out West twenty-two years.  He's oh! so  handsome, and just as you described him, except that his hair is  quite gray.  He has never married--I asked Mrs. Maxwell--so you  see he has never forgotten you, Miss Holmes.  And, oh, I believe  everything is going to come out all right.\"    I couldn't exactly share her cheerful belief.  Everything seemed  to me to be coming out most horribly wrong.  I was so mixed up I  didn't know what to do or say.  I felt as if I were in a bad  dream--it MUST be a dream--there couldn't really be a Cecil  Fenwick!  My feelings were simply indescribable.  Fortunately  every one put my agitation down to quite a different cause, and  they very kindly left me alone to recover myself.  I shall never  forget that awful afternoon.  Right after tea I excused myself  and went home as fast as I could go.  There I shut myself up in  my room, but NOT to write poetry in my blank book.  No, indeed!  I felt in no poetical mood.    I tried to look the facts squarely in the face.  There was a  Cecil Fenwick, extraordinary as the coincidence was, and he was  here in Avonlea.  All my friends--and foes--believed that he was  the estranged lover of my youth.  If he stayed long in Avonlea,  one of two things was bound to happen.  He would hear the story I  had told about him and deny it, and I would be held up to shame  and derision for the rest of my natural life; or else he would  simply go away in ignorance, and everybody would suppose he had  forgotten me and would pity me maddeningly.  The latter  possibility was bad enough, but it wasn't to be compared to the  former; and oh, how I prayed--yes, I DID pray about it--that he  would go right away.  But Providence had other views for me.    Cecil Fenwick didn't go away.  He stayed right on in Avonlea, and  the Maxwells blossomed out socially in his honor and tried to  give him a good time.  Mrs. Maxwell gave a party for him.  I got  a card--but you may be very sure I didn't go, although Nancy  thought I was crazy not to.  Then every one else gave parties in  honor of Mr. Fenwick and I was invited and never went.  Wilhelmina Mercer came and pleaded and scolded and told me if I  avoided Mr. Fenwick like that he would think I still cherished  bitterness against him, and he wouldn't make any advances towards  a reconciliation.  Wilhelmina means well, but she hasn't a great  deal of sense.    Cecil Fenwick seemed to be a great favorite with everybody, young  and old.  He was very rich, too, and Wilhelmina declared that  half the girls were after him.    \"If it wasn't for you, Miss Holmes, I believe I'd have a try for  him myself, in spite of his gray hair and quick temper--for Mrs.  Maxwell says he has a pretty quick temper, but it's all over in a  minute,\" said Wilhelmina, half in jest and wholly in earnest.    As for me, I gave up going out at all, even to church.  I fretted  and pined and lost my appetite and never wrote a line in my blank  book.  Nancy was half frantic and insisted on dosing me with her  favorite patent pills.  I took them meekly, because it is a waste  of time and energy to oppose Nancy, but, of course, they didn't  do me any good.  My trouble was too deep-seated for pills to  cure.  If ever a woman was punished for telling a lie I was that  woman.  I stopped my subscription to the _Weekly Advocate_  because it still carried that wretched porous plaster  advertisement, and I couldn't bear to see it.  If it hadn't been  for that I would never have thought of Fenwick for a name, and  all this trouble would have been averted.    One evening, when I was moping in my room, Nancy came up.    \"There's a gentleman in the parlor asking for you, Miss  Charlotte.\"    My heart gave just one horrible bounce.    \"What--sort of a gentleman, Nancy?\" I faltered.    \"I think it's that Fenwick man that there's been such a time  about,\" said Nancy, who didn't know anything about my imaginary "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5341"],[0,"Kilmeny of the Orchard (#5)"],[1,"in the  parlour and sits up till eleven o'clock reading dime novels.\"    \"Perhaps I met Mr. Tracy,\" said Eric. \"Is he a tall man, with gray hair  and a dark, stern face?\"    \"No, he's a round, jolly fellow, is Aleck, and he stopped growing pretty  much before he'd ever begun. I reckon the man you mean is Thomas Gordon.  I seen him driving down the road too. HE won't be troubling you with  invitations up, small fear of it. The Gordons ain't sociable, to say the  least of it. No, sir! Mother, pass the biscuits to the Master.\"    \"Who was the young fellow he had with him?\" asked Eric curiously.    \"Neil--Neil Gordon.\"    \"That is a Scotchy name for such a face and eyes. I should rather have  expected Guiseppe or Angelo. The boy looks like an Italian.\"    \"Well, now, you know, Master, I reckon it's likely he does, seeing  that that's exactly what he is. You've hit the nail square on the head.  Italyun, yes, sir! Rather too much so, I'm thinking, for decent folks'  taste.\"    \"How has it happened that an Italian boy with a Scotch name is living in  a place like Lindsay?\"    \"Well, Master, it was this way. About twenty-two years ago--WAS it  twenty-two, Mother or twenty-four? Yes, it was twenty-two--'twas the  same year our Jim was born and he'd have been twenty-two if he'd lived,  poor little fellow. Well, Master, twenty-two years ago a couple of  Italian pack peddlers came along and called at the Gordon place. The  country was swarming with them then. I useter set the dog on one every  day on an average.    \"Well, these peddlers were man and wife, and the woman took sick up  there at the Gordon place, and Janet Gordon took her in and nursed her.  A baby was born the next day, and the woman died. Then the first thing  anybody knew the father skipped clean out, pack and all, and was never  seen or heard tell of afterwards. The Gordons were left with the fine  youngster to their hands. Folks advised them to send him to the Orphan  Asylum, and 'twould have been the wisest plan, but the Gordons were  never fond of taking advice. Old James Gordon was living then, Thomas  and Janet's father, and he said he would never turn a child out of his  door. He was a masterful old man and liked to be boss. Folks used to say  he had a grudge against the sun 'cause it rose and set without his  say so. Anyhow, they kept the baby. They called him Neil and had him  baptized same as any Christian child. He's always lived there. They  did well enough by him. He was sent to school and taken to church and  treated like one of themselves. Some folks think they made too much of  him. It doesn't always do with that kind, for 'what's bred in bone  is mighty apt to come out in flesh,' if 'taint kept down pretty well.  Neil's smart and a great worker, they tell me. But folks hereabouts  don't like him. They say he ain't to be trusted further'n you can see  him, if as far. It's certain he's awful hot tempered, and one time when  he was going to school he near about killed a boy he'd took a spite  to--choked him till he was black in the face and Neil had to be dragged  off.\"    \"Well now, father, you know they teased him terrible,\" protested Mrs.  Williamson. \"The poor boy had a real hard time when he went to school,  Master. The other children were always casting things up to him and  calling him names.\"    \"Oh, I daresay they tormented him a lot,\" admitted her husband. \"He's  a great hand at the fiddle and likes company. He goes to the harbour a  good deal. But they say he takes sulky spells when he hasn't a word  to throw to a dog. 'Twouldn't be any wonder, living with the Gordons.  They're all as queer as Dick's hat-band.\"    \"Father, you shouldn't talk so about your neighbours,\" said his wife  rebukingly.    \"Well now, Mother, you know they are, if you'd only speak up honest. But  you're like old Aunt Nancy Scott, you never say anything uncharitable  except in the way of business. You know the Gordons ain't like other  people and never were and never will be. They're about the only queer  folks we have in Lindsay, Master, except old Peter Cook, who keeps  twenty-five cats. Lord, Master, think of it! What chanct would a poor  mouse have? None of the rest of us are queer, leastwise, we hain't found  it out if we are. But, then, we're mighty uninteresting, I'm bound to  admit that.\"    \"Where do the Gordons live?\" asked Eric, who had grown used to holding  fast to a given point of inquiry through all the bewildering mazes of  old Robert's conversation.    \"Away up yander, half a mile in from Radnor road, with a thick spruce  wood atween them and all the rest of the world. They never go away  anywheres, except to church--they never miss that--and nobody goes  there. There's just old Thomas, and his sister Janet, and a niece of  theirs, and this here Neil we've been talking about. They're a queer,  dour, cranky lot, and I WILL say it, Mother. There, give your old man a  cup of tea and never mind the way his tongue runs on. Speaking of tea,  do you know Mrs. Adam Palmer and Mrs. Jim Martin took tea together at  Foster Reid's last Wednesday afternoon?\"    \"No, why, I thought they were on bad terms,\" said Mrs. Williamson,  betraying a little feminine curiosity.    \"So they are, so they are. But they both happened to visit Mrs. Foster  the same afternoon and neither would leave because that would be  knuckling down to the other. So they stuck it out, on opposite sides  of the parlour. Mrs. Foster says she never spent such an uncomfortable  afternoon in all her life before. She would talk a spell to one and then  t'other. And they kept talking TO Mrs. Foster and AT each other. Mrs.  Foster says she really thought she'd have to keep them all night, for  neither would start to go home afore the other. Finally Jim Martin came  in to look for his wife, 'cause he thought she must have got stuck  in the marsh, and that solved the problem. Master, you ain't eating  anything. Don't mind my stopping; I was at it half an hour afore you  come, and anyway I'm in a hurry. My hired boy went home to-day. He heard  the rooster crow at twelve last night and he's gone home to see which of  his family is dead. He knows one of 'em is. He heard a rooster crow in  the middle of the night onct afore and the next day he got word that his  second cousin down at Souris was dead. Mother, if the Master don't want  any more tea, ain't there some cream for Timothy?\"        CHAPTER V. A PHANTOM OF DELIGHT    Shortly before sunset that evening Eric went for a walk. When he did not  go to the shore he liked to indulge in long tramps through the Lindsay  fields and woods, in the mellowness of \"the sweet 'o the year.\" Most of  the Lindsay houses were built along the main road, which ran parallel to  the shore, or about the stores at \"The Corner.\" The farms ran back from  them into solitudes of woods and pasture lands.    Eric struck southwest from the Williamson homestead, in a direction  he had not hitherto explored, and walked briskly along, enjoying the  witchery of the season all about him in earth and air and sky. He felt  it and loved it and yielded to it, as anyone of clean life and sane  pulses must do.    The spruce wood in which he presently found himself was smitten through  with arrows of ruby light from the setting sun. He went through it,  walking up a long, purple aisle where the wood-floor was brown and  elastic under his feet, and came out beyond it on a scene which  surprised him.    No house was in sight, but he found himself looking into an orchard; an  old orchard, evidently long neglected and forsaken. But an orchard dies  hard; and this one, which must have been a very delightful spot once,  was delightful still, none the less so for the air of gentle melancholy  which seemed to pervade it, the melancholy which invests all places that  have once been the scenes of joy and pleasure and young life, and are so  no longer, places where hearts have throbbed, and pulses thrilled, and  eyes brightened, and merry voices echoed. The ghosts of these things  seem to linger in their old haunts through many empty years.    The orchard was large and long, enclosed in a tumbledown old fence of  longers bleached to a silvery gray in the suns of many lost summers. At  regular intervals along the fence were tall, gnarled fir trees, and an  evening wind, sweeter than that which blew over the beds of spice from  Lebanon, was singing in their tops, an earth-old song with power to  carry the soul back to the dawn of time.    Eastward, a thick fir wood grew, beginning with tiny treelets just  feathering from the grass, and grading up therefrom to the tall veterans  of the mid-grove, unbrokenly and evenly, giving the effect of a solid,  sloping green wall, so beautifully compact that it looked as if it had  been clipped into its velvet surface by art.    Most of the orchard was grown over lushly with grass; but at the end  where Eric stood there was a square, treeless place which had evidently  once served as a homestead garden. Old paths were still visible,  bordered by stones and large pebbles. There were two clumps of lilac  trees; one blossoming in royal purple, the other in white. Between  them was a bed ablow with the starry spikes of June lilies. Their  penetrating, haunting fragrance distilled on the dewy air in every soft  puff of wind. Along the fence rosebushes grew, but it was as yet too  early in the season for roses.    Beyond was the orchard proper, three long rows of trees with green  avenues between, each tree standing in a wonderful blow of pink and  white.    The charm of the place took sudden possession of Eric as nothing had  ever done before. He was not given to romantic fancies; but the orchard  laid hold of him subtly and drew him to itself, and he was never to be  quite his own man again. He went into it over one of the broken panels  of fence, and so, unknowing, went forward to meet all that life held for  him.    He walked the length of the orchard's"]]]
