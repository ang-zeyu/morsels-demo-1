'By Jove,' I said, for I am interested in this heredity stuff, 'perhaps  the thing is going to be a regular family tradition, like you read  about in books--a sort of Curse of the Mannering-Phippses, as it were.  Perhaps each head of the family's going to marry into vaudeville for  ever and ever. Unto the what-d'you-call-it generation, don't you know?'    'Please do not be quite idiotic, Bertie. There is one head of the  family who is certainly not going to do it, and that is Gussie. And you  are going to America to stop him.'    'Yes, but why me?'    'Why you? You are too vexing, Bertie. Have you no sort of feeling for  the family? You are too lazy to try to be a credit to yourself, but at  least you can exert yourself to prevent Gussie's disgracing us. You are  going to America because you are Gussie's cousin, because you have  always been his closest friend, because you are the only one of the  family who has absolutely nothing to occupy his time except golf and  night clubs.'    'I play a lot of auction.'    'And as you say, idiotic gambling in low dens. If you require another  reason, you are going because I ask you as a personal favour.'    What she meant was that, if I refused, she would exert the full bent of  her natural genius to make life a Hades for me. She held me with her  glittering eye. I have never met anyone who can give a better imitation  of the Ancient Mariner.    'So you will start at once, won't you, Bertie?'    I didn't hesitate.    'Rather!' I said. 'Of course I will'    Jeeves came in with the tea.    'Jeeves,' I said, 'we start for America on Saturday.'    'Very good, sir,' he said; 'which suit will you wear?'    New York is a large city conveniently situated on the edge of America,  so that you step off the liner right on to it without an effort. You  can't lose your way. You go out of a barn and down some stairs, and  there you are, right in among it. The only possible objection any  reasonable chappie could find to the place is that they loose you into  it from the boat at such an ungodly hour.    I left Jeeves to get my baggage safely past an aggregation of  suspicious-minded pirates who were digging for buried treasures among  my new shirts, and drove to Gussie's hotel, where I requested the squad  of gentlemanly clerks behind the desk to produce him.    That's where I got my first shock. He wasn't there. I pleaded with them  to think again, and they thought again, but it was no good. No Augustus  Mannering-Phipps on the premises.    I admit I was hard hit. There I was alone in a strange city and no  signs of Gussie. What was the next step? I am never one of the master  minds in the early morning; the old bean doesn't somehow seem to get  into its stride till pretty late in the p.m.'s, and I couldn't think  what to do. However, some instinct took me through a door at the back  of the lobby, and I found myself in a large room with an enormous  picture stretching across the whole of one wall, and under the picture  a counter, and behind the counter divers chappies in white, serving  drinks. They have barmen, don't you know, in New York, not barmaids.  Rum idea!    I put myself unreservedly into the hands of one of the white chappies.  He was a friendly soul, and I told him the whole state of affairs. I  asked him what he thought would meet the case.    He said that in a situation of that sort he usually prescribed a  'lightning whizzer', an invention of his own. He said this was what  rabbits trained on when they were matched against grizzly bears, and  there was only one instance on record of the bear having lasted three  rounds. So I tried a couple, and, by Jove! the man was perfectly right.  As I drained the second a great load seemed to fall from my heart, and  I went out in quite a braced way to have a look at the city.    I was surprised to find the streets quite full. People were bustling  along as if it were some reasonable hour and not the grey dawn. In the  tramcars they were absolutely standing on each other's necks. Going to  business or something, I take it. Wonderful johnnies!    The odd part of it was that after the first shock of seeing all this  frightful energy the thing didn't seem so strange. I've spoken to  fellows since who have been to New York, and they tell me they found it  just the same. Apparently there's something in the air, either the  ozone or the phosphates or something, which makes you sit up and take  notice. A kind of zip, as it were. A sort of bally freedom, if you know  what I mean, that gets into your blood and bucks you up, and makes you  feel that--        _God's in His Heaven:      All's right with the world_,    and you don't care if you've got odd socks on. I can't express it  better than by saying that the thought uppermost in my mind, as I  walked about the place they call Times Square, was that there were  three thousand miles of deep water between me and my Aunt Agatha.    It's a funny thing about looking for things. If you hunt for a needle  in a haystack you don't find it. If you don't give a darn whether you  ever see the needle or not it runs into you the first time you lean  against the stack. By the time I had strolled up and down once or  twice, seeing the sights and letting the white chappie's corrective  permeate my system, I was feeling that I wouldn't care if Gussie and I  never met again, and I'm dashed if I didn't suddenly catch sight of the  old lad, as large as life, just turning in at a doorway down the  street.    I called after him, but he didn't hear me, so I legged it in pursuit  and caught him going into an office on the first floor. The name on the  door was Abe Riesbitter, Vaudeville Agent, and from the other side of  the door came the sound of many voices.    He turned and stared at me.    'Bertie! What on earth are you doing? Where have you sprung from? When  did you arrive?'    'Landed this morning. I went round to your hotel, but they said you  weren't there. They had never heard of you.'    'I've changed my name. I call myself George Wilson.'    'Why on earth?'    'Well, you try calling yourself Augustus Mannering-Phipps over here,  and see how it strikes you. You feel a perfect ass. I don't know what  it is about America, but the broad fact is that it's not a place where  you can call yourself Augustus Mannering-Phipps. And there's another  reason. I'll tell you later. Bertie, I've fallen in love with the  dearest girl in the world.'    The poor old nut looked at me in such a deuced cat-like way, standing  with his mouth open, waiting to be congratulated, that I simply hadn't  the heart to tell him that I knew all about that already, and had come  over to the country for the express purpose of laying him a stymie.    So I congratulated him.    'Thanks awfully, old man,' he said. 'It's a bit premature, but I fancy  it's going to be all right. Come along in here, and I'll tell you about  it.'    'What do you want in this place? It looks a rummy spot.'    'Oh, that's part of the story. I'll tell you the whole thing.'    We opened the door marked 'Waiting Room'. I never saw such a crowded  place in my life. The room was packed till the walls bulged.    Gussie explained.    'Pros,' he said, 'music-hall artistes, you know, waiting to see old Abe  Riesbitter. This is September the first, vaudeville's opening day. The  early fall,' said Gussie, who is a bit of a poet in his way, 'is  vaudeville's springtime. All over the country, as August wanes,  sparkling comediennes burst into bloom, the sap stirs in the veins of  tramp cyclists, and last year's contortionists, waking from their  summer sleep, tie themselves tentatively into knots. What I mean is,  this is the beginning of the new season, and everybody's out hunting  for bookings.'    'But what do you want here?'    'Oh, I've just got to see Abe about something. If you see a fat man  with about fifty-seven chins come out of that door there grab him, for  that'll be Abe. He's one of those fellows who advertise each step up  they take in the world by growing another chin. I'm told that way back  in the nineties he only had two. If you do grab Abe, remember that he  knows me as George Wilson.'    'You said that you were going to explain that George Wilson business to  me, Gussie, old man.'    'Well, it's this way--'    At this juncture dear old Gussie broke off short, rose from his seat,  and sprang with indescribable vim at an extraordinarily stout chappie  who had suddenly appeared. There was the deuce of a rush for him, but  Gussie had got away to a good start, and the rest of the singers,  dancers, jugglers, acrobats, and refined sketch teams seemed to  recognize that he had won the trick, for they ebbed back into their  places again, and Gussie and I went into the inner room.    Mr Riesbitter lit a cigar, and looked at us solemnly over his zareba of  chins.    'Now, let me tell ya something,' he said to Gussie. 'You lizzun t' me.'    Gussie registered respectful attention. Mr Riesbitter mused for a  moment and shelled the cuspidor with indirect fire over the edge of the  desk.    'Lizzun t' me,' he said again. 'I seen you rehearse, as I promised Miss  Denison I would. You ain't bad for an amateur. You gotta lot to learn,  but it's in you. What it comes to is that I can fix you up in the  four-a-day, if you'll take thirty-five per. I can't do better than  that, and I wouldn't have done that if the little lady hadn't of kep'  after me. Take it or leave it. What do you say?'    'I'll take it,' said Gussie, huskily. 'Thank you.'    In the passage outside, Gussie gurgled with joy and slapped me on the  back. 'Bertie, old man, it's all right. I'm the happiest man in New  York.'    'Now what?'    'Well, you see, as I was telling you when Abe came in, Ray's father  used to be in the profession. He was before our time, but I remember  hearing about him--Joe Danby. He used to be well known in London before  he came over to America."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7477"],[0,"The Book of Wonder (#5)"],[1," was the little disreputable god who cares nothing  for etiquette and will answer prayers that are refused by all the  respectable idols. And whether the view of him, at last, excited  Pombo's eagerness, or whether his need was greater than he could bear  that it drove him so swiftly downstairs, or whether, as is most likely,  he ran too fast past the beast, I do not know, and it does not matter  to Pombo; but at any rate he could not stop, as he had designed, in  attitude of prayer at the feet of Duth, but ran on past him down the  narrowing steps, clutching at smooth, bare rocks till he fell from the  World as, when our hearts miss a beat, we fall in dreams and wake up  with a dreadful jolt; but there was no waking up for Pombo, who still  fell on towards the incurious stars, and his fate is even one with the  fate of Slith.        THE LOOT OF BOMBASHARNA      Things had grown too hot for Shard, captain of pirates, on all the  seas that he knew. The ports of Spain were closed to him; they knew  him in San Domingo; men winked in Syracuse when he went by; the two  Kings of the Sicilies never smiled within an hour of speaking of him;  there were huge rewards for his head in every capital city, with  pictures of it for identification--_and all the pictures were  unflattering_. Therefore Captain Shard decided that the time had come  to tell his men the secret.    Riding off Teneriffe one night, he called them all together. He  generously admitted that there were things in the past that might  require explanation: the crowns that the Princes of Aragon had sent to  their nephews the Kings of the two Americas had certainly never  reached their Most Sacred Majesties. Where, men might ask, were the  eyes of Captain Stobbud? Who had been burning towns on the Patagonian  seaboard? Why should such a ship as theirs choose pearls for cargo?  Why so much blood on the decks and so many guns? And where was the  _Nancy_, the _Lark_, or the _Margaret Belle_? Such questions as these,  he urged, might be asked by the inquisitive, and if counsel for the  defence should happen to be a fool, and unacquainted with the ways of  the sea, they might become involved in troublesome legal formulae. And  Bloody Bill, as they rudely called Mr. Gagg, a member of the crew,  looked up at the sky, and said that it was a windy night and looked  like hanging. And some of those present thoughtfully stroked their  necks while Captain Shard unfolded to them his plan. He said the time  was come to quit the _Desperate Lark_, for she was too well known to  the navies of four kingdoms, and a fifth was getting to know her, and  others had suspicions. (More cutters than even Captain Shard suspected  were already looking for her jolly black flag with its neat  skull-and-crossbones in yellow.) There was a little archipelago that  he knew of on the wrong side of the Sargasso Sea; there were about  thirty islands there, bare, ordinary islands, but one of them floated.  He had noticed it years ago, and had gone ashore and never told a  soul, but had quietly anchored it with the anchor of his ship to the  bottom of the sea, which just there was profoundly deep, and had made  the thing the secret of his life, determining to marry and settle down  there if it ever became impossible to earn his livelihood in the usual  way at sea. When first he saw it, it was drifting slowly, with the  wind in the tops of the trees; but if the cable had not rusted away,  it should be still where he left it, and they would make a rudder and  hollow out cabins below, and at night they would hoist sails to the  trunks of the trees and sail wherever they liked.    And all the pirates cheered, for they wanted to set their feet on land  again somewhere where the hangman would not come and jerk them off it  at once; and bold men though they were, it was a strain seeing so many  lights coming their way at night. Even then...! But it swerved away  again and was lost in the mist.    And Captain Shard said that they would need to get provisions first,  and he, for one, intended to marry before he settled down; and so they  should have one more fight before they left the ship, and sack the  sea-coast city of Bombasharna and take from it provisions for several  years, while he himself would marry the Queen of the South. And again  the pirates cheered, for often they had seen seacoast Bombasharna, and  had always envied its opulence from the sea.    So they set all sail, and often altered their course, and dodged and  fled from strange lights till dawn appeared, and all day long fled  southwards. And by evening they saw the silver spires of slender  Bombasharna, a city that was the glory of the coast. And in the midst  of it, far away though they were, they saw the palace of the Queen of  the South; and it was so full of windows all looking toward the sea,  and they were so full of light, both from the sunset that was fading  upon the water and from candles that maids were lighting one by one,  that it looked far off like a pearl, shimmering still in its haliotis  shell, still wet from the sea.    So Captain Shard and his pirates saw it, at evening over the water,  and thought of rumours that said that Bombasharna was the loveliest  city of the coasts of the world, and that its palace was lovelier even  than Bombasharna; but for the Queen of the South rumour had no  comparison. Then night came down and hid the silver spires, and Shard  slipped on through the gathering darkness until by midnight the  piratic ship lay under the seaward battlements.    And at the hour when sick men mostly die, and sentries on lonely  ramparts stand to arms, exactly half-an-hour before dawn, Shard, with  two rowing boats and half his crew, with craftily muffled oars, landed  below the battlements. They were through the gateway of the palace  itself before the alarm was sounded, and as soon as they heard the  alarm Shard's gunners at sea opened upon the town, and before the  sleepy soldiery of Bombasharna knew whether the danger was from the  land or the sea, Shard had successfully captured the Queen of the  South. They would have looted all day that silver sea-coast city, but  there appeared with dawn suspicious topsails just along the horizon.  Therefore the captain with his Queen went down to the shore at once  and hastily re-embarked and sailed away with what loot they had  hurriedly got, and with fewer men, for they had to fight a good deal to  get back to the boat. They cursed all day the interference of those  ominous ships which steadily grew nearer. There were six ships at  first, and that night they slipped away from all but two; but all the  next day those two were still in sight, and each of them had more guns  than the _Desperate Lark_. All the next night Shard dodged about the  sea, but the two ships separated and one kept him in sight, and the  next morning it was alone with Shard on the sea, and his archipelago  was just in sight, the secret of his life.    And Shard saw he must fight, and a bad fight it was, and yet it suited  Shard's purpose, for he had more merry men when the fight began than  he needed for his island. And they got it over before any other ship  came up; and Shard put all adverse evidence out of the way, and came  that night to the islands near the Sargasso Sea.    Long before it was light the survivors of the crew were peering at the  sea, and when dawn came there was the island, no bigger than two  ships, straining hard at its anchor, with the wind in the tops of the  trees.    And then they landed and dug cabins below and raised the anchor out of  the deep sea, and soon they made the island what they called  shipshape. But the _Desperate Lark_ they sent away empty under full  sail to sea, where more nations than Shard suspected were watching for  her, and where she was presently captured by an admiral of Spain, who,  when he found none of that famous crew on board to hang by the neck  from the yard-arm, grew ill through disappointment.    And Shard on his island offered the Queen of the South the choicest of  the old wines of Provence, and for adornment gave her Indian jewels  looted from galleons with treasure for Madrid, and spread a table  where she dined in the sun, while in some cabin below he bade the  least coarse of his mariners sing; yet always she was morose and moody  towards him, and often at evening he was heard to say that he wished  he knew more about the ways of Queens. So they lived for years, the  pirates mostly gambling and drinking below, Captain Shard trying to  please the Queen of the South, and she never wholly forgetting  Bombasharna. When they needed new provisions they hoisted sails on the  trees, and as long as no ship came in sight they scudded before the  wind, with the water rippling over the beach of the island; but as  soon as they sighted a ship the sails came down, and they became an  ordinary uncharted rock.    They mostly moved by night; sometimes they hovered off sea-coast towns  as of old, sometimes they boldly entered river-mouths, and even  attached themselves for a while to the mainland, whence they would  plunder the neighbourhood and escape again to sea. And if a ship was  wrecked on their island of a night they said it was all to the good.  They grew very crafty in seamanship, and cunning in what they did, for  they knew that any news of the _Desperate Lark_'s old crew would bring  hangmen from the interior running down to every port.    And no one is known to have found them out or to have annexed their  island; but a rumour arose and passed from port to port and every  place where sailors meet together, and even survives to this day, of a  dangerous uncharted rock anywhere between Plymouth and the Horn, which  would suddenly rise in the safest track of ships, and upon which  vessels were supposed to have been wrecked, leaving, strangely enough,  no evidence of their doom. There was a little speculation about it at  first, till it"]]]
