If we do not see in them the saga  and epic, how shall we tell of them?    England    \"And then we used to have sausages,\" said the Sergeant.    \"And mashed?\" said the Private.    \"Yes,\" said the Sergeant, \"and beer. And then we used to go home.  It was grand in the evenings. We used to go along a lane that was full  of them wild roses. And then we come to the road where the houses  were. They all had their bit of a garden, every house.\"    \"Nice, I calls it, a garden,\" the Private said.    \"Yes,\" said the Sergeant, \"they all had their garden. It came right  down to the road. Wooden palings: none of that there wire.\"    \"I hates wire,\" said the Private.    \"They didn't have none of it,\" the N. C. O. went on. \"The gardens  came right down to the road, looking lovely. Old Billy Weeks he had  them tall pale-blue flowers in his garden nearly as high as a man.\"    \"Hollyhocks?\" said the Private.    \"No, they wasn't hollyhocks. Lovely they were. We used to stop and  look at them, going by every evening. He had a path up the middle of  his garden paved with red tiles, Billy Weeks had; and these tall blue  flowers growing the whole way along it, both sides like. They was a  wonder. Twenty gardens there must have been, counting them all; but  none to touch Billy Weeks with his pale-blue flowers. There was an old  windmill away to the left. Then there were the swifts sailing by  overhead and screeching: just about as high again as the houses. Lord,  how them birds did fly. And there was the other young fellows, what  were not out walking, standing about by the roadside, just doing  nothing at all. One of them had a flute: Jim Booker, he was. Those  were great days. The bats used to come out, flutter, flutter, flutter;  and then there'd be a star or two; and the smoke from the chimneys  going all grey; and a little cold wind going up and down like the  bats; and all the colour going out of things; and the woods looking  all strange, and a wonderful quiet in them, and a mist coming up from  the stream. It's a queer time that. It's always about that time, the  way I see it: the end of the evening in the long days, and a star or  two, and me and my girl going home.    \"Wouldn't you like to talk about things for a bit the way you  remember them?\"    \"Oh, no, Sergeant,\" said the other, \"you go on. You do bring it all  back so.\"    \"I used to bring her home,\" the Sergeant said, \"to her father's  house. Her father was keeper there, and they had a house in the wood.  A fine house with queer old tiles on it, and a lot of large friendly  dogs. I knew them all by name, same as they knew me. I used to walk  home then along the side of the wood. The owls would be about; you  could hear them yelling. They'd float out of the wood like, sometimes:  all large and white.\"    \"I knows them,\" said the Private.    \"I saw a fox once so close I could nearly touch him, walking like he  was on velvet. He just slipped out of the wood.\"    \"Cunning old brute,\" said the Private.    \"That's the time to be out,\" said the Sergeant. \"Ten o'clock on a  summer's night, and the night full of noises, not many of them, but  what there is, strange, and coming from a great way off, through the  quiet, with nothing to stop them. Dogs barking, owls hooting, an old  cart; and then just once a sound that you couldn't account for at all,  not anyhow. I've heard sounds on nights like that that nobody 'ud  think you'd heard, nothing like the flute that young Booker had,  nothing like anything on earth.\"    \"I know,\" said the Private.    \"I never told any one before, because they wouldn't believe you. But  it doesn't matter now. There'd be a light in the window to guide me  when I got home. I'd walk up through the flowers of our garden. We had  a lovely garden. Wonderful white and strange the flowers looked of a  nighttime.\"    \"You bring it all back wonderful,\" said the Private.    \"It's a great thing to have lived,\" said the Sergeant.    \"Yes, Sergeant,\" said the other, \"I wouldn't have missed it, not  for anything.\"    For five days the barrage had rained down behind them: they were  utterly cut off and had no hope of rescue: their food was done, and  they did not know where they were.          Shells      When the aeroplanes are home and the sunset has flared away, and it is  cold, and night comes down over France, you notice the guns more than  you do by day, or else they are actually more active then, I do not  know which it is.    It is then as though a herd of giants, things of enormous height, came  out from lairs in the earth and began to play with the hills. It is as  though they picked up the tops of the hills in their hands and then  let them drop rather slowly. It is exactly like hills falling. You see  the flashes all along the sky, and then that lumping thump as though  the top of the hill had been let drop, not all in one piece, but  crumbled a little as it would drop from your hands if you were three  hundred feet high and were fooling about in the night, spoiling what  it had taken so long to make. That is heavy stuff bursting, a little  way off.    If you are anywhere near a shell that is bursting, you can hear in it  a curious metallic ring. That applies to the shells of either side,  provided that you are near enough, though usually of course it is the  hostile shell and not your own that you are nearest to, and so one  distinguishes them. It is curious, after such a colossal event as this  explosion must be in the life of a bar of steel, that anything should  remain at all of the old bell-like voice of the metal, but it appears  to, if you listen attentively; it is perhaps its last remonstrance  before leaving its shape and going back to rust in the earth again for  ages.    Another of the voices of the night is the whine the shell makes in  coming; it is not unlike the cry the hyena utters as soon as it's dark  in Africa: \"How nice traveller would taste,\" the hyena seems to say,  and \"I want dead White Man.\" It is the rising note of the shell as  it comes nearer, and its dying away when it has gone over, that make  it reminiscent of the hyena's method of diction. If it is not going  over then it has something quite different to say. It begins the same  as the other, it comes up, talking of the back areas with the same  long whine as the other. I have heard old hands say \"That one is  going well over.\" \"Whee-oo,\" says the shell; but just where the  \"oo\" should be long drawn out and turn into the hyena's final  syllable, it says something quite different. \"Zarp,\" it says. That  is bad. Those are the shells that are looking for you.    And then of course there is the whizz-bang coming from close, along  his flat trajectory: he has little to say, but comes like a sudden  wind, and all that he has to do is done and over at once.    And then there is the gas shell, who goes over gurgling gluttonously,  probably in big herds, putting down a barrage. It is the liquid inside  that gurgles before it is turned to gas by the mild explosion; that is  the explanation of it; yet that does not prevent one picturing a tribe  of cannibals who have winded some nice juicy men and are smacking  their chops and dribbling in anticipation.    And a wonderful thing to see, even in those wonderful nights, is our  thermite bursting over the heads of the Germans. The shell breaks into  a shower of golden rain; one cannot judge easily at night how high  from the ground it breaks, but about as high as the tops of trees seen  at a hundred yards. It spreads out evenly all round and rains down  slowly; it is a bad shower to be out in, and for a long time after it  has fallen, the sodden grass of winter, and the mud and old bones  beneath it, burn quietly in a circle. On such a night as this, and in  such showers, the flying pigs will go over, which take two men to  carry each of them; they go over and root right down to the German  dugout, where the German has come in out of the golden rain, and they  fling it all up in the air.    These are such nights as Scheherazade with all her versatility never  dreamed of; or if such nightmares came she certainly never told of  them, or her august master, the Sultan, light of the age, would have  had her at once beheaded; and his people would have deemed that he did  well. It has been reserved for a modern autocrat to dream such a  nightmare, driven to it perhaps by the tales of a white-whiskered  Scheherazade, the Lord of the Kiel Canal; and being an autocrat he has  made the nightmare a reality for the world. But the nightmare is  stronger than its master, and grows mightier every night; and the  All-Highest War Lord learns that there are powers in Hell that are  easily summoned by the rulers of earth, but that go not easily home.          Two Degrees of Envy      It was night in the front line and no moon, or the moon was hidden.  There was a strafe going on. The Tok Emmas were angry. And the  artillery on both sides were looking for the Tok Emmas.    Tok Emma, I may explain for the blessed dwellers in whatever far happy  island there be that has not heard of these things, is the crude  language of Mars. He has not time to speak of a trunk mortar battery,  for he is always in a hurry, and so he calls them T. M.'s. But Bellona  might not hear him saying T. M., for all the din that she makes: might  think that he said D. N; and so he calls it Tok Emma. Ak, Beer, C,  Don: this is the alphabet of Mars.    And the huge minnies were throwing old limbs out of No Man's Land into  the frontline trench, and shells were rasping down through the air  that seemed to resist them until it was torn to pieces: they burst and  showers of mud came down from heaven. Aimlessly, as it seemed, shells  were bursting now and then in the air, with a flash intensely red: the  smell of them was drifting down the trenches.    In the middle of all this Bert Butterworth was hit. \"Only in the  foot,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/572"],[0,"The Great Big Treasury of Beatrix Potter (#5)"],[1,"anxiously at Lucie.    Her print gown was tucked up, and  she was wearing a large apron over  her striped petticoat. Her little black  nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and  her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and  underneath her cap-where Lucie  had yellow curls-that little person  had PRICKLES!    \"Who are you?\" said Lucie. \"Have  you seen my pocket-handkins?\"      The little person made a bob-  curtsey--\"Oh yes, if you please'm; my  name is Mrs. Tiggy-winkle; oh yes if  you please'm, I'm an excellent clear-  starcher!\" And she took something  out of the clothesbasket, and spread it  on the ironing-blanket.    \"What's that thing?\" said Lucie-  \"that's not my pocket-handkin?\"    \"Oh no, if you please'm; that's a  little scarlet waist-coat belonging to  Cock Robin!\"    And she ironed it and folded it, and  put it on one side.    Then she took something else off a  clothes-horse--\"That isn't my pinny?\"  said Lucie.    \"Oh no, if you please'm; that's a  damask table-cloth belonging to  Jenny Wren; look how it's stained with  currant wine! It's very bad to wash!\"  said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.    Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's nose went  sniffle sniffle snuffle, and her eyes  went twinkle twinkle; and she fetched  another hot iron from the fire.      \"There's one of my pocket-  handkins!\" cried Lucie--\"and there's  my pinny!\"    Mrs. Tiggy-winkle ironed it, and  goffered it, and shook out the frills.    \"Oh that IS lovely!\" said Lucie.    \"And what are those long yellow  things with fingers like gloves?\"    \"Oh that's a pair of stockings  belonging to Sally Henny-penny--look  how she's worn the heels out with  scratching in the yard! She'll very soon  go barefoot!\" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.    \"Why, there's another hankersniff--  but it isn't mine; it's red?\"    \"Oh no, if you please'm; that one  belongs to old Mrs. Rabbit; and it DID  so smell of onions! I've had to wash it  separately, I can't get out that smell.\"    \"There's another one of mine,\" said Lucie.      \"What are those funny little white things?\"    \"That's a pair of mittens belonging  to Tabby Kitten; I only have to iron  them; she washes them herself.\"    \"There's my last pocket-handkin!\"  said Lucie.    \"And what are you dipping into the  basin of starch?\"    \"They're little dicky shirt-fronts  belonging to Tom Titmouse--most  terrible particular!\" said Mrs. Tiggy-  winkle. \"Now I've finished my ironing;  I'm going to air some clothes.\"    \"What are these dear soft fluffy  things?\" said Lucie.    \"Oh those are woolly coats  belonging to the little lambs at  Skelghyl.\"    \"Will their jackets take off?\" asked  Lucie.    \"Oh yes, if you please'm; look at the  sheep-mark on the shoulder. And  here's one marked for Gatesgarth,  and three that come from Little-town.  They're ALWAYS marked at washing!\"  said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.      And she hung up all sorts and sizes  of clothes--small brown coats of  mice; and one velvety black moleskin  waist-coat; and a red tail-coat with  no tail belonging to Squirrel Nutkin;  and a very much shrunk blue jacket  belonging to Peter Rabbit; and a  petticoat, not marked, that had gone  lost in the washing--and at last the  basket was empty!    Then Mrs. Tiggy-winkle made  tea--a cup for herself and a cup for  Lucie. They sat before the fire on a  bench and looked sideways at one  another. Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's hand,  holding the tea-cup, was very very  brown, and very very wrinkly with the  soap-suds; and all through her gown  and her cap, there were HAIRPINS  sticking wrong end out; so that Lucie  didn't like to sit too near her.    When they had finished tea, they  tied up the clothes in bundles; and  Lucie's pocket-handkerchiefs were  folded up inside her clean pinny, and  fastened with a silver safety-pin.      And then they made up the fire  with turf, and came out and locked  the door, and hid the key under the  door-sill.    Then away down the hill trotted  Lucie and Mrs. Tiggy-winkle with the  bundles of clothes!    All the way down the path little  animals came out of the fern to meet  them; the very first that they met  were Peter Rabbit and Benjamin  Bunny!    And she gave them their nice clean  clothes; and all the little animals and  birds were so very much obliged to  dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.    So that at the bottom of the hill  when they came to the stile, there was  nothing left to carry except Lucie's  one little bundle.      Lucie scrambled up the stile with  the bundle in her hand; and then she  turned to say \"Good-night,\" and to  thank the washer-woman.--But what  a VERY odd thing! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle  had not waited either for thanks or  for the washing bill!    She was running running running  up the hill--and where was her white  frilled cap? and her shawl? and her  gown-and her petticoat?    And HOW small she had grown--  and HOW brown--and covered with  PRICKLES!    Why! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle was  nothing but a HEDGEHOG!   * * * * * *    (Now some people say that little Lucie  had been asleep upon the stile--but then  how could she have found three clean  pocket-handkins and a pinny, pinned with a  silver safety-pin?    And besides--I have seen that door into  the back of the hill called Cat Bells--and  besides _I_ am very well acquainted with dear  Mrs. Tiggy-winkle!)          THE PIE AND  THE PATTY-PAN               Pussy-cat sits by the fire--how should she be fair?       In walks the little dog--says \"Pussy are you there?       How do you do Mistress Pussy? Mistress Pussy, how            do you do?\"       \"I thank you kindly, little dog, I fare as well as you!\"                                          [Old Rhyme]        Once upon a time there was a  Pussy-cat called Ribby, who invited a  little dog called Duchess to tea.    \"Come in good time, my dear  Duchess,\" said Ribby's letter, \"and we  will have something so very nice. I am  baking it in a pie-dish--a pie-dish  with a pink rim. You never tasted  anything so good! And YOU shall eat it  all! _I_ will eat muffins, my dear  Duchess!\" wrote Ribby.    \"I will come very punctually, my  dear Ribby,\" wrote Duchess; and then  at the end she added--\"I hope it isn't  mouse?\"    And then she thought that did not  look quite polite; so she scratched out  \"isn't mouse\" and changed it to \"I  hope it will be fine,\" and she gave her  letter to the postman.    But she thought a great deal about  Ribby's pie, and she read Ribby's letter  over and over again.      \"I am dreadfully afraid it WILL be  mouse!\" said Duchess to herself--\"I  really couldn't, COULDN'T eat mouse  pie. And I shall have to eat it, because  it is a party. And MY pie was going to  be veal and ham. A pink and white  pie-dish! and so is mine; just like  Ribby's dishes; they were both bought  at Tabitha Twitchit's.\"    Duchess went into her larder and took  the pie off a shelf and looked at it.    \"Oh what a good idea! Why  shouldn't I rush along and put my pie  into Ribby's oven when Ribby isn't  there?\"    Ribby in the meantime had received  Duchess's answer, and as soon as she  was sure that the little dog would  come--she popped HER pie into the  oven. There were two ovens, one  above the other; some other knobs  and handles were only ornamental  and not intended to open. Ribby put  the pie into the lower oven; the door  was very stiff.    \"The top oven bakes too quickly,\"  said Ribby to herself.      Ribby put on some coal and swept  up the hearth. Then she went out  with a can to the well, for water to fill  up the kettle.    Then she began to set the room in  order, for it was the sitting-room as  well as the kitchen.    When Ribby had laid the table she  went out down the field to the farm,  to fetch milk and butter.    When she came back, she peeped  into the bottom oven; the pie looked  very comfortable.    Ribby put on her shawl and bonnet  and went out again with a basket, to  the village shop to buy a packet of tea,  a pound of lump sugar, and a pot of  marmalade.    And just at the same time, Duchess  came out of HER house, at the other  end of the village.    Ribby met Duchess half-way down  the street, also carrying a basket,  covered with a cloth. They only  bowed to one another; they did not  speak, because they were going to  have a party.      As soon as Duchess had got round  the corner out of sight--she simply  ran! Straight away to Ribby's house!    Ribby went into the shop and  bought what she required, and came  out, after a pleasant gossip with  Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.    Ribby went on to Timothy Baker's  and bought the muffins. Then she  went home.    There seemed to be a sort of  scuffling noise in the back passage, as  she was coming in at the front door.  But there was nobody there.    Duchess in the meantime, had  slipped out at the back door.    \"It is a very odd thing that Ribby's  pie was NOT in the oven when I put  mine in! And I can't find it anywhere;  I have looked all over the house. I put  MY pie into a nice hot oven at the top.  I could not turn any of the other  handles; I think that they are all  shams,\" said Duchess, \"but I wish I  could have removed the pie made of  mouse! I cannot think what she has  done with it? I heard Ribby coming  and I had to run out by the back  door!\"      Duchess went home and brushed  her beautiful black coat; and then she  picked a bunch of flowers in her  garden as a present for Ribby; and  passed the time until the clock struck four.    Ribby--having assured herself by  careful search that there was really no  one hiding in the cupboard or in the  larder--went upstairs to change her dress.    She came downstairs again, and  made the tea, and put the teapot on  the hob. She peeped again into the  BOTTOM oven, the pie had become a  lovely brown, and it was steaming hot.    She sat down before the fire to wait  for the little dog. \"I am glad I used the  BOTTOM oven,\" said Ribby, \"the top  one would certainly have been very  much too hot.\"    Very punctually at four o'clock,  Duchess started to go to the party.    At a quarter past four "]]]
