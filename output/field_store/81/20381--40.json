In that way we are saved all  complaints as to food and other matters. Of course a passenger would  put on board for himself a stock of such wines, spirits, and little  luxuries as he may choose.    \"You will find Captain Peters down at the docks. The last cargo has  been discharged, and they are giving an overhaul to the rigging and  making a few repairs; he is not a man to leave his ship if he can help  it while work is going on there.\"    Harry at once went down.    \"Well, sir,\" the captain said, when he had told him that he wished to  take a passage to Callao, and that the owners had referred him to him,  \"I had fully made up my mind that I would not take passengers again. On  my last voyage they were always grumbling at the food, expecting to be  treated as if they were in a first-class hotel.\"    \"I am not likely to grumble, Captain; I have been knocking about the  King's service since I was fourteen.\"    \"Oh, you are a royal navy man, are you, sir?\"    \"I am; I am a lieutenant.\"    \"That makes a difference; and I have no doubt we can arrange the matter  to our satisfaction.\"    \"I may tell you,\" Harry said, \"that I have a younger brother coming out  with me. He is an apprentice nearly out of his time, and was on board  the _Stella_ when she was sunk in the Channel. Your owners have kindly  arranged that he shall go out with you as a supernumerary; that is one  reason why I wish to go in your ship.\"    The Master thought for a minute or two. \"Well, Mr. Prendergast,\" he  said, \"I like having one of you naval gentlemen on board; if anything  goes wrong it is a comfort to have your advice. If we have bad weather  round the Horn, could I rely upon you to give me a helping hand should  I need it? I don't mean that you should keep watch or anything of that  sort, but that you should, as it were, stand by me. I have a new first  mate, and there is no saying how he may turn out. No doubt the firm  would make every enquiry. Still, such enquiries don't mean much; a  master doesn't like to damn a man by refusing to give him a good  character. I dare say he is all right. Still, I should certainly feel  very much more comfortable if I had a naval officer with me. Now, sir,  I pay the firm twelve pounds for each passenger I take as his share of  the cabin stores; you pay me that, and I will ask for nothing for your  passage. I cannot say fairer than that.\"    \"You cannot indeed, Captain, and I feel very much obliged to you for  the offer--very much obliged. It will suit me admirably, and in case of  any emergency you may rely upon my aid; and if you have a spell of bad  weather I shall be quite willing to take a watch, for I know that in  the long heavy gales you meet with going round the Horn the officers  get terribly overtaxed.\"    \"And how about your brother?\" the captain said; \"as he is to be a  supernumerary, I suppose that only means that the firm are willing that  he shall put in his time for his rating. I have never had a  supernumerary on board, but I suppose he is to be regarded as a  passenger rather than one of the ship's complement.\"    \"No, Captain, he is to be on the pay-sheet; and I think he had much  better be put into a watch. He would find the time hang very heavy on  his hands if he had nothing to do, and I know he is anxious to learn  his profession thoroughly. As he is to be paid, there is no reason why  he should not work.\"    \"Very well; if you think so we will say nothing more about it. I  thought perhaps you would like to have him aft with you.\"    \"I am much obliged to you, but I think the other way will be best; and  I am sure he would feel more comfortable with the other apprentices  than as a passenger.\"    \"Are you going out for long, may I ask you, Mr. Prendergast?\"    \"For a couple of years or so. I am going to wander about and do some  shooting and exploring and that sort of thing, and I am taking him with  me as companion. I speak Spanish fairly well myself, and shall teach  him on the voyage, if you will allow me to do so. A knowledge of that  language will be an advantage to him when he comes back into Prosser &  Co.'s service.\"    \"A great advantage,\" the captain agreed. \"Most of us speak a little  Spanish, but I have often thought that it would pay the company to send  a man who could talk the lingo well in each ship. They could call him  supercargo, and I am sure he would pay his wages three or four times  over by being able to bargain and arrange with the Chilians and  Peruvians. In ports like Callao, where there is a British consul,  things are all right, but in the little ports we are fleeced right and  left. Boatmen and shopkeepers charge us two or three times as much as  they do their own countrymen, and I am sure that we could get better  bargains in hides and other produce if we had someone who could knock  down their prices.\"    \"When do you sail, Captain?\"    \"This day week. It will be high tide about eight, and we shall start to  warp out of dock a good half-hour earlier, so you can either come on  board the night before or about seven in the morning.\"    \"Very well, sir; we shall be here in good time. I shall bring my things  on board with me; it is of no use sending them on before, as they will  not be bulky and can be stored away in my cabin.\"    \"This will be your state-room,\" the captain said, opening a door. \"I  have the one aft, and the first mate has the one opposite to you. The  others are empty, so you can stow any baggage that you have in one of  them; the second and third officers and the apprentices are in the  deck-house cabins.\"    \"In that case, Captain, I will send the wine and spirits on board the  day before. Of course I shall get them out of bond; I might have  difficulty in doing that so early in the morning. You will perhaps be  good enough to order them to be stowed in one of the empty cabins.\"    \"That will be the best plan,\" the captain said.    \"When do the apprentices come on board?\"    \"The morning before we sail. There is always plenty to be done in  getting the last stores on board.\"    \"All right! my brother will be here. Good-morning, Captain, and thank  you!\"    The following morning at eleven Harry Prendergast was standing in front  of the entrance to the British Museum. A young lady came up. \"It is  very imprudent of you, Harry,\" she said, after the first greeting, \"to  ask me to meet you.\"    \"I could not help it, dear; it was absolutely necessary that I should  see you.\"    \"But it is of no use, Harry.\"    \"I consider that it is of particular use, Hilda.\"    \"But you know, Harry, when you had that very unpleasant talk with my  father, I was called in, and said that I had promised to wait two years  for you. When he found that I would not give way, he promised that he  would not press me, on the understanding that we were not to meet again  except in public, and I all but promised.\"    \"Quite so, dear; but it appears to me that this is surely a public  place.\"    \"No, no, Harry; what he meant was that I was not to meet you except at  parties.\"    \"Well, I should have asked you to meet me to-day even if I had had to  storm your father's house to see you. I am going away, dear, and he  could scarcely say much if he came along and found us talking here. You  see, it was not likely that I should stumble across a fortune in the  streets of London. I have talked the matter over with Barnett--you know  our trustee, you have met him once or twice--and we came to the  conclusion that the only possible chance of my being able to satisfy  your father as to my means, was for me to go to Peru and try to  discover a gold mine there or hidden treasure. Such discoveries have  been made, and may be made again; and he has supplied me with a letter  to an Indian, who may possibly be able to help me.\"    \"To Peru, Harry! Why, they are always fighting there.\"    \"Yes, they do a good deal of squabbling, but the people in general have  little to do with it; and certainly I am not going out to take any part  in their revolutions. There is not a shadow of doubt that a number of  gold mines worked by the old people were never discovered by the  Spaniards, and it is also certain that a great portion of the treasures  of the Incas is still lying hid. Barnett saved the life of a muleteer  out there, and from what he said he believed that the man did know  something about one of these lost mines, and might possibly let me into  the secret. It is just an off chance, but it is the only chance I can  see. You promised your father that you would never marry without his  consent, and he would never give it unless I were a rich man. If  nothing comes of this adventure I shall be no worse off than I am at  present. If I am fortunate enough to discover a rich mine or a hidden  treasure, I shall be in a position to satisfy his demand. I am going to  take Bertie with me; he will be a cheerful companion, and even now he  is a powerful young fellow. At any rate, if I get sick or anything of  that sort, it would be an immense advantage to have him with me.\"    \"I don't like the idea of your going, Harry,\" she said tearfully.  \"No,  dear; and if I had the chance of seeing you sometimes, and of some day  obtaining your father's consent to the marriage, all the gold mines in  Peru would offer no temptation to me. As it is, I can see nothing else  for it. In some respects it is better; if I were to stay here I should  only be meeting you frequently at dances and dinners, never able to  talk to you privately, and feeling always that you could never be mine.  It would be a constant torture. Here is a possibility--a very remote  one, I admit, but still a possibility--and even if it fails I shall  have the satisfaction of knowing that I have done all that a man could  do to win you.\"    \"I think it is best that you should go somewhere, Harry, but Peru seems  to be a horrible place.\"    \"Barnett speaks of it in high terms.

It's a different thing down there.  They won't always mind that song  even, down there.  And if anyone sings it, they stand grinning at him  awfully; and if he gets frightened, and misses a word, or says a wrong  one, they--oh! don't they give it him!'    'What do they do to him?' asked Irene, with a trembling voice.    'Don't go frightening the princess,' said the nurse.    'The princess!' repeated the little miner, taking off his curious cap.  'I beg your pardon; but you oughtn't to be out so late. Everybody knows  that's against the law.'    'Yes, indeed it is!' said the nurse, beginning to cry again.  'And I  shall have to suffer for it.'    'What does that matter?' said the boy.  'It must be your fault.  It is  the princess who will suffer for it.  I hope they didn't hear you call  her the princess.  If they did, they're sure to know her again: they're  awfully sharp.'    'Lootie! Lootie!' cried the princess.  'Take me home.'    'Don't go on like that,' said the nurse to the boy, almost fiercely.  'How could I help it?  I lost my way.'    'You shouldn't have been out so late.  You wouldn't have lost your way  if you hadn't been frightened,' said the boy.  'Come along. I'll soon  set you right again.  Shall I carry your little Highness?'    'Impertinence!' murmured the nurse, but she did not say it aloud, for  she thought if she made him angry he might take his revenge by telling  someone belonging to the house, and then it would be sure to come to  the king's ears.  'No, thank you,' said Irene.  'I can walk very well,  though I can't run so fast as nursie.  If you will give me one hand,  Lootie will give me another, and then I shall get on famously.'    They soon had her between them, holding a hand of each.    'Now let's run,' said the nurse.    'No, no!' said the little miner.  'That's the worst thing you can do.  If you hadn't run before, you would not have lost your way. And if you  run now, they will be after you in a moment.'    'I don't want to run,' said Irene.    'You don't think of me,' said the nurse.    'Yes, I do, Lootie.  The boy says they won't touch us if we don't run.'    'Yes, but if they know at the house that I've kept you out so late I  shall be turned away, and that would break my heart.'    'Turned away, Lootie!  Who would turn you away?'    'Your papa, child.'    'But I'll tell him it was all my fault.  And you know it was, Lootie.'    'He won't mind that.  I'm sure he won't.'    'Then I'll cry, and go down on my knees to him, and beg him not to take  away my own dear Lootie.'    The nurse was comforted at hearing this, and said no more.  They went  on, walking pretty fast, but taking care not to run a step.    'I want to talk to you,' said Irene to the little miner; 'but it's so  awkward!  I don't know your name.'    'My name's Curdie, little princess.'    'What a funny name! Curdie!  What more?'    'Curdie Peterson.  What's your name, please?'    'Irene.'    'What more?'    'I don't know what more.  What more is my name, Lootie?'    'Princesses haven't got more than one name.  They don't want it.'    'Oh, then, Curdie, you must call me just Irene and no more.'    'No, indeed,' said the nurse indignantly.  'He shall do no such thing.'    'What shall he call me, then, Lootie?'    'Your Royal Highness.' 'My Royal Highness!  What's that?  No, no,  Lootie.  I won't be called names.  I don't like them.  You told me once  yourself it's only rude children that call names; and I'm sure Curdie  wouldn't be rude.  Curdie, my name's Irene.'    'Well, Irene,' said Curdie, with a glance at the nurse which showed he  enjoyed teasing her; 'it is very kind of you to let me call you  anything.  I like your name very much.'    He expected the nurse to interfere again; but he soon saw that she was  too frightened to speak.  She was staring at something a few yards  before them in the middle of the path, where it narrowed between rocks  so that only one could pass at a time.    'It is very much kinder of you to go out of your way to take us home,'  said Irene.    'I'm not going out of my way yet,' said Curdie.  'It's on the other  side of those rocks the path turns off to my father's.'    'You wouldn't think of leaving us till we're safe home, I'm sure,'  gasped the nurse.    'Of course not,' said Curdie.    'You dear, good, kind Curdie!  I'll give you a kiss when we get home,'  said the princess.    The nurse gave her a great pull by the hand she held.  But at that  instant the something in the middle of the way, which had looked like a  great lump of earth brought down by the rain, began to move. One after  another it shot out four long things, like two arms and two legs, but  it was now too dark to tell what they were.  The nurse began to tremble  from head to foot.  Irene clasped Curdie's hand yet faster, and Curdie  began to sing again:      'One, two--    Hit and hew!    Three, four--    Blast and bore!    Five, six--    There's a fix!    Seven, eight--    Hold it straight!    Nine, ten--    Hit again!    Hurry! scurry!    Bother! smother!    There's a toad    In the road!    Smash it!    Squash it!    Fry it!    Dry it!    You're another!    Up and off!    There's enough!--    Huuuuuh!'      As he uttered the last words, Curdie let go his hold of his companion,  and rushed at the thing in the road as if he would trample it under his  feet.  It gave a great spring, and ran straight up one of the rocks  like a huge spider.  Curdie turned back laughing, and took Irene's hand  again.  She grasped his very tight, but said nothing till they had  passed the rocks.  A few yards more and she found herself on a part of  the road she knew, and was able to speak again.    'Do you know, Curdie, I don't quite like your song: it sounds to me  rather rude,' she said.    'Well, perhaps it is,' answered Curdie.  'I never thought of that; it's  a way we have.  We do it because they don't like it.'    'Who don't like it?'    'The cobs, as we call them.'    'Don't!' said the nurse.    'Why not?' said Curdie.    'I beg you won't.  Please don't.'    'Oh! if you ask me that way, of course, I won't; though I don't a bit  know why.  Look! there are the lights of your great house down below.  You'll be at home in five minutes now.'    Nothing more happened.  They reached home in safety.  Nobody had missed  them, or even known they had gone out; and they arrived at the door  belonging to their part of the house without anyone seeing them.  The  nurse was rushing in with a hurried and not over-gracious good night to  Curdie; but the princess pulled her hand from hers, and was just  throwing her arms round Curdie's neck, when she caught her again and  dragged her away.    'Lootie! Lootie! I promised a kiss,' cried Irene.    'A princess mustn't give kisses.  It's not at all proper,' said Lootie.    'But I promised,' said the princess.    'There's no occasion; he's only a miner-boy.'    'He's a good boy, and a brave boy, and he has been very kind to us.  Lootie! Lootie! I promised.'    'Then you shouldn't have promised.'    'Lootie, I promised him a kiss.'    'Your Royal Highness,' said Lootie, suddenly grown very respectful,  'must come in directly.'    'Nurse, a princess must not break her word,' said Irene, drawing  herself up and standing stock-still.    Lootie did not know which the king might count the worst--to let the  princess be out after sunset, or to let her kiss a miner-boy. She did  not know that, being a gentleman, as many kings have been, he would  have counted neither of them the worse.  However much he might have  disliked his daughter to kiss the miner-boy, he would not have had her  break her word for all the goblins in creation. But, as I say, the  nurse was not lady enough to understand this, and so she was in a great  difficulty, for, if she insisted, someone might hear the princess cry  and run to see, and then all would come out.  But here Curdie came  again to the rescue.    'Never mind, Princess Irene,' he said.  'You mustn't kiss me tonight.  But you shan't break your word.  I will come another time.  You may be  sure I will.'    'Oh, thank you, Curdie!' said the princess, and stopped crying.    'Good night, Irene; good night, Lootie,' said Curdie, and turned and  was out of sight in a moment.    'I should like to see him!' muttered the nurse, as she carried the  princess to the nursery.    'You will see him,' said Irene.  'You may be sure Curdie will keep his  word.  He's sure to come again.'    'I should like to see him!' repeated the nurse, and said no more. She  did not want to open a new cause of strife with the princess by saying  more plainly what she meant.  Glad enough that she had succeeded both  in getting home unseen, and in keeping the princess from kissing the  miner's boy, she resolved to watch her far better in future.  Her  carelessness had already doubled the danger she was in.  Formerly the  goblins were her only fear; now she had to protect her charge from  Curdie as well.        CHAPTER 7    The Mines    Curdie went home whistling.  He resolved to say nothing about the  princess for fear of getting the nurse into trouble, for while he  enjoyed teasing her because of her absurdity, he was careful not to do  her any harm.  He saw no more of the goblins, and was soon fast asleep  in his bed.    He woke in the middle of the night, and thought he heard curious noises  outside.  He sat up and listened; then got up, and, opening the door  very quietly, went out.  When he peeped round the corner, he saw, under  his own window, a group of stumpy creatures, whom he at once recognized  by their shape.  Hardly, however, had he begun his 'One, two, three!'  when they broke asunder, scurried away, and were out of sight.  He  returned laughing, got into bed again, and was fast asleep in a moment.    Reflecting a little over the matter in the morning, he came to the  conclusion that, as nothing of the kind "]]]
