To one less  alert and practised in the exercise of swimming, death had been certain,  for the brook was both deep and strong.    \"By Saint Anne! but he is a proper youth,\" said the elder man. \"Run,  gossip, and help your blunder, by giving him aid, if thou canst. He  belongs to thine own troop--if old saws speak truth, water will not  drown him.\"    Indeed, the young traveller swam so strongly, and buffeted the waves so  well, that, notwithstanding the strength of the current, he was carried  but a little way down from the ordinary landing place.    By this time the younger of the two strangers was hurrying down to the  shore to render assistance, while the other followed him at a graver  pace, saying to himself as he approached, \"I knew water would never  drown that young fellow.--By my halidome [originally something regarded  as sacred, as a relic; formerly much used in solemn oaths], he is  ashore, and grasps his pole!--If I make not the more haste, he will beat  my gossip for the only charitable action which I ever saw him perform,  or attempt to perform, in the whole course of his life.\"    There was some reason to augur such a conclusion of the adventure,  for the bonny Scot had already accosted the younger Samaritan, who was  hastening to his assistance, with these ireful words: \"Discourteous dog!  why did you not answer when I called to know if the passage was fit  to be attempted? May the foul fiend catch me, but I will teach you the  respect due to strangers on the next occasion.\"    This was accompanied with that significant flourish with his pole which  is called le moulinet, because the artist, holding it in the middle,  brandishes the two ends in every direction like the sails of a windmill  in motion. His opponent, seeing himself thus menaced, laid hand upon his  sword, for he was one of those who on all occasions are more ready for  action than for speech; but his more considerate comrade, who came up,  commanded him to forbear, and, turning to the young man, accused him  in turn of precipitation in plunging into the swollen ford, and of  intemperate violence in quarrelling with a man who was hastening to his  assistance.    The young man, on hearing himself thus reproved by a man of advanced age  and respectable appearance, immediately lowered his weapon, and said  he would be sorry if he had done them injustice; but, in reality, it  appeared to him as if they had suffered him to put his life in peril  for want of a word of timely warning, which could be the part neither  of honest men nor of good Christians, far less of respectable burgesses,  such as they seemed to be.    \"Fair son,\" said the elder person, \"you seem, from your accent and  complexion, a stranger; and you should recollect your dialect is not so  easily comprehended by us; as perhaps it may be uttered by you.\"    \"Well, father,\" answered the youth, \"I do not care much about the  ducking I have had, and I will readily forgive your being partly the  cause, provided you will direct me to some place where I can have my  clothes dried; for it is my only suit, and I must keep it somewhat  decent.\"    \"For whom do you take us, fair son?\" said the elder stranger, in answer  to this question.    \"For substantial burgesses, unquestionably,\" said the youth; \"or--hold;  you, master, may be a money broker, or a corn merchant; and this man a  butcher, or grazier.\"    \"You have hit our capacities rarely,\" said the elder, smiling. \"My  business is indeed to trade in as much money as I can and my gossip's  dealings are somewhat of kin to the butcher's. As to your accommodation  we will try to serve you; but I must first know who you are, and whither  you are going, for, in these times, the roads are filled with travellers  on foot and horseback, who have anything in their head but honesty and  the fear of God.\"    The young man cast another keen and penetrating glance on him who spoke,  and on his silent companion, as if doubtful whether they, on their part,  merited the confidence they demanded; and the result of his observation  was as follows.    The eldest and most remarkable of these men in dress and appearance,  resembled the merchant or shopkeeper of the period. His jerkin, hose,  and cloak were of a dark uniform colour, but worn so threadbare that the  acute young Scot conceived that the wearer must be either very rich or  very poor, probably the former. The fashion of the dress was close and  short, a kind of garment which was not then held decorous among gentry,  or even the superior class of citizens, who generally wore loose gowns  which descended below the middle of the leg.    The expression of this man's countenance was partly attractive and  partly forbidding. His strong features, sunk cheeks, and hollow eyes  had, nevertheless, an expression of shrewdness and humour congenial to  the character of the young adventurer. But then, those same sunken eyes,  from under the shroud of thick black eyebrows, had something in them  that was at once commanding and sinister. Perhaps this effect was  increased by the low fur cap, much depressed on the forehead, and adding  to the shade from under which those eyes peered out; but it is certain  that the young stranger had some difficulty to reconcile his looks  with the meanness of his appearance in other respects. His cap, in  particular, in which all men of any quality displayed either a brooch of  gold or of silver, was ornamented with a paltry image of the Virgin, in  lead, such as the poorer sort of pilgrims bring from Loretto [a city  in Italy, containing the sanctuary of the Virgin Mary called the Santa  Casa, reputed to have been brought there by angels.].    His comrade was a stout formed, middle sized man, more than ten years  younger than his companion, with a down looking visage and a very  ominous smile, when by chance he gave way to that impulse, which was  never, except in reply to certain secret signs that seemed to pass  between him and the elder stranger. This man was armed with a sword and  dagger; and underneath his plain habit the Scotsman observed that he  concealed a jazeran, or flexible shirt of linked mail, which, as being  often worn by those, even of peaceful professions, who were called upon  at that perilous period to be frequently abroad, confirmed the young man  in his conjecture that the wearer was by profession a butcher, grazier,  or something of that description, called upon to be much abroad.  The young stranger, comprehending in one glance the result of the  observation which has taken us some time to express, answered, after a  moment's pause, \"I am ignorant whom I may have the honour to address,\"  making a slight reverence at the same time, \"but I am indifferent who  knows that I am a cadet of Scotland; and that I come to seek my fortune  in France, or elsewhere, after the custom of my countrymen.\"    \"Pasques dieu! and a gallant custom it is,\" said the elder stranger.  \"You seem a fine young springald, and at the right age to prosper,  whether among men or women. What say you? I am a merchant, and want a  lad to assist in my traffic; I suppose you are too much a gentleman to  assist in such mechanical drudgery?\"    \"Fair sir,\" said the youth, \"if your offer be seriously made--of which  I have my doubts--I am bound to thank you for it, and I thank you  accordingly; but I fear I should be altogether unfit for your service.\"    \"What!\" said the senior, \"I warrant thou knowest better how to draw  the bow, than how to draw a bill of charges--canst handle a broadsword  better than a pen--ha!\"    \"I am, master,\" answered the young Scot, \"a braeman, and therefore, as  we say, a bowman. But besides that, I have been in a convent, where the  good fathers taught me to read and write, and even to cipher.\"    \"Pasques dieu! that is too magnificent,\" said the merchant. \"By our Lady  of Embrun [a town in France containing a cathedral in which was a wooden  statue of the Virgin Mary, said to have been sculptured by St. Luke],  thou art a prodigy, man!\"    \"Rest you merry, fair master,\" said the youth, who was not much pleased  with his new acquaintance's jocularity, \"I must go dry myself, instead  of standing dripping here, answering questions.\"    The merchant only laughed louder as he spoke, and answered, \"Pasques  dieu! the proverb never fails--fier comme un Ecossois [proud or haughty  as a Scotchman]--but come, youngster, you are of a country I have a  regard for, having traded in Scotland in my time--an honest poor set  of folks they are; and, if you will come with us to the village, I will  bestow on you a cup of burnt sack and a warm breakfast, to atone for  your drenching.--But tete bleau! what do you with a hunting glove on  your hand? Know you not there is no hawking permitted in a royal chase?\"    \"I was taught that lesson,\" answered the youth, \"by a rascally forester  of the Duke of Burgundy. I did but fly the falcon I had brought with me  from Scotland, and that I reckoned on for bringing me into some note, at  a heron near Peronne, and the rascally schelm [rogue, rascal (obsolete  or Scotch)] shot my bird with an arrow.\"    \"What did you do?\" said the merchant.    \"Beat him,\" said the youngster, brandishing his staff, \"as near to death  as one Christian man should belabour another--I wanted not to have his  blood to answer for.\"    \"Know you,\" said the burgess, \"that had you fallen into the Duke of  Burgundy's hands, he would have hung you up like a chestnut?\"    \"Ay, I am told he is as prompt as the King of France for that sort  of work. But, as this happened near Peronne, I made a leap over the  frontiers, and laughed at him. If he had not been so hasty, I might,  perhaps, have taken service with him.\"    \"He will have a heavy miss of such a paladin as you are, if the truce  should break off,\" said the merchant, and threw a look at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7864"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#5)"],[1,"them  together in the regions of Brahma, then, O Sanjaya, I had no hope of  success.
