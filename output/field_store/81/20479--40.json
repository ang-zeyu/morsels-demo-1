[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9806"],[0,"Mr. Justice Raffles (#5)"],[1,"of Hathipur, and his perfectly  fabulous debts. It seems he's been in our Mr. Shylock's clutches for  years, but instead of taking his pound of flesh he's always increasing  the amount. Of course that's the whole duty of money-lenders, but now  they say the figure runs well into six. No one has any sympathy with that  old heathen; he's said to have been a pal of Nana's before the Mutiny,  and in it up to the neck he only saved by turning against his own lot in  time; in any case it's the pot and the kettle so far as moral colour is  concerned. But I believe it's an actual fact that syndicates have been  formed to buy up the black man's debts and take a reasonable interest,  only the dirty white man always gets to windward of the syndicate.  They're on the point of bringing it off, when old Levy inveigles the  nigger into some new Oriental extravagance. _Fact_ has exposed the whole  thing, and printed blackmailing letters which Shylock swears are  forgeries. That's both their cases in a philippine! The leeches told the  Jew he must do his Carlsbad this year before the case came on; and the  tremendous amount it's going to cost may account for his dunning old  clients the moment he gets back.\"    \"Then why should he lend to you?\"    \"I'm a new client, Bunny; that makes all the difference. Then we were  very good pals out there.\"    \"But you and Mrs. Shylock were better still?\"    \"Unbeknowns, Bunny! She used to tell me her troubles when I lent her an  arm and took due care to look a martyr; my hunting friend had coarse  metaphors about heavy-weights and the knacker's yard.\"    \"And yet you came away with the poor soul's necklace?\"    Raffles was tapping the chronic cigarette on the table at his elbow; he  stood up to light it, as one does stand up to make the dramatic  announcements of one's life, and he spoke through the flame of the match  as it rose and fell between his puffs.    \"No--Bunny--I did not!\"    \"But you told me you won the Emerald Stakes!\" I cried, jumping up  in my turn.    \"So I did, Bunny, but I gave them back again.\"    \"You gave yourself away to her, as she'd given him away to you?\"    \"Don't be a fool, Bunny,\" said Raffles, subsiding into his chair. \"I  can't tell you the whole thing now, but here are the main heads. They're  at the Savoy Hotel, in Carlsbad I mean. I go to Pupp's. We meet. They  stare. I come out of my British shell as the humble hero of the affair at  the other Savoy. I crab my hotel. They swear by theirs. I go to see their  rooms. I wait till I can get the very same thing immediately overhead on  the second floor--where I can even hear the old swine cursing her from  under his mud-poultice! Both suites have balconies that might have been  made for me. Need I go on?\"    \"I wonder you weren't suspected.\"    \"There's no end to your capacity for wonder, Bunny. I took some sweet old  rags with me on purpose, carefully packed inside a decent suit, and I had  the luck to pick up a foul old German cap that some peasant had cast off  in the woods. I only meant to leave it on them like a card; as it  was--well, I was waiting for the best barber in the place to open his  shop next morning.\"    \"What had happened?\"    \"A whole actful of unrehearsed effects; that's why I think twice before  taking on old Shylock again. I admire him, Bunny, as a steely foeman. I  look forward to another game with him on his own ground. But I must find  out the pace of the wicket before I put myself on.\"    \"I suppose you had tea with them, and all that sort of thing?\"    \"Gieshuebler!\" said Raffles with a shudder. \"But I made it last as long as  tea, and thought I had located the little green lamps before I took my  leave. There was a japanned despatch box in one corner. 'That's the  Emerald Isle,' I thought, 'I'll soon have it out of the sea. The old man  won't trust 'em to the old lady after what happened in town,' I needn't  tell you I knew they were there somewhere; he made her wear them even at  the tragic travesty of a Carlsbad hotel dinner.\"    Raffles was forgetting to be laconic now. I believe he had forgotten  the lad in the next room, and everything else but the breathless battle  that he was fighting over again for my benefit. He told me how he  waited for a dark night, and then slid down from his sitting-room  balcony to the one below. And my emeralds were not in the japanned box  after all; and just as he had assured himself of the fact, the  folding-doors opened \"as it might be these,\" and there stood Dan Levy  \"in a suit of swagger silk pyjamas.\"    \"They gave me a sudden respect for him,\" continued Raffles; \"it struck  me, for the first time, that mud baths mightn't be the only ones he ever  took. His face was as evil as ever, but he was utterly unarmed, and I was  not; and yet there he stood and abused me like a pickpocket, as if there  was no chance of my firing, and he didn't care whether I did or not. So I  stuck my revolver nearly in his face, and pulled the hammer up and up.  Good God, Bunny, if I had pulled too hard! But that made him blink a bit,  and I was jolly glad to let it down again. 'Out with those emeralds,'  says I in low German mugged up in case of need. Of course you realise  that I was absolutely unrecognisable, a low blackguard with a blackened  face. 'I don't know what you mean,' says he, 'and I'm damned if I care.'  '_Das halsband_, says I, which means the necklace. 'Go to hell,' says he.  But I struck myself and shook my head and then my fist at him and nodded.  He laughed in my face; and upon my soul we were at a deadlock. So I  pointed to the clock and held up one finger. 'I've one minute to live,  old girl,' says he through the doors, 'if this rotter has the guts to  shoot, and I don't think he has. Why the hell don't you get out the other  way and alarm the 'ouse?' And that raised the siege, Bunny. In comes the  old woman, as plucky as he was, and shoves the necklace into my left  hand. I longed to refuse it. I didn't dare. And the old beast took her  and shook her like a rat, until I covered him again, and swore in German  that if he showed himself on the balcony for the next two minutes he'd be  _ein toter Englander_! That was the other bit I'd got off pat; it was  meant to mean 'a dead Englishman.' And I left the fine old girl clinging  on to him, instead of him to her!\"    I emptied my lungs and my glass too. Raffles took a sip himself.    \"But the rope was fixed to _your_ balcony, A.J.?\"    \"But I began by fixing the other end to theirs, and the moment I was  safely up I undid my end and dropped it clear to the ground. They found  it dangling all right when out they rushed together. Of course I'd picked  the right ball in the way of nights; it was bone-dry as well as  pitch-dark, and in five minutes I was helping the rest of the hotel to  search for impossible footprints on the gravel, and to stamp out any  there might conceivably have been.\"    \"So nobody ever suspected you?\"    \"Not a soul, I can safely say; I was the first my victims bored with the  whole yarn.\"    \"Then why return the swag? It's an old trick of yours, Raffles, but in a  case like this, with a pig like that, I confess I don't see the point.\"    \"You forget the poor old lady, Bunny. She had a dog's life before; after  that the beans he gave her weren't even fit for a dog. I loved her for  her pluck in standing up to him; it beat his hollow in standing up to me;  there was only one reward for her, and it was in my gift.\"    \"But how on earth did you manage that?\"    \"Not by public presentation, Bunny, nor yet by taking the old dame into  my confidence _more cuniculi!\"_    \"I suppose you returned the necklace anonymously?\"    \"As a low-down German burglar would be sure to do! No, Bunny, I planted  it in the woods where I knew it would be found. And then I had to watch  lest it was found by the wrong sort. But luckily Mr. Shylock had sprung a  substantial reward, and all came right in the end. He sent his doctor to  blazes, and had a buck feed and lashings on the night it was recovered.  The hunting man and I were invited to the thanksgiving spread; but I  wouldn't budge from the diet, and he was ashamed to unless I did. It made  a coolness between us, and now I doubt if we shall ever have that  enormous dinner we used to talk about to celebrate our return from a  living tomb.\"    But I was not interested in that shadowy fox-hunter. \"Dan Levy's a  formidable brute to tackle,\" said I at length, and none too buoyantly.    \"That's a very true observation, Bunny; it's also exactly why I so looked  forward to tackling him. It ought to be the kind of conflict that the  halfpenny press have learnt to call Homeric.\"    \"Are you thinking of to-morrow, or of when it comes to robbing Peter to  pay Peter?\"    \"Excellent, Bunny!\" cried Raffles, as though I had made a shot worthy of  his willow. \"How the small hours brighten us up!\" He drew the curtains  and displayed a window like a child's slate with the sashes ruled across  it. \"You perceive how we have tired the stars with talking, and cleaned  them from the sky! The mellifluous Heraclitus can have been no sitter up  o' nights, or his pal wouldn't have boasted about tiring the sun by our  methods. What a lot the two old pets must have missed!\"    \"You haven't answered my question,\" said I resignedly. \"Nor have you told  me how you propose to go to work to raise this money in the first  instance.\"    \"If you like to light another Sullivan,\" said Raffles, \"and mix yourself  another very small and final one, I can tell you now, Bunny.\"    And tell me he did.          CHAPTER IV    \"Our Mr. Shylock\"      I have often wondered in what pause or phase of our conversation Raffles  hit upon the plan which we duly carried out; for we had been talking  incessantly, since his arrival about eight o'clock at night, until two in  the morning. Yet that which we discussed between two and three was what  we actually did between nine and ten, with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/984"],[0,"Who Was Who: 5000 B.
