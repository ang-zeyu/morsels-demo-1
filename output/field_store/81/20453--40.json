O wild as my heart,              and powerful!)    Heard the continuous thunder as it bellow'd after the lightning,    Noted the slender and jagged threads of lightning as sudden and fast              amid the din they chased each other across the sky;    These, and such as these, I, elate, saw--saw with wonder, yet pensive              and masterful,    All the menacing might of the globe uprisen around me,    Yet there with my soul I fed, I fed content, supercilious.    2      'Twas well, O soul--'twas a good preparation you gave me,    Now we advance our latent and ampler hunger to fill,    Now we go forth to receive what the earth and the sea never gave us,    Not through the mighty woods we go, but through the mightier cities,    Something for us is pouring now more than Niagara pouring,    Torrents of men, (sources and rills of the Northwest are you indeed              inexhaustible?)    What, to pavements and homesteads here, what were those storms of the              mountains and sea?    What, to passions I witness around me to-day? was the sea risen?    Was the wind piping the pipe of death under the black clouds?    Lo! from deeps more unfathomable, something more deadly and savage,    Manhattan rising, advancing with menacing front--Cincinnati, Chicago,              unchain'd;    What was that swell I saw on the ocean? behold what comes here,    How it climbs with daring feet and hands--how it dashes!    How the true thunder bellows after the lightning--how bright the              flashes of lightning!    How Democracy with desperate vengeful port strides on, shown through              the dark by those flashes of lightning!    (Yet a mournful wail and low sob I fancied I heard through the dark,    In a lull of the deafening confusion.)    3      Thunder on! stride on, Democracy! strike with vengeful stroke!    And do you rise higher than ever yet O days, O cities!

The noble son on sinewy feet advancing,    I saw, out of the land of prairies, land of Ohio's waters and of              Indiana,    To the rescue the stalwart giant hurry his plenteous offspring,    Drest in blue, bearing their trusty rifles on their shoulders.      Then the Mother of All with calm voice speaking,    As to you Rebellious, (I seemed to hear her say,) why strive against              me, and why seek my life?

Proud and passionate city--mettlesome, mad, extravagant city!    Spring up, O city--not for peace alone, but be indeed yourself,              warlike!    Fear not--submit to no models but your own O city!    Behold me--incarnate me as I have incarnated you!

Rest, while I tell what the crowd around us means,    On the plain below recruits are drilling and exercising,    There is the camp, one regiment departs to-morrow,    Do you hear the officers giving their orders?    Do you hear the clank of the muskets?      Why what comes over you now old man?    Why do you tremble and clutch my hand so convulsively?    The troops are but drilling, they are yet surrounded with smiles.    Around them at hand the well-drest friends and the women,    While splendid and warm the afternoon sun shines down,    Green the midsummer verdure and fresh blows the dallying breeze,    O'er proud and peaceful cities and arm of the sea between.    But drill and parade are over, they march back to quarters,    Only hear that approval of hands! hear what a clapping!

Aye, this is the ground,    My blind eyes even as I speak behold it re-peopled from graves,    The years recede, pavements and stately houses disappear,    Rude forts appear again, the old hoop'd guns are mounted,    I see the lines of rais'd earth stretching from river to bay,    I mark the vista of waters, I mark the uplands and slopes;    Here we lay encamp'd, it was this time in summer also.

Raymond had prayed to God, in some of his accesses of  fanaticism, that he might suffer martyrdom in his holy cause. His  servant had overheard him; and, being as great a fanatic as his master,  he resolved to gratify his wish, and punish him, at the same time, for  the curses which he incessantly launched against Mahomet and all who  believed in him, by stabbing him to the heart. He, therefore, aimed  a blow at his master, as he sat one day at table; but the instinct of  self-preservation being stronger than the desire of martyrdom, Raymond  grappled with his antagonist, and overthrew him. He scorned to take his  life himself; but handed him over to the authorities of the town, by  whom he was afterwards found dead in his prison.    After this adventure Raymond travelled to Paris, where he resided for  some time, and made the acquaintance of Arnold de Villeneuve. From him  he probably received some encouragement to search for the philosopher's  stone, as he began from that time forth to devote less of his attention  to religious matters, and more to the study of alchymy. Still he never  lost sight of the great object for which he lived--the conversion of the  Mahometans--and proceeded to Rome, to communicate personally with Pope  John XXI, on the best measures to be adopted for that end. The Pope gave  him encouragement in words, but failed to associate any other persons  with him in the enterprise which he meditated. Raymond, therefore,  set out for Tunis alone, and was kindly received by many Arabian  philosophers, who had heard of his fame as a professor of alchymy. If he  had stuck to alchymy while in their country, it would have been well for  him; but he began cursing Mahomet, and got himself into trouble. While  preaching the doctrines of Christianity in the great bazaar of Tunis, he  was arrested and thrown into prison. He was shortly afterwards brought  to trial, and sentenced to death. Some of his philosophic friends  interceded hard for him, and he was pardoned, upon condition that he  left Africa immediately, and never again set foot in it. If he was found  there again, no matter what his object might be, or whatever length  of time might intervene, his original sentence would be carried into  execution. Raymond was not at all solicitous of martyrdom when it came  to the point, whatever he might have been when there was no danger, and  he gladly accepted his life upon these conditions, and left Tunis with  the intention of proceeding to Rome. He afterwards changed his plan, and  established himself at Milan, where, for a length of time, he practised  alchymy, and some say astrology, with great success.    Most writers who believed in the secrets of alchymy, and who have  noticed the life of Raymond Lulli, assert, that while in Milan, he  received letters from Edward King of England, inviting him to settle in  his states. They add, that Lulli gladly accepted the invitation, and had  apartments assigned for his use in the Tower of London, where he refined  much gold; superintended the coinage of \"rose-nobles;\" and made gold out  of iron, quicksilver, lead, and pewter, to the amount of six millions.  The writers in the \"Biographie Universelle,\" an excellent authority in  general, deny that Raymond was ever in England, and say, that in all  these stories of his wondrous powers as an alchymist, he has been  mistaken for another Raymond, a Jew, of Tarragona. Naude, in his  \"Apologie,\" says, simply, \"that six millions were given by Raymond Lulli  to King Edward, to make war against the Turks and other infidels:\" not  that he transmuted so much metal into gold; but, as he afterwards adds,  that he advised Edward to lay a tax upon wool, which produced that  amount. To show that Raymond went to England, his admirers quote a work  attributed to him, \"De Transmutatione Animae Metallorum,\" in which he  expressly says, that he was in England at the intercession of the King.  [Vidimus omnia ista dum ad Angliam transiimus, propter intercessionem  Domini Regis Edoardi illustrissimi.] The hermetic writers are not agreed  whether it was Edward I, or Edward II, who invited him over; but, by  fixing the date of his journey in 1312, they make it appear that it was  Edward II. Edmond Dickenson, in his work on the \"Quintessences of the  Philosophers,\" says, that Raymond worked in Westminster Abbey, where, a  long time after his departure, there was found in the cell which he had  occupied, a great quantity of golden dust, of which the architects made  a great profit. In the biographical sketch of John Cremer, Abbot of  Westminster, given by Lenglet, it is said, that it was chiefly through  his instrumentality that Raymond came to England. Cremer had  been himself for thirty years occupied in the vain search for the  philosopher's stone, when he accidentally met Raymond in Italy, and  endeavoured to induce him to communicate his grand secret. Raymond told  him that he must find it for himself, as all great alchymists had done  before him. Cremer, on his return to England, spoke to King Edward in  high terms of the wonderful attainments of the philosopher, and a  letter of invitation was forthwith sent him. Robert Constantinus, in the  \"Nomenclatore Scriptorum Medicorum,\" published in 1515, says, that after  a great deal of research, be found that Raymond Lulli resided for  some time in London, and that he actually made gold, by means of the  philosopher's stone, in the Tower; that he had seen the golden pieces of  his coinage, which were still named in England the nobles of Raymond,  or rose-nobles. Lulli himself appears to have boasted that he made gold;  for, in his well-known \"Testamentum,\" he states, that he converted no  less than fifty thousand pounds weight of quicksilver, lead, and pewter  into that metal. [Converti una vice in aurum ad L millia pondo argenti  vivi, plumbi, et stanni.--Lullii Testamentum.] It seems highly probable  that the English King, believing in the extraordinary powers of the  alchymist, invited him to England to make test of them, and that he was  employed in refining gold and in coining. Camden, who is not credulous  in matters like these, affords his countenance to the story of his  coinage of nobles; and there is nothing at all wonderful in the fact  of a man famous for his knowledge of metals being employed in such a  capacity. Raymond was, at this time, an old man, in his seventy-seventh  year, and somewhat in his dotage. He was willing enough to have it  believed that he had discovered the grand secret, and supported the  rumour rather than contradicted it. He did not long remain in England;  but returned to Rome, to carry out the projects which were nearer to his  heart than the profession of alchymy. He had proposed them to several  successive Popes with little or no success. The first was a plan for  the introduction of the Oriental languages into all the monasteries  of Europe; the second, for the reduction into one of all the military  orders, that, being united, they might move more efficaciously against  the Saracens; and, the third, that the Sovereign Pontiff should  forbid the works of Averroes to be read in the schools, as being more  favourable to Mahometanism than to Christianity. The Pope did not  receive the old man with much cordiality; and, after remaining for  about two years in Rome, he proceeded once more to Africa, alone and  unprotected, to preach the Gospel of Jesus. He landed at Bona in 1314;  and so irritated the Mahometans by cursing their prophet, that they  stoned him, and left him for dead on the sea-shore. He was found some  hours afterwards by a party of Genoese merchants, who conveyed him on  board their vessel, and sailed towards Majorca. The unfortunate man  still breathed, but could not articulate. He lingered in this state for  some days, and expired just as the vessel arrived within sight of his  native shores. His body was conveyed with great pomp to the church of  St. Eulalia, at Palma, where a public funeral was instituted in his  honour. Miracles were afterwards said to have been worked at his tomb.    Thus ended the career of Raymond Lulli, one of the most extraordinary  men of his age; and, with the exception of his last boast about the  six millions of gold, the least inclined to quackery of any of the  professors of alchymy. His writings were very numerous, and include  nearly five hundred volumes, upon grammar, rhetoric, morals, theology,  politics, civil and canon law, physics, metaphysics, astronomy,  medicine, and chemistry.      ROGER BACON.    The powerful delusion of alchymy seized upon a mind still greater than  that of Raymond Lulli. Roger Bacon firmly believed in the philosopher's  stone, and spent much of his time in search of it. His example helped  to render all the learned men of the time more convinced of its  practicability, and more eager in the pursuit. He was born at Ilchester,  in the county of Somerset, in the year 1214. He studied for some time in  the university of Oxford, and afterwards in that of Paris, in which he  received the degree of doctor of divinity. Returning to England in 1240,  he became a monk of the order of St. Francis. He was by far the most  learned man of his age; and his acquirements were so much above the  comprehension of his contemporaries, that they could only account for  them by supposing that he was indebted for them to the devil. Voltaire  has not inaptly designated him \"De l'or encroute de toutes les ordures  de son siecle;\" but the crust of superstition that enveloped his  powerful mind, though it may have dimmed, could not obscure the  brightness of his genius. To him, and apparently to him only, among  all the inquiring spirits of the time, were known the properties of the  concave and convex lens. He also invented the magic-lantern; that pretty  plaything of modern days, which acquired for him a reputation that  embittered his life. In a history of alchymy,"]]]
