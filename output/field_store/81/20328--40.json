[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/599"],[0,"Vanity Fair (#5)"],[1,"e, a great deal of  conversation had taken place about the Drawing-room, and whether or not  young ladies wore powder as well as hoops when presented, and whether  she was to have that honour: to the Lord Mayor's ball she knew she was  to go.  And when at length home was reached, Miss Amelia Sedley skipped  out on Sambo's arm, as happy and as handsome a girl as any in the whole  big city of London.  Both he and coachman agreed on this point, and so  did her father and mother, and so did every one of the servants in the  house, as they stood bobbing, and curtseying, and smiling, in the hall  to welcome their young mistress.    You may be sure that she showed Rebecca over every room of the house,  and everything in every one of her drawers; and her books, and her  piano, and her dresses, and all her necklaces, brooches, laces, and  gimcracks. She insisted upon Rebecca accepting the white cornelian and  the turquoise rings, and a sweet sprigged muslin, which was too small  for her now, though it would fit her friend to a nicety; and she  determined in her heart to ask her mother's permission to present her  white Cashmere shawl to her friend.  Could she not spare it? and had  not her brother Joseph just brought her two from India?    When Rebecca saw the two magnificent Cashmere shawls which Joseph  Sedley had brought home to his sister, she said, with perfect truth,  \"that it must be delightful to have a brother,\" and easily got the pity  of the tender-hearted Amelia for being alone in the world, an orphan  without friends or kindred.    \"Not alone,\" said Amelia; \"you know, Rebecca, I shall always be your  friend, and love you as a sister--indeed I will.\"    \"Ah, but to have parents, as you have--kind, rich, affectionate  parents, who give you everything you ask for; and their love, which is  more precious than all! My poor papa could give me nothing, and I had  but two frocks in all the world! And then, to have a brother, a dear  brother! Oh, how you must love him!\"    Amelia laughed.    \"What! don't you love him? you, who say you love everybody?\"    \"Yes, of course, I do--only--\"    \"Only what?\"    \"Only Joseph doesn't seem to care much whether I love him or not. He  gave me two fingers to shake when he arrived after ten years' absence!  He is very kind and good, but he scarcely ever speaks to me; I think he  loves his pipe a great deal better than his\"--but here Amelia checked  herself, for why should she speak ill of her brother? \"He was very kind  to me as a child,\" she added; \"I was but five years old when he went  away.\"    \"Isn't he very rich?\" said Rebecca.  \"They say all Indian nabobs are  enormously rich.\"    \"I believe he has a very large income.\"    \"And is your sister-in-law a nice pretty woman?\"    \"La! Joseph is not married,\" said Amelia, laughing again.    Perhaps she had mentioned the fact already to Rebecca, but that young  lady did not appear to have remembered it; indeed, vowed and protested  that she expected to see a number of Amelia's nephews and nieces.  She  was quite disappointed that Mr. Sedley was not married; she was sure  Amelia had said he was, and she doted so on little children.    \"I think you must have had enough of them at Chiswick,\" said Amelia,  rather wondering at the sudden tenderness on her friend's part; and  indeed in later days Miss Sharp would never have committed herself so  far as to advance opinions, the untruth of which would have been so  easily detected.  But we must remember that she is but nineteen as yet,  unused to the art of deceiving, poor innocent creature! and making her  own experience in her own person.  The meaning of the above series of  queries, as translated in the heart of this ingenious young woman, was  simply this: \"If Mr. Joseph Sedley is rich and unmarried, why should I  not marry him? I have only a fortnight, to be sure, but there is no  harm in trying.\" And she determined within herself to make this  laudable attempt.  She redoubled her caresses to Amelia; she kissed the  white cornelian necklace as she put it on; and vowed she would never,  never part with it.  When the dinner-bell rang she went downstairs with  her arm round her friend's waist, as is the habit of young ladies. She  was so agitated at the drawing-room door, that she could hardly find  courage to enter.  \"Feel my heart, how it beats, dear!\" said she to her  friend.    \"No, it doesn't,\" said Amelia.  \"Come in, don't be frightened.  Papa  won't do you any harm.\"        CHAPTER III    Rebecca Is in Presence of the Enemy    A VERY stout, puffy man, in buckskins and Hessian boots, with several  immense neckcloths that rose almost to his nose, with a red striped  waistcoat and an apple green coat with steel buttons almost as large as  crown pieces (it was the morning costume of a dandy or blood of those  days) was reading the paper by the fire when the two girls entered, and  bounced off his arm-chair, and blushed excessively, and hid his entire  face almost in his neckcloths at this apparition.    \"It's only your sister, Joseph,\" said Amelia, laughing and shaking the  two fingers which he held out.  \"I've come home FOR GOOD, you know; and  this is my friend, Miss Sharp, whom you have heard me mention.\"    \"No, never, upon my word,\" said the head under the neckcloth, shaking  very much--\"that is, yes--what abominably cold weather, Miss\"--and  herewith he fell to poking the fire with all his might, although it was  in the middle of June.    \"He's very handsome,\" whispered Rebecca to Amelia, rather loud.    \"Do you think so?\" said the latter.  \"I'll tell him.\"    \"Darling! not for worlds,\" said Miss Sharp, starting back as timid as a  fawn.  She had previously made a respectful virgin-like curtsey to the  gentleman, and her modest eyes gazed so perseveringly on the carpet  that it was a wonder how she should have found an opportunity to see  him.    \"Thank you for the beautiful shawls, brother,\" said Amelia to the fire  poker.  \"Are they not beautiful, Rebecca?\"    \"O heavenly!\" said Miss Sharp, and her eyes went from the carpet  straight to the chandelier.    Joseph still continued a huge clattering at the poker and tongs,  puffing and blowing the while, and turning as red as his yellow face  would allow him.  \"I can't make you such handsome presents, Joseph,\"  continued his sister, \"but while I was at school, I have embroidered  for you a very beautiful pair of braces.\"    \"Good Gad! Amelia,\" cried the brother, in serious alarm, \"what do you  mean?\" and plunging with all his might at the bell-rope, that article  of furniture came away in his hand, and increased the honest fellow's  confusion.  \"For heaven's sake see if my buggy's at the door.  I CAN'T  wait.  I must go.  D---- that groom of mine. I must go.\"    At this minute the father of the family walked in, rattling his seals  like a true British merchant.  \"What's the matter, Emmy?\" says he.    \"Joseph wants me to see if his--his buggy is at the door.  What is a  buggy, Papa?\"    \"It is a one-horse palanquin,\" said the old gentleman, who was a wag in  his way.    Joseph at this burst out into a wild fit of laughter; in which,  encountering the eye of Miss Sharp, he stopped all of a sudden, as if  he had been shot.    \"This young lady is your friend? Miss Sharp, I am very happy to see  you.  Have you and Emmy been quarrelling already with Joseph, that he  wants to be off?\"    \"I promised Bonamy of our service, sir,\" said Joseph, \"to dine with  him.\"    \"O fie! didn't you tell your mother you would dine here?\"    \"But in this dress it's impossible.\"    \"Look at him, isn't he handsome enough to dine anywhere, Miss Sharp?\"    On which, of course, Miss Sharp looked at her friend, and they both set  off in a fit of laughter, highly agreeable to the old gentleman.    \"Did you ever see a pair of buckskins like those at Miss Pinkerton's?\"  continued he, following up his advantage.    \"Gracious heavens! Father,\" cried Joseph.    \"There now, I have hurt his feelings.  Mrs. Sedley, my dear, I have  hurt your son's feelings.  I have alluded to his buckskins.  Ask Miss  Sharp if I haven't? Come, Joseph, be friends with Miss Sharp, and let  us all go to dinner.\"    \"There's a pillau, Joseph, just as you like it, and Papa has brought  home the best turbot in Billingsgate.\"    \"Come, come, sir, walk downstairs with Miss Sharp, and I will follow  with these two young women,\" said the father, and he took an arm of  wife and daughter and walked merrily off.    If Miss Rebecca Sharp had determined in her heart upon making the  conquest of this big beau, I don't think, ladies, we have any right to  blame her; for though the task of husband-hunting is generally, and  with becoming modesty, entrusted by young persons to their mammas,  recollect that Miss Sharp had no kind parent to arrange these delicate  matters for her, and that if she did not get a husband for herself,  there was no one else in the wide world who would take the trouble off  her hands.  What causes young people to \"come out,\" but the noble  ambition of matrimony? What sends them trooping to watering-places?  What keeps them dancing till five o'clock in the morning through a  whole mortal season? What causes them to labour at pianoforte sonatas,  and to learn four songs from a fashionable master at a guinea a lesson,  and to play the harp if they have handsome arms and neat elbows, and to  wear Lincoln Green toxophilite hats and feathers, but that they may  bring down some \"desirable\" young man with those killing bows and  arrows of theirs? What causes respectable parents to take up their  carpets, set their houses topsy-turvy, and spend a fifth of their  year's income in ball suppers and iced champagne? Is it sheer love of  their species, and an unadulterated wish to see young people happy and  dancing? Psha! they want to marry their daughters; and, as honest Mrs.  Sedley has, in the depths of her kind heart, already arranged a score  of little schemes for the settlement of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5992"],[0,"Station Amusements in New Zealand (#5)"],[1," would face the waves of an inland  lake during a nor'-wester,--which is giving a dog very high praise  indeed; but there was no canine Bayard at hand to brave those  treacherous depths, and bring out our game, so the sport soon ceased;  for what was the good of shooting the beautiful, harmless creatures when  we could not make use of them as food?    I often accompanied F---- on his eel-fishing expeditions, but more for  the sake of companionship than from any amusement I found in the sport.  I may here confess frankly that I cannot understand anyone being an  inveterate eel-fisher, for of all monotonous pursuits, it is the most  self-repeating in its forms. Even the first time I went out I found it  delightful only in anticipation; and this is the one midnight excursion  which I shall attempt to re-produce for you.    It had been a broiling midsummer day, too hot to sit in the verandah,  too hot to stroll about the garden, or go for a ride, or do anything  in fact, except bask like a lizard in the warm air. New Zealand summer  weather, however high the thermometer, is quite different from either  tropical or English heat. It is intensely hot in the sun, but always  cool in the shade. I never heard of an instance of sun-stroke from  exposure to the mid-day sun, for there always was a light air--often  scarcely perceptible until you were well out in the open,--to temper the  fierce vertical rays. It sometimes happened that I found myself obliged,  either for business or pleasure, to take a long ride in the middle of a  summer's day, and my invariable reflection used to be, \"It is not nearly  so hot out of doors as one fancies it would be.\" Then there is none of  the stuffiness so often an accompaniment to our brief summers, bringing  lassitude and debility in its train. The only disadvantage of an  unusually hot season with us was, that our already embrowned complexions  took a deeper shade of bronze; but as we were all equally sun-burnt  there was no one to throw critical stones.    What surprised me most was the utter absence of damp or miasma. After a  blazing day, instead of hurrying in out of reach of poisonous vapours as  the tropic-dweller must needs do, we could linger bare-headed, lightly  clad, out of doors, listening to the distant roar of a river, or  watching the exquisite tints of the evening sky. I dwell on this to  explain that in almost any other country there would have been risk in  remaining out at night after such still, hot days.    On this particular evening, during my first summer in the New Zealand  Malvern Hills, after we had watered my pet flowers near the house, and  speculated a good deal as to whether the mignonette seed had all been  blown out of the ground by the last nor'-wester or not, F---- said, \"I  shall go eel-fishing to-night to the creek, down the flat. Why don't you  come too? I am sure you would like it.\" Now, I am sorry to say that I am  such a thorough gipsy in my tastes that any pursuit which serves as an  excuse for spending hours in the open air, is full of attraction for  me; consequently, I embraced the proposal with ardour, and set about  gathering, under F----'s directions, what seemed to bid fair to rival  the collection of an old rag-and-bottle merchant. First of all, there  was a muster of every empty tin match-box in the little house; these  were to hold the bait-bits of mutton and worms. Then I was desired  to hunt up all the odds and ends of worsted which lurked in the  scrap-basket. A forage next took place in search of string, but as no  parcels were ever delivered in that sequestered valley, twine became  a precious and rare treasure. In default of any large supply being  obtainable, my lamp and candle-wick material was requisitioned by F----  (who, by the way, is a perfect Uhlan for getting what he wants, when  bent on a sporting expedition); and lastly, one or two empty flour-sacks  were called for. You will see the use of this heterogeneous collection  presently.    It was of no use starting until the twilight had darkened into a cloudy,  moonless night; so, after our seven o'clock supper, we adjourned into  the verandah to watch F---- make a large round ball, such as children  play with, out of the scraps of worsted with which I had furnished him.  Instead of cutting the wool into lengths, however, it was left in loops;  and I learned that this is done to afford a firm hold for the sharp  needle-like teeth of an inquisitive eel, who might be tempted to find  out if this strange round thing, floating near his hole, would be  good to eat. I was impatient as a child,--remember it was my first  eel-fishing expedition,--and I thought nine o'clock would never come,  for I had been told to go and dress at that hour; that is to say, I was  to change my usual station-costume, a pretty print gown, for a short  linsey skirt, strong boots and kangaroo-skin gaiters. F----, and our  cadet, Mr. U----, soon appeared, clad in shooting coats instead of their  alpaca costumes, and their trousers stuffed into enormous boots, the  upper leathers of which came beyond their knees.    \"Are we going into the water?\" I timidly inquired.    \"Oh, no,--not at all: it is on account of the Spaniards.\"    No doubt this sounds very unintelligible to an English reader; but every  colonist who may chance to see my pages will shiver at the recollection  of those vegetable defenders of an unexplored region in New Zealand.  Imagine a gigantic artichoke with slender instead of broad leaves, set  round in dense compact order. They vary, of course, in size, but in our  part of the world four or six feet in circumference and a couple of feet  high was the usual growth to which they attained, though at the back of  the run they were much larger. Spaniards grow in clusters, or patches,  among the tussocks on the plains, and constitute a most unpleasant  feature of the vegetation of the country. Their leaves are as firm as  bayonets, and taper at the point to the fineness of a needle, but are  not nearly so easily broken as a needle would be. No horse will face  them, preferring a jump at the cost of any exertion, to the risk of a  stab from the cruel points. The least touch of this green bayonet draws  blood, and a fall _into_ a Spaniard is a thing to be remembered all  one's life. Interspersed with the Spaniards are generally clumps of  \"wild Irishman,\" a straggling sturdy bramble, ready to receive and  scratch you well if you attempt to avoid the Spaniard's weapons.  Especially detrimental to riding habits are wild Irishmen; and there are  fragments of mine, of all sorts of materials and colours, fluttering now  on their thorny branches in out-of-the-way places on our run. It is  not surprising, therefore, that we guarded our legs as well as we could  against these foes to flesh and blood.    \"We are rather early,\" said the gentlemen, as I appeared, ready and  eager to start; \"but perhaps it is all the better to enable you to see  the track.\" They each flung an empty sack over their shoulders, felt in  their pockets to ascertain whether the matches, hooks, boxes of bait,  etc., were all there, and then we set forth.    At first it appeared as if we had stepped from the brightness of the  drawing-room into utter and pitchy blackness; but after we had  groped for a few steps down the familiar garden path, our eyes became  accustomed to the subdued light of the soft summer night. Although heavy  banks of cloud,--the general precursors of wind,--were moving slowly  between us and the heavens, the stars shone down through their rifts,  and on the western horizon a faint yellowish tinge told us that daylight  was in no hurry to leave our quiet valley. The mountain streams or  creeks, which water so well the grassy plains among the Malvern Hills,  are not affected to any considerable extent by dry summer weather. They  are snow-fed from the high ranges, and each nor'-wester restores many a  glacier or avalanche to its original form, and sends it flowing down the  steep sides of yonder distant beautiful mountains to join the creeks,  which, like a tangled skein of silver threads, ensure a good water  supply to the New Zealand sheep-farmer. In the holes, under steep  overhanging banks, the eels love to lurk, hiding from the sun's rays in  cool depths, and coming out at night to feed. There are no fish whatever  in the rivers, and I fear that the labours of the Acclimatization  Society will be thrown away until they can persuade the streams  themselves to remain in their beds like more civilised waters. At  present not a month passes that one does not hear of some eccentric  proceeding on the part of either rivers or creeks. Unless the fish are  prepared to shift their liquid quarters at a moment's notice they will  find themselves often left high and dry on the deserted shingle-bed. But  eels are proverbially accustomed to adapt themselves to circumstances,  and a fisherman may always count on getting some if he be patient.    About a mile down the flat, between very high banks, our principal creek  ran, and to a quiet spot among the flax-bushes we directed our steps.  By the fast-fading light the gentlemen set their lines in very primitive  fashion. On the crumbling, rotten earth the New Zealand flax, the  _Phormium tenax_, loves to grow, and to its long, ribbon-like leaves the  eel-fishers fastened their lines securely, baiting each alternate hook  with mutton and worms. I declared this was too cockney a method of  fishing, and selected a tall slender flax-stick, the stalk of last  year's spike of red honey-filled blossoms, and to this extempore rod I  fastened my line and bait. When one considers that the old whalers were  accustomed to use ropes made in the rudest fashion, from the fibre of  this very plant, in their deep-sea fishing for very big prey, it is  not surprising that we found it sufficiently strong for our purpose. I  picked out, therefore, a comfortable spot,--that is to say,"]]]
