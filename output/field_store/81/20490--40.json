Yet, the picture was there. The ancient priest  who drew it must have placed it there for a definite purpose.    What could he have meant?    That was the riddle which Champollion finally solved.    He discovered that the Egyptians were the first people to use what we  call \"phonetic writing.\"    Like most other words which express a scientific idea, the word  \"phonetic\" is of Greek origin. It means the \"science of the sound which  is made by our speech.\" You have seen the Greek word \"phone,\" which  means the voice, before. It occurs in our word \"telephone,\" the machine  which carries the voice to a distant point.    Ancient Egyptian was \"phonetic\" and it set man free from the narrow  limits of that sign language which in some primitive form had been used  ever since the cave-dweller began to scratch pictures of wild animals  upon the walls of his home.    Now let us return for a moment to the little fellow with his saw who  suddenly appeared in the story of the old queen. Evidently he had  something to do with a saw.    A \"saw\" is either a tool which you find in a carpenter shop or it means  the past tense of the verb \"to see.\"    This is what had happened to the word during the course of many  centuries.    First of all it had meant a man with a saw.    Then it came to mean the sound which we reproduce by the three modern  letters, s, a and w. In the end the original meaning of carpentering was  lost entirely and the picture indicated the past tense of \"to see.\"    A modern English sentence done into the images of ancient Egypt will  show you what I mean.    [Illustration: eye bee leaf eye saw giraffe]    The [Illustration: eye] means either these two round objects in your  head which allow you to see, or it means \"I,\" the person who is talking  or writing.    A [Illustration: bee] is either an animal which gathers honey and pricks  you in the finger when you try to catch it, or it represents to verb \"to  be,\" which is pronounced the same way and which means to \"exist.\" Again  it may be the first part of a verb like \"be-come\" or \"be-have.\" In this  case the bee is followed by a [Illustration: leaf] which represents the  sound which we find in the word \"leave\" or \"leaf.\" Put your \"bee\" and  your \"leaf\" together and you have the two sounds which make the verb  \"bee-leave\" or \"believe\" as we write it nowadays.    The \"eye\" you know all about.    Finally you get a picture which looks like a giraffe. [Illustration:  Giraffe] It is a giraffe, and it is part of the old sign language, which  has been continued wherever it seemed most convenient.    Therefore you get the following sentence, \"I believe I saw a giraffe.\"    This system, once invented, was developed during thousands of years.    Gradually the most important figures came to mean single letters or  short sounds like \"fu\" or \"em\" or \"dee\" or \"zee,\" or as we write them, f  and m and d and z. And with the help of these, the Egyptians could write  anything they wanted upon every conceivable subject, and could preserve  the experience of one generation for the benefit of the next without the  slightest difficulty.    That, in a very general way, is what Champollion taught us after the  exhausting search which killed him when he was a young man.    That too, is the reason why today we know Egyptian history better than  that of any other ancient country.        THE LAND OF THE LIVING AND THE LAND OF THE DEAD    The History of Man is the record of a hungry creature in search of food.    Wherever food was plentiful and easily gathered, thither man travelled  to make his home.    The fame of the Nile valley must have spread at an early date. From far  and wide, wild people flocked to the banks of the river. Surrounded on  all sides by desert or sea, it was not easy to reach these fertile  fields and only the hardiest men and women survived.    We do not know who they were. Some came from the interior of Africa and  had woolly hair and thick lips.    Others, with a yellowish skin, came from the desert of Arabia and the  broad rivers of western Asia.    They fought each other for the possession of this wonderful land.    They built villages which their neighbors destroyed and they rebuilt  them with the bricks they had taken from other neighbors whom they in  turn had vanquished.    Gradually a new race developed. They called themselves \"remi,\" which  means simply \"the Men.\" There was a touch of pride in this name and they  used it in the same sense that we refer to America as \"God's  own country.\"    Part of the year, during the annual flood of the Nile, they lived on  small islands within a country which itself was cut off from the rest of  the world by the sea and the desert. No wonder that these people were  what we call \"insular,\" and had the habits of villagers who rarely come  in contact with their neighbors.    They liked their own ways best. They thought their own habits and  customs just a trifle better than those of anybody else. In the same  way, their own gods were considered more powerful than the gods of other  nations. They did not exactly despise foreigners, but they felt a mild  pity for them and if possible they kept them outside of the Egyptian  domains, lest their own people be corrupted by \"foreign notions.\"    They were kind-hearted and rarely did anything that was cruel. They were  patient and in business dealings they were rather indifferent Life came  as an easy gift and they never became stingy and mean like northern  people who have to struggle for mere existence.    When the sun arose above the blood-red horizon of the distant desert,  they went forth to till their fields. When the last rays of light had  disappeared beyond the mountain ridges, they went to bed.    They worked hard, they plodded and they bore whatever happened with  stolid unconcern and profound patience.    They believed that this life was but a short preface to a new existence  which began the moment Death had entered the house. Until at last, the  life of the future came to be regarded as more important than the life  of the present and the people of Egypt turned their teeming land into  one vast shrine for the worship of the dead.    [Illustration: THE LAND OF THE DEAD.]    And as most of the papyrus-rolls of the ancient valley tell stories of a  religious nature we know with great accuracy just what gods the  Egyptians revered and how they tried to assure all possible happiness  and comfort to those who had entered upon the eternal sleep. In the  beginning each little village had possessed a god of its own.    Often this god was supposed to reside in a queerly shaped stone or in  the branch of a particularly large tree. It was well to be good friends  with him for he could do great harm and destroy the harvest and prolong  the period of drought until the people and the cattle had all died of  thirst. Therefore the villages made him presents--offered him things to  eat or a bunch of flowers.    When the Egyptians went forth to fight their enemies the god must needs  be taken along, until he became a sort of battle flag around which the  people rallied in time of danger.    But when the country grew older and better roads had been built and the  Egyptians had begun to travel, the old \"fetishes,\" as such chunks of  stone and wood were called, lost their importance and were thrown away  or were left in a neglected corner or were used as doorsteps or chairs.    Their place was taken by new gods who were more powerful than the old  ones had been and who represented those forces of nature which  influenced the lives of the Egyptians of the entire valley.    First among these was the Sun which makes all things grow.    Next came the river Nile which tempered the heat of the day and brought  rich deposits of clay to refresh the fields and make them fertile.    Then there was the kindly Moon which at night rowed her little boat  across the arch of heaven and there was Thunder and there was Lightning  and there were any number of things which could make life happy or  miserable according to their pleasure and desire.    Ancient man, entirely at the mercy of these forces of nature, could not  get rid of them as easily as we do when we plant lightning rods upon our  houses or build reservoirs which keep us alive during the summer months  when there is no rain.    On the contrary they formed an intimate part of his daily life--they  accompanied him from the moment he was put into his cradle until the day  that his body was prepared for eternal rest.    Neither could he imagine that such vast and powerful phenomena as a bolt  of lightning or the flood of a river were mere impersonal things. Some  one--somewhere--must be their master and must direct them as the  engineer directs his engine or a captain steers his ship.    A God-in-Chief was therefore created, like the commanding general of an  army.    A number of lower officers were placed at his disposal.    Within their own territory each one could act independently.    In grave matters, however, which affected the happiness of all the  people, they must take orders from their master.    The Supreme Divine Ruler of the land of Egypt was called Osiris, and all  the little Egyptian children knew the story of his wonderful life.    Once upon a time, in the valley of the Nile, there lived a king called  Osiris.    He was a good man who taught his subjects how to till their fields and  who gave his country just laws. But he had a bad brother whose name  was Seth.    Now Seth envied Osiris because he was so virtuous and one day he invited  him to dinner and afterwards he said that he would like to show him  something. Curious Osiris asked what it was and Seth said that it was a  funnily shaped coffin which fitted one like a suit of clothes. Osiris  said that he would like to try it. So he lay down in the coffin but no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10002"],[0,"The House on the Borderland (#6)"],[1,"upon me that it was now close upon the morning of  the twenty-second, and that I had been unconscious to the visible world  through the greater portion of the last twenty-four hours. The thought  occupied my attention for a full minute; then I commenced to eat again.  I was still very hungry.    During breakfast, next morning, I inquired casually of my sister  regarding the date, and found my surmise correct. I had, indeed, been  absent--at least in spirit--for nearly a day and a night.    My sister asked me no questions; for it is not by any means the first  time that I have kept to my study for a whole day, and sometimes a  couple of days at a time, when I have been particularly engrossed in my  books or work.    And so the days pass on, and I am still filled with a wonder to know  the meaning of all that I saw on that memorable night. Yet, well I know  that my curiosity is little likely to be satisfied.        _V_    THE THING IN THE PIT    This house is, as I have said before, surrounded by a huge estate, and  wild and uncultivated gardens.    Away at the back, distant some three hundred yards, is a dark, deep  ravine--spoken of as the 'Pit,' by the peasantry. At the bottom runs a  sluggish stream so overhung by trees as scarcely to be seen from above.    In passing, I must explain that this river has a subterranean origin,  emerging suddenly at the East end of the ravine, and disappearing, as  abruptly, beneath the cliffs that form its Western extremity.    It was some months after my vision (if vision it were) of the great  Plain that my attention was particularly attracted to the Pit.    I happened, one day, to be walking along its Southern edge, when,  suddenly, several pieces of rock and shale were dislodged from the face  of the cliff immediately beneath me, and fell with a sullen crash  through the trees. I heard them splash in the river at the bottom; and  then silence. I should not have given this incident more than a passing  thought, had not Pepper at once begun to bark savagely; nor would he be  silent when I bade him, which is most unusual behavior on his part.    Feeling that there must be someone or something in the Pit, I went back  to the house, quickly, for a stick. When I returned, Pepper had ceased  his barks and was growling and smelling, uneasily, along the top.    Whistling to him to follow me, I started to descend cautiously. The  depth to the bottom of the Pit must be about a hundred and fifty feet,  and some time as well as considerable care was expended before we  reached the bottom in safety.    Once down, Pepper and I started to explore along the banks of the  river. It was very dark there due to the overhanging trees, and I moved  warily, keeping my glance about me and my stick ready.    Pepper was quiet now and kept close to me all the time. Thus, we  searched right up one side of the river, without hearing or seeing  anything. Then, we crossed over--by the simple method of jumping--and  commenced to beat our way back through the underbrush.    We had accomplished perhaps half the distance, when I heard again the  sound of falling stones on the other side--the side from which we had  just come. One large rock came thundering down through the treetops,  struck the opposite bank, and bounded into the river, driving a great  jet of water right over us. At this, Pepper gave out a deep growl; then  stopped, and pricked up his ears. I listened, also.    A second later, a loud, half-human, half-piglike squeal sounded from  among the trees, apparently about halfway up the South cliff. It was  answered by a similar note from the bottom of the Pit. At this, Pepper  gave a short, sharp bark, and, springing across the little river,  disappeared into the bushes.    Immediately afterward, I heard his barks increase in depth and number,  and in between there sounded a noise of confused jabbering. This ceased,  and, in the succeeding silence, there rose a semi-human yell of agony.  Almost immediately, Pepper gave a long-drawn howl of pain, and then the  shrubs were violently agitated, and he came running out with his tail  down, and glancing as he ran over his shoulder. As he reached me, I saw  that he was bleeding from what appeared to be a great claw wound in the  side that had almost laid bare his ribs.    Seeing Pepper thus mutilated, a furious feeling of anger seized me,  and, whirling my staff, I sprang across, and into the bushes from which  Pepper had emerged. As I forced my way through, I thought I heard a  sound of breathing. Next instant, I had burst into a little clear space,  just in time to see something, livid white in color, disappear among the  bushes on the opposite side. With a shout, I ran toward it; but, though  I struck and probed among the bushes with my stick, I neither saw nor  heard anything further; and so returned to Pepper. There, after bathing  his wound in the river, I bound my wetted handkerchief 'round his body;  having done which, we retreated up the ravine and into the  daylight again.    On reaching the house, my sister inquired what had happened to Pepper,  and I told her he had been fighting with a wildcat, of which I had heard  there were several about.    I felt it would be better not to tell her how it had really happened;  though, to be sure, I scarcely knew myself; but this I did know, that  the thing I had seen run into the bushes was no wildcat. It was much too  big, and had, so far as I had observed, a skin like a hog's, only of a  dead, unhealthy white color. And then--it had run upright, or nearly so,  upon its hind feet, with a motion somewhat resembling that of a human  being. This much I had noticed in my brief glimpse, and, truth to tell,  I felt a good deal of uneasiness, besides curiosity as I turned the  matter over in my mind.    It was in the morning that the above incident had occurred.    Then, it would be after dinner, as I sat reading, that, happening to  look up suddenly, I saw something peering in over the window ledge the  eyes and ears alone showing.    'A pig, by Jove!' I said, and rose to my feet. Thus, I saw the thing  more completely; but it was no pig--God alone knows what it was. It  reminded me, vaguely, of the hideous Thing that had haunted the great  arena. It had a grotesquely human mouth and jaw; but with no chin of  which to speak. The nose was prolonged into a snout; thus it was that  with the little eyes and queer ears, gave it such an extraordinarily  swinelike appearance. Of forehead there was little, and the whole face  was of an unwholesome white color.    For perhaps a minute, I stood looking at the thing with an ever growing  feeling of disgust, and some fear. The mouth kept jabbering, inanely,  and once emitted a half-swinish grunt. I think it was the eyes that  attracted me the most; they seemed to glow, at times, with a horribly  human intelligence, and kept flickering away from my face, over the  details of the room, as though my stare disturbed it.    It appeared to be supporting itself by two clawlike hands upon the  windowsill. These claws, unlike the face, were of a clayey brown hue,  and bore an indistinct resemblance to human hands, in that they had four  fingers and a thumb; though these were webbed up to the first joint,  much as are a duck's. Nails it had also, but so long and powerful that  they were more like the talons of an eagle than aught else.    As I have said, before, I felt some fear; though almost of an  impersonal kind. I may explain my feeling better by saying that it was  more a sensation of abhorrence; such as one might expect to feel, if  brought in contact with something superhumanly foul; something  unholy--belonging to some hitherto undreamt of state of existence.    I cannot say that I grasped these various details of the brute at the  time. I think they seemed to come back to me, afterward, as though  imprinted upon my brain. I imagined more than I saw as I looked at the  thing, and the material details grew upon me later.    For perhaps a minute I stared at the creature; then as my nerves  steadied a little I shook off the vague alarm that held me, and took a  step toward the window. Even as I did so, the thing ducked and vanished.  I rushed to the door and looked 'round hurriedly; but only the tangled  bushes and shrubs met my gaze.    I ran back into the house, and, getting my gun, sallied out to search  through the gardens. As I went, I asked myself whether the thing I had  just seen was likely to be the same of which I had caught a glimpse in  the morning. I inclined to think it was.    I would have taken Pepper with me; but judged it better to give his  wound a chance to heal. Besides, if the creature I had just seen was, as  I imagined, his antagonist of the morning, it was not likely that he  would be of much use.    I began my search, systematically. I was determined, if it were  possible, to find and put an end to that swine-thing. This was, at  least, a material Horror!    At first, I searched, cautiously; with the thought of Pepper's wound in  my mind; but, as the hours passed, and not a sign of anything living,  showed in the great, lonely gardens, I became less apprehensive. I felt  almost as though I would welcome the sight of it. Anything seemed better  than this silence, with the ever-present feeling that the creature might  be lurking in every bush I passed. Later, I grew careless of danger, to  the extent of plunging right through the bushes, probing with my gun  barrel as I went.    At times, I shouted; but only the echoes answered back. I thought thus  perhaps to frighten or stir the creature to showing itself; but only  succeeded in bringing my sister Mary out, to know what was the matter. I  told her, that I had seen the wildcat that had wounded Pepper, and that  I was trying to hunt it out of the bushes. She seemed only half  satisfied, and went back into the house, with an expression of doubt  upon her face. I wondered whether she had seen or"]]]
