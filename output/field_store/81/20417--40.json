The abundant  pecuniary means which the priests have at command, and the imposing and  attractive ceremonies of their mode of worship--so well fitted to produce  an effect on uncultivated natures, where appeals either to the intellect  or the heart would be thrown away--are among the chief causes of their  success. It is said, too, and perhaps with truth, that as many converts  are made, among the natives, by presents, as by persuasion. But no small  degree of the prosperity of the mission must be attributed to the superior  shrewdness and ability of the persons engaged in it--to their skilful  adaptation of their precepts and modes of instruction to the people with  whom they have to deal, and to their employment of the maxims of worldly  policy in aid of their religious views. These qualities and rules of  conduct have characterized the Catholic missionaries in all ages, in all  parts of the world, and in their dealings with every variety of the human  race; and their success has everywhere been commensurate with the  superiority, in a merely temporal point of view, of the system on which  they acted.    Before returning on board, we called on King Freeman, who received us,  seated on a chair which was placed in front of his house. His majesty's  royal robe was no other than an old uniform frock, which I had given him  three years ago. We accepted the chairs which he offered us, and held a  palaver, while some twenty of his subjects stood respectfully around. He  remembered my former visit to the colony, and appeared very glad to see me  again. His town was nearly deserted, the people having gone out to gather  rice. About the royal residence, and in the vicinity, I saw thirty or  forty cattle, most of them young, and all remarkably small. It is said,  and I believe it to be a fact, that cattle, and even fowls, when brought  from the interior, take the coast-fever, and often perish with it. Certain  it is that they do not flourish.    11.--King Freeman came on board, dressed in his uniform frock, with two  epaulettes, a redcap, and checked trowsers. He received some powder and  bread from the Commodore, and some trifles from the ward-room.    12.--Joe Davis brought his son on board to \"learn sense.\" In pursuit of  this laudable object, the young man is to make a cruise with us. The  father particularly requested that his son might be flogged, saying,  \"Spose you lick him, you gib him sense!\" On such a system, a man-of-war is  certainly no bad school of improvement.    13.--A delightful day, clear sky, and cool breeze. We sailed from Cape  Palmas yesterday, steering up the coast.    I have been conversing with young Ben Johnson, one of our Kroomen, on the  conjugal and other customs of his countrymen. These constitute quite a  curious object of research. The Kroomen are indispensable in carrying on  the commerce and maritime business of the African coast. When a Kroo-boat  comes alongside, you may buy the canoe, hire the men at a moment's  warning, and retain them in your service for months. They expend no time  nor trouble in providing their equipment, since it consists merely of a  straw hat and a piece of white or colored cotton girded about their loins.  In their canoes, they deposit these girdles in the crowns of their hats;  nor is it unusual, when a shower threatens them on shore, to see them  place this sole garment in the same convenient receptacle, and then make  for shelter. When rowing a boat, or paddling a canoe, it is their custom  to sing; and, as the music goes on, they seem to become invigorated,  applying their strength cheerfully, and with limbs as unwearied as their  voices. One of their number leads in recitative, and the whole company  respond in the chorus. The subject of the song is a recital of the  exploits of the men, their employments, their intended movements, the news  of the coast, and the character of their employers. It is usual, in these  extemporary strains, for the Kroomen attached to a man-of-war to taunt,  with good-humored satire, their friends who are more laboriously employed  in merchant vessels, and not so well fed and paid.    Their object in leaving home, and entering into the service of navigators,  is generally to obtain the means of purchasing wives, the number of whom  constitutes a man's importance. The sons of \"gentlemen\" (for there is such  a distinction of rank among them) never labor at home, but do not hesitate  to go away, for a year or two, and earn something to take to their  families. On the return of these wanderers--not like the prodigal son, but  bringing wealth to their kindred--great rejoicings are instituted. A  bullock is killed by the head of the family, guns are fired, and two or  three days are spent in the performance of various plays and dances. The  \"boy\" gives all his earnings to his father, and places himself again under  the parental authority. The Krooman of maturer age, on his return from an  expedition of this kind, buys a wife, or perhaps more than one, and  distributes the rest of his accumulated gains among his relatives. In a  week, he has nothing left but his wives and his house.    Age is more respected by the Africans than by any other people. Even if  the son be forty years old, he seldom seeks to emancipate himself from the  paternal government. If a young man falls in love, he, in the first place,  consults his father. The latter makes propositions to the damsel's father,  who, if his daughter agree to the match, announces the terms of purchase.  The price varies in different places, and is also influenced by other  circumstances, such as the respectability and power of the family, and the  beauty and behavior of the girl. The arrangements here described are often  made when the girl is only five or six years of age, in which case she  remains with her friends until womanhood, and then goes to the house of  her bridegroom.     Meantime, her family receive the stipulated price, and are responsible  for her good behavior. Should she prove faithless, and run away, her  purchase-money must be refunded by her friends, who, in their turn, have a  claim upon the family of him who seduces or harbors her. If prompt  satisfaction be not made (which, however, is generally the case), there  will be a \"big palaver,\" and a much heavier expense for damages and costs.  If, after the commencement of married life, the husband is displeased with  his wife's conduct, he complains to her father, who either takes her back,  and repays the dowry, or more frequently advises that she be flogged. In  the latter alternative, she is tied, starved, and severely beaten; a mode  of conjugal discipline which generally produces the desired effect.    Should the wife be suspected of infidelity, the husband may charge her  with it, and demand that she drink the poisonous decoction of sassy-wood,  which is used as the test of guilt or innocence, in all cases that are  considered too uncertain for human judgment. If her stomach free itself  from the fatal draught by vomiting, she is declared innocent, and is taken  back by her family without repayment of the dower. On the other hand, if  the poison begin to take effect, she is pronounced guilty; an emetic is  administered in the shape of common soap; and her husband may, at his  option, either send her home, or cut off her nose and ears.    There is one sad discrepancy in the moral system of these people, as  regards the virtue of the women. No disgrace is imputed to the wife who  admits the immoral advances of a white man, provided it be done with the  knowledge and consent of her husband. The latter, in whose eyes the white  man is one of a distinct and superior order of beings, usually considers  himself honored by an affair of this nature, and makes it likewise a  matter of profit. All proposals, in view of such a connection, must pass  through the husband; nor, it is affirmed, is there any hazard of wounding  his delicacy, or awakening his resentment, whatever be his rank and  respectability. The violated wife returns to the domestic roof with  undiminished honor, and confines herself as rigidly within the limits of  her nuptial vow, as if this singular suspension of it had never taken  place.     In spite of the degradation indicated by the above customs, the  Kroo-women are rather superior to other native females, and seem to occupy  a higher social position. The wife first married holds the purse, directs  the household affairs, and rules the other women, who labor diligently for  the benefit of their common husband and master. Their toil constitutes his  wealth. It is usual for a man to live two, three, or four days, with each  of his wives in turn. As old age advances, he loses the control of his  female household, most of the members of which run away, unless he is wise  enough to dispose of them (as usage permits) to his more youthful  relatives. As a Krooman of sixty or seventy often has wives in their  teens, it is not to be wondered at that they should occasionally show a  disposition to rove.          CHAPTER IV.

An English merchant brig was at anchor. Our pilot observed,  that this settlement was not in a flourishing condition, because it  received no great \"_resistance_\" from the Colonization Society. Of  course, he meant to say, \"_assistance_;\" but there was an unintentional  philosophy in the remark.

His idea is that, should we appear to be approaching a steamer  which he wishes to avoid, in many cases, by shining a little more or  less red and green light, we can make her think that we are a steamer  on such a course that it is her duty by the rules of the road to keep  clear of us.    He tells me it has worked on several occasions, and he has also found  it useful to have two small auxiliary side lights fitted which are the  wrong colours for the sides they are on. It is, of course, only neutral  shipping which carry lights nowadays, though Alten says that many  British ships are still incredibly careless in the matter of lights.    However, to resume my account of what happened. We reached our position  at dawn or slightly after, the weather was beautifully calm and the sea  like glass. As we were only three miles from the English coast, and  close to the mouth of the Tyne, we were extraordinarily lucky to have  nothing in sight, if one excepts a long smudge of smoke which trailed  across the horizon to the southward.    The land itself was obscured by early morning banks of mist, yet  everything was so still that we actually faintly heard the whistle of a  train. I could hardly restrain from suggesting to Alten that we should  elevate the 10-cm. gun to fifteen degrees and fire a few rounds on to  \"proud Albion's virgin shores,\" but I did not do so as I felt fairly  certain that he would not approve, and I do not wish to lay myself open  to rebuffs from him after his behaviour concerning the smoking  incident. I boil with rage at the thought, but again I digress.    The fact that the land was obscured was favourable from the point of  view that we were not worried by coast watchers, but unfavourable from  the standpoint that we were unable to take bearings of anything and so  ascertain our exact position.    The importance of this point in submarine mine-laying is obvious, for,  owing to our small cargo of eggs, it is quite possible that we may be  sent here again, to lay an adjacent field, in which case it is highly  desirable to know the exact position of one's previous effort.    [Illustration: \"Steering north-westerly...; to lay a small minefield  off Newcastle.\"]    [Illustration: \"He had suddenly seen the bow waves of a destroyer  approaching at full speed to ram.\"]    We were somewhat assisted in our efforts to locate ourselves by the  fact that a seven-fathom patch existed exactly where we had to lay. We  picked up the edge of this bank with our sounding machine, and steering  north half a mile, laid our mines in latitude--No! on second thoughts I  will omit the precise position, for, though I shall take every  precaution, there is no saying that through some misfortune this  Journal might not get into the wrong hands.    I am very glad I decided to keep these notes, as I shall take much  pleasure in reading them when Victory crowns our efforts and the joys  of a peaceful life return.    I found it a delightful sensation being so close to the enemy coast, in  his territorial waters, in fact. For the first time since the Skajerack  battle I experienced the personal joys of war, the sensation of  intimate and successful contact with the enemy, and the most hated  enemy at that.    We had hardly finished laying our eggs when a droning noise was heard.  With marvellous celerity we dived, that damned fellow Alten, who, under  these circumstances leaves the bridge last, treading on my fingers as  he followed me down the conning tower ladder.    The engineer endeavoured to sympathize with me, and made some idiotic  remark about my being quicker when I had had more practice. I bit his  head off. I can't stand this hail-fellow-well-met attitude in these  U.C. boats, from any lout dressed in an officer's uniform. They  wouldn't be holding commissions if it wasn't for the war, and they  should remember that fact. I suppose they think I'm stand-offish. Well,  if they had my family tree behind them they would understand.    We dived to sixty feet, and then came up to twenty. Alten looked  through the periscope, and then invited me to look. Curiosity impelled  me to accept this favour and, putting the focussing lever to  \"skyscrape\" I swept round the sky.    At last I saw him; he was a small gas-bag of diminutive size, beneath  which was suspended a little car, the most ridiculous little travesty  of an airship I have ever seen. He was nosing along at about 800 feet  and making about 40 knots.    Suddenly he must have seen the wake of our periscope, for he turned  towards us. Simultaneously Alten, from the conning tower (I was using  the other periscope in the control room), ordered the boat to sixty  feet, and put the helm hard over.    We had turned sixteen points, [1] and in about two minutes heard a  series of reports right astern of us. It was evident that our ruse had  succeeded and that he had overshot the mark.    [Footnote 1: 180 deg.]    Inside the boat one felt a slight jar as each bomb went off.    We gradually came round to our proper course, and cruised all day  submerged at dead slow speed. Every time we lifted our periscope he was  still hanging about sufficiently close to make it foolish for us to  come to the surface.    Towards noon a group of trawlers, doubtless summoned by wireless,  appeared, and proceeded to wander about. These seemed to concern Alten  far more than the airship, and he informed me that from their, to me,  aimless movements he deduced they were hunting for us by hydroplanes.  Occasionally we lay on the bottom in nineteen fathoms.    By 4 p.m. the atmosphere was becoming rather unpleasant and hot, and  gradually we took off more clothes. Curiously enough, I longed for a  smoke, but wild horses would not have made me ask Alten for permission.    At 8 p.m. it was sufficiently dark to enable us to rise, which gave me  great pleasure, though the first rush of fresh air down the hatch made  me vomit after hours of breathing the vitiated muck. On coming to the  surface we saw nothing in sight, but a breeze had sprung up which  caused spray to break over the bridge as we chugged along at 9 knots.    Everyone was in high spirits, as always on the return journey, when the  mind turns to the Fatherland and all it holds.    My mind turns to Zoe. I confess it to myself frankly. I hardly realized  to what extent this woman had begun to influence me until we received  the wireless signal ordering us to delay entering for twelve hours. The  receipt of this news, trivial though the delay has been, threw a mantle  of gloom over the crew. I participated in the depression and, upon  thought, rather wondered that this should be so. Self-analysis on the  lines laid down by Schessmanweil [1] revealed to me that the basis of  my annoyance is the fact that my next meeting with Zoe is deferred! I  feel instinctively that I shall have trouble here, and that I had  better haul off a lee shore whilst there is manoeuvring room, and  yet--and yet I secretly rejoice that every revolution of the propeller,  every clank and rattle of the Diesels brings us closer together.    [Footnote 1: Apparently some German author, of obscure origin, as I  cannot find him in any book of reference.--ETIENNE.]    Alten has just come down from the bridge, and we chatted for some  moments; it is evident that he wishes to apologize for his rudeness  over the smoking incident.    I was in error, I admit it frankly; at the same time I did not know  that the battery was on charge, and to dash a match from my hand! I  could have shot him where he stood. However, I am not vindictive, and  as far as I am concerned the incident is ended.    One thing I find trying in this small boat, and that is that I can  find no space in which to do half my Mueller exercises, the  leg-and-arm-swinging ones. I must see whether I can't invent a set of  U-boat exercises!    Good! in two hours we reach the Mole-end light buoy.           *       *       *       *       *    _Submarine Mess, Bruges._      It is midnight, and as I write in my room at the top of the house the  low rumble of the guns from the south-west vibrates faintly through the  open window, for it is extraordinarily warm for the time of year, and I  have flung back the curtains and risked the light shining.    We spent the night at Zeebrugge and came up to the docks here next day.  We shall probably be in for a week, and I am on four days' \"extended  absence from the boat,\" which practically means that I can go where I  like in the neighbourhood provided I am handy to a telephone.    After a short inward struggle I rang Zoe up on the telephone;  fortunately I did not call first.    A man's voice answered, and for a moment I was dumbfounded. I guessed  at once it was the Colonel, and I had counted so confidently on his  being still away at the front.    For an instant I felt speechless, an impulse came to me to ring off  without further ado, but I restrained myself, and then a fine idea came  into my head.    \"Who is that?\" I said.    \"Colonel Stein!\" replied the voice, and my fears were confirmed, but my  plan of campaign held good.    \"I am speaking,\" I continued, \"on behalf of Lieutenant Von  Schenk----\"    \"Ah, yes!\" growled the voice, and for an instant a panic seized me, but  I resumed:    \"He met Madame Stein at dinner some days ago, and she kindly asked him  to call; he has asked me to ring up and inquire when it would be  convenient, as he would like to meet you, sir, as well. He has been  unable to ring up himself, as he was sent away from Bruges on duty  early this morning.\"    I smiled to myself at this little lie and listened.    \"Your friend had better call to-morrow then, for I leave to-morrow  evening for the Somme front; will you tell him?\"    I replied that I would, and left the telephone well "]]]
