[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8537"],[0,"Lonesome Land (#5)"],[1,"a simple  thing; and for two healthy young people with full use of their wits and  their legs to steal quietly away to where those horses are waiting  would seem quite as simple. At the same time, to prevent the successful  accomplishment of these things is not difficult, if one but fully  understands the designs of the fugitives.    Hawley Hotel did a flourishing business that night. The two long tables in  the dining room, usually not more than half filled by those who hungered  and were not over-nice concerning the food they ate, were twice filled to  overflowing. Mrs. Hawley and the \"breed\" girl held hasty consultations in  the kitchen over the supply, and never was there such a rattling of dishes  hurriedly cleansed for the next comer.    Kent managed to find a chair at the first table, and eyed the landlady  unobtrusively. But Fred De Garmo sat down opposite, and his eyes were  bright and watchful, so that there seemed no possible way of delivering a  message undetected--until, indeed, Mrs. Hawley in desperation resorted to  strategy, and urged Kent unnecessarily to take another slice of bacon.    \"Have some more--it's _side_!\" she hissed in his ear, and watched anxiously  his face.    \"All right,\" said Kent, and speared a slice with his fork, although his  plate was already well supplied with bacon. Then, glancing up, he detected  Fred in a thoughtful stare which seemed evenly divided between the landlady  and himself. Kent was conscious of a passing, mental discomfort, which he  put aside as foolish, because De Garmo could not possibly know what Mrs.  Hawley meant. To ease his mind still further he glared insolently at Fred,  and then at Polycarp Jenks _te-hee_ing a few chairs away. After that he  finished as quickly as possible without exciting remark, and went his way.    He had not, however, been two minutes in the office before De Garmo  entered. From that time on through the whole evening Fred was never far  distant; wherever he went, Kent could not shake him off though De Garmo  never seemed to pay any attention to him, and his presence was always  apparently accidental.    \"I reckon I'll have to lick that son of a gun yet,\" sighed Kent, when a  glance at the round clock in the hotel office told him that in just twenty  minutes it would strike nine; and not a move made toward getting those  horses saddled and out to the stockyards.    There was much talk of the wedding, which had taken place quietly in the  parlor at the appointed hour, but not a man mentioned a _charivari_. There  were many who wished openly that Fleetwood would come out and be sociable  about it, but not a hint that they intended to take measures to bring him  among them. He had caused a box of cigars to be placed upon the bar of  every saloon in town, where men might help themselves at his expense.  Evidently he had considered that with the cigars his social obligations  were canceled. They smoked the cigars, and, with the same breath, gossiped  of him and his affairs.    At just fourteen minutes to nine Kent went out, and, without any attempt  at concealment, hurried to the Hawley stables. Half a minute behind him  trailed De Garmo, also without subterfuge.    Half an hour later the bridal couple stole away from the rear of the hotel,  and, keeping to the shadows, went stumbling over the uneven ground to the  stockyards.    \"Here's the tie pile,\" Fleetwood announced, in an undertone, when they  reached the place. \"You stay here, Val, and I'll look farther along the  fence; maybe the horses are down there.\"    Valeria did not reply, but stood very straight and dignified in the shadow  of the huge pile of rotting railroad ties. He was gone but a moment, and  came anxiously back to her.    \"They're not here,\" he said, in a low voice. \"Don't worry, dear. He'll  come--I know Kent Burnett.\"    \"Are you sure?\" queried Val sweetly. \"From what I have seen of the  gentleman, your high estimate of him seems quite unauthorized. Aside from  escorting me to the hotel, he has been anything but reliable. Instead of  telling you that I was here, or telling me that you were sick, he went  straight into a saloon and forgot all about us both. You know that. If he  were your friend, why should he immediately begin carousing, instead of--\"    \"He didn't,\" Fleetwood defended weakly.    \"No? Then perhaps you can explain his behavior. Why didn't he tell me you  were sick? Why didn't he tell you I came on that train? Can you tell me  that, Manley?\"    Manley, for a very good reason, could not; so he put his arms around her  and tried to coax her into good humor.    \"Sweetheart, let's not quarrel so soon--why, we're only two hours married!  I want you to be happy, and if you'll only be brave and--\"    \"Brave!\" Mrs. Fleetwood laughed rather contemptuously, for a bride. \"Please  to understand, Manley, that I'm not frightened in the least. It's you and  that horrid cowboy--_I_ don't see why we need run away, like criminals.  Those men don't intend to _murder_ us, do they?\" Her mood softened a  little, and she squeezed his arm between her hands. \"You dear old silly,  I'm not blaming _you_. With your head in such a state, you can't think  things out properly, and you let that cowboy influence you against your  better judgment. You're afraid I might be annoyed--but, really, Manley,  this silly idea of running away annoys me much more than all the noise  those fellows could possibly make. Indeed, I don't think I would mind--it  would give me a glimpse of the real West; and, perhaps, if they grew  too boisterous, and I spoke to them and asked them not to be quite so  rough--and, really, they only mean it as a sort of welcome, in their crude  way. We could invite some of the nicest in to have cake and coffee--or  maybe we might get some ice cream somewhere--and it might turn out a very  pleasant little affair. I don't mind meeting them, Manley. The worst of  them can't be as bad as that--but, of course, if he's your friend, I  suppose I oughtn't to speak too freely my opinion of him!\"    Fleetwood held her closely, patted her cheek absently, and tried to think  of some effective argument.    \"They'll be drunk, sweetheart,\" he told her, after a silence.    \"I don't think so,\" she returned firmly. \"I have been watching the street  all the evening. I saw any number of men passing back and forth, and I  didn't see one who staggered. And they were all very quiet, considering  their rough ways, which one must expect. Why, Manley, you always wrote  about these Western men being such fine fellows, and so generous and  big-hearted, under their rough exterior. Your letters were full of it--and  how chivalrous they all are toward nice women.\"    She laid her head coaxingly against his shoulder. \"Let's go back, Manley.  I--_want_ to see a _charivari_, dear. It will be fun. I want to write all  about it to the girls. They'll be perfectly wild with envy.\" She struggled  with her conventional upbringing. \"And even if some of them are slightly  under the influence--of liquor, we needn't _meet_ them. You needn't  introduce those at all, and I'm sure they will understand.\"    \"Don't be silly, Val!\" Fleetwood did not mean to be rude, but a faint  glimmer of her romantic viewpoint--a viewpoint gained chiefly from current  fiction and the stage--came to him and contrasted rather brutally with the  reality. He did not know how to make her understand, without incriminating  himself. His letters had been rather idealistic, he admitted to himself.  They had been written unthinkingly, because he wanted her to like this big  land; naturally he had not been too baldly truthful in picturing the place  and the people. He had passed lightly over their faults and thrown the  limelight on their virtues; and so he had aided unwittingly the stage and  the fiction she had read, in giving her a false impression.    Offended at his words and his tone, she drew away from him and glanced  wistfully back toward the town, as if she meditated a haughty return to the  hotel. She ended by seating herself upon a projecting tie.    \"Oh, very well, my lord,\" she retorted, \"I shall try and not be silly, but  merely idiotic, as you would have me. You and your friend!\" She was very  angry, but she was perfectly well-bred, she hoped. \"If I might venture a  word,\" she began again ironically, \"it seems to me that your friend has  been playing a practical joke upon you. He evidently has no intention of  bringing any fleet steeds to us. No doubt he is at this moment laughing  with his dissolute companions, because we are sitting out here in the dark  like two silly chickens!\"    \"I think he's coming now,\" Manley said rather stiffly. \"Of course, I don't  ask you to like him; but he's putting himself to a good deal of trouble for  us, and--\"    \"Wasted effort, so far as I am concerned,\" Valeria put in, with a chirpy  accent which was exasperating, even to a bridegroom very much in love with  his bride.    In the darkness that muffled the land, save where the yellow flare of lamps  in the little town made a misty brightness, came the click of shod hoofs.  Another moment and a man, mounted upon a white horse, loomed indistinct  before them, seeming to take substance from the night. Behind him trailed  another horse, and for the first time in her life Valeria heard the soft,  whispering creak of saddle leather, the faint clank of spur chains, and the  whir of a horse mouthing the \"cricket\" in his bit. Even in her anger, she  was conscious of an answering tingle of blood, because this was life in  the raw--life such as she had dreamed of in the tight swaddlings of a smug  civilization, and had longed for intensely.    Kent swung down close beside them, his form indistinct but purposeful. \"I'm  late, I guess,\" he remarked, turning to Fleetwood. \"Fred got next, somehow,  and--I was detained.\"    \"Where is he?\" asked Manley, going up and laying a questioning hand upon  the horse, by that means fully recognizing it as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8547"],[0,"Pirke Avot: The Sayings of the Jewish Fathers (#5)"],[1,"churer, _History_, I, ii, pp. 354-355).  On the        controversy regarding the existence of the Great Synagogue see        Schechter, _Studies_, II, 105-106.  Consult Taylor, _ibid._,        pp. 110-111; Graetz, _History of the Jews_, vol. I, p. 381,        394, vol. II, p. 19.  For further bibliography, see Strack,        _Spruche_, p. 11.  See especially Herford, _Pharisaism_. pp.        18-28.          (8) Take measures to prevent the breaking of any of the divine        precepts.  Thereby, certain things which are in themselves        lawful are prohibited in order to enforce the observance of        things the doing of which is unlawful.  Compare Leviticus        XVIII, 30, \"make a _mishmeret_ to my _mishmeret_\" (_Yabamot_,        21a), and _Abot_, III, 17, \"the _Massorah_ is a fence to the        _Torah_.\"    2. Simon, the Just (9), was of the last survivors of the Great  Synagogue.  He used to say, \"Upon three things the world rests: upon  the _Torah_, upon the Temple service (10), and upon the doing of acts  of kindness\" (11).          (9) Simon, the Just, son of Onias, was high-priest about 300        B.C.E.  See Josephus, _Antiquities_, XII, ii, 5.  Consult        Sammter, _Mischnaioth Ordnung Zeraim_ (Berlin, 1887),        _Introduction_, pp. 10-22; Meilziner, _Introduction to the        Talmud_, pp. 22-39; the _Jewish Encyclopedia_, and Strack,        _Einleitung_, p. 82 _et seq._, for the lives of the        authorities mentioned in _Abot_ and for bibliographies.          (10) Cf. _Nedarim_, 32b, \"Great is the _Torah_, for if it did        not exist, the heaven and the earth would have no permanence.\"         _Abodah_ is the service and sacrifice of the Temple which was        then standing.  After the destruction of the Temple, this word        was used to designate the service of prayer.  It is used in        one of the benedictions after the reading of the _Haftarah_:        _al ha-torah we-al ha-abodah_, \"for the law and for the divine        service,\" see _Prayer-book_, ed. Singer, p. 149.  See        Friedlander, _ibid._, p. 413 _et seq._          (11) [g'milut chasadim] \"benevolence,\" \"the doing of        kindnesses,\" consists of practical deeds of personal service,        as visiting the sick, burying the dead, comforting mourners,        peacemaking, etc.  It is greater than [tzedakah] \"charity\" in        its narrower sense, as benevolence may be shown to the rich as        well as to the poor.  See Friedlander, _ibid._, pp. 301-305.        On this verse, see Herford, _ibid._, p. 22 _et seq._    3. Antigonus of Soko (12) received (the tradition) from Simon, the  Just.  He used to say, \"Be not like hirelings who work for their  master for the sake of receiving recompense; but be like servants who  minister to their master without any thought of receiving a reward;  and let the fear of Heaven (13) be upon you.\"          (12) According to _Abot de-Rabbi Natan_, Chapter V, ed.        Schechter, p. 26, Antigonus had two disciples, Zadok and        Boethos, from whom arose the Sadducees and the heretical sect        of Boethusians, from their misinterpretation of this verse,        both denying the doctrines of immortality of the soul and        resurrection.  Se Kohut, _The Ethics of the Fathers_, p. 43;        Schurer, _History_, II, ii. p. 29 _et seq._; Geiger, _Judaism        and Its History_, p. 99 _et seq._; and _Jewish Encyclopedia_,        arts. _Boethusians_ and _Sadducees_.          (13) \"The fear of Heaven\" does not mean dread of punishment,        but rather awe at the greatness and might of God, and is        identical with love and service (see Deuteronomy, VI, 13 and        X, 12).  It is produced by following out the practices        ordained in the _Torah_ (Maimonides, _Guide for the        Perplexed_, ed. Friedlander, p. 392).  Consult Friedlander,        _Jewish Religion_, pp. 273-274, the _Jewish Encyclopedia_,        art. _Fear of God_, and Schechter, _Aspects_, p. 72.    4. Jose, the son of Joezer, of Zeredah, and Jose, the son of Jochanan  (14), of Jerusalem received (the tradition) from them (15).  Jose, the  son of Joezer, of Zeredah said, \"Let thy house be a meeting-place for  the wise; cover thyself with the dust of their feet (16), and drink in  their words with thirst.\"          (14) In _Chagigah_, II, 2, we are told that when two leading        teachers are named in the _Mishnah_ as having received the        _Torah_, they constitute a \"pair\" ([zug]), the first being the        president([nasi]), and the second the vice-president ([av beit        din]) of the _Sanhedrin_.  There were five pairs of such        teachers, flourishing between 170 and 30 B.C.E., the first        being Jose b. Joezer and Jose b. Jochanan, and the last being        Hillel and Shammai.  See Frankel, _Monatschrift_, 1852, pp.        405-421, Mielziner, _Introduction_, pp. 22-23, and Strack,        _Spruche_, p. 13.          (15) Some texts read \"from him\" ([mimenu]).  \"From them\" must        refer to disciples of Antigonus whose sayings have been lost.          (16) It was the custom of pupils to sit at the feet of their        teachers.    5. Jose, the son of Jochanan, of Jerusalem said, \"Let thy house be  open wide; let the poor be members of thy household, and engage not in  much gossip with woman.\"  This applies to one's own wife; how much  more (17), then, to the wife of one's neighbor?  Hence the sages say,  \"Whoso engages in much gossip with woman brings evil upon himself,  neglects the study of the _Torah_, and will in the end inherit  _gehinnom_\" (18).          (17) On the _kalwa-chomer_, \"a conclusion _a minori ad        majus_,\" see Meilziner, _Introduction to the Talmud_, p. 130        _et seq._, and Strack, _Einleitung in den Talmud_, p. 120.        Cf. Chapter VI, 3.  The equivalent biblical expression is [af        ki].          (18) [gey-hinim (gimil-yud hey-nun-yud-mem(sofit))], [gei        ben-hinim], a glen south of Jerusalem where Moloch was        worshipped, whence a place where the wicked were punished in        the hereafter; \"hell, being the opposite of 'the Garden of        Eden,'\" \"paradise.\"  Cf. chapter V, 22 and 23.  See        Friedlander, _Jewish Religion_, p. 223.    6. Joshua, the son of Perachyah, and Nittai, the Arbelite, received  (the tradition) from them.  Joshua, the son of Perachyah, said,  \"Provide thyself with a teacher, and possess thyself of a companion  (19); and judge every man in the scale of merit.\"          (19) A fellow-student.    7. Nittai, the Arbelite, said, \"Keep aloof from a bad neighbor (20);  associate not with the wicked, and abandon not the belief in  retribution\" (21).          (20) Cf. chapter II, 14.          (21) This may mean either that one must not imagine that        punishment for evil deeds will not befall him, or when        punishment has been meted out, one must not despair of the        good.    8. Judah, the son of Tabbi, and Simeon, the son of Shatach (22),  received (the tradition) from them.  Judah, the son of Tabbi, said,  \"(In the judge's office) act not the counsel's part (23); while the  litigants are standing before thee, let them be regarded by thee as  guilty, but when they are departed from thy presence, regard them as  innocent, the verdict having been acquiesced in by them.\"          (22) Lived about 104-69 B.C.E.  He was a leader of the        Pharisees at the time of Alexander Jannaeus.          (23) A judge should be strictly impartial.    9. Simeon, the son of Shatach, said, \"Be very searching in the  examination of witnesses (24), and be guarded in thy words, lest  through them they learn to lie.\"          (24) It is related that the son of Simeon b. Shatach was        innocently condemned to death, because the witnesses were not        carefully cross-questioned.    10. Shemaiah and Abtalion (25) received (the tradition) from them.  Shemaiah said, \"Love work; hate lordship (26); and seek no intimacy  with the ruling power\" (27).          (25) Lived about the middle of the first century B.C.E.          (26) \"Woe to leadership, for it buries those who possess it.\"        (_Pesachim_, 87b).          (27) That is, Rome.  Avoid office seeking.    11. Abtalion said, \"Ye sages, be heedful of your words, lest ye incur  the penalty of exile and be exiled to a place of evil waters, and the  disciples who come after you drink thereof and die, and the Heavenly  Name be profaned\" (28).          (28) Scholars must be careful in their teachings, lest their        disciples misinterpret their words, and thus adopt false        doctrines, as was the case with the disciples of Antigonus of        Soko (_Supra_, n. 12).  \"Evil waters\" may stand for evil        doctrines or evil people.  When a teacher went into        banishment, he was usually followed by his disciples.        Departure from the law is equivalent to death.    12. Hillel and Shammai (29) received (the tradition) from them.  Hillel said, \"Be of the disciples of Aaron, loving peace and pursuing  peace (30), loving mankind and drawing them night to the _Torah_\"  (31).  13. He used to say, \"A name made great is a name destroyed  (32); he who does not increase (his knowledge) decreases (it); and he  who does not study deserves to die; and he who makes a worldly use of  the crown (of the _Torah_) shall waste away.\"  14. He used to say, \"If  I am not for myself, who will be for me?  But if I care for myself  only, what am I? (33).  And if not now, when?\"          (29) Hillel and Shammai, the most renowned of the \"pairs\"        ([zugot]), lived about 100 years before the destruction of the        Temple.  Each was the founder of a school, _Bet Hillel_ and        _Bet Shammai_, being generally opposed to one another in the        interpretation of the _Torah_.  Hillel was the embodiment of        humility, gentleness, and kindness; Shammai was irritable, and        lacked gentleness and patience.  The former's most celebrated        saying is, \"What is"]]]
