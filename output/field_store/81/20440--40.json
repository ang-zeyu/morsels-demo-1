BIOMETRY      Even new sciences, founded by evolutionists, bear witness against  their theory. Mendel's Inheritance Law is one, as we have seen;  Biometry is another. It was proposed and advocated by Sir Francis  Galton, a cousin of Charles Darwin. He expected it to be a great prop  to evolution; on the other hand, it is another proof of the unity of  our race in Noah's day, and hence fatal to their theory. Biometry is  defined to be the \"statistical study of variation and heredity.\" It  bears heavily against the great age of man.    One of the leading exponents of Biometry, Dr. C.B.  Davenport,  Secretary of the Eugenics section of the American Breeders'  Association concludes that \"No people of English descent are more  distantly related than thirtieth cousin, while most people are more  nearly related than that.\" Professor Conklin, of Princeton University,  approves this conclusion, and adds, \"As a matter of fact most persons  of the same race are much more closely related than this, and  certainly _we need not go back to Adam nor even to Shem, Ham or  Japheth to find our common ancestor_.\" Dr. Davenport, therefore,  says that the English may find a common ancestor thirty-two  generations ago; Professor Conklin admits that we need not go further  back than Noah to find a common ancestor of all mankind.  Noah,  therefore, must have been the head of the race. Evolutionists admit we  need go no farther back than Noah to find the head of the race, and  the population, as we have seen, proves the same thing, and disproves  every guess they have made of the great age of man. We have descended  from Noah and not from the brute.    This same Professor Conklin says that our race began 2,000,000 years  ago (60,000 generations). How is it possible that we must go back  sixty thousand generations for a common ancestor, when thirty-two  generations will suffice for the English, and about 200 generations  since Noah, for the whole race? If we, by the laws of biometry, can  find a common ancestor in Noah, we can not possibly go back 2,000,000  years to find one. Professor Conklin's admission refutes his claim of  2,000,000 years for man.  Biometry proves that age absolutely  impossible.    If the progeny of this ape-like ancestor inter-bred for many  generations,--as certainly would have been the case--then we are not  only descended from all the monkey family, the baboon, gorilla, ape,  chimpanzee, orang-utang lemur (H. G. Wells' ancestor), mongoose, etc.,  but are also related to all their progeny. Glorious ancestors! In our  veins runs the blood of them all, as well as the blood of the most  disgusting reptiles. And yet Professor H. H.  Newman, an eminent  evolutionist, in a letter to the writer, says, \"The evolution idea is  an ennobling one.\"! But biometry saves us from such repulsive  forbears, by proving it could not be so.    Biometrists find that there is a Law of Filial Regression, or a  tendency to the normal in every species, checking the accumulation of  departures from the average, and forbidding the formation of new  species by inheritance of peculiarities. The whole tendency of the  laws of nature is against the formation of new species, so essential  to evolution. The species brings forth still \"after its kind.\"  \"On  the average, extreme peculiarities of parents are less extreme in  children.\" \"The stature of adult offspring must, on the whole, be more  mediocre than the stature of the parents.\" Gifted parents rarely have  children as highly gifted as themselves.    The tendency is to revert to the normal in body and mind. Nature  discourages the formation of new species, evolutionists to the  contrary notwithstanding. \"Like produces like\" is a universal and  unchangeable law. God has forbidden species to pass their boundaries;  and, if any individual seems to threaten to do so, by possessing  abnormal peculiarities, these are soon corrected, often in the next  generation. Even Professor H. H. Newman says, \"On the whole, the  contributions of biometry to our understanding of the causes of  evolution are rather disappointing.\"  A science that upsets evolution  is certainly disappointing to evolutionists.        8. NO NEW SPECIES NOW      They tell us that 3,000,000 species of plants and animals developed  from one primordial germ, in 60,000,000 years. How many new species  should have arisen in the last 6,000 years? Now 20 doublings of the  first species of animals would make 1,048,576 species, since 2 raised  to the 20th power becomes 1,048,576. Again we will favor the  evolutionists, by omitting from the calculation all species of animals  in excess of 1,048,576. Therefore, on an average, each of the 20  doublings would take 1/20 of 60,000,000 years, or 3,000,000 years;  and, therefore, 1/2 of the entire 1,048,576 species, or 524,288  species, must have originated within the last 3,000,000 years. Can  that be the case? Certainly not.    And since the number of species must have increased in a geometrical  ratio, 2097 species must have arisen or matured within the last 6000  years--an average of one new species of animals every 3 years. How  many species actually have arisen within the last 6000 years? 2000?  200? or 2? It is not proven that _a single new species has arisen in  that time_. Not one can be named. If approximately 2000 new species  have not arisen in the last 6000 years, the evolution of species can  not possibly be true.  Even Darwin says: \"In spite of all the efforts  of trained observers, not one change of species into another is on  record.\" Sir William Dawson, the great Canadian geologist, says:  \"_No case is certainly known in human experience_ where any  species of animal or plant has been so changed as to assume all the  characteristics of a new species.\"    Indeed, a high authority says: \"Though, since the human race began,  all sorts of artificial agencies have been employed, and though there  has been the closest scrutiny, yet _not a distinctively new type of  plant or animal_, on what is called broad lines, has come into  existence.\"    Not a single new species has arisen in the last 6000 years when the  theory requires over 2000. Evolutionists admit this. Prof. Vernon  Kellogg, of Leland Stanford University, in his \"Darwinism of Today,\"  p. 18, says:--\"Speaking by and large, we only tell the general truth  when we declare that no indubitable cases of species forming, or  transforming, that is, of descent, have been observed....  For my  part, it seems better to go back to the old and safe _ignoramus  standpoint_.\"    Prof. H. H. Newman, of Chicago University, in answer to the writer's  question, \"How many new species have arisen in the last 6000 years?\"  wrote this evasive reply: \"I do not know how to answer your  questions....  None of us know just what a species is. [If so, how  could 3,000,000 species be counted, the number, he says,  exists?].... It is difficult to say just when a new species has arisen  from an old.\" He does not seem to know of a single new species within  the last 6,000 years.    The same question was asked of Dr. Osborn, of Columbia University,  N. Y. The answer by R. C. Murphy, assistant, was equally  indefinite. He wrote: \"From every point of view, your short note of  Aug. 22nd raises questions, which no scientific man can possibly  answer. We have very little knowledge as to just when any particular  species of animal arose.\" In a later letter, he says: \"I have no idea  whether the number of species which have arisen during the last 6000  years is 1 or 100,000.\"    Should those who \"do not know\" speak so confidently in favor of  evolution, or take the \"old and safe _ignoramus_\" standpoint, as  Prof. Kellogg suggests?    The number of existing species can not be explained upon the ground of  evolution, but only upon the ground of the creation of numerous heads  of animal and plant life, as the Scriptures declare.    We have a right to increase the pressure of the argument, by  introducing into the calculation, the total of 3,000,000 species of  plants and animals which would require 6355 new species within the  last 6000 years, or an average of more than one new species a year!  And they can not point to one new species in 6000 years, as they  confess. Dr. J. B. Warren, of the University of California, said  recently: \"If the theory of evolution be true, then, during many  thousands of years, covered in whole or in part by present human  knowledge, there would certainly be known at least a few instances of  the evolution of one species from another. _No such instance is  known._\"    Prof. Owen declares, \"No instance of change of one species into  another has ever been recorded by man.\"    Prof. William Bateson, the distinguished English biologist, said, \"It  is impossible for scientists longer to agree with Darwin's theory of  the origin of species. No explanation whatever has been offered to  account for the fact that, after forty years, no evidence has been  discovered to verify his genesis of species.\"    Although scientists have so largely discarded Darwin's theory, the  utter lack of new species in historic time, when so many are required  by _every_ theory of evolution, is a mathematical demonstration  that the whole theory of evolution must be abandoned. Q. E. D. Why do  they still insist it _may be true_?        9. MATHEMATICAL PROBABILITY      Mathematical Probability is a branch or division of mathematics by  means of which the odds in favor or against the occurrence of any  event may be definitely computed, and the measure of the probability  or improbability exactly determined. Its conclusions approximate  certainty and reveal how wild the guesses of evolutionists are.    The evolution of species violates the rule of mathematical  probability. It is so improbable that one and only one species out of  3,000,000 should develop into man, that it certainly was not the  case.

In accord with the interests and occupations of the group,  certain things become objects of high esteem; others of aversion.  Association does not create impulses or affection and dislike, but it  furnishes the objects to which they attach themselves. The way our group  or class does things tends to determine the proper objects of attention,  and thus to prescribe the directions and limits of observation  and memory. What is strange or foreign (that is to say outside  the activities of the groups) tends to be morally forbidden and  intellectually suspect. It seems almost incredible to us, for example,  that things which we know very well could have escaped recognition  in past ages. We incline to account for it by attributing congenital  stupidity to our forerunners and by assuming superior native  intelligence on our own part. But the explanation is that their modes  of life did not call for attention to such facts, but held their minds  riveted to other things. Just as the senses require sensible objects  to stimulate them, so our powers of observation, recollection, and  imagination do not work spontaneously, but are set in motion by the  demands set up by current social occupations. The main texture of  disposition is formed, independently of schooling, by such influences.  What conscious, deliberate teaching can do is at most to free the  capacities thus formed for fuller exercise, to purge them of some of  their grossness, and to furnish objects which make their activity more  productive of meaning.    While this \"unconscious influence of the environment\" is so subtle and  pervasive that it affects every fiber of character and mind, it may  be worth while to specify a few directions in which its effect is most  marked. First, the habits of language. Fundamental modes of speech, the  bulk of the vocabulary, are formed in the ordinary intercourse of life,  carried on not as a set means of instruction but as a social necessity.  The babe acquires, as we well say, the mother tongue. While speech  habits thus contracted may be corrected or even displaced by conscious  teaching, yet, in times of excitement, intentionally acquired modes of  speech often fall away, and individuals relapse into their really native  tongue. Secondly, manners. Example is notoriously more potent than  precept. Good manners come, as we say, from good breeding or rather are  good breeding; and breeding is acquired by habitual action, in response  to habitual stimuli, not by conveying information. Despite the never  ending play of conscious correction and instruction, the surrounding  atmosphere and spirit is in the end the chief agent in forming manners.  And manners are but minor morals. Moreover, in major morals, conscious  instruction is likely to be efficacious only in the degree in which  it falls in with the general \"walk and conversation\" of those who  constitute the child's social environment. Thirdly, good taste and  esthetic appreciation. If the eye is constantly greeted by harmonious  objects, having elegance of form and color, a standard of taste  naturally grows up. The effect of a tawdry, unarranged, and  over-decorated environment works for the deterioration of taste, just as  meager and barren surroundings starve out the desire for beauty. Against  such odds, conscious teaching can hardly do more than convey second-hand  information as to what others think. Such taste never becomes  spontaneous and personally engrained, but remains a labored reminder of  what those think to whom one has been taught to look up. To say that the  deeper standards of judgments of value are framed by the situations  into which a person habitually enters is not so much to mention a fourth  point, as it is to point out a fusion of those already mentioned. We  rarely recognize the extent in which our conscious estimates of what is  worth while and what is not, are due to standards of which we are not  conscious at all. But in general it may be said that the things which we  take for granted without inquiry or reflection are just the things which  determine our conscious thinking and decide our conclusions. And these  habitudes which lie below the level of reflection are just those which  have been formed in the constant give and take of relationship with  others.    4. The School as a Special Environment. The chief importance of this  foregoing statement of the educative process which goes on willy-nilly  is to lead us to note that the only way in which adults consciously  control the kind of education which the immature get is by controlling  the environment in which they act, and hence think and feel. We never  educate directly, but indirectly by means of the environment. Whether  we permit chance environments to do the work, or whether we design  environments for the purpose makes a great difference. And any  environment is a chance environment so far as its educative influence  is concerned unless it has been deliberately regulated with reference to  its educative effect. An intelligent home differs from an unintelligent  one chiefly in that the habits of life and intercourse which prevail are  chosen, or at least colored, by the thought of their bearing upon the  development of children. But schools remain, of course, the typical  instance of environments framed with express reference to influencing  the mental and moral disposition of their members.    Roughly speaking, they come into existence when social traditions are  so complex that a considerable part of the social store is committed  to writing and transmitted through written symbols. Written symbols are  even more artificial or conventional than spoken; they cannot be picked  up in accidental intercourse with others. In addition, the written form  tends to select and record matters which are comparatively foreign  to everyday life. The achievements accumulated from generation to  generation are deposited in it even though some of them have fallen  temporarily out of use. Consequently as soon as a community depends to  any considerable extent upon what lies beyond its own territory and its  own immediate generation, it must rely upon the set agency of schools  to insure adequate transmission of all its resources. To take an obvious  illustration: The life of the ancient Greeks and Romans has profoundly  influenced our own, and yet the ways in which they affect us do not  present themselves on the surface of our ordinary experiences. In  similar fashion, peoples still existing, but remote in space, British,  Germans, Italians, directly concern our own social affairs, but  the nature of the interaction cannot be understood without explicit  statement and attention. In precisely similar fashion, our daily  associations cannot be trusted to make clear to the young the part  played in our activities by remote physical energies, and by invisible  structures. Hence a special mode of social intercourse is instituted,  the school, to care for such matters.    This mode of association has three functions sufficiently specific,  as compared with ordinary associations of life, to be noted. First, a  complex civilization is too complex to be assimilated in toto. It has to  be broken up into portions, as it were, and assimilated piecemeal, in a  gradual and graded way. The relationships of our present social life are  so numerous and so interwoven that a child placed in the most favorable  position could not readily share in many of the most important of them.  Not sharing in them, their meaning would not be communicated to him,  would not become a part of his own mental disposition. There would be  no seeing the trees because of the forest. Business, politics, art,  science, religion, would make all at once a clamor for attention;  confusion would be the outcome. The first office of the social organ we  call the school is to provide a simplified environment. It selects the  features which are fairly fundamental and capable of being responded to  by the young. Then it establishes a progressive order, using the  factors first acquired as means of gaining insight into what is more  complicated.    In the second place, it is the business of the school environment to  eliminate, so far as possible, the unworthy features of the existing  environment from influence upon mental habitudes. It establishes a  purified medium of action. Selection aims not only at simplifying but at  weeding out what is undesirable. Every society gets encumbered with what  is trivial, with dead wood from the past, and with what is positively  perverse. The school has the duty of omitting such things from the  environment which it supplies, and thereby doing what it can to  counteract their influence in the ordinary social environment. By  selecting the best for its exclusive use, it strives to reinforce the  power of this best. As a society becomes more enlightened, it realizes  that it is responsible not to transmit and conserve the whole of  its existing achievements, but only such as make for a better future  society. The school is its chief agency for the accomplishment of this  end.    In the third place, it is the office of the school environment to  balance the various elements in the social environment, and to see to it  that each individual gets an opportunity to escape from the limitations  of the social group in which he was born, and to come into living  contact with a broader environment. Such words as \"society\" and  \"community\" are likely to be misleading, for they have a tendency to  make us think there is a single thing corresponding to the single word.  As a matter of fact, a modern society is many societies more or less  loosely connected. Each household with its immediate extension of  friends makes a society; the village or street group of playmates is a  community; each business group, each club, is another. Passing beyond  these more intimate groups,"]]]
