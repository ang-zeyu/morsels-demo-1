No Jew was  ever excommunicated for declaring his dissent from these articles. No  Jew was ever called upon formally to express his assent to them. But, as  Professor Schechter justly writes: 'Among the Maimonists we may probably  include the great majority of Jews, who accepted the Thirteen Articles  without further question. Maimonides must have filled up a great gap  in Jewish theology, a gap, moreover, the existence of which was very  generally perceived. A century had hardly lapsed before the Thirteen  Articles had become a theme for the poets of the Synagogue. And almost  every country can show a poem or a prayer founded on these Articles'  (_Studies in Judaism_, p. 301).    Yet the opposition to the Articles was both impressive and  persistent. Some denied altogether the admissibility of Articles,  claiming that the whole Law and nothing but the Law was the Charter of  Judaism. Others criticised the Maimonist Articles in detail. Certainly  they are far from logically drawn up, some paragraphs being dictated  by opposition to Islam rather than by positive needs of the Jewish  position. A favourite condensation was a smaller list of three Articles:  (i) Existence of God; (ii) Revelation; and (iii) Retribution. These three  Articles are usually associated with the name of Joseph Albo (1380-1444),  though they are somewhat older. There is no doubt but that these Articles  found, in recent centuries, more acceptance than the Maimonist Thirteen,  though the latter still hold their place in the orthodox Jewish Prayer  Books. They may be found in the _Authorised Daily Prayer Book_,  ed. Singer, p. 89.    Moses Mendelssohn (1728-1786), who strongly maintained that Judaism  is a life, not a creed, made the practice of formulating Articles of  Judaism unfashionable. But not for long. More and more, Judaic ritual has  fallen into disregard since the French Revolution. Judaism has therefore  tended to express itself as a system of doctrines rather than as a body  of practices. And there was a special reason why the Maimonist Articles  could not remain. Reference is not meant to the fact that many Jews came  to doubt the Mosaic origin of the Pentateuch. But there were lacking in  the Maimonist Creed all emotional elements. On the one hand, Maimonides,  rationalist and anti-Mystic as he was, makes no allowance for the doctrine  of the Immanence of God. Then, owing to his unemotional nature, he laid  no stress on all the affecting and moving associations of the belief in  the Mission of Israel as the Chosen People. Before Maimonides, if there  had been one dogma of Judaism at all, it was the Election of Israel.  Jehuda Halevi, the greatest of the Hebrew poets of the Middle Ages,  had at the beginning of the twelfth century, some half century before  Maimonides, given expression to this in the famous epigram: 'Israel is  to the nations like the heart to the limbs.'    Though, however, the Creed of Maimonides has no position of authority  in the Synagogue, modern times have witnessed no successful intrusion of  a rival. Most writers of treatises on Judaism prefer to describe rather  than to define the religious tenets of the faith. In America there have  been several suggestions of a Creed. Articles of faith have been there  chiefly formulated for the reception of proselytes. This purpose is a  natural cause of precision in belief; for while one who already stands  within by birth or race is rarely called upon to justify his faith,  the newcomer is under the necessity to do so. In the pre-Christian  Judaism it is probable that there was a Catechism or short manual of  instruction called in Greek the _Didache_, in which the Golden Rule  in Hillel's negative form and the Decalogue occupied a front place. Thus  we find, too, modern American Jews formulating Articles of Faith as a  Proselyte Confession. In 1896 the Central Conference of American Rabbis  adopted the following five principles for such a Confession: (i) God  the Only One; (ii) Man His Image; (iii) Immortality of the Soul; (iv)  Retribution; (v) Israel's Mission. During the past few months a tract,  entitled 'Essentials of Judaism,' has been issued in London by the Jewish  Religious Union. The author, N. S. Joseph, is careful to explain that he  is not putting forth these principles as 'dogmatic Articles of Faith,'  and that they are solely 'suggestive outlines of belief which may be  gradually imparted to children, the outlines being afterwards filled  up by the teacher. But the eight paragraphs of these Essentials are at  once so ably compiled and so informing as to the modern trend of Jewish  belief that they will be here cited without comment.    According then to this presentation, the Essentials of Judaism are: '(i)  There is One Eternal God, who is the sole Origin of all things and forces,  and the Source of all living souls. He rules the universe with justice,  righteousness, mercy, and love. (ii) Our souls, emanating from God, are  immortal, and will return to Him when our life on earth ceases. While  we are here, our souls can hold direct communion with God in prayer and  praise, and in silent contemplation and admiration of His works. (iii)  Our souls are directly responsible to God for the work of our life on  earth. God, being All-merciful, will judge us with loving-kindness, and  being All-just, will allow for our imperfections; and we, therefore,  need no mediator and no vicarious atonement to ensure the future  welfare of our souls. (iv) God is the One and only God. He is Eternal  and Omnipresent. He not only pervades the entire world, but is also  within us; and His Spirit helps and leads us towards goodness and truth.  (v) Duty should be the moving force of our life; and the thought that God  is always in us and about us should incite us to lead good and beneficent  lives, showing our love of God by loving our fellow-creatures, and working  for their happiness and betterment with all our might. (vi) In various  bygone times God has revealed, and even in our own days continues to  reveal to us, something of His nature and will, by inspiring the best  and wisest minds with noble thoughts and new ideas, to be conveyed to  us in words, so that this world may constantly improve and grow happier  and better. (vii) Long ago some of our forefathers were thus inspired,  and they handed down to us--and through us to the world at large--some  of God's choicest gifts, the principles of Religion and Morality, now  recorded in our Bible; and these spiritual gifts of God have gradually  spread among our fellow-men, so that much of our religion and of its  morality has been adopted by them. (viii) Till the main religious and  moral principles of Judaism have been accepted by the world at large,  the maintenance by the Jews of a separate corporate existence is a  religious duty incumbent upon them. They are the \"witnesses\" of God,  and they must adhere to their religion, showing forth its truth and  excellence to all mankind. This has been and is and will continue to  be their mission. Their public worship and private virtues must be the  outward manifestation of the fulfilment of that mission.'        CHAPTER IV    SOME CONCEPTS OF JUDAISM      Though there are no accepted Articles of Faith in Judaism, there is  a complete consensus of opinion that Monotheism is the basis of the  religion. The Unity of God was more than a doctrine. It was associated  with the noblest hope of Israel, with Israel's Mission to the world.    The Unity of God was even more than a hope. It was an inspiration,  a passion. For it the Jews 'passed through fire and water,' enduring  tribulation and death for the sake of the Unity. All the Jewish  martyrologies are written round this text.    In one passage the Talmud actually defines the Jew as the  Monotheist. 'Whoever repudiates the service of other gods is called a Jew'  (Megillah, 13 a).    But this all-pervading doctrine of the Unity did not reach Judaism as an  abstract philosophical truth. Hence, though the belief in the Unity of  God, associated as it was with the belief in the Spirituality of God,  might have been expected to lead to the conception of an Absolute,  Transcendent Being such as we meet in Islam, it did not so lead in  Judaism. Judaism never attempted to define God at all. Maimonides  put the seal on the reluctance of Jewish theology to go beyond, or  to fall short of, what historic Judaism delivered. Judaism wavers  between the two opposite conceptions: absolute transcendentalism and  absolute pantheism. Sometimes Judaism speaks with the voice of Isaiah;  sometimes with the voice of Spinoza. It found the bridge in the Psalter.  'The Lord is nigh unto all that call upon Him.' The Law brought heaven  to earth; Prayer raised earth to heaven.    As was remarked above, Jewish theology never shrank from inconsistency. It  accepted at once God's foreknowledge and man's free-will. So it described  the knowledge of God as far above man's reach; yet it felt God near,  sympathetic, a Father and Friend. The liturgy of the Synagogue has been  well termed a 'precipitate' of all the Jewish teaching as to God. He is  the Great, the Mighty, the Awful, the Most High, the King. But He is also  the Father, Helper, Deliverer, the Peace-Maker, Supporter of the weak,  Healer of the sick. All human knowledge is a direct manifestation of  His grace. Man's body, with all its animal functions, is His handiwork.  He created joy, and made the Bridegroom and the Bride. He formed the fruit  of the Vine, and is the Source of all the lawful pleasures of men. He is  the Righteous Judge; but He remembers that man is dust, He pardons sins,  and His loving-kindness is over all. He is unchangeable, yet repentance  can avert the evil decree. He is in heaven, yet he puts the love and  fear of Him into man's very heart. He breathed the Soul into man, and  is faithful "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6980"],[0,"Tales of St. Austin's (#5)"],[1,"is just what I've always wanted. So, can I?

The St Austin's freshman, Venables, fully justified his inclusion by  scoring a stylish fifty-seven. He hit eight fours, and except for a  miss-hit in the slips, at 51, which Smith might possibly have secured  had he started sooner, gave nothing like a chance. Venables, it will be  remembered, played several good innings for Oxford in the earlier  matches, notably, his not out contribution of 103 against Sussex--          [4]    HARRISON'S SLIGHT ERROR      The one o'clock down express was just on the point of starting. The  engine-driver, with his hand on the lever, whiled away the moments,  like the watchman in _The Agamemnon_, by whistling. The guard  endeavoured to talk to three people at once. Porters flitted to and  fro, cleaving a path for themselves with trucks of luggage. The Usual  Old Lady was asking if she was right for some place nobody had ever  heard of. Everybody was saying good-bye to everybody else, and last,  but not least, P. St H. Harrison, of St Austin's, was strolling at a  leisurely pace towards the rear of the train. There was no need for him  to hurry. For had not his friend, Mace, promised to keep a corner-seat  for him while he went to the refreshment-room to lay in supplies?  Undoubtedly he had, and Harrison, as he watched the struggling crowd,  congratulated himself that he was not as other men. A corner seat in a  carriage full of his own particular friends, with plenty of provisions,  and something to read in case he got tired of talking--it would be  perfect.    So engrossed was he in these reflections, that he did not notice that  from the opposite end of the platform a youth of about his own age was  also making for the compartment in question. The first intimation he  had of his presence was when the latter, arriving first at the door by  a short head, hurled a bag on to the rack, and sank gracefully into the  identical corner seat which Harrison had long regarded as his own  personal property. And to make matters worse, there was no other vacant  seat in the compartment. Harrison was about to protest, when the guard  blew his whistle. There was nothing for it but to jump in and argue the  matter out _en route_. Harrison jumped in, to be greeted instantly  by a chorus of nine male voices. 'Outside there! No room! Turn him  out!' said the chorus. Then the chorus broke up into its component  parts, and began to address him one by one.    'You rotter, Harrison,' said Babington, of Dacre's, 'what do you come  barging in here for? Can't you see we're five aside already?'    'Hope you've brought a sardine-opener with you, old chap,' said  Barrett, the peerless pride of Philpott's, ''cos we shall jolly well  need one when we get to the good old Junct-i-on. Get up into the rack,  Harrison, you're stopping the ventilation.'    The youth who had commandeered Harrison's seat so neatly took another  unpardonable liberty at this point. He grinned. Not the timid,  deprecating smile of one who wishes to ingratiate himself with  strangers, but a good, six-inch grin right across his face. Harrison  turned on him savagely.    'Look here,' he said, 'just you get out of that. What do you mean by  bagging my seat?'    'Are you a director of this line?' enquired the youth politely. Roars  of applause from the interested audience. Harrison began to feel hot  and uncomfortable.    'Or only the Emperor of Germany?' pursued his antagonist.    More applause, during which Harrison dropped his bag of provisions,  which were instantly seized and divided on the share and share alike  system, among the gratified Austinians.    'Look here, none of your cheek,' was the shockingly feeble retort which  alone occurred to him. The other said nothing. Harrison returned to the  attack.    'Look here,' he said, 'are you going to get out, or have I got to make  you?'    Not a word did his opponent utter. To quote the bard: 'The stripling  smiled.' To tell the truth, the stripling smiled inanely.    The other occupants of the carriage were far from imitating his  reserve. These treacherous friends, realizing that, for those who were  themselves comfortably seated, the spectacle of Harrison standing up  with aching limbs for a journey of some thirty miles would be both  grateful and comforting, espoused the cause of the unknown with all the  vigour of which they were capable.    'Beastly bully, Harrison,' said Barrett. 'Trying to turn the kid out of  his seat! Why can't you leave the chap alone? Don't you move, kid.'    'Thanks,' said the unknown, 'I wasn't going to.'    'Now you see what comes of slacking,' said Grey. 'If you'd bucked up  and got here in time you might have bagged this seat I've got. By Jove,  Harrison, you've no idea how comfortable it is in this corner.'    'Punctuality,' said Babington, 'is the politeness of princes.'    And again the unknown maddened Harrison with a 'best-on-record' grin.    'But, I say, you chaps,' said he, determined as a last resource to  appeal to their better feelings (if any), 'Mace was keeping this seat  for me, while I went to get some grub. Weren't you, Mace?' He turned to  Mace for corroboration. To his surprise, Mace was nowhere to be seen.    His sympathetic school-fellows grasped the full humour of the situation  as one man, and gave tongue once more in chorus.    'You weed,' they yelled joyfully, 'you've got into the wrong carriage.  Mace is next door.'    And then, with the sound of unquenchable laughter ringing in his ears,  Harrison gave the thing up, and relapsed into a disgusted silence. No  single word did he speak until the journey was done, and the carriage  emptied itself of its occupants at the Junction. The local train was in  readiness to take them on to St Austin's, and this time Harrison  managed to find a seat without much difficulty. But it was a bitter  moment when Mace, meeting him on the platform, addressed him as a  rotter, for that he had not come to claim the corner seat which he had  been reserving for him. They had had, said Mace, a rattling good time  coming down. What sort of a time had Harrison had in _his_  carriage? Harrison's reply was not remarkable for its clearness.    The unknown had also entered the local train. It was plain, therefore,  that he was coming to the School as a new boy. Harrison began to wonder  if, under these circumstances, something might not be done in the  matter by way of levelling up things. He pondered. When St Austin's  station was reached, and the travellers began to stream up the road  towards the College, he discovered that the newcomer was a member of  his own House. He was standing close beside him, and heard Babington  explaining to him the way to Merevale's. Merevale was Harrison's  House-master.    It was two minutes after he had found out this fact that the Grand Idea  came to Harrison. He saw his way now to a revenge so artistic, so  beautifully simple, that it was with some difficulty that he restrained  himself from bursting into song. For two pins, he felt, he could have  done a cake-walk.    He checked his emotion. He beat it steadily back, and quenched it. When  he arrived at Merevale's, he went first to the matron's room. 'Has  Venables come back yet?' he asked.    Venables was the head of Merevale's House, captain of the School  cricket, wing three-quarter of the School Fifteen, and a great man  altogether.    'Yes,' said the matron, 'he came back early this afternoon.'    Harrison knew it. Venables always came back early on the last day of  the holidays.    'He was upstairs a short while ago,' continued the matron. 'He was  putting his study tidy.'    Harrison knew it. Venables always put his study tidy on the last day of  the holidays. He took a keen and perfectly justifiable pride in his  study, which was the most luxurious in the House.    'Is he there now?' asked Harrison.    'No. He has gone over to see the Headmaster.'    'Thanks,' said Harrison, 'it doesn't matter. It wasn't anything  important.'    He retired triumphant. Things were going excellently well for his  scheme.    His next act was to go to the fags' room, where, as he had expected, he  found his friend of the train. Luck continued to be with him. The  unknown was alone.    'Hullo!' said Harrison.    'Hullo!' said the fellow-traveller. He had resolved to follow  Harrison's lead. If Harrison was bringing war, then war let it be. If,  however, his intentions were friendly, he would be friendly too.    'I didn't know you were coming to Merevale's. It's the best House in  the School.'    'Oh!'    'Yes, for one thing, everybody except the kids has a study.'    'What? Not really? Why, I thought we had to keep to this room. One of  the chaps "]]]
