GREEN PEAS SOUP.    Take four pounds of knuckle of veal, and a pound of bacon. Cut  them to pieces, and put them into a soup kettle with a sprig of  mint and four quarts of water. Boil it moderately fast, and skim  it well. When the meat is boiled to rags, strain it out, and put  to the liquor a quart of young green peas. Boil them till they are  entirely dissolved, and till they have thickened the soup, and  given it a green colour. [Footnote: You may greatly improve the  colour by pounding a handful of spinach in a mortar, straining the  juice, and adding it to the soup about a quarter of an hour before  it has done boiling.]    Have ready two quarts of green peas that have been boiled in  another pot with a sprig of mint, and two or three lumps of loaf  sugar, (which will greatly improve the taste.) After they have  boiled in this pot twenty minutes, take out the mint, put the  whole peas into the pot of soup, and boil all together about ten  minutes. Then put it into a tureen, and send it to table.    Never use hard old green peas for this soup, or for any other  purpose. When they begin to turn yellow, it is time to leave them  off for the season.    Lima bean soup may be made in the same manner.      ASPARAGUS SOUP.    Asparagus soup may be made in a similar manner to that of green  peas. You must have four or five bunches of asparagus. Cut off the  green tops, and put half of them into the soup, after the meat has  been boiled to pieces and strained out. The asparagus must be  boiled till quite dissolved, and till it has given a green colour  to the soup. Then take the remainder of the asparagus tops (which  must all this time have been lying in cold water) and put them  into the soup, and let them boil about twenty minutes. Serve it up  with small squares of toast in the tureen.    You may heighten the green of this soup by adding the juice of a  handful of spinach, pounded in a mortar and strained. Or you may  colour it with the juice of boiled spinach squeezed through a  cloth. The spinach juice should be put in fifteen or ten minutes  before you take up the soup, as a short boiling in it will take  off the peculiar taste.      FRIAR'S CHICKEN,    Cut up four pounds of knuckle of veal; season it with white pepper  and salt: put it into a soup-pan and let it boil slowly till the  meat drops from the bone. Then strain it off. Have ready a pair of  young fowls skinned, and cut up as you carve them at table. Season  them with white pepper, salt, and mace. Put them into the soup,  add a handful of chopped parsley, and let them boil. When the  pieces of chicken are all quite tender, have ready four or five  eggs well beaten. Stir the egg into the soup, and take it  immediately off the fire lest it curdle. Serve up the chicken in  the soup.    Rabbits may be substituted for fowls.      CATFISH SOUP.    Catfish that have been caught near the middle of the river are  much nicer than those that are taken near the shore where they  have access to impure food. The small white ones are the best.  Having cut off their heads, skin the fish, and clean them, and cut  them in three. To twelve small catfish allow a pound and a half of  ham. Cut the ham into small pieces, or slice it very thin, and  scald it two or three times in boiling water, lest it be too salt.  Chop together a bunch of parsley and some sweet marjoram stripped  from the stalks. Put these ingredients into a soup kettle and  season them with pepper: the ham will make it salt enough. Add a  head of celery cut small, or a large table-spoonful of celery seed  tied up in a bit of clear muslin to prevent its dispersing. Pat in  two quarts of water, cover the kettle, and let it boil slowly till  every thing is sufficiently done, and the fish and ham quite  tender. Skim it frequently. Boil in another vessel a quart of rich  milk, in which you have melted a quarter of a pound of butter  divided into small bits and rolled in flour. Pour it hot to the  soup, and stir in at the last the beaten yolks of four eggs. Give  it another boil, just to take off the rawness of the eggs, and  then put it into a tureen, taking out the bag of celery seed  before you send the soup to table, and adding some toasted bread  cut into small squares. In making toast for soap, cut the bread  thick, and pare off all the crust.    This soup will be found very fine.    Eel soup may be made in the same manner: chicken soup also.      LOBSTER SOUP.    Have ready a good broth made of a knuckle of veal boiled slowly in  as much water as will cover it, till the meat is reduced to rags.  It must then be well strained.    Having boiled three fine middle-sized lobsters, extract all the  meat from the body and claws. Bruise part of the coral in a  mortar, and also an equal quantity of the meat. Mix them well  together. Add mace, nutmeg, cayenne, and a little grated lemon-peel;  and make them up into force-meat balls, binding the mixture  with the yolk of an egg slightly beaten.    Take three quarts of the veal broth, and put into it the meat of  the lobsters cut into mouthfuls. Boil it together about twenty  minutes. Then thicken it with the remaining coral, (which you must  first rub through a sieve,) and add the force-meat balls, and a  little butter rolled in flour. Simmer it gently for ten minutes,  but do not let it come to a boil, as that will injure the colour.  Pour it into a tureen, and send it to table immediately.      OYSTER SOUP.    To two quarts of oysters add a pint of water, and let them set an  hour. Then take them out of the liquor. Grate and roll fine a  dozen crackers. Put them into the liquor with a large lump of  fresh butter. When the grated biscuit has quite dissolved, add a  quart of milk with a grated nutmeg, and a dozen blades of mace;  and, if in season, a head of celery split fine and cut into small  pieces. Season it to your taste with pepper.    Mix the whole together, and set it in a closely covered vessel  over a slow fire. When it comes to a boil, put in the oysters; and  when it comes to a boil again, they will be sufficiently done.    Before you send it to table put into the tureen some toasted bread  cut into small squares, omitting the crust.      PLAIN OYSTER SOUP.    Take two quarts of large oysters. Strain their liquor into a soup  pan; season it with a tea-spoonful of whole pepper, a tea-spoonful  of whole allspice, the same quantity of whole cloves, and seven or  eight blades of mace. If the oysters are fresh, add a large tea-spoonful  of salt; if they are salt oysters, none is requisite. Set  the pan on hot coals, and boil it slowly (skimming it when  necessary) till you find that it is sufficiently flavoured with  the taste of the spice. In the mean time (having cut out the hard  part) chop the oysters fine, and season them with a powdered  nutmeg. Take the liquor from the fire, and strain out the spice  from it. Then return it to the soup pan, and put the chopped  oysters into it, with whatever liquid may have continued about  them. Add a quarter of a pound of butter, divided into little bits  and rolled in flour. Cover the pan, and let it boil hard about  five minutes. If oysters are cooked too much they become tough and  tasteless.      CLAM SOUP.    Having put your clams into a pot of boiling water to make them  open easily, take them from the shells, carefully saving the  liquor. To the liquor of a quart of opened clams, allow three  quarts of water. Mix the water with the liquor of the clams and  put it into a large pot with a knuckle of veal, the bone of which  should be chopped in four places. When it has simmered slowly for  four hours, put in a large bunch of sweet herbs, a beaten nutmeg,  a tea-spoonful of mace, and a table-spoonful of whole pepper, but  no salt, as the salt of the clam liquor will be sufficient. Stew  it slowly an hour longer, and then strain it. When you have  returned the liquor to the pot, add a quarter of a pound of butter  divided into four and each bit rolled in flour. Then put in the  clams, (having cut them, in pieces,) and let it boil fifteen  minutes. Send it to table with toasted bread in it cut into dice.    This soup will be greatly improved by the addition of small force-meat  balls. Make them of cold minced veal or chicken, mixed with  equal quantities of chopped suet and sweet marjoram, and a smaller  proportion of hard-boiled egg, grated lemon-peel, and powdered  nutmeg. Pound all the ingredients together in a mortar, adding a  little pepper and salt. Break in a raw egg or two (in proportion  to the quantity) to bind the whole together and prevent it from  crumbling to pieces. When thoroughly mixed, make the force-meat  into small balls, and let them boil ten minutes in the soup,  shortly before you send it to table. If you are obliged to make  them of raw veal or raw chicken they must boil longer.    It will be a great improvement to cut up a yam and boil it in the  soup.    Oyster soup may be made in this manner.      PLAIN CLAM SOUP.    Take a hundred clams, well washed, and put them into a large pot  of boiling water. This will cause the shells to open. As they open  take them out, and extract the clams, taking care to save the  liquor. Mix with the liquor a quart of water, (or what will be  much better, a quart of milk,) and thicken it with butter rolled  in flour. Add a large bunch of parsley tied up, and a large table-spoonful  of whole pepper. Put the liquid into a pot over a  moderate fire. Make some little round dumplings (about the size of  a hickory nut) of flour and butter, and put them into the soup.  When it comes to a boil, put in the clams, and keep them boiling  an hour. Take them out before you send the soup to table.    When the soup is done, take out the bunch of parsley. Have ready  some toasted bread cut into small squares or dice.

There is the thick stone wall that goes all about the town. On  its wide top the soldiers used to stand to fight in ancient days. Now  the stones are fallen; its towers are broken; its gates are open. Yet  there the battered little giant stands at its task of protecting the  town. Out of its eight gates stretch the paved streets.    Perhaps some day you will cross the ocean to visit this \"dead city.\"  It lies on a slope at the foot of Vesuvius. Behind stands the tall,  graceful volcano with its floating feather of steam and smoke. In front  lies a little plain, and beyond it a long ridge of steep mountains. Off  at the side shines the dark blue sea with island peaks rising out of it.  On hillsides and plain are green vineyards and dark forests dotted with  white farmhouses.    In some places there are high mounds of dirt outside the city wall. They  are made by the ashes that have been dug out by the excavators and piled  here. If you climb one of them you will be able to look over the city.  You will find it a little place--less than a mile long and half a mile  wide inside its ragged wall. And yet many thousand people used to live  here. So the houses had to be crowded together. You will see no grassy  lawns nor vacant lots nor playgrounds nor parks with pleasant trees.  Many narrow streets cross one another and cut the city into solid blocks  of buildings. You will be confused because you will see thousands of  broken walls standing up, but no roofs. They are gone--crushed by the  piling ashes long ago.    At last you will come down and go in at one of the gates through the  rough, thick wall, past the empty watch towers. You will tread the very  paving stones that men's feet trampled nineteen hundred years ago as  they fled from the volcano. You will climb a steep, narrow street. This  is the street the fishermen and sailors used in olden times when they  came in from the river or sea, carrying baskets of fish or leading mules  loaded with goods from their ships. This is the street where people  poured out to the sea on that terrible day of the eruption.    You will pass a ruined temple of Apollo with standing columns and lonely  altar and steps that lead to a room that is gone. A little farther on  you will come out into a large open paved space. It is the forum. This  used to be the busiest place in all Pompeii. At certain hours of the day  it was filled with little tables and with merchants calling out and with  gentlemen and slaves buying good's. But now it is empty and very still.  Around the sides a few beautiful columns are yet standing with carved  marble at the top connecting them. But others lie broken, and most of  them are gone entirely. This is all that is left of the porches where  men used to walk and talk of business and war and politics and gossip.    At one end of the forum is a high stone platform and wide stone steps  leading up to a row of broken columns in front of a fallen wall. This is  the ruin of the temple of Jupiter, the great Roman god. Daily, men used  to come here to pray before a statue in a dim room. Here, in the ruins,  the excavators found the head of that statue--a beautiful marble thing  with long curling hair and beard, and calm face. They found, too, a  great broken body of marble. And in that large body a smaller statue was  partly carved. This was a puzzling thing, but the excavators studied it  out at last. They said:    \"Old Roman books tell us that sixteen years before the great eruption  there had been another earthquake. It had shaken down many buildings and  had cracked many walls. But the people loved their city, and when the  earthquake was over, they began to rebuild and to make their houses and  temples better than ever. We have found many signs of that earthquake.  We have found uncarved blocks of marble in the forum. Evidently masons  were at work there when the eruption stopped them. We have found rebuilt  walls in some of the houses. And here is the temple of Jupiter being  used as a marble shop. Probably the early earthquake had shaken down and  broken the statue of the god. A sculptor was set to work to carve a new  one from the ruin. But suddenly the volcano burst forth, the artist  dropped his chisel and mallet, and here we have found his unfinished  work--a statue within a statue.\"    Behind the roofless porches of the forum are other ruined  buildings--where the officers of the city did business, where the  citizens met to vote, where tailors spread out their cloth and sold  robes and cloaks. One large market building is particularly interesting.  You will enter a courtyard with walls all around it and signs of lost  porches. Broken partitions show where little stalls used to open upon  the court. Other stalls opened upon the street. In some of these the  excavators found, buried in the ashes and charred by the fire, figs,  chestnuts, plums, grapes, glass dishes of fruit, loaves of bread, and  little cakes. Were customers buying the night's dessert when Vesuvius  frightened them away? In a cool corner of the building is a fish market  with sloping marble counter. Near it in the middle of the courtyard are  the bases of columns arranged in a circle around a deep basin in the  floor. In the bottom of this basin the excavators found a thick layer  of fish scales. Evidently the masters used to buy their fish from the  market in the corner. Then the slaves carried them here to the shaded  pool of water and cleaned them and scaled them and washed them. In  another corner the excavators found skeletons of sheep. Here was a  pen for live animals which a man might buy for his banquet or for a  sacrifice to his gods. His slave would lead the sheep away through the  crowds. But on that terrible day when the volcano belched, the poor  bleating animals were deserted. Their pen held them and the ashes  covered them and to-day we can see their skeletons.    The walls around the market are still standing, though the top is broken  and the roof is fallen. They are still covered with paintings. If you  will look at them you can guess what used to be for sale here. There are  game birds and fish and wine jars all pictured here in beautiful colors.  There are cupids playing about a flour mill and cupids weaving garlands.  There are also pictures of the gods and heroes and the deeds they did.  Imagine this painted market full of chattering people, the little shops  gay with piles of beautiful fruit and vegetables, the graceful columns  and dark porches adding beauty. Imagine these people crying out and  running and these columns swaying and falling when Vesuvius bellowed and  shook the earth. And yet we can see the very fruits that men were buying  and the pictures they were enjoying.    The forum with its markets and shops and offices and temples and statues  was the very heart of the city. Many streets led into it. Perhaps you  will walk down one of them, between broken walls, past open doorways.  After several street corners you will come to a large building with high  walls still standing and with tall, arched entrance. This also was one  of the gay places in Pompeii, for it was a bathhouse. Every day all  the ladies and gentlemen of the town came strolling toward it down the  streets. The men went in at the wide doorway. The women turned and  entered their own apartments around the corner. And as they walked  toward the entrance they passed little shops built into the walls of  the bathhouse. At every stall stood the shopkeeper, bowing, smiling,  begging, calling. \"Perfumes, sweet lady!\"    \"Rings, rings, beautiful madam, for your beautiful fingers!\"    \"Oil for your body, sir, after the bath!\"    \"A taste of sweets, madam, before you enter! Honey cakes of my own  making!\"    \"Don't forget to buy my dressing for your hair before you go in! You'll  get nothing like it in there.\"    So they chattered and called and coaxed. Some of the people bought, and  some went laughing by and entered the bathhouse. As the gentlemen went  in, a large court opened before them. Here were men bowling or jumping  or running or punching the bag or playing ball or taking some other kind  of exercise before the bath. Others were resting in the shade of the  porches. A poet sat in a cool corner reading his verses to a few  listeners. Some men, after their games, were scraping their sweating  bodies with the strigil. Others were splashing in the marble  swimming tank. Here and there barbers were working over handsome  gentlemen--smoothing their faces, perfuming their hair, polishing their  nails. There was talk and laughter everywhere. Men were lazily coming  and going through a door that led into the baths. There were large rooms  with high ceilings and painted walls. In one we can still see the round  marble basin. The walls are painted with trees and birds and swimming  fish and statues. It was like bathing in a beautiful garden to bathe  here. Another room was for the hot bath, with double walls and hot air  circulating between to make the whole room warm. The bathhouse was a  great building full of comforts. No wonder that all the idle Pompeians  came here to bathe, to play, to visit, to tell and hear the news. It was  a gay and noisy place. We have a letter that one of those old Romans  wrote to a friend. He says:    \"I am living near a bath. Sounds are heard on all sides. The men of  strong muscle exercise and swing the heavy lead weights. I hear their  groans as they strain, and the whistling of their breath. I hear the  massagist slapping a lazy fellow who is being rubbed with ointment. A  ball player begins to play and counts his throws. Perhaps there is a  sudden quarrel, or a thief is caught, or some one is singing in the  bath. And the bathers plunge into the swimming tank with loud splashes.  Above all the din you hear the calls of the hair puller and the sellers  of cakes and sweetmeats and"]]]
