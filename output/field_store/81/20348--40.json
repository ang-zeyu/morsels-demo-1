[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6440"],[0,"Elsie Dinsmore (#5)"],[1,"housekeeper whom Adelaide had mentioned, and who had  assisted Chloe in the care of the child from the time of her birth  until a few months before Rose's coming, when she had suddenly been  summoned home to Scotland--had proved a very faithful friend. She was  an intelligent woman and devotedly pious, and had carefully instructed  this lonely little one, for whom she felt almost a parent's affection,  and her efforts to bring her to a saving knowledge of Christ had been  signally owned and blessed of God; and in answer to her earnest  prayers, the Holy Spirit had vouchsafed His teachings, without which  all human instruction must ever be in vain. And young as Elsie was, she  had already a very lovely and well-developed Christian character.  Though not a remarkably precocious child in other respects, she seemed  to have very clear and correct views on almost every subject connected  with her duty to God and her neighbor; was very truthful both in word  and deed, very strict in her observance of the Sabbath--though the rest  of the family were by no means particular in that respect--very  diligent in her studies, respectful to superiors, and kind to inferiors  and equals; and she was gentle, sweet-tempered, patient, and forgiving  to a remarkable degree. Rose became strongly attached to her, and the  little girl fully returned her affection.    Elsie was very sensitive and affectionate, and felt keenly the want of  sympathy and love, for which, at the time of Rose's coming, she had no  one to look to but poor old Chloe, who loved her with all her heart.    It is true, Adelaide sometimes treated her almost affectionately, and  Lora, who had a very strong sense of justice, occasionally interfered  and took her part when she was very unjustly accused, but no one seemed  really to care for her, and she often felt sad and lonely. Mr.  Dinsmore, though her own grandfather, treated her with entire neglect,  seemed to have not the slightest affection for her, and usually spoke  of her as \"old Crayson's grandchild.\" Mrs. Dinsmore really disliked  her, because she looked upon her as the child of a stepson for whom she  had never felt any affection, and also as the future rival of her own  children; while the governess and the younger members of the family,  following the example of their elders, treated her with neglect, and  occasionally even with abuse. Miss Day, knowing that she was in no  danger of incurring the displeasure of her superiors by so doing,  vented upon her all the spite she dared not show to her other pupils;  and continually she was made to give up her toys and pleasures to Enna,  and even sometimes to Arthur and Walter. It often cost her a struggle,  and had she possessed less of the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit,  her life had been wretched indeed.    But in spite of all her trials and vexations, little Elsie was the  happiest person in the family; for she had in her heart that peace  which the world can neither give nor take away; that joy which the  Saviour gives to His own, and no man taketh from them. She constantly  carried all her sorrows and troubles to Him, and the coldness and  neglect of others seemed but to drive her nearer to that Heavenly  Friend, until she felt that while possessed of His love, she could not  be unhappy, though treated with scorn and abuse by all the world.       \"The good are better made by ill,      As odors crushed are sweeter still;\"    And even so it seemed to be with little Elsie; her trials seemed to  have only the effect of purifying and making more lovely her naturally  amiable character.    Elsie talked much and thought more of her absent and unknown father,  and longed with an intensity of desire for his return home. It was her  dream, by day and by night, that he had come, that he had taken her to  his heart, calling her \"his own darling child, his precious little  Elsie;\" for such were the loving epithets she often heard lavished upon  Enna, and which she longed to hear addressed to herself. But from month  to month, and year to year, that longed-for return had been delayed  until the little heart had grown sick with hope deferred, and was often  weary with its almost hopeless waiting. But to return.    \"Elsie,\" said Adelaide, as Miss Allison and the little girl entered the  breakfast-room on the morning after Elsie's disappointment, \"the fair  is not over yet, and Miss Allison and I are going to ride out there  this afternoon; so, if you are a good girl in school, you may go with  us.\"    \"Oh! thank you, dear Aunt Adelaide,\" exclaimed the little girl,  clapping her hands with delight; \"how kind you are! and I shall be so  glad.\"    Miss Day frowned, and looked as if she wanted to reprove her for her  noisy demonstrations of delight, but, standing somewhat in awe of  Adelaide, said nothing.    But Elsie suddenly relapsed into silence, for at that moment Mrs.  Dinsmore entered the room, and it was seldom that she could utter a  word in her presence without being reproved and told that \"children  should be seen and not heard,\" though her own were allowed to talk as  much as they pleased.    Miss Day seemed cross, Mrs. Dinsmore was moody and taciturn,  complaining of headache, and Mr. Dinsmore occupied with the morning  paper; and so the meal passed off in almost unbroken silence. Elsie was  glad when it was over, and hastening to the school-room, she began her  tasks without waiting for the arrival of the regular hour for study.    She had the room entirely to herself, and had been busily engaged for  half an hour in working out her examples, when the opening of the door  caused her to look up, and, to her dismay, Arthur entered. He did not,  however, as she feared, begin his customary course of teasing and  tormenting, but seated himself at his desk, leaning his head upon his  hand in an attitude of dejection.    Elsie wondered what ailed him, his conduct was so unusual, and she  could not help every now and then sending an inquiring glance toward  him, and at length she asked, \"What is the matter, Arthur?\"    \"Nothing much,\" said he, gruffly, turning his back to her.    Thus repulsed, she said no more, but gave her undivided attention to  her employment; and so diligent was she, that Miss Day had no excuse  whatever for fault-finding this morning. Her tasks were all completed  within the required time, and she enjoyed her promised ride with her  aunt and Miss Allison, and her visit to the fair, very much indeed.    It was still early when they returned; and finding that she had nearly  an hour to dispose of before tea-time, Elsie thought she would finish a  drawing which she had left in her desk in the school-room. While  searching for it and her pencil, she heard Lora's and Arthur's voices  on the veranda.    She did not notice what they were saying, until her own name struck her  ear.    \"Elsie is the only person,\" Lora was saying, \"who can, and probably  will, help you; for she has plenty of money, and she is so kind and  generous; but, if I were you, I should be ashamed to ask her, after the  way you acted toward her.\"    \"I wish I hadn't teased her so yesterday,\" replied Arthur,  disconsolately, \"but it's such fun, I can't help it sometimes.\"    \"Well, I know I wouldn't ask a favor of anybody I had treated so,\" said  Lora, walking away.    Elsie sat still a few moments, working at her drawing and wondering all  the time what it was Arthur wanted, and thinking how glad she would be  of an opportunity of returning him good for evil. She did not like,  though, to seek his confidence, but presently hearing him heave a deep  sigh, she rose and went out on the veranda.    He was leaning on the railing in an attitude of dejection, his head  bent down and his eyes fixed on the floor. She went up to him, and  laying her hand softly on his shoulder, said, in the sweet, gentle  tones natural to her. \"What ails you, Arthur? Can I do anything for  you? I will be very glad if I can.\"    \"No--yes--\" he answered hesitatingly; \"I wouldn't like to ask you  after--after--\"    \"Oh! never mind,\" said Elsie, quickly; \"I do not care anything about  that now. I had the ride to-day, and that was better still, because I  went with Aunt Adelaide and Miss Allison. Tell me what you want.\"    Thus encouraged, Arthur replied, \"I saw a beautiful little ship  yesterday when I was in the city; it was only five dollars, and I've  set my heart on having it, but my pocket money's all gone, and papa  won't give me a cent until next month's allowance is due; and by that  time the ship will be gone, for it's such a beauty somebody'll be sure  to buy it.\"    \"Won't your mamma buy it for you?\" asked Elsie.    \"No, she says she hasn't the money to spare just now. You know it's  near the end of the month, and they've all spent their allowances  except Louise, and she says she'll not lend her money to such a  spendthrift as I am.\"    Elsie drew out her purse, and seemed just about to put it into his  hand; but, apparently changing her mind, she hesitated a moment, and  then returning it to her pocket, said, with a half smile, \"I don't  know, Arthur; five dollars is a good deal for a little girl like me to  lay out at once. I must think about it a little.\"    \"I don't ask you to _give_ it,\" he replied scornfully; \"I'll pay it  back in two weeks.\"    \"Well, I will see by to-morrow morning,\" she said, darting away, while  he sent an angry glance after her, muttering the word \"stingy\" between  his teeth.    Elsie ran down to the kitchen, asking of one and another of the  servants as she passed, \"Where's Pompey?\" The last time she put the  question to Phoebe, the cook, but was answered by Pompey himself. \"Here  am Pomp, Miss Elsie; what does little missy want wid dis chile?\"    \"Are you going to the city to-night, Pompey?\"    \"Yes, Miss Elsie, I'se got some arrants to do for missus an' de family  in ginral, an' I ben gwine start in 'bout ten minutes. Little missy  wants sumpin', eh?\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6462"],[0,"An Introduction to the mortuary customs of the North American Indians (#5)"],[1,"devil comes to the  place of death and remains where a dead body is. Wild animals  frequently (indeed, generally) get the bodies, and it is a very easy  matter to pick up skulls and bones around old camping grounds, or  where the dead are laid. In case it is not desirable to abandon a  place, the sick person is left out in some lone spot protected by  brush, where they are either abandoned to their fate or food brought  to them until they die. This is done only when all hope is gone. I  have found bodies thus left so well inclosed with brush that wild  animals were unable to get at them; and one so left to die was revived  by a cup of coffee from our house and is still living and well.\"    Mr. J. L. Burchard, agent to the Round Valley Indians of California,  furnishes an account of burial somewhat resembling that of the  Navajos:    \"When I first came here the Indians would dig a round hole in the  ground, draw up the knees of the deceased Indian, and wrap the body  into as small a bulk as possible in blankets, tie them firmly with  cords, place them in the grave, throw in beads, baskets, clothing,  everything owned by the deceased, and often donating much extra; all  gathered around the grave wailing most pitifully, tearing their faces  with their nails till the blood would run down their cheeks, pull out  their hair, and such other heathenish conduct. These burials were  generally made under their thatch houses or very near thereto. The  house where one died was always torn down, removed, rebuilt, or  abandoned. The wailing, talks, &c., were in their own jargon; none  else could understand, and they seemingly knew but little of its  meaning (if there was any meaning in it); it simply seemed to be the  promptings of grief, without sufficient intelligence to direct any  ceremony; each seemed to act out his own impulse\"        STONE GRAVES OR CISTS.      These are of considerable interest, not only from their somewhat rare  occurrence, except in certain localities, but from the manifest care  taken by the survivors to provide for the dead what they considered a  suitable resting-place. A number of cists have been found in  Tennessee, and are thus described by Moses Fiske: [Footnote: Trans.  Amer. Antiq. Soc., 1820 vol. 1, p. 302]    \"There are many burying grounds in West Tennessee with regular graves.  They dug them 12 or 18 inches deep, placed slabs at the bottom ends  and sides, forming a kind of stone coffin, and, after laying in the  body, covered it over with earth.\"    It may be added that, in 1873, the writer assisted at the opening of a  number of graves of men of the reindeer period, near Solutre, in  France, and they were almost identical in construction with those  described by Mr. Fiske, with the exception that the latter were  deeper; this, however, may be accounted for if it is considered how  great a deposition of earth may have taken place during the many  centuries which have elapsed since the burial. Many of the graves  explored by the writer in 1875, at Santa Barbara, resembled somewhat  cist graves, the bottom and sides of the pit being lined with large  flat stones, but there were none directly over the skeletons.    The next account is by Maj. J. W. Powell, the result of his  observation in Tennessee.  \"These ancient cemeteries are exceedingly  abundant throughout the State, often hundreds of graves may be found  on a single hillside. In some places the graves are scattered and in  others collected in mounds, each mound being composed of a large  number of cist graves. It is evident that the mounds were not  constructed at one time, but the whole collection of graves therein  was made during long periods by the addition of a new grave from time  to time. In the first burials found at the bottom and near the center  of a mound a tendency to a concentric system, with the feet inward, is  observed, and additions are made around and above these first  concentric graves, as the mound increases in size the burials become  more and more irregular:    \"Some other peculiarities are of interest. A larger number of  interments exhibit the fact that the bodies were placed there before  the decay of the flesh, while in other cases collections of bones are  buried. Sometimes these bones were placed in some order about the  crania, and sometimes in irregular piles, as if the collection of  bones had been emptied from a sack. With men, pipes, stone hammers,  knives, arrowheads, &c., were usually found; with women, pottery, rude  beads, shells, &c.; with children, toys of pottery, beads, curious  pebbles, &c.    \"Sometimes, in the subsequent burials, the side slab of a previous  burial was used as a portion of the second cist. All of the cists were  covered with slabs.\"    Dr. Jones has given an exceedingly interesting account of the stone  graves of Tennessee, in his volume published by the Smithsonian  Institution, to which valuable work [Footnote: Antiquities of  Tennessee, Cont. to Knowledge, Smith. Inst., 1876, No. 259, 4 deg., pp. 1,  8, 37, 52, 55, 82.] the reader is referred for a more detailed account  of this mode of burial.        BURIAL IN MOUNDS.      In view of the fact that the subject of mound-burial is so extensive,  and that in all probability a volume by a member of the Bureau of  Ethnology may shortly be published, it is not deemed advisable to  devote any considerable space to it in this paper, but a few  interesting examples may be noted to serve as indications to future  observers.    The first to which attention is directed is interesting as resembling  cist-burial combined with deposition in mounds. The communication is  from Prof. F. W. Putnam, curator of the Peabody Museum of Archaology,  Cambridge, made to the Boston Society of Natural History, and is  published in volume XX of its proceedings, October 15, 1878:    \"...He then stated that it would be of interest to the members, in  connection with the discovery of dolmens in Japan, as described by  Professor Morse, to know that within twenty-four hours there had been  received at the Peabody Museum a small collection of articles taken  from rude dolmens (or chambered barrows, as they would be called in  England), recently opened by Mr. E. Curtiss, who is now engaged, under  his direction, in exploration for the Peabody Museum.    \"These chambered mounds are situated in the eastern part of Clay  County, Missouri, and form a large group on both sides of the Missouri  River. The chambers are, in the three opened by Mr. Curtiss, about 8  feet square, and from 4-1/2 to 5 feet high, each chamber having a  passage-way several feet in length and 2 in width leading from the  southern side and opening on the edge of the mound formed by covering  the chamber and passage-way with earth. The walls of the chambered  passages were about 2 feet thick, vertical, and well made of stones,  which were evenly laid without clay or mortar of any kind. The top of  one of the chambers had a covering of large, flat rocks, but the  others seem to have been closed over with wood. The chambers were  filled with clay which had been burnt, and appeared as if it had  fallen in from above. The inside walls of the chambers also showed  signs of fire. Under the burnt clay, in each chamber, were found the  remains of several human skeletons, all of which had been burnt to  such an extent as to leave but small fragments of the bones, which  were mixed with the ashes and charcoal. Mr. Curtiss thought that in  one chamber he found the remains of 5 skeletons and in another 13.  With these skeletons there were a few flint implements and minute  fragments of vessels of clay.    \"A large mound near the chambered mounds was also opened, but in this  no chambers were found. Neither had the bodies been burnt. This mound  proved remarkably rich in large flint implements, and also contained  well-made pottery and a peculiar \"gorget\" of red stone. The connection  of the people who placed the ashes of their dead in the stone chambers  with those who buried their dead in the earth mounds is, of course,  yet to be determined.\"    It is quite possible, indeed probable, that these chambers were used  for secondary burials, the bodies having first been cremated.    In the volume of the proceedings already quoted the same investigator  gives an account of other chambered mounds which are, like the  preceding, very interesting, the more so as adults only were inhumed  therein, children having been buried beneath the dwelling-floors:    \"Mr. F. W. Putnam occupied the rest of the evening with an account of  his explorations of the ancient mounds and burial places in the  Cumberland Valley, Tennessee.    \"The excavations had been carried on by himself, assisted by Mr. Edwin  Curtiss, for over two years, for the benefit of the Peabody Museum at  Cambridge. During this time many mounds of various kinds had been  thoroughly explored, and several thousand of the singular stone graves  of the mound builders of Tennessee had been carefully opened.... Mr.  Putnam's remarks were illustrated by drawings of several hundred  objects obtained from the graves and mounds, particularly to show the  great variety of articles of pottery and several large and many unique  forms of implements of chipped flint. He also exhibited and explained  in detail a map of a walled town of this old nation. This town was  situated on the Lindsley estate, in a bend of Spring Creek. The earth  embankment, with its accompanying ditch, encircled an area of about 12  acres. Within this inclosure there was one large mound with a flat  top, 15 feet high, 130 feet long, and 90 feet wide, which was found  not to be a burial mound. Another mound near the large one, about 50  feet in diameter, and only a few feet high, contained 60 human  skeletons, each in a carefully-made stone grave, the graves being  arranged in two rows, forming the four sides of a square, and in three  layers....
