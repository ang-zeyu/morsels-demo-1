The Emperor's soldiers were in garrison there,  with a number of peasants from the country road. M. de Vendosme  called on them to surrender; they made answer that he should  never take them, unless it were piecemeal; let him do his worst,  and they would do their best to defend themselves. They trusted  in their moats, which were full of water; but in two hours, with  plenty of faggots and casks, we made a way for our infantry to  pass over, when they had to advance to the assault; and the place  was attacked with five cannons, and a breach was made large  enough for our men to enter; where those within received the  attack very valiantly, and killed and wounded a great number of  our men with arquebuses, pikes, and stones. In the end, when they  saw themselves overpowered, they set fire to their powder and  ammunition, whereby many of our men were burned, and some of  their own. And they were almost all put to the sword; but some of  our soldiers had taken twenty or thirty, hoping to have ransom  for them: and so soon as this was known, orders were given to  proclaim by trumpet through the camp, that all soldiers who had  Spaniards for prisoners must kill them, on pain of being  themselves hanged and strangled: which was done in cold blood.    Thence we went and burned several villages; and the barns were  all full of grain, to my very great regret. We came as far as  Tournahan, where there was a large tower, whither the enemy  withdrew, but we found the place empty: our men sacked it, and  blew up the tower with a mine of gunpowder, which turned it  upside down. After that, the camp was dispersed, and I returned  to Paris. And the day after Chateau le Comte was taken, M. de  Vendosme sent a gentleman under orders to the King, to report to  him all that had happened, and among other things he told the  King I had done very good work dressing the wounded, and had  showed him eighteen bullets that I had taken out of their bodies,  and there were many more that I had not been able to find or take  out; and he spoke more good of me than there was by half. Then  the King said he would take me into his service, and commanded M.  de Goguier, his first physician, to write me down in the King's  service as one of his surgeons-in-ordinary, and I was to meet him  at Rheims within ten or twelve days: which I did. And the King  did me the honour to command me to live near him, and he would be  a good friend to me. Then I thanked him most humbly for the  honour he was pleased to do me, in appointing me to serve him.          THE JOURNEY TO METZ. 1552      The Emperor having besieged Metz with more than an hundred and  twenty thousand men, and in the hardest time of winter,--it is  still fresh in the minds of all--and there were five or six  thousand men in the town, and among them seven princes; MM. le  Duc de Guise, the King's Lieutenant, d'Enghien, de Conde, de la  Montpensier, de la Roche-sur-Yon, de Nemours, and many other  gentlemen, with a number of veteran captains and officers: who  often sallied out against the enemy (as I shall tell hereafter),  not without heavy loss on both sides. Our wounded died almost  all, and it was thought the drugs wherewith they were dressed had  been poisoned. Wherefore M. de Guise, and MM. the princes, went  so far as to beg the King that if it were possible I should be  sent to them with a supply of drugs, and they believed their  drugs were poisoned, seeing that few of their wounded escaped. My  belief is that there was no poison; but the severe cutlass and  arquebus wounds, and the extreme cold, were the cause why so many  died. The King wrote to M. the Marshal de Saint Andre, who was  his Lieutenant at Verdun, to find means to get me into Metz,  whatever way was possible. MM. the Marshal de Saint Andre, and  the Marshal de Vielleville, won over an Italian captain, who  promised to get me into the place, which he did (and for this he  had fifteen hundred crowns). The King having heard the promise  that the Italian captain had made, sent for me, and commanded me  to take of his apothecary, named Daigne, so many and such drugs  as I should think necessary for the wounded within the town;  which I did, as much as a post-horse could carry. The King gave  me messages to M. de Guise, and to the princes and the captains  that were in Metz.    When I came to Verdun, some days after, M. the Marshal de Saint  Andre got horses for me and for my man, and for the Italian  captain, who spoke excellent German, Spanish, and Walloon, beside  his own mother-tongue. When we were within eight or ten leagues  of Metz, we began to go by night only; and when we came near the  enemy's camp I saw, more than a league and a half off, fires  lighted all round the town, as if the whole earth were burning;  and I believed we could never pass through these fires without  being discovered, and therefore hanged and strangled, or cut in  pieces, or made to pay a great ransom. To speak truth, I could  well and gladly have wished myself back in Paris, for the great  danger that I foresaw. God guided our business so well, that we  entered into the town at midnight, thanks to a signal the captain  had with another captain of the company of M. de Guise; to whom I  went, and found him in bed, and he received me with high favour,  being right glad at my coming.    I gave him my message as the King had commanded me, and told him  I had a little letter for him, and the next day I would not fail  to deliver it. Then he ordered me a good lodging, and that I  should be well treated, and said I must not fail next morning to  be upon the breach, where I should find all the princes and  seigneurs, and many captains. Which I did, and they received me  with great joy, and did me the honour to embrace me, and tell me  I was welcome; adding they would no more be afraid of dying, if  they should happen to be wounded.    M. le Prince de la Roche-sur-Yon was the first who entertained  me, and inquired what they were saying at the Court concerning  the town of Metz. I told him all that I chose to tell. Forthwith  he begged me to go and see one of his gentlemen named M. de  Magnane, now Chevalier of the Order of the King, and Lieutenant  of His Majesty's Guards, who had his leg broken by a cannon-shot.  I found him in bed, his leg bent and crooked, without any  dressing on it, because a gentleman promised to cure him, having  his name and his girdle, with certain words (and the poor patient  was weeping and crying out with pain, not sleeping day or night  for four days past). Then I laughed at such cheating and false  promises; and I reduced and dressed his leg so skilfully that he  was without pain, and slept all the night, and afterward, thanks  be to God, he was healed, and is still living now, in the King's  service. The Prince de la Roche-sur-Yon sent me a cask of wine,  bigger than a pipe of Anjou, to my lodging, and told me when it  was drunk, he would send me another; that was how he treated me,  most generously.    After this, M, de Guise gave me a list of certain captains and  seigneurs, and bade me tell them what the King had charged me to  say; which I did, and this was to commend him to them, and give  them his thanks for the duty they had done and were doing in  holding his town of Metz, and that he would remember it. I was  more than eight days acquitting myself of this charge, because  they were many. First, to all the princes; then to others, as the  Duke Horace, the Count de Martigues, and his brother M. de Bauge,  the Seigneurs de Montmorency and d'Anville, now Marshal of  France, M. de la Chapelle aux Ursins, Bonnivet, Carouge, now  Governor of Rouen, the Vidasme de Chartres, the Count de Lude, M.  de Biron, now Marshal of France, M. de Randan, la Rochefoucaut,  Bordaille, d' Estres the younger, M. de Saint Jehan en pauphine,  and many others whom it would take too long to name; and also to  many captains, who had all done their duty well for the defence  of their lives and of the town. Afterward I asked M. de Guise  what it pleased him I should do with the drugs I had brought with  me; he bade me distribute them to the surgeons and apothecaries,  and principally to the poor wounded soldiers, who were in great  numbers in the Hospital. Which I did, and can truly say I could  not so much as go and see all the wounded, who kept sending for  me to visit and dress them.    All the seigneurs within the town asked me to give special care,  above all the rest; to M. de Pienne, who had been wounded, while  on the breach, by a stone shot from a cannon, on the temple, with  fracture and depression of the bone. They told me that so soon as  he received the blow, he fell to the ground as dead, and cast  forth blood by the mouth, nose, and ears, with great vomiting,  and was fourteen days without being able to speak or reason; also  he had tremors of a spasmodic nature, and all his face was  swelled and livid, He was trepanned at the side of the temporal  muscle, over the frontal bone. I dressed him, with other  surgeons, and God healed him; and to-day he is still living,  thank God.    The Emperor attacked the town with forty double cannons, and the  powder was not spared day or night. So soon as M. de Guise saw  the artillery set and pointed to make a breach, he had the  nearest houses pulled down and made into ramparts, and the beams  and joists were put end to end, and between them faggots, earth,  beds, and wool-packs; then they put above them other beams and  joists as before. And there was plenty of wood from the houses in  the suburbs; which had been razed to the ground, for fear the  enemy should get under cover of them, and make use of the wood;  it did very well for repairing the breach. Everybody was hard at  work carrying earth to repair it, day and night; MM. the princes,  the seigneurs, and captains, lieutenants, ensigns, were all  carrying the basket, to set an example"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5697"],[0,"Tales of Chinatown (#5)"],[1,"streets, he found his  brain to be extraordinarily active and his imagination very much alive.    There is a night life in Limehouse, as he had learned, but it is a mole  life, a subterranean life, of which no sign appears above ground after a  certain hour. Nevertheless, as he entered the area which harbours those  strange, hidden resorts the rumour of which has served to create the  glamour of Chinatown, he found himself to be thinking of the great  influence said to be wielded by Huang Chow, and wondering if unseen  spies watched his movements.    Lala was Oriental, and now, alone in the night, distrust leapt into  being within him. He had been attracted by her and had pitied her.  He told himself now that this was because of her dark beauty and the  essentially feminine appeal which she made. She was perhaps a vampire  of the most dangerous sort, one who lured men to strange deaths for some  sinister object beyond reach of a Western imagination.    He found himself doubting the success of those tactics upon which,  earlier in the day, he had congratulated himself. Perhaps beneath the  guise of Hampden, who bought antique furniture on commission, those  cunning old eyes beneath the horn-rimmed spectacles had perceived the  detective hidden, or at least had marked subterfuge.    While he could not count Lala a conquest--for he had not even  attempted to make love to her--the ease with which he had developed the  acquaintance now, afforded matter for suspicion.    At the entrance to the court communicating with the establishment of  Huang Chow he paused, looking cautiously about him. The men on the  Limehouse beats had been warned of the investigation afoot tonight, and  there was a plain-clothes man on point duty at no great distance away,  although carefully hidden, so that Durham had quite failed to detect his  presence.    Durham wore rough clothes and rubber-soled shoes; and now, as he entered  the court, he was thinking of the official report of the police sergeant  who, not so many hours before, had paid a visit to the house of Huang  Chow in order to question him respecting his knowledge of the dead man  Cohen, and to learn when last he had seen him.    Old Huang, who had received his caller in the large room upstairs, the  room which boasted the presence of the writing-dais, had exhibited no  trace of confusion, assuring the sergeant that he had not seen the  man Cohen for several days. Cohen had come to him with an American  introduction, which he, Huang, believed to be forged, and had wanted him  to undertake a shady agency, respecting the details of which he remained  peculiarly reticent. In short, nothing had been gained by this official  interrogation, and Huang blandly denied any knowledge of an attempted  burglary of his establishment.    \"What have I to lose?\" he had asked the inquirer. \"A lot of old lumber  which I have accumulated during many years, and a reputation for being  wealthy, due to my lonely habits and to the ignorance of those who live  around me.\"    Durham, mentally reviewing the words of the report, reconstructed the  scene in his mind; and now, having come to the end of the lane where  the iron post rested, he stood staring up at a place in the ancient wall  where several bricks had decayed, and where it was possible, according  to the statement of the man Poland, to climb up on to a piece of sloping  roof, and thence gain the skylight through which Cohen had obtained  admittance on the night of his death.    He made sure that his automatic pistol was in his pocket, questioned the  dull sounds of the riverside for a moment, looking about him anxiously,  and then, using the leaning post as a stepping-stone, he succeeded in  wedging his foot into a crevice in the wall. By the exercise of some  agility he scrambled up to the top, and presently found himself lying  upon a sloping roof.    The skylight remained well out of reach, but his rubber-soled shoes  enabled him to creep up the slates until he could grasp the framework  with his hands. Presently he found himself perched upon the trap which,  if his information could be relied upon, possessed no fastener, or  one so faulty that the trap could be raised by means of a brad-awl.  He carried one in his pocket, and, screwing it into the framework, he  lifted it cautiously, making very little noise.    The trap opened, and up to his nostrils there stole a queer, indefinable  odour, partly that which belongs to old Oriental furniture and stuffs,  but having mingled with it a hint of incense and of something else not  so easily named. He recognized the smell of that strange store-room,  which, as Mr. Hampden, he had recently visited.    For one moment he thought he could detect the distant note of a bell.  But, listening, he heard nothing, and was reassured.    He rested the trap back against the frame, and shone the ray of an  electric torch down into the darkness beneath him. The light fell upon  the top of a low carven table, dragon-legged and gilded. Upon it rested  the model pagoda constructed of human teeth, and there was something in  this discovery which made Durham feel inclined to shudder. However, the  impulse was only a passing one.    He measured the distance with his eye. The little table stood beside a  deep divan, and he saw that with care it would be possible to drop upon  this divan without making much noise. He calculated its exact position  before replacing the torch in his pocket, and then, resting back against  one side of the frame, he clutched the other with his hands. He wriggled  gradually down until further purchase became impossible. He then let  himself drop, and swung for a moment by his hands before releasing his  hold.    He fell, as he had calculated, upon the divan. It creaked ominously.  Catching his foot in the cushions, he stumbled and lay forward for a  moment upon his face, listening intently.    The room was very hot but nothing stirred.          VII    THE SCUFFLING SOUND        Detective Durham, as he lay there inhaling the peculiar perfume of the  place, recognized that he had put himself outside the pale of official  protection, and was become technically a burglar.    He wondered if Chief Inspector Kerry would have approved; but he had  outlined this plan of investigation for himself, and knew well that,  if it were crowned by success, the end would be regarded as having  justified the means. On the other hand, in the event of detention he  must personally bear the consequences of such irregular behaviour. He  knew well, however, that his celebrated superior had achieved promotion  by methods at least as irregular; and he knew that if he could but  obtain evidence to account for the death of the man Cohen, and of the  Chinaman Pi Lung, who had preceded him by the same mysterious path, the  way of his obtaining it would not be too closely questioned.    He was an ambitious man, and consequently one who took big chances.  Nothing disturbed the silence; he sat upon the divan and again pressed  the button of his torch, shining it all about the low-beamed apartment  and peering curiously into the weird shadows of the place. He calculated  he was now in the position which Cohen had occupied during the last  moments of his life, and a sense of the uncanny touched him coldly.    As he thought of the unnatural screams spoken of by Poland, some strange  instinct prompted him to curl up his feet upon the divan again, as  though a secret menace crawled upon the floor amid its many rugs and  carpets.    He must now endeavour to reconstruct the plan upon which the American  cracksman had operated. Poland had a persistent belief that Cohen had  known where the fabled hoard of Huang Chow was concealed.    Durham began a deliberate inspection of the place. He thought it  unlikely that a wily old Chinaman, assuming that he possessed hidden  wealth, would keep it in so accessible a spot as this. It was far more  probable that he had a fireproof safe in the room upstairs, perhaps  built into the wall. Yet, according to Poland's account, it was in this  room and not in any other that death came to Diamond Fred.    The wall-hangings first engaged Durham's attention. He moved them aside  systematically, one after another, seeking for any hiding-place, but  failing to find one. The door communicating with the outer office he  found to be locked, but he did not believe for a moment that the office  would be worthy of inspection.    There were cases containing jewelled weapons and cups and goblets inlaid  with precious stones, but none of these seemed to have been tampered  with, and all were locked, as was the big cabinet filled with snuff  bottles.    Many of the larger pieces about the place contained drawers and  cupboards, and these he systematically opened one after another, without  making any discovery of note. Some of the cupboards contained broken  pieces of crockery, and more or less damaged curios of one kind and  another, but none of them gave him the clue for which he was seeking.    He examined the couch upon which Huang Chow had been seated when first  he had met him, but although he searched it scientifically he was  rewarded by no discovery.    A very fusty and unpleasant smell was more noticeable at this point than  elsewhere in the room, and he found himself staring speculatively up  the wide, carpeted stairs. Next he turned his attention to the lacquered  coffin which occupied the corresponding recess to that filled by the  couch. It was an extraordinarily ornate piece of lacquer work and  probably of great value.    The lid appeared to be screwed on, and Durham stood staring at the  thing, half revolted and half fascinated. He failed to discover any  means of opening it, however, and when he tried to move it bodily found  it very heavy. He came to the conclusion that all the portable valuables  were contained in locked cases or cabinets, and out of this discovery  grew an idea."]]]
