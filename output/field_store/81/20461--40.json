Nor has any neutral nation such a jurisdiction over her merchant  vessels upon the high seas as to exclude a belligerent nation from  the right of searching them for contraband of war or for the property  or persons of her enemies. And if, in the exercise of that right,  the belligerent should discover on board of the neutral vessel a  subject who has withdrawn himself from his lawful allegiance, the  neutral can have no fair ground for refusing to deliver him up;  more especially if that subject is proved to be a deserter from  the sea or land service of the former.\" [Footnote: \"The Naval History  of Great Britain,\" by William James, vol. iv, p. 324. (New edition  by Captain Chamier, R. N., London, 1837.)]    Great Britain's doctrine was \"once a subject always a subject.\" On  the other hand, the United States maintained that any foreigner,  after five years' residence within her territory, and after having  complied with certain forms, became one of her citizens as completely  as if he was native born. Great Britain contended that her war  ships possessed the right of searching all neutral vessels for the  property and persons of her foes. The United States, resisting this  claim, asserted that \"free bottoms made free goods,\" and that  consequently her ships when on the high seas should not be molested  on any pretext whatever. Finally, Great Britain's system of  impressment, [Footnote: The best idea of which can be gained by  reading Marryatt's novels.] by which men could be forcibly seized  and made to serve in her navy, no matter at what cost to themselves,  was repugnant to every American idea.    Such wide differences in the views of the two nations produced  endless difficulties. To escape the press-gang, or for other  reasons, many British seamen took service under the American flag;  and if they were demanded back, it is not likely that they or their  American shipmates had much hesitation in swearing either that they  were not British at all, or else that they had been naturalized as  Americans. Equally probable is it that the American blockade-runners  were guilty of a great deal of fraud and more or less thinly veiled  perjury. But the wrongs done by the Americans were insignificant  compared with those they received. Any innocent merchant vessel  was liable to seizure at any moment; and when overhauled by a  British cruiser short of men was sure to be stripped of most of  her crew. The British officers were themselves the judges as to  whether a seaman should be pronounced a native of America or of  Britain, and there was no appeal from their judgment. If a captain  lacked his full complement there was little doubt as to the view  he would take of any man's nationality. The wrongs inflicted on our  seafaring countrymen by their impressment into foreign ships formed  the main cause of the war.    There were still other grievances which are thus presented by the  British Admiral Cochrane. [Footnote: \"Autobiography of a Seaman,\"  by Thomas, tenth Earl of Dundonald, Admiral of the Red; Rear-Admiral  of the Fleet, London, 1860, vol. i, p. 24.] \"Our treatment of its  (America's) citizens was scarcely in accordance with the national  privileges to which the young Republic had become entitled. There  were no doubt many individuals among the American people who, caring  little for the Federal Government, considered it more profitable  to break than to keep the laws of nations by aiding and supporting  our enemy (France), and it was against such that the efforts of the  squadron had chiefly been directed; but the way the object was  carried out was scarcely less an infraction of those national laws  which we were professedly enforcing. The practice of taking English  (and American) seamen out of American ships without regard to the  safety of navigating them when thus deprived of their hands has  been already mentioned. To this may be added the detention of  vessels against which nothing contrary to international neutrality  could be established, whereby their cargoes became damaged; the  compelling them, on suspicion only, to proceed to ports other than  those to which they were destined; and generally treating them as  though they were engaged in contraband trade. * * * American ships  were not permitted to quit English ports without giving security  for the discharge of their cargoes in some other British or neutral  port.\" On the same subject James [Footnote: _L. c._, iv, 325.]  writes: \"When, by the maritime supremacy of England, France could  no longer trade for herself, America proffered her services, as a  neutral, to trade for her; and American merchants and their agents,  in the gains that flowed in, soon found a compensation for all the  perjury and fraud necessary to cheat the former out of her  belligerent rights. The high commercial importance of the United  States thus obtained, coupled with a similarity of language and,  to a superficial observer, a resemblance in person between the  natives of America and Great Britain, has caused the former to be  the chief, if not the only sufferers by the exercise of the right  of search. Chiefly indebted for their growth and prosperity to  emigration from Europe, the United States hold out every allurement  to foreigners, particularly to British seamen, whom, by a process  peculiarly their own, they can naturalize"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/917"],[0,"Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of 'Eighty (#5)"],[1,"it.    'That was the bell I heard.    'A bureau was found opened, and a cash-box, which Mr Haredale had  brought down that day, and was supposed to contain a large sum of money,  was gone. The steward and gardener were both missing and both suspected  for a long time, but they were never found, though hunted far and wide.  And far enough they might have looked for poor Mr Rudge the steward,  whose body--scarcely to be recognised by his clothes and the watch and  ring he wore--was found, months afterwards, at the bottom of a piece of  water in the grounds, with a deep gash in the breast where he had been  stabbed with a knife. He was only partly dressed; and people all agreed  that he had been sitting up reading in his own room, where there were  many traces of blood, and was suddenly fallen upon and killed before his  master.    Everybody now knew that the gardener must be the murderer, and though  he has never been heard of from that day to this, he will be, mark my  words. The crime was committed this day two-and-twenty years--on the  nineteenth of March, one thousand seven hundred and fifty-three. On the  nineteenth of March in some year--no matter when--I know it, I am sure  of it, for we have always, in some strange way or other, been brought  back to the subject on that day ever since--on the nineteenth of March  in some year, sooner or later, that man will be discovered.'        Chapter 2      'A strange story!' said the man who had been the cause of the  narration.--'Stranger still if it comes about as you predict. Is that  all?'    A question so unexpected, nettled Solomon Daisy not a little. By dint of  relating the story very often, and ornamenting it (according to village  report) with a few flourishes suggested by the various hearers from time  to time, he had come by degrees to tell it with great effect; and 'Is  that all?' after the climax, was not what he was accustomed to.    'Is that all?' he repeated, 'yes, that's all, sir. And enough too, I  think.'    'I think so too. My horse, young man! He is but a hack hired from a  roadside posting house, but he must carry me to London to-night.'    'To-night!' said Joe.    'To-night,' returned the other. 'What do you stare at? This tavern  would seem to be a house of call for all the gaping idlers of the  neighbourhood!'    At this remark, which evidently had reference to the scrutiny he had  undergone, as mentioned in the foregoing chapter, the eyes of John  Willet and his friends were diverted with marvellous rapidity to the  copper boiler again. Not so with Joe, who, being a mettlesome fellow,  returned the stranger's angry glance with a steady look, and rejoined:    'It is not a very bold thing to wonder at your going on to-night. Surely  you have been asked such a harmless question in an inn before, and in  better weather than this. I thought you mightn't know the way, as you  seem strange to this part.'    'The way--' repeated the other, irritably.    'Yes. DO you know it?'    'I'll--humph!--I'll find it,' replied the man, waving his hand and  turning on his heel. 'Landlord, take the reckoning here.'    John Willet did as he was desired; for on that point he was seldom slow,  except in the particulars of giving change, and testing the goodness of  any piece of coin that was proffered to him, by the application of his  teeth or his tongue, or some other test, or in doubtful cases, by a long  series of tests terminating in its rejection. The guest then wrapped his  garments about him so as to shelter himself as effectually as he could  from the rough weather, and without any word or sign of farewell betook  himself to the stableyard. Here Joe (who had left the room on the  conclusion of their short dialogue) was protecting himself and the horse  from the rain under the shelter of an old penthouse roof.    'He's pretty much of my opinion,' said Joe, patting the horse upon the  neck. 'I'll wager that your stopping here to-night would please him  better than it would please me.'    'He and I are of different opinions, as we have been more than once on  our way here,' was the short reply.    'So I was thinking before you came out, for he has felt your spurs, poor  beast.'    The stranger adjusted his coat-collar about his face, and made no  answer.    'You'll know me again, I see,' he said, marking the young fellow's  earnest gaze, when he had sprung into the saddle.    'The man's worth knowing, master, who travels a road he don't know,  mounted on a jaded horse, and leaves good quarters to do it on such a  night as this.'    'You have sharp eyes and a sharp tongue, I find.'    'Both I hope by nature, but the last grows rusty sometimes for want of  using.'    'Use the first less too, and keep their sharpness for your sweethearts,  boy,' said the man.    So saying he shook his hand from the bridle, struck him roughly on the  head with the butt end of his whip, and galloped away; dashing through  the mud and darkness with a headlong speed, which few badly mounted  horsemen would have cared to venture, even had they been thoroughly  acquainted with the country; and which, to one who knew nothing of the  way he rode, was attended at every step with great hazard and danger.    The roads, even within twelve miles of London, were at that time  ill paved, seldom repaired, and very badly made. The way this rider  traversed had been ploughed up by the wheels of heavy waggons, and  rendered rotten by the frosts and thaws of the preceding winter, or  possibly of many winters. Great holes and gaps had been worn into the  soil, which, being now filled with water from the late rains, were not  easily distinguishable even by day; and a plunge into any one of them  might have brought down a surer-footed horse than the poor beast now  urged forward to the utmost extent of his powers. Sharp flints and  stones rolled from under his hoofs continually; the rider could scarcely  see beyond the animal's head, or farther on either side than his own  arm would have extended. At that time, too, all the roads in the  neighbourhood of the metropolis were infested by footpads or highwaymen,  and it was a night, of all others, in which any evil-disposed person of  this class might have pursued his unlawful calling with little fear of  detection.    Still, the traveller dashed forward at the same reckless pace,  regardless alike of the dirt and wet which flew about his head, the  profound darkness of the night, and the probability of encountering  some desperate characters abroad. At every turn and angle, even where  a deviation from the direct course might have been least expected, and  could not possibly be seen until he was close upon it, he guided the  bridle with an unerring hand, and kept the middle of the road. Thus he  sped onward, raising himself in the stirrups, leaning his body forward  until it almost touched the horse's neck, and flourishing his heavy whip  above his head with the fervour of a madman.    There are times when, the elements being in unusual commotion, those who  are bent on daring enterprises, or agitated by great thoughts, whether  of good or evil, feel a mysterious sympathy with the tumult of nature,  and are roused into corresponding violence. In the midst of thunder,  lightning, and storm, many tremendous deeds have been committed; men,  self-possessed before, have given a sudden loose to passions they could  no longer control. The demons of wrath and despair have striven to  emulate those who ride the whirlwind and direct the storm; and man,  lashed into madness with the roaring winds and boiling waters, has  become for the time as wild and merciless as the elements themselves.    Whether the traveller was possessed by thoughts which the fury of the  night had heated and stimulated into a quicker current, or was merely  impelled by some strong motive to reach his journey's end, on he swept  more like a hunted phantom than a man, nor checked his pace until,  arriving at some cross roads, one of which led by a longer route to  the place whence he had lately started, he bore down so suddenly upon a  vehicle which was coming towards him, that in the effort to avoid it he  well-nigh pulled his horse upon his haunches, and narrowly escaped being  thrown.    'Yoho!' cried the voice of a man. 'What's that? Who goes there?'    'A friend!' replied the traveller.    'A friend!' repeated the voice. 'Who calls himself a friend and rides  like that, abusing Heaven's gifts in the shape of horseflesh, and  endangering, not only his own neck (which might be no great matter) but  the necks of other people?'    'You have a lantern there, I see,' said the traveller dismounting, 'lend  it me for a moment. You have wounded my horse, I think, with your shaft  or wheel.'    'Wounded him!' cried the other, 'if I haven't killed him, it's no fault  of yours. What do you mean by galloping along the king's highway like  that, eh?'    'Give me the light,' returned the traveller, snatching it from his hand,  'and don't ask idle questions of a man who is in no mood for talking.'    'If you had said you were in no mood for talking before, I should  perhaps have been in no mood for lighting,' said the voice. 'Hows'ever  as it's the poor horse that's damaged and not you, one of you is welcome  to the light at all events--but it's not the crusty one.'    The traveller returned no answer to this speech, but holding the light  near to his panting and reeking beast, examined him in limb and carcass.  Meanwhile, the other man sat very composedly in his vehicle, which was  a kind of chaise with a depository for a large bag of tools, and watched  his proceedings with a careful eye.    The looker-on was a round, red-faced, sturdy yeoman, with a double chin,  and a voice husky with good living, good sleeping, good humour, and good  health. He was past the prime of life, but Father Time is not always a  hard parent, and, though he tarries for none of his children, often lays  his hand"]]]
