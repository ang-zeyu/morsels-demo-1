Nor nature only there lavish'd her hues,  But of the sweetness of a thousand smells  A rare and undistinguish'd fragrance made.    \"Salve Regina,\" on the grass and flowers  Here chanting I beheld those spirits sit  Who not beyond the valley could be seen.    \"Before the west'ring sun sink to his bed,\"  Began the Mantuan, who our steps had turn'd,    \"'Mid those desires not that I lead ye on.  For from this eminence ye shall discern  Better the acts and visages of all,  Than in the nether vale among them mix'd.  He, who sits high above the rest, and seems  To have neglected that he should have done,  And to the others' song moves not his lip,  The Emperor Rodolph call, who might have heal'd  The wounds whereof fair Italy hath died,  So that by others she revives but slowly,  He, who with kindly visage comforts him,  Sway'd in that country, where the water springs,  That Moldaw's river to the Elbe, and Elbe  Rolls to the ocean: Ottocar his name:  Who in his swaddling clothes was of more worth  Than Winceslaus his son, a bearded man,  Pamper'd with rank luxuriousness and ease.  And that one with the nose depress, who close  In counsel seems with him of gentle look,  Flying expir'd, with'ring the lily's flower.  Look there how he doth knock against his breast!  The other ye behold, who for his cheek  Makes of one hand a couch, with frequent sighs.  They are the father and the father-in-law  Of Gallia's bane: his vicious life they know  And foul; thence comes the grief that rends them thus.    \"He, so robust of limb, who measure keeps  In song, with him of feature prominent,  With ev'ry virtue bore his girdle brac'd.  And if that stripling who behinds him sits,  King after him had liv'd, his virtue then  From vessel to like vessel had been pour'd;  Which may not of the other heirs be said.  By James and Frederick his realms are held;  Neither the better heritage obtains.  Rarely into the branches of the tree  Doth human worth mount up; and so ordains  He who bestows it, that as his free gift  It may be call'd.  To Charles my words apply  No less than to his brother in the song;  Which Pouille and Provence now with grief confess.  So much that plant degenerates from its seed,  As more than Beatrice and Margaret  Costanza still boasts of her valorous spouse.    \"Behold the king of simple life and plain,  Harry of England, sitting there alone:  He through his branches better issue spreads.    \"That one, who on the ground beneath the rest  Sits lowest, yet his gaze directs aloft,  Us William, that brave Marquis, for whose cause  The deed of Alexandria and his war  Makes Conferrat and Canavese weep.\"          CANTO VIII    Now was the hour that wakens fond desire  In men at sea, and melts their thoughtful heart,  Who in the morn have bid sweet friends farewell,  And pilgrim newly on his road with love  Thrills, if he hear the vesper bell from far,  That seems to mourn for the expiring day:  When I, no longer taking heed to hear  Began, with wonder, from those spirits to mark  One risen from its seat, which with its hand  Audience implor'd. Both palms it join'd and rais'd,  Fixing its steadfast gaze towards the east,  As telling God, \"I care for naught beside.\"    \"Te Lucis Ante,\" so devoutly then  Came from its lip, and in so soft a strain,  That all my sense in ravishment was lost.  And the rest after, softly and devout,  Follow'd through all the hymn, with upward gaze  Directed to the bright supernal wheels.    Here, reader! for the truth makes thine eyes keen:  For of so subtle texture is this veil,  That thou with ease mayst pass it through unmark'd.    I saw that gentle band silently next  Look up, as if in expectation held,  Pale and in lowly guise; and from on high  I saw forth issuing descend beneath  Two angels with two flame-illumin'd swords,  Broken and mutilated at their points.  Green as the tender leaves but newly born,  Their vesture was, the which by wings as green  Beaten, they drew behind them, fann'd in air.  A little over us one took his stand,  The other lighted on the' Opposing hill,  So that the troop were in the midst contain'd.    Well I descried the whiteness on their heads;  But in their visages the dazzled eye  Was lost, as faculty that by too much  Is overpower'd.  \"From Mary's bosom both  Are come,\" exclaim'd Sordello, \"as a guard  Over the vale, ganst him, who hither tends,  The serpent.\"  Whence, not knowing by which path  He came, I turn'd me round, and closely press'd,  All frozen, to my leader's trusted side.    Sordello paus'd not: \"To the valley now  (For it is time) let us descend; and hold  Converse with those great shadows: haply much  Their sight may please ye.\"  Only three steps down  Methinks I measur'd, ere I was beneath,  And noted one who look'd as with desire  To know me.  Time was now that air arrow dim;  Yet not so dim, that 'twixt his eyes and mine  It clear'd not up what was conceal'd before.  Mutually tow'rds each other we advanc'd.  Nino, thou courteous judge! what joy I felt,  When I perceiv'd thou wert not with the bad!    No salutation kind on either part  Was left unsaid.  He then inquir'd: \"How long  Since thou arrived'st at the mountain's foot,  Over the distant waves?\"--\"O!\" answer'd I,  \"Through the sad seats of woe this morn I came,  And still in my first life, thus journeying on,  The other strive to gain.\"  Soon as they heard  My words, he and Sordello backward drew,  As suddenly amaz'd.  To Virgil one,  The other to a spirit turn'd, who near  Was seated, crying: \"Conrad! up with speed:  Come, see what of his grace high God hath will'd.\"  Then turning round to me: \"By that rare mark  Of honour which thou ow'st to him, who hides  So deeply his first cause, it hath no ford,  When thou shalt be beyond the vast of waves.  Tell my Giovanna, that for me she call  There, where reply to innocence is made.  Her mother, I believe, loves me no more;  Since she has chang'd the white and wimpled folds,  Which she is doom'd once more with grief to wish.  By her it easily may be perceiv'd,  How long in women lasts the flame of love,  If sight and touch do not relume it oft.  For her so fair a burial will not make  The viper which calls Milan to the field,  As had been made by shrill Gallura's bird.\"    He spoke, and in his visage took the stamp  Of that right seal, which with due temperature  Glows in the bosom.  My insatiate eyes  Meanwhile to heav'n had travel'd, even there  Where the bright stars are slowest, as a wheel  Nearest the axle; when my guide inquir'd:  \"What there aloft, my son, has caught thy gaze?\"    I answer'd: \"The three torches, with which here  The pole is all on fire.\"  He then to me:  \"The four resplendent stars, thou saw'st this morn  Are there beneath, and these ris'n in their stead.\"    While yet he spoke.  Sordello to himself  Drew him, and cry'd: \"Lo there our enemy!\"  And with his hand pointed that way to look.    Along the side, where barrier none arose  Around the little vale, a serpent lay,  Such haply as gave Eve the bitter food.  Between the grass and flowers, the evil snake  Came on, reverting oft his lifted head;  And, as a beast that smoothes its polish'd coat,  Licking his hack.  I saw not, nor can tell,  How those celestial falcons from their seat  Mov'd, but in motion each one well descried,  Hearing the air cut by their verdant plumes.  The serpent fled; and to their stations back  The angels up return'd with equal flight.    The Spirit (who to Nino, when he call'd,  Had come), from viewing me with fixed ken,  Through all that conflict, loosen'd not his sight.    \"So may the lamp, which leads thee up on high,  Find, in thy destin'd lot, of wax so much,  As may suffice thee to the enamel's height.\"  It thus began: \"If any certain news  Of Valdimagra and the neighbour part  Thou know'st, tell me, who once was mighty there  They call'd me Conrad Malaspina, not  That old one, but from him I sprang.  The love  I bore my people is now here refin'd.\"    \"In your dominions,\" I answer'd, \"ne'er was I.  But through all Europe where do those men dwell,  To whom their glory is not manifest?  The fame, that honours your illustrious house,  Proclaims the nobles and proclaims the land;  So that he knows it who was never there.  I swear to you, so may my upward route  Prosper! your honour'd nation not impairs  The value of her coffer and her sword.  Nature and use give her such privilege,  That while the world is twisted from his course  By a bad head, she only walks aright,  And has the evil way in scorn.\"  He then:  \"Now pass thee on: sev'n times the tired sun  Revisits not the couch, which with four feet  The forked Aries covers, ere that kind  Opinion shall be nail'd into thy brain  With stronger nails than other's speech can drive,  If the sure course of judgment be not stay'd.\"          CANTO IX    Now the fair consort of Tithonus old,  Arisen from her mate's beloved arms,  Look'd palely o'er the eastern cliff: her brow,  Lucent with jewels, glitter'd, set in sign  Of that chill animal, who with his train  Smites fearful nations: and where then we were,  Two steps of her ascent the night had past,  And now the third was closing up its wing,  When I, who had so much of Adam with me,  Sank down upon the grass, o'ercome with sleep,  There where all five were seated.  In that hour,  When near the dawn the swallow her sad lay,  Rememb'ring haply ancient grief, renews,  And with our minds more wand'rers from the flesh,  And less by thought restrain'd are, as 't were, full  Of holy divination in their dreams,  Then in a vision did I seem to view  A golden-feather'd eagle in the sky,  With open wings, and hov'ring for descent,  And I was in that place, methought, from whence  Young Ganymede, from his associates 'reft,  Was snatch'd "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8800"],[0,"An Index of The Divine Comedy (#5)"],[1,"chose, eludes my search.    \"Brother! no eye of man not perfected,  Nor fully ripen'd in the flame of love,  May fathom this decree.  It is a mark,  In sooth, much aim'd at, and but little kenn'd:  And I will therefore show thee why such way  Was worthiest.  The celestial love, that spume  All envying in its bounty, in itself  With such effulgence blazeth, as sends forth  All beauteous things eternal.  What distils  Immediate thence, no end of being knows,  Bearing its seal immutably impress'd.  Whatever thence immediate falls, is free,  Free wholly, uncontrollable by power  Of each thing new: by such conformity  More grateful to its author, whose bright beams,  Though all partake their shining, yet in those  Are liveliest, which resemble him the most.  These tokens of pre-eminence on man  Largely bestow'd, if any of them fail,  He needs must forfeit his nobility,  No longer stainless.  Sin alone is that,  Which doth disfranchise him, and make unlike  To the chief good; for that its light in him  Is darken'd.  And to dignity thus lost  Is no return; unless, where guilt makes void,  He for ill pleasure pay with equal pain.  Your nature, which entirely in its seed  Trangress'd, from these distinctions fell, no less  Than from its state in Paradise; nor means  Found of recovery (search all methods out  As strickly as thou may) save one of these,  The only fords were left through which to wade,  Either that God had of his courtesy  Releas'd him merely, or else man himself  For his own folly by himself aton'd.    \"Fix now thine eye, intently as thou canst,  On th' everlasting counsel, and explore,  Instructed by my words, the dread abyss.    \"Man in himself had ever lack'd the means  Of satisfaction, for he could not stoop  Obeying, in humility so low,  As high he, disobeying, thought to soar:  And for this reason he had vainly tried  Out of his own sufficiency to pay  The rigid satisfaction.  Then behooved  That God should by his own ways lead him back  Unto the life, from whence he fell, restor'd:  By both his ways, I mean, or one alone.  But since the deed is ever priz'd the more,  The more the doer's good intent appears,  Goodness celestial, whose broad signature  Is on the universe, of all its ways  To raise ye up, was fain to leave out none,  Nor aught so vast or so magnificent,  Either for him who gave or who receiv'd  Between the last night and the primal day,  Was or can be.  For God more bounty show'd.  Giving himself to make man capable  Of his return to life, than had the terms  Been mere and unconditional release.  And for his justice, every method else  Were all too scant, had not the Son of God  Humbled himself to put on mortal flesh.    \"Now, to fulfil each wish of thine, remains  I somewhat further to thy view unfold.  That thou mayst see as clearly as myself.    \"I see, thou sayst, the air, the fire I see,  The earth and water, and all things of them  Compounded, to corruption turn, and soon  Dissolve.  Yet these were also things create,  Because, if what were told me, had been true  They from corruption had been therefore free.    \"The angels, O my brother! and this clime  Wherein thou art, impassible and pure,  I call created, as indeed they are  In their whole being.  But the elements,  Which thou hast nam'd, and what of them is made,  Are by created virtue' inform'd: create  Their substance, and create the' informing virtue  In these bright stars, that round them circling move  The soul of every brute and of each plant,  The ray and motion of the sacred lights,  With complex potency attract and turn.  But this our life the' eternal good inspires  Immediate, and enamours of itself;  So that our wishes rest for ever here.    \"And hence thou mayst by inference conclude  Our resurrection certain, if thy mind  Consider how the human flesh was fram'd,  When both our parents at the first were made.\"          CANTO VIII    The world was in its day of peril dark  Wont to believe the dotage of fond love  From the fair Cyprian deity, who rolls  In her third epicycle, shed on men  By stream of potent radiance: therefore they  Of elder time, in their old error blind,  Not her alone with sacrifice ador'd  And invocation, but like honours paid  To Cupid and Dione, deem'd of them  Her mother, and her son, him whom they feign'd  To sit in Dido's bosom: and from her,  Whom I have sung preluding, borrow'd they  The appellation of that star, which views,  Now obvious and now averse, the sun.    I was not ware that I was wafted up  Into  its orb; but the new loveliness  That grac'd my lady, gave me ample proof  That we had entered there.  And as in flame  A sparkle is distinct, or voice in voice  Discern'd, when one its even tenour keeps,  The other comes and goes; so in that light  I other luminaries saw, that cours'd  In circling motion, rapid more or less,  As their eternal phases each impels.    Never was blast from vapour charged with cold,  Whether invisible to eye or no,  Descended with such speed, it had not seem'd  To linger in dull tardiness, compar'd  To those celestial lights, that tow'rds us came,  Leaving the circuit of their joyous ring,  Conducted by the lofty seraphim.  And after them, who in the van appear'd,  Such an hosanna sounded, as hath left  Desire, ne'er since extinct in me, to hear  Renew'd the strain.  Then parting from the rest  One near us drew, and sole began: \"We all  Are ready at thy pleasure, well dispos'd  To do thee gentle service.  We are they,  To whom thou in the world erewhile didst Sing  'O ye! whose intellectual ministry  Moves the third heaven!' and in one orb we roll,  One motion, one impulse, with those who rule  Princedoms in heaven; yet are of love so full,  That to please thee 't will be as sweet to rest.\"    After mine eyes had with meek reverence  Sought the celestial guide, and were by her  Assur'd, they turn'd again unto the light  Who had so largely promis'd, and with voice  That bare the lively pressure of my zeal,  \"Tell who ye are,\" I cried.  Forthwith it grew  In size and splendour, through augmented joy;  And thus it answer'd: \"A short date below  The world possess'd me.  Had the time been more,  Much evil, that will come, had never chanc'd.  My gladness hides thee from me, which doth shine  Around, and shroud me, as an animal  In its own silk unswath'd.  Thou lov'dst me well,  And had'st good cause; for had my sojourning  Been longer on the earth, the love I bare thee  Had put forth more than blossoms.  The left bank,  That Rhone, when he hath mix'd with Sorga, laves.    \"In me its lord expected, and that horn  Of fair Ausonia, with its boroughs old,  Bari, and Croton, and Gaeta pil'd,  From where the Trento disembogues his waves,  With Verde mingled, to the salt sea-flood.  Already on my temples beam'd the crown,  Which gave me sov'reignty over the land  By Danube wash'd, whenas he strays beyond  The limits of his German shores.  The realm,  Where, on the gulf by stormy Eurus lash'd,  Betwixt Pelorus and Pachynian heights,  The beautiful Trinacria lies in gloom  (Not through Typhaeus, but the vap'ry cloud  Bituminous upsteam'd), THAT too did look  To have its scepter wielded by a race  Of monarchs, sprung through me from Charles and Rodolph;  had not ill lording which doth spirit up  The people ever, in Palermo rais'd  The shout of 'death,' re-echo'd loud and long.  Had but my brother's foresight kenn'd as much,  He had been warier that the greedy want  Of Catalonia might not work his bale.  And truly need there is, that he forecast,  Or other for him, lest more freight be laid  On his already over-laden bark.  Nature in him, from bounty fall'n to thrift,  Would ask the  guard of braver arms, than such  As only care to have their coffers fill'd.\"    \"My liege, it doth enhance the joy thy words  Infuse into me, mighty as it is,  To think my gladness manifest to thee,  As to myself, who own it, when thou lookst  Into the source and limit of all good,  There, where thou markest that which thou dost speak,  Thence priz'd of me the more.  Glad thou hast made me.  Now make intelligent, clearing the doubt  Thy speech hath raised in me; for much I muse,  How bitter can spring up, when sweet is sown.\"    I thus inquiring; he forthwith replied:  \"If I have power to show one truth, soon that  Shall face thee, which thy questioning declares  Behind thee now conceal'd.  The Good, that guides  And blessed makes this realm, which thou dost mount,  Ordains its providence to be the virtue  In these great bodies: nor th' all perfect Mind  Upholds their nature merely, but in them  Their energy to save: for nought, that lies  Within the range of that unerring bow,  But is as level with the destin'd aim,  As ever mark to arrow's point oppos'd.  Were it not thus, these heavens, thou dost visit,  Would their effect so work, it would not be  Art, but destruction; and this may not chance,  If th' intellectual powers, that move these stars,  Fail not, or who, first faulty made them fail.  Wilt thou this truth more clearly evidenc'd?\"    To whom I thus: \"It is enough: no fear,  I see, lest nature in her part should tire.\"    He straight rejoin'd: \"Say, were it worse for man,  If he liv'd not in fellowship on earth?\"    \"Yea,\" answer'd I; \"nor here a reason needs.\"    \"And may that be, if different estates  Grow not of different duties in your life?  Consult your teacher, and he tells you 'no.\"'    Thus did he come, deducing to this point,  And then concluded: \"For this cause behooves,  The roots, from whence your operations come,  Must differ.  Therefore one is Solon born;  Another, Xerxes; and Melchisidec  A third; and he a fourth, whose airy voyage  Cost him his son.  In her circuitous course,  Nature, that is the seal to mortal wax,  Doth well her art, but no distinctions owns  'Twixt one or other household.  Hence befalls  That Esau is so wide of Jacob: hence  Quirinus of so base a father springs,  He dates from Mars his lineage.  Were it not  That providence celestial"]]]
