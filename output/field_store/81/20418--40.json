I notice  one who, as his boat nears the shore, changes into a freshly folded and  crinkled muslin _dhoti_, dons over his cotton tunic a China silk  coat, carefully adjusts round his neck a neatly twisted scarf, and walks  off towards the village, umbrella held aloft.    Rustling waves pass over the rice-fields. Mango and cocoanut tree-tops  rise into the sky, and beyond them there are fluffy clouds on the horizon.  The fringes of the palm leaves wave in the breeze. The reeds on the  sand-bank are on the point of flowering. It is altogether an exhilarating  scene.    The feelings of the man who has just arrived home, the eager expectancy of  his folk awaiting him, this autumn sky, this world, the gentle morning  breeze, the universal responsive tremor in tree and shrub and in the  wavelets on the river, conspire to overwhelm this lonely youth, gazing  from his window, with unutterable joys and sorrows.    Glimpses of the world received from wayside windows bring new desires, or  rather, make old desires take on new forms. The day before yesterday, as I  was sitting at the window of the boat, a little fisher-dinghy floated  past, the boatman singing a song--not a very tuneful song. But it reminded  me of a night, years ago, when I was a child. We were going along the  Padma in a boat. I awoke one night at about 2 o'clock, and, on raising the  window and putting out my head, I saw the waters without a ripple,  gleaming in the moonlight, and a youth in a little dinghy paddling along  all by himself and singing, oh so sweetly,--such sweet melody I had never  heard before.    A sudden longing came upon me to go back to the day of that song; to be  allowed to make another essay at life, this time not to leave it thus  empty and unsatisfied; but with a poet's song on my lips to float about  the world on the crest of the rising tide, to sing it to men and subdue  their hearts; to see for myself what the world holds and where; to let men  know me, to get to know them; to burst forth through the world in life and  youth like the eager rushing breezes; and then return home to a fulfilled  and fruitful old age to spend it as a poet should.    Not a very lofty ideal, is it? To benefit the world would have been much  higher, no doubt; but being on the whole what I am, that ambition does not  even occur to me. I cannot make up my mind to sacrifice this precious gift  of life in a self-wrought famine, and disappoint the world and the hearts  of men by fasts and meditations and constant argument. I count it enough  to live and die as a man, loving and trusting the world, unable to look on  it either as a delusion of the Creator or a snare of the Devil. It is not  for me to strive to be wafted away into the airiness of an Angel.          SHELIDAH,    2_nd Kartik_ (_October_) 1891.      When I come to the country I cease to view man as separate from the rest.  As the river runs through many a clime, so does the stream of men babble  on, winding through woods and villages and towns. It is not a true  contrast that _men may come and men may go, but I go on for ever_.  Humanity, with all its confluent streams, big and small, flows on and on,  just as does the river, from its source in birth to its sea of death;--two  dark mysteries at either end, and between them various play and work and  chatter unceasing.    Over there the cultivators sing in the fields: here the fishing-boats  float by. The day wears on and the heat of the sun increases. Some bathers  are still in the river, others are finished and are taking home their  filled water-vessels. Thus, past both banks of the river, hundreds of  years have hummed their way, while the refrain rises in a mournful chorus:  _I go on for ever!_    Amid the noonday silence some youthful cowherd is heard calling at the top  of his voice for his companion; some boat splashes its way homewards; the  ripples lap against the empty jar which some village woman rests on the  water before dipping it; and with these mingle several other less definite  sounds,--the twittering of birds, the humming of bees, the plaintive  creaking of the house-boat as it gently swings to and fro,--the whole  making a tender lullaby, as of a mother trying to quiet a suffering child.  \"Fret not,\" she sings, as she soothingly pats its fevered forehead. \"Worry  not; weep no more. Let be your strugglings and grabbings and fightings;  forget a while, sleep a while.\"          SHELIDAH,    3_rd Kartik_ (_October_) 1891.      It was the _Kojagar_ full moon, and I was slowly pacing the riverside  conversing with myself. It could hardly be called a conversation, as I was  doing all the talking and my imaginary companion all the listening. The  poor fellow had no chance of speaking up for himself, for was not mine the  power to compel him helplessly to answer like a fool?    But what a night it was! How often have I tried to write of such, but  never got it done! There was not a line of ripple on the river; and from  away over there, where the farthest shore of the distant main stream is  seen beyond the other edge of the midway belt of sand, right up to this  shore, glimmers a broad band of moonlight. Not a human being, not a boat  in sight; not a tree, nor blade of grass on the fresh-formed island  sand-bank.    It seemed as though a desolate moon was rising upon a devastated earth; a  random river wandering through a lifeless solitude; a long-drawn  fairy-tale coming to a close over a deserted world,--all the kings and the  princesses, their ministers and friends and their golden castles vanished,  leaving the Seven Seas and Thirteen Rivers and the Unending Moor, over  which the adventurous princes fared forth, wanly gleaming in the pale  moonlight. I was pacing up and down like the last pulse-beats of this  dying world. Every one else seemed to be on the opposite shore--the shore  of life--where the British Government and the Nineteenth Century hold  sway, and tea and cigarettes.          SHELIDAH,    9_th January_ 1892.      For some days the weather here has been wavering between Winter and  Spring. In the morning, perhaps, shivers will run over both land and water  at the touch of the north wind; while the evening will thrill with the  south breeze coming through the moonlight.    There is no doubt that Spring is well on its way. After a long interval  the _papiya_ once more calls out from the groves on the opposite  bank. The hearts of men too are stirred; and after evening falls, sounds  of singing are heard in the village, showing that they are no longer in  such a hurry to close doors and windows and cover themselves up snugly for  the night.    To-night the moon is at its full, and its large, round face peers at me  through the open window on my left, as if trying to make out whether I  have anything to say against it in my letter,--it suspects, maybe, that we  mortals concern ourselves more with its stains than its beams.    A bird is plaintively crying tee-tee on the sand-bank. The river seems not  to move. There are no boats. The motionless groves on the bank cast an  unquivering shadow on the waters. The haze over the sky makes the moon  look like a sleepy eye kept open.    Henceforward the evenings will grow darker and darker; and when,  to-morrow, I come over from the office, this moon, the favourite companion  of my exile, will already have drifted a little farther from me, doubting  whether she had been wise to lay her heart so completely bare last  evening, and so covering it up again little by little.    Nature becomes really and truly intimate in strange and lonely places. I  have been actually worrying myself for days at the thought that after the  moon is past her full I shall daily miss the moonlight more and more;  feeling further and further exiled when the beauty and peace which awaits  my return to the riverside will no longer be there, and I shall have to  come back through darkness.    Anyhow I put it on record that to-day is the full moon--the first full  moon of this year's springtime. In years to come I may perchance be  reminded of this night, with the tee-tee of the bird on the bank, the  glimmer of the distant light on the boat off the other shore, the shining  expanse of river, the blur of shade thrown by the dark fringe of trees  along its edge, and the white sky gleaming overhead in unconcerned  aloofness.          SHELIDAH,    7_th April_ 1892.      The river is getting low, and the water in this arm of it is hardly more  than waist-deep anywhere. So it is not at all extraordinary that the boat  should be anchored in mid-stream. On the bank, to my right, the ryots are  ploughing and cows are now and then brought down to the water's edge for a  drink. To the left there are the mango and cocoanut trees of the old  Shelidah garden above, and on the bathing slope below there are village  women washing clothes, filling water jars, bathing, laughing and gossiping  in their provincial dialect.    The younger girls never seem to get through their sporting in the water;  it is a delight to hear their careless, merry laughter. The men gravely  take their regulation number of dips and go away, but girls are on much  more intimate terms with the water. Both alike babble and chatter and  ripple and sparkle in the same simple and natural manner; both may  languish and fade away under a scorching glare, yet both can take a blow  without hopelessly breaking under it. The hard world, which, but for them,  would be barren, cannot fathom the mystery of the soft embrace of their  arms.    Tennyson has it that woman to man is as water to wine. I feel to-day it  should be as water is to land. Woman is more at home with the water,  laving in it, playing with it, holding her gatherings beside it; and  while, for her, other burdens are not seemly, the carrying of water from  the spring, the well, the bank of river or pool,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7959"],[0,"The Reign of Tiberius, Out of the First Six Annals of Tacitus; (#5)"],[1," many, indeed, after escaping from  battle, have ended their infamy with the halter. And to more shameful  crimes, they awarded a sterner punishment:      _Behind flock'd wrangling up a piteous crew    Greeted of none, disfeatured and forlorn:    Cowards, who were in sloughs interr'd alive;    And round them still the wattled hurdles hung    Wherewith they stamp'd them down, and trod them deep,    To hide their shameful memory from men._    Having now surveyed the compositions in this volume, it is proper that  we should at length devote some of our notice to Gordon himself, and to  his manner of presenting Tacitus. Thomas Gordon was born in Scotland;  the date has not yet been ascertained. He is thought to have been  educated at a northern university, and to have become an Advocate.  Later, he went to London; and taught languages. Two pamphlets on  the Bangorian controversy brought him into notice; and he wrote  many religious and political dissertations. \"A Defence of Primitive  Christianity, against the Exhorbitant Claims of Fanatical and  Dissaffected Clergymen;\" \"Tracts on Religion, and on the Jacobite  Rebellion of '45;\" \"The Pillars of Priestcraft and Orthodoxy Shaken;\" \"A  Cordial for Low Spirits;\" are the titles of some of his compositions.  In politics, and in theology, he was a republican and free-thinker: he  translated and edited \"The Spirit of Ecclesiastics in All Ages;\" he  was a contributor to \"The Independent Whig;\" and in a series of \"Cato's  Letters,\" he discoursed at ease upon his usual topics. The Tacitus was  published in 1728, in two volumes folio: long dissertations are inserted  in either volume; the literature in them excellent, the politics not so  good: the volumes, as well as the several parts of them, are dedicated  to some Royal and many Noble Patrons. Gordon has also turned Sallust  into English: the book was published in 1744, in one handsome quarto;  \"with Political Discourses upon that Author and Translations of  Cicero's Four Orations against Cataline.\" Walpole made Gordon the first  commissioner of wine licences. It is handed down, that Gordon was a  burly person, \"large and corpulent.\" It is believed, that he found his  way into \"The Dunciad,\" and that he is immortalised there among the  \"Canaille Ecrivante;\" the line      _Where Tindal dictates and Silenus snores_,    is taken to be Pope's description of him. Gordon died in 1750; at the  same time as Dr. Middleton, the elegant biographer of Cicero: Lord  Bolingbroke is said to have observed, when the news was told him, \"Then  is the best writer in England gone, and the worst.\" That Bolingbroke  should have disliked Gordon and his politics, does not surprise me; but  I cannot understand for what reason he, and other good judges, despised  his writings. \"The chief glory of every people arises from its authors,\"  Dr. Johnson says; and happy the people, I would assert, who have no  worse writers than Thomas Gordon. I wish to draw attention to Gordon's  correct vocabulary, to his bold and pregnant language, and to his  scholarly punctuation. Among our present writers, the art of punctuation  is a lost accomplishment; and it is usual now to find writings with  hardly anything but full stops; colons and semicolons are almost  obsolete; commas are neglected, or misused; and our slovenly pages are  strewn with dashes, the last resources of an untidy thinker, the certain  witnesses to a careless and unfinished sentence. How different, and  how superior, is the way of Gordon; who, though he can be homely and  familiar, never lays aside the well-bred and courteous manners of a  polished Age. In his writings, the leading clauses of a sentence are  distinguished by their colons: the minor clauses, by their semicolons;  the nice meaning of the details is expressed, the pleasure and the  convenience of his readers are alike increased, by his right and elegant  use of commas. The comma, with us, is used as a loop or bracket, and  for little else: by the more accurate scholars of the last Age, it  was employed to indicate a finer meaning; to mark an emphasis, or an  elision; to introduce a relative clause; to bring out the value of an  happy phrase, or the nice precision of an epithet. And thus the authors  of the great century of prose, that orderly and spacious time, assembled  their words, arranged their sentences, and marshalled them into careful  periods: without any loss to the subtile meaning of their thought,  or any sacrifice of vigour, they exposed their subject in a dignified  procession of stately paragraphs; and when the end is reached we look  back upon a perfect specimen of the writer's art. We have grown careless  about form, we have little sense for balance and proportion, and we  have sacrificed the good manners of literature to an ill-bred liking  for haste and noise: it has been decided, that the old way of writing  is cumbersome and slow; as well might some guerilla chieftain have  announced to his fellow-barbarians, that Caesar's legions were not swift  and beautiful in their manoeuvres, nor irresistible in their advance. I  have spoken of our long sentences, with nothing but full stops: they  are variegated, here and there, with shorter sentences, sometimes of two  words; this way of writing is common in Macaulay or in the histories of  Mr. Green, and I have seen it recommended in Primers of Literature and  Manuals of Composition. With the jolting and unconnected fragments of  these authorities, I would contrast the musical and flowing periods of  Dr. Johnson's \"Lives of the Poets\": to study these works in solitude,  will probably be sufficient to justify my preference; but to hear them  read aloud, should convert the most unwilling listener into an advocate  of my opinion.    Dr. Birkbeck Hill, in the delightful Preface to his Boswell, explains  how he was turned by a happy chance to the study of the literature of  the eighteenth century; and how he read on and on in the enchanting  pages of \"The Spectator.\" \"From Addison in the course of time I passed  on,\" he continues, \"to the other great writers of his and the succeeding  age, finding in their exquisitely clear style, their admirable  common-sense, and their freedom from all the tricks of affectation, a  delightful contrast to so many of the eminent authors of our own time.\"  These words might be used of Gordon: I do not claim for him the style of  Addison, nor the accomplished negligence of Goldsmith; these are graces  beyond the reach of art; but he exhibits the common-sense, and the clear  style, of the eighteenth century. Like all the good writers of his time,  he is unaffected and \"simplex munditiis\"; he has the better qualities  of Pyrrha, and is \"plain in his neatness.\" In Mr. Ward's edition of the  English Poets, there may be read side by side a notice of Collins and of  Gray; the one by Mr. Swinburne, the other by Mr. Matthew Arnold: I  make no allusion here to the greatness of either poet, to the merits of  either style, nor to the value of either criticism. But the essay upon  Gray is quiet in tone; it has an unity of treatment, and never deserts  the principal subject; it is suffused with light, and full of the  most delicate allusions: the essay on Collins, by being written in  superlatives and vague similes, deafens and perplexes the reader; and  the author, by squandering his resources, has no power to make fine  distinctions, nor to exalt one part of his thesis above another. These  two performances illustrate the last quality in Gordon, and in the old  writers, to which I shall draw attention: they were always restrained  in their utterances, and therefore they could be discriminating in  their judgments; they could be emphatic without noise, and deep without  obscurity, ornamental but not vulgar, carefully arranged but not stiff  or artificial. They exhibit the three indispensable gifts of the  finest authorship: \"simplicitas munditiis,\" \"lucidus ordo,\" \"curiosa  felicitas.\"    In this volume, Gordon's punctuation has been generally followed: his  orthography has been modernised a little, though not by my hands,  nor with my consent; and I have observed without regret, that some of  Gordon's original spellings have eluded the vigilance of the printer:  that stern official would by no means listen to my entreaties for the  long \"SS,\" the turn-over words, or the bounteous capitals, which add so  much to the seductive and sober dignity of an eighteenth-century page;  but, on the whole, we have given a tolerable reproduction of Gordon's  folio. In the second edition, he himself made more changes than  improvements. I will not say, that Gordon has always conveyed the exact  meaning of the sentences of Tacitus: but he has done what is better,  and more difficult; he has grasped the broad meaning of his author, and  caught something of his lofty spirit. \"A translation,\" he says, \"ought  to read like an original;\" and Gordon has not failed, I think, to reach  this perfection. It is not commonly attained among translators: Gordon  says, of one rendering of Tacitus, \"'Tis not the fire of Tacitus, but  his embers; quenched with English words, cold and Gothick.\" Of  the author of another version, he says \"Learning is his chief  accomplishment, and thence his translation is a very poor one.\" This  judgment is true of most modern translations from the Ancients; they  may be correct versions, but are miserable English: the authors, while  studying the most perfect models of the art of writing, have produced  copies which are not literature at all. From this low company, I would  rescue Sir Charles Bowen's \"Virgil\": a delightful poem, to those who are  ignorant of Latin; an exquisite production, and an amazing triumph,  to those who converse with the original. There are many English  translations of Tacitus: the first, by Sir Henry Savile and \"one  Greenway\"; the former, says Gordon, \"has performed like a schoolmaster,  the latter like a school-boy.\" Anthony "]]]
