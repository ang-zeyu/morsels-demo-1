For this reason, everyone who makes long  journeys in the Sahara has to ride on a camel.  A horse can travel  more quickly, but he, like a man, must have water every day.  So the  camel is sometimes called the \"Ship of the Desert,\" because he, best  of all, can carry men across the waterless sand.  When traders travel  across the desert with their merchandise, they are very much afraid of  the desert robbers, who steal what they can from travellers.  So they  journey in large companies called \"caravans,\" with a paid guide to  show them the best and the quickest way from oasis to oasis, and with  many men armed with guns and spears paid to ride along by the side of  the camels carrying the merchandise, and to fight if robbers come to  steal.  These Sahara robbers are very bad people, who fight, and steal  all they can get, and always kill everyone they can.  So everyone who  crosses the Sahara has to be ready to fight for his life as well as  his property.  The desert is so vast, and has so many hills and  hiding-places, that it is easy for the robbers to get away after they  have robbed a caravan.  Then, as silence once more falls on the place  of the struggle, the cries of the jackals and hyenas and vultures are  heard, as they come from miles away drawn by the smell of blood.  Swiftly they gather to feed on the bodies of the slain, and soon the  wind blows the sand smooth and clean, where a few hours before it was  trampled and stained with blood.  Perhaps only a few whitened bones  remain to show what has happened.                            6. The North of Africa    So we have learned something about the people who live in the North of  Africa.  In Egypt, the land of the great River Nile, the people can  grow rich and prosperous.  They have time to learn, but, except the  Copts, many of whom are goldsmiths, they seem to have quite forgotten  how to make the beautiful things the old Egyptians made.  In the  desert, the Sahara, there is little water, and life is very hard.  All  day people must work to get enough for food and clothes.  It is a land  without a king and without laws, where each must fight for himself.  Yet these people, on their long journeys through the waterless waste,  have learned to be very brave and fearless and strong.  They are  patient, and endure great hardships without grumbling.  They love  music, and often sing as they ride over the silent sand.  In the  evening they gather round the fire to tell stories of what happened  long ago.  The people of North Africa are all Arabs or Egyptians or  Berbers, with olive complexions and smooth, dark hair as a rule.  Next  we shall read about the very dark-skinned races who live farther  south, in Central Africa, where the sun is much hotter.                                      IV                               -----------                        UGANDA, AN AFRICAN KINGDOM                              1. Central Africa    In the last chapter we read that the Arab merchants crossed the desert  to buy ivory and goat-skins from the people who lived farther south.  In these next two chapters we shall read about these people south of  the desert.  Their land lies in the very middle of Africa, and so is  called Central Africa.  It is a beautiful country, with many rivers  and great lakes and mountains.  Central and West Africa are also the  very hottest part of this continent.  Now when plants have a lot of  water and a lot of sun they grow very quickly, and so Central Africa,  with its hot sun and its great rivers and lakes, is a land of great  forests.  In these forests there are lions and leopards, elephants,  and deer; and ivory and skins, as well as gold, have for many years  been sold by the Central Africans to the traders from the desert.  On  the eastern side of this country there are more mountains, lakes, and  small rivers; on the western side there are great rivers, all of which  join one very large one called the Congo.  In this chapter we shall  read about some of the people who live on the eastern side on the  shores of the largest of all the lakes--the one called Victoria  Nyanza.  These people are called the Baganda, and their country is  Uganda.                                2. The Baganda    The Baganda are dark-skinned Africans.  They all belong to one tribe  and speak one language, but all around them are other Africans  belonging to different tribes and speaking different languages.  About  sixty years ago, when the grandfathers of the men who are alive now  were still young, the first Europeans went to Uganda.  Until that time  the tribes in Central Africa had spent most of their time fighting one  another, killing many and making others slaves.  Some of these slaves  were sold to the Arabs to take away to Zanzibar and across the sea, or  to take across the desert to Egypt.  Some tribes were much stronger  than others, and some of these drove everyone else out of the country  they had chosen for themselves and made a kingdom of it.  One of these  strong tribes was the Baganda.  Others liked to wander from place to  place, but the Baganda chose to settle down on the shores of the great  Lake Victoria Nyanza, and to stay there always.    When Europeans went to Uganda they found the Baganda had a king to  whom they paid great honour.  The king had many officers under him.  Some of these were the chiefs of different parts of the kingdom.  Others had special work to do--one to hear all the lawsuits and to  settle disputes, another to command the army.  Others had to work in  the king's household, to wait on his wives and children, or to beat  the big drum to call the people when the king wanted them, or to take  care that no one entered the palace unless the king wished them to do  so.  But whatever their work was, all the chiefs and officers and  people honoured and obeyed the king, and, because in this way everyone  was ready to fight or to work for the king and the rest of the nation,  the Baganda were one of the strongest and wisest of all the African  peoples.    The old dress of these people was a cloth, not sewn, but simply  twisted tight round their body under their arms, and reaching nearly  to the ground.  Sometimes it was fastened also by a belt round the  waist.  The cloth is made from the bark of certain trees soaked in  water and beaten hard for many days until it is soft and thin and  strong like woven cloth.  Their houses were round and built of reeds,  with steep roofs which nearly reached to the ground.  The smaller  villages had only a few people in them, everyone in each village  being related to the rest.  But the Baganda also had big towns, the  biggest to-day being Mengo, where the king lives.  Here there were  people gathered together for the king's work, and many others brought  food and bark-cloth to market to sell.  The houses of the king and  the great chiefs were large and beautifully decorated with plaited  reeds.    The chief food of the Baganda is plantains or bananas, which are  peeled when unripe and wrapped in smoke-dried banana leaves.  These  packets are slowly cooked with very little water in earthenware  cooking-pots.  When the food is cooked it is pressed and beaten, and  then the leaves are opened out and make a plate.  Other things, such  as beans and vegetables and fish, are cooked in the same way, wrapped  in banana leaves and then eaten with the bananas.    Some of the Baganda fish in the lake, and when they go on journeys it  is often quicker to travel by boat on the lake.  Many Africans can  only make boats out of rough tree-trunks with the inside scooped out,  but the Baganda had learnt to build long, narrow boats with high  carved wooden ends.  These canoes shot through the water very swiftly,  as twenty or thirty men paddled together in each boat.  It is well  they learnt to travel quickly, because the lake is very wide and  distances are great.  Often there are sudden, violent storms, which  would overturn a clumsy boat.  The carving on the boats and the  beautiful reed-work on the chiefs' houses were different from the work  of other African tribes.  When people begin to try to make things  beautiful as well as useful it is a sign that one day they will become  wise and great.                         3. Europeans Come to Uganda    In the old days the Baganda, like other African people, thought there  were spirits in all the rivers and lakes and trees and everywhere,  which could help or hurt men.  The chief spirit they feared and to  whom they offered sacrifice was the spirit of their lake, Victoria  Nyanza.  Their witch-doctors told the people when they thought this  spirit was pleased or angry.  These witch-doctors were often bad and  cruel, and really cared more about getting all the power they could  over the king and people than for anything else.  Sometimes they said  that people must be killed as a sacrifice to the Spirit of the Lake.    When Europeans first went to Uganda, a few went to trade, but most  went to teach the Baganda about the Christians' God.  Many boys went  to their school near Mengo and were taught.  But the witch-doctors  grew frightened and persuaded the king to drive away all the  Europeans, and to kill the Baganda who would not worship the Lake  Spirit because they were Christians.  Mutesa the king did this,  killing the Christian Baganda boys very cruelly by burning them to  death, and killing the European, Bishop Hannington, when he came.  But  in a few years there were more Christians than before, and now in  Uganda the king and nearly all the chiefs and people are Christians,  as well as many of the tribes living near them to whom the Baganda  have sent teachers.  All through the Christian African kingdom there  are schools and hospitals.  The Baganda were always strong, and now so  many are Christians they have stopped fighting the other tribes and  killing and making"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6702"],[0,"Life of Harriet Beecher Stowe (#5)"],[1,"we return where we began,      our argument depending upon the good pleasure of the      Creator.        And here it is said that a being of such infinite      wisdom and benevolence as that of which the Creator is      possessed would not have formed man with such vast      capacities and boundless desires, and would have given      him no opportunity for exercising them.        In order to establish the validity of this argument it      is necessary to prove by the light of Nature that the      Creator _is_ benevolent, which, being impracticable, is      of itself sufficient to render the argument invalid.        But the argument proceeds upon the supposition that      to destroy the soul would be unwise. Now this is      arraigning the \"All-wise\" before the tribunal of his      subjects to answer for the mistakes in his government.      Can we look into the council of the \"Unsearchable\" and      see what means are made to answer their ends? We do      not know but the destruction of the soul may, in the      government of God, be made to answer such a purpose      that its existence would be contrary to the dictates of      wisdom.        The great desire of the soul for immortality, its      secret, innate horror of annihilation, has been brought      to prove its immortality. But do we always find this      horror or this desire? Is it not much more evident      that the great majority of mankind have no such dread      at all? True that there is a strong feeling of horror      excited by the idea of perishing from the earth and      being forgotten, of losing all those honors and all      that fame awaited them. Many feel this secret horror      when they look down upon the vale of futurity and      reflect that though now the idols of the world, soon      all which will be left them will be the common portion      of mankind--oblivion! But this dread does not arise      from any idea of their destiny beyond the tomb, and      even were this true, it would afford no proof that      the mind would exist forever, merely from its strong      desires. For it might with as much correctness be      argued that the body will exist forever because we have      a great dread of dying, and upon this principle nothing      which we strongly desire would ever be withheld from      us, and no evil that we greatly dread will ever come      upon us, a principle evidently false.        Again, it has been said that the constant progression      of the powers of the mind affords another proof of its      immortality. Concerning this, Addison remarks, \"Were a      human soul ever thus at a stand in her acquirements,      were her faculties to be full blown and incapable of      further enlargement, I could imagine that she might      fall away insensibly and drop at once into a state      of annihilation. But can we believe a thinking being      that is in a perpetual progress of improvement, and      traveling on from perfection to perfection after having      just looked abroad into the works of her Creator and      made a few discoveries of his infinite wisdom and      goodness, must perish at her first setting out and in      the very beginning of her inquiries?\"        In answer to this it may be said that the soul is not      always progressing in her powers. Is it not rather a      subject of general remark that those brilliant talents      which in youth expand, in manhood become stationary,      and in old age gradually sink to decay? Till when the      ancient man descends to the tomb scarce a wreck of that      once powerful mind remains.        Who, but upon reading the history of England, does not      look with awe upon the effects produced by the talents      of her Elizabeth? Who but admires that undaunted      firmness in time of peace and that profound depth      of policy which she displayed in the cabinet? Yet      behold the tragical end of this learned, this politic      princess! Behold the triumphs of age and sickness      over her once powerful talents, and say not that the      faculties of man are always progressing in their powers.        From the activity of the mind at the hour of death has      also been deduced its immortality. But it is not true      that the mind is always active at the time of death. We      find recorded in history numberless instances of those      talents, which were once adequate to the government of      a nation, being so weakened and palsied by the touch      of sickness as scarcely to tell to beholders what they      once were. The talents of the statesman, the wisdom of      the sage, the courage and might of the warrior, are      instantly destroyed by it, and all that remains of them      is the waste of idiocy or the madness of insanity.        Some minds there are who at the time of death retain      their faculties though much impaired, and if the      argument be valid these are the only cases where      immortality is conferred. Again, it is urged that the      inequality of rewards and punishments in this world      demand another in which virtue may be rewarded and vice      punished. This argument, in the first place, takes      for its foundation that by the light of nature the      distinction between virtue and vice can be discovered.      By some this is absolutely disbelieved, and by all      considered as extremely doubtful. And, secondly, it      puts the Creator under an obligation to reward and      punish the actions of his creatures. No such obligation      exists, and therefore the argument cannot be valid. And      this supposes the Creator to be a being of justice,      which cannot by the light of nature be proved, and      as the whole argument rests upon this foundation it      certainly cannot be correct.        This argument also directly impeaches the wisdom of the      Creator, for the sense of it is this,--that, forasmuch      as he was not able to manage his government in this      world, he must have another in which to rectify the      mistakes and oversights of this, and what an idea would      this give us of our All-wise Creator?        It is also said that all nations have some conceptions      of a future state, that the ancient Greeks and Romans      believed in it, that no nation has been found but have      possessed some idea of a future state of existence.      But their belief arose more from the fact that they      wished it to be so than from any real ground of belief;      for arguments appear much more plausible when the mind      wishes to be convinced. But it is said that every      nation, however circumstanced, possess some idea of      a future state. For this we may account by the fact      that it was handed down by tradition from the time of      the flood. From all these arguments, which, however      plausible at first sight, are found to be futile, may      be argued the necessity of a revelation. Without it,      the destiny of the noblest of the works of God would      have been left in obscurity. Never till the blessed      light of the Gospel dawned on the borders of the pit,      and the heralds of the Cross proclaimed \"Peace on earth      and good will to men,\" was it that bewildered and      misled man was enabled to trace his celestial origin      and glorious destiny.        The sun of the Gospel has dispelled the darkness that      has rested on objects beyond the tomb. In the Gospel      man learned that when the dust returned to dust the      spirit fled to the God who gave it. He there found      that though man has lost the image of his divine      Creator, he is still destined, after this earthly house      of his tabernacle is dissolved, to an inheritance      incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, to      a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.    Soon after the writing of this remarkable composition, Harriet's  child-life in Litchfield came to an end, for that same year she went  to Hartford to pursue her studies in a school which had been recently  established by her sister Catherine in that city.          CHAPTER II.    SCHOOL DAYS IN HARTFORD, 1824-1832.        MISS CATHERINE BEECHER.--PROFESSOR FISHER.--THE WRECK      OF THE ALBION AND DEATH OF PROFESSOR FISHER.--\"THE      MINISTER'S WOOING.\"--MISS CATHERINE BEECHER'S SPIRITUAL      HISTORY.--MRS. STOWE'S RECOLLECTIONS OF HER SCHOOL      DAYS IN HARTFORD.--HER CONVERSION.--UNITES WITH THE      FIRST CHURCH IN HARTFORD.--HER DOUBTS AND SUBSEQUENT      RELIGIOUS DEVELOPMENT.--HER FINAL PEACE.      THE school days in Hartford began a new era in Harriet's life. It was  the formative period, and it is therefore important to say a few words  concerning her sister Catherine, under whose immediate supervision she  was to continue her education. In fact, no one can comprehend either  Mrs. Stowe or her writings without some knowledge of the life and  character of this remarkable woman, whose strong, vigorous mind and  tremendous personality indelibly stamped themselves on the sensitive,  yielding, dreamy, and poetic nature of the younger sister. Mrs. Stowe  herself has said that the two persons who most strongly influenced  her at this period of her life were her brother Edward and her sister  Catherine.    Catherine was the oldest child of Lyman Beecher and Roxanna Foote, his  wife. In a little battered journal found among her papers is a short  sketch of her life, written when she was seventy-six years of age.  In a tremulous hand she begins: \"I was born at East Hampton, L. I.,  September 5, 1800, at 5 P. M., in the large parlor opposite father's  study. Don't remember much about it myself.\" The sparkle of wit in this  brief notice of the circumstances of her birth is very characteristic.  All through her life little ripples of fun were continually playing on  the surface of that current of intense thought and feeling in which her  deep, earnest nature flowed.    When she was ten years of age her"]]]
