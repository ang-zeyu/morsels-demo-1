To Ruth's surprise the first greeting of the invalid was a most  ill-natured one. She made a very unpleasant face at the visitor, ran  out her tongue, and then said, in her shrill, discordant voice:    \"I don't like you at all--I tell you that, Miss!\"    \"I am sorry you do not like me,\" replied Ruth, gently. \"I think I  should like you if you'd let me.\"    \"Yah!\" ejaculated the very unpleasant, but much to be pitied invalid.    The mother and father ignored all this ill-nature on the part of the  lame girl and were as kind and friendly with their visitor as they had  been on the previous evening. Once during breakfast time (Mercy took  hers from a tray that was fastened to her chair before her) the child  burst out again, speaking to Ruth. There were eggs on the table and,  pointing to the golden-brown fried egg that Mrs. Curtis had just  placed upon Ruth's plate, Mercy snapped:    \"Do you know what's the worst wish I'd wish on My Enemy?\"    Ruth looked her astonishment and hesitated to reply. But Mercy did not  expect a reply, for she continued quickly:    \"I'd wish My Enemy to have to eat every morning for breakfast two soft  fried eggs with his best clothes on--that's what I'd wish!\"    And this is every word she would say to the visitor while Ruth  remained. But Mr. Curtis bade Ruth good-bye very kindly when he  hurried away to the station, and Mrs. Curtis urged her to come and see  them whenever she came to town after getting settled at the Red Mill.    It was a fresh and lovely morning, although to the weather-wise the  haze in the West foredoomed the end of the day to disaster. Ruth felt  more cheerful as she crossed the railroad tracks and struck into the  same street she had followed with the searching party the evening  before. She could not mistake Doctor Davison's house when she passed  it, and there was a fine big automobile standing before the gate where  the two green lanterns were. But there was nobody in the car, nor did  she see anybody about the doctor's house.    Beyond the doctor's abode the houses were far apart--farther and  farther apart as she trudged on. Nobody noticed or spoke to the girl  as she went on with her small bag--the bag that grew heavy, despite  its smallness, as she progressed. And so she traveled two miles, or  more, along the pleasant road. Then she heard the purring of an  automobile behind her--the first vehicle that she had seen since  leaving town.    It was the big gray car that had been standing before Doctor Davison's  house when she had passed, and Ruth would have known the girl who sat  at the steering wheel and was driving the car alone, even had Reno,  the big mastiff, not sat in great dignity on the seat beside her. For  no girl could look so much like Tom Cameron without being Tom  Cameron's sister.    And the girl, the moment she saw Ruth on the road, retarded the speed  of the machine. Reno, too, lost all semblance of dignity and would not  wait for the car to completely stop before bounding into the road and  coming to caress her hand.    \"I know who you are!\" cried the girl in the automobile. \"You are Ruth  Fielding.\"    She was a brilliant, black-eyed, vivacious girl, perhaps a year or  more older than Ruth, and really handsome, having her brother's olive  complexion with plenty of color in cheeks and lips. And that her  nature was impulsive and frank there could be no doubt, for she  immediately leaped out of the automobile, when it had stopped, and ran  to embrace Ruth.    \"Thank you! thank you!\" she cried. \"Doctor Davison has told us all  about you--and how brave you are! And see how fond Reno is of you! He  knows who found his master; don't you, Reno?\"    \"Oh, dear me,\" said Ruth, breathlessly, \"Doctor Davison has been too  kind. I did nothing at all toward finding your brother--I suppose he  is your brother, Miss?\"    \"How dare you 'Miss' me?\" demanded the other girl, hugging her again.  \"You're a dear; I knew you must be! And I was running back and  intended to stop at the Red Mill to see you. I took father to town  this morning, as he had to take an early train to the city, and we  wished to see Tom again.\"    \"He--he isn't badly hurt, then--your brother, I mean?\" said Ruth,  timidly.    \"He is going to stay at the doctor's to-day, and then he can come  home. But he will carry his arm in a sling for a while, although no  bone was broken, after all. His head is badly cut, but his hair will  hide that. Poor Tom! he is always falling down, or getting bumped, or  something. And he's just as reckless as he can be. Father says he is  not to be trusted with the car as much as I am.\"    \"How--how did he come to fall over that bank?\" asked Ruth, anxiously.    \"Why--it was dark, I suppose. That was the way of it. I don't know as  he really told me what made him do such a foolish thing. And wasn't it  lucky Reno was along with him?\" cried Tom's sister.    \"Now, I see you remained in town over night. They thought somebody had  come for yon and taken you out to the mill. Is Jabez Potter really  your uncle?\"    \"Yes. He was my mother's uncle. And I have no other relative.\"    \"Well, dear, I am more than sorry for you,\" declared the girl from the  automobile. \"And now we will climb right in and I'll take you along to  the mill.\"    But whether she was sorry for Ruth Fielding's friendlessness, or sorry  because she was related to Jabez Potter, the young traveler could not  decide.      CHAPTER VI     THE RED MILL    \"Now, my name's Helen, and you are Ruth,\" declared Miss Cameron, when  she had carefully started the car once more. \"We are going to be the  very best of friends, and we might as well begin by telling each other  all about ourselves. Tom and I are twins and he is an awful tease!  But, then, boys are. He is a good brother generally. We live in the  first yellow house on the right--up among the trees--beyond Mr.  Potter's mill--near enough so that we can run back and forth and see  each other just lots.\"    Ruth found herself warmly drawn toward this vivacious miss. Nor was  she less frank in giving information about herself, her old home, in  Darrowtown, that she still wore black for her father, and that she had  been sent by her friends to Uncle Jabez because he was supposed to be  better able to take care of and educate her. Helen listened very  earnestly to the tale, but she shook her head at the end of it.    \"I don't know,\" she said. \"I don't want to hurt your feelings, Ruthie.  But Jabez Potter isn't liked very well by people in general, although  I guess he is a good miller. He is stingy--\"    \"I must say it. He isn't given to kind actions, and I am surprised that  he should have agreed to take and educate you. Of course, he didn't  have to.\"    \"I don't suppose he did have to,\" Ruth said, slowly. \"And it wasn't as  though I couldn't have remained in Darrowtown. But Miss True Pettis--\"    \"Miss True?\" repeated Helen, curiously.    \"Short for Truthful. Her name is Rechelsea Truthful Tomlinson Pettis  and she is the dearest little old spinster lady--much nicer than her  name.\"    \"Well!\" ejaculated the amazed Helen.    \"Miss True isn't rich. Indeed, she is very poor. So are Patsy Hope's  folks--Patsy is really Patricia, but that's too long for her. And all  the other folks that knew me about Darrowtown had a hard time to get  along, and most of them had plenty of children without taking another  that wasn't any kin to them,\" concluded Ruth, who was worldly wise in  some things, and had seen the harder side of life since she had opened  her eyes upon this world.    \"But your uncle is said to be a regular miser,\" declared Helen,  earnestly. \"And he is so gruff and grim! Didn't your friends know  him?\"    \"I guess they never saw him, or heard much about him,\" said Ruth,  slowly. \"I'm sure I never did myself.\"    \"But don't you be afraid,\" said the other, warmly. \"If he isn't good  to you there are friends enough here to look out for you. I know  Doctor Davison thinks you are very brave, and Daddy will do anything  for you that Tom and I ask him to.\"    \"I am quite sure I shall get on nicely with Uncle Jabez,\" she said.  \"And then, there is Aunt Alvirah.\"    \"Oh, yes. There is an old lady who keeps house for Mr. Potter. And she  seems kind enough, too. But she acts afraid of Mr. Potter. I don't  blame her, he is so grim.\"    The automobile, wheeling so smoothly over the hard pike, just then was  mounting a little hill. They came over the summit of this and there,  lying before them, was the beautiful slope of farming country down to  the very bank of the Lumano River. Fenced fields, tilled and untilled,  checkered the slope, with here and there a white farmhouse with its  group of outbuildings. There was no hamlet in sight, merely scattered  farms. The river, swollen and yellow with the Spring rains, swept upon  its bosom fence rails, hen-coops, and other flotsam of a Spring flood.  Yonder, at a crossing, part of the bridge had been carried away.    \"If the dam at Minturn goes, we shall be flooded all through this low  land again,\" Helen Cameron explained. \"I remember seeing this valley  covered with water once during the Spring. But we live on the shoulder  of Mount Burgoyne, and you see, even the mill sets on quite high  ground.\"    Ruth's eyes had already seen and lingered upon the mill. It was a  rambling structure, the great, splashing millwheel at the far end, the  long warehouse in the middle, and the dwelling attached to the other  end. There were barns, corn-cribs and other outbuildings as well, and  some little tillable land connected with the mill; and all the  buildings were vividly painted with red mineral paint, trimmed with  white. So bright and sparkling was the paint that it seemed to have  been put on over night.    \"Mr. Potter is considered a good miller,\" said Helen, again; \"and he  does not neglect his property. He is not miserly in that way. There  isn't a picket off the fence, or a hinge "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/499"],[0,"Tom Swift in the Land of Wonders; Or, The Underground Search for the Idol of (#5)"],[1," \"I didn't know you knew him, Tom,\" said the professor.    \"Oh, yes, I have met him, once,\" and there was something in Tom's  manner, though he tried to speak indifferently, that made Ned believe  there was more behind his chum's sudden change of determination than  had yet appeared.    \"He never mentioned you,\" went on Professor Bumper; \"yet the last time  I saw him I said I was coming to see you, though I did not tell him  why.\"    \"No, he wouldn't be likely to speak of me,\" said Tom significantly.    \"Well, if that's all settled, I guess I'll go back home and pack up,\"  said Mr. Damon, making a move to depart.    \"There's no special rush,\" Tom said.  \"We won't leave for a week.  I  can't get ready in much less time than that.\"    \"Bless my socks! I know that,\" ejaculated Mr. Damon.  \"But if I get my  things packed I can go to a hotel to stay while my wife is away.  She  might take a notion to come home unexpectedly, and, though she is a  dear, good soul, she doesn't altogether approve of my going off on  these wild trips with you, Tom Swift.  But if I get all packed, and  clear out, she can't find me and she can't hold me back.  She is  visiting her mother now.  I can send her a wire from Kurzon after I get  there.\"    \"I don't believe the telegraph there is working,\" laughed Professor  Bumper.  \"But suit yourself.  I must go back to New York to arrange for  the goods we'll have to take with us.  In a week, Tom, we'll start.\"    \"You must stay to dinner,\" Tom said.  \"You can't get a train now  anyhow, and father wants to meet you again.  He's pretty well,  considering his age.  And he's much better I verily believe since I  said I'd turn over to him the task of finishing the stabilizer.  He  likes to work.\"    \"We'll stay and take the night train back,\" agreed Mr. Damon.  \"It will  be like old times, Tom,\" he went on, \"traveling off together into the  wilds.  Central America is pretty wild, isn't it?\" he asked, as if in  fear of being disappointed on that score.    \"Oh, it's wild enough to suit any one,\" answered Professor Bumper.    \"Well, now to settle a few details,\" observed Tom.  \"Ned, what is the  situation as regards the financial affairs of my father and myself?  Nothing will come to grief if we go away, will there?\"    \"I guess not, Tom.  But are you going to take your father with you?\"    \"No, of course not.\"    \"But you spoke of 'we.'\"    \"I meant you and I are going.\"    \"Me, Tom?\"    \"Sure, you! I wouldn't think of leaving you behind.  You want Ned  along, don't you, Professor?\"    \"Of course.  It will be an ideal party--we four.  We'll have to take  natives when we get to Honduras, and make up a mule pack-train for the  interior.  I had some thoughts of asking you to take an airship along,  but it might frighten the Indians, and I shall have to depend on them  for guides, as well as for porters.  So it will be an old-fashioned  expedition, in a way.\"    Mr. Swift came in at this point to meet his old friends.    \"The boy needs a little excitement,\" he said.  \"He's been puttering  over that stabilizer invention too long.  I can finish the model for  him in a very short time.\"    Professor Bumper told Mr. Swift something about the proposed trip,  while Mr. Damon went out with Tom and Ned to one of the shops to look  at a new model aeroplane the young inventor had designed.    There was a merry party around the table at dinner, though now and then  Ned noticed that Tom had an abstracted and preoccupied air.    \"Thinking about the idol of gold?\" asked Ned in a whisper to his chum,  when they were about to leave the table.    \"The idol of gold?  Oh, yes! Of course! It will be great if we can  bring that back with us.\" But the manner in which he said this made Ned  feel sure that Tom had had other thoughts, and that he had used a  little subterfuge in his answer.    Ned was right, as he proved for himself a little later, when, Mr. Damon  and the professor having gone home, the young financial secretary took  his friend to a quiet corner and asked:    \"What's the matter, Tom?\"    \"Matter?  What do you mean?\"    \"I mean what made you make up your mind so quickly to go on this  expedition when you heard Beecher was going?\"    \"Oh--er--well, you wouldn't want to see our old friend Professor Bumper  left, would you, after he had worked out the secret of the idol of  gold?  You wouldn't want some young whipper-snapper to beat him in the  race, would you, Ned?\"    \"No, of course not.\"    \"Neither would I.  That's why I changed my mind.  This Beecher isn't  going to get that idol if I can stop him!\"    \"You seem rather bitter against him.\"    \"Bitter?  Oh, not at all.  I simply don't want to see my friends  disappointed.\"    \"Then Beecher isn't a friend of yours?\"    \"Oh, I've met him, that is all,\" and Tom tried to speak indifferently.    \"Humph!\" mused Ned, \"there's more here than I dreamed of.  I'm going to  get at the bottom of it.\"    But though Ned tried to pump Tom, he was not successful.  The young  inventor admitted knowing the youthful scientist, but that was all, Tom  reiterating his determination not to let Professor Bumper be beaten in  the race for the idol of gold.    \"Let me see,\" mused Ned, as he went home that evening.  \"Tom did not  change his mind until he heard Beecher's name mentioned.  Now this  shows that Beecher had something to do with it.  The only reason Tom  doesn't want Beecher to get this idol or find the buried city is  because Professor Bumper is after it.  And yet the professor is not an  old or close friend of Tom's.  They met only when Tom went to dig his  big tunnel.  There must be some other reason.\"    Ned did some more thinking.  Then he clapped his hands together, and a  smile spread over his face.    \"I believe I have it!\" he cried.  \"The little green god as compared to  the idol of gold!  That's it.  I'm going to make a call on my way home.\"    This he did, stopping at the home of Mary Nestor, a pretty girl, who,  rumor had it, was tacitly engaged to Tom.  Mary was not at home, but  Mr. Nestor was, and for Ned's purpose this answered.    \"Well, well, glad to see you!\" exclaimed Mary's father.  \"Isn't Tom  with you?\" he asked a moment later, seeing that Ned was alone.    \"No, Tom isn't with me this evening,\" Ned answered.  \"The fact is, he's  getting ready to go off on another expedition, and I'm going with him.\"    \"You young men are always going somewhere,\" remarked Mrs. Nestor.  \"Where is it to this time?\"    \"Some place in Central America,\" Ned answered, not wishing to be too  particular.  He was wondering how he could find out what he wanted to  know, when Mary's mother unexpectedly gave him just the information he  was after.    \"Central America!\" she exclaimed.  \"Why, Father,\" and she looked at her  husband, \"that's where Professor Beecher is going, isn't it?\"    \"Yes, I believe he did mention something about that.\"    \"Professor Beecher, the man who is an authority on Aztec ruins?\" asked  Ned, taking a shot in the dark.    \"Yes,\" said Mr. Nestor.  \"And a mighty fine young man he is, too.  I  knew his father well.  He was here on a visit not long ago, young  Beecher was, and he talked most entertainingly about his discoveries.  You remember how interested Mary was, Mother?\"    \"Yes, she seemed to be,\" said Mrs. Nestor.  \"Tom Swift dropped in  during the course of the evening,\" she added to Ned, \"and Mary  introduced him to Professor Beecher.  But I can't say that Tom was much  interested in the professor's talk.\"    \"No?\" questioned Ned.    \"No, not at all.  But Tom did not stay long.  He left just as Mary and  the professor were drawing a map so the professor could indicate where  he had once made a big discovery.\"    \"I see,\" murmured Ned.  \"Well, I suppose Tom must have been thinking of  something else at the time.\"    \"Very likely,\" agreed Mr. Nestor.  \"But Tom missed a very profitable  talk.  I was very much interested myself in what the professor told us,  and so was Mary.  She invited Mr. Beecher to come again.  He takes  after his father in being very thorough in what he does.    \"Sometimes I think,\" went on Mr. Nestor, \"that Tom isn't quite steady  enough.  He's thinking of so many things, perhaps, that he can't get  his mind down to the commonplace.  I remember he once sent something  here in a box labeled 'dynamite.' Though there was no explosive in it,  it gave us a great fright.  But Tom is a boy, in spite of his years.  Professor Beecher seems much older.  We all like him very much.\"    \"That's nice,\" said Ned, as he took his departure.  He had found out  what he had come to learn.    \"I knew it!\" Ned exclaimed as he walked home.  \"I knew something was in  the wind.  The little green god of jealousy has Tom in his clutches.  That's why my inventive friend was so anxious to go on this expedition  when he learned Beecher was to go.  He wants to beat him.  I guess the  professor has plainly shown that he wouldn't like anything better than  to cut Tom out with Mary.  Whew! that's something to think about!\"          CHAPTER VI    UNPLEASANT NEWS      Ned Newton decided to keep to himself what he had heard at the Nestor  home.  Not for the world would he let Tom Swift know of the situation.    \"That is, I won't let him know that I know,\" said Ned to himself,  \"though he is probably as well aware of the situation as I am.  But it  sure is queer that this Professor Beecher should have taken such a  fancy to Mary, and that her father should regard him so well.  That is  natural, I suppose.  But I wonder how Mary herself feels about it.  That is the part Tom would be most interested in.    \"No wonder Tom wants to get ahead of this young college chap, who  probably thinks he's the whole show.  If he can find the buried city,  and get the idol of gold, it would be a big feather in his cap.    \"He'd have no end of honors heaped on him, and I suppose his hat  wouldn't come within three sizes of fitting him.  Then he'd stand in  better than ever with Mr."]]]
