Bossu signed an agreement to this effect.  But throughout the whole trouble the Spaniards never once respected  the conditions they had made and sworn to with the inhabitants,  and no sooner were the gates opened than the whole force rushed in,  and the usual work of slaughter, atrocity, and plunder commenced.  Within a few minutes four hundred citizens were murdered, and  countless outrages and cruelties perpetrated upon the inhabitants.    Captain Martin completed the discharging of his cargo two days after  Bossu made his ineffectual attempt upon the town. A messenger had  arrived that morning from Flushing, with news that as soon as the  capture of Brill had become known in that seaport, the Seigneur de  Herpt had excited the burghers to drive the small Spanish garrison  from the town.    Scarcely had they done so when a large reinforcement of the enemy  arrived before the walls, having been despatched there by Alva, to  complete the fortress that had been commenced to secure the possession  of this important port at the mouth of the Western Scheldt. Herpt  persuaded the burghers that it was too late to draw back now. They  had done enough to draw the vengeance of the Spaniards upon them;  their only hope now was to resist to the last. A half witted man  in the crowd offered, if any one would give him a pot of beer, to  ascend the ramparts and fire two pieces of artillery at the Spanish  ships.    The offer was accepted, and the man ran up to the ramparts and  discharged the guns. A sudden panic seized the Spaniards, and the  whole fleet sailed away at once in the direction of Middelburg.    The governor of the island next day arrived at Flushing and was  at once admitted. He called the citizens together to the market  place and there addressed them, beseeching them to return to their  allegiance, assuring them that if they did so the king, who was the  best natured prince in all Christendom, would forget and forgive  their offenses. The effect of the governor's oratory was sadly marred  by the interruptions of De Herpt and his adherents, who reminded  the people of the fate that had befallen other towns that had  revolted, and scoffed at such good nature as the king displayed in  the scores of executions daily taking place throughout the country.    The governor, finding his efforts unavailing, had left the town,  and as soon as he did so the messenger was sent off to Brill, saying  that the inhabitants of Flushing were willing to provide arms and  ammunition if they would send them men experienced in partisan  warfare. Two hundred of the beggars, under the command of Treslong,  accordingly started the next day for Flushing. The Good Venture  threw off her hawsers from the wharf at about the same time that  these were starting, and for some time kept company with them.    \"Did one ever see such a wild crew?\" Captain Martin said, shaking  his head. \"Never, I believe, did such a party set out upon a warlike  adventure.\"    The appearance of Treslong's followers was indeed extraordinary.  Every man was attired in the gorgeous vestments of the plundered  churches--in gold and embroidered cassocks, glittering robes, or  the sombre cowls and garments of Capuchin friars. As they sailed  along their wild sea songs rose in the air, mingled with shouts  for vengeance on the Spaniards and the Papacy.    \"One would not think that this ribald crew could fight,\" Captain  Martin went on; \"but there is no doubt they will do so. They must  not be blamed altogether; they are half maddened by the miseries  and cruelties endured by their friends and relations at the hands  of the Spaniards. I knew that when at last the people rose the  combat would be a terrible one, and that they would answer cruelty  by cruelty, blood by blood. The Prince of Orange, as all men know,  is one of the most clement and gentle of rulers. All his ordinances  enjoin gentle treatment of prisoners, and he has promised every  one over and over again complete toleration in the exercise of  religion; but though he may forgive and forget, the people will  not.    \"It is the Catholic church that has been their oppressor. In its  name tens of thousands have been murdered, and I fear that the  slaughter of those priests at Brill is but the first of a series  of bloody reprisals that will take place wherever the people get  the upper hand.\"    A fresh instance of this was shown a few hours after the Good  Venture put into Flushing. A ship arrived in port, bringing with  it Pacheco, the Duke of Alva's chief engineer, an architect of  the highest reputation. He had been despatched by the duke to take  charge of the new works that the soldiers had been sent to execute,  and ignorant of what had taken place he landed at the port. He was  at once seized by the mob. An officer, willing to save his life,  took him from their hands and conducted him to the prison; but the  populace were clamorous for his blood, and Treslong was willing  enough to satisfy them and to avenge upon Alva's favourite officer  the murder of his brother by Alva's orders. The unfortunate officer  was therefore condemned to be hung, and the sentence was carried  into effect the same day.    A few days later an officer named Zeraerts arrived at Flushing with  a commission from the Prince of Orange as Governor of the Island  of Walcheren. He was attended by a small body of French infantry,  and the force under his command speedily increased; for as soon  as it was known in England that Brill and Flushing had thrown off  the authority of the Spaniards, volunteers from England began to  arrive in considerable numbers to aid their fellow Protestants in  the struggle before them.    The Good Venture had stayed only a few hours in Flushing. In  the present condition of affairs there was no chance of obtaining  a cargo there, and Captain Martin therefore thought it better not  to waste time, but to proceed at once to England in order to learn  the intention of the merchants for whom he generally worked as to  what could be done under the changed state of circumstances that  had arisen.    Every day brought news of the extension of the rising. The Spanish  troops lay for the most part in Flanders, and effectually deterred  the citizens of the Flemish towns from revolting; but throughout  Holland, Zeeland, and Friesland the flame of revolt spread rapidly.  The news that Brill and Flushing had thrown off the Spanish yoke  fired every heart. It was the signal for which all had been so long  waiting. They knew how desperately Spain would strive to regain her  grip upon the Netherlands, how terrible would be her vengeance if  she conquered; but all felt that it was better to die sword in hand  than to be murdered piecemeal. And accordingly town after town rose,  expelled the authorities appointed by Spain and the small Spanish  garrisons, and in three months after the rising of Brill the greater  part of the maritime provinces were free. Some towns, however, still  remained faithful to Spain. Prominent among these was Amsterdam, a  great trading city, which feared the ruin that opposition to Alva  might bring upon it, more than the shame of standing aloof when  their fellow countrymen were fighting for freedom and the right to  worship God in their own way.    On the 23rd of May, Louis of Nassau, with a body of troops from  France, captured the important town of Mons by surprise, but was  at once beleaguered there by a Spanish army. In June the States of  Holland assembled at Dort and formally renounced the authority of  the Duke of Alva, and declared the Prince of Orange, the royally  appointed stadtholder, the only legal representative of the Spanish  crown in their country; and in reply to an eloquent address of  Sainte Aldegonde, the prince's representative, voted a considerable  sum of money for the payment of the army the prince was raising  in Germany. On the 19th of June a serious misfortune befell the  patriot cause. A reinforcement of Huguenot troops, on the way to  succour the garrison of Mons, were met and cut to pieces by the  Spaniards, and Count Louis, who had been led by the French King to  expect ample succour and assistance from him, was left to his fate.    On the 7th of July the Prince of Orange crossed the Rhine with  14,000 foot and 7,000 horse. He advanced but a short distance when  the troops mutinied in consequence of their pay being in arrears,  and he was detained four weeks until the cities of Holland guaranteed  their payment for three months. A few cities opened their gates  to him; but they were for the most part unimportant places, and  Mechlin was the only large town that admitted his troops. Still  he pressed on toward Mons, expecting daily to be joined by 12,000  French infantry and 3,000 cavalry under the command of Admiral  Coligny.    The prince, who seldom permitted himself to be sanguine, believed  that the goal of his hopes was reached, and that he should now be  able to drive the Spaniards from the Netherlands. But as he was  marching forward he received tidings that showed him that all his  plans were shattered, and that the prospects were darker than they  had ever before been. While the King of France had throughout been  encouraging the revolted Netherlanders, and had authorized his  minister to march with an army to their assistance, he was preparing  for a deed that would be the blackest in history, were it not  that its horrors are less appalling than those inflicted upon the  captured cities of the Netherlands by Alva. On St. Bartholomew's Eve  there was a general massacre of the Protestants in Paris, followed  by similar massacres throughout France, the number of victims being  variously estimated at from twenty-five to a hundred thousand.    Protestant Europe was filled with horror at this terrible crime.  Philip of Spain was filled with equal delight. Not only was the  danger that seemed to threaten"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6955"],[0,"The Prince and Betty (#5)"],[1,"New York from the ferry, his mood  had changed. The sun and the breeze had done their work. He looked on  life once more with a cheerful and optimistic eye.    His first act, on landing, was to proceed to the office of the  _News_ and enquire for Rupert Smith. He felt that he had urgent  need of a few minutes' conversation with him. Now that the painter had  been definitely cut that bound him to the safe and conventional, and he  had set out on his own account to lead the life adventurous, he was  conscious of an absurd diffidence. New York looked different to him. It  made him feel positively shy. A pressing need for a friendly native in  this strange land manifested itself. Smith would have ideas and advice  to bestow--he was notoriously prolific of both--and in this crisis both  were highly necessary.    Smith, however, was not at the office. He had gone out, John was  informed, earlier in the morning to cover a threatened strike somewhere  down on the East Side. John did not go in search of him. The chance of  finding him in that maze of mean streets was remote. He decided to go  uptown, select a hotel, and lunch. To the need for lunch he attributed  a certain sinking sensation of which he was becoming more and more  aware, and which bore much too close a resemblance to dismay to be  pleasant. The poet's statement that \"the man who's square, his chances  always are best; no circumstance can shoot a scare into the contents of  his vest,\" is only true within limits. The squarest men, deposited  suddenly in New York and faced with the prospect of earning his living  there, is likely to quail for a moment. New York is not like other  cities. London greets the stranger with a sleepy grunt. Paris giggles.  New York howls. A gladiator, waiting in the center of the arena while  the Colosseum officials fumbled with the bolts of the door behind which  paced the noisy tiger he was to fight, must have had some of the  emotions which John experienced during his first hour as a masterless  man in Gotham.    A surface car carried him up Broadway. At Times Square the Astor Hotel  loomed up on the left. It looked a pretty good hotel to John. He  dismounted.    Half an hour later he decided that he was acclimated. He had secured a  base of operations in the shape of a room on the seventh floor, his  check was safely deposited in the hotel bank, and he was half-way  through a lunch which had caused him already to look on New York not  only as the finest city in the world, but also, on the whole, as the  one city of all others in which a young man might make a fortune with  the maximum of speed and the minimum of effort.    After lunch, having telegraphed his address to his uncle in case of  mail, he took the latter's excellent advice and went to the polo  grounds. Returning in time to dress, he dined at the hotel, after which  he visited a near-by theater, and completed a pleasant and strenuous  day at one of those friendly restaurants where the music is continuous  and the waiters are apt to burst into song in the intervals of their  other duties.    A second attempt to find Smith next morning failed, as the first had  done. The staff of the News were out of bed and at work ridiculously  early, and when John called up the office between eleven and twelve  o'clock--nature's breakfast-hour--Smith was again down East, observing  the movements of those who were about to strike or who had already  struck.    It hardly seemed worth while starting to lay the bed plates of his  fortune till he had consulted the expert. What would Rockefeller have  done? He would, John felt certain, have gone to the ball-game.    He imitated the great financier.           *       *       *       *       *    It was while he was smoking a cigar after dinner that night, musing on  the fortunes of the day's game and, in particular, on the almost  criminal imbecility of the umpire, that he was dreamily aware that he  was being \"paged.\" A small boy in uniform was meandering through the  room, chanting his name.    \"Gent wants five minutes wit' you,\" announced the boy, intercepted.  \"Hasn't got no card. Business, he says.\"    This disposed of the idea that Rupert Smith had discovered his retreat.  John was puzzled. He could not think of another person in New York who  knew of his presence at the Astor. But it was the unknown that he was  in search of, and he decided to see the mysterious stranger.    \"Send him along,\" he said.    The boy disappeared, and presently John observed him threading his way  back among the tables, followed by a young man of extraordinary gravity  of countenance, who was looking about him with an intent gaze through a  pair of gold-rimmed spectacles.    John got up to meet him.    \"My name is Maude,\" he said. \"Won't you sit down? Have you had dinner?\"    \"Thank you, yes,\" said the spectacled young man.    \"You'll have a cigar and coffee, then?\"    \"Thank you, yes.\"    The young man remained silent until the waiter had filled his cup.    \"My name is Crump,\" he said. \"I am Mr. Benjamin Scobell's private  secretary.\"    \"Yes?\" said John. \"Snug job?\"    The other seemed to miss something in his voice.    \"You have heard of Mr. Scobell?\" he asked.    \"Not to my knowledge,\" said John.    \"Ah! you have lost touch very much with Mervo, of course.\"    John stared.    \"Mervo?\"    It sounded like some patent medicine.    \"I have been instructed,\" said Mr. Crump solemnly, \"to inform Your  Highness that the Republic has been dissolved, and that your subjects  offer you the throne of your ancestors.\"    John leaned back in his chair, and looked at the speaker in dumb  amazement. The thought flashed across him that Mr. Crump had been  perfectly correct in saying that he had dined.    His attitude appeared to astound Mr. Crump. He goggled through his  spectacles at John, who was reminded of some rare fish.    \"You are John Maude? You said you were.\"    \"I'm John Maude right enough. We're solid on that point.\"    \"And your mother was the only sister of Mr. Andrew Westley?\"    \"You're right there, too.\"    \"Then there is no mistake. I say the Republic--\" He paused, as if  struck with an idea. \"Don't you know?\" he said. \"Your father--\"    John became suddenly interested.    \"If you've got anything to tell me about my father, go right ahead.  You'll be the only man I've ever met who has said a word about him. Who  the deuce was he, anyway?\"    Mr. Crump's face cleared.    \"I understand. I had not expected this. You have been kept in  ignorance. Your father, Mr. Maude, was the late Prince Charles of  Mervo.\"    It was not easy to astonish John, but this announcement did so. He  dropped his cigar in a shower of gray ash on to his trousers, and  retrieved it almost mechanically, his wide-open eyes fixed on the  other's face.    \"What!\" he cried.    Mr. Crump nodded gravely.    \"You are Prince John of Mervo, and I am here--\" he got into his stride  as he reached the familiar phrase--\"to inform Your Highness that the  Republic has been dissolved, and that your subjects offer you the  throne of your ancestors.\"    A horrid doubt seized John.    \"You're stringing me. One of those Indians at the _News_, Rupert  Smith, or someone, has put you up to this.\"    Mr. Crump appeared wounded.    \"If Your Highness would glance at these documents-- This is a copy  of the register of the church in which your mother and father were  married.\"    John glanced at the document. It was perfectly lucid.    \"Then--then it's true!\" he said.    \"Perfectly true, Your Highness. And I am here to inform--\"    \"But where the deuce is Mervo? I never heard of the place.\"    \"It is an island principality in the Mediterranean, Your High--\"    \"For goodness' sake, old man, don't keep calling me 'Your Highness.' It  may be fun to you, but it makes me feel a perfect ass. Let me get into  the thing gradually.\"    Mr. Crump felt in his pocket.    \"Mr. Scobell,\" he said, producing a roll of bills, \"entrusted me with  money to defray any expenses--\"    More than any words, this spectacle removed any lingering doubt which  John might have had as to the possibility of this being some intricate  practical joke.    \"Are these for me?\" he said.    Mr. Crump passed them across to him.    \"There are a thousand dollars here,\" he said. \"I am also instructed to  say that you are at liberty to draw further against Mr. Scobell's  account at the Wall Street office of the European and Asiatic Bank.\"    The name Scobell had been recurring like a _leit-motif_ in Mr.  Crump's conversation. This suddenly came home to John.    \"Before we go any further,\" he said, \"let's get one thing clear. Who is  this Mr. Scobell? How does he get mixed up in this?\"    \"He is the proprietor of the Casino at Mervo.\"    \"He seems to be one of those generous, open-handed fellows. Nothing of  the tight wad about him.\"    \"He is deeply interested in Your High--in your return.\"    John laid the roll of bills beside his coffee cup, and relighted his  cigar.    \"That's mighty good of him,\" he said. \"It strikes me, old man, that I  am not absolutely up-to-date as regards the internal affairs of this  important little kingdom of mine. How would it be if you were to put me  next to one or two facts? Start at the beginning and go right on.\"    When Mr. Crump had finished a condensed history of Mervo and Mervian  politics, John smoked in silence for some minutes.    \"Life, Crump,\" he said at last, \"is certainly speeding up as far as I  am concerned. Up till now nothing in particular has ever happened to  me. A couple of days ago I lost my job, was given ten thousand dollars  that I didn't know existed, and now you tell me I'm a prince. Well,  well! These are stirring times. When do we start for the old  homestead?\"    \"Mr. Scobell was exceedingly anxious that we should return by  Saturday's boat.\"    \"Saturday? What, to-morrow?\"    \"Perhaps it is too soon. You will not be able to settle your affairs?\"    \"I guess I can settle my affairs "]]]
