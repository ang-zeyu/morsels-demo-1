O sinless one, are thy  inclinations and practices such as I have described them, and as always  enhance the duration of life and spread one's renown and as always help  the cause of religion, pleasure, and profit? He who conducteth himself  according to this way, never findeth his kingdom distressed or  afflicted; and that monarch, subjugating the whole earth, enjoyeth a  high degree of felicity. O monarch, I hope, no well-behaved,  pure-souled, and respected person is ever ruined and his life taken, on  a false charge or theft, by thy ministers ignorant of Sastras and  acting from greed? And, O bull among men, I hope thy ministers never  from covetousness set free a real thief, knowing him to be such and  having apprehended him with the booty about him? O Bharata, I hope, thy  ministers are never won over by bribes, nor do they wrongly decide the  disputes that arise between the rich and the poor. Dost thou keep  thyself free from the fourteen vices of kings, viz., atheism,  untruthfulness, anger, incautiousness, procrastination, non-visit to  the wise, idleness, restlessness of mind, taking counsels with only one  man, consultation with persons unacquainted with the science of profit,  abandonment of a settled plan, divulgence of counsels,  non-accomplishment of beneficial projects, and undertaking everything  without reflection? By these, O king, even monarchs firmly seated on  their thrones are ruined. Hath thy study of the Vedas, thy wealth and  knowledge of the Sastras and marriage been fruitful?'\"    Vaisampayana continued,--\"After the Rishi had finished, Yudhishthira  asked,--'How, O Rishi, do the Vedas, wealth, wife, and knowledge of the  Sastras bear fruit?'    \"The Rishi answered,--'The Vedas are said to bear fruit when he that  hath studied them performeth the Agnihotra and other sacrifices. Wealth  is said to bear fruit when he that hath it enjoyeth it himself and  giveth it away in charity. A wife is said to bear fruit when she is  useful and when she beareth children. Knowledge of the Sastras is said  to bear fruit when it resulteth in humility and good behaviour.'\"    Vaisampayana continued,--\"The great ascetic Narada, having answered  Yudhishthira thus, again asked that just ruler,--'Do the officers of  thy government, O king, that are paid from the taxes levied on the  community, take only their just dues from the merchants that come to  thy territories from distant lands impelled by the desire of gain? Are  the merchants, O king, treated with consideration in thy capital and  kingdom, capable of bringing their goods thither without being deceived  by the false pretexts of (both the buyers and the officers of  government)?    \"'Listenest thou always, O monarch, to the words, fraught with  instructions in religion and wealth, of old men acquainted with  economic doctrines? Are gifts of honey and clarified butter made to the  Brahmanas intended for the increase of agricultural produce, of kine,  of fruits and flowers, and for the sake of virtue? Givest thou always,  O king, regularly unto all the artisans and artists employed by thee  the materials of their works and their wages for periods not more than  four months? Examinest thou the works executed by those that are  employed by thee, and applaudest thou them before good men, and  rewardest thou them, having shewn them proper respect? O bull of the  Bharata race, followest thou the aphorisms (of the sage) in respect of  every concern particularly those relating to elephants, horses, and  cars? O bull of the Bharata race, are the aphorisms relating to the  science of arms, as also those that relate to the practice of engines  in warfare--so useful to towns and fortified places, studied in thy  court? O sinless one, art thou acquainted with all mysterious  incantations, and with the secrets of poisons destructive of all foes?  Protectest thou thy kingdom from the fear of fire, of snakes and other  animals destructive of life, of disease, and Rakshasas? As acquainted  thou art with every duty, cherishest thou like a father, the blind, the  dumb, the lame, the deformed, the friendless, and ascetics that have no  homes. Hast thou banished these six evils, O monarch, viz., sleep,  idleness, fear, anger, weakness of mind, and procrastination?'\"    Vaisampayana continued,--\"The illustrious bull among the Kurus, having  heard these words of that best of Brahmanas, bowed down unto him and  worshipped his feet. And gratified with everything he heard, the  monarch said unto Narada of celestial form,--'I shall do all that thou  hast directed, for my knowledge hath expanded under thy advice!' Having  said this the king acted conformably to that advice, and gained in time  the whole Earth bounded by her belt of seas. Narada again spoke,  saying,--'That king who is thus employed in the protection of four  orders, Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Sudras, passeth his days  here happily and attaineth hereafter to the region of Sakra (heaven).'\"      SECTION VI    Vaisampayana said,--\"At the conclusion of Narada's words, king  Yudhishthira the just worshipped him duly; and commanded by him the  monarch began to reply succinctly to the questions the Rishi had asked.    \"Yudhishthira said--'O holy one, the truths of religion and morality  thou hast indicated one after another, are just and proper. As regards  myself, I duly observe those ordinances to the best of my power.  Indeed, the acts that were properly performed by monarchs of yore are,  without doubt, to be regarded as bearing proper fruit, and undertaken  from solid reasons for the attainment of proper objects. O master, we  desire to walk in the virtuous path of those rulers that had, besides,  their souls under complete control.'\"    Vaisampayana continued,--\"Yudhishthira, the son of Pandu, possessed of  great glory, having received with reverence the words of Narada and  having also answered the Rishi thus, reflected for a moment. And  perceiving a proper opportunity, the monarch, seated beside the Rishi,  asked Narada sitting at his ease and capable of going into every world  at will, in the presence of that assembly of kings, saying,--'Possessed  of the speed of mind, thou wanderest over various and many worlds  created in days of yore by Brahma, beholding everything. Tell me, I ask  thee, if thou hast, O Brahmana, ever beheld before anywhere an assembly  room like this of mine or superior to it!' Hearing these words of  Yudhishthira the just, Narada smilingly answered the son of Pandu in  these sweet accents,--    \"Narada said,--'O child, O king I did neither see nor hear of ever  before amongst men, any assembly room built of gems and precious stones  like this of thine, O Bharata. I shall, however, describe unto thee the  rooms of the king of the departed (Yama), of Varuna (Neptune) of great  intelligence, of Indra, the King of Gods and also of him who hath his  home in Kailasha (Kuvera). I shall also describe unto thee the  celestial Sabha of Brahma that dispelleth every kind of uneasiness. All  these assembly rooms exhibit in their structure both celestial and  human designs and present every kind of form that exists in the  universe. And they are ever worshipped by the gods and the Pitris, the  Sadhyas, (under-deities called Gana), by ascetics offering sacrifices,  with souls under complete command, by peaceful Munis engaged without  intermission in Vedic sacrifices with presents to Brahmanas. I shall  describe all these to you if, O bull of the Bharata race, thou hast any  inclinations to listen to me!'\"    Vaisampayana continued,--\"Thus addressed by Narada, the high-souled  king Yudhishthira the just, with his brothers and all those foremost of  Brahmanas (seated around him), joined his hands (in entreaty). And the  monarch then asked Narada, saying,--'Describe unto us all those  assembly rooms. We desire to listen to thee. O Brahmana, what are the  articles with which each of the Sabhas are made of? What is the area of  each, and what is the length and breadth of each? Who wait upon the  Grandsire in that assembly room? And who also upon Vasava, the Lord of  the celestials and upon Yama, the son of Vivaswana? Who wait upon  Varuna and upon Kuvera in their respective assembly rooms. O Brahmana  Rishi, tell us all about these. We all together desire to hear thee  describe them. Indeed, our curiosity is great.'\" Thus addressed by the  son of Pandu, Narada replied, saying,--\"O monarch, hear ye all about  those celestial assembly rooms one after another.\"      SECTION VII    \"Narada said,--'the celestial assembly room of Sakra is full of lustre.  He hath obtained it as the fruit of his own acts. Possessed of the  splendour of the sun, it was built, O scion of the Kuru race, by Sakra  himself. Capable of going everywhere at will, this celestial assembly  house is full one hundred and fifty yojanas in length, and hundred  yojanas in breadth, and five yojanas in height. Dispelling weakness of  age, grief, fatigue, and fear, auspicious and bestowing good fortune,  furnished with rooms and seats and adorned with celestial trees, it is  delightful in the extreme. There sitteth in that assembly room, O son  of Pritha, on an excellent seat, the Lord of celestials, with his wife  Sachi endowed with beauty and affluence. Assuming a form incapable of  description for its vagueness, with a crown on his head and bright  bracelets on the upper arms, attired in robes of pure white and decked  with floral wreaths of many hues, there he sitteth with beauty, fame,  and glory by his side. And the illustrious deity of a hundred  sacrifices is daily waited upon, O monarch, in that assembly by the  Marutas in a body, each leading the life of a householder in the bosom  of his family. And the Siddhyas, celestial Rishis, the Sadhyas in all,  the gods, and Marutas of brilliant complexion and adorned with golden  garlands,--all of them in celestial form and decked in ornaments,  always wait upon and worship"]]]
