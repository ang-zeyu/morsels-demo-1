The contrary of  every matter of fact is still possible; because it can never imply a  contradiction, and is conceived by the mind with the same facility and  distinctness, as if ever so conformable to reality. _That the sun will  not rise to-morrow_ is no less intelligible a proposition, and implies  no more contradiction than the affirmation, _that it will rise_. We  should in vain, therefore, attempt to demonstrate its falsehood. Were it  demonstratively false, it would imply a contradiction, and could never  be distinctly conceived by the mind.    It may, therefore, be a subject worthy of curiosity, to enquire what is  the nature of that evidence which assures us of any real existence and  matter of fact, beyond the present testimony of our senses, or the  records of our memory. This part of philosophy, it is observable, has  been little cultivated, either by the ancients or moderns; and therefore  our doubts and errors, in the prosecution of so important an enquiry,  may be the more excusable; while we march through such difficult paths  without any guide or direction. They may even prove useful, by exciting  curiosity, and destroying that implicit faith and security, which is the  bane of all reasoning and free enquiry. The discovery of defects in the  common philosophy, if any such there be, will not, I presume, be a  discouragement, but rather an incitement, as is usual, to attempt  something more full and satisfactory than has yet been proposed to  the public.    22. All reasonings concerning matter of fact seem to be founded on the  relation of _Cause and Effect_. By means of that relation alone we can  go beyond the evidence of our memory and senses. If you were to ask a  man, why he believes any matter of fact, which is absent; for instance,  that his friend is in the country, or in France; he would give you a  reason; and this reason would be some other fact; as a letter received  from him, or the knowledge of his former resolutions and promises. A man  finding a watch or any other machine in a desert island, would conclude  that there had once been men in that island. All our reasonings  concerning fact are of the same nature. And here it is constantly  supposed that there is a connexion between the present fact and that  which is inferred from it. Were there nothing to bind them together, the  inference would be entirely precarious. The hearing of an articulate  voice and rational discourse in the dark assures us of the presence of  some person: Why? because these are the effects of the human make and  fabric, and closely connected with it. If we anatomize all the other  reasonings of this nature, we shall find that they are founded on the  relation of cause and effect, and that this relation is either near or  remote, direct or collateral. Heat and light are collateral effects of  fire, and the one effect may justly be inferred from the other.    23. If we would satisfy ourselves, therefore, concerning the nature of  that evidence, which assures us of matters of fact, we must enquire how  we arrive at the knowledge of cause and effect.    I shall venture to affirm, as a general proposition, which admits of no  exception, that the knowledge of this relation is not, in any instance,  attained by reasonings _a priori_; but arises entirely from experience,  when we find that any particular objects are constantly conjoined with  each other. Let an object be presented to a man of ever so strong  natural reason and abilities; if that object be entirely new to him, he  will not be able, by the most accurate examination of its sensible  qualities, to discover any of its causes or effects. Adam, though his  rational faculties be supposed, at the very first, entirely perfect,  could not have inferred from the fluidity and transparency of water that  it would suffocate him, or from the light and warmth of fire that it  would consume him. No object ever discovers, by the qualities which  appear to the senses, either the causes which produced it, or the  effects which will arise from it; nor can our reason, unassisted by  experience, ever draw any inference concerning real existence and  matter of fact.    24. This proposition, _that causes and effects are discoverable, not by  reason but by experience_, will readily be admitted with regard to such  objects, as we remember to have once been altogether unknown to us;  since we must be conscious of the utter inability, which we then lay  under, of foretelling what would arise from them. Present two smooth  pieces of marble to a man who has no tincture of natural philosophy; he  will never discover that they will adhere together in such a manner as  to require great force to separate them in a direct line, while they  make so small a resistance to a lateral pressure. Such events, as bear  little analogy to the common course of nature, are also readily  confessed to be known only by experience; nor does any man imagine that  the explosion of gunpowder, or the attraction of a loadstone, could ever  be discovered by arguments _a priori_. In like manner, when an effect is  supposed to depend upon an intricate machinery or secret structure of  parts, we make no difficulty in attributing all our knowledge of it to  experience. Who will assert that he can give the ultimate reason, why  milk or bread is proper nourishment for a man, not for a lion or  a tiger?    But the same truth may not appear, at first sight, to have the same  evidence with regard to events, which have become familiar to us from  our first appearance in the world, which bear a close analogy to the  whole course of nature, and which are supposed to depend on the simple  qualities of objects, without any secret structure of parts. We are apt  to imagine that we could discover these effects by the mere operation of  our reason, without experience. We fancy, that were we brought on a  sudden into this world, we could at first have inferred that one  Billiard-ball would communicate motion to another upon impulse; and that  we needed not to have waited for the event, in order to pronounce with  certainty concerning it. Such is the influence of custom, that, where it  is strongest, it not only covers our natural ignorance, but even  conceals itself, and seems not to take place, merely because it is found  in the highest degree.    25. But to convince us that all the laws of nature, and all the  operations of bodies without exception, are known only by experience,  the following reflections may, perhaps, suffice. Were any object  presented to us, and were we required to pronounce concerning the  effect, which will result from it, without consulting past observation;  after what manner, I beseech you, must the mind proceed in this  operation? It must invent or imagine some event, which it ascribes to  the object as its effect; and it is plain that this invention must be  entirely arbitrary. The mind can never possibly find the effect in the  supposed cause, by the most accurate scrutiny and examination. For the  effect is totally different from the cause, and consequently can never  be discovered in it. Motion in the second Billiard-ball is a quite  distinct event from motion in the first; nor is there anything in the  one to suggest the smallest hint of the other. A stone or piece of metal  raised into the air, and left without any support, immediately falls:  but to consider the matter _a priori_, is there anything we discover in  this situation which can beget the idea of a downward, rather than an  upward, or any other motion, in the stone or metal? And as the first  imagination or invention of a particular effect, in all natural  operations, is arbitrary, where we consult not experience; so must we  also esteem the supposed tie or connexion between the cause and effect,  which binds them together, and renders it impossible that any other  effect could result from the operation of that cause. When I see, for  instance, a Billiard-ball moving in a straight line towards another;  even suppose motion in the second ball should by accident be suggested  to me, as the result of their contact or impulse; may I not conceive,  that a hundred different events might as well follow from that cause?  May not both these balls remain at absolute rest? May not the first ball  return in a straight line, or leap off from the second in any line or  direction? All these suppositions are consistent and conceivable. Why  then should we give the preference to one, which is no more consistent  or conceivable than the rest? All our reasonings _a priori_ will never  be able to show us any foundation for this preference.    In a word, then, every effect is a distinct event from its cause. It  could not, therefore, be discovered in the cause, and the first  invention or conception of it, _a priori_, must be entirely arbitrary.  And even after it is suggested, the conjunction of it with the cause  must appear equally arbitrary; since there are always many other  effects, which, to reason, must seem fully as consistent and natural. In  vain, therefore, should we pretend to determine any single event, or  infer any cause or effect, without the assistance of observation and  experience.    26. Hence we may discover the reason why no philosopher, who is rational  and modest, has ever pretended to assign the ultimate cause of any  natural operation, or to show distinctly the action of that power, which  produces any single effect in the universe. It is confessed, that the  utmost effort of human reason is to reduce the principles, productive of  natural phenomena, to a greater simplicity, and to resolve the many  particular effects into a few general causes, by means of reasonings  from analogy, experience, and observation. But as to the causes of these  general causes, we should in vain attempt their discovery; nor shall we  ever be able "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9666"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 497, July 11, 1885 (#5)"],[1,"lb. The heads are made of 5/46 in. flange iron, the bottom  of 1/2 in., and the upper half of the shell of 3/16 in. tank iron.    In October, 1865, the Oil Transportation Co. completed and tested a  pipe-line 32,000 feet long; three pumps were used upon it, two at  Pithole and one at Little Pithole. July 1, 1876, the pipe-line owners  held a meeting at Parkers to organize a pipe-line company to extend to  the seaboard under the charter of the Pennsylvania Transportation Co.,  but the scheme was never carried out. In January, 1878, the Producers'  Union organized for a similar seaboard line, and laid pipes, but they  never reached the sea, stopping their line at Tamanend, Pa. The lines  of the National Transit Co., illustrated in our map, were completed in  1880-81, and this company, to which the United Pipe Lines have also  been transferred, is said to have $15,000,000 invested in plant for the  transport of oil to tide water.    The National Transit Co. was organized under what was called the  Pennsylvania Co. act, about four years ago, and succeeded to the  properties of the American Transit Co., a corporation operating under  the laws of Pennsylvania. Since its organization the first named company  has constructed and now owns the following systems:    The line from Olean, N.Y., to Bayonne, N.J., and to Brooklyn, N.Y., of  which a full page profile is given, showing the various pumping stations  and the undulations over its route of about 300 miles. The Pennsylvania  line, 280 miles long, from Colegrove, Pa., to Philadelphia. The  Baltimore line, 70 miles long, from Millway, Pa., to Baltimore. The  Cleveland line, 100 miles long, from Hilliards, Pa., to Cleveland, O.  The Buffalo line, 70 miles long, from Four Mile, Cattaraugus County,  N.Y., to Buffalo, and the line from Carbon Center, Butler County, Pa.,  to Pittsburg, 60 miles in length. This amounts to a total of 880 miles  of main pipe-line alone, ranging from 4 inches to 6 inches in diameter;  or, adding the duplicate pipes on the Olean New York line, we have a  round total of 1,330 miles, not including loops and shorter branches and  the immense network of the pipes in the oil regions proper.    A general description of the longest line will practically suffice for  all, as they differ only in diameter of pipe used and power of the  pumping plant. As shown on the map and profile, this long line starts at  Olean, near the southern boundary of New York State, and proceeds by the  route indicated to tide water at Bayonne, N.J., and by a branch under  the North and East rivers and across the upper end of New York city to  the Long Island refineries. This last named pipe is of unusual strength,  and passes through Central Park; few of the thousands who daily frequent  the latter spot being aware of the yellow stream of crude petroleum that  is constantly flowing beneath their feet. The following table gives the  various pumping stations on this Olean New York line, and some data  relating to distances between stations and elevations overcome:      |----------------------------------------------------------------|    |                      |           |                |  Greatest  |    |                      |           |                |   Summit   |    |                      |   Miles   |   Elevation    |   between  |    |                      |  between  |  above Tide.   |  Stations. |    |  Pumping Stations.   | Stations. |     Ft.        |     Ft.    |    |______________________|___________|________________|____________|    | Olean                |    --     |     1,490      |     --     |    | Wellsville           |   28.20   |     1,510      |   2,490    |    | Cameron              |   27.91   |     1,042      |   2,530    |    | West Junction        |   29.70   |       911      |   1,917    |    | Catatonk             |   27.37   |       869      |   1,768    |    | Osborne              |   27.99   |     1,092      |   1,539    |    | Hancock              |   29.86   |       922      |   1,873    |    | Cochecton            |   26.22   |       748      |   1,854    |    | Swartwout            |   28.94   |       475      |   1,478    |    | Newfoundland         |   29.00   |       768      |   1,405    |    | Saddle River         |   28.77   |        35      |     398    |    |______________________|___________|________________|____________|    On this line two six-inch pipes are laid the entire length, and a third  six-inch pipe runs between Wellsville and Cameron, and about half way  between each of the other stations, \"looped\" around them. The pipe used  for the transportation of oil is especially manufactured to withstand  the great strain to which it will be subjected, the most of it being  made by the Chester Pipe and Tube Works, of Chester, Pa., the Allison  Manufacturing Co., of Philadelphia and the Penna. Tube Works, of  Pittsburg, Pa. It is a lap-welded, wrought-iron pipe of superior  material, and made with exceeding care and thoroughly tested at the  works. The pipe is made in lengths of 18 feet, and these pieces are  connected by threaded ends and extra strong sleeves. The pipe-thread and  sleeves used on the ordinary steam and water pipe are not strong enough  for the duty demanded of the oil-pipe. The socket for a 4-inch steam  or water pipe is from 21/2 to to 23/4 inches long, and is tapped with 8  standard threads to the inch, straight or parallel to the axis of the  pipe; with this straight tap only three or four threads come in contact  with the socket threads, or in any way assist in holding the pipes  together. In the oil-pipe, the pipe ends and sockets are cut on a taper  of 3/4 inch to 1 foot, for a 4-inch pipe, and the socket used is thicker  than the steam and water socket, is 33/4 inches long, and has entrance for  1 5/8 inches of thread on each pipe end tapped with 9 standard threads  to the inch. In this taper socket you have iron to iron the whole length  of the thread, and the joint is perfect and equal by test to the full  strength of the pipe. Up to 1877 the largest pipe used on the oil lines  was 4-inch, with the usual steam thread, but the joints leaked under the  pressure, 1,200 pounds to the square inch being the maximum the 8-thread  pipe would stand. This trouble has been remedied by the 9-thread,  taper-cut pipe of the present day, which is tested at the mill to 1,500  pounds pressure, while the average duty required is 1,200 pounds; as the  iron used in the manufacture of this line-pipe will average a tensile  test strain of 55,000 pounds per square inch, the safety factor is thus  about one-sixth.    [Illustration: PROFILE SHOWING NATIONAL TRANSIT CO.'S PIPE-LINE, FROM  OLEAN TO SADDLE RIVER.]    The line-pipe is laid between the stations in the ordinary manner,  excepting that great care is exercised in perfecting the joints. No  expansion joints or other special appliances of like nature are used on  the line as far as we can learn; the variations in temperature being  compensated for, in exposed locations, by laying the pipe in long  horizontal curves. The usual depth below the surface is about 3 feet,  though in some portions of the route the pipe lies for miles exposed  directly upon the surface. As the oil pumped is crude oil, and this as  it comes from the wells carries with it a considerable proportion of  brine, freezing in the pipes is not to be apprehended. The oil,  however, does thicken in very cold weather, and the temperature has a  considerable influence on the delivery.    A very ingenious patented device is used for cleaning out the pipes, and  by it the delivery is said to have been increased in certain localities  50 per cent. This is a stem about 21/2 feet long, having at its front end  a diaphragm made of wings which can fold on each other, and thus enable  it to pass an obstruction it cannot remove; this machine carries a set  of steel scrapers, somewhat like those used in cleaning boilers. The  device is put into the pipe, and propelled by the pressure transmitted  from the pumps from one station to another; relays of men follow the  scraper by the noise it makes as it goes through the pipe, one party  taking up the pursuit as the other is exhausted. They must never let it  get out of their hearing, for if it stops unnoticed, its location can  only again be established by cutting the pipe.    The pumping stations are substantial structures of brick, roofed with  iron. The boiler house is removed some distance from the engine house  for greater safety from fire; the building, about 40 by 50 feet,  contains from six to seven tubular boilers, each 5 by 14 feet, and  containing 80 three-inch tubes. The pump house is a similar brick  structure about 40 by 60 feet, and contains the battery of pumping  engines to be described later. At each station are two iron tanks, 90  feet in diameter and 30 feet high; into these tanks the oil is delivered  from the preceding station, and from them the oil is pumped into the  tanks at the next station beyond. The pipe-system at each station is  simple, and by means of the \"loop-lines\" before mentioned the oil can be  pumped directly around any station if occasion would require it.    The pumps used on all these lines are the Worthington compound,  condensing, pressure pumping engines. The general characteristics of  these pumps are, independent plungers with exterior packing, valve-boxes  subdivided into separate small chambers capable of resisting very heavy  strains, and leather-faced metallic valves with low lift and large  surfaces. These engines vary in power from 200 to 800 horse-power,  according to duty required. They are in continuous use, day and night,  and are required to deliver about 15,000 barrels of crude oil per 24  hours, under a pressure equivalent to an elevation of 3,500 feet.    We have lately examined the latest pumping engine plant, and the largest  yet built for this service, by the firm of H.R. Worthington; it is to be"]]]
