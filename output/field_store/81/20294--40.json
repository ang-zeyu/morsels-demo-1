The buildings, too, he made to look  like real houses leading away into the distance, and not just like a  flat picture.    He painted many frescoes both in Florence and Rome, this Ugly Tom, but  at the time the people did not pay him much honour, for they thought  him just a great awkward fellow with his head always in the clouds.  Perhaps if he had lived longer fame and wealth would have come to him,  but he died when he was still a young man, and only a few realised how  great he was.    But in after years, one by one, all the great artists would come to  that little chapel of the Carmine there to learn their first lessons  from those life-like figures. Especially they would stand before the  fresco which shows St. Peter baptizing a crowd of people. And in that  fresco they would study more than all the figure of a boy who has just  come out of the water, shivering with cold, the most natural figure  that had ever been painted up to that time.    All things must be learnt little by little, and each new thing we know  is a step onwards. So this figure of the shivering boy marks a higher  step of the golden ladder of Art than any that had been touched before.  And this alone would have made the name of Masaccio worthy to be placed  upon the list of world's great painters.        FRA FILIPPO LIPPI    It was winter time in Florence. The tramontana, that keen wind which  blows from over the snow mountains, was sweeping down the narrow  streets, searching out every nook and corner with its icy breath. Men  flung their cloaks closer round them, and pulled their hats down over  their eyes, so that only the tips of their noses were left uncovered  for the wind to freeze. Women held their scaldinoes, little pots of hot  charcoal, closer under their shawls, and even the dogs had a sad,  half-frozen look. One and all longed for the warm winds of spring and  the summer heat they loved. It was bad enough for those who had warm  clothes and plenty of polenta, but for the poor life was very hard  those cold wintry days.    In a doorway of a great house, in one of the narrow streets, a little  boy of eight was crouching behind one of the stone pillars as he tried  to keep out of the grip of the tramontana. His little coat was folded  closely round him, but it was full of rents and holes so that the thin  body inside was scarcely covered, and the child's blue lips trembled  with the cold, and his black eyes filled with tears.    It was not often that Filippo turned such a sad little face to meet the  world. Usually those black eyes sparkled with fun and mischief, and the  mouth spread itself into a merry grin. But to-day, truly things were  worse than he ever remembered them before, and he could remember fairly  bad times, too, if he tried.    Other children had their fathers and mothers who gave them food and  clothes, but he seemed to be quite different, and never had had any one  to care for him. True, there was his aunt, old Mona Lapaccia, who said  he had once had a father and mother like other boys, but she always  added with a mournful shake of her head that she alone had endured all  the trouble and worry of bringing him up since he was two years old.  'Ah,' she would say, turning her eyes upwards, 'the saints alone know  what I have endured with a great hungry boy to feed and clothe.'    It seemed to Filippo that in that case the saints must also know how  very little he had to eat, and how cold he was on these wintry days.  But of course they would be too grand to care about a little boy.    In summer things were different. One could roll merrily about in the  sunshine all day long, and at night sleep in some cool sheltering  corner of the street. And then, too, there was always a better chance  of picking up something to eat. Plenty of fig skins and melon parings  were flung carelessly out into the street when fruit was plentiful, and  people would often throw away the remains of a bunch of grapes. It was  wonderful how quickly Filippo learned to know people's faces, and to  guess who would finish to the last grape and who would throw the  smaller ones away. Some would even smile as they caught his anxious,  waiting eye fixed on the fruit, and would cry 'Catch' as they threw a  goodly bunch into those small brown hands that never let anything slip  through their fingers.    Oh, yes, summer was all right, but there was always winter to face.  To-day he was so very hungry, and the lupin skins which he had  collected for his breakfast were all eaten long ago. He had hung about  the little open shops, sniffing up the delicious smell of fried  polenta, but no one had given him a morsel. All he had got was a stern  'be off' when he ventured too close to the tempting food. If only this  day had been a festa, he might have done well enough. For in the great  processions when the priests and people carried their lighted candles  round the church, he could always dart in and out with his little iron  scraper, lift the melted wax of the marble floor and sell it over again  to the candlemakers.    But there were no processions to-day, and there remained only one thing  to be done. He must go home and see if Mona Lapaccia had anything to  spare. Perhaps the saints took notice when he was hungry.    Down the street he ran, keeping close to the wall, just as the dogs do  when it rains. For the great overhanging eaves of the houses act as a  sheltering umbrella. Then out into the broad street that runs beside  the river, where, even in winter, the sun shines warmly if it shines  anywhere.    Filippo paused at the corner of the Ponte alla Carraja to watch the  struggles of a poor mule which was trying to pull a huge cartload of  wood up the steep incline of the bridge. It was so exciting that for a  moment he forgot how cold and hungry he was, as he shouted and screamed  directions with the rest of the crowd, darted in and out in his  eagerness to help, and only got into every one's way.    That excitement over, Filippo felt in better spirits and ran quickly  across the bridge. He soon threaded his way to a poor street that led  towards one of the city gates, where everything looked dirtier and more  cheerless than ever. He had not expected a welcome, and he certainly  did not get one, as, after climbing the steep stairs, he cautiously  pushed open the door and peeped in.    His aunt's thin face looked dark and angry. Poor soul, she had had no  breakfast either, and there would be no food that day unless her work  was finished. And here was this troublesome boy back again, when she  thought she had got rid of him for the day.    'Away!' she shouted crossly. 'What dost thou mean by coming back so  soon? Away, and seek thy living in the streets.'    'It is too cold,' said the boy, creeping into the bare room, 'and I am  hungry.'    'Hungry!' and poor Mona Lapaccia cast her eyes upwards, as if she would  ask the saints if they too were not filled with surprise to hear this  word. 'And when art thou anything else? It is ever the same story with  thee: eat, eat, eat. Now, the saints help me, I have borne this burden  long enough. I will see if I cannot shift it on to other shoulders.'    She rose as she spoke, tied her yellow handkerchief over her head and  smoothed out her apron. Then she caught Filippo by his shoulder and  gave him a good shake, just to teach him how wrong it was to talk of  being hungry, and pushing him in front of her they went downstairs  together.    'Where art thou going?' gasped the boy as she dragged him swiftly along  the street.    'Wait and thou shalt see,' she answered shortly; 'and do thou mind thy  manners, else will I mind them for thee.'    Filippo ran along a little quicker on hearing this advice. He had but a  dim notion of what minding his manners might mean, but he guessed  fairly well what would happen if his aunt minded them. Ah! here they  were at the great square of the Carmine. He had often crept into the  church to get warm and to see those wonderful pictures on the walls.  Could they be going there now?    But it was towards the convent door that Mona Lapaccia bent her steps,  and, when she had rung the bell, she gave Filippo's shoulder a final  shake, and pulled his coat straight and smoothed his hair.    A fat, good-natured brother let them in, and led them through the many  passages into a room where the prior sat finishing his midday meal.    Filippo's hungry eyes were immediately fixed on a piece of bread which  lay upon the table, and the kindly prior smiled as he nodded his head  towards it.    Not another invitation did Filippo need; like a bird he darted forward  and snatched the piece of good white bread, and holding it in both  hands he began to munch to his heart's content. How long it was since  he had tasted anything like this! It was so delicious that for a few  blissful moments he forgot where he was, forgot his aunt and the great  man who was looking at him with such kind eyes.    But presently he heard his own name spoken and then he looked up and  remembered. 'And so, Filippo, thou wouldst become a monk?' the prior  was saying. 'Let me see--how old art thou?'    'Eight years old, your reverence,' said Mona Lapaccia before Filippo  could answer. Which was just as well, as his mouth was still very full.    'And it is thy desire to leave the world, and enter our convent?'  continued the prior. 'Art thou willing to give up all, that thou mayest  become a servant of God?'    The little dirty brown hands clutched the bread in dismay. Did the kind  man mean that he was to give up his bread when he had scarcely eaten  half of it?    'No, no; eat thy bread, child,' said the prior, with an understanding  nod. 'Thou art but a babe, but we will make a good monk of thee yet.'    Then, indeed, began happy days for Filippo. No more threadbare coats,  but a warm little brown serge robe, tied round the waist with a rope  whose ends grew daily shorter as the way round his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5307"],[0,"The Letters of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart — Volume 01 (#5)"],[1,"  non vale un corno, ne pure quello che la dirigge. Il titolo dell' opera  che ho da comporre a Milano, non si sa ancora.    [Footnote: \"My prayer to God is, that He may grant you health, and allow  you to live to be a hundred, and not to die till you are a thousand  years old. I hope that you will learn to know me better in future, and  that you will then judge of me as you please. Time does not permit me  to write much. My pen is not worth a pin, nor the hand that guides it. I  don't yet know the title of the opera that I am to compose at Milan.\"]    My landlady at Rome made me a present of the \"Thousand and One Nights\"  in Italian; it is most amusing to read.        19.    Bologna, August 4, 1770.    I GRIEVE from my heart to hear that Jungfrau Marthe is still so ill, and  I pray every day that she may recover. Tell her from me that she must  beware of much fatigue and eat only what is strongly salted [she  was consumptive]. A propos, did you give my letter to Robinsiegerl?  [Sigismund Robinig, a friend of his]. You did not mention it when you  wrote. I beg that when you see him you will tell him he is not quite  to forget me. I can't possibly write better, for my pen is only fit to  write music and not a letter. My violin has been newly strung, and I  play every day. I only mention this because mamma wished to know whether  I still played the violin. I have had the honor to go at least six times  by myself into the churches to attend their splendid ceremonies. In the  mean time I have composed four Italian symphonies [overtures], besides  five or six arias, and also a motett.    Does Herr Deibl often come to see you? Does he still honor you by his  amusing conversation? And the noble Herr Carl von Vogt, does he still  deign to listen to your tiresome voices? Herr von Schiedenhofen  must assist you often in writing minuets, otherwise he shall have no  sugar-plums.    If time permitted, it would be my duty to trouble Herr von Molk and Herr  von Schiedenhofen with a few lines; but as that most indispensable of  all things is wanting, I hope they will forgive my neglect, and consider  me henceforth absolved from this honor. I have begun various cassations  [a kind of divertimento], so I have thus responded to your desire. I  don't think the piece in question can be one of mine, for who would  venture to publish as his own composition what is, in reality, written  by the son of the Capellmeister, and whose mother and sister are in  the same town? Addio--farewell! My sole recreations consist in dancing  English hornpipes and cutting capers. Italy is a land of sleep; I am  always drowsy here. Addio--good-bye!        20.    Bologna, August 21, 1770.    I AM not only still alive, but in capital spirits. To-day I took a fancy  to ride a donkey, for such is the custom in Italy, so I thought that I  too must give it a trial. We have the honor to associate with a certain  Dominican who is considered a very pious ascetic. I somehow don't quite  think so, for he constantly takes a cup of chocolate for breakfast, and  immediately afterwards a large glass of strong Spanish wine; and I have  myself had the privilege of dining with this holy man, when he drank a  lot of wine at dinner and a full glass of very strong wine afterwards,  two large slices of melons, some peaches and pears for dessert, five  cups of coffee, a whole plateful of nuts, and two dishes of milk and  lemons. This he may perhaps do out of bravado, but I don't think so--at  all events, it is far too much; and he eats a great deal also at his  afternoon collation.        21.    Bologna, Sept. 8, 1770.    NOT to fail in my duty, I must write a few words. I wish you would tell  me in your next letter to what brotherhoods I belong, and also let  me know the prayers I am bound to offer up for them. I am now reading  \"Telemachus,\" and am already in the second volume. Good-bye for the  present! Love to mamma.        22.    I HOPE that mamma and you are both well, but I wish you would answer  my letters more punctually in time to come; indeed, it is far easier to  answer than to originate. I like these six minuets far better than the  first twelve; we often played them to the Countess [Pallivicini, at  whose country-seat, near Bologna, father and son spent some months].  We only wish we could succeed in introducing a taste for German minuets  into Italy, as their minuets last nearly as long as entire symphonies.  Forgive my bad writing; I could write better, but I am in such a hurry.        23.    Bologna, Sept. 29, 1770.    IN order to fill up papa's letter, I intend to add a few words. I grieve  deeply to hear of Jungfrau Marthe's long-continued illness, which the  poor girl bears, too, with such patience. I hope, please God, she may  still recover. If not, we must not grieve too much, for the will of God  is always best, and God certainly knows better than we do whether it is  most for our good to be in this world or in the next. But it will cheer  her to enjoy this fine weather once more after all the rain.        24.    Bologna, Oct. 6, 1770.    I AM heartily glad that you have been so gay; I only wish I had been  with you. I hope Jungfrau Marthe is better. To-day I played the organ at  the Dominicans. Congratulate the .... from me, and say that I sincerely  wish they may live to see the fiftieth anniversary of Father Dominikus's  saying mass, and that we may all once more have a happy meeting.    [Footnote: Jahn observes that he probably alludes to their intimate  friends, the merchant Hagenauer's family, with whom old Mozart had many  pecuniary transactions for the purpose of his travels, and whose son  entered the church in 1764.]    My best wishes to all Thereserls, and compliments to all my friends in  the house and out of the house. I wish I were likely soon to hear the  Berchtesgadner symphonies, and perhaps blow a trumpet or play a fife  in one myself. I saw and heard the great festival of St. Petronius in  Bologna. It was fine, but long. The trumpeters came from Lucca to make  the proper flourish of honor, but their trumpeting was detestable.        25.    Milan, Oct. 20, 1770.    MY DEAR MAMMA,--    I cannot write much, for my fingers ache from writing out such a  quantity of recitative. I hope you will pray for me that my opera  [\"Mitridate Re di Ponto\"] may go off well, and that we soon may have  a joyful meeting. I kiss your hands a thousand times, and have a great  deal to say to my sister; but what? That is known only to God and  myself. Please God, I hope soon to be able to confide it to her  verbally; in the mean time, I send her a thousand kisses. My compliments  to all kind friends. We have lost our good Martherl, but we hope that by  the mercy of God she is now in a state of blessedness.        26.    Milan, Oct. 27, 1770.    MY VERY DEAREST SISTER,--    You know that I am a great talker, and was so when I left you. At  present I replace this very much by signs, for the son of this family  is deaf and dumb. I must now set to work at my opera. I regret very much  that I cannot send you the minuet you wish to have, but, God willing,  perhaps about Easter you may see both it and me. I can write no  more.--Farewell! and pray for me.        27.    Milan, Nov. 3, 1770.    MY VERY DEARLY LOVED SISTER,--    I thank you and mamma for your sincere good wishes; my most ardent  desire is to see you both soon in Salzburg. In reference to your  congratulations, I may say that I believe Herr Martinelli suggested  your Italian project. My dear sister, you are always so very clever,  and contrived it all so charmingly that, just underneath your  congratulations in Italian, followed M. Martini's compliments in the  same style of penmanship, so that I could not possibly find you out; nor  did I do so, and I immediately said to papa, \"Oh! how I do wish I were  as clever and witty as she is!\" Then papa answered, \"Indeed, that is  true enough.\" On which I rejoined, \"Oh! I am so sleepy;\" so he merely  replied, \"Then stop writing.\" Addio! Pray to God that my opera may be  successful. I am your brother,    W. M.,    whose fingers are weary from writing.        28.    Milan, Dec. 1, 1770.    DEAREST SISTER,--    As it is so long since I wrote to you, I thought that I might perhaps  pacify your just wrath and indignation by these lines. I have now a  great deal to work at, and to write for my opera. I trust all will go  well, with the help of God. Addio! As ever, your faithful brother,    WOLFGANG MOZART.        29.    MY DARLING SISTER,--    It is long since I have written to you, having been so much occupied  with my opera. As I have now more time, I shall attend better to my  duty. My opera, thank God, is popular, as the theatre is full every  evening, which causes great surprise, for many say that during all the  time they have lived in Milan they never saw any first opera so crowded  as on this occasion. I am thankful to say that both papa and I are quite  well, and I hope at Easter to have an opportunity of relating everything  to mamma and you. Addio! A propos, the copyist was with us yesterday,  and said that he was at that moment engaged in transcribing my opera for  the Lisbon court. Good-bye, my dear Madlle. sister,    Always and ever your attached brother.        30.    Venice, Feb 15, 1771    MY VERY DEAR SISTER,--    You have, no doubt, heard from papa that I am well. I have nothing to  write about, except my love and kisses to mamma. Give the enclosed--Al  sig. Giovanni.
