On the way the horse became frightened, ran down a hill, and  turned over the wagon, with us in it. We were in danger, but were again  saved by the hand of Providence. None of us were injured.    \"One day I climbed an elm tree to procure some bark; while about  fifteen feet from the ground, the limb upon which I stood, being dry,  broke, and I fell to the ground upon my back. The accident apparently  knocked the breath out of my body. A cousin ran to the house and told  my parents that I was dead, but before my friends reached me I revived,  rose to my feet, and met them on the way.    \"When twelve years old I was nearly drowned in Farmington River. I sank  in thirty feet of water, and was miraculously saved by a young man  named Bacon. The restoration to life caused me great suffering.    \"At thirteen years of age, while passing through Farmington {8}  meadows, in the depths of winter, in a blinding snowstorm, I became  so chilled and overcome with cold that I could not travel. I crawled  into the hollow of a large apple tree. A man in the distance saw me,  and, realizing the danger I was in, hastened to where I was. Before he  arrived at the spot I had fallen asleep, and was almost unconscious. He  had much difficulty in arousing me to a sense of my critical condition,  and promptly had me conveyed to my father's house, where, through a  kind Providence, my life was again preserved.    \"At fourteen years of age I split my left instep open with an ax which  went almost through my foot. I suffered intensely from this injury, and  my foot was nine months in getting well.    \"When fifteen years old I was bitten in the hand by a mad dog in the  last stages of hydrophobia. However, he did not draw blood, and through  the mercy and power of God I was again preserved from an awful death.    \"At the age of seventeen I met with an accident which caused me  much suffering, and came nearly ending my life. I was riding a very  ill-tempered horse, which, while going down a very steep, rocky hill,  suddenly leaped from the road and ran down the steepest part of the  hill, going at full speed amid the thickest of the rocks. At the same  time, he commenced kicking, and was about to land me over his head  among the rocks, but I lodged on the top of his head, and grabbed  each of his ears with my hands, expecting every moment to be dashed  to pieces against the rocks. While in this position, sitting astride  the horse's neck, with neither bridle nor other means of guiding him  except his ears, he plunged down the hill among the rocks with great  fury, until he struck a rock nearly breast high, which threw him to  the earth. I went over his head, landing squarely upon my feet almost  one rod in front of the horse. Alighting upon my feet was probably the  means of saving my life; for if I had struck the ground upon any other  part of my body, it would probably have killed me instantly. As it was,  one of my legs was broken in two places, and both my ankles put out  of place in a shocking manner. The horse almost rolled over me in his  struggles to get up. My uncle saw me, and came to my assistance. I was  carried to his house in an armchair. I lay from 2 o'clock {9} in the  afternoon until 10 o'clock at night without medical aid and in great  pain, when my father arrived with Dr. Swift, of Farmington. The doctor  set my bones, boxed up my limbs, and that night conveyed me eight  miles in his carriage to my father's house. I had good attention, and  although my sufferings were great, in eight weeks I was out upon my  crutches, and was soon restored to a sound condition.    \"In 1827, while managing a flour mill for Aunt Wheeler, in Avon, Conn.,  I was standing upon one of the wheels, clearing away the ice. A man,  not knowing I was in that position, hoisted the gate and turned upon  the wheel a full head of water. The wheel started at once, my foot  slipped, and I was plunged head foremost over the rim of the wheel  into about three feet of water. My weight had drawn my legs out of the  wheel, or I would have been drawn under a shaft and crushed to death.    \"In 1831, while in charge of a flour mill at Collinsville, Conn., I  was standing upon one of the arms inside of a breast-wheel twenty feet  in diameter, clearing off the ice. A full head of water was turned  on suddenly. The wheel started instantly. I dropped my ax and leaped  about twenty feet to the bottom of the wheel. As I struck the bottom,  I rolled out against a rugged stone, with only two feet of clearance  between the stone and the wheel. The latter caught me and rolled me  out into the water below, where I found myself, much frightened, but  thankful to Providence that no bones were broken.    \"The day that I was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints--December 31, 1833--my horse, with newly calked  shoes, kicked the hat off my head. If he had struck two inches lower,  doubtless he would have killed me instantly. Ten minutes later, while  driving the same horse and another hitched to a sled with loose boards  on the bottom and no box, the boards slipped forward under the pole  and struck the ground. This at once threw the boards up endwise, and  pitched me forward between the horses. I held on the lines; the horses,  frightened, ran down the hill, dragging me under the sled behind them.  The road, however, was smooth, and I escaped without injury.    \"In 1834, while traveling in Zion's Camp to Missouri, a rifle was  discharged accidentally. The ball passed through three {10} tents with  a dozen men in each, and lodged in the axletree of a wagon, without  injury to anyone; it passed within a few inches of my breast. Many  others escaped quite as providentially as I did.    \"A few months later a musket, heavily loaded with buckshot, and pointed  directly at my breast, was snapped accidentally; but it missed fire,  and again the Lord preserved my life.    \"In April, 1839, in Rochester, Ills., I was riding upon the  running-gear of a wagon. I sat upon the front axletree. The bolt  came out of the coupling-pole, separating the wheels, the front from  the rear; and my weight upon the front bolster and tongue turned the  coupling-pole over on the horses' backs, turned the stakes upside down,  which shut me between the bolster and tongue, but in such a manner that  my head and shoulders dragged upon the ground. The horses took fright  and ran into an open prairie. They dragged me for about half a mile,  and notwithstanding my awkward position I managed to guide them so as  to run them into the corner of a high worm-fence, where we landed in  a pile together. I was considerable bruised, but escaped without any  broken bones, and after one day's rest was able to attend to my labors  again.    \"On the 15th day of October, 1846, while with the Camp of Israel  building up Winter Quarters, on the west side of the Missouri River  (then Indian country,) I passed through one of the most painful and  serious misfortunes of my life. I took my ax and went two and a half  miles upon the bluff to cut some shingle timber to cover my cabin. I  was accompanied by two men. While felling the third tree, I stepped  back of it some eight feet, where I thought I was entirely out of  danger. There was, however, a crook in the tree, which, when the  tree fell, struck a knoll and caused the tree to bound endwise back  of the stump. As it bounded backwards, the butt end of the tree hit  me in the breast, and knocked me back and above the ground several  feet, against a standing oak. The falling tree followed me in its  bounds and severely crushed me against the standing tree. I fell to  the ground, alighting upon my feet. My left thigh and hip were badly  bruised, also my left arm; my breastbone and three ribs on my left side  were broken. I was bruised about my lungs, vitals and left side in a  serious manner. After the accident {11} I sat upon a log while Mr. John  Garrison went a quarter of a mile and got my horse. Notwithstanding  I was so badly hurt, I had to mount my horse and ride two and a half  miles over an exceedingly rough road. On account of severe pain I had  to dismount twice on my way home. My breast and vitals were so badly  injured that at each step of the horse pain went through me like an  arrow. I continued on horseback until I arrived at Turkey Creek, on  the north side of Winter Quarters. I was then exhausted, and was taken  off the horse and carried in a chair to my wagon. I was met in the  street by Presidents Brigham Young. Heber C. Kimball, Willard Richards,  and others, who assisted in carrying me to the wagon. Before placing  me upon my bed they laid hands upon me, and in the name of the Lord  rebuked the pain and distress, and said that I should live, and not  die. I was then laid upon my bed in the wagon, as my cabin was not yet  done. As the apostles prophesied upon my head, so it came to pass; I  did not die. I employed no physician, but was administered to by the  elders of Israel, and nursed by my wife. I lay upon my bed, unable to  move until my breast-bone began to knit together on the ninth day. In  about twenty days I began to walk, and in thirty days from the time I  was hurt. I returned to my laborious employment.    \"I have not now a lame limb about me, notwithstanding it all. I have  been able to endure the hardest kind of manual labor, exposures,  hardships, and journeys. I have walked forty, fifty, and, on one  occasion, sixty miles in a single day. The only inconvenience I am  now conscious of is that if I overwork, or take a severe cold, I feel  it more sensibly in my breast and left side than I did before my last  injury.

That the old  settlers {XXII} in Missouri, even those friendly disposed towards the  Saints, recognized the incompatibility of the two classes is evident  from the public utterances of a mass meeting held at Liberty, in Clay  county, when the Saints were urged to seek anew locality where they  could live by themselves. \"They are eastern men,\" said the address,  \"whose manners, habits, customs, and even dialect, are essentially  different from our own. We earnestly urge them to seek some other  abiding place, where the manners, the habits, and customs of the people  will be more consonant with their own.\" [4]    This difference of character between the Saints and the old settlers I  account one of the causes of the Missouri persecutions.    _The Question of Slavery_.    The question of slavery in Missouri was a delicate one. It will perhaps  be remembered that it was the application of the territory of Missouri  for admission into the Union, 1818-19, that brought the question  of slavery into one of its acute stages before the country; and  inaugurated a long series of debates in the National Congress on the  subject. It was upon the admission of Missouri into the Union in 1821  that the great Compromise which bears the state's name settled, not the  question of slavery itself, but, for the time, the agitation of it.    That Compromise consisted finally in this: that while Missouri herself  was admitted with a clause in her constitution permitting slavery, and  also prohibiting free people of color from immigrating into the state,  slavery was forever to be prohibited in all territory of the United  States north of the line thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes north  latitude (the southern boundary line of the state of Missouri); and  Missouri was required \"by a solemn, public act\" of her legislature,  to declare that the clause in her constitution relating to the  immigration of free negroes into the state, should never be construed  to authorize the passage of any law by which any citizen of either of  the states in this Union shall be excluded from the enjoyment of any  of the privileges and immunities to which he is entitled under the  Constitution of the United States.    These historical facts are referred to here that the reader may be  reminded that slavery was a delicate question in Missouri; that her  people were super-sensitive about it since she was the first territory  upon which the National Congress sought to impose the prohibition of  slavery as a condition precedent to her admission into the Union,  which, up to that time, had been a matter left to the people of the  territory seeking admission to determine for themselves. Of course this  attempt at {XXIII} restriction of slavery was made by northern members  of the national Congress. [5] All the sentiment for the restriction  of slavery was in the North. In 1831 the sentiment for the positive  abolition of slavery had made such progress in Massachusetts, that  William Lloyd Garrison established in Boston \"_The Liberator_,\" a paper  which advocated \"the immediate and unconditional emancipation of every  slave in the United States.\" As a result of this agitation anti-slavery  societies were formed and active measures taken to advocate these  opinions by means of lectures and pamphlets. These extreme measures  against slavery did not meet with the approval of all or even the  majority of the people of New England, much less with the approval  of the people of other northern states. Still this agitation arose  and was chiefly supported in New England. It will not be difficult to  understand, therefore, that any considerable number of people from  that section of the Union immigrating into a slave state would arouse  suspicion; especially when that immigration was into a slave state upon  which, when as a territory she had made application for admission into  the Union, prohibition of slavery was sought to be enforced by the  northern members of the National Congress. Nor will it be sufficient  to dispel this suspicion to aver that these particular immigrants from  New England, and other northern states are not abolitionists; that  they take no part with, and do not share the fanatical sentiments of,  the abolitionists; that their objects and purposes are of an entirely  different and larger character.    The answer to all this was given in a public document drawn up to voice  the sentiment of a great mass meeting of the people of Clay county--a  people, be it remembered, who at the time (1836) were not unfriendly  towards the Saints, but a people who a few years before had received  the Saints into their homes, and given them shelter when they were  exiles from Jackson county, and who, at the time of the utterance I  am about to quote was published, were in a covenant of peace with the  Saints, and the Saints in a covenant of peace with them--I say the  answer to all disclaimers on the part of the Saints respecting their  not being abolitionists was found in this public utterance: \"They  are eastern men, whose manners, habits, customs and even dialect are  essentially different from our own. They are non-slaveholders, and  opposed to slavery, which in this peculiar period, when abolitionism  has reared its deformed and haggard visage in our land, is well  calculated to excite deep and abiding prejudices in any community where  slavery is tolerated and protected.\"    I call attention to these facts that the student of the history of the  Church may appreciate the weight of influence they would have in {XXIV}  creating popular sentiment against the Saints; a matter which hitherto,  if I may be permitted to say so, has not been fully appreciated. One  can readily see what a potent factor this sentiment against New England  and other northern states people would be in the hands of political  demagogues and sectarian priests seeking to exterminate what they  would respectively consider an undesirable element in politics and a  religious rival. That both political demagogues and sectarian priests  made the most of the opportunity which hostile sentiment in Missouri  against abolition and abolitionists afforded, abundantly appears in the  pages of the first volume of the Church History. That sentiment was  appealed to from the first; indeed in the very first manifesto of the  mob--known as \"The Secret Constitution,\" [6]--issued against the Saints  in Missouri, it was a prominent feature. This was at Independence, in  July, 1833. In that \"Manifesto\" the following passage occurs: \"More  than a year since, it was ascertained that they [the Saints] had been  tampering with our slaves, and endeavoring to sow dissensions and raise  seditions amongst them. Of this their Mormon leaders were informed, and  they said they would deal with any of their members who should again in  like case offend. But how specious are appearances. In a late number of  the _Star_, published in Independence by the leaders of the sect, there  is an article inviting free negroes and mulattoes from other states to  become Mormons, and remove and settle among us. This exhibits them in  still more odious colors. It manifests a desire on the part of their  society, to inflict on our society an injury that they know would be to  us entirely insupportable, and one of the surest means of driving us  from the country; for it would require none of the supernatural gifts  that they pretend to, to see that the introduction of such a caste  amongst us would corrupt our blacks, and instigate them to bloodshed.\"    The article on \"Free People of Color\" referred to appeared in the  _Evening and Morning Star_ for July. The charge of sowing dissensions  and inspiring seditions among the slaves, and inviting free negroes to  settle in Missouri, had no foundation in truth. Concerning such people  the Missouri laws provided that: If any negro or mulatto came into  the state of Missouri, without a certificate from a court of record  in some one of the United States, evidencing that he was a citizen of  such state, on complaint before any justice of the peace, such negro  or mulatto could be commanded by the justice to leave the state; and  if the colored person so ordered did not leave the state within thirty  days, on complaint of any citizen, such person could be again brought  before the justice who might commit him to the common jail of the  county, until {XXV} the convening of the circuit court, when it became  the duty of the judge of the circuit court to inquire into the cause of  commitment; and if it was found that the negro or mulatto had remained  in the state contrary to the provisions of this statute, the court was  authorized to sentence such person to receive ten lashes on his or her  bare back, and then order him or her to depart from the state; if the  person so treated should still refuse to go, then the same proceedings  were to be repeated and punishment inflicted as often as was necessary  until such person departed.    And further: If any person brought into the state of Missouri a free  negro or mulatto, without the aforesaid certificate of citizenship,  for every such negro or mulatto the person offending was liable to a  forfeit of five hundred dollars; to be recovered by action of debt in  the name of the state.    The editor of the _Star_ commenting upon this law said: \"Slaves are  real estate in this and other states, and wisdom would dictate great  care among the branches of the Church of Christ on this subject. So  long as we have no special rule in the Church as to people of color,  let prudence guide; and while they, as well as we, are in the hands of  a merciful God, we say: shun every appearance of evil.\"    Publishing this law and the above comment was construed by the old  settlers to be an"]]]
