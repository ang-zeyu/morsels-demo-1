What an opportunity to indulge her  vixen nature! No matter what occurred to ruffle her, or from what source  provocation came, real or fancied, a few blows on Nig seemed to relieve  her of a portion of ill-will.    These were days when Fido was the entire confidant of Frado. She told  him her griefs as though he were human; and he sat so still, and  listened so attentively, she really believed he knew her sorrows. All  the leisure moments she could gain were used in teaching him some feat  of dog-agility, so that Jack pronounced him very knowing, and was truly  gratified to know he had furnished her with a gift answering his  intentions.    Fido was the constant attendant of Frado, when sent from the house on  errands, going and returning with the cows, out in the fields, to the  village. If ever she forgot her hardships it was in his company.    Spring was now retiring. James, one of the absent sons, was expected  home on a visit. He had never seen the last acquisition to the family.  Jack had written faithfully of all the merits of his colored protege,  and hinted plainly that mother did not always treat her just right. Many  were the preparations to make the visit pleasant, and as the day  approached when he was to arrive, great exertions were made to cook the  favorite viands, to prepare the choicest table-fare.    The morning of the arrival day was a busy one. Frado knew not who would  be of so much importance; her feet were speeding hither and thither so  unsparingly. Mrs. Bellmont seemed a trifle fatigued, and her shoes which  had, early in the morning, a methodic squeak, altered to an irregular,  peevish snap.    \"Get some little wood to make the fire burn,\" said Mrs. Bellmont, in a  sharp tone. Frado obeyed, bringing the smallest she could find.    Mrs. Bellmont approached her, and, giving her a box on her ear,  reiterated the command.    The first the child brought was the smallest to be found; of course, the  second must be a trifle larger. She well knew it was, as she threw it  into a box on the hearth. To Mrs. Bellmont it was a greater affront, as  well as larger wood, so she \"taught her\" with the raw-hide, and sent her  the third time for \"little wood.\"    Nig, weeping, knew not what to do. She had carried the smallest; none  left would suit her mistress; of course further punishment awaited her;  so she gathered up whatever came first, and threw it down on the hearth.  As she expected, Mrs. Bellmont, enraged, approached her, and kicked her  so forcibly as to throw her upon the floor. Before she could rise,  another foiled the attempt, and then followed kick after kick in quick  succession and power, till she reached the door. Mr. Bellmont and Aunt  Abby, hearing the noise, rushed in, just in time to see the last of the  performance. Nig jumped up, and rushed from the house, out of sight.    Aunt Abby returned to her apartment, followed by John, who was muttering  to himself.    \"What were you saying?\" asked Aunt Abby.    \"I said I hoped the child never would come into the house again.\"    \"What would become of her? You cannot mean THAT,\" continued his sister.    \"I do mean it. The child does as much work as a woman ought to; and just  see how she is kicked about!\"    \"Why do you have it so, John?\" asked his sister.    \"How am I to help it? Women rule the earth, and all in it.\"    \"I think I should rule my own house, John,\"--    \"And live in hell meantime,\" added Mr. Bellmont.    John now sauntered out to the barn to await the quieting of the storm.    Aunt Abby had a glimpse of Nig as she passed out of the yard; but to  arrest her, or shew her that SHE would shelter her, in Mrs. Bellmont's  presence, would only bring reserved wrath on her defenceless head. Her  sister-inlaw had great prejudices against her. One cause of the  alienation was that she did not give her right in the homestead to John,  and leave it forever; another was that she was a professor of religion,  (so was Mrs. Bellmont;) but Nab, as she called her, did not live  according to her profession; another, that she WOULD sometimes give Nig  cake and pie, which she was never allowed to have at home. Mary had  often noticed and spoken of her inconsistencies.    The dinner hour passed. Frado had not appeared. Mrs. B. made no inquiry  or search. Aunt Abby looked long, and found her concealed in an  outbuilding. \"Come into the house with me,\" implored Aunt Abby.    \"I ain't going in any more,\" sobbed the child.    \"What will you do?\" asked Aunt Abby.    \"I've got to stay out here and die. I ha'n't got no mother, no home. I  wish I was dead.\"    \"Poor thing,\" muttered Aunt Abby; and slyly providing her with some  dinner, left her to her grief.    Jane went to confer with her Aunt about the affair; and learned from her  the retreat. She would gladly have concealed her in her own chamber, and  ministered to her wants; but she was dependent on Mary and her mother  for care, and any displeasure caused by attention to Nig, was seriously  felt.    Toward night the coach brought James. A time of general greeting,  inquiries for absent members of the family, a visit to Aunt Abby's room,  undoing a few delicacies for Jane, brought them to the tea hour.    \"Where's Frado?\" asked Mr. Bellmont, observing she was not in her usual  place, behind her mistress' chair.    \"I don't know, and I don't care. If she makes her appearance again, I'll  take the skin from her body,\" replied his wife.    James, a fine looking young man, with a pleasant countenance, placid,  and yet decidedly serious, yet not stern, looked up confounded. He was  no stranger to his mother's nature; but years of absence had erased the  occurrences once so familiar, and he asked, \"Is this that pretty little  Nig, Jack writes to me about, that you are so severe upon, mother?\"    \"I'll not leave much of her beauty to be seen, if she comes in sight;  and now, John,\" said Mrs. B., turning to her husband, \"you need not  think you are going to learn her to treat me in this way; just see how  saucy she was this morning. She shall learn her place.\"    Mr. Bellmont raised his calm, determined eye full upon her, and said, in  a decisive manner: \"You shall not strike, or scald, or skin her, as you  call it, if she comes back again. Remember!\" and he brought his hand  down upon the table. \"I have searched an hour for her now, and she is  not to be found on the premises. Do YOU know where she is? Is she YOUR  prisoner?\"    \"No! I have just told you I did not know where she was. Nab has her hid  somewhere, I suppose. Oh, dear! I did not think it would come to this;  that my own husband would treat me so.\" Then came fast flowing tears,  which no one but Mary seemed to notice. Jane crept into Aunt Abby's  room; Mr. Bellmont and James went out of doors, and Mary remained to  condole with her parent.    \"Do you know where Frado is?\" asked Jane of her aunt.    \"No,\" she replied. \"I have hunted everywhere. She has left her first  hiding-place. I cannot think what has become of her. There comes Jack  and Fido; perhaps he knows;\" and she walked to a window near, where  James and his father were conversing together.    The two brothers exchanged a hearty greeting, and then Mr. Bellmont told  Jack to eat his supper; afterward he wished to send him away. He  immediately went in. Accustomed to all the phases of indoor storms, from  a whine to thunder and lightning, he saw at a glance marks of  disturbance. He had been absent through the day, with the hired men.    \"What's the fuss?\" asked he, rushing into Aunt Abby's.    \"Eat your supper,\" said Jane; \"go home, Jack.\"    Back again through the dining-room, and out to his father.    \"What's the fuss?\" again inquired he of his father.    \"Eat your supper, Jack, and see if you can find Frado. She's not been  seen since morning, and then she was kicked out of the house.\"    \"I shan't eat my supper till I find her,\" said Jack, indignantly. \"Come,  James, and see the little creature mother treats so.\"    They started, calling, searching, coaxing, all their way along. No  Frado. They returned to the house to consult. James and Jack declared  they would not sleep till she was found.    Mrs. Bellmont attempted to dissuade them from the search. \"It was a  shame a little NIGGER should make so much trouble.\"    Just then Fido came running up, and Jack exclaimed, \"Fido knows where  she is, I'll bet.\"    \"So I believe,\" said his father; \"but we shall not be wiser unless we  can outwit him. He will not do what his mistress forbids him.\"    \"I know how to fix him,\" said Jack. Taking a plate from the table, which  was still waiting, he called, \"Fido! Fido! Frado wants some supper.  Come!\" Jack started, the dog followed, and soon capered on before, far,  far into the fields, over walls and through fences, into a piece of  swampy land. Jack followed close, and soon appeared to James, who was  quite in the rear, coaxing and forcing Frado along with him.    A frail child, driven from shelter by the cruelty of his mother, was an  object of interest to James. They persuaded her to go home with them,  warmed her by the kitchen fire, gave her a good supper, and took her  with them into the sitting-room.    \"Take that nigger out of my sight,\" was Mrs. Bellmont's command, before  they could be seated.    James led her into Aunt Abby's, where he knew they were welcome. They  chatted awhile until Frado seemed cheerful; then James led her to her  room, and waited until she retired.    \"Are you glad I've come home?\" asked James.    \"Yes; if you won't let me be whipped tomorrow.\"    \"You won't be whipped. You must try to be a good girl,\" counselled  James.    \"If I do, I get whipped,\" sobbed the child. \"They won't believe what I  say. Oh, I wish I had my mother back; then I should not be kicked and  whipped so. Who made me so?\"    \"God,\" answered James.    \"Did God make you?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Who made Aunt Abby?\"    \"God.\"    \"Who made your mother?\"    \"God.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5844"],[0,"The Adventures of Johnny Chuck (#5)"],[1,"grass. Then Johnny Chuck  would try to make himself look very important, and would strut about as  if he really did own the Green Meadows.    Sometimes she would hide from him, and when he found her she would run  away. Other times she would be just as nice to him as she could be, and  they would have a jolly time hunting for sweet clover and other nice  things to eat. Then Johnny Chuck's heart would swell until it seemed to  him that it would fairly burst with happiness.    Instead of wanting to drive Polly Chuck away from the Green Meadows,  as he had the old gray Chuck, Johnny began to worry for fear that Polly  Chuck might not stay on the Green Meadows. Whenever he thought of that,  his heart would sink way, way down, and he would hurry to look for her  and make sure that she was still there.    When he was beside her, he felt very big and strong and brave and longed  for a chance to show her how brave he was. She was such a timid little  thing herself that the least little thing frightened her, and Johnny  Chuck was glad that this was so, for it gave him a chance to protect  her.    When he wasn't with her, he spent his time looking for new patches of  sweet clover to take her to. At first she wouldn't go without a great  deal of coaxing, but after a while he didn't have to coax at all. She  seemed to delight to be with him as much as he did to be with her.    So Johnny Chuck grew happier and happier. He was happier than he had  ever been in all his life before. You see Johnny Chuck had found the  greatest thing in the world. Do you know what it is? It is called love.          XII. JOHNNY CHUCK PROVES HIS LOVE      These spring days were beautiful days on the Green Meadows. It seemed  to Johnny Chuck that the Green Meadows never had been so lovely or the  songs of the birds so sweet. He had forgotten all about his old friends,  Jimmy Skunk and Peter Rabbit and the other little meadow people.    You see, he couldn't think of anybody but Polly Chuck, and he didn't  want to be with anybody but Polly Chuck. He had even forgotten that he  had started out to see the world. He didn't care anything more about  the world. All he wanted was to be where Polly Chuck was. Then he was  perfectly happy. That was because Johnny Chuck had found the greatest  thing in the world, which is love. But Johnny still had one great wish,  the wish that he might show Polly Chuck just how brave and strong he was  and how well he could take care of her.    One morning they were feasting in a patch of sweet clover over near an  old stone wall. It was the same stone wall in which Johnny Chuck had  escaped from old Whitetail the Marshhawk, when Johnny was a very little  fellow.    Suddenly Polly gave a little scream of fright. Johnny Chuck looked up to  see a dog almost upon her. Johnny's first thought was to run to the old  stone wall. He was nearer to it than Polly was. Then he saw that that  dreadful dog would catch Polly before she could reach the stone wall.    A great rage filled Johnny's heart, just as it had when he had fought  the old gray Chuck. Every hair stood on end, not with fear, but with  anger, and he sprang in front of Polly.    \"Run, Polly, run!\" he cried, and Polly ran.    But Johnny didn't run. Oh, my, no! Johnny didn't run. He drew himself  together ready to spring. He showed all his sharp teeth and ground them  savagely. Little sparks of fire seemed to snap out of his eyes. There  was no sign of fear in Johnny Chuck then, not the least little bit. Just  in front of him the dog stopped and barked. He was a little dog, a young  and foolish dog, and he was terribly excited. He barked until he almost  lost his breath. He didn't like the looks of Johnny Chuck's sharp teeth.  So he circled around Johnny, trying to get behind him. But Johnny turned  as the dog circled, and always the little dog found those sharp teeth  directly in front of him. He barked and barked, until it seemed as if he  would bark his head off.    Finally the little dog, who was young and foolish, grew tired of just  dancing around and barking. \"Pooh!\" said he to himself. \"He's nothing  but a Chuck!\" Then he stopped barking and sprang straight at Johnny with  an ugly growl.    Johnny Chuck was ready for him and he was quicker than the little dog.  His sharp teeth closed on one of the little dog's ears, and he held on  while with his stout claws he scratched and tore.    The little dog, who was young and foolish and hadn't yet learned how  to fight, couldn't get hold of Johnny Chuck anywhere. Then he tried to  shake Johnny Chuck off, but he couldn't, because Johnny held on to that  ear with his sharp teeth.    \"Kiyi-yi-yi-yi!\" yelled the little dog, for those teeth hurt dreadfully.  \"Kiyi-yi-yi-yi!\"    Over and over they rolled and tumbled, the little dog trying to get  away, and Johnny Chuck holding on to the little dog's ear. Finally  Johnny had to let go to get his breath. The little dog sprang to his  feet and started for home across the Green Meadows as fast as he could  run.    Johnny Chuck shook himself and grinned, as he heard the little dog's  \"Kiyi-yi-yi\" grow fainter and fainter. \"I'm glad it wasn't Bowser the  Hound,\" muttered Johnny Chuck, as he started towards the old stone wall.  There he found Polly Chuck peeping out at him, and all of a tremble with  fright.    \"My, how brave you are!\" said Polly Chuck.    \"Pooh, that's nothing!\" replied Johnny Chuck.          XIII. POLLY AND JOHNNY CHUCK GO HOUSE HUNTING      Johnny Chuck was happy. Yes, Sir, Johnny Chuck was happy--so happy that  he felt like doing foolish things. You see Johnny Chuck loved Polly  Chuck and he knew now that Polly Chuck loved him. He had known it  ever since he had fought with the foolish little dog who had dared to  frighten Polly Chuck.    After the fight was over, and the little dog had been sent home  kiyi-yi-ing, Polly Chuck had crept out of the old stone wall where she  had been hiding and snuggled up beside Johnny Chuck and looked at him  as if she thought him the most wonderful Chuck in all the world, as,  indeed, she did. And Johnny had felt his heart swell and swell with  happiness until it almost choked him.    So now once more Johnny Chuck began to think of a new home. He had  forgotten all about seeing the world. All he wanted now was a new house,  built just so, with a front door and a hidden back door, and big enough  for two, for no more would Johnny Chuck live alone. So, with shy little  Polly Chuck by his side, he began to search for a place to make a new  home.    The more he thought about it, the more Johnny wanted to build his house  over by the lone elm-tree where he had first seen Polly Chuck. It was a  splendid place. From it you could see a great way in every direction.  It would be shady on hot summer days. It was near a great big patch of  sweet clover. It seemed to Johnny Chuck that it was the best place on  all the Green Meadows. He whispered as much to Polly Chuck. She turned  up her nose.    \"It's too low!\" said she.    \"Oh!\" replied Johnny, and looked puzzled, for really it was one of the  highest places on the Green Meadows.    \"Yes,\" said Polly, in a brisk, decided way, \"it's altogether too low.  Probably it is wet.\"    \"Oh!\" said Johnny once more. Of course he knew that it wasn't wet, but  if Polly didn't want to live there, he wouldn't say a word. Of course  not.    \"Now there's a place right over there,\" continued Polly. \"I think we'll  build our house right there.\"    Johnny opened his mouth to say something, but he closed it again without  speaking and meekly trotted after Polly Chuck to the place she had  picked out. It was in a little hollow. Johnny knew before he began to  dig that the ground was damp, almost wet. But if Polly wanted to live  there she should, and Johnny began to dig. By and by he stopped to rest.  Where was Polly? He looked this way and that way anxiously. Just as he  was getting ready to go hunt for her, she came hurrying back.    {Illustration: If Polly wanted to live there she should}    \"I've found a perfectly lovely place for our new home!\" she cried.    Johnny looked ruefully at the hole he had worked so hard to dig; then he  brushed the dirt from his clothes and followed her. This time Johnny  had no fault to find with the ground. It was high and dry. But Polly had  chosen a spot close to a road that wound down across the Green Meadows.  Johnny shook his head doubtfully, but he began to dig. This time,  however, he kept one eye on Polly Chuck, and the minute he found that  she was wandering off, he stopped digging and chuckled as he watched  her. It wasn't long before back she came in great excitement. She had  found a better place!    So they wandered over the Green Meadows, Polly leading the way. Johnny  had learned by this time to waste no time digging. And he had made up  his mind to one thing. What do you think it was? It was this: He would  follow Polly until she found a place to suit him, but when she did find  such a place she shouldn't have a chance to change her mind again.          XIV. A NEW HOME AT LAST           Home, no matter where it be,       Or it be big or small,       Is just the one place in the world       That dearest is of all.    Johnny Chuck was thinking of this as he worked with might and main. It  was a new house that he was building, but already he felt that it was  home, and every time he thought of it he felt a queer little tugging at  his heart. You see, while it was his home, it was Polly Chuck's home,  too, and that made it doubly dear to Johnny Chuck, even before it was  finished.    And where do you think Johnny was building his new home? It was clear  way over on the edge of Farmer Brown's old orchard! Yes, Sir, after all  the fuss Johnny Chuck had made over any other Chuck living on the Green  Meadows, and after driving the old gray Chuck back to the Old Pasture,  Johnny Chuck had left the Green Meadows himself!    It wasn't of his own accord that Johnny"]]]
