(Without  doubt, but the door is shut.) I have heard of this remembering of previous  existences among my people. It is of course an old tale with us, but, to  happen to an Englishman--a cow-fed _Malechh_--an outcast. By Jove, that is  most peculiar!\"    \"Outcast yourself, Grish Chunder! You eat cow-beef every day. Let's think  the thing over. The boy remembers his incarnations.\"    \"Does he know that?\" said Grish Chunder, quietly, swinging his legs as he  sat on my table. He was speaking in English now.    \"He does not know anything. Would I speak to you if he did? Go on!\"    \"There is no going on at all. If you tell that to your friends they will  say you are mad and put it in the papers. Suppose, now, you prosecute for  libel.\"    \"Let's leave that out of the question entirely. Is there any chance of his  being made to speak?\"    \"There is a chance. Oah, yess! But _if_ he spoke it would mean that all  this world would end now--_instanto_--fall down on your head. These things  are not allowed, you know. As I said, the door is shut.\"    \"Not a ghost of a chance?\"    \"How can there be? You are a Christian, and it is forbidden to eat, in  your books, of the Tree of Life, or else you would never die. How shall  you all fear death if you all know what your friend does not know that he  knows? I am afraid to be kicked, but I am not afraid to die, because I  know what I know. You are not afraid to be kicked, but you are afraid to  die. If you were not, by God! you English would be all over the shop in an  hour, upsetting the balances of power, and making commotions. It would not  be good. But no fear. He will remember a little and a little less, and he  will call it dreams. Then he will forget altogether. When I passed my  First Arts Examination in Calcutta that was all in the cram-book on  Wordsworth. Trailing clouds of glory, you know.\"    \"This seems to be an exception to the rule.\"    \"There are no exceptions to rules. Some are not so hard-looking as others,  but they are all the same when you touch. If this friend of yours said  so-and-so and so-and-so, indicating that he remembered all his lost lives,  or one piece of a lost life, he would not be in the bank another hour. He  would be what you called sack because he was mad, and they would send him  to an asylum for lunatics. You can see that, my friend.\"    \"Of course I can, but I wasn't thinking of him. His name need never appear  in the story,\"    \"Ah! I see. That story will never be written. You can try,\"    \"I am going to.\"    \"For your own credit and for the sake of money, _of_ course?\"    \"No. For the sake of writing the story. On my honor that will be all.\"    \"Even then there is no chance. You cannot play with the Gods. It is a very  pretty story now. As they say, Let it go on that--I mean at that. Be  quick; he will not last long.\"    \"How do you mean?\"    \"What I say. He has never, so far, thought about a woman.\"    \"Hasn't he, though!\" I remembered some of Charlie's confidences.    \"I mean no woman has thought about him. When that comes;  _bus_--_hogya_--all up! I know. There are millions of women here.  Housemaids, for instance.\"    I winced at the thought of my story being ruined by a housemaid. And yet  nothing was more probable.    Grish Chunder grinned.    \"Yes--also pretty girls--cousins of his house, and perhaps _not_ of his  house. One kiss that he gives back again and remembers will cure all this  nonsense, or else\"--    \"Or else what? Remember he does not know that he knows.\"    \"I know that. Or else, if nothing happens he will become immersed in the  trade and the financial speculations like the rest. It must be so. You can  see that it must be so. But the woman will come first, _I_ think.\"    There was a rap at the door, and Charlie charged in impetuously. He had  been released from office, and by the look in his eyes I could see that he  had come over for a long talk; most probably with poems in his pockets.  Charlie's poems were very wearying, but sometimes they led him to talk  about the galley.    Grish Chunder looked at him keenly for a minute.    \"I beg your pardon,\" Charlie said, uneasily; \"I didn't know you had any  one with you.\"    \"I am going,\" said Grish Chunder,    He drew me into the lobby as he departed.    \"That is your man,\" he said, quickly. \"I tell you he will never speak all  you wish. That is rot--bosh. But he would be most good to make to see  things. Suppose now we pretend that it was only play\"--I had never seen  Grish Chunder so excited--\"and pour the ink-pool into his hand. Eh, what  do you think? I tell you that he could see _anything_ that a man could  see. Let me get the ink and the camphor. He is a seer and he will tell us  very many things.\"    \"He may be all you say, but I'm not going to trust him to your gods and  devils.\"    \"It will not hurt him. He will only feel a little stupid and dull when he  wakes up. You have seen boys look into the ink-pool before.\"    \"That is the reason why I am not going to see it any more. You'd better  go, Grish Chunder.\"    He went, declaring far down the staircase that it was throwing away my  only chance of looking into the future.    This left me unmoved, for I was concerned for the past, and no peering of  hypnotized boys into mirrors and ink-pools would help me to that. But I  recognized Grish Chunder's point of view and sympathized with it.    \"What a big black brute that was!\" said Charlie, when I returned to him.  \"Well, look here, I've just done a poem; did it instead of playing  dominoes after lunch. May I read it?\"    \"Let me read it to myself.\"    \"Then you miss the proper expression. Besides, you always make my things  sound as if the rhymes were all wrong.\"    \"Read it aloud, then. You're like the rest of 'em.\"    Charlie mouthed me his poem, and it was not much worse than the average of  his verses. He had been reading his books faithfully, but he was not  pleased when I told him that I preferred my Longfellow undiluted with  Charlie.    Then we began to go through the MS. line by line; Charlie parrying every  objection and correction with:    \"Yes, that may be better, but you don't catch what I'm driving at.\"    Charles was, in one way at least, very like one kind of poet.    There was a pencil scrawl at the back of the paper and \"What's that?\" I  said.    \"Oh that's not poetry at all. It's some rot I wrote last night before I  went to bed and it was too much bother to hunt for rhymes; so I made it a  sort of blank verse instead.\"    Here is Charlie's \"blank verse\":       \"We pulled for you when the wind was against us and the sails were low.    _Will you never let us go?_       We ate bread and onions when you took towns or ran aboard quickly when  you were beaten back by the foe,     The captains walked up and down the deck in fair weather singing songs,  but we were below,     We fainted with our chins on the oars and you did not see that we were  idle for we still swung to and fro.    _Will you never let us go?_      The salt made the oar bandies like sharkskin; our knees were cut to the  bone with salt cracks; our hair was stuck to our foreheads; and our lips  were cut to our gums and you whipped us because we could not row,    _Will you never let us go?_      But in a little time we shall run out of the portholes as the water runs  along the oarblade, and though you tell the others to row after us you  will never catch us till you catch the oar-thresh and tie up the winds in  the belly of the sail. Aho!    _Will you never let us go?_\"    \"H'm. What's oar-thresh, Charlie?\"    \"The water washed up by the oars. That's the sort of song they might sing  in the galley, y'know. Aren't you ever going to finish that story and give  me some of the profits?\"    \"It depends on yourself. If you had only told me more about your hero in  the first instance it might have been finished by now. You're so hazy in  your notions.\"    \"I only want to give you the general notion of it--the knocking about from  place to place and the fighting and all that. Can't you fill in the rest  yourself? Make the hero save a girl on a pirate-galley and marry her or do  something.\"    \"You're a really helpful collaborator. I suppose the hero went through  some few adventures before he married.\"    \"Well then, make him a very artful card--a low sort of man--a sort of  political man who went about making treaties and breaking them--a  black-haired chap who hid behind the mast when the fighting began.\"    \"But you said the other day that he was red-haired.\"    \"I couldn't have. Make him black-haired of course. You've no imagination.\"    Seeing that I had just discovered the entire principles upon which the  half-memory falsely called imagination is based, I felt entitled to laugh,  but forbore, for the sake of the tale.    \"You're right _You're_ the man with imagination. A black-haired chap in a  decked ship,\" I said.    \"No, an open ship--like a big boat.\"    This was maddening.    \"Your ship has been built and designed, closed and decked in; you said so  yourself,\" I protested.    \"No, no, not that ship. That was open, or half decked because--By Jove  you're right You made me think of the hero as a red-haired chap. Of course  if he were red, the ship would be an open one with painted sails,\"    Surely, I thought, he would remember now that he had served in two galleys  at least--in a three-decked Greek one under the black-haired \"political  man,\" and again in a Viking's open sea-serpent under the man \"red as a red  bear\" who went to Markland. The devil prompted me to speak.    \"Why, 'of course,' Charlie?\" said I.    \"I don't know. Are you making fun of me?\"    The current was broken for the time being. I took up a notebook and  pretended to make many entries in it.    \"It's a pleasure to work with an imaginative chap like yourself,\" I said,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8659"],[0,"Sabbath in Puritan New England (#5)"],[1,"man he met  what the signall of the drum ment; the reply was made they had as yet no  Bell to call men to meeting and therefore made use of the drum.\" In 1638  a platform was made upon the top of the Windsor meeting-house \"from the  Lanthornc to the ridge to walk conveniently to sound a trumpet or a drum to  give warning to meeting.\"    Sometimes three guns were fired as a signal for \"church-time.\" The signal  for religious gathering, and the signal for battle were always markedly  different, in order to avoid unnecessary fright.    In 1647 Robert Basset was appointed in New Haven to drum \"twice upon Lordes  Dayes and Lecture Dayes upon the meeting house that soe those who live farr  off may heare the more distinkly.\" Robert may have been a good drummer, but  he proved to be a most reprehensible and disreputable citizen; in the local  Court Records of August 1, 1648, we find a full report of an astounding  occurrence in which he played an important part. Ten men, who Avere nearly  all sea-faring men,--gay, rollicking sailors,--went to Bassctt's house and  asked for strong drink. The magistrates had endeavored zealously, and in  the main successfully, to prevent all intoxication in the community,  and had forbidden the sale of liquor save in very small quantities. The  church-drummer, however, wickedly unmindful of his honored calling,  furnished to the sailors six quarts of strong liquor, with which they all,  host and visitors, got prodigiously drunk and correspondingly noisy. The  Court Record says: \"The miscarriage continued till betwixt tenn and eleven  of the clock, to the great provocation of God, disturbance of the peace,  and to such a height of disorder that strangers wondered at it.\" In the  midst of the carousal the master of the pinnace called the boatswain  \"Brother Loggerheads.\" This must have been a particularly insulting  epithet, which no respectable boatswain could have been expected quietly to  endure, for \"at once the two men fell fast to wrestling, then to blowes and  theirin grew to that feircnes that the master of the pinnace thought the  boatswain would have puled out his eies; and they toumbled on the ground  down the hill into the creeke and mire shamefully wallowing theirin.\"  In his pain and terror the master called out, \"Hoe, the Watch! Hoe, the  Watch!\" \"The Watch made hast and for the present stopped the disorder, but  in his rage and distemper the boatswaine fell a-swearinge Wounds and Hart  as if he were not only angry with men but would provoke the high  and blessed God.\" The master of the pinnace, being freed from his  fellow-combatant, returned to Basset's house--perhaps to tell his tale  of woe, perhaps to get more liquor--and was assailed by the drummer with  amazing words of \"anger and distemper used by drunken companions;\" in  short, he was \"verey offensive, his noyes and oathes being hearde to  the other side of the creeke.\" For aiding and abetting this noisy and  disgraceful spree, and also for partaking in it, Drummer Basset was fined  L5, which must have been more than his yearly salary, and in disgrace, and  possibly in disgust, quitted drumming the New Haven good people to meeting  and moved his residence to Stamford, doubtless to the relief and delight of  both magistrates and people of the former town.    Another means of notification of the hour for religious service was by the  use of a flag, often in addition to the sound of the drum or bell. Thus in  Plymouth, in 1697, the selectmen were ordered to \"procure a flagg to be put  out at the ringing of the first bell, and taken in when the last bell was  rung.\" In Sutherland also a flag was used as a means of announcement of  \"meeting-time,\" and an old goody was paid ten shillings a year for \"tending  the flagg.\"    Mr. Gosse, in his \"Early Bells of Massachusetts,\" gives a full and  interesting account of the church-bells of the first colonial towns in that  State. Lechford, in his \"Plaine Dealing,\" wrote in 1641 that they came  together in Boston on the Lord's Day by \"the wringing of a bell,\" and it is  thought that that bell was a hand-bell. The first bells, for the lack  of bell-towers, were sometimes hung on trees by the side of the  meeting-houses, to the great amazement and distress of the Indians, who  regarded them with superstitious dread, thinking--to paraphrase Herbert's  beautiful line--\"when the bell did chime 't was devils' music;\" but more  frequently the bells were hung in a belfry or bell-turret or \"bellcony,\"  and from this belfry depended a long bell-rope quite to the floor; and thus  in the very centre of the church the sexton stood when he rung the summons  for lire or for meeting. This rope was of course directly in front of the  pulpit; and Jonathan Edwards, who was devoid of gestures and looked always  straight before him when preaching, was jokingly said to have \"looked-off\"  the bell-rope, when it fell with a crash in the middle of his church.    At the first sound of the drum or horn or bell the town inhabitants issued  from their houses in \"desent order,\" man and wife walking first, and the  children in quiet procession after them. Often a man-servant and a maid  walked on either side of the heads of the family. In some communities the  congregation waited outside the church door until the minister and his wife  arrived and passed into the house; then the church-attendants followed, the  loitering boys always contriving to scuffle noisily in from the horse-sheds  at the last moment, making much scraping and clatter with their heavy boots  on the sanded floor, and tumbling clumsily up the uucarpeted, creaking  stairs.    In other churches the members of the congregation seated themselves in  their pews upon their arrival, but rose reverently when the parson, dressed  in black skull-cap and Geneva cloak, entered the door; and they stood, in  token of respect, until after he entered the pulpit and was seated.    It was also the honor-giving and deferential custom in many New England  churches, in the eighteenth century, for the entire congregation to remain  respectfully standing within the pews at the end of the serice until the  minister had descended from his lofty pulpit, opened the door of his wife's  pew, and led her with stately dignity to the church-porch, where, were he  and she genial and neighborly minded souls, they in turn stood and greeted  with carefully adjusted degrees of warmth, interest, respect, or patronage,  the different members of the congregation as they slowly passed out.          IV.    The Old-Fashioned Pews.        In the early New England meeting-houses the seats were long, narrow,  uncomfortable benches, which were made of simple, rough, hand-riven planks  placed on legs like milking-stools. They were without any support or rest  for the back; and perhaps the stiff-backed Pilgrims and Puritans required  or wished no support. Quickly, as the colonies grew in wealth and the  colonists in ambition and importance, \"Spots for Pues\" were sold (or  \"pitts\" as they were sometimes called), at first to some few rich or  influential men who wished to sit in a group together, and finally each  family of dignity or wealth sat in its own family-pew. Often it was  stipulated in the permission to build a pew that a separate entrance-door  should be cut into it through the outside wall of the meeting-house, thus  detracting grievously from the external symmetry of the edifice, but  obviating the necessity of a space-occupying entrance aisle within the  church, where there was little enough sitting-room for the quickly  increasing and universally church-going population. As these pews were  either oblong or square, were both large and small, painted and unpainted,  and as each pewholder could exercise his own \"tast or disresing\" in the  kind of wood he used in the formation of his pew, as well as in the style  of finish, much diversity and incongruity of course resulted. A man who had  a wainscoted pew was naturally and properly much respected and envied by  the entire community. These pews, erected by individual members, were  individual and not communal property. A widow in Cape Cod had her house  destroyed by fire. She was given from the old meeting-house, which was  being razed, the old building materials to use in the construction of her  new home. She was not allowed, however, to remove the wood which formed the  pews, as they were adjudged to be the property of the members who had built  them, and those owners only could sell or remove the materials of which  they were built.    Many of the pews in the old meeting-houses had towering partition walls,  which extended up so high that only the tops of the tallest heads could be  seen when the occupants were seated. Permissions to build were often given  with modifying restrictions to the aspiring pew-builders, as for instance  is recorded of the Haverhill church, \"provided they would not build so high  as to damnify and hinder the light of them windows,\" or of the Waterbury  church, \"if the pues will not progodish the hous.\" Often the floor of the  pews was several inches and occasionally a foot higher than the floor of  the \"alleys,\" thus forming at the entrance-door of the pew one or two  steps, which were great stumbling-blocks to clumsy and to childish feet,  that tripped again when within the pew over the \"crickets\" and foot-benches  which were, if the family were large, the accepted and lowly church-seats  of the little children. Occasionally one long, low foot-rest stretched  quite across one side of the pew-floor. I have seen these long benches  with a tier of three shelves; the lower and broader shelf was used as a  foot-rest, the second one was to hold the hats of the men, and the third  and narrower shelf was for the hymn-books and Bibles. Such comfortable and  luxurious pew-furnishings could never have been found in many churches.    An old New Englander relates a funny story of his youth, in which one"]]]
