These details of assays have ceased to interest me: like the man  who \"didn't believe in ghosts,\" I have seen too many of them.    The fresh-faced little curate and his wife, however, were quite  different people. He was a cricketing Oxford man; she was a breezy  Scotch lass, with a wholesome breath of the Highlands about her. I  called her \"White Heather.\" Their name was Brabazon. Millionaires  are so accustomed to being beset by harpies of every description,  that when they come across a young couple who are simple and  natural, they delight in the purely human relation. We picnicked  and went excursions a great deal with the honeymooners. They were  so frank in their young love, and so proof against chaff, that we  all really liked them. But whenever I called the pretty girl \"White  Heather,\" she looked so shocked, and cried: \"Oh, Mr. Wentworth!\"  Still, we were the best of friends. The curate offered to row us in  a boat on the lake one day, while the Scotch lassie assured us she  could take an oar almost as well as he did. However, we did not  accept their offer, as row-boats exert an unfavourable influence  upon Amelia's digestive organs.    \"Nice young fellow, that man Brabazon,\" Sir Charles said to me one  day, as we lounged together along the quay; \"never talks about  advowsons or next presentations. Doesn't seem to me to care two pins  about promotion. Says he's quite content in his country curacy;  enough to live upon, and needs no more; and his wife has a little, a  very little, money. I asked him about his poor to-day, on purpose to  test him: these parsons are always trying to screw something out of  one for their poor; men in my position know the truth of the saying  that we have that class of the population always with us. Would  you believe it, he says he hasn't any poor at all in his parish!  They're all well-to-do farmers or else able-bodied labourers, and  his one terror is that somebody will come and try to pauperise them.  'If a philanthropist were to give me fifty pounds to-day for use at  Empingham,' he said, 'I assure you, Sir Charles, I shouldn't know  what to do with it. I think I should buy new dresses for Jessie, who  wants them about as much as anybody else in the village--that is to  say, not at all.' There's a parson for you, Sey, my boy. Only wish  we had one of his sort at Seldon.\"    \"He certainly doesn't want to get anything out of you,\" I answered.    That evening at dinner a queer little episode happened. The man  with the eyebrows began talking to me across the table in his usual  fashion, full of his wearisome concession on the Upper Amazons. I  was trying to squash him as politely as possible, when I caught  Amelia's eye. Her look amused me. She was engaged in making signals  to Charles at her side to observe the little curate's curious  sleeve-links. I glanced at them, and saw at once they were a  singular possession for so unobtrusive a person. They consisted  each of a short gold bar for one arm of the link, fastened by a  tiny chain of the same material to what seemed to my tolerably  experienced eye--a first-rate diamond. Pretty big diamonds, too,  and of remarkable shape, brilliancy, and cutting. In a moment I  knew what Amelia meant. She owned a diamond riviere, said to be  of Indian origin, but short by two stones for the circumference  of her tolerably ample neck. Now, she had long been wanting two  diamonds like these to match her set; but owing to the unusual  shape and antiquated cutting of her own gems, she had never  been able to complete the necklet, at least without removing an  extravagant amount from a much larger stone of the first water.    The Scotch lassie's eyes caught Amelia's at the same time, and she  broke into a pretty smile of good-humoured amusement. \"Taken in  another person, Dick, dear!\" she exclaimed, in her breezy way,  turning to her husband. \"Lady Vandrift is observing your diamond  sleeve-links.\"    \"They're very fine gems,\" Amelia observed incautiously. (A most  unwise admission if she desired to buy them.)    But the pleasant little curate was too transparently simple a soul  to take advantage of her slip of judgment. \"They _are_ good stones,\"  he replied; \"very good stones--considering. They're not diamonds  at all, to tell you the truth. They're best old-fashioned Oriental  paste. My great-grandfather bought them, after the siege of  Seringapatam, for a few rupees, from a Sepoy who had looted them  from Tippoo Sultan's palace. He thought, like you, he had got a good  thing. But it turned out, when they came to be examined by experts,  they were only paste--very wonderful paste; it is supposed they had  even imposed upon Tippoo himself, so fine is the imitation. But they  are worth--well, say, fifty shillings at the utmost.\"    While he spoke Charles looked at Amelia, and Amelia looked at  Charles. Their eyes spoke volumes. The riviere was also supposed to  have come from Tippoo's collection. Both drew at once an identical  conclusion. These were two of the same stones, very likely torn  apart and disengaged from the rest in the melee at the capture of  the Indian palace.    \"Can you take them off?\" Sir Charles asked blandly. He spoke in  the tone that indicates business.    \"Certainly,\" the little curate answered, smiling. \"I'm accustomed to  taking them off. They're always noticed. They've been kept in the  family ever since the siege, as a sort of valueless heirloom, for  the sake of the picturesqueness of the story, you know; and nobody  ever sees them without asking, as you do, to examine them closely.  They deceive even experts at first. But they're paste, all the same;  unmitigated Oriental paste, for all that.\"    He took them both off, and handed them to Charles. No man in England  is a finer judge of gems than my brother-in-law. I watched him  narrowly. He examined them close, first with the naked eye, then  with the little pocket-lens which he always carries. \"Admirable  imitation,\" he muttered, passing them on to Amelia. \"I'm not  surprised they should impose upon inexperienced observers.\"    But from the tone in which he said it, I could see at once he had  satisfied himself they were real gems of unusual value. I know  Charles's way of doing business so well. His glance to Amelia meant,  \"These are the very stones you have so long been in search of.\"    The Scotch lassie laughed a merry laugh. \"He sees through them  now, Dick,\" she cried. \"I felt sure Sir Charles would be a judge  of diamonds.\"    Amelia turned them over. I know Amelia, too; and I knew from the  way Amelia looked at them that she meant to have them. And when  Amelia means to have anything, people who stand in the way may just  as well spare themselves the trouble of opposing her.    They were beautiful diamonds. We found out afterwards the little  curate's account was quite correct: these stones _had_ come from  the same necklet as Amelia's riviere, made for a favourite wife of  Tippoo's, who had presumably as expansive personal charms as our  beloved sister-in-law's. More perfect diamonds have seldom been  seen. They have excited the universal admiration of thieves and  connoisseurs. Amelia told me afterwards that, according to legend,  a Sepoy stole the necklet at the sack of the palace, and then fought  with another for it. It was believed that two stones got spilt  in the scuffle, and were picked up and sold by a third person--a  looker-on--who had no idea of the value of his booty. Amelia had  been hunting for them for several years to complete her necklet.    \"They are excellent paste,\" Sir Charles observed, handing them back.  \"It takes a first-rate judge to detect them from the reality. Lady  Vandrift has a necklet much the same in character, but composed  of genuine stones; and as these are so much like them, and would  complete her set, to all outer appearance, I wouldn't mind giving  you, say, 10 pounds for the pair of them.\"    Mrs. Brabazon looked delighted. \"Oh, sell them to him, Dick,\" she  cried, \"and buy me a brooch with the money! A pair of common  links would do for you just as well. Ten pounds for two paste  stones! It's quite a lot of money.\"    She said it so sweetly, with her pretty Scotch accent, that I  couldn't imagine how Dick had the heart to refuse her. But he  did, all the same.    \"No, Jess, darling,\" he answered. \"They're worthless, I know; but  they have for me a certain sentimental value, as I've often told  you. My dear mother wore them, while she lived, as ear-rings; and  as soon as she died I had them set as links in order that I might  always keep them about me. Besides, they have historical and family  interest. Even a worthless heirloom, after all, _is_ an heirloom.\"    Dr. Hector Macpherson looked across and intervened. \"There is a  part of my concession,\" he said, \"where we have reason to believe a  perfect new Kimberley will soon be discovered. If at any time you  would care, Sir Charles, to look at my diamonds--when I get them--it  would afford me the greatest pleasure in life to submit them to your  consideration.\"    Sir Charles could stand it no longer. \"Sir,\" he said, gazing across  at him with his sternest air, \"if your concession were as full of  diamonds as Sindbad the Sailor's valley, I would not care to turn my  head to look at them. I am acquainted with the nature and practice  of salting.\" And he glared at the man with the overhanging eyebrows  as if he would devour him raw. Poor Dr. Hector Macpherson subsided  instantly. We learnt a little later that he was a harmless lunatic,  who went about the world with successive concessions for ruby mines  and platinum reefs, because he had been ruined and driven mad by  speculations in the two, and now recouped himself by imaginary  grants in Burmah and Brazil, or anywhere else that turned up handy.  And his eyebrows, after all, were of"]]]
