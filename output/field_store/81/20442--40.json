The leaders were exhorted to justice and to avoid  any oppression of the conquered; the soldiers were forbidden all acts of  violence, and the favourite vices of armies were prohibited,--too much  drinking, we are told, lest it should lead to bloodshed. Judges were  appointed to deal with the offences of the soldiers; the Norman members  of the force were allowed no special privileges; and the control of law  over the army, says the king's chaplain, proudly, was made as strict as  the control of the army over the subject race. Attention was given also  to the fiscal system of the country, to the punishment of criminals, and  to the protection of commerce. Most of this we may well believe, though  some details of fact as well as of motive may be too highly coloured, for  our knowledge of William's attitude towards matters of this kind is not  dependent on the words of any panegyrist.    While William waited at Barking, other English lords in addition to those  who had already acknowledged him came in and made submission. The Norman  authorities say that the earls Edwin and Morcar were the chief of these,  and if not earlier, they must have submitted then. Two men, Siward and  Eldred, are said to have been relatives of the last Saxon king, but in  what way we do not know. Copsi, who had ruled Northumberland for a time  under Tostig, the brother of Harold, impressed the Norman writers with  his importance, and a Thurkill is also mentioned by name, while \"many  other nobles\" are classed together without special mention. Another great  name which should probably be added to this list is that of Waltheof,  Earl of Northampton and Huntingdon, of distinguished descent and destined  later to an unhappy fate. All of these the king received most kindly. He  accepted their oaths, restored to them all their possessions, and held  them in great honour.    But certainly not in all cases did things go so easily for the English.  Two bits of evidence, one in the Saxon Chronicle, that men bought their  lands of the king, and one in Domesday Book, a statement of the  condition of a piece of land \"at the time when the English redeemed their  lands,\" lead us to infer that William demanded of the English that they  obtain from him in form a confirmation of their possessions for which  they were obliged to pay a price. No statement is made of the reasons by  which this demand was justified, but the temptation to regard it as an  application of the principle of the feudal relief is almost irresistible;  of the relief paid on the succession of a new lord, instead of the  ordinary relief paid on the recognition of the heir to the fief. If the  evidence were greater that this was a common practice in feudalism rather  than an occasional one, as it seems only to have been, it would give us  the simplest and most natural explanation of this act of William's. To  consider that he regarded all the land of the kingdom as rightly  confiscate, which has been suggested as an explanation, because of a  resistance which in many cases never occurred, and in most had not at the  time when this regulation must have been made, is a forced and unnatural  theory, and not in harmony with William's usual methods. To suppose that  he regarded this as an exceptional case, in which a relief on a change of  lords could be collected, is a less violent supposition. Possibly it was  an application more general than ordinary of the practice which was usual  throughout the medieval world of obtaining at a price, from a new king,  confirmations of the important grants of his predecessors. But any  explanation of the ground of right on which the king demanded this  general redemption of lands must remain from lack of evidence a mere  conjecture. The fact itself seems beyond question, and is an indication  of no little value of the views and intentions of the new king. The  kingdom was his; all the land must be held of him and with his formal  consent, but no uncalled-for disturbance of possession was to occur.    Beyond reasonable doubt at this time was begun that policy of actual  confiscation, where reasons existed, which by degrees transformed the  landed aristocracy from English into Norman. Those who had gained the  crown for the new king must receive the minor rewards which they had had  in view for themselves, and with no unnecessary delay. A new nobility  must be endowed, and policy would dictate also that at the earliest  moment the country should be garrisoned by faithful vassals of the king's  own, supplied with means of defending themselves and having  proportionately as much at stake in the country as himself. The lands and  property of those who had fought against him or who were irreconcilable  would be in his hands to dispose of, according to any theory of his  position which William might hold. The crown lands of the old kings were  of course his, and in spite of all the grants that were made during the  reign, this domain was increased rather than diminished under William.  The possessions of Harold's family and of all those who had fallen in the  battle with him were at once confiscated, and these seem to have sufficed  for present needs. Whatever may have been true later, we may accept the  conclusion that \"on the whole William at this stage of his reign warred  rather against the memory of the dead than against the lives or fortunes  of the living.\"    These confiscated lands the king bestowed on the chiefs of his army. We  have little information of the way in which this change was carried out,  but in many cases certainly the possessions held by a given Saxon thane  in the days of Edward were turned over as a whole to a given Norman with  no more accurate description than that the lands of A were now to be the  lands of B. What lands had actually belonged to A, the old owner, was  left to be determined by some sort of local inquiry, but with this the  king did not concern himself beyond giving written orders that the change  was to be made. Often this turning over to a Norman of the estate of a  dispossessed Saxon resulted in unintended injustice and in legal quarrels  which were unsettled years afterwards. Naturally the new owner considered  himself the successor of the old one in all the rights which he  possessed. If for some of his manors the Saxon was the tenant of a church  or of an abbey, the Norman often seized upon these with the rest, as if  all were rightfully confiscated together and all held by an equally clear  title, and the Church was not always able, even after long litigation, to  establish its rights. We have little direct evidence as to the  relationship which such grants created between the recipient and the  king, or as to the kind of tenure by which they were held, but the  indirect evidence is constantly accumulating, and may be said to be now  indeed conclusive, that the relation and the tenure made use of were the  only ones with which the Normans were at this time familiar or which  would be likely to seem to them possible,--the relationship of vassal and  lord; and that with these first grants of land which the king made to his  followers was introduced into England that side of the feudal system  which Saxon England had never known, but which was, from this time on,  for nearly two centuries, to be the ruling system in both public and  private law.    In saying that the feudal system was introduced into England by these  grants, we must guard against a misconception. The feudal system, if we  use that name as we commonly do to cover the entire relations of the  society of that age, had two sides to it, distinct in origin, character,  and purpose. To any clear understanding of the organization of feudal  society, or of the change which its establishment made in English  history, it is necessary, although it is not easy, to hold these two  sides apart. There was in the practices and in the vocabulary of  feudalism itself some confusion of the two in the borderland that lay  between them, and the difficulty is made greater for us by the fact that  both sides were primarily concerned with the holding of land, and  especially by the fact that the same piece of land belonged at once to  both sides and was held at the same time by two different men, by two  different kinds of tenure, and under two different systems of law. The  one side may be called from its ruling purpose economic and the other  political. The one had for its object the income to be drawn from the  land; the other regarded chiefly the political obligations joined to the  land and the political or social rank and duties of the holders.    The economic side concerned the relations of the cultivators of the soil  with the man who was, in relation to them, the owner of that soil; it  regulated the tenures by which they held the little pieces which they  cultivated, their rights over that land and its produce, their  obligations to the owner of service in cultivating for him the lands  which he reserved for his own use, and, in addition, of payments to him  in kind and perhaps in money on a variety of occasions and occurrences  throughout the year; it defined and practically limited, also, the  owner's right of exaction from these cultivators. These regulations were  purely customary; they had grown up slowly out of experience, and they  were not written. But this was true also of almost all the law of that  age, and this law of the cultivators was as valid in its place as the  king's law, and was enforced in its own courts. It is true that most of  these men who cultivated the soil were serfs, at least not entirely free;  but that fact made no difference in this particular; they had their  standing, their voice, and their rights in their lord's \"customary\"  court, and the documents which describe to us these arrangements call  them, as they do the highest barons of the realm, \"peers,\"--that is,  peers of these customary courts. Not all, indeed,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8559"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 360, November 25, 1882 (#5)"],[1,"    *       *       *       *       *          THE \"UNIVERSAL\" GAS ENGINE.      The accompanying engravings illustrate a new and very simple form of gas  engine, the invention of J. A. Ewins and H. Newman, and made by Mr. T.  B. Barker, of Scholefield-street, Bloomsbury, Birmingham. It is known as  the \"Universal\" engine, and is at present constructed in sizes varying  from one-eighth horse-power--one man power--to one horse-power, though  larger sizes are being made. The essentially new feature of the engine  is, says the _Engineer_, the simple rotary ignition valve consisting of  a ratchet plate or flat disk with a number of small radial slots which  successively pass a small slot in the end of the cylinder, and through  which the flame is drawn to ignite the charge. In our illustrations Fig.  1 is a side elevation; Fig. 2 an end view of same; Fig. 3 a plan; Fig. 4  is a sectional view of the chamber in which the gas and air are mixed,  with the valves appertaining thereto; Fig. 5 is a detail view of the  ratchet plate, with pawl and levers and valve gear shaft; Fig. 6 is  a sectional view of a pump employed in some cases to circulate water  through the jacket; Fig. 7 is a sectional view of arrangement for  lighting, and ratchet plate, j, with central spindle and igniting  apertures, and the spiral spring, k, and fly nut, showing the attachment  to the end of the working cylinder, f1; b5, b5, bevel wheels driving  the valve gear shaft; e, the valve gear driving shaft; e2, eccentric to  drive pump; e cubed, eccentric or cam to drive exhaust valve; e4, crank to  drive ratchet plate; e5, connecting rod to ratchet pawl; f, cylinder  jacket; f1, internal or working cylinder; f2, back cylinder cover; g,  igniting chamber; h, mixing chamber; h1, flap valve; h2, gas inlet  valve, the motion of which is regulated by a governor; h3, gas inlet  valve seat; h4, cover, also forming stop for gas inlet valve; h5, gas  inlet pipe; h6, an inlet valve; h8, cover, also forming stop for air  inlet valve; h9, inlet pipe for air with grating; i, exhaust chamber;  i2, exhaust valve spindle; i7, exhaust pipe; j6, lighting aperture  through cylinder end; l, igniting gas jet; m, regulating and stop valve  for gas.    [Illustration: IMPROVED GAS ENGINE]    The engine, it will be seen, is single-acting, and no compression of the  explosive charge is employed. An explosive mixture of combustible gas  and air is drawn through the valves, h2 and h6, and exploded behind  the piston once in a revolution; but by a duplication of the valve and  igniting apparatus, placed also at the front end of the cylinder, the  engine may be constructed double-acting. At the proper time, when the  piston has proceeded far enough to draw in through the mixing chamber,  h, into the igniting chamber, g, the requisite amount of gas and air,  the ratchet plate, j, is pushed into such a position by the pawl, j3,  that the flame from the igniting jet, l, passes through one of the slots  or holes, j1, and explodes the charge when opposite j6, which is the  only aperture in the end of the working cylinder (see Fig. 7 and Fig.  2), thus driving the piston on to the end of its forward stroke. The  exhaust valve, Fig. 9, though not exactly of the form shown, is kept  open during the whole of this return stroke by means of the eccentric,  e3, on the shaft working the ratchet, and thus allowing the products of  combustion to escape through the exhaust pipe, i7, in the direction of  the arrow. Between the ratchet disk and the igniting flame a small plate  not shown is affixed to the pipe, its edge being just above the burner  top. The flame is thus not blown out by the inrushing air when the slots  in ratchet plate and valve face are opposite. This ratchet plate or  ignition valve, the most important in any engine, has so very small a  range of motion per revolution of the engine that it cannot get out of  order, and it appears to require no lubrication or attention whatever.  The engines are working very successfully, and their simplicity enables  them to be made at low cost. They cost for gas from 1/2d. to 11/2d. per hour  for the sizes mentioned.    [Illustration: Fig.9.]           *       *       *       *       *          GAS FURNACE FOR BAKING REFRACTORY PRODUCTS.      In order that small establishments may put to profit the advantages  derived from the use of annular furnaces heated with gas, smaller  dimensions have been given the baking chambers of such furnaces. The  accompanying figure gives a section of a furnace of this kind, set into  the ground, and the height of whose baking chamber is only one and a  half meters. The chamber is not vaulted, but is covered by slabs of  refractory clay, D, that may be displaced by the aid of a small car  running on a movable track. This car is drawn over the compartment that  is to be emptied, and the slab or cover, D, is taken off and carried  over the newly filled compartment and deposited thereon.    The gas passes from the channel through the pipe, a, into the vertical  conduits, b, and is afterward disengaged through the tuyeres into the  chamber. In order that the gas may be equally applied for preliminary  heating or smoking, a small smoking furnace, S, has been added to  the apparatus. The upper part of this consists of a wide cylinder  of refractory clay, in the center of whose cover there is placed an  internal tube of refractory clay, which communicates with the channel,  G, through a pipe, d. This latter leads the gas into the tube, t, of the  smoking furnace, which is perforated with a large number of small holes.  The air requisite for combustion enters through the apertures, o, in the  cover of the furnace, and brings about in the latter a high temperature.  The very hot gases descend into the lower iron portion of this small  furnace and pass through a tube, e, into the smoking chamber by the aid  of vertical conduits, b', which serve at the same time as gas tuyeres  for the extremity of the furnace that is exposed to the fire.    [Illustration: GAS FURNACE FOR BAKING REFRACTORY PRODUCTS.]    In the lower part of the smoking furnace, which is made of boiler plate  and can be put in communication with the tube, e, there are large  apertures that may be wholly or partially closed by means of registers  so as to carry to the hot gas derived from combustion any quantity  whatever of cold and dry air, and thus cause a variation at will of the  temperature of the gases which are disengaged from the tube, e.    The use of these smoking apparatus heated by gas does away also with the  inconveniences of the ordinary system, in which the products are soiled  by cinders or dust, and which render the gradual heating of objects to  be baked difficult. At the beginning, there is allowed to enter the  lower part of the small furnace, S, through the apertures, a very  considerable quantity of cold air, so as to lower the temperature of the  smoke gas that escapes from the tube, e, to 30 or 50 degrees. Afterward,  these secondary air entrances are gradually closed so as to increase the  temperature of the gases at will.           *       *       *       *       *          THE EFFICIENCY OF FANS.      Air, like every other gas or combination of gases, possesses weight;  some persons who have been taught that the air exerts a pressure of 14.7  lb. per square inch, cannot, however, be got to realize the fact that a  cubit foot of air at the same pressure and at a temperature of 62 deg.  weighs the thirteenth part of a pound, or over one ounce; 13.141 cubic  feet of air weigh one pound. In round numbers 30,000 cubic feet of air  weigh one ton; this is a useful figure to remember, and it is easily  carried in the mind. A hall 61 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 17 feet high  will contain one ton of air.    [Illustration: FIG. 1]    The work to be done by a fan consists in putting a weight--that of the  air--in motion. The resistances incurred are due to the inertia of the  air and various frictional influences; the nature and amount of these  last vary with the construction of the fan. As the air enters at the  center of the fan and escapes at the circumference, it will be seen that  its motion is changed while in the fan through a right angle. It may  also be taken for granted that within certain limits the air has no  motion in a radial direction when it first comes in contact with a fan  blade. It is well understood that, unless power is to be wasted, motion  should be gradually imparted to any body to be moved. Consequently, the  shape of the blades ought to be such as will impart motion at first  slowly and afterward in a rapidly increasing ratio to the air. It is  also clear that the change of motion should be effected as gradually as  possible. Fig. 1 shows how a fan should not be constructed; Fig. 2 will  serve to give an idea of how it should be made.    [Illustration: FIG. 2]    In Fig. 1 it will be seen that the air, as indicated by the bent arrows,  is violently deflected on entering the fan. In Fig. 2 it will be seen  that it follows gentle curves, and so is put gradually in motion. The  curved form of the blades shown in Fig. 2 does not appear to add much to  the efficiency of a fan; but it adds something and keeps down noise. The  idea is that the fan blades when of this form push the air radially from  the center to the circumference. The fact is, however, that the air  flies outward under the influence of centrifugal force, and always tends  to move at a tangent to the fan blades, as in Fig. 3, where the circle  is the path of the tips of the fan blades, and the arrow is a tangent to  that path; and to impart this notion a radial blade, as at C, is perhaps  as good as any other, as far as efficiency is concerned. Concerning the  shape to be imparted to the blades, looked at back or front, opinions  widely differ; but it is certain that if a fan is to be silent the  blades must be narrower at the tips than at the"]]]
