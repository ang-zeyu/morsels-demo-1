[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/560"],[0,"Mr. Standfast (#5)"],[1,"I  knew but which I had never read, and they were all in a little  flat-backed series at a shilling apiece. I arranged them on top of a  chest of drawers, but I kept the _Pilgrim's Progress_ beside my bed,  for that was one of my working tools and I had got to get it by heart.    Mrs Jimson, who came in while I was unpacking to see if the room was to  my liking, approved my taste. At our midday dinner she wanted to  discuss books with me, and was so full of her own knowledge that I was  able to conceal my ignorance.    'We are all labouring to express our personalities,' she informed me.  'Have you found your medium, Mr Brand? is it to be the pen or the  pencil? Or perhaps it is music? You have the brow of an artist, the  frontal \"bar of Michelangelo\", you remember!'    I told her that I concluded I would try literature, but before writing  anything I would read a bit more.    It was a Saturday, so Jimson came back from town in the early  afternoon. He was a managing clerk in some shipping office, but you  wouldn't have guessed it from his appearance. His city clothes were  loose dark-grey flannels, a soft collar, an orange tie, and a soft  black hat. His wife went down the road to meet him, and they returned  hand-in-hand, swinging their arms like a couple of schoolchildren. He  had a skimpy red beard streaked with grey, and mild blue eyes behind  strong glasses. He was the most friendly creature in the world, full of  rapid questions, and eager to make me feel one of the family. Presently  he got into a tweed Norfolk jacket, and started to cultivate his  garden. I took off my coat and lent him a hand, and when he stopped to  rest from his labours--which was every five minutes, for he had no kind  of physique--he would mop his brow and rub his spectacles and declaim  about the good smell of the earth and the joy of getting close to  Nature.    Once he looked at my big brown hands and muscular arms with a kind of  wistfulness. 'You are one of the doers, Mr Brand,' he said, 'and I  could find it in my heart to envy you. You have seen Nature in wild  forms in far countries. Some day I hope you will tell us about your  life. I must be content with my little corner, but happily there are no  territorial limits for the mind. This modest dwelling is a watch-tower  from which I look over all the world.'    After that he took me for a walk. We met parties of returning  tennis-players and here and there a golfer. There seemed to be an  abundance of young men, mostly rather weedy-looking, but with one or  two well-grown ones who should have been fighting. The names of some of  them Jimson mentioned with awe. An unwholesome youth was Aronson, the  great novelist; a sturdy, bristling fellow with a fierce moustache was  Letchford, the celebrated leader-writer of the Critic. Several were  pointed out to me as artists who had gone one better than anybody else,  and a vast billowy creature was described as the leader of the new  Orientalism in England. I noticed that these people, according to  Jimson, were all 'great', and that they all dabbled in something 'new'.  There were quantities of young women, too, most of them rather badly  dressed and inclining to untidy hair. And there were several decent  couples taking the air like house-holders of an evening all the world  Over. Most of these last were Jimson's friends, to whom he introduced  me. They were his own class--modest folk, who sought for a coloured  background to their prosaic city lives and found it in this odd  settlement.    At supper I was initiated into the peculiar merits of Biggleswick.    'It is one great laboratory of thought,' said Mrs Jimson. 'It is  glorious to feel that you are living among the eager, vital people who  are at the head of all the newest movements, and that the intellectual  history of England is being made in our studies and gardens. The war to  us seems a remote and secondary affair. As someone has said, the great  fights of the world are all fought in the mind.'    A spasm of pain crossed her husband's face. 'I wish I could feel it far  away. After all, Ursula, it is the sacrifice of the young that gives  people like us leisure and peace to think. Our duty is to do the best  which is permitted to us, but that duty is a poor thing compared with  what our young soldiers are giving! I may be quite wrong about the war  ... I know I can't argue with Letchford. But I will not pretend to a  superiority I do not feel.'    I went to bed feeling that in Jimson I had struck a pretty sound  fellow. As I lit the candles on my dressing-table I observed that the  stack of silver which I had taken out of my pockets when I washed  before supper was top-heavy. It had two big coins at the top and  sixpences and shillings beneath. Now it is one of my oddities that ever  since I was a small boy I have arranged my loose coins symmetrically,  with the smallest uppermost. That made me observant and led me to  notice a second point. The English classics on the top of the chest of  drawers were not in the order I had left them. Izaak Walton had got to  the left of Sir Thomas Browne, and the poet Burns was wedged  disconsolately between two volumes of Hazlitt. Moreover a receipted  bill which I had stuck in the _Pilgrim's Progress_ to mark my place had  been moved. Someone had been going through my belongings.    A moment's reflection convinced me that it couldn't have been Mrs  Jimson. She had no servant and did the housework herself, but my things  had been untouched when I left the room before supper, for she had come  to tidy up before I had gone downstairs. Someone had been here while we  were at supper, and had examined elaborately everything I possessed.  Happily I had little luggage, and no papers save the new books and a  bill or two in the name of Cornelius Brand. The inquisitor, whoever he  was, had found nothing ... The incident gave me a good deal of comfort.  It had been hard to believe that any mystery could exist in this public  place, where people lived brazenly in the open, and wore their hearts  on their sleeves and proclaimed their opinions from the rooftops. Yet  mystery there must be, or an inoffensive stranger with a kit-bag would  not have received these strange attentions. I made a practice after  that of sleeping with my watch below my pillow, for inside the case was  Mary Lamington's label. Now began a period of pleasant idle  receptiveness. Once a week it was my custom to go up to London for the  day to receive letters and instructions, if any should come. I had  moved from my chambers in Park Lane, which I leased under my proper  name, to a small flat in Westminster taken in the name of Cornelius  Brand. The letters addressed to Park Lane were forwarded to Sir Walter,  who sent them round under cover to my new address. For the rest I used  to spend my mornings reading in the garden, and I discovered for the  first time what a pleasure was to be got from old books. They recalled  and amplified that vision I had seen from the Cotswold ridge, the  revelation of the priceless heritage which is England. I imbibed a  mighty quantity of history, but especially I liked the writers, like  Walton, who got at the very heart of the English countryside. Soon,  too, I found the _Pilgrim's Progress_ not a duty but a delight. I  discovered new jewels daily in the honest old story, and my letters to  Peter began to be as full of it as Peter's own epistles. I loved, also,  the songs of the Elizabethans, for they reminded me of the girl who had  sung to me in the June night.    In the afternoons I took my exercise in long tramps along the good  dusty English roads. The country fell away from Biggleswick into a  plain of wood and pasture-land, with low hills on the horizon. The  Place was sown with villages, each with its green and pond and ancient  church. Most, too, had inns, and there I had many a draught of cool  nutty ale, for the inn at Biggleswick was a reformed place which sold  nothing but washy cider. Often, tramping home in the dusk, I was so  much in love with the land that I could have sung with the pure joy of  it. And in the evening, after a bath, there would be supper, when a  rather fagged Jimson struggled between sleep and hunger, and the lady,  with an artistic mutch on her untidy head, talked ruthlessly of culture.    Bit by bit I edged my way into local society. The Jimsons were a great  help, for they were popular and had a nodding acquaintance with most of  the inhabitants. They regarded me as a meritorious aspirant towards a  higher life, and I was paraded before their friends with the suggestion  of a vivid, if Philistine, past. If I had any gift for writing, I would  make a book about the inhabitants of Biggleswick. About half were  respectable citizens who came there for country air and low rates, but  even these had a touch of queerness and had picked up the jargon of the  place. The younger men were mostly Government clerks or writers or  artists. There were a few widows with flocks of daughters, and on the  outskirts were several bigger houses--mostly houses which had been  there before the garden city was planted. One of them was brand-new, a  staring villa with sham-antique timbering, stuck on the top of a hill  among raw gardens. It belonged to a man called Moxon Ivery, who was a  kind of academic pacificist and a great god in the place. Another, a  quiet Georgian manor house, was owned by a London publisher, an ardent  Liberal whose particular branch of business compelled him to keep in  touch with the new movements. I used to see him hurrying to the station  swinging a little black bag and returning at night with the fish for  dinner.    I soon got to know a surprising lot of people, and they were the  rummiest birds you can imagine. For example, there were the Weekeses,  three girls who lived with their mother in a house so artistic that you  broke your head whichever way you turned in it.

During the    Fig. 7. Brassica oleracea: conjoint circumnutation of the hypocotyl and  cotyledons, from 10.50 A.M. to 8 A.M. on the following morning. Tracing  made on a vertical glass.    next 12 hours the bead swept obliquely up and down 8 times and described 4  figures representing ellipses; so that it travelled at nearly the same rate  as in the previous case. during the night it moved upwards, owing to the  sleep-movement of the cotyledons, and continued to move in the same  direction till 9 A.M. on the following morning; but this latter movement  would not have occurred with seedlings under their natural conditions fully  exposed to the light.    By 9.25 A.M. on this second day the same cotyledon had  [page 18]  begun to fall, and a dot was made on a fresh glass. The movement was traced  until 5.30 P.M. as shown in (Fig. 8), which is given, because the course  followed was much more irregular than on the two previous occasions. During  these 8 hours the bead changed its course greatly 10 times. The upward  movement of the cotyledon during the afternoon and early part of the night  is here plainly shown.    Fig. 8. Brassica oleracea: conjoint circumnutation of the hypocotyl and  cotyledons during 8 hours. Figure here reduced to one-third of the original  scale, as traced on a vertical glass.    As the filaments were fixed in the three last cases to one of the  cotyledons, and as the hypocotyl was left free, the tracings show the  movement of both organs conjoined; and we now wished to ascertain whether  both circumnutated. Filaments were therefore fixed horizontally to two  hypocotyls close beneath the petioles of their cotyledons. These seedlings  had stood for two days in the same position before a north-east window. In  the morning, up to about 11 A.M., they moved in zigzag lines towards the  light; and at night they again became almost upright through apogeotropism.  After about 11 A.M. they moved a little back from the light, often crossing  and recrossing their former path in zigzag lines. the sky on this day  varied much in brightness, and these observations merely proved that the  hypocotyls were continually moving in a manner resembling circumnutation.  On a previous day which was uniformly cloudy, a hypocotyl was firmly  secured to a little stick, and a filament was fixed to the larger of the  two cotyledons, and its movement was traced on a vertical glass. It fell  greatly from 8.52 A.M., when the first dot was made, till 10.55 A.M.; it  then rose greatly until 12.17 P.M. Afterwards it fell a little and made a  loop, but by 2.22 P.M. it had risen a little and continued rising till 9.23  P.M., when it made another loop, and at 10.30 P.M. was again rising. These  observations show that the cotyledons move  [page 19]  vertically up and down all day long, and as there was some slight lateral  movement, they circumnutated.    Fig. 9. Brassica oleracea: circumnutation of hypocotyl, in darkness, traced  on a horizontal glass, by means of a filament with a bead fixed across its  summit, between 9.15 A.M. and 8.30 A.M. on the following morning. Figure  here reduced to one-half of original scale.    The cabbage was one of the first plants, the seedlings of which were  observed by us, and we did not then know how far the circumnutation of the  different parts was affected by light. Young seedlings were therefore kept  in complete darkness except for a minute or two during each observation,  when they were illuminated by a small wax taper held almost vertically  above them. During the first day the hypocotyl of one changed its course 13  times (see Fig. 9); and it deserves notice that the longer axes of the  figures described often cross one another at right or nearly right angles.  Another seedling was observed in the same manner, but it was much older,  for it had formed a true leaf a quarter of an inch in length, and the  hypocotyl was 1 3/8 inch in height. The figure traced was a very complex  one, though the movement was not so great in extent as in the last case.    The hypocotyl of another seedling of the same age was secured to a little  stick, and a filament having been fixed to the midrib of one of the  cotyledons, the movement of the bead was traced during 14 h. 15 m. (see  Fig. 10) in darkness. It should be noted that the chief movement of the  cotyledons, namely, up and down, would be shown on a horizontal glass-plate  only by the lines in the direction of the midrib (that is,  [page 20]  up and down, as Fig. 10 here stands) being a little lengthened or  shortened; whereas any lateral movement would be well exhibited. The  present tracing shows that the cotyledon did thus move laterally (that is,  from side to side in the tracing) 12 times in the 14 h. 15 m. of  observation. Therefore the cotyledons certainly circumnutated, though the  chief movement was up and down in a vertical plane.    Fig 10. Brassica oleracea: circumnutation of a cotyledon, the hypocotyl  having been secured to a stick, traced on a horizontal glass, in darkness,  from 8.15 A.M. to 10.30 P.M. Movement of the bead of the filament magnified  13 times.    Rate of Movement.--The movements of the hypocotyls and cotyledons of  seedling cabbages of different ages have now been sufficiently illustrated.  With respect to the rate, seedlings were placed under the microscope with  the stage removed, and with a micrometer eye-piece so adjusted that each  division equalled 1/500 inch; the plants were illuminated by light passing  through a solution of bichromate of potassium so as to eliminate  heliotropism. Under these circumstances it was interesting to observe how  rapidly the circumnutating apex of a cotyledon passed across the divisions  of the micrometer. Whilst travelling in any direction the apex generally  oscillated backwards and forwards to the extent of 1/500 and sometimes of  nearly 1/250 of an inch. These oscillations were quite different from the  trembling caused by any disturbance in the same room or by the shutting of  a distant door. The first seedling observed was nearly two inches in height  and had been etiolated by having been grown in darkness. The tip of the  cotyledon passed across 10 divisions of the micrometer, that is, 1/50 of an  inch, in 6 m. 40 s. Short glass filaments were then fixed vertically to the  hypocotyls of several seedlings so as to project a little above the  cotyledons, thus exaggerating the rate of movement; but only a few of the  observations thus made are worth giving. The most remarkable fact was the  oscillatory movement above described, and the difference of rate at which  the point crossed the divisions of the micrometer, after short intervals of  time. For instance, a tall not-etiolated seedling had been kept for 14 h.  in darkness; it was exposed before a north-east window for only  [page 21]  two or three minutes whilst a glass filament was fixed vertically to the  hypocotyl; it was then again placed in darkness for half an hour and  afterwards observed by light passing through bichromate of potassium.  The  point, oscillating as usual, crossed five divisions of the micrometer (i.e.  1/100 inch) in 1 m. 30 s. The seedling was then left in darkness for an  hour, and now it required 3 m. 6 s. to cross one division, that is, 15 m.  30 s. to have crossed five divisions. Another seedling, after being  occasionally observed in the back part of a northern room with a very dull  light, and left in complete darkness for intervals of half an hour, crossed  five divisions in 5 m. in the direction of the window, so that we concluded  that the movement was heliotropic. But this was probably not the case, for  it was placed close to a north-east window and left there for 25 m., after  which time, instead of moving still more quickly towards the light, as  might have been expected, it travelled only at the rate of 12 m. 30 s. for  five divisions. It was then again left in complete darkness for 1 h., and  the point now travelled in the same direction as before, but at the rate of  3 m. 18 s. for five divisions.    We shall have to recur to the cotyledons of the cabbage in a future  chapter, when we treat of their sleep-movements. The circumnutation, also,  of the leaves of fully-developed plants will hereafter be described.    Fig. 11. Githago segetum: circumnutation of hypocotyl, traced on a  horizontal glass, by means of a filament fixed transversely across its  summit, from 8.15 A.M. to 12.15 P.M. on the following day. Movement of bead  of filament magnified about 13 times, here reduced to one-half the original  scale.    Githago segetum (Caryophylleae).--A young seedling was dimly illuminated  from above, and the circumnutation of the hypo-  [page 22]  cotyl was observed during 28 h., as shown in Fig. 11. It moved in all  directions; the lines from right and to left in the figure being parallel  to the blades of the cotyledons. The actual distance travelled from side to  side by the summit of the hypocotyl was about .2 of an inch; but it was  impossible to be accurate on this head, as the more obliquely the plant was  viewed, after it had moved for some time, the more the distances were  exaggerated.    We endeavoured to observe the circumnutation of the cotyledons, but as they  close together unless kept exposed to a moderately bright light, and as the  hypocotyl is extremely heliotropic, the necessary arrangements were too  troublesome. We shall recur to the nocturnal or sleep-movements of the  cotyledons in a future chapter.    Fig. 12.
