Only for a moment imagine that we see the camp just   before that great battle: twenty-three camps each of 10,000, with a   general at their head, would be required for the 230,000 soldiers.     While I was standing upon this same spot of ground about three years   ago, my mind contrasted the various changes of the present with the   past and I fancied that I could review, as did Mormon, the sad and   gloomy picture of his time, 1472 years ago.     The fathers of those who fell around this historic hill came from   Jerusalem 600 years B.C. They were warned of God to flee from the   land, because of the terrible calamities that were about to befall the   inhabitants of that once Holy City, for killing the prophets of God   and for their wickedness.     The decrees of God were fulfilled in the destruction of the   inhabitants of Jerusalem, after they crucified the Saviour and his   disciples, and became fully ripe in iniquity. But 600 years before   these disasters, the colony, who were directed by revelation, crossed   the sea, landing in South America, building up cities, migrating   northward, and leaving in their tracks northward many cities, temples,   massive walls, and fortifications, some of which have been discovered   by Catherwood and Stevens, as well as by many other historians; and   new discoveries are still being brought to light. Among the many   remarkable ruined aboriginal cities of the continent of America,   Palenque is one of the most noted. It is situated on the Rio Chacamas,   a branch of the great river Usumasinta, on the borders of Yucatan. It   is in latitude 17 degrees 30 minutes north, longitude 92 degrees 25   minutes west. In this old city of ruins is a temple--no doubt one of   the Nephite temples. The picture shows it as restored from the relics   that are left. It is built of stone and is at the base 310 feet long,   180 feet deep, and 25 feet high. Ranges of stone steps 30 feet broad   lead up to it, flanked with gigantic statues nine feet high, carved   in stone. There are numerous hieroglyphics engraven but considerably   defaced.     [Image: Palenque Restored.]     The Book of Mormon speaks of many temples and cities which were built   by the people of this time, and no doubt this is one of them in   ruins. But who is there that is able to tell the story of those mound   builders, excepting their own revealed history?     It must be remembered that this last nation, called Nephites, became   a very numerous people, and their history, which they were commanded   of the Lord to keep on thin plates of gold, informs us that while   they lived lives of purity, serving God prayerfully, they prospered   exceedingly.     The precious metals abounded on this new and promised land, so   beautifully described by the ancient prophet Moses. This man of God,   just before his death, blessed the children of Israel, and of Joseph,   he said:     \"Blessed of the Lord be this land, for the precious things of heaven,   for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath, and for the   precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things   put forth by the moon, and for the chief things of the ancient   mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills, and for   the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and for the good   will of him that dwelt in the bush let the blessing come upon the head   of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him that was separated   from his brethren. His glory is like the firstling of his bullock,   and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push   the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten   thousands of Ephraim, and the thousands of Manasseh.\"    Now, if we can successfully establish this continent of America as  being the land spoken of by Moses--which is verily true--then we shall  find not only those lost nations but the present generation dwelling on  this land abounding in the good things found even in the lasting hills,  and a choice land above all others.    As evidence I will introduce the words of our famed patriarch, Father  Jacob:     \"Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose   branches [children] run over the wall [the ocean]. The archers have   sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him, but his bow abode   in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands   of the mighty God of Jacob; from thence is the Shepherd, the stone of   Israel. Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by   the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above,   blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts,   and of the womb: The blessings of thy father have prevailed above   the blessings of my progenitors [Abraham and Isaac, whose land was   Jerusalem] unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills [Rocky   Mountains;] they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of   the head of him that was separate from his brethren [which was Joseph,   sold by his brethren into Egypt].\"    Father Lehi and his son Nephi and others, just before crossing the sea,  or wall of waters, to this choice land of Jacob, searched the records  which were brought from Jerusalem and these are the words which they  found recorded:     \"And my father Lehi also found upon the plates of brass, a genealogy   of his fathers; wherefore he knew that he was a descendant of Joseph,   yea, even that Joseph who was the son of Jacob, who was sold into   Egypt, and who was preserved by the hand of the Lord, that he might   preserve his father, Jacob, and all his household from perishing with   famine. And they were also led out of captivity and out of the land of   Egypt, by that same God who had preserved them. And thus my Father,   Lehi, did discover the genealogy of his fathers.\"    While Father Lehi and those who were with him encamped on the borders  of the Red Sea, by a command of the Lord the sons of Lehi returned to  Jerusalem and succeeded in bringing Ishmael (a righteous Israelite of  the \"tribe of Ephraim\") with his five marriageable daughters, to join  the colony. They finally emigrated to America, literally fulfilling  the words of Jacob with regard to Joseph's promised inheritance of the  choice land that was to reach to the everlasting hills. By this new  acquisition, the sons of Lehi were provided with wives, and that, too,  of Ephraimitish blood, making the remnants of their line, who were  discovered in the year 1492 by Christopher Columbus, of the lineage  of Ephraim and Manassah, whose descendants are the American Indians.  Thus are we provided with a history which every one should read and  become acquainted with the origin of the natives of America, and find  an explanation of the ruins found in North, South and Central America.  Their history, translated from the gold plates, is now called the Book  of Mormon. This book also gives a brief account of a previous nation,  which left the Tower of Babel 2,000 years B. C., landing near the Gulf  of California. They were 344 days in crossing the ocean. In process of  time, they emigrated northward and finally became a great nation and  people.    Here follows a few words as recorded in their history on page 571,  chapter first, thirty-third verse:     \"Jared came forth with his brother and their families, with some   others and their families, from the great Tower, at the time the Lord   confounded the language of the people and swore in his wrath that they   should be scattered upon all the face of the earth.\"    In addition to these words we will add the seventh and eighth verses of  the eleventh chapter of Genesis:     \"Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they   may not understand one another's speech. So the Lord scattered them   abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth.\"    I think America is a pretty large portion of the earth, and comes in  for its share of people. According to the word of the Lord the people  _were_ scattered. Those who wish to follow this colony closely can read  their history as found in the Book of Mormon until they had built up  cities, etc., which have been and are being constantly discovered. In  process of time they numbered about 15,000,000 people and became rich,  wicked and ripe for destruction.    At one time a fierce battle was fought near where Buffalo, N. Y., now  stands, wherein two million were lying strewn upon the earth, slain in  battle and no one to bury them, till the stench drove them southward  to the Hill Ramah, which was called Cumorah by the Nephite race. A  contract was entered into between Kings Coriantumr and Shiz, giving  Coriantumr four years to gather together all who were on the side of  Coriantumr, and all for King Shiz were gathered together unto his camp.  Ether has recorded in the Book of Mormon that:     \"The army of Coriantumr did pitch their tents by the hill Ramah. And   it was that same hill where my Father Mormon did hide up the records   unto the Lord, which were sacred. * * * When they were all gathered   together, every one to the army which he would, with their wives and   their children, both men, women and children being armed with weapons   of war, having shields, and breast-plates, and head-plates, and being   clothed after the manner of war, they did march forth one against the   other to battle; and they fought all that day, and conquered not, and   when it was night they were weary, and retired to their camps; and   after they had retired to their camps, they took up a howling and a   lamentation for the loss of their people who were slain; their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/544"],[0,"Anne's House of Dreams (#5)"],[1,"bles, slender and shining-eyed, in the mist of her maiden veil, with  her arms full of roses.  Gilbert, waiting for her in the hall below,  looked up at her with adoring eyes.  She was his at last, this evasive,  long-sought Anne, won after years of patient waiting.  It was to him  she was coming in the sweet surrender of the bride.  Was he worthy of  her?  Could he make her as happy as he hoped?  If he failed her--if he  could not measure up to her standard of manhood--then, as she held out  her hand, their eyes met and all doubt was swept away in a glad  certainty.  They belonged to each other; and, no matter what life might  hold for them, it could never alter that.  Their happiness was in each  other's keeping and both were unafraid.    They were married in the sunshine of the old orchard, circled by the  loving and kindly faces of long-familiar friends.  Mr. Allan married  them, and the Reverend Jo made what Mrs. Rachel Lynde afterwards  pronounced to be the \"most beautiful wedding prayer\" she had ever  heard.  Birds do not often sing in September, but one sang sweetly from  some hidden bough while Gilbert and Anne repeated their deathless vows.  Anne heard it and thrilled to it; Gilbert heard it, and wondered only  that all the birds in the world had not burst into jubilant song; Paul  heard it and later wrote a lyric about it which was one of the most  admired in his first volume of verse; Charlotta the Fourth heard it and  was blissfully sure it meant good luck for her adored Miss Shirley.  The bird sang until the ceremony was ended and then it wound up with  one mad little, glad little trill.  Never had the old gray-green house  among its enfolding orchards known a blither, merrier afternoon.  All  the old jests and quips that must have done duty at weddings since Eden  were served up, and seemed as new and brilliant and mirth-provoking as  if they had never been uttered before.  Laughter and joy had their way;  and when Anne and Gilbert left to catch the Carmody train, with Paul as  driver, the twins were ready with rice and old shoes, in the throwing  of which Charlotta the Fourth and Mr. Harrison bore a valiant part.  Marilla stood at the gate and watched the carriage out of sight down  the long lane with its banks of goldenrod.  Anne turned at its end to  wave her last good-bye.  She was gone--Green Gables was her home no  more; Marilla's face looked very gray and old as she turned to the  house which Anne had filled for fourteen years, and even in her  absence, with light and life.    But Diana and her small fry, the Echo Lodge people and the Allans, had  stayed to help the two old ladies over the loneliness of the first  evening; and they contrived to have a quietly pleasant little supper  time, sitting long around the table and chatting over all the details  of the day.  While they were sitting there Anne and Gilbert were  alighting from the train at Glen St. Mary.        CHAPTER 5    THE HOME COMING    Dr. David Blythe had sent his horse and buggy to meet them, and the  urchin who had brought it slipped away with a sympathetic grin, leaving  them to the delight of driving alone to their new home through the  radiant evening.    Anne never forgot the loveliness of the view that broke upon them when  they had driven over the hill behind the village.  Her new home could  not yet be seen; but before her lay Four Winds Harbor like a great,  shining mirror of rose and silver.  Far down, she saw its entrance  between the bar of sand dunes on one side and a steep, high, grim, red  sandstone cliff on the other.  Beyond the bar the sea, calm and  austere, dreamed in the afterlight.  The little fishing village,  nestled in the cove where the sand-dunes met the harbor shore, looked  like a great opal in the haze.  The sky over them was like a jewelled  cup from which the dusk was pouring; the air was crisp with the  compelling tang of the sea, and the whole landscape was infused with  the subtleties of a sea evening.  A few dim sails drifted along the  darkening, fir-clad harbor shores.  A bell was ringing from the tower  of a little white church on the far side; mellowly and dreamily sweet,  the chime floated across the water blent with the moan of the sea.  The  great revolving light on the cliff at the channel flashed warm and  golden against the clear northern sky, a trembling, quivering star of  good hope.  Far out along the horizon was the crinkled gray ribbon of a  passing steamer's smoke.    \"Oh, beautiful, beautiful,\" murmured Anne.  \"I shall love Four Winds,  Gilbert.  Where is our house?\"    \"We can't see it yet--the belt of birch running up from that little  cove hides it.  It's about two miles from Glen St. Mary, and there's  another mile between it and the light-house.  We won't have many  neighbors, Anne.  There's only one house near us and I don't know who  lives in it.  Shall you be lonely when I'm away?\"    \"Not with that light and that loveliness for company.  Who lives in  that house, Gilbert?\"    \"I don't know.  It doesn't look--exactly--as if the occupants would be  kindred spirits, Anne, does it?\"    The house was a large, substantial affair, painted such a vivid green  that the landscape seemed quite faded by contrast.  There was an  orchard behind it, and a nicely kept lawn before it, but, somehow,  there was a certain bareness about it.  Perhaps its neatness was  responsible for this; the whole establishment, house, barns, orchard,  garden, lawn and lane, was so starkly neat.    \"It doesn't seem probable that anyone with that taste in paint could be  VERY kindred,\" acknowledged Anne, \"unless it were an accident--like our  blue hall.  I feel certain there are no children there, at least.  It's  even neater than the old Copp place on the Tory road, and I never  expected to see anything neater than that.\"    They had not met anybody on the moist, red road that wound along the  harbor shore.  But just before they came to the belt of birch which hid  their home, Anne saw a girl who was driving a flock of snow-white geese  along the crest of a velvety green hill on the right.  Great, scattered  firs grew along it.  Between their trunks one saw glimpses of yellow  harvest fields, gleams of golden sand-hills, and bits of blue sea.  The  girl was tall and wore a dress of pale blue print.  She walked with a  certain springiness of step and erectness of bearing.  She and her  geese came out of the gate at the foot of the hill as Anne and Gilbert  passed.  She stood with her hand on the fastening of the gate, and  looked steadily at them, with an expression that hardly attained to  interest, but did not descend to curiosity.  It seemed to Anne, for a  fleeting moment, that there was even a veiled hint of hostility in it.  But it was the girl's beauty which made Anne give a little gasp--a  beauty so marked that it must have attracted attention anywhere.  She  was hatless, but heavy braids of burnished hair, the hue of ripe wheat,  were twisted about her head like a coronet; her eyes were blue and  star-like; her figure, in its plain print gown, was magnificent; and  her lips were as crimson as the bunch of blood-red poppies she wore at  her belt.    \"Gilbert, who is the girl we have just passed?\" asked Anne, in a low  voice.    \"I didn't notice any girl,\" said Gilbert, who had eyes only for his  bride.    \"She was standing by that gate--no, don't look back.  She is still  watching us.  I never saw such a beautiful face.\"    \"I don't remember seeing any very handsome girls while I was here.  There are some pretty girls up at the Glen, but I hardly think they  could be called beautiful.\"    \"This girl is.  You can't have seen her, or you would remember her.  Nobody could forget her.  I never saw such a face except in pictures.  And her hair!  It made me think of Browning's 'cord of gold' and  'gorgeous snake'!\"    \"Probably she's some visitor in Four Winds--likely some one from that  big summer hotel over the harbor.\"    \"She wore a white apron and she was driving geese.\"    \"She might do that for amusement.  Look, Anne--there's our house.\"    Anne looked and forgot for a time the girl with the splendid, resentful  eyes.  The first glimpse of her new home was a delight to eye and  spirit--it looked so like a big, creamy seashell stranded on the harbor  shore.  The rows of tall Lombardy poplars down its lane stood out in  stately, purple silhouette against the sky.  Behind it, sheltering its  garden from the too keen breath of sea winds, was a cloudy fir wood, in  which the winds might make all kinds of weird and haunting music.  Like  all woods, it seemed to be holding and enfolding secrets in its  recesses,--secrets whose charm is only to be won by entering in and  patiently seeking.  Outwardly, dark green arms keep them inviolate from  curious or indifferent eyes.    The night winds were beginning their wild dances beyond the bar and the  fishing hamlet across the harbor was gemmed with lights as Anne and  Gilbert drove up the poplar lane.  The door of the little house opened,  and a warm glow of firelight flickered out into the dusk.  Gilbert  lifted Anne from the buggy and led her into the garden, through the  little gate between the ruddy-tipped firs, up the trim, red path to the  sandstone step.    \"Welcome home,\" he whispered, and hand in hand they stepped over the  threshold of their house of dreams.        CHAPTER 6    CAPTAIN JIM    \"Old Doctor Dave\" and \"Mrs. Doctor Dave\" had come down to the little  house to greet the bride and groom.  Doctor Dave was a big, jolly,  white-whiskered old fellow, and Mrs. Doctor was a trim rosy-cheeked,  silver-haired little lady who took Anne at once to her heart, literally  and figuratively.    \"I'm so glad to see you, dear.  You must be real tired.  We've got a  bite of supper ready, and Captain Jim brought up some trout for you.  Captain Jim--where are you?  Oh, he's slipped out to see to the horse,  I suppose.  Come upstairs and take your things "]]]
