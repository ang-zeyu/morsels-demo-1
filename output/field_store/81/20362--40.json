[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6798"],[0,"Aesthetical Essays of Friedrich Schiller (#5)"],[1,"Schiller's paper on Tragic Art (1792), closely  connected with the former. This article contains views of the affection  of pity that seem to approximate the Aristotelian propositions about  tragedy.    His views on the sublime are expressed in two papers, \"The Sublime\" and  \"The Pathetic,\" in which we trace considerable influence of Lessing and  Winckelmann. He is led especially to strong antagonism against the  French tragedy, and he indulges in a lengthy consideration of the passage  of Virgil on Laocoon, showing the necessity of suffering and the pathetic  in connection with moral adaptations to interest us deeply.    All these essays bespeak the poet who has tried his hand at tragedy, but  in his next paper, \"On Grace and Dignity,\" we trace more of the moralist.  Those passages where he takes up a medium position between sense and  reason, between Goethe and Kant, are specially attractive. The theme of  this paper is the conception of grace, or the expression of a beautiful  soul and dignity, or that of a lofty mind. The idea of grace has been  developed more deeply and truly by Schiller than by Wieland or  Winckelmann, but the special value of the paper is its constantly  pointing to the ideal of a higher humanity. In it he does full justice  to the sensuous and to the moral, and commencing with the beautiful  nature of the Greeks, to whom sense was never mere sense, nor reason mere  reason, he concludes with an image of perfected humanity in which grace  and dignity are united, the former by architectonic beauty (structure),  the last supported by power.    The following year, 1795, appeared his most important contribution to  aesthetics, in his Aesthetical Letters.    In these letters he remarks that beauty is the work of free  contemplation, and we enter with it into the world of ideas, but without  leaving the world of sense. Beauty is to us an object, and yet at the  same time a state of our subjectivity, because the feeling of the  conditional is under that which we have of it. Beauty is a form because  we consider it, and life because we feel it; in a word, it is at once our  state and our art. And exactly because it is both it serves us as a  triumphant proof that suffering does not exclude activity, nor matter  form, nor limitation the infinite, for in the enjoyment of beauty both  natures are united, and by this is proved the capacity of the infinite to  be developed in the finite, and accordingly the possibility of the  sublimest humanity.    The free play of the faculty of cognition which had been determined by  Kant is also developed by Schiller. His representation of this matter is  this: Man, as a spirit, is reason and will, self-active, determining,  form-giving; this is described by Schiller as the form-instinct; man, as  a sensuous being, is determinable, receptive, termed to matter; Schiller  describes this as the material instinct, \"Stofftrieb.\" In the midst  between these two is situated the beautiful, in which reason and the  sensuous penetrate each other, and their enjoyable product is designated  by Schiller the play instinct. This expression is not happily chosen.  Schiller means to describe by it the free play of the forces, activity  according to nature, which is at once a joy and a happiness; he reminds  us of the life of Olympus, and adds: \"Man is only quite a man when he  plays.\" Personality is that which lasts, the state of feeling is the  changeable in man; he is the fixed unity remaining eternally himself in  the floods of change. Man in contact with the world is to take it up in  himself, but to unite with it the highest freedom and independence, and,  instead of being lost in the world, to subject it to his reason. It is  only by his being independent that there is reality out of him; only by  being susceptible of feeling that there is reality in him. The object of  sensuous instinct is life; that of the purer instinct figure; living  figure or beauty is the object of the play instinct.    Only inasmuch as life is formed in the understanding and form in feeling  does life win a form and form win life, and only thus does beauty arise.  By beauty the sensuous man is led up to reason, the one-sided tension of  special force is strung to harmony, and man made a complete whole.    Schiller adds that beauty knits together thought and feeling; the fullest  unity of spirit and matter. Its freedom is not lack, but harmony, of  laws; its conditions are not exclusions, inclusion of all infinity  determined in itself. A true work of art generates lofty serenity and  freedom of mind. Thus the aesthetic disposition bestows on us the  highest of all gifts, that of a disposition to humanity, and we may call  beauty our second creator.    In these letters Schiller spoke out the mildest and highest sentiments on  art, and in his paper on Simple and Sentimental Poetry (1795) he  constructs the ideal of the perfect poet. This is by far the most  fruitful of Schiller's essays in its results. It has much that is  practically applicable, and contains a very able estimate of German  poetry. The writing is also very pointed and telling, because it is  based upon actual perceptions, and it is interesting because the contrast  drawn out throughout it between the simple and the sentimental has been  referred to his own contrast with Goethe. He also wished to vindicate  modern poetry, which Goethe seemed to wish to sacrifice to the antique.    The sentimental poetry is the fruit of quiet and retirement; simple  poetry the child of life. One is a favor of nature; the sentimental  depends on itself, the simple on the world of experience. The  sentimental is in danger of extending the limits of human nature too far,  of being too ideal, too mystical. Neither character exhausts the ideal  of humanity, but the intimate union of both. Both are founded in human  nature; the contradictions lying at their basis, when cleared in thought  from the poetical faculty, are realism and idealism. These also are  sides of human nature, which, when unconnected, bring forth disastrous  results. Their opposition is as old as the beginning of culture, and  till its end can hardly be set aside, save in the individual. The  idealist is a nobler but a far less perfect being; the realist appears  far less noble, but is more perfect, for the noble lies in the proof of a  great capacity, but the perfect in the general attitude of the whole and  in the real facts.    On the whole it may be said, taking a survey of these labors, that if  Schiller had developed his ideas systematically and the unity of his  intuition of the world, which were present in his feelings, and if he had  based them scientifically, a new epoch in philosophy might have been  anticipated. For he had obtained a view of such a future field of  thought with the deep clairvoyance of his genius.    A few words may be desirable on Schiller's religious standpoint,  especially in connection with his philosophical letters.    Schiller came up ten years later than Goethe, and concluded the cyclus of  genius that Goethe had inaugurated. But as he was the last arrival of  that productive period of tempestuous agitation, he retained more of its  elements in his later life and poetry than any others who had passed  through earlier agitations, such as Goethe. For Goethe cast himself free  in a great measure from the early intoxication of his youthful  imagination, devoting himself partly to nobler matter and partly to purer  forms.    Schiller derived from the stormy times of his youth his direction to the  ideal, to the hostility against the narrow spirit of civil relations, and  to all given conditions of society in general. He derived from it his  disposition, not to let himself be moulded by matter, but to place his  own creative and determining impress on matter, not so much to grasp  reality poetically and represent it poetically as to cast ideas into  reality, a disposition for lively representation and strong oratorical  coloring. All this he derived from the genial period, though later on  somewhat modified, and carried it over into his whole life and poetry;  and for this very reason he is not only together with Goethe, but before  Goethe, the favorite poet of the nation, and especially with that part of  the nation which sympathizes with him in the choice of poetic material  and in his mode of feeling.    Gervinus remarks that Schiller had at Weimar long fallen off from  Christianity, and occupied his mind tranquilly for a time with the views  of Spinoza (realistic pantheism). Like Herder and Goethe, he viewed life  in its great entirety and sacrificed the individual to the species.  Accordingly, through the gods of Greece, he fell out with strict,  orthodox Christians.    But Schiller had deeply religious and even Christian elements, as became  a German and a Kantian. He receives the Godhead in His will, and He  descends from His throne, He dwells in his soul; the poet sees divine  revelations, and as a seer announces them to man. He is a moral educator  of his people, who utters the tones of life in his poetry from youth  upwards. Philosophy was not disclosed to Plato in the highest and purest  thought, nor is poetry to Schiller merely an artificial edifice in the  harmony of speech; philosophy and poetry are to both a vibration of love  in the soul upwards to God, a liberation from the bonds of sense, a  purification of man, a moral art. On this reposes the religious  consecration of the Platonic spirit and of that of Schiller.    Issuing from the philosophical school of Kant, and imbued with the  antagonism of the age against constituted authorities, it is natural that  Schiller should be a rationalist in his religious views. It has been  justly said of him that while Goethe's system was an apotheosis of nature  Schiller's was an apotheosis of man.    Historically he was not prepared enough to test and search the question  of evidence as applied to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/68"],[0,"Warlord of Mars (#5)"],[1,"hate.  The Prince of Helium is bound upon an errand which we ourselves,  but a moment since, were wishing that we might undertake.    \"Let him go then and slay the black.  When he returns we shall still  be here to bar his way to the outer world, and thus we shall have  rid ourselves of two enemies, nor have incurred the displeasure of  the Father of Therns.\"    As he spoke I could not but note the crafty glint in his evil  eyes, and while I saw the apparent logic of his reasoning I felt,  subconsciously perhaps, that his words did but veil some sinister  intent.  The other thern turned toward him in evident surprise, but  when Lakor had whispered a few brief words into his ear he, too,  drew back and nodded acquiescence to his superior's suggestion.    \"Proceed, John Carter,\" said Lakor; \"but know that if Thurid does  not lay you low there will be those awaiting your return who will  see that you never pass again into the sunlight of the upper world.  Go!\"    During our conversation Woola had been growling and bristling  close to my side.  Occasionally he would look up into my face with  a low, pleading whine, as though begging for the word that would  send him headlong at the bare throats before him.  He, too, sensed  the villainy behind the smooth words.    Beyond the therns several doorways opened off the guardroom, and  toward the one upon the extreme right Lakor motioned.    \"That way leads to Thurid,\" he said.    But when I would have called Woola to follow me there the beast  whined and held back, and at last ran quickly to the first opening  at the left, where he stood emitting his coughing bark, as though  urging me to follow him upon the right way.    I turned a questioning look upon Lakor.    \"The brute is seldom wrong,\" I said, \"and while I do not doubt your  superior knowledge, Thern, I think that I shall do well to listen  to the voice of instinct that is backed by love and loyalty.\"    As I spoke I smiled grimly that he might know without words that  I distrusted him.    \"As you will,\" the fellow replied with a shrug.  \"In the end it  shall be all the same.\"    I turned and followed Woola into the left-hand passage, and though  my back was toward my enemies, my ears were on the alert; yet  I heard no sound of pursuit.  The passageway was dimly lighted by  occasional radium bulbs, the universal lighting medium of Barsoom.    These same lamps may have been doing continuous duty in these  subterranean chambers for ages, since they require no attention  and are so compounded that they give off but the minutest of their  substance in the generation of years of luminosity.    We had proceeded for but a short distance when we commenced to pass  the mouths of diverging corridors, but not once did Woola hesitate.  It was at the opening to one of these corridors upon my right that  I presently heard a sound that spoke more plainly to John Carter,  fighting man, than could the words of my mother tongue--it was the  clank of metal--the metal of a warrior's harness--and it came from  a little distance up the corridor upon my right.    Woola heard it, too, and like a flash he had wheeled and stood  facing the threatened danger, his mane all abristle and all his  rows of glistening fangs bared by snarling, backdrawn lips.  With  a gesture I silenced him, and together we drew aside into another  corridor a few paces farther on.    Here we waited; nor did we have long to wait, for presently we saw  the shadows of two men fall upon the floor of the main corridor  athwart the doorway of our hiding place.  Very cautiously they  were moving now--the accidental clank that had alarmed me was not  repeated.    Presently they came opposite our station; nor was I surprised to  see that the two were Lakor and his companion of the guardroom.    They walked very softly, and in the right hand of each gleamed a  keen long-sword.  They halted quite close to the entrance of our  retreat, whispering to each other.    \"Can it be that we have distanced them already?\" said Lakor.    \"Either that or the beast has led the man upon a wrong trail,\"  replied the other, \"for the way which we took is by far the shorter  to this point--for him who knows it.  John Carter would have found  it a short road to death had he taken it as you suggested to him.\"    \"Yes,\" said Lakor, \"no amount of fighting ability would have saved  him from the pivoted flagstone.  He surely would have stepped upon  it, and by now, if the pit beneath it has a bottom, which Thurid  denies, he should have been rapidly approaching it.  Curses on that  calot of his that warned him toward the safer avenue!\"    \"There be other dangers ahead of him, though,\" spoke Lakor's fellow,  \"which he may not so easily escape--should he succeed in escaping  our two good swords.  Consider, for example, what chance he will  have, coming unexpectedly into the chamber of--\"    I would have given much to have heard the balance of that conversation  that I might have been warned of the perils that lay ahead, but  fate intervened, and just at the very instant of all other instants  that I would not have elected to do it, I sneezed.          THE TEMPLE OF THE SUN      There was nothing for it now other than to fight; nor did I have  any advantage as I sprang, sword in hand, into the corridor before  the two therns, for my untimely sneeze had warned them of my presence  and they were ready for me.    There were no words, for they would have been a waste of breath.  The very presence of the two proclaimed their treachery.  That  they were following to fall upon me unawares was all too plain,  and they, of course, must have known that I understood their plan.    In an instant I was engaged with both, and though I loathe the very  name of thern, I must in all fairness admit that they are mighty  swordsmen; and these two were no exception, unless it were that  they were even more skilled and fearless than the average among  their race.    While it lasted it was indeed as joyous a conflict as I ever had  experienced.  Twice at least I saved my breast from the mortal  thrust of piercing steel only by the wondrous agility with which  my earthly muscles endow me under the conditions of lesser gravity  and air pressure upon Mars.    Yet even so I came near to tasting death that day in the gloomy  corridor beneath Mars's southern pole, for Lakor played a trick  upon me that in all my experience of fighting upon two planets I  never before had witnessed the like of.    The other thern was engaging me at the time, and I was forcing  him back--touching him here and there with my point until he was  bleeding from a dozen wounds, yet not being able to penetrate his  marvelous guard to reach a vulnerable spot for the brief instant  that would have been sufficient to send him to his ancestors.    It was then that Lakor quickly unslung a belt from his harness,  and as I stepped back to parry a wicked thrust he lashed one end  of it about my left ankle so that it wound there for an instant,  while he jerked suddenly upon the other end, throwing me heavily  upon my back.    Then, like leaping panthers, they were upon me; but they  had reckoned without Woola, and before ever a blade touched me, a  roaring embodiment of a thousand demons hurtled above my prostrate  form and my loyal Martian calot was upon them.    Imagine, if you can, a huge grizzly with ten legs armed with mighty  talons and an enormous froglike mouth splitting his head from ear  to ear, exposing three rows of long, white tusks.  Then endow this  creature of your imagination with the agility and ferocity of a  half-starved Bengal tiger and the strength of a span of bulls, and  you will have some faint conception of Woola in action.    Before I could call him off he had crushed Lakor into a jelly with  a single blow of one mighty paw, and had literally torn the other  thern to ribbons; yet when I spoke to him sharply he cowed sheepishly  as though he had done a thing to deserve censure and chastisement.    Never had I had the heart to punish Woola during the long years  that had passed since that first day upon Mars when the green jed  of the Tharks had placed him on guard over me, and I had won his  love and loyalty from the cruel and loveless masters of his former  life, yet I believe he would have submitted to any cruelty that I  might have inflicted upon him, so wondrous was his affection for  me.    The diadem in the center of the circlet of gold upon the brow of  Lakor proclaimed him a Holy Thern, while his companion, not thus  adorned, was a lesser thern, though from his harness I gleaned that  he had reached the Ninth Cycle, which is but one below that of the  Holy Therns.    As I stood for a moment looking at the gruesome havoc Woola had  wrought, there recurred to me the memory of that other occasion  upon which I had masqueraded in the wig, diadem, and harness of  Sator Throg, the Holy Thern whom Thuvia of Ptarth had slain, and now  it occurred to me that it might prove of worth to utilize Lakor's  trappings for the same purpose.    A moment later I had torn his yellow wig from his bald pate and  transferred it and the circlet, as well as all his harness, to my  own person.    Woola did not approve of the metamorphosis.  He sniffed at me and  growled ominously, but when I spoke to him and patted his huge head  he at length became reconciled to the change, and at my command  trotted off along the corridor in the direction we had been going  when our progress had been interrupted by the therns.    We moved cautiously now, warned by the fragment of conversation  I had overheard.  I kept abreast of Woola that we might have the  benefit of all our eyes for what might appear suddenly ahead to  menace us, and well it was that we were forewarned.    At the bottom of a flight of narrow steps the corridor turned sharply  back upon itself, immediately making another turn in the original  direction, so that at that point it formed a perfect"]]]
