He knew now quite clearly. He made to  speak again, and again he could not.    He pressed his throat and tried a third time.    \"How long?\" he asked in a level voice. \"How long have I been asleep?\"    \"Some considerable time,\" said the flaxen-bearded man, glancing quickly  at the others.    \"How long?\"    \"A very long time.\"    \"Yes--yes,\" said Graham, suddenly testy. \"But I want--Is it--it is--some  years? Many years? There was something--I forget what. I feel--confused.  But you--\" He sobbed. \"You need not fence with me. How long--?\"    He stopped, breathing irregularly. He squeezed his eyes with his  knuckles and sat waiting for an answer.    They spoke in undertones.    \"Five or six?\" he asked faintly. \"More?\"    \"Very much more than that.\"    \"More!\"    \"More.\"    He looked at them and it seemed as though imps were twitching the  muscles of his face. He looked his question.    \"Many years,\" said the man with the red beard.    Graham struggled into a sitting position. He wiped a rheumy tear from  his face with a lean hand. \"Many years!\" he repeated. He shut his eyes  tight, opened them, and sat looking about him, from one unfamiliar thing  to another.    \"How many years?\" he asked.    \"You must be prepared to be surprised.\"    \"Well?\"    \"More than a gross of years.\"    He was irritated at the strange word. \"More than a _what_?\"    Two of them spoke together. Some quick remarks that were made about  \"decimal\" he did not catch.    \"How long did you say?\" asked Graham. \"How long? Don't look like that.  Tell me.\"    Among the remarks in an undertone, his ear caught six words: \"More than  a couple of centuries.\"      _\"What?\"_ he cried, turning on the youth who he thought had spoken. \"Who  says--? What was that? A couple of centuries!\"    \"Yes,\" said the man with the red beard. \"Two hundred years.\"    Graham repeated the words. He had been prepared to hear of a vast  repose, and yet these concrete centuries defeated him.    \"Two hundred years,\" he said again, with the figure of a great gulf  opening very slowly in his mind; and then, \"Oh, but--!\"    They said nothing.    \"You--did you say--?\"    \"Two hundred years. Two centuries of years,\" said the man with the red  beard.    There was a pause. Graham looked at their faces and saw that what he had  heard was indeed true.    \"But it can't be,\" he said querulously. \"I am dreaming. Trances. Trances  don't last. That is not right--this is a joke you have played upon  me! Tell me--some days ago, perhaps, I was walking along the coast of  Cornwall--?\"    His voice failed him.    The man with the flaxen beard hesitated. \"I'm not very strong in  history, sir,\" he said weakly, and glanced at the others.    \"That was it, sir,\" said the youngster. \"Boscastle, in the old Duchy of  Cornwall--it's in the southwest country beyond the dairy meadows. There  is a house there still. I have been there.\"    \"Boscastle!\" Graham turned his eyes to the youngster. \"That was  it--Boscastle. Little Boscastle. I fell asleep--somewhere there. I don't  exactly remember. I don't exactly remember.\"    He pressed his brows and whispered, \"More than two hundred years!\"    He began to speak quickly with a twitching face, but his heart was cold  within him. \"But if it is two hundred years, every soul I know, every  human being that ever I saw or spoke to before I went to sleep, must be  dead.\"    They did not answer him.    \"The Queen and the Royal Family, her Ministers, of Church and State.  High and low, rich and poor, one with another--\"    \"Is there England still?\"    \"That's a comfort! Is there London? Eh?\" \"This _is_ London, eh? And you  are my assistant--custodian; assistant-custodian. And these--? Eh?  Assistant-custodians to?\"    He sat with a gaunt stare on his face. \"But why am I here? No! Don't  talk. Be quiet. Let me--\"    He sat silent, rubbed his eyes, and, uncovering them, found another  little glass of pinkish fluid held towards him. He took the dose. It was  almost immediately sustaining. Directly he had taken it he began to weep  naturally and refreshingly.    Presently he looked at their faces, suddenly laughed through his tears,  a little foolishly. \"But--two--hun--dred--years!\" he said. He grimaced  hysterically and covered up his face again.    After a space he grew calm. He sat up, his hands hanging over his knees  in almost precisely the same attitude in which Isbister had found him  on the cliff at Pentargen. His attention was attracted by a thick  domineering voice, the footsteps of an advancing personage. \"What are  you doing? Why was I not warned? Surely you could tell? Someone will  suffer for this. The man must be kept quiet. Are the doorways closed?  All the doorways? He must be kept perfectly quiet. He must not be told.  Has he been told anything?\"    The man with the fair beard made some inaudible remark, and Graham  looking over his shoulder saw approaching a very short, fat, and  thickset beardless man, with aquiline nose and heavy neck and chin. Very  thick black and slightly sloping eyebrows that almost met over his  nose and overhung deep grey eyes, gave his face an oddly formidable  expression. He scowled momentarily at Graham and then his regard  returned to the man with the flaxen beard. \"These others,\" he said in a  voice of extreme irritation. \"You had better go.\"    \"Go?\" said the red-bearded man.    \"Certainly--go now. But see the doorways are closed as you go.\"    The two men addressed turned obediently, after one reluctant glance at  Graham, and instead of going through the archway as he expected, walked  straight to the dead wall of the apartment opposite the archway. And  then came a strange thing; a long strip of this apparently solid wall  rolled up with a snap, hung over the two retreating men and fell again,  and immediately Graham was alone with the new comer and the purple-robed  man with the flaxen beard.    For a space the thickset man took not the slightest notice of Graham,  but proceeded to interrogate the other--obviously his subordinate--upon  the treatment of their charge. He spoke clearly, but in phrases only  partially intelligible to Graham. The awakening seemed not only a matter  of surprise but of consternation and annoyance to him. He was evidently  profoundly excited.    \"You must not confuse his mind by telling him things,\" he repeated again  and again. \"You must not confuse his mind.\"    His questions answered, he turned quickly and eyed the awakened sleeper  with an ambiguous expression.    \"Feel queer?\" he asked.    \"Very.\"    \"The world, what you see of it, seems strange to you?\"    \"I suppose I have to live in it, strange as it seems.\"    \"I suppose so, now.\"    \"In the first place, hadn't I better have some clothes?\"    \"They--\" said the thickset man and stopped, and the flaxen-bearded man  met his eye and went away. \"You will very speedily have clothes,\" said  the thickset man.    \"Is it true indeed, that I have been asleep two hundred--?\" asked  Graham.    \"They have told you that, have they? Two hundred and three, as a matter  of fact.\"    Graham accepted the indisputable now with raised eyebrows and depressed  mouth. He sat silent for a moment, and then asked a question, \"Is there  a mill or dynamo near here?\" He did not wait for an answer. \"Things have  changed tremendously, I suppose?\" he said.    \"What is that shouting?\" he asked abruptly.    \"Nothing,\" said the thickset man impatiently. \"It's people. You'll  understand better later--perhaps. As you say, things have changed.\" He  spoke shortly, his brows were knit, and he glanced about him like a man  trying to decide in an emergency. \"We must get you clothes and so forth,  at any rate. Better wait here until some can come. No one will come near  you. You want shaving.\"    Graham rubbed his chin.    The man with the flaxen beard came back towards them, turned suddenly,  listened for a moment, lifted his eyebrows at the older man, and hurried  off through the archway towards the balcony. The tumult of shouting  grew louder, and the thickset man turned and listened also. He cursed  suddenly under his breath, and turned his eyes upon Graham with an  unfriendly expression. It was a surge of many voices, rising and  falling, shouting and screaming, and once came a sound like blows and  sharp cries, and then a snapping like the crackling of dry sticks.  Graham strained his ears to draw some single thread of sound from the  woven tumult.    Then he perceived, repeated again and again, a certain formula. For a  time he doubted his ears. But surely these were the words: \"Show us the  Sleeper! Show us the Sleeper!\"    The thickset man rushed suddenly to the archway.    \"Wild!\" he cried, \"How do they know? Do they know? Or is it guessing?\"    There was perhaps an answer.    \"I can't come,\" said the thickset man; \"I have _him_ to see to. But  shout from the balcony.\"    There was an inaudible reply.    \"Say he is not awake. Anything! I leave it to you.\"    He came hurrying back to Graham. \"You must have clothes at once,\" he  said. \"You cannot stop here--and it will be impossible to--\"    He rushed away, Graham shouting unanswered questions after him. In a  moment he was back.    \"I can't tell you what is happening. It is too complex to explain. In  a moment you shall have your clothes made. Yes--in a moment. And then  I can take you away from here. You will find out our troubles soon  enough.\"    \"But those voices. They were shouting--?\"    \"Something about the Sleeper--that's you. They have some twisted idea. I  don't know what it is. I know nothing.\"    A shrill bell jetted acutely across the indistinct mingling of remote  noises, and this brusque person sprang to a little group of appliances  in the corner of the room. He listened for a moment, regarding a ball of  crystal, nodded,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7766"],[0,"A Dog of Flanders (#5)"],[1," be great.\"    \"And if I do not love you?\" the pretty child asked, pouting a little  through her tears, and moved by the instinctive coquetries of her sex.    Nello's eyes left her face and wandered to the distance, where in the  red and gold of the Flemish night the cathedral spire rose. There was a  smile on his face so sweet and yet so sad that little Alois was awed by  it. \"I will be great still,\" he said under his breath--\"great still, or  die, Alois.\"    \"You do not love me,\" said the little spoilt child, pushing him away;  but the boy shook his head and smiled, and went on his way through the  tall yellow corn, seeing as in a vision some day in a fair future when  he should come into that old familiar land and ask Alois of her people,  and be not refused or denied, but received in honor, whilst the village  folk should throng to look upon him and say in one another's ears, \"Dost  see him? He is a king among men, for he is a great artist and the world  speaks his name; and yet he was only our poor little Nello, who was a  beggar as one may say, and only got his bread by the help of his dog.\"  And he thought how he would fold his grandsire in furs and purples, and  portray him as the old man is portrayed in the Family in the chapel of  St. Jacques; and of how he would hang the throat of Patrasche with a  collar of gold, and place him on his right hand, and say to the people,  \"This was once my only friend;\" and of how he would build himself a  great white marble palace, and make to himself luxuriant gardens of  pleasure, on the slope looking outward to where the cathedral spire  rose, and not dwell in it himself, but summon to it, as to a home, all  men young and poor and friendless, but of the will to do mighty things;  and of how he would say to them always, if they sought to bless his  name, \"Nay, do not thank me--thank Rubens. Without him, what should I  have been?\" And these dreams, beautiful, impossible, innocent, free of  all selfishness, full of heroical worship, were so closely about him as  he went that he was happy--happy even on this sad anniversary of Alois's  saint's day, when he and Patrasche went home by themselves to the little  dark hut and the meal of black bread, whilst in the mill-house all the  children of the village sang and laughed, and ate the big round cakes  of Dijon and the almond gingerbread of Brabant, and danced in the great  barn to the light of the stars and the music of flute and fiddle.    \"Never mind, Patrasche,\" he said, with his arms round the dog's neck as  they both sat in the door of the hut, where the sounds of the mirth at  the mill came down to them on the night air--\"never mind. It shall all  be changed by and by.\"    He believed in the future: Patrasche, of more experience and of more  philosophy, thought that the loss of the mill supper in the present was  ill compensated by dreams of milk and honey in some vague hereafter. And  Patrasche growled whenever he passed by Baas Cogez.    \"This is Alois's name-day, is it not?\" said the old man Daas that night  from the corner where he was stretched upon his bed of sacking.    The boy gave a gesture of assent: he wished that the old man's memory  had erred a little, instead of keeping such sure account.    \"And why not there?\" his grandfather pursued. \"Thou hast never missed a  year before, Nello.\"    \"Thou art too sick to leave,\" murmured the lad, bending his handsome  head over the bed.    \"Tut! tut! Mother Nulette would have come and sat with me, as she does  scores of times. What is the cause, Nello?\" the old man persisted. \"Thou  surely hast not had ill words with the little one?\"    \"Nay, grandfather--never,\" said the boy quickly, with a hot color in  his bent face. \"Simply and truly, Baas Cogez did not have me asked this  year. He has taken some whim against me.\"    \"But thou hast done nothing wrong?\"    \"That I know--nothing. I took the portrait of Alois on a piece of pine:  that is all.\"    \"Ah!\" The old man was silent: the truth suggested itself to him with  the boy's innocent answer. He was tied to a bed of dried leaves in the  corner of a wattle hut, but he had not wholly forgotten what the ways of  the world were like.    He drew Nello's fair head fondly to his breast with a tenderer gesture.  \"Thou art very poor, my child,\" he said with a quiver the more in his  aged, trembling voice--\"so poor! It is very hard for thee.\"    \"Nay, I am rich,\" murmured Nello; and in his innocence he thought  so--rich with the imperishable powers that are mightier than the might  of kings. And he went and stood by the door of the hut in the quiet  autumn night, and watched the stars troop by and the tall poplars  bend and shiver in the wind. All the casements of the mill-house were  lighted, and every now and then the notes of the flute came to him. The  tears fell down his cheeks, for he was but a child, yet he smiled, for  he said to himself, \"In the future!\" He stayed there until all was quite  still and dark, then he and Patrasche went within and slept together,  long and deeply, side by side.    [Illustration]    Now he had a secret which only Patrasche knew. There was a little  out-house to the hut, which no one entered but himself--a dreary place,  but with abundant clear light from the north. Here he had fashioned  himself rudely an easel in rough lumber, and here on a great gray sea  of stretched paper he had given shape to one of the innumerable fancies  which possessed his brain. No one had ever taught him anything; colors  he had no means to buy; he had gone without bread many a time to procure  even the few rude vehicles that he had here; and it was only in black or  white that he could fashion the things he saw. This great figure which  he had drawn here in chalk was only an old man sitting on a fallen  tree--only that.    He had seen old Michel the woodman sitting so at evening many a time. He  had never had a soul to tell him of outline or perspective, of anatomy  or of shadow, and yet he had given all the weary, worn-out age, all the  sad, quiet patience, all the rugged, careworn pathos of his original,  and given them so that the old lonely figure was a poem, sitting  there, meditative and alone, on the dead tree, with the darkness of the  descending night behind him.    It was rude, of course, in a way, and had many faults, no doubt; and yet  it was real, true in nature, true in art, and very mournful, and in a  manner beautiful.    Patrasche had lain quiet countless hours watching its gradual creation  after the labor of each day was done, and he knew that Nello had a  hope--vain and wild perhaps, but strongly cherished--of sending this  great drawing to compete for a prize of two hundred francs a year  which it was announced in Antwerp would be open to every lad of talent,  scholar or peasant, under eighteen, who would attempt to win it with  some unaided work of chalk or pencil. Three of the foremost artists in  the town of Rubens were to be the judges and elect the victor according  to his merits.    All the spring and summer and autumn Nello had been at work upon this  treasure, which, if triumphant, would build him his first step toward  independence and the mysteries of the art which he blindly, ignorantly,  and yet passionately adored.    He said nothing to any one: his grandfather would not have understood,  and little Alois was lost to him. Only to Patrasche he told all, and  whispered, \"Rubens would give it me, I think, if he knew.\"    Patrasche thought so too, for he knew that Rubens had loved dogs or he  had never painted them with such exquisite fidelity; and men who loved  dogs were, as Patrasche knew, always pitiful.    The drawings were to go in on the first day of December, and the  decision be given on the twenty-fourth, so that he who should win might  rejoice with all his people at the Christmas season.    In the twilight of a bitter wintry day, and with a beating heart, now  quick with hope, now faint with fear, Nello placed the great picture  on his little green milk-cart, and took it, with the help of Patrasche,  into the town, and there left it, as enjoined, at the doors of a public  building.    \"Perhaps it is worth nothing at all. How can I tell?\" he thought, with  the heart-sickness of a great timidity. Now that he had left it there,  it seemed to him so hazardous, so vain, so foolish, to dream that he,  a little lad with bare feet, who barely knew his letters, could do  anything at which great painters, real artists, could ever deign to  look. Yet he took heart as he went by the cathedral: the lordly form of  Rubens seemed to rise from the fog and the darkness, and to loom in  its magnificence before him, whilst the lips, with their kindly smile,  seemed to him to murmur, \"Nay, have courage! It was not by a weak heart  and by faint fears that I wrote my name for all time upon Antwerp.\"    Nello ran home through the cold night, comforted. He had done his  best: the rest must be as God willed, he thought, in that innocent,  unquestioning faith which had been taught him in the little gray chapel  among the willows and the poplar-trees.    [Illustration: ]    The winter was very sharp already. That night, after they reached the  hut, snow fell; and fell for very many days after that, so that the  paths and the divisions in the fields were all obliterated, and all  the smaller streams were frozen over, and the cold was intense upon the  plains. Then, indeed, it became hard work to go round for the milk while  the world was all dark, and carry it through the darkness to the silent  town. Hard work, especially for Patrasche, for the passage of the years,  that were only bringing Nello a stronger youth, were bringing him old  age, and his joints were stiff and his bones ached often. But he would  never give up his share of the labor. Nello would fain have spared him  and drawn the cart himself, but Patrasche would not allow it. All he  would ever permit or accept was the help of"]]]
