I guess these ears are ready now. Will you hold the  horse while I stick them on?\"    \"Certainly, if you'll help me up,\" said Jack.    So Tip raised him to his feet, and the Pumpkinhead went to the horse and  held its head while the boy bored two holes in it with his knife-blade and  inserted the ears.    \"They make him look very handsome,\" said Jack, admiringly.        51    But those words, spoken close to the Saw-Horse, and being the first sounds  he had ever heard, so startled the animal that he made a bound forward and  tumbled Tip on one side and Jack on the other. Then he continued to rush  forward as if frightened by the clatter of his own foot-steps.    \"Whoa!\" shouted Tip, picking himself up; \"whoa! you idiot whoa!\" The Saw-  Horse would probably have paid no attention to this, but just then it  stepped a leg into a gopher-hole and stumbled head-over-heels to the ground,  where it lay upon its back, frantically waving its four legs in the air.    Tip ran up to it.    \"You're a nice sort of a horse, I must say!\" he exclaimed. \"Why didn't you  stop when I yelled 'whoa?'\"    \"Does 'whoa' mean to stop?\" asked the Saw-Horse, in a surprised voice, as it  rolled its eyes upward to look at the boy.    \"Of course it does,\" answered Tip.    \"And a hole in the ground means to stop, also, doesn't it?\" continued the  horse.    \"To be sure; unless you step over it,\" said Tip.    \"What a strange place this is,\" the creature exclaimed, as if amazed. \"What  am I doing here, anyway?\"        52               Full page line-art drawing.                   \"DO KEEP THOSE LEGS STILL.\"        53    \"Why, I've brought you to life,\" answered the boy \"but it won't hurt you  any, if you mind me and do as I tell you.\"    \"Then I will do as you tell me,\" replied the Saw-Horse, humbly. \"But what  happened to me, a moment ago? I don't seem to be just right, someway.\"    \"You're upside down,\" explained Tip. \"But just keep those legs still a  minute and I'll set you right side up again.\"    \"How many sides have I?\" asked the creature, wonderingly.    \"Several,\" said Tip, briefly. \"But do keep those legs still.\"    The Saw-Horse now became quiet, and held its legs rigid; so that Tip, after  several efforts, was able to roll him over and set him upright.    \"Ah, I seem all right now,\" said the queer animal, with a sigh.    \"One of your ears is broken,\" Tip announced, after a careful examination.  \"I'll have to make a new one.\"    Then he led the Saw-Horse back to where Jack was vainly struggling to regain  his feet, and after assisting the Pumpkinhead to stand upright Tip whittled  out a new ear and fastened it to the horse's head.        54    \"Now,\" said he, addressing his steed, \"pay attention to what I'm going to  tell you. 'Whoa!' means to stop; 'Get-Up!' means to walk forward; 'Trot!'  means to go as fast as you can. Understand?\"    \"I believe I do,\" returned the horse.    \"Very good. We are all going on a journey to the Emerald City, to see His  Majesty, the Scarecrow; and Jack Pumpkinhead is going to ride on your back,  so he won't wear out his joints.\"    \"I don't mind,\" said the Saw-Horse. \"Anything that suits you suits me.\"    Then Tip assisted Jack to get upon the horse.    \"Hold on tight,\" he cautioned, \"or you may fall off and crack your pumpkin  head.\"    \"That would be horrible!\" said Jack, with a shudder. \"What shall I hold on  to?\"    \"Why, hold on to his ears,\" replied Tip, after a moment's hesitation.    \"Don't do that!\" remonstrated the Saw-Horse; \"for then I can't hear.\"    That seemed reasonable, so Tip tried to think of something else.    \"I'll fix it!\" said he, at length. He went into the wood and cut a short  length of limb from a young, stout tree. One end of this he sharpened to a  point, and then he dug a hole in the back of        55               Full page line-art drawing.                   \"DOES IT HURT?\" ASKED THE BOY        56  the Saw-Horse, just behind its head. Next he brought a piece of rock from  the road and hammered the post firmly into the animal's back.    \"Stop! Stop!\" shouted the horse; \"you're jarring me terribly.\"    \"Does it hurt?\" asked the boy.    \"Not exactly hurt,\" answered the animal; \"but it makes me quite nervous to  be jarred.\"    \"Well, it's all over now\" said Tip, encouragingly. \"Now, Jack, be sure to  hold fast to this post and then you can't fall off and get smashed.\"    So Jack held on tight, and Tip said to the horse:    \"Get up.\"    The obedient creature at once walked forward, rocking from side to side as  he raised his feet from the ground.    Tip walked beside the Saw-Horse, quite content with this addition to their  party. Presently he began to whistle.    \"What does that sound mean?\" asked the horse.    \"Don't pay any attention to it,\" said Tip. \"I'm just whistling, and that  only means I'm pretty well satisfied.\"    \"I'd whistle myself, if I could push my lips together,\" remarked Jack. \"I  fear, dear father, that in some respects I am sadly lacking.\"        57    After journeying on for some distance the narrow path they were following  turned into a broad roadway, paved with yellow brick. By the side of the  road Tip noticed a sign-post that read:                 \"NINE MILES TO THE EMERALD CITY.\"      But it was now growing dark, so he decided to camp for the night by the  roadside and to resume the journey next morning by daybreak. He led the Saw-  Horse to a grassy mound upon which grew several bushy trees, and carefully  assisted the Pumpkinhead to alight.    \"I think I'll lay you upon the ground, overnight,\" said the boy. \"You will  be safer that way.\"    \"How about me?\" asked the Saw-Horse.    \"It won't hurt you to stand,\" replied Tip; \"and, as you can't sleep, you may  as well watch out and see that no one comes near to disturb us.\"    Then the boy stretched himself upon the grass beside the Pumpkinhead, and  being greatly wearied by the journey was soon fast asleep.

He rubbed the sleep from  his eyes, bathed in a little brook, and then ate a portion of his bread and  cheese. Having thus prepared for a new day the boy said:    \"Let us start at once. Nine miles is quite a distance, but we ought to reach  the Emerald City by noon if no accidents happen.\" So the Pumpkinhead was  again perched upon the back of the Saw-Horse and the journey was resumed.    Tip noticed that the purple tint of the grass and trees had now faded to a  dull lavender, and before long this lavender appeared to take on a greenish  tinge that gradually brightened as they drew nearer to the great City where  the Scarecrow ruled.        60    The little party had traveled but a short two miles upon their way when the  road of yellow brick was parted by a broad and swift river. Tip was puzzled  how to cross over; but after a time he discovered a man in a ferry-boat  approaching from the other side of the stream.    When the man reached the bank Tip asked:    \"Will you row us to the other side?\"    \"Yes, if you have money,\" returned the ferryman, whose face looked cross and  disagreeable.    \"But I have no money,\" said Tip.    \"None at all?\" inquired the man.    \"None at all,\" answered the boy.    \"Then I'll not break my back rowing you over,\" said the ferryman, decidedly.    \"What a nice man!\" remarked the Pumpkinhead, smilingly.    The ferryman stared at him, but made no reply. Tip was trying to think, for  it was a great disappointment to him to find his journey so suddenly brought  to an end.    \"I must certainly get to the Emerald City,\" he said to the boatman; \"but how  can I cross the river if you do not take me?\"    The man laughed, and it was not a nice laugh.    \"That wooden horse will float,\" said he; \"and        61               Line-Art Drawing    you can ride him across. As for the pumpkinheaded loon who accompanies you,  let him sink or swim it won't matter greatly which.\"    \"Don't worry about me,\" said Jack, smiling pleasantly upon the crabbed  ferryman; \"I'm sure I ought to float beautifully.\"    Tip thought the experiment was worth making, and the Saw-Horse, who did not  know what danger meant, offered no objections whatever. So the boy led it  down into the water and climbed upon its back. Jack also waded in up to his  knees and        62  grasped the tail of the horse so that he might keep his pumpkin head above  the water.    \"Now,\" said Tip, instructing the Saw-Horse, \"if you wiggle your legs you  will probably swim; and if you swim we shall probably reach the other side.\"    The Saw-Horse at once began to wiggle its legs, which acted as oars and  moved the adventurers slowly across the river to the opposite side. So  successful was the trip that presently they were climbing, wet and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5402"],[0,"1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (#5)"],[1,"BRIMSTONE.
