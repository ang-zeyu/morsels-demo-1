[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4974"],[0,"Australia Twice Traversed (#5)"],[1," two marked trees branded exactly  alike, namely L over XVA, and each spot where these existed is  minutely described. There was at each, a water-hole, upon the bank of  which the camp was situated; at each camp a marked tree was found  branded alike; at each, the frame of a tent was left standing; at  each, some logs had been laid down to place the stores and keep them  from damp. The two places as described appear so identical that it  seems impossible to think otherwise than that Heley and his party  arrived twice at the same place without knowing it. The tree or trees  were found on a watercourse, or courses, near the head of the Warrego  River, in Queensland. The above was all the information gained by this  expedition. A subsequent search expedition was sent out in 1858, under  Augustus Gregory; this I shall place in its chronological order.  Kennedy, a companion of Sir Thomas Mitchell into Tropical Australia in  1845, next enters the field. He went to trace Mitchell's Victoria  River or Barcoo, but finding it turned southwards and broke into many  channels, he abandoned it, and on his return journey discovered the  Warrego River, which may be termed the Murrumbidgee of Queensland. On  a second expedition, in 1848, Kennedy started from Moreton Bay to  penetrate and explore the country of the long peninsula, which runs up  northward between the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Pacific Ocean, and  ends at Cape York, the northernmost point of Australia in Torres  Straits. From this disastrous expedition he never returned. He was  starved, ill, fatigued, hunted by remorseless aborigines for days, and  finally speared to death by the natives of Cape York, when almost  within sight of his goal, where a vessel was waiting to succour him  and all his party. Only a black boy named Jacky Jacky was with him.  After Kennedy's death Jacky buried all his papers in a hollow tree,  and for a couple of days he eluded his pursuers, until, reaching the  spot where his master had told him the vessel would be, he ran yelling  down to the beach, followed by a crowd of murderous savages. By the  luckiest chance a boat happened to be at the beach, and the officers  and crew rescued the boy. The following day a party led by Jacky  returned to where poor Kennedy lay, and they buried him. They obtained  his books and maps from the tree where Jacky had hidden them. The  narrative of this expedition is heart-rending. Of the whole number of  the whites, namely seven, two only were rescued by the vessel at a  place where Kennedy had formed a depot on the coast, and left four  men.    With Captain Roe, a companion of King's, with whom he was speared and  nearly killed by the natives of Goulburn Island, in 1820, and who  afterwards became Surveyor-General of the colony of Western Australia,  the list of Australia's early explorers may be said to close, although  I should remark that Augustus Gregory was a West Australian explorer  as early as the year 1846. Captain Roe conducted the most extensive  inland exploration of Western Australia at that day, in 1848. No works  of fiction can excel, or indeed equal, in romantic and heart-stirring  interest the volumes, worthy to be written in letters of gold, which  record the deeds and the sufferings of these noble toilers in the dim  and distant field of discovery afforded by the Australasian continent  and its vast islands. It would be well if those works were read by the  present generation as eagerly as the imaginary tales of adventure  which, while they appeal to no real sentiment, and convey no solid  information, cannot compete for a moment with those sublime records of  what has been dared, done, and suffered, at the call of duty, and for  the sake of human interests by men who have really lived and died. I  do not say that all works of fiction are entirely without interest to  the human imagination, or that writers of some of these works are not  clever, for in one sense they certainly are, and that is, in only  writing of horrors that never occurred, without going through the  preliminary agony of a practical realisation of the dangers they so  graphically describe, and from which, perhaps, they might be the very  first to flee, though their heroes are made to appear nothing less  than demigods. Strange as it may appear, it seems because the tales of  Australian travel and self-devotion are true, that they attract but  little notice, for were the narratives of the explorers NOT true we  might become the most renowned novelists the world has ever known.  Again, Australian geography, as explained in the works of Australian  exploration, might be called an unlearned study. Let me ask how many  boys out of a hundred in Australia, or England either, have ever read  Sturt or Mitchell, Eyre, Leichhardt, Grey, or Stuart. It is possible a  few may have read Cook's voyages, because they appear more national,  but who has read Flinders, King, or Stokes? Is it because these  narratives are Australian and true that they are not worthy of  attention?    Having well-nigh exhausted the list of the early explorers in  Australia, it is necessary now to turn to a more modern school. I must  admit that in the works of this second section, with a few exceptions,  such stirring narratives as those of the older travellers cannot be  found. Nevertheless, considerable interest must still attach to them,  as they in reality carry on the burning torch which will not be  consumed until by its light the whole of Australia stands revealed.    The modern explorers are of a different class, and perhaps of one not  so high as their predecessors. By this remark I do not mean anything  invidious, and if any of the moderns are correctly to be classed with  the ancients, the Brothers Gregory must be spoken of next, as being  the fittest to head a secondary list. Augustus Gregory was in the West  Australian field of discovery in 1846. He was a great mechanical, as  well as a geographical, discoverer, for to him we are indebted for our  modern horses' pack-saddles in lieu of the dreadful old English  sumpter horse furniture that went by that name; he also invented a new  kind of compass known as Gregory's Patent, unequalled for steering on  horseback, and through dense scrubs where an ordinary compass would be  almost useless, while steering on camels in dense scrubs, on a given  bearing, without a Gregory would be next to impossible; it would be  far easier indeed, if not absolutely necessary, to walk and lead them,  which has to be done in almost all camel countries.    In 1854 Austin made a lengthened journey to the east and northwards,  from the old settled places of Western Australia, and in 1856 Augustus  Gregory conducted the North Australian Expedition, fitted out under  the auspices of the Royal Geographical Society of London. Landing at  Stokes's Treachery Bay, Gregory and his brother Frank explored  Stokes's Victoria River to its sources, and found another watercourse,  whose waters, running inland, somewhat revived the old theory of the  inland sea. Upon tracing this river, which he named Sturt's Creek,  after the father of Australian exploration, it was found to exhaust  itself in a circular basin, which was named Termination Lake.  Retracing the creek to where the depot was situated, the party  travelled across a stretch of unknown country for some two hundred  miles, and striking Leichhardt's Port Essington track on Leichhardt's  Roper River, his route was followed too closely for hundreds of miles  until civilisation was reached. My friend Baron von Mueller  accompanied this expedition as botanist, naturalist, surgeon and  physician.    Soon after his return from his northern expedition, Gregory was  despatched in 1858 by the Government of New South Wales to search  again for the lost explorer Leichhardt, who had then been missing ten  years. This expedition resulted in little or nothing, as far as its  main object was concerned, one or two trees, marked L, on the Barcoo  and lower end of the Thompson, was all it discovered; but,  geographically, it settled the question of the course of the Barcoo,  or Mitchell's Victoria, which Gregory followed past Kennedy's farthest  point, and traced until he found it identical with Sturt's Cooper's  Creek. He described it as being of enormous width in times of flood,  and two of Sturt's horses, abandoned since 1845, were seen but left  uncaptured. Sturt's Strezletki Creek in South Australian territory was  then followed. This peculiar watercourse branches out from the Cooper  and runs in a south-south-west direction. It brought Gregory safely to  the northern settlements of South Australia. The fruitless search for  it, however, was one of the main causes of the death of Burke and  Wills in 1861. This was Gregory's final attempt; he accepted the  position of Surveyor-General of Queensland, and his labours as an  explorer terminated. His journals are characterised by a brevity that  is not the soul of wit, he appearing to grudge to others the  information he had obtained at the expense of great endurance,  hardihood, knowledge, and judgment. Gregory was probably the closest  observer of all the explorers, except Mitchell, and an advanced  geologist.    In 1858 a new aspirant for geographical honours appeared on the field  in the person of John McDouall Stuart, of South Australia, who, as  before mentioned, had formerly been a member of Captain Sturt's  Central Australian expedition in 1843-5 as draftsman and surveyor.  Stuart's object was to cross the continent, almost in its greatest  width, from south to north; and this he eventually accomplished. After  three attempts he finally reached the north coast in 1862, his rival  Burke having been the first to do so. Stuart might have been first,  but he seems to have under-valued his rival, and wasted time in  returning and refitting when he might have performed the feat in two  if not one journey; for he discovered a well-wate"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4975"],[0,"Spinifex and Sand (#5)"],[1,"I were the first amateurs to get a job on the  great Reward Claim, though subsequently it became a regular harbour of  refuge for young men crowded out from the banks and offices of Sydney and  Melbourne. Nothing but a fabulously rich mine could have stood the  tinkering of so many unprofessional miners. It speaks well for the  kindness of heart of those at the head of the management of the mine that  they were willing to trust the unearthing of so much treasure to the hands  of boys unused to manual work, or to work of any kind in a great many  cases.    How rich the mine was, may be judged from the fact that for the first few  months the enormous production of gold from it was due to the labours of  three of the shareholders, assisted by only two other men. The following  letter from Mr. Everard Browne to Lord Douglas gives some idea of what the  yield was at the time that I went there to work:--    \"I am just taking 4,200 oz, over to Melbourne from our reef (Bayley's).  This makes 10,000 oz. we have brought down from our reef without a  battery, or machinery equal to treating 200 lbs. of stone per day; that is  a bit of a record for you! We have got water in our shaft at 137 feet,  enough to run a battery, and we shall have one on the ground in three  months' time or under, Egan dollied out 1,000 oz, in a little over two  months, before I came down, from his reef; and Cashman dollied 700 oz. out  of his in about three weeks and had one stone 10 lbs. weight with 9 lbs.  of gold in it, so we are not the only successful reefers since you left.  I hope you will soon be with us again.    \"If you are speaking about this 10,000 oz. we have taken out of our reef  in six months, remember that Bayley and Ford dollied out 2,500 oz. for  themselves before they handed it over to us on February 27th last, so that  actually 12,500 oz. have been taken out of the claim, without a battery,  in under nine months. The shoot of gold is now proved over 100 feet long  on the course of the reef, and we were down 52 feet in our shaft on the  reef, with as good gold as ever at the bottom. The other shaft, which we  have got water in, is in the country (a downright shaft). We expect to  meet the reef in it at 170 feet.\"    Besides Massie, myself, and Tom Cue, there were not then many employed,  and really we used to have rather an enjoyable time than otherwise.  Working regular hours, eight hours on and sixteen off, sometimes on the  surface, sometimes below, with hammer and drill, or pick and shovel,  always amongst glittering gold, was by no means unpleasant. It would  certainly have been better still had we been able to keep what we found,  but the next best thing to being successful is to see those one is fond  of, pile up their banking account; and I have had few better friends than  the resident shareholders on Bayley's Reward.    What good fellows, too, were the professional miners, always ready to help  one and make the time pass pleasantly. Big Jim Breen was my mate for some  time, and many a pleasant talk and smoke (Smoke, O! is a recognised rest  from work at intervals during a miner's shift) we have had at the bottom  of a shaft, thirty to fifty feet from the surface! I really think that  having to get out of a nice warm bed or tent for night shift, viz., from  midnight to 8 a.m., was the most unpleasant part of my life as a miner.    As recreation we used to play occasional games of cricket on a very hard  and uneven pitch, and for social entertainments had frequent sing-songs  and \"buck dances\"--that is, dances in which there were no ladies to take  part--at Faahan's Club Hotel in the town, some one and a half miles  distant. \"Hotel\" was rather too high-class a name, for it was by no means  an imposing structure, hessian and corrugated iron taking the place of the  bricks and slates of a more civilised building. The addition of a  weather-board front, which was subsequently erected, greatly enhanced its  attractions. Mr. Faahan can boast of having had the first two-storeyed  house in the town; though the too critical might hold that the upper one,  being merely a sham, could not be counted as dwelling-room. There was no  sham, however, about the festive character of those evening  entertainments.    Thus time went on, the only change in my circumstances resulting from my  promotion to engine-driver--for now the Reward Claim boasted a small  crushing plant--and Spring came, and with it in November the disastrous  rush to \"Siberia.\" This name, like most others on the goldfields, may be  traced to the wit of some disappointed digger.    The rush was a failure or \"frost,\" and so great a one that \"Siberia\" was  the only word adequately to express the chagrin of the men who hoped so  much from its discovery. Being one of these myself, I can cordially  endorse the appropriateness of the name. What a motley crowd of eager  faces throngs the streets and camp on the first news of a new rush--every  one anxious to be off and be the first to make his fortune--every man  questioning his neighbour, who knows no more than himself, about distances  and direction, where the nearest water may be, and all manner of similar  queries.    Once clear of the town, what a strange collection of baggage animals,  horses, camels, and donkeys! What a mass of carts, drays, buggies,  wheelbarrows, handbarrows, and many queer makeshifts for carrying  goods--the strangest of all a large barrel set on an axle, and dragged or  shoved by means of two long handles, the proud possessor's belongings  turning round and round inside until they must surely be churned into a  most confusing jumble. Then we see the \"Swagman\" with his load on his  back, perhaps fifty pounds of provisions rolled up in his blankets, with a  pick and shovel strapped on them, and in either hand a gallon bag of  water. No light work this with the thermometer standing at 100 degrees in  the shade, and the track inches deep in fine, powdery dust; and yet men  start off with a light heart, with perhaps, a two hundred mile journey  before them, replenishing their bundles as they pass through camps on  their road.      \"Siberia\" was said to be seventy miles of a dry stage, and yet off we all  started, as happy as kings at the chance of mending our fortunes.    Poor Crossman (since dead), McCulloch, and I were mates, and we were well  off, for we had not only \"Little Carnegie,\" and who, like his master, had  been earning his living at Bayley's, but a camel, \"Bungo\" by name, kindly  lent by Gordon Lyon. Thus we were able to carry water as well as  provisions, and helped to relieve the sufferings of many a poor wretch who  had only his feet to serve him.    The story of Siberia may be soon told. Hundreds \"rushed\" over this dry  stage, at the end of which a small and doubtful water supply was  obtainable. When this supply gave out fresh arrivals had to do their best  without it, the rush perforce had to set back again, privations, disaster,  and suffering being the only result. Much was said and written at the time  about the scores of dead and dying men and horses who lined the  roads--roads because there were two routes to the new field. There may  have been deaths on the other track, but I know that we saw none on ours.  Men in sore straits, with swollen tongues and bleeding feet, we saw, and,  happily, were able to relieve; and I am sure that many would have died but  for the prompt aid rendered by the Government Water Supply Department,  which despatched drays loaded with tanks of water to succour the suffering  miners. So the fortunes, to be made at Siberia, had again to be postponed.    Shortly after our return to Coolgardie a \"gold escort\" left Bayley's for  the coast, and as a guardian of the precious freight I travelled down to  Perth. There was no Government escort at that time, and any lucky  possessor of gold had to carry it to the capital as best he could.    With four spanking horses, Gordon Lyon as driver, three men with him on  the express-waggon, an outrider behind and in front, all armed with  repeating rifles, we rattled down the road, perhaps secretly wishing that  someone would be venturesome enough to attempt to \"stick us up.\" No such  stirring event occurred, however, and we reached the head of the then  partially constructed line, and there took train for Perth, where I  eagerly awaited the arrival of my old friend and companion, Percy Douglas.  He meanwhile had had his battles to fight in the financial world, and had  come out to all appearances on top, having been instrumental in forming an  important mining company from which we expected great things.            PART II     FIRST PROSPECTING EXPEDITION          CHAPTER I        THE RUSH TO KURNALPI--WE REACH QUEEN VICTORIA SPRING      Shortly after Lord Douglas's return, I took the train to York, where  \"Little Carnegie,\" who had formed one of the team to draw the gold-laden  express waggon from Bayley's to the head of the railway line, was running  in one of Mr. Monger's paddocks. The Mongers are the kings of York, an  agricultural town, and own much property thereabouts. York and its  surroundings in the winter-time might, except for the corrugated-iron  roofs, easily be in England. Many of the houses are built of stone, and  enclosed in vineyards and fruit gardens. The Mongers' house was quite  after the English style, so also was their hospitality. From York I rode  along the old track to Southern Cross, and a lonely ride I had, for the  train had superseded the old methods of travel, much to the disgust of  some of the \"cockies,\" or small farmers, who expressed the opinion that  the country was going to the dogs, \"them blooming railways were spoiling  everything\"; the reason for their complaint being, that formerly, all the  carrying had been in the teamsters' hands, as well as a considerable  amount of passenger traffic.    I had one or two \"sells\" on the road, for former stopping-places were now  deserted, "]]]
