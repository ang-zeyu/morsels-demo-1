Covered with desert sand and blood,  and fighting and raging after the manner of a Sikh, he could hold  ten companies together like a wall against a charge of Dervishes. The  bimbashi rejoiced at this, for he was a coward; likewise his captain  was a coward, and so was his lieutenant: for they were half Turks, half  Gippies, who had seen Paris and had not the decency to die there. Also  it had been discovered that no man made so good a spy or envoy as Seti.  His gift for lying was inexpressible: confusion never touched him;  for the flattest contradictions in the matter of levying backsheesh he  always found an excuse. Where the bimbashi and his officers were afraid  to go lest the bald-headed eagle and the vulture should carry away their  heads as tit-bits to the Libyan hills, Seti was sent. In more than one  way he always kept his head. He was at once the curse and the pride of  the regiment. For his sins he could not be punished, and his virtues  were of value only to save his life.    In this fashion, while his regiment thinned out by disease, famine,  fighting, and the midnight knife, Seti came on to Dongola, to Berber, to  Khartoum; and he grinned with satisfaction when he heard that they  would make even for Kordofan. He had outlived all the officers who left  Manfaloot with the regiment save the bimbashi, and the bimbashi  was superstitious and believed that while Seti lived he would live.  Therefore, no clansman ever watched his standard flying in the van as  the bimbashi--from behind--watched the long arm of Seti slaying, and  heard his voice like a brass horn above all others shouting his war-cry.    But at Khartoum came Seti's fall. Many sorts of original sin had been  his, with profit and prodigious pleasure, but when, by the supposed  orders of the bimbashi, he went through Khartoum levying a tax upon  every dancing-girl in the place and making her pay upon the spot at the  point of a merciless tongue, he went one step too far. For his genius  had preceded that of Selamlik Pasha, the friend of the Mouffetish  at Cairo, by one day only. Selamlik himself had collected taxes on  dancing-girls all the way from Cairo to Khartoum; and to be hoist by  an Arab in a foot regiment having no authority and only a limitless  insolence, was more than the Excellency could bear.    To Selamlik Pasha the bimbashi hastily disowned all knowledge of Seti's  perfidy, but both were brought out to have their hands and feet and  heads cut off in the Beit-el-Mal, in the presence of the dancing-girls  and the populace. In the appointed place, when Seti saw how the bimbashi  wept--for he had been to Paris and had no Arab blood in him; how he  wrung his hands--for had not absinthe weakened his nerves in the cafes  of St. Michel?--when Seti saw that he was no Arab and was afraid to die,  then he told the truth to Selamlik Pasha. He even boldly offered to tell  the pasha where half his own ill-gotten gains were hid, if he would  let the bimbashi go. Now, Selamlik Pasha was an Egyptian, and is it  not written in the Book of Egypt that no man without the most dangerous  reason may refuse backsheesh? So it was that Selamlik talked to the  Ulema, the holy men, who were there, and they urged him to clemency, as  holy men will, even in Egypt--at a price.    So it was also that the bimbashi went back to his regiment with all his  limbs intact. Seti and the other half of his ill-gotten gains were left.  His hands were about to be struck off, when he realised of how little  account his gold would be without them; so he offered it to Selamlik  Pasha for their sake. The pasha promised, and then, having found the  money, serenely prepared the execution. For his anger was great. Was not  the idea of taxing the dancing-girls his very own, the most original tax  ever levied in Egypt? And to have the honour of it filched from him by a  soldier of Manfaloot--no, Mahommed Seti should be crucified!    And Seti, the pride and the curse of his regiment, would have been  crucified between two palms on the banks of the river had it not been  for Fielding Bey, the Englishman--Fielding of St. Bartholomew's--who had  burned gloriously to reform Egypt root and branch, and had seen the  fire of his desires die down. Fielding Bey saved Seti, but not with  backsheesh.    Fielding intervened. He knew Selamlik Pasha well, and the secret of his  influence over him is for telling elsewhere. But whatever its source, it  gave Mahommed Seti his life. It gave him much more, for it expelled him  from the Khedive's army. Now soldiers without number, gladly risking  death, had deserted from the army of the Khedive; they had bought  themselves out with enormous backsheesh, they had been thieves,  murderers, panderers, that they might be freed from service by some  corrupt pasha or bimbashi; but no one in the knowledge of the world had  ever been expelled from the army of the Khedive.    There was a satanic humour in the situation pleasant to the soul of  Mahommed Seti, if soul his subconsciousness might be called. In the  presence of his regiment, drawn up in the Beit-el-Mal, before his  trembling bimbashi, whose lips were now pale with terror at the loss of  his mascot, Mahommed Seti was drummed out of line, out of his regiment,  out of the Beit-el-Mal. It was opera boufe, and though Seti could  not know what opera boufe was, he did know that it was a ridiculous  fantasia, and he grinned his insolent grin all the way, even to the  corner of the camel-market, where the drummer and the sergeant and his  squad turned back from ministering a disgrace they would gladly have  shared.    Left at the corner of the camel-market, Mahommed Seti planned his  future. At first it was to steal a camel and take the desert for Berber.  Then he thought of the English hakim, Fielding Bey, who had saved his  life. Now, a man who has saved your life once may do it again; one  favour is always the promise of another. So Seti, with a sudden  inspiration, went straight to the house of Fielding Bey and sat down  before it on his mat.    With the setting of the sun came a clatter of tins and a savoury odour  throughout Khartoum to its farthest precincts, for it was Ramadan, and  no man ate till sunset. Seti smiled an avid smile, and waited. At last  he got up, turned his face towards Mecca, and said his prayers. Then he  lifted the latch of Fielding's hut, entered, eyed the medicine bottles  and the surgical case with childish apprehension, and made his way to  the kitchen. There he foraged. He built a fire; his courage grew; he ran  to the bazaar, and came back with an armful of meats and vegetables.    So it was that when Fielding returned he found Mahommed Seti and a  savoury mess awaiting him. Also there was coffee and a bottle of brandy  which Seti had looted in the bazaar. In one doorway stood Fielding; in  another stood Mahommed Seti, with the same grin which had served  his purpose all the way from Cairo, his ugly face behind it, and his  prodigious shoulders below it, and the huge chest from which came forth,  like the voice of a dove:    \"God give thee long life, saadat el bey!\"    Now an M.D. degree and a course in St. Bartholomew's Hospital do not  necessarily give a knowledge of the human soul, though the outlying  lands of the earth have been fattened by those who thought there  was knowledge and salvation in a conquered curriculum. Fielding Bey,  however, had never made pretence of understanding the Oriental mind, so  he discreetly took his seat and made no remarks. From sheer instinct,  however, when he came to the coffee he threw a boot which caught  Mahommed Seti in the middle of the chest, and said roughly: \"French, not  Turkish, idiot!\"    Then Mahommed Seti grinned, and he knew that he was happy; for it was  deep in his mind that that was the Inglesi's way of offering a long  engagement. In any case Seti had come to stay. Three times he made  French coffee that night before it suited, and the language of Fielding  was appropriate in each case. At last a boot, a native drum, and a  wood sculpture of Pabst the lion-headed goddess, established perfect  relations between them. They fell into their places of master and man as  accurately as though the one had smitten and the other served for twenty  years.    The only acute differences they had were upon two points--the cleaning  of the medicine bottles and surgical instruments, and the looting. But  it was wonderful to see how Mahommed Seti took the kourbash at the hands  of Fielding, when he shied from the medicine bottles. He could have  broken, or bent double with one twist, the weedy, thin-chested Fielding.  But though he saw a deadly magic and the evil eye in every stopper, and  though to him the surgical instruments were torturing steels which the  devil had forged for his purposes, he conquered his own prejudices so  far as to assist in certain bad cases which came in Fielding's way on  the journey down the Nile.    The looting was a different matter. Had not Mahommed Seti looted all his  life--looted from his native village to the borders of Kordofan? Did  he not take to foray as a wild ass to bersim? Moreover, as little Dicky  Donovan said humorously yet shamelessly when he joined them at Korosko:  \"What should a native do but loot who came from Manfaloot?\"    Dicky had a prejudice against the Murderer, because he was a murderer;  and Mahommed Seti viewed with scorn any white man who was not Fielding;  much more so one who was only five feet and a trifle over. So for a time  there was no sympathy between the two. But each conquered the other in  the end. Seti was conquered first.    One day Dicky, with a sudden burst of generosity--for he had a button  to his pocket--gave"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6267"],[0,"The Weavers: a tale of England and Egypt of fifty years ago - Complete (#5)"],[1,"were in the tone. He paused a moment after this, and seemed  questioning what to play. And as he stood, the flute in his hands, his  thoughts took flight to his Uncle Benn, whose kindly, shrewd face and  sharp brown eyes were as present to him, and more real, than those of  Luke Claridge, whom he saw every day. Of late when he had thought of  his uncle, however, alternate depression and lightness of spirit had  possessed him. Night after night he had troubled sleep, and he had  dreamed again and again that his uncle knocked at his door, or came and  stood beside his bed and spoke to him. He had wakened suddenly and said  \"Yes\" to a voice which seemed to call to him.    Always his dreams and imaginings settled round his Uncle Benn, until  he had found himself trying to speak to the little brown man across the  thousand leagues of land and sea. He had found, too, in the past that  when he seemed to be really speaking to his uncle, when it seemed  as though the distance between them had been annihilated, that soon  afterwards there came a letter from him. Yet there had not been more  than two or three a year. They had been, however, like books of many  pages, closely written, in Arabic, in a crabbed characteristic hand, and  full of the sorrow and grandeur and misery of the East. How many books  on the East David had read he would hardly have been able to say; but  something of the East had entered into him, something of the philosophy  of Mahomet and Buddha, and the beauty of Omar Khayyam had given a  touch of colour and intellect to the narrow faith in which he had been  schooled. He had found himself replying to a question asked of him in  Heddington, as to how he knew that there was a God, in the words of a  Muslim quoted by his uncle: \"As I know by the tracks in the sand whether  a Man or Beast has passed there, so the heaven with its stars, the earth  with its fruits, show me that God has passed.\" Again, in reply to the  same question, the reply of the same Arab sprang to his lips--\"Does the  Morning want a Light to see it by?\"    As he stood with his flute--his fingers now and then caressingly rising  and falling upon its little caverns, his mind travelled far to those  regions he had never seen, where his uncle traded, and explored.  Suddenly, the call he had heard in his sleep now came to him in this  waking reverie. His eyes withdrew from the tree at the window, as if  startled, and he almost called aloud in reply; but he realised where  he was. At last, raising the flute to his lips, as the eyes of Luke  Claridge closed with very trouble, he began to play.    Out in the woods of Beedon he had attuned his flute to the stir of  leaves, the murmur of streams, the song of birds, the boom and burden  of storm; and it was soft and deep as the throat of the bell-bird of  Australian wilds. Now it was mastered by the dreams he had dreamed  of the East: the desert skies, high and clear and burning, the desert  sunsets, plaintive and peaceful and unvaried--one lovely diffusion, in  which day dies without splendour and in a glow of pain. The long velvety  tread of the camel, the song of the camel-driver, the monotonous chant  of the river-man, with fingers mechanically falling on his little drum,  the cry of the eagle of the Libyan Hills, the lap of the heavy waters  of the Dead Sea down by Jericho, the battle-call of the Druses beyond  Damascus, the lonely gigantic figures at the mouth of the temple of Abou  Simbel, looking out with the eternal question to the unanswering desert,  the delicate ruins of moonlit Baalbec, with the snow mountains hovering  above, the green oases, and the deep wells where the caravans lay down  in peace--all these were pouring their influences on his mind in the  little Quaker village of Hamley where life was so bare, so grave.    The music he played was all his own, was instinctively translated from  all other influences into that which they who listened to him could  understand. Yet that sensuous beauty which the Quaker Society was so  concerned to banish from any part in their life was playing upon them  now, making the hearts of the women beat fast, thrilling them, turning  meditation into dreams, and giving the sight of the eyes far visions  of pleasure. So powerful was this influence that the shrill Elder twice  essayed to speak in protest, but was prevented by the wizened Elder  Meacham. When it seemed as if the aching, throbbing sweetness must  surely bring denunciation, David changed the music to a slow mourning  cadence. It was a wail of sorrow, a march to the grave, a benediction,  a soft sound of farewell, floating through the room and dying away into  the mid-day sun.    There came a long silence after, and David sat with unmoving look upon  the distant prospect through the window. A woman's sob broke the air.  Faith's handkerchief was at her eyes. Only one quick sob, but it  had been wrung from her by the premonition suddenly come that the  brother--he was brother more than nephew--over whom her heart had  yearned had, indeed, come to the cross-roads, and that their ways would  henceforth divide. The punishment or banishment now to be meted out to  him was as nothing. It meant a few weeks of disgrace, of ban, of what,  in effect, was self-immolation, of that commanding justice of the  Society which no one yet save the late Earl of Eglington had defied.  David could refuse to bear punishment, but such a possibility had never  occurred to her or to any one present. She saw him taking his punishment  as surely as though the law of the land had him in its grasp. It was not  that which she was fearing. But she saw him moving out of her life. To  her this music was the prelude of her tragedy.    A moment afterwards Luke Claridge arose and spoke to David in austere  tones: \"It is our will that thee begone to the chair-maker's but upon  the hill till three months be passed, and that none have speech with  thee after sunset to-morrow even.\"    \"Amen,\" said all the Elders.    \"Amen,\" said David, and put his flute into his pocket, and rose to go.          CHAPTER III. BANISHED    The chair-maker's hut lay upon the north hillside about half-way between  the Meeting-house at one end of the village and the common at the other  end. It commanded the valley, had no house near it, and was sheltered  from the north wind by the hill-top which rose up behind it a hundred  feet or more. No road led to it--only a path up from the green of the  village, winding past a gulley and the deep cuts of old rivulets now  over grown by grass or bracken. It got the sun abundantly, and it was  protected from the full sweep of any storm. It had but two rooms, the  floor was of sanded earth, but it had windows on three sides, east,  west, and south, and the door looked south. Its furniture was a plank  bed, a few shelves, a bench, two chairs, some utensils, a fireplace  of stone, a picture of the Virgin and Child, and of a cardinal of the  Church of Rome with a red hat--for the chair-maker had been a Roman  Catholic, the only one of that communion in Hamley. Had he been a  Protestant his vices would have made him anathema, but, being what he  was, his fellow-villagers had treated him with kindness.    After the half-day in which he was permitted to make due preparations,  lay in store of provisions, and purchase a few sheep and hens, hither  came David Claridge. Here, too, came Faith, who was permitted one hour  with him before he began his life of willing isolation. Little was said  as they made the journey up the hill, driving the sheep before them,  four strong lads following with necessities--flour, rice, potatoes, and  suchlike.    Arrived, the goods were deposited inside the hut, the lads were  dismissed, and David and Faith were left alone. David looked at his  watch. They had still a handful of minutes before the parting. These  flew fast, and yet, seated inside the door, and looking down at the  village which the sun was bathing in the last glowing of evening,  they remained silent. Each knew that a great change had come in their  hitherto unchanging life, and it was difficult to separate premonition  from substantial fact. The present fact did not represent all they felt,  though it represented all on which they might speak together now.    Looking round the room, at last Faith said: \"Thee has all thee needs,  David? Thee is sure?\"    He nodded. \"I know not yet how little man may need. I have lived in  plenty.\"    At that moment her eyes rested on the Cloistered House.    \"The Earl of Eglington would not call it plenty.\" A shade passed over  David's face. \"I know not how he would measure. Is his own field so  wide?\"    \"The spread of a peacock's feather.\"    \"What does thee know of him?\" David asked the question absently.    \"I have eyes to see, Davy.\" The shadows from that seeing were in her  eyes as she spoke, but he did not observe them.    \"Thee sees but with half an eye,\" she continued. \"With both mine I have  seen horses and carriages, and tall footmen, and wine and silver, and  gilded furniture, and fine pictures, and rolls of new carpet--of Uncle  Benn's best carpets, Davy--and a billiard-table, and much else.\"    A cloud slowly gathered over David's face, and he turned to her with an  almost troubled surprise. \"Thee has seen these things--and how?\"    \"One day--thee was in Devon--one of the women was taken ill. They sent  for me because the woman asked it. She was a Papist; but she begged that  I should go with her to the hospital, as there was no time to send  to Heddington for a nurse. She had seen me once in the house of the  toll-gate keeper. Ill as she was, I could have laughed, for, as we went  in the Earl's carriage to the hospital-thirty miles it was--she said she  felt at home with me, my dress being so like a nun's. It was then I saw  the Cloistered House within and learned what was afoot.\"    \"In the Earl's carriage indeed--and the Earl?\"    \"He was in Ireland,"]]]
