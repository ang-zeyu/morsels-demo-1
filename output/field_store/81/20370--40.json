Then again the  higher the resistance of the receivers the more sensitive they often  are and those wound to as high a resistance as 3,200 ohms are made for  use with the best sets. To make the incoming signals, conversation or  music, audible to a room full of people instead of to just yourself  you must use what is called a _loud speaker_. In its simplest form  this consists of a metal cone like a megaphone to which is fitted a  telephone receiver.    About Transmitting Stations--Getting Your License.--If you are going  to install a wireless sending apparatus, either telegraphic or  telephonic, you will have to secure a government license for which no  fee or charge of any kind is made. There are three classes of licenses  issued to amateurs who want to operate transmitting stations and these  are: (1) the _restricted amateur license_, (2) the _general amateur  license_, and (3) the _special amateur license_.    If you are going to set up a transmitter within five nautical miles of  any naval wireless station then you will have to get a _restricted  amateur license_ which limits the current you use to half a _kilowatt_  [Footnote: A _Kilowatt_ is 1,000 _watts_. There are 746 watts in a  horsepower.] and the wave length you send out to 200 _meters_. Should  you live outside of the five-mile range of a navy station then you can  get a general amateur license and this permits you to use a current of  1 kilowatt, but you are likewise limited to a wave length of 200  meters. But if you can show that you are doing some special kind of  wireless work and not using your sending station for the mere pleasure  you are getting out of it you may be able to get a _special amateur  license_ which gives you the right to send out wave lengths up to 375  meters.    When you are ready to apply for your license write to the _Radio  Inspector_ of whichever one of the following districts you live in:      First District..............Boston, Mass.    Second   \"    ..............New York City    Third    \"    ..............Baltimore, Md.    Fourth   \"    ..............Norfolk, Va.    Fifth    \"    ..............New Orleans, La.    Sixth    \"    ............. San Francisco, Cal.    Seventh  \"    ............. Seattle, Wash.    Eighth   \"    ............. Detroit, Mich.    Ninth    \"    ..............Chicago, Ill.    Kinds of Transmitters.--There are two general types of transmitters  used for sending out wireless messages and these are: (1) _wireless  telegraph_ transmitters, and (2) _wireless telephone_ transmitters.  Telegraph transmitters may use either: (a) a _jump-spark_, (b) an  _electric arc_, or (c) a _vacuum tube_ apparatus for sending out dot  and dash messages, while telephone transmitters may use either, (a) an  _electric arc_, or (b) a _vacuum tube_ for sending out vocal and  musical sounds. Amateurs generally use a _jump-spark_ for sending  wireless telegraph messages and the _vacuum tube_ for sending wireless  telephone messages.    The Spark Gap Wireless Telegraph Transmitter.--The simplest kind of a  wireless telegraph transmitter consists of: (1) a _source of direct or  alternating current_, (2) a _telegraph key_, (3) a _spark-coil_ or a  _transformer_, (4) a _spark gap_, (5) an _adjustable condenser_ and  (6) an _oscillation transformer_. Where _dry cells_ or a _storage  battery_ must be used to supply the current for energizing the  transmitter a spark-coil can be employed and these may be had in  various sizes from a little fellow which gives 1/4-inch spark up to a  larger one which gives a 6-inch spark. Where more energy is needed it  is better practice to use a transformer and this can be worked on an  alternating current of 110 volts, or if only a 110 volt direct current  is available then an _electrolytic interrupter_ must be used to make  and break the current. A simple transmitting set with an induction  coil is shown in Fig. 2.    [Illustration: Fig 2.--Simple Transmitting Set.]    A wireless key is made like an ordinary telegraph key except that  where large currents are to be used it is somewhat heavier and is  provided with large silver contact points. Spark gaps for amateur work  are usually of: (1) the _plain_ or _stationary type_, (2) the  _rotating type_, and (3) the _quenched gap_ type. The plain spark-gap  is more suitable for small spark-coil sets, and it is not so apt to  break down the transformer and condenser of the larger sets as the  rotary gap. The rotary gap on the other hand tends to prevent _arcing_  and so the break is quicker and there is less dragging of the spark.  The quenched gap is more efficient than either the plain or rotary gap  and moreover it is noiseless.    Condensers for spark telegraph transmitters can be ordinary Leyden  jars or glass plates coated with tin or copper foil and set into a  frame, or they can be built up of mica and sheet metal embedded in an  insulating composition. The glass plate condensers are the cheapest  and will serve your purpose well, especially if they are immersed in  oil. Tuning coils, sometimes called _transmitting inductances_ and  _oscillation transformers_, are of various types. The simplest kind is  a transmitting inductance which consists of 25 or 30 turns of copper  wire wound on an insulating tube or frame. An oscillation transformer  is a loose coupled tuning coil and it consists of a primary coil  formed of a number of turns of copper wire wound on a fixed insulating  support, and a secondary coil of about twice the number of turns of  copper wire which is likewise fixed in an insulating support, but the  coils are relatively movable. An _oscillation transformer_ (instead of  a _tuning coil_), is required by government regulations unless  _inductively coupled_.    The Vacuum Tube Telegraph Transmitter.--This consists of: (1) a  _source of direct or alternating current_, (2) a _telegraph key_, (3) a  _vacuum tube oscillator_, (4) a _tuning coil_, and (5) a _condenser_.  This kind of a transmitter sets up _sustained_ oscillations instead of  _periodic_ oscillations which are produced by a spark gap set. The  advantages of this kind of a system will be found explained in Chapter  XVI.    The Wireless Telephone Transmitter.--Because a jump-spark sets up  _periodic oscillations_, that is, the oscillations are discontinuous,  it cannot be used for wireless telephony. An electric arc or a vacuum  tube sets up _sustained_ oscillations, that is, oscillations which are  continuous. As it is far easier to keep the oscillations going with a  vacuum tube than it is with an arc the former means has all but  supplanted the latter for wireless telephone transmitters. The  apparatus required and the connections used for wireless telephone  sets will be described in later chapters.    Useful Information.--It would be wise for the reader to turn to the  Appendix, beginning with page 301 of this book, and familiarize  himself with the information there set down in tabular and graphic  form. For example, the first table gives abbreviations of electrical  terms which are in general use in all works dealing with the subject.  You will also find there brief definitions of electric and magnetic  units, which it would be well to commit to memory; or, at least, to  make so thoroughly your own that when any of these terms is mentioned,  you will know instantly what is being talked about.          CHAPTER II    PUTTING UP YOUR AERIAL      As inferred in the first chapter, an aerial for receiving does not  have to be nearly as well made or put up as one for sending. But this  does not mean that you can slipshod the construction and installation  of it, for however simple it is, the job must be done right and in  this case it is as easy to do it right as wrong.    To send wireless telegraph and telephone messages to the greatest  distances and to receive them as distinctly as possible from the  greatest distances you must use for your aerial (1) copper or aluminum  wire, (2) two or more wires, (3) have them the proper length, (4) have  them as high in the air as you can, (5) have them well apart from each  other, and (6) have them well insulated from their supports. If you  live in a flat building or an apartment house you can string your  aerial wires from one edge of the roof to the other and support them  by wooden stays as high above it as may be convenient.    Should you live in a detached house in the city you can usually get  your next-door neighbor to let you fasten one end of the aerial to his  house and this will give you a good stretch and a fairly high aerial.  In the country you can stretch your wires between the house and barn  or the windmill. From this you will see that no matter where you live  you can nearly always find ways and means of putting up an aerial that  will serve your needs without going to the expense of erecting a mast.    Kinds of Aerial Wire Systems.--An amateur wireless aerial can be  anywhere from 25 feet to 100 feet long and if you can get a stretch of  the latter length and a height of from 30 to 75 feet you will have one  with which you can receive a thousand miles or more and send out as  much energy as the government will allow you to send.    The kind of an aerial that gives the best results is one whose wire,  or wires, are _horizontal_, that is, parallel with the earth under it  as shown at A in Fig. 3. If only one end can be fixed to some elevated  support then you can secure the other end to a post in the ground, but  the slope of the aerial should not be more than 30 or 35 degrees from  the horizontal at most as shown at B.    [Illustration: (A) Fig. 3.--Flat top, or Horizontal Aerial.]    [Illustration: (B) Fig. 3.--Inclined Aerial.]    The _leading-in wire_, that is, the wire that leads from and joins the  aerial wire with your sending and receiving set, can be connected to  the aerial anywhere it is most convenient to do so, but the best"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6948"],[0,"The Secrets of the German War Office (#5)"],[1," new kind of gun  or data on a new and minor fortification.  Mr. Vance Thompson has also  cited special missions like this one that follows.    Not often does the chance come to leave the regular channels of  espionage and go forth upon a mission out of the ordinary.  That  chance came a few years ago to the Russian agents in Brussels.  In  St. Petersburg the chiefs were desirous of knowing the identity and  names of a group of revolutionists who had formed a sort of colony in  Montreux, Switzerland.  A French woman, known sometimes as Theresa  Prevost (the last I heard of her she was in prison) was detailed to  the mission.  Young and clever was Theresa; likewise the man who was  ordered to accompany her, posing as a \"brother,\" Charles Prevost.    The chief of these Russian fugitives, who were down around the lake of  Geneva, brewing their dark plans, was known.  He was Goluckoffsky, and  he had a son twenty-two years of age--an impressionable Russian son.  Hence the young and pretty Theresa.    It was decided by her Brussels chiefs that she assume the role of an  heiress from Canada.  Five thousand francs for preliminary expenses  were handed over to her and with Charles, the brother, she descended  upon Montreux.  If you were there at the time you will recall the  social triumph made by the young Canadian heiress.  You may even  remember that she seemed to be infatuated with the young  impressionable son of old Goluckoffsky.  The day long they were  together.  They were going to be married, and Charles Prevost the  \"brother,\" stood in the background, chatted amiably with old  Goluckoffsky and his friends and smiled.    Then as an heiress should, Theresa and her \"brother\" invited  Goluckoffsky, his family and friends, to a pre-nuptial luncheon.  No  expense was spared, for the wires had moaned with requests sent to  Brussels for money.  Young Goluckoffsky was delighted with his  fiancÃ©e.  She was insistent that _all_ his friends should be there,  all the revolutionaries--although of course his dear Theresa did not  know that.  How the spelling of their names puzzled her.  With gay  heart young Goluckoffsky wrote out all their names on a slip of paper  so she could send their invitations properly--the names St. Petersburg  wanted to know.    Came the day of the luncheon, a gala affair in the banquet room of the  hotel.  Theresa looked charming; even the grimmest of the old  revolutionists were taken with her.  Old Goluckoffsky beamed upon this  sparkling febrile woman, rich too, who was to marry his son.    Ices had been served when Theresa, her pretty face in smiles, declared  that she had a surprise for her guests.  To her it was the day of  days.  What better than a group photograph of her dear and new  friends?  How she would treasure it!  Strangely enough this did not  please the guests.  Photographs were dangerous.  Suppose, in some way,  the _Okrana_ got hold of them.  They breathed easier, though, when  Theresa, calling in the photographer--the best in Lausanne, she  assured them--instructed him to deliver all copies to  Mr. Goluckoffsky, her dear father-in-law to be.  So the revolutionists  grouped themselves on the hotel lawn; the photographer pressed the  bulb; and everybody laughed.    As quickly as the photographer could print his proofs they were  delivered to Theresa; that night she and her \"brother\" left Montreux.  In two days the names of all the revolutionists in young  Goluckoffsky's handwriting and their pictures were delivered to the  chief in Brussels.  A substantial fee was paid Theresa, besides, and  she must have smiled; some of those young Russians are delightful.    So much for an example of the clever work done by Brussels.  The  German Service, in which I served on and off for twelve years, has  three distinct branches--the Army, Navy and Personal, each branch  having its own chief and its own corps of men and women agents.  The  Army and Navy division is controlled by the General Staff of Berlin  (Grosser General Stabe), the most marvelous organization in the world.  The Political and Personal branch is controlled from the  Wilhelmstrasse, the German Foreign Office, the Emperor in person, or  his immediate Privy Councilor.  The Army and Navy divisions confine  themselves to the procuring of hidden and secret information as  regards armaments, plans, discoveries, etc.  The political branch  concerns itself with the supervision of meetings between potentates,  cabinet ministers and so forth.  The Personal branch, under the direct  control of the Privy Councilor, is used by the Emperor for his own  special purposes and service in this branch is the _sine qua non_ of  the service.    The Personal consists of all classes of men and women.  Princes and  counts, lawyers and doctors, actors and actresses, mondaines of the  great world, demi-mondaines of the half world, waiters and porters,  all are made use of as occasion arises.  It may well happen that your  interesting acquaintance in the salon of an express steamer or your  charming companion in the tearoom of the Ritz is the paid agent of  some government.  Great singers, dancers and artists, especially of  Russian and Austrian origin, are often spies.  Notably Anna Pavlowa,  famous for light feet and nimble wit, said wit being retained by the  Russian government at 50,000 rubles per annum.  When Mlle. Pavlowa  travels in Germany, she has the honor of a very unostentatious  bodyguard, the government being anxious that nothing should happen to  _them_.  Perhaps Mademoiselle may remember a little incident at the  Palais de Dance in Berlin--Anna _vs._ He of Lichtenstein.    Or perhaps Mademoiselle will recall a little episode in the Eis Arena  in Berlin during a certain New Year's Eve carnival when the  restoration--not the loss--of her magnificent gold chatelaine bag  caused her much embarrassment.  The chatelaine in question being  dexterously commandeered by an expert in such matters of the Secret  Service squad.    It happened that the Personal Branch of the German Secret Service was  exceedingly interested in that gold bag.  Mademoiselle had been  carrying on an affair with a young ordnance officer of the Potsdam  garrison.  Now the Service does not like to see officers, especially  those of the ordnance, becoming involved with ladies like the Pavlowa.  On this particular night he had presented her with the new bag and she  had been injudicious enough to have kept in the golden receptacle a  dangerously compromising letter that he had enclosed.  Injudicious,  dear lady!  Corsage or stockings, Mademoiselle; but vanity  bags--never!    I have reason to believe that the following incident cost the Pavlowa  a rather remunerative engagement in Berlin.    Celebrating the coming of the New Year, Mademoiselle and her party  were feasting in the Ice Arena.  I happened to be at near-by table,  and saw everything; as well as later hearing the inside of it.    The gold chatelaine lay on the table at her elbow.  Upon observing its  position, the waiter--a secret agent on the case--deliberately tipped  over a champagne glass that stood within a few inches of the bag.  Of  course, Mademoiselle was worried lest the wine run over on her gown  and while thus preoccupied, the waiter, stammering apologies, mopped  up the table cloth with his serviette--mopped up the wine and cleverly  covering the bag folded it in the napkin and hurried away.  In two  minutes he had opened it, abstracted the letter from the young  ordnance officer; and was back, apologizing to the Pavlowa.    \"Your pardon, Mademoiselle,\" he said, handing her the gold  chatelaine.\"  In my haste I picked up this bag by mistake.  I suppose  it is yours.\"    With a slight start she said \"yes,\" took the bag and hurriedly opening  it felt for the letter.  To her dismay it was gone.  I saw her eyes  narrow a little and then I marveled at time cleverness of the woman.    \"No,\" she suddenly said, \"that is not my bag.  I never saw it before.  I advise you to find the owner.\"    Clever Anna!  You sacrificed the costly gift, but you went over the  frontier just the same.    The necessary qualifications of an agent vary of course with the class  of work to be done.  We can dismiss the waiter and porter class, as  they never receive independent commands and work only under direct  supervision on minor details without knowing why.  The trusted agent  handling important matters and documents must needs be a person of  intelligence, tact and address.  He must be a linguist and, above all,  a man of resource and a close student of his fellow men.  In the woman  agent charm and tact, beauty and manners, _Ã  la grande dame_,  knowledge of the world and men are essential.  The pay varies, but is  always good.  Expenses are never questioned, the money being no  object.  For instance, I spent on a mission through the Riviera 20,000  marks in fourteen days.  My fixed salary towards the end was 10,000  marks a year, besides twenty marks a day living expenses when not at  work, which was automatically tripled irrespective of expenses when  out on work.  Besides, there is a bonus set out for each piece of  work, the amount of which varies with the importance of the case in  hand.  I received as much as 30,000 marks ($7,500) for a single  mission performed successfully.    The risks are great, so are the rewards--if successful.  If not, then  one pays the usual price of failures, in this case only more so.  For  in the event of disaster no official help or protection could or would  be granted and quarter is neither asked nor given.  The work is  interesting and fascinating to those of an adventurous turn of mind  and not overly nervous about their health or squeamish in regards to  established ethics.  I would not suggest the Secret Service as a means  of livelihood for a nervous person.  At times it is arduous and  strenuous work and mostly undertaken by men and women who fear neither  man nor devil.  It"]]]
