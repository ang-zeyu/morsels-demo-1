The  next moment a long arm, with a claw at the end of it, was poked  through the window-hole, to seize the colt.    Instantly the man drew his sword and with one blow, the claw part of  the arm was cut off, and it dropped inside, with the colt.    Hearing a great cry and tumult outside, the owner of the mare rushed  forth into the darkness. But though he heard howls of pain, he could  see nothing, so he returned.    There, at the door, he found a baby, with hair as yellow as gold,  smiling at him. Besides its swaddling clothes, it was wrapped up in  flame-colored satin.    As it was still night, the man took the infant to his bed and laid it  alongside of his wife, who was asleep.    Now this good woman loved children, though she had none of her own,  and so when she woke up in the morning, and saw what was beside her,  she was very happy. Then she resolved to pretend that it was her own.    So she told her women, that she had borne the child, and they called  him Gwri of the Golden Hair.    The boy baby grew up fast, and when only two years old, was as strong  as most children are at six.    Soon he was able to ride the colt that had been born on the May night,  and the two were as playmates together.    Now it chanced, the man had heard the tale of Queen Rhiannon, wife of  Powell, Prince of Dyfed. She had become the mother of a baby boy, but  it was stolen from her at night.    The six serving women, whose duty it was to attend to the Queen, and  guard her child, were lazy and had neglected their duty. They were  asleep when the baby was stolen away. To excuse themselves and be  saved from punishment, they invented a lying story. They declared that  Rhiannon had devoured the child, her own baby.    The wise men of the Court believed the story which the six wicked  women had told, and Rhiannon, the Queen, though innocent, was  condemned to do penance. She was to serve as a porter to carry  visitors and their baggage from out doors into the castle.    Every day, for many months, through the hours of daylight, she stood  in public disgrace in front of the castle of Narberth, at the stone  block, on which riders on horses dismounted from the saddle. When  anyone got off at the gate, she had to carry him or her on her back  into the hall.    As the boy grew up, his foster father scanned his features closely,  and it was not long before he made up his mind that Powell was his  father and Rhiannon was his mother.    One day, with the boy riding on his colt, and with two knights keeping  him company, the owner of the Co-ed mare came near the castle of  Narberth.    There they saw the beautiful Rhiannon sitting on the horse block at  the gate.    When they were about to dismount from their horses, the lovely woman  spoke to them thus:    \"Chieftains, go no further thus. I will carry everyone of you on my  back, into the palace.\"    Seeing their looks of astonishment, she explained:    \"This is my penance for the charge brought against me of slaying my  son and devouring him.\"    One and all the four refused to be carried and went into the castle on  their own feet. There Powell, the prince, welcomed them and made a  feast in their honor. It being night, Rhiannon sat beside him.    After dinner when the time for story telling had come, the chief guest  told the tale of his mare and the colt, and how he cut the clawed  hand, and then found the boy on the doorstep.    Then to the joy and surprise of all, the owner of the Co-ed mare,  putting the golden-haired boy before Rhiannon, cried out:    \"Behold lady, here is thy son, and whoever they were who told the  story and lied about your devouring your own child, have done you a  grievous wrong.\"    Everyone at the table looked at the boy, and all recognized the lad at  once as the child of Powell and Rhiannon.    \"Here ends my trouble (pryderi),\" cried out Rhiannon.    Thereupon one of the chiefs said:    \"Well hast thou named thy child 'Trouble,'\" and henceforth Pryderi was  his name.    Soon it was made known, by the vision and word of the bards and seers,  that all the mischief had been wrought by wicked fairies, and that the  six serving women had been under their spell, when they lied about the  Queen. Powell, the castle-lord, was so happy that he offered the man  of Co-ed rich gifts of horses, jewels and dogs.    But this good man felt repaid in delivering a pure woman and loving  mother from undeserved shame and disgrace, by wisdom and honesty  according to common duty.    As for Pryderi, he was educated as a king's son ought to be, in all  gentle arts and was trained in all manly exercises.    After his father died, Pryderi became ruler of the realm. He married  Kieva the daughter of a powerful chieftain, who had a pedigree as long  as the bridle used to drive a ten-horse chariot. It reached back to  Prince Casnar of Britain.    Pryderi had many adventures, which are told in the Mabinogian, which  is the great storehouse of Welsh hero, wonder, and fairy tales.          VI      THE GOLDEN HARP      Morgan is one of the oldest names in Cymric land. It means one who  lives near the sea.    Every day, for centuries past, tens of thousands of Welsh folks have  looked out on the great blue plain of salt water.    It is just as true, also, that there are all sorts of Morgans. One of  these named Taffy, was like nearly all Welshmen, in that he was very  fond of singing.    The trouble in his case, however, was that no one but himself loved to  hear his voice, which was very disagreeable. Yet of the sounds which  he himself made with voice or instrument, he was an intense admirer.  Nobody could persuade him that his music was poor and his voice rough.  He always refused to improve.    Now in Wales, the bard, or poet, who makes up his poetry or song as he  goes along, is a very important person, and it is not well to offend  one of these gentlemen. In French, they call such a person by a very  long name--the improvisator.    These poets have sharp tongues and often say hard things about people  whom they do not like. If they used whetstones, or stropped their  tongues on leather, as men do their razors, to give them a keener  edge, their words could not cut more terribly.    Now, on one occasion, Morgan had offended one of these bards. It was  while the poetic gentleman was passing by Taffy's house. He heard the  jolly fellow inside singing, first at the top and then at the bottom  of the scale. He would drop his voice down on the low notes and then  again rise to the highest until it ended in a screech.    Someone on the street asked the poet how he liked the music which he  had heard inside.    \"Music?\" replied the bard with a sneer. \"Is that what Morgan is  trying? Why! I thought it was first the lowing of an aged cow, and  then the yelping of a blind dog, unable to find its way. Do you call  that music?\"    The truth was that when the soloist had so filled himself with strong  ale that his brain was fuddled, then it was hard to tell just what  kind of a noise he was making. It took a wise man to discover the  tune, if there was any.    One evening, when Morgan thought his singing unusually fine, and felt  sorry that no one heard him, he heard a knock.    [Illustration: THE MORE MORGAN PLAYED, THE MADDER THE DANCE]    Instead of going to the door to inquire, or welcome the visitor, he  yelled out \"Come in!\"    The door opened and there stood three tired looking strangers. They  appeared to be travelers. One of them said:    \"Kind sir, we are weary and worn, and would be glad of a morsel of  bread. If you can give us a little food, we shall not trouble you  further.\"    \"Is that all?\" said Morgan. \"See there the loaf and the cheese, with a  knife beside them. Take what you want, and fill your bags. No man  shall ever say that Taffy Morgan denied anyone food, when he had any  himself.\"    Whereupon the three travelers sat down and began to eat.    Meanwhile, without being invited to do so, their host began to sing  for them.    Now the three travelers were fairies in disguise. They were journeying  over the country, from cottage to cottage, visiting the people. They  came to reward all who gave them a welcome and were kind to them, but  to vex and play tricks upon those who were stingy, bad tempered, or of  sour disposition. Turning to Taffy before taking leave, one of them  said:    \"You have been good to us and we are grateful. Now what can we do for  you? We have power to grant anything you may desire. Please tell us  what you would like most.\"    At this, Taffy looked hard in the faces of the three strangers, to see  if one of them was the bard who had likened his voice in its ups and  downs to a cow and a blind dog. Not seeing any familiar face, he  plucked up his courage, and said:    \"If you are not making fun of me, I'll take from you a harp. And, if I  can have my wish in full, I want one that will play only lively tunes.  No sad music for me!\"    Here Morgan stopped. Again he searched their faces, to see if they  were laughing at him and then proceeded.    \"And something else, if I can have it; but it's really the same thing  I am asking for.\"    \"Speak on, we are ready to do what you wish,\" answered the leader.    \"I want a harp, which, no matter how badly I may play, will sound out  sweet and jolly music.\"    \"Say no more,\" said the leader, who waved his hand. There was a flood  of light, and, to Morgan's amazement, there stood on the floor a  golden harp.    But where were the three travelers? They had disappeared in a flash.    Hardly able to believe his own eyes, it now dawned upon him that his  visitors were fairies.    He sat down, back of the harp, and made ready to sweep the strings. He  hardly knew whether or not he touched the instrument, but there rolled  out volumes of lively music, as if the harp itself were mad.
