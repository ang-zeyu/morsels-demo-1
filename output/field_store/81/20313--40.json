He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he  shall gather his lambs with his arms, and carry them in his bosom,  and shall gently lead those that are with young. Who hath measured  the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the  span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, weighed the  mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance? Who hath directed  the Spirit of the Lord, or being his counselor, hath taught him? With  whom took he counsel, and who instructed him and taught him in the  path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way  of understanding? Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket and  are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the  isles as a very little thing. And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn,  nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering. All nations are  before him as nothing, and they are counted to him less than nothing,  and vanity. Jer. 11:15, 16: He [the Lord] hath made the earth by his  power, he hath established the world by his Wisdom, and hath stretched  out the heaven by his understanding. When he uttereth his voice there  is a multitude of waters in the heavens; and he causeth the vapors to  ascend from the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and  bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures. 1 Cor 8:6 But to us there  is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and  one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him. [§ II. ¶  2.]    Q. How did men first come to the knowledge of the existence of a God,  so as to exercise faith in him?    A. In order to answer this question, it will be necessary to go  back and examine man at his creation; the circumstances in which  he was placed, and the knowledge which he had of God. [§ II. ¶  3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.]. First, when man was created he stood in the  presence of God. Gen. 1:27,28. From this we earn that man, at his  creation, stood in the presence of his God, and had most perfect  knowledge of his existence. Secondly, God conversed with him after  his transgression. Gen 3: from the 8th to the 22nd. [§ II. ¶  13,14,15,16,17.] From this we learn that, though man did transgress,  he was not deprived of the previous knowledge which he had of the  existence of God. [§ II. ¶ 19.] Thirdly, God conversed with man after  he cast him out of the garden. [§ II. ¶ 22,23,24,25.] Fourthly, God  also conversed with Cain after he had slain Abel. Gen 4: from the 4th  to the 6th. [§ II. ¶ 26,27,28,29.]    Q. What is the object of the foregoing quotation?    A. It is that it may be clearly seen how it was that the first thoughts  were suggested to the minds of men of the existence of God, and how  extensively this knowledge was spread among the immediate descendants  of Adam. [§ II. ¶ 30,31,32,33.]    Q. What testimony had the immediate descendants of Adam, in proof of  the existence of God?    A. The testimony of their father. And after they were made acquainted  with his existence, by the testimony of their father, they were  dependent upon the exercise of their own faith, for a knowledge of his  character, perfections, and attributes. [§ II. ¶ 23,24,25,26.]    Q. Had any other of the human family, besides Adam, a knowledge of the  existence of God, in the first instance, by any other means than human  testimony?    A. They had not. For previous to the time that they could have power  to obtain a manifestation for themselves, the all-important fact had  been communicated to them by their common father: and so from father to  child the knowledge was communicated as extensively, as the knowledge  of his existence was known; for it was by this means, in the first  instance, that men had a knowledge of his existence. [§ II. ¶ 35,36].    Q. How do you know that the knowledge of the existence of God was  communicated in this manner, throughout the different ages of the world?    A. By the chronology obtained through the revelations of God.    Q. How would you divide that chronology in order to convey it to the  understanding clearly?    A. Into two parts: First, by embracing that period of the world from  Adam to Noah; and secondly, from Noah to Abraham: from which period the  knowledge of the existence of God has been so general, that it is a  matter of no dispute in what manner the idea of his existence has been  retained in the world.    Q. How many noted righteous men lived from Adam to Noah?    A. Nine; which includes Abel, who was slain by his brother.    Q. What are their names?    A.

"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5669"],[0,"Considerations on Representative Government (#5)"],[1,"nity, which are such important parts of social  improvement.    Take, again, such a familiar case as that of a good system of taxation  and finance. This would generally be classed as belonging to the  province of Order. Yet what can be more conducive to Progress? A  financial system which promotes the one, conduces, by the very same  excellences, to the other. Economy, for example, equally preserves the  existing stock of national wealth, and favors the creation of more. A  just distribution of burdens, by holding up to every citizen an  example of morality and good conscience applied to difficult  adjustments, and an evidence of the value which the highest  authorities attach to them, tends in an eminent degree to educate the  moral sentiments of the community, both in respect of strength and of  discrimination. Such a mode of levying the taxes as does not impede  the industry, or unnecessarily interfere with the liberty of the  citizen, promotes, not the preservation only, but the increase of the  national wealth, and encourages a more active use of the individual  faculties. And _vice versa_, all errors in finance and taxation which  obstruct the improvement of the people in wealth and morals, tend  also, if of sufficiently serious amount, positively to impoverish and  demoralize them. It holds, in short, universally, that when Order and  Permanence are taken in their widest sense for the stability of  existing advantages, the requisites of Progress are but the requisites  of Order in a greater degree; those of Permanence merely those of  Progress in a somewhat smaller measure.    In support of the position that Order is intrinsically different from  Progress, and that preservation of existing and acquisition of  additional good are sufficiently distinct to afford the basis of a  fundamental classification, we shall perhaps be reminded that Progress  may be at the expense of Order; that while we are acquiring, or  striving to acquire, good of one kind, we may be losing ground in  respect to others; thus there may be progress in wealth, while there  is deterioration in virtue. Granting this, what it proves is, not that  Progress is generically a different thing from Permanence, but that  wealth is a different thing from virtue. Progress is permanence and  something more; and it is no answer to this to say that Progress in  one thing does not imply Permanence in every thing. No more does  Progress in one thing imply Progress in every thing. Progress of any  kind includes Permanence in that same kind: whenever Permanence is  sacrificed to some particular kind of Progress, other Progress is  still more sacrificed to it; and if it be not worth the sacrifice, not  the interest of Permanence alone has been disregarded, but the general  interest of Progress has been mistaken.    If these improperly contrasted ideas are to be used at all in the  attempt to give a first commencement of scientific precision to the  notion of good government, it would be more philosophically correct to  leave out of the definition the word Order, and to say that the best  government is that which is most conducive to Progress. For Progress  includes Order, but Order does not include Progress. Progress is a  greater degree of that of which Order is a less. Order, in any other  sense, stands only for a part of the prerequisites of good government,  not for its idea and essence. Order would find a more suitable place  among the conditions of Progress, since, if we would increase our sum  of good, nothing is more indispensable than to take due care of what  we already have. If we are endeavouring after more riches, our very  first rule should be, not to squander uselessly our existing means.  Order, thus considered, is not an additional end to be reconciled with  Progress, but a part and means of Progress itself. If a gain in one  respect is purchased by a more than equivalent loss in the same or in  any other, there is not Progress. Conduciveness to Progress, thus  understood, includes the whole excellence of a government.    But, though metaphysically defensible, this definition of the  criterion of good government is not appropriate, because, though it  contains the whole of the truth, it recalls only a part. What is  suggested by the term Progress is the idea of moving onward, whereas  the meaning of it here is quite as much the prevention of falling  back. The very same social causes--the same beliefs, feelings,  institutions, and practices--are as much required to prevent society  from retrograding as to produce a further advance. Were there no  improvement to be hoped for, life would not be the less an unceasing  struggle against causes of deterioration, as it even now is. Politics,  as conceived by the ancients, consisted wholly in this. The natural  tendency of men and their works was to degenerate, which tendency,  however, by good institutions virtuously administered, it might be  possible for an indefinite length of time to counteract. Though we no  longer hold this opinion; though most men in the present age profess  the contrary creed, believing that the tendency of things, on the  whole, is toward improvement, we ought not to forget that there is an  incessant and ever-flowing current of human affairs toward the worse,  consisting of all the follies, all the vices, all the negligences,  indolences, and supinenesses of mankind, which is only controlled, and  kept from sweeping all before it, by the exertions which some persons  constantly, and others by fits, put forth in the direction of good and  worthy objects. It gives a very insufficient idea of the importance of  the strivings which take place to improve and elevate human nature and  life to suppose that their chief value consists in the amount of  actual improvement realized by their means, and that the consequence  of their cessation would merely be that we should remain as we are. A  very small diminution of those exertions would not only put a stop to  improvement, but would turn the general tendency of things toward  deterioration, which, once begun, would proceed with increasingly  rapidity, and become more and more difficult to check, until it  reached a state often seen in history, and in which many large  portions of mankind even now grovel; when hardly any thing short of  superhuman power seems sufficient to turn the tide, and give a fresh  commencement to the upward movement.    These reasons make the word Progress as unapt as the terms Order and  Permanence to become the basis for a classification of the requisites  of a form of government. The fundamental antithesis which these words  express does not lie in the things themselves, so much as in the types  of human character which answer to them. There are, we know, some  minds in which caution, and others in which boldness, predominates; in  some, the desire to avoid imperilling what is already possessed is a  stronger sentiment than that which prompts to improve the old and  acquire new advantages; while there are others who lean the contrary  way, and are more eager for future than careful of present good. The  road to the ends of both is the same; but they are liable to wander  from it in opposite directions. This consideration is of importance in  composing the _personnel_ of any political body: persons of both types  ought to be included in it, that the tendencies of each may be  tempered, in so far as they are excessive, by a due proportion of the  other. There needs no express provision to insure this object,  provided care is taken to admit nothing inconsistent with it. The  natural and spontaneous admixture of the old and the young, of those  whose position and reputation are made and those who have them still  to make, will in general sufficiently answer the purpose, if only this  natural balance is not disturbed by artificial regulation.    Since the distinction most commonly adopted for the classification of  social exigencies does not possess the properties needful for that  use, we have to seek for some other leading distinction better adapted  to the purpose. Such a distinction would seem to be indicated by the  considerations to which I now proceed.    If we ask ourselves on what causes and conditions good government in  all its senses, from the humblest to the most exalted, depends, we  find that the principal of them, the one which transcends all others,  is the qualities of the human beings composing the society over which  the government is exercised.    We may take, as a first instance, the administration of justice; with  the more propriety, since there is no part of public business in which  the mere machinery, the rules and contrivances for conducting the  details of the operation, are of such vital consequence. Yet even  these yield in importance to the qualities of the human agents  employed. Of what efficacy are rules of procedure in securing the ends  of justice if the moral condition of the people is such that the  witnesses generally lie, and the judges and their subordinates take  bribes? Again, how can institutions provide a good municipal  administration if there exists such indifference to the subject that  those who would administer honestly and capably can not be induced to  serve, and the duties are left to those who undertake them because  they have some private interest to be promoted? Of what avail is the  most broadly popular representative system if the electors do not care  to choose the best member of Parliament, but choose him who will spend  most money to be elected? How can a representative assembly work for  good if its members can be bought, or if their excitability of  temperament, uncorrected by public discipline or private self-control,  makes them incapable of calm deliberation, and they resort to manual  violence on the floor of the House, or shoot at one another with  rifles? How, again, can government, or any joint concern, be carried  on in a"]]]
