Likewise, in the  island of Sicily, there have been found leg-bones and arm-bones so large  that their size makes it plain that their owners were giants, and as tall  as great towers; geometry puts this fact beyond a doubt. But, for all  that, I cannot speak with certainty as to the size of Morgante, though I  suspect he cannot have been very tall; and I am inclined to be of this  opinion because I find in the history in which his deeds are particularly  mentioned, that he frequently slept under a roof and as he found houses  to contain him, it is clear that his bulk could not have been anything  excessive.\"    \"That is true,\" said the curate, and yielding to the enjoyment of hearing  such nonsense, he asked him what was his notion of the features of  Reinaldos of Montalban, and Don Roland and the rest of the Twelve Peers  of France, for they were all knights-errant.    \"As for Reinaldos,\" replied Don Quixote, \"I venture to say that he was  broad-faced, of ruddy complexion, with roguish and somewhat prominent  eyes, excessively punctilious and touchy, and given to the society of  thieves and scapegraces. With regard to Roland, or Rotolando, or Orlando  (for the histories call him by all these names), I am of opinion, and  hold, that he was of middle height, broad-shouldered, rather bow-legged,  swarthy-complexioned, red-bearded, with a hairy body and a severe  expression of countenance, a man of few words, but very polite and  well-bred.\"    \"If Roland was not a more graceful person than your worship has  described,\" said the curate, \"it is no wonder that the fair Lady Angelica  rejected him and left him for the gaiety, liveliness, and grace of that  budding-bearded little Moor to whom she surrendered herself; and she  showed her sense in falling in love with the gentle softness of Medoro  rather than the roughness of Roland.\"    \"That Angelica, senor curate,\" returned Don Quixote, \"was a giddy damsel,  flighty and somewhat wanton, and she left the world as full of her  vagaries as of the fame of her beauty. She treated with scorn a thousand  gentlemen, men of valour and wisdom, and took up with a smooth-faced  sprig of a page, without fortune or fame, except such reputation for  gratitude as the affection he bore his friend got for him. The great poet  who sang her beauty, the famous Ariosto, not caring to sing her  adventures after her contemptible surrender (which probably were not over  and above creditable), dropped her where he says:    How she received the sceptre of Cathay,  Some bard of defter quill may sing some day;    and this was no doubt a kind of prophecy, for poets are also called  vates, that is to say diviners; and its truth was made plain; for since  then a famous Andalusian poet has lamented and sung her tears, and  another famous and rare poet, a Castilian, has sung her beauty.\"    \"Tell me, Senor Don Quixote,\" said the barber here, \"among all those who  praised her, has there been no poet to write a satire on this Lady  Angelica?\"    \"I can well believe,\" replied Don Quixote, \"that if Sacripante or Roland  had been poets they would have given the damsel a trimming; for it is  naturally the way with poets who have been scorned and rejected by their  ladies, whether fictitious or not, in short by those whom they select as  the ladies of their thoughts, to avenge themselves in satires and  libels--a vengeance, to be sure, unworthy of generous hearts; but up to  the present I have not heard of any defamatory verse against the Lady  Angelica, who turned the world upside down.\"    \"Strange,\" said the curate; but at this moment they heard the housekeeper  and the niece, who had previously withdrawn from the conversation,  exclaiming aloud in the courtyard, and at the noise they all ran out.          CHAPTER II.    WHICH TREATS OF THE NOTABLE ALTERCATION WHICH SANCHO PANZA HAD WITH DON  QUIXOTE'S NIECE, AND HOUSEKEEPER, TOGETHER WITH OTHER DROLL MATTERS      The history relates that the outcry Don Quixote, the curate, and the  barber heard came from the niece and the housekeeper exclaiming to  Sancho, who was striving to force his way in to see Don Quixote while  they held the door against him, \"What does the vagabond want in this  house? Be off to your own, brother, for it is you, and no one else, that  delude my master, and lead him astray, and take him tramping about the  country.\"    To which Sancho replied, \"Devil's own housekeeper! it is I who am  deluded, and led astray, and taken tramping about the country, and not  thy master! He has carried me all over the world, and you are mightily  mistaken. He enticed me away from home by a trick, promising me an  island, which I am still waiting for.\"    \"May evil islands choke thee, thou detestable Sancho,\" said the niece;  \"What are islands? Is it something to eat, glutton and gormandiser that  thou art?\"    \"It is not something to eat,\" replied Sancho, \"but something to govern  and rule, and better than four cities or four judgeships at court.\"    \"For all that,\" said the housekeeper, \"you don't enter here, you bag of  mischief and sack of knavery; go govern your house and dig your  seed-patch, and give over looking for islands or shylands.\"    The curate and the barber listened with great amusement to the words of  the three; but Don Quixote, uneasy lest Sancho should blab and blurt out  a whole heap of mischievous stupidities, and touch upon points that might  not be altogether to his credit, called to him and made the other two  hold their tongues and let him come in. Sancho entered, and the curate  and the barber took their leave of Don Quixote, of whose recovery they  despaired when they saw how wedded he was to his crazy ideas, and how  saturated with the nonsense of his unlucky chivalry; and said the curate  to the barber, \"You will see, gossip, that when we are least thinking of  it, our gentleman will be off once more for another flight.\"    \"I have no doubt of it,\" returned the barber; \"but I do not wonder so  much at the madness of the knight as at the simplicity of the squire, who  has such a firm belief in all that about the island, that I suppose all  the exposures that could be imagined would not get it out of his head.\"    \"God help them,\" said the curate; \"and let us be on the look-out to see  what comes of all these absurdities of the knight and squire, for it  seems as if they had both been cast in the same mould, and the madness of  the master without the simplicity of the man would not be worth a  farthing.\"    \"That is true,\" said the barber, \"and I should like very much to know  what the pair are talking about at this moment.\"    \"I promise you,\" said the curate, \"the niece or the housekeeper will tell  us by-and-by, for they are not the ones to forget to listen.\"    Meanwhile Don Quixote shut himself up in his room with Sancho, and when  they were alone he said to him, \"It grieves me greatly, Sancho, that thou  shouldst have said, and sayest, that I took thee out of thy cottage, when  thou knowest I did not remain in my house. We sallied forth together, we  took the road together, we wandered abroad together; we have had the same  fortune and the same luck; if they blanketed thee once, they belaboured  me a hundred times, and that is the only advantage I have of thee.\"    \"That was only reasonable,\" replied Sancho, \"for, by what your worship  says, misfortunes belong more properly to knights-errant than to their  squires.\"    \"Thou art mistaken, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"according to the maxim  quando caput dolet, etc.\"    \"I don't understand any language but my own,\" said Sancho.    \"I mean to say,\" said Don Quixote, \"that when the head suffers all the  members suffer; and so, being thy lord and master, I am thy head, and  thou a part of me as thou art my servant; and therefore any evil that  affects or shall affect me should give thee pain, and what affects thee  give pain to me.\"    \"It should be so,\" said Sancho; \"but when I was blanketed as a member, my  head was on the other side of the wall, looking on while I was flying  through the air, and did not feel any pain whatever; and if the members  are obliged to feel the suffering of the head, it should be obliged to  feel their sufferings.\"    \"Dost thou mean to say now, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"that I did not  feel when they were blanketing thee? If thou dost, thou must not say so  or think so, for I felt more pain then in spirit than thou didst in body.  But let us put that aside for the present, for we shall have  opportunities enough for considering and settling the point; tell me,  Sancho my friend, what do they say about me in the village here? What do  the common people think of me? What do the hidalgos? What do the  caballeros? What do they say of my valour; of my achievements; of my  courtesy? How do they treat the task I have undertaken in reviving and  restoring to the world the now forgotten order of chivalry? In short,  Sancho, I would have thee tell me all that has come to thine ears on this  subject; and thou art to tell me, without adding anything to the good or  taking away anything from the bad; for it is the duty of loyal vassals to  tell the truth to their lords just as it is and in its proper shape, not  allowing flattery to add to it or any idle deference to lessen it. And I  would have thee know, Sancho, that if the naked truth, undisguised by  flattery, came to the ears of princes, times would be different, and  other ages would be reckoned iron ages more than ours, which I hold to be  the golden of these latter days.

After he had done that, he said to Hrut, \"Shall I  bring out any gifts beside?\"    \"The day will come,\" answered Hrut, \"when thou wilt have to waste  thy goods for Hallgerda's sake, so hold thy hand now.\"        11. THORWALD'S SLAYING    Thorwald rode home from the bridal feast, and his wife with him,  and Thiostolf, who rode by her horse's side, and still talked to  her in a low voice.  Oswif turned to his son and said, \"Art thou  pleased with thy match?  and how went it when ye talked  together.\"    \"Well,\" said he, \"she showed all kindness to me.  Thou mightst  see that by the way she laughs at every word I say.\"    \"I don't think her laughter so hearty as thou dost,\" answered  Oswif, \"but this will be put to the proof by and by.\"    So they ride on till they come home, and at night she took her  seat by her husband's side, and made room for Thiostolf next  herself on the inside.  Thiostolf and Thorwald had little to do  with each other, and few words were thrown away between them that  winter, and so time went on.  Hallgerda was prodigal and  grasping, and there was nothing that any of their neighbours had  that she must not have too, and all that she had, no matter  whether it were her own or belonged to others she wasted.  But  when the spring came there was a scarcity in the house, both of  meal and stock fish, so Hallgerda went up to Thorwald and said,  \"Thou must not be sitting in-doors any longer, for we want for  the house both meal and fish.\"    \"Well,\" said Thorwald, \"I did not lay in less for the house this  year than I laid in before, and then it used to last till  summer.\"    \"What care I,\" said Hallgerda, \"if thou and thy father have made  your money by starving yourselves.\"    Then Thorwald got angry and gave her a blow on the face and drew  blood, and went away and called his men and ran the skiff down to  the shore.  Then six of them jumped into her and rowed out to the  Bear-isles, and began to load her with meal and fish.    Meantime it is said that Hallgerda sat out of doors heavy at  heart.  Thiostolf went up to her and saw the wound on her face,  and said, \"Who has been playing thee this sorry trick?\"    \"My husband, Thorwald,\" she said, \"and thou stoodst aloof, though  thou wouldst not if thou hadst cared at all for me.\"    \"Because I knew nothing about it,\" said Thiostolf, \"but I will  avenge it.\"    Then he went away down to the shore and ran out a six-oared boat,  and held in his hand a great axe that he had with a haft overlaid  with iron.  He steps into the boat and rows out to the  Bear-isles, and when he got there all the men had rowed away but  Thorwald and his followers, and he stayed by the skiff to load  her, while they brought the goods down to him.  So Thiostolf came  up just then and jumped into the skiff, and began to load with  him, and after a while he said, \"Thou canst do but little at this  work, and that little thou dost badly.\"    \"Thinkst thou thou canst do it better,\" said Thorwald.    \"There's one thing to be done which I can do better than thou,\"  said Thiostolf, and then he went on, \"The woman who is thy wife  has made a bad match, and you shall not live much longer  together.\"    Then Thorwald snatched up a fishing-knife that lay by him, and  made a stab at Thiostolf; he had lifted his axe to his shoulder  and dashed it down.  It came on Thorwald's arm and crushed the  wrist, but down fell the knife.  Then Thiostolf lifted up his axe  a second time and gave Thorwald a blow on the head, and he fell  dead on the spot.        12. THIOSTOLF'S FLIGHT    While this was going on, Thorwald's men came down with their  load, but Thiostolf was not slow in his plans.  He hewed with  both hands at the gunwale of the skiff and cut it down about two  planks; then he leapt into his boat, but the dark blue sea poured  into the skiff, and down she went with all her freight.  Down too  sank Thorwald's body, so that his men could not see what had been  done to him, but they knew well enough that he was dead.  Thiostolf rowed away up the firth, but they shouted after him  wishing him ill luck.  He made them no answer, but rowed on till  he got home, and ran the boat up on the beach, and went up to the  house with his axe, all bloody as it was, on his shoulder.  Hallgerda stood out of doors, and said, \"Thine axe is bloody;  what hast thou done?\"    \"I have done now what will cause thee to be wedded a second  time.\"    \"Thou tellest me then that Thorwald is dead,\" she said.    \"So it is,\" said he, \"and now look out for my safety.\"    \"So I will,\" she said; \"I will send thee north to Bearfirth, to  Swanshol, and Swan, my kinsman, will receive thee with open arms.  He is so mighty a man that no one will seek thee thither.\"    So he saddled a horse that she had, and jumped on his back, and  rode off north to Bearfirth, to Swanshol, and Swan received him  with open arms, and said: \"That's what I call a man who does not  stick at trifles!  And now I promise thee if they seek thee here,  they shall get nothing but the greatest shame.\"    Now, the story goes back to Hallgerda, and how she behaved.  She  called on Liot the Black, her kinsman, to go with her, and bade  him saddle their horses, for she said, \"I will ride home to my  father.\"    While he made ready for their journey, she went to her chests and  unlocked them and called all the men of her house about her, and  gave each of them some gift; but they all grieved at her going.  Now she rides home to her father; and he received her well, for  as yet he had not heard the news.  But Hrut said to Hallgerda,  \"Why did not Thorwald come with thee?\" and she answered, \"He is  dead.\"    Then said Hauskuld, \"That was Thiostolf's doing.\"    \"It was,\" she said.    \"Ah!\" said Hauskuld, \"Hrut was not far wrong when he told me that  this bargain would draw mickle misfortune after it.  But there's  no good in troubling one's self about a thing that's done and  gone.\"    Now, the story must go back to Thorwald's mates, how there they  are, and how they begged the loan of a boat to get to the  mainland.  So a boat was lent them at once, and they rowed up the  firth to Reykianess, and found Oswif, and told him these tidings.    He said, \"Ill luck is the end of ill redes, and now I see how it  has all gone.  Hallgerda must have sent Thiostolf to Bearfirth,  but she herself must have ridden home to her father.  Let us now  gather folk and follow him up thither north.\" So they did that,  and went about asking for help, and got together many men.  And  then they all rode off to Steingrims river, and so on to  Liotriverdale and Selriverdale, till they came to Bearfirth.    Now Swan began to speak, and gasped much.  \"Now Oswif's fetches  are seeking us out.\"  Then up sprung Thiostolf, but Swan said,  \"Go thou out with me, there won't be need of much.\"  So they went  out both of them, and Swan took a goatskin and wrapped it about  his own head, and said, \"Become mist and fog, become fright and  wonder mickle to all those who seek thee.\"    Now, it must be told how Oswif, his friends, and his men are  riding along the ridge; then came a great mist against them, and  Oswif said, \"This is Swan's doing; 'twere well if nothing worse  followed.\"  A little after a mighty darkness came before their  eyes, so that they could see nothing, and then they fell off  their horses' backs, and lost their horses, and dropped their  weapons, and went over head and ears into bogs, and some went  astray into the wood, till they were on the brink of bodily harm.  Then Oswif said, \"If I could only find my horse and weapons, then  I'd turn back;\" and he had scarce spoken these words than they  saw somewhat, and found their horses and weapons.  Then many  still egged the others on to look after the chase once more; and  so they did, and at once the same wonders befell them, and so  they fared thrice.  Then Oswif said, \"Though the course be not  good, let us still turn back.  Now, we will take counsel a second  time, and what now pleases my mind best, is to go and find  Hauskuld, and ask atonement for my son; for there's no hope of  honour where there's good store of it.\"    So they rode thence to the Broadfirth dales, and there is nothing  to be told about them till they came to Hauskuldstede, and Hrut  was there before them.  Oswif called out Hauskuld and Hrut, and  they both went out and bade him good day.  After that they began  to talk.  Hauskuld asked Oswif whence he came.  He said he had  set out to search for Thiostolf, but couldn't find him.  Hauskuld  said he must have gone north to Swanshol, \"and thither it is not  every man's lot to go to find him.\"    \"Well,\" says Oswif, \"I am come hither for this, to ask atonement  for my son from thee.\"    Hauskuld answered, \"I did not slay thy son, nor did I plot his  death; still it may be forgiven thee to look for atonement  somewhere.\"    \"Nose is next of kin, brother, to eyes,\" said Hrut, \"and it is  needful to stop all evil tongues, and to make him atonement for  his son, and so mend thy daughter's state, for that will only be  the case when this suit is dropped, and the less that is said  about it the better it will be.\"    Hauskuld said, \"Wilt thou undertake the award?\"    \"That I will,\" says Hrut, \"nor will I shield thee at all in my  award; for if the truth must be told thy daughter planned his  death.\"    Then Hrut held his peace some little while, and afterwards he  stood up, and said to Oswif, \"Take now my hand in handsel as a  token that thou lettest the suit drop.\"    So Oswif stood up and said, \"This is not an atonement on equal  terms when thy brother utters the award, but still thou (speaking  to Hrut) hast behaved so well about it that I trust thee  thoroughly to make it.\"  Then he stood up and took Hauskuld's  hand, and came to an atonement in the matter, on the  understanding that Hrut was to make up his mind and utter the  award before Oswif went away.  After that, Hrut made his award,  and said, \"For "]]]
