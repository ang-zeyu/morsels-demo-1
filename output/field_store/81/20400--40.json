The colony was, in short,  simply a kraal for yarding British undesirables and housing their  keepers; its remoteness was an advantage for the purpose in view; and it  never seemed to strike the officials in England who superintended its  affairs, that the adequate defence of a gaol against foreign aggression  was an undertaking that called for exertion or forethought. The  unreluctant retrocession of the Cape to the Dutch in 1800 indicates that  the interest of defending Australia was lost sight of in the midst of  what appeared to be more pressing considerations.    It has been remarked above that there was a period when the peace of  Australia was imperilled. The danger was obviated, certainly not because  of the efficiency of the defence, but rather through lack of enterprise  on the part of the Admiral in command of the French squadron in the  Indian Ocean. It will be well to narrate the circumstances, together with  an incident which illustrates in an amusing manner the kind of man this  officer was.    After the signing of the Treaty of Amiens, Bonaparte sent out a squadron  commanded by Rear-Admiral Linois, conveying General Charles Decaen, who  was commissioned to administer the former French possessions in India,  which, under the terms of the treaty, were to be surrendered to France.  But when the expedition arrived at Pondicherry, the Governor-General of  India, Lord Wellesley, gave orders to his subordinates that no  concessions were to be made to the French without his express authority;  and as he stubbornly refused to give his warrant for surrendering an inch  of territory, there was nothing for General Decaen to do but sail away to  Mauritius, then, as already remarked, a French colony. Lord Wellesley  acted under secret orders from the Secretary of State, Lord Hobart, dated  October 17, 1802, only seven months after the treaty was signed, for the  British Government did not believe in the permanency of the peace and did  not desire the French to re-assert a footing in India, where their  presence, in the event of a renewal of hostilities, would be dangerous.    When the war was renewed, Linois, with his squadron, was still in the  Indian Ocean. The Isle of France was not a self-supporting colony, but  had to depend on money and supplies obtained either from Europe or from  the vessels of the East India Company, which, from time to time, were  captured by French privateers and men-of-war. When Nelson shattered the  naval power of France at Trafalgar in 1805, and vigilant British frigates  patrolled the whole highway of commerce from Europe to the Cape of Good  Hope, Decaen's position became precarious. The supplies sent out to him  were frequently captured by the enemy; and had it not been that Port  Louis became a regular nest of adventurous French privateers--\"pirates,\"  the British called them--who frequently found a rich prey in the shape of  heavily laden India merchantmen, his garrison must soon have been starved  out.    The incident to which reference has been made occurred in 1804, and is  probably without a parallel in naval history as an example of the effect  of audacity acting on timidity. It was known that a convoy of ships  belonging to the East India Company was to leave Canton early in the  year. Linois, with five vessels, including his flagship, the Marengo, 74  guns, sailed for the Straits of Malacca to intercept them. On February  14, near Polo Aor, to the north-east of Singapore, the French sighted the  convoy, sixteen Company ships, fourteen merchantmen and a brig, all laden  with tea, silks, and other rich merchandise.    The East India Company's vessels carried guns, but they were not equipped  for facing heavily armed men-of-war. Their crews were not trained  fighting men; they were deeply laden, and their decks were heavily  cumbered. Moreover, they were not protected by a naval squadron; and had  Rear-Admiral Linois been a commander of daring, initiative, and resource,  the greater part, or the whole, of this enormous mass of floating  treasure might have fallen like a ripe peach into his hands.    But he had to contend with an English sailor of astounding and quite  picturesque assurance in Nathaniel Dance, the commodore of the fleet.  Dance fully expected, when he left Canton, that he would meet French  raiders, though he was astonished when he saw five sail under the  tricolour bearing up towards him. But he had thought out what he intended  to do if attacked; and, partly by courage, partly by a superb piece of  \"bluff,\" he succeeded completely.    Before sailing, the Company ships had been freshly painted. Their gun  embrasures showed up more fearsome to the eye of imagination than they  were in reality. Dance also carried blue ensigns, which were hoisted on  four of his craft when the French made their appearance. He resorted to  this device with the deliberate purpose of making the strongest vessels  of his convoy look like British men-of-war. In fact, he commanded a fleet  of opulent merchantmen, the best of which, by the mere use of brushes and  pots of paint, and by the hoisting of a few yards of official bunting,  were made to resemble fighting ships. But, wonder of wonders! this  scarecrow strategy struck terror into the heart of a real Rear-Admiral,  and, as a French historian somewhat lugubriously, but quite candidly,  acknowledges: \"Les ruses de Dance reussirent; les flammes bleues, les  canons de bois, les batteries peintes, produisirent leur effet.\"    No sooner did the French squadron appear, than Dance drew up his convoy  in two lines, with the fifteen smaller vessels under the lee of the  sixteen larger ones, which presented their painted broadsides to the foe.  It was a manoeuvre which threatened a determination to fight, and Linois  was disposed to be cautious. He was puzzled by the number of ships,  having been informed by an American captain at Batavia that only  seventeen were to leave Canton. The larger fleet, and the blue ensigns  fluttering from four masts, imbued him with a spirit of reluctance which  he dignified with the name of prudence. As a naval historian puts it,  \"The warlike appearance of the sixteen ships, the regularity of their  manoeuvres, and the boldness of their advance, led the French Admiral to  deliberate whether a part of them were not cruisers.\"* (* James, Naval  History 3 247. There is a contemporary account of the incident in the  Gentleman's Magazine (1804) volume 74 pages 963 and 967.) Linois did not  like to attack, as darkness was approaching, but argued that if the bold  face put upon the matter by the British were merely a stratagem, they  would attempt to fly in the night; in which case he would not hesitate to  chase them. But Dance did nothing of the kind. He had taken his enemy's  measure; or, to quote the French historian again, \"il comprit l'etat  moral de son adversaire.\" He maintained his formation during the night,  keeping blue lights burning on the four ships which sported the blue  ensign, to enforce the illusion that they were the naval escort of the  convoy, and were eager for battle. In the morning Linois was quite  satisfied that he really had to contend with a fleet pugnaciously  inclined, which, if he tried to hurt them, would probably hurt him more.  Cheers broke from the British decks as the Marengo bore up. Dance then  manoeuvred as if his intention were to shut in the French squadron  between two lines, and rake them on both flanks. This clever movement so  scared the Rear-Admiral that he determined to run. A shot was fired from  his flagship, which killed one man and wounded another on the Royal  George; whereupon the British sailors fired their guns in return, and  kept up a furious, but quite harmless, cannonade for forty minutes. Not a  single French ship was hit; but under cover of the thick smoke which \"the  engagement\" occasioned, Linois and his squadron sailed away, and left the  cheering Britons in the peace which they so certainly required, but had  so audaciously pretended that they did not in the least degree desire.    Dance became temporarily a national hero. The Englishman enjoys a joke,  and at a period of extreme tension the impudent exploit of the commodore  provoked a roar of delighted and derisive laughter throughout the British  Isles. He was feted by the City of London, knighted by King George,  presented with a sword of honour, and endowed by the Company with a  handsome fortune.    On the other hand, Napoleon was furious. Linois \"has made the French flag  the laughing stock of the universe,\" he wrote to his Minister of Marine,  Decres.* (* Correspondance de Napoleon I (1858 to 1870) volume 9 document  8024.) Again he said, \"The conduct of Linois is miserable\"; and in a  third letter, summing up in a crisp sentence the cause of so many French  failures on the blue water, he said: \"All the maritime expeditions that  have been despatched since I have been at the head of the Government have  failed because our admirals see double, and have found, I do not know  where, that one can make war without running any risks;\" \"it is honour  that I wish them to conserve, rather than a few wooden vessels and some  men.\" It was while still smarting under this same indignity, and urging  his Minister to hurry the sending of ships with supplies for the support  of the Isle of France, that Napoleon made one of his most famous retorts.  Decres, with the obsequiousness of a courtier, had written that if the  Emperor insisted on ordering certain ships to be despatched, \"I should  recognise the will of God, and should send them.\" \"I will excuse you from  comparing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7452"],[0,"Autobiography of a Yogi (#5)"],[1," on your way to the  Himalayas, I came to a definite resolve. I must not further postpone  the fulfillment of my solemn promise.\" My brother handed me a small  box, and delivered Mother's message.    \"Let these words be my final blessing, my beloved son Mukunda!\"  Mother had said. \"The hour is here when I must relate a number of  phenomenal events following your birth. I first knew your destined  path when you were but a babe in my arms. I carried you then to  the home of my guru in Benares. Almost hidden behind a throng of  disciples, I could barely see Lahiri Mahasaya as he sat in deep  meditation.    \"While I patted you, I was praying that the great guru take  notice and bestow a blessing. As my silent devotional demand grew  in intensity, he opened his eyes and beckoned me to approach. The  others made a way for me; I bowed at the sacred feet. My master  seated you on his lap, placing his hand on your forehead by way of  spiritually baptizing you.    \"'Little mother, thy son will be a yogi. As a spiritual engine, he  will carry many souls to God's kingdom.'    \"My heart leaped with joy to find my secret prayer granted by the  omniscient guru. Shortly before your birth, he had told me you  would follow his path.    \"Later, my son, your vision of the Great Light was known to me and  your sister Roma, as from the next room we observed you motionless  on the bed. Your little face was illuminated; your voice rang with  iron resolve as you spoke of going to the Himalayas in quest of  the Divine.    \"In these ways, dear son, I came to know that your road lies far  from worldly ambitions. The most singular event in my life brought  further confirmation-an event which now impels my deathbed message.    \"It was an interview with a sage in the Punjab. While our family  was living in Lahore, one morning the servant came precipitantly  into my room.    \"'Mistress, a strange SADHU {FN2-3} is here. He insists that he  \"see the mother of Mukunda.\"'    \"These simple words struck a profound chord within me; I went at  once to greet the visitor. Bowing at his feet, I sensed that before  me was a true man of God.    \"'Mother,' he said, 'the great masters wish you to know that your  stay on earth will not be long. Your next illness shall prove to  be your last.' {FN2-4} There was a silence, during which I felt no  alarm but only a vibration of great peace. Finally he addressed me  again:    \"'You are to be the custodian of a certain silver amulet. I will  not give it to you today; to demonstrate the truth in my words, the  talisman shall materialize in your hands tomorrow as you meditate.  On your deathbed, you must instruct your eldest son Ananta to keep  the amulet for one year and then to hand it over to your second  son.  Mukunda will understand the meaning of the talisman from the  great ones. He should receive it about the time he is ready to  renounce all worldly hopes and start his vital search for God. When  he has retained the amulet for some years, and when it has served  its purpose, it shall vanish. Even if kept in the most secret spot,  it shall return whence it came.'    \"I proffered alms {FN2-5} to the saint, and bowed before him  in great reverence. Not taking the offering, he departed with a  blessing. The next evening, as I sat with folded hands in meditation,  a silver amulet materialized between my palms, even as the SADHU  had promised.  It made itself known by a cold, smooth touch. I  have jealously guarded it for more than two years, and now leave  it in Ananta's keeping. Do not grieve for me, as I shall have been  ushered by my great guru into the arms of the Infinite. Farewell,  my child; the Cosmic Mother will protect you.\"    A blaze of illumination came over me with possession of the amulet;  many dormant memories awakened. The talisman, round and anciently  quaint, was covered with Sanskrit characters. I understood that it  came from teachers of past lives, who were invisibly guiding my  steps.  A further significance there was, indeed; but one does not  reveal fully the heart of an amulet.    How the talisman finally vanished amidst deeply unhappy circumstances  of my life; and how its loss was a herald of my gain of a guru,  cannot be told in this chapter.    But the small boy, thwarted in his attempts to reach the Himalayas,  daily traveled far on the wings of his amulet.    {FN2-1} Sanskrit root meaning of SWAMI is \"he who is one with his  Self (SWA).\" Applied to a member of the Indian order of monks, the  title has the formal respect of \"the reverend.\"    {FN2-2} The Indian custom, whereby parents choose the life-partner  for their child, has resisted the blunt assaults of time. The  percentage is high of happy Indian marriages.    {FN2-3} An anchorite; one who pursues a SADHANA or path of spiritual  discipline.    {FN2-4} When I discovered by these words that Mother had possessed  secret knowledge of a short life, I understood for the first time  why she had been insistent on hastening the plans for Ananta's  marriage.  Though she died before the wedding, her natural maternal  wish had been to witness the rites.    {FN2-5} A customary gesture of respect to SADHUS.        CHAPTER: 3    THE SAINT WITH TWO BODIES    \"Father, if I promise to return home without coercion, may I take  a sight-seeing trip to Benares?\"    My keen love of travel was seldom hindered by Father. He permitted  me, even as a mere boy, to visit many cities and pilgrimage spots.  Usually one or more of my friends accompanied me; we would travel  comfortably on first-class passes provided by Father. His position  as a railroad official was fully satisfactory to the nomads in the  family.    Father promised to give my request due consideration. The next  day he summoned me and held out a round-trip pass from Bareilly to  Benares, a number of rupee notes, and two letters.    \"I have a business matter to propose to a Benares friend, Kedar  Nath Babu. Unfortunately I have lost his address. But I believe you  will be able to get this letter to him through our common friend,  Swami Pranabananda. The swami, my brother disciple, has attained  an exalted spiritual stature. You will benefit by his company; this  second note will serve as your introduction.\"      Father's eyes twinkled as he added, \"Mind, no more flights from  home!\"    I set forth with the zest of my twelve years (though time has  never dimmed my delight in new scenes and strange faces). Reaching  Benares, I proceeded immediately to the swami's residence. The  front door was open; I made my way to a long, hall-like room on  the second floor. A rather stout man, wearing only a loincloth, was  seated in lotus posture on a slightly raised platform. His head and  unwrinkled face were clean-shaven; a beatific smile played about  his lips. To dispel my thought that I had intruded, he greeted me  as an old friend.    \"BABA ANAND (bliss to my dear one).\" His welcome was given heartily  in a childlike voice. I knelt and touched his feet.    \"Are you Swami Pranabananda?\"    He nodded. \"Are you Bhagabati's son?\" His words were out before I  had had time to get Father's letter from my pocket. In astonishment,  I handed him the note of introduction, which now seemed superfluous.    \"Of course I will locate Kedar Nath Babu for you.\" The saint again  surprised me by his clairvoyance. He glanced at the letter, and  made a few affectionate references to my parent.    \"You know, I am enjoying two pensions. One is by the recommendation  of your father, for whom I once worked in the railroad office. The  other is by the recommendation of my Heavenly Father, for whom I  have conscientiously finished my earthly duties in life.\"    I found this remark very obscure. \"What kind of pension, sir, do  you receive from the Heavenly Father? Does He drop money in your  lap?\"    He laughed. \"I mean a pension of fathomless peace-a reward for many  years of deep meditation. I never crave money now. My few material  needs are amply provided for. Later you will understand the  significance of a second pension.\"    Abruptly terminating our conversation, the saint became gravely  motionless. A sphinxlike air enveloped him. At first his eyes  sparkled, as if observing something of interest, then grew dull. I  felt abashed at his pauciloquy; he had not yet told me how I could  meet Father's friend. A trifle restlessly, I looked about me in  the bare room, empty except for us two. My idle gaze took in his  wooden sandals, lying under the platform seat.    \"Little sir, {FN3-1} don't get worried. The man you wish to see  will be with you in half an hour.\" The yogi was reading my mind-a  feat not too difficult at the moment!    Again he fell into inscrutable silence. My watch informed me that  thirty minutes had elapsed.    The swami aroused himself. \"I think Kedar Nath Babu is nearing the  door.\"    I heard somebody coming up the stairs. An amazed incomprehension  arose suddenly; my thoughts raced in confusion: \"How is it possible  that Father's friend has been summoned to this place without the  help of a messenger? The swami has spoken to no one but myself  since my arrival!\"    Abruptly I quitted the room and descended the steps. Halfway down  I met a thin, fair-skinned man of medium height. He appeared to be  in a hurry.    \"Are you Kedar Nath Babu?\" Excitement colored my voice.    \"Yes. Are you not Bhagabati's son who has been waiting here to meet  me?\" He smiled in friendly fashion.    \"Sir, how do you happen to come here?\" I felt baffled resentment  over his inexplicable presence.    \"Everything is mysterious today! Less than an hour ago I had just  finished my bath in the Ganges when Swami Pranabananda approached  me.  I have no idea how he knew I was there at that time.    \"'Bhagabati's son is waiting for you in my apartment,' he said.  'Will you come with me?' I gladly agreed. As we proceeded hand in  hand, the swami in his wooden sandals was strangely able to outpace  me, though I wore these stout "]]]
