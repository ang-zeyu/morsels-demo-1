He commenced, and again related the very same things which he had      done at his first visit, without the least variation, which having      done, he informed me of great judgments which were coming upon the      earth, with great desolations by famine, sword, and pestilence;      and that these grievous judgments would come on the earth in this      generation. Having related these things, he again ascended as he      had done before.\"    \"When the angel ascended the second time he left Joseph overwhelmed  with astonishment, yet gave him but a short time to contemplate the  things which he had told him before he made his reappearance and  rehearsed the same things over, adding a few words of caution and  instruction, thus: That he must beware of covetousness, and he must not  suppose the record was to be brought forth with the view of getting  gain, for this was not the case, but that it was to bring forth light  and intelligence, which had for a long time been lost to the world; and  that when he went to get the plates, he must be on his guard, or his  mind would be filled with darkness. The angel then told him to tell his  father all which he had both seen and heard.    \"* * * * From this time forth, Joseph continued to receive instructions  from the Lord, and we continued to get the children together every  evening, for the purpose of listening while he gave us a relation of  the same. I presume our family presented an aspect as singular as any  that ever lived upon the face of the earth--all seated in a circle,  father, mother, sons, and daughters, and giving the most profound  attention to a boy, eighteen years of age, who had never read the  Bible through in his life. He seemed much less inclined to the perusal  of books than any of the rest of our children, but far more given to  meditation and deep study.    \"We were now confirmed in the opinion that God was about to bring to  light something upon which we could stay our minds, or that would give  us a more perfect knowledge of the plan of salvation and the redemption  of the human family. This caused us greatly to rejoice; the sweetest  union and happiness pervaded our house, and tranquillity reigned in our  midst.    \"During our evening conversations, Joseph would occasionally give us  some of the most amusing recitals that could be imagined. He would  describe the ancient inhabitants of this continent, their dress, mode  of traveling, and the animals upon which they rode; their cities, their  buildings, with every particular; their mode of warfare; and also their  religious worship. This he would do with as much ease, seemingly, as if  he had spent his whole life with them.\"    Thus continued the divine and miraculous experience of the prophetic  family until the golden plates were obtained, the book of Mormon  published, and the \"Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\" was  established on the 6th of April, 1830.    But all this shall be written in the book of the prophet!        CHAPTER III.    THE OPENING OF A SPIRITUAL DISPENSATION TO AMERICA--WOMAN'S  EXALTATION--THE LIGHT OF THE LATTER DAYS.    Joseph Smith opened to America a great spiritual dispensation. It was  such the Mormon sisterhood received.    A latter-day prophet! A gospel of miracles! Angels visiting the earth  again! Pentecosts in the nineteenth century! This was Mormonism.    These themes were peculiarly fascinating to those earnest apostolic  women whom we shall introduce to the reader.    Ever must such themes be potent with woman. She has a divine mission  always, both to manifest spiritual gifts and to perpetuate spiritual  dispensations.    Woman is child of faith. Indeed she is faith. Man is reason. His mood  is skepticism. Left alone to _his_ apostleship, spiritual missions die,  though revealed by a cohort of archangels. Men are too apt to lock  again the heavens which the angels have opened, and convert priesthood  into priestcraft. It is woman who is the chief architect of a spiritual  church.    Joseph Smith was a prophet and seer because his mother was a prophetess  and seeress. Lucy Smith gave birth to the prophetic genius which has  wrought out its manifestations so marvelously in the age. Brigham  Young, who is a society-builder, also received his rare endowments  from his mother. Though differing from Joseph, Brigham has a potent  inspiration.    Thus we trace the Mormon genius to these mothers. They gave birth to  the great spiritual dispensation which is destined to incarnate a new  and universal Christian church.    Until the faith of Latter-day Saints invoked one, there was no Holy  Ghost in the world such as the saints of former days would have  recognized. Respectable divines, indeed, had long given out that  revelation was done away, because no longer needed. The canon of  scripture was said to be full. The voice of prophesy was no more to be  heard to the end of time.    But the Mormon prophet invoked the Holy Ghost of the ancient Hebrews,  and burst the sealed heavens. The Holy Ghost came, and His apostles  published the news abroad.    The initial text of Mormonism was precisely that which formed the basis  of Peter's colossal sermon on the day of Pentecost:    \"And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour  out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall  prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams;    \"And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days  of my spirit; and they shall prophesy.\"    Here was a magic gospel for the age! And how greatly was woman in its  divine programme!    No sooner was the application made than the prophesy was discovered  to be pregnant with its own fulfillment. The experience of the  former-day saints became the experience of the \"latter-day saints.\" It  was claimed, too, that the supreme fulfillment was reserved for this  crowning dispensation. These were emphatically the \"last days.\" It  was in the \"last days\" that God would pour out His spirit upon \"_all_  flesh.\" The manifestation of Pentecost was but the foreshadowing of  the power of God, to be universally displayed to his glory, and the  regeneration of the nations in the \"dispensation of the fullness of  times.\"    This gospel of a new dispensation came to America by the administration  of angels. But let it not be thought that Joseph Smith alone saw  angels. Multitudes received angelic administrations in the early days  of the Church; thousands spoke in tongues and prophesied; and visions,  dreams and miracles were daily manifestations among the disciples.    The sisters were quite as familiar with angelic visitors as the  apostles. They were in fact the best \"mediums\" of this spiritual work.  They were the \"cloud of witnesses.\" Their Pentecosts of spiritual gifts  were of frequent occurrence.    The sisters were also apostolic in a priestly sense. They partook  of the priesthood equally with the men. They too \"held the keys of  the administration of angels.\" Who can doubt it, when faith is the  greatest of all keys to unlock the gates of heaven? But \"the Church\"  herself acknowledged woman's key. There was no Mormon St. Peter in this  new dispensation to arrogate supremacy over woman, on his solitary  pontifical throne. The \"Order of Celestial Marriage,\" not of celestial  celibacy, was about to be revealed to the Church.    Woman also soon became high priestess and prophetess. She was this  _officially_. The constitution of the Church acknowledged her divine  mission to administer for the regeneration of the race. The genius of a  patriarchal priesthood naturally made her the apostolic help-meet for  man. If you saw her not in the pulpit _teaching_ the congregation, yet  was she to be found in the temple, _administering_ for the living and  the dead! Even in the holy of holies she was met. As a high priestess  she blessed with the laying on of hands! As a prophetess she oracled  in holy places! As an endowment giver she was a Mason, of the Hebraic  order, whose Grand Master is the God of Israel and whose anointer is  the Holy Ghost.    She held the keys of the administration of angels and of the working  of miracles and of the \"sealings\" pertaining to \"the heavens and  the earth.\" Never before was woman so much as she is in this Mormon  dispensation!    The supreme spiritual character of the \"Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints\" (its proper name), is well typed in the hymn so  often sung by the saints at their \"testimony meetings,\" and sometimes  in their temples. Here is its theme:      \"The spirit of God like a fire is burning,         The latter-day glory begins to come forth,    The visions and blessings of old are returning,         The angels are coming to visit the earth.      _Chorus_--We'll sing and we'll shout with the armies of heaven--         Hosanna, hosanna to God and the Lamb!    Let glory to them in the highest be given,         Henceforth and forever--amen and amen.      The Lord is"]]]
