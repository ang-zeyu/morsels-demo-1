A smaller set will  also be placed forward, and there will be ample room for carrying tools  and such things.\"    \"About how far do you expect your car will go with one charging of the  battery?\"    \"Well, if I can make it do three hundred miles I'll be satisfied, but  I'm going to try for four hundred.\"    \"What will you do when your battery runs out?\"    \"Recharge it.\"    \"Suppose you're not near a charging station?\"    \"Well, Dad, of course those are some of the details I've got to work  out. I'm planning a register gauge now, that will give warning about  fifty miles before the battery is run down. That will leave me a margin  to work on. And I'm going to have it fixed so I can take current from  any trolley line, as well as from a regular charging station. My battery  will be capable of being recharged very quickly, or, in case of need, I  can take out the old cells and put in new ones.    \"That's a very good idea. Well, I hope you succeed.\"    A few evenings after this, when Tom was busy in his machine shop, he  heard some one enter. He looked up from the gauge of the motor, which  he was studying, and, for a moment, he could make out nothing in the  dark interior of the shop, for he was working in a brilliant light.    \"Who's there?\" he called sharply, for, more than once unscrupulous men  had endeavored to sneak into the Swift shops to steal ideas of  inventions; if not the actual apparatus itself.    \"It's me--Ned Newton,\" was the cheerful reply.    \"Oh, hello, Ned! I was wondering what had become of you,\" responded  Tom. \"Where have you been lately?\"    \"Oh, working overtime.\"    \"What's the occasion?\"    \"We're trying out a new system to increase the bank business.\"    \"What's the matter? Aren't you folks getting business enough, after the  big deposits we made of the bullion from the wreck?\"    \"Oh, it's not that. But haven't you heard the news? There is talk of  starting a rival bank in Shopton, and that may make us hustle to hold  what business we have, to say nothing of getting new customers.\"    \"A new bank, eh? Who's going to start it?\"    \"Andy Foger's father, I hear. You know he was a director in our bank,  but he got out last week.\"    \"What for?\"    \"Well, he had some difficulty with Mr. Pendergast, the president. I  fancy you had something to do with it, too.\"    \"I?\"  Tom was plainly surprised.    \"Yes, you know you and Mr. Damon and Mr. Sharp captured the bank  robbers, and got back most of the money.\"    \"I guess I do remember it! I wish you could have seen the gang when we  raided them from the clouds, in our airship!\"    \"Well, you know Andy Foger hoped to collect the five thousand dollars  reward for telling the police that you were the thief, and of course he  got fooled, for you got the reward. Mr. Foger expected his son would  collect the money, and when Andy got left, it made him sore. He's had a  grudge against Mr. Pendergast, and all the other bank officials ever  since, and now he's going to start a rival bank. So that's why I said  it was partly due to you.\"    \"Oh, I see. I thought at first you meant that it was on account of  something that happened the other day.\"    \"What was that?\"    \"Andy, Sam and Pete got the contents of a bottle of stove blacking,\"  and Tom related the occurrence, at which Ned laughed heartily.    \"I wouldn't be surprised though,\" added Ned, \"to learn that Mr. Foger  started the new bank more for revenge than anything else.\"    \"So that's the reason you've been working late, eh?\" went on Tom.  \"Getting ready for competition. Do you think a new bank will hurt the  one you're with?\"    \"Well, it might,\" admitted Ned. \"It's bound to make a change, anyhow,  and now that I have a good position I don't want to lose it. I take  more of an interest in the institution now that I'm assistant cashier,  than I did when I was a clerk. So, naturally, I'm a little worried.\"    \"Say, don't let it worry you,\" begged Tom, earnestly.    \"Why not?\"    \"Because I know my father and Mr. Damon will stick to the old bank.  They won't have anything to do with the one Andy Foger's father starts.  Don't you worry.\"    \"Well, that will help some,\" declared Ned. \"They are both heavy  depositors, and if they stick to the old bank we can stand it even if  some of our smaller customers desert us.\"    \"That's the way to talk,\" went on the young inventor. \"Let Foger start  his bank. It won't hurt yours.\"    \"What are you making now?\" asked Ned, a little later, looking with  interest at the machinery over which Tom was bending, and to which he  was making adjustments.    \"New electric automobile. I want to beat Andy Foger's car worse than I  did on my motor-cycle, and I also want to win a prize,\" and the lad  proceeded to relate the incidents leading up to his construction of the  storage battery.    Tom and Ned were in the shop until long past midnight, and then the  bank employee, with a look at his watch, exclaimed:    \"Great Scott! I ought to be home.\"    \"I'll run you over in Mr. Damon's car,\" proposed Tom. \"He left it here  the other day, while he and his wife went off on a trip, and he said I  could use it whenever I wanted to.\"    \"Good!\" cried Ned.    The two lads came from Tom's particular workshop. As the young inventor  closed the door he started suddenly, as he snapped shut the lock.    \"What's the matter?\" asked Ned quickly.    \"I thought I heard a noise,\" replied Tom.    They both listened. There was a slight rustling in some bushes near the  shop.    \"It's a dog or a cat,\" declared Ned.    Tom took several cautious steps forward. Then he gave a spring, and  made a grab for some one or something.    \"Here! You let me be!\" yelled a protesting voice.    \"I will when I find out what you mean by sneaking around here,\"  retorted Tom, as he came back toward Ned, dragging with him a lad. \"It  wasn't a dog or a cat, Ned,\" spoke the young inventor.  \"It's Sam  Snedecker,\" and so it proved.    \"You let me alone!\" demanded Andy Foger's crony. \"I ain't done nothin'  to you,\" he whined.    \"Here, Ned, you hold him a minute, while I make an investigation,\"  called Tom, handing his prisoner over to his chum. \"Maybe Pete or Andy  are around.\"    \"No, they ain't. I came alone,\" said Sam quickly, but Tom, not heeding,  opened the shop, and, after turning on the electric lights, procured a  lantern. He began a search of the shrubbery around the shop, while Ned  held to the struggling Sam.          CHAPTER V    A MIDNIGHT ENCOUNTER      The moment Tom disappeared behind his machine shop, Sam Snedecker began  a desperate struggle to escape from Ned Newton.  Now Ned was a muscular  lad, but his work in the bank was confining, and he did not have the  chance to get out doors and exercise, as Sam had. Consequently Ned had  his hands full in holding to the squirming crony of Andy Foger.    \"You let me go!\" demanded Sam, as he tried to twist loose.    \"Not if I know it!\" panted Ned.    Sam gave a sudden twist. Ned's foot slipped in the grass, and in a  moment he went down, with Sam on top of him. Still he did not let go,  and, finding he was still a prisoner Sam adopted new tactics.    Using his fists Sam began to pound Ned, but the bank employee, though  suffering, would not call for help, to summon back Tom, who was, by  this time, at the rear of the shop, looking about.  Silently in the  dark the two fought, and Ned found that Sam was getting away. Then  Ned's hand came in contact with Sam's ear. It was the misfortune of the  bully to have rather a large hearing apparatus, and once Ned got his  fingers on an ear there was room enough to afford a good grip. He  closed his hold tightly, and began to twist. This was too much for Sam.  He set up a lusty howl.    \"Wow! Ouch! Let go!\" he pleaded, and he ceased to pound Ned, and no  longer tried to escape. Tom came back on the run.    \"What's the matter?\" he cried. Then his light flashed on the two  prostrate lads, and he understood without asking any further questions.    \"Get up!\" he cried, seizing Sam by the back of his neck, and yanking  him to his feet. Ned arose, and secured a better grip on the sneaking  lad.    \"What's up?\" demanded Tom, and Ned explained, following it by the  question:    \"See any more of 'em?\"    \"No, I guess he was here all alone,\" replied the young inventor. \"What  do you mean by sneaking around here this time of night?\" he demanded of  the captive.    \"Don't you wish you knew?\" was Sam's answer, with a leer. He realized  that he had a certain advantage.    \"You'd better tell before I turn you over to the police!\" said Tom,  sternly.    \"You--you wouldn't do that; would you?\" and Sam's voice that had been  bold, became shaky.    \"You were trespassing on our property, and that's against the law,\"  declared Tom. \"We have signs posted, warning people to keep off.\"    \"I didn't mean any harm,\" whined Sam.    \"Then what were you doing here, at this hour?\"    \"I was just taking a short cut home. I was out riding with Andy in his  auto, and it broke down. I had to walk home, and I came this way. I  didn't know you didn't allow people to cross your back lot. I wasn't  doin' anything.\"    Tom hesitated. Sam might be telling the truth, but it was doubtful.    \"What happened to Andy's auto?\" the young inventor asked.    \"He broke a wheel, going over a big stone on Berk's hill. He went to  tell some one in the repair shop to go after the car, and I came on  home. You've got no right to arrest me.\"    \"I ought to, on general principles,\" commented Tom. \"Well, skip out,  and don't you come around here again. I'm going to get a savage bull  dog, and the first one who comes sneaking around here after dark will  be sorry. Move along now!\"    Tom and Ned released their holds of Sam, and the latter lost no time in  obeying the injunction to make himself scarce. He was soon lost to  sight in the darkness.    \"Think he was up to some mischief?\" asked Ned.    \"I'm almost sure of it,\" replied Tom, \"but "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/953"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Big Tunnel; Or, The Hidden City of the Andes (#5)"],[1,"regarding possible plans. Tom sent  out word to one of his men to keep a sharp watch around the house and  grounds, against the possible return of Waddington, but nothing more  was seen of him, at least for the time being.    Mr. Titus drew up a sort of tentative agreement with Tom, binding his  firm to pay a large sum in case the young inventor was successful, and  then the contractor left, promising to have the rock samples come on  later by express.    Mr. Damon, after blessing a few dozen more or less impersonal objects,  took his departure, his fractious horse having quieted down in the  meanwhile, and Tom was left to himself.    \"I wonder what I've let myself in for now,\" the youth mused, as he went  back to his laboratory. \"It's a new field for me--tunnel blasting.  Well, perhaps something may come of it.\"    But of the strange adventure that was to follow his agreement to help  Mr. Titus, our hero, Tom Swift, had not the least inkling.    Tom went back to his labors over the gyroscope problem, but he could  arrive at no satisfactory conclusion, and, tossing aside the papers,  covered with intricate figures, he exclaimed:    \"Oh, I'm going for a walk! This thing is getting on my nerves.\"    He strolled through the Shopton streets, and as he reached the  outskirts of the town, he saw just ahead of him the figure of a girl.  Tom quickened his pace, and presently was beside her.    \"Where are you going, Mary?\" he asked.    \"Oh, Tom! How you startled me!\" she exclaimed, turning around. \"I was  just thinking of you.\"    \"Thanks! Something nice?\"    \"I shan't tell you!\" and she blushed. \"But where are you going?\"    \"Walking with you!\"    Tom was nothing if not bold.    \"Hadn't you better wait until you're asked?\" she retorted,  mischievously.    \"If I did I might not get an invitation. So I'm going to invite myself,  and then I'm going to invite you in here to have an ice cream soda,\"  and he and Miss Nestor were soon seated at a table in a candy shop.    Tom had nearly finished his ice cream when he glanced toward the door,  and started at the sight of a man who was entering the place.    \"What's the matter?\" asked Mary. \"Did you drop some ice cream, Tom?\"    \"No, Mary. But that man--\"    Mary turned in time to see an excited man hurry out of the candy shop  after a hasty glance at Tom Swift.    \"Who was he?\" the girl asked.    \"I--er--oh, some one I thought I knew, but I guess I don't,\" said Tom,  quickly. \"Have some more cream, Mary?\"    \"No, thank you. Not now.\"    Tom was glad she did not care for any, as he was anxious to get  outside, and have a look at the man, for he thought he had recognized  the face as the same that had peered in his window. But when he and  Miss Nestor reached the front of the shop the strange man was not in  sight.    \"I guess he came in to cool off after his run,\" mused Tom, \"but when he  saw me he didn't care about it. I wonder if that was Waddington? He's a  persistent individual if it was he.\"    \"Are you undertaking any new adventures, Tom?\" asked Mary.    \"Well, I'm thinking of going to Peru.\"    \"Peru!\" she cried. \"Oh, what a long way to go! And when you get there  will you write to me? I'm collecting stamps, and I haven't any from  Peru.\"    \"Is that--er--the only reason you want me to write?\" asked Tom.    \"No,\" said Mary softly, as she ran up the walk.    Tom smiled as he turned away.    Three days later he received a box from New York. It contained the  samples from the Andes tunnel, and Tom at once began his experiments to  discover a suitable explosive for rending the hard stone.    \"It is compressed molten lava,\" said Mr. Swift. \"You'll never get an  explosive that will successfully blast that, Tom.\"    \"We'll see,\" declared the young inventor.          Chapter V    Mary's Present      Outside a rudely-constructed shack, in the middle of a large field,  about a mile away from the nearest of the buildings owned by Tom Swift  and his father, were gathered a group of figures one morning. From the  shack, trailing over the ground, were two insulated wires, which led to  a pile of rocks and earth some distance off. Out of the temporary  building came Koku, the giant, bearing in his arms a big rock, of  peculiar formation.    \"That's it, Koku!\" exclaimed Tom Swift. \"Now don't drop it on your  toes.\"    \"No, Master, me no drop,\" the giant said, as he strode off with the  heavy load as easily as a boy might carry a stone for his sling-shot.    Koku placed the big rock on top of the pile of dirt and stones and came  back to the hut, just as Eradicate, the colored man-of-all-work,  emerged. Koku was not looking ahead, and ran into Eradicate with such  force that the latter would have fallen had not the giant clasped his  big arms about him.    \"Heah now!  Whut yo' all doin' t' me?\" angrily demanded Eradicate. \"Yo'  done gone an' knocked de breff outen me, dat's whut yo' all done! I'll  bash yo' wif a rock, dat's what I'll do!\"    Koku, laughing, tried to explain that it was all an accident, but  Eradicate would not listen. He looked about for a stone to throw at the  giant, though it was doubtful, with his feeble strength, and  considering the great frame of the big man, if any damage would have  been done. But Eradicate saw no rocks nearer than the pile in which  ended the two insulated wires, and, with mutterings, the negro set off  in that direction, shuffling along on his rheumatic legs.    From the shack Tom Swift hailed:    \"Hi there, Rad! Come back! Where are you going?\"    \"I'se gwine t' git a rock, Massa Tom, an' bash de haid ob dat big  lummox ob a giant! He done knocked de breff outen me, so he did.\"    \"You come back from that stone pile!\" Tom ordered. \"I'm going to blow  it up in a minute, and if you get too near you'll have the breath  knocked out of you worse than Koku did it. Come back, I say!\"    But Eradicate was obstinate and kept on. Tom, who was adjusting a  firing battery in the shack, laughed, and then in exasperation cried:    \"Koku, go and get him and bring him back. Carry him if he won't come  any other way. I don't want the dear old chump to get the fright of his  life, and he sure will if he goes too close. Bring him back!\"    \"Koku bring, Master,\" was the giant's answer.    He ran toward Eradicate, who, seeing his tormentor approaching,  redoubled his shuffling pace toward the stone pile. But he was no match  for the giant, who, ignoring his struggles, picked up Eradicate, and,  flinging him over his shoulder like a sack of meal, brought him to the  shack.    \"There him be, Master!\" said the giant.    \"So I see,\" laughed Tom. \"Now you stay here, Rad.\"    \"No, sah!  No, sah, Massa Tom! I--I'se gwine t' git a rock an'--an'  bash his haid--dat's what I'se gwine t' do!\" and the colored man tried  to struggle to his feet.    \"Look out now!\" cried Tom, suddenly. \"If things go right there won't be  a rock left for you to 'bash' anybody's head with, Rad. Look out!\"    The three cowered inside the shack, which, though it was rudely made,  was built of heavy logs and planks, with a fronting of sod and bags of  sand.    Tom turned a switch. There was a loud report, and where the stone pile  had been there was a big hole in the ground, while the air was filled  with fragments of rock and dirt.  These came down in a shower on the  roof of the shack, and Eradicate covered his ears with his trembling  hands.    \"Am--am de world comin' to de end, Massa Tom?\" he asked.  \"Am dat  Gabriel's trump I done heah?\"    \"No, you dear old goose!\" laughed the young inventor.  \"That was just a  charge of my new explosive--a small charge, too. But it seems to have  done the work.\"    He ran from the shack to the place where the rock pile had been, and  picked up several small fragments.    \"Busted all to pieces!\" exulted Tom Swift. \"Not a piece left as big as  a hickory nut. That's going some! I've got the right mixture at last.  If an ounce did that, a few hundred pounds ought to knock that Andes  tunnel through the mountain in no time. I'll telegraph to Mr. Titus.\"    Leaving Koku and Rad to collect the wires and firing apparatus, there  being no danger now, as no explosive was left in the shack, Tom made  his way back to the house. His father met him.    \"Well, Tom,\" he asked, \"another failure?\"    \"No, Dad! Success! This time I turned the trick. I seem to have gotten  just the right mixture. Look, these are some of the pieces left from  the big rock--one of the samples Mr. Titus sent me. It was all cracked  up as small as this,\" and he held out the fragments he had picked up in  the field.    Mr. Swift regarded them for a few moments.    \"That's better, Tom,\" he said. \"I didn't think you could get an  explosive that would successfully shatter that hard rock, but you seem  to have done it. Have you the formula all worked out?\"    \"All worked out, Dad. I only made a small quantity, but the same  proportions will hold good for the larger amounts.  I'm going to start  in and make it now. And then--Ho! for Peru!\"    Tom struck an attitude, such as some old discoverer might have assumed,  and then he hurried into the house to telephone a telegram to the  Shopton office. The message was to Mr. Titus, and read:      \"Explosive success. Start making it at once. Ready for Peru in month's  time.\"      \"Thirteen words,\" repeated Tom, as the operator called them back to  him. \"I hope that doesn't mean bad luck.\"    The experiment which Tom Swift had just brought to a successful  conclusion was one of many he had conducted, extending over several  wearying weeks.    As soon as Tom had received the samples of the rock he had begun to  experiment. First he tried some of the explosive that was so successful  in the giant cannon. As he had feared, it was not what was needed. It  cracked the rock, but did not disintegrate it, and that was what was  needed.  The hard rock must be broken up into fragments that could be  easily handled. Merely to crack it necessitated further explosions,"]]]
