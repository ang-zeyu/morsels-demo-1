The  \"munengana,\"or machila-man, is active in offering his light cane  palanquin, and he chaffs the \"mean white\" who is compelled to  walk, bitterly as did the sedan-chairmen of Bath before the days  of Beau Nash. Of course the Quitandeira, or market-woman, holds  her own. The rest of the street population seems to consist of  negro \"infantry\" and black Portuguese pigs, gaunt and long-  legged. The favourite passe-temps is to lie prone in sun or  shade, chattering and smoking the cachimbo, a heavy clay pipe,  with peculiar stem--\"to sleep supine,\" say the Arabs, \"is the  position of saints; on the dexter side, of kings; on the  sinister, of learned men; and on the belly, of devils.\"                                      Chapter III.        The Festival--a Trip to Calumbo--portuguese Hospitality.        My first step after reaching S. Paolo de Loanda was to call upon  Mr. Commissioner Vredenburg, who had lately taken up the  undesirable appointment, and who, moreover, had brought a pretty  French wife from Pará. I had warned him that he was risking her  life and that of her child; he bravely made the attempt and  nearly lost them both. I have reason to be grateful to him and to  Mr. Vice-consul E. H. Hewett for hospitality during my stay at  the Angolan capital. There is a place called an hotel, but it is  in the Seven Dials of the African city, and--nothing more need be  said.    Fortunately for me, as for herself, Loanda had got rid of Mr.  Vredenburg's predecessor, who soon followed the lamented Richard  Brand, first British Consul, appointed in 1844. The \"real whole-  hearted Englishman\" was after that modern type, of which La  Grundy so highly approves. An honest man, who does not hold to  the British idea that \"getting on in the world\" is Nature's first  law, would be sorely puzzled by such a career.    The day after my arrival was the festival which gives to São  Paulo de Loanda its ecclesiastical name \"da Assumpção.\" The  ceremonies of the day were duly set forth in the Boletim Official  do Governo Geral da Provincia de Angola. A military salute and  peals of bells aroused us at dawn; followed a review of the  troops, white and black; and a devout procession, flags flying  and bands playing, paced through the chief streets to the  Cathedral. A visit of ceremony in uniform to the Governor-  General, Captain José Baptista de Andrade, a historic name in  Angola, led to an invitation for the evening, a pleasant soirée  of both sexes. The reception was cordial: whatever be the  grievances of statesmen and historians, lawyers and slave-  mongers, Portuguese officers are always most friendly to their  English brethren. The large and airy rooms were hung with  portraits of the several dignitaries, and there was an Old World  look about Government House, like the Paço at Pangim (Goa). Fifty  years ago colonial society was almost entirely masculine; if you  ever met a white woman it was in a well-curtained manchila  surrounded by \"mucambas\" or \"mucacamas, negro waiting maids:\" as  the old missioner tells us, \"when they go abroad, which is  seldom, they are carried in a covered net with attendance of  captives.\" All this is changed, except as regards leaving the  house, which is never done during the day: constitutionals are  not wanted in the tropics, and the negroes everywhere make the  streets unfit, except for any but the very strongest-minded of  the weaker sex. The evenings at Government House are passed with  music and dancing, and petits jeux innocents for the juniors,  whilst the seniors talk and play voltarete till midnight. I well  remember one charming face, but I fear to talk about it--ten  years in Africa cannot pass without the saddest changes.    With an eye to future exploration, I was anxious to see something  of the style of travel in Angola, and to prospect the proposed  line of railway intended to checkmate the bar of the river  Cuanza. The Cassange (Kasanjí) war on the eastern frontier had  just ended honourably to Portuguese arms, but it proved costly;  the rich traffic of the interior had fallen off, and the well-  known Feira was sending down its fairings to independent  Kinsembo. Moreover, in order to raise funds for the rail, the  local Government talked of granting the land to an English  company for growing the highly prized gossypium arboreum.    Sr. João Soares Caldeira, C.E., kindly asked me to join his  party, which started early on August 19. All rode the tipoia, a  mere maca or hammock sadly heating to the back, but handier than  the manchila: the bearers wore loose waistbelts, with a dozen  small sheep's bells on the crupper, intended to proclaim our  importance, and supposed to frighten away wild beasts. These  gentry often require the stimulus of \"ndokwe\" (go on), but seldom  the sedative of \"malemba\" (gently) or \"quinga\" (stop). The \"boi-  cavallo,\" the riding bull (not ox) of the interior, which costs  about £4, is never used in these fashionable localities. I failed  to remark the line of trenches supposed to defend the land-side,  but I did remark the \"maiangas,\" said to be indigo vats made by  the Jesuits. After a hot depression we ascended a rough zigzag,  and halting we enjoyed a charming view of St. Paul. The domed  Morro concealing the squalid lower town was crowned with once  lordly buildings--cathedral, palace, treasury, and fort; the  colours of the ground-swell were red and white, with here and  there a dot of green; and the blue sea rose in its loveliness  beyond the hill horizon. For a whole league we were in the region  of \"arimos,\" or outside farms, where villages, villas, and  plantations, threaded by hot and sandy lanes with hedges of green  euphorbia, showed the former prosperity of the country. Beyond it  the land forms, as in Yoruba, lines of crescents bulging west or  seaward, quartz and pebbles showing here and there an old true  coast.    After a five hours' ride we reached Cavúa, the half-way house,  where breakfast had been sent on; the habitations are wretched  thatches, crowded with pigs and mosquitoes. Clearings had all  ended, and the red land formed broken waves of poor soil, almost  nude of vegetation at this mid-winter of the tropics, except  thickets of \"milk plant\" and forests of quadrangular cactus; the  latter are quaint as the dragon-tree, some twenty feet tall and  mostly sun-scorched to touchwood. The baobab (adansonia) is  apparently of two kinds, the \"Imbundeiro,\" hung with long-  stringed calabashes, which forms swarming-places for bees; and  the \"Aliconda\" (Nkondo), whose gourd is almost sessile, and whose  bark supplies fibre for cloth and ropes. The haskúl or big-aloe  of Somali-land was not absent, and, amongst other wild fruits, I  saw scattered over the ground the husks of a strychnine, like the  east African species. Deer, hares, and partridges are spoken of  in these solitudes, but they must be uncommonly hard to find at  such a season.    About three hours after leaving Cavúa were spent upon this high,  dry, and healthy desert, when suddenly we sighted the long  reaches of the Cuanza River, sharply contrasting, like the Nile,  with the tawny yellow grounds about its valley. A steep descent  over water-rolled pebbles showed the old bank; the other side,  far and blue, gave a goodly breadth of five miles; then we  plunged into the green selvage of the modern stream, following  muddy paths where the inundation had extended last June. Here  tobacco, orchilla, and indigo in the higher, and sugar-cane,  rice, and ricinus on the lower lands flourish to perfection. The  Angolan orchilla was first sent to Lisbon by Sr. F. R. Batalha:  it is a moss, like the tillandsia of the Southern United States,  and I afterwards recognized it in the island of Annobom. Passing  Pembe and other outlying hamlets, after nine hours of burning  sun, we entered Calumbo Town, and were hospitably lodged by the  Portuguese Commandant. We had followed the highway, as a line for  the intended railway had not yet been marked out, and the  distance measured 33,393 metres (= 20.75 English miles).    Calumbo is now a poor place, with a few dilapidated stone houses  in a mass of wattle and daub huts, surrounded by large \"arimos.\"  The whole \"Districto da Barra do Calumbo\" contains only 444  hearths. A little stone pier, which Loanda wants, projects into  the stream; the lime was formerly procured from shells, but in  1761 calcareous stone was found near the Dande stream. The  sightliest part is the vegetation, glorious ceibas (bombax) used  for dug-outs; baobabs, tamarinds which supply cooling fruit and  distilled waters; limes and bitter oranges. The most remarkable  growth is the kaju or cashew nut: an old traveller quaintly  describes it \"as like St. John's apple with a chestnut at the end  of it.\" M. Valdez (\"Six Years of a Traveller's Life,\" vol. ii.  267), calls it \"a strange kind of fruit,\" though it was very  familiar to his cousins in the Brazil, of which it is an  aborigine. Here it is not made into wine as at Goa: \"Kaju-brandy\"  is unknown, and the gum, almost equal to that of the acacia, is  utterly neglected. A dense and shady avenue of these trees, ten  paces apart, leads from the river to the parish church of S.  José, mentioned by Carli in 1666: an inscription informs us that  it was rebuilt in 1850, but the patron is stored away in a  lumber-room, and the bats have taken the place of the priest.  Portugal has perhaps gone too far in abolishing these church  establishments, but it is a reaction which will lead to the  golden mean.    The site of Calumbo is well chosen, commanding a fine view, and  raised above the damps of the cold Cuanza, whose stagnant lagoon,  the Lagôa do Muge on the other side, is divided from the main  branch by a low islet with palms and some cultivation. At the  base of Church Hill are huts of the Mubiri or blacksmiths,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5762"],[0,"Grammar and Vocabulary of the Lau Language, Solomon Islands (#5)"],[1," na asua_  day and night, _manata suli_ to know.    _Fafi_ means, about, concerning, because of, around, on: _gera ogu  fafia_ they crowded round him, _nia alua abana fafia_ he laid his  hand on him, _lau fafi_ to rescue, _fafi taa_ what about, why;  _fuana_ in order that, _mae fuana_ to die to his disadvantage, _soe  ledia fuana_ question him about it, _bae fuana_ forbid him, _fuana  taa_ wherefore?    Of the two instrumental prepositions _ana_ is the one in more  general use, its meaning is with: _doo gera saungia ana_ the thing  they killed him with. _Ana_ appears to denote the actual instrument,  _ani_ the method of action; _ani_ may be translated withal. When the  noun denoting the instrument is not preceded by an article or when  the noun is used in a general sense, _ani_ is used in the place of  _ana_: _suu fafia ani taa_ to clothe himself with what? _lea ani  ola_ to go by canoe.    The pronoun _a_ may be suffixed to _ani_; _tasi doo gera  qaifamanatai ania_ the thing they taught withal; _ka modea na toongi  ua inao ania_ to mend the old garment withal.    _Ana_ also denotes at, in, place where, among: _luma ana foaa_  (_luma ni foaa_) a house of prayer, _kakao ana ano_ an earthen  vessel, _nia liu ana ta maaedangi_ he went on a certain day, _tani  ai ana aigi_ some of the people, _nia saea ana satana_ he called him  by his name, _o ngalia ana ati_ from whom did you get it? _lea ana  fera_ to go into the country. _Ani_ is used as meaning in, _e langi  ani nau_ there is nothing in me, _gera ote gera ani nau_ they will  have nothing to do with me.    _Fai_ means with: _faioe_ with thee, _qaimani fai_ to help, _oko  gaimani fainau_ you help me. The genitive _ni_ may be added, _lea  fainia_ go with him; _fainia_ moreover, and.    _Sia_ means at, at home, and always has the suffixed pronoun.  By  the ordinary Melanesian idiom place at comes to be used of motion  to: _siagamelu chez nous_, _siena ere_ beside the fire, _lea mai  siegu_ come here to me. _Usi_ means over, on behalf of, for: _gera  ngisu usia_ they spat on him, _na captain usia na too_ a captain  over the people, _na taba olisia usia na aigi_ a redemption for the  people.    The genitives have been dealt with under nouns: _i_ is in most  general use, both are used to express purpose, and _ni_ also denotes  for, belonging to: _fasia muka manata ni bae uri_ think not to say  thus, _gera mou ni oli_ they feared to return, _ka ote nia ni  rosuli_ he is tired of obeying.    2. Compound prepositions.    Some of these are nouns used with the locative; the pronoun is  suffixed as the actual object or as the anticipatory object when a  noun follows: _i fafo_ above, _i fara_ beneath, _i lao_ within. The  locative need not be used with _lao_: _lao rodo_ in the night, _lao  tala_ in the path, _lao salo_ in the sky.  Some are constructed from  verbal nouns to which the suffixed pronoun is always added:  _fonosia_ in front of him, _nia initoo fonosi gera_ he ruled over  them, _fonosi taa_ to meet what? for what purpose? Certain verbs are  used as prepositions: _maasi_ to await, _garangi_ to be near.      CONJUNCTIONS.    Copulative, _ma_.  Adversative, _ta_, _ma ta_  Connective, _ta_.  Disjunctive, _langi_, _langi fa_, _ma langi_, _ma ka langi_.  Conditional, _ana_, _ma ana_, _saea_.  Illative, _fi fe_.    A mark of quotation is _saea_, _uri_. Neither, nor, is expressed by  a negative followed by _ma_. Until is _dao ana_, _lea dao ana_.      NUMERALS.    The numerical system is decimal. All numbers over the tens are  expressed in tens.    1. Cardinals.    1. _eta_, _ta_, _te_.  2. _e rua_, _ro_.  3. _e olu_.  4. _e fai_.  5. _e lima_.  6. _e ono_.  7. _e qalu_.  8. _e fiu_.  9. _e siqa_.  10. _e tangafulu_, _aqala_.    In numbers other than _eta_ the initial _e_ is omitted in quick  counting. In composition one is _ta_, two is _ro_, _te_ generally  means only: _rua_ is reduplicated into _ruarua_, _tau ruarua_  equidistant.    The prefix _too_ forms distributives: _too ro doo_ two things at a  time. _Nima_ is used as well as _lima_ for five. Though _qalu_  eight, appears in the translations as used of an indefinite number  it is doubtful whether such use is correct. _Tangafulu_ is the tenth  of a series; _aqala_ is used for ten denoting a unit, _aqala fono_ a  full ten.    To express units above ten _mana_ is employed: _aqala mana fai_  fourteen.    One hundred is _tangalau_: _tangale doo_ one hundred things. The sum  above the hundred is expressed by _mana_: _tangalau fai aqala mana  fai_ one hundred and forty-four. One thousand is _too_.    2. Ordinals.    The cardinals with a substantival ending _na_ form ordinals.    First, _etana_.  Fourth, _faina_. Seventh, _fiuna_.  Second, _ruana_. Fifth, _limana_. Eighth, _qaluna_.  Third, _oluna_.  Sixth, _onona_.  Ninth, _siqana_.    Ordinals precede the noun: _ruana na mwane_ the second man.    Ordinals are used to express the number of times: _eruana lau nia  lea go_ he went away the second time.    _Ruana_ also means fellow: _na ruana gera_ their fellows.    Tenth is expressed by _tangafulu ana_: _aqala maaedangi mana ruana_  the twelfth day, _tangalau ro aqala mana etana_ one hundred and  twenty-first.    _Efita_ how many, is used with the substantival termination _na_:  _efitana_ what number?    3. Multiplicatives.    The article _fe_ is employed to form multiplicatives: _guka fai fe  olila_ I shall return four times, _sasigu ka fita fe ode doo taala  fuagu_ how often shall my brother harm me? _tafe_ once.    The causative _fa_ does not make multiplicatives except in the case  of _faoroa_ often.      EXCLAMATIONS.    _Iu_, _iuka_, assent. _Oto mone_ is that so? _Ne_ is used in  questions, _ati ne satamu_ what is your name? _na mwela a Joseph e  langi ne_ Is He not the son of Joseph? _Aia_ sums up, so there, well  then! _Oimae_ alas! The noun _ai_, person, is added to proper names  to call attention, _Joe ai_ hey, Joe!            LAU VOCABULARY    A.    _a_ 1, personal article: used with the names of males, both native  and foreign, _a Masuraa_, _a Luke_; is used also with _doo_, thing,  _a doo_ So-and-So, _a doo na_, the person; is seen also in _ati_  who?
