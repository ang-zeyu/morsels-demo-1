Years would pass.  Cameron seemed to see them,  too; and likewise destiny leading a child down into this forlorn waste,  where she would find love and fortune, and the grave of her father.    Cameron covered the dark, still face of his comrade from the light of  the waning moon.    That action was the severing of his hold on realities.  They fell away  from him in final separation.  Vaguely, dreamily he seemed to behold  his soul.  Night merged into gray day; and night came again, weird and  dark.  Then up out of the vast void of the desert, from the silence and  illimitableness, trooped his phantoms of peace. Majestically they  formed around him, marshalling and mustering in ceremonious state, and  moved to lay upon him their passionless serenity.        I    OLD FRIENDS    RICHARD GALE reflected that his sojourn in the West had been what his  disgusted father had predicted--idling here and there, with no  objective point or purpose.    It was reflection such as this, only more serious and perhaps somewhat  desperate, that had brought Gale down to the border. For some time the  newspapers had been printing news of Mexican revolution, guerrilla  warfare, United States cavalry patrolling the international line,  American cowboys fighting with the rebels, and wild stories of bold  raiders and bandits.  But as opportunity, and adventure, too, had  apparently given him a wide berth in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, he had  struck southwest for the Arizona border, where he hoped to see some  stirring life.  He did not care very much what happened.  Months of  futile wandering in the hope of finding a place where he fitted had  inclined Richard to his father's opinion.    It was after dark one evening in early October when Richard arrived in  Casita.  He was surprised to find that it was evidently a town of  importance.  There was a jostling, jabbering, sombreroed crowd of  Mexicans around the railroad station.  He felt as if he were in a  foreign country.  After a while he saw several men of his nationality,  one of whom he engaged to carry his luggage to a hotel.  They walked up  a wide, well-lighted street lined with buildings in which were bright  windows.  Of the many people encountered by Gale most were Mexicans.  His guide explained that the smaller half of Casita lay in Arizona, the  other half in Mexico, and of several thousand inhabitants the majority  belonged on the southern side of the street, which was the boundary  line.  He also said that rebels had entered the town that day, causing  a good deal of excitement.    Gale was almost at the end of his financial resources, which fact  occasioned him to turn away from a pretentious hotel and to ask his  guide for a cheaper lodging-house.  When this was found, a sight of the  loungers in the office, and also a desire for comfort, persuaded Gale  to change his traveling-clothes for rough outing garb and boots.    \"Well, I'm almost broke,\" he soliloquized, thoughtfully.  \"The governor  said I wouldn't make any money.  He's right--so far. And he said I'd be  coming home beaten.  There he's wrong.  I've got a hunch that something  'll happen to me in this Greaser town.\"    He went out into a wide, whitewashed, high-ceiled corridor, and from  that into an immense room which, but for pool tables, bar, benches,  would have been like a courtyard.  The floor was cobblestoned, the  walls were of adobe, and the large windows opened like doors.  A blue  cloud of smoke filled the place.  Gale heard the click of pool balls  and the clink of glasses along the crowded bar.  Bare-legged,  sandal-footed Mexicans in white rubbed shoulders with Mexicans mantled  in black and red.  There were others in tight-fitting blue uniforms  with gold fringe or tassels at the shoulders.  These men wore belts  with heavy, bone-handled guns, and evidently were the rurales, or  native policemen.  There were black-bearded, coarse-visaged Americans,  some gambling round the little tables, others drinking.  The pool  tables were the center of a noisy crowd of younger men, several of whom  were unsteady on their feet.  There were khaki-clad cavalrymen  strutting in and out.    At one end of the room, somewhat apart from the general meelee, was a  group of six men round a little table, four of whom were seated, the  other two standing.  These last two drew a second glance from Gale.  The sharp-featured, bronzed faces and piercing eyes, the tall, slender,  loosely jointed bodies, the quiet, easy, reckless air that seemed to be  a part of the men--these things would plainly have stamped them as  cowboys without the buckled sombreros, the colored scarfs, the  high-topped, high-heeled boots with great silver-roweled spurs.  Gale  did not fail to note, also, that these cowboys wore guns, and this fact  was rather a shock to his idea of the modern West.  It caused him to  give some credence to the rumors of fighting along the border, and he  felt a thrill.    He satisfied his hunger in a restaurant adjoining, and as he stepped  back into the saloon a man wearing a military cape jostled him.  Apologies from both were instant.  Gale was moving on when the other  stopped short as if startled, and, leaning forward, exclaimed:    \"Dick Gale?\"    \"You've got me,\" replied Gale, in surprise.  \"But I don't know you.\"    He could not see the stranger's face, because it was wholly shaded by a  wide-brimmed hat pulled well down.    \"By Jove!  It's Dick!  If this isn't great!  Don't you know me?\"    \"I've heard your voice somewhere,\" replied Gale.  \"Maybe I'll recognize  you if you come out from under that bonnet.\"    For answer the man, suddenly manifesting thought of himself, hurriedly  drew Gale into the restaurant, where he thrust back his hat to disclose  a handsome, sunburned face.    \"George Thorne!  So help me--\"    \"'S-s-ssh.  You needn't yell,\" interrupted the other, as he met Gale's  outstretched hand.  There was a close, hard, straining grip. \"I must  not be recognized here.  There are reasons.  I'll explain in a minute.  Say, but it's fine to see you!  Five years, Dick, five years since I  saw you run down University Field and spread-eagle the whole Wisconsin  football team.\"    \"Don't recollect that,\" replied Dick, laughing.  \"George, I'll bet you  I'm gladder to see you than you are to see me.  It seems so long.  You  went into the army, didn't you?\"    \"I did.  I'm here now with the Ninth Cavalry.  But--never mind me.  What're you doing way down here?  Say, I just noticed your togs. Dick,  you can't be going in for mining or ranching, not in this God-forsaken  desert?\"    \"On the square, George, I don't know any more why I'm here than--than  you know.\"    \"Well, that beats me!\" ejaculated Thorne, sitting back in his chair,  amaze and concern in his expression.  \"What the devil's wrong? Your old  man's got too much money for you ever to be up against it. Dick, you  couldn't have gone to the bad?\"    A tide of emotion surged over Gale.  How good it was to meet a  friend--some one to whom to talk!  He had never appreciated his  loneliness until that moment.    \"George, how I ever drifted down here I don't know.  I didn't exactly  quarrel with the governor.  But--damn it, Dad hurt me--shamed me, and I  dug out for the West.  It was this way. After leaving college I tried  to please him by tackling one thing after another that he set me to do.  On the square, I had no head for business.  I made a mess of  everything.  The governor got sore. He kept ramming the harpoon into me  till I just couldn't stand it. What little ability I possessed deserted  me when I got my back up, and there you are.  Dad and I had a rather  uncomfortable half hour. When I quit--when I told him straight out that  I was going West to fare for myself, why, it wouldn't have been so  tough if he hadn't laughed at me.  He called me a rich man's son--an  idle, easy-going spineless swell.  He said I didn't even have character  enough to be out and out bad.  He said I didn't have sense enough to  marry one of the nice girls in my sister's crowd.  He said I couldn't  get back home unless I sent to him for money.  He said he didn't  believe I could fight--could really make a fight for anything under the  sun.  Oh--he--he shot it into me, all right.\"    Dick dropped his head upon his hands, somewhat ashamed of the smarting  dimness in his eyes.  He had not meant to say so much. Yet what a  relief to let out that long-congested burden!    \"Fight!\" cried Thorne, hotly.  \"What's ailing him?  Didn't they call  you Biff Gale in college?  Dick, you were one of the best men Stagg  ever developed.  I heard him say so--that you were the fastest,  one-hundred-and-seventy-five-pound man he'd ever trained, the hardest  to stop.\"    \"The governor didn't count football,\" said Dick.  \"He didn't mean that  kind of fight.  When I left home I don't think I had an idea what was  wrong with me.  But, George, I think I know now.  I was a rich man's  son--spoiled, dependent, absolutely ignorant of the value of money.  I  haven't yet discovered any earning capacity in me.  I seem to be unable  to do anything with my hands.  That's the trouble.  But I'm at the end  of my tether now.  And I'm going to punch cattle or be a miner, or do  some real stunt--like joining the rebels.\"    \"Aha!  I thought you'd spring that last one on me,\" declared Thorne,  wagging his head.  \"Well, you just forget it.  Say, old boy, there's  something doing in Mexico.  The United States in general doesn't  realize it.  But across that line there are crazy revolutionists,  ill-paid soldiers, guerrilla leaders, raiders, robbers, outlaws,  bandits galore, starving peons by the thousand, girls and women in  terror.  Mexico is like some of her volcanoes--ready to erupt fire and  hell!  Don't make the awful mistake of joining rebel forces.

There were such rejoicings when she went in to her parents that it  seemed as if they would never come to an end. Everyone thought that he  could never be sufficiently grateful to her for all she had done for  them all. Now they had everything that they wanted, and everything was  as good as it could be. They all asked her how she was getting on where  she was. All was well with her too, she said; and she had everything  that she could want. What other answers she gave I cannot say, but I am  pretty sure that they did not learn much from her. But in the afternoon,  after they had dined at midday, all happened just as the White Bear had  said. Her mother wanted to talk with her alone in her own chamber. But  she remembered what the White Bear had said, and would on no account go.  \"What we have to say can be said at any time,\" she answered. But somehow  or other her mother at last persuaded her, and she was forced to tell  the whole story. So she told how every night a man came and lay down  beside her when the lights were all put out, and how she never saw him,  because he always went away before it grew light in the morning, and how  she continually went about in sadness, thinking how happy she would  be if she could but see him, and how all day long she had to go about  alone, and it was so dull and solitary. \"Oh!\" cried the mother, in  horror, \"you are very likely sleeping with a troll! But I will teach you  a way to see him. You shall have a bit of one of my candles, which you  can take away with you hidden in your breast. Look at him with that when  he is asleep, but take care not to let any tallow drop upon him.\"    So she took the candle, and hid it in her breast, and when evening drew  near the White Bear came to fetch her away. When they had gone some  distance on their way, the White Bear asked her if everything had not  happened just as he had foretold, and she could not but own that it had.  \"Then, if you have done what your mother wished,\" said he, \"you have  brought great misery on both of us.\" \"No,\" she said, \"I have not done  anything at all.\" So when she had reached home and had gone to bed it  was just the same as it had been before, and a man came and lay down  beside her, and late at night, when she could hear that he was sleeping,  she got up and kindled a light, lit her candle, let her light shine on  him, and saw him, and he was the handsomest prince that eyes had ever  beheld, and she loved him so much that it seemed to her that she must  die if she did not kiss him that very moment. So she did kiss him; but  while she was doing it she let three drops of hot tallow fall upon  his shirt, and he awoke. \"What have you done now?\" said he; \"you have  brought misery on both of us. If you had but held out for the space of  one year I should have been free. I have a step-mother who has bewitched  me so that I am a white bear by day and a man by night; but now all is  at an end between you and me, and I must leave you, and go to her. She  lives in a castle which lies east of the sun and west of the moon, and  there too is a princess with a nose which is three ells long, and she  now is the one whom I must marry.\"    She wept and lamented, but all in vain, for go he must. Then she asked  him if she could not go with him. But no, that could not be. \"Can you  tell me the way then, and I will seek you--that I may surely be allowed  to do!\"    \"Yes, you may do that,\" said he; \"but there is no way thither. It lies  east of the sun and west of the moon, and never would you find your way  there.\"    When she awoke in the morning both the Prince and the castle were gone,  and she was lying on a small green patch in the midst of a dark, thick  wood. By her side lay the self-same bundle of rags which she had brought  with her from her own home. So when she had rubbed the sleep out of her  eyes, and wept till she was weary, she set out on her way, and thus she  walked for many and many a long day, until at last she came to a great  mountain. Outside it an aged woman was sitting, playing with a golden  apple. The girl asked her if she knew the way to the Prince who lived  with his stepmother in the castle which lay east of the sun and west of  the moon, and who was to marry a princess with a nose which was three  ells long. \"How do you happen to know about him?\" inquired the old  woman; \"maybe you are she who ought to have had him.\" \"Yes, indeed, I  am,\" she said. \"So it is you, then?\" said the old woman; \"I know nothing  about him but that he dwells in a castle which is east of the sun and  west of the moon. You will be a long time in getting to it, if ever you  get to it at all; but you shall have the loan of my horse, and then you  can ride on it to an old woman who is a neighbor of mine: perhaps she  can tell you about him. When you have got there you must just strike the  horse beneath the left ear and bid it go home again; but you may take  the golden apple with you.\"    So the girl seated herself on the horse, and rode for a long, long way,  and at last she came to the mountain, where an aged woman was sitting  outside with a gold carding-comb. The girl asked her if she knew the way  to the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon; but she  said what the first old woman had said: \"I know nothing about it, but  that it is east of the sun and west of the moon, and that you will be a  long time in getting to it, if ever you get there at all; but you shall  have the loan of my horse to an old woman who lives the nearest to me:  perhaps she may know where the castle is, and when you have got to her  you may just strike the horse beneath the left ear and bid it go home  again.\" Then she gave her the gold carding-comb, for it might, perhaps,  be of use to her, she said.    So the girl seated herself on the horse, and rode a wearisome long way  onward again, and after a very long time she came to a great mountain,  where an aged woman was sitting, spinning at a golden spinning-wheel.  Of this woman, too, she inquired if she knew the way to the Prince, and  where to find the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon.  But it was only the same thing once again. \"Maybe it was you who should  have had the Prince,\" said the old woman. \"Yes, indeed, I should have  been the one,\" said the girl. But this old crone knew the way no better  than the others--it was east of the sun and west of the moon, she knew  that, \"and you will be a long time in getting to it, if ever you get  to it at all,\" she said; \"but you may have the loan of my horse, and I  think you had better ride to the East Wind, and ask him: perhaps he may  know where the castle is, and will blow you thither. But when you have  got to him you must just strike the horse beneath the left ear, and he  will come home again.\" And then she gave her the golden spinning-wheel,  saying: \"Perhaps you may find that you have a use for it.\"    The girl had to ride for a great many days, and for a long and wearisome  time, before she got there; but at last she did arrive, and then she  asked the East Wind if he could tell her the way to the Prince who dwelt  east of the sun and west of the moon. \"Well,\" said the East Wind, \"I  have heard tell of the Prince, and of his castle, but I do not know the  way to it, for I have never blown so far; but, if you like, I will go  with you to my brother the West Wind: he may know that, for he is much  stronger than I am. You may sit on my back, and then I can carry you  there.\" So she seated herself on his back, and they did go so swiftly!  When they got there, the East Wind went in and said that the girl whom  he had brought was the one who ought to have had the Prince up at the  castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon, and that now she  was traveling about to find him again, so he had come there with her,  and would like to hear if the West Wind knew whereabout the castle was.  \"No,\" said the West Wind; \"so far as that have I never blown; but if you  like I will go with you to the South Wind, for he is much stronger than  either of us, and he has roamed far and wide, and perhaps he can tell  you what you want to know. You may seat yourself on my back, and then I  will carry you to him.\".    So she did this, and journeyed to the South Wind, neither was she very  long on the way. When they had got there, the West Wind asked him if he  could tell her the way to the castle that lay east of the sun and west  of the moon, for she was the girl who ought to marry the Prince who  lived there. \"Oh, indeed!\" said the South Wind, \"is that she? Well,\"  said he, \"I have wandered about a great deal in my time, and in all  kinds of places, but I have never blown so far as that. If you like,  however, I will go with you to my brother, the North Wind; he is the  oldest and strongest of all of us, and if he does not know where it is  no one in the whole world will be able to tell you. You may sit upon  my back, and then I will carry you there.\" So she seated herself on his  back, and off he went from his house in great haste, and they were not  long on the way. When they came near the North Wind's dwelling, he was  so wild and frantic that they felt cold gusts a long while before they  got there. \"What do you want?\" he roared out from afar, and they froze  as they heard. Said the South Wind:"]]]
