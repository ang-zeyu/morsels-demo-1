A nervous, highly-strung man  like myself should not, and must not, be called upon to live in a  house where he is constantly meeting snakes and monkeys without  warning. Choose between me and--'    We had got as far as this when Eustace, the monkey, who I didn't  know was in the room at all, suddenly sprang on to his back. He is  very fond of Algie.    Would you believe it? Algie walked straight out of the house, still  holding the teaspoon, and has not returned. Later in the day he  called me up on the phone and said that, though he realized that a  man's place was the home, he declined to cross the threshold again  until I had got rid of Eustace and Clarence. I tried to reason with  him. I told him that he ought to think himself lucky it wasn't  anything worse than a monkey and a snake, for the last person Roscoe  Sherriff handled, an emotional actress named Devenish, had to keep a  young puma. But he wouldn't listen, and the end of it was that he  rang off and I have not seen or heard of him since.    I am broken-hearted. I won't give in, but I am having an awful time.  So, dearest Claire, do come over and help me. If you could possibly  sail by the _Atlantic_, leaving Southampton on the twenty-fourth of  this month, you would meet a friend of mine whom I think you would  like. His name is Dudley Pickering, and he made a fortune in  automobiles. I expect you have heard of the Pickering automobiles?    Darling Claire, do come, or I know I shall weaken and yield to  Algie's outrageous demands, for, though I would like to hit him  with a brick, I love him dearly.      Your affectionate       POLLY WETHERBY    Claire sank back against the cushioned seat and her eyes filled  with tears of disappointment. Of all the things which would have  chimed in with her discontented mood at that moment a sudden  flight to America was the most alluring. Only one consideration  held her back--she had not the money for her fare.    Polly might have thought of that, she reflected, bitterly. She  took the letter up again and saw that on the last page there was a  postscript--    PS.--I don't know how you are fixed for money, old girl, but if  things are the same with you as in the old days you can't be  rolling. So I have paid for a passage for you with the liner  people this side, and they have cabled their English office, so  you can sail whenever you want to. Come right over.    An hour later the manager of the Southampton branch of the White  Star Line was dazzled by an apparition, a beautiful girl who burst  in upon him with flushed face and shining eyes, demanding a berth on  the steamship _Atlantic_ and talking about a Lady Wetherby. Ten  minutes later, her passage secured, Claire was walking to the local  theatre to inform those in charge of the destinies of The Girl and  the Artist number one company that they must look elsewhere for a  substitute for Miss Claudia Winslow. Then she went back to her hotel  to write a letter home, notifying her mother of her plans.    She looked at her watch. It was six o'clock. Back in West  Kensington a rich smell of dinner would be floating through the  flat; the cook, watching the boiling cabbage, would be singing \"A  Few More Years Shall Roll\"; her mother would be sighing; and her  little brother Percy would be employed upon some juvenile  deviltry, the exact nature of which it was not possible to  conjecture, though one could be certain that it would be something  involving a deafening noise.    Claire smiled a happy smile.          4      The offices of Messrs Nichols, Nichols, Nichols, and Nichols were  in Lincoln's Inn Fields. The first Nichols had been dead since the  reign of King William the Fourth, the second since the jubilee  year of Queen Victoria. The remaining brace were Lord Dawlish's  friend Jerry and his father, a formidable old man who knew all the  shady secrets of all the noble families in England.    Bill walked up the stairs and was shown into the room where Jerry,  when his father's eye was upon him, gave his daily imitation of a  young man labouring with diligence and enthusiasm at the law. His  father being at the moment out at lunch, the junior partner was  practising putts with an umbrella and a ball of paper.    Jerry Nichols was not the typical lawyer. At Cambridge, where Bill  had first made his acquaintance, he had been notable for an  exuberance of which Lincoln's Inn Fields had not yet cured him.  There was an airy disregard for legal formalities about him which  exasperated his father, an attorney of the old school. He came to  the point, directly Bill entered the room, with a speed and levity  that would have appalled Nichols Senior, and must have caused the  other two Nicholses to revolve in their graves.    'Halloa, Bill, old man,' he said, prodding him amiably in the  waistcoat with the ferrule of the umbrella. 'How's the boy? Fine!  So'm I. So you got my message? Wonderful invention, the  telephone.'    'I've just come from the club.'    'Take a chair.'    'What's the matter?'    Jerry Nichols thrust Bill into a chair and seated himself on the  table.    'Now look here, Bill,' he said, 'this isn't the way we usually do  this sort of thing, and if the governor were here he would spend  an hour and a half rambling on about testators and beneficiary  legatees, and parties of the first part, and all that sort of rot.  But as he isn't here I want to know, as one pal to another, what  you've been doing to an old buster of the name of Nutcombe.'    'Nutcombe?'    'Nutcombe.'    'Not Ira Nutcombe?'    'Ira J. Nutcombe, formerly of Chicago, later of London, now a  disembodied spirit.'    'Is he dead?'    'Yes. And he's left you something like a million pounds.'    Lord Dawlish looked at his watch.    'Joking apart, Jerry, old man,' he said, 'what did you ask me to  come here for? The committee expects me to spend some of my time  at the club, and if I hang about here all the afternoon I shall  lose my job. Besides, I've got to get back to ask them for--'    Jerry Nichols clutched his forehead with both hands, raised both  hands to heaven, and then, as if despairing of calming himself by  these means, picked up a paper-weight from the desk and hurled it  at a portrait of the founder of the firm, which hung over the  mantelpiece. He got down from the table and crossed the room to  inspect the ruins.    Then, having taken a pair of scissors and cut the cord, he allowed  the portrait to fall to the floor.    He rang the bell. The prematurely-aged office-boy, who was  undoubtedly destined to become a member of the firm some day,  answered the ring.    'Perkins.'    'Yes, sir?'    'Inspect yonder _souffle_.'    'Yes, sir.'    'You have observed it?'    'Yes, sir.'    'You are wondering how it got there?'    'Yes, sir.'    'I will tell you. You and I were in here, discussing certain legal  minutiae in the interests of the firm, when it suddenly fell. We  both saw it and were very much surprised and startled. I soothed  your nervous system by giving you this half-crown. The whole  incident was very painful. Can you remember all this to tell my  father when he comes in? I shall be out lunching then.'    'Yes, sir.'    'An admirable lad that,' said Jerry Nichols as the door closed.  'He has been here two years, and I have never heard him say  anything except \"Yes, sir.\" He will go far. Well, now that I am  calmer let us return to your little matter. Honestly, Bill, you  make me sick. When I contemplate you the iron enters my soul. You  stand there talking about your tuppenny-ha'penny job as if it  mattered a cent whether you kept it or not. Can't you understand  plain English? Can't you realize that you can buy Brown's and turn  it into a moving-picture house if you like? You're a millionaire!'    Bill's face expressed no emotion whatsoever. Outwardly he appeared  unmoved. Inwardly he was a riot of bewilderment, incapable of  speech. He stared at Jerry dumbly.    'We've got the will in the old oak chest,' went on Jerry Nichols.  'I won't show it to you, partly because the governor has got the  key and he would have a fit if he knew that I was giving you early  information like this, and partly because you wouldn't understand  it. It is full of \"whereases\" and \"peradventures\" and \"heretofores\"  and similar swank, and there aren't any stops in it. It takes the legal  mind, like mine, to tackle wills. What it says, when you've peeled  off a few of the long words which they put in to make it more  interesting, is that old Nutcombe leaves you the money because  you are the only man who ever did him a disinterested kindness--and  what I want to get out of you is, what was the disinterested kindness?  Because I'm going straight out to do it to every elderly, rich-looking  man I can find till I pick a winner.'    Lord Dawlish found speech.    'Jerry, is this really true?'    'Gospel.'    'You aren't pulling my leg?'    'Pulling your leg? Of course I'm not pulling your leg. What do you  take me for? I'm a dry, hard-headed lawyer. The firm of Nichols,  Nichols, Nichols, and Nichols doesn't go about pulling people's  legs!'    'Good Lord!'    'It appears from the will that you worked this disinterested gag,  whatever it was, at Marvis Bay no longer ago than last year.  Wherein you showed a lot of sense, for Ira J., having altered his  will in your favour, apparently had no time before he died to  alter it again in somebody else's, which he would most certainly  have done if he had lived long enough, for his chief recreation  seems to have been making his will. To my certain knowledge he has  made three in the last two years. I've seen them. He was one of  those confirmed will-makers. He got the habit at an early age, and  was never able to shake it off.

As soon as the delegation landed, a telegram was despatched to Dayanand,  as everyone was anxious to make his personal acquaintance. In reply, he  said that he was obliged to go immediately to Hardwar, where hundreds of  thousands of pilgrims were expected to assemble, but he insisted on  our remaining behind, since cholera was certain to break out among the  devotees. He appointed a certain spot, at the foot of the Himalayas, in  the jab, where we were to meet in a month's time.    Alas! all this was written some time ago. Since then Swami Dayanand's  countenance has changed completely toward us. He is, now, an enemy of  the Theosophical Society and its two founders--Colonel Olcott and the  author of these letters. It appeared that, on entering into an offensive  and defensive alliance with the Society, Dayanand nourished the  hope that all its members, Christians, Brahmans and Buddhists, would  acknowledge His supremacy, and become members of the Arya Samaj.    Needless to say, this was impossible. The Theosophical Society rests on  the principle of complete non-interference with the religious beliefs  of its members. Toleration is its basis and its aims are purely  philosophical. This did not suit Dayanand. He wanted all the members,  either to become his disciples, or to be expelled from the Society. It  was quite clear that neither the President, nor the Council could assent  to such a claim. Englishmen and Americans, whether they were Christians  or Freethinkers, Buddhists, and especially Brahmans, revolted against  Dayanand, and unanimously demanded that the league should be broken.    However, all this happened later. At the time of which I speak we were  friends and allies of the Swami, and we learned with deep interest that  the Hardwar \"mela,\" which he was to visit, takes place every twelve  years, and is a kind of religious fair, which attracts representatives  from all the numerous sects of India.    Learned dissertations are read by the disputants in defence of their  peculiar doctrines, and the debates are held in public. This year  the Hardwar gathering was exceptionally numerous. The Sannyasis--the  mendicant monks of India--alone numbered 35,000 and the cholera,  foreseen by the Swami, actually broke out.        As we were not yet to start for the appointed meeting, we had plenty of  spare time before us; so we proceeded to examine Bombay.    The Tower of Silence, on the heights of the Malabar Hill, is the last  abode of all the sons of Zoroaster. It is, in fact, a Parsee cemetery.  Here their dead, rich and poor, men, women and children, are all laid in  a row, and in a few minutes nothing remains of them but bare skeletons.  A dismal impression is made upon a foreigner by these towers, where  absolute silence has reigned for centuries. This kind of building is  very common in every place were Parsees live and die. In Bombay, of six  towers, the largest was built 250 years ago, and the least but a short  time since. With few exceptions, they are round or square in shape, from  twenty to forty feet high, without roof, window, or door, but with a  single iron gate opening towards the East, and so small that it is  quite covered by a few bushes. The first corpse brought to a new  tower--\"dakhma\"--must be the body of the innocent child of a mobed  or priest. No one, not even the chief watcher, is allowed to approach  within a distance of thirty paces of these towers. Of all living human  beings \"nassesalars\"--corpse-carriers--alone enter and leave the \"Tower  of Silence.\" The life these men lead is simply wretched. No European  executioner's position is worse. They live quite apart from the rest  of the world, in whose eyes they are the most abject of beings. Being  forbidden to enter the markets, they must get their food as they can.  They are born, marry, and die, perfect strangers to all except their own  class, passing through the streets only to fetch the dead and carry them  to the tower. Even to be near one of them is a degradation. Entering  the tower with a corpse, covered, whatever may have been its rank or  position, with old white rags, they undress it and place it, in  silence, on one of the three rows presently to be described. Then, still  preserving the same silence, they come out, shut the gate, and burn the  rags.    Amongst the fire-worshippers, Death is divested of all his majesty and  is a mere object of disgust. As soon as the last hour of a sick person  seems to approach, everyone leaves the chamber of death, as much to  avoid impeding the departure of the soul from the body, as to shun the  risk of polluting the living by contact with the dead. The mobed alone  stays with the dying man for a while, and having whispered into his ear  the Zend-Avesta precepts, \"ashem-vohu\" and \"Yato-Ahuvarie,\" leaves the  room while the patient is still alive. Then a dog is brought and made  to look straight into his face. This ceremony is called \"sas-did,\"  the \"dog's-stare.\" A dog is the only living creature that the  \"Drux-nassu\"--the evil one--fears, and that is able to prevent him from  taking possession of the body. It must be strictly observed that no  one's shadow lies between the dying man and the dog, otherwise the whole  strength of the dog's gaze will be lost, and the demon will profit by  the occasion. The body remains on the spot where life left it, until the  nassesalars appear, their arms hidden to the shoulders under old bags,  to take it away. Having deposited it in an iron coffin--the same for  everyone--they carry it to the dakhma. If any one, who has once been  carried thither, should happen to regain consciousness, the nassesalars  are bound to kill him; for such a person, who has been polluted by one  touch of the dead bodies in the dakhma, has thereby lost all right  to return to the living, by doing so he would contaminate the whole  community. As some such cases have occurred, the Parsees are trying to  get a new law passed, that would allow the miserable ex-corpses to live  again amongst their friends, and that would compel the nassesalars to  leave the only gate of the dakhma unlocked, so that they might find a  way of retreat open to them. It is very curious, but it is said that the  vultures, which devour without hesitation the corpses, will never touch  those who are only apparently dead, but fly away uttering loud shrieks.  After a last prayer at the gate of the dakhma, pronounced from afar by  the mobed, and re-peated in chorus by the nassesalars, the dog ceremony  is repeated. In Bombay there is a dog, trained for this purpose, at the  entrance to the tower. Finally, the body is taken inside and placed on  one or other of the rows, according to its sex and age.    We have twice been present at the ceremonies of dying, and once of  burial, if I may be permitted to use such an incongruous term. In this  respect the Parsees are much more tolerant than the Hindus, who are  offended by the mere presence at their religious rites of an European.  N. Bayranji, a chief official of the tower, invited us to his house to  be present at the burial of some rich woman. So we witnessed all that  was going on at a distance of about forty paces, sitting quietly on  our obliging host's verandah. While the dog was staring into the dead  woman's face, we were gazing, as intently, but with much more disgust,  at the huge flock of vultures above the dakhma, that kept entering the  tower, and flying out again with pieces of human flesh in their beaks.  These birds, that build their nests in thousands round the Tower of  Silence, have been purposely imported from Persia. Indian vultures  proved to be too weak, and not sufficiently bloodthirsty, to perform  the process of stripping the bones with the despatch prescribed by  Zoroaster. We were told that the entire operation of denuding the bones  occupies no more than a few minutes. As soon as the ceremony was over,  we were led into another building, where a model of the dakhma was to be  seen. We could now very easily imagine what was to take place presently  inside the tower. In the centre there is a deep waterless well, covered  with a grating like the opening into a drain. Around it are three broad  circles, gradually sloping downwards. In each of them are coffin-like  receptacles for the bodies. There are three hundred and sixty-five such  places. The first and smallest row is destined for children, the second  for women, and the third for men. This threefold circle is symbolical of  three cardinal Zoroastrian virtues--pure thoughts, kind words, and good  actions. Thanks to the vultures, the bones are laid bare in less than  an hour, and, in two or three weeks, the tropical sun scorches them into  such a state of fragility, that the slightest breath of wind is enough  to reduce them to powder and to carry them down into the pit. No smell  is left behind, no source of plagues and epidemics. I do not know that  this way may not be preferable to cremation, which leaves in the air  about the Ghat a faint but disagreeable odour. The Ghat is a place  by the sea, or river shore, where Hindus burn their dead. Instead of  feeding the old Slavonic deity \"Mother Wet Earth\" with carrion, Parsees  give to Armasti pure dust. Armasti means, literally, \"fostering cow,\"  and Zoroaster teaches that the cultivation of land is the noblest of all  occupations in the eyes of God. Accordingly, the worship of Earth is  so sacred among the Parsees, that they take all possible precautions  against polluting the \"fostering cow\" that gives them \"a hundred golden  grains for every single grain.\" In the season of the Monsoon, when,  during four months, the rain pours incessantly down and washes into the  well everything that is left by the vultures, the water absorbed by the  earth is filtered, for the bottom of the well, the walls of which are  built of granite, is, to this end, "]]]
