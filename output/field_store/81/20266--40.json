To-morrow morning, if you really insist upon it, you may resume  your journey.\"    They consented to this, and some of the fox-servants led them to a  suite of lovely rooms in the big palace.    Button-Bright was afraid to be left alone, so Dorothy took him into her  own room.  While a maid-fox dressed the little girl's hair--which was a  bit tangled--and put some bright, fresh ribbons in it, another maid-fox  combed the hair on poor Button-Bright's face and head and brushed it  carefully, tying a pink bow to each of his pointed ears.  The maids  wanted to dress the children in fine costumes of woven feathers, such  as all the foxes wore; but neither of them consented to that.    \"A sailor suit and a fox head do not go well together,\" said one of the  maids, \"for no fox was ever a sailor that I can remember.\"    \"I'm not a fox!\" cried Button-Bright.    \"Alas, no,\" agreed the maid.  \"But you've got a lovely fox head on your  skinny shoulders, and that's ALMOST as good as being a fox.\"    The boy, reminded of his misfortune, began to cry again.  Dorothy  petted and comforted him and promised to find some way to restore him  his own head.    \"If we can manage to get to Ozma,\" she said, \"the Princess will change  you back to yourself in half a second; so you just wear that fox head  as comf't'bly as you can, dear, and don't worry about it at all.  It  isn't nearly as pretty as your own head, no matter what the foxes say;  but you can get along with it for a little while longer, can't you?\"    \"Don't know,\" said Button-Bright, doubtfully; but he didn't cry any  more after that.    Dorothy let the maids pin ribbons to her shoulders, after which they  were ready for the King's dinner.  When they met the shaggy man in the  splendid drawing room of the palace they found him just the same as  before.  He had refused to give up his shaggy clothes for new ones,  because if he did that he would no longer be the shaggy man, he said,  and he might have to get acquainted with himself all over again.    He told Dorothy he had brushed his shaggy hair and whiskers; but she  thought he must have brushed them the wrong way, for they were quite as  shaggy as before.    As for the company of foxes assembled to dine with the strangers, they  were most beautifully costumed, and their rich dresses made Dorothy's  simple gown and Button-Bright's sailor suit and the shaggy man's shaggy  clothes look commonplace.  But they treated their guests with great  respect and the King's dinner was a very good dinner indeed.  Foxes, as  you know, are fond of chicken and other fowl; so they served chicken  soup and roasted turkey and stewed duck and fried grouse and broiled  quail and goose pie, and as the cooking was excellent the King's guests  enjoyed the meal and ate heartily of the various dishes.    The party went to the theater, where they saw a play acted by foxes  dressed in costumes of brilliantly colored feathers.  The play was  about a fox-girl who was stolen by some wicked wolves and carried to  their cave; and just as they were about to kill her and eat her a  company of fox-soldiers marched up, saved the girl, and put all the  wicked wolves to death.    \"How do you like it?\" the King asked Dorothy.    \"Pretty well,\" she answered.  \"It reminds me of one of Mr. Aesop's  fables.\"    \"Don't mention Aesop to me, I beg of you!\" exclaimed King Dox.  \"I hate  that man's name.  He wrote a good deal about foxes, but always made  them out cruel and wicked, whereas we are gentle and kind, as you may  see.\"    \"But his fables showed you to be wise and clever, and more shrewd than  other animals,\" said the shaggy man, thoughtfully.    \"So we are.  There is no question about our knowing more than men do,\"  replied the King, proudly.  \"But we employ our wisdom to do good,  instead of harm; so that horrid Aesop did not know what he was talking  about.\"    They did not like to contradict him, because they felt he ought to know  the nature of foxes better than men did; so they sat still and watched  the play, and Button-Bright became so interested that for the time he  forgot he wore a fox head.    Afterward they went back to the palace and slept in soft beds stuffed  with feathers; for the foxes raised many fowl for food, and used their  feathers for clothing and to sleep upon.    Dorothy wondered why the animals living in Foxville did not wear just  their own hairy skins as wild foxes do; when she mentioned it to King  Dox he said they clothed themselves because they were civilized.    \"But you were born without clothes,\" she observed, \"and you don't seem  to me to need them.\"    \"So were human beings born without clothes,\" he replied; \"and until  they became civilized they wore only their natural skins.  But to  become civilized means to dress as elaborately and prettily as  possible, and to make a show of your clothes so your neighbors will  envy you, and for that reason both civilized foxes and civilized humans  spend most of their time dressing themselves.\"    \"I don't,\" declared the shaggy man.    \"That is true,\" said the King, looking at him carefully; \"but perhaps  you are not civilized.\"    After a sound sleep and a good night's rest they had their breakfast  with the King and then bade his Majesty good-bye.    \"You've been kind to us--'cept poor Button-Bright,\" said Dorothy, \"and  we've had a nice time in Foxville.\"    \"Then,\" said King Dox, \"perhaps you'll be good enough to get me an  invitation to Princess Ozma's birthday celebration.\"    \"I'll try,\" she promised; \"if I see her in time.\"    \"It's on the twenty-first, remember,\" he continued; \"and if you'll just  see that I'm invited I'll find a way to cross the Dreadful Desert into  the marvelous Land of Oz.  I've always wanted to visit the Emerald  City, so I'm sure it was fortunate you arrived here just when you did,  you being Princess Ozma's friend and able to assist me in getting the  invitation.\"    \"If I see Ozma I'll ask her to invite you,\" she replied.    The Fox-King had a delightful luncheon put up for them, which the  shaggy man shoved in his pocket, and the fox-captain escorted them to  an arch at the side of the village opposite the one by which they had  entered.  Here they found more soldiers guarding the road.    \"Are you afraid of enemies?\" asked Dorothy.    \"No; because we are watchful and able to protect ourselves,\" answered  the captain.  \"But this road leads to another village peopled by big,  stupid beasts who might cause us trouble if they thought we were afraid  of them.\"    \"What beasts are they?\" asked the shaggy man.    The captain hesitated to answer.  Finally, he said:    \"You will learn all about them when you arrive at their city.  But do  not be afraid of them.  Button-Bright is so wonderfully clever and has  now such an intelligent face that I'm sure he will manage to find a way  to protect you.\"    This made Dorothy and the shaggy man rather uneasy, for they had not so  much confidence in the fox-boy's wisdom as the captain seemed to have.  But as their escort would say no more about the beasts, they bade him  good-bye and proceeded on their journey.          5.  The Rainbow's Daughter      Toto, now allowed to run about as he pleased, was glad to be free again  and able to bark at the birds and chase the butterflies.  The country  around them was charming, yet in the pretty fields of wild-flowers and  groves of leafy trees were no houses whatever, or sign of any  inhabitants.  Birds flew through the air and cunning white rabbits  darted amongst the tall grasses and green bushes; Dorothy noticed even  the ants toiling busily along the roadway, bearing gigantic loads of  clover seed; but of people there were none at all.    They walked briskly on for an hour or two, for even little  Button-Bright was a good walker and did not tire easily.  At length as  they turned a curve in the road they beheld just before them a curious  sight.    A little girl, radiant and beautiful, shapely as a fairy and  exquisitely dressed, was dancing gracefully in the middle of the lonely  road, whirling slowly this way and that, her dainty feet twinkling in  sprightly fashion.  She was clad in flowing, fluffy robes of soft  material that reminded Dorothy of woven cobwebs, only it was colored in  soft tintings of violet, rose, topaz, olive, azure, and white, mingled  together most harmoniously in stripes which melted one into the other  with soft blendings.  Her hair was like spun gold and flowed around her  in a cloud, no strand being fastened or confined by either pin or  ornament or ribbon.    Filled with wonder and admiration our friends approached and stood  watching this fascinating dance.  The girl was no taller than Dorothy,  although more slender; nor did she seem any older than our little  heroine.    Suddenly she paused and abandoned the dance, as if for the first time  observing the presence of strangers.  As she faced them, shy as a  frightened fawn, poised upon one foot as if to fly the next instant,  Dorothy was astonished to see tears flowing from her violet eyes and  trickling down her lovely rose-hued cheeks.  That the dainty maiden  should dance and weep at the same time was indeed surprising; so  Dorothy asked in a soft, sympathetic voice:    \"Are you unhappy, little girl?\"    \"Very!\" was the reply; \"I am lost.\"    \"Why, so are we,\" said Dorothy, smiling; \"but we don't cry about it.\"    \"Don't you?  Why not?\"    \"'Cause I've been lost before, and always got found again,\" answered  Dorothy simply.    \"But I've never been lost before,\" murmured the dainty maiden, \"and I'm  worried and afraid.\"    \"You were dancing,\" remarked Dorothy, in a puzzled tone of voice.    \"Oh, that was just to keep warm,\" explained the maiden, quickly.  \"It  was not because I felt happy or gay, I assure you.\"    Dorothy looked at her closely.  Her gauzy flowing robes might not be  very warm, yet the weather wasn't at all chilly, but rather"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/486"],[0,"Ozma of Oz (#5)"],[1,"but Live.      |    |        Manufactured only at our Works at Evna, Land of Ev.      |    | All infringements will be promptly Prosecuted according to Law. |    |                                                                 |    +-----------------------------------------------------------------+      \"How queer!\" said the yellow hen.  \"Do you think that is all true, my  dear?\"    \"I don't know,\" answered Dorothy, who had more to read.  \"Listen to  this, Billina:\"      +--------------------------------------------------+    |                                                  |    |           DIRECTIONS FOR USING:                  |    | For THINKING:--Wind the Clock-work Man under his |    |       left arm, (marked No. 1.)                  |    | For SPEAKING:--Wind the Clock-work Man under his |    |       right arm, (marked No. 2.)                 |    | For WALKING and ACTION:--Wind Clock-work in the  |    |       middle of his back, (marked No. 3.)        |    | N.

But I  suppose it is all humbug, like so many other patented articles.\"    \"We might wind him up,\" suggested Dorothy, \"and see what he'll do.\"    \"Where is the key to the clock-work?\" asked Billina.    \"Hanging on the peg where I found the card.\"    \"Then,\" said the hen, \"let us try him, and find out if he will go.  He  is warranted for a thousand years, it seems; but we do not know how  long he has been standing inside this rock.\"    Dorothy had already taken the clock key from the peg.    \"Which shall I wind up first?\" she asked, looking again at the  directions on the card.    \"Number One, I should think,\" returned Billina.  \"That makes him think,  doesn't it?\"    \"Yes,\" said Dorothy, and wound up Number One, under the left arm.    \"He doesn't seem any different,\" remarked the hen, critically.    \"Why, of course not; he is only thinking, now,\" said Dorothy.    \"I wonder what he is thinking about.\"    \"I'll wind up his talk, and then perhaps he can tell us,\" said the girl.    So she wound up Number Two, and immediately the clock-work man said,  without moving any part of his body except his lips:    \"Good morn-ing, lit-tle girl.  Good morn-ing, Mrs. Hen.\"    The words sounded a little hoarse and creaky, and they were uttered all  in the same tone, without any change of expression whatever; but both  Dorothy and Billina understood them perfectly.    \"Good morning, sir,\" they answered, politely.    \"Thank you for res-cu-ing me,\" continued the machine, in the same  monotonous voice, which seemed to be worked by a bellows inside of him,  like the little toy lambs and cats the children squeeze so that they  will make a noise.    \"Don't mention it,\" answered Dorothy.  And then, being very curious,  she asked: \"How did you come to be locked up in this place?\"    \"It is a long sto-ry,\" replied the copper man; \"but I will tell it to  you brief-ly.  I was pur-chased from Smith & Tin-ker, my  man-u-fac-tur-ers, by a cru-el King of Ev, named Ev-ol-do, who used to  beat all his serv-ants un-til they died.  How-ev-er, he was not a-ble  to kill me, be-cause I was not a-live, and one must first live in  or-der to die.  So that all his beat-ing did me no harm, and mere-ly  kept my cop-per bod-y well pol-ished.    \"This cru-el king had a love-ly wife and ten beau-ti-ful  chil-dren--five boys and five girls--but in a fit of an-ger he sold  them all to the Nome King, who by means of his mag-ic arts changed them  all in-to oth-er forms and put them in his un-der-ground pal-ace to  or-na-ment the rooms.    \"Af-ter-ward the King of Ev re-gret-ted his wick-ed ac-tion, and tried  to get his wife and chil-dren a-way from the Nome King, but with-out  a-vail.  So, in de-spair, he locked me up in this rock, threw the key  in-to the o-cean, and then jumped in af-ter it and was drowned.\"    \"How very dreadful!\" exclaimed Dorothy.    \"It is, in-deed,\" said the machine.  \"When I found my-self im-pris-oned  I shout-ed for help un-til my voice ran down; and then I walked back  and forth in this lit-tle room un-til my ac-tion ran down; and then I  stood still and thought un-til my thoughts ran down.  Af-ter that I  re-mem-ber noth-ing un-til you wound me up a-gain.\"    \"It's a very wonderful story,\" said Dorothy, \"and proves that the Land  of Ev is really a fairy land, as I thought it was.\"    \"Of course it is,\" answered the copper man.  \"I do not sup-pose such a  per-fect ma-chine as I am could be made in an-y place but a fair-y  land.\"    \"I've never seen one in Kansas,\" said Dorothy.    \"But where did you get the key to un-lock this door?\" asked the  clock-work voice.    \"I found it on the shore, where it was prob'ly washed up by the waves,\"  she answered.  \"And now, sir, if you don't mind, I'll wind up your  action.\"    \"That will please me ve-ry much,\" said the machine.    So she wound up Number Three, and at once the copper man in a somewhat  stiff and jerky fashion walked out of the rocky cavern, took off his  copper hat and bowed politely, and then kneeled before Dorothy.  Said  he:    \"From this time forth I am your o-be-di-ent ser-vant.  What-ev-er you  com-mand, that I will do will-ing-ly--if you keep me wound up.\"    \"What is your name?\" she asked.    \"Tik-tok,\" he replied.  \"My for-mer mas-ter gave me that name be-cause  my clock-work al-ways ticks when it is wound up.\"    \"I can hear it now,\" said the yellow hen.    \"So can I,\" said Dorothy.  And then she added, with some anxiety: \"You  don't strike, do you?\"    \"No,\" answered Tiktok; \"and there is no a-larm con-nec-ted with my  ma-chin-er-y.  I can tell the time, though, by speak-ing, and as I  nev-er sleep I can wak-en you at an-y hour you wish to get up in the  morn-ing.\"    \"That's nice,\" said the little girl; \"only I never wish to get up in  the morning.\"    \"You can sleep until I lay my egg,\" said the yellow hen.  \"Then, when I  cackle, Tiktok will know it is time to waken you.\"    \"Do you lay your egg very early?\" asked Dorothy.    \"About eight o'clock,\" said Billina.  \"And everybody ought to be up by  that time, I'm sure.\"          5.  Dorothy Opens the Dinner Pail      \"Now Tiktok,\" said Dorothy, \"the first thing to be done is to find a  way for us to escape from these rocks.  The Wheelers are down below,  you know, and threaten to kill us.\"    \"There is no rea-son to be a-fraid of the Wheel-ers,\" said Tiktok, the  words coming more slowly than before.    \"Why not?\" she asked.    \"Be-cause they are ag-g-g--gr-gr-r-r-\"    He gave a sort of gurgle and stopped short, waving his hands  frantically until suddenly he became motionless, with one arm in the  air and the other held stiffly before him with all the copper fingers  of the hand spread out like a fan.    \"Dear me!\" said Dorothy, in a frightened tone.  \"What can the matter  be?\"    \"He's run down, I suppose,\" said the hen, calmly.  \"You couldn't have  wound him up very tight.\"    \"I didn't know how much to wind him,\" replied the girl; \"but I'll try  to do better next time.\"    She ran around the copper man to take the key from the peg at the back  of his neck, but it was not there.    \"It's gone!\" cried Dorothy, in dismay.    \"What's gone?\" asked Billina.    \"The key.\"    \"It probably fell off when he made that low bow to you,\" returned the  hen.  \"Look around, and see if you cannot find it again.\"    Dorothy looked, and the hen helped her, and by and by the girl  discovered the clock-key, which had fallen into a crack of the rock.    At once she wound up Tiktok's voice, taking care to give the key as  many turns as it would go around.  She found this quite a task, as you  may imagine if you have ever tried to wind a clock, but the machine  man's first words were to assure Dorothy that he would now run for at  least twenty-four hours.    \"You did not wind me much, at first,\" he calmly said, \"and I told you  that long sto-ry a-bout King Ev-ol-do; so it is no won-der that I ran  down.\"    She next rewound the action clock-work, and then Billina advised her to  carry the key to Tiktok in her pocket, so it would not get lost again.    \"And now,\" said Dorothy, when all this was accomplished, \"tell me what  you were going to say about the Wheelers.\"    \"Why, they are noth-ing to be fright-en'd at,\" said the machine.  \"They  try to make folks be-lieve that they are ver-y ter-ri-ble, but as a  mat-ter of fact the Wheel-ers are harm-less e-nough to an-y one that  dares to fight them.  They might try to hurt a lit-tle girl like you,  per-haps, be-cause they are ver-y mis-chiev-ous.  But if I had a club  they would run a-way as soon as they saw me.\"    \"Haven't you a club?\" asked Dorothy.    \"No,\" said Tiktok.    \"And you won't find such a thing among these rocks, either,\" declared  the yellow hen.    \"Then what shall we do?\" asked the girl.    \"Wind up my think-works tight-ly, and I will try to think of some  oth-er plan,\" said Tiktok.    So Dorothy rewound his thought machinery, and while he was thinking she  decided to eat her dinner.  Billina was already pecking away at the  cracks in the rocks, to find something to eat, so Dorothy sat down and  opened her tin dinner-pail.    In the cover she found a small tank that was full of very nice  lemonade.  It was covered by a cup, which might also, when removed, be  used to drink the lemonade from.  Within the pail were three slices of  turkey, two slices of cold tongue, some lobster salad, four slices of  bread and butter, a small custard pie, an orange and nine large  strawberries, and some nuts and raisins.  Singularly enough, the nuts  in this dinner-pail grew already cracked, so that Dorothy had no  trouble in picking out their meats to eat.    She"]]]
