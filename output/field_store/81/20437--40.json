At  night we slept near streams and awakened soaked with dew. After  several hours of sunshine we would dry out. We quickly learned of some  new inconveniences: ants, spiders, tics, mosquitoes, and sunburn. We  were invited to sleep in native huts, but the smoke from their open  fires was so strong-burning our eyes-that we had to move outside.    In three days we had reached a small village in the valley, Aritao.  Overhead a Japanese plane was observing our activities. We decided to  push on to Balete Pass, where we located a quaint hotel nestled in the  mountains. Here we could get food and lodging. Up to this time we had  been paying for any services received, but now with the money running  low, we realized we'd have to exist on the mercy of the natives.    In the hotel we met the American owner of the Red Line Bus Co. of  Tuguegarao, who was taking his Filipino family to Manila in a big open  truck filled with his belongings. He had room for ten soldiers.    Dec. 29, 1941: Early in the morning, our group, sitting amid the  baggage in the back of the Red Line truck, was cruising down the  highway toward San Jose. A car with a Jap flag on top passed us going  north.    Shortly, the Jap car was back minus the Japanese flag on top. It came  to a screeching halt as our truck had the road blocked. For a few  seconds the Japs and our medics just stared at each other probably  expecting gunfire. Nothing happened! My unarmed medics had the Japs  surrounded! I had my .45 pistol, but knew if I reached for it, we'd  all be mowed down. Stepping forward, I motioned the Jap car into the  ditch and around the truck. They accepted the escape route; in a big  hurry, they were roaring down the road.    We thanked the Red Line Bus family for the lift and instructed them,  \"Turn around and get back up in the mountains. Best of luck!\"    My medics and I climbed down a steep bank to the east, crossed over a  wide, rocky, river bottom keeping our ten paces between men-and  entered a thick jungle. Within ten minutes, several Japanese tanks  rumbled to a stop on the road, where our truck had been parked, turned  their machine guns toward the jungles and sprayed the area. Bellies to  the earth, we waited and prayed as the bullets slashed through the  forests. We continued to hug the ground for several hours until we  were sure the Japs had departed.    We moved deeper into the dense jungle, up an old trail. Suddenly, we  could hear crackling footsteps all around us we were surrounded! We  froze! I reached for my .45, hoping to get one of them before they got  us. Thirty pairs of eyes were focused on us. Large monkeys! As  startled as we were, they scampered off, chattering to themselves. I  examined my .45; the clip was gone; there was just one bullet left-the  one in the chamber. I would save that for myself if things got really  bad.    We continued on up the trail to the top of a mountain, where we could  get a good view of the central plain below. San Jose was in flames.  Across the valley, Clark Field was burning fiercely; two large columns  of dense black smoke from oil fires. There were also fires at  Cabanatuan, Manila and Cavite.    General Wainwright's withdrawing North Luzon Forces had blown many  bridges on their way south to Bataan. It was very evident that the  enemy occupied most of the central plain-and was apparently harassing  the natives. Many of the Filipino homes were in flames.    Toward evening, we sent a disguised medic back down the trail to find  a Filipino home and make some arrangements to get    food for the remnants of our detachment-five. We never saw the other  medics again.    We could hear the big guns booming on Bataan and Corregidor, 125 miles  to the south. We located a hunter's lean-to and camped there for  several days. We grew accustomed to the many strange noises in the  jungles: birds, monkeys and many other animals, but were having  trouble with the ants, spiders and mosquitoes. Camping in the tropics  was quite different from camping in the States. In the Philippines  every square inch of soil has its menagerie of insects. One of the  things I feared the most was being eaten to death if I should be  unlucky enough to be wounded.    Each night I thanked God for sparing my life. Our American medic, Al  Roholt, carried a pocket New Testament. Within several days each of us  had read through it.    We quickly learned that we couldn't eke out an existence in the  jungle. There was too much competition. The birds and animals were  extremely mobile and agile, getting to any available food much quicker  than we could.    The Japanese cavalry and infantry were making daily trips up and down  the highway. They entered houses along the road and slapped the  Filipinos, demanding, \"Where are the Americans?\" The natives remained  loyal and gave them no information.    Peeking through the bushes at the Jap units going by, I began to  wonder why and how studying medicine had gotten me into such a mess.    We had plenty of time to just sit and reflect: We knew the Japanese  had designs on U.S., British, French, and Dutch possessions in  Southeast Asia. We knew the War Plan Rainbow 5-assumed the Philippines  were defensible. We knew the Philippines were not scheduled for any  reinforcements, and that its early loss was expected both in the U.S.  and in Japan.    It had become quite obvious that the Japs had made landings wherever  they chose, and were proceeding to Bataan with very little resistance.  We knew that Gen. MacArthur had from 12,000 to 15,000 American troops  and about the same number of well-trained Philippine Scouts (P.S.),  but the remaining 100,000 Philippine Army (P.A.) troops had less than  three months training, and their weapons were for the most part  obsolete (World War I vintage).    We had lost much of our aggressive power before the U.S. (Congress)  declared war on Japan. We hoped that most of our    troops could get through to Bataan. We could hear the big guns  rumbling on Bataan; we hoped they were ours, not the Japanese.    The Japanese cavalry continued to move up and down the highway every  day-keeping it open for their purposes. Each squadron of cavalry had  several Filipina girls following along on horseback. Natives told us,  \"Those young girls were seized from their homes along the highway by  the Japanese.\" Then the Filipino families moved their homes back into  the jungles from evacuation camps.    The Red Line Bus family sent a guide down from the mountains to lead  us to their camp. As soon as it became dark, the five of us started to  work our way north, up the rocky river bottom, I in my shoes wrapped  in gunny sacks, the soles being completely worn out.    In several hours we were in their evacuation camp. They seemed happy  to see us and we were delighted to see them. They lived in a large,  open shed in a camp containing one-hundred Filipino families. They  were quite well situated beside a small river; they had dug a well in  the river bank for their drinking water. They had their own flock of  chickens. We were lucky-we ate well for a few days. They had a small  radio, capable of getting news from Corregidor and San Francisco. From  it we learned that the Japs occupied Manila.    Gen. Wainwright's troops were pouring into Bataan from the north, and  Gen. Parker's, from the south. They were trying to establish a  defensive line across the base of the peninsula. The Japs were putting  out much propaganda such as \"Asia for Asiatics\" (which really meant  \"Asia for the Japanese\"); and \"The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity  Sphere.\"    We began to hear new terminology from Bataan, such as SNAFU (Situation  Normal, All Fouled Up!). There seemed to have been many snafus. Our  pilots had received many planes from the States prior to the war that  needed Prestone in order to fly. Nowhere in the Philippines could they  find any Prestone. Some pilots had to fly planes that had Swedish  instruments. Four out of five hand grenades were failing to explode.  There was only one rammer rod for fifty-four tanks.    The evacuation camp teniente (town lieutenant) kept me busy every day,  visiting the sick in camp. My medicines were rapidly being consumed.    I finally located an old, smooth tire; I cut the rubber in the    shape of the soles of my boots, and patiently sewed them to the  uppers; my boots were now good for another hundred miles.    The news from Bataan was bleak: \"Front line troops were having  difficulty getting any food. The rations had been cut in half because  of the thousands of refugee Filipinos fleeing to Bataan along with the  troops. Many soldiers were becoming so weak they could hardly hold  their rifles. Hospitals I and II were filled with sick and wounded.    On Jan. 26, 1942 a communique from San Francisco was received on the  radio: \"The first American convoy carrying U.S. troops has finally  arrived safely in Ireland.\" We in the Philippines were being  completely abandoned. However, it seemed that England would now be  able to fight to the \"last American!'\"    Arrangements were being made by the teniente for a group of Filipinos  to go over the mountain to the east of us, to hunt and get food for  the camp. I was asked to go along. We started early the next morning.  At each little village we would come to, the teniente called out in a  loud voice: \"Ahhhhhh-Pooooooo! Ahhhhhh-Poooooo!\" letting the natives  know we were friendly.    By evening we had reached the next valley, where I was informed it was  the place where Pres. Theodore Roosevelt and Governor General Leonard  Wood had hunted many years before.    I remembered that Gen. Wood had visited our high school, Dr. Nicholas  Senn H.S., in Chicago in 1920 and talked to our ROTC "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8452"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 363, December 16, 1882 (#5)"],[1,"in Fig 1, the steam enters through the orifice,  D, along with the water that it carries, gives up the latter at P, and  is completely dried at the exit, R. The partition, g, is so arranged  as to diminish the section of the steam pipe, in order to increase the  effect of the gravity that brings about the separation of the mixture.  The water that falls into the space, P, is exhausted either by means of  a discharge cock (Fig. 1), which gives passage to the liquid only, or  by the aid of an automatic purge-cock (Figs. 2 and 3), the locating of  which varies with the system employed. This arrangement is preferable  to the other, since it permits of expelling the water deposited in the  receptacle, P, without necessitating any attention on the part of the  engine-man.           *       *       *       *       *          H.S. PARMELEE'S PATENT AUTOMATIC SPRINKLER.      The inventor says: \"The automatic sprinkler is a device for  automatically extinguishing fires through the release of water by means  of the heat of the fire, the water escaping in a shower, which is thrown  in all directions to a distance of from six to eight feet. The sprinkler  is a light brass rose, about 11/2 inches diameter and less than two inches  high entire, the distributer being a revolving head fitted loosely to  the body of the fixed portion, which is made to screw into a half inch  tube connection. The revolution of the distributer is effected by the  resistance the water meets in escaping through slots cut at an angle  in the head. The distribution of water has been found to be the most  perfect from this arrangement. Now, this distributing head is covered  over with a brass cap, which is soldered to the base beneath with an  alloy which melts at from 155 to 160 degrees. No water can escape until  the cap is removed. The heat of an insignificant fire is sufficient to  effect this, and we have the practical prevention of any serious damage  or loss through the multiplication of the sprinkler.    [Illustration: PARMELEE'S PATENT AUTOMATIC SPRINKLER. FIG. 1.--Section  of Sprinkler with Cap on.]    The annexed engravings represent the sprinkler at exact size for  one-half inch connection. Fig. 1 shows a section with the cap covering  over the sprinkler, and soldered on to the base. Fig. 2 shows the  sprinkler with the cap off, which, of course, leaves the water free to  run from the holes in fine spray in all directions. Fig. 1 shows the  base hollowed out so as to allow the heat to circulate in between the  pipe and the base of the sprinkler, thus allowing the heat to operate on  the _inside_ as well as on the outside of the sprinkler; thus, in case  of fire, it is very quickly heated through sufficiently to melt the  fusible solder. These sprinklers are all tested at 500 lb., consequently  they can never leak, and cannot possibly be opened, except by heat,  by any one. As the entire sprinkler is covered by a heavy brass cap,  soldered on, it cannot by any means be injured, nor can the openings in  the revolving head ever become filled with dust.    [Illustration: PARMELEE'S PATENT AUTOMATIC SPRINKLER. FIG.2--Sprinkler  with cap off.]    It is so simple as to be easily understood by any one. As soon as the  sprinkler becomes heated to 155 degrees, the cap will become unsoldered,  and will then immediately be blown entirely off by the force of the  water in the pipes and sprinkler. These caps cannot remain on after  the fusible metal melts, if there is the least force of water. A man's  breath is sufficient to blow them off.    The arrangement commences with one or more main supply pipes, either fed  from a city water pipe or from a tank, as the situation will admit.  If desired, the tank need only be of sufficient size to feed a few  sprinklers for a short time, and then dependence must be placed upon  a pump for a further supply of water, if necessary. The tank, however  small, will insure the automatic and prompt working of the sprinklers  and alarm, and by the time the tank shall become empty the pumps can  be got at work. It is most desirable, however, in all cases to have an  abundant water supply without resorting to pumps, if it is possible.    In the main supply pipe or pipes is placed our patent alarm valve,  which, as soon as there is any motion of the water in the pipe, opens,  and moves a lever, which, by connecting with a steam whistle valve by  means of a wire, will blow the whistle and will continue to do so until  either the steam or the water is stopped. Tins constitutes the alarm,  and is positive in its motion. No water can possibly flow from the line  of pipes without opening this valve and blowing the whistle. We also put  in an automatic alarm bell when desired.    From the main pipe other pipes are run, generally lengthways of the  building, ten feet from each side and twenty feet apart. At every ten  feet on these pipes we place five feet of three-quarter inch pipe,  reaching each side, at the end of which is placed the sprinkler in an  elbow pointing toward the ceiling. This arrangement is as we place them  in all cotton and woolen mills, but may be varied to suit different  styles of buildings.    The sprinkler is made of brass, and has a revolving head, with four  slots, from which the water flies in a very fine and dense spray on  everything, and filling the air very completely for a radius of seven or  eight feet all around; thus rendering the existence of any fire in that  space perfectly impossible; and as the sprinklers are only placed ten  feet apart, and a fire cannot start at a greater distance than from five  to six feet from one or more of them, it is assured that all parts of a  building are fully protected.    Over each one of these sprinklers is placed a brass cap, which fits  closely over and passes below the base, where it is soldered on with a  fusible metal that melts as soon as it is heated to 155 degrees.    As soon as a fire starts in any part of a building, heat will be  generated and immediately rise toward the ceiling, and the sprinkler  nearest the fire will become heated in a very few moments to the  required 155 degrees, when the cap will become loosened and will be  forced off by the power of the water. The water will then be spread in  fine spray on the ceiling over the fire, also directly on the fire and  all around for a diameter of from fourteen to eighteen feet. This spray  has been fully tried, and it is found to be entirely sufficient to  extinguish any fire within its reach which can be made of any ordinary  materials.    As soon as the cap on any sprinkler becomes loosened by the heat of a  fire and is forced off, a current of water is produced in the main pipe  where the alarm valve is placed, and as the passage through it is dosed,  the water cannot pass without opening the valve and thus moving the  lever to which the steam whistle valve is attached; by this motion the  whistle valve is opened, and the whistle will blow until it is stopped  by some one.\"           *       *       *       *       *          INSTRUMENT FOR DRAWING CONVERGING STRAIGHT LINES.    [Footnote: Paper by Prof. Fr. Smigaglia, read at the reunion of the  Engineers and Architects of Rome.]      1. LET A and B be two fixed points and A C and C B two straight lines  converging at C and moving in their plane so as to always remain based  on this point (Fig. 1). The geometrical place of the positions occupied  by C is the circumference of the circle which passes through the three  points A, B, and C. Now let C F be a straight line passing through C. On  prolonging it, it will meet the circumference A C B I at a point I. If  the system of three converging--lines takes a new position A C' F B,  it is evident F' B' prolonged will pass through I, because the angles  [alpha] and [beta] are invariable for any position whatever of the  system.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.]    2. In the particular case in which [alpha] = [beta] (Fig. 2), the point  I is found at the extremity of the diameter, and, consequently, for a  given distance A B, or for a given length C D, such point will be at its  maximum distance from C.    [Illustration: Fig. 2.]    3. This granted, it is easy to construct an instrument suitable for  drawing converging lines which shall prove useful to all those who have  to do with practical perspective. For this purpose it is only necessary  to take three rulers united at C (Fig. 3), to rest the two A C and C B  against two points or needles A and B, and to draw the lines with the  ruler C F, in placing the system (Sec. 1) in all positions possible. The  three rulers may be inclined in any way whatever toward each other, but  (Sec. 2) it is preferable to take the case where [alpha] = [beta].    [Illustration: Fig. 3.]    4. Let us suppose that the instrument passes from the position I to  position III (Fig. 4). Then the ruler C A will come to occupy the  position B A, from the fact that the instrument, continuing to move in  the same direction, will roll around the point B. It is well, then, to  manage so that the system shall have another point of support. For that  reason I prolong C B, take B C' = B C, draw C' I, and describe the  circumference--the geometrical place of the points C'. I take C' D = C'  B and obtain at D the position of the fixed point at which the needle  is inserted. In Fig. 4 are represented different positions of the  instrument; and it may be seen that all the points C C', and the centers  O O', are found upon the circumferences that have their center at I.    [Illustration: Fig. 4.]    5. The manipulation and use of the instrument are of the simplest  character. Being given any two straight converging lines whatever,  [alpha] [beta] and [gamma] [delta] (Fig. 5), in order to trace all the  others I insert a needle at A and arrange the instrument as seen at S. I  draw A B and A B', and from there carry it to S' in such a way that the  ruler being on [gamma] [delta], one of"]]]
