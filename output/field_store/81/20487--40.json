To serve with a pudding of  this kind, a cream or a hard sauce should be made.    BLUEBERRY PUDDING  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    Baking-powder-biscuit dough  1 qt.  blueberries  1/2 c. sugar    Make a rather thin baking-powder-biscuit mixture. Spread a layer of this  in the bottom of a square pan and cover it with a layer of the  blueberries. Pour 1/4 cupful of the sugar over the berries and then  cover with another layer of the dough. Over this, pour the remainder of  the berries and sprinkle the rest of the sugar over all. Place in the  oven and bake for about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven, cut into  squares, and serve with cream or hard sauce.      CRANBERRIES    36. CRANBERRIES grow wild in many localities, but most persons who use  them buy them in the market as a cultivated fruit. Their season begins  in the fall and lasts until early spring, and during this time they can  usually be obtained in the market. They contain considerable acid and  consequently require a great deal of sugar to make them sufficiently  sweet to be palatable. They are more often served as an accompaniment to  a dinner course, especially with turkey or other poultry, than eaten as  a sauce. At times they are used in the making of muffins, pudding, and  various kinds of pastry.    One of the advantages of cranberries is that they keep very well in the  raw state. However, before they are cooked, they should be looked over  carefully, freed of any stems, foreign material, and spoiled berries,  and then washed thoroughly in cold water.    37. CRANBERRY SAUCE.--One can hardly imagine a turkey dinner without  cranberry sauce as one of the accompaniments; but it may be served when  meats other than turkey are used. In fact, because of its tart flavor,  it forms a most appetizing addition to any meal.    CRANBERRY SAUCE  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1-1/2 c. water  2 c. sugar  4 c. cranberries    Add the water to the cranberries and place over the fire to cook in a  closely covered kettle. As soon as the skins of the berries have  cracked, add the sugar. Cook slowly for a few minutes or until the sugar  is completely dissolved. Remove from the fire and cool before serving.    38. CRANBERRY JELLY.--If the cranberries are preferred without the  skins, cranberry jelly should be tried. When cool, this solidifies and  may be served in attractive ways.    CRANBERRY JELLY  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    2 c. water  1 qt. cranberries  2 c. sugar    Pour the water over the cranberries and cook them for 10 or 15 minutes.  Then mash them through a sieve or a colander with a wooden potato  masher. Add the sugar to the mashed cranberries. Return to the heat and  cook for 5 to 8 minutes longer. Turn into a mold and cool.      RASPBERRIES    39. RASPBERRIES come in two general varieties, which are commonly known  as _red_ and _black_. There are many species of each kind, and all of  them are much favored, as they are delicious fruit. As a raw fruit,  raspberries have their most satisfactory use, but they may be made into  several excellent desserts and they are also much used for canning and  preserving. They are a perishable fruit and so do not keep well. Because  of their softness, they have to be washed very carefully to prevent  them from breaking or becoming mushy.    40. RED-RASPBERRY WHIP.--No more dainty dessert can be made than  raspberry whip, which is explained in the accompanying recipe. Cake that  is not very rich, such as ladyfingers or sponge cake, makes a very good  accompaniment for this dessert.    RED-RASPBERRY WHIP  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1 qt. raspberries  1 c. powdered sugar  2 egg whites    Put the raspberries, sugar, and egg whites into a bowl. Mash the berries  before starting to whip. Beat the mixture with an egg whip until it is  reduced to a pulpy mass and is stiff and fluffy. Pile lightly into a  bowl, chill, and serve with ladyfingers or sponge cake.    41. RASPBERRY SHORTCAKE.--Either black or red raspberries make a  delicious shortcake when combined with a cake or a biscuit mixture.  Directions for making such a shortcake are given in the  accompanying recipe.    RASPBERRY SHORTCAKE  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1 qt. raspberries  1 c. sugar  Biscuit or plain-cake dough    Mash or chop the berries, as preferred, and add the sugar to them. Bake  the biscuit or plain-cake dough in a single, thick layer, and when it  has been removed from the pan split it into halves with a sharp knife.  Spread half the berries between the two pieces of biscuit or cake and  the remaining half on top. Cut into pieces of the desired size and serve  with plain or whipped cream.      STRAWBERRIES    42. STRAWBERRIES are perhaps more popular than any other kind of berry.  They are reddish in color, have a somewhat acid flavor, and range in  size from 1/2 inch to 2 inches in diameter. Strawberries are much used  for jams and preserves; they may also be used for making a delicious  jelly, but as they lack pectin this ingredient must be supplied. These  berries are eaten fresh to a great extent, but are also much used for  pastry making and for various kinds of dessert; in fact, there is  practically no limit to the number of recipes that may be given for  strawberries. Before they are used in any way, they should be washed  thoroughly in cold water and then their hulls should be removed.    [Illustration: FIG. 1]    43. STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE.--For strawberry shortcake, either a biscuit or  a plain-cake mixture may be used, some persons preferring the one and  other persons the other. This may be made in a large cake, as shown in  Fig. 1, and then cut into pieces, or it may be made into individual  cakes, as Fig. 2 shows. Whichever plan is followed, the cakes are split  in the same way and the crushed berries inserted between the halves.  This dish may be made more attractive in appearance if a few of the  finest berries are saved and used as a garniture.    STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1 qt. strawberries  1 c. sugar  Biscuit or plain cake dough    Mash or chop the berries, add the sugar to them, and let them stand  until the sugar has dissolved. Bake the biscuit or plain-cake dough in a  single thick layer or, if desired, bake it in individual cakes, cutting  the biscuit dough with a cookie cutter and putting the cake mixture in  muffin pans. Remove from the pan, cut in two with a sharp knife, and  spread half of the berries over the lower piece. Set the upper piece on  the berries. In the case of the large cake, sprinkle powdered sugar over  the top and then on this arrange a number of the largest and finest of  the berries, as Fig. 1 shows, as a garniture. Cut in pieces of the  desired size and serve with or without either plain or whipped cream. In  preparing the individual cakes, spread a spoonful or two of the crushed  berries over the top, as Fig. 2 shows, and serve with whipped cream.    44. STRAWBERRY WHIP.--Strawberries may be used instead of raspberries in  the recipe for red-raspberry whip. When prepared in this way and served  with fresh cake, strawberries make a very appetizing dessert.    45. OTHER STRAWBERRY DESSERTS.--If it is desired to serve strawberries  just with sugar, they can be made attractive with very little effort.  Garnish a plate with some of the strawberry leaves and on them place a  few fine large strawberries that have been washed but have not had the  hulls removed. Serve a small dish of powdered sugar with the  strawberries, so that they may be dipped into the sugar and eaten by  holding the hull of the berry in the fingers. Strawberries crushed with  sugar and served with blanc mange or custard also make a very  delicious dessert.    [Illustration: FIG. 2]      MISCELLANEOUS BERRIES    46. CURRANTS come in three varieties--red, white, and black. They are  not often eaten fresh, but are generally utilized for making jellies,  jams, and preserves, or for pastry and pies. When they are to be used  for jelly, it is not necessary to pick them from the stems, as they may  be washed and cooked on their stems. Some varieties of currants are  dried and these are used extensively in the making of cakes, cookies,  etc. The usefulness of this fruit as a food is not so great as many  others. No recipes are given for it because of its little use in the  fresh form.    47. GOOSEBERRIES, like currants, are somewhat limited in their variety  of uses, being seldom used except for jelly, preserves, and pies. Before  gooseberries are ripe they are light green in color and rather sour in  taste, but as they ripen the amount of acid they contain decreases, so  that they become sweet in flavor and change to brownish-purple. Green  gooseberries are often canned for pies, and when in this state or when  partly ripe they are also made up into many kinds of preserves and  jelly. In their preparation for these uses, both the stems and the  blossom ends should be removed. As a rule, berries of this kind keep  very well and stand considerable handling because their outside skin is  very tough.    48. LOGANBERRIES are a fruit produced by crossing a variety of red  raspberries with a species of blackberry. They are not very common, but  are an excellent berry and are well liked by those who can obtain them.  They may be used for any purpose for which either raspberries or  blackberries are used. Therefore, in the recipes given for these two  kinds of berries, loganberries may be substituted whenever they can  be obtained.           *       *       *       *       *      NON-TROPICAL FRUITS    NATURE AND USE    49. Besides the berries that have just been described, there are a large  number of fruits that are grown in temperate climates and are therefore  regarded as NON-TROPICAL FRUITS. Extensive use is made of these fruits  in the regions in which they are grown or in places that are within easy  shipping distances of the source of supply. All of them have a  protective covering, or skin,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9943"],[0,"Journal of an Expedition into the Interior of Tropical Australia, in Search of a (#5)"],[1,"and the white man, was by no means favourable, and I  could easily conceive how I, had I been an aboriginal native, should have  felt and regretted that change. The springs which issue from the level  plains of clay, while the bed of the water-course some twenty feet lower  continues dry and dusty, are numerous. One had a strong taste of sulphur,  and might probably be as salubrious as other springs more celebrated.  They show that, in this country at least, the water-courses are not  supplied by springs, but depend wholly on heavy torrents of rain  descending from the mountains. Some holes in the bed of the Goobang Creek  did however retain some water which had fallen during the last rain. The  thermometer stood at 107 deg. in the tent.    21ST DECEMBER.--Guided by my old friend Bultje, we pursued a straight  line of route through the forest to Currandong, which was half way to the  Bogan. We passed over a very open, gently undulating country, just  heading a gully called Brotherba--showing how well our guide knew the  country--and we reached Currandong at 2 o'clock. Here also were two  flocks belonging to Dr. Ramsay; Balderudgery, the head station, being  fifteen miles distant, by a mountain road through a gap. While travelling  this day, Corporal Graham overtook me with letters from Buree, and a cart  had also been sent after us by Mr. Barton with a small supply of corn.  That country is considered excellent as a fattening run for sheep; the  shepherd told me they there find a salt plant, which keeps them in  excellent condition and heart for feeding. The scarcity of water at some  seasons occasions a conversion here of cattle runs into sheep runs, and  VICE VERSA, a contingency which seems to render these lands of Hervey's  range of temporary and uncertain value.    22D DECEMBER.--Guided by Bultje we continued to follow down the little  chain of ponds which, as he said, led to the Bogan. The road was good--  the Currandong ponds running in a general direction about N. N. W. It was  the first of the sources of the Bogan we had reached. Crossing at length  to its left bank, near an old lambing station of Dr. Ramsay's, we further  on came to a large plain with the Yarra trees of the Bogan upon its  western skirts. Some large lagoons on the eastern side of the plains had  been filled by the late rains, and cattle lay beside them. We at length  arrived in sight of a cattle station of Mr. Templar's, called Gananaguy,  and encamped on the margin of a plain opposite to it. The cattle here  looked very fat, and although the herd comprised about 2000 head, there  was abundance of grass. The Bogan thus first appeared on our left hand,  and must have its sources in the comparatively low hills, about the  country crossed by my former line of route, rather than in Hervey's or  Croker's ranges, as formerly supposed. The water in the ponds of the  Bogan seemed low.    This fine grazing country had been abandoned more than once from the  failure of the water, and yet these ponds seemed capable of holding an  almost inexhaustible supply. A single dam would have retained the water  for miles, the Bogan always flowing through clay in a bed of uniform  width and depth like a canal. No doubt a little art and labour would be  sufficient to render the land permanently habitable: but on an uncertain  tenure this remedy was not likely to be applied, and therefore the  sovereignty of art's dominion remained unasserted there. The incursions  of the savage, who is learning to \"bide his time\" on the Darling, are  greatly encouraged by the hardships of the colonists when water is  scarce; and I was shown where no less than 800 head of fat bullocks had  been run together by them when water was too abundant. Then horses cannot  travel, and cattle stick fast in the soft earth and are thus at the mercy  of the natives. The stone ovens, such as they prepare for cooking  kangaroos, had been used for the consumption of about twenty head of  cattle a day, by the wild tribes who had assembled from the Darling and  lower Bogan on that occasion. Thermometer in tent 109 deg. at noon, wind  W.N.W.    23D DECEMBER.--We crossed the Bogan (flowing eastward) at Mr. Templar's  station at Gananaguy, and the overseer most hospitably stood by the party  as it passed with a bucket of milk, of which he gave a drink to each of  the men. Bultje put us on the right road to the next nearest water-holes  (Mr. Gilmore's station), and having rendered me the service he promised,  I gave him the tomahawk, pipe, and two figs of tobacco promised him, and  also took a sketch of his singularly Socratic face. This native got a bad  name from various stockmen, as having been implicated in the murder of  Mr. Cunningham. Nothing could be more unfounded; and it must indeed  require in a man so situated the wisdom of a Socrates to maintain his  footing, or indeed his life, between the ignorant stockmen or shepherds  on one hand, and the savage tribes on the other. These latter savages  naturally regard those who are half civilised, in the same light as we  should look on deserters to the enemy, and are extremely hostile to them,  while perhaps even his very usefulness to our party had most unjustly  connected this native's name with the murder of one of our number. His  laconic manner and want of language would not admit of any clear  explanation of how much he had done to serve our race--and the  difficulties he had to encounter with his own; while the circumstance of  his having been met with at an interval of ten years in the same valley  in a domesticated state, if it did not establish any claim to the soil,  at least proved his strong attachment to it, and a settled disposition.  Much tact must be necessary on his part to avoid those savages coming by  stealth to carry off his gins; and to escape the wrath of white men, when  aroused by the aggressions of wild tribes to get up a sort of foray to  save or recover their own. How Bultje has survived through all this,  without having nine lives like a cat, still to gather honey in his own  valley, \"surpasseth me to know.\"    We encamped at two large water-holes of the Bogan near Mr. Gilmore's  station, and the overseer sent to the men two buckets of milk. At the  station a well had been made to the depth of eighty feet, but a flood had  come, and risen so high as to wash in the sides and so fill up the well.  The workmen had passed through yellow clay chiefly, and the clay was wet  and soft when the further sinking was interrupted. Thermometer in my tent  109 deg., wind W. N. W.    24TH DECEMBER. A lurid haze hung among the trees as the earliest sunbeams  shot down amongst them. The party were ready to move off early, but the  progress was slow from various impediments. A hot wind blew like a blast  furnace. A bullock dropt down dead at the yoke. We encamped on the  Currandong, or Back Creek, near a small plain, after travelling about ten  miles. Thermometer in tent, 103. deg. Hot wind from the west.    25TH DECEMBER. Halted to rest the cattle. The wind blew this day more  from the northward, and was cooler. Thermometer in tent, 107 deg..    26TH DECEMBER.--Proceeded to Graddle, a cattle station belonging to Mr.  Coss, 21/2 miles. Thermometer, 109 deg..    27TH DECEMBER.--The bullock-drivers having allowed twenty-two of the  bullocks to stray, it was impossible to proceed.    At early morning the sky was overcast, the weather calm, a slight wind  from the west carried off these clouds, and at about eleven a very hot  wind set in. The thermometer in my tent stood at 117 deg., and when exposed  to the wind rose rapidly to 129 deg., when I feared the thermometer would  break as it only reached to 132 deg..    28TH DECEMBER.--All the cattle having been recovered, we set off early,  accompanied by a stockman from Graddle, Mr. Coss's station. The day was  excessively warm, a hot wind blowing from the west. We finally encamped  on the Bogan, at a very muddy water-hole, after travelling eleven miles.  Thermometer in tent, 115 deg.. At half past five, the sky became overcast,  and the hot wind increased to a violent gust, and suddenly fell. I found  that tartaric acid would precipitate the mud, leaving a jug of the water  tolerably clear, but then the acid remained. Towards evening the sky was  overcast, and a few drops of rain fell. The night was uncommonly hot. At  ten the thermometer stood at 102 deg., and at day-break at 90 deg..    29TH DECEMBER.--The remaining water was so muddy that the cattle would no  longer drink it. The sky was overcast, with the wind from south. Finding  a cart road near our camp, I lost no time in conducting the lighter  portion of our equipment to Mr. Kerr's station at Derribong. In the  hollows I saw, for the first time on this journey, the POLYGONUM JUNCEUM,  reminding me of the river Darling, and on the plains a SOLANUM in flower,  of which I had only seen the apple formerly. At length, greener grass  indicated that the late rains had fallen more heavily there, and at about  twelve miles I reached the station situated on a rather clear and  elevated part of the right bank of the Bogan. Here the stock of water had  been augmented by a small dam, and a channel cut from a hollow part of  the clay surface conducted any rain water into the principal pool, where  the water was very good. We had now arrived at the lowest station on the  Bogan. The line of demarcation between the squatter and the savage had  been once much lower down, at Muda, and even at Nyingan (see INFRA), but  the incursions of the blacks had rendered these lower stations untenable,  without more support than the Colonial government was able to afford.  There, at least, the squatter is not only not the real discoverer of the  country, but not even the occupier of what had been discovered. The map  will illustrate how it happens that the colonists cannot keep their  ground here from the marauding disposition of the savage tribes. [*"]]]
