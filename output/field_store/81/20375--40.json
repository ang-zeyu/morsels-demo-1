Here is the Porta Decumana, opposite the Prcetoria, together with the  dextra and sinistra gates,\" all discovered by Sandy Gordon. \"Moreover,  the situation of the ground is so very exact with the description  given by Tacitus, that in all my travels through Britain I never beheld  anything with more pleasure. . . . Nor is it difficult, in viewing this  ground, to say where the Covinarii, or Charioteers, stood. In fine, to  an Antiquary, this is a ravishing scene.\" He adds the argument \"that  Galgacus's name still remains on this ground, for the moor on which the  camp stood is called to this day Galdachan, or Galgachan Rosmoor.\"  All this lore Gordon illustrates by an immense chart of a camp, and a  picture of very small Montes Grampii, about the size and shape of buns.  The plate is dedicated to his excellency General Wade.    In another point Monkbapns borrows from Gordon. Sandy has a plate (page  20) of \"The Roman Sacellum of Mars Signifer, vulgarly called 'Arthur's  Oon.' With regard to its shape, it is not unlike the famous Pantheon at  Rome before the noble Portico was added to it by Marcus Agrippa.\" Gordon  agrees with Stukeley in attributing Arthur's Oon to Agricola, and  here Monkbarns and Lovel adopt almost his words. \"Time has left Julius  Agricola's very name on the place; . . . and if ever those initial  letters J. A. M. P. M. P. T., mentioned by Sir Robert Sibbald, were  engraven on a stone in this building, it may not be reckoned altogether  absurd that they should bear this reading, JULIUS AGRICOLA MAGNUS  PIETATIS MONUMENTUM POSUIT TEMPLUM; but this my reader may either accept  or reject as he pleases. However, I think it may be as probably received  as that inscription on Caligula's Pharos in Holland, which having these  following letters, C. C. P. F., is read Caius Caligula Pharum Fecit.\"  \"This,\" Monkbarns adds, \"has ever been recorded as a sound exposition.\"    The character of Edie Ochiltree, Scott himself avers to have been  suggested by Andrew Gemmells, pleasantly described in the Introduction.  Mr. Chambers, in \"Illustrations of the Author of 'Waverley,\" clears up  a point doubtful in Scott's memory, by saying that Geimells really was a  Blue-Gown. He rode a horse of his own, and at races was a bookmaker.  He once dropped at Rutherford, in Teviotdale, a clue of yarn containing  twenty guineas. Like Edie Ochiltree, he had served at Fontenoy. He  died at Roxburgh Newton in 1793, at the age of one hundred and five,  according to his own reckoning. \"His wealth was the means of enriching  a nephew in Ayrshire, who is now (1825) a considerable landholder there,  and belongs to a respectable class of society.\"    An old Irus of similar character patrolled Teviotdale, while Andrew  Gemmells was attached to Ettrick and Yarrow. This was Blind Willie Craw.  Willie was the Society Journal of Hawick, and levied blackmail on the  inhabitants. He is thus described by Mr. Grieve, in the Diary already  quoted: \"He lived at Branxholme Town, in a free house set apart for the  gamekeeper, and for many a year carried all the bread from Hawick used  in my father's family. He came in that way at breakfast-time, and got a  wallet which he put it in, and returned at dinner-time with the 'bawbee  rows' and two loaves. He laid the town of Hawick under contribution for  bawbees, and he knew the history of every individual, and went rhyming  through the town from door to door; and as he knew something against  every one which they would rather wish should not be rehearsed, a bawbee  put a stop to the paragraph which they wished suppressed. Willie Craw  was the son of a gamekeeper of the duke's, and enjoyed a free house at  Branxholme Town as long as he lived.\"    Had Burns ever betaken himself to the gaberlunzie's life, which he  speaks of in one of his poems as \"the last o't, the worst o't,\" he would  have proved a much more formidable satirist than poor Willie Craw, the  last of the \"blind crowders.\" Burns wrote, of course, in a spirit of  reckless humour; but he could not, even in sport, have alluded to the  life as \"suited to his habits and powers,\" had gaberlunzies been mere  mendicants. In Herd's collection of Ballads is one on the ancient  Scottish beggar:--                    In Scotland there lived a humble beggar,                    He had nor house, nor hald, nor hame;                    But he was well liked by ilk a body,                  And they gave him sunkets to rax his wame.                    A sieve fu' o' meal, a handfu' o' groats,                    A dad o' a bannock, or pudding bree,                    Cauld porridge, or the lickings o' plates,                  Wad make him as blythe as a body could be.    The dress and trade of the beggar are said to have been adopted by  James V. in his adventures, and tradition attributes to him a song, \"The  Gaberlunzie Man.\"    One of Edie's most charming traits is his readiness to \"fight for his  dish, like the laird for his land,\" when a French invasion was expected.  Scott places the date of \"The False Alarm,\" when he himself rode a  hundred miles to join his regiment, on Feb. 2, 1804.    Lockhart gives it as an event of 1805 (vol. ii. p. 275). The occasion  gave great pleasure to Scott, on account of the patriotism and courage  displayed by all classes. \"Me no muckle to fight for?\" says Edie. \"Isna  there the country to fight for, and the burns I gang dandering beside,  and the hearths o' the gudewives that gie me my bit bread, and the bits  o' weans that come toddling to play wi' me when I come about a landward  town?\" Edie had fought at Fontenoy, and was of the old school. Scott  would have been less pleased with a recruit from St. Boswells, on the  Tweed. This man was a shoemaker, John Younger, a very intelligent and  worthy person, famous as an angler and writer on angling, who has left  an account of the \"False Alarm\" in his memoirs. His view was that the  people, unlike Edie, had nothing to fight for, that only the rich had  any reason to be patriotic, that the French had no quarrel with the  poor. In fact, Mr. Younger was a cosmopolitan democrat, and sneered at  the old Border glories of the warlike days. Probably, however, he would  have done his duty, had the enemy landed, and, like Edie, might have  remembered the \"burns he dandered beside,\" always with a fishingrod in  his hand.         The Editor cannot resist the temptation to add that the patriotic       lady mentioned in Scott's note, who \"would rather have seen her son       dead on that hearth than hear that he had been a horse's length       behind his companions,\" was his paternal great-grandmother, Mrs.       John Lang. Her husband, who died shortly afterwards, so that she was       a widow when Scott conversed with her, chanced to be chief       magistrate of Selkirk. His family was aroused late one night by the       sound of a carriage hurrying down the steep and narrow street. Lord       Napier was bringing, probably from Hawick, the tidings that the       beacons were ablaze. The town-bell was instantly rung, the       inhabitants met in the marketplace, where Scott's statue now stands,       and the whole force, with one solitary exception, armed and marched       to Dalkeith. According to the gentleman whose horse and arms were       sent on to meet him, it was intended, if the French proved       victorious, that the population of the Border towns should abandon       their homes and retire to the hills.    No characters in the \"Antiquary,\" except Monkbarns and Edie Ochiltree,  seem to have been borrowed from notable originals. The frauds of  Dousterswivel, Scott says, are rendered plausible by \"very late  instances of the force of superstitious credulity to a much greater  extent.\" He can hardly be referring to the career of Cagliostro, but  he may have had in his memory some unsuccessful mining speculations by  Charles Earl of Traquair, who sought for lead and found little or none  in Traquair hills. The old \"Statistical Account of Scotland\" (vol. xii.  p. 370) says nothing about imposture, and merely remarks that \"the noble  family of Traquair have made several attempts to discover lead mines,  and have found quantities of the ore of that metal, though not adequate  to indemnify the expenses of working, and have therefore given up the  attempt.\" This was published in 1794, so twenty years had passed  when \"The Antiquary\" was written. If there was here an \"instance  of superstitious credulity,\" it was not \"a very late instance.\" The  divining, or \"dowsing,\" rod of Dousterswivel still keeps its place in  mining superstition and in the search for wells.    With \"The Antiquary\" most contemporary reviews of the novels lose their  interest. Their author had firmly established his position, at least  till \"The Monastery\" caused some murmurings. Even the \"Quarterly Review\"  was infinitely more genial in its reception of \"The Antiquary\" than of  \"Guy Mannering.\" The critic only grumbled at Lovel's feverish dreams,  which, he thought, showed an intention to introduce the marvellous. He  complained of \"the dark dialect of Anglified Erse,\" but found comfort in  the glossary appended. The \"Edinburgh Review\" pronounced the chapter on  the escape from the tide to be \"I the very best description we have ever  met, inverse or in prose, in ancient or in modern writing.\" No reviewer  seems to have noticed that the sun is made to set in the sea, on the  east coast of Scotland. The \"Edinburgh"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7010"],[0,"Graded Lessons in English (#5)"],[1,"expresses being  or state of being.    +DEFINITION.--A _Verb_ is a word that asserts action, being, or state of  being+.    The office of the verb in all its forms, except two (the participle and the  infinitive, see Lessons 48 and 49), is to +_assert_+. This it does whether  the sentence affirms, denies, or asks a question.    +To the Teacher+.--In the exercises of this and the next two Lessons, let  the pupils note the agreement of the verb with its subject. See Notes, pp.  163-165.    Supply, to each of the following _nouns_, as many appropriate _verbs_ as  you can think of.    Let some express _being_ or _state of being_.    Water ----.  Wind ----.  Pens ----.  Parrots ----.  Vines ----.  Farmers ----.  Trees ----.  Ministers ----.    One verb may consist of _two, three_, or _four_ words; as, _is singing,  will be sung, might have been sung_.    Form _verbs_ by combining the words in columns 2 and 3, and add these verbs  to all the _nouns_ in column 1 with which they appropriately combine.      1    |       2          |    3  -------|------------------|------------  Laws   | has been         | published.

The examples you have written are sentences; the _nouns_ are _subjects_,  and the _verbs_ are _predicates_.    As verbs are the only words that assert, _+every predicate+ must be a  +verb+, or must contain a verb_.    Be prepared to _analyze and parse five of the sentences_ that you have  written.    +Model+.--_Laws are obeyed_. Diagram and analyze as in Lesson 11.    +Parsing+.--_Laws_ is a noun, because----; _are obeyed_ is a _verb_,  because it asserts action.          LESSON 17.    Select and write all the verbs in the sentences given in Lessons 28, 31,  34, and tell why they are verbs.          LESSON 18.    SENTENCE-BUILDING.    From the following nouns and verbs, build as many sentences as possible,  taking care that every one makes good sense.    Poems, was conquered, lambs, rebellion, stars, forests, shone, were seen,  were written, treason, patriots, meteors, fought, were discovered, frisk,  Cain, have fallen, fled, stream, have crumbled, day, ages, deer, are  flickering, are bounding, gleamed, voices, lamps, rays, were heard, are  gathering, time, death, friends, is coming, will come.    +To the Teacher+.--Before this recitation closes, let the teacher open up  the subject of Lesson 19. See \"Hints for Oral Instruction.\"          LESSON 19.    PRONOUNS.    +Hints for Oral Instruction+.--We propose to introduce you now to the  _third part of speech_. +T.--+If I should ask who whispered, and some boy  should promptly confess, what would he say? +P.--+_I_ whispered.  +T.--+Would he mention his own name? +P.--+No. +T.--+What word would he use  instead? +P.--+_I_.    +T.--+Suppose that I had _spoken to_ that boy and had accused him of  whispering, how should I have addressed him without mentioning his name?  +P.--+_You_ whispered. +T.--+What word would be used instead of the name of  the boy _to_ whom I spoke? +P.--+_You_.    +T.--+Suppose that, without using his name, I had told you what he did,  what should I have said? +P.--+_He_ whispered. +T.--+What word would have  been used instead of the name of the boy _of_ whom I spoke? +P.--+_He_.    (Repeat these questions and suppose the pupil to be a girl.)    +T.--+If I should tell that boy to close his book, when his book was  already closed, what would he say without mentioning the word book?  +P.--+_It_ is closed.    +T.--+If I should accuse several of you of whispering, and one should speak  for himself and for the others whispering with him, what would he say? _We_  whispered.    +T--+Suppose that a boy should inform me that all of the boys on that seat  had whispered, what would he say? +P.--+_They_ whispered.    _I, you, he, she, it, we_, and _they_ are not names, but they are used  instead of names. We call such words +Pronouns+.    +DEFINITION.--A _Pronoun_ is a word used for a noun+.    +CAPITAL LETTERS--RULE.--The words _I_ and _O_ should be written in capital  letters+.    Analysis and Parsing.    +Model.--+_You will be rewarded_.    +Oral Analysis--+This is a sentence, because----; _you_ is the subject,  because----; _will be rewarded_ is the predicate, because----.    +Parsing.--+_You_ is a _pronoun_, because it stands for the name of the  person spoken to; _will be rewarded_ is a verb, because----.    1. We think.  2. She prattles.  3. We have recited.  4. I study.  5. You have been seen.  6. It has been decided.  7. He was punished.  8. They are conquered.  9. Thou art adored.    Compose nine similar sentences, using a pronoun for the subject of each,  and diagram them.    +To the Teacher.--+Call special attention to the agreement of the verb with  _I_ and _you_. See Notes, p. 164.    Before this recitation closes, explain \"Modified Subject.\" See \"Hints for  Oral Instruction.\"          LESSON 20.    MODIFIED SUBJECT.    +Hints for Oral Instruction.--+The _Subject_ and the _Predicate_ may be  considered as the foundation on which every sentence is built. No sentence  can be constructed without them.    You have already learned that these parts _alone_, sometimes make a  complete structure; but we are about to show you that they are often used  as the foundation of a structure, which is completed by adding _other_  parts.    I hold in my hand several pieces of metal, with letters and other  characters stamped on them. What do you say I have in my hand? +P+.--Money.  +T.--+Yes. What other word can you use? +P.--+_Coin_. +T.--+Yes. I will  write on the board this sentence: _Coin is stamped_.    The subject _coin_ is a general name for all such pieces of metal. I will  write the word _the_ before this sentence. _The coin is stamped_. I have  now made an assertion about one particular coin, so the meaning of the  subject is limited by joining the word _the_.    I can again limit the meaning of the subject by putting the word _a_ before  it. The assertion is now about one coin, but no particular one. I point to  the piece near me and say, _This coin is stamped_. I point to the one  farther from me and say, _That coin is stamped_.    When words are joined to the subject to limit its meaning, we say that the  subject is _modified_.    The words _the, a, this_, and _that_ modify the subject by limiting the  word to one coin, or to one particular coin.    We can modify the subject by joining some word which will tell what _kind_  of coin is meant.    Here is a coin dated 18--. We can say, _The new coin is stamped_. Here the  word _new_ tells what kind of coin is meant. What other words can I use to  modify _coin_? +P.--+_Beautiful, bright, new, round, silver_. +T.--+These  words _beautiful, bright, new, round_, and _silver_ modify the subject by  telling the qualities of the coin.    We call the words _the, beautiful_, etc., +Modifiers+.      +DEFINITION.--A _Modifier_ is a word or group of words joined to some part  of the sentence to qualify or limit the meaning+.    The +_Subject_+ with its +_Modifiers_+ is called the +_Modified Subject_+.    ANALYSIS.    Analyze and diagram the following sentences.    +Model.--+_The genial summer days have come_.           days          |  have come  =====================|=============  \\The \\genial \\summer |    +Explanation of the Diagram.--+The lighter lines, joined to the subject  line, stand for the _modifiers_, the less important parts.    +Oral Analysis.--+This is a sentence, because----; _days_ is the subject,  because----; _have come_ is the predicate, because----; _The, genial_, and  _summer_ are _modifiers_ of the subject, because they are words joined to  the subject to modify its meaning. _The genial summer days_ is the  _modified subject_.    +To the Teacher.--+To excite thought and guard against mere routine, pupils  may, so far as they are able, make the reasons specific. For example,  \"_The_ points out some particular clouds, _dark_ tells their color,\" etc.    Here and elsewhere the teacher must determine how far it is profitable to  follow \"Models.\" There is great danger of wasting time in repeating forms  that require no mental effort.    1. The angry wind is howling.  2. The dead leaves fall.  3. The dark clouds lower.  4. The tall elm bends.  5. All men must die.  6. The lusty bellows roared.  7. A boding silence reigned.  8. Little Arthur was murdered.  9. The mighty oak was uprooted.  10. The fragile violet was crushed.  11. The beautiful marble statue was carved.  12. The turbid torrent roared.  13. The affrighted shepherds fled.  14. The vivid lightning flashes.  15. Those elegant Etruscan vases are broken.    REVIEW QUESTIONS.    What is a verb? Give examples of verbs of action. Of being. Of state of  being. May a verb consist of more than one word? Illustrate. Verbs are the  only words that do what? What must every predicate contain?    What parts of speech are explained in the preceding Lessons? What is a  pronoun? Give the rule for writing the words _I_ and _0_.    What is the foundation on which every sentence is built? May the subject be  modified? What is a modifier? What is the modified subject?          LESSON 21.    SENTENCE-BUILDING.    We have here prepared the foundations of sentences which you are to  complete by writing two or more suitable modifiers to each subject. Be  careful to choose and arrange your material so as to make a neat and  appropriate structure.    +Model+.---------- eminence was reached.        _That lofty_ eminence was reached.    1. ---- speaker was applauded.  2. ---- difficulties were overcome.  3. ---- leaf trembles.  4. ---- accident happened.  5. ---- books should be read.  6. ---- houses are built.  7. ---- soldiers perished.  8. ---- opinions prevailed.  9. ---- leader fell.  10. ---- task is completed.
