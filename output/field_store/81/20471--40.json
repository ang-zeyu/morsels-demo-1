Even the third batch of  cookies, which I brought with me in my basket, were pretty poor stuff  and no better than any woman could make who does not own my  diamond-studded gold dishpan.  In fact, my good Frogman, Cayke the  Cookie Cook will never be able to cook good cookies again until her  magic dishpan is restored to her.\"    \"In that case,\" said the Frogman with a sigh, \"I suppose we must manage  to find it.\"          CHAPTER 5    OZMA'S FRIENDS ARE PERPLEXED      \"Really,\" said Dorothy, looking solemn, \"this is very s'prising.  We  can't even find a shadow of Ozma anywhere in the Em'rald City, and  wherever she's gone, she's taken her Magic Picture with her.\"  She was  standing in the courtyard of the palace with Betsy and Trot, while  Scraps, the Patchwork Girl, danced around the group, her hair flying in  the wind.    \"P'raps,\" said Scraps, still dancing, \"someone has stolen Ozma.\"    \"Oh, they'd never dare do that!\" exclaimed tiny Trot.    \"And stolen the Magic Picture, too, so the thing can't tell where she  is,\" added the Patchwork Girl.    \"That's nonsense,\" said Dorothy.  \"Why, ev'ryone loves Ozma.  There  isn't a person in the Land of Oz who would steal a single thing she  owns.\"    \"Huh!\" replied the Patchwork Girl.  \"You don't know ev'ry person in the  Land of Oz.\"    \"Why don't I?\"    \"It's a big country,\" said Scraps.  \"There are cracks and corners in it  that even Ozma doesn't know of.\"    \"The Patchwork Girl's just daffy,\" declared Betsy.    \"No, she's right about that,\" replied Dorothy thoughtfully.  \"There are  lots of queer people in this fairyland who never come near Ozma or the  Em'rald City.  I've seen some of 'em myself, girls.  But I haven't seen  all, of course, and there MIGHT be some wicked persons left in Oz yet,  though I think the wicked witches have all been destroyed.\"    Just then the Wooden Sawhorse dashed into the courtyard with the Wizard  of Oz on his back.  \"Have you found Ozma?\" cried the Wizard when the  Sawhorse stopped beside them.    \"Not yet,\" said Dorothy.  \"Doesn't Glinda the Good know where she is?\"    \"No.  Glinda's Book of Records and all her magic instruments are gone.  Someone must have stolen them.\"    \"Goodness me!\" exclaimed Dorothy in alarm.  \"This is the biggest steal  I ever heard of.  Who do you think did it, Wizard?\"    \"I've no idea,\" he answered.  \"But I have come to get my own bag of  magic tools and carry them to Glinda.  She is so much more powerful  than I that she may be able to discover the truth by means of my magic  quicker and better than I could myself.\"    \"Hurry, then,\" said Dorothy, \"for we've all gotten terr'bly worried.\"    The Wizard rushed away to his rooms but presently came back with a  long, sad face.  \"It's gone!\" he said.    \"What's gone?\" asked Scraps.    \"My black bag of magic tools. Someone must have stolen it!\"    They looked at one another in amazement.    \"This thing is getting desperate,\" continued the Wizard. \"All the magic  that belongs to Ozma or to Glinda or to me has been stolen.\"    \"Do you suppose Ozma could have taken them, herself, for some purpose?\"  asked Betsy.    \"No indeed,\" declared the Wizard.  \"I suspect some enemy has stolen  Ozma and for fear we would follow and recapture her has taken all our  magic away from us.\"    \"How dreadful!\" cried Dorothy. \"The idea of anyone wanting to injure  our dear Ozma!  Can't we do ANYthing to find her, Wizard?\"    \"I'll ask Glinda.  I must go straight back to her and tell her that my  magic tools have also disappeared.  The good Sorceress will be greatly  shocked, I know.\"    With this, he jumped upon the back of the Sawhorse again, and the  quaint steed, which never tired, dashed away at full speed.  The three  girls were very much disturbed in mind.  Even the Patchwork Girl seemed  to realize that a great calamity had overtaken them all.  Ozma was a  fairy of considerable power, and all the creatures in Oz as well as the  three mortal girls from the outside world looked upon her as their  protector and friend.  The idea of their beautiful girl Ruler's being  overpowered by an enemy and dragged from her splendid palace a captive  was too astonishing for them to comprehend at first.  Yet what other  explanation of the mystery could there be?    \"Ozma wouldn't go away willingly, without letting us know about it,\"  asserted Dorothy, \"and she wouldn't steal Glinda's Great Book of  Records or the Wizard's magic, 'cause she could get them any time just  by asking for 'em.  I'm sure some wicked person has done all this.\"    \"Someone in the Land of Oz?\" asked Trot.    \"Of course.  No one could get across the Deadly Desert, you know, and  no one but an Oz person could know about the Magic Picture and the Book  of Records and the Wizard's magic or where they were kept, and so be  able to steal the whole outfit before we could stop 'em.  It MUST be  someone who lives in the Land of Oz.\"    \"But who--who--who?\" asked Scraps.  \"That's the question.  Who?\"    \"If we knew,\" replied Dorothy severely, \"we wouldn't be standing here  doing nothing.\"    Just then two boys entered the courtyard and approached the group of  girls.  One boy was dressed in the fantastic Munchkin costume--a blue  jacket and knickerbockers, blue leather shoes and a blue hat with a  high peak and tiny silver bells dangling from its rim--and this was Ojo  the Lucky, who had once come from the Munchkin Country of Oz and now  lived in the Emerald City.  The other boy was an American from  Philadelphia and had lately found his way to Oz in the company of Trot  and Cap'n Bill.  His name was Button-Bright; that is, everyone called  him by that name and knew no other.  Button-Bright was not quite as big  as the Munchkin boy, but he wore the same kind of clothes, only they  were of different colors.  As the two came up to the girls, arm in arm,  Button-Bright remarked, \"Hello, Dorothy.  They say Ozma is lost.\"    \"WHO says so?\" she asked.    \"Ev'rybody's talking about it in the City,\" he replied.    \"I wonder how the people found it out,\" Dorothy asked.    \"I know,\" said Ojo.  \"Jellia Jamb told them. She has been asking  everywhere if anyone has seen Ozma.\"    \"That's too bad,\" observed Dorothy, frowning.    \"Why?\" asked Button-Bright.    \"There wasn't any use making all our people unhappy till we were dead  certain that Ozma can't be found.\"    \"Pshaw,\" said Button-Bright, \"it's nothing to get lost.  I've been lost  lots of times.\"    \"That's true,\" admitted Trot, who knew that the boy had a habit of  getting lost and then finding himself again, \"but it's diff'rent with  Ozma.  She's the Ruler of all this big fairyland, and we're 'fraid that  the reason she's lost is because somebody has stolen her away.\"    \"Only wicked people steal,\" said Ojo.  \"Do you know of any wicked  people in Oz, Dorothy?\"    \"No,\" she replied.    \"They're here, though,\" cried Scraps, dancing up to them and then  circling around the group.  \"Ozma's stolen; someone in Oz stole her;  only wicked people steal; so someone in Oz is wicked!\"    There was no denying the truth of this statement.  The faces of all of  them were now solemn and sorrowful.  \"One thing is sure,\" said  Button-Bright after a time, \"if Ozma has been stolen, someone ought to  find her and punish the thief.\"    \"There may be a lot of thieves,\" suggested Trot gravely, \"and in this  fairy country they don't seem to have any soldiers or policemen.\"    \"There is one soldier,\" claimed Dorothy.    \"He has green whiskers and a gun and is a Major-General, but no one is  afraid of either his gun or his whiskers, 'cause he's so tender-hearted  that he wouldn't hurt a fly.\"      \"Well, a soldier is a soldier,\" said Betsy, \"and perhaps he'd hurt a  wicked thief if he wouldn't hurt a fly.  Where is he?\"    \"He went fishing about two months ago and hasn't come back yet,\"  explained Button-Bright.    \"Then I can't see that he will be of much use to us in this trouble,\"  sighed little Trot.  \"But p'raps Ozma, who is a fairy, can get away  from the thieves without any help from anyone.\"    \"She MIGHT be able to,\" answered Dorothy reflectively, \"but if she had  the power to do that, it isn't likely she'd have let herself be stolen.  So the thieves must have been even more powerful in magic than our  Ozma.\"    There was no denying this argument, and although they talked the matter  over all the rest of that day, they were unable to decide how Ozma had  been stolen against her will or who had committed the dreadful deed.  Toward evening the Wizard came back, riding slowly upon the Sawhorse  because he felt discouraged and perplexed.  Glinda came later in her  aerial chariot drawn by twenty milk-white swans, and she also seemed  worried and unhappy.  More of Ozma's friends joined them, and that  evening they all had a big talk together.  \"I think,\" said Dorothy, \"we  ought to start out right away in search of our dear Ozma.  It seems  cruel for us to live comf'tably in her palace while she is a pris'ner  in the power of some wicked enemy.\"    \"Yes,\" agreed Glinda the Sorceress, \"someone ought to search for her. I  cannot go myself, because I must work hard in order to create some new  instruments of sorcery by means of which I may rescue our fair Ruler.  But if you can find her in the meantime and let me know who has stolen  her, it will enable me to rescue her much more quickly.\"    \"Then we'll start tomorrow morning,\" decided Dorothy.  \"Betsy and Trot  and I won't waste another minute.\"    \"I'm not sure you girls will make good detectives,\" remarked the  Wizard, \"but I'll go with you to protect you from harm and to give you  my advice.  All my wizardry, alas, is stolen, so I am now really no  more a wizard than any of you, but I will try to protect you from any  enemies you may meet.\"    \"What harm could happen to us in Oz?\" inquired Trot.    \"What harm happened to Ozma?\" returned the Wizard.    \"If there is an Evil"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/960"],[0,"The Tin Woodman of Oz (#5)"],[1,"angerous, but  we mustn't take chances. Enough accidents happen to us poor Loons as it  is, and my advice is to condemn and perforate 'em as quickly as  possible.\"    \"Keep your advice to yourself,\" said the monarch, in a peeved tone.  \"Who's King here, anyhow? You or Me?\"    \"We made you our King because you have less common sense than the rest  of us,\" answered Panta Loon, indignantly. \"I could have been King  myself, had I wanted to, but I didn't care for the hard work and  responsibility.\"    As he said this, the big Loon strutted back and forth in the space  between the throne of King Bal and the prisoners, and the other Loons  seemed much impressed by his defiance. But suddenly there came a sharp  report and Panta Loon instantly disappeared, to the great astonishment  of the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman and Woot the Wanderer, who saw on the  spot where the big fellow had stood a little heap of flabby, wrinkled  skin that looked like a collapsed rubber balloon.    \"There!\" exclaimed the King; \"I expected that would happen. The  conceited rascal wanted to puff himself up until he was bigger than the  rest of you, and this is the result of his folly. Get the pump working,  some of you, and blow him up again.\"    \"We will have to mend the puncture first, your Majesty,\" suggested one  of the Loons, and the prisoners noticed that none of them seemed  surprised or shocked at the sad accident to Panta.    \"All right,\" grumbled the King. \"Fetch Til to mend him.\"    One or two ran away and presently returned, followed by a lady Loon  wearing huge, puffed-up rubber skirts. Also she had a purple feather  fastened to a wart on the top of her head, and around her waist was a  sash of fibre-like vines, dried and tough, that looked like strings.    \"Get to work, Til,\" commanded King Bal. \"Panta has just exploded.\"    The lady Loon picked up the bunch of skin and examined it carefully  until she discovered a hole in one foot. Then she pulled a strand of  string from her sash, and drawing the edges of the hole together, she  tied them fast with the string, thus making one of those curious warts  which the strangers had noticed on so many Loons. Having done this, Til  Loon tossed the bit of skin to the other Loons and was about to go away  when she noticed the prisoners and stopped to inspect them.    \"Dear me!\" said Til; \"what dreadful creatures. Where did they come  from?\"    \"We captured them,\" replied one of the Loons.    \"And what are we going to do with them?\" inquired the girl Loon.    \"Perhaps we'll condemn 'em and puncture 'em,\" answered the King.    \"Well,\" said she, still eyeing the  \"I'm not sure they'll puncture.  Let's try it, and see.\"    One of the Loons ran to the forest's edge and quickly returned with a  long, sharp thorn. He glanced at the King, who nodded his head in  assent, and then he rushed forward and stuck the thorn into the leg of  the Scarecrow. The Scarecrow merely smiled and said nothing, for the  thorn didn't hurt him at all.    Then the Loon tried to prick the Tin Woodman's leg, but the tin only  blunted the point of the thorn.    \"Just as I thought,\" said Til, blinking her purple eyes and shaking her  puffy head; but just then the Loon stuck the thorn into the leg of Woot  the Wanderer, and while it had been blunted somewhat, it was still  sharp enough to hurt.    \"Ouch!\" yelled Woot, and kicked out his leg with so much energy that  the frail bonds that tied him burst apart. His foot caught the  Loon--who was leaning over him--full on his puffy stomach, and sent him  shooting up into the air. When he was high over their heads he exploded  with a loud \"pop\" and his skin fell to the ground.    \"I really believe,\" said the King, rolling his spotlike eyes in a  frightened way, \"that Panta was right in claiming these prisoners are  dangerous. Is the pump ready?\"    Some of the Loons had wheeled a big machine in front of the throne and  now took Panta's skin and began to pump air into it. Slowly it swelled  out until the King cried \"Stop!\"    \"No, no!\" yelled Panta, \"I'm not big enough yet.\"    \"You're as big as you're going to be,\" declared the King. \"Before you  exploded you were bigger than the rest of us, and that caused you to  be proud and overbearing. Now you're a little smaller than the rest,  and you will last longer and be more humble.\"    \"Pump me up--pump me up!\" wailed Panta \"If you don't you'll break my  heart.\"    \"If we do we'll break your skin,\" replied the King.    So the Loons stopped pumping air into Panta, and pushed him away from  the pump. He was certainly more humble than before his accident, for he  crept into the background and said nothing more.    \"Now pump up the other one,\" ordered the King. Til had already mended  him, and the Loons set to work to pump him full of air.    During these last few moments none had paid much attention to the  prisoners, so Woot, finding his legs free, crept over to the Tin  Woodman and rubbed the bonds that were still around his arms and body  against the sharp edge of the axe, which quickly cut them.    The boy was now free, and the thorn which the Loon had stuck into his  leg was lying unnoticed on the ground, where the creature had dropped  it when he exploded. Woot leaned forward and picked up the thorn, and  while the Loons were busy watching the pump, the boy sprang to his feet  and suddenly rushed upon the group.    \"Pop\"--\"pop\"--\"pop!\" went three of the Loons, when the Wanderer pricked  them with his thorn, and at the sounds the others looked around and saw  their danger. With yells of fear they bounded away in all directions,  scattering about the clearing, with Woot the Wanderer in full chase.  While they could run much faster than the boy, they often stumbled and  fell, or got in one another's way, so he managed to catch several and  prick them with his thorn.    It astonished him to see how easily the Loons exploded. When the air  was let out of them they were quite helpless. Til Loon was one of those  who ran against his thorn and many others suffered the same fate. The  creatures could not escape from the enclosure, but in their fright many  bounded upward and caught branches of the trees, and then climbed out  of reach of the dreaded thorn.    Woot was getting pretty tired chasing them, so he stopped and came  over, panting, to where his friends were sitting, still bound.    \"Very well done, my Wanderer,\" said the Tin Woodman. \"It is evident  that we need fear these puffed-up creatures no longer, so be kind  enough to unfasten our bonds and we will proceed upon our journey.\"    Woot untied the bonds of the Scarecrow and helped him to his feet. Then  he freed the Tin Woodman, who got up without help. Looking around them,  they saw that the only Loon now remaining within reach was Bal Loon,  the King, who had remained seated in his throne, watching the  punishment of his people with a bewildered look in his purple eyes.    \"Shall I puncture the King?\" the boy asked his companions.    King Bal must have overheard the question, for he fumbled with the cord  that fastened him to the throne and managed to release it. Then he  floated upward until he reached the leafy dome, and parting the  branches he disappeared from sight. But the string that was tied to his  body was still connected with the arm of the throne, and they knew they  could pull his Majesty down again, if they wanted to.    \"Let him alone,\" suggested the Scarecrow. \"He seems a good enough king  for his peculiar people, and after we are gone, the Loons will have  something of a job to pump up all those whom Woot has punctured.\"    \"Every one of them ought to be exploded,\" declared Woot, who was angry  because his leg still hurt him.    \"No,\" said the Tin Woodman, \"that would not be just fair. They were  quite right to capture us, because we had no business to intrude here,  having been warned to keep away from Loonville. This is their country,  not ours, and since the poor things can't get out of the clearing, they  can harm no one save those who venture here out of curiosity, as we  did.\"    \"Well said, my friend,\" agreed tile Scarecrow. \"We really had no right  to disturb their peace and comfort; so let us go away.\"    They easily found the place where they had forced their way into the  enclosure, so the Tin Woodman pushed aside the underbrush and started  first along the path. The Scarecrow followed next and last came Woot,  who looked back and saw that the Loons were still clinging to their  perches on the trees and watching their former captives with frightened  eyes.    \"I guess they're glad to see the last of us,\" remarked the boy, and  laughing at the happy ending of the adventure, he followed his comrades  along the path.          Chapter Five    Mrs. Yoop, the Giantess      When they had reached the end of the path, where they had first seen  the warning sign, they set off across the country in an easterly  direction. Before long they reached Rolling Lands, which were a  succession of hills and valleys where constant climbs and descents were  required, and their journey now became tedious, because on climbing  each hill, they found before them nothing in the valley below it except  grass, or weeds or stones.    Up and down they went for hours, with nothing to relieve the monotony  of the landscape, until finally, when they had topped a higher hill  than usual, they discovered a cup-shaped valley before them in the  center of which stood an enormous castle, built of purple stone.  The  castle was high and broad and long, but had no turrets and towers. So  far as they could see, there was but one small window and one big door  on each side of the great building.    \"This is strange!\" mused the Scarecrow. \"I'd no idea such a big castle  existed in this Gillikin Country. I wonder who lives here?\"    \"It seems to me, from this distance,\" remarked the Tin Woodman, \"that  it's the biggest castle I ever saw. It is really too big for any use,  and no one could"]]]
