They openly declare that their ends can be  attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing  social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble  at a Communistic revolution. The proletarians have  nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world  to win. Working men of all countries, unite!''    In all the great countries of the Continent,  except Russia, a revolution followed quickly on the  publication of the Communist Manifesto, but the  revolution was not economic or international, except  at first in France. Everywhere else it was inspired  by the ideas of nationalism. Accordingly, the rulers  of the world, momentarily terrified, were able to  recover power by fomenting the enmities inherent  in the nationalist idea, and everywhere, after a very  brief triumph, the revolution ended in war and  reaction. The ideas of the Communist Manifesto  appeared before the world was ready for them, but  its authors lived to see the beginnings of the growth  of that Socialist movement in every country, which  has pressed on with increasing force, influencing  Governments more and more, dominating the Russian  Revolution, and perhaps capable of achieving  at no very distant date that international triumph to  which the last sentences of the Manifesto summon  the wage-earners of the world.    Marx's magnum opus, ``Capital,'' added bulk  and substance to the theses of the Communist Manifesto.  It contributed the theory of surplus value,  which professed to explain the actual mechanism  of capitalist exploitation. This doctrine is very  complicated and is scarcely tenable as a contribution  to pure theory. It is rather to be viewed as a translation  into abstract terms of the hatred with which  Marx regarded the system that coins wealth out of  human lives, and it is in this spirit, rather than in  that of disinterested analysis, that it has been read  by its admirers. A critical examination of the theory  of surplus value would require much difficult and  abstract discussion of pure economic theory without  having much bearing upon the practical truth or  falsehood of Socialism; it has therefore seemed impossible  within the limits of the present volume. To  my mind the best parts of the book are those which  deal with economic facts, of which Marx's knowledge  was encyclopaedic. It was by these facts that  he hoped to instil into his disciples that firm and  undying hatred that should make them soldiers to  the death in the class war. The facts which he  accumulates are such as are practically unknown to  the vast majority of those who live comfortable lives.  They are very terrible facts, and the economic system  which generates them must be acknowledged to be  a very terrible system. A few examples of his choice  of facts will serve to explain the bitterness of many  Socialists:--      Mr. Broughton Charlton, county magistrate, declared,  as chairman of a meeting held at the Assembly Rooms,  Nottingham, on the 14th January, 1860, ``that there was  an amount of privation and suffering among that portion  of the population connected with the lace trade, unknown  in other parts of the kingdom, indeed, in the civilized  world. . . . Children of nine or ten years are dragged  from their squalid beds at two, three, or four o clock in  the morning and compelled to work for a bare subsistence  until ten, eleven, or twelve at night, their limbs wearing  away, their frames dwindling, their faces whitening,  and their humanity absolutely sinking into a stone-like  torpor, utterly horrible to contemplate.''[4]      [4] Vol. i, p. 227.      Three railway men are standing before a London coroner's  jury--a guard, an engine-driver, a signalman.  A tremendous railway accident has hurried hundreds of  passengers into another world. The negligence of the  employes is the cause of the misfortune. They declare  with one voice before the jury that ten or twelve years  before, their labor only lasted eight hours a day. During  the last five or six years it had been screwed up to  14, 18, and 20 hours, and under a specially severe pressure  of holiday-makers, at times of excursion trains, it  often lasted 40 or 50 hours without a break. They  were ordinary men, not Cyclops. At a certain point their  labor-power failed. Torpor seized them. Their brain  ceased to think, their eyes to see. The thoroughly  ``respectable'' British jurymen answered by a verdict that  sent them to the next assizes on a charge of manslaughter,  and, in a gentle ``rider'' to their verdict, expressed the  pious hope that the capitalistic magnates of the railways  would, in future, be more extravagant in the purchase of  a sufficient quantity of labor-power, and more ``abstemious,''  more ``self-denying,'' more ``thrifty,'' in the  draining of paid labor-power.[5]      [5] Vol. i, pp. 237, 238.      In the last week of June, 1863, all the London daily  papers published a paragraph with the ``sensational''  heading, ``Death from simple over-work.'' It dealt with  the death of the milliner, Mary Anne Walkley, 20 years  of age, employed in a highly respectable dressmaking  establishment, exploited by a lady with the pleasant name  of Elise. The old, often-told story was once more recounted.  This girl worked, on an average, 16 1/2 hours,  during the season often 30 hours, without a break, whilst  her failing labor-power was revived by occasional supplies  of sherry, port, or coffee. It was just now the  height of the season. It was necessary to conjure up  in the twinkling of an eye the gorgeous dresses for the  noble ladies bidden to the ball in honor of the newly-  imported Princess of Wales. Mary Anne Walkley had  worked without intermission for 26 1/2 hours, with 60  other girls, 30 in one room, that only afforded 1/3 of  the cubic feet of air required for them. At night, they  slept in pairs in one of the stifling holes into which the  bedroom was divided by partitions of board. And this  was one of the best millinery establishments in London.  Mary Anne Walkley fell ill on the Friday, died on Sunday,  without, to the astonishment of Madame Elise,  having previously completed the work in hand. The doctor,  Mr. Keys, called too late to the death bed, duly bore  witness before the coroner's jury that ``Mary Anne  Walkley had died from long hours of work in an over-  crowded workroom, and a too small and badly ventilated  bedroom.'' In order to give the doctor a lesson in good  manners, the coroner's jury thereupon brought in a verdict  that ``the deceased had died of apoplexy, but there  was reason to fear that her death had been accelerated  by over-work in an over-crowded workroom, &c.'' ``Our  white slaves,'' cried the ``Morning Star,'' the organ of the  free-traders, Cobden and Bright, ``our white slaves, who  are toiled into the grave, for the most part silently pine  and die.''[6]      [6] Vol. i, pp. 239, 240.      Edward VI: A statue of the first year of his reign,  1547, ordains that if anyone refuses to work, he shall be  condemned as a slave to the person who has denounced  him as an idler. The master shall feed his slave on bread  and water, weak broth and such refuse meat as he thinks  fit. He has the right to force him to do any work, no  matter how disgusting, with whip and chains. If the  slave is absent a fortnight, he is condemned to slavery for  life and is to be branded on forehead or back with the  letter S; if he runs away thrice, he is to be executed as  a felon. The master can sell him, bequeath him, let him  out on hire as a slave, just as any other personal chattel  or cattle. If the slaves attempt anything against the  masters, they are also to be executed. Justices of the  peace, on information, are to hunt the rascals down. If it  happens that a vagabond has been idling about for three  days, he is to be taken to his birthplace, branded with a  redhot iron with the letter V on the breast and be set  to work, in chains, in the streets or at some other labor.  If the vagabond gives a false birthplace, he is then to  become the slave for life of this place, of its inhabitants,  or its corporation, and to be branded with an S. All persons  have the right to take away the children of the  vagabonds and to keep them as apprentices, the young  men until the 24th year, the girls until the 20th. If  they run away, they are to become up to this age the  slaves of their masters, who can put them in irons, whip  them, &c., if they like. Every master may put an iron  ring around the neck, arms or legs of his slave, by which  to know him more easily and to be more certain of him.  The last part of this statute provides that certain poor  people may be employed by a place or by persons, who  are willing to give them food and drink and to find them  work. This kind of parish-slaves was kept up in England  until far into the 19th century under the name of  ``roundsmen.''[7]      [7] Vol. i, pp. 758, 759.      Page after page and chapter after chapter of  facts of this nature, each brought up to illustrate  some fatalistic theory which Marx professes to have  proved by exact reasoning, cannot but stir into fury  any passionate working-class reader, and into  unbearable shame any possessor of capital in whom  generosity and justice are not wholly extinct.    Almost at the end of the volume, in a very brief  chapter, called ``Historical Tendency of Capitalist  Accumulation,'' Marx allows one moment's glimpse  of the hope that lies beyond the present horror:--      As soon as this process of transformation has  sufficiently decomposed the old society from top to bottom,  as soon as the laborers are turned into proletarians, their  means of labor into capital, as soon as the capitalist  mode of production stands on its own feet, then the  further socialization of labor and further transformation  of the land and other"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6927"],[0,"The White Feather (#5)"],[1,"oaf,  now--'ullo, 'ullo, wot's this?\"    There was a \"confused noise without\", as Shakespeare would put it, and  into the shop came clattering Barry and McTodd, of Seymour's, closely  followed by Stanning and Attell.    \"This is getting a bit too thick,\" said Barry, collapsing into a chair.    From the outer shop came the voice of Sergeant Cook.    \"Let me jest come to you, you red-'eaded--\"    Roars of derision from the road.    \"That's Albert,\" said Linton, jumping up.    \"Yes, I heard them call him that,\" said Barry. \"McTodd and I were  coming down here to tea, when they started going for us, so we nipped  in here, hoping to find reinforcements.\"    \"We were just behind you,\" said Stanning. \"I got one of them a beauty.  He went down like a shot.\"    \"Albert?\" inquired Linton.    \"No. A little chap.\"    \"Let's go out, and smash them up,\" suggested Linton excitedly.    Dunstable treated the situation more coolly.    \"Wait a bit,\" he said. \"No hurry. Let's finish tea at any rate. You'd  better eat as much as you can now Linton. You may have no teeth left to  do it with afterwards,\" he added cheerfully.    \"Let's chuck things at them,\" said McTodd.    \"Don't be an ass,\" said Barry. \"What on earth's the good of that?\"    \"Well, it would be something,\" said McTodd vaguely.    \"Hit 'em with a muffin,\" suggested Stanning. \"Dash, I barked my  knuckles on that man. But I bet he felt it.\"    \"Look here, I'm going out,\" said Linton. \"Come on, Dunstable.\"    Dunstable continued his meal without hurry.    \"What's the excitement?\" he said. \"There's plenty of time. Dear old  Albert's not the sort of chap to go away when he's got us cornered  here. The first principle of warfare is to get a good feed before you  start.\"    \"And anyhow,\" said Barry, \"I came here for tea, and I'm going to have  it.\"    Sergeant Cook was recalled from the door, and received the orders.    \"They've just gone round the corner,\" he said, \"and that red-'eaded one  'e says he's goin' to wait if he 'as to wait all night.\"    \"Quite right,\" said Dunstable, approvingly. \"Sensible chap, Albert. If  you see him, you might tell him we shan't be long, will you?\"    A quarter of an hour passed.    \"Kerm out,\" shouted a voice from the street.    Dunstable looked at the others.    \"Perhaps we might be moving now,\" he said, getting up \"Ready?\"    \"We must keep together,\" said Barry.    \"You goin' out, Mr Dunstable?\" inquired Sergeant Cook.    \"Yes. Good bye. You'll see that we're decently buried won't you?\"    The garrison made its sortie.           *       *       *       *       *    It happened that Drummond and Sheen were also among those whom it had  struck that afternoon that tea at Cook's would be pleasant; and they  came upon the combatants some five minutes after battle had been  joined. The town contingent were filling the air with strange cries,  Albert's voice being easily heard above the din, while the Wrykinians,  as public-school men should, were fighting quietly and without unseemly  tumult.    \"By Jove,\" said Drummond, \"here's a row on.\"    Sheen stopped dead, with a queer, sinking feeling within him. He  gulped. Drummond did not notice these portents. He was observing the  battle.    Suddenly he uttered an exclamation.    \"Why, it's some of our chaps! There's a Seymour's cap. Isn't that  McTodd? And, great Scott! there's Barry. Come on, man!\"    Sheen did not move.    \"Ought we...to get...mixed up...?\" he began.    Drummond looked at him with open eyes. Sheen babbled on.    \"The old man might not like--sixth form, you see--oughtn't we to--?\"    There was a yell of triumph from the town army as the red-haired  Albert, plunging through the fray, sent Barry staggering against the  wall. Sheen caught a glimpse of Albert's grinning face as he turned. He  had a cut over one eye. It bled.    \"Come on,\" said Drummond, beginning to run to the scene of action.    Sheen paused for a moment irresolutely. Then he walked rapidly in the  opposite direction.          V    THE WHITE FEATHER      It was not until he had reached his study that Sheen thoroughly  realised what he had done. All the way home he had been defending  himself eloquently against an imaginary accuser; and he had built up a  very sound, thoughtful, and logical series of arguments to show that he  was not only not to blame for what he had done, but had acted in highly  statesmanlike and praiseworthy manner. After all, he was in the sixth.  Not a prefect, it was true, but, still, practically a prefect. The  headmaster disliked unpleasantness between school and town, much more  so between the sixth form of the school and the town. Therefore, he had  done his duty in refusing to be drawn into a fight with Albert and  friends. Besides, why should he be expected to join in whenever he saw  a couple of fellows fighting? It wasn't reasonable. It was no business  of his. Why, it was absurd. He had no quarrel with those fellows. It  wasn't cowardice. It was simply that he had kept his head better than  Drummond, and seen further into the matter. Besides....    But when he sat down in his chair, this mood changed. There is a vast  difference between the view one takes of things when one is walking  briskly, and that which comes when one thinks the thing over coldly. As  he sat there, the wall of defence which he had built up slipped away  brick by brick, and there was the fact staring at him, without covering  or disguise.    It was no good arguing against himself. No amount of argument could  wipe away the truth. He had been afraid, and had shown it. And he had  shown it when, in a sense, he was representing the school, when Wrykyn  looked to him to help it keep its end up against the town.    The more he reflected, the more he saw how far-reaching were the  consequences of that failure in the hour of need. He had disgraced  himself. He had disgraced Seymour's. He had disgraced the school. He  was an outcast.    This mood, the natural reaction from his first glow of almost jaunty  self-righteousness, lasted till the lock-up bell rang, when it was  succeeded by another. This time he took a more reasonable view of the  affair. It occurred to him that there was a chance that his defection  had passed unnoticed. Nothing could make his case seem better in his  own eyes, but it might be that the thing would end there. The house  might not have lost credit.    An overwhelming curiosity seized him to find out how it had all ended.  The ten minutes of grace which followed the ringing of the lock-up bell  had passed. Drummond and the rest must be back by now.    He went down the passage to Drummond's study. Somebody was inside. He  could hear him.    He knocked at the door.    Drummond was sitting at the table reading. He looked up, and there was  a silence. Sheen's mouth felt dry. He could not think how to begin. He  noticed that Drummond's face was unmarked. Looking down, he saw that  one of the knuckles of the hand that held the book was swollen and cut.    \"Drummond, I--\"    Drummond lowered the book.    \"Get out,\" he said. He spoke without heat, calmly, as if he were making  some conventional remark by way of starting a conversation.    \"I only came to ask--\"    \"Get out,\" said Drummond again.    There was another pause. Drummond raised his book and went on reading.    Sheen left the room.    Outside he ran into Linton. Unlike Drummond, Linton bore marks of the  encounter. As in the case of the hero of Calverley's poem, one of his  speaking eyes was sable. The swelling of his lip was increased. There  was a deep red bruise on his forehead. In spite of these injuries,  however, he was cheerful. He was whistling when Sheen collided with  him.    \"Sorry,\" said Linton, and went on into the study.    \"Well,\" he said, \"how are you feeling, Drummond? Lucky beggar, you  haven't got a mark. I wish I could duck like you. Well, we have fought  the good fight. Exit Albert--sweep him up. You gave him enough to last  him for the rest of the term. I couldn't tackle the brute. He's as  strong as a horse. My word, it was lucky you happened to come up.  Albert was making hay of us. Still, all's well that ends well. We have  smitten the Philistines this day. By the way--\"    \"What's up now?\"    \"Who was that chap with you when you came up?\"    \"Which chap?\"    \"I thought I saw some one.\"    \"You shouldn't eat so much tea. You saw double.\"    \"There wasn't anybody?\"    \"No,\" said Drummond.    \"Not Sheen?\"    \"No,\" said Drummond, irritably. \"How many more times do you want me to  say it?\"    \"All right,\" said Linton, \"I only asked. I met him outside.\"    \"Who?\"    \"Sheen.\"    \"Oh!\"    \"You might be sociable.\"    \"I know I might. But I want to read.\"    \"Lucky man. Wish I could. I can hardly see. Well, good bye, then. I'm  off.\"    \"Good,\" grunted Drummond. \"You know your way out, don't you?\"    Linton went back to his own study.    \"It's all very well,\" he said to himself, \"for Drummond to deny it, but  I'll swear I saw Sheen with him. So did Dunstable. I'll cut out and ask  him about it after prep. If he really was there, and cut off, something  ought to be done about it. The chap ought to be kicked. He's a disgrace  to the house.\"    Dunstable, questioned after preparation, refused to commit himself.    \"I thought I saw somebody with Drummond,\" he said, \"and I had a sort of  idea it was Sheen. Still, I was pretty busy at the time, and wasn't  paying much attention to anything, except that long, thin bargee with  the bowler. I wish those men would hit straight. It's beastly difficult  to guard a round-arm swing. My right ear feels like a cauliflower. Does  it look rum?\"    \"Beastly. But what about this? You can't swear to Sheen then?\"    \"No. Better give him the benefit of the doubt. What does Drummond say?  You ought to ask him.\"    \"I have. He says he was alone.\"    \"Well, that settles it. What an ass you are. If Drummond doesn't know,  who does?\"    \"I believe he's simply hushing it up.\"    \"Well, let us hush it up,"]]]
