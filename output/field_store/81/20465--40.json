We glanced at a huge  sheet of water, about 268 miles long, varying from thirty to nearly sixty  miles in width, with an area of 9600 square miles, whose elevation from  tide water is judged to be 564 feet.    This majestic spectacle, as animated as it was, imparted to us an adequate  conception of a boisterous inland sea. The surface of the lake was in wild  uproar; the advancing and retreating waves were beating themselves into  angry foam, and dashed their spray pearls almost to our feet; their  opulent azure hue being dimmed by the violent agitation. The inexperienced  eye has no idea of the imposing impression caused by the extremely  subitaneous changes to which these waters are subjected. The wide bosom of  the lake that sometimes lies motionless and glassy, without a breath of  air to cause the slightest undulation, in a very short time may be  scourged by a sudden gale. The wild gambols of the waves, accompanied by  the roar of the disturbed elements, may well cause the timid to fear; for,  as the swell lifts, you would think the bases of the earth are rising  beneath it; and, again, when it falls, you would imagine the foundation of  the deep had given away.    Though the billows before us now were beaten by a powerful breeze,  breaking with angry roar upon the barrier upon which we stood, yet not the  slightest feeling of fear found place within our hearts. On the contrary,  as we left the breakwater in order to return to Buffalo, I felt my heart  palpitating with joy as I thought of the pleasing prospect to be tossed by  those grand waves.    Having chosen a place at the foot of Main Street for our stay, the orders  to secure the \"Marguerite\" were instantly carried out; and immediately a  multitude of curious beholders had gathered around the yacht, viewing her  with evident expression of admiration.    Since it was yet early in the afternoon we decided to go on shore, in  order to view the points of interest in this important city.    A ride in the electric railway, traversing it in every direction, made us  acquainted with a good portion of Buffalo, which contains a population of  nearly 300,000, being the third city in size in the Empire State. It is  handsomely laid out with broad and well shaded streets. One hundred and  three miles are paved with asphalt, and 133 miles with stone. We saw many  fine residences with attractive grounds, and numerous public squares.  Delaware Avenue, the leading street for elegant mansions, is about three  miles long, and is lined with a double row of trees.    The city possesses a superb system of parks and pleasure grounds, designed  and laid out by Frederick Law Olmsted, the architect of Central Park in  New York City. It comprises three sections, situated respectively in the  northern, western, and eastern parts of Buffalo, which, with the  connecting boulevard, afford a drive of nearly ten miles.    Main Street, the principal trading thoroughfare, has many substantial  business blocks.    Of the prominent public buildings, the city and county hall deserves being  mentioned in the first place. It is an imposing structure, of Maine  granite, in the form of a double Roman cross, with a tower 245 feet high,  surmounted by four statues. This magnificent edifice is fronting on  Franklin Street, and was completed in 1880 at a cost of nearly $1,500,000.    Other handsome buildings are the U.S. custom house and postoffice, at the  corner of Washington and Seneca Streets; the Buffalo library, on Lafayette  Square; the State arsenal, in Broadway; the Erie County penitentiary, one  of the six penal establishments of New York; the general hospital, in High  Street; and the State asylum for the insane, an edifice which cost about  $3,000,000, located in Forest Avenue, adjoining the Buffalo Park.    The city is also adorned with several handsome churches and theaters.    Buffalo was first settled by the Dutch in 1801, and became an important  military post during the war of 1812. It was burned by a combined force of  British and Indians in 1814. Its city charter was granted in 1832, and  since then its growth has been very rapid.    As regards its live-stock trade, Buffalo ranks third among the cities in  the Union, and its iron and steel works are next in importance to those of  Pittsburg. The shipment of Pennsylvania coal, which finds a depot here,  has been greatly increased in recent years; about 1,500,000 tons being  distributed annually. The lumber trade is also large, but has been partly  diverted to Tonawanda, ten miles below Buffalo.    The industrial works comprise four blast furnaces, large rolling mills,  machine shops, car shops, iron ship-yards, stove foundries, tanneries,  flour mills, and manufacturing of agricultural implements.    Early on Monday morning, I abandoned the land of dreams in order to appear  on deck in good season; since arrangements had been made for going into  dry-dock that very morning.    Reader, have you ever been there? I hear you answer negatively. Well, that  is just what I expected; for it is a rather unusual and rare experience  for ladies, even in the eyes of a shipwright, a man who is constantly  employed in that place, that a boat enters the dry-dock with her  passengers on board.    It was partly a matter of necessity, and partly of circumspection, that  caused us to abide in the dry-dock for a few hours.    In consequence of the numerous low bridges that span the canal, the spars,  rigging, and smoke-stack belonging to the complete equipment of the  \"Marguerite\" would have made her journey on that artificial waterway  absolutely impossible; therefore it was necessary to replace these parts  in their appropriate positions.    The picture in the frontispiece gives evidence of that fact; as the  \"Marguerite\" presented a very different picture completely rigged.    Now, on the point of sailing on the Great Lakes, it was requisite to dress  the yacht in her proper array, with her high tapering masts; the cords of  her rigging stretching from spar to spar with the beautiful accuracy of a  picture; and so equipped, as to give her the appearance of a majestic,  white winged sea-bird resting gracefully on the water.    For the purpose of bestowing upon her such an outfit, as well as for  having her bottom examined, she was docked in Mill's dry-dock. The latter  motive, I must add, was effected by a mere act of precaution; since no  components of the propelling machinery had been injured or damaged.    But Mr. James, our ever thoughtful commodore, wished to be assured that he  could direct the \"Marguerite\" on her westward course with everything  pertaining to her in complete order.    These docks may be in communication either with a wet dock or a tidal  harbor. I observed that the dry-dock we entered had a pontoon gate,  floated in or out of place as desired. There being no tides in the lakes,  this style of gate--less liable to leak under continuous pressure--is  invariably used; for the only method of emptying the docks here is by  pumping, for which purpose a steam-engine and pumps, with a well and water  channel leading to it, were employed.    We scarcely had made our entry into it, ere many busy hands worked to give  the keel of the yacht a secure rest on wooden blocks which were fastened  down to prevent them floating. They were of such a height as to permit the  shipwright getting under the vessel's bottom. Then side shores were put in  to keep the boat in an upright position. This being accomplished, I could  notice that the pumping machinery was brought into full operation. Soon I  found that the level of the water became lower and lower, and after the  expiration of about one-half hour the dock was almost dry.    The sides of the dock generally consist of stone steps--called altars--for  the purpose of fixing the lower ends of the shores, and also for the  convenience of supporting the workmen's scaffold.    Mr. James and family, including myself, left the yacht to the crew and  workmen, while we further explored the city of Buffalo in carriages,  thoughtfully provided for us.    The day after our entering dry-dock, August 1st, was eventful, as it was  arranged we should make an excursion to view one of Nature's greatest  wonders--_Niagara Falls_--a sight unlike any other on the surface of the  globe. The indescribable grandeur of the whole overwhelms the soul--to  contemplate that tremendous torrent which never stops! No rest in the ages  of the past--no promise of a moment's stay in all the years to come--but  on, on, with resistless force!    Our thoughts become like the mists that rise above this awful scene, and  we are mute--Pigmies of an hour! To feel that after what we are becomes a  little dust, that solemn roar will echo in the ears of millions now  unborn!    Though I had read diverse descriptions portraying the grandeur and  magnificence of Niagara Falls, still I was aware that they had failed in  conveying a clear and succinct outline of their wonderful proportions and  great sublimity. My conclusions that, in older to be properly appreciated  these gigantic cataracts must be visited, were confirmed, and, _re vera_,  when once viewed the recollection of that glorious sight will linger long  in memory.    An hour's ride in the cars brought us to the village of Niagara Falls, a  splendid manufacturing point, having all modern improvements and  unsurpassed railway facilities of various kinds. The village was  incorporated in 1848, and has about 4,000 inhabitants.    The average annual number of visitors to this beautiful place is estimated  to be 400,000.    At the station of Niagara Falls, Mr. James engaged vehicles which afforded  accommodations for all of us--a party of ten--including the steward, who  accompanied us, carrying a bountiful repast.    The drivers of Niagara Falls are excellent _ciceroni_. We drove through  the handsome village to Prospect Park, a property owned by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9411"],[0,"Legends of the Gods (#5)"],[1,"name; this she told him, and she begged him once again to tell  her his name.  For a time the god refused to utter the name, but as the  pain in his body became more violent, and the poison passed through his  veins like fire, he said, \"Isis shall search in me, and my name shall  pass from my body into hers.\"  At that moment Ra removed himself from  the sight of the gods in his Boat, and the Throne in the Boat of  Millions of Years had no occupant.  The great name of Ra was, it seems,  hidden in his heart, and Isis, having some doubt as to whether Ra would  keep his word or not, agreed with Horus that Ra must be made to take an  oath to part with his two Eyes, that is, the Sun and the Moon.  At  length Ra allowed his heart to be taken from his body, and his great  and secret name, whereby he lived, passed into the possession of Isis.  Ra thus became to all intents and purposes a dead god.  Then Isis,  strong in the power of her spells, said: \"Flow, poison, come out of Ra.  Eye of Horus, come out of Ra, and shine outside his mouth.  It is I,  Isis, who work, and I have made the poison to fall on the ground.  Verily the name of the great god is taken from him, Ra shall live and  the poison shall die; if the poison live Ra shall die.\"    This was the infallible spell which was to be used in cases of  poisoning, for it rendered the bite or sting of every venomous reptile  harmless.  It drove the poison out of Ra, and since it was composed by  Isis after she obtained the knowledge of his secret name it was  irresistible.  If the words were written on papyrus or linen over a  figure of Temu or Heru-hekenu, or Isis, or Horus, they became a mighty  charm.  If the papyrus or linen were steeped in water and the water  drunk, the words were equally efficacious as a charm against snake-  bites.  To this day water in which the written words of a text from the  Kur'an have been dissolved, or water drunk from a bowl on the inside of  which religious texts have been written, is still regarded as a never-  failing charm in Egypt and the Sudan.  Thus we see that the modern  custom of drinking magical water was derived from the ancient  Egyptians, who believed that it conveyed into their bodies the actual  power of their gods.            IV.          THE LEGEND OF HERU-BEHUTET AND THE WINGED DISK.          The text of this legend is cut in hieroglyphics on the walls of the  temple of Edfu in Upper Egypt, and certain portions of it are  illustrated by large bas-reliefs.  Both text and reliefs were published  by Professor Naville in his volume entitled Mythe d'Horus, fol., plates  12-19, Geneva, 1870.  A German translation by Brugsch appeared in the  Ahandlungen der Gottinger Akademie, Band xiv., pp. 173-236, and another  by Wiedemann in his Die Religion, p. 38 ff. (see the English  translation p. 69 ff.).  The legend, in the form in which it is here  given, dates from the Ptolemaic Period, but the matter which it  contains is far older, and it is probable that the facts recorded in it  are fragments of actual history, which the Egyptians of the late period  tried to piece together in chronological order.  We shall see as we  read that the writer of the legend as we have it was not well  acquainted with Egyptian history, and that in his account of the  conquest of Egypt he has confounded one god with another, and mixed up  historical facts with mythological legends to such a degree that his  meaning is frequently uncertain.  The great fact which he wished to  describe is the conquest of Egypt by an early king, who, having subdued  the peoples in the South, advanced northwards, and made all the people  whom he conquered submit to his yoke.  Now the King of Egypt was always  called Horus, and the priests of Edfu wishing to magnify their local  god, Horus of Behutet, or Horus of Edfu, attributed to him the  conquests of this human, and probably predynastic, king.  We must  remember that the legend assumes that Ra, was still reigning on earth,  though he was old and feeble, and had probably deputed his power to his  successor, whom the legend regards as his son.        PLATE I.  Horus holding the Hippopotamus-fiend with chain and spear.  Behind  stand Isis and Heru Khenti-Khatti.    PLATE II.  Horus driving his spear into the Hippopotamus-fiend; behind him stands  one of his \"Blacksmiths\".    PLATE III.  Horus driving his spear into the belly of the Hippopotamus-fiend as he  lies on his back; behind stands on of his \"Blacksmiths\".    PLATE IV.  Horus and Isis capturing the Hippopotamus-fiend.        In the 363rd year of his reign Ra-Harmakhis[FN#23] was in Nubia with  his army with the intention of destroying those who had conspired  against him; because of their conspiracy (auu) Nubia is called \"Uaua\"  to this day.  From Nubia Ra-Harmakhis sailed down the river to Edfu,  where Heru-Behutet entered his boat, and told him that his foes were  conspiring against him.  Ra-Harmakhis in answer addressed Heru-Behutet  as his son, and commanded him to set out without delay and slay the  wicked rebels.  Then Heru-Behutet took the form of a great winged Disk,  and at once flew up into the sky, where he took the place of Ra, the  old Sun-god.  Looking down from the height of heaven he was able to  discover the whereabouts of the rebels, and he pursued them in the form  of a winged disk.  Then he attacked them with such violence that they  became dazed, and could neither see where they were going, nor hear,  the result of this being that they slew each other, and in a very short  time they were all dead.  Thoth, seeing this, told Ra that because  Horus had appeared as a great winged disk he must be called \"Heru-  Behutet,\" and by this name Horus was known ever after at Edfu.  Ra  embraced Horus, and referred with pleasure to the blood which he had  shed, and Horus invited his father to come and look upon the slain.  Ra  set out with the goddess Ashthertet (`Ashtoreth) to do this, and they  saw the enemies lying fettered on the ground.  The legend here  introduces a number of curious derivations of the names of Edfu, &c.,  which are valueless, and which remind us of the derivations of place-  names propounded by ancient Semitic scribes.        [FN#23]  i.e., Ra on the horizon.        PLATE V.  Horus standing on the back of the Hippopotamus-fiend, and spearing him  in the presence of Isis.    PLATE VI.  The \"Butcher-priest\" slicing open the Hippopotamus-fiend.        In gladness of heart Ra proposed a sail on the Nile, but as soon as his  enemies heard that he was coming, they changed themselves into  crocodiles and hippopotami, so that they might be able to wreck his  boat and devour him.  As the boat of the god approached them they  opened their jaws to crush it, but Horus and his followers came quickly  on the scene, and defeated their purpose.  The followers of Horus here  mentioned are called in the text \"Mesniu,\" i.e., \"blacksmiths,\" or  \"workers in metal,\" and they represent the primitive conquerors of the  Egyptians, who were armed with metal weapons, and so were able to  overcome with tolerable ease the indigenous Egyptians, whose weapons  were made of flint and wood.  Horus and his \"blacksmiths\" were provided  with iron lances and chains, and, baying cast the chains over the  monsters in the river, they drove their lances into their snouts, and  slew 651 of them.  Because Horus gained his victory by means of metal  weapons, Ra decreed that a metal statue of Horus should be placed at  Edfu, and remain there for ever, and a name was given to the town to  commemorate the great battle that had taken place there.  Ra applauded  Horus for the mighty deeds which be had been able to perform by means  of the spells contained in the \"Book of Slaying the Hippopotamus.\"  Horus then associated with himself the goddesses Uatchet and Nekhebet,  who were in the form of serpents, and, taking his place as the winged  Disk on the front of the Boat of Ra, destroyed all the enemies of Ra  wheresoever he found them.  When the remnant of the enemies of Ra, saw  that they were likely to be slain, they doubled back to the South, but  Horus pursued them, and drove them down the river before him as far as  Thebes.  One battle took place at Tchetmet, and another at Denderah,  and Horus was always victorious; the enemies were caught by chains  thrown over them, and the deadly spears of the Blacksmiths drank their  blood.    After this the enemy fled to the North, and took refuge in the swamps  of the Delta, and in the shallows of the Mediterranean Sea, and Horus  pursued them thither.  After searching for them for four days and four  nights he found them, and they were speedily slain.  One hundred and  forty-two of them and a male hippopotamus were dragged on to the Boat  of Ra, and there Horus dug out their entrails, and hacked their  carcases in pieces, which he gave to his Blacksmiths and the gods who  formed the crew of the Boat of Ra.  Before despatching the  hippopotamus, Horus leaped on to the back of the monster as a mark of  his triumph, and to commemorate this event the priest of Heben, the  town wherein these things happened, was called \"He who standeth on the  back ever after.\"    The end of the great fight, however, was not yet.  Another army of  enemies appeared by the North Lake, and they were marching towards the  sea; but terror of Horus smote their hearts, and they fled and took  refuge in Mertet-Ament, where they allied themselves with the followers  of Set, the Arch-fiend and great Enemy of Ra.  Thither Horus and his  well-armed Blacksmiths pursued them, and came up with them at the town  called Per-Rerehu, which derived its name from the \"Two Combatants,\" or  \"Two Men,\" Horus and Set.  A great fight took place, the enemies of Ra  were defeated with great slaughter, and Horus dragged 381 prisoners on  to the Boat of Ra, where he slew them, and gave their bodies to his  followers.
