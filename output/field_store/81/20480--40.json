He scarcely had time to bid the black, with a faint voice, to show this  second comer in, before the door was thrown hastily open, and the  stranger himself entered the apartment. He paused a moment, as the  person of Harper met his view, and then, in a more formal manner,  repeated the request he had before made through the servant. Mr. Wharton  and his family disliked the appearance of this new visitor excessively;  but the inclemency of the weather, and the uncertainty of the  consequences, if he were refused the desired lodgings, compelled the old  gentleman to give a reluctant acquiescence.    Some of the dishes were replaced by the orders of Miss Peyton, and the  weather-beaten intruder was invited to partake of the remains of the  repast, from which the party had just risen. Throwing aside a rough  greatcoat, he very composedly took the offered chair, and  unceremoniously proceeded to allay the cravings of an appetite which  appeared by no means delicate. But at every mouthful he would turn an  unquiet eye on Harper, who studied his appearance with a closeness of  investigation that was very embarrassing to its subject. At length,  pouring out a glass of wine, the newcomer nodded significantly to his  examiner, previously to swallowing the liquor, and said, with something  of bitterness in his manner,--    \"I drink to our better acquaintance, sir; I believe this is the first  time we have met, though your attention would seem to say otherwise.\"    The quality of the wine seemed greatly to his fancy, for, on replacing  the glass upon the table, he gave his lips a smack, that resounded  through the room; and, taking up the bottle, he held it between himself  and the light, for a moment, in silent contemplation of its clear and  brilliant color.    \"I think we have never met before, sir,\" replied Harper with a slight  smile on his features, as he observed the move ments of the other; but  appearing satisfied with his scrutiny, he turned to Sarah Wharton, who  sat next him, and carelessly remarked,--    \"You doubtless find your present abode solitary, after being accustomed  to the gayeties of the city.\"    \"Oh! excessively so,\" said Sarah hastily. \"I do wish, with my father,  that this cruel war was at an end, that we might return to our friends  once more.\"    \"And you, Miss Frances, do you long as ardently for peace as your  sister?\"    \"On many accounts I certainly do,\" returned the other, venturing to  steal a timid glance at her interrogator; and, meeting the same  benevolent expression of feeling as before, she continued, as her own  face lighted into one of its animated and bright smiles of intelligence,  \"but not at the expense of the rights of my countrymen.\"    \"Rights!\" repeated her sister, impatiently; \"whose rights can be  stronger than those of a sovereign: and what duty is clearer, than to  obey those who have a natural right to command?\"    \"None, certainly,\" said Frances, laughing with great pleasantry; and,  taking the hand of her sister affectionately within both of her own, she  added, with a smile directed towards Harper,--    \"I gave you to understand that my sister and myself differed in our  political opinions; but we have an impartial umpire in my father, who  loves his own countrymen, and he loves the British,--so he takes sides  with neither.\"    \"Yes,\" said Mr. Wharton, in a little alarm, eying first one guest, and  then the other; \"I have near friends in both armies, and I dread a  victory by either, as a source of certain private misfortune.\"    \"I take it, you have little reason to apprehend much from the Yankees,  in that way,\" interrupted the guest at the table, coolly helping himself  to another glass, from the bottle he had admired.    \"His majesty may have more experienced troops than the continentals,\"  answered the host fearfully, \"but the Americans have met with  distinguished success.\"    Harper disregarded the observations of both; and, rising, he desired to  be shown to his place of rest. A small boy was directed to guide him to  his room; and wishing a courteous good-night to the whole party, the  traveler withdrew. The knife and fork fell from the hands of the  unwelcome intruder, as the door closed on the retiring figure of Harper;  he arose slowly from his seat; listening attentively, he approached the  door of the room--opened it--seemed to attend to the retreating  footsteps of the other--and, amidst the panic and astonishment of his  companions, he closed it again. In an instant, the red wig which  concealed his black locks, the large patch which hid half his face from  observation, the stoop that had made him appear fifty years of age,  disappeared.    \"My father!-my dear father!\"--cried the handsome young man; \"and you, my  dearest sisters and aunt!--have I at last met you again?\"    \"Heaven bless you, my Henry, my son!\" exclaimed the astonished but  delighted parent; while his sisters sank on his shoulders, dissolved  in tears.    The faithful old black, who had been reared from infancy in the house of  his master, and who, as if in mockery of his degraded state, had been  complimented with the name of Caesar, was the only other witness of this  unexpected discovery of the son of Mr. Wharton. After receiving the  extended hand of his young master, and imprinting on it a fervent kiss,  Caesar withdrew. The boy did not reenter the room; and the black  himself, after some time, returned, just as the young British captain  was exclaiming,--    \"But who is this Mr. Harper?--is he likely to betray me?\"    \"No, no, no, Massa Harry,\" cried the negro, shaking his gray head  confidently; \"I been to see--Massa Harper on he knee--pray to God--no  gemman who pray to God tell of good son, come to see old fader--Skinner  do that--no Christian!\"    This poor opinion of the Skinners was not confined to Mr. Caesar  Thompson, as he called himself--but Caesar Wharton, as he was styled by  the little world to which he was known. The convenience, and perhaps the  necessities, of the leaders of the American arms, in the neighborhood of  New York, had induced them to employ certain subordinate agents, of  extremely irregular habits, in executing their lesser plans of annoying  the enemy. It was not a moment for fastidious inquiries into abuses of  any description, and oppression and injustice were the natural  consequences of the possession of a military power that was uncurbed by  the restraints of civil authority. In time, a distinct order of the  community was formed, whose sole occupation appears to have been that of  relieving their fellow citizens from any little excess of temporal  prosperity they might be thought to enjoy, under the pretense of  patriotism and the love of liberty.    Occasionally, the aid of military authority was not wanting, in  enforcing these arbitrary distributions of worldly goods; and a petty  holder of a commission in the state militia was to be seen giving the  sanction of something like legality to acts of the most unlicensed  robbery, and, not infrequently, of bloodshed.    On the part of the British, the stimulus of loyalty was by no means  suffered to sleep, where so fruitful a field offered on which it might  be expended. But their freebooters were enrolled, and their efforts more  systematized. Long experience had taught their leaders the efficacy of  concentrated force; and, unless tradition does great injustice to their  exploits, the result did no little credit to their foresight. The  corps--we presume, from their known affection to that useful animal--had  received the quaint appellation of \"Cowboys.\"    Caesar was, however, far too loyal to associate men who held the  commission of George III, with the irregular warriors, whose excesses  he had so often witnessed, and from whose rapacity, neither his poverty  nor his bondage had suffered even him to escape uninjured. The Cowboys,  therefore, did not receive their proper portion of the black's censure,  when he said, no Christian, nothing but a \"Skinner,\" could betray a  pious child, while honoring his father with a visit so full of peril.          CHAPTER II           And many a halcyon day he lived to see       Unbroken, but by one misfortune dire,       When fate had reft his mutual heart--but she       Was gone-and Gertrude climbed a widowed father's knee.                                       --Gertrude of Wyoming.    The father of Mr. Wharton was a native of England, and of a family whose  parliamentary interest had enabled them to provide for a younger son in  the colony of New York. The young man, like hundreds of others in this  situation, had settled permanently in the country. He married; and the  sole issue of his connection had been sent early in life to receive the  benefits of the English schools. After taking his degrees at one of the  universities of the mother country, the youth had been suffered to  acquire a knowledge of life with the advantages of European society. But  the death of his father recalled him, after passing two years in this  manner, to the possession of an honorable name, and a very ample estate.    It was much the fashion of that day to place the youth of certain  families in the army and navy of England, as the regular stepping-stones  to preferment. Most of the higher offices in the colonies were filled by  men who had made arms their profession; and it was even no uncommon  sight to see a veteran warrior laying aside the sword to assume the  ermine on the benches of the highest judicial authority.    In conformity with this system, the senior Mr. Wharton had intended his  son for a soldier; but a natural imbecility of character in his child  interfered with his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9882"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

Till then,  with regular strokes and a sweeping sound, the sweet and flowery grass  falls before them, revealing at almost every step, nests of young birds,  mice in their cozy domes, and the mossy cells of the humble bee  streaming with liquid honey; anon, troops of haymakers are abroad,  tossing the green swaths wide to the sun. It is one of Nature's  festivities, endeared by a thousand pleasant memories and habits of the  olden days, and not a soul can resist it.    There is a sound of tinkling teams and of wagons rolling along lanes and  fields the whole country over, aye, even at midnight, till at length the  fragrant ricks rise in the farmyard, and the pale smooth-shaven fields  are left in solitary beauty.    They who know little about it may deem the strong _penchant_ of our  poets, and of ourselves, for rural pleasures, mere romance and poetic  illusion; but if poetic beauty alone were concerned, we must still  admire _harvest-time_ in the country. The whole land is then an Arcadia,  full of simple, healthful, and rejoicing spirits. Overgrown towns and  manufactories may have changed for the worse, the spirit and feelings of  our population; in them, \"evil communications may have corrupted good  manners;\" but in the country at large, there never was a more  simple-minded, healthful-hearted, and happy race of people than our  present British peasantry. They have cast off, it is true, many of their  ancestors' games and merrymakings, but they have in no degree lost their  soul of mirth and happiness. This is never more conspicuous than in  _harvest-time_.    With the exception of a casual song of the lark in a fresh morning, of  the blackbird and thrush at sunset, or the monotonous wail of the  yellow-hammer, the silence of birds is now complete; even the lesser  reed-sparrow, which may very properly be called the _English mock-bird_,  and which kept up a perpetual clatter with the notes of the sparrow, the  swallow, the white-throat, &c. in every hedge-bottom, day and night,  has ceased.    Boys will now be seen in the evening twilight with match, gunpowder,  &c., and green boughs for self-defence, busy in storming the paper-built  castles of _wasps_, the larvae of which furnish anglers with store of  excellent baits. Spring-flowers have given place to a very different  class. Climbing plants mantle and festoon every hedge. The wild hop, the  brione, the clematis or traveller's joy, the large white convolvulus,  whose bold yet delicate flowers will display themselves to a very late  period of the year--vetches, and white and yellow ladies-bed-straw--  invest almost every bush with their varied beauty, and breathe on the  passer-by their faint summer sweetness. The _campanula rotundifolia_,  the hare-bell of poets, and the blue-bell of botanists, arrests the eye  on every dry bank, rock, and wayside, with its beautiful cerulean bells.  There too we behold wild scabiouses, mallows, the woody nightshade,  wood-betony, and centaury; the red and white-striped convolvulus also  throws its flowers under your feet; corn fields glow with whole armies  of scarlet poppies, cockle, and the rich azure plumes of  viper's-bugloss; even _thistles_, the curse of Cain, diffuse a glow of  beauty over wastes and barren places. Some species, particularly the  musk thistles, are really noble plants, wearing their formidable arms,  their silken vest, and their gorgeous crimson tufts of fragrant flowers  issuing from a coronal of interwoven down and spines, with a grace which  casts far into the shade many a favourite of the garden.    But whoever would taste all the sweetness of July, let him go, in  pleasant company, if possible, into heaths and woods; it is there, in  her uncultured haunts, that summer now holds her court. The stern  castle, the lowly convent, the deer and the forester have vanished  thence many ages; yet nature still casts round the forest-lodge, the  gnarled oak and lovely mere, the same charms as ever. The most hot and  sandy tracts, which we might naturally imagine would now be parched up,  are in full glory. The _erica tetralix_, or bell-heath, the most  beautiful of our indigenous species, is now in bloom, and has converted  the brown bosom of the waste into one wide sea of crimson; the air is  charged with its honied odour. The dry, elastic turf glows, not only  with its flowers, but with those of the wild thyme, the clear blue  milkwort, the yellow asphodel, and that curious plant the _sundew_, with  its drops of inexhaustible liquor sparkling in the fiercest sun like  diamonds. There wave the cotton-rush, the tall fox-glove, and the taller  golden mullein. There creep the various species of heath-berries,  cranberries, bilberries, &c., furnishing the poor with a source of  profit, and the rich of luxury. What a pleasure it is to throw ourselves  down beneath the verdant screen of the beautiful fern, or the shade of a  venerable oak, in such a scene, and listen to the summer sounds of bees,  grasshoppers, and ten thousand other insects, mingled with the more  remote and solitary cries of the pewit and the curlew! Then, to think of  the coach-horse, urged on his sultry stage, or the plough-boy and his  teem, plunging in the depths of a burning fallow, or of our ancestors,  in times of national famine, plucking up the wild fern-roots for bread,  and what an enhancement of our own luxurious ease![3]    But woods, the depths of woods, are the most delicious retreats during  the fiery noons of July. The great azure campanulas, or Canterbury  bells, are there in bloom, and, in chalk or limestone districts, there  are also now to be found those curiosities, the _bee_ and _fly  orchises_. The soul of John Evelyn well might envy us a wood lounge at  this period.    _Time's Telescope._        [3] It is a fact not known to every juvenile lover of nature,      that a transverse section of a fern-root presents a miniature      picture of an _oak tree_ which no painter could rival.           *       *       *       *       *        ASTRONOMICAL OCCURENCES  FOR JULY, 1827.           *       *       *       *       *    (_For the Mirror._)      The sun is in apogee, or at his greatest distance from the earth on the  2nd, in 10 deg. _Cancer_; he enters _Leo_ on the 23rd, at 5h. 13m.  afternoon; he is in conjunction with the planet Saturn on the 2nd at  11h. 30m. morning, in 9 deg. _Cancer_, and with Mars on the 12th at 1h.  45m. afternoon, being advanced 10 deg. further in the eliptic.    Venus and Saturn are also in conjunction on the 26th at 3 h. afternoon,  in 13 deg. _Cancer_.    Mercury will again be visible for a short time about the middle of the  month a little after the sun has set, arriving on the 16th at his  greatest eastern elongation, or apparent distance from the centre of the  system, as seen from the earth in 20 deg. _Leo_; and in aphelio, or that  point of his orbit most distant from the sun, on the 22nd; he becomes  stationary on the 29th.    There is only one visible eclipse of Jupiter's first satellite this  month--on the 5th, at 10h. 21m. evening.    The Georgium Sidus, or Herschel, comes to an opposition with the sun on  the 19th, at 6h. 15m. evening; he is then nearest the earth, and  consequently in the most favourable position for observation; he began  retrograding on the 1st of May in 28 deg. 12m. of _Capricornus_; he  rises on the 1st, at 9h. 11m. evening, culminating at 1h. 16m., and  setting at 5h. 21m. morning, pursuing the course of the sun on the 17th  of January; he moves only 13m. of a deg. in the course of the month,  rising 2 h. earlier on the 31st.    This planet, called also Uranus, was discovered by Herschel on the 13th  of March, 1781. It is the most distant orb in our system yet known. From  certain inequalities on the motion of Jupiter and Saturn, the existence  of a planet of considerable size beyond the orbit of either had been  before suspected; its apparent magnitude, as seen from the earth, is  about 3-1/2 sec., or of the size of a star of the sixth magnitude, and  as from its distance from the sun, it shines but with a pale light, it  cannot often be distinguished with the naked eye. Its diameter is about  4-1/2 times that of the earth, and completes its revolution in something  less than 83-1/2 years. The want of light in this planet, on account of  its great distance from the sun, is supplied by six moons, which revolve  round their primary in different periods. There is a remarkable  peculiarity attached to their orbits, which are nearly perpendicular to  the plane of the ecliptic, and they revolve in them in a direction  contrary to the order of the signs.    \"Moore,\" in an old almanack, speaking on the difference of light and  heat enjoyed by the inhabitants of _Saturn_, and the _earth_, says,--        \"From hence how large, how strong the sun's bright ball,      But seen from thence, how languid and how small,      When the keen north with all its fury blows,      Congeals the floods and forms the fleecy snows:      'Tis heat intense, to what can there be known,      Warmer our poles than in its burning (!) zone;      One moment's cold like their's would pierce the bone,      Freeze the heart's blood, and turn us all to stone.\"    Were Saturn thus situated, what would the inhabitants of Herschel feel,  whose distance is still further?--pursuing this train of reasoning, the  heat in the planet Mercury would be seven times greater than on our  globe, and were the earth in the same position, all the water on its  surface would boil, and soon be turned into vapour, but as the degree of  sensible heat in any planet _does not_ depend altogether on its nearness  to the sun, the temperature of these planets may be as mild as that of  the most genial climate of our globe.    The theory of the sun being a body of fire having been long since  exploded, and heat being found to"]]]
