[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6818"],[0,"The Arctic Prairies : a Canoe-Journey of 2,000 Miles in Search of the Caribou; (#5)"],[1," One  of the police boys seized a gun and with a charge of No. 6 killed  the Lynx. Poor thing, it was in a starving condition, as indeed  are most meat-eaters this year in the north. Though it was fully  grown, it weighed but 15 pounds.    In its stomach was part of a sparrow (white-throat?) and a piece  of rawhide an inch wide and 4 feet long, evidently a portion of a  dog-harness picked up somewhere along the river. I wonder what he  did with the bells.    That night we decided to drift, leaving one man on guard. Next day,  as we neared Lake Athabaska, the shores got lower, and the spruce  disappeared, giving way to dense thickets of low willow. Here  the long expected steamer, Graham, passed, going upstream. We now  began to get occasional glimpses of Lake Athabaska across uncertain  marshes and sand bars. It was very necessary to make Fort Chipewyan  while there was a calm, so we pushed on. After four hours' groping  among blind channels and mud banks, we reached the lake at  midnight--though of course there was no night, but a sort of gloaming  even at the darkest--and it took us four hours' hard rowing to  cover the ten miles that separated us from Chipewyan.    It sounds very easy and commonplace when one says \"hard rowing,\"  but it takes on more significance when one is reminded that those  oars were 18 feet long, 5 inches through, and weighed about 20 pounds  each; the boat was 30 feet long, a demasted schooner indeed, and  rowing her through shallow muddy water, where the ground suction  was excessive, made labour so heavy that 15 minute spells were all  any one could do. We formed four relays, and all worked in turn  all night through, arriving at Chipewyan. 4 A.M., blistered, sore,  and completely tired out.    Fort Chipewyan (pronounced Chip-we-yan') was Billy Loutit's home,  and here we met his father, mother, and numerous as well as interesting  sisters. Meanwhile I called at the Roman Catholic Mission, under  Bishop Gruard, and the rival establishment, under Reverend Roberts,  good men all, and devoted to the cause, but loving not each other.  The Hudson's Bay Company, however, was here, as everywhere in the  north, the really important thing.    There was a long stretch of dead water before we could resume our  downward drift, and, worse than that, there was such a flood on the  Peace River that it was backing the Athabaska, that is, the tide  of the latter was reversed on the Rocher River, which extends  twenty-five miles between here and Peace mouth. To meet this, I  hired Colin Fraser's steamer. We left Chipewyan at 6.15; at 11.15  camped below the Peace on Great Slave River, and bade farewell to  the steamer.    The reader may well be puzzled by these numerous names; the fact  is the Mackenzie, the Slave, the Peace, the Rocher, and the Unchaga  are all one and the same river, but, unfortunately, the early  explorers thought proper to give it a new name each time it did  something, such as expand into a lake. By rights it should be the  Unchaga or Unjiza, from the Rockies to the Arctic, with the Athabaska  as its principal southern tributary.    The next day another Lynx was collected. In its stomach were  remains of a Redsquirrel, a Chipmunk, and a Bog-lemming. The last  was important as it made a new record.    The Athabaska is a great river, the Peace is a greater, and the  Slave, formed by their union, is worthy of its parents. Its placid  flood is here nearly a mile wide, and its banks are covered with  a great continuous forest of spruce trees of the largest size. How  far back this extends I do not know, but the natives say the best  timber is along the river.    More than once a Lynx was seen trotting by or staring at us from  the bank, but no other large animal.    On the night of June 7 we reached Smith Landing.          CHAPTER V    A CONFERENCE WITH THE CHIEFS        A few bands of Buffalo are said to exist in the country east of  Great Slave River. Among other matters, Major Jarvis had to report  on these, find out how many were left, and exactly where they were.  When he invited me to join his expedition, with these questions in  view, I needed no pressing.    Our first business was to get guides, and now our troubles began.    Through the traders we found four natives who knew the Buffalo  range--they were Kiya, Sousi, Kirma, and Peter Squirrel. However,  they seemed in no way desirous of guiding any one into that  country. They dodged and delayed and secured many postponements,  but the Royal Mounted Police and the Hudson's Bay Company are the  two mighty powers of the land, so, urged by an officer of each,  these worthies sullenly assembled to meet us in Sousi's cabin.    Sousi, by the way, is Chipewyan for Joseph, and this man's name  was Joseph Beaulieu. Other northern travellers have warned all that  came after them to beware of the tribe of Beaulieu, so we were on  guard.    Sullen silence greeted us as we entered; we could feel their  covert antagonism. Jarvis is one of those affable, good-tempered  individuals that most persons take for \"easy.\" In some ways he may  be so, but I soon realised that he was a keen judge of men and their  ways, and he whispered to me: \"They mean to block us if possible.\"  Sousi understood French and had some English, but the others professed  ignorance of everything but Chipewyan. So it was necessary to call  in an interpreter. How admirably he served us may be judged from  the following sample secured later.    Q. Are the Buffalo near?    A. Wah-hay-was-ki busquow Kai-ah taw nip-ee-wat-chow-es-kee  nee-moy-ah. Kee-as-o-win sugee-meesh i-mush-wa mus-tat-e-muck  ne-mow-ah pe-muk-te-ok nemoy-ah dane-tay-tay-ah.    Interpreter. He say \"no.\"    Q. How long would it take to get them?    A. Ne-moy-ah mis-chay-to-ok Way-hay-o ay-ow-ok-iman-kah-mus-to-ok.  Mis-ta-hay cha-gowos-ki wah-hay-o musk-ee-see-seepi. Mas-kootch  e-goot-ah-i-ow mas-kootch ne-moy-ah muk-eboy sak-te-muk mas-kootch  gahk-sin-now ne-moy-ah gehk-kee-win-tay dam-foole-Inglis.    Interpreter. He say \"don't know.\"    Q. Can you go with us as guide?    A. Kee-ya-wah-lee nas-bah a-lash-tay wah-lee-lee lan-day. (Answer  literally) \"Yes, I could go if I could leave the transport.\"    Interpreter's answer, \"Mebby.\"    After a couple of hours of this bootless sort of thing we had  made no headway toward getting a guide, nor could we get definite  information about the Buffaloes or the Wolves. Finally the meeting  suffered a sort of natural disintegration.    Next day we tried again, but again there were technical difficulties,  grown up like mushrooms over night.    Kiya could not go or lend his horses, because it was mostly  Squirrel's country, and he was afraid Squirrel would not like it.  Squirrel could not go because it would be indelicate of him to  butt in after negotiations had been opened with Kiya. Kirma was not  well. Sousi could not go because his wife was sick, and it preyed  on his mind so that he dare not trust himself away from the  settlement; at least, not without much medicine to fortify him  against rheumatism, home-sickness, and sadness.    Next day Kiya sent word that he had business of great moment, and  could not meet us, but would see that early in the morning Squirrel  was notified to come and do whatever we wished. In the morning Squirrel  also had disappeared, leaving word that he had quite overlooked a  most important engagement to \"portage some flour across the rapids,\"  not that he loved the tump line, but he had \"promised,\" and to keep  his word was very precious to him.    Jarvis and I talked it over and reviewed the information we had.  At Ottawa it was reported that the Wolves were killing the calves,  so the Buffalo did not increase. At Winnipeg the Wolves were so  bad that they killed yearlings; at Edmonton the cows were not safe.    At Chipewyan the Wolves, reinforced by large bands from the Barren  Grounds, were killing the young Buffalo, and later the cows and  young bulls. At Smith's Landing the Wolves had even tackled an old  bull whose head was found with the large bones. Horses and dogs  were now being devoured. Terrible battles were taking place between  the dark Wolves of Peace River and the White Wolves of the Barrens  for possession of the Buffalo grounds. Of course the Buffalo were  disappearing; about a hundred were all that were left.    But no one ever sees any of these terrible Wolves, the few men who  know that country have plenty of pemmican, that is neither Moose  nor Caribou, and the Major briefly summed up the situation: \"The  Wolves are indeed playing havoc with the Buffalo, and the ravenous  leaders of the pack are called Sousi, Kiya, Kirma, and Squirrel.\"    Now of all the four, Sousi, being a Beaulieu and a half-breed, had  the worst reputation, but of all the four he was the only one that  had admitted a possibility of guiding us, and was to be found on the  fifth morning. So his views were met, a substitute found to watch  his fishing nets, groceries to keep his wife from pining during his  absence, a present for himself, the regular rate of wages doubled,  his horses hired, his rheumatism, home-sickness, and sadness provided  against, a present of tobacco, some more presents, a promise of  reward for every Buffalo shown, then another present, and we set  out.          CHAPTER VI    OUT WITH SOUSI BEAULIEU        It's a, fine thing to get started, however late in the day, and  though it was 3.20 P. M. before everything was ready, we gladly  set out--Sousi, Major Jarvis, and myself--all mounted, the native  leading a packhorse with provisions.    And now we had a chance to study our guide. A man's real history  begins, of course, about twenty years before he is born. In  the middle of the last century was a notorious old ruffian named  Beaulieu. Montreal was too slow for him, so he invaded the north-west  with a chosen crew of congenial spirits. His history can be got from  any old resident of the north-west. I should not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6840"],[0,"Queen Lucia (#5)"],[1,"could give her instruction? A wonderful answer came to that,  for two days afterwards her maid came to her and said that an Indian  gentleman would like to see her. He was ushered in, and with a profound  obeisance said: \"Beloved lady, I am the teacher you asked for; I am your  Guru. Peace be to this house! Om!\"    Mrs Lucas had by this time got her view of Mrs Quantock's letter into  perfect focus, and she read on without missing a word. \"Is it not  wonderful, dearest Lucia,\" it ran, \"that my desire for light should  have been so instantly answered? And yet my Guru tells me that it  always happens so. I was sent to him, and he was sent to me, just like  that! He had been expecting some call when my letter asking for  guidance came, and he started at once because he knew he was sent.  Fancy! I don't even know his name, and his religion forbids him to tell  it me. He is just my Guru, my guide, and he is going to be with me as  long as he knows I need him to show me the True Path. He has the spare  bedroom and the little room adjoining where he meditates and does  Postures and Pranyama which is breathing. If you persevere in them  under instruction, you have perfect health and youth, and my cold is  gone already. He is a Brahmin of the very highest caste, indeed caste  means nothing to him any longer, just as a Baronet and an Honourable  must seem about the same thing to the King. He comes from Benares where  he used to meditate all day by the Ganges, and I can see for myself  that he is a person of the most extraordinary sanctity. But he can  meditate just as well in my little room, for he says he was never in  any house that had such a wonderful atmosphere. He has no money at all  which is so beautiful of him, and looked so pained and disappointed  when I asked him if I might not give him some. He doesn't even know how  he got here from London; he doesn't think he came by train, so perhaps  he was wafted here in some astral manner. He looked so bewildered too  when I said the word 'money,' and evidently he had to think what it  was, because it is so long since it has meant anything to him. So if he  wants anything, I have told him to go into any shop and ask that it  shall be put down to me. He has often been without food or sleep for  days together when he is meditating. Just think!    \"Shall I bring him to see you, or will you come here? He wants to meet  you, because he feels you have a beautiful soul and may help him in  that way, as well as his helping you. I am helping him too he says,  which seems more wonderful than I can believe. Send me a line as soon  as you get back. _Tante salute_!                         \"Your own,                             \"DAISY.\"    The voluminous sheets had taken long in reading and Mrs Lucas folded  them up slowly and thoughtfully. She felt that she had to make a swift  decision that called into play all her mental powers. On the one hand  it was \"up to her\" to return a frigid reply, conveying, without making  any bones about the matter, that she had no interest in nameless Gurus  who might or might not be Brahmins from Benares and presented  themselves at Daisy's doors in a penniless condition without clear  knowledge whether they had come by train or not. In favour of such  prudent measures was the truly Athenian character of Daisy's mind, for  she was always enquiring into \"some new thing,\" which was the secret of  life when first discovered, and got speedily relegated to the  dust-heap. But against such a course was the undoubted fact that Daisy  did occasionally get hold of somebody who subsequently proved to be of  interest, and Lucia would never forget to her dying day the advent in  Riseholme of a little Welsh attorney, in whom Daisy had discovered a  wonderful mentality. Lucia had refused to extend her queenly  hospitality to him, or to recognise his existence in any way during the  fortnight when he stayed with Daisy, and she was naturally very much  annoyed to find him in a prominent position in the Government not many  years later. Indeed she had snubbed him so markedly on his first  appearance at Riseholme that he had refused on subsequent visits to  come to her house at all, though he several times visited Mrs Quantock  again, and told her all sorts of political secrets (so she said) which  she would not divulge for anything in the world. There must never be a  repetition of so fatal an error.    Another thing inclined the wavering balance. She distinctly wanted some  fresh element at her court, that should make Riseholme know that she  was in residence again. August would soon be here with its languors and  absence of stimulus, when it was really rather difficult in the drowsy  windless weather to keep the flag of culture flying strongly from her  own palace. The Guru had already said that he felt sure she had a  beautiful soul, and-- The outline of the scheme flashed upon her. She  would have Yoga evenings in the hot August weather, at which, as the  heat of the day abated, graceful groups should assemble among the  mottos in the garden and listen to high talk on spiritual subjects.  They would adjourn to delicious moonlit suppers in the pergola, or if  the moon was indisposed--she could not be expected to regulate the  affairs of the moon as well as of Riseholme--there would be dim seances  and sandwiches in the smoking-parlour. The humorous furniture should be  put in cupboards, and as they drifted towards the front hall again,  when the clocks struck an unexpectedly late hour, little whispered  colloquies of \"How wonderful he was tonight\" would be heard, and there  would be faraway looks and sighs, and the notings down of the titles of  books that conducted the pilgrim on the Way. Perhaps as they softly  assembled for departure, a little music would be suggested to round off  the evening, and she saw herself putting down the soft pedal as people  rustled into their places, for the first movement of the \"Moonlight  Sonata.\" Then at the end there would be silence, and she would get up  with a sigh, and someone would say \"Lucia mia\"! and somebody else  \"Heavenly Music,\" and perhaps the Guru would say \"Beloved lady,\" as he  had _apparently_ said to poor Daisy Quantock. Flowers, music,  addresses from the Guru, soft partings, sense of refreshment.... With  the memory of the Welsh attorney in her mind, it seemed clearly wiser  to annex rather than to repudiate the Guru. She seized a pen and drew a  pile of postcards towards her, on the top of which was printed her name  and address.    \"Too wonderful,\" she wrote, \"pray bring him yourself to my little  garden-party on Friday. There will be only a few. Let me know if he  wants a quiet room ready for him.\"    All this had taken time, and she had but scribbled a dozen postcards to  friends bidding them come to her garden party on Friday, when tea was  announced. These invitations had the mystic word \"Hightum\" written at  the bottom left hand corner, which conveyed to the enlightened recipient  what sort of party it was to be, and denoted the standard of dress. For  one of Lucia's quaint ideas was to divide dresses into three classes,  \"Hightum,\" \"Tightum\" and \"Scrub.\" \"Hightum\" was your very best dress,  the smartest and newest of all, and when \"Hightum\" was written on a  card of invitation, it implied that the party was a very resplendent  one. \"Tightum\" similarly indicated a moderately smart party, \"Scrub\"  carried its own significance on the surface. These terms applied to  men's dress as well and as regards evening parties: a dinner party  \"Hightum\" would indicate a white tie and a tail coat; a dinner party  \"Tightum\" a black tie and a short coat, and a dinner \"Scrub\" would mean  morning clothes.    With tea was announced also the advent of Georgie Pillson who was her  gentleman-in-waiting when she was at home, and her watch-dog when she  was not. In order to save subsequent disappointment, it may be at once  stated that there never has been, was, or ever would be the smallest  approach to a flirtation between them. Neither of them, she with her  forty respectable years and he with his blameless forty-five years, had  ever flirted, with anybody at all. But it was one of the polite and  pleasant fictions of Riseholme that Georgie was passionately attached  to her and that it was for her sake that he had settled in Riseholme  now some seven years ago, and that for her sake he remained still  unmarried. She never, to do her justice, had affirmed anything of the  sort, but it is a fact that sometimes when Georgie's name came up in  conversation, her eyes wore that \"far-away\" look that only the  masterpieces of art could otherwise call up, and she would sigh and  murmur \"Dear Georgie\"! and change the subject, with the tact that  characterized her. In fact their mutual relations were among the most  Beautiful Things of Riseholme, and hardly less beautiful was Peppino's  attitude towards it all. That large hearted man trusted them both, and  his trust was perfectly justified. Georgie was in and out of the house  all day, chiefly in; and not only did scandal never rear its hissing  head, but it positively had not a head to hiss with, or a foot to stand  on. On his side again Georgie had never said that he was in love with  her (nor would it have been true if he had), but by his complete  silence on the subject coupled with his constancy he seemed to admit  the truth of this bloodless idyll. They talked and walked and read the  masterpieces of literature and played duets on the piano together.  Sometimes (for he was the more brilliant performer, though as he said  \"terribly lazy about practising,\" for which she scolded him) he would  gently slap the back of her hand, if she played a wrong note, and say  \"Naughty!\" And she would reply in baby language \"Me vewy sowwy! Oo  naughty too to hurt Lucia!\" That was the utmost extent of their carnal  familiarities, and with bright eyes fixed on the music they would break"]]]
