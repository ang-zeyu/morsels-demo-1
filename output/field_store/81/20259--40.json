Baree stared with popping  eyes, for if Wakayoo had weighed six hundred pounds, this gigantic  creature whose legs were so long that it seemed to be walking on stilts  weighed at least twice as much. A cow moose followed, and then a calf.    The calf seemed all legs. It was too much for Baree, and he shoved  himself farther and farther back under the rock until he lay wedged in  like a sardine in a box. And there he lay until morning.        CHAPTER 4    When Baree ventured forth from under his rock at the beginning of the  next day, he was a much older puppy than when he met Papayuchisew, the  young owl, in his path near the old windfall. If experience can be made  to take the place of age, he had aged a great deal in the last  forty-eight hours. In fact, he had passed almost out of puppyhood. He  awoke with a new and much broader conception of the world. It was a big  place. It was filled with many things, of which Kazan and Gray Wolf  were not the most important. The monsters he had seen on the moonlit  plot of sand had roused in him a new kind of caution, and the one  greatest instinct of beasts--the primal understanding that it is the  strong that prey upon the weak--was wakening swiftly in him. As yet he  quite naturally measured brute force and the menace of things by size  alone. Thus the bear was more terrible than Kazan, and the moose was  more terrible than the bear.    It was quite fortunate for Baree that this instinct did not go to the  limit in the beginning and make him understand that his own breed--the  wolf--was most feared of all the creatures, claw, hoof, and wing, of  the forests. Otherwise, like the small boy who thinks he can swim  before he has mastered a stroke, he might somewhere have jumped in  beyond his depth and had his head chewed off.    Very much alert, with the hair standing up along his spine, and a  little growl in his throat, Baree smelled of the big footprints made by  the bear and the moose. It was the bear scent that made him growl. He  followed the tracks to the edge of the creek. After that he resumed his  wandering, and also his hunt for food.    For two hours he did not find a crayfish. Then he came out of the green  timber into the edge of a burned-over country. Here everything was  black. The stumps of the trees stood up like huge charred canes. It was  a comparatively fresh \"burn\" of last autumn, and the ash was still soft  under Baree's feet. Straight through this black region ran the creek,  and over it hung a blue sky in which the sun was shining. It was quite  inviting to Baree. The fox, the wolf, the moose, and the caribou would  have turned back from the edge of this dead country. In another year it  would be good hunting ground, but now it was lifeless. Even the owls  would have found nothing to eat out there.    It was the blue sky and the sun and the softness of the earth under his  feet that lured Baree. It was pleasant to travel in after his painful  experiences in the forest. He continued to follow the stream, though  there was now little possibility of his finding anything to eat. The  water had become sluggish and dark. The channel was choked with charred  debris that had fallen into it when the forest had burned, and its  shores were soft and muddy. After a time, when Baree stopped and looked  about him, he could no longer see the green timber he had left. He was  alone in that desolate wilderness of charred tree corpses. It was as  still as death, too. Not the chirp of a bird broke the silence. In the  soft ash he could not hear the fall of his own feet. But he was not  frightened. There was the assurance of safety here.    If he could only find something to eat! That was the master thought  that possessed Baree. Instinct had not yet impressed upon him that this  which he saw all about him was starvation. He went on, seeking  hopefully for food. But at last, as the hours passed, hope began to die  in him. The sun sank westward. The sky grew less blue; a low wind began  to ride over the tops of the stubs, and now and then one of them fell  with a startling crash.    Baree could go no farther. An hour before dusk he lay down in the open,  weak and starved. The sun disappeared behind the forest. The moon  rolled up from the east. The sky glittered with stars--and all through  the night Baree lay as if dead. When morning came, he dragged himself  to the stream for a drink. With his last strength he went on. It was  the wolf urging him--compelling him to struggle to the last for his  life. The dog in him wanted to lie down and die. But the wolf spark in  him burned stronger. In the end it won. Half a mile farther on he came  again to the green timber.    In the forests as well as in the great cities fate plays its changing  and whimsical hand. If Baree had dragged himself into the timber half  an hour later he would have died. He was too far gone now to hunt for  crayfish or kill the weakest bird. But he came just as Sekoosew, the  ermine, the most bloodthirsty little pirate of all the wild--was making  a kill.    That was fully a hundred yards from where Baree lay stretched out under  a spruce, almost ready to give up the ghost. Sekoosew was a mighty  hunter of his kind. His body was about seven inches long, with a tiny  black-tipped tail appended to it, and he weighed perhaps five ounces. A  baby's fingers could have encircled him anywhere between his four legs,  and his little sharp-pointed head with its beady red eyes could slip  easily through a hole an inch in diameter. For several centuries  Sekoosew had helped to make history. It was he--when his pelt was worth  a hundred dollars in king's gold--that lured the first shipload of  gentlemen adventurers over the sea, with Prince Rupert at their head.  It was little Sekoosew who was responsible for the forming of the great  Hudson's Bay Company and the discovery of half a continent. For almost  three centuries he had fought his fight for existence with the trapper.  And now, though he was no longer worth his weight in yellow gold, he  was the cleverest, the fiercest, and the most merciless of all the  creatures that made up his world.    As Baree lay under his tree, Sekoosew was creeping on his prey. His  game was a big fat spruce hen standing under a thicket of black currant  bushes. The ear of no living thing could have heard Sekoosew's  movement. He was like a shadow--a gray dot here, a flash there, now  hidden behind a stick no larger than a man's wrist, appearing for a  moment, the next instant gone as completely as if he had not existed.  Thus he approached from fifty feet to within three feet of the spruce  hen. That was his favorite striking distance. Unerringly he launched  himself at the drowsy partridge's throat, and his needlelike teeth sank  through feathers into flesh.    Sekoosew was prepared for what happened then. It always happened when  he attacked Napanao, the wood partridge. Her wings were powerful, and  her first instinct when he struck was always that of flight. She rose  straight up now with a great thunder of wings. Sekoosew hung tight, his  teeth buried deep in her throat, and his tiny, sharp claws clinging to  her like hands. Through the air he whizzed with her, biting deeper and  deeper, until a hundred yards from where that terrible death thing had  fastened to her throat, Napanao crashed again to earth.    Where she fell was not ten feet from Baree. For a few moments he looked  at the struggling mass of feathers in a daze, not quite comprehending  that at last food was almost within his reach. Napanao was dying, but  she still struggled convulsively with her wings. Baree rose stealthily,  and after a moment in which he gathered all his remaining strength, he  made a rush for her. His teeth sank into her breast--and not until then  did he see Sekoosew. The ermine had raised his head from the death grip  at the partridge's throat, and his savage little red eyes glared for a  single instant into Baree's. Here was something too big to kill, and  with an angry squeak the ermine was gone. Napanao's wings relaxed, and  the throb went out of her body. She was dead. Baree hung on until he  was sure. Then he began his feast.    With murder in his heart, Sekoosew hovered near, whisking here and  there but never coming nearer than half a dozen feet from Baree. His  eyes were redder than ever. Now and then he emitted a sharp little  squeak of rage. Never had he been so angry in all his life! To have a  fat partridge stolen from him like this was an imposition he had never  suffered before. He wanted to dart in and fasten his teeth in Baree's  jugular. But he was too good a general to make the attempt, too good a  Napoleon to jump deliberately to his Waterloo. An owl he would have  fought. He might even have given battle to his big brother--and his  deadliest enemy--the mink. But in Baree he recognized the wolf breed,  and he vented his spite at a distance. After a time his good sense  returned, and he went off on another hunt.    Baree ate a third of the partridge, and the remaining two thirds he  cached very carefully at the foot of the big spruce. Then he hurried  down to the creek for a drink. The world looked very different to him  now. After all, one's capacity for happiness depends largely on how  deeply one has suffered. One's hard luck and misfortune form the  measuring stick for future good luck and fortune. So it was with Baree.  Forty-eight hours ago a full stomach would not have made him a tenth  part as happy as he was now. Then his greatest longing was for his  mother. Since then a still greater yearning had come into his life--for  food. In a way it was fortunate for him that he had almost died of  exhaustion and starvation, for his experience had helped to make a man  of him--or a wolf dog, just as you are of a mind to put it. He would  miss his mother for a long time. But he would never miss her again as  he had missed her yesterday"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47519"],[0,"President Heber C. Kimball's Journal (#5)"],[1,"out an appointment for me to preach  in his chapel the next Sunday. The following is a copy of the letter:    \"_Sir_:--You are expected to be here next Saturday. You are given  out to preach in the forenoon, afternoon and evening. Although we  be strangers to one another, yet I hope we are not strangers to our  blessed Redeemer, else I would not have given out for you to preach;  our chapel is but little and the congregation but few--yet if one soul  be converted, it is of more value than the whole world.    I remain in haste,    JOHN RICHARDS.\"    Agreeable to the kind invitation, I made preparation to visit that  place, and took coach on Saturday afternoon at Preston and arrived at  his house a little before dark.    On my entering, he arose and said, \"I understand you are the minister  lately from America!\"    I told him I was, whereupon he bade me welcome to his house, and seemed  to rejoice at my arrival.    After receiving refreshment at his hospitable board, we commenced a  conversation which lasted till a late hour, which appeared satisfactory  to the whole family.    The next morning I accompanied the reverend gentleman to his chapel,  and at the hour appointed commenced to preach to a crowded congregation  on the principles of salvation. I likewise preached in the afternoon  and evening, and my hearers seemed to manifest great interest in the  things which I laid before them. Nearly the whole congregation shed  tears of joy.    After I had concluded the services of the day, Mr. Richards gave  out another appointment for me to preach on Monday evening, which I  attended to. I likewise, by request of the congregation, preached on  Wednesday evening.    A number now began to believe the doctrines I advanced, and on  Thursday, six individuals, all members of Mr. Richards' church, came  forward for baptism.    Mr. Richards now, seeing the effect which my preaching produced, and  fearing lest he should lose all his members and likewise the salary  which was allowed him for preaching, told me that he must close the  doors of his chapel against me; but at the same time his behavior was  kind, and to his praise be it spoken, treated me with the greatest  hospitality.    I then began to preach in private houses, which were opened in that  neighborhood, and I ceased not to declare to all who came to hear, both  by night and by day, the glorious tidings of salvation, and that God  had again restored the ordinances as at the first, and counselors as at  the beginning.    Notwithstanding Mr. Richards closed the door of his meeting house  against me, he frequently came to hear me preach.    His daughter felt very sorrowful on account of her father not allowing  me to preach any more in his place of worship, and wept much; but I  told her not to fear, for I believed that God would soften his heart  and cause him to open his chapel for me to preach in again.    During this time I was principally entertained at his house. The next  Sunday I went along with him to his meeting, feeling a desire to hear  him preach. After he had finished his discourse, I was surprised to  hear him give out another appointment for me to preach in his chapel. I  accordingly preached in the afternoon and in the evening, and the word  seemed to be with power and the effect was great upon the people. The  next day I baptized two more, both members of Mr. Richards' church.    Mr. Richards had preached in that place upwards of thirty years, and  his members, as well as the inhabitants of the place and vicinity, were  very much attached to him. Yet, when the fullness of the gospel was  preached, although in much weakness, the people, notwithstanding their  attachment and regard for their venerable pastor, being convinced of  their duty, came forward and followed the footsteps of the Savior by  being buried in the likeness of His death.    After laboring for some time in this neighborhood, I was warned by  the Spirit to return to Preston, and there found that I was anxiously  expected by the brethren. They had received letters from Brothers  Richards and Russell, which gave an account of their proceedings  since they left Preston. Brother Goodson had also returned from  Bedfordshire, where he and Brother Richards had labored, and he gave  us a relation of their mission and success. He informed us that a  minister by the name of Matthews, brother-in-law to Elder Joseph  Fielding, received them very kindly and invited them to preach in his  church. The invitation was accepted, and they preached several times.  The result was that a number, among whom was Mr. Matthews and his  lady, believed their testimony and the things which they proclaimed.  Mr. Matthews had likewise borne testimony to his congregation of the  truth of these things and that they were the same principles as taught  by the apostles in ancient days, and beseeched his church to receive  the same. Several of his members went forward and obeyed the gospel,  and the time was appointed when he was to be baptized. However, in  the interval, something had caused him to stumble, and darkness had  pervaded his mind, insomuch so that at the time specified he did not  make his appearance, but went to a Baptist minister residing in that  place whom he prevailed upon to baptize him. From that time he began to  preach baptism for the remission of sins, and no longer walked with the  Saints. However, a great part of his members left him and obeyed the  truth, and in a letter which he wrote to his brother-in-law, the Rev.  James Fielding, he stated that his best members had left him.    It would probably be well to say a few words respecting Mr. Matthews  and Mr. Fielding, and their congregations, also their situation prior  to the time the gospel saluted their ears.    Mr. Matthews, who was a gentleman of considerable learning and talents,  had been a minister in the established church of England. Seeing a  great many things in that church contrary to truth and righteousness,  and moreover, believing that an overturn was at hand, and that the  church was destitute of the gifts of the Spirit, and was not expecting  the Savior to come to reign upon the earth, as had been spoken by the  prophets, he felt led to withdraw from that body.    He consequently gave up his prospects in that connection, and began to  preach the things which he verily believed; and was instrumental in  raising up quite a church in that place.    Mr. J. Fielding had been a minister in the Methodist church, but for  some of the causes mentioned, had withdrawn from that society, and  had collected a considerable church in Preston. Those gentlemen, with  their congregations, were, I believe, diligently contending for that  faith which was once delivered to the Saints at the time we arrived,  but afterwards rejected the truth. Yet, notwithstanding they did not  obey the gospel, the greater portion of their members received our  testimony, obeyed the ordinances we taught, and are now rejoicing in  the blessings of the new and everlasting covenant.        CHAPTER IV.    THE PEOPLE EAGER TO HEAR US--WE RENT \"THE COCK PIT\" TO PREACH  IN--OBTAIN LICENSES TO PREACH--CONTINUED SUCCESS.    About this time, Brother Snider returned from the north, where he had  been laboring in company with Brother Russell. He stated that they had  met with considerable opposition while preaching the gospel, but that  some had obeyed the truth and that others were investigating.    After spending a few days with us, he and Brother Goodson took their  leave of us and started for Liverpool about the first of October, on  their way to America, having business of importance which called them  home.    Although we were deprived of the labors of these brethren, the work  of the Lord continued to roll forth with great power. The news of our  arrival in that city, spread both far and wide, and calls from all  quarters, to go and preach, were constantly sounding in our ears. We  labored both night and day, that we might satisfy the people, who  manifested such a desire for the truth as I never saw before.    We had to speak in small houses, to very large congregations, or else,  to large assemblies in the open air; consequently, our lungs were very  sore and our bodies considerably worn down with fatigue.    Soon after this, we obtained a large and commodious place to preach  in, called \"The Cock Pit,\" which had formerly been used by the people  to witness cocks fight and kill one another, and where hundreds of  spectators had shouted in honor of the barbarous sport which was once  the pride of Britains. And now, instead of the huzzas of the wicked and  profane, the gospel of Christ and the voice of praise and thanksgiving  was heard there. The building had also been used for a temperance hall.    We had to pay seven shillings sterling per week for the use of it, and  two shillings per week for the lighting, it being beautifully lit up  with gas. It is situated in the center of the town, and about twenty  rods from the \"old church,\" probably the oldest in Lancashire. This  church has twelve bells which are rung at every service, the noise of  which was so great that we were unable to proceed in our services until  they had done ringing them.    Our meeting was once disturbed by some ministers belonging to the  Methodist church; however we got our place licensed and two gentlemen,  who were constables, proffered their services to keep the peace and  protect us from any further disturbances, which they continued to do,  as long as we stayed in that land.    The effect of the gospel of Jesus Christ now began to be apparent, not  only in the hearts of believers, but likewise in the conduct of those  who rejected it and many began to threaten us with prosecution for  preaching without having a license from the authorities of the nation.    This idea of obtaining a license from the secular authorities was  somewhat novel to us, but after consulting our friends,"]]]
