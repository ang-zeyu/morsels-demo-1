When you lost  your famous Belt the greater part of your own power was gone from you.  Against Ozma you and your Nomes would have no show at all.\"    Roquat's eyes flashed angrily.    \"Then away you go to the slicing machine!\" he cried.    \"Not yet,\" said the General, filling his pipe from the King's private  tobacco pouch.    \"What do you propose to do?\" asked the monarch.    \"I propose to obtain the power we need,\" answered Guph.  \"There are a  good many evil creatures who have magic powers sufficient to destroy  and conquer the Land of Oz.  We will get them on our side, band them  all together, and then take Ozma and her people by surprise.  It's all  very simple and easy when you know how.  Alone, we should be helpless  to injure the Ruler of Oz, but with the aid of the evil powers we can  summon we shall easily succeed.\"    King Roquat was delighted with this idea, for he realized how clever it  was.    \"Surely, Guph, you are the greatest General I have ever had!\" he  exclaimed, his eyes sparkling with joy.  \"You must go at once and make  arrangements with the evil powers to assist us, and meantime I'll begin  to dig the tunnel.\"    \"I thought you'd agree with me, Roquat,\" replied the new General.  \"I'll start this very afternoon to visit the Chief of the Whimsies.\"        5.  How Dorothy Became a Princess    When the people of the Emerald City heard that Dorothy had returned to  them every one was eager to see her, for the little girl was a general  favorite in the Land of Oz.  From time to time some of the folk from  the great outside world had found their way into this fairyland, but  all except one had been companions of Dorothy and had turned out to be  very agreeable people.  The exception I speak of was the wonderful  Wizard of Oz, a sleight-of-hand performer from Omaha who went up in a  balloon and was carried by a current of air to the Emerald City.  His  queer and puzzling tricks made the people of Oz believe him a great  wizard for a time, and he ruled over them until Dorothy arrived on her  first visit and showed the Wizard to be a mere humbug.  He was a  gentle, kind-hearted little man, and Dorothy grew to like him  afterward.  When, after an absence, the Wizard returned to the Land of  Oz, Ozma received him graciously and gave him a home in a part of the  palace.    In addition to the Wizard two other personages from the outside world  had been allowed to make their home in the Emerald City.  The first was  a quaint Shaggy Man, whom Ozma had made the Governor of the Royal  Storehouses, and the second a Yellow Hen named Billina, who had a fine  house in the gardens back of the palace, where she looked after a large  family.  Both these had been old comrades of Dorothy, so you see the  little girl was quite an important personage in Oz, and the people  thought she had brought them good luck, and loved her next best to  Ozma.  During her several visits this little girl had been the means of  destroying two wicked witches who oppressed the people, and she had  discovered a live scarecrow who was now one of the most popular  personages in all the fairy country.  With the Scarecrow's help she had  rescued Nick Chopper, a Tin Woodman, who had rusted in a lonely forest,  and the tin man was now the Emperor of the Country of the Winkies and  much beloved because of his kind heart.  No wonder the people thought  Dorothy had brought them good luck!  Yet, strange as it may seem, she  had accomplished all these wonders not because she was a fairy or had  any magical powers whatever, but because she was a simple, sweet and  true little girl who was honest to herself and to all whom she met.  In  this world in which we live simplicity and kindness are the only magic  wands that work wonders, and in the Land of Oz Dorothy found these same  qualities had won for her the love and admiration of the people.  Indeed, the little girl had made many warm friends in the fairy  country, and the only real grief the Ozites had ever experienced was  when Dorothy left them and returned to her Kansas home.    Now she received a joyful welcome, although no one except Ozma knew at  first that she had finally come to stay for good and all.    That evening Dorothy had many callers, and among them were such  important people as Tiktok, a machine man who thought and spoke and  moved by clockwork; her old companion the genial Shaggy Man; Jack  Pumpkinhead, whose body was brush-wood and whose head was a ripe  pumpkin with a face carved upon it; the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry  Tiger, two great beasts from the forest, who served Princess Ozma, and  Professor H. M. Wogglebug, T.E.  This wogglebug was a remarkable  creature.  He had once been a tiny little bug, crawling around in a  school-room, but he was discovered and highly magnified so that he  could be seen more plainly, and while in this magnified condition he  had escaped.  He had always remained big, and he dressed like a dandy  and was so full of knowledge and information (which are distinct  acquirements) that he had been made a Professor and the head of the  Royal College.    Dorothy had a nice visit with these old friends, and also talked a long  time with the Wizard, who was little and old and withered and dried up,  but as merry and active as a child.  Afterward, she went to see  Billina's fast-growing family of chicks.    Toto, Dorothy's little black dog, also met with a cordial reception.  Toto was an especial friend of the Shaggy Man, and he knew every one  else.  Being the only dog in the Land of Oz, he was highly respected by  the people, who believed animals entitled to every consideration if  they behaved themselves properly.    Dorothy had four lovely rooms in the palace, which were always reserved  for her use and were called \"Dorothy's rooms.\"  These consisted of a  beautiful sitting room, a dressing room, a dainty bedchamber and a big  marble bathroom.  And in these rooms were everything that heart could  desire, placed there with loving thoughtfulness by Ozma for her little  friend's use.  The royal dressmakers had the little girl's measure, so  they kept the closets in her dressing room filled with lovely dresses  of every description and suitable for every occasion.  No wonder  Dorothy had refrained from bringing with her her old calico and gingham  dresses!  Here everything that was dear to a little girl's heart was  supplied in profusion, and nothing so rich and beautiful could ever  have been found in the biggest department stores in America.  Of course  Dorothy enjoyed all these luxuries, and the only reason she had  heretofore preferred to live in Kansas was because her uncle and aunt  loved her and needed her with them.    Now, however, all was to be changed, and Dorothy was really more  delighted to know that her dear relatives were to share in her good  fortune and enjoy the delights of the Land of Oz, than she was to  possess such luxury for herself.    Next morning, at Ozma's request, Dorothy dressed herself in a pretty  sky-blue gown of rich silk, trimmed with real pearls.  The buckles of  her shoes were set with pearls, too, and more of these priceless gems  were on a lovely coronet which she wore upon her forehead.  \"For,\" said  her friend Ozma, \"from this time forth, my dear, you must assume your  rightful rank as a Princess of Oz, and being my chosen companion you  must dress in a way befitting the dignity of your position.\"    Dorothy agreed to this, although she knew that neither gowns nor jewels  could make her anything else than the simple, unaffected little girl  she had always been.    As soon as they had breakfasted--the girls eating together in Ozma's  pretty boudoir--the Ruler of Oz said:    \"Now, dear friend, we will use the Magic Belt to transport your uncle  and aunt from Kansas to the Emerald City.  But I think it would be  fitting, in receiving such distinguished guests, for us to sit in my  Throne Room.\"    \"Oh, they're not very 'stinguished, Ozma,\" said Dorothy.  \"They're just  plain people, like me.\"    \"Being your friends and relatives, Princess Dorothy, they are certainly  distinguished,\" replied the Ruler, with a smile.    \"They--they won't hardly know what to make of all your splendid  furniture and things,\" protested Dorothy, gravely.  \"It may scare 'em  to see your grand Throne Room, an' p'raps we'd better go into the back  yard, Ozma, where the cabbages grow an' the chickens are playing.  Then  it would seem more natural to Uncle Henry and Aunt Em.\"    \"No; they shall first see me in my Throne Room,\" replied Ozma,  decidedly; and when she spoke in that tone Dorothy knew it was not wise  to oppose her, for Ozma was accustomed to having her own way.    So together they went to the Throne Room, an immense domed chamber in  the center of the palace.  Here stood the royal throne, made of solid  gold and encrusted with enough precious stones to stock a dozen jewelry  stores in our country.    Ozma, who was wearing the Magic Belt, seated herself in the throne, and  Dorothy sat at her feet.  In the room were assembled many ladies and  gentlemen of the court, clothed in rich apparel and wearing fine  jewelry.  Two immense animals squatted, one on each side of the  throne--the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger.  In a balcony high up  in the dome an orchestra played sweet music, and beneath the dome two  electric fountains sent sprays of colored perfumed water shooting up  nearly as high as the arched ceiling.    \"Are you ready, Dorothy?\" asked the Ruler.    \"I am,\" replied Dorothy; \"but I don't know whether Aunt Em and Uncle  Henry are ready.\"    \"That won't matter,\" declared Ozma.  \"The old life can have very little  to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5173"],[0,"The Religion of the Samurai (#5)"],[1,"  by name, for the purpose of finding the final solution of a problem  which troubled him so much that he had become dissatisfied with  Confucianism, as it had no proper diet for his now spiritual hunger.  Thus Shang Kwang was far from being one of those half-hearted  visitors who knocked the door of Bodhidharma only for the sake of  curiosity.  But the silent master was cautious enough to try the  sincerity of a new visitor before admitting him to the Meditation  Hall.  According to a biography[FN#30] of his, Shang Kwang was not  allowed to enter the temple, and had to stand in the courtyard  covered deep with snow.  His firm resolution and earnest desire,  however, kept him standing continually on one spot for seven days and  nights with beads of the frozen drops of tears on his breast.  At  last he cut off his left arm with a sharp knife, and presented it  before the inflexible teacher to show his resolution to follow the  master even at the risk of his life.  Thereupon Bodhidharma admitted  him into the order as a disciple fully qualified to be instructed in  the highest doctrine of Mahayanism.      [FN#30]  King Teh Chwen Tang Luh (Kei-toku-den-to-roku), published by  Tao Yuen (Do-gen) A.D. 1004, gives a detailed narrative concerning  this incident as stated here, but earlier historians tell us a  different story about the mutilation of Shang Kwang's arm.  Compare  Suh Kas San Chwen (Zoku-ko-so-den) and Hwui Yuen (E-gen).      Our master's method of instruction was entirely different from that  of ordinary instructors of learning.  He would not explain any  problem to the learner, but simply help him to get enlightened by  putting him an abrupt but telling question.  Shang Kwang, for  instance, said to Bodhidharma, perhaps with a sigh: \"I have no peace  of mind.  Might I ask you, sir, to pacify my mind?\"  \"Bring out your  mind (that troubles you so much),\" replied the master, \"here before  me!  I shall pacify it.\"  \"It is impossible for me,\" said the  disciple, after a little consideration, \"to seek out my mind (that  troubles me so much).\"  \"Then,\" exclaimed Bodhidharma, \"I have  pacified your mind.\"  Hereon Shang Kwang was instantly Enlightened.  This event is worthy of our notice, because such a mode of  instruction was adopted by all Zen teachers after the first  patriarch, and it became one of the characteristics of Zen.        5. Bodhidharma's Disciples and the Transmission of the Law.[FN#31]      [FN#31]  For details, see Chwen Tang Luh and Den Ka Roku, by Kei Zan.   As for the life of Bodhidharma, Dr. B. Matsumoto's 'A Life of  Bodhidharma' may well be recommended to the reader.      Bodhidharma's labour of nine years in China resulted in the  initiation of a number of disciples, whom some time before his death  he addressed as follows: \"Now the time (of my departure from this  world) is at hand.  Say, one and all, how do you understand the Law?\"   Tao Fu (Do-fuku) said in response to this: \"The Law does not lie in  the letters (of the Scriptures), according to my view, nor is it  separated from them, but it works.\"  The Master said: \"Then you have  obtained my skin.\"  Next Tsung Chi (So-ji), a nun, replied: \"As  Ananda[FN#32] saw the kingdom of Aksobhya[FN#33] only once but not  twice, so I understand the Law\".  The master said: \"Then you have  attained to my flesh.\"  Then Tao Yuh (Do-iku) replied: \"The four  elements[FN#34] are unreal from the first, nor are the five  aggregates[FN#35] really existent.  All is emptiness according to my  view.\"  The master said: \"Then you have acquired my bone.\"  Lastly,  Hwui Ko (E-ka), which was the Buddhist name given by Bodhidharma, to  Shang Kwang, made a polite bow to the teacher and stood in his place  without a word.  \"You have attained to my marrow.\"  So saying,  Bodhidharma handed over the sacred Kachaya, [FN#36] which he had  brought from India to Hwui Ko, as a symbol of the transmission of the  Law, and created him the Second Patriarch.      [FN#32]  A favourite disciple of Shakya Muni, and the Third Patriarch  of Zen.    [FN#33]  The: name means I Immovable,' and represents the firmness of  thought.    [FN#34]  Earth, water, fire, and air.    [FN#35]  (1) Rupa, or form; (2) Vedana, or perception; (3) Samjnya,  or consciousness; (4) Karman (or Samskara), or action; (5) Vijnyana,  or knowledge.    [FN#36]  The clerical cloak, which is said to have been dark green.  It became an object of great veneration after the Sixth Patriarch,  who abolished the patriarchal system and did not hand the symbol over  to successors.        6. The Second and the Third Patriarchs.    After the death of the First Patriarch, in A.D. 528, Hwui Ko did his  best to propagate the new faith over sixty years.  On one occasion a  man suffering from some chronic disease called on him, and requested  him in earnest: \"Pray, Reverend Sir, be my confessor and grant me  absolution, for I suffer long from an incurable disease.\"  \"Bring out  your sin (if there be such a thing as sin),\" replied the Second  Patriarch, \"here before me.  I shall grant you absolution.\"  \"It is  impossible,\" said the man after a short consideration, \"to seek out  my sin.\"  \"Then,\" exclaimed the master, \"I have absolved you.  Henceforth live up to Buddha, Dharma, and Samgha.\"[FN#37]  \"I know,  your reverence,\" said the man, \"that you belong to Samgha; but what  are Buddha and Dharma?\"  \"Buddha is Mind itself.  Mind itself is  Dharma.  Buddha is identical with Dharma.  So is Samgha.\"  \"Then I  understand,\" replied the man, \"there is no such thing as sin within  my body nor without it, nor anywhere else.  Mind is beyond and above  sin.  It is no other than Buddha and Dharma.\"  Thereupon the Second  Patriarch saw the man was well qualified to be taught in the new  faith, and converted him, giving him the name of Sang Tsung (So-san).   After two years' instruction and discipline, he[FN#38] bestowed on  Sang Tsung the Kachaya handed down from Bodhidharma, and authorized  him as the Third Patriarch.  It is by Sang Tsung that the doctrine of  Zen was first reduced to writing by his composition of Sin Sin[FN#39]  Ming (Sin zin-mei, On Faith and Mind), a metrical exposition of the  faith.      [FN#37]  The so-called Three Treasures of the Buddha, the Law, and  the Order.    [FN#38]  The Second Patriarch died in A.D. 593--that is, sixty-five  years after the departure of the First Patriarch.    [FN#39]  A good many commentaries were written on the book, and it is  considered as one of the best books on Zen.        7. The Fourth Patriarch and the Emperor Tai Tsung (Tai-so).    The Third[FN#40] Patriarch was succeeded by Tao Sin (Do-shin), who  being initiated at the age of fourteen, was created the Fourth  Patriarch after nine years' study and discipline.  Tao Sin is said  never to have gone to bed for more than forty years of his  patriarchal career.[FN#41]  In A.D. 643 the Emperor Tai Tsung  (627-649), knowing of his virtues, sent him a special messenger,  requesting him to call on His Majesty at the palace.  But he declined  the invitation by a memorial, saying that be was too aged and infirm  to visit the august personage.  The Emperor, desirous of seeing the  reputed patriarch, sent for him thrice, but in vain.  Then the  enraged monarch ordered the messenger to behead the inflexible monk,  and bring the head before the throne, in case he should disobey the  order for the fourth time.  As Tao Sin was told of the order of the  Emperor, he stretched out his neck ready to be decapitated.  The  Emperor, learning from the messenger what had happened, admired all  the more the imperturbable patriarch, and bestowed rich gifts upon  him.  This example of his was followed by later Zen masters, who  would not condescend to bend their knees before temporal power, and  it became one of the characteristics of Zen monks that they would  never approach rulers and statesmen for the sake of worldly fame and  profit, which they set at naught.      [FN#40]  He died in A.D. 606, after his labour of thirteen years as  the teacher.    [FN#41]  He died in A.D. 651-that is, forty-five years after the  death of the Third Patriarch.        8. The Fifth and the Sixth Patriarchs.    Tao Sin transmitted the Law to Hung Jan (Ko-nin), who being educated  from infancy, distinguished himself as the Abbot of the Hwang Mei  Monastery at Ki Cheu.  The Fifth Patriarch, according to his  biographer, gathered about him seven hundred pupils, who came from  all quarters.  Of these seven hundred pupils the venerable Shang Sin  (Jin-shu) was most noted for his learning and virtues, and he might  have become the legitimate successor of Hung Jan, had not the Kachaya  of Bodhidharma been carried away by a poor farmer's son of Sin Cheu.  Hwui Nang, the Sixth Patriarch, seems to have been born a Zen  teacher.  The spiritual light of Buddha first flashed in his mind  when he happened to hear a monk reciting a sutra.  On questioning the  monk, be learned that the book was  Vajracchedika-prajnya-paramita-sutra,[FN#42] and that Hung Jan, the  Abbot of the Hwang Mei Monastery, was used to make his disciples  recite the book that it might help them in their spiritual  discipline.  Hereupon he made up his mind to practise Zen, and called  on Hung Jan at the Monastery.  \"Who are you,\" demanded the Fifth  Patriarch, \"and whence have you come?\"  \"I am a son of the farmer,\"  replied the man, \"of Sin Cheu in the South of Ta Yu Ling.\"  \"What has  brought you here?\" asked the master again.  \"I have no other purpose  than to attain to Buddhahood,\" answered the man.  \"O, you, people of  the South,\" exclaimed the patriarch, \"you are not endowed with the  nature of Buddha.\"  \"There may be some difference between the  Southern and the Northern people,\" objected the man, \"but how could  you distinguish one from the other as to the nature of Buddha?\"  The  teacher recognized a genius in the man, but he did not admit the  promising newcomer into the order, so Hwui Nang had to stay in "]]]
