They  collected in groups near the outer walls, asking questions and hazarding  guesses. A messenger from the king had arrived--the princess Bent-Anat  had been attacked by the Kolchytes--and a wag among the school-boys who  had got out, declared that Paaker, the king's pioneer, had been brought  into the temple by force to be made to learn to write better. As the  subject of the joke had formerly been a pupil of the House of Seti, and  many delectable stories of his errors in penmanship still survived in  the memory of the later generation of scholars, this information was  received with joyful applause; and it seemed to have a glimmer of  probability, in spite of the apparent contradiction that Paaker filled  one of the highest offices near the king, when a grave young priest  declared that he had seen the pioneer in the forecourt of the temple.    The lively discussion, the laughter and shouting of the boys at such an  unwonted hour, was not unobserved by the chief priest.    This remarkable prelate, Ameni the son of Nebket, a scion of an old  and noble family, was far more than merely the independent head of  the temple-brotherhood, among whom he was prominent for his power and  wisdom; for all the priesthood in the length and breadth of the land  acknowledged his supremacy, asked his advice in difficult cases, and  never resisted the decisions in spiritual matters which emanated from  the House of Seti--that is to say, from Ameni. He was the embodiment  of the priestly idea; and if at times he made heavy--nay  extraordinary--demands on individual fraternities, they were submitted  to, for it was known by experience that the indirect roads which he  ordered them to follow all converged on one goal, namely the exaltation  of the power and dignity of the hierarchy. The king appreciated this  remarkable man, and had long endeavored to attach him to the court, as  keeper of the royal seal; but Ameni was not to be induced to give up  his apparently modest position; for he contemned all outward show  and ostentatious titles; he ventured sometimes to oppose a decided  resistance to the measures of the Pharaoh,       [Pharaoh is the Hebrew form of the Egyptian Peraa--or Phrah. \"The     great house,\" \"sublime house,\" or \"high gate\" is the literal     meaning.]    and was not minded to give up his unlimited control of the priests for  the sake of a limited dominion over what seemed to him petty external  concerns, in the service of a king who was only too independent and hard  to influence.    He regularly arranged his mode and habits of life in an exceptional way.    Eight days out of ten he remained in the temple entrusted to his charge;  two he devoted to his family, who lived on the other bank of the Nile;  but he let no one, not even those nearest to him, know what portion of  the ten days he gave up to recreation. He required only four hours of  sleep. This he usually took in a dark room which no sound could reach,  and in the middle of the day; never at night, when the coolness and  quiet seemed to add to his powers of work, and when from time to time he  could give himself up to the study of the starry heavens.    All the ceremonials that his position required of him, the cleansing,  purification, shaving, and fasting he fulfilled with painful exactitude,  and the outer bespoke the inner man.    Ameni was entering on his fiftieth year; his figure was tall, and had  escaped altogether the stoutness to which at that age the Oriental is  liable. The shape of his smoothly-shaven head was symmetrical and of a  long oval; his forehead was neither broad nor high, but his profile was  unusually delicate, and his face striking; his lips were thin and dry,  and his large and piercing eyes, though neither fiery nor brilliant, and  usually cast down to the ground under his thick eyebrows, were raised  with a full, clear, dispassionate gaze when it was necessary to see and  to examine.    The poet of the House of Seti, the young Pentaur, who knew these eyes,  had celebrated them in song, and had likened them to a well-disciplined  army which the general allows to rest before and after the battle, so  that they may march in full strength to victory in the fight.    The refined deliberateness of his nature had in it much that was royal  as well as priestly; it was partly intrinsic and born with him, partly  the result of his own mental self-control. He had many enemies, but  calumny seldom dared to attack the high character of Amemi.    The high-priest looked up in astonishment, as the disturbance in the  court of the temple broke in on his studies.    The room in which he was sitting was spacious and cool; the lower part  of the walls was lined with earthenware tiles, the upper half plastered  and painted. But little was visible of the masterpieces of the artists  of the establishment, for almost everywhere they were concealed by  wooden closets and shelves, in which were papyrus-rolls and wax-tablets.  A large table, a couch covered with a panther's skin, a footstool in  front of it, and on it a crescent-shaped support for the head, made of  ivory,       [A support of crescent form on which the Egyptians rested their     heads. Many specimens were found in the catacombs, and similar     objects are still used in Nubia]    several seats, a stand with beakers and jugs, and another with flasks of  all sizes, saucers, and boxes, composed the furniture of the room,  which was lighted by three lamps, shaped like birds and filled with kiki  oil.--[Castor oil, which was used in the lamps.]    Ameni wore a fine pleated robe of snow-white linen, which reached to his  ankles, round his hips was a scarf adorned with fringes, which in front  formed an apron, with broad, stiffened ends which fell to his knees; a  wide belt of white and silver brocade confined the drapery of his robe.  Round his throat and far down on his bare breast hung a necklace more  than a span deep, composed of pearls and agates, and his upper arm was  covered with broad gold bracelets. He rose from the ebony seat with  lion's feet, on which he sat, and beckoned to a servant who squatted by  one of the walls of the sitting-room. He rose and without any word  of command from his master, he silently and carefully placed on the  high-priest's bare head a long and thick curled wig,       [Egyptians belonging to the higher classes wore wigs on their shaven     heads. Several are preserved in museums.]    and threw a leopard-skin, with its head and claws overlaid with  gold-leaf, over his shoulders. A second servant held a metal mirror  before Ameni, in which he cast a look as he settled the panther-skin and  head-gear.    A third servant was handing him the crosier, the insignia of his dignity  as a prelate, when a priest entered and announced the scribe Pentaur.    Ameni nodded, and the young priest who had talked with the princess  Bent-Anat at the temple-gate came into the room.    Pentaur knelt and kissed the hand of the prelate, who gave him his  blessing, and in a clear sweet voice, and rather formal and unfamiliar  language--as if he were reading rather than speaking, said:    \"Rise, my son; your visit will save me a walk at this untimely hour,  since you can inform me of what disturbs the disciples in our temple.  Speak.\"    \"Little of consequence has occurred, holy father,\" replied Pentaur. \"Nor  would I have disturbed thee at this hour, but that a quite unnecessary  tumult has been raised by the youths; and that the princess Bent-Anat  appeared in person to request the aid of a physician. The unusual hour  and the retinue that followed her--\"    \"Is the daughter of Pharaoh sick?\" asked the prelate.    \"No, father. She is well--even to wantonness, since--wishing to  prove the swiftness of her horses--she ran over the daughter of the  paraschites Pinem. Noble-hearted as she is, she herself carried the  sorely-wounded girl to her house.\"    \"She entered the dwelling of the unclean.\"    \"Thou hast said.\"    \"And she now asks to be purified?\"    \"I thought I might venture to absolve her, father, for the purest  humanity led her to the act, which was no doubt a breach of discipline,  but--\"    \"But,\" asked the high-priest in a grave voice and he raised his eyes  which he had hitherto on the ground.    \"But,\" said the young priest, and now his eyes fell, \"which can surely  be no crime. When Ra--[The Egyptian Sun-god.]--in his golden bark sails  across the heavens, his light falls as freely and as bountifully on the  hut of the despised poor as on the Palace of the Pharaohs; and shall the  tender human heart withhold its pure light--which is benevolence--from  the wretched, only because they are base?\"    \"It is the poet Pentaur that speaks,\" said the prelate, \"and not the  priest to whom the privilege was given to be initiated into the highest  grade of the sages, and whom I call my brother and my equal. I have no  advantage over you, young man, but perishable learning, which the past  has won for you as much as for me--nothing but certain perceptions and  experiences that offer nothing new, to the world, but teach us, indeed,  that it is our part to maintain all that is ancient in living efficacy  and practice. That which you promised a few weeks since, I many years  ago vowed to the Gods; to guard knowledge as the exclusive possession  of the initiated. Like fire, it serves those who know its uses to the  noblest ends, but in the hands of children--and the people, the mob,  can never ripen into manhood--it is a destroying brand, raging and  unextinguishable, devouring all around it, and destroying all that has  been built and beautified by the past. And how can we remain the Sages  and continue to develop and absorb all learning within the shelter  of our temples, not only without endangering the weak, but for their  benefit?

How long has that white ensign waved for guests in vain?\"    \"How long indeed?\" echoed the old slave of Rhodopis with a smile. \"So  long as the Fates graciously spare the life of my mistress, the old flag  is sure to waft as many guests hither as the house is able to contain.  Rhodopis is not at home now, but she must return shortly. The evening  being so fine, she determined on taking a pleasure-trip on the Nile with  her guests. They started at sunset, two hours ago, and the evening meal  is already prepared; they cannot remain away much longer. I pray you,  Phanes, to have patience and follow me into the house. Rhodopis would  not easily forgive me, if I allowed such valued guests to depart. You  stranger,\" he added, turning to the Spartan, \"I entreat most heartily  to remain; as friend of your friend you will be doubly welcome to my  mistress.\"    The two Greeks, following the servant, seated themselves in an arbor,  and Aristomachus, after gazing on the scene around him now brilliantly  lighted by the moon, said, \"Explain to me, Phanes, by what good fortune  this Rhodopis, formerly only a slave and courtesan can now live as a  queen, and receive her guests in this princely manner?\"       [The mistresses (Hetaere) of the Greeks must not be compared with     modern women of bad reputation. The better members of this class     represented the intelligence and culture of their sex in Greece, and     more especially in the Ionian provinces. As an instance we need     only recall Aspasia and her well-attested relation to Pericles and     Socrates. Our heroine Rhodopis was a celebrated woman. The     Hetaera, Thargalia of Miletus, became the wife of a Thessalian king.     Ptolemy Lagi married Thais; her daughter was called Irene, and her     sons Leontiskus and Lagus. Finally, statues were erected to many.]    \"I have long expected this question,\" answered the Athenian. \"I shall  be delighted to make you acquainted with the past history of this woman  before you enter her house. So long as we were on the Nile, I would not  intrude my tale upon you; that ancient river has a wonderful power of  compelling to silence and quiet contemplation. Even my usually quick  tongue was paralyzed like yours, when I took my first night-journey on  the Nile.\"    \"I thank you for this,\" replied the Spartan. \"When I first saw the aged  priest Epimenides, at Knossus in Crete, he was one hundred and fifty  years old, and I remember that his age and sanctity filled me with a  strange dread; but how far older, how far more sacred, is this hoary  river, the ancient stream 'Aigyptos'! Who would wish to avoid the  power of his spells? Now, however, I beg you to give me the history of  Rhodopis.\"    Phanes began: \"When Rhodopis was a little child playing with her  companions on the Thracian sea-shore, she was stolen by some Phoenician  mariners, carried to Samos, and bought by Iadmon, one of the geomori, or  landed aristocracy of the island. The little girl grew day by day more  beautiful, graceful and clever, and was soon an object of love and  admiration to all who knew her. AEsop, the fable-writer, who was at that  time also in bondage to Iadmon, took an especial pleasure in the growing  amiability and talent of the child, taught her and cared for her in the  same way as the tutors whom we keep to educate our Athenian boys.    The kind teacher found his pupil tractable and quick of comprehension,  and the little slave soon practised the arts of music, singing and  eloquence, in a more charming and agreeable manner than the sons of her  master Iadmon, on whose education the greatest care had been lavished.  By the time she had reached her fourteenth year, Rhodopis was so  beautiful and accomplished, that the jealous wife of Iadmon would not  suffer her to remain any longer in the house, and the Samian was forced,  with a heavy heart, to sell her to a certain Xanthus. The government of  Samos at that time was still in the hands of the less opulent nobles;  had Polykrates then been at the head of affairs, Xanthus need not have  despaired of a purchaser. These tyrants fill their treasuries as the  magpies their nests! As it was, however, he went off with his precious  jewel to Naukratis, and there gained a fortune by means of her wondrous  charms. These were three years of the deepest humiliation to Rhodopis,  which she still remembers with horror.    Now it happened, just at the time when her fame was spreading through  all Greece, and strangers were coming from far to Naukratis for her sake  alone, that the people of Lesbos rose up against their nobles, drove  them forth, and chose the wise Pittakus as their ruler.       [According to Herodotus the beauty of Rhodopis was so great that     every Greek knew her by name.]    The highest families of Lesbos were forced to leave the country, and  fled, some to Sicily, some to the Greek provinces of Italy, and others  to Egypt. Alcaeus, the greatest poet of his day, and Charaxus, the  brother of that Sappho whose odes it was our Solon's last wish to  learn by heart, came here to Naukratis, which had already long been the  flourishing centre of commercial communication between Egypt and  the rest of the world. Charaxus saw Rhodopis, and soon loved her  so passionately, that he gave an immense sum to secure her from the  mercenary Xanthus, who was on the point of returning with her to his own  country; Sappho wrote some biting verses, derisive of her brother  and his purchase, but Alcaeus on the other hand, approved, and gave  expression to this feeling in glowing songs on the charms of Rhodopis.  And now Sappho's brother, who had till then remained undistinguished  among the many strangers at Naukratis, became a noted man through  Rhodopis. His house was soon the centre of attraction to all foreigners,  by whom she was overwhelmed with gifts. The King Hophra, hearing of her  beauty and talent, sent for her to Memphis, and offered to buy her  of Charaxus, but the latter had already long, though secretly,  given Rhodopis her freedom, and loved her far too well to allow of a  separation. She too, loved the handsome Lesbian and refused to leave  him despite the brilliant offers made to her on all sides. At length  Charaxus made this wonderful woman his lawful wife, and continued to  live with her and her little daughter Kleis in Naukratis, until the  Lesbian exiles were recalled to their native land by Pittakus. He then  started homeward with his wife, but fell ill on the journey, and died  soon after his arrival at Mitylene. Sappho, who had derided her brother  for marrying one beneath him, soon became an enthusiastic admirer of the  beautiful widow and rivalled Alcaeus in passionate songs to her praise.    After the death of the poetess, Rhodopis returned, with her little  daughter, to Naukratis, where she was welcomed as a goddess. During this  interval Amasis, the present king of Egypt, had usurped the throne of  the Pharaohs, and was maintaining himself in its possession by help of  the army, to which caste he belonged.       [Amasis, of whom much will be said in our text, reigned 570-526 B.     C. His name, in the hieroglyphic signs, was Aahmes or young moon     but the name by which he was commonly called was Sa-Nit \"Son of     Neith.\" His name, and pictures of him are to be found on stones in     the fortress of Cairo, on a relief in Florence, a statue in the     Vatican, on sarcophagi in Stockholm and London, a statue in the     Villa Albani and on a little temple of red granite at Leyden. A     beautiful bust of gray-wacke in our possession probably represents     the same king.]    As his predecessor Hophra had accelerated his fall, and brought the  army and priesthood to open rebellion by his predilection for the  Greek nation, and for intercourse with foreigners generally, (always  an abomination in the eyes of the Egyptians), men felt confident that  Amasis would return to the old ways, would rigorously exclude foreigners  from the country, dismiss the Greek mercenaries, and instead of taking  counsel from the Greeks, would hearken only to the commands of the  priesthood. But in this, as you must see yourself, the prudent Egyptians  had guessed wide of the mark in their choice of a ruler; they fell from  Scylla into Charybdis. If Hophra was called the Greeks' friend, Amasis  must be named our lover. The Egyptians, especially the priests and the  army, breathe fire and flame, and would fain strangle us one and all,  off hand, This feeling on the part of the soldiery does not disturb  Amasis, for he knows too well the comparative value of their and our  services; but with the priests it is another and more serious matter,  for two reasons: first, they possess an unbounded influence over the  people; and secondly. Amasis himself retains more affection than he  likes to acknowledge to us, for this absurd and insipid religion--a  religion which appears doubly sacred to its adherents simply because it  has existed in this eccentric land--unchanged for thousands of years.  These priests make the king's life burdensome to him; they persecute and  injure us in every possible way; and indeed, if it had not been for  the king's protection, I should long ago have been a dead man. But I  am wandering from my tale! As I said before, Rhodopis was received  at Naukratis with open arms by all, and loaded with marks of favor by  Amasis, who formed her acquaintance. Her daughter Kleis, as is the case  with the little Sappho now--was never allowed to "]]]
