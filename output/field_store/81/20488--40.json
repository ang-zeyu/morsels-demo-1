I hoped that your joy would be unclouded  to-night, as mine has been; but will you not tell your father what  troubles you, dearest?\"    \"I was looking at this, papa,\" she said, drawing her mother's  miniature from her bosom, and putting it into his hand; \"and mammy was  telling me all about my own mamma again; and, papa, you know I love  Miss Rose, and I am very glad she is coming to us, but it seems as  if--as if--\" She burst into a flood of tears, and hiding her face on  his breast, sobbed out, \"Oh, papa, I can't help feeling as though  mamma--my own dear mamma--is farther away from us now; as if she is  going to be forgotten.\"    There were tears in his eyes, too; but gently raising her head, he  pushed back the curls from her forehead, and kissing her tenderly,  said, in low, soothing tones, \"No, darling; it is only a feeling, and  will soon pass away. Your own dear mother--my early love--can never be  forgotten by either of us. Nor would Rose wish it. There is room in  my heart for both of them, and I do not love the memory of Elsie less  because I have given a place in it to Rose.\"    There was a momentary silence; then she looked up, asking timidly,  \"You are not vexed with me, papa?\"    \"No, dearest; not at all; and I am very glad you have told me your  feelings so freely,\" he said, folding her closer and closer to his  heart. \"I hope you will always come to me with your sorrows, and you  need never fear that you will not find sympathy, and help too, as far  as it is in my power to give it. Elsie, do you know that you are very  like your mother?--the resemblance grows stronger every day; and it  would be quite impossible for me to forget her with this living image  always before me.\"    \"Am I like her, papa? I am so glad!\" exclaimed the little girl  eagerly, her face lighting up with a joyous smile.    It seemed as though Mr. Dinsmore could hardly bear to part with his  child that night; he held her a long time in his arms, but at last,  with another tender caress, and a fervent blessing, he bade her  good-night and sent her away.          CHAPTER III.      She twin'd--and her mother's gaze brought back    Each hue of her childhood's faded track.    Oh! hush the song, and let her tears    Flow to the dream of her early years!    Holy and pure are the drops that fall    When the young bride goes from her father's hall;    She goes unto love yet untried and new--    She parts from love which hath still been true.      --MRS. HEMANS' POEMS.      \"How did it happen that Mr. Dinsmore was not of your party last night,  Miss Stevens?\" inquired one of the lady boarders the next morning at  the breakfast-table.    \"He had been riding all the morning with his little girl, and I  presume was too much fatigued to go again in the evening,\" Miss  Stevens coolly replied, as she broke an egg into her cup, and  proceeded very deliberately to season it.    \"It seems he was not too much fatigued to walk,\" returned the other, a  little maliciously; \"or to take a lady upon his arm.\"    Miss Stevens started, and looked up hastily.    \"I would advise you to be on your guard, and play your cards well,  or that quiet Miss Allison may prove a serious rival,\" the lady  continued. \"He certainly pays her a good deal of attention.\"    \"It is easy to account for that,\" remarked Miss Stevens, with a  scornful toss of the head; \"he is very fond of his little girl, and  takes her out walking or riding every day, and this Miss Allison--who  is, I presume, a kind of governess--indeed, it is evident that she  is, from the care she takes of the child--goes along as a matter of  course; but if you think Horace Dinsmore would look at a governess,  you are greatly mistaken, for he is as proud as Lucifer, as well as  the rest of his family, though he does set up to be so very pious!\"    \"Excuse me, madam,\" observed a gentleman sitting near, \"but you must  be laboring under a misapprehension. I am well acquainted with the  Allison family, and can assure you that the father is one of the  wealthiest merchants in Philadelphia.\"    At this moment Mr. Dinsmore entered with Rose upon his arm, and  leading Elsie with the other hand. They drew near the table; he handed  Miss Allison to a seat and took his place beside her.    A slight murmur of surprise ran round the table, and all eyes were  turned upon Rose, who, feeling uncomfortably conscious of the fact,  cast down her own in modest embarrassment, while Elsie, with a face  all smiles and dimples, sent a triumphant glance across the table at  Annie Hart, who was whispering to her mother, \"See, mamma, she has Mr.  Dinsmore's ring!\"    That lady immediately called Miss Stevens' attention to it, which was  quite unnecessary, as she was already burning with rage at the sight.    \"They walked out alone last evening, and that ring explains what they  were about,\" said Mrs. Hart, in an undertone. \"I am really sorry for  you, Miss Stevens; for your prize has certainly slipped through your  fingers.\"    \"I am much obliged to you,\" she replied, with a toss of her head; \"but  there are as good fish in the sea as ever were caught.\"    The next moment she rose and left the table, Mrs. Hart following her  into the public parlor, and continuing the conversation by remarking,  \"I would sue him for breach of promise if I were you, Miss Stevens. I  understood you were engaged to him.\"    \"I never said so; so what right had you to suppose it?\" returned Miss  Stevens snappishly.    And upon reflecting a moment, Mrs. Hart could not remember that she  had ever said so in plain terms, although she had hinted it many  times--talking a great deal of Mr. Dinsmore's splendid establishment,  and frequently speaking of the changes she thought would be desirable  in Elsie's dress, just as though she expected some day to have it  under her control. Then, too, she had always treated Mr. Dinsmore with  so much familiarity that it was perfectly natural strangers should  suppose they were engaged, even though he never reciprocated it;  for that might be only because he was naturally reserved and  undemonstrative; as indeed Miss Stevens frequently averred, seeming to  regret it very deeply.    Presently she burst out, \"I don't know why people are always so ready  to talk! I don't care for Horace Dinsmore, and never did! There was  never anything serious between us, though I must say he has paid me  marked attentions, and given me every reason to suppose he meant  something by them. I never gave him any encouragement, however; and so  he has been taken in by that artful creature. I thought he had more  sense, and could see through her manoeuvers--coaxing and petting up  the child to curry favor with the father! I thank my stars that I am  above such mean tricks! I presume she thinks, now, she is making a  splendid match; but if she doesn't repent of her bargain before she  has been married a year, I miss my guess! She'll never have her own  way--not a bit of it--I can tell her that. Everybody that knows  him will tell you that he is high-tempered and tyrannical, and as  obstinate as a mule.\"    \"The grapes are very sour, I think,\" whispered Mrs. Hart to her next  neighbor, who nodded and laughed.    \"There is Elsie out on the veranda, now,\" said Annie. \"I mean to  go and ask her what Miss Allison had her father's ring for; may I,  mamma?\"    \"Yes; go, child, if you want to; I should like to hear what she will  say; though, of course, everybody understands that there must be an  engagement.\"    \"Well, Elsie, what made you run away in such a hurry yesterday?\" asked  Annie, running up to our little friend. \"Did you ask your papa about  the new mamma?\"    \"I told him what you said, Annie, and it wasn't true,\" Elsie answered,  with a glad look of joy. \"I am going to have a new mother though, and  papa said I might tell you; but it is Miss Allison instead of Miss  Stevens, and I am very glad, because I love her dearly.\"    \"Is she your governess?\"    \"No, indeed! what made you ask?\"    \"Miss Stevens said so,\" replied Annie, laughing and running away. And  just then Elsie's papa called her, and bade her go upstairs and have  her hat put on, as they were going out to walk.    Edward Allison had been talking with his sister in her room, and they  came down together to the veranda, where Mr. Dinsmore and Elsie were  waiting for them. Edward was looking very proud and happy, but Rose's  face was half hidden by her veil. She took Mr. Dinsmore's offered arm  and Elsie asked, \"Aren't you going with us, Mr. Edward?\"    \"Not this time,\" he answered, smiling. \"I have an engagement to play a  game of chess with one of the ladies in the parlor yonder.\"    \"Then I shall have papa's other hand,\" she said, taking possession of  it.    She was very merry and talkative, but neither of her companions seemed  much disposed to answer her remarks. They were following the same path  they had taken the night before, and the thoughts of both were very  busy with the past "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9966"],[0,"The Spartan Twins (#5)"],[1,"out of the bushes and counted the flock like a careful  shepherd. They were all there, and Argos was still on watch.    \"I'll lie down a little while, too,\" said Dion to himself, \"but I won't  go to sleep. I'll just look at the sky.\"    He stretched himself out beside Daphne and watched the white clouds  sailing away overhead, and in two minutes he was asleep too.    How long they slept the children never knew. They were awakened at last  by a long, long howl, which seemed to come from the other side of the  hill. They sat up and clutched each other in terror. There was an  answering howl from Argos, and mingled with it they heard the dull thud  of many feet, the bleating of sheep, and the frightened cries of lambs.    \"The sheep are frightened. There's a stampede!\" cried Dion.    The two children plunged through the bushes and gazed about them. The  whole flock had disappeared! Their bells could be heard in a mad jangle  of sound from the farther side of the hill, Argos was barking wildly.    \"Come on,\" shouted Dion, springing out of the bushes, \"We must get them  back.\"    \"Suppose it is a wolf!\" shrieked Daphne, tumbling after him.    \"We'll have to get the sheep back even if it is a bear,\" cried Dion, and  he tore away over the crest of the hill and down the farther slope.  Daphne followed after him, as fast as she could run.    The sheep were already a long distance away, in a region of the hills  which the children had never seen before in their lives, but they did not  stop to think of that. All they thought was that the sheep must be  brought back at any cost. They could see Argos barking and circling round  the frightened flock, and away in the distance a huge wild creature was  just disappearing into the woods.    On the children ran, over rocks and through briars, until at last they  reached the sheep, whose flight Argos had already checked. Dion ran  beyond to turn them back, while Daphne herded them on one side and Argos  on the other. When they had the flock together and quiet once more, the  children counted them.    \"There's one missing!\" cried Daphne, aghast. \"And it's the old black ewe!  What will Father say?\"    \"It's all your fault,\" said Dion. \"I told you you would have bad luck if  you spoke about the Gods the way you did. I shouldn't wonder if that  wasn't really a wolf that we saw. It may have been Pan himself! Or it may  have been Apollo, and he meant to show you that you can't run even as  fast as a sheep!\"    \"Anyway, the old black ewe is gone.\"    \"Oh dear! Oh dear! What shall we do?\" mourned Daphne.    By this time the sun was low in the sky, and it was late afternoon.    \"The first thing to do is to get home as fast as we can,\" said Dion.    \"Which way is home?\" said Daphne.    Dion looked about him. \"I don't know,\" he said. \"Maybe Argos does. Here  Argos! Good dog! Take 'em home! Home Argos! Home!\"    Argos wagged his tail, and ran around behind the flock.    \"Bow-wow, bow-wow,\" he barked, and nipped the heels of the wether. In a  short time he had the whole flock moving toward a hollow between the  hills. As they trotted along behind the sheep, Daphne struck her hands  together in dismay.    \"What else do you think I have done?\" she cried. \"I've left my crook in  the robber's cave!\"    \"And I left my pipe there, too,\" Dion wailed.    \"We can't get them to-night anyway,\" sobbed Daphne. \"We could never find  the place! And besides, it is too late. It will be dark before we get  home.\"    They trudged along behind Argos and the sheep in dismal silence. Argos  did not seem at all in doubt about the way home. He drove the sheep  through the hollow between the hills and across two fields, and brought  them out at last upon a roadway.    \"This must be the road that goes by the house,\" cried Dion joyfully. For  answer Daphne pointed toward the east. There some distance ahead of them  was Dromas driving the oxen home from the day's ploughing.    Daphne clapped her hands for joy. \"I knew Argos would find the way!\" she  cried.    The bright colors of the sunset were just fading from the sky when they  reached the farm-yard gate. Dromas had gone in before them with the oxen,  and Melas himself was waiting to let them in and to count the sheep.    \"Where is the old black ewe?\" he said sternly to the Twins, when the last  sheep had passed through the gate.    \"We don't know,\" sobbed Daphne. \"We lost her. We lost the crook, and  Dion's little pipe, too. A wolf frightened the flock, and they ran away,  and--\"    \"_Maybe_ it was a wolf,\" said Dion darkly.    Then the Twins told the whole story to their Father. Melas did not say  much to them. He was a man of few words at any time, but he made them  feel very much ashamed. And when Lydia heard the things Daphne had said  about the Gods, they felt worse than ever, at least Daphne did.    That night, before the family went to bed, Melas kindled a fire upon the  little altar which stood in the middle of the court and offered upon it a  handful of barley, and prayed to Pan and to Apollo that Daphne might be  forgiven for her wicked words.          IV    SOWING AND REAPING      The children were not allowed again to take the sheep to the hills. \"They  are not to be trusted,\" said Melas. \"They are the sort of shepherds that  go to sleep and let the wolves find the flock. They are not real  Spartans.\"    Dion and Daphne felt this as a terrible reproach. Dromas now had to go  with the sheep, and so could no longer help with the other farm work, and  the ploughing and sowing of the corn-field had to be finished by Melas  himself. The Twins did their best to help. When Melas scattered the  grain, they followed with rakes and scratched a layer of earth over the  seeds. The crows watched the planting with much interest.    \"Look at them,\" cried Dion to his Father one afternoon. \"There are five  of them on that tree yonder, and the minute we get to one end of the  field they begin to scratch up the grain at the other.\"    \"We'll fix them,\" said Melas shortly.    He sent the Twins to the house for sticks and straw and his old worn-out  sheepskin cloak and hat, and when they came back, Melas stuck two long  sticks of wood in the ground and bound a cross piece to them with strips  of leather. Then he wound the sticks with straw, and made a round bundle  of straw at the top. He tied it all securely with thongs. Then he dressed  it with the sheepskin and put on the hat. When it was done, it was the  scariest looking scarecrow you ever saw!    \"I guess that will frighten the crows!\" said Dion, as he gazed at it  admiringly. \"It just about scares me.\"    \"Caw, caw, caw!\" screamed a crow.    A crow was flying right over his head! Dion shook his fist at him. \"You  old thief!\" he cried.    \"I know one more thing we can do,\" said Daphne. \"Lycias told me about  it.\" She got a small piece of bark and made a little amulet of it. She  punched a hole through one end and put a leather string through it.  Neither she nor Dion could write, so when she had explained what must  be done Melas himself took a sharp stone and scratched a curse upon crows  in the soft bark. When it was done Daphne hung it about the neck of the  scarecrow. \"There,\" said Melas grimly, \"I don't believe he'll go to sleep  on the job. He's a Spartan scarecrow! Now let's go home to supper, and  to-morrow we'll see how it works.\"    The next morning the very first thing the Twins did was to rush out to  the field and there, right on top of the scarecrow were three black  crows, and more were on the ground eating up the seed!    \"After all we did, just look at them!\" cried Dion.    \"Caw, caw,\" screamed the crows.    \"You don't suppose Father made a mistake, and wrote a blessing instead  of a curse on that amulet?\" said Daphne anxiously. They ran back to the  house as fast as they could go. Melas was just coming out of the  farm-yard with a pruning-hook in his hand.    \"Oh, Father,\" cried Dion, \"the crows are roosting all over the scarecrow.  Maybe he wasn't a Spartan scarecrow after all.\"    \"Anyway, he seems to have gone to sleep on the job,\" added Daphne.    Melas stared at the crows in angry silence. \"You children will have to  get your clappers then, and just drive the old thieves away,\" he said at  last, \"You will have to spend the day in the field watching them. I've  got to work in the vineyard. The vines must be pruned.\"    The Twins had not yet had their breakfast and they were hungry. So they  ran to the kitchen, seized some barley-cakes and a little jar of milk,  and in a few minutes were back again in the field. They sat down with  the wooden clappers beside them, and ate their breakfast in the company  of the scarecrow. All day long they watched the grain and rattled their  clappers, or threw clods at the black marauders. It was lively work, and  although they did not like it, they remembered the black ewe and stuck  faithfully at it all through the long day.    When the sun was high overhead, Lydia brought them some figs and cheese  and a drink of goat's milk. She also brought a message. This was the  message. \"Father says you are to stay here until after dark. You are to  hunt around until you find a toad, and when you find it, you must be  sure not to let it get away from you. He is going to put a magic spell on  the field to keep the crows away, but the spell will not work except in  the dark. So you must stay here until he comes.\"    Between keeping off the birds and hunting for the toad, the Twins spent a  busy afternoon. And after the toad was found it was no joke to try to  keep it. It was a wonderful hopper and nearly got away twice. At dusk the  crows flew away to their nests, and the children were alone in the field  until the twilight deepened into darkness. Owls had begun to hoot and  bats were flying about, when at last they saw three dim, shadowy figures  coming across the field.    The shadowy figures were Melas, Lydia, and Chloe. Lydia bore a jar, which  she placed beside"]]]
