There was a murmur of voices in the hall,  and Mr. Nestor, half listening, heard a voice he knew.    \"There's Tom Swift now!\" he exclaimed. \"I'm going to find out why he  doesn't enlist!\"          Chapter V    \"Is He a Slacker?\"      Mr. Nestor, whatever else he was, proved to be a prudent father. He did  not immediately go into the front room, whither Mary and Tom hastened,  their voices mingling in talk and laughter.    Mr. Nestor, after leaving the young folks alone for a while, with a  loud \"Ahem!\" and a rattling of his paper as he laid it aside, started  for the parlor.    \"Good-evening, Mr. Nestor!\" said Tom, rising to shake hands with the  father of his young and pretty hostess.    \"Hello, Tom!\" was the cordial greeting, in return. \"What's going on up  at your place?\" went on Mr. Nestor, as he took a chair.    \"Oh, nothing very special,\" Tom answered. \"We're turning out different  kinds of machines as usual, and dad and I are experimenting, also as  usual.\"    \"I suppose so. But what nearly broke the fence to-night?\"    Tom started, and looked quickly at his host.    \"Were you there?\" he asked quickly.    \"Well, I happened to be passing--took a short cut home--and I heard  some queer goings on at your place. I was speaking to Mary about them,  and wondering--\"    \"Father, perhaps Tom doesn't want to talk about his inventions,\"  interrupted Mary. \"You know some of them are secret--\"    \"Oh, I wasn't exactly asking for information!\" exclaimed Mr. Nestor  quickly. \"I just happened to hear the fence crash, and I was wondering  if something was coming out at me. Didn't know but what that giant of  yours was on a rampage, Tom,\" and he laughed.    \"No, it wasn't anything like that,\" and Tom's voice was more sober than  the occasion seemed to warrant. \"It was one of our new machines, and it  didn't act just right. No great damage was done, though. How do you  find business, Mr. Nestor, since the war spirit has grown stronger?\"  asked Tom, and it seemed to both Mary and her father that the young  inventor deliberately changed the subject.    \"Well, it isn't all it might be,\" said the other. \"It's hard to get  good help. A lot of our boys enlisted, and some were taken in the  draft. By the way, Tom, have they called on you yet?\"    \"No. Not yet.\"    \"You didn't enlist?\"    \"Ned Newton tried to,\" broke in Mary, \"but the quota for this locality  was filled, and they told him he'd better wait for the draft. He  wouldn't do that and tried again. Then the bank people heard about it  and had him exempted. They said he was too valuable to them, and he has  been doing remarkably well in selling Liberty Bonds!\" and Mary's eyes  sparkled with her emotions.    \"Yes, Ned is a crackerjack salesman!\" agreed Tom, no less  enthusiastically. \"He's sold more bonds, in proportion, for his bank,  than any other in this county. Dad and I both took some, and have  promised him more. I am glad now that we let him go, although we valued  his services highly. We hope to have him back later.\"    \"He can put me down for more bonds too!\" said Mr. Nestor.  \"I'm going  to see Germany beaten if it takes every last dollar I have!\"    \"That's what I say!\" Cried Mary. \"I took out all my savings, except a  little I'm keeping to buy a wedding present for Jennie Morse. Did you  know she was going to get married, Tom?\" she asked.    \"I heard so.\"    \"Well, all but what I want for a wedding present to her has gone into  Liberty Bonds. Isn't this a history-making time, Tom?\"    \"Indeed it is, Mary!\"    \"Everybody who has a part in it--whether he fights as a soldier or only  knits like the Red Cross girls--will be telling about it for years  after,\" went on the girl, and she looked at Tom eagerly.    \"Yes,\" he agreed. \"These are queer times. We don't know exactly where  we're at. A lot of our men have been called.  We tried to have some of  them exempted, and did manage it in a few cases.\"    \"You did?\" cried Mr. Nestor, as if in surprise. \"You stopped men from  going to war!\"    \"Only so they could work on airship motors for the Government,\" Tom  quietly explained.    \"Oh! Well, of course, that's part of the game,\" agreed Mary's father.  \"A lot more of our boys are going off next week. Doesn't it make you  thrill, Tom, when you see them marching off, even if they haven't their  uniforms yet? Jove, if I wasn't too old, I'd go in a minute!\"    \"Father!\" cried Mary.    \"Yes, I would!\" he declared. \"The German government has got to be  beaten, and we've got to do our bit; everybody has--man, woman and  child!\"    \"Yes,\" agreed Tom, in a low voice, \"that's very true. But every one, in  a sense, has to judge for himself what the 'bit' is. We can't all do  the same.\"    There was a little silence, and then Mary went over to the piano and  played. It was a rather welcome relief, under the circumstances, from  the conversation.    \"Mary, what do you think of Tom?\" asked Mr. Nestor, when the visitor  had gone.    \"What do I think of him?\" And she blushed.    \"I mean about his not enlisting. Do you think he's a slacker?\"    \"A slacker? Why, Father!\"    \"Oh, I don't mean he's afraid. We've seen proof enough of his courage,  and all that. But I mean don't you think he wants stirring up a bit?\"    \"He is going to Washington to-morrow, Father. He told me so to-night.  And it may be--\"    \"Oh, well, then maybe it's all right,\" hastily said Mr. Nestor. \"He may  be going to get a commission in the engineer corps. It isn't like Tom  Swift to hang back, and yet it does begin to look as though he cared  more for his queer inventions--machines that butt down fences than for  helping Uncle Sam. But I'll reserve judgment.\"    \"You'd better, Father!\" and Mary laughed--a little. Yet there was a  worried look on her face.    During the next few nights Mr. Nestor made it a habit to take the short  cut from the railroad station, coming past the big fence that enclosed  one particular building of the Swift plant.    \"I wonder if there's a hole where I could look through,\" said Mr.  Nestor to himself. \"Of course I don't believe in spying on what another  man is doing, and yet I'm too good a friend of Tom's to want to see him  make a fool of himself.  He ought to be in the army, or helping Uncle  Sam in some way. And yet if he spends all his time on some foolish  contraption, like a new kind of traction plow, what good is that? If I  could get a glimpse of it, I might drop a friendly hint in his ear.\"    But there were no cracks in the fence, or, if there were, it was too  dark to see them, and also too dark to behold anything on the other  side of the barrier. So Mr. Nestor, wondering much, kept on his way.    It was a day or so after this that Ned Newton paid a visit to the Swift  home. Mr. Swift was not in the house, being out in one of the various  buildings, Mrs. Baggert said.    \"Where's Tom?\" asked the bond salesman.    \"Oh, he hasn't come back from Washington yet,\" answered the housekeeper.    \"He is making a long stay.\"    \"Yes, he went about a week ago on some business. But we expect him back  to-day.\"    \"Well, then I'll see him. I called to ask if Mr. Swift didn't want to  take a few more bonds. We want to double our allotment for Shopton, and  beat out some of the other towns in this section. I'll go to see Mr.  Swift.\"    On his way to find Tom's father Ned passed the big building in front of  which Eradicate and Koku were on guard.  They nodded to Ned, who passed  them, wondering much as to what it was Tom was so secretive about.    \"It's the first time I remember when he worked on an invention without  telling me something about it,\" mused Ned.  \"Well, I suppose it will  all come out in good time. Anything new, Rad?\"    \"No, Massa Ned, nuffin much. I'm detectin' around heah; keepin'  Dutchmen spies away!\"    \"And Koku is helping you, I suppose?\"    \"Whut, him?  Dat big, good-fo'-nuffin white trash? No, sah! I's  detectin' by mahse'f, dat's whut I is!\" and Eradicate strutted proudly  up and down on his allotted part of the beat, being careful not to  approach the building too closely, for that was Koku's ground.    Ned smiled, and passed on. He found Mr. Swift, secured his subscription  to more bonds, and was about to leave when he heard a call down the  road and saw Tom coming in his small racing car, which had been taken  to the depot by one of the workmen.    \"Hello, old man!\" cried Ned affectionately, as his chum alighted with a  jump. \"Where have you been?\"    \"Down to Washington. Had a bit of a chat with the President and gave  him some of my views.\"    \"About the war, I suppose?\" laughed Ned.    \"Yes.\"    \"Did you get your commission?\"    \"Commission?\" And there was a wondering look on Tom's face.    \"Yes. Mary Nestor said she thought maybe you were going to Washington  to take an examination for the engineering corps or something like  that. Did you get made an officer?\"    \"No,\" answered Tom slowly. \"I went to Washington to get exempted.\"    \"Exempted?\" Cried Ned, and his voice sounded strained.          Chapter VI    Seeing Things      For a moment Tom Swift looked at his chum. Then something of what was  passing in the mind of the young bond salesman must have been reflected  to Tom, for he said,    \"Look here, old man; I know it may seem a bit strange to go to all that  trouble to get exempted from the draft, to which I am eligible, but,  believe me, there's a reason. I can't say anything now, but I'll tell  you as soon as I can--tell everybody, in fact. Just now it isn't in  shape to talk about.\"    \"Oh, that's all right, Tom,\" and Ned tried to make his voice sound  natural. \"I was just wondering, that's all. I wanted to go to the front  the worst way, but they wouldn't let me. I was sort of hoping you  could, and come back to tell me about it.\"    \"I may yet, Ned.\"    \"You may? Why, I thought--\"    \"Oh, I'm only exempted for a time. I've got certain things to do, and I  couldn't do 'em if I enlisted or was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/955"],[0,"The Patchwork Girl of Oz (#5)"],[1,", Ojo at one side  and the Magician in front, where he would have freedom to sprinkle the  powder. The Glass Cat came near, too, curious to watch the important  scene.    \"All ready?\" asked Dr. Pipt.    \"All is ready,\" answered his wife.    So the Magician leaned over and shook from the bottle some grains of  the wonderful Powder, and they fell directly on the Patchwork Girl's  head and arms.          Chapter Five    A Terrible Accident      \"It will take a few minutes for this powder to do its work,\" remarked  the Magician, sprinkling the body up and down with much care.    But suddenly the Patchwork Girl threw up one arm, which knocked the  bottle of powder from the crooked man's hand and sent it flying across  the room. Unc Nunkie and Margolotte were so startled that they both  leaped backward and bumped together, and Unc's head joggled the shelf  above them and upset the bottle containing the Liquid of Petrifaction.    The Magician uttered such a wild cry that Ojo jumped away and the  Patchwork Girl sprang after him and clasped her stuffed arms around him  in terror. The Glass Cat snarled and hid under the table, and so it was  that when the powerful Liquid of Petrifaction was spilled it fell only  upon the wife of the Magician and the uncle of Ojo. With these two the  charm worked promptly. They stood motionless and stiff as marble  statues, in exactly the positions they were in when the Liquid struck  them.    Ojo pushed the Patchwork Girl away and ran to Unc Nunkie, filled with a  terrible fear for the only friend and protector he had ever known. When  he grasped Unc's hand it was cold and hard. Even the long gray beard  was solid marble. The Crooked Magician was dancing around the room in a  frenzy of despair, calling upon his wife to forgive him, to speak to  him, to come to life again!    The Patchwork Girl, quickly recovering from her fright, now came nearer  and looked from one to another of the people with deep interest. Then  she looked at herself and laughed. Noticing the mirror, she stood  before it and examined her extraordinary features with amazement--her  button eyes, pearl bead teeth and puffy nose. Then, addressing her  reflection in the glass, she exclaimed:        \"Whee, but there's a gaudy dame!      Makes a paint-box blush with shame.      Razzle-dazzle, fizzle-fazzle!      Howdy-do, Miss What's-your-name?\"      She bowed, and the reflection bowed. Then she laughed again, long and  merrily, and the Glass Cat crept out from under the table and said:    \"I don't blame you for laughing at yourself. Aren't you horrid?\"    \"Horrid?\" she replied. \"Why, I'm thoroughly delightful. I'm an  Original, if you please, and therefore incomparable. Of all the comic,  absurd, rare and amusing creatures the world contains, I must be the  supreme freak. Who but poor Margolotte could have managed to invent  such an unreasonable being as I? But I'm glad--I'm awfully glad!--that  I'm just what I am, and nothing else.\"    \"Be quiet, will you?\" cried the frantic Magician; \"be quiet and let me  think! If I don't think I shall go mad.\"    \"Think ahead,\" said the Patchwork Girl, seating herself in a chair.  \"Think all you want to. I don't mind.\"    \"Gee! but I'm tired playing that tune,\" called the phonograph, speaking  through its horn in a brazen, scratchy voice. \"If you don't mind, Pipt,  old boy, I'll cut it out and take a rest.\"    The Magician looked gloomily at the music-machine.    \"What dreadful luck!\" he wailed, despondently. \"The Powder of Life must  have fallen on the phonograph.\"    He went up to it and found that the gold bottle that contained the  precious powder had dropped upon the stand and scattered its  life-giving grains over the machine. The phonograph was very much  alive, and began dancing a jig with the legs of the table to which it  was attached, and this dance so annoyed Dr. Pipt that he kicked the  thing into a corner and pushed a bench against it, to hold it quiet.    \"You were bad enough before,\" said the Magician, resentfully; \"but a  live phonograph is enough to drive every sane person in the Land of Oz  stark crazy.\"    \"No insults, please,\" answered the phonograph in a surly tone. \"You did  it, my boy; don't blame me.\"    \"You've bungled everything, Dr. Pipt,\" added the Glass Cat,  contemptuously.    \"Except me,\" said the Patchwork Girl, jumping up to whirl merrily  around the room.    \"I think,\" said Ojo, almost ready to cry through grief over Unc  Nunkie's sad fate, \"it must all be my fault, in some way. I'm called  Ojo the Unlucky, you know.\"    \"That's nonsense, kiddie,\" retorted the Patchwork Girl cheerfully. \"No  one can be unlucky who has the intelligence to direct his own actions.  The unlucky ones are those who beg for a chance to think, like poor Dr.  Pipt here. What's the row about, anyway, Mr. Magic-maker?\"    \"The Liquid of Petrifaction has accidentally fallen upon my dear wife  and Unc Nunkie and turned them into marble,\" he sadly replied.    \"Well, why don't you sprinkle some of that powder on them and bring  them to life again?\" asked the Patchwork Girl.    The Magician gave a jump.    \"Why, I hadn't thought of that!\" he joyfully cried, and grabbed up the  golden bottle, with which he ran to Margolotte.    Said the Patchwork Girl:        \"Higgledy, piggledy, dee--      What fools magicians be!      His head's so thick      He can't think quick,      So he takes advice from me.\"      Standing upon the bench, for he was so crooked he could not reach the  top of his wife's head in any other way, Dr. Pipt began shaking the  bottle. But not a grain of powder came out. He pulled off the cover,  glanced within, and then threw the bottle from him with a wail of  despair.    \"Gone--gone! Every bit gone,\" he cried. \"Wasted on that miserable  phonograph when it might have saved my dear wife!\"    Then the Magician bowed his head on his crooked arms and began to cry.    Ojo was sorry for him. He went up to the sorrowful man and said softly:    \"You can make more Powder of Life, Dr. Pipt.\"    \"Yes; but it will take me six years--six long, weary years of stirring  four kettles with both feet and both hands,\" was the agonized reply.  \"Six years! while poor Margolotte stands watching me as a marble image.\"    \"Can't anything else be done?\" asked the Patchwork Girl.    The Magician shook his head. Then he seemed to remember something and  looked up.    \"There is one other compound that would destroy the magic spell of the  Liquid of Petrifaction and restore my wife and Unc Nunkie to life,\"  said he. \"It may be hard to find the things I need to make this magic  compound, but if they were found I could do in an instant what will  otherwise take six long, weary years of stirring kettles with both  hands and both feet.\"    \"All right; let's find the things, then,\" suggested the Patchwork Girl.  \"That seems a lot more sensible than those stirring times with the  kettles.\"    \"That's the idea, Scraps,\" said the Glass Cat, approvingly. \"I'm glad  to find you have decent brains. Mine are exceptionally good. You can  see 'em work; they're pink.\"    \"Scraps?\" repeated the girl. \"Did you call me 'Scraps'? Is that my  name?\"    \"I--I believe my poor wife had intended to name you 'Angeline,'\" said  the Magician.    \"But I like 'Scraps' best,\" she replied with a laugh. \"It fits me  better, for my patchwork is all scraps, and nothing else. Thank you for  naming me, Miss Cat. Have you any name of your own?\"    \"I have a foolish name that Margolotte once gave me, but which is quite  undignified for one of my importance,\" answered the cat. \"She called me  'Bungle.'\"    \"Yes,\" sighed the Magician; \"you were a sad bungle, taken all in all. I  was wrong to make you as I did, for a more useless, conceited and  brittle thing never before existed.\"    \"I'm not so brittle as you think,\" retorted the cat. \"I've been alive a  good many years, for Dr. Pipt experimented on me with the first magic  Powder of Life he ever made, and so far I've never broken or cracked or  chipped any part of me.\"    \"You seem to have a chip on your shoulder,\" laughed the Patchwork Girl,  and the cat went to the mirror to see.    \"Tell me,\" pleaded Ojo, speaking to the Crooked Magician, \"what must we  find to make the compound that will save Unc Nunkie?\"    \"First,\" was the reply, \"I must have a six-leaved clover. That can only  be found in the green country around the Emerald City, and six-leaved  clovers are very scarce, even there.\"    \"I'll find it for you,\" promised Ojo.    \"The next thing,\" continued the Magician, \"is the left wing of a yellow  butterfly. That color can only be found in the yellow country of the  Winkies, West of the Emerald City.\"    \"I'll find it,\" declared Ojo. \"Is that all?\"    \"Oh, no; I'll get my Book of Recipes and see what comes next.\"    Saying this, the Magician unlocked a drawer of his cabinet and drew out  a small book covered with blue leather. Looking through the pages he  found the recipe he wanted and said: \"I must have a gill of water from  a dark well.\"    \"What kind of a well is that, sir?\" asked the boy.    \"One where the light of day never penetrates. The water must be put in  a gold bottle and brought to me without any light ever reaching it.\"    \"I'll get the water from the dark well,\" said Ojo.    \"Then I must have three hairs from the tip of a Woozy's tail, and a  drop of oil from a live man's body.\"    Ojo looked grave at this.    \"What is a Woozy, please?\" he inquired.    \"Some sort of an animal. I've never seen one, so I can't describe it,\"  replied the Magician.    \"If I can find a Woozy, I'll get the hairs from its tail,\" said Ojo.  \"But is there ever any oil in a man's body?\"    The Magician looked in the book again, to make sure.    \"That's what the recipe calls for,\" he replied, \"and of course we must  get everything that is called for, or the charm won't work. The book  doesn't say 'blood'; it says 'oil,' and there must be oil somewhere in  a live man's body or the book"]]]
