[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6886"],[0,"First Footsteps in East Africa (#5)"],[1,"became persuaded  that the city was inaccessible, and Europeans ceased to trouble themselves  about Harar.    It is, therefore, a point of honor with me, dear L., to utilise my title  of Haji by entering the city, visiting the ruler, and returning in safety,  after breaking the guardian spell.    The most auspicious day in the Moslem year for beginning a journey is,  doubtless, the 6th of the month Safar [2], on which, quoth the Prophet, El  Islam emerged from obscurity. Yet even at Aden we could not avail  ourselves of this lucky time: our delays and difficulties were a fit  prelude for a journey amongst those \"Blameless Ethiopians,\" with whom no  less a personage than august Jove can dine and depart. [3]    On Sunday, the 29th October, 1854, our manifold impediments were  pronounced complete. Friend S. threw the slipper of blessing at my back,  and about 4 P.M. embarking from Maala Bunder, we shook out our \"muslin,\"  and sailed down the fiery harbour. Passing the guard-boat, we delivered  our permit; before venturing into the open sea we repeated the Fatihah-  prayer in honor of the Shaykh Majid, inventor of the mariners' compass  [4], and evening saw us dancing on the bright clear tide, whose \"magic  waves,\" however, murmured after another fashion the siren song which  charmed the senses of the old Arabian voyagers. [5]    Suddenly every trace of civilisation fell from my companions as if it had  been a garment. At Aden, shaven and beturbaned, Arab fashion, now they  threw off all dress save the loin cloth, and appeared in their dark  morocco. Mohammed filled his mouth with a mixture of coarse Surat tobacco  and ashes,--the latter article intended, like the Anglo-Indian soldier's  chili in his arrack, to \"make it bite.\" Guled uncovered his head, a member  which in Africa is certainly made to go bare, and buttered himself with an  unguent redolent of sheep's tail; and Ismail, the rais or captain of our  \"foyst,\" [6] the Sahalah, applied himself to puffing his nicotiana out of  a goat's shank-bone. Our crew, consisting of seventy-one men and boys,  prepared, as evening fell, a mess of Jowari grain [7] and grease, the  recipe of which I spare you, and it was despatched in a style that would  have done credit to Kafirs as regards gobbling, bolting, smearing lips,  licking fingers, and using ankles as napkins. Then with a light easterly  breeze and the ominous cliffs of Little Aden still in sight, we spread our  mats on deck and prepared to sleep under the moon. [8]    My companions, however, felt, without perhaps comprehending, the joviality  arising from a return to Nature. Every man was forthwith nicknamed, and  pitiless was the raillery upon the venerable subjects of long and short,  fat and thin. One sang a war-song, another a love-song, a third some song  of the sea, whilst the fourth, an Eesa youth, with the villanous  expression of face common to his tribe, gave us a rain measure, such as  men chaunt during wet weather. All these effusions were _naive_ and  amusing: none, however, could bear English translation without an amount  of omission which would change their nature. Each effort of minstrelsy was  accompanied by roars of laughter, and led to much manual pleasantry. All  swore that they had never spent, intellectually speaking, a more charming  _soiree_, and pitied me for being unable to enter thoroughly into the  spirit of the dialogue. Truly it is not only the polished European, as was  said of a certain travelling notability, that lapses with facility into  pristine barbarism.    I will now introduce you to my companions. The managing man is one  Mohammed Mahmud [9], generally called El Hammal or the porter: he is a  Havildar or sergeant in the Aden police, and was entertained for me by  Lieut. Dansey, an officer who unfortunately was not \"confirmed\" in a  political appointment at Aden. The Hammal is a bull-necked, round-headed  fellow of lymphatic temperament, with a lamp-black skin, regular features,  and a pulpy figure,--two rarities amongst his countrymen, who compare him  to a Banyan. An orphan in early youth, and becoming, to use his own  phrase, sick of milk, he ran away from his tribe, the Habr Gerhajis, and  engaged himself as a coaltrimmer with the slaves on board an Indian war-  steamer. After rising in rank to the command of the crew, he became  servant and interpreter to travellers, visited distant lands--Egypt and  Calcutta--and finally settled as a Feringhee policeman. He cannot read or  write, but he has all the knowledge to be acquired by fifteen or twenty  years, hard \"knocking about:\" he can make a long speech, and, although he  never prays, a longer prayer; he is an excellent mimic, and delights his  auditors by imitations and descriptions of Indian ceremony, Egyptian  dancing, Arab vehemence, Persian abuse, European vivacity, and Turkish  insolence. With prodigious inventiveness, and a habit of perpetual  intrigue, acquired in his travels, he might be called a \"knowing\" man, but  for the truly Somali weakness of showing in his countenance all that  passes through his mind. This people can hide nothing: the blank eye, the  contracting brow, the opening nostril and the tremulous lip, betray,  despite themselves, their innermost thoughts.    The second servant, whom I bring before you is Guled, another policeman at  Aden. He is a youth of good family, belonging to the Ismail Arrah, the  royal clan of the great Habr Gerhajis tribe. His father was a man of  property, and his brethren near Berberah, are wealthy Bedouins: yet he ran  away from his native country when seven or eight years old, and became a  servant in the house of a butter merchant at Mocha. Thence he went to  Aden, where he began with private service, and ended his career in the  police. He is one of those long, live skeletons, common amongst the Somal:  his shoulders are parallel with his ears, his ribs are straight as a  mummy's, his face has not an ounce of flesh upon it, and his features  suggest the idea of some lank bird: we call him Long Guled, to which he  replies with the Yemen saying \"Length is Honor, even in Wood.\" He is brave  enough, because he rushes into danger without reflection; his great  defects are weakness of body and nervousness of temperament, leading in  times of peril to the trembling of hands, the dropping of caps, and the  mismanagement of bullets: besides which, he cannot bear hunger, thirst, or  cold.    The third is one Abdy Abokr, also of the Habr Gerhajis, a personage whom,  from, his smattering of learning and his prodigious rascality, we call the  Mulla \"End of Time.\" [10] He is a man about forty, very old-looking for  his age, with small, deep-set cunning eyes, placed close together, a hook  nose, a thin beard, a bulging brow, scattered teeth, [11] and a short  scant figure, remarkable only for length of back. His gait is stealthy,  like a cat's, and he has a villanous grin. This worthy never prays, and  can neither read nor write; but he knows a chapter or two of the Koran,  recites audibly a long Ratib or task, morning and evening [12], whence,  together with his store of hashed Hadis (tradition), he derives the title  of Widad or hedge-priest. His tongue, primed with the satirical sayings of  Abn Zayd el Helali, and Humayd ibn Mansur [13], is the terror of men upon  whom repartee imposes. His father was a wealthy shipowner in his day; but,  cursed with Abdy and another son, the old man has lost all his property,  his children have deserted him, and he now depends entirely upon the  charity of the Zayla chief. The \"End of Time\" has squandered considerable  sums in travelling far and wide from Harar to Cutch, he has managed  everywhere to perpetrate some peculiar villany. He is a pleasant  companion, and piques himself upon that power of quotation which in the  East makes a polite man. If we be disposed to hurry, he insinuates that  \"Patience is of Heaven, Haste of Hell.\" When roughly addressed, he  remarks,--      \"There are cures for the hurts of lead and steel,    But the wounds of the tongue--they never heal!\"    If a grain of rice adhere to our beards, he says, smilingly, \"the gazelle  is in the garden;\" to which we reply \"we will hunt her with the five.\"  [14] Despite these merits, I hesitated to engage him, till assured by the  governor of Zayla that he was to be looked upon as a son, and, moreover,  that he would bear with him one of those state secrets to an influential  chief which in this country are never committed to paper. I found him an  admirable buffoon, skilful in filling pipes and smoking them; _au reste_,  an individual of \"many words and little work,\" infinite intrigue,  cowardice, cupidity, and endowed with a truly evil tongue.    The morning sun rose hot upon us, showing Mayyum and Zubah, the giant  staples of the \"Gate under the Pleiades.\" [15] Shortly afterwards, we came  in sight of the Barr el Ajam (barbarian land), as the Somal call their  country [16], a low glaring flat of yellow sand, desert and heat-reeking,  tenanted by the Eesa, and a meet habitat for savages. Such to us, at  least, appeared the land of Adel. [17] At midday we descried the Ras el  Bir,--Headland of the Well,--the promontory which terminates the bold  Tajurrah range, under which lie the sleeping waters of the Maiden's Sea.  [18] During the day we rigged out an awning, and sat in the shade smoking  and chatting merrily, for the weather was not much hotter than on English  summer seas. Some of the crew tried praying; but prostrations are not  easily made on board ship, and El Islam, as Umar shrewdly suspected, was  not made for a seafaring race. At length the big red sun sank slowly  behind the curtain of sky-blue rock, where lies the not yet \"combusted\"  village of Tajurrah. [19] We lay down to rest with the light of day, and  had the satisfaction of closing our eyes upon a fair though captious  breeze.    On the morning of the 31st October, we entered the Zayla Creek, which  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/689"],[0,"The Kreutzer Sonata and Other Stories (#5)"],[1,"will not forgive her a costume of an ugly  shade, without taste or fit.    \"And these things she knows by reason, where as the maiden knows them  only by instinct, like the animal. Hence these abominable jerseys, these  artificial humps on the back, these bare shoulders, arms, and throats.    \"Women, especially those who have passed through the school of marriage,  know very well that conversations upon elevated subjects are only  conversations, and that man seeks and desires the body and all that  ornaments the body. Consequently, they act accordingly? If we reject  conventional explanations, and view the life of our upper and lower  classes as it is, with all its shamelessness, it is only a vast  perversity. You do not share this opinion? Permit me, I am going to  prove it to you (said he, interrupting me).    \"You say that the women of our society live for a different interest  from that which actuates fallen women. And I say no, and I am going  to prove it to you. If beings differ from one another according to  the purpose of their life, according to their INNER LIFE, this will  necessarily be reflected also in their OUTER LIFE, and their exterior  will be very different. Well, then, compare the wretched, the despised,  with the women of the highest society: the same dresses, the same  fashions, the same perfumeries, the same passion for jewelry, for  brilliant and very expensive articles, the same amusements, dances,  music, and songs. The former attract by all possible means; so do the  latter. No difference, none whatever!    \"Yes, and I, too, was captivated by jerseys, bustles, and curly hair.\"        CHAPTER VII.    \"And it was very easy to capture me, since I was brought up under  artificial conditions, like cucumbers in a hothouse. Our too abundant  nourishment, together with complete physical idleness, is nothing but  systematic excitement of the imagination. The men of our society are  fed and kept like reproductive stallions. It is sufficient to close the  valve,--that is, for a young man to live a quiet life for some  time,--to produce as an immediate result a restlessness, which, becoming  exaggerated by reflection through the prism of our unnatural life,  provokes the illusion of love.    \"All our idyls and marriage, all, are the result for the most part of  our eating. Does that astonish you? For my part, I am astonished that  we do not see it. Not far from my estate this spring some moujiks  were working on a railway embankment. You know what a peasant's food  is,--bread, kvass,* onions. With this frugal nourishment he lives, he is  alert, he makes light work in the fields. But on the railway this bill  of fare becomes cacha and a pound of meat. Only he restores this meat by  sixteen hours of labor pushing loads weighing twelve hundred pounds.         *Kvass, a sort of cider.    \"And we, who eat two pounds of meat and game, we who absorb all sorts  of heating drinks and food, how do we expend it? In sensual excesses.  If the valve is open, all goes well; but close it, as I had closed it  temporarily before my marriage, and immediately there will result an  excitement which, deformed by novels, verses, music, by our idle and  luxurious life, will give a love of the finest water. I, too, fell in  love, as everybody does, and there were transports, emotions, poesy; but  really all this passion was prepared by mamma and the dressmakers. If  there had been no trips in boats, no well-fitted garments, etc., if  my wife had worn some shapeless blouse, and I had seen her thus at her  home, I should not have been seduced.\"        CHAPTER VIII.    \"And note, also, this falsehood, of which all are guilty; the way in  which marriages are made. What could there be more natural? The young  girl is marriageable, she should marry. What simpler, provided the young  person is not a monster, and men can be found with a desire to marry?  Well, no, here begins a new hypocrisy.    \"Formerly, when the maiden arrived at a favorable age, her marriage was  arranged by her parents. That was done, that is done still, throughout  humanity, among the Chinese, the Hindoos, the Mussulmans, and among our  common people also. Things are so managed in at least ninety-nine per  cent. of the families of the entire human race.    \"Only we riotous livers have imagined that this way was bad, and have  invented another. And this other,--what is it? It is this. The young  girls are seated, and the gentlemen walk up and down before them, as in  a bazaar, and make their choice. The maidens wait and think, but do  not dare to say: 'Take me, young man, me and not her. Look at these  shoulders and the rest.' We males walk up and down, and estimate the  merchandise, and then we discourse upon the rights of woman, upon the  liberty that she acquires, I know not how, in the theatrical halls.\"    \"But what is to be done?\" said I to him. \"Shall the woman make the  advances?\"    \"I do not know. But, if it is a question of equality, let the equality  be complete. Though it has been found that to contract marriages through  the agency of match-makers is humiliating, it is nevertheless a thousand  times preferable to our system. There the rights and the chances are  equal; here the woman is a slave, exhibited in the market. But as she  cannot bend to her condition, or make advances herself, there begins  that other and more abominable lie which is sometimes called GOING INTO  SOCIETY, sometimes AMUSING ONE'S SELF, and which is really nothing but  the hunt for a husband.    \"But say to a mother or to her daughter that they are engaged only in a  hunt for a husband. God! What an offence! Yet they can do nothing else,  and have nothing else to do; and the terrible feature of it all is to  see sometimes very young, poor, and innocent maidens haunted solely by  such ideas. If only, I repeat, it were done frankly; but it is always  accompanied with lies and babble of this sort:--    \"'Ah, the descent of species! How interesting it is!'    \"'Oh, Lily is much interested in painting.'    \"'Shall you go to the Exposition? How charming it is!'    \"'And the troika, and the plays, and the symphony. Ah, how adorable!'    \"'My Lise is passionately fond of music.'    \"'And you, why do you not share these convictions?'    \"And through all this verbiage, all have but one single idea: 'Take me,  take my Lise. No, me! Only try!\"'      CHAPTER IX.    \"Do you know,\" suddenly continued Posdnicheff, \"that this power of women  from which the world suffers arises solely from what I have just spoken  of?\"    \"What do you mean by the power of women?\" I said. \"Everybody, on the  contrary, complains that women have not sufficient rights, that they are  in subjection.\"    \"That's it; that's it exactly,\" said he, vivaciously. \"That is just what  I mean, and that is the explanation of this extraordinary phenomenon,  that on the one hand woman is reduced to the lowest degree of  humiliation and on the other hand she reigns over everything. See the  Jews: with their power of money, they avenge their subjection, just  as the women do. 'Ah! you wish us to be only merchants? All right;  remaining merchants, we will get possession of you,' say the Jews. 'Ah!  you wish us to be only objects of sensuality? All right; by the aid of  sensuality we will bend you beneath our yoke,' say the women.    \"The absence of the rights of woman does not consist in the fact that  she has not the right to vote, or the right to sit on the bench, but in  the fact that in her affectional relations she is not the equal of man,  she has not the right to abstain, to choose instead of being chosen.  You say that that would be abnormal. Very well! But then do not let man  enjoy these rights, while his companion is deprived of them, and finds  herself obliged to make use of the coquetry by which she governs, so  that the result is that man chooses 'formally,' whereas really it is  woman who chooses. As soon as she is in possession of her means, she  abuses them, and acquires a terrible supremacy.\"    \"But where do you see this exceptional power?\"    \"Where? Why, everywhere, in everything. Go see the stores in the large  cities. There are millions there, millions. It is impossible to estimate  the enormous quantity of labor that is expended there. In nine-tenths  of these stores is there anything whatever for the use of men? All the  luxury of life is demanded and sustained by woman. Count the factories;  the greater part of them are engaged in making feminine ornaments.  Millions of men, generations of slaves, die toiling like convicts simply  to satisfy the whims of our companions.    \"Women, like queens, keep nine-tenths of the human race as prisoners of  war, or as prisoners at hard labor. And all this because they have been  humiliated, because they have been deprived of rights equal to those  which men enjoy. They take revenge for our sensuality; they catch us in  their nets.    \"Yes, the whole thing is there. Women have made of themselves such a  weapon to act upon the senses that a young man, and even an old man,  cannot remain tranquil in their presence. Watch a popular festival, or  our receptions or ball-rooms. Woman well knows her influence there. You  will see it in her triumphant smiles.    \"As soon as a young man advances toward a woman, directly he falls under  the influence of this opium, and loses his head. Long ago I felt ill at  ease when I saw a woman too well adorned,--whether a woman of the people  with her red neckerchief and her looped skirt, or a woman of our own  society in her ball-room dress. But now it simply terrifies me. I see in  it a danger to men, something contrary to the laws; and I feel a desire  to call a policeman, to appeal for defence from some quarter, to demand  that this dangerous object be removed.    \"And this is not a joke, by any means. I am convinced, I am sure, that  the time will come--and perhaps it is not far distant--when the world  will understand this,"]]]
