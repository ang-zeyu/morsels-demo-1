President Johnson is  facing the middle of the coffin upon the lowest step; his hands are  crossed upon his breast, his dark clothing just revealing his plaited  shirt, and upon his full, plethoric, shaven face, broad and severely  compact, two telling gray eyes rest under a thoughtful brow, whose  turning hair is straight and smooth. Beside him are Vice-President  Hamlin, whom he succeeded, and ex-Governor King, his most intimate  friend, who lends to the ruling severity of the place a half Falstaffian  episode. The cabinet are behind, as if arranged for a daguerreotypist,  Stanton, short and quicksilvery, in long goatee and glasses, in stunted  contrast to the tall and snow-tipped shape of Mr. Welles with the rest,  practical and attentive, and at their side is Secretary Chase, high,  dignified, and handsome, with folded arms, listening, but  undemonstrative, a half-foot higher than any spectator, and dividing  with Charles Sumner, who is near by, the preference for manly beauty in  age. With Mr. Chase are other justices of the Supreme Court and to their  left, near the feet of the corpse, are the reverend senators,  representing the oldest and the newest states--splendid faces, a little  worn with early and later toils, backed up by the high, classical  features of Colonel Forney, their secretary. Beyond are the  representatives and leading officials of the various departments, with a  few odd folks like George Francis Train, exquisite as ever, and, for  this time only, with nothing to say.    Close by the corpse sit the relatives of the deceased, plain, honest,  hardy people, typical as much of the simplicity of our institutions as  of Mr. Lincoln's self-made eminence. No blood relatives of Mr. Lincoln  were to be found. It is a singular evidence of the poverty of his  origin, and therefore of his exceeding good report, that, excepting his  immediate family, none answering to his name could be discovered. Mrs.  Lincoln's relatives were present, however, in some force. Dr. Lyman  Beecher Todd, General John B. S. Todd, C. M. Smith, Esq., and Mr. N. W.  Edwards, the late President's brother-in-law, plain, self-made people  were here and were sincerely affected. Captain Robert Lincoln sat during  the services with his face in his handkerchief weeping quietly, and  little Tad his face red and heated, cried as if his heart would break.  Mrs. Lincoln, weak, worn, and nervous, did not enter the East room nor  follow the remains. She was the chief magistrate's lady yesterday;  to-day a widow bearing only an immortal name. Among the neighbors of the  late President, who came from afar to pay respect to his remains, was  one old gentleman who left Richmond on Sunday. I had been upon the boat  with him and heard him in hot wrangle with some officers who advised the  summary execution of all rebel leaders. This the old man opposed, when  the feeling against him became so intense that he was compelled to  retire. He counselled mercy, good faith, and forgiveness. To-day, the  men who had called him a traitor, saw him among the family mourners,  bent with grief. All these are waiting in solemn lines, standing erect,  with a space of several feet between them and the coffin, and there is  no bustle nor unseemly curiosity, not a whisper, not a footfall--only  the collected nation looking with awed hearts upon eminent death.    This scene is historic. I regret that I must tell you of it over a  little wire, for it admits of all exemplification. In this high,  spacious, elegant apartment, laughter and levee, social pleasantry and  refined badinage, had often held their session. Dancing and music had  made those mirrors thrill which now reflect a pall, and where the most  beautiful women of their day had mingled here with men of brilliant  favor, now only a very few, brave enough to look upon death, were  wearing funeral weeds. The pleasant face of Mrs. Kate Sprague looks out  from these; but such scenes gain little additional power by beauty's  presence. And this wonderful relief was carved at one blow by John  Wilkes Booth.    The religious services began at noon. They were remarkable not only for  their association with the national event, but for a tremendous  political energy which they had. While none of the prayers or speeches  exhibited great literary carefulness, or will obtain perpetuity on their  own merits, they were full of feeling and expressed all the intense  concern of the country.    The procession surpassed in sentiment, populousness, and sincere good  feeling, anything of the kind we have had in America. It was several  miles long, and in all its elements was full and tasteful. The scene on  the avenue will be alway remembered as the only occasion on which that  great thoroughfare was a real adornment to the seat of government. In  the tree tops, on the house tops, at all the windows, the silent and  affected crowds clustered beneath half-mast banners and waving crape, to  reverentially uncover as the dark vehicle, bearing its rich  silver-mounted coffin, swept along; mottoes of respect and homage were  on many edifices, and singularly some of them were taken from the play  of Richard III., which was the murderer's favorite part The entire width  of the avenue was swept, from curb to curb, by the deep lines.    The chief excellence of this procession was its representative nature.  All classes, localities and trades were out. As the troops in broad,  straight columns, with reversed muskets, moved to solemn marches, all  the guns on the fortifications on the surrounding hills discharged  hoarse salutes--guns which the arbiter of war whom they were to honor  could hear no longer. Every business place was closed. Sabermen swept  the street of footmen and horsemen. The carriages drove two abreast.    Not less than five thousand officers, of every rank, marched abreast  with the cortege. They were noble looking men with intelligent faces,  and represented the sinews of the land, and the music was not the least  excellent feature of the mournful display. About thirty bands were in  the line, and these played all varieties of solemn marches, so that  there were continual and mingling strains of funeral music for more than  three hours. Artillery, consisting of heavy brass pieces, followed  behind. In fact, all the citizen virtues and all the military enterprise  of the country were evidenced. Never again, until Washington becomes in  fact what it is in name, the chief city of America, shall we have a  scene like this repeated--the grandest procession ever seen on this  continent, spontaneously evoked to celebrate the foulest crime on  record. If any feeling of gratulation could arise in so calamitous a  time, it would be, that so soon after this appalling calamity the nation  calmly and collectedly rallied about its succeeding rulers, and showed  in the same moment its regret for the past and its resolution for the  future. To me, the scene in the White House, the street, and the capitol  to-day, was the strongest evidence the war afforded of the stability of  our institutions, and the worthiness and magnanimous power of our  people.    The cortege passed to the left side of the Capitol, and entering the  great gates, passed to the grand stairway, opposite the splendid dome,  where the coffin was disengaged and carried up the ascent. It was posted  under the bright concave, now streaked with mournful trappings, and left  in state, watched by guards of officers with drawn swords. This was a  wonderful spectacle, the man most beloved and honored in the ark of the  republic. The storied paintings representing eras in its history were  draped in sable, through which they seemed to cast reverential glances  upon the lamented bier. The thrilling scenes depicted by Trumbull, the  commemorative canvases of Leutze, the wilderness vegetation of Powell,  glared from their separate pedestals upon the central spot where lay the  fallen majesty of the country. Here the prayers and addresses of the  noon were rehearsed and the solemn burial service read. At night the  jets of gas concealed in the spring of the dome were lighted up, so that  their bright reflection masses of burning light, like marvelous haloes,  upon the little box where so much that we love and honor rested on its  way to the grave. And so through the starry night, in the fane of the  great Union he had strengthened and recovered, the ashes of Abraham  Lincoln, zealously guarded, are now reposing. The sage, the citizen, the  patriot, the man, has reached all the eminence that life can give the  worthy or the ambitious. The hunted fugitive who struck through our  hearts to slay him, should stand beside his stately bier to see how  powerless are bullets and blades to take the real life of any noble man!          LETTER III.    THE MURDERER.      Washington, April 27th.    Justice is satisfied, though blinder vengeance may not be. While the  illustrious murdered is on the way to the shrine, the stark corpse of  his murderer lies in the shambles. The one died quietly, like his life;  the other died fighting, like his crime. And now that over all of them  the darkness and the dew have descended, the populace, which may not be  all satisfied, may perhaps be calmed. No triumphal mourning can add to  the President's glory; no further execration can disturb the assassin's  slumbers. They have gone for what they were into history, into  tradition, into the hereafter both of men and spirits; and what they  were may be in part concluded. Mr. Lincoln's career passes, in extent,  gravity, and eventful association, the province of newspaper biography;  but Booth is the hero of a single deed, and the delineation of him may  begin and be exhausted in a single article. I have been at pains, since  the day of the President's obsequies, to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6630"],[0,"Curiosities of the Sky (#5)"],[1,"compacted, the  stars of the cluster are probably separated by millions of miles; for  we know that their distances apart are slight as compared with their  remoteness from the Earth. Sir William Herschel estimated their number  to be about fourteen thousand, but in fact they are uncountable. If we  could view them from a point just within the edge of the assemblage,  they would offer the appearance of a hollow hemisphere emblazoned with  stars of astonishing brilliancy; the near-by ones unparalleled in  splendor by any celestial object known to us, while the more distant  ones would resemble ordinary stars. An inhabitant of the cluster would  not know, except by a process of ratiocination, that he was dwelling  in a globular assemblage of suns; only from a point far outside would  their spherical arrangement become evident to the eye. Imagine  fourteen-thousand fire-balloons with an approach to regularity in a  spherical space -- say, ten miles in diameter; there would be an  average of less than thirty in every cubic mile, and it would be  necessary to go to a considerable distance in order to see them as a  globular aggregation; yet from a point sufficiently far away they  would blend into a glowing ball.    Photographs show even better than the best telescopic views that the  great cluster is surrounded with a multitude of dispersed stars,  suggestively arrayed in more or less curving lines, which radiate from  the principle mass, with which their connection is manifest. These  stars, situated outside the central sphere, look somewhat like vagrant  bees buzzing round a dense swarm where the queen bee is sitting. Yet  while there is so much to suggest the operation of central forces,  bringing and keeping the members of the cluster together, the  attentive observer is also impressed with the idea that the whole  wonderful phenomenon may be the result of explosion. As soon as this  thought seizes the mind, confirmation of it seems to be found in the  appearance of the outlying stars, which could be as readily explained  by the supposition that they have been blown apart as that they have  flocked together toward a center. The probable fact that the stars  constituting the cluster are very much smaller than our sun might be  regarded as favoring the hypothesis of an explosion. Of their real  size we know nothing, but, on the basis of an uncertain estimate of  their parallax, it has been calculated that they may average  forty-five thousand miles in diameter -- something more than half the  diameter of the planet Jupiter. Assuming the same mean density,  fourteen thousand such stars might have been formed by the explosion  of a body about twice the size of the sun. This recalls the theory of  Olbers, which has never been altogether abandoned or disproved, that  the Asteroids were formed by the explosion of a planet circulating  between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The Asteroids, whatever their  manner of origin, form a ring around the sun; but, of course, the  explosion of a great independent body, not originally revolving about  a superior center of gravitational force, would not result in the  formation of a ring of small bodies, but rather of a dispersed mass of  them. But back of any speculation of this kind lies the problem, at  present insoluble: How could the explosion be produced? (See the  question of explosions in Chapters 6 and 14).    Then, on the other hand, we have the observation of Herschel, since  abundantly confirmed, that space is unusually vacant in the immediate  neighborhood of condensed star-clusters and nebulae, which, as far as  it goes, might be taken as an indication that the assembled stars had  been drawn together by their mutual attractions, and that the tendency  to aggregation is still bringing new members toward the cluster. But  in that case there must have been an original condensation of stars at  that point in space. This could probably have been produced by the  coagulation of a great nebula into stellar nuclei, a process which  seems now to be taking place in the Orion Nebula.    A yet more remarkable globular star-cluster exists in the southern  hemisphere, Omega Centauri. In this case the central condensation of  stars presents an almost uniform blaze of light. Like the Hercules  cluster, that in Centaurus is surrounded with stars scattered over a  broad field and showing an appearance of radial arrangement. In fact,  except for its greater richness, Omega Centauri is an exact duplicate  of its northern rival. Each appears to an imaginative spectator as a  veritable ``city of suns.'' Mathematics shrinks from the task of  disentangling the maze of motions in such an assemblage. It would seem  that the chance of collisions is not to be neglected, and this idea  finds a certain degree of confirmation in the appearance of  ``temporary stars'' which have more than once blazed out in, or close  by, globular star-clusters.    This leads up to the notable fact, first established by Professor  Bailey a few years ago, that such clusters are populous with variable  stars. Omega Centauri and the Hercules cluster are especially  remarkable in this respect. The variables found in them are all of  short period and the changes of light show a noteworthy tendency to  uniformity. The first thought is that these phenomena must be due to  collisions among the crowded stars, but, if so, the encounters cannot  be between the stars themselves, but probably between stars and meteor  swarms revolving around them. Such periodic collisions might go on for  ages without the meteors being exhausted by incorporation with the  stars. This explanation appears all the more probable because one  would naturally expect that flocks of meteors would abound in a close  aggregation of stars. It is also consistent with Perrine's discovery  -- that the globular star clusters are powdered with minute stars  strewn thickly among the brighter ones.    In speaking of Professor Comstock's extraordinary theory of the Milky  Way, the fact was mentioned that, broadly speaking, the nebulae are  less numerous in the galactic belt than in the comparatively open  spaces on either side of it, but that they are, nevertheless, abundant  in the broader half of the Milky Way which he designates as the front  of the gigantic ``plough'' supposed to be forcing its way through the  enveloping chaos. In and around the Sagittarius region the  intermingling of nebulae and galactic star clouds and clusters is  particularly remarkable. That there is a causal connection no  thoughtful person can doubt. We are unable to get away from the  evidence that a nebula is like a seed-ground from which stars spring  forth; or we may say that nebulae resemble clouds in whose bosom  raindrops are forming. The wonderful aspect of the admixtures of  nebulae and star-clusters in Sagittarius has been described in Chapter  1. We now come to a still more extraordinary phenomenon of this kind  -- the Pleiades nebulae.    The group of the Pleiades, although lying outside the main course of  the Galaxy, is connected with it by a faint loop, and is the scene of  the most remarkable association of stars and nebulous matter known in  the visible universe. The naked eye is unaware of the existence of  nebulae in the Pleiades, or, at the best, merely suspects that there is  something of the kind there; and even the most powerful telescopes are  far from revealing the full wonder of the spectacle; but in  photographs which have been exposed for many hours consecutively, in  order to accumulate the impression of the actinic rays, the revelation  is stunning. The principle stars are seen surrounded by, and, as it  were, drowned in, dense nebulous clouds of an unparalleled kind. The  forms assumed by these clouds seem at first sight inexplicable. They  look like fleeces, or perhaps more like splashes and daubs of luminous  paint dashed carelessly from a brush. But closer inspection shows that  they are, to a large extent, woven out of innumerable threads of filmy  texture, and there are many indications of spiral tendencies. Each of  the bright stars of the group -- Alcyone, Merope, Maia, Electra,  Taygeta, Atlas -- is the focus of a dense fog (totally invisible,  remember, alike to the naked eye and to the telescope), and these  particular stars are veiled from sight behind the strange mists.  Running in all directions across the relatively open spaces are  nebulous wisps and streaks of the most curious forms. On some of the  nebular lines, which are either straight throughout, or if they change  direction do so at an angle, little stars are strung like beads. In  one case seven or eight stars are thus aligned, and, as if to  emphasize their dependence upon the chain which connects them, when it  makes a slight bend the file of stars turns the same way. Many other  star rows in the group suggest by their arrangement that they, too,  were once strung upon similar threads which have now disappeared,  leaving the stars spaced along their ancient tracks. We seem forced to  the conclusion that there was a time when the Pleiades were embedded  in a vast nebula resembling that of Orion, and that the cloud has now  become so rare by gradual condensation into stars that the merest  trace of it remains, and this would probably have escaped detection  but for the remarkable actinic power of the radiant matter of which it  consists. The richness of many of these faint nebulous masses in  ultra-violet radiations, which are those that specifically affect the  photographic plate, is the cause of the marvelous revelatory power of  celestial photography. So the veritable unseen universe, as  distinguished from the ``unseen universe'' of metaphysical  speculation, is shown to us.    A different kind of association between stars and nebulae is shown in  some surprising photographic objects in the constellation Cygnus,  where long, wispy nebulae, billions of miles in length, some "]]]
