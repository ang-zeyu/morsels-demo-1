These were delight, grief, desire and fear. All of  them were excited by the presence or the prospect of fancied good or  ill. What prompted desire by its prospect caused delight by its  presence, and what prompted fear by its prospect caused grief by its  presence. Thus two of the primary passions had to do with good and  two with evil. All were furies which infested the life of fools,  rendering it bitter and grievous to them; and it was the business of  philosophy to fight against them. Nor was this strife a hopeless one,  since the passions were not grounded in nature, but were due to false  opinion. They originated in voluntary judgements, and owed their  birth to a lack of mental sobriety. If men wished to live the span of  life that was allotted to them in quietness and peace, they must by  all means keep clear of the passions.    The four primary passions having been formulated, it became necessary  to justify the division by arranging the specific forms of feeling  under these four heads. In this task the Stoics displayed a subtlety  which is of more interest to the lexicographer than to the student of  philosophy. They laid great stress on the derivation of words as  affording a clue to their meaning; and, as their etymology was bound  by no principles, their ingenuity was free to indulge in the wildest  freaks of fancy.    Though all passion stood self-condemned, there were nevertheless  certain 'eupathies,' or happy affections, which would be experienced  by the ideally good and wise man. These were not perturbations of the  soul, but rather 'constancies'; they were not opposed to reason, but  were rather part of reason. Though the sage would never be  transported with delight, he would still feel an abiding 'joy' in the  presence of the true and only good; he would never indeed be agitated  by desire, but still he would be animated by 'wish,' for that was  directed only to the good; and though he would never feel fear still  he would be actuated in danger by a proper caution.    There was therefore something rational corresponding to three out of  four primary passions--against delight was to be set joy; against  grief there was nothing to be set, for that arose from the presence  of ill which would rather never attach to the sage. Grief was the  irrational conviction that one ought to afflict oneself where there  was no occasion for it. The ideal of the Stoics was the unclouded  serenity of Socrates of whom Xanthippe declared that he had always  the same face whether on leaving the house In the morning or on  returning to it at night.    As the motley crowd of passions followed the banners of their four  leaders so specific forms of feeling sanctioned by reason were  severally assigned to the three eupathies.    Things were divided by Zeno into good, bad, and indifferent. To good  belonged virtue and what partook of virtue; to bad, vice and what  partook of vice. All other things were indifferent.    To the third class then belonged such things as life and death,  health and sickness, pleasure and pain, beauty and ugliness, strength  and weakness, honour and dishonour, wealth and poverty, victory and  defeat, nobility and baseness of birth.    Good was defined as that which benefits. To confer benefit was no  less essential to good than to impart warmth was to heat. If one  asked in what 'to benefit' lay one received the reply that it lay in  producing an act or state in accordance with virtue, and similarly it  was laid down that 'to hurt' lay in producing an act or state in  accordance with vice.    The indifference of things other than virtue and vice was apparent  from the definition of good which made it essentially beneficial.  Such things as health and wealth might be beneficial or not according  to circumstances; they were therefore no more good than bad. Again,  nothing could be really good of which the good or ill depended on the  use made of it, but this was the case with things like health and  wealth.    The true and only good then was identical with what the Greeks called  'the beautiful' and what we call 'the right'. To say that a thing was  right was to say that it was good, and conversely to say that it was  good was to say that it was right; this absolute identity between the  good and the right and, on the other hand, between the bad and wrong,  was the head and front of the Stoic ethics. The right contained in  itself all that was necessary for the happy life, the wrong was the  only evil, and made men miserable whether they knew it or not.    As virtue was itself the end, it was of course choiceworthy in and  for itself, apart from hope or fear with regard to its consequences.  Moreover, as being the highest good, it could admit of no increase  from the addition of things indifferent. It did not even admit of  increase from the prolongation of its own existence, for the question  was not one of quantity, but of quality. Virtue for an eternity was  no more virtue, and therefore no more good, than virtue for a moment.  Even so one circle was no more round than another, whatever you might  choose to make its diameter, nor would it detract from the perfection  of a circle if it were to be obliterated immediately in the same dust  in which it had been drawn.    To say that the good of men lay in virtue was another way of saying  that it lay in reason, since virtue was the perfection of reason.    As reason was the only thing whereby Nature had distinguished man  from other creatures, to live the rational life was to follow Nature.    Nature was at once the law of God and the law for man. For by the  nature of anything was meant, not that which we actually find it to  be, but that which in the eternal fitness of things it was obviously  intended to become.    To be happy then was to be virtuous, to be virtuous was to be  rational, to be rational was to follow Nature, and to follow Nature  was to obey God. Virtue imparted to life that even flow in which Zeno  declared happiness to consist. This was attained when one's own  genius was in harmony with the will that disposed of all things.    Virtue having been purified from all the dross of the emotions, came  out as something purely intellectual, so that the Stoics agreed with  the Socratic conception that virtue is knowledge. They also took on  from Plato the four cardinal virtues of Wisdom, Temperance, Courage,  and Justice, and defined them as so many branches of knowledge.  Against these were set four cardinal vices of Folly, Intemperance,  Cowardice, and Injustice. Under both the virtues and vices there was  an elaborate classification of specific qualities. But  notwithstanding the care with which the Stoics divided and subdivided  the virtues, virtue, according to their doctrine, was all the time  one and indivisible. For virtue was simply reason and reason, if it  were there, must control every department of conduct alike. 'He who  has one virtue has all,' was a paradox with which the Greek thought  was already familiar. But Chrysippus went beyond this, declaring that  he who displayed one virtue did thereby display all. Neither was the  man perfect who did not possess all the virtues, nor was the act  perfect which did not involve them all. Where the virtues differed  from one another was merely in the order in which they put things.  Each was primarily itself, secondarily all the rest. Wisdom had to  determine what it was right to do, but this involved the other  virtues. Temperance had to impart stability to the impulses, but how  could the term 'temperate' be applied to a man who deserted his post  through cowardice, or who failed to return a deposit through avarice,  which is a form of injustice, or yet to one who misconducted affairs  through rashness, which falls under folly? Courage had to face  dangers and difficulties, but it was not courage unless its cause  were just. Indeed one of the ways in which courage was defined was a  virtue fighting on behalf of justice. Similarly justice put first the  assigning to each man his due, but in the act of doing so had to  bring in the other virtues. In short, it was the business of the man  of virtue to know and to do what ought to be done, for what ought to  be done implied wisdom in choice, courage in endurance, justice in  assignment and temperance in abiding by ones conviction. One virtue  never acted by itself, but always on the advice of a committee. The  obverse to this paradox--He who has one vice has all vices--was a  conclusion which the Stoics did not shrink from drawing. One might  lose part of one's Corinthian ware and still retain the rest, but to  lose one virtue--if virtue could be lost--would be to lose all along  with it.    We have now encountered the first paradox of Stoicism, and can  discern its origin in the identification of virtue with pure reason.  In getting forth the novelties in Zeno's teaching, Cicero mentions  that, while his predecessors had recognized virtues due to nature and  habit, he made all dependent upon reason. A natural consequence of  this was the reassertion of the position which Plato held or wished  to hold, namely, that virtue can be taught. But the part played by  nature in virtue cannot be ignored. It was not in the power of Zeno  to alter facts. All he could do was to legislate as to names. And  this he did vigorously. Nothing was to be called virtue which was not  of the nature of reason and knowledge, but still it had to be  admitted that nature supplied the starting points for the four  cardinal virtues--for the discovery of one's impulses, for right  endurances and harmonious distributions.    From things good and bad we now turn to things indifferent. Hitherto  the Stoic doctrine has been stern and uncompromising. We have now to  look at it under a different aspect, and to see how it tried to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7524"],[0,"The Germany and the Agricola of Tacitus (#5)"],[1,"is the sum of what I have been able to learn concerning the  origin and manners of the Germans in general. I now proceed to mention  those particulars in which they differ from each other; and likewise  to relate what nations have migrated from Germany into Gaul. That great  writer, the deified Julius, asserts that the Gauls were formerly the  superior people; [149] whence it is probable that some Gallic colonies  passed over into Germany: for how small an obstacle would a river be  to prevent any nation, as it increased in strength, from occupying or  changing settlements as yet lying in common, and unappropriated by the  power of monarchies! Accordingly, the tract betwixt the Hercynian forest  and the rivers Rhine and Mayne was possessed by the Helvetii: [150] and  that beyond, by the Boii; [151] both Gallic tribes. The name of  Boiemum still remains, a memorial of the ancient settlement, though  its inhabitants are now changed. [152] But whether the Aravisci [153]  migrated into Pannonia from the Osi, [154] a German nation; or the Osi  into Germany from the Aravisci; the language, institutions, and manners  of both being still the same, is a matter of uncertainty; for, in their  pristine state of equal indigence and equal liberty, the same advantages  and disadvantages were common to both sides of the river. The Treveri  [155] and Nervii [156] are ambitious of being thought of German origin;  as if the reputation of this descent would distinguish them from the  Gauls, whom they resemble in person and effeminacy. The Vangiones,  Triboci, and Nemetes, [157] who inhabit the bank of the Rhine, are  without doubt German tribes. Nor do the Ubii, [158] although they have  been thought worthy of being made a Roman colony, and are pleased  in bearing the name of Agrippinenses from their founder, blush to  acknowledge their origin from Germany; from whence they formerly  migrated, and for their approved fidelity were settled on the bank of  the Rhine, not that they might be guarded themselves, but that they  might serve as a guard against invaders.    29. Of all these people, the most famed for valor are the Batavi; whose  territories comprise but a small part of the banks of the Rhine, but  consist chiefly of an island within it. [159] These were formerly a  tribe of the Catti, who, on account of an intestine division, removed  to their present settlements, in order to become a part of the Roman  empire. They still retain this honor, together with a memorial of their  ancient alliance; [160] for they are neither insulted by taxes, nor  oppressed by farmers of the revenue. Exempt from fiscal burthens and  extraordinary contributions, and kept apart for military use alone,  they are reserved, like a magazine of arms, for the purposes of war. The  nation of the Mattiaci [161] is under a degree of subjection of the same  kind: for the greatness of the Roman people has carried a reverence  for the empire beyond the Rhine and the ancient limits. The Mattiaci,  therefore, though occupying a settlement and borders [162] on the  opposite side of the river, from sentiment and attachment act with us;  resembling the Batavi in every respect, except that they are animated  with a more vigorous spirit by the soil and air of their own country.  [163] I do not reckon among the people of Germany those who occupy the  Decumate lands, [164] although inhabiting between the Rhine and Danube.  Some of the most fickle of the Gauls, rendered daring through indigence,  seized upon this district of uncertain property. Afterwards,  our boundary line being advanced, and a chain of fortified posts  established, it became a skirt of the empire, and part of the Roman  province. [165]    30. Beyond these dwell the Catti, [166] whose settlements, beginning  from the Hercynian forest, are in a tract of country less open and  marshy than those which overspread the other states of Germany; for  it consists of a continued range of hills, which gradually become more  scattered; and the Hercynian forest [167] both accompanies and leaves  behind, its Catti. This nation is distinguished by hardier frames, [168]  compactness of limb, fierceness of countenance, and superior vigor of  mind. For Germans, they have a considerable share of understanding  and sagacity; they choose able persons to command, and obey them when  chosen; keep their ranks; seize opportunities; restrain impetuous  motions; distribute properly the business of the day; intrench  themselves against the night; account fortune dubious, and valor  only certain; and, what is extremely rare, and only a consequence of  discipline, depend more upon the general than the army. [169] Their  force consists entirely in infantry; who, besides their arms, are  obliged to carry tools and provisions. Other nations appear to go to  a battle; the Catti, to war. Excursions and casual encounters are rare  amongst them. It is, indeed, peculiar to cavalry soon to obtain, and  soon to yield, the victory. Speed borders upon timidity; slow movements  are more akin to steady valor.    31. A custom followed among the other German nations only by a few  individuals, of more daring spirit than the rest, is adopted by general  consent among the Catti. From the time they arrive at years of maturity  they let their hair and beard grow; [170] and do not divest themselves  of this votive badge, the promise of valor, till they have slain an  enemy. Over blood and spoils they unveil the countenance, and proclaim  that they have at length paid the debt of existence, and have proved  themselves worthy of their country and parents. The cowardly and  effeminate continue in their squalid disguise. The bravest among them  wear also an iron ring [171] (a mark of ignominy in that nation) as a  kind of chain, till they have released themselves by the slaughter of a  foe. Many of the Catti assume this distinction, and grow hoary under  the mark, conspicuous both to foes and friends. By these, in every  engagement, the attack is begun: they compose the front line, presenting  a new spectacle of terror. Even in peace they do not relax the sternness  of their aspect. They have no house, land, or domestic cares: they  are maintained by whomsoever they visit: lavish of another's property,  regardless of their own; till the debility of age renders them unequal  to such a rigid course of military virtue. [172]    32. Next to the Catti, on the banks of the Rhine, where, now settled in  its channel, it is become a sufficient boundary, dwell the Usipii and  Tencteri. [173] The latter people, in addition to the usual military  reputation, are famed for the discipline of their cavalry; nor is  the infantry of the Catti in higher estimation than the horse of the  Tencteri. Their ancestors established it, and are imitated by posterity.  Horsemanship is the sport of their children, the point of emulation of  their youth, and the exercise in which they persevere to old age. Horses  are bequeathed along with the domestics, the household gods, and the  rights of inheritance: they do not, however, like other things, go to  the eldest son, but to the bravest and most warlike.    33. Contiguous to the Tencteri were formerly the Bructeri; [174] but  report now says that the Chamavi and Angrivarii, [175] migrating into  their country, have expelled and entirely extirpated them, [176] with  the concurrence of the neighboring nations, induced either by hatred of  their arrogance, [177] love of plunder, or the favor of the gods towards  the Romans. For they even gratified us with the spectacle of a battle,  in which above sixty thousand Germans were slain, not by Roman arms,  but, what was still grander, by mutual hostilities, as it were for our  pleasure and entertainment. [178] May the nations retain and perpetuate,  if not an affection for us, at least an animosity against each other!  since, while the fate of the empire is thus urgent, [179] fortune can  bestow no higher benefit upon us, than the discord of our enemies.    34. Contiguous to the Angrivarii and Chamavi backwards lie the  Dulgibini, Chasauri, [180] and other nations less known. [181] In front,  the Frisii [182] succeed; who are distinguished by the appellations of  Greater and Lesser, from their proportional power. The settlements of  both stretch along the border of the Rhine to the ocean; and include,  besides, vast lakes, [183] which have been navigated by Roman fleets. We  have even explored the ocean itself on that side; and fame reports that  columns of Hercules [184] are still remaining on that coast; whether it  be that Hercules was ever there in reality, or that whatever great and  magnificent is anywhere met with is, by common consent, ascribed to  his renowned name. The attempt of Drusus Germanicus [185] to make  discoveries in these parts was sufficiently daring; but the ocean  opposed any further inquiry into itself and Hercules. After a while no  one renewed the attempt; and it was thought more pious and reverential  to believe the actions of the gods, than to investigate them.    35. Hitherto we have traced the western side of Germany. It turns from  thence with a vast sweep to the north: and first occurs the country of  the Chauci, [186] which, though it begins immediately from Frisia, and  occupies part of the seashore, yet stretches so far as to border on  all the nations before mentioned, till it winds round so as to meet the  territories of the Catti. This immense tract is not only possessed, but  filled by the Chauci; a people the noblest of the Germans, who choose  to maintain their greatness by justice rather than violence. Without  ambition, without ungoverned desires, quiet and retired, they provoke  no wars, they are guilty of no rapine or plunder; and it is a principal  proof of their power and bravery, that the superiority they possess has  not been acquired by unjust means. Yet all have arms in readiness; [187]  and, if necessary, an army is soon raised: for"]]]
