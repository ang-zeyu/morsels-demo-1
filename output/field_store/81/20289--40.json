With this the whole case for recrimination against man, and _a  fortiori [for greater reason]_ the case for [a] resort to violence,  collapses.    And if it does collapse, this is one of those things that carries  consequences. It would beseem man to bethink himself that to give in  to an unjustified and doubtfully honest claim is to minister to the  demoralisation of the claimant.      II    ARGUMENTS FROM INTELLECTUAL GRIEVANCES OF WOMAN    Complaint of Want of Chivalry--Complaint of \"Insults\"--Complaint of  \"Illogicalities\"--Complaint of \"Prejudices\"--The Familiar Suffragist  Grievance of the Drunkard Voter and the Woman of Property Who is a  Non-Voter--The Grievance of Woman being Required to Obey Man-Made  Laws.    We pass from the argument from elementary natural rights to a  different class of arguments--intellectual grievances. The suffragist  tells us that it is unchivalrous to oppose woman's suffrage; that it  is insulting to tell woman that she is unfit to exercise the  franchise; that it is \"illogical\" to make in her case an exception to a  general rule; that it is mere \"prejudice\" to withhold the vote from  her; that it is indignity that the virtuous and highly intelligent  woman has no vote, while the drunkard has; and that the woman of  property has no vote, while her male underlings have; and, lastly,  that it is an affront that a woman should be required to obey  \"man-made\" laws.    We may take these in their order.    Let us consider chivalry, first, from the standpoint of the woman  suffragist. Her notion of _chivalry_ is that man should accept every  disadvantageous offer which may be made to him by woman.    That, of course, is to make chivalry the principle of egalitarian  equity limited in its application to the case between man and woman.    It follows that she who holds that the suffrage ought, in obedience to  that principle of justice, to be granted to her by man, might quite  logically hold that everything else in man's gift ought also to be  conceded.    But to do the woman suffragist justice, she does not press the  argument from chivalry. Inasmuch as life has brought home to her that  the ordinary man has quite other conceptions of that virtue, she  declares that \"she has no use for it.\"    Let us now turn to the anti-suffragist view. The anti-suffragist (man  or woman) holds that chivalry is a principle which enters into every  reputable relation between the sexes, and that of all the civilising  agencies at work in the world it is the most important.    But I think I hear the reader interpose, \"What, then, is chivalry if  it is not a question of serving woman without reward?\"    A moment's thought will make the matter clear.    When a man makes this compact with a woman, \"I will do you reverence,  and protect you, and yield you service; and you, for your part, will  hold fast to an ideal of gentleness, of personal refinement, of  modesty, of joyous maternity, and to who shall say what other graces  and virtues that endear woman to man,\" that is _chivalry_.    It is not a question of a purely one-sided bargain, as in the  suffragist conception. Nor yet is it a bargain about purely material  things.    It is a bargain in which man gives both material things, and also  things which pertain perhaps somewhat to the spirit; and in which  woman gives back of these last.    But none the less it is of the nature of a contract. There is in it  the inexorable _do ut des; facio ut facias [give me this, and I will  give you that; do this for me, and I will do that for you]._    And the contract is infringed when woman breaks out into violence,  when she jettisons her personal refinement, when she is ungrateful,  and, possibly, when she places a quite extravagantly high estimate  upon her intellectual powers.    We now turn from these almost too intimate questions of personal  morality to discuss the other grievances which were enumerated above.    With regard to the suffragist's complaint that it is _\"insulting\"_ for  woman to be told that she is as a class unfit to exercise the  suffrage, it is relevant to point out that one is not insulted by  being told about oneself, or one's class, untruths, but only at being  told about oneself, or one's class, truths which one dislikes. And it  is, of course, an offence against ethics to try to dispose of an  unpalatable generalisation by characterising it as \"insulting.\" But  nothing that man could do would be likely to prevent the suffragist  resorting to this aggravated form of intellectual immorality.    We may now turn to the complaint that it is \"illogical\" to withhold  the vote from women.    This is the kind of complaint which brings out in relief the logical  endowment and legislative sagacity of the suffragist.    With regard to her logical endowment it will suffice to indicate that  the suffragist would appear to regard the promulgation of a rule which  is to hold without exception as an essentially logical act; and the  admission of any class exception to a rule of general application as  an illogicality. It would on this principle be \"illogical\" to except,  under conscription, the female population from military service.    With regard to the suffragist's legislative sagacity we may note that  she asks that we should put back the clock, and return to the days  when any arbitrary principle might be adduced as a ground for  legislation. It is as if Bentham had never taught:--    \"What is it to offer a _good reason_ with respect to a law?  It is to  allege the good or evil which the law tends to produce; so much good,  so many arguments in its favour; so much evil, so many arguments  against it.    \"What is it to offer a _false reason?_  It is the alleging for, or  against a law, something else than its good or evil effects.\"    Next, we may take up the question as to whether an unwelcome  generalisation may legitimately be got out of the way by  characterising it as a prejudice. This is a fundamentally important  question not only in connexion with such an issue as woman suffrage,  but in connexion with all search for truth in those regions where  crucial scientific experiments cannot be instituted.    In the whole of this region of thought we have to guide ourselves by  generalisations.    Now every generalisation is in a sense a _prejudgment_. We make  inferences from cases or individuals that have already presented  themselves to such cases or individuals of the same class as may  afterwards present themselves. And if our generalisation happens to be  an unfavourable one, we shall of necessity have prejudged the case  against those who are exceptions to their class.    Thus, for example, the proposition that woman is incapable of usefully  exercising the parliamentary franchise prejudges the case against a  certain number of capable women. It would none the less be absolutely  anarchical to propose to abandon the system of guiding ourselves by  prejudgments; and unfavourable prejudgments or prejudices are  logically as well justified, and are obviously as indispensable to us  as favourable prejudgments.    The suffragist who proposes to dispose of generalisations which are  unfavourable to woman as prejudices ought therefore to be told to  stand down.    It has probably never suggested itself to her that, if there were a  mind which was not stored with both favourable prejudgments and  prejudices, it would be a mind which had learned absolutely nothing  from experience.    But I hear the reader interpose, \"Is there not a grave danger that  generalisations may be erroneous?\"    And I can hear the woman suffragist interject, \"Is there not a grave  danger that unflattering generalisations about woman may be  erroneous?\"    The answer to the general question is that there is of course always  the risk that our generalisations may be erroneous. But when a  generalisation finds wide acceptance among the thoughtful, we have  come as close to truth as it is possible for humanity to come.    To the question put by the suffragist the reply is that experience  with regard to the capacity of woman has been accumulating in all  climes, and through all times; and that the belief of men in the  inherent inferiority of women in the matter of intellectual morality,  and in the power of adjudication, has never varied.    I pass now to the two most familiar grievances of the suffragist; the  grievance that the virtuous and intelligent woman has no vote, while  the male drunkard has; and the grievance that the woman of property  has no vote, while her male underlings have.    All that is worth while saying on these points is that the suffragist  is here manufacturing grievances for herself, _first_, by reasoning  from the false premiss that every legal distinction which happens to  press hardly upon a few individuals ought for that to be abrogated;  and, _secondly_, by steady leaving out of sight that logical  inconsistencies can, for the more part, be got rid of only at the  price of bringing others into being.    The man who looks forward to the intellectual development of woman  must be brought near to despair when he perceives that practically  every woman suffragist sees in every hard case arising in connexion  with a legal distinction affecting woman, an insult and example of the  iniquity of man-made laws, or a logical inconsistency which could with  a very little good-will be removed.    We have come now to the last item on our list, to the grievance that  woman has to submit herself to \"_man-made laws_.\"    This is a grievance which well rewards study. It is worth study from  the suffragist point of view, because it is the one great injury under  which all others are subsumed. And it is worth studying from the  anti-suffragist point of view, because it shows how little the  suffragist understands of the terms she employs; and how unreal are  the wrongs which she resents.

So far as Virginia is  concerned, whether or not she is in love with me, I'm no longer in love  with her and I'm damned if I'll play gigolo to spare the feelings of a  bulging red-head who carries the torch for anything in trousers, up to  and including scarecrows--myself included.\"    \"I can't allow you to talk that way about my wife, Tompkins. It's  rotten bad form and anyhow we both know that people are the way their  glands make them and nothing can be done about it.\"    \"Here, have a drink!\" I suggested. \"This is all under the seal of a  confessional. I'm not quarreling with you. I'm consulting you. I don't  love Virginia and I don't believe I ever did. If you wish to wriggle  out of your marriage, that's your affair.\"    \"And it's yours, too, ever since that night at the War Bond Ball,\" he  said. \"Don't forget that I caught you--\"    \"Rutherford,\" I replied. \"As a medical man you have surely seen far  worse than that. You can't sue me for alienation of affections, because  all Bedford Hills is aware of Virginia's glands and because it wouldn't  help your practice. For the rest, I'm willing to listen to anything as  a way out of this mess.\"    He paused in his precise pacing. \"The four of us will have to talk it  over,\" he said, \"as soon as I have that drink you offered me.\"    \"Okay,\" I agreed. \"The girls are in Jimmie's bedroom. Perhaps you know  the way better than I do. I'll follow your lead.\"    Germaine was propped up in a frilly four-poster bed amid a wallow of  small satin cushions. I barely had time to notice that she was wearing  a rather filmy night gown, when I turned to reap the whirl-wind in the  form of five foot six of red-haired determination and curves.    \"Now, Winnie,\" she commanded. \"What's all this _nonsense_?\"    I caught a tell-tale glimpse of uncharitable diamonds at my wife's  breast and hastily averted my eyes from the monogram.    \"Virginia,\" I replied, \"There's nothing wrong. Nothing at all. It was  just that yesterday I realized that I couldn't go through with it. I  don't pretend to be moral but I won't go in for mixed-doubles at my  age. It's undignified.\"    \"What!\" Mrs. Rutherford's mouth hung open in amazement.    \"Only this, Virginia. Whatever I have been in the past, I'm going to  try to be different in the future. I know it's hard on you but--\"    The red-head laughed like tumbrils rolling to the guillotine. \"Nothing  to what a breach of promise suit would be to you, Winnie dear. Don't  forget I have your letters.\"    \"Now we're getting somewhere,\" I remarked. \"How much?\"    \"Winnie!\" my wife gasped. \"It's blackmail!\"    \"Of course it's blackmail,\" I agreed, \"and there are times when it's  wiser to pay than to fight. This is not one of them. Virginia, I'm not  interested in buying back those letters. Save them for a rainy day. I'm  going to settle with your husband. How about it, Jerry?\"    \"You swine!\" Mrs. Rutherford was going definitely Grade-B in the  pinches. \"Do you think that you can drive a wedge between me and my  husband?\"    \"No, my wife has already done that for me. He loves her and he tells me  that she loves him. I've told him that they're welcome to a divorce but  I won't have my house used for any hanky-panky and won't have people  gossip about Germaine. They can make up their minds what they want to  do about it.\"    \"You were saying downstairs, Tompkins,\" the doctor hastily  interrupted, \"that you would listen to any reasonable offer.\"    \"Check! What's your price?\"    \"I want out,\" said Dr. Rutherford. \"Lend me the value of a year's  practice--fifteen thousand would cover it--and I'll get in a substitute  and take a crack at the Army Medical Corps. They've been after me for a  couple of years.\"    \"Done!\" I said, \"and if you like I'll have the bank dole it out to  Virginia while you're gone, so she won't use it up too fast.\"    \"What about me?\" asked my wife. \"I thought Jerry said he loved me.\"    \"What's _your_ price?\" I asked.    Germaine yawned and the shoulder strap of her gown slipped  indiscreetly. \"Since nobody seems to want me,\" she declared, \"I'm going  to stick around and see the fun. I wouldn't miss the sight of Winnie  Tompkins trying to lead a changed life for all the doctors in the  Medical Corps.\"    \"Me too!\" spat out Mrs. Rutherford. \"There's something pretty  mysterious going on here and I'm going to stay until I learn all the  answers.\"    There was a tap at the bedroom door and Myrtle appeared, pulling two  neatly set breakfast trays on a rubber-tired mahogany tea-wagon.    \"I thought you would rather have your breakfast upstairs with the  Master, mam,\" she remarked primly, in a far too English country-house  manner. \"Breakfast is waiting for Dr. and Mrs. Rutherford in the  dining-room,\" she added.    And as she bent over the table and began to straighten out the  breakfast things, the girl had the impudence to slip me a wink.          CHAPTER 4      After a pleasant breakfast, in the course of which my wife read the  social news in the New York Herald-Tribune and I the business news  in the New York Times, I excused myself and returned to my bedroom.  Winnie's bathroom was fitted with all the gadgets, too, and there was  an abundant choice of razors, from the old-fashioned straight-edge  suicide's favorite to the 1941 stream-lined electric Yankee clipper.  I tried out the scales and found that my involuntary host weighed  over 195 pounds--a good deal of it around the middle. Oh, well, a few  weeks of setting up exercises would take care of that. A cold shower  and a brisk rub made me feel a little more presentable and I climbed  shamelessly into Winnie's most manly tweeds.    \"Are you catching the ten o'clock, dear?\" Germaine called from her  bedroom.    \"No such luck!\" I warned her. \"Phone the office, will you, and tell  them I'm feeling under the weather and won't be in till sometime  tomorrow.\"    This seemed like a good chance to do some exploring--since the  Rutherfords had temporarily abandoned the field--though I needn't have  bothered since I had seen photographs of suburban houses like Pook's  Hill in a score of different slick-paper pre-war magazines. There was  the inevitable colonial-type dining-room, with dark wainscoting below  smooth oyster-white plaster, electric candle-sconces, and the necessary  array of family silver on the antiqued mahogany sideboard. The windows  gave a vista of brown lawn, with the grass still blasted by winter.  There was the inevitable chintzy living-room, with a permanently  unemployed grand-piano, two or three safely second-rate paintings by  safely first-rate defunct foreigners. There was the usual array of  sofas, easy chairs, small, middle-sized and biggish tables, with lots  of china ash-trays, and a sizable wood-burning fireplace. Of course,  you entered the living-room by two steps down from the front hall and  there was a separate up-two-steps-entrance to my den. And sure as death  and taxes, there was a veritable downstairs lavatory.    I slipped on my coat and hat and stepped out through a French window  which led from the living-room to the inevitable paved stone terrace.  There were galvanized iron fittings for a summer awning and in the  center was a cute little bronze sun-dial. This had an exclamation point  and the inscription, \"Over the Yard-Arm\" at the place where noon should  be, and a bronze cocktail glass instead of the sign for four p.m. All  the way around the rest of the circle was written in heavy embossed  capitals, \"The Hell With It!\"    My meditations on this facet of the Tompkins character--and I wondered  whether I oughtn't to spell 'facet' with a u'--were interrupted by  Myrtle.    \"Oh, Mr. Tompkins,\" she called from the kitchen window, in complete  repudiation of her earlier appearance as Watson, third lady's maid at  Barony Castle, \"the man from the kennels is here with Ponto. Where  shall I tell him to take the dog?\"    I hurried back indoors--there was still a chill in the air and I really  prefer my trees with their clothes on--and found a gnarled little man  who reeked of saddle-soap and servility.    \"Well, sir, Mr. Tompkins,\" he beamed the Old Retainer at me. \"That  dog of yours had a close call, a mighty close call. Thought he was a  sure-enough goner. Tried everything: injections, oxygen, iron lung,  enema. No dice. Then yesterday afternoon he just lay down and went to  sleep and I thought, 'My! Won't Mr. Tompkins feel bad!' But he woke  up, large as life and twice as natural, and began carrying on so that  I guess he wanted to come home to his folks. He's a mite weak, Mr.  Tompkins, very weak I might say, but he'll get well quicker here than  at my place and I'll pop in every other day to keep track of him. Never  did see anything like the recovery that dog made in all my born days.  Now about his bowels--\"    I waited until he had to draw a breath and made swift to congratulate  him on his professional skill. \"I wouldn't have lost Ponto for a  thousand dollars,\" I said. \"Let's get him out of your car and up in my  bedroom,\" I added. \"He's been like a member of the family and--\"    A series of deep bass backs interrupted me, followed by ominous  sounds of a heavy body hurling itself recklessly around inside a small  enclosed space.    \"There!\" said the vet. \"He recognized your voice. Come on, Ponto. I'll  fetch you. He's pretty weak, Mr. Tompkins, but he'll get strong fast if  you feed him right.\"    The vet twinkled out the front door and returned shortly, leading a  perfectly enormous coal-black Great Dane on a plaited leather leash.  Ponto did not look very weak to me, but I've always been fond of dogs  and I figured that kindness to animals might count in my favor. \"Good  dog,\" I condescended. \"Poor old fellow!\"    The poor old fellow gave a low but hungry growl and lunged for me with  bared teeth, dragging the vet behind him like a dory"]]]
