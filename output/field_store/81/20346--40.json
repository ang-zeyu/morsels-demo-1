The Prince de Carignan  made enormous profits while the delusion lasted. Each tent was let at  the rate of five hundred livres a month; and, as there were at least  five hundred of them, his monthly revenue from this source alone must  have amounted to 250,000 livres, or upwards of 10,000 pounds sterling.    The honest old soldier, Marshal Villars, was so vexed to see the folly  which had smitten his countrymen, that he never could speak with  temper on the subject. Passing one day through the Place Vendome in his  carriage, the choleric gentleman was so annoyed at the infatuation of  the people, that he abruptly ordered his coachman to stop, and, putting  his head out of the carriage window, harangued them for full half an  hour on their \"disgusting avarice.\" This was not a very wise proceeding  on his part. Hisses and shouts of laughter resounded from every side,  and jokes without number were aimed at him. There being at last strong  symptoms that something more tangible was flying through the air in  the direction of his head, Marshal was glad to drive on. He never again  repeated the experiment.    Two sober, quiet, and philosophic men of letters, M. de la Motte and the  Abbe Terrason, congratulated each other, that they, at least, were free  from this strange infatuation. A few days afterwards, as the worthy  Abbe was coming out of the Hotel de Soissons, whither he had gone to buy  shares in the Mississippi, whom should he see but his friend La Motte  entering for the same purpose. \"Ha!\" said the Abbe, smiling, \"is that  you?\" \"Yes,\" said La Motte, pushing past him as fast as he was able;  \"and can that be you?\" The next time the two scholars met, they talked  of philosophy, of science, and of religion, but neither had courage for  a long time to breathe one syllable about the Mississippi. At last, when  it was mentioned, they agreed that a man ought never to swear against  his doing any one thing, and that there was no sort of extravagance of  which even a wise man was not capable.    During this time, Law, the new Plutus, had become all at once the most  important personage of the state. The ante-chambers of the Regent were  forsaken by the courtiers. Peers, judges, and bishops thronged to the  Hotel de Soissons; officers of the army and navy, ladies of title and  fashion, and every one to whom hereditary rank or public employ gave a  claim to precedence, were to be found waiting in his ante-chambers to  beg for a portion of his India stock. Law was so pestered that he was  unable to see one-tenth part of the applicants, and every manoeuvre that  ingenuity could suggest was employed to gain access to him. Peers, whose  dignity would have been outraged if the Regent had made them wait half  an hour for an interview, were content to wait six hours for the chance  of seeing Monsieur Law. Enormous fees were paid to his servants, if  they would merely announce their names. Ladies of rank employed the  blandishments of their smiles for the same object; but many of them came  day after day for a fortnight before they could obtain an audience. When  Law accepted an invitation, he was sometimes so surrounded by ladies,  all asking to have their names put down in his lists as shareholders in  the new stock, that, in spite of his well-known and habitual gallantry,  he was obliged to tear himself away par force. The most ludicrous  stratagems were employed to have an opportunity of speaking to him. One  lady, who had striven in vain during several days, gave up in despair  all attempts to see him at his own house, but ordered her coachman to  keep a strict watch whenever she was out in her carriage, and if he saw  Mr. Law coming, to drive against a post, and upset her. The coachman  promised obedience, and for three days the lady was driven incessantly  through the town, praying inwardly for the opportunity to be overturned.  At last she espied Mr. Law, and, pulling the string, called out to the  coachman, \"Upset us now! for God's sake, upset us now!\" The coachman  drove against a post, the lady screamed, the coach was overturned,  and Law, who had seen the accident, hastened to the spot to render  assistance. The cunning dame was led into the Hotel de Soissons, where  she soon thought it advisable to recover from her fright, and, after  apologizing to Mr. Law, confessed her stratagem. Law smiled, and entered  the lady in his books as the purchaser of a quantity of India stock.  Another story is told of a Madame de Boucha, who, knowing that Mr. Law  was at dinner at a certain house, proceeded thither in her carriage, and  gave the alarm of fire. The company started from table, and Law among  the rest; but, seeing one lady making all haste into the house towards  him, while everybody else was scampering away, he suspected the trick,  and ran off in another direction.    Many other anecdotes are related, which even, though they may be a  little exaggerated, are nevertheless worth preserving, as showing the  spirit of that singular period. [The curious reader may find an anecdote  of the eagerness of the French ladies to retain Law in their company,  which will make him blush or smile according as he happens to be very  modest or the reverse. It is related in the Letters of Madame Charlotte  Elizabeth de Baviere, Duchess of Orleans, vol. ii. p. 274.] The Regent  was one day mentioning, in the presence of D'Argenson, the Abbe Dubois,  and some other persons, that he was desirous of deputing some lady, of  the rank at least of a Duchess, to attend upon his daughter at Modena;  \"but,\" added he, \"I do not exactly know where to find one.\" \"No!\"  replied one, in affected surprise; \"I can tell you where to find every  Duchess in France:--you have only to go to Mr. Law's; you will see them  every one in his ante-chamber.\"    M. de Chirac, a celebrated physician, had bought stock at an unlucky  period, and was very anxious to sell out. Stock, however continued to  fall for two or three days, much to his alarm. His mind was filled with  the subject, when he was suddenly called upon to attend a lady, who  imagined herself unwell. He arrived, was shown up stairs, and felt the  lady's pulse. \"It falls! it falls! good God! it falls continually!\" said  he, musingly, while the lady looked up in his face, all anxiety for his  opinion. \"Oh! M. de Chirac,\" said she, starting to her feet, and ringing  the bell for assistance; \"I am dying! I am dying! it falls! it falls! it  falls!\" \"What falls?\" inquired the doctor, in amazement. \"My pulse! my  pulse!\" said the lady; \"I must be dying.\" \"Calm your apprehensions, my  dear Madam,\" said M. de Chirac; \"I was speaking of the stocks. The truth  is, I have been a great loser, and my mind is so disturbed, I hardly  know what I have been saying.\"    The price of shares sometimes rose ten or twenty per cent. in the course  of a few hours, and many persons in the humbler walks of life, who had  risen poor in the morning, went to bed in affluence. An extensive holder  of stock, being taken ill, sent his servant to sell two hundred and  fifty shares, at eight thousand livres each, the price at which they  were then quoted. The servant went, and, on his arrival in the Jardin de  Soissons, found that in the interval the price had risen to ten thousand  livres. The difference of two thousand livres on the two hundred and  fifty shares, amounting to 500,000 livres, or 20,000 pounds sterling, he  very coolly transferred to his own use, and, giving the remainder to his  master, set out the same evening for another country. Law's coachman in  a very short time made money enough to set up a carriage of his own, and  requested permission to leave his service. Law, who esteemed the man,  begged of him as a favour, that he would endeavour, before he went, to  find a substitute as good as himself. The coachman consented, and in the  evening brought two of his former comrades, telling Mr. Law to choose  between them, and he would take the other. Cookmaids and footmen  were now and then as lucky, and, in the full-blown pride of their  easily-acquired wealth, made the most ridiculous mistakes. Preserving  the language and manners of their old, with the finery of their new  station, they afforded continual subjects for the pity of the sensible,  the contempt of the sober, and the laughter of everybody. But the folly  and meanness of the higher ranks of society were still more disgusting.  One instance alone, related by the Duke de St. Simon, will show the  unworthy avarice which infected the whole of society. A man of the name  of Andre, without character or education, had, by a series of well-timed  speculations in Mississippi bonds, gained enormous wealth, in an  incredibly short space of time. As St. Simon expresses it, \"he had  amassed mountains of gold.\" As he became rich, he grew ashamed of the  lowness of his birth, and anxious above all things to be allied to  nobility. He had a daughter, an infant only three years of age, and he  opened a negotiation with the aristocratic and needy family of D'Oyse,  that this child should, upon certain conditions, marry a member of that  house. The Marquis d'Oyse, to his shame, consented, and promised to  marry her himself on her attaining the age of twelve, if the father  would pay him down the sum of a hundred thousand crowns, and twenty  thousand livres every year, until the celebration of the marriage. The  Marquis was himself in his thirty-third year. This scandalous bargain  was duly signed and sealed, the stockjobber furthermore agreeing to  settle upon his daughter, on the marriage-day, a fortune of several  millions.

He wore some kind of black cloak doubtless  to conceal his movements. His silhouette resembled that of a bat. But,  gentlemen, he was neither a negro nor even a half-caste; he was of the  white races, to that I could swear.\"    Colonel Menendez lighted the cigarette which he had been busily rolling,  and fixed his dark eyes upon Harley.    \"You puzzle me, sir,\" said the latter. \"Do you wish me to believe that  this cult of Voodoo claims European or American devotees?\"    \"I wish you to believe,\" returned the Colonel, \"that although as  the result of the alarm which I gave the hotel was searched and the  Washington police exerted themselves to the utmost, no trace was ever  found of the man who had tried to murder me, except\"--he extended a  long, yellow forefinger, and pointed to the wing of the bat lying upon  Harley's table--\"a bat wing was found pinned to my bedroom door.\"    Silence fell for a while; an impressive silence. Truly this was the  strangest story to which I had ever listened.    \"How long ago was that?\" asked Harley.    \"Only two years ago. At about the time that the great war terminated. I  came to Europe and believed that at last I had found security. I lived  for a time in London amidst a refreshing peace that was new to me. Then,  chancing to hear of a property in Surrey which was available, I leased  it for a period of years, installing--is it correct?--my cousin, Madame  de Staemer, as housekeeper. Madame, alas, is an invalid, but\"--he kissed  his fingers--\"a genius. She has with her, as companion, a very  charming English girl, Miss Val Beverley, the orphaned daughter of a  distinguished surgeon of Edinburg. Miss Beverley was with my cousin in  the hospital which she established in France during the war. If you will  honour me with your presence at Cray's Folly to-morrow, gentlemen, you  will not lack congenial company, I can assure you.\"    He raised his heavy eyebrows, looking interrogatively from Harley to  myself.    \"For my own part,\" said my friend, slowly, \"I shall be delighted. What  do you say, Knox?\"    \"I also.\"    \"But,\" continued Harley, \"your presence here today, Colonel Menendez,  suggests to my mind that England has not proved so safe a haven as you  had anticipated?\"    Colonel Menendez crossed the room and stood once more before the Burmese  cabinet, one hand resting upon his hip; a massive yet graceful figure.    \"Mr. Harley,\" he replied, \"four days ago my butler, who is a Spaniard,  brought me--\" He pointed to the bat wing lying upon the blotting pad.  \"He had found it pinned to an oaken panel of the main entrance door.\"    \"Was it prior to this discovery, or after it,\" asked Harley, \"that you  detected the presence of someone lurking in the neighbourhood of the  house?\"    \"Before it.\"    \"And the burglarious entrance?\"    \"That took place rather less than a month ago. On the eve of the full  moon.\"    Paul Harley stood up and relighted his pipe.    \"There are quite a number of other details, Colonel,\" he said, \"which I  shall require you to place in my possession. Since I have determined  to visit Cray's Folly, these can wait until my arrival. I particularly  refer to a remark concerning a neighbour of yours in Surrey.\"    Colonel Menendez nodded, twirling his cigarette between his long, yellow  fingers.    \"It is a delicate matter, gentlemen,\" he confessed.    \"I must take time to consider how I shall place it before you. But I may  count upon your arrival tomorrow?\"    \"Certainly. I am looking forward to the visit with keen interest.\"    \"It is important,\" declared our visitor; \"for on Wednesday is the full  moon, and the full moon is in some way associated with the sacrificial  rites of Voodoo.\"          CHAPTER III    THE VAMPIRE BAT        An hour had elapsed since the departure of our visitor, and Paul Harley  and I sat in the cosy, book-lined study discussing the strange story  which had been related to us. Harley, who had a friend attached to  the Spanish Embassy, had succeeded in getting in touch with him at his  chambers, and had obtained some few particulars of interest concerning  Colonel Don Juan Sarmiento Menendez, for such were the full names and  titles of our late caller.    He was apparently the last representative of a once great Spanish  family, established for many generations in Cuba. His wealth was  incalculable, although the value of his numerous estates had depreciated  in recent years. His family had produced many men of subtle intellect  and powerful administrative qualities; but allied to this they had all  possessed traits of cruelty and debauchery which at one time had made  the name of Menendez a by-word in the West Indies. That there were many  people in that part of the world who would gladly have assassinated  the Colonel, Paul Harley's informant did not deny. But although this  information somewhat enlarged our knowledge of my friend's newest  client, it threw no fresh light upon that side of his story which  related to Voodoo and the extraordinary bat wing episodes.    \"Of course,\" said Harley, after a long silence, \"there is one  possibility of which we must not lose sight.\"    \"What possibility is that?\" I asked.    \"That Menendez may be mad. Remorse for crimes of cruelty committed in  his youth, and beyond doubt he has been guilty of many, may have led to  a sort of obsession. I have known such cases.\"    \"That was my first impression,\" I confessed, \"but it faded somewhat as  the Colonel's story proceeded. I don't think any such explanation would  cover the facts.\"    \"Neither do I,\" agreed my friend; \"but it is distinctly possible that  such an obsession exists, and that someone is deliberately playing upon  it for his own ends.\"    \"You mean that someone who knows of these episodes in the earlier life  of Menendez is employing them now for a secret purpose of his own?\"    \"Exactly.\"    \"It renders the case none the less interesting.\"    \"I quite agree, Knox. With you, I believe, that even if the Colonel is  not quite sane, at the same time his fears are by no means imaginary.\"    He gingerly took up the bat wing from the arm of his chair where he had  placed it after a detailed examination.    \"It seems to be pretty certain,\" he said, \"that this thing is the wing  of a Desmodus or Vampire Bat. Now, according to our authority\"--he  touched a work which lay open on the other arm of his chair--\"these are  natives of tropical America, therefore the presence of a living vampire  bat in Surrey is not to be anticipated. I am personally satisfied,  however, that this unpleasant fragment has been preserved in some way.\"    \"You mean that it is part of a specimen from someone's collection?\"    \"Quite possibly. But even a collection of such bats would be quite a  novelty. I don't know that I can recollect one outside the Museums. To  follow this bat wing business further: there was one very curious point  in the Colonel's narrative. You recollect his reference to a native girl  who had betrayed certain information to the manager of the estate?\"    I nodded rapidly.    \"A bat wing was affixed to the wall of her hut and she died, according  to our informant, of a lingering sickness. Now this lingering sickness  might have been anaemia, and anaemia may be induced, either in man or  beast, by frequent but unsuspected visits of a Vampire Bat.\"    \"Good heavens, Harley!\" I exclaimed, \"what a horrible idea.\"    \"It _is_ a horrible idea, but in countries infested by these creatures  such things happen occasionally. I distinctly recollect a story which  I once heard, of a little girl in some district of tropical America  falling into such a decline, from which she was only rescued in the nick  of time by the discovery that one of these Vampire Bats, a particularly  large one, had formed the habit of flying into her room at night and  attaching itself to her bare arm which lay outside the coverlet.\"    \"How did it penetrate the mosquito curtains?\" I enquired, incredulously.    \"The very point, Knox, which led to the discovery of the truth. The  thing, exhibiting a sort of uncanny intelligence, used to work its way  up under the edge of the netting. This disturbance of the curtains was  noticed on several occasions by the nurse who occupied an adjoining  room, and finally led to the detection of the bat!\"    \"But surely,\" I said, \"such a visitation would awaken any sleeper?\"    \"On the contrary, it induces deeper sleep. But I have not yet come to my  point, Knox. The vengeance of the High Priest of Voodoo, who figured in  the Colonel's narrative, was characteristic in the case of the native  woman, since her symptoms at least simulated those which would result  from the visits of a Vampire Bat, although of course they may have been  due to a slow poison. But you will not have failed to note that the  several attacks upon the Colonel personally were made with more ordinary  weapons. On two occasions at least a rifle was employed.\"    \"Yes,\" I replied, slowly. \"You are wondering why the lingering sickness  did not visit him?\"    \"I am, Knox. I can only suppose that he proved to be immune. You recall  his statement that he made an almost miraculous recovery from the fever  which attacked him after his visit to the Black Belt? This would seem to  point to the fact that he possesses that rare type of constitution which  almost defies organisms deadly to ordinary men.\"    \"I see. Hence the dagger and the rifle?\"    \"So it would appear.\"    \"But, Harley,\" I cried, \"what appalling crime can the man have committed  to call down upon his head a vengeance which has survived for so many  years?\"    Paul Harley shrugged his shoulders in a whimsical imitation of the  Spaniard.    \"I doubt if "]]]
