He will take your leg off, or a big 'un will bite a man in two halves.  The alligator don't go to work that way: he gets hold of your leg, and  no doubt he mangles it a bit; but he don't bite right through the bone;  he just takes hold of you and drags you down to the bottom of the river,  and keeps you there until you are drowned; then he polishes you off at  his leisure.\"    \"The brutes!\" Harry exclaimed, with deep emphasis. \"See, the first  lieutenant has hit that big fellow there in the eye or the soft skin  behind the leg; anyhow, he has got it hard; look how he is roaring and  lashing his tail.\"    \"What is the best way of killing them?\" Dick asked.    \"I have heard, sir, that in Africa the natives bait a big hook with a  lump of pork, or something of that sort; then, when an alligator has  swallowed it, they haul him up, holus bolus. I should say a good plan  to kill them would be with 'tricity. The last ship I was in, we had an  officer of the Marine Artillery who knew about such things, and he put  a big cartridge into a lump of pork, with two wires, and as soon as the  shark had swallowed it he would touch a spring or something, and there  would be an explosion. There was not as much fun in it as having a hook,  but it was quicker, and he did not do it for sport, but because he hated  the sharks. I heard say that he had had a young brother killed by one  of them. He would sit there on the taffrail for hours on the lookout  for them, with three or four loaded lumps of pork. Why, I have known him  kill as many as a dozen in a day. I expect the best part of his pay must  have gone in dynamite.    \"He had a narrow escape one day; somehow the thing went wrong, and in  trying to set it right he fell over the taffrail. The shark had bolted  the bait, but this was not enough for his appetite, and he went straight  at the officer. He had had a young ensign sitting beside him, who had  often watched his work, and knew how the thing went. I was standing near  at the time, and he began twisting some screws and things as cool as a  cucumber, though I could see as his hand shook a bit. Well, he got it  right just in time, for the shark was not half a length away from the  captain, and was turning himself over for a bite, when the thing went  off, and there was an end of the shark. The captain was a bit shaken up,  but he made a grab at the rope, and held on to it till we lowered a boat  and picked him up. He had to be got up on deck in a chair, and it was  two or three days before he was himself again. When he got round he set  to work again more earnestly than ever; and I believe that if we had  stopped in the West Indies long enough, there would not have been a  shark left in those waters.\"    \"It was a capital plan, Davis, and if we ever take possession of these  rivers, we shall have to do something of that sort to get rid of the  brutes. Are the Malays afraid of them?\"    \"I don't know, Mr. Parkhurst, but I think they are. I had a chat with a  mate I met in the Myrtle, which went home the day after we relieved them  here. He had been up some of the rivers, and told me that every village  had a bathing place palisaded off so that the alligators could not get  at the bathers.\"    \"Well, there is one thing--we shall have to be very careful when we are  out in boats, for if we were to run upon a sunken log and knock a  hole in the boat's bottom, there would not be much chance of our ever  reaching the shore.\"    \"You are about right there, sir. I aint afraid of Malays, but it gives  me the creeps down my back when I think of one of them chaps getting  hold of me by the leg. Bob Pearson told me that the only chance you have  is to send your knife, or if you can't get at that, your thumbs, into  the creature's eyes. But it would require a mighty cool hand to find the  eyes, with the brute's teeth in one's leg, and the water so thick with  mud that you could not see an inch beyond your nose.\"    \"Well, I will make a note of that, anyhow, Davis, and I will take a good  look at the next alligator I see dead, so as to know exactly where to  feel for its eyes.\"    On the second day the scenery changed. In place of the mangroves a dense  forest lined the river. Birds of lovely plumage occasionally flew across  it, and after they had anchored in the evening, the air became full of  strange noises; great beasts rose and snorted near the banks; sounds of  roaring and growling were heard in the wood; and the lads, who had been  so eager before to take part in a hunt on shore, listened with something  like awe to the various strange and often mysterious noises.    \"What in the world does it all mean, Doctor?\" Dick Balderson asked, as  the surgeon came up to the spot where the four midshipmen were leaning  on the rail.    \"It means that there is a good deal of life in the woods. That splashing  sound you hear with deep grunts and snorts, is probably made by a  hippopotamus wallowing in shallow water; but it may be a rhinoceros,  or even a buffalo. That roar is either a tiger or a panther, and that  snarling sound on the other bank is, no doubt, made by smaller animals  of the same family, indulging in a domestic quarrel. Some of the other  sounds are made by night birds of some kind or other and perhaps by  monkeys, and I fancy that distant vibrating sound that goes on without  intermission is a concert of a party of frogs.\"    \"What is that?\" as a shrill cry, as from a child, followed by a confused  outburst of cries, chattering, and, as it seemed to them, a barking  sound, followed.    \"I fancy that is the death cry of a monkey. Probably some python or  other snake has seized it in its sleep; and the other noise is the  outcry of its companions heaping abuse upon the snake, but unable to do  anything to rescue their friend.\"    \"I don't think, Doctor,\" Harry Parkhurst said, in a tone that was half  in earnest, \"that I feel so anxious as I did for sport in the forest;  and certainly I should decline to take part in it after nightfall.\"    \"I can quite understand that, lad. At night all the sounds of a tropical  forest seem mysterious and weird, but in the broad daylight the bush  will be comparatively still. The nocturnal animals will slink away to  their lairs, and there will seem nothing strange to you in the songs and  calls of the birds. I should recommend you all to take a sound dose of  quinine tonight; I have a two and a half gallon keg of the stuff mixed,  and any officer or man can go and take a glass whenever he feels he  wants it. It would be good for your nerves, as well as neutralize the  effect of the damp rising from the river. I should advise you who  are not on the watch to turn in early; it is of no use your exposing  yourselves more than is necessary to the miasma.\"    The next day progress was more rapid, for the captain found that the  assurance of the pilot that there was amply sufficient water for the  Serpent had been verified, and he therefore steamed forward at half  speed, without sending the launch on ahead to take soundings. Several  villages were passed by the way, but though the inhabitants assembled on  the banks and watched the steamer, no boats were put out, nor were any  attempts made to barter their products with the strangers.    \"It does not look as if we were popular, Mr. Ferguson,\" the captain said  to the first lieutenant. \"It may be that they object to our presence  altogether, or it may be because they believe that we are going to the  assistance of this Rajah Sehi. It certainly does not look well for the  future.\"    \"Not at all, sir. However, we shall be at the rajah's place tomorrow  morning, and shall then have a better opportunity of seeing how things  are likely to go. At any rate, he is sure to be civil for a time, and  we shall be likely to procure fruit and vegetables, which, as the  doctor says, are absolute necessities if the men are to be kept in good  health.\"    The next morning they anchored about ten o'clock opposite the campong  of the rajah. It was a good deal larger than any that they had passed on  the way up, but the houses were mere huts, with the exception of a large  wooden structure, which they at once concluded was the residence of the  rajah. As soon as the Serpent turned the last bend of the river before  reaching the place, the sound of drums and gongs was heard, and a large  boat, manned by eighteen rowers, shot out from the bank as the  anchor was dropped. The two officials on board at once mounted the  accommodation ladder, and on reaching the deck were received by the  first lieutenant, behind whom stood a guard of honor of the marines.    Upon stating that they came to express, on behalf of the rajah, the  pleasure he felt at their arrival, they were conducted to the captain's  cabin. Compliments were exchanged through the medium of the interpreter,  and a bottle of champagne was opened, and its contents appeared to  gratify the visitors. They announced that the rajah would receive the  captain that afternoon at his palace.        CHAPTER IV.      Neither of the midshipmen was present at the interview between the  captain and the rajah. The second lieutenant, the captain of the  marines, and the doctor alone accompanied him, with an escort of twenty  bluejackets and as many marines. A large crowd of people had collected  to see them pass along to the palace, which was a bare, barn-like  structure, but they looked on sullenly and silently as the party passed  through them on their way. They were kept waiting some little time  outside the building, then entered through a doorway which led them into  a large, unfurnished room, at the end of which the rajah was seated. He  rose when the officers entered, and received them with an appearance of  great cordiality, his chiefs standing behind him.    The conversation was wholly of a complimentary character; the subject  of the business on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7353"],[0,"Birds in Town & Village (#5)"],[1,"in no  sense together, and the effect was indeed curious. This is not a song  that spurts and gushes up fountain-like in the manner of the robin's,  and of some other kinds, sprinkling the listener, so to speak, with a  sparkling vocal spray; but it keeps low down, a song that flows along  the surface gurgling and prattling like musical running water, in its  shallow pebbly channel. Listening again, the similitude that seemed  appropriate at first was cast aside for another, and then another still.  The hidden singers scattered all about their rushy island were small,  fantastic, human minstrels, performing on a variety of instruments, some  unknown, others recognizable--bones and castanets, tiny hurdy-gurdies,  piccolos, banjos, tabours, and Pandean pipes--a strange medley!    Interesting as this concert was, it held me less than the solitary  singing of a sedge-warbler that lived by himself, or with only his mate,  higher up where the stream was narrow, so that I could get near him; for  he not only tickled my ears with his rapid, reedy music, but amused my  mind as well with a pretty little problem in bird psychology. I could  sit within a few yards of his tangled haunt without hearing a note; but  if I jumped up and made a noise, or struck the branches with my stick,  he would incontinently burst into song. It is a very well-known habit of  the bird, and on account of it and of the very peculiar character of the  sounds emitted, his song is frequently described by ornithologists as  \"mocking, defiant, scolding, angry,\" etc. It seems clear that at  different times the bird sings from different exciting causes. When,  undisturbed by a strange presence, he bursts spontaneously into singing,  the music, as in other species, is simply an expression of overflowing  gladness; at other times, the bird expressed such feelings as alarm,  suspicion, solicitude, perhaps anger, by singing the same song. How does  this come about?    I have stated, when speaking of the nightingale, that birds in which the  singing faculty is highly developed, sometimes make the mistake of  bursting into song when anxious or distressed or in pain, but that this  is not the case with the mocking-birds. Some species of these brilliant  songsters of the New World, in their passion for variety (to put it that  way), import every harsh and grating cry and sound they know into their  song; but, on the other hand, when anxious for the safety of their  young, or otherwise distressed, they emit only the harsh and grating  sounds--never a musical note. In the sedge-warbler, the harsh, scolding  sounds that express alarm, solicitude, and other painful emotions, have  also been made a part of the musical performance; but this differs from  the songs of most species, the mocking birds included, in the  extraordinary rapidity with which it is enunciated; once the song begins  it goes on swiftly to the finish, harsh and melodious notes seeming to  overlap and mingle, the sound forming, to speak in metaphor, a close  intricate pattern of strongly-contrasted colours. Now the song  invariably begins with the harsh notes--the sounds which, at other  times, express alarm and other more or less painful emotions--and it  strikes me as a probable explanation that when the bird in the singing  season has been startled into uttering these harsh and grating sounds,  as when a stone is flung into the rushes, he is incapable of uttering  them only, but the singing notes they suggest and which he is in the  habit of uttering, follow automatically.    The spot where I observed this wee feathered fantasy, the tantalizing  sprite of the rushes, and where I soon ceased to see, hear, or think  about him, calls for a fuller description. On one side the wooded hill  sloped downward to the stream; on the other side spread the meadows  where the rooks came every day to feed, or to sit and stand about  motionless, looking like birds cut out of jet, scattered over about half  an acre of the grassy, level ground. Stout old pollard willows grew here  and there along the banks and were pleasant to see, this being the one  man-mutilated thing in nature which, to my mind, not infrequently gains  in beauty by the mutilation, so admirably does it fit into and harmonize  with the landscape. At one point there was a deep, nearly stagnant pool,  separated from the stream by a strip of wet, rushy ground, its still  dark surface covered with water-lilies, not yet in bloom. They were just  beginning to show their polished buds, shaped like snake's heads, above  the broad, oily leaves floating like islands on the surface. The stream  itself was, on my side, fringed with bulrushes and other aquatic plants;  on the opposite bank there were some large alders lifting their branches  above great masses of bramble and rose-briar, all together forming as  rich and beautiful a tangle as one could find even in the most luxuriant  of the wild, unkept hedges round the village. The briars especially  flourished wonderfully at this spot, climbing high and dropping their  long, slim branches quite down to the surface of the water, and in some  places forming an arch above the stream. A short distance from this  tangle, so abundantly sprinkled with its pale delicate roses, the water  was spanned by a small wooden bridge, which no person appeared to use,  but which had a use. It formed the one dry clear spot in the midst of  all that moist vegetation, and the birds that came from the wood to  drink and search for worms and small caterpillars first alighted on the  bridge. There they would rest a few moments, take a look round, then fly  to some favourite spot where succulent morsels had been picked up on  previous visits. Thrushes, blackbirds, sparrows, reed-buntings,  chaffinches, tits, wrens, with many other species, succeeded each other  all day long; for now they mostly had young to provide for, and it was  their busiest time.    The unsullied beauty and solitariness of this spot made me wish at first  that I was a boy once more, to climb and to swim, to revel in the  sunshine and flowers, to be nearer in spirit to the birds and dragon  flies and water-rats; then, that I could build a cabin and live there  all the summer long, forgetful of the world and its affairs, with no  human creature to keep me company, and no book to read, or with only one  slim volume, some Spanish poet, let me say Melendez, for  preference--only a small selection from his too voluminous writings; for  he, albeit an eighteenth-century singer, was perhaps the last of that  long, illustrious line of poets who sang as no others have sung of the  pure delight-fulness of a life with nature. Something of this charm is  undoubtedly due to the beauty of the language they wrote in and to the  free, airy grace of assonants. What a hard, artificial sound the rhyme  too often has: the clink that falls at regular intervals as of a  stone-breaker's hammer! In the freer kinds of Spanish poetry there are  numberless verses that make the smoothest lines and lyrics of our  sweetest and most facile singers, from Herrick to Swinburne, seem hard  and mechanical by comparison. But there is something more. I doubt, for  one thing, if we are justified in the boast we sometimes make that the  feeling for Nature is stronger in our poets than in those of other  countries. The most scientific critic may be unable to pick a hole in  Tennyson's botany and zoology; but the passion for, and feeling of  oneness with Nature may exist without this modern minute accuracy. Be  this as it may, it was not Tennyson, nor any other of our poets, that I  would have taken to my dreamed-of solitary cabin for companionship:  Melendez came first to my mind. I think of his lines to a butterfly:      De donde alegre vienes    Tan suelta y tan festiva,    Las valles alegrando    Veloz mariposilla?*    * May be roughly rendered thus:      Whence, blithe one, comest thou    With that airy, happy flight--    To make the valleys glad,    O swift-winged butterfly?    and can imagine him--the poet himself--coming to see me through the  woods and down the hill with the careless ease and lightness of heart of  his own purple-winged child of earth and air--_tan suelta y tan  festiva_. Here in these four or five words one may read the whole secret  of his charm--the exquisite delicacy and seeming artlessness in the  form, and the spirit that is in him--the old, simple, healthy, natural  gladness in nature, and feeling of kinship with all the children of  life. But I do not wish to disturb anyone in his prepossessions. It  would greatly trouble me to think that my reader should, for the space  of a page, or even of a single line, find himself in opposition to and  not with me; and I am free to admit that with regard to poetry one's  preferences change according to the mood one happens to be in and to the  conditions generally. At home in murky London on most days I should  probably seek pleasure and forgetfulness in Browning; but in such  surroundings as I have been describing the lighter-hearted, elf-like  Melendez accords best with my spirit, one whose finest songs are without  human interest; who is irresponsible as the wind, and as unstained with  earthly care as the limpid running water he delights in: who is brother  to bird and bee and butterfly, and worships only liberty and sunshine,  and is in love with nothing but a flower.    Nearly midway between the useful little bridge and the rose-blossoming  tangle I have spoken of there were three elm-trees growing in the open  grassy space near the brook; they were not lofty, but had very  wide-spreading horizontal branches, which made them look like oaks. This  was an ideal spot in which to spend the sultry hours, and I had no  sooner cast myself on the short grass in the shade than I noticed that  the end of a projecting branch above my head, and about twenty feet from  the ground, was a favourite perch of a tree-pipit.
