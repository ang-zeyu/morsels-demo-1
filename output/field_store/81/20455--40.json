Thus, when it is said, it is the _essence_ of a stone to fall, it  is the same as saying that its descent is the necessary effect of its  gravity--of its density--of the cohesion of its parts--of the elements  of which it is composed. In short, the _essence_ of a being is its  particular, its individual nature.            CHAP. II.    _Of Motion, and its Origin._      Motion is an effect by which a body either changes, or has a tendency  to change, its position: that is to say, by which it successively  corresponds with different parts of space, or changes its relative  distance to other bodies. It is motion alone that establishes the  relation between our senses and exterior or interior beings: it is only  by motion that these beings are impressed upon us--that we know their  existence--that we judge of their properties--that we distinguish the  one from the other--that we distribute them into classes.    The beings, the substances, or the various bodies of which Nature is  the assemblage, are themselves effects of certain combinations or causes  which become causes in their turn. A CAUSE is a being which puts another  in motion, or which produces some change in it. The EFFECT is the change  produced in one body, by the motion or presence of another.    Each being, by its essence, by its peculiar nature, has the faculty of  producing, is capable of receiving, has the power of communicating, a  variety of motion. Thus some beings are proper to strike our organs;  these organs are competent to receiving the impression, are adequate to  undergoing changes by their presence. Those which cannot act on any of  our organs, either immediately and by themselves, or immediately by the  intervention of other bodies, exist not for us; since they can neither  move us, nor consequently furnish us with ideas: they can neither be  known to us, nor of course be judged of by us. To know an object, is to  have felt it; to feel it, it is requisite to have been moved by it. To  see, is to have been moved, by something acting on the visual organs;  to hear, is to have been struck, by something on our auditory nerves. In  short, in whatever mode a body may act upon us, whatever impulse we may  receive from it, we can have no other knowledge of it than by the change  it produces in us.    Nature, as we have already said, is the assemblage of all the beings,  consequently of all the motion of which we have a knowledge, as well  as of many others of which we know nothing, because they have not yet  become accessible to our senses. From the continual action and re-action  of these beings, result a series of causes and effects; or a chain  of motion guided by the constant and invariable laws peculiar to each  being; which are necessary or inherent to its particular nature--which  make it always act or move after a determinate manner. The different  principles of this motion are unknown to us, because we are in many  instances, if not in all, ignorant of what constitutes the essence of  beings. The elements of bodies escape our senses; we know them only in  the mass: we are neither acquainted with their intimate combination,  nor the proportion of these combinations; from whence must necessarily  result their mode of action, their impulse, or their different effects.    Our senses bring us generally acquainted with two sorts of motion in the  beings that surround us: the one is the motion of the mass, by which an  entire body is transferred from one place to another. Of the motion of  this genus we are perfectly sensible.--Thus, we see a stone fall, a ball  roll, an arm move, or change its position. The other is an internal or  concealed motion, which always depends on the peculiar energies of a  body: that is to say, on its _essence_, or the combination, the action,  and re-action of the minute--of the insensible particles of matter, of  which that body is composed. This motion we do not see; we know it only  by the alteration or change, which after some time we discover in  these bodies or mixtures. Of this genus is that concealed motion which  fermentation produces in the particles that compose flour, which,  however scattered, however separated, unite, and form that mass which  we call BREAD. Such also is the imperceptible motion by which we see a  plant or animal enlarge, strengthen, undergo changes, and acquire new  qualities, without our eyes being competent to follow its progression,  or to perceive the causes which have produced these effects. Such also  is the internal motion that takes place in man, which is called his  INTELLECTUAL FACULTIES, his THOUGHTS, his PASSIONS, his will. Of these  we have no other mode of judging, than by their action; that is, by  those sensible effects which either accompany or follow them. Thus, when  we see a man run away, we judge him to be interiorly actuated by the  passion of fear.    Motion, whether visible or concealed, is styled ACQUIRED, when it is  impressed on one body by another; either by a cause to which we are  a stranger, or by an exterior agent which our senses enable us to  discover. Thus we call that _acquired motion_, which the wind gives  to the sails of a ship. That motion which is excited in a body, that  contains within itself the causes of those changes we see it undergo, is  called SPONTANEOUS. Then it is said, this body acts or moves by its own  peculiar energies. Of this kind is the motion of the man who walks,  who talks, who thinks. Nevertheless, if we examine the matter a little  closer, we shall be convinced, that, strictly speaking, there is no  such thing as spontaneous motion in any of the various bodies of Nature;  seeing they are perpetually acting one upon the other; that all their  changes are to be attributed to the causes, either visible or concealed,  by which they are moved. The will of man is secretly moved or determined  by some exterior cause that produces a change in him: we believe he  moves of himself, because we neither see the cause that determined him,  the mode in which it acted, nor the organ that it put in motion.    That is called SIMPLE MOTION, which is excited in a body by a single  cause. COMPOUND MOTION, that which is produced by two or more  different causes; whether these causes are equal or unequal, conspiring  differently, acting together or in succession, known or unknown.    Let the motion of beings be of whatsoever nature it may, it is always  the necessary consequence of their essence, or of the properties which  compose them, and of those causes of which they experience the action.  Each being can only move and act after a particular manner; that is to  say, conformably to those laws which result from its peculiar essence,  its particular combination, its individual nature: in short, from its  specific energies, and those of the bodies from which it receives an  impulse. It is this that constitutes the invariable laws of motion:  I say _invariable_, because they can never change, without producing  confusion in the essence of things. It is thus that a heavy body must  necessarily fall, if it meets with no obstacle sufficient to arrest its  descent; that a sensible body must naturally seek pleasure, and avoid  pain; that fire must necessarily burn, and diffuse light.    Each being, then, has laws of motion, that are adapted to itself, and  constantly acts or moves according to these laws; at least when  no superior cause interrupts its action. Thus, fire ceases to burn  combustible matter, as soon as sufficient water is thrown into it, to  arrest its progress. Thus, a sensible being ceases to seek pleasure, as  soon as he fears that pain will be the result.    The communication of motion, or the medium of action, from one body to  another, also follows certain and necessary laws; one being can only  communicate motion to another, by the affinity, by the resemblance, by  the conformity, by the analogy, or by the point of contact, which it  has with that other being. Fire can only propagate when it finds matter  analogous to itself: it extinguishes when it encounters bodies which it  cannot embrace; that is to say, that do not bear towards it a certain  degree of relation or affinity.    Every thing in the universe is in motion: the essence of matter is to  act: if we consider its parts, attentively, we shall discover there is  not a particle that enjoys absolute repose. Those which appear to us to  be without motion, are, in fact, only in relative or apparent rest;  they experience such an imperceptible motion, and expose it so little  on their surfaces, that we cannot perceive the changes they undergo. All  that appears to us to be at rest, does not, however, remain one instant  in the same state. All beings are continually breeding, increasing,  decreasing, or dispersing, with more or less dullness or rapidity. The  insect called EPHEMERON, is produced and perishes in the same day;  of consequence, it experiences the greatest changes of its being very  rapidly, in our eyes. Those combinations which form the most solid  bodies, which appear to enjoy the most perfect repose, are nevertheless  decomposed, and dissolved in the course of time. The hardest stones, by  degrees, give way to the contact of air. A mass of iron, which time, and  the action of the atmosphere, has gnawed into rust, must have been in  motion, from the moment of its formation, in the bowels of the earth,  until the instant we behold it in this state of dissolution.    Natural philosophers, for the most part, seem not to have sufficiently  reflected on what they call the _nisus_; that is to say, the incessant  efforts one body is making on another, but which, notwithstanding  appear, to our superficial observation, to enjoy the most perfect  repose. A stone of five hundred weight seems to rest quiet on the earth,  nevertheless, it never ceases for an instant, to press with "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8910"],[0,"The System of Nature, or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World. Volume 2 (#5)"],[1,"to conceal himself from our view; that he has  rendered it impossible for us to have the least acquaintance with  him, except through the medium of nature, which he has unquestionably  rendered competent to every thing: this is the rich banquet spread  before man; he is invited to partake, with a welcome he has no right to  dispute; to enjoy therefore is to obey; to be happy is to render that  worship which must make him most acceptable; _to be happy himself is  to make others happy; to make others happy is to be virtuous; to be  virtuous he must revere truth: to know what truth is, he must examine  with caution, scrutinize with severity, every opinion he adopts:_ this  granted, is it at all consistent with the majesty of the Divinity, is it  not insulting to such a being to clothe him with our wayward passions;  to ascribe to him designs similar to our narrow view of things; to  give him our filthy desires; to suppose he can be guided by our finite  conceptions; to bring him on a level with frail humanity, by investing  him with our qualities, however much we may exaggerate them; to indulge  an opinion that he can either act or think as we do; to imagine he can  in any manner resemble such a feeble play-thing, as is the greatest, the  most distinguished man? No! it is to degrade him in the eye of reason;  to violate every regard for truth; to set moral decency at defiance; to  fall back into the depth of cimmerian darkness. Let man therefore sit  down cheerfully to the feast; let him contentedly partake of what he  finds; but let him not worry the Divinity with his useless prayers, with  his shallow-sighted requests, to solicit at his hands that which, if  granted, would in all probability be the most injurious for himself;  these supplications are, in fact, at once to say, that with our limited  experience, with our slender knowledge, we better understand what is  suitable to our condition, what is convenient to our welfare, than the  mighty _Cause of all causes_ who has left us in the hands of nature:  it is to be presumptuous in the highest degree of presumption; it is  impiously to endeavour to lift up a veil which it is evidently forbidden  man to touch; that even his most strenuous efforts attempt in vain.    It remains, then, to inquire, if man can reasonably flatter himself with  obtaining a perfect knowledge of the power of nature; of the properties  of the beings she contains; of the effects which may result from their  various combinations? Do we know why the magnet attracts iron? Are  we better acquainted with the cause of polar attraction? Are we in a  condition to explain the phenomena of light, electricity, elasticity?  Do we understand the mechanism by which that modification of our brain,  which we tall volition, puts our arm or our legs into motion? Can we  render to ourselves an account of the manner in which our eyes behold  objects, in which our ears receive sounds, in which our mind conceives  ideas? All we know upon these subjects is, that they are so. If then  we are incapable of accounting for the most ordinary phenomena, which  nature daily exhibits to us, by what chain of reasoning do we refuse to  her the power of producing other effects equally incomprehensible to  us? Shall we be more instructed, when every time we behold an effect of  which we are not in a capacity to develope the cause, we may idly say,  this effect is produced by the power, by the will of God? Undoubtedly it  is the great _Cause of causes_ must have produced every thing; but is  it not lessening the true dignity of the Divinity, to introduce him as  interfering in every operation of nature; nay, in every action of so  insignificant a creature as man? As a mere agent executing his own  eternal, immutable laws; when experience, when reflection, when the  evidence of all we contemplate, warrants the idea, that this ineffable  being has rendered nature competent to every effect, by giving her those  irrevocable laws, that eternal, unchangeable system, according to which  all the beings she contains must eternally act? Is it not more worthy  the exalted mind of the GREAT PARENT OF PARENTS, _ens entium_, more  consistent with truth, to suppose that his wisdom in giving these  immutable, these eternal laws to the macrocosm, foresaw every thing that  could possibly be requisite for the happiness of the beings contained in  it; that therefore he left it to the invariable operation of a system,  which never can produce any effect that is not the best possible that  circumstances however viewed will admit: that consequently the natural  activity of the human mind, which is itself the result of this eternal  action, was purposely given to man, that he might endeavour to  fathom, that he might strive to unravel, that he might seek out the  concatenation of these laws, in order to furnish remedies against the  evils produced by ignorance. How many discoveries in the great science  of natural philosophy has mankind progressively made, which the ignorant  prejudices of our forefathers on their first announcement considered  as impious, as displeasing to the Divinity, as heretical profanations,  which could only be expiated by the sacrifice of the enquiring  individuals; to whose labour their posterity owes such an infinity of  gratitude? Even in modern days we have seen a SOCRATES destroyed, a  GALLILEO condemned, whilst multitudes of other benefactors to mankind  have been held in contempt by their uninformed cotemporaries, for those  very researches into nature which the present generation hold in the  highest veneration. _Whenever ignorant priests are permitted to guide  the opinions of nations, science can make but a very slender progress:_  natural discoveries will be always held inimical to the interest of  bigotted superstitious men. It may, to the minds of infatuated mortals,  to the shallow comprehension of prejudiced beings, appear very pious to  reply on every occasion our gods do this, our gods do that; but to the  contemplative philosopher, to the man of reason, to the real adorers of  the great _Cause of causes_, it will never be convincing, that a sound,  a mere word, can attach the reason of things; can have more than a fixed  sense; can suffice to explain problems. The word GOD is for the most  part used to denote the impenetrable cause of those effects which  astonish mankind; which man is not competent to explain. But is not this  wilful idleness? Is it not inconsistent with our nature? Is it not being  truly impious, to sit down with those fine faculties we have received,  and give the answer of a child to every thing we do not understand; or  rather which our own sloth, or our own want of industry has prevented us  from knowing? Ought we not rather to redouble our efforts to penetrate  the cause of those phenomena which strike our mind? Is not this, in  fact, the duty we owe to the great, the universal Parent? When we have  given this answer, what have we said? nothing but what every one knows.  Could the great _Cause of causes_ make the whole, without also making  its part? But does it of necessity follow that he executes every  trifling operation, when he has so noble an agent as his own nature,  whose laws he has rendered unchangeable, whose scale of operations can  never deviate from the eternal routine he has marked out for her and all  the beings she embraces? Whose secrets, if sought out, contain the true  balsam of life--the sovereign remedy for all the diseases of man.    When we shall be ingenuous with ourselves, we shall be obliged to  agree that it was uniformly the ignorance in which our ancestors were  involved, their want of knowledge of natural causes, their unenlightened  ideas on the powers of nature, which gave birth to the gods they  worshipped; that it is, again, the impossibility which the greater  part of mankind find to withdraw, themselves out of this ignorance, the  difficulty they consequently find to form to themselves simple ideas  of the formation of things, the labour that is required to discover the  true sources of those events, which they either admire or fear, that  makes them believe these ideas are necessary to enable them to render an  account of those phenomena, to which their own sluggishness renders them  incompetent to recur. Here, without doubt, is the reason they treat all  those as irrational who do not see the necessity of admitting an unknown  agent, or some secret energy, which for want of being acquainted with  Nature, they have placed out of herself.    The phenomena of nature necessarily breed various sentiments in man:  some he thinks favorable to him, some prejudicial, while the whole  is only what it can be. Some excite his love, his admiration, his  gratitude; others fill him with trouble, cause aversion, drive him to  despair. According to the various sensations he experiences, he either  loves or fears the causes to which he attributes the effects,  which produce in him these different passions: these sentiments  are commensurate with the effects he experiences; his admiration is  enhanced, his fears are augmented, in the same ratio as the phenomena  which strikes his senses are more or less extensive, more or less  irresistible or interesting to him. Man necessarily makes himself the  centre of nature; indeed he can only judge of things, as he is himself  affected by them; he can only love that which he thinks favorable to  his being; he hates, he fears every thing which causes him to suffer:  in short, as we have seen in the former volume, he calls confusion every  thing that deranges the economy of his machine; he believes all is in  order, as soon as he experiences nothing but what is suitable to his  peculiar mode of existence. By a necessary consequence of these ideas,  man firmly believes that the entire of nature was made for him alone;  that it was only himself which she had in view in all her works; or  rather that the powerful"]]]
