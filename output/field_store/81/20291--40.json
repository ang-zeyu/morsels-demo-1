A kind physician, and without a fee,  Gave his opinion--\"Send her to the sea.\"  \"Alas!\" the good man answer'd, \"can I send  A friendless woman? Can I find a friend?  No; I must with her, in her need, repair  To that new place; the poor lie everywhere; -  Some priest will pay me for my pious pains:\" -  He said, he came, and here he yet remains.     Behold his dwelling! this poor hut he hires,  Where he from view, though not from want, retires;  Where four fair daughters, and five sorrowing sons,  Partake his sufferings, and dismiss his duns;  All join their efforts, and in patience learn  To want the comforts they aspire to earn;  For the sick mother something they'd obtain,  To soothe her grief and mitigate her pain;  For the sad father something they'd procure  To ease the burden they themselves endure.     Virtues like these at once delight and press  On the fond father with a proud distress;  On all around he looks with care and love,  Grieved to behold, but happy to approve.     Then from his care, his love, his grief, he steals,  And by himself an Author's pleasure feels:  Each line detains him; he omits not one,  And all the sorrows of his state are gone. -  Alas! even then, in that delicious hour,  He feels his fortune, and laments its power.     Some Tradesman's bill his wandering eyes engage,  Some scrawl for payment thrust 'twixt page and page;  Some bold, loud rapping at his humble door,  Some surly message he has heard before,  Awake, alarm, and tell him he is poor.     An angry Dealer, vulgar, rich, and proud,  Thinks of his bill, and, passing, raps aloud;  The elder daughter meekly makes him way -  \"I want my money, and I cannot stay:  My mill is stopp'd; what, Miss! I cannot grind;  Go tell your father he must raise the wind:\"  Still trembling, troubled, the dejected maid  Says, \"Sir! my father!\"--and then stops afraid:  E'en his hard heart is soften'd, and he hears  Her voice with pity; he respects her tears;  His stubborn features half admit a smile,  And his tone softens--\"Well! I'll wait awhile.\"  Pity! a man so good, so mild, so meek,  At such an age, should have his bread to seek;  And all those rude and fierce attacks to dread.  That are more harrowing than the want of bread;  Ah! who shall whisper to that misery peace!  And say that want and insolence shall cease?     \"But why not publish?\"--those who know too well,  Dealers in Greek, are fearful 'twill not sell;  Then he himself is timid, troubled, slow,  Nor likes his labours nor his griefs to show;  The hope of fame may in his heart have place,  But he has dread and horror of disgrace;  Nor has he that confiding, easy way,  That might his learning and himself display;  But to his work he from the world retreats,  And frets and glories o'er the favourite sheets.     But see! the Man himself; and sure I trace  Signs of new joy exulting in that face  O'er care that sleeps--we err, or we discern  Life in thy looks--the reason may we learn?     \"Yes,\" he replied, \"I'm happy, I confess,  To learn that some are pleased with happiness  Which others feel--there are who now combine  The worthiest natures in the best design,  To aid the letter'd poor, and soothe such ills as mine.  We who more keenly feel the world's contempt,  And from its miseries are the least exempt;  Now Hope shall whisper to the wounded breast  And Grief, in soothing expectation, rest.     \"Yes, I am taught that men who think, who feel,  Unite the pains of thoughtful men to heal;  Not with disdainful pride, whose bounties make  The needy curse the benefits they take;  Not with the idle vanity that knows  Only a selfish joy when it bestows;  Not with o'erbearing wealth, that, in disdain,  Hurls the superfluous bliss at groaning pain;  But these are men who yield such blest relief,  That with the grievance they destroy the grief;  Their timely aid the needy sufferers find,  Their generous manner soothes the suffering mind;  There is a gracious bounty, form'd to raise  Him whom it aids; their charity is praise;  A common bounty may relieve distress,  But whom the vulgar succour they oppress;  This though a favour is an honour too,  Though Mercy's duty, yet 'tis Merit's due;  When our relief from such resources rise,  All painful sense of obligation dies;  And grateful feelings in the bosom wake,  For 'tis their offerings, not their alms we take.     \"Long may these founts of Charity remain,  And never shrink, but to be fill'd again;  True! to the Author they are now confined,  To him who gave the treasure of his mind,  His time, his health,--and thankless found mankind:  But there is hope that from these founts may flow  A side-way stream, and equal good bestow;  Good that may reach us, whom the day's distress  Keeps from the fame and perils of the Press;  Whom Study beckons from the Ills of Life,  And they from Study; melancholy strife!  Who then can say, but bounty now so free,  And so diffused, may find its way to me?     \"Yes! I may see my decent table yet  Cheer'd with the meal that adds not to my debt;  May talk of those to whom so much we owe,  And guess their names whom yet we may not know;  Blest, we shall say, are those who thus can give,  And next who thus upon the bounty live;  Then shall I close with thanks my humble meal.  And feel so well--Oh, God! how shall I feel!\" {2}        LETTER IV.        . . . . . . . . . . . But cast your eyes again  And view those errors which new sects maintain,  Or which of old disturbed the Church's peaceful reign;  And we can point each period of the time  When they began and who begat the crime;  Can calculate how long th' eclipse endured;  Who interposed; what digits were obscured;  Of all which are already passed away  We knew the rise, the progress, and decay.

Minds are for Sects of various kinds decreed,  As diff'rent soils are formed for diff'rent seed;  Some when converted sigh in sore amaze,  And some are wrapt in joy's ecstatic blaze;  Others again will change to each extreme,  They know not why--as hurried in a dream;  Unstable, they, like water, take all forms,  Are quick and stagnant; have their calms and storms;  High on the hills, they in the sunbeams glow,  Then muddily they move debased and slow;  Or cold and frozen rest, and neither rise nor flow.     Yet none the cool and prudent Teacher prize.  On him ther dote who wakes their ectasies;  With passions ready primed such guide they meet,  And warm and kindle with th' imparted heat;  'Tis he who wakes the nameless strong desire,  The melting rapture and the glowing fire;  'Tis he who pierces deep the tortured breast,  And stirs the terrors never more to rest.     Opposed to these we have a prouder kind,  Rash without heat, and without raptures blind;  These our Glad Tidings unconcern'd peruse,  Search without awe, and without fear refuse;  The truths, the blessings found in Sacred Writ,  Call forth their spleen, and exercise their wit;  Respect from these nor saints nor martyrs gain,  The zeal they scorn, and they deride the pain:  And take their transient, cool, contemptuous view,  Of that which must be tried, and doubtless may be true.     Friends of our Faith we have, whom doubts like these,  And keen remarks, and bold objections please;  They grant such doubts have weaker minds oppress'd,  Till sound conviction gave the troubled rest.  \"But still,\" they cry, \"let none their censures spare.  They but confirm the glorious hopes we share;  From doubt, disdain, derision, scorn, and lies,  With five-fold triumph sacred Truth shall rise.\"     Yes! I allow, so Truth shall stand at last,  And gain fresh glory by the conflict past:  -  As Solway-Moss (a barren mass and cold,  Death to the seed, and poison to the fold),  The smiling plain and fertile vale o'erlaid,  Choked the green sod, and kill'd the springing blade;  That, changed by culture, may in time be seen  Enrich'd by golden grain and pasture green;  And these fair acres rented and enjoy'd  May those excel by Solway-Moss destroy'd.     Still must have mourn'd the tenant of the day,  For hopes destroy'd, and harvests swept away;  To him the gain of future years unknown,  The instant grief and suffering were his own:  So must I grieve for many a wounded heart,  Chill'd by those doubts which bolder minds impart:  Truth in the end shall shine divinely clear,  But sad the darkness till those times appear;  Contests for truth, as wars for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5225"],[0,"The Satyricon — Complete (#5)"],[1,"of  name-boards, where we saw, in cells, many persons of each sex amusing  themselves in such a manner) that it seemed to me that every one of them  must have been drinking satyrion.  (On catching sight of us, they  attempted to seduce us with paederastic wantonness, and one wretch, with  his clothes girded up, assaulted Ascyltos, and, having thrown him down  upon a couch, attempted to gore him from above.  I succored the sufferer  immediately, however,) and having joined forces, we defied the  troublesome wretch.  (Ascyltos ran out of the house and took to his  heels, leaving me as the object of their lewd attacks, but the crowd,  finding me the stronger in body and purpose, let me go unharmed.)          CHAPTER THE NINTH.    (After having tramped nearly all over the city,) I caught sight of Giton,  as though through a fog, standing at the end of the street, (on the very  threshold of the inn,) and I hastened to the same place.  When I inquired  whether my \"brother\" had prepared anything for breakfast, the boy sat  down upon the bed and wiped away the trickling tears with his thumb.  I was greatly disturbed by such conduct on the part of my \"brother,\" and  demanded to be told what had happened.  After I had mingled threats with  entreaties, he answered slowly and against his will, \"That brother or  comrade of yours rushed into the room a little while ago and commenced to  attempt my virtue by force.  When I screamed, he pulled out his tool and  gritted out--If you're a Lucretia, you've found your Tarquin!\"  When I  heard this, I shook my fists in Ascyltos' face, \"What have you to say for  yourself,\" I snarled, \"you rutting pathic harlot, whose very breath is  infected?\"  Ascyltos pretended to bristle up and, shaking his fists more  boldly still, he roared: \"Won't you keep quiet, you filthy gladiator, you  who escaped from the criminal's cage in the amphitheatre to which you  were condemned (for the murder of your host?)  Won't you hold your  tongue, you nocturnal assassin, who, even when you swived it bravely,  never entered the lists with a decent woman in your life?  Was I not a  'brother' to you in the pleasure-garden, in the same sense as that in  which this boy now is in this lodging-house?\"  \"You sneaked away from the  master's lecture,\" I objected.          CHAPTER THE TENTH.  \"What should I have done, you triple fool, when I was  dying of hunger?  I suppose I should have listened to opinions as much to  the purpose as the tinkle of broken glass or the interpretation of  dreams.  By Hercules, you are much more deserving of censure than I, you  who will flatter a poet so as to get an invitation to dinner!\"  Then we  laughed ourselves out of a most disgraceful quarrel, and approached more  peaceably whatever remained to be done.  But the remembrance of that  injury recurred to my mind and, \"Ascyltos,\" I said, \"I know we shall not  be able to agree, so let us divide our little packs of common stock and  try to defeat our poverty by our individual efforts.  Both you and I know  letters, but that I may not stand in the way of any undertaking of yours,  I will take up some other profession.  Otherwise, a thousand trifles will  bring us into daily collision and furnish cause for gossip through the  whole town.\"  Ascyltos made no objection to this, but merely remarked,  \"As we, in our capacity of scholars, have accepted an invitation to  dinner, for this date, let us not lose our night.  Since it seems to be  the graceful thing to do, I will look out for another lodging and another  'brother,' tomorrow.\"  \"Deferred pleasures are a long time coming,\"  I sighed.  It was lust that made this separation so hasty, for I had, for  a long time, wished to be rid of a troublesome chaperon, so that I could  resume my old relations with my Giton.  (Bearing this affront with  difficulty, Ascyltos rushed from the room, without uttering a word.  Such a headlong outburst augured badly, for I well knew his ungovernable  temper and his unbridled passion.  On this account, I followed him out,  desirous of fathoming his designs and of preventing their consequences,  but he hid himself skillfully from my eyes, and all in vain, I searched  for him for a long time.)          CHAPTER THE ELEVENTH.    After having had the whole town under my eyes, I returned to the little  room and, having claimed the kisses which were mine in good faith, I  encircled the boy in the closest of embraces and enjoyed the effect of  our happy vows to a point that might be envied.  Nor had all the  ceremonies been completed, when Ascyltos stole stealthily up to the  outside of the door and, violently wrenching off the bars, burst in upon  me, toying with my \"brother.\"  He filled the little room with his  laughter and hand-clapping, pulled away the cloak which covered us, \"What  are you up to now, most sanctimonious 'brother'?\"  he jeered.  \"What's  going on here, a blanket-wedding?\"  Nor did he confine himself to words,  but, pulling the strap off his bag, he began to lash me very thoroughly,  interjecting sarcasms the while, \"This is the way you would share with  your comrade, is it!\"  (The unexpectedness of the thing compelled me to  endure the blows in silence and to put up with the abuse, so I smiled at  my calamity, and very prudently, too, as otherwise I should have been put  to the necessity of fighting with a rival.  My pretended good humor  soothed his anger, and at last, Ascyltos smiled as well.  \"See here,  Encolpius,\" he said, \"are you so engrossed with your debaucheries that  you do not realize that our money is gone, and that what we have left is  of no value?  In the summer, times are bad in the city.  The country is  luckier, let's go and visit our friends.\"  Necessity compelled the  approval of this plan, and the repression of any sense of injury as well,  so, loading Giton with our packs, we left the city and hastened to the  country-seat of Lycurgus, a Roman knight.  Inasmuch as Ascyltos has  formerly served him in the capacity of \"brother,\" he received us royally,  and the company there assembled, rendered our stay still more delightful.  In the first place, there was Tryphaena, a most beautiful woman, who had  come in company with Lycas, the master of a vessel and owner of estates  near the seashore.  Although Lycurgus kept a frugal table, the pleasures  we enjoyed in this most enchanting spot cannot be described in words.  Of course you know that Venus joined us all up, as quickly as possible.  The lovely Tryphaena pleased my taste, and listened willingly to my vows,  but hardly had I had time to enjoy her favors when Lycas, in a towering  rage because his preserves had been secretly invaded, demanded that I  indemnify him in her stead.  She was an old flame of his, so he broached  the subject of a mutual exchange of favors.  Burning with lust, he  pressed his suit, but Tryphaena possessed my heart, and I said Lycas nay.  By refusal, however, he was only made more ardent, followed me  everywhere, entered my room at night, and, after his entreaties had met  with contempt, he had recourse to violence against me, at which I yelled  so lustily that I aroused the entire household, and, by the help of  Lycurgus, I was delivered from the troublesome assault and escaped.  At  last, perceiving that the house of Lycurgus was not suitable to the  prosecution of his design, he attempted to persuade me to seek his  hospitality, and when his suggestion was refused, he made use of  Tryphaena's influence over me.  She besought me to comply with Lycas'  desires, and she did this all the more readily as by that she hoped to  gain more liberty of action.  With affairs in this posture, I follow my  love, but Lycurgus, who had renewed his old relations with Ascyltos,  would not permit him to leave, so it was decided that he should remain  with Lycurgus, but that we would accompany Lycas.  Nevertheless, we had  it understood among ourselves that whenever the opportunity presented  itself, we would each pilfer whatever we could lay hands upon, for the  betterment of the common stock.  Lycas was highly delighted with my  acceptance of his invitation and hastened our departure, so, bidding our  friends good-bye, we arrived at his place on the very same day.  Lycas  had so arranged matters that, on the journey, he sat beside me, while  Tryphaena was next to Giton, the reason for this being his knowledge  of the woman's notorious inconstancy; nor was he deceived, for she  immediately fell in love with the boy, and I easily perceived it.  In addition, Lycas took the trouble of calling my attention to the  situation, and laid stress upon the truth of what we saw.  On this  account, I received his advances more graciously, at which he was  overjoyed.  He was certain that contempt would be engendered from the  inconstancy of my \"sister,\" with the result that, being piqued at  Tryphaena, I would all the more freely receive his advances.  Now this  was the state of affairs at the house of Lycas, Tryphaena was desperately  in love with Giton, Giton's whole soul was aflame for her, neither of  them was a pleasing sight to my eyes, and Lycas, studying to please me,  arranged novel entertainments each day, which Doris, his lovely wife,  seconded to the best of her ability, and so gracefully that she soon  expelled Tryphaena from my heart.  A wink of the eye acquainted Doris of  my passion, a coquettish glance informed me of the state of her heart,  and this silent language, anticipating the office of the tongue, secretly  expressed that longing of our souls which we had both experienced at the  same instant.  The jealousy of Lycas, already well known to me, was the  cause of my silence, but love itself revealed to the wife the designs  which Lycas had upon me.  At our first opportunity of exchanging  confidences, she revealed to me what she had discovered and I candidly  confessed, telling her of the coldness with which I had always met his  advances.
