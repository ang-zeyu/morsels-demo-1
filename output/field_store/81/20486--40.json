All these  points must be learned, and the best way to master them is to put into  constant practice the principles that are involved in cookery.    27. Without doubt, the first step in gaining a mastery of cookery is to  become familiar with the different methods and processes, the ways in  which they are applied, and the reasons for applying them. There are  numerous ways of cooking food, but the principal processes are boiling,  stewing, steaming, dry steaming, braizing, fricasseeing, roasting,  baking, broiling, pan broiling, frying, and sauteing. Which one of these  to use will depend on the food that is to be cooked and the result  desired. If the wrong method is employed, there will be a waste of food  material or the food will be rendered less desirable in flavor or  tenderness. For example, it would be both wasteful and undesirable to  roast a tough old fowl or to boil a tender young broiler.    The various methods of cookery just mentioned naturally divide  themselves into three groups; namely, those involving dry heat, those  requiring moist heat, and those in which hot fat is the cooking medium.      COOKING WITH DRY HEAT    28. Cooking with dry heat includes broiling, pan broiling, roasting, and  baking; but, whichever of these processes is used, the principle is  practically the same. In these processes the food is cooked by being  exposed to the source of heat or by being placed in a closed oven and  subjected to heated air. When dry heat is applied, the food to be cooked  is heated to a much greater temperature than when moist heat is used.    29. BROILING.--The cooking process known as broiling consists in  exposing directly to the source of heat the food that is to be cooked;  that is, in cooking it over or before a clear bed of coals or a gas  flame. The aim in broiling is to retain the juices of food and develop  flavor. As it is a quick method, foods that are not tender, as, for  example, tough meats, should not be broiled, because broiling does not  help to render their fibers more tender. In applying this cooking  process, which is particularly suitable for tender portions of meat and  for young fowl, the food should be exposed to intense heat at first in  order to sear all surfaces quickly and thus retain the juices. At the  beginning of the cooking, the article that is being broiled should be  turned often; then, as soon as the outside is browned, the heat should  be reduced if possible, as with a gas stove, and the article allowed to  cook until done. If the broiling is done over coals, it is necessary to  continue the turning during the entire process. While broiling produces  an especially good flavor in the foods to which it is applied, provided  they are not tough, it is not the most economical way of cooking.    30. PAN BROILING.--Pan broiling is an adaptation of the broiling method.  It consists in cooking food in a sissing-hot pan on top of the stove  without the use of fat. In this process the surfaces of the steak, chop,  or whatever the food may be, are quickly seared, after which the article  is turned frequently and cooked more slowly until done. The object of  pan broiling is the same as that of broiling, and it is resorted to, as  a rule, when the fire is not in the right condition for broiling.    31. ROASTING.--Originally, the term _to roast_ meant to cook before a  fire, because, before the time of stoves, practically all food was  cooked in the fireplace. Food that was to be roasted was placed before  the fire in a device that reflected heat, this device being open on the  side toward the fire and closed on that toward the room. The roast was  suspended in this device, slowly turned, and thus cooked by radiant  heat--that is, heat given off in the form of direct rays--the principle  being the same as that of broiling, but the application different.  Nowadays, the term _roasting_ is almost universally applied to the  action of both hot air and radiant heat. However, much of what is called  roasting is in reality baking. Foods cooked in the oven of an ordinary  coal or gas range are really baked, although they are said to be  roasted, and a covered roasting pan is a misnomer. Food must be exposed  to the air in the process of cooking if it is to be roasted in the  true sense.    It may be well to note that successful roasting or broiling depends more  on the shape of the article to be roasted or broiled than on its weight.  For this reason, thick, compact cuts of meat are usually selected for  roasting and thin cuts for broiling. Good results also depend very much  on the pan selected for the roasting process. One of the great aims in  cooking should be to save or conserve all the food possible; that is, if  by one process less waste in cooking results, it should be chosen rather  than one that will result in loss at the end of the cooking process.    32. BAKING.--By baking is meant cooking in a heated oven at temperatures  ranging from 300 to 500 degrees Fahrenheit. As the term baking is  frequently used in a wrong sense, the actual conditions of the process  should be thoroughly understood. In both broiling and the original  method of roasting, the heat is applied directly; that is, the food is  exposed directly to the source of heat. Actual baking differs from these  processes in that it is done in a closed oven or by means of heated air.  Starchy foods, such as bread, cakes, and pastry, are nearly always  baked, and gradually other foods, such as meats, fish, and vegetables  are being subjected to this method of cooking. In fact, persons who are  skilled in cooking use the oven more and more for things that they  formerly thought had to be cooked in other ways. But the name that is  applied to the process depends somewhat on custom, for while meat that  is cooked in the oven is really baked, it is usually termed roasted  meat. It seems strange, but it is nevertheless true, that ham cooked in  the oven has always been termed baked, while turkey cooked in exactly  the same way is said to be roasted.      COOKING WITH MOIST HEAT    33. The methods of cooking with moist heat, that is, through the medium  of water, are boiling, simmering, steaming, dry steaming, and braizing.  In every one of these processes, the effect of moist heat on food is  entirely different from that of dry heat. However, the method to be  selected depends to a great extent on the amount of water that the food  contains. To some foods much water must be added in the cooking process;  to others, only a little or none at all. If food is not placed directly  in large or small quantities of water, it is cooked by contact with  steam or in a utensil that is heated by being placed in another  containing boiling water, as, for example, a double boiler.    As water is such an important factor in cooking with moist heat,  something concerning its nature and use should be understood. Therefore,  before considering the moist-heat cooking processes in detail, the  function of water in the body and in cooking and also the kinds of water  are discussed.    34. FUNCTION OF WATER IN THE BODY.--Water supplies no energy to the body,  but it plays a very important part in nutrition. In fact, its particular  function in the body is to act as a solvent and a carrier of nutritive  material and waste. In doing this work, it keeps the liquids of the body  properly diluted, increases the flow of the digestive juices, and helps  to carry off waste material. However, its ability to perform these  necessary functions in the right way depends on its quality and  its safety.    35. KINDS OF WATER.--Water is either hard or soft. As it falls from the  clouds, it is pure and soft until it comes in contact with gases and  solids, which are dissolved by it and change its character. It is  definitely known that the last of the water that falls in a shower is  much better than the first, as the first cleanses not only the air, but  the roofs and other things with which it comes in contact. In passing  through certain kinds of soil or over rocks, water dissolves some of the  minerals that are contained there and is thus changed from soft to hard  water. If sewage drains into a well or water supply, the water is liable  to contain bacteria, which will render it unfit and unsafe for drinking  until it is sterilized by boiling. Besides rain water and distilled  water, there is none that is entirely soft; all other waters hold  certain salts in solution to a greater or less degree.    The quality of hardness, which is present in nearly all water, is either  temporary or permanent. Water is temporarily hard when it contains  soluble lime, which is precipitated, that is, separated from it, upon  boiling. Every housewife who uses a teakettle is familiar with this  condition. The lime precipitated day after day clings to the sides of  the vessel in which the water is boiled, and in time they become very  thickly coated. Permanent hardness is caused by other compounds of lime  that are not precipitated by boiling the water. The only way in which to  soften such water is to add to it an alkali, such as borax, washing  soda, or bicarbonate of soda.    36. USES OF WATER IN COOKING.--It is the solvent, or dissolving, power  of water that makes this liquid valuable in cooking, but of the two  kinds, soft water is preferable to hard, because it possesses greater  solvent power. This is due to the fact that hard water has already  dissolved a certain amount of material and will therefore dissolve less  of the food substances and flavors when it is used for cooking purposes  than soft water, which has dissolved nothing. It is known, too, that the  flavor of such beverages as tea and coffee is often greatly impaired by  the use of hard water. Dried beans and peas, cereals, and tough cuts of  meat will not cook tender so readily in hard water as in soft, but the  addition of a small amount of soda during the cooking of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9938"],[0,"Woman's Institute Library of Cookery. Volume 4: Salads and Sandwiches; Cold and (#5)"],[1," 41. THOUSAND ISLAND DRESSING.--By using the cooked or the uncooked  mayonnaise dressing as a basis and adding to it the ingredients listed  here, a very delightful salad dressing, called Thousand Island dressing,  is the result. All the ingredients need not be added if it is  inconvenient to do so, still the dressing is better when they are all  used. This dressing is particularly good when served with plain lettuce  salad, with lettuce and tomatoes, with lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers,  or with any other plain-vegetable salad.    THOUSAND ISLAND DRESSING    1 c. mayonnaise dressing  2 Tb. chopped green pepper  1/4 c. chilli sauce  1 Tb. chopped onion  2 Tb. chopped pimento  1 hard-cooked egg    Into the mayonnaise stir the chilli sauce, pimiento, pepper, and onion,  and lastly, add the hard-cooked egg chopped into fine pieces. Chill  and serve.    42. BOILED SALAD DRESSING.--Although boiled salad dressing is not so  great a favorite as the uncooked mayonnaise dressing, it has the  advantage of being less expensive. Then, too, it is one of the dressings  that may be made without oil, and so finds favor with those to whom oil  is not agreeable. However, oil may be substituted for the butter that is  given in the recipe. It will be noted that the preparation of this  dressing is similar to that of a custard with the addition of flour.  Since the flour requires longer cooking than the eggs, they are added  last so that there will be no danger of overcooking them. If the  dressing curdles, it may be known that the eggs have cooked too long,  but this condition may be remedied by placing the pan containing the  dressing in a pan of cold water as soon as the curdling is observed and  then beating vigorously with a rotary beater.    BOILED SALAD DRESSING    2 Tb. butter  1 tsp. mustard  2 Tb. flour  1 c. milk  1 tsp. salt  2 eggs  2 tsp. sugar  1/4 c. vinegar    Melt the butter in the inner pan of a double boiler, add the flour,  salt, sugar, mustard, and milk. Cook over the flame until the mixture is  thickened. Beat the eggs, stir them into the mixture, and add the  vinegar, beating rapidly. Place in the large pan of the double boiler  and allow this to cook until the eggs have thickened. Cool and serve.    43. SOUR-CREAM DRESSING.--Sour-cream dressing is not a very economical  one to make unless there happens to be sour cream on hand. It is,  however, a very good dressing for both fruit and vegetable salad.    SOUR-CREAM DRESSING    2 Tb. butter  1/3 c. vinegar  3 Tb. flour  1 c. sour cream  2 Tb. sugar  2 eggs  1 tsp. salt  1 c. whipped cream    Melt the butter in the upper part of a double boiler, add the flour,  sugar, salt, vinegar, and sour cream. Cook together over the flame until  the mixture thickens. Beat the egg yolks and add them to this. Place in  the lower part of the double boiler and cook until the egg yolks  thicken. Beat the egg whites and fold them with the whipped cream into  the salad dressing. Cool and serve.    44. CREAM DRESSING.--A simple dressing that requires very little time or  skill in preparation and that affords a means of using up cream that has  soured is the one given in the accompanying recipe. Sweet cream may also  be used in the same way if desired, and this makes an excellent dressing  for cabbage salad, plain cucumber salad with lettuce, or fruit salad. If  the dressing is to be used for fruit salad, lemon juice may be used in  the place of vinegar.    CREAM DRESSING    1 c. sour cream  1/2 tsp. salt  2 Tb. sugar  1/4 c. vinegar    Whip the cream with a rotary beater until it is stiff. Then add the  sugar, salt, and vinegar, and continue beating until the mixture is well  blended. Cool and serve.      VARIETIES OF SALADS AND THEIR PREPARATION           *       *       *       *       *    VEGETABLE SALADS    45. With the knowledge already obtained of the food value of the  vegetables that are generally used as ingredients in vegetable salads,  the housewife ought to have no difficulty in determining whether she is  giving her family a salad that is high or low in food value. For  instance, she should know that the food value of a plain lettuce or  cucumber salad is lower than that of one made from potatoes because of  the different values in the vegetables used.. In addition, she ought to  be familiar with the fact that the dressing added to salads has, in most  cases, greater food value than the other ingredients of the salad.  Equipped with such knowledge, she will observe that the vegetable salads  here given are comparatively low in food value. Consequently, nearly  every one of them will lend itself nicely for use with a dinner or a  comparatively heavy meal.    46. In these recipes, as well as in those for the other kinds of salad,  the proportion of ingredients may be varied according to the quantity of  the particular food in supply. For instance, if a recipe for a salad of  peas and celery calls for 1 cupful of each of these vegetables and only  3/4 cupful of celery can be obtained, there is no reason why the  difference cannot be made up by using 1 1/4 cupfuls of peas. But if such  a change is to be made, the ingredients should be increased or decreased  in the correct proportion. Then the quantity of salad that the recipe is  intended to produce will not be altered and the housewife will know just  how many the salad will serve. In the various recipes, about 1/2 cupful  of salad is the quantity allowed for each person. This may be enlarged  or made smaller in order to suit the quantity of other foods served at  the same meal.    47. ASPARAGUS SALAD--Salad in which asparagus is the chief ingredient is  one that may be served during the entire year, for either freshly cooked  or canned asparagus may be used; in fact, the canned asparagus is  considered by many persons to be better than that which is freshly  cooked. It may be cut into inch lengths or the tips may be cut down  about 4 inches from the top or even farther.    ASPARAGUS SALAD  (Sufficient to Serve Five)    Lettuce  1 pimiento  1 can asparagus  Salad dressing    Garnish salad plates with the lettuce. Place the asparagus tips in an  orderly pile on the lettuce leaf. Cut a thin strip of the pimiento, and  place this across the tips in the center. Just before serving, pour a  spoonful or two of any desired salad dressing over this or place the  salad on the table and serve the dressing, allowing each person to take  what is desired.    48. BEET-AND-BEAN SALAD.--An excellent winter salad and one that may be  made from canned or left-over vegetables is beet-and-bean salad. If  string beans happen to be left over or only part of a can remains, they  may be combined with beets that are canned or freshly cooked for the  purpose. This salad should be carefully combined just before serving,  since the beets will discolor the rest of the ingredients if it is  allowed to stand any length of time.    BEET-AND-BEAN SALAD  (Sufficient to Serve Four)    1 c. string beans  Lettuce  1 c. beets  Salad dressing    Cut the string beans into half-inch lengths and cut the beets into  half-inch dice. Season each well with salt and pepper. Just before  serving, garnish salad plates with lettuce, combine the two vegetables,  and place in a heap on a lettuce leaf. Pour French dressing or any other  salad dressing desired over them, but do not mix the salad dressing with  the vegetables.    [Illustration: FIG. 2]    49. CABBAGE SALAD.--A salad that always finds favor is made by combining  cabbage with a boiled salad dressing or with an uncooked sour-cream  dressing. Salad of this kind may be served in any desired way, but a  rather novel way to serve it is illustrated in Fig. 2. The contents of a  head of cabbage is removed, leaving four or five of the outside leaves  intact. The shell thus formed is cut into points around the top and then  filled with shredded cabbage and the dressing that is to be used. When  this is placed on a bed of lettuce, an attractive dish is the result.    To make cabbage salad, select a firm head of cabbage, pull off the  outside leaves, and wash. Cut the head in half down through the heart  and root and cut each half into quarters. Then, as shown in Fig. 3,  place each quarter on a cutting board and with a sharp knife shave off  the cabbage. If desired, however, the cabbage may be shredded with a  cabbage cutter. If the cabbage, upon being cut, is found to be wilted,  place it in cold water and let it stand until it becomes crisp. Drain  off the water carefully and allow the cabbage to drip in a colander or  dry it between pieces of old linen. With the cabbage thus prepared,  season it with salt and mix it with the desired dressing. Serve on  lettuce in a salad dish, on individual salad plates, or in the manner  shown in Fig. 2.    [Illustration: FIG. 3]    50. CABBAGE-AND-CELERY SALAD.--Cabbage and celery combine very well, for  they are similar in color and crispness. They can be procured at the  same time of the year, and while celery is not cheap, cabbage is a  comparatively inexpensive food and the two combined make an inexpensive  salad. Because the color of both is very much the same, pimiento is  added to give a contrasting color.    CABBAGE-AND-CELERY SALAD  (Sufficient to Serve Four)    1 c. cabbage  1 c. celery  1 pimiento or green pepper  1/2 tsp. salt  2 Tb. vinegar  Lettuce  Salad dressing    Cut the cabbage in the manner just explained, cut the celery into thin  pieces across the stem, and dice the green pepper or pimiento or both  into very small dice. Measure each of these, combine them, season with  the salt and vinegar, and just before serving drain carefully. Serve on  lettuce with any desired salad dressing.    51. WINTER SALAD.--A salad made entirely of winter vegetables may be  prepared when there are no fresh vegetables in supply. If any of the  vegetables are left over, the others may be prepared to use with the  left-over ones. A good plan to follow when carrots, turnips,"]]]
