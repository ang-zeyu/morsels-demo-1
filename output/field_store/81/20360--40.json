And he  walked across the Ister dry-shod, and away through the moors and fens,  day and night toward the bleak north-west, turning neither to the right  hand nor the left, till he came to the Unshapen Land, and the place which  has no name.    And seven days he walked through it, on a path which few can tell; for  those who have trodden it like least to speak of it, and those who go  there again in dreams are glad enough when they awake; till he came to  the edge of the everlasting night, where the air was full of feathers,  and the soil was hard with ice; and there at last he found the three Gray  Sisters, by the shore of the freezing sea, nodding upon a white log of  drift-wood, beneath the cold white winter moon; and they chaunted a low  song together, 'Why the old times were better than the new.'    There was no living thing around them, not a fly, not a moss upon the  rocks.  Neither seal nor sea-gull dare come near, lest the ice should  clutch them in its claws.  The surge broke up in foam, but it fell again  in flakes of snow; and it frosted the hair of the three Gray Sisters, and  the bones in the ice-cliff above their heads.  They passed the eye from  one to the other, but for all that they could not see; and they passed  the tooth from one to the other, but for all that they could not eat; and  they sat in the full glare of the moon, but they were none the warmer for  her beams.  And Perseus pitied the three Gray Sisters; but they did not  pity themselves.    So he said, 'Oh, venerable mothers, wisdom is the daughter of old age.  You therefore should know many things.  Tell me, if you can, the path to  the Gorgon.'    Then one cried, 'Who is this who reproaches us with old age?'  And  another, 'This is the voice of one of the children of men.'    And he, 'I do not reproach, but honour your old age, and I am one of the  sons of men and of the heroes.  The rulers of Olympus have sent me to you  to ask the way to the Gorgon.'    Then one, 'There are new rulers in Olympus, and all new things are bad.'  And another, 'We hate your rulers, and the heroes, and all the children  of men.  We are the kindred of the Titans, and the Giants, and the  Gorgons, and the ancient monsters of the deep.'  And another, 'Who is  this rash and insolent man who pushes unbidden into our world?'  And the  first, 'There never was such a world as ours, nor will be; if we let him  see it, he will spoil it all.'    Then one cried, 'Give me the eye, that I may see him;' and another, 'Give  me the tooth, that I may bite him.'  But Perseus, when he saw that they  were foolish and proud, and did not love the children of men, left off  pitying them, and said to himself, 'Hungry men must needs be hasty; if I  stay making many words here, I shall be starved.'  Then he stepped close  to them, and watched till they passed the eye from hand to hand.  And as  they groped about between themselves, he held out his own hand gently,  till one of them put the eye into it, fancying that it was the hand of  her sister.  Then he sprang back, and laughed, and cried--    'Cruel and proud old women, I have your eye; and I will throw it into the  sea, unless you tell me the path to the Gorgon, and swear to me that you  tell me right.'    Then they wept, and chattered, and scolded; but in vain.  They were  forced to tell the truth, though, when they told it, Perseus could hardly  make out the road.    'You must go,' they said, 'foolish boy, to the southward, into the ugly  glare of the sun, till you come to Atlas the Giant, who holds the heaven  and the earth apart.  And you must ask his daughters, the Hesperides, who  are young and foolish like yourself.  And now give us back our eye, for  we have forgotten all the rest.'    So Perseus gave them back their eye; but instead of using it, they nodded  and fell fast asleep, and were turned into blocks of ice, till the tide  came up and washed them all away.  And now they float up and down like  icebergs for ever, weeping whenever they meet the sunshine, and the  fruitful summer and the warm south wind, which fill young hearts with  joy.    But Perseus leaped away to the southward, leaving the snow and the ice  behind: past the isle of the Hyperboreans, and the tin isles, and the  long Iberian shore, while the sun rose higher day by day upon a bright  blue summer sea.  And the terns and the sea-gulls swept laughing round  his head, and called to him to stop and play, and the dolphins gambolled  up as he passed, and offered to carry him on their backs.  And all night  long the sea-nymphs sang sweetly, and the Tritons blew upon their conchs,  as they played round Galataea their queen, in her car of pearled shells.  Day by day the sun rose higher, and leaped more swiftly into the sea at  night, and more swiftly out of the sea at dawn; while Perseus skimmed  over the billows like a sea-gull, and his feet were never wetted; and  leapt on from wave to wave, and his limbs were never weary, till he saw  far away a mighty mountain, all rose-red in the setting sun.  Its feet  were wrapped in forests, and its head in wreaths of cloud; and Perseus  knew that it was Atlas, who holds the heavens and the earth apart.    He came to the mountain, and leapt on shore, and wandered upward, among  pleasant valleys and waterfalls, and tall trees and strange ferns and  flowers; but there was no smoke rising from any glen, nor house, nor sign  of man.    At last he heard sweet voices singing; and he guessed that he was come to  the garden of the Nymphs, the daughters of the Evening Star.    They sang like nightingales among the thickets, and Perseus stopped to  hear their song; but the words which they spoke he could not understand;  no, nor no man after him for many a hundred years.  So he stepped forward  and saw them dancing, hand in hand around the charmed tree, which bent  under its golden fruit; and round the tree-foot was coiled the dragon,  old Ladon the sleepless snake, who lies there for ever, listening to the  song of the maidens, blinking and watching with dry bright eyes.    Then Perseus stopped, not because he feared the dragon, but because he  was bashful before those fair maids; but when they saw him, they too  stopped, and called to him with trembling voices--    'Who are you?  Are you Heracles the mighty, who will come to rob our  garden, and carry off our golden fruit?'  And he answered--    'I am not Heracles the mighty, and I want none of your golden fruit.  Tell me, fair Nymphs, the way which leads to the Gorgon, that I may go on  my way and slay her.'    'Not yet, not yet, fair boy; come dance with us around the tree in the  garden which knows no winter, the home of the south wind and the sun.  Come hither and play with us awhile; we have danced alone here for a  thousand years, and our hearts are weary with longing for a playfellow.  So come, come, come!'    'I cannot dance with you, fair maidens; for I must do the errand of the  Immortals.  So tell me the way to the Gorgon, lest I wander and perish in  the waves.'    Then they sighed and wept; and answered--'The Gorgon! she will freeze you  into stone.'    'It is better to die like a hero than to live like an ox in a stall.  The  Immortals have lent me weapons, and they will give me wit to use them.'    Then they sighed again and answered, 'Fair boy, if you are bent on your  own ruin, be it so.  We know not the way to the Gorgon; but we will ask  the giant Atlas, above upon the mountain peak, the brother of our father,  the silver Evening Star.  He sits aloft and sees across the ocean, and  far away into the Unshapen Land.'    So they went up the mountain to Atlas their uncle, and Perseus went up  with them.  And they found the giant kneeling, as he held the heavens and  the earth apart.    They asked him, and he answered mildly, pointing to the sea-board with  his mighty hand, 'I can see the Gorgons lying on an island far away, but  this youth can never come near them, unless he has the hat of darkness,  which whosoever wears cannot be seen.'    Then cried Perseus, 'Where is that hat, that I may find it?'    But the giant smiled.  'No living mortal can find that hat, for it lies  in the depths of Hades, in the regions of the dead.  But my nieces are  immortal, and they shall fetch it for you, if you will promise me one  thing and keep your faith.'    Then Perseus promised; and the giant said, 'When you come back with the  head of Medusa, you shall show me the beautiful horror, that I may lose  my feeling and my breathing, and become a stone for ever; for it is weary  labour for me to hold the heavens and the earth apart.'    Then Perseus promised, and the eldest of the Nymphs went down, and into a  dark cavern among the cliffs, out of which came smoke and thunder, for it  was one of the mouths of Hell.    And Perseus and the Nymphs sat down seven days, and waited trembling,  till the Nymph came up again; and her face was pale, and her eyes dazzled  with the light, for she had been long in the dreary darkness; but in her  hand was the magic hat.    Then all the Nymphs kissed Perseus, and wept over him a long while; but  he was only impatient to be gone.  And at last they put the hat upon his  head, and he vanished out of their sight.    But Perseus went on boldly, past many an ugly sight, far away into the  heart of the Unshapen Land, beyond the streams of Ocean, to the isles  where no ship cruises, where is neither night nor day, where nothing is  in its right place, and nothing has a name; till he heard the rustle of  the Gorgons' wings and saw the glitter of their brazen talons; and then  he knew that it was time to halt, lest Medusa should freeze him into  stone.    He thought awhile with himself, and remembered Athene's words.  He rose  aloft into the air, and held the mirror of the shield above his head, and  looked up into it that he might see all that was below him.

There will be a victory,  my fine fellow, when they return and are restored to their lands, and  are able to rebuild Jerusalem. Then make a clean sweep of the Turks out  of Asia while the iron is hot, hew cedars in Lebanon, build ships, and  then the whole nation shall chaffer with old clothes and old lace  throughout the world. Meanwhile--    CHARLES VON M. (smiles and takes him by the hand). Comrade! There must  be an end now of our fooleries.    SPIEGEL. (with surprise). Fie! you are not going to play the prodigal  son!--a fellow like you who with his sword has scratched more  hieroglyhics on other men's faces than three quill-drivers could  inscribe in their daybooks in a leap-year! Shall I tell you the story  of the great dog funeral? Ha! I must just bring back your own picture  to your mind; that will kindle fire in your veins, if nothing else has  power to inspire you. Do you remember how the heads of the college  caused your dog's leg to be shot off, and you, by way of revenge,  proclaimed a fast through the whole town? They fumed and fretted at  your edict. But you, without losing time, ordered all the meat to be  bought up in Leipsic, so that in the course of eight hours there was not  a bone left to pick all over the place, and even fish began to rise in  price. The magistrates and the town council vowed vengeance. But we  students turned out lustily, seventeen hundred of us, with you at our  head, and butchers and tailors and haberdashers at our backs, besides  publicans, barbers, and rabble of all sorts, swearing that the town  should be sacked if a single hair of a student's head was injured. And  so the affair went off like the shooting at Hornberg,* and they were  obliged to be off with their tails between their legs.       *[The \"shooting at Hornberg\" is a proverbial expression in Germany     for any expedition from which, through lack of courage, the parties     retire without firing a shot.]    You sent for doctors--a whole posse of them--and offered three ducats to  any one who would write a prescription for your dog. We were afraid the  gentlemen would stand too much upon honor and refuse, and had already  made up our minds to use force. But this was quite unnecessary; the  doctors got to fisticuffs for the three ducats, and their competition  brought down the price to three groats; in the course of an hour a dozen  prescriptions were written, of which, of course, the poor beast very  soon died.    CHARLES VON M. The vile rascals.    SPIEGEL. The funeral procession was arranged with all due pomp; odes  for the dog were indited by the gross; and at night we all turned out,  near a thousand of us, a lantern in one hand and our rapier in the  other, and so proceeded through the town, the bells chiming and ringing,  till the dog was entombed. Then came a feed which lasted till broad  daylight, when you sent your acknowledgments to the college dons for  their kind sympathy, and ordered the meat to be sold at half-price.  _Mort de ma vie_, if we had not as great a respect for you as a garrison  for the conqueror of a fortress.    CHARLES VON M. And are you not ashamed to boast of these things? Have  you not shame enough in you to blush even at the recollection of such  pranks?    SPIEGEL. Come, come! You are no longer the same Moor. Do you remember  how, a thousand times, bottle in hand, you made game of the miserly old  governor, bidding him by all means rake and scrape together as much as  he could, for that you would swill it all down your throat? Don't you  remember, eh?--don't you remember?' O you good-for-nothing, miserable  braggart! that was speaking like a man, and a gentleman, but--    CHARLES VON M. A curse on you for reminding me of it! A curse on myself  for what I said! But it was done in the fumes of wine, and my heart  knew not what my tongue uttered.    SPIEGEL. (shakes his head). No, no! that cannot be! Impossible,  brother! You are not in earnest! Tell me! most sweet brother, is it  not poverty which has brought you to this mood? Come! let me tell you a  little story of my youthful days. There was a ditch close to my house,  eight feet wide at the least, which we boys were trying to leap over for  a wager. But it was no go. Splash! there you lay sprawling, amidst  hisses and roars of laughter, and a relentless shower of snowballs. By  the side of my house a hunter's dog was lying chained, a savage beast,  which would catch the girls by their petticoats with the quickness of  lightning if they incautiously passed too near him. Now it was my  greatest delight to tease this brute in every possible way; and it was  enough to make one burst with laughing to see the beast fix his eyes on  me with such fierceness that he seemed ready to tear me to pieces if he  could but get at me. Well, what happened? Once, when I was amusing  myself in this manner, I hit him such a bang in the ribs with a stone  that in his fury he broke loose and ran right upon me. I tore away like  lightning, but--devil take it!--that confounded ditch lay right in my  way. What was to be done? The dog was close at my heels and quite  furious; there was no time to deliberate. I took a spring and cleared  the ditch. To that leap I was indebted for life and limb; the beast  would have torn me to atoms.    CHARLES VON M. And to what does all this tend?    SPIEGEL. To this--that you may be taught that strength grows with the  occasion. For which reason I never despair even when things are the  worst. Courage grows with danger. Powers of resistance increase by  pressure. It is evident by the obstacles she strews in my path that  fate must have designed me for a great man.    CHARLES VON M. (angrily). I am not aware of anything for which we still  require courage, and have not already shown it.    SPIEGEL. Indeed! And so you mean to let your gifts go to waste? To  bury your talent? Do you think your paltry achievements at Leipsic  amount to the _ne plus ultra_ of genius? Let us but once get to the  great world--Paris and London! where you get your ears boxed if you  salute a man as honest. It is a real jubilee to practise one's  handicraft there on a grand scale. How you will stare! How you will  open your eyes! to see signatures forged; dice loaded; locks picked,  and strong boxes gutted; all that you shall learn of Spiegelberg! The  rascal deserves to be hanged on the first gallows that would rather  starve than manipulate with his fingers.    CHARLES VON M. (in a fit of absence). How now? I should not wonder if  your proficiency went further still.    SPIEGEL. I begin to think you mistrust me. Only wait till I have grown  warm at it; you shall see wonders; your little brain shall whirl clean  round in your pericranium when my teeming wit is delivered. (He rises  excited.) How it clears up within me! Great thoughts are dawning in on  my soul! Gigantic plans are fermenting in my creative brain. Cursed  lethargy (striking his forehead), which has hitherto enchained my  faculties, cramped and fettered my prospects! I awake; I feel what I  am--and what I am to be!    CHARLES VON M. You are a fool! The wine is swaggering in your brain.    SPIEGEL. (more excited). Spiegelberg, they will say, art thou a  magician, Spiegelberg? 'Tis a pity, the king will say, that thou wert  not made a general, Spiegelberg, thou wouldst have thrust the Austrians  through a buttonhole. Yes, I hear the doctors lamenting, 'tis a crying  shame that he was not bred to medicine, he would have discovered the  _elixir vitae_. Ay, and that he did not take to financiering, the  Sullys will deplore in their cabinets,--he would have turned flints into  louis-d'ors by his magic. And Spiegelberg will be the word from east to  west; then down into the dirt with you, ye cowards, ye reptiles, while  Spiegelberg soars with outspread wings to the temple of everlasting  fame.    CHARLES VON M. A pleasant journey to you! I leave you to climb to the  summit of glory on the pillars of infamy. In the shade of my ancestral  groves, in the arms of my Amelia, a nobler joy awaits me. I have  already, last week, written to my father to implore his forgiveness, and  have not concealed the least circumstance from him; and where there is  sincerity there is compassion and help. Let us take leave of each  other, Moritz. After this day we shall meet no more. The post has  arrived. My father's forgiveness must already be within the walls of  this town.           Enter SCHWEITZER, GRIMM, ROLLER, SCHUFTERLE, and RAZMAN.      ROLLER. Are you aware that they are on our track!    GRIMM. That we are not for a moment safe from being taken?    CHARLES VON M. I don't wonder at it. It must be as it will! Have none  of you seen Schwarz? Did he say anything about having a letter for me?    ROLLER. He has been long in search of you on some such errand, I  suspect.    CHARLES VON M. Where is he? where, where? (is about to rush off in  haste).    ROLLER. Stay! we have appointed him to come here. You tremble?    CHARLES VON M. I do not tremble. Why should I tremble? Comrades, this  letter--rejoice with me! I am the happiest man under the sun; why  should I tremble?                     Enter SCHWARZ.      CHARLES VON M. (rushes towards him). Brother, brother! the letter, the  letter!    SCHW. (gives him a letter, which he opens hastily). What's the matter?  You have grown as pale as a whitewashed wall!    CHARLES VON M. My brother's hand!    SCHW. What the deuce is Spiegelberg about there?    GRIMM. The fellow's mad. He jumps about as if he had St. Vitus' dance.    SCHUF. His wits are gone a wool gathering! He's making verses, I'll be  sworn!    RAZ. Spiegelberg! Ho! Spiegelberg! The brute does not hear.    GRIMM. (shakes him). Hallo! fellow! are you dreaming? or--    SPIEGEL. (who has all this time been making gestures in a corner of the  room, as if working out some great project, jumps up wildly). Your  money or your life! (He catches SCHWEITZER by the throat, who"]]]
