As we abhor    oppression, we abhor kings: as we detest vain-glory, we detest    rank: as we despise effeminacy, we despise wealth.  We are    Venetian gondoliersyour equals in everything except our    calling, and in that at once your masters and your servants.         DON AL.  Bless my heart, how unfortunate!  One of you may be    Baptisto's son, for anything I know to the contrary; but the    other is no less a personage than the only son of the late King    of Barataria.         ALL.  What!         DON AL.  And I trustI trust it was that one who slapped me    on the shoulder and called me his man!         GIU.  One of us a king!         MAR.  Not brothers!         TESS.  The King of Barataria!           [Together]         GIA.  Well, who'd have thought it!         MAR.  But which is it?         DON AL.  What does it matter?  As you are both Republicans,    and hold kings in detestation, of course you'll abdicate at once.    Good morning!  (Going.)         GIA. and TESS.  Oh, don't do that!  (Marco and Giuseppe stop    him.)         GIU.  Well, as to that, of course there are kings and kings.    When I say that I detest kings, I mean I detest bad kings.         DON AL.  I see.  It's a delicate distinction.         GIU.  Quite so.  Now I can conceive a kind of kingan ideal    kingthe creature of my fancy, you knowwho would be absolutely    unobjectionable.  A king, for instance, who would abolish taxes    and make everything cheap, except gondolas         MAR.  And give a great many free entertainments to the    gondoliers         GIU.  And let off fireworks on the Grand Canal, and engage    all the gondolas for the occasion         MAR.  And scramble money on the Rialto among the gondoliers.         GIU.  Such a king would be a blessing to his people, and if    I were a king, that is the sort of king I would be.         MAR.  And so would I!         DON AL.  Come, I'm glad to find your objections are not    insuperable.         MAR. and GIU.  Oh, they're not insuperable.         GIA. and TESS.  No, they're not insuperable.         GIU.  Besides, we are open to conviction.         GIA.  Yes; they are open to conviction.         TESS.  Oh! they've often been convicted.         GIU.  Our views may have been hastily formed on insufficient    grounds.  They may be crude, ill-digested, erroneous.  I've a    very poor opinion of the politician who is not open to    conviction.         TESS. (to Gia.).  Oh, he's a fine fellow!         GIA.  Yes, that's the sort of politician for my money!         DON AL.  Then we'll consider it settled.  Now, as the    country is in a state of insurrection, it is absolutely necessary    that you should assume the reins of Government at once; and,    until it is ascertained which of you is to be king, I have    arranged that you will reign jointly, so that no question can    arise hereafter as to the validity of any of your acts.         MAR.  As one individual?         DON AL.  As one individual.         GIU. (linking himself with Marco).  Like this?         DON AL.  Something like that.         MAR.  And we may take our friends with us, and give them    places about the Court?         DON AL.  Undoubtedly.  That's always done!         MAR.  I'm convinced!         GIU.  So am I!         TESS.  Then the sooner we're off the better.         GIA.  We'll just run home and pack up a few things (going)         DON AL.  Stop, stopthat won't do at allladies are not    admitted.         ALL.  What!         DON AL.  Not admitted.  Not at present.  Afterwards,    perhaps.  We'll see.         GIU.  Why, you don't mean to say you are going to separate    us from our wives!         DON AL. (aside).  This is very awkward!  (Aloud.)  Only for    a timea few months.  Alter all, what is a few months?         TESS.  But we've only been married half an hour!  (Weeps.)                               FINALE, ACT I.                               SONGGIANETTA.                Kind sir, you cannot have the heart                        Our lives to part                   From those to whom an hour ago                             We were united!              Before our flowing hopes you stem,                        Ah, look at them,                   And pause before you deal this blow,                             All uninvited!              You men can never understand                        That heart and hand                   Cannot be separated when                             We go a-yearning;              You see, you've only women's eyes                        To idolize                   And only women's hearts, poor men,                             To set you burning!              Ah me, you men will never understand              That woman's heart is one with woman's hand!                Some kind of charm you seem to find                        In womankind                   Some source of unexplained delight                             (Unless you're jesting),              But what attracts you, I confess,                        I cannot guess,                   To me a woman's face is quite                             Uninteresting!              If from my sister I were torn,                        It could be borne                   I should, no doubt, be horrified,                             But I could bear it;              But Marco's quite another thing                        He is my King,                   He has my heart and none beside                             Shall ever share it!              Ah me, you men will never understand              That woman's heart is one with woman's hand!                          RECITATIVEDON ALHAMBRA.                Do not give way to this uncalled-for grief,              Your separation will be very brief.                   To ascertain which is the King                        And which the other,                   To Barataria's Court I'll bring                        His foster-mother;                   Her former nurseling to declare                        She'll be delighted.              That settled, let each happy pair                   Be reunited.      MAR., GIU.,    Viva!  His argument is strong!    GIA., TESS.    Viva!  We'll not be parted long!                   Viva!  It will be settled soon!                   Viva!  Then comes our honeymoon!                                                           (Exit Don    Alhambra.)                 QUARTETMARCO, GIUSEPPE., GIANETTA, TESSA.      GIA.           Then one of us will be a Queen,                        And sit on a golden throne,                             With a crown instead                             Of a hat on her head,                        And diamonds all her own!                   With a beautiful robe of gold and green,                        I've always understood;                             I wonder whether                             She'd wear a feather?                        I rather think she should!      ALL.           Oh, 'tis a glorious thing, I ween,                   To be a regular Royal Queen!                   No half-and-half affair, I mean,                   But a right-down regular Royal Queen!      MAR.           She'll drive about in a carriage and pair,                        With the King on her left-hand side,                             And a milk-white horse,                             As a matter of course,                        Whenever she wants to ride!                   With beautiful silver shoes to wear                        Upon her dainty feet;                             With endless stocks                             Of beautiful frocks                        And as much as she wants to eat!      ALL.           Oh, 'tis a glorious thing, I ween, etc.      TESS.          Whenever she condescends to walk,                        Be sure she'll shine at that,                             With her haughty stare                             And her nose in the air,                        Like a well-born aristocrat!                   At elegant high society talk                        She'll bear away the bell,                             With her \"How de do?\"                             And her \"How are you?\"                        And \"I trust I see you well!\"      ALL.           Oh, 'tis a glorious thing, I ween, etc.      GIU.           And noble lords will scrape and bow,                        And double themselves in two,                             And open their eyes                             In blank surprise                        At whatever she likes to do.                   And everybody will roundly vow                        She's fair as flowers in May,                             And say, \"How clever!\"                             At whatsoever                        She condescends to say!      ALL.           Oh, 'tis a glorious thing, I ween,                   To be a regular Royal Queen!                   No half-and-half affair, I mean,                   But a right-down regular Royal Queen!      (Enter Chorus of Gondoliers and Contadine.)                                   CHORUS.           Now, pray, what is the cause of this remarkable hilarity?              This sudden ebullition of unmitigated jollity?         Has anybody blessed you with a sample of his charity?              Or have you been adopted by a gentleman of quality?      MAR. and GIU.  Replying, we sing                        As one individual,                   As I find I'm a king,                        To my kingdom I bid you all.                   I'm aware you object                        To pavilions and palaces,                   But you'll find I respect                        Your Republican fallacies.      CHORUS.        As they know we object                        To pavilions and palaces,                   How can they respect                        Our Republican fallacies?                             MARCO and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8102"],[0,"The Forme of Cury: A Roll of Ancient English Cookery Compiled, about A.D. 1390 (#5)"],[1,"is little  to be learned from thence. The present work was printed before No. 31  of the Antiquarian Repertory, wherein some ancient recipes in Cookery  are published, came to the Editor's hand.    I must not omit my acknowledgments to my learned friend the present  dean of Carlisle, to whom I stand indebted for his useful notes on  the Northumberland-Household Book, as also for the book itself.    Our chief assistance, however, has been drawn from a MS belonging to  the Editor, denoted, when cited, by the signature _MS. Ed._ It is a  vellum miscellany in small quarto, and the part respecting this  subject consists of ninety-one English recipes (or _nyms_) in cookery.  These are disposed into two parts, and are intituled, 'Hic incipiunt  universa servicia tam de carnibus quam de pissibus.' [123] The second  part, relates to the dressing of fish, and other lenten fare, though  forms are also there intermixed which properly belong to flesh-days.  This leads me to observe, that both here, and in the Roll, messes are  sometimes accommodated, by making the necessary alterations, both to  flesh and fish-days. [124] Now, though the subjects of the MS are  various, yet the hand-writing is uniform; and at the end of one of  the tracts is added, 'Explicit massa Compoti, Anno Dñi M'lo CCC'mo  octogesimo primo ipso die Felicis et Audacti.' [125], i.e. 30 Aug.  1381, in the reign of Rich. II. The language and orthography accord  perfectly well with this date, and the collection is consequently  contemporary with our Roll, and was made chiefly, though not  altogether, for the use of great tables, as appears from the  _sturgeon_, and the great quantity of venison therein prescribed for.    As this MS is so often referred to in the annotations, glossary, and  even in this preface, and is a compilation of the same date, on the  same subject, and in the same language, it has been thought adviseable  to print it, and subjoin it to the Roll; and the rather, because it  really furnishes a considerable enlargement on the subject, and  exhibits many forms unnoticed in the Roll.    To conclude this tedious preliminary detail, though unquestionably a  most necessary part of his duty, the Editor can scarcely forbear  laughing at himself, when he reflects on his past labours, and recollects  those lines of the poet Martial;      Turpe est difficiles habere nugas,    Et stultus labor est ineptiarum. II. 86.    and that possibly mesdames _Carter_ and _Raffald_, with twenty others,  might have far better acquitted themselves in the administration of  this province, than he has done. He has this comfort and satisfaction,  however, that he has done his best; and that some considerable  names amongst the learned, Humelbergius, Torinus, Barthius, our  countryman Dr. Lister, Almeloveen, and others, have bestowed no less  pains in illustrating an author on the same subject, and scarcely of  more importance, the _Pseudo-Apicius_.    [1] If, according to Petavius and Le Clerc, the world was created in      autumn, when the fruits of the earth were both plentiful and in the      highest perfection, the first man had little occasion for much      culinary  knowledge; roasting or boiling the cruder productions, with      modes of preserving those which were better ripened, seem to be all      that was necessary for him in the way of _Cury_, And even after he      was displaced from Paradise, I conceive, as many others do, he was      not permitted the use of animal food [Gen. i. 29.]; but that this was      indulged to us, by an enlargement of our charter, after the Flood,      Gen. ix, 3. But, without wading any further in the argument here, the      reader is referred to Gen. ii. 8. seq. iii. 17, seq. 23.        [Addenda: add 'vi. 22. where _Noah_ and the beasts are to live on the      same food.']  [2] Genesis xviii. xxvii. Though their best repasts, from the      politeness of the times, were called by the simple names of _Bread_,      or a _Morsel of bread_, yet they were not unacquainted with modes of      dressing flesh, boiling, roasting, baking; nor with sauce, or      seasoning, as salt and oil, and perhaps some aromatic herbs.
