Under one or other of these pretexts, all his  neighbours of the Lowlands who had anything to lose, or were unwilling to  compound for security by paying him an annual sum for protection or  forbearance, were exposed to his ravages.    The country in which this private warfare, or system of depredation, was  to be carried on, was, until opened up by roads, in the highest degree  favourable for his purpose. It was broken up into narrow valleys, the  habitable part of which bore no proportion to the huge wildernesses of  forest, rocks, and precipices by which they were encircled, and which  was, moreover, full of inextricable passes, morasses, and natural  strengths, unknown to any but the inhabitants themselves, where a few men  acquainted with the ground were capable, with ordinary address, of  baffling the pursuit of numbers.    The opinions and habits of the nearest neighbours to the Highland line  were also highly favourable to Rob Roy's purpose. A large proportion of  them were of his own clan of MacGregor, who claimed the property of  Balquhidder, and other Highland districts, as having been part of the  ancient possessions of their tribe; though the harsh laws, under the  severity of which they had suffered so deeply, had assigned the ownership  to other families. The civil wars of the seventeenth century had  accustomed these men to the use of arms, and they were peculiarly brave  and fierce from remembrance of their sufferings. The vicinity of a  comparatively rich Lowland district gave also great temptations to  incursion. Many belonging to other clans, habituated to contempt of  industry, and to the use of arms, drew towards an unprotected frontier  which promised facility of plunder; and the state of the country, now so  peaceable and quiet, verified at that time the opinion which Dr. Johnson  heard with doubt and suspicion, that the most disorderly and lawless  districts of the Highlands were those which lay nearest to the Lowland  line. There was, therefore, no difficulty in Rob Roy, descended of a  tribe which was widely dispersed in the country we have described,  collecting any number of followers whom he might be able to keep in  action, and to maintain by his proposed operations.    He himself appears to have been singularly adapted for the profession  which he proposed to exercise. His stature was not of the tallest, but  his person was uncommonly strong and compact. The greatest peculiarities  of his frame were the breadth of his shoulders, and the great and almost  disproportionate length of his arms; so remarkable, indeed, that it was  said he could, without stooping, tie the garters of his Highland hose,  which are placed two inches below the knee. His countenance was open,  manly, stern at periods of danger, but frank and cheerful in his hours of  festivity. His hair was dark red, thick, and frizzled, and curled short  around the face. His fashion of dress showed, of course, the knees and  upper part of the leg, which was described to me, as resembling that of a  Highland bull, hirsute, with red hair, and evincing muscular strength  similar to that animal. To these personal qualifications must be added a  masterly use of the Highland sword, in which his length of arm gave him  great advantage--and a perfect and intimate knowledge of all the recesses  of the wild country in which he harboured, and the character of the  various individuals, whether friendly or hostile, with whom he might come  in contact.    His mental qualities seem to have been no less adapted to the  circumstances in which he was placed. Though the descendant of the  blood-thirsty Ciar Mhor, he inherited none of his ancestor's ferocity. On  the contrary, Rob Roy avoided every appearance of cruelty, and it is not  averred that he was ever the means of unnecessary bloodshed, or the actor  in any deed which could lead the way to it. His schemes of plunder were  contrived and executed with equal boldness and sagacity, and were almost  universally successful, from the skill with which they were laid, and the  secrecy and rapidity with which they were executed. Like Robin Hood of  England, he was a kind and gentle robber,--and, while he took from the  rich, was liberal in relieving the poor. This might in part be policy;  but the universal tradition of the country speaks it to have arisen from  a better motive. All whom I have conversed with, and I have in my youth  seen some who knew Rob Roy personally, give him the character of a  benevolent and humane man \"in his way.\"    His ideas of morality were those of an Arab chief, being such as  naturally arose out of his wild education. Supposing Rob Roy to have  argued on the tendency of the life which he pursued, whether from choice  or from necessity, he would doubtless have assumed to himself the  character of a brave man, who, deprived of his natural rights by the  partiality of laws, endeavoured to assert them by the strong hand of  natural power; and he is most felicitously described as reasoning thus,  in the high-toned poetry of my gifted friend Wordsworth:                     Say, then, that he was wise as brave,                   As wise in thought as bold in deed;                       For in the principles of things                        _He_ sought his moral creed.                     Said generous Rob, \"What need of Books?                   Burn all the statutes and their shelves!                       They stir us up against our kind,                       And worse, against ourselves.                        \"We have a passion, make a law,                      Too false to guide us or control;                      And for the law itself we fight                      In bitterness of soul.                    \"And puzzled, blinded, then we lose                   Distinctions that are plain and few;                         These find I graven on my heart,                         That tells me what to do.                    \"The creatures see of flood and field,                       And those that travel on the wind                   With them no strife can last; they live                      In peace, and peace of mind.                    \"For why? Because the good old rule                      Sufficeth them; the simple plan,                  That they should take who have the power,                      And they should keep who can.                    \"A lesson which is quickly learn'd,                      A signal through which all can see;                  Thus, nothing here provokes the strong                             To wanton cruelty.                    \"And freakishness of mind is check'd,                      He tamed who foolishly aspires,                  While to the measure of his might                         Each fashions his desires.                    \"All kinds and creatures stand and fall                      By strength of prowess or of wit;                 'Tis God's appointment who must sway,                           And who is to submit.                  \"Since then,\" said Robin, \"right is plain,                      And longest life is but a day,                 To have my ends, maintain my rights,                        I'll take the shortest way.\"                   And thus among these rocks he lived,                 Through summer's heat and winter's snow                            The eagle, he was lord above,                          And Rob was lord below.    We are not, however, to suppose the character of this distinguished  outlaw to be that of an actual hero, acting uniformly and consistently on  such moral principles as the illustrious bard who, standing by his grave,  has vindicated his fame. On the contrary, as is common with barbarous  chiefs, Rob Roy appears to have mixed his professions of principle with a  large alloy of craft and dissimulation, of which his conduct during the  civil war is sufficient proof. It is also said, and truly, that although  his courtesy was one of his strongest characteristics, yet sometimes he  assumed an arrogance of manner which was not easily endured by the  high-spirited men to whom it was addressed, and drew the daring outlaw  into frequent disputes, from which he did not always come off with  credit. From this it has been inferred, that Rob Roy was more of a bully  than a hero, or at least that he had, according to the common phrase, his  fighting days. Some aged men who knew him well, have described him also  as better at a _taich-tulzie,_ or scuffle within doors, than in mortal  combat. The tenor of his life may be quoted to repel this charge; while,  at the same time, it must be allowed, that the situation in which he was  placed rendered him prudently averse to maintaining quarrels, where  nothing was to be had save blows, and where success would have raised up  against him new and powerful enemies, in a country where revenge was  still considered as a duty rather than a crime. The power of commanding  his passions on such occasions, far from being inconsistent with the part  which MacGregor had to perform, was essentially necessary, at the period  when he lived, to prevent his career from being cut short.    I may here mention one or two occasions on which Rob Roy appears to have  given way in the manner alluded to. My late venerable friend, John Ramsay  of Ochtertyre, alike eminent as a classical scholar and as an authentic  register of the ancient history and manners of Scotland, informed me,  that on occasion of a public meeting at a bonfire in the town of Doune,  Rob Roy gave some offence to James Edmondstone of Newton, the same  gentleman who was unfortunately concerned in the slaughter of Lord Rollo  (see Maclaurin's Criminal Trials, No. IX.), when Edmondstone compelled  MacGregor to quit the town on pain of being thrown by him into the  bonfire. \"I broke one off"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7026"],[0,"Children's Edition of Touching Incidents and Remarkable Answers to Prayer (#5)"],[1,"darling Ella was? Could he not see that by what she had told him  about Esquire Wiseman and his pet Nellie, she meant HE should understand  how happy SHE should be if HER father was a Christian? Ella had not said  so in words--THAT was a forbidden subject--but the language of her earnest  loving look and manner was not to be mistaken; and the heart of the  infidel father was deeply stirred. He kissed the rosy cheeks of the  lovely girl, and taking his hat, left the house. He walked out into the  field. He felt strangely. Before he was aware of the fact he found his  infidelity leaving him, and the simple, artless religion of childhood  winning its way to his heart. Try as hard as he might he could not help  believing that his little Ella was a Christian. There was a reality about  her simple faith and ardent love that was truly \"the evidence of things  not seen.\" What should he do? Should he yield to thin influence and be  led by his children to Christ? What! Captain Lowe, the boasted infidel  overcome by the weakness of excited childhood! The thought roused his  PRIDE and with an exclamation of impatience at his folly, he suddenly  wheeled about, and retracing his steps, with altered appearance, he  re-entered his house.    His wife was alone with an open Bible before her. As he entered he saw  her hastily wipe away a tear. In passing her he glanced upon the open  page, and his eye caught the words \"YE MUST BE BORN AGAIN!\" They went  like an arrow to his heart. \"TRUTH,\" said a voice within, with such  fearful distinctness that he started at the fancied sound; and the  influence which he had just supposed banished from his heart returned  with ten-fold power. The strong man trembled. Leaving the sitting-room,  he ascended the stairs to his chamber. Passing Sarah's room, a voice  attracted his attention. It was the voice of prayer. He heard his own  name pronounced, and he paused to listen.    \"Oh, Lord, save my dear father. Lead him to the Savior. Let him see  that he MUST BE BORN AGAIN. Oh let not the SERPENT CHARM HIM! Save, oh,  save my dear father!\"    He could listen no longer, \"_Let not the serpent charm him!_\" Was  he then like that helpless little bird, who fluttering around the head  of the serpent, fell at last into the jaws of death? The thought shot a  wild torrent of newly awakened terror through his throbbing heart.    Hastening to his chamber he threw himself into a chair. He started! The  voice of prayer again fell upon his ear. He listened. Yes, it was the  clear, sweet accents of his little pet. Ella was praying--WAS PRAYING  FOR HIM!    \"O Lord, bless my dear father. Make him a Christian, and may he and dear  mother be prepared for heaven!\"    [Illustration: They came from their places of prayer, where they had  lifted up their voices to God who had said: \"Whatsoever ye shall ask the  Father in my name He will give it you.\"]    Deeply moved, the father left the house and hastened to the barn. He  would fain escape from those words of piercing power. They were like  daggers in his heart. He entered the barn. Again he hears a voice. It  comes from the hay-loft, in the rich silvery tones of his own noble boy.  John had climbed up the ladder, and kneeling down upon the hay WAS PRAYING  FOR HIS FATHER.    \"O Lord, save my father!\"    It was too much for the poor convicted man, and, rushing to the house  he fell, sobbing upon his knees by the side of his wife and cried:    \"O Mary, I am a poor, lost sinner! Our children are going to heaven, and  I--I--AM GOING DOWN TO HELL! Oh, Wife, is there mercy for a wretch like  me?\"    Poor Mrs. Lowe was completely overcome. She wept for joy. That her husband  would ever be her companion in the way of holiness, she had never dared  to hope. Yes, there was mercy for even them. \"Come unto me, and find  rest.\" Christ had said it, and her heart told her it was true. Together  they would go to this loving Savior, and their little ones should show  them the way.    The children were called in. They came from their places of prayer, where  they had lifted up their hearts to that God who had said \"WHATSOEVER YE  SHALL ASK THE FATHER IN MY NAME HE WILL GIVE IT YOU.\" They had asked the  Spirit's influence upon the hearts of their parents, and it had been  granted. They gathered around their weeping, broken-hearted father and  penitent mother, and pointed them to the cross of Jesus. Long and earnestly  they prayed, and wept and agonized. With undoubting trust in the promises,  they waited at the mercy-seat, and their prayers were heard. Faith  conquered. The Spirit came and touched these penitent hearts with the  finger of love; and then sorrow was turned to joy--their night, dark and  cheerless and gloomy, was changed to blessed day.    [Illustration]    They arose from their knees, and Ella sprang to the arms of her father,  and together they rejoiced in God.    --Brother H. P. in _Christian Advocate_        THE STOWAWAY    On board an English steamer a little ragged boy, aged nine years, was  discovered on the fourth day of the voyage out from Liverpool to New  York, and carried before the first mate, whose duty it was to deal with  such cases. When questioned as to his object in being stowed away, and  who had brought him on board, the boy, who had a beautiful sunny face,  that looked like the very mirror of truth, replied that his step-father  did it, because he could not afford to keep him nor pay his passage to  Halifax where he had an aunt who was well off, and to whose house he was  going.    The mate did not believe his story, in spite of the winning face and  truthful accents of the boy. He had seen too much of stowaways to be  easily deceived by them, he said; and it was his firm conviction that  the boy had been brought on board and provided with food by the sailors.      [Illustration]    The little fellow was very roughly handled in consequence. Day by day  he was questioned and requestioned, but always with the same result. He  did not know a sailor on board, and his father alone had secreted and  given him the food which he ate. At last the mate, wearied by the boy's  persistence in the same story, and perhaps a little anxious to inculpate  the sailors, seized him one day by the collar, and dragging him to the  fore, told him that unless he told the truth, in ten minutes from that  time he would hang from the yard arm. He then made him sit under it on  the deck. All around him were the passengers and sailors of the midway  watch, and in front of him stood the inexorable mate, with chronometer  in his hand, and the other officers of the ship by his side. It was a  touching sight to see the pale, proud, scornful face of that noble boy;  his head erect, his beautiful eyes bright through the tears that suffused  them. When eight minutes had fled the mate told him that he had but two  minutes to live, and advised him to speak the truth and save his life.  But he replied with the utmost simplicity and sincerity, by asking the  mate if he might pray. The mate said nothing, but nodded his head, and  turned as pale as a ghost, and shook with trembling like a reed in the  wind. And then all eyes turned on him, the brave and noble fellow--  this poor boy whom society owned not, and whose own step-father could  not care for--knelt with clasped hands and eyes upturned to heaven. There  then occurred a scene as of Pentecost. Sobs broke from strong, hard  hearts, as the mate sprang forward and clasped the boy to his bosom, and  kissed him, and blessed him, and told him how sincerely he now believed  his story and how glad he was that he had been brave enough to face death  and be willing to sacrifice his life for the truth of his word.    --_Illustrated Weekly Telegraph_        THE GOLDEN RULE EXEMPLIFIED    Early one morning while it was yet dark, a poor man came to my door and  informed me that he had an infant child very sick, which he was afraid  would die. He desired me to go to his home, and, if possible help them.  \"For,\" said he, \"I want to save its life, if possible.\" As he spoke thus  his tears ran down his face. He then added:    \"I am a poor man; but, Sir, I will pay you in work as much as you ask  if you will go.\"    I said: \"Yes, I will go with you as soon as I take a little refreshment.\"    \"Oh, sir,\" said he, \"I was going to try to get a bushel of corn, and get  it ground to carry home, and I am afraid the child will die before I get  there. I wish you would not wait for me\"; and then he added: \"We want  to save the child's life if we can.\"    [Illustration]    It being some miles to his house, I didn't arrive there until the sun  was two hours high in the morning, when I found the mother holding her  sick child, and six or seven little boys and girls around her, with clean  hands and faces, looking as their mother did, lean and poor. On examining  the sick child, I discovered that it was starving to death! I said to  the mother: \"You don't give milk enough for this child.\"    She said: \"I suppose I don't.\"    \"Well,\" said I, \"you must feed it with milk.\"    She answered: \"I would, sir, but I can't get any to feed it with.\"    I then said: \"It will be well, then, for you to make a little water  gruel, and feed your child.\"    To this she replied: \"I was thinking I would if my husband brings home  some Indian meal. He has gone to try to get some and I am in hopes he  will make out.\"    She said this with a sad countenance. I asked her with surprise: \"Why  madam, have you not got anything to eat?\"    She strove to suppress a tear, and answered sorrowfully: \"No sir; we  have had but little these some days.\"    I said: \"What are your neighbors, that you should suffer among them?\"    She said, \"I suppose they are good people, but we are strangers in this  place, and don't wish to trouble any of them, if we can get along without.\"    Wishing to give the child a little manna I asked for a spoon. The little  girl went to the table drawer to get one, and "]]]
