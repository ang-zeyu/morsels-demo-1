For when they had  quite finished their meal table and contents disappeared in a flash.    \"No dishes to wash, Ozma!\" she said with a laugh. \"I guess you'd make a  lot of folks happy if you could teach 'em just that one trick.\"    For an hour Ozma told stories, and talked with Dorothy about various  people in whom they were interested. And then it was bedtime, and they  undressed and crept into their soft beds and fell asleep almost as soon  as their heads touched their pillows.          Chapter Five    The Magic Stairway      The flat mountain looked much nearer in the clear light of the morning  sun, but Dorothy and Ozma knew there was a long tramp before them, even  yet. They finished dressing only to find a warm, delicious breakfast  awaiting them, and having eaten they left the tent and started toward  the mountain which was their first goal. After going a little way  Dorothy looked back and found that the fairy tent had entirely  disappeared. She was not surprised, for she knew this would happen.    \"Can't your magic give us a horse an' wagon, or an automobile?\"  inquired Dorothy.    \"No, dear; I'm sorry that such magic is beyond my power,\" confessed her  fairy friend.    \"Perhaps Glinda could,\" said Dorothy thoughtfully.    \"Glinda has a stork chariot that carries her through the air,\" said  Ozma, \"but even our great Sorceress cannot conjure up other modes of  travel. Don't forget what I told you last night, that no one is  powerful enough to do everything.\"    \"Well, I s'pose I ought to know that, having lived so long in the Land  of Oz,\" replied Dorothy; \"but I can't do any magic at all, an' so I  can't figure out e'zactly how you an' Glinda an' the Wizard do it.\"    \"Don't try,\" laughed Ozma. \"But you have at least one magical art,  Dorothy: you know the trick of winning all hearts.\"    \"No, I don't,\" said Dorothy earnestly. \"If I really can do it, Ozma, I  am sure I don't know how I do it.\"    It took them a good two hours to reach the foot of the round, flat  mountain, and then they found the sides so steep that they were like  the wall of a house.    \"Even my purple kitten couldn't climb 'em,\" remarked Dorothy, gazing  upward.    \"But there is some way for the Flatheads to get down and up again,\"  declared Ozma; \"otherwise they couldn't make war with the Skeezers, or  even meet them and quarrel with them.\"    \"That's so, Ozma. Let's walk around a ways; perhaps we'll find a ladder  or something.\"    They walked quite a distance, for it was a big mountain, and as they  circled around it and came to the side that faced the palm trees, they  suddenly discovered an entrance way cut out of the rock wall. This  entrance was arched overhead and not very deep because it merely led to  a short flight of stone stairs.    \"Oh, we've found a way to the top at last,\" announced Ozma, and the two  girls turned and walked straight toward the entrance. Suddenly they  bumped against something and stood still, unable to proceed farther.    \"Dear me!\" exclaimed Dorothy, rubbing her nose, which had struck  something hard, although she could not see what it was; \"this isn't as  easy as it looks. What has stopped us, Ozma? Is it magic of some sort?\"    Ozma was feeling around, her bands outstretched before her.    \"Yes, dear, it is magic,\" she replied. \"The Flatheads had to have a way  from their mountain top from the plain below, but to prevent enemies  from rushing up the stairs to conquer them, they have built, at a small  distance before the entrance a wall of solid stone, the stones being  held in place by cement, and then they made the wall invisible.\"    \"I wonder why they did that?\" mused Dorothy. \"A wall would keep folks  out anyhow, whether it could be seen or not, so there wasn't any use  making it invisible. Seems to me it would have been better to have left  it solid, for then no one would have seen the entrance behind it. Now  anybody can see the entrance, as we did. And prob'bly anybody that  tries to go up the stairs gets bumped, as we did.\"    Ozma made no reply at once. Her face was grave and thoughtful.    \"I think I know the reason for making the wall invisible,\" she said  after a while. \"The Flatheads use the stairs for coming down and going  up. If there was a solid stone wall to keep them from reaching the  plain they would themselves be imprisoned by the wall. So they had to  leave some place to get around the wall, and, if the wall was visible,  all strangers or enemies would find the place to go around it and then  the wall would be useless. So the Flatheads cunningly made their wall  invisible, believing that everyone who saw the entrance to the mountain  would walk straight toward it, as we did, and find it impossible to go  any farther. I suppose the wall is really high and thick, and can't be  broken through, so those who find it in their way are obliged to go  away again.\"    \"Well,\" said Dorothy, \"if there's a way around the wall, where is it?\"    \"We must find it,\" returned Ozma, and began feeling her way along the  wall. Dorothy followed and began to get discouraged when Ozma had  walked nearly a quarter of a mile away from the entrance. But now the  invisible wall curved in toward the side of the mountain and suddenly  ended, leaving just space enough between the wall and the mountain for  an ordinary person to pass through.    The girls went in, single file, and Ozma explained that they were now  behind the barrier and could go back to the entrance. They met no  further obstructions.    \"Most people, Ozma, wouldn't have figured this thing out the way you  did,\" remarked Dorothy. \"If I'd been alone the invisible wall surely  would have stumped me.\"    Reaching the entrance they began to mount the stone stairs. They went  up ten stairs and then down five stairs, following a passage cut from  the rock. The stairs were just wide enough for the two girls to walk  abreast, arm in arm. At the bottom of the five stairs the passage  turned to the right, and they ascended ten more stairs, only to find at  the top of the flight five stairs leading straight down again. Again  the passage turned abruptly, this time to the left, and ten more stairs  led upward.    The passage was now quite dark, for they were in the heart of the  mountain and all daylight had been shut out by the turns of the  passage. However, Ozma drew her silver wand from her bosom and the  great jewel at its end gave out a lustrous, green-tinted light which  lighted the place well enough for them to see their way plainly.    Ten steps up, five steps down, and a turn, this way or that. That was  the program, and Dorothy figured that they were only gaining five  stairs upward each trip that they made.    \"Those Flatheads must be funny people,\" she said to Ozma. \"They don't  seem to do anything in a bold straightforward manner. In making this  passage they forced everyone to walk three times as far as is  necessary. And of course this trip is just as tiresome to the Flatheads  as it is to other folks.\"    \"That is true,\" answered Ozma; \"yet it is a clever arrangement to  prevent their being surprised by intruders. Every time we reach the  tenth step of a flight, the pressure of our feet on the stone makes a  bell ring on top of the mountain, to warn the Flatheads of our coming.\"    \"How do you know that?\" demanded Dorothy, astonished.    \"I've heard the bell ever since we started,\" Ozma told her. \"You could  not hear it, I know, but when I am holding my wand in my hand I can  hear sounds a great distance off.\"    \"Do you hear anything on top of the mountain 'cept the bell?\" inquired  Dorothy.    \"Yes. The people are calling to one another in alarm and many footsteps  are approaching the place where we will reach the flat top of the  mountain.\"    This made Dorothy feel somewhat anxious. \"I'd thought we were going to  visit just common, ordinary people,\" she remarked, \"but they're pretty  clever, it seems, and they know some kinds of magic, too. They may be  dangerous, Ozma. P'raps we'd better stayed at home.\"    Finally the upstairs-and-downstairs passage seemed coming to an end,  for daylight again appeared ahead of the two girls and Ozma replaced  her wand in the bosom of her gown. The last ten steps brought them to  the surface, where they found themselves surrounded by such a throng of  queer people that for a time they halted, speechless, and stared into  the faces that confronted them.    Dorothy knew at once why these mountain people were called Flatheads.  Their heads were really flat on top, as if they had been cut off just  above the eyes and ears. Also the heads were bald, with no hair on top  at all, and the ears were big and stuck straight out, and the noses  were small and stubby, while the mouths of the Flatheads were well  shaped and not unusual. Their eyes were perhaps their best feature,  being large and bright and a deep violet in color.    The costumes of the Flatheads were all made of metals dug from their  mountain. Small gold, silver, tin and iron discs, about the size of  pennies, and very thin, were cleverly wired together and made to form  knee trousers and jackets for the men and skirts and waists for the  women. The colored metals were skillfully mixed to form stripes and  checks of various sorts, so that the costumes were quite gorgeous and  reminded Dorothy of pictures she had seen of Knights of old clothed  armor.    Aside from their flat heads, these people were not really bad looking.  The men were armed with bows and arrows and had small axes of steel  stuck in their metal belts. They wore no hats nor ornaments.

Hence if an animal membrane, as  thin as the silk-worm spins its silk, could be so situated as to be  charged like the Leyden bottle, without bursting, (as such thin glass  would be liable to do,) it would be difficult to calculate the immense  quantity of electric fluid, which might be accumulated on its surface.  No land animals are yet discovered which possess this power, though the  air would have been a much better medium for producing its effects;  perhaps the size of the necessary apparatus would have been inconvenient  to land animals.]    [_In his shining claws_. l. 208.

[_Of devouring fire_. l. 212. The first and most important discovery of  mankind seems to have been that of fire. For many ages it is probable  fire was esteemed a dangerous enemy, known only by its dreadful  devastations; and that many lives must have been lost, and many  dangerous burns and wounds must have afflicted those who first dared to  subject it to the uses of life. It is said that the tall monkies of  Borneo and Sumatra lie down with pleasure round any accidental fire in  their woods; and are arrived to that degree of reason, that knowledge of  causation, that they thrust into the remaining fire the half-burnt ends  of the branches to prevent its going out. One of the nobles of the  cultivated people of Otaheita, when Captain Cook treated them with tea,  catched the boiling water in his hand from the cock of the tea-urn, and  bellowed with pain, not conceiving that water could become hot, like red  fire.    Tools of steel constitute another important discovery in consequence of  fire; and contributed perhaps principally to give the European nations  so great superiority over the American world. By these two agents, fire  and tools of steel, mankind became able to cope with the vegetable  kingdom, and conquer provinces of forests, which in uncultivated  countries almost exclude the growth of other vegetables, and of those  animals which are necessary to our existence. Add to this, that the  quantity of our food is also increased by the use of fire, for some  vegetables become salutary food by means of the heat used in cookery,  which are naturally either noxious or difficult of digestion; as  potatoes, kidney-beans, onions, cabbages. The cassava when made into  bread, is perhaps rendered mild by the heat it undergoes, more than by  expressing its superfluous juice. The roots of white bryony and of arum,  I am informed lose much of their acrimony by boiling.]    [_Young Medusa frowned_. l. 218. The Egyptian Medusa is represented on  antient gems with wings on her head, snaky hair, and a beautiful  countenance, which appears intensely thinking; and was supposed to  represent divine wisdom. The Grecian Medusa, on Minerva's shield, as  appears on other gems, has a countenance distorted with rage or pain,  and is supposed to represent divine vengeance. This Medusa was one of  the Gorgons, at first very beautiful and terrible to her enemies;  Minerva turned her hair into snakes, and Perseus having cut off her head  fixed it on the shield of that goddess; the sight of which then  petrified the beholders.

YOU disjoin, unite, condense, expand,       And give new wonders to the Chemist's hand;  225  On tepid clouds of rising steam aspire,       Or fix in sulphur all it's solid fire;       With boundless spring elastic airs unfold,       Or fill the fine vacuities of gold;       With sudden flash vitrescent sparks reveal,  230  By fierce collision from the flint and steel;       Or mark with shining letter KUNKEL's name       In the pale Phosphor's self-consuming flame.       So the chaste heart of some enchanted Maid       Shines with insidious light, by Love betray'd;  235  Round her pale bosom plays the young Desire,       And slow she wastes by self-consuming fire.      [_Or fix in sulphur_. l. 226. The phenomena of chemical explosions  cannot be accounted for without the supposition, that some of the bodies  employed contain concentrated or solid heat combined with them, to which  the French Chemists have given the name of Calorique. When air is  expanded in the air-pump, or water evaporated into steam, they drink up  or absorb a great quantity of heat; from this analogy, when gunpowder is  exploded it ought to absorb much heat, that is, in popular language, it  ought to produce a great quantity of cold. When vital air is united with  phlogistic matter in respiration, which seems to be a slow combustion,  its volume is lessened; the carbonic acid, and perhaps phosphoric acid  are produced; and heat is given out; which according to the experiments  of Dr. Crawford would seem to be deposited from the vital air. But as  the vital air in nitrous acid is condensed from a light elastic gas to  that of a heavy fluid, it must possess less heat than before. And hence  a great part of the heat, which is given out in firing gunpowder, I  should suppose, must reside in the sulphur or charcoal.    Mr. Lavoisier has shewn, that vital air, or Oxygene, looses less of its  heat when it becomes one of the component parts of nitrous acid, than in  any other of its combinations; and is hence capable of giving out a  great quantity of heat in the explosion of gunpowder; but as there seems  to be great analogy between the matter of heat, or Calorique, and the  electric matter; and as the worst conductors of electricity are believed  to contain the greatest quantity of that fluid; there is reason to  suspect that the worst conductors of heat may contain the most of that  fluid; as sulphur, wax, silk, air, glass. See note on l. 174 of this  Canto.]    [_Vitrescent sparks_. l. 229. When flints are struck against other  flints they have the property of giving sparks of light; but it seems to  be an internal light, perhaps of electric origin, very different from  the ignited sparks which are struck from flint and steel. The sparks  produced by the collision of steel with flint appear to be globular  particles of iron, which have been fused, and imperfectly scorified or  vitrified. They are kindled by the heat produced by the collision; but  their vivid light, and their fusion and vitrification are the effects of  a combustion continued in these particles during their passage through  the air. This opinion is confirmed by an experiment of Mr. Hawksbee, who  found that these sparks could not be produced in the exhausted receiver.  See Keir's Chemical Dict. art. Iron, and art.

[_And close an airy ocean_. l. 242. Gunpowder is plainly described in  the works of Roger Bacon before the year 1267. He describes it in a  curious manner, mentioning the sulphur and nitre, but conceals the  charcoal in an anagram. The words are, sed tamen salis petrae _lure mope  can ubre_, et sulphuris; et sic facies tonitrum, et corruscationem, si  scias, artificium. The words lure mope can ubre are an anagram of  carbonum pulvere. Biograph. Britan. Vol. I. Bacon de Secretis Operibus,  Cap. XI. He adds, that he thinks by an artifice of this kind Gideon  defeated the Midianites with only three hundred men. Judges, Chap. VII.  Chamb. Dict. art. Gunpowder. As Bacon does not claim this as his own  invention, it is thought by many to have been of much more antient  discovery.    The permanently elastic fluid generated in the firing of gunpowder is  calculated by Mr. Robins to be about 244 if the bulk of the powder be 1.  And that the heat generated at the time of the explosion occasions the  rarefied air thus produced to occupy about 1000 times the space of the  gunpowder. This pressure may therefore be called equal to 1000  atmospheres or six tons upon a square inch. As the suddenness of this  explosion must contribute much to its power, it would seem that the  chamber of powder, to produce its greatest effect, should be lighted in  the centre of it; which I believe is not attended to in the manufacture  of muskets or pistols.
