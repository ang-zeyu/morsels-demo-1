[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8390"],[0,"Buddhism and Buddhists in China (#5)"],[1,"Chinese scholar, asked for his opinion  about the picture, said: \"Buddha should be seated; Lao Tzu should be  standing at the side looking askance at Buddha; and Confucius should be  grovelling on the floor.\"    A monument dating from 543 A. D., illustrates this tendency of Buddhism  to represent its own superiority in Chinese religious life. At the top  of the monument is Brahma, lower down is Sâkyamuni with his disciples,  Ananda and Kas'yapa on one face, and on the other Sâkyamuni again,  conversing with Buddha Prabhutaratna and worshipped by monks and  Bodhisattvas. On the pedestal are Confucian and Taoist deities, ten in  number. Thus Buddhism sought to rank itself clearly above the other two  religions. From the early days Buddhism regarded itself as their  superior and began the processes of interpenetration and absorption. In  consequence the values originally inherent in Buddhism have come to be  regarded as the natural possession of the Chinese. It does express their  religious life, especially in South China, where outward manifestations  of religion are perhaps more marked than in the north.          IV      BUDDHISM AND THE PEASANT    In order that, one may realize the place that Buddhism holds in the  religious life of the Chinese people as a whole, he must turn to the  organizations through which it functions. It is sometimes difficult to  estimate the place of Buddhism in China, because it so interpenetrates  the whole cultural and social life of the people. It becomes their  \"way.\" To see how it touches the life of the average man or woman in  various ways will, therefore, be illuminating. The most outstanding  evidence of devotion are the many monasteries which dot the land in all  Buddhist countries. China is less dominated by them than other lands,  yet they form a very important reason for the persistence and strength  of Buddhism there. One of the famous old shrines will represent them as  a class and give evidence of their importance.    _1. The Monastery of Kushan_    Kushan Monastery, located about four hours' ride by sedan-chair from  Foochow, is a famous shrine of South China. It occupies a large  amphitheater about fifteen hundred feet above the plain, part way up  Kushan, the \"Drum Mountain,\" some three thousand feet high. From the top  of the mountain on clear days with the help of a glass the blue shores  of Formosa may be seen on the eastern horizon. The spacious monastery  buildings are surrounded by a grove of noble trees, in which squirrels,  pheasants, chipmunks and snakes enjoy an undisturbed life.    The ascent to the monastery begins on the bank of the Min River. At the  foot of the mountain in a large temple the traveler may obtain mountain  chairs carried by two or more coolies. The road, paved with granite  slabs cut from the mountain side, consists of a series of stone stairs,  which zig-zag up the mountain under the shadow of ancient pine trees.  Every turn brings to view a bit of landscape carpeted with rice, or a  distant view where mountains and sky meet. A brook rushes by the side of  the road. Here it breaks into a beautiful waterfall. There it gurgles'  in a deep ravine. The sides of the road are covered with large granite  blocks which, loosened from the mountain side by earthquakes, have  disposed themselves promiscuously. Their blackened, weather-beaten sides  are incised with Chinese characters. One of them bears the words: \"We  put our trust in Amitâbha.\" Another immortalizes the sentiments of some  great official who has made the pilgrimage to the mountain. Near the  monastery stand the sombre dagobas where repose the ashes of former  abbots and monastery officials. Not far away on the other side of the  road, hidden by trees, is the crematory where the last remains of the  brethren are consumed by the flames.    As one approaches the monastery he hears the regular sounds of a bell  tolled by a water-wheel, reminding the faithful of Buddha's law. He sees  monks strolling leisurely about and lay brethren carrying wood,  cultivating the gardens, or tending the animals released by pious  devotees to heap up merit for themselves in the next world. Just inside  the main gate is a large fish pond, where goldfish of great size  struggle with one another, and with the lazy turtles, for the round hard  cakes purchased from the monks by the merit-seeking devotee.    The monastery itself consists of a large group of buildings erected  about stone-paved courts, rising in terraces on the mountain side. The  large court at the entrance leads to the \"Hall of the Four Kings.\" As  one enters the spacious door, he _is_ faced by a jolly, almost  naked image of the \"Laughing Buddha.\" This is Maitrêya, the Mea siah of  the Buddhists, who will return to the world five thousand years after  the departure of Sâkyamuni. In the northern monasteries Maitrêya is  often represented as reaching a height when standing of seventy feet or  more, which indicates the stature to which man will attain when he  returns to earth. On each side of the visitor are two immense images of  the Deva kings. In Brahman cosmogony they were the guardians of the  world. In this entrance hall of the Buddhist monastery they stand as  guardians of the Buddhist faith. In the same hall looking toward the  open court beyond is Wei To, another guardian deity of Buddhism.  Somewhere near by is Kuan Ti, the god worshipped by the soldiers and  merchants. Although a Confucian god, he was early adopted by Buddhist  monks into their pantheon and made the guardian of their Order.    Beyond this entrance hall is a large stone-paved court. On the right  side is a bell-tower whose bell is tolled by a monk who has kept the vow  of silence for fourteen years. On the left is a drum-tower. On the right  one finds a series of small shrines. A passage way leads to the library  where numerous Buddhist writings repose in lacquered cases, some of them  written in their own blood by devout monks. On the same side are guest  halls, the dining room for three hundred monks, and the spacious, well  equipped kitchen with running water piped from a reservoir in the hills  above. A store where books, images and the simple requirements of the  monks can be obtained is just above the dining room. On the left side of  the court are large buildings used as dormitories far the monks,  storerooms, and for housing the great printing establishment with its  thousands of wooden blocks on which are carved passages from the  Buddhist scriptures. Here also are kept the coffins in which the monks  are to be burned.    On a terrace above the north side of the court rises the main hall,  called the \"Hall of the Triratna,\" the Buddhist Trinity, where three  gilded images are seated on a lotus flower with halos covering their  backs and heads. The center image is that of Sâkyamuni, the Buddha. On  his right is Yao Shih, the Buddha of medicine, and on the left,  Amitâbha. Quite often these images are said to represent the Buddha, the  Law and the Community of Monks. On the altar are candlesticks and a fine  incense burner from which curls of smoke arise. An immense lamp hangs  from the ceiling. In the rear are banners with praises to Buddha given  by pious devotees. The floor is tiled and covered with round mats made  of palm fiber on which the monks kneel during worship. Before the mats  are low stands for books. On each side of this main hall are the images  of nine Buddhist saints (_arhats_), eighteen in all. Behind this  large temple opens another court and on a terrace above it stands the  hall of the Law with the images of Kuan Yin, the goddess of Mercy, and  the twenty-four devas. Here also are small images of viceroys and  patrons of the monastery.    The hillsides are dotted with numerous temples and shrines. There is one  to Chu-Hsi, the great philosopher of the Sung dynasty, who was born in  Fukien. In it are preserved a few characters indited by his hand. On the  west side of the monastery are large buildings for the housing of  animals released by merit-seeking devotees. Here cows, hogs, goats,  chickens, geese and ducks spend their old age without fear of beginning  their transmigration by forming the main portion of a Chinese feast.    The monastery is governed by an abbot, usually a man of good business  ability, elected by the monks. Under him are the officers of the two  wings or groups of attendants. One set looks after the spiritual  interests, of the monks; the-other takes care of their material needs:  The monks have worship about two o'clock in the morning and again at  about four in the afternoon. The rest of the long day they spend in  meditation, or study, in strolling about the mountain side or in sleep.  Their life is separated from all stirring contact with the life of the  world.    _2. Monasteries Control Fêng-shui_    This monastery with its appointments is a good type of the monasteries  all over China. It was founded at the request of the inhabitants of the  neighborhood, because the dragons of the region used to cause much  damage to the crops in the surrounding country. A holy monk came,  founded the monastery, and by his good influence so curbed the dragons  that the country-side has enjoyed peace ever since and the monastery has  prospered. Since the fourth century of our era records show that by the  building of monasteries in strategic place's holy monks brought rains  and prosperity to various regions, or prevented floods and calamities  from damaging the villages. In other words the monasteries are regarded  as the controllers of _fêng-shui_ (wind and water). According to  the Chinese philosophy winds and water are spiritual forces and may be  so controlled by other spiritual forces that instead of bringing harm  they will confer benefit upon the people. Floods and dry seasons are so  frequent in China that any institution holding out the promise of  regulating them would become firmly established in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8395"],[0,"The Gods of Pegana (#5)"],[1,"of man.    But the camel drivers, as they sit and listen to the tales of the  old men in the market-place of Bodrahan, at evening, while the  camels rest, say:    \"If Hoodrazai is so very wise and yet is sad, let us drink wine,  and banish wisdom to the wastes that lie beyond Bodrahan.\"  Therefore is there feasting and laughter all night long in the  city where the caravans end.    All this the camel drivers tell when the caravans come in from  Bodrahan; but who shall credit tales that camel drivers have heard  from aged men in so remote a city?        OF THE THING THAT IS NEITHER GOD NOR BEAST      Seeing that wisdom is not in cities nor happiness in wisdom, and  because Yadin the prophet was doomed by the gods ere he was born  to go in search of wisdom, he followed the caravans to Bodrahan.  There in the evening, where the camels rest, when the wind of the  day ebbs out into the desert sighing amid the palms its last  farewells and leaving the caravans still, he sent his prayer with  the wind to drift into the desert calling to Hoodrazai.    And down the wind his prayer went calling: \"Why do the gods  endure, and play their game with men? Why doth not Skarl forsake  his drumming, and MANA cease to rest?\" and the echo of seven  deserts answered: \"Who knows? Who knows?\"    But out in the waste, beyond the seven deserts where Ranorada  looms enormous in the dusk, at evening his prayer was heard; and  from the rim of the waste whither had gone his prayer, came three  flamingoes flying, and their voices said: \"Going South, Going  South\" at every stroke of their wings.    But as they passed by the prophet they seemed so cool and free and  the desert so blinding and hot that he stretched up his arms  towards them. Then it seemed happy to fly and pleasant to follow  behind great white wings, and he was with the three flamingoes up  in the cool above the desert, and their voices cried before him:  \"Going South, Going South,\" and the desert below him mumbled: \"Who  knows? Who knows?\"    Sometimes the earth stretched up towards them with peaks of  mountains, sometimes it fell away in steep ravines, blue rivers  sang to them as they passed above them, or very faintly came the  song of breezes in lone orchards, and far away the sea sang mighty  dirges of old forsaken isles. But it seemed that in all the world  there was nothing only to be going South.    It seemed that somewhere the South was calling to her own, and  that they were going South.    But when the prophet saw that they had passed above the edge of  Earth, and that far away to the North of them lay the Moon, he  perceived that he was following no mortal birds but some strange  messengers of Hoodrazai whose nest had lain in one of Pegana's  vales below the mountains whereon sit the gods.    Still they went South, passing by all the Worlds and leaving them  to the North, till only Araxes, Zadres, and Hyraglion lay still to  the South of them, where great Ingazi seemed only a point of  light, and Yo and Mindo could be seen no more.    Still they went South till they passed below the South and came to  the Rim of the Worlds.    There there is neither South nor East nor West, but only North and  Beyond; there is only North of it where lie the Worlds, and Beyond  it where lies the Silence, and the Rim is a mass of rocks that  were never used by the gods when They made the Worlds, and on it  sat Trogool. Trogool is the Thing that is neither god nor beast,  who neither howls nor breathes, only _It_ turns over the  leaves of a great book, black and white, black and white for ever  until THE END.    And all that is to be is written in the book is also all that was.    When _It_ turneth a black page it is night, and when  _It_ turneth a white page it is day.    Because it is written that there are gods--there are the gods.    Also there is writing about thee and me until the page where our  names no more are written.    Then as the prophet watched _It_, Trogool turned a page--a  black one, and night was over, and day shone on the Worlds.    Trogool is the Thing that men in many countries have called by  many names, _It_ is the Thing that sits behind the gods,  whose book is the Scheme of Things.    But when Yadin saw that old remembered days were hidden away with  the part that _It_ had turned, and knew that upon one whose  name is writ no more the last page had turned for ever a thousand  pages back. Then did he utter his prayer in the fact of Trogool  who only turns the pages and never answers prayer. He prayed in  the face of Trogool: \"Only turn back thy pages to the name of one  which is writ no more, and far away upon a place named Earth shall  rise the prayers of a little people that acclaim the name of  Trogool, for there is indeed far off a place called Earth where  men shall pray to Trogool.\"    Then spake Trogool who turns the pages and never answers prayer,  and his voice was like the murmurs of the waste at night when  echoes have been lost: \"Though the whirlwind of the South should  tug with his claws at a page that hath been turned yet shall he  not be able to ever turn it back.\"    Then because of words in the book that said that it should be so,  Yadin found himself lying in the desert where one gave him water,  and afterwards carried him on a camel into Bodrahan.    There some said that he had but dreamed when thirst seized him  while he wandered among the rocks in the desert. But certain aged  men of Bodrahan say that indeed there sitteth somewhere a Thing  that is called Trogool, that is neither god nor beast, that  turneth the leaves of a book, black and white, black and white,  until he come to the words: _Mai Doon Izahn_, which means The  End For Ever, and book and gods and worlds shall be no more.        YONATH THE PROPHET      Yonath was the first among prophets who uttered unto men.    These are the words of Yonath, the first among all prophets:    There be gods upon Pegana.    Upon a night I slept. And in my sleep Pegana came very near. And  Pegana was full of gods.    I saw the gods beside me as one might see wonted things.    Only I saw not MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI.    And in that hour, in the hour of my sleep, I knew.    And the end and the beginning of my knowing, and all of my knowing  that there was, was this--that Man Knoweth Not.    Seek thou to find at night the utter edge of the darkness, or seek  to find the birthplace of the rainbow where he leapeth upward from  the hills, only seek not concerning the wherefore of the making of  the gods.    The gods have set a brightness upon the farther side of the Things  to Come that they may appear more felititous to men than the  Things that Are.    To the gods the Things to Come are but as the Things that Are, and  nothing altereth in Pegana.    The gods, although not merciful, are not ferocious gods. They are  the destroyers of the Days that Were, but they set a glory about  the Days to Be.    Man must endure the Days that Are, but the gods have left him his  ignorance as a solace.    Seek not to know. Thy seeking will weary thee, and thou wilt  return much worn, to rest at last about the place from whence thou  settest out upon thy seeking.    Seek not to know. Even I, Yonath, the oldest prophet, burdened  with the wisdom of great years, and worn with seeking, know only  that man knoweth not.    Once I set out seeking to know all things. Now I know one thing  only, and soon the Years will carry me away.    The path of my seeking, that leadeth to seeking again, must be  trodden by very many more, when Yonath is no longer even Yonath.    Set not thy foot upon that path.    Seek not to know.    These be the Words of Yonath.        YUG THE PROPHET      When the Years had carries away Yonath, and Yonath was dead,  there was no longer a prophet among men.    And still men sought to know.    Therefore they said unto Yug: \"Be thou our prophet, and know all  things, and tell us concerning the wherefore of It All.\"    And Yug said: \"I know all things.\" And men were pleased.    And Yug said of the Beginning that it was in Yug's own garden, and  of the End that it was in the sight of Yug.    And men forgot Yug.    One day Yug saw Mung behind the hills making the sign of Mung. And  Yug was Yug no more.        ALHIRETH-HOTEP THE PROPHET      When Yug was Yug no more men said unto Alhireth-Hotep: \"Be thou  our prophet, and be as wise as Yug.\"    And Alhireth-Hotep said: \"I am as wise as Yug.\" And men were very  glad.    And Alhireth-Hotep said of Life and Death: \"These be the affairs  of Alhireth-Hotep.\" And men brought gifts to him.    One day Alhireth-Hotep wrote in a book: \"Alhireth-Hotep knoweth  All Things, for he hath spoken with Mung.\"    And Mung stepped from behind him, making the sign of Mung, saying:  \"Knowest thou All Things, then, Alhireth-Hotep?\" And Alhireth-Hotep  became among the Things that Were.        KABOK THE PROPHET    When Alhireth-Hotep was among the Things that Were, and still men  sought to know, they said unto Kabok: \"Be thou as wise as was  Alhireth-Hotep.\"    And Kabok grew wise in his own sight and in the sight of men.    And Kabok said: \"Mung maketh his signs against men or withholdeth  it by the advice of Kabok.\"    And he said unto one: \"Thou hast sinned against Kabok, therefore  will Mung make the sign of Mung against thee.\" And to another:  \"Thou has brought Kabok gifts, therefore shall Mung forbear to  make against thee the sign of Mung.\"    One night as Kabok fattened upon the gifts that men had brought  him he heard the tread of Mung treading in the garden of Kabok  about his house at night.    And because the night was very still it seemed most evil to Kabok  that Mung should be treading in his garden, without the advice of  Kabok, about his house at night.    And Kabok, who knew All Things, grew afraid, for the treading was  very loud and the night still, and he knew not what lay behind the  back of Mung, which none had ever seen.    But when the morning grew to"]]]
