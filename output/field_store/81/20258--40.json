Of course, such       instruction would be a good deal better than nothing, but       regular Ambulance Lectures, with an Examination to follow,       would be far better, and in many instances ladies could use       their influence in the country in getting such lectures       arranged, not of course specially for Emigrants, but to give       them the opportunity of attending. They might also, in some       cases, pay the necessary fees. There are many ladies,       especially among the younger ones, who have acquired a       considerable knowledge of nursing, and who might do invaluable       service by imparting to intending emigrants some acquaintance       with, at all events, such rudiments of nursing as are comprised       in changing sheets, improvised cradles, bed rests, and the       hundred and one little dodges--if they may be so termed--which       make the whole difference in illness, and which so many people       are utterly ignorant of.         \"It is hoped that it may be found possible for nurses to go out       on the same ships with parties of emigrants, with a view to       their giving nursing and ambulance lectures on the voyage.         \"Ladies may also help by contributing to the libraries for use       on board ship and at the Hostels, which it is intended to       establish for the reception of emigrants on their arrival at       Cape Town, and also in other South African Centres.         \"Another form of assistance would be to undertake to pay for       the instruction of emigrants in South African languages. Miss       Alice Werner (20 Dry Hill, Park Road, Tonbridge) is holding       classes for the study of the Zulu language, and also for Taal       or Cape Dutch, at King's College, Strand. Besides these, she is       prepared to give lessons in some of the languages spoken in       British Central Africa.         \"Clothes are not unfrequently needed for intending emigrants.       Working parties could be organised to provide new       underclothing, which could also be purchased from institutions       and bazaars. These working parties would also furnish a       valuable opportunity for making known the scheme among the       daughters of the farmers and tradesmen, who are just the class       most likely to prove desirable denizens of the new Colonies.         \"Useful but fashionable slightly-used clothes for middle-class       women might also be collected.         \"Ladies with friends in South Africa may also give valuable       assistance by writing to tell them of the scheme, being careful       to enclose a prospectus issued by the Association, so that       there may be no mistake as to terms, conditions, &c. Ladies in       Cape Town should be asked to confer with Mrs. Bairnsfather,       Grange Avenue, Rondebosch, Cape Town, and with the Committee       which has recently been formed.         \"It should be known to all who are kindly willing to interest       themselves in this undertaking that a Colonial Training Home       has been established at Leaton, Wrockwardine, Wellington,       Salop, the object of which is to give practical training in       domestic work to ladies and girls wishing to proceed to the       Colonies, to join their families or as Mothers' Helps. The       training given is of the most thorough description, and no       servants being kept, the pupils do all the work of the house.       The course lasts for three or six months, and the terms are       15s. weekly for a single bedroom, 10s. for sharing a double       one. But as only twelve pupils can be received at a time, it       will be impossible by this means only, to train the many girls       who, it is hoped, will be willing and anxious to avail       themselves of the advantages offered by this scheme; and       therefore it is that the Council confidently appeal for help on       the simple but practicable lines indicated in the foregoing       pages.\"    In application to the British Women's Emigration Association (South  African Expansion), replies to the following questions have to be  forwarded to the Hon.

At the present time there are no assisted passages to Cape       Colony. When these are granted, they enable an employer to       obtain an employee by paying to the Immigration Office at Cape       Town a portion of the passage money, the Government of Cape       Colony paying the remainder. Women availing themselves of the       advantage of a practically free passage are obliged to sign a       contract, which is legally binding, to remain one year or       longer, according to the agreement made with the employer.         NATAL.--Persons resident in Natal can obtain third class       assisted passages from their female relatives and domestic       servants through the Immigration Department in the Colony.       Adults, £5; children, half-price.         Persons travelling under the auspices of the Association are       grouped in reserved cabins under an escort. When larger parties       are collected they will have the comfort of travelling with an       experienced matron, whose authority they will be expected to       uphold.         Hostels and Employment Bureaux are established for receiving       travellers and for Registry Work at Cape Town, Johannesburg,       and Salisbury.

Employment for Elementary and High School Teachers, Trained       Nurses, Typists, Dressmakers and Milliners, Useful Helps,       Matrons, Business Hands, and Laundresses, can be obtained       through the Correspondents of the Association.         In Cape Colony and the larger towns of South Africa, the       openings will be chiefly for all-round Domestics, and women in       Professions and Business; up the country in the New       Territories, for women who as Working Housekeepers can utilise       native labour. Teachers will be wanted in all the Provinces.         Employees will be sent out as soon as employers apply for them       and Government Authorities consent. Women who intend to settle       up-country should meanwhile perfect themselves in cooking and       all household matters, adding a knowledge of dairy work,       poultry, and bee-keeping.         Travellers going through the Association who have to sleep in       London, can be received at 3s. 6d. per day. Three days' notice       must be given.         Only women of good character, health, and capability, are       accepted by the South African Expansion Committee, in whose       hands the selection of women to South Africa has been placed.       Protection is secured to them till they enter the situations       found for them in the Colonies.    [Illustration: Photo: Elliott & Fry, London.    SIR HENRY M'CALLUM, K.C.M.G.

The object to be  attained is to let children grow up in the country so that they may  regard it as their own, and that their early home affection may be  largely connected with their adopted land. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4747"],[0,"The River's End (#5)"],[1,"same futile end. An  Englishman, dead to his family if he had one, an outcast or an  expatriate--and the finest, bravest gentleman he had ever known. It was  the WHYFORE of these things that stirred within him an emotion which he  had never experienced before. The Englishman had grimly and  determinedly taken his secret to the grave with him. To him, John  Keith--who was now Derwent Conniston--he had left an heritage of deep  mystery and the mission, if he so chose, of discovering who he was,  whence he had come--and why. Often he looked at the young girl's  picture in the watch, and always he saw in her eyes something which  made him think of Conniston as he lay in the last hour of his life.  Undoubtedly the girl had grown into a woman now.    Days grew into weeks, and under Keith's feet the wet, sweet-smelling  earth rose up through the last of the slush snow. Three hundred miles  below the Barrens, he was in the Reindeer Lake country early in May.  For a week he rested at a trapper's cabin on the Burntwood, and after  that set out for Cumberland House. Ten days later he arrived at the  post, and in the sunlit glow of the second evening afterward he built  his camp-fire on the shore of the yellow Saskatchewan.    The mighty river, beloved from the days of his boyhood, sang to him  again, that night, the wonderful things that time and grief had dimmed  in his heart. The moon rose over it, a warm wind drifted out of the  south, and Keith, smoking his pipe, sat for a long time listening to  the soft murmur of it as it rolled past at his feet. For him it had  always been more than the river. He had grown up with it, and it had  become a part of him; it had mothered his earliest dreams and  ambitions; on it he had sought his first adventures; it had been his  chum, his friend, and his comrade, and the fancy struck him that in the  murmuring voice of it tonight there was a gladness, a welcome, an  exultation in his return. He looked out on its silvery bars shimmering  in the moonlight, and a flood of memories swept upon him. Thirty years  was not so long ago that he could not remember the beautiful mother who  had told him stories as the sun went down and bedtime drew near. And  vividly there stood out the wonderful tales of Kistachiwun, the river;  how it was born away over in the mystery of the western mountains, away  from the eyes and feet of men; how it came down from the mountains into  the hills, and through the hills into the plains, broadening and  deepening and growing mightier with every mile, until at last it swept  past their door, bearing with it the golden grains of sand that made  men rich. His father had pointed out the deep-beaten trails of buffalo  to him and had told him stories of the Indians and of the land before  white men came, so that between father and mother the river became his  book of fables, his wonderland, the never-ending source of his  treasured tales of childhood. And tonight the river was the one thing  left to him. It was the one friend he could claim again, the one  comrade he could open his arms to without fear of betrayal. And with  the grief for things that once had lived and were now dead, there came  over him a strange sort of happiness, the spirit of the great river  itself giving him consolation.    Stretching out his arms, he cried: \"My old river--it's me--Johnny  Keith! I've come back!\"    And the river, whispering, seemed to answer him: \"It's Johnny Keith!  And he's come back! He's come back!\"          IV      For a week John Keith followed up the shores of the Saskatchewan. It  was a hundred and forty miles from the Hudson's Bay Company's post of  Cumberland House to Prince Albert as the crow would fly, but Keith did  not travel a homing line. Only now and then did he take advantage of a  portage trail. Clinging to the river, his journey was lengthened by  some sixty miles. Now that the hour for which Conniston had prepared  him was so close at hand, he felt the need of this mighty, tongueless  friend that had played such an intimate part in his life. It gave to  him both courage and confidence, and in its company he could think more  clearly. Nights he camped on its golden-yellow bars with the open stars  over his head when he slept; his ears drank in the familiar sounds of  long ago, for which he had yearned to the point of madness in his  exile--the soft cries of the birds that hunted and mated in the glow of  the moon, the friendly twit, twit, twit of the low-flying sand-pipers,  the hoot of the owls, and the splash and sleepy voice of wildfowl  already on their way up from the south. Out of that south, where in  places the plains swept the forest back almost to the river's edge, he  heard now and then the doglike barking of his little yellow friends of  many an exciting horseback chase, the coyotes, and on the wilderness  side, deep in the forest, the sinister howling of wolves. He was  traveling, literally, the narrow pathway between two worlds. The river  was that pathway. On the one hand, not so very far away, were the  rolling prairies, green fields of grain, settlements and towns and the  homes of men; on the other the wilderness lay to the water's edge with  its doors still open to him. The seventh day a new sound came to his  ears at dawn. It was the whistle of a train at Prince Albert.    There was no change in that whistle, and every nerve-string in his body  responded to it with crying thrill. It was the first voice to greet his  home-coming, and the sound of it rolled the yesterdays back upon him in  a deluge. He knew where he was now; he recalled exactly what he would  find at the next turn in the river. A few minutes later he heard the  wheezy chug, chug, chug of the old gold dredge at McCoffin's Bend. It  would be the Betty M., of course, with old Andy Duggan at the windlass,  his black pipe in mouth, still scooping up the shifting sands as he had  scooped them up for more than twenty years. He could see Andy sitting  at his post, clouded in a halo of tobacco smoke, a red-bearded,  shaggy-headed giant of a man whom the town affectionately called the  River Pirate. All his life Andy had spent in digging gold out of the  mountains or the river, and like grim death he had hung to the bars  above and below McCoffin's Bend. Keith smiled as he remembered old  Andy's passion for bacon. One could always find the perfume of bacon  about the Betty M., and when Duggan went to town, there were those who  swore they could smell it in his whiskers.    Keith left the river trail now for the old logging road. In spite of  his long fight to steel himself for what Conniston had called the  \"psychological moment,\" he felt himself in the grip of an uncomfortable  mental excitement. At last he was face to face with the great gamble.  In a few hours he would play his one card. If he won, there was life  ahead of him again, if he lost--death. The old question which he had  struggled to down surged upon him. Was it worth the chance? Was it in  an hour of madness that he and Conniston had pledged themselves to this  amazing adventure? The forest was still with him. He could turn back.  The game had not yet gone so far that he could not withdraw his  hand--and for a space a powerful impulse moved him. And then, coming  suddenly to the edge of the clearing at McCoffin's Bend, he saw the  dredge close inshore, and striding up from the beach Andy Duggan  himself! In another moment Keith had stepped forth and was holding up a  hand in greeting.    He felt his heart thumping in an unfamiliar way as Duggan came on. Was  it conceivable that the riverman would not recognize him? He forgot his  beard, forgot the great change that four years had wrought in him. He  remembered only that Duggan had been his friend, that a hundred times  they had sat together in the quiet glow of long evenings, telling tales  of the great river they both loved. And always Duggan's stories had  been of that mystic paradise hidden away in the western mountains--the  river's end, the paradise of golden lure, where the Saskatchewan was  born amid towering peaks, and where Duggan--a long time ago--had  quested for the treasure which he knew was hidden somewhere there. Four  years had not changed Duggan. If anything his beard was redder and  thicker and his hair shaggier than when Keith had last seen him. And  then, following him from the Betsy M., Keith caught the everlasting  scent of bacon. He devoured it in deep breaths. His soul cried out for  it. Once he had grown tired of Duggan's bacon, but now he felt that he  could go on eating it forever. As Duggan advanced, he was moved by a  tremendous desire to stretch out his hand and say: \"I'm John Keith.  Don't you know me, Duggan?\" Instead, he choked back his desire and  said, \"Fine morning!\"    Duggan nodded uncertainly. He was evidently puzzled at not being able  to place his man. \"It's always fine on the river, rain 'r shine.  Anybody who says it ain't is a God A'mighty liar!\"    He was still the old Duggan, ready to fight for his river at the drop  of a hat! Keith wanted to hug him. He shifted his pack and said:    \"I've slept with it for a week--just to have it for company--on the way  down from Cumberland House. Seems good to get back!\" He took off his  hat and met the riverman's eyes squarely. \"Do you happen to know if  McDowell is at barracks?\" he asked.    \"He is,\" said Duggan.    That was all. He was looking at Keith with a curious directness. Keith  held his breath. He would have given a good deal to have seen behind  Duggan's beard. There was a hard note in the riverman's voice, too. It  puzzled him. And there was a flash of sullen fire in his eyes at the  mention of McDowell's name. \"The Inspector's there--sittin' tight,\" he  added, and to Keith's amazement brushed past him without another word  and disappeared into the bush.    This, at least, was not like the good-humored Duggan of four years ago.  Keith replaced his hat and went on."]]]
