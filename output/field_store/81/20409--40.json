But, fie, what a       scent is here!  I'll not speak another word, except the ground       were perfumed, and covered with cloth of arras.         FAUSTUS. What art thou, the second?         COVETOUSNESS. I am Covetousness, begotten of an old churl, in an       old leathern bag:  and, might I have my wish, I would desire that       this house and all the people in it were turned to gold, that I       might lock you up in my good chest:  O, my sweet gold!         FAUSTUS. What art thou, the third?         WRATH. I am Wrath.  I had neither father nor mother:  I leapt out       of a lion's mouth when I was scarce half-an-hour old; and ever       since I have run up and down the world with this case[106]       of rapiers, wounding myself when I had nobody to fight withal.       I was born in hell; and look to it, for some of you shall be       my father.         FAUSTUS. What art thou, the fourth?         ENVY. I am Envy, begotten of a chimney-sweeper and an oyster-wife.       I cannot read, and therefore wish all books were burnt.  I am lean       with seeing others eat.  O, that there would come a famine through       all the world, that all might die, and I live alone! then thou       shouldst see how fat I would be.  But must thou sit, and I stand?       come down, with a vengeance!         FAUSTUS. Away, envious rascal!--What art thou, the fifth?         GLUTTONY. Who I, sir?  I am Gluttony.  My parents are all dead,       and the devil a penny they have left me, but a bare pension, and       that is thirty meals a-day and ten bevers,[107]--a small trifle       to suffice nature.  O, I come of a royal parentage! my grandfather       was a Gammon of Bacon, my grandmother a Hogshead of Claret-wine;       my godfathers were these, Peter Pickle-herring and Martin       Martlemas-beef; O, but my godmother, she was a jolly gentlewoman,       and well-beloved in every good town and city; her name was Mistress       Margery March-beer.  Now, Faustus, thou hast heard all my progeny;       wilt thou bid me to supper?         FAUSTUS. No, I'll see thee hanged:  thou wilt eat up all my victuals.         GLUTTONY. Then the devil choke thee!         FAUSTUS. Choke thyself, glutton!--What art thou, the sixth?         SLOTH. I am Sloth.  I was begotten on a sunny bank, where I have       lain ever since; and you have done me great injury to bring me       from thence:  let me be carried thither again by Gluttony and       Lechery.  I'll not speak another word for a king's ransom.         FAUSTUS. What are you, Mistress Minx, the seventh and last?         LECHERY. Who I, sir?  I am one that loves an inch of raw mutton       better than an ell of fried stock-fish; and the first letter       of my name begins with L.[108]         FAUSTUS. Away, to hell, to hell![109]            [Exeunt the SINS.]         LUCIFER. Now, Faustus, how dost thou like this?         FAUSTUS. O, this feeds my soul!         LUCIFER. Tut, Faustus, in hell is all manner of delight.         FAUSTUS. O, might I see hell, and return again,       How happy were I then!         LUCIFER. Thou shalt; I will send for thee at midnight.[110]       In meantime take this book; peruse it throughly,       And thou shalt turn thyself into what shape thou wilt.         FAUSTUS. Great thanks, mighty Lucifer!       This will I keep as chary as my life.         LUCIFER. Farewell, Faustus, and think on the devil.         FAUSTUS. Farewell, great Lucifer.            [Exeunt LUCIFER and BELZEBUB.]         Come, Mephistophilis.            [Exeunt.]              Enter CHORUS.[111]         CHORUS. Learned Faustus,       To know the secrets of astronomy[112]       Graven in the book of Jove's high firmament,       Did mount himself to scale Olympus' top,       Being seated in a chariot burning bright,       Drawn by the strength of yoky dragons' necks.       He now is gone to prove cosmography,       And, as I guess, will first arrive at Rome,       To see the Pope and manner of his court,       And take some part of holy Peter's feast,       That to this day is highly solemniz'd.            [Exit.]              Enter FAUSTUS and MEPHISTOPHILIS.[113]         FAUSTUS. Having now, my good Mephistophilis,       Pass'd with delight the stately town of Trier,[114]       Environ'd round with airy mountain-tops,       With walls of flint, and deep-entrenched lakes,       Not to be won by any conquering prince;       From Paris next,[115] coasting the realm of France,       We saw the river Maine fall into Rhine,       Whose banks are set with groves of fruitful vines;       Then up to Naples, rich Campania,       Whose buildings fair and gorgeous to the eye,       The streets straight forth, and pav'd with finest brick,       Quarter the town in four equivalents:       There saw we learned Maro's golden tomb,       The way he cut,[116] an English mile in length,       Thorough a rock of stone, in one night's space;       From thence to Venice, Padua, and the rest,       In one of which a sumptuous temple stands,[117]       That threats the stars with her aspiring top.       Thus hitherto hath Faustus spent his time:       But tell me now what resting-place is this?       Hast thou, as erst I did command,       Conducted me within the walls of Rome?         MEPHIST. Faustus, I have; and, because we will not be unprovided,       I have taken up his Holiness' privy-chamber for our use.         FAUSTUS. I hope his Holiness will bid us welcome.         MEPHIST.       Tut, 'tis no matter; man; we'll be bold with his good cheer.       And now, my Faustus, that thou mayst perceive       What Rome containeth to delight thee with,       Know that this city stands upon seven hills       That underprop the groundwork of the same:       Just through the midst[118] runs flowing Tiber's stream       With winding banks that cut it in two parts;       Over the which four stately bridges lean,       That make safe passage to each part of Rome:       Upon the bridge call'd Ponte[119] Angelo       Erected is a castle passing strong,       Within whose walls such store of ordnance are,       And double cannons fram'd of carved brass,       As match the days within one complete year;       Besides the gates, and high pyramides,       Which Julius Caesar brought from Africa.         FAUSTUS. Now, by the kingdoms of infernal rule,       Of Styx, of[120] Acheron, and the fiery lake       Of ever-burning Phlegethon, I swear       That I do long to see the monuments       And situation of bright-splendent Rome:       Come, therefore, let's away.         MEPHIST. Nay, Faustus, stay:  I know you'd fain see the Pope,       And take some part of holy Peter's feast,       Where thou shalt see a troop of bald-pate friars,       Whose summum bonum is in belly-cheer.         FAUSTUS. Well, I'm content to compass then some sport,       And by their folly make us merriment.       Then charm me, that I[121]       May be invisible, to do what I please,       Unseen of any whilst I stay in Rome.            [Mephistophilis charms him.]         MEPHIST. So, Faustus; now       Do what thou wilt, thou shalt not be discern'd.              Sound a Sonnet.[122] Enter the POPE and the CARDINAL OF            LORRAIN to the banquet, with FRIARS attending.         POPE. My Lord of Lorrain, will't please you draw near?         FAUSTUS. Fall to, and the devil choke you, an you spare!         POPE. How now! who's that which spake?--Friars, look about.         FIRST FRIAR. Here's nobody, if it like your Holiness.         POPE. My lord, here is a dainty dish was sent me from the Bishop       of Milan.         FAUSTUS. I thank you, sir.            [Snatches the dish.]         POPE. How now! who's that which snatched the meat from me? will       no man look?--My lord, this dish was sent me from the Cardinal       of Florence.         FAUSTUS. You say true; I'll ha't.            [Snatches the dish.]         POPE. What, again!--My lord, I'll drink to your grace.         FAUSTUS. I'll pledge your grace.            [Snatches the cup.]         C. OF LOR. My lord, it may be some ghost, newly crept out of       Purgatory, come to beg a pardon of your Holiness.         POPE. It may be so.--Friars, prepare a dirge to lay the fury       of this ghost.--Once again, my lord, fall to.            [The POPE crosses himself.]         FAUSTUS. What, are you crossing of yourself?       Well, use that trick no more, I would advise you.            [The POPE crosses himself again.]         Well, there's the second time.  Aware the third;       I give you fair warning.            [The POPE crosses himself again, and FAUSTUS hits him a box             of the ear; and they all run away.]         Come on, Mephistophilis; what shall we do?         MEPHIST. Nay, I know not:  we shall be cursed with bell, book,       and candle.         FAUSTUS. How! bell, book, and candle,--candle, book, and bell,--       Forward and backward, to curse Faustus to hell!       Anon you shall hear a hog grunt, a calf bleat, and an ass bray,       Because it is Saint Peter's holiday.              Re-enter all the FRIARS to sing the Dirge.         FIRST FRIAR.       Come, brethren, let's about our business with good devotion.              They sing.         CURSED BE HE THAT STOLE AWAY HIS HOLINESS' MEAT FROM THE       TABLE!  maledicat Dominus!       CURSED BE HE THAT STRUCK HIS HOLINESS A BLOW ON THE FACE!       maledicat Dominus!       CURSED BE HE THAT TOOK FRIAR SANDELO A BLOW ON THE PATE!       maledicat Dominus!       CURSED BE HE THAT DISTURBETH OUR HOLY DIRGE!  maledicat       Dominus!       CURSED BE HE THAT TOOK AWAY HIS HOLINESS' WINE!  maledicat       Dominus?  ['?' sic]            Et omnes Sancti!  Amen!              [MEPHISTOPHILIS and FAUSTUS beat the FRIARS, and fling             fire-works among them; and so exeunt.]              Enter CHORUS.         CHORUS."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/781"],[0,"Sinking of the Titanic and Great Sea Disasters (#5)"],[1,"military aide to President Taft and was known wherever  the President traveled. His recent European mission was apparently to  call on the Pope in behalf of President Taft; for on March 21st he was  received at the Vatican, and presented to the Pope a letter from  Mr. Taft thanking the Pontiff for the creation of three new American  Cardinals.    Major Butt had a reputation as a horseman, and it is said he was able  to keep up with President Roosevelt, be the ride ever so far or fast.  He was promoted to the rank of major in 1911. He sailed for the  Mediterranean on March 2d with his friend Francis D. Millet, the artist,  who also perished on the Titanic.      COLONEL ASTOR    John Jacob Astor was returning from a trip to Egypt with his  nineteen-year-old bride, formerly Miss Madeline Force, to whom he was  married in Providence, September 9, 1911. He was head of the family  whose name he bore and one of the world's wealthiest men. He was not,  however, one of the world's \"idle rich,\" for his life of forty-seven  years was a well-filled one. He had managed the family estates since  1891; built the Astor Hotel, New York; was colonel on the staff of  Governor Levi P. Morton, and in May, 1898, was commissioned colonel  of the United States volunteers. After assisting Major-General  Breckinridge, inspector-general of the United States army, he was  assigned to duty on the staff of Major-General Shafter and served in  Cuba during the operations ending in the surrender of Santiago. He was  also the inventor of a bicycle brake, a pneumatic road-improver, and an  improved turbine engine.      BENJAMIN GUGGENHEIM    Next to Colonel Astor in financial importance was Benjamin Guggenheim,  whose father founded the famous house of M. Guggenheim and Sons. When  the various Guggen-heim interests were consolidated into the American  Smelting and Refining Company he retired from active business, although  he later became interested in the Power and Mining Machinery Company of  Milwaukee. In 1894 he married Miss Floretta Seligman, daughter of James  Seligman, the New York banker.    ISIDOR STRAUS    Isidor Straus, whose wife elected to perish with him in the ship, was a  brother of Nathan and Oscar Straus, a partner with Nathan Straus in R.  H. Macy & Co. and L. Straus & Sons, a member of the firm of Abraham &  Straus in Brooklyn, and has been well known in politics and charitable  work. He was a member of the Fifty-third Congress from 1893 to 1895,  and as a friend of William L. Wilson was in constant consultation in the  matter of the former Wilson tariff bill.    Mr. Straus was conspicuous for his works of charity and was an ardent  supporter of every enterprise to improve the condition of the Hebrew  immigrants. He was president of the Educational Alliance, vice-president  of the J. Hood Wright Memorial Hospital, a member of the Chamber of  Commerce, on one of the visiting committees of Harvard University, and  was besides a trustee of many financial and philanthropic institutions.    Mr. Straus never enjoyed a college education. He was, however, one of  the best informed men of the day, his information having been derived  from extensive reading. His library, said to be one of the finest and  most extensive in New York, was his pride and his place of special  recreation.      {illust. caption = ACTUAL PHOTOGRAPH OF THE ICEBERG THAT SUNK THE  TITANIC    Lady Duff Gordon, a prominent English woman who was aboard the...}      {illust. caption = HEART-BREAKING FAREWELLS    Both men and women were loaded into the first boats, but soon the cry of  \"Women first\" was raised. Then came the real note of tragedy.  Husbands and wives clung to each other in farewell; some refused to be  separated.}      GEORGE D. WIDENER    The best known of Philadelphia passengers aboard the Titanic were Mr.  and Mrs. George D. Widener. Mr. Widener was a son of Peter A. B. Widener  and, like his father, was recognized as one of the foremost financiers  of Philadelphia as well as a leader in society there. Mr. Widener  married Miss Eleanor Elkins, a daughter of the late William L. Elkins.  They made their home with his father at the latter's fine place  at Eastbourne, ten miles from Philadelphia. Mr. Widener was keenly  interested in horses and was a constant exhibitor at horse shows. In  business he was recognized as his father's chief adviser in managing the  latter's extensive traction interests. P. A. B. Widener is a director of  the International Mercantile Marine.    Mrs. Widener is said to be the possessor of one of the finest  collections of jewels in the world, the gift of her husband. One string  of pearls in this collection was reported to be worth $250,000.    The Wideners went abroad two months previous to the disaster, Mr.  Widener desiring to inspect some of his business interests on the other  side. At the opening of the London Museum by King George on March 21st  last it was announced that Mrs. Widener had presented to the museum  thirty silver plates once the property of Nell Gwyn. Mr. Widener is  survived by a daughter, Eleanor, and a son, George D. Widener, Jr. Harry  Elkins Widener was with his parents and went down on the ship.    COLONEL ROEBLING    Colonel Washington Augustus Roebling was president of the John A.  Roebling Sons' Company, manufacturers of iron and steel wire rope. He  served in the Union Army from 1861 to 1865, resigning to assist his  father in the construction of the Cincinnati and Covington suspension  bridge. At the death of his father in 1869 he took entire charge of the  construction of the Brooklyn Bridge, and it is to his genius that the  success of that great work may be said to be due.    WILLIAM T. STEAD    One of the most notable of the foreign passengers was William T. Stead.  Few names are more widely known to the world of contemporary literature  and journalism than that of the brilliant editor of the Review of  Reviews. Matthew Arnold called him \"the inventor of the new journalism  in England.\" He was on his way to America to take part in the Men and  Religion Forward Movement and was to have delivered an address in Union  Square on the Thursday after the disaster, with William Jennings Bryan  as his chief associate.    Mr. Stead was an earnest advocate of peace and had written many books.  His commentary \"If Christ Came to Chicago\" raised a storm twenty years  ago. When he was in this country in 1907 he addressed a session of  Methodist clergymen, and at one juncture of the meeting remarked that  unless the Methodists did something about the peace movement besides  shouting \"amen\" nobody \"would care a damn about their amens!\"    OTHER ENGLISHMEN ABOARD    Other distinguished Englishmen on the Titanic were Norman C. Craig,  M.P., Thomas Andrews, a representative of the firm of Harland & Wolff,  of Belfast, the ship's builders, and J. Bruce Ismay, managing director  of the White Star Line.    J. BRUCE ISMAY    Mr. Ismay is president and one of the founders of the International  Mercantile Marine. He has made it a custom to be a passenger on the  maiden voyage of every new ship built by the White Star Line. It was Mr.  Ismay who, with J. P. Morgan, consolidated the British steamship lines  under the International Mercantile Marine's control; and it is largely  due to his imagination that such gigantic ships as the Titanic and  Olympic were made possible    JACQUES FUTRELLE    Jacques Futrelle was an author of short stories, some of which have  appeared in the Saturday Evening Post, and of many novels of the same  general type as \"The Thinking Machine,\" with which he first gained a  wide popularity. Newspaper work, chiefly in Richmond, Va., engaged his  attention from 1890 to 1909, in which year he entered the theatrical  business as a manager. In 1904 he returned to his journalistic career.    HENRY B. HARRIS    Henry B. Harris, the theater manager, had been manager of May Irwin,  Peter Dailey, Lily Langtry, Amelia Bingham, and launched Robert Edeson  as star. He became the manager of the Hudson Theater in 1903 and the  Hackett Theater in 1906. Among his best known productions are \"The Lion  and the Mouse,\" \"The Traveling Salesman\" and \"The Third Degree.\" He was  president of the Henry B. Harris Company controlling the Harris Theater.    Young Harris had a liking for the theatrical business from a boy. Twelve  years ago Mr. Harris married Miss Rene Wallach of Washington. He was  said to have a fortune of between $1,000,000 and $3,000,000. He owned  outright the Hudson and the Harris theaters and had an interest in two  other show houses in New York. He owned three theaters in Chicago, one  in Syracuse and one in Philadelphia.      HENRY S. HARPER    Henry Sleeper Harper, who was among the survivors, is a grandson of John  Wesley Harper, one of the founders of the Harper publishing business. H.  Sleeper Harper was himself an incorporator of Harper & Brothers when the  firm became a corporation in 1896. He had a desk in the offices of the  publishers, but his hand of late years in the management of the business  has been very slight. He has been active in the work of keeping the  Adirondack forests free from aggression. He was in the habit of spending  about half of his time in foreign travel. His friends in New York  recalled that he had a narrow escape about ten years ago when a ship in  which he was traveling ran into an iceberg on the Grand Banks.    FRANCIS DAVID MILLET    Millet was one of the best-known American painters and many of his  canvasses are found in the leading galleries of the world. He served as  a drummer boy with the Sixtieth Massachusetts volunteers in the Civil  War, and from early manhood took a prominent part in public affairs. He  was director of the decorations for the Chicago Exposition and was, at  the time of the disaster, secretary of the American Academy in Rome. He  was a wide traveler and the author of many books, besides translations  of Tolstoi.    CHARLES M."]]]
