The renowned Italian campaigns occupy the remainder of the third, and  some part of the fourth volume, to which we now proceed. It will be  remembered that the war in Egypt being triumphantly concluded on the  part of Great Britain, the news of the contest reached France some time  before the English received it. Napoleon, on learning the tidings, is  reported to have said, \"Well, there remains now no alternative but to  make the descent on Britain.\"      PROPOSED INVASION OF GREAT BRITAIN.    As the words of the first consul appeard to intimate, preparations were  resumed on the French coast for the invasion of Great Britain. Boulogne  and every harbour along the coast was crowded with flat-bottomed boats,  and the shores covered with camps of the men designed apparently to fill  them. We need not at present dwell on the preparations for attack, or  those which the English adopted in defence, as we shall have occasion to  notice both, when Bonaparte, for the last time, threatened England with  the same measure. It is enough to say, that, on the present occasion,  the menaces of France had their usual effect in awakening the spirit  of Britain.    The most extensive arrangements were made for the reception of the  invaders should they chance to land, and in the meanwhile, our natural  barrier was not neglected. The naval preparations were very great, and  what gave yet more confidence than the number of vessels and guns,  Nelson was put into command of the sea, from Orfordness to Beachy-head.  Under his management, it soon became the question, not whether the  French flotilla was to invade the British shores, but whether it was to  remain in safety in the French harbours. Boulogne was bombarded, and  some of the small craft and gun-boats destroyed--the English admiral  generously sparing the town; and not satisfied with this partial  success, Nelson prepared to attack them with the boats of the squadron.  The French resorted to the most unusual and formidable preparations for  defence. Their flotilla was moored close to the shore in the mouth of  Boulogne harbour, the vessels secured to each other by chains, and  filled with soldiers. The British attack in some degree failed, owing to  the several divisions of boats missing each other in the dark; some  French vessels were taken, but they could not be brought off; and the  French chose to consider this result as a victory, on their part, of  consequence enough to balance the loss at Aboukir;--though it amounted  at best to ascertaining, that although their vessels could not keep the  sea, they might, in some comparative degree of safety, lie under close  cover of their own batteries.    The preliminaries of peace, however, were signed, and the treaty was  confirmed at Amiens, on the 27th of March, 1802. Napoleon still  prosecuted his ambitious projects, extended his power in Italy, and  caused himself to be appointed consul for life, with the power of naming  his successor.      SCHEME OF INVASION RENEWED.    It must be in the memory of most who recollect the period, that the  kingdom of Great Britain was seldom less provided against invasion than  at the commencement of this second war; and that an embarkation from the  ports of Holland, if undertaken instantly after the war had broken out,  might have escaped our blockading squadrons, and have at least shown  what a French army could have done on British ground, at a moment when  the alarm was general, and the country in an unprepared state. But it  is probable that Bonaparte himself was as much unprovided as England  for the sudden breach of the treaty of Amiens--an event brought about  more by the influence of passion than of policy; so that its  consequences were as unexpected in his calculations as in those of Great  Britain. Besides, he had not diminished to himself the dangers of the  undertaking, by which he must have staked his military renown, his  power, which he held chiefly as the consequence of his reputation,  perhaps his life, upon a desperate game, which, though he had already  twice contemplated it, he had not yet found hardihood enough seriously  to enter upon.    He now, however, at length bent himself, with the whole strength of his  mind, and the whole force of his empire, to prepare for this final and  decisive undertaking. The gun-boats in the Bay of Gibraltar, where calms  are frequent, had sometimes in the course of the former war been able to  do considerable damage to the English vessels of war, when they could  not use their sails. Such small craft, therefore, were supposed the  proper force for covering the intended descent. They were built in  different harbours, and brought together by crawling along the French  shore, and keeping under the protection of the batteries, which were now  established on every cape, almost as if the sea-coast of the channel on  the French side had been the lines of a besieged city, no one point of  which could with prudence be left undefended by cannon. Boulogne was  pitched upon as the centre port, from which the expedition was to sail.  By incredible exertions, Bonaparte had rendered its harbour and roads  capable of containing two thousand vessels of various descriptions. The  smaller sea-ports of Vimereux, Ambleteuse, and Etaples, Dieppe, Havre,  St. Valeri, Caen, Gravelines, and Dunkirk, were likewise filled with  shipping. Flushing and Ostend were occupied by a separate flotilla.  Brest, Toulon, and Rochefort, were each the station of as strong a naval  squadron as France, had still the means to send to sea.    A land army was assembled of the most formidable description, whether we  regard the high military character of the troops, the extent and  perfection of their appointments, or their numerical strength. The  coast, from the mouth of the Seine to the Texel, was covered with  forces; and Soult, Ney, Davoust, and Victor, names that were then the  pride and the dread of war, were appointed to command the army of  England, (for that menacing title was once more, assumed,) and execute  those manoeuvres, planned and superintended by Bonaparte, the issue of  which was to be the blotting out of Britain from the rank of  independent nations.    Far from being alarmed at this formidable demonstration of force,  England prepared for her resistance with an energy becoming her ancient  rank in Europe, and far surpassing in its efforts any extent of military  preparation before heard of in her history. To nearly one hundred  thousand troops of the line, were added eighty thousand and upwards of  militia, which scarce yielded to the regulars in point of discipline.  The volunteer force, by which every citizen was permitted and invited to  add his efforts to the defence of the country, was far more numerous  than during the last war, was better officered also, and rendered every  way more effective. It was computed to amount to three hundred and fifty  thousand men, who, if we regard the shortness of the time and the nature  of the service, had attained considerable practice in the use and  management of their arms. Other classes of men were embodied, and  destined to act as pioneers, drivers of wagons, and in the like  services. On a sudden, the land seemed converted to an immense camp, the  whole nation into soldiers, and the good old king himself into a  general-in-chief. All peaceful considerations appeared for a time to be  thrown aside; and the voice, calling the nation to defend their dearest  rights, sounded not only in Parliament, and in meetings convoked to  second the measures of defence, but was heard in the places of public  amusement, and mingled even with the voice of devotion--not unbecoming  surely, since to defend our country is to defend our religion.    Beacons were erected in conspicuous points, corresponding with each  other, all around and all through the island; and morning and evening,  one might have said, every eye was turned towards them to watch for the  fatal and momentous signal. Partial alarms were given to different  places, from the mistakes to which such arrangements must necessarily be  liable; and the ready spirit which animated every species of troops  where such signals called to arms, was of the most satisfactory  description, and afforded the most perfect assurance, that the heart of  every man was in the cause of his country.    Amidst her preparations by land, England did not neglect or relax her  precautions on the element she calls her own. She covered the ocean with  five hundred and seventy ships of war of various descriptions.  Divisions of her fleet blocked up every French port in the channel; and  the army destined to invade our shores, might see the British flag  flying in every direction on the horizon, waiting for their issuing from  the harbour, as birds of prey may be seen floating in the air above the  animal which they design to pounce upon. Sometimes the British frigates  and sloops of war stood in, and cannonaded or threw shells into Havre,  Dieppe, Granville, and Boulogne itself. Sometimes the seamen and marines  landed, cut out vessels, destroyed signal posts, and dismantled  batteries. Such events were trifling, and it was to be regretted that  they cost the lives of gallant men; but although they produced no direct  results of consequence, yet they had their use in encouraging the  spirits of our sailors, and damping the confidence of the enemy, who  must at length have looked forward with more doubt than hope to the  invasion of the English coast, when the utmost vigilance could not  prevent their experiencing insults upon their own.    During this period of menaced attack and arranged defence, Bonaparte  visited Boulogne, and seemed active in preparing his soldiers for the  grand effort. He reviewed them in an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9886"],[0,"The Book of Delight and Other Papers (#5)"],[1,"  done the fearsome deed, \"the corpse I watched was bald, your husband has    thick hair; the change will be detected.\" \"Nay,\" said the woman, \"I will    make him bald,\" and she tore his hair out, with execrations, and they    hung him on the tree. But a few days passed and the pair were married.      And now the leopard interlude nears it close. Zabara narrates the  _denouement_ in these terms:      THE LEOPARD'S FATE      The leopard's bones rattled while he listened to this tale. Angrily he    addressed his wife, \"Come, get up and follow me, or I will slay thee.\"    Together they went with their young ones, and the fox was their guide,    and they reached the promised place, and encamped by the waters. The fox    bade them farewell, his head laughing at his tail. Seven days were gone,    when the rains descended, and in the deep of the night the river rose and    engulfed the leopard family in their beds. \"Woe is me,\" sighed the    leopard, \"that I did not listen to my wife.\" And he died before his time.      THE JOURNEY BEGUN BY JOSEPH AND ENAN    The author has now finished his protest against his visitor's design, to  make him join him on a roving expedition. Enan glares, and asks, \"Am I a  fox, and thou a leopard, that I should fear thee?\" Then his note changes,  and his tone becomes coaxing and bland. Joseph cannot resist his  fascination. Together they start, riding on their asses. Then says Enan  unto Joseph, \"Carry thou me, or I will carry thee.\" \"But,\" continues the  narrator, Joseph, \"we were both riding on our asses. 'What dost thou mean?  Our asses carry us both. Explain thy words.'--'It is the story of the  peasant with the king's officer.'\"      THE CLEVER GIRL AND THE KING'S DREAM      A king with many wives dreamt that he saw a monkey among them; his face    fell, and his spirit was troubled. \"This is none other,\" said he, \"than a    foreign king, who will invade my realm, and take my harem for his spoil.\"    One of his officers told the king of a clever interpreter of dreams, and    the king despatched him to find out the meaning of his ominous vision. He    set forth on his mule, and met a countryman riding. \"Carry me,\" said the    officer, \"or I will carry thee.\" The peasant was amazed. \"But our asses    carry us both,\" he said. \"Thou tiller of the earth,\" said the officer,    \"thou art earth, and eatest earth. There is snow on the hill,\" continued    the officer, and as the month was Tammuz, the peasant laughed. They    passed a road with wheat growing on each side. \"A horse blind in one eye    has passed here,\" said the officer, \"loaded with oil on one side, and    with vinegar on the other.\" They saw a field richly covered with    abounding corn, and the peasant praised it. \"Yes,\" said the officer, \"if    the corn is not already eaten.\" They went on a little further and saw a    lofty tower. \"Well fortified,\" remarked the peasant. \"Fortified without,    if not ruined within,\" replied the officer. A funeral passed them. \"As to    this old man whom they are burying,\" said the officer, \"I cannot tell    whether he is alive or dead.\" And the peasant thought his companion mad    to make such unintelligible remarks. They neared a village where the    peasant lived, and he invited the officer to stay with him overnight.      The peasant, in the dead of the night, told his wife and daughters of the    foolish things the officer had said, though he looked quite wise. \"Nay,\"    said the peasant's youngest daughter, a maiden of fifteen years, \"the man    is no fool; thou didst not comprehend the depth of his meaning. The    tiller of the earth eats food grown from the earth. By the 'snow on the    hill' is meant thy white beard (on thy head); thou shouldst have    answered, 'Time caused it.' The horse blind in one eye he knew had    passed, because he saw that the wheat was eaten on one side of the way,    and not on the other; and as for its burden, he saw that the vinegar had    parched the dust, while the oil had not. His saying, 'Carry me, or I will    carry thee,' signifies that he who beguiles the way with stories and    proverbs and riddles, carries his companion, relieving him from the    tedium of the journey. The corn of the field you passed,\" continued the    girl, \"was already eaten if the owner was poor, and had sold it before it    was reaped. The lofty and stately tower was in ruins within, if it was    without necessary stores. About the funeral, too, his remark was true. If    the old man left a son, he was still alive; if he was childless, he was,    indeed, dead.\"      In the morning, the girl asked her father to give the officer the food    she would prepare. She gave him thirty eggs, a dish full of milk, and a    whole loaf. \"Tell me,\" said she, \"how many days old the month is; is the    moon new, and the sun at its zenith?\" Her father ate two eggs, a little    of the loaf, and sipped some of the milk, and gave the rest to the    officer. \"Tell thy daughter,\" he said, \"the sun is not full, neither is    the moon, for the month is two days old.\" \"Ah,\" laughed the peasant, as    he told his daughter the answers of the officer, \"ah, my girl, I told you    he was a fool, for we are now in the middle of the month.\" \"Did you eat    anything of what I gave you?\" asked the girl of her father. And he told    her of the two eggs, the morsel of bread, and the sip of milk that he had    taken. \"Now I know,\" said the girl, \"of a surety that the man is very    wise.\" And the officer, too, felt that she was wise, and so he told her    the king's dream. She went back with him to the king, for she told the    officer that she could interpret the vision, but would do so only to the    king in person, not through a deputy. \"Search thy harem,\" said the girl,    \"and thou wilt find among thy women a man disguised in female garb.\" He    searched, and found that her words were true. The man was slain, and the    women, too, and the peasant's daughter became the king's sole queen, for    he never took another wife besides her.      THE NIGHT'S REST    Thus Joseph and the giant Enan journey on, and they stay overnight in a  village inn. Then commences a series of semi-medical wrangles, which fill  up a large portion of the book. Joseph demands food and wine, and Enan  gives him a little of the former and none of the latter. \"Be still,\" says  Enan, \"too much food is injurious to a traveller weary from the way. But  you cannot be so very hungry, or you would fall to on the dry bread. But  wine with its exciting qualities is bad for one heated by a long day's  ride.\" Even their asses are starved, and Joseph remarks sarcastically,  \"Tomorrow it will be, indeed, a case of carry-thou-me-or-I-thee, for our  asses will not be able to bear us.\" They sleep on the ground, without couch  or cover. At dawn Enan rouses him, and when he sees that his ass is still  alive, he exclaims, \"Man and beast thou savest, O Lord!\" The ass, by the  way, is a lineal descendant of Balaam's animal.    They proceed, and the asses nod and bow as though they knew how to pray.  Enan weeps as they near a town. \"Here,\" says he, \"my dear friend died, a  man of wisdom and judgment. I will tell thee a little of his cleverness.\"      THE DISHONEST SINGER AND THE WEDDING ROBES      A man once came to him crying in distress. His only daughter was    betrothed to a youth, and the bridegroom and his father came to the    bride's house on the eve of the wedding, to view her ornaments and    beautiful clothes. When the bride's parents rose next day, everything had    vanished, jewels and trousseau together. They were in despair, for they    had lavished all their possessions on their daughter. My friend    [continued Enan] went back with the man to examine the scene of the    robbery. The walls of the house were too high to scale. He found but one    place where entry was possible, a crevice in a wall in which an orange    tree grew, and its edge was covered with thorns and prickles. Next door    lived a musician, Paltiel ben Agan [or Adan] by name, and my late friend,    the judge, interviewed him, and made him strip. His body was covered with    cuts and scratches; his guilt was discovered, and the dowry returned to    the last shoe-latchet. \"My son,\" said he, \"beware of singers, for they    are mostly thieves; trust no word of theirs, for they are liars; they    dally with women, and long after other people's money. They fancy they    are clever, but they know not their left hand from their right; they    raise their hands all day and call, but know not to whom. A singer stands    at his post, raised above all other men, and he thinks he is as lofty as    his place. He constantly emits sounds, which mount to his brain, and dry    it up; hence he is so witless.\"    Then Enan tells Joseph another story of his friend the judge's sagacity:      THE NOBLEMAN AND THE NECKLACE      A man lived in Cordova, Jacob by name, the broker; he was a man of tried    honesty. Once a jewelled necklet was entrusted to him for sale by the    judge, the owner demanding five hundred pieces of gold as its price.    Jacob had the chain in his hand when he met a nobleman, one of the king's    intimate friends. The nobleman offered four hundred pieces for the    necklet, which Jacob refused. \"Come with me to my house, and I will    consider the price,\" said the would-be purchaser. The Jew accompanied him    home, and the nobleman went within. Jacob waited outside the gate till    the evening, but no one came out. He passed a sleepless night with his    wife and children, and next morning returned to the nobleman. \"Buy the    necklace,\" said he, \"or return it.\" The nobleman denied all knowledge of    the jewels, so Jacob went to the judge. He sent for the nobles, to    address them as was his wont, and as soon as they had arrived, he said to    the thief's servant, \"Take your master's shoe and go to his wife. Show    the shoe and say, Your lord bids me ask you for the "]]]
