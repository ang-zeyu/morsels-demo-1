Was M.  d'Aigleroche penniless? Was the woman he was taking as his second wife  rich? Or were they both in love with each other and did M. d'Aigleroche  plan with her to kill his first wife and the husband of his second wife?  These are problems to which I do not know the answer. They have no interest  for the moment; but the police, with all the means at their disposal, would  have no great difficulty in elucidating them.\"    M. d'Aigleroche staggered and had to steady himself against the back of a  chair. Livid in the face, he spluttered:    \"Are you going to inform the police?\"    \"No, no,\" said Renine. \"To begin with, there is the statute of limitations.  Then there are twenty years of remorse and dread, a memory which will  pursue the criminal to his dying hour, accompanied no doubt by domestic  discord, hatred, a daily hell ... and, in the end, the necessity of  returning to the tower and removing the traces of the two murders, the  frightful punishment of climbing that tower, of touching those skeletons,  of undressing them and burying them. That will be enough. We will not ask  for more. We will not give it to the public to batten on and create a  scandal which would recoil upon M. d'Aigleroche's niece. No, let us leave  this disgraceful business alone.\"    The count resumed his seat at the table, with his hands clutching his  forehead, and asked:    \"Then why ...?\"    \"Why do I interfere?\" said Renine. \"What you mean is that I must have  had some object in speaking. That is so. There must indeed be a penalty,  however slight, and our interview must lead to some practical result. But  have no fear: M. d'Aigleroche will be let off lightly.\"    The contest was ended. The count felt that he had only a small formality to  fulfil, a sacrifice to accept; and, recovering some of his self-assurance,  he said, in an almost sarcastic tone:    \"What's your price?\"    Renine burst out laughing:    \"Splendid! You see the position. Only, you make a mistake in drawing me  into the business. I'm working for the glory of the thing.\"    \"In that case?\"    \"You will be called upon at most to make restitution.\"    \"Restitution?\"    Renine leant over the table and said:    \"In one of those drawers is a deed awaiting your signature. It is a draft  agreement between you and your niece Hortense Daniel, relating to her  private fortune, which fortune was squandered and for which you are  responsible. Sign the deed.\"    M. d'Aigleroche gave a start:    \"Do you know the amount?\"    \"I don't wish to know it.\"    \"And if I refuse?...\"    \"I shall ask to see the Comtesse d'Aigleroche.\"    Without further hesitation, the count opened a drawer, produced a document  on stamped paper and quickly signed it:    \"Here you are,\" he said, \"and I hope....\"    \"You hope, as I do, that you and I may never have any future dealings? I'm  convinced of it. I shall leave this evening; your niece, no doubt,  tomorrow. Good-bye.\"           *       *       *       *       *    In the drawing-room, which was still empty, while the guests at the  house were dressing for dinner, Renine handed the deed to Hortense. She  seemed dazed by all that she had heard; and the thing that bewildered her  even more than the relentless light shed upon her uncle's past was the  miraculous insight and amazing lucidity displayed by this man: the man who  for some hours had controlled events and conjured up before her eyes the  actual scenes of a tragedy which no one had beheld.    \"Are you satisfied with me?\" he asked.    She gave him both her hands:    \"You have saved me from Rossigny. You have given me back my freedom and my  independence. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.\"    \"Oh, that's not what I am asking you to say!\" he answered. \"My first and  main object was to amuse you. Your life seemed so humdrum and lacking in  the unexpected. Has it been so to-day?\"    \"How can you ask such a question? I have had the strangest and most  stirring experiences.\"    \"That is life,\" he said. \"When one knows how to use one's eyes. Adventure  exists everywhere, in the meanest hovel, under the mask of the wisest of  men. Everywhere, if you are only willing, you will find an excuse for  excitement, for doing good, for saving a victim, for ending an injustice.\"    Impressed by his power and authority, she murmured:    \"Who are you exactly?\"    \"An adventurer. Nothing more. A lover of adventures. Life is not worth  living except in moments of adventure, the adventures of others or personal  adventures. To-day's has upset you because it affected the innermost depths  of your being. But those of others are no less stimulating. Would you like  to make the experiment?\"    \"How?\"    \"Become the companion of my adventures. If any one calls on me for help,  help him with me. If chance or instinct puts me on the track of a crime or  the trace of a sorrow, let us both set out together. Do you consent?\"    \"Yes,\" she said, \"but....\"    She hesitated, as though trying to guess Renine's secret intentions.    \"But,\" he said, expressing her thoughts for her, with a smile, \"you are a  trifle sceptical. What you are saying to yourself is, 'How far does that  lover of adventures want to make me go? It is quite obvious that I attract  him; and sooner or later he would not be sorry to receive payment for his  services.' You are quite right. We must have a formal contract.\"    \"Very formal,\" said Hortense, preferring to give a jesting tone to the  conversation. \"Let me hear your proposals.\"    He reflected for a moment and continued:    \"Well, we'll say this. The clock at Halingre gave eight strokes this  afternoon, the day of the first adventure. Will you accept its decree and  agree to carry out seven more of these delightful enterprises with me,  during a period, for instance, of three months? And shall we say that, at  the eighth, you will be pledged to grant me....\"    \"What?\"    He deferred his answer:    \"Observe that you will always be at liberty to leave me on the road if I  do not succeed in interesting you. But, if you accompany me to the end, if  you allow me to begin and complete the eighth enterprise with you, in three  months, on the 5th of December, at the very moment when the eighth stroke  of that clock sounds--and it will sound, you may be sure of that, for the  old brass pendulum will not stop swinging again--you will be pledged to  grant me....\"    \"What?\" she repeated, a little unnerved by waiting.    He was silent. He looked at the beautiful lips which he had meant to claim  as his reward. He felt perfectly certain that Hortense had understood and  he thought it unnecessary to speak more plainly:    \"The mere delight of seeing you will be enough to satisfy me. It is not for  me but for you to impose conditions. Name them: what do you demand?\"    She was grateful for his respect and said, laughingly:    \"What do I demand?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Can I demand anything I like, however difficult and impossible?\"    \"Everything is easy and everything is possible to the man who is bent on  winning you.\"    Then she said:    \"I demand that you shall restore to me a small, antique clasp, made of a  cornelian set in a silver mount. It came to me from my mother and everyone  knew that it used to bring her happiness and me too. Since the day when it  vanished from my jewel-case, I have had nothing but unhappiness. Restore it  to me, my good genius.\"    \"When was the clasp stolen?\"    She answered gaily:    \"Seven years ago ... or eight ... or nine; I don't know exactly ... I don't  know where ... I don't know how ... I know nothing about it....\"    \"I will find it,\" Renine declared, \"and you shall be happy.\"          II    THE WATER-BOTTLE      Four days after she had settled down in Paris, Hortense Daniel agreed to  meet Prince Renine in the Bois. It was a glorious morning and they sat down  on the terrace of the Restaurant Imperial, a little to one side.    Hortense, feeling glad to be alive, was in a playful mood, full of  attractive grace. Renine, lest he should startle her, refrained from  alluding to the compact into which they had entered at his suggestion.  She told him how she had left La Mareze and said that she had not heard  of Rossigny.    \"I have,\" said Renine. \"I've heard of him.\"    \"Oh?\"    \"Yes, he sent me a challenge. We fought a duel this morning. Rossigny got  a scratch in the shoulder. That finished the duel. Let's talk of something  else.\"    There was no further mention of Rossigny. Renine at once expounded to  Hortense the plan of two enterprises which he had in view and in which he  offered, with no great enthusiasm, to let her share:    \"The finest adventure,\" he declared, \"is that which we do not foresee. It  comes unexpectedly, unannounced; and no one, save the initiated, realizes  that an opportunity to act and to expend one's energies is close at hand.  It has to be seized at once. A moment's hesitation may mean that we are too  late. We are warned by a special sense, like that of a sleuth-hound which  distinguishes the right scent from all the others that cross it.\"    The terrace was beginning to fill up around them. At the next table sat  a young man reading a newspaper. They were able to see his insignificant  profile and his long, dark moustache. From behind them, through an open  window of the restaurant, came the distant strains of a band; in one of  the rooms a few couples were dancing.    As Renine was paying for the refreshments, the young man with the long  moustache stifled a cry and, in a choking voice, called one of the waiters:    \"What do I owe you?... No change? Oh, good Lord, hurry up!\"    Renine, without a moment's hesitation, had picked up the paper. After  casting a swift glance down the page, he read, under his breath:        \"Maitre Dourdens, the counsel for the defence in the trial of Jacques      Aubrieux, has been received at the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/792"],[0,"Wieland; Or, The Transformation: An American Tale (#5)"],[1," the due exercise of human understanding. In his studies,  he pursued an austerer and more arduous path. He was much conversant  with the history of religious opinions, and took pains to ascertain  their validity. He deemed it indispensable to examine the ground of  his belief, to settle the relation between motives and actions, the  criterion of merit, and the kinds and properties of evidence.    There was an obvious resemblance between him and my father, in their  conceptions of the importance of certain topics, and in the light in  which the vicissitudes of human life were accustomed to be viewed.  Their characters were similar, but the mind of the son was enriched by  science, and embellished with literature.    The temple was no longer assigned to its ancient use. From an Italian  adventurer, who erroneously imagined that he could find employment  for his skill, and sale for his sculptures in America, my brother had  purchased a bust of Cicero. He professed to have copied this piece from  an antique dug up with his own hands in the environs of Modena. Of the  truth of his assertions we were not qualified to judge; but the marble  was pure and polished, and we were contented to admire the performance,  without waiting for the sanction of connoisseurs. We hired the same  artist to hew a suitable pedestal from a neighbouring quarry. This was  placed in the temple, and the bust rested upon it. Opposite to this was  a harpsichord, sheltered by a temporary roof from the weather. This was  the place of resort in the evenings of summer. Here we sung, and talked,  and read, and occasionally banqueted. Every joyous and tender scene most  dear to my memory, is connected with this edifice. Here the performances  of our musical and poetical ancestor were rehearsed. Here my brother's  children received the rudiments of their education; here a thousand  conversations, pregnant with delight and improvement, took place; and  here the social affections were accustomed to expand, and the tear of  delicious sympathy to be shed.    My brother was an indefatigable student. The authors whom he read were  numerous, but the chief object of his veneration was Cicero. He was  never tired of conning and rehearsing his productions. To understand  them was not sufficient. He was anxious to discover the gestures and  cadences with which they ought to be delivered. He was very scrupulous  in selecting a true scheme of pronunciation for the Latin tongue, and in  adapting it to the words of his darling writer. His favorite occupation  consisted in embellishing his rhetoric with all the proprieties of  gesticulation and utterance.    Not contented with this, he was diligent in settling and restoring the  purity of the text. For this end, he collected all the editions and  commentaries that could be procured, and employed months of severe study  in exploring and comparing them. He never betrayed more satisfaction  than when he made a discovery of this kind.    It was not till the addition of Henry Pleyel, my friend's only brother,  to our society, that his passion for Roman eloquence was countenanced  and fostered by a sympathy of tastes. This young man had been some years  in Europe. We had separated at a very early age, and he was now returned  to spend the remainder of his days among us.    Our circle was greatly enlivened by the accession of a new member. His  conversation abounded with novelty. His gaiety was almost boisterous,  but was capable of yielding to a grave deportment when the occasion  required it. His discernment was acute, but he was prone to view every  object merely as supplying materials for mirth. His conceptions  were ardent but ludicrous, and his memory, aided, as he honestly  acknowledged, by his invention, was an inexhaustible fund of  entertainment.    His residence was at the same distance below the city as ours was above,  but there seldom passed a day without our being favoured with a visit.  My brother and he were endowed with the same attachment to the Latin  writers; and Pleyel was not behind his friend in his knowledge of the  history and metaphysics of religion. Their creeds, however, were in many  respects opposite. Where one discovered only confirmations of his faith,  the other could find nothing but reasons for doubt. Moral necessity,  and calvinistic inspiration, were the props on which my brother thought  proper to repose. Pleyel was the champion of intellectual liberty, and  rejected all guidance but that of his reason. Their discussions were  frequent, but, being managed with candour as well as with skill, they  were always listened to by us with avidity and benefit.    Pleyel, like his new friends, was fond of music and poetry. Henceforth  our concerts consisted of two violins, an harpsichord, and three voices.  We were frequently reminded how much happiness depends upon society.  This new friend, though, before his arrival, we were sensible of no  vacuity, could not now be spared. His departure would occasion a void  which nothing could fill, and which would produce insupportable regret.  Even my brother, though his opinions were hourly assailed, and even the  divinity of Cicero contested, was captivated with his friend, and laid  aside some part of his ancient gravity at Pleyel's approach.        Chapter IV      Six years of uninterrupted happiness had rolled away, since my brother's  marriage. The sound of war had been heard, but it was at such a distance  as to enhance our enjoyment by affording objects of comparison. The  Indians were repulsed on the one side, and Canada was conquered on the  other. Revolutions and battles, however calamitous to those who occupied  the scene, contributed in some sort to our happiness, by agitating our  minds with curiosity, and furnishing causes of patriotic exultation.  Four children, three of whom were of an age to compensate, by their  personal and mental progress, the cares of which they had been, at a  more helpless age, the objects, exercised my brother's tenderness. The  fourth was a charming babe that promised to display the image of her  mother, and enjoyed perfect health. To these were added a sweet girl  fourteen years old, who was loved by all of us, with an affection more  than parental.    Her mother's story was a mournful one. She had come hither from England  when this child was an infant, alone, without friends, and without  money. She appeared to have embarked in a hasty and clandestine  manner. She passed three years of solitude and anguish under my aunt's  protection, and died a martyr to woe; the source of which she could, by  no importunities, be prevailed upon to unfold. Her education and manners  bespoke her to be of no mean birth. Her last moments were rendered  serene, by the assurances she received from my aunt, that her daughter  should experience the same protection that had been extended to herself.    On my brother's marriage, it was agreed that she should make a part of  his family. I cannot do justice to the attractions of this girl. Perhaps  the tenderness she excited might partly originate in her personal  resemblance to her mother, whose character and misfortunes were  still fresh in our remembrance. She was habitually pensive, and this  circumstance tended to remind the spectator of her friendless condition;  and yet that epithet was surely misapplied in this case. This being was  cherished by those with whom she now resided, with unspeakable fondness.  Every exertion was made to enlarge and improve her mind. Her safety  was the object of a solicitude that almost exceeded the bounds of  discretion. Our affection indeed could scarcely transcend her merits.  She never met my eye, or occurred to my reflections, without exciting  a kind of enthusiasm. Her softness, her intelligence, her equanimity,  never shall I see surpassed. I have often shed tears of pleasure at her  approach, and pressed her to my bosom in an agony of fondness.    While every day was adding to the charms of her person, and the stores  of her mind, there occurred an event which threatened to deprive us  of her. An officer of some rank, who had been disabled by a wound  at Quebec, had employed himself, since the ratification of peace, in  travelling through the colonies. He remained a considerable period at  Philadelphia, but was at last preparing for his departure. No one had  been more frequently honoured with his visits than Mrs. Baynton, a  worthy lady with whom our family were intimate. He went to her house  with a view to perform a farewell visit, and was on the point of taking  his leave, when I and my young friend entered the apartment. It is  impossible to describe the emotions of the stranger, when he fixed his  eyes upon my companion. He was motionless with surprise. He was unable  to conceal his feelings, but sat silently gazing at the spectacle before  him. At length he turned to Mrs. Baynton, and more by his looks and  gestures than by words, besought her for an explanation of the scene.  He seized the hand of the girl, who, in her turn, was surprised by his  behaviour, and drawing her forward, said in an eager and faultering  tone, Who is she? whence does she come? what is her name?    The answers that were given only increased the confusion of his  thoughts. He was successively told, that she was the daughter of one  whose name was Louisa Conway, who arrived among us at such a time, who  sedulously concealed her parentage, and the motives of her flight, whose  incurable griefs had finally destroyed her, and who had left this child  under the protection of her friends. Having heard the tale, he melted  into tears, eagerly clasped the young lady in his arms, and called  himself her father. When the tumults excited in his breast by this  unlooked-for meeting were somewhat subsided, he gratified our curiosity  by relating the following incidents.    \"Miss Conway was the only daughter of a banker in London, who discharged  towards her every"]]]
