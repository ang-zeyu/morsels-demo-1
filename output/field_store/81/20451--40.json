I remember her hair and eyes, and the curving and the feel  of her red mouth, and once when I was bolder than ordinary--But that  is hardly worth raking up at this late day. Well, I see these things  in memory as plainly as I now seem to see your face: but I can  recollect hardly anything she said. Perhaps, now I think of it, she  was not very intelligent, and said nothing worth remembering. But  the boy loved her, and was happy, because her lips and heart were  his, and he, as the saying is, had plucked a diamond from the  world's ring. True, she was a count's daughter and the sister of a  count: but in those days the boy quite firmly intended to become a  duke or an emperor or something of that sort, so the transient  discrepancy did not worry them.\"    \"I know. Why, Jurgen is going to be a duke, too,\" says she, very  proudly, \"though he did think, a great while ago, before he knew me,  of being a cardinal, on account of the robes. But cardinals are not  allowed to marry, you see--And I am forgetting your story, too! What  happened then?\"    \"They parted in September--with what vows it hardly matters now--and  the boy went into Gatinais, to win his spurs under the old Vidame de  Soyecourt. And presently--oh, a good while before Christmas!--came  the news that Dorothy la Desiree had married rich Heitman Michael.\"    \"But that is what I am called! And as you know, there is a Heitman  Michael who is always plaguing me. Is that not strange! for you tell  me all this happened a great while ago.\"    \"Indeed, the story is very old, and old it was when Methuselah was  teething. There is no older and more common story anywhere. As the  sequel, it would be heroic to tell you this boy's life was ruined.  But I do not think it was. Instead, he had learned all of a sudden  that which at twenty-one is heady knowledge. That was the hour which  taught him sorrow and rage, and sneering, too, for a redemption. Oh,  it was armor that hour brought him, and a humor to use it, because  no woman now could hurt him very seriously. No, never any more!\"    \"Ah, the poor boy!\" she said, divinely tender, and smiling as a  goddess smiles, not quite in mirth.    \"Well, women, as he knew by experience now, were the pleasantest of  playfellows. So he began to play. Rampaging through the world he  went in the pride of his youth and in the armor of his hurt. And  songs he made for the pleasure of kings, and sword-play he made for  the pleasure of men, and a whispering he made for the pleasure of  women, in places where renown was, and where he trod boldly, giving  pleasure to everybody, in those fine days. But the whispering, and  all that followed the whispering, was his best game, and the game he  played for the longest while, with many brightly colored playmates  who took the game more seriously than he did. And their faith in the  game's importance, and in him and his high-sounding nonsense, he  very often found amusing: and in their other chattels too he took  his natural pleasure. Then, when he had played sufficiently, he held  a consultation with divers waning appetites; and he married the  handsome daughter of an estimable pawnbroker in a fair line of  business. And he lived with his wife very much as two people  customarily live together. So, all in all, I would not say his life  was ruined.\"    \"Why, then, it was,\" said Dorothy. She stirred uneasily, with an  impatient sigh; and you saw that she was vaguely puzzled. \"Oh, but  somehow I think you are a very horrible old man: and you seem doubly  horrible in that glittering queer garment you are wearing.\"    \"No woman ever praised a woman's handiwork, and each of you is  particularly severe upon her own. But you are interrupting the  saga.\"    \"I do not see\"--and those large bright eyes of which the color was  so indeterminable and so dear to Jurgen, seemed even larger  now--\"but I do not see how there could well be any more.\"    \"Still, human hearts survive the benediction of the priest, as you may  perceive any day. This man, at least, inherited his father-in-law's  business, and found it, quite as he had anticipated, the fittest of  vocations for a cashiered poet. And so, I suppose, he was content. Ah,  yes; but after a while Heitman Michael returned from foreign parts,  along with his lackeys, and plate, and chest upon chest of merchandise,  and his fine horses, and his wife. And he who had been her lover could  see her now, after so many years, whenever he liked. She was a handsome  stranger. That was all. She was rather stupid. She was nothing  remarkable, one way or another. This respectable pawnbroker saw that  quite plainly: day by day he writhed under the knowledge. Because, as  I must tell you, he could not retain composure in her presence, even  now. No, he was never able to do that.\"    The girl somewhat condensed her brows over this information. \"You  mean that he still loved her. Why, but of course!\"    \"My child,\" says Jurgen, now with a reproving forefinger, \"you are  an incurable romanticist. The man disliked her and despised her. At  any event, he assured himself that he did. Well, even so, this  handsome stupid stranger held his eyes, and muddled his thoughts,  and put errors into his accounts: and when he touched her hand he  did not sleep that night as he was used to sleep. Thus he saw her,  day after day. And they whispered that this handsome and stupid  stranger had a liking for young men who aided her artfully to  deceive her husband: but she never showed any such favor to the  respectable pawnbroker. For youth had gone out of him, and it seemed  that nothing in particular happened. Well, that was his saga. About  her I do not know. And I shall never know! But certainly she got the  name of deceiving Heitman Michael with two young men, or with five  young men it might be, but never with a respectable pawnbroker.\"    \"I think that is an exceedingly cynical and stupid story,\" observed  the girl. \"And so I shall be off to look for Jurgen. For he makes  love very amusingly,\" says Dorothy, with the sweetest, loveliest  meditative smile that ever was lost to heaven.    And a madness came upon Jurgen, there in the garden between dawn and  sunrise, and a disbelief in such injustice as now seemed incredible.    \"No, Heart's Desire,\" he cried, \"I will not let you go. For you are  dear and pure and faithful, and all my evil dream, wherein you were  a wanton and be-fooled me, was not true. Surely, mine was a dream  that can never be true so long as there is any justice upon earth.  Why, there is no imaginable God who would permit a boy to be robbed  of that which in my evil dream was taken from me!\"    \"And still I cannot understand your talking, about this dream of  yours--!\"    \"Why, it seemed to me I had lost the most of myself; and there was  left only a brain which played with ideas, and a body that went  delicately down pleasant ways. And I could not believe as my fellows  believed, nor could I love them, nor could I detect anything in  aught they said or did save their exceeding folly: for I had lost  their cordial common faith in the importance of what use they made  of half-hours and months and years; and because a jill-flirt had  opened my eyes so that they saw too much, I had lost faith in the  importance of my own actions, too. There was a little time of which  the passing might be made endurable; beyond gaped unpredictable  darkness: and that was all there was of certainty anywhere. Now tell  me, Heart's Desire, but was not that a foolish dream? For these  things never happened. Why, it would not be fair if these things  ever happened!\"    And the girl's eyes were wide and puzzled and a little frightened.  \"I do not understand what you are saying: and there is that about  you which troubles me unspeakably. For you call me by the name which  none but Jurgen used, and it seems to me that you are Jurgen; and  yet you are not Jurgen.\"    \"But I am truly Jurgen. And look you, I have done what never any man  has done before! For I have won back to that first love whom every  man must lose, no matter whom he marries. I have come back again,  passing very swiftly over the grave of a dream and through the  malice of time, to my Heart's Desire! And how strange it seems that  I did not know this thing was inevitable!\"    \"Still, friend, I do not understand you.\"    \"Why, but I yawned and fretted in preparation for some great and  beautiful adventure which was to befall me by and by, and dazedly I  toiled forward. Whereas behind me all the while was the garden  between dawn and sunrise, and therein you awaited me! Now assuredly,  the life of every man is a quaintly builded tale, in which the right  and proper ending comes first. Thereafter time runs forward, not as  schoolmen fable in a straight line, but in a vast closed curve,  returning to the place of its starting. And it is by a dim  foreknowledge of this, by some faint prescience of justice and  reparation being given them by and by, that men have heart to live.  For I know now that I have always known this thing. What else was  living good for unless it brought me back to you?\"    But the girl shook her small glittering head, very sadly. \"I do not  understand you, and I fear you. For you talk foolishness and in your  face I see the face of Jurgen as one might see the face of a dead  man drowned in muddy water.\"    \"Yet am I truly Jurgen, and, as it seems to me, for the first time  since we were parted. For I am strong and admirable--even I, who  sneered and played so long, because I thought myself a thing of  no worth at all. That which has been since you and I were young  together is as a mist that passes: and I am strong and admirable,  and all my being is one vast hunger for you, my dearest, and I will  not let you go, for you, and you alone, are my Heart's Desire.\"    Now the girl was looking at him very steadily, with a small puzzled  frown, and with her vivid young soft lips a little parted."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8789"],[0,"The vision of hell.

Against her nought avails  Your utmost wisdom.  She with foresight plans,  Judges, and carries on her reign, as theirs  The other powers divine.  Her changes know  None intermission: by necessity  She is made swift, so frequent come who claim  Succession in her favours.  This is she,  So execrated e'en by those, whose debt  To her is rather praise; they wrongfully  With blame requite her, and with evil word;  But she is blessed, and for that recks not:  Amidst the other primal beings glad  Rolls on her sphere, and in her bliss exults.  Now on our way pass we, to heavier woe  Descending: for each star is falling now,  That mounted at our entrance, and forbids  Too long our tarrying.\"  We the circle cross'd  To the next steep, arriving at a well,  That boiling pours itself down to a foss  Sluic'd from its source.  Far murkier was the wave  Than sablest grain: and we in company  Of the inky waters, journeying by their side,  Enter'd, though by a different track, beneath.  Into a lake, the Stygian nam'd, expands  The dismal stream, when it hath reach'd the foot  Of the grey wither'd cliffs.  Intent I stood  To gaze, and in the marish sunk descried  A miry tribe, all naked, and with looks  Betok'ning rage.  They with their hands alone  Struck not, but with the head, the breast, the feet,  Cutting each other piecemeal with their fangs.    The good instructor spake; \"Now seest thou, son!  The souls of those, whom anger overcame.  This too for certain know, that underneath  The water dwells a multitude, whose sighs  Into these bubbles make the surface heave,  As thine eye tells thee wheresoe'er it turn.\"  Fix'd in the slime they say: \"Sad once were we  In the sweet air made gladsome by the sun,  Carrying a foul and lazy mist within:  Now in these murky settlings are we sad.\"  Such dolorous strain they gurgle in their throats.  But word distinct can utter none.\"  Our route  Thus compass'd we, a segment widely stretch'd  Between the dry embankment, and the core  Of the loath'd pool, turning meanwhile our eyes  Downward on those who gulp'd its muddy lees;  Nor stopp'd, till to a tower's low base we came.          CANTO VIII    MY theme pursuing, I relate that ere  We reach'd the lofty turret's base, our eyes  Its height ascended, where two cressets hung  We mark'd, and from afar another light  Return the signal, so remote, that scarce  The eye could catch its beam.  I turning round  To the deep source of knowledge, thus inquir'd:  \"Say what this means?  and what that other light  In answer set?  what agency doth this?\"    \"There on the filthy waters,\" he replied,  \"E'en now what next awaits us mayst thou see,  If the marsh-gender'd fog conceal it not.\"    Never was arrow from the cord dismiss'd,  That ran its way so nimbly through the air,  As a small bark, that through the waves I spied  Toward us coming, under the sole sway  Of one that ferried it, who cried aloud:  \"Art thou arriv'd, fell spirit?\"--\"Phlegyas, Phlegyas,  This time thou criest in vain,\" my lord replied;  \"No longer shalt thou have us, but while o'er  The slimy pool we pass.\"  As one who hears  Of some great wrong he hath sustain'd, whereat  Inly he pines; so Phlegyas inly pin'd  In his fierce ire.  My guide descending stepp'd  Into the skiff, and bade me enter next  Close at his side; nor till my entrance seem'd  The vessel freighted.  Soon as both embark'd,  Cutting the waves, goes on the ancient prow,  More deeply than with others it is wont.    While we our course o'er the dead channel held.  One drench'd in mire before me came, and said;  \"Who art thou, that thou comest ere thine hour?\"    I answer'd: \"Though I come, I tarry not;  But who art thou, that art become so foul?\"    \"One, as thou seest, who mourn:\" he straight replied.    To which I thus: \"In mourning and in woe,  Curs'd spirit! tarry thou.g I know thee well,  E'en thus in filth disguis'd.\"  Then stretch'd he forth  Hands to the bark; whereof my teacher sage  Aware, thrusting him back: \"Away! down there;    \"To the other dogs!\" then, with his arms my neck  Encircling, kiss'd my cheek, and spake: \"O soul  Justly disdainful! blest was she in whom  Thou was conceiv'd!  He in the world was one  For arrogance noted; to his memory  No virtue lends its lustre; even so  Here is his shadow furious.  There above  How many now hold themselves mighty kings  Who here like swine shall wallow in the mire,  Leaving behind them horrible dispraise!\"    I then: \"Master! him fain would I behold  Whelm'd in these dregs, before we quit the lake.\"    He thus: \"Or ever to thy view the shore  Be offer'd, satisfied shall be that wish,  Which well deserves completion.\"  Scarce his words  Were ended, when I saw the miry tribes  Set on him with such violence, that yet  For that render I thanks to God and praise  \"To Filippo Argenti:\" cried they all:  And on himself the moody Florentine  Turn'd his avenging fangs.  Him here we left,  Nor speak I of him more.  But on mine ear  Sudden a sound of lamentation smote,  Whereat mine eye unbarr'd I sent abroad.    And thus the good instructor: \"Now, my son!  Draws near the city, that of Dis is nam'd,  With its grave denizens, a mighty throng.\"    I thus: \"The minarets already, Sir!  There certes in the valley I descry,  Gleaming vermilion, as if they from fire  Had issu'd.\"  He replied: \"Eternal fire,  That inward burns, shows them with ruddy flame  Illum'd; as in this nether hell thou seest.\"    We came within the fosses deep, that moat  This region comfortless.  The walls appear'd  As they were fram'd of iron.  We had made  Wide circuit, ere a place we reach'd, where loud  The mariner cried vehement: \"Go forth!  The entrance is here!\"  Upon the gates I spied  More than a thousand, who of old from heaven  Were hurl'd.  With ireful gestures, \"Who is this,\"  They cried, \"that without death first felt, goes through  The regions of the dead?\"  My sapient guide  Made sign that he for secret parley wish'd;  Whereat their angry scorn abating, thus  They spake: \"Come thou alone; and let him go  Who hath so hardily enter'd this realm.  Alone return he by his witless way;  If well he know it, let him prove.  For thee,  Here shalt thou tarry, who through clime so dark  Hast been his escort.\" Now bethink thee, reader!  What cheer was mine at sound of those curs'd words.  I did believe I never should return.    \"O my lov'd guide! who more than seven times  Security hast render'd me, and drawn  From peril deep, whereto I stood expos'd,  Desert me not,\" I cried, \"in this extreme.  And if our onward going be denied,  Together trace we back our steps with speed.\"    My liege, who thither had conducted me,  Replied: \"Fear not: for of our passage none  Hath power to disappoint us, by such high  Authority permitted.  But do thou  Expect me here; meanwhile thy wearied spirit  Comfort, and feed with kindly hope, assur'd  I will not leave thee in this lower world.\"    This said, departs the sire benevolent,  And quits me.  Hesitating I remain  At war 'twixt will and will not in my thoughts.    I could not hear what terms he offer'd them,  But they conferr'd not long, for all at once  To trial fled within.  Clos'd were the gates  By those our adversaries on the breast  Of my liege lord: excluded he return'd  To me with tardy steps.  Upon the ground  His eyes were bent, and from his brow eras'd  All confidence, while thus with sighs he spake:  \"Who hath denied me these abodes of woe?\"  Then thus to me: \"That I am anger'd, think  No ground of terror: in this trial I  Shall vanquish, use what arts they may within  For hindrance.  This their insolence, not new,  Erewhile at gate less secret they display'd,  Which still is without bolt; upon its arch  Thou saw'st the deadly scroll: and even now  On this side of its entrance, down the steep,  Passing the circles, unescorted, comes  One whose strong might can open us this land.\"          CANTO IX    THE hue, which coward dread on my pale cheeks  Imprinted, when I saw my guide turn back,  Chas'd that from his which newly they had worn,  And inwardly restrain'd it.  He, as one  Who listens, stood attentive: for his eye  Not far could lead him through the sable air,  And the thick-gath'ring cloud.  \"It yet behooves  We win this fight\"--thus he began--\"if not--  Such aid to us is offer'd.--Oh, how long  Me seems it, ere the promis'd help arrive!\"    I noted, how the sequel of his words  Clok'd their beginning; for the last he spake  Agreed not with the first.  But not the less  My fear was at his saying; sith I drew  To import worse perchance, than that he held,  His mutilated speech.  \"Doth ever any  Into this rueful concave's extreme depth  Descend, out of the first degree, whose pain  Is deprivation merely of sweet hope?\"    Thus I inquiring. \"Rarely,\" he replied,  \"It chances, that among us any makes  This journey, which I wend.  Erewhile 'tis true  Once came I here beneath, conjur'd by fell  Erictho, sorceress, who compell'd the shades  Back to their bodies.  No long space my flesh  Was naked of me, when within these walls  She made me enter, to draw forth a spirit  From out of Judas' circle.  Lowest place  Is that of all, obscurest, and remov'd  Farthest from heav'n's all-circling orb.  The road  Full well I know: thou therefore rest secure.  That lake, the noisome stench exhaling, round  The city' of grief encompasses, which now  We may not enter without rage.\"  Yet more  He added: but I hold it not in mind,  For that mine eye toward the lofty tower  Had drawn me wholly, to its burning top.  Where in an instant I beheld uprisen  At once three hellish furies stain'd with blood:  In limb and motion feminine they seem'd;  Around them greenest hydras twisting roll'd  Their volumes; adders and cerastes crept  Instead of hair, and their fierce temples bound.
