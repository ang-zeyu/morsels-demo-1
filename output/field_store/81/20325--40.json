They  must get a good deal of their nourishment from the rich, thick air,  which seems composed of 85 per cent. of warm water, and the  remainder of the odours of Frangipani, orange flowers, magnolias,  oleanders, and roses, combined with others that demonstrate that the  inhabitants do not regard sanitary matters with the smallest degree  of interest.    There is one central street, and the others are neatly planned out  at right angles to it.  None of them are in any way paved or  metalled.  They are covered in much prettier fashion, and in a way  more suitable for naked feet, by green Bahama grass, save and except  those which are so nearly perpendicular that they have got every bit  of earth and grass cleared off them down to the red bed-rock, by the  heavy rain of the wet season.    In every direction natives are walking at a brisk pace, their naked  feet making no sound on the springy turf of the streets, carrying on  their heads huge burdens which are usually crowned by the hat of the  bearer, a large limpet-shaped affair made of palm leaves.  While  some carry these enormous bundles, others bear logs or planks of  wood, blocks of building stone, vessels containing palm-oil, baskets  of vegetables, or tin tea-trays on which are folded shawls.  As the  great majority of the native inhabitants of Sierra Leone pay no  attention whatever to where they are going, either in this world or  the next, the confusion and noise are out of all proportion to the  size of the town; and when, as frequently happens, a section of  actively perambulating burden-bearers charge recklessly into a  sedentary section, the members of which have dismounted their loads  and squatted themselves down beside them, right in the middle of the  fair way, to have a friendly yell with some acquaintances, the row  becomes terrific.    In among these crowds of country people walk stately Mohammedans,  Mandingoes, Akers, and Fulahs of the Arabised tribes of the Western  Soudan.  These are lithe, well-made men, and walk with a peculiarly  fine, elastic carriage.  Their graceful garb consists of a long  white loose-sleeved shirt, over which they wear either a long black  mohair or silk gown, or a deep bright blue affair, not altogether  unlike a University gown, only with more stuff in it and more folds.  They are undoubtedly the gentlemen of the Sierra Leone native  population, and they are becoming an increasing faction in the town,  by no means to the pleasure of the Christians.    But to the casual visitor at Sierra Leone the Mohammedan is a mere  passing sensation.  You neither feel a burning desire to laugh with,  or at him, as in the case of the country folks, nor do you wish to  punch his head, and split his coat up his back--things you yearn to  do to that perfect flower of Sierra Leone culture, who yells your  bald name across the street at you, condescendingly informs you that  you can go and get letters that are waiting for you, while he smokes  his cigar and lolls in the shade, or in some similar way displays  his second-hand rubbishy white culture--a culture far lower and less  dignified than that of either the stately Mandingo or the bush  chief.  I do not think that the Sierra Leone dandy really means half  as much insolence as he shows; but the truth is he feels too  insecure of his own real position, in spite of all the \"side\" he  puts on, and so he dare not be courteous like the Mandingo or the  bush Fan.    It is the costume of the people in Free Town and its harbour that  will first attract the attention of the newcomer, notwithstanding  the fact that the noise, the smell, and the heat are simultaneously  making desperate bids for that favour.  The ordinary man in the  street wears anything he may have been able to acquire, anyhow, and  he does not fasten it on securely.  I fancy it must be capillary  attraction, or some other partially-understood force, that takes  part in the matter.  It is certainly neither braces nor buttons.  There are, of course, some articles which from their very structure  are fairly secure, such as an umbrella with the stick and ribs  removed, or a shirt.  This last-mentioned treasure, which usually  becomes the property of the ordinary man from a female relative or  admirer taking in white men's washing, is always worn flowing free,  and has such a charm in itself that the happy possessor cares little  what he continues his costume with--trousers, loin cloth, red  flannel petticoat, or rice-bag drawers, being, as he would put it,  \"all same for one\" to him.    The ladies are divided into three classes; the young girl you  address as \"tee-tee\"; the young person as \"seester\"; the more mature  charmer as \"mammy\"; but I do not advise you to employ these terms  when you are on your first visit, because you might get  misunderstood.  For, you see, by addressing a mammy as seester, she  might think either that you were unconscious of her dignity as a  married lady--a matter she would soon put you right on--or that you  were flirting, which of course was totally foreign to your  intention, and would make you uncomfortable.  My advice is that you  rigidly stick to missus or mammy.  I have seen this done most  successfully.    The ladies are almost as varied in their costume as the gentlemen,  but always neater and cleaner; and mighty picturesque they are too,  and occasionally very pretty.  A market-woman with her jolly brown  face and laughing brown eyes--eyes all the softer for a touch of  antimony--her ample form clothed in a lively print overall, made  with a yoke at the shoulders, and a full long flounce which is  gathered on to the yoke under the arms and falls fully to the feet;  with her head done up in a yellow or red handkerchief, and her snowy  white teeth gleaming through her vast smiles, is a mighty pleasant  thing to see, and to talk to.  But, Allah! the circumference of  them!    The stone-built, white-washed market buildings of Free Town have a  creditably clean and tidy appearance considering the climate, and  the quantity and variety of things exposed for sale--things one  wants the pen of a Rabelais to catalogue.  Here are all manner of  fruits, some which are familiar to you in England; others that soon  become so to you in Africa.  You take them as a matter of course if  you are outward bound, but on your call homeward (if you make it)  you will look on them as a blessing and a curiosity.  For lower  down, particularly in \"the Rivers,\" these things are rarely to be  had, and never in such perfection as here; and to see again  lettuces, yellow oranges, and tomatoes bigger than marbles is a  sensation and a joy.    One of the chief features of Free Town are the jack crows.  Some  writers say they are peculiar to Sierra Leone, others that they are  not, but both unite in calling them Picathartes gymnocephalus.  To  the white people who live in daily contact with them they are turkey  buzzards; to the natives, Yubu.  Anyhow they are evil-looking fowl,  and no ornament to the roof-ridges they choose to sit on.  The  native Christians ought to put a row of spikes along the top of  their cathedral to keep them off; the beauty of that edifice is very  far from great, and it cannot carry off the effect produced by the  row of these noisome birds as they sit along its summit, with their  wings arranged at all manner of different angles in an \"all gone\"  way.  One bird perhaps will have one straight out in front, and the  other casually disposed at right-angles, another both straight out  in front, and others again with both hanging hopelessly down, but  none with them neatly and tidily folded up, as decent birds' wings  should be.  They all give the impression of having been extremely  drunk the previous evening, and of having subsequently fallen into  some sticky abomination--into blood for choice.  Being the  scavengers of Free Town, however, they are respected by the local  authorities and preserved; and the natives tell me you never see  either a young or a dead one.  The latter is a thing you would not  expect, for half of them look as if they could not live through the  afternoon.  They also told me that when you got close to them, they  had a \"'trong, 'trong 'niff; 'niff too much.\"  I did not try, but I  am quite willing to believe this statement.    The other animals most in evidence in the streets are, first and  foremost, goats and sheep.  I have to lump them together, for it is  exceedingly difficult to tell one from the other.  All along the  Coast the empirical rule is that sheep carry their tails down, and  goats carry their tails up; fortunately you need not worry much  anyway, for they both \"taste rather like the nothing that the world  was made of,\" as Frau Buchholtz says, and own in addition a fibrous  texture, and a certain twang.  Small cinnamon-coloured cattle are to  be got here, but horses there are practically none.  Now and again  some one who does not see why a horse should not live here as well  as at Accra or Lagos imports one, but it always shortly dies.  Some  say it is because the natives who get their living by hammock-  carrying poison them, others say the tsetse fly finishes them off;  and others, and these I believe are right, say that entozoa are the  cause.  Small, lean, lank yellow dogs with very erect ears lead an  awful existence, afflicted by many things, but beyond all others by  the goats, who, rearing their families in the grassy streets, choose  to think the dogs intend attacking them.  Last, but not least, there  is the pig--a rich source of practice to the local lawyer.    Cape Coast Castle and then Accra were the next places of general  interest at which we stopped.  The former looks well from the  roadstead, and as if it had very recently been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59"],[0,"Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One's Reason and of Seeking Truth (#5)"],[1,"desire, they will come at least in the end to some place that will  probably be preferable to the middle of a forest.  In the same way,  since in action it frequently happens that no delay is permissible, it  is very certain that, when it is not in our power to determine what is  true, we ought to act according to what is most probable; and even  although we should not remark a greater probability in one opinion than  in another, we ought notwithstanding to choose one or the other, and  afterwards consider it, in so far as it relates to practice, as no  longer dubious, but manifestly true and certain,  since the reason by  which our choice has been determined  is itself possessed of these  qualities.  This principle was sufficient thenceforward to rid me of  all those repentings and pangs of remorse that usually disturb the  consciences of such feeble and uncertain minds as, destitute of any  clear and determinate principle of choice, allow themselves one day to  adopt a course of action as the best, which they abandon the next, as  the opposite.    My third maxim was to endeavor always to conquer myself rather than  fortune, and change my desires rather than the order of the world, and  in general, accustom  myself to the persuasion that, except our own  thoughts, there is nothing absolutely in our power; so that when we  have done our best in things external to us, all wherein we fail of  success is to be held, as regards us, absolutely impossible:  and this  single principle seemed to me sufficient to prevent me from desiring  for the future anything which I could not obtain, and thus render me  contented; for since our will naturally seeks those objects alone which  the understanding represents as in some way possible of attainment, it  is plain, that if we consider all external goods as equally beyond our  power, we shall no more regret the absence of such goods as seem due to  our birth, when deprived of them without any fault of ours,  than our  not possessing the kingdoms of China or Mexico, and thus making, so to  speak, a virtue of necessity, we shall no more desire health in  disease, or freedom in imprisonment, than we now do bodies  incorruptible as diamonds, or the wings of birds to fly with.  But I  confess there is need of prolonged discipline and frequently repeated  meditation to accustom the mind to view all objects in this light; and  I believe that in this chiefly consisted the secret of the power of  such philosophers as in former times were enabled to rise superior to  the influence of fortune, and, amid suffering and poverty, enjoy a  happiness which their gods might have envied.  For, occupied  incessantly with the consideration of the limits prescribed to their  power by nature, they became so entirely convinced that nothing was at  their disposal except their own thoughts, that this conviction was of  itself sufficient to prevent their entertaining any desire of other  objects; and over their thoughts they acquired a sway so absolute, that  they had some ground on this account for esteeming themselves more rich  and more powerful, more free and more happy, than other men who,  whatever be the favors heaped on them by nature and fortune, if  destitute of this philosophy, can never command the realization of all  their desires.    In fine, to conclude this code of morals, I thought of reviewing the  different occupations of men in this life, with the view of making  choice of the best.  And, without wishing to offer any remarks on the  employments of others, I may state that it was my conviction that I  could not do better than continue in that in which I was engaged, viz.,  in devoting my whole life to the culture of my reason, and in making  the greatest progress I was able in the knowledge of truth, on the  principles of the method which I had prescribed to myself.  This  method, from the time I had begun to apply it, had been to me the  source of satisfaction so intense as to lead me to, believe that more  perfect or more innocent could not be enjoyed in this life; and as by  its means I daily discovered truths that appeared to me of some  importance, and of which other men were generally ignorant, the  gratification thence arising so occupied my mind that I was wholly  indifferent to every other object.  Besides, the three preceding maxims  were founded singly on the design of continuing the work of  self-instruction.  For since God has endowed each of us with some light  of reason by which to distinguish truth from error, I could not have  believed that I ought for a single moment to rest satisfied with the  opinions of another, unless I had resolved to exercise my own judgment  in examining these whenever I should be duly qualified for the task.  Nor could I have proceeded on such opinions without scruple, had I  supposed that I should thereby forfeit any advantage for attaining  still more accurate, should such exist.  And, in fine, I could not have  restrained my desires, nor remained satisfied had I not followed a path  in which I thought myself certain of attaining all the knowledge to the  acquisition of which I was competent, as well as the largest amount of  what is truly good which I could ever hope to secure Inasmuch as we  neither seek nor shun any object except in so far as our understanding  represents it as good or bad, all that is necessary to right action is  right judgment, and to the best action the most correct judgment, that  is, to the acquisition of all the virtues with all else that is truly  valuable and within our reach; and the assurance of such an acquisition  cannot fail to render us contented.    Having thus provided myself with these maxims, and having placed them  in reserve along with the truths of  faith, which have ever occupied  the first place in my  belief, I came to the conclusion that I might  with freedom set about ridding myself of what remained of my opinions.  And, inasmuch as I hoped to be better able successfully to accomplish  this work by holding intercourse with mankind, than by remaining longer  shut up in the retirement where these thoughts had occurred to me, I  betook me again to traveling before the winter was well ended.  And,  during the nine subsequent years, I did nothing but roam from one place  to another, desirous of being a  spectator rather than an actor in the  plays exhibited on the theater of the world; and, as I made it my  business in each matter to reflect particularly upon what might fairly  be doubted and prove a source of error, I gradually rooted out from my  mind all the errors which had hitherto crept into it.  Not that in this  I imitated the sceptics who doubt only that they may doubt, and seek  nothing beyond uncertainty itself; for, on the contrary, my design  was  singly to find ground of assurance, and cast aside the  loose earth and  sand, that I might reach the rock or the clay.  In this, as appears to  me, I was successful enough; for, since I endeavored to discover the  falsehood or incertitude of the propositions I examined, not by feeble  conjectures, but by clear and certain reasonings, I met with nothing so  doubtful as not to yield some conclusion of adequate certainty,  although this were merely the inference, that the matter in question  contained nothing certain.  And, just as in pulling down an old house,  we usually reserve the ruins to contribute towards the erection, so, in  destroying such of my opinions as I judged to be Ill-founded, I made a  variety of observations and acquired an amount of experience of which I  availed myself in the establishment of more certain.  And further, I  continued to exercise myself in the method I had prescribed; for,  besides taking care in general to conduct all my thoughts according to  its rules, I reserved some hours from time to time which I expressly  devoted to the employment of the method in the solution of mathematical  difficulties, or even in the solution likewise of some questions  belonging to other sciences, but which, by my having detached them from  such principles of these sciences as were of inadequate certainty, were  rendered almost mathematical:  the truth of this will be manifest from  the numerous examples contained in this volume.  And thus, without in  appearance living otherwise than those who, with no other occupation  than that of spending their lives agreeably and innocently, study to  sever pleasure from vice, and who, that they may enjoy their leisure  without ennui, have recourse to such pursuits as are honorable, I was  nevertheless prosecuting my design, and making greater progress in the  knowledge of truth, than I might, perhaps, have made had I been engaged  in the perusal of books merely, or in holding converse with men of  letters.    These nine years passed away, however, before I had come to any  determinate judgment respecting the difficulties which form matter of  dispute among the learned, or had commenced to seek the principles of  any philosophy more certain than the vulgar.  And the examples of many  men of the highest genius, who had, in former times, engaged in this  inquiry, but, as appeared to me, without success, led me to imagine it  to be a work of so much difficulty, that I would not perhaps have  ventured on it so soon had I not heard it currently  rumored that I had  already completed the inquiry.  I know not what were the grounds of  this opinion; and, if my conversation contributed in any measure to its  rise, this must have happened rather from my having confessed my  Ignorance with greater freedom than those are accustomed to do who have  studied a little, and expounded perhaps, the reasons that led me to  doubt of many of those things that by others are esteemed certain, than  from my having boasted of any system of philosophy.  But, as I am of a  disposition that makes me unwilling to be esteemed different from what  I really am, I thought it necessary to endeavor by all means to"]]]
