Nora and I will be in a conservatory, Grace will  be in college and Anne--where will you be, Anne?\"    \"Goodness knows,\" replied Anne. \"I'd like to try for a scholarship, but  how on earth would I support myself even if I were fortunate enough to  win?\"    \"Don't worry about that,\" said Grace quickly. \"That is for that all-wise  body, the Phi Sigma Tau, to consider. We will be your ways and means  committee, Anna.\"    \"Oh, I couldn't think of weighing you girls down with my cares,\" replied  Anne soberly. \"I must work out my own salvation.\"    By this time they had turned out of High School Street and were moving  in the direction of Grace's home, where the majority of their chats took  place, when Nora suddenly exclaimed in a low tone:    \"Look, girls, there is Eleanor Savelli!\"    \"Where? where?\" demanded three eager voices, as their owners followed  Nora's glance.    \"Across the street,\" replied Nora. \"Don't let her know that we are  looking at her.\"    Sure enough, on the opposite side of the street, Eleanor Savelli was to  be seen strolling along in company with Edna Wright and Daisy Culver,  two seniors who had been her faithful followers since her advent in  Oakdale.    \"Excitement number one,\" remarked Nora. \"The fair Eleanor comes and our  peace of mind departs. I had cherished vain hopes that she wouldn't  favor us with the light of her countenance this year, even though she  did inform Grace of her laudable desire to stay with the seniors for  pure spite.\"    \"Never mind, Nora,\" said Jessica, \"I don't believe she'll worry herself  about us, even though she did make dire threats.\"    \"Remember what I told you last year, girls,\" said Grace in a tone of  admonition. \"Be careful what you do and say whenever she is near. She  despises the Phi Sigma Tau and would revenge herself upon us at the  slightest opportunity. She comes of a race who swear vendettas.\"    \"She better not swear any when I am around,\" retorted Nora with spirit,  \"or she will find that the Irish are equal to the occasion.\"    \"Don't excite yourself needlessly, Nora,\" laughed Anne. \"That splendid  Hibernian energy of yours is worthy of a better cause.\"    \"How provoking!\" suddenly exclaimed Grace. \"I've left my library book in  the gym. and it's a week overdue now. I shall simply have to go back and  get it. It's only three o'clock,\" she added, consulting her watch. \"Who  will go with me?\"    \"Of what use is it for all of us to go,\" complained Nora. \"We'll wait  right here for you and you can hurry faster by going alone.\"    \"All right, lazy, unsocial creatures,\" said Grace good-humoredly. \"I'm  off. Be sure you wait.\"    She hurried in the direction of the High School and in an incredibly  short time was running down the corridor of the wing that led to the  gymnasium. Remembering that she had laid her book on the window sill,  Grace lost no time in securing it, and taking it under her arm waited  toward the door. Suddenly the faint smell of smoke was borne to her  nostrils.    She sniffed the air, then murmured, \"I wonder what's burning. The smell  seems to come from over there. Perhaps I'd better look around. It won't  take a second.\"    She slowly retraced her steps, looking carefully about her. There was no  smoke to be seen. She turned to go, then impelled by some mysterious  influence, her eye traveled to the door of the small room at the left of  the gymnasium.    With a cry of consternation she sped across the floor, flung open the  door and staggered back, choked by a perfect volume of smoke that issued  from within. The interior of the room was in flames.    To think was to act. Unless help arrived speedily their beloved  gymnasium would soon be a thing of the past. Grace tore through the  corridor like a wild girl, and darted out the door and across the  campus. There was a fire alarm on the street below the High School, and  toward this she directed her steps.    Pausing an instant before the box, she looked about her for something  with which to break the glass. Spying a small boy strolling toward her,  a baseball bat in his hand, she pounced upon him, seized the bat before  he knew what had happened and smashed the glass with one blow. Giving  the ring inside a vigorous pull, Grace shoved the bat into the hands of  the astonished youngster and made for the nearest telephone.    Hurrying into Stillman's, she discovered to her disgust that the  telephone was in use, but a moment later she was at the door and again  out on the street. Her quick ear had caught the clang of the bell on the  fire engines, and the thing to do now was to go back to her chums with  the news--and then off to the fire.    \"The gymnasium is on fire!\" she cried, as she neared the spot where they  awaited her. \"Hurry, all of you! Perhaps we may be of some help.\"    Her three friends needed no second invitation and throwing all dignity  to the winds, raced down the street in the direction of the burning  building. When they reached the High School smoke was issuing from the  windows of the gymnasium, and from the roof and chimneys, and situated  as it was like a connecting link between the two buildings, it was an  easy matter for the flames to spread in either direction.    Even in the short time it had taken Grace to turn in the alarm, the fire  had made tremendous headway, and great tongues of flame shot up toward  the sky. The roof had caught and was burning rapidly, although the  firemen played a constant stream upon it.    As the fire grew hotter, the other companies were called out, and soon  the entire Oakdale Fire Department was at work.    Ropes had been stretched around the burning part of the building to keep  venturesome citizens outside the fire belt. Grace stood as close as she  dared, Nora, Anne and Jessica at her side.    \"Oh, do, do save our gymnasium!\" she shrieked, as several firemen  hurried past her.    \"Can't do it, miss,\" replied one of them. \"It's a goner. If we save the  school we'll do well, let alone the gymnasium.\"    Long and strenuously the firemen fought the hungry flames. The wind was  in the wrong direction, and helped to fan the blaze. One of the  gymnasium walls fell in with a terrific crash, almost carrying with it  two firemen who had been playing a stream from the rung of a ladder that  leaned against it. There was a cry of horror from the assembled crowd  that changed to a sigh of relief when it was discovered that the two men  had saved themselves by leaping.    \"Oh, if only I were a man,\" breathed Grace, as she watched the firemen's  efforts to gain control of the situation. \"I wouldn't stay here a  moment. I'd be in the thick of the fight.\"    \"Hold her girls, or she'll dash straight over the ropes,\" said Nora.    \"I'd like to,\" retorted Grace. \"It's dreadful to stand here unable to  help and see our dear old gym. go, and perhaps our school, too.\"    \"Well, you turned in the alarm, and that's a whole lot,\" declared  Jessica stoutly. \"If you hadn't seen the blaze when you did things might  be a good deal worse. As it is, I believe they are getting the fire  under control.\"    \"It does look that way,\" exclaimed Anne. \"See, the flames are dying out  over on that side. Oh, if it would only rain and help things along.\"    \"I believe it will rain before night. The clouds look heavy and  threatening,\" declared Nora, squinting at the sky.    \"The weather prophet has come to town,\" smiled Anne.    For the next hour the girls stood eagerly watching the gallant work of  the firemen. A dense crowd, composed largely of High School boys and  girls, packed the campus, while people blocked the streets outside the  gates. Intense excitement prevailed, and when it became evident that the  main building was safe a mighty cheer went up from the crowd.    \"Bless their hearts!\" exclaimed Grace. \"They are just as fond as we are  of Oakdale High School. But, oh, girls, where are we going to play  basketball!\"    The girls looked at each other in dismay.    \"What is life without basketball?\" said Nora sadly.    \"True enough,\" said Anne, \"but even though the gym. is gone we still  have our school. It would be simply terrible to have had it go in our  senior year.\"    \"No doubt the gym. will be rebuilt at once,\" remarked Jessica.    \"I am not so sure of that,\" replied Grace. \"My father belongs to the  common council, and I heard him tell mother the other day that the High  School had been refused an appropriation that they had asked for.\"    \"Oh, well, then, we High School pupils will raise the money ourselves,\"  said Nora lightly.    \"That idea is worth looking into,\" said Grace eagerly. \"We might help a  great deal.\"    \"Grace has the 'Busy Little Helper' stunt on the brain,\" jeered Jessica.    \"Anything to keep matters moving,\" laughed Grace. \"I'm an advocate of  the strenuous life. But seriously, girls, how splendid it would be to  feel that we had been instrumental in rebuilding the gymnasium.\"    \"Fine,\" agreed Nora. \"We used to sing a song in kindergarten when I was  very young and foolish that started out, 'We are little builders,'  although at that time I never expected to really become one.\"    \"Nora,\" said Grace severely, \"you have all Hippy's bad traits and some  of your own thrown in.\"    It was nearing six o'clock before the four friends left the scene of the  fire"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49507"],[0,"Siegfried & The Twilight of the Gods (#5)"],[1,"Make in his pot?

The ground rises towards a flat knoll in the middle      of the stage, and slopes down again towards the      back, so that only the upper part of the entrance      to the cave is visible to the audience. To the left      a fissured cliff is seen through the trees. It is      night, the darkness being deepest at the back,      where at first the eye can distinguish nothing at      all._    ALBERICH            [_Lying by the cliff, gloomily brooding._        In night-drear woods  By Neidhöhl' I keep watch,      With ear alert,  Keen and anxious eye.      Timid day,      Tremblest thou forth?      Pale art thou dawning      Athwart the dark?            [_A storm arises in the wood on the right, and from          the same quarter there shines down a bluish light._    What comes yonder, gleaming bright?      Nearer shimmers      A radiant form;  It runs like a horse and it shines;      Breaks through the wood,      Rushing this way.  Is it the dragon's slayer?  Can it mean Fafner's death?            [_The wind subsides; the light vanishes._        The glow has gone,  It has faded and died;      All is darkness.  Who comes there, shining in shadow?    WANDERER            [_Enters from the wood, and stops opposite Alberich._        To Neidhöhl'      By night I have come;  In the dark who is hiding there?            [_As from a sudden rent in the clouds moonlight          streams forth and lights up the Wanderer's figure._    ALBERICH            [_Recognises the Wanderer and shrinks back at first          in alarm, but immediately after breaks out in          violent fury._    'Tis thou who comest thus?      What wilt thou here?      Go, get thee hence!  Begone, thou insolent thief!    WANDERER [_Quietly._        Schwarz-Alberich      Wanders here?  Guardest thou Fafner's house?    ALBERICH        Art thou intent      On mischief again?      Linger not here!      Off with thee straightway!      Has grief enough  Not deluged the earth through thy guile?      Spare it further      Sorrow, thou wretch!    WANDERER        I come as watcher,      Not as worker.  The Wanderer's way who bars?    ALBERICH    Thou arch, pestilent plotter!      Were I still the blind,      Silly fool that I was,  When I was bound thy captive,      How easy were it  To steal the ring again from me!      Beware! For thy cunning      I know well,            [_Mockingly._        And of thy weakness  I am fully aware too.      Thy debts were cancelled,      Paid with my treasure;      My ring guerdoned      The giants' toil,  Who raised thy citadel high.      Still on the mighty      Haft of thy spear there  The runes are written plain  Of the compact made with the churls;      And of that      Which by labour they won  Thou dost not dare to despoil them:      Thy spear's strong shaft      Thou thyself wouldst split;      The staff that makes thee      Master of all  Would crumble to dust in thy hand.    WANDERER    By the steadfast runes of treaties      Thou hast not,      Base one, been bound;  On thee my spear may spend its strength,  So keen I keep it for war.    ALBERICH        How dire thy threats!      How bold thy defiance!  And yet full of fear is thy heart!      Foredoomed to death      Through my curse is he  Who now guards the treasure.  What heir will succeed him?      Will the hoard all desire  Belong as before to the Niblung?--  That gnaws thee with ceaseless torment.      For once I have got it      Safe in my grasp,  Better than foolish giants  Will I employ its spell.      The God who guards heroes      Truly may tremble!      I will storm  Proud Walhall with Hella's hosts,  And rule, lord of the world!    WANDERER [_Quietly._        Thy design I know well,      But little I care:      Who wins the ring      Will rule by its might.    ALBERICH    Thou speakest darkly,  But to me all is plain.      Thy heart is bold      Because of a boy,            [_Mockingly._    A hero begot of thy blood.  Hast thou not fostered a stripling  To pluck the fruit thou durst not            [_With growing violence._    Pluck frankly for thyself?    WANDERER [_Lightly._        With me      'Tis useless to wrangle;  But Mime thou shouldst beware;  For thy brother brings here a boy  To compass the giant's doom.  He knows not of me;  He works for Mime alone.  And so I say to thee,  Do as seems to thee best.            [_Alberich makes a movement expressive of violent          curiosity._        Take my advice,      Be on thy guard:  The boy will hear of the ring  When Mime tells him the tale.    ALBERICH [_Violently._    Wilt thou hold thy hand from the hoard?    WANDERER        Whom I love  Must fight for himself unaided;      The lord of his fate,      He stands or falls:  All my hope hangs upon heroes.    ALDERICH        Does none but Mime      Dispute me the ring?    WANDERER        Only thou and Mime      Covet the gold.    ALDERICH    And yet it is not to be mine?    WANDERER [_Quietly coming nearer._        A hero comes      To set the hoard free;  Two Nibelungs yearn for the gold.      Fafner falls,      He who guards the ring;  Then a hand,"]]]
