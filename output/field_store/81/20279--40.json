CHAPTER VI.    Elect of Elohim.      In solemn council sat the Gods;    From Kolob's height supreme,    Celestial light blazed forth afar    O'er countless kokaubeam;    And faintest tinge, the fiery fringe    Of that resplendent day,    'Lumined the dark abysmal realm    Where earth in chaos lay.      Silence. That awful hour was one    When thought doth most avail;    Of worlds unborn the destiny    Hung trembling in the scale.    Silence self-spelled, and there arose,    Those kings and priests among,    A power sublime, than whom appeared    None nobler 'mid the throng.      A stature mingling strength with grace,    Of meek though God-like mien;    The glory of whose countenance    Outshone the noonday sheen.    Whiter his hair than ocean spray,    Or frost of Alpine hill.    He spake;--attention grew more grave,    The stillness e'en more still.      \"Father!\"--the voice like music fell,    Clear as the murmuring flow    Of mountain streamlet trickling down    From heights of virgin snow.    \"Father,\" it said, \"since one must die,    Thy children to redeem,    From spheres all formless now and void,    Where pulsing life shall teem:      \"And mighty Michael foremost fall,    That mortal man may be;    And chosen Savior yet must send,    Lo, here am I--send me!    I ask, I seek no recompense,    Save that which then were mine;    Mine be the willing sacrifice,    The endless glory Thine!      \"Give me to lead to this lorn world,    When wandered from the fold,    Twelve legions of the noble ones    That now thy face behold;    Tried souls, 'mid untried spirits found,    That captained these may be,    And crowned the dispensations all    With powers of Deity.      \"Who blameless bide the spirit state    Shall clothe in mortal clay,    The stepping-stone to glories all,    If man will God obey,    Believing where he cannot see,    Till he again shall know,    And answer give, reward receive,    For all deeds done below.      \"The love that hath redeemed all worlds    All worlds must still redeem;    But mercy cannot justice rob--    Or where were Elohim?    Freedom--man's faith, man's work, God's grace--    Must span the great gulf o'er;    Life, death, the guerdon or the doom,    Rejoice we or deplore.\"      Still rang that voice, when sudden rose    Aloft a towering form,    Proudly erect as lowering peak    'Lumed by the gathering storm;    A presence bright and beautiful,    With eye of flashing fire,    A lip whose haughty curl bespoke    A sense of inward ire:      \"Send me!\"--coiled 'neath his courtly smile    A scarce concealed disdain--    \"And none shall hence, from heaven to earth,    That shall not rise again;    My saving plan exception scorns.    Man's will?--Nay, mine alone.    As recompense, I claim the right    To sit on yonder throne!      \"Ceased Lucifer. The breathless hush    Resumed and denser grew.    All eyes were turned; the general gaze    One common Magnet drew.    A moment there was solemn pause--    Listened Eternity,    While rolled from lips Omnipotent    The Father's firm decree:      \"Jehovah, thou my Messenger!    Son Ahman, thee I send;    And one shall go thy face before,    While twelve thy steps attend;    And many more on that far shore,    The pathway shall prepare,    That I, the First, the last may come,    And earth my glory share.      \"After and ere thy going down,    An army shall descend--    The host of God, and house of him    Whom I have named my friend.    Through him, upon Idumea,    Shall come, all life to leaven,    The guileless ones, the sovereign Sons,    Throned on the heights of heaven.      \"Go forth, thou Chosen of the Gods,    Whose strength shall in thee dwell!    Go down betime and rescue earth,    Dethroning death and hell,    On thee alone man's fate depends,    The fate of beings all.    Thou shalt not fail, though thou art free--    Free, but too great to fall.      \"By arm divine, both mine and thine,    The lost thou shalt restore,    And man, redeemed, with God shall be,    As God forevermore.    Return, and to the parent fold    This wandering planet bring,    And Earth shall hail thee Conqueror,    And Heaven proclaim thee King.\"      'Twas done. From congregation vast    Tumultuous murmurs rose;    Waves of conflicting sound, as when    Two meeting seas oppose;    'Twas finished. But the Heavens wept;    And still their annals tell    How one was Choice of Elohim,    O'er one who fighting fell.      (\"Elias,\" Canto III, Part One.)        The Way of Salvation.    CHAPTER I.    The Law of Obedience.    Man Helpless.--When Adam and Eve had transgressed the divine command  by partaking of the forbidden fruit, it was as if the human race had  fallen into a pit, from which they were powerless, by any act of  their own, to emerge. They could not climb out, for they did not know  how to climb; and even had they known, there was no means by which  to climb. Human endeavor, unassisted, could accomplish nothing in  the way of deliverance. Man in his mortal condition needed spiritual  enlightenment, having forgotten all that he had previously known. In  other words, he needed a ladder, that he might climb out of the pit,  and that ladder was furnished in the revelation, of the Gospel of  Christ. Without it there is no salvation, no exaltation. The Tower of  Babel symbolizes the situation: All man's efforts to reach heaven,  without divine assistance, must end in confusion and failure.    Redemption by Grace.--The gospel ladder rests upon the rock of Christ's  atonement--an act of grace, a free gift from God to all mankind--the  wicked as well as the righteous. All profit by it, for, as the result  of that atonement, all are brought forth from the grave. And this is  eminently just: Adam's posterity were consigned to death for no deed of  their own doing. It is fitting, therefore, that their redemption should  come unconditionally.    Salvation by Obedience.--But redemption is not salvation, nor salvation  exaltation, as already explained. Men must \"work out their salvation\"  (Phillipians 2:12), and gain exaltation by continuous upward striving.  Salvation and exaltation, while depending primarily upon the grace  of God, are also the fruits of man's acceptance of the gospel, and  his steadfast adherence thereto, until it shall have done for him its  perfect work. There are degrees of glory--\"many mansions\" in the great  house of God, and the highest are reserved for those who render to the  Master of the house the fulness of their obedience.    \"Salvation means a man's being placed beyond the power of all his  enemies. * * * Until a man can triumph over death, he is not saved. *  * * To get salvation we must not only do some things, but everything  which God has commanded\" (\"Joseph Smith's Teachings,\" pp. 146-150).    Heaven's First Law.--\"Order is heaven's first law,\" says human wisdom.  \"Not so,\" says divine inspiration, \"obedience is heaven's first law,  and order follows as the result.\" [A] Without obedience, spiritual  growth, eternal progress, is impossible. Says Joseph the prophet:  \"There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundation of  this world, upon which all blessings are predicated; and when we obtain  any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is  predicated\" (D&C 130:20,21).    Illustrations of Obedience.--That obedience is required from those  who become and remain members of the Church of Christ, should not  surprise any intelligent student of political science, nor even  a casual observer of the everyday life of men and nations. All  governments demand from their people obedience to the laws enacted  for the general welfare. Without such obedience, there would be no  peace, no protection. This is readily conceded by most men as to human  governments; but some people think it strange that divine government  should be administered upon like principles, and for similar, though  higher, ends.    A friend of mine once said to me: \"Why do I need to belong to a church,  to subscribe to a creed, or to undergo any ordinance, in order to be  saved? I have always been truthful, honest, virtuous, benevolent--why  will this not suffice to make my peace with God and pave my way to  heaven?\"    Aliens and Naturalization.--I answered on this wise: \"Let me use a  comparison to illustrate the point. Suppose you were an alien, born in  Great Britain, in Scandinavia, or in some other foreign land, and you  came to America desiring to become a citizen of the United States. When  told that you must take out citizenship papers, forswear allegiance to  every foreign power, and honor and uphold the Constitution and laws of  this Republic, suppose you were to reply: `Why, what is the need of all  that? I am a good man, I have always done right, and am clean, moral,  and upright in conduct and conversation--why is that not sufficient to  entitle me to vote, to hold office, pre-empt land, and enjoy all the  rights and privileges of an American freeman?' Do you think such a plea  would avail? No, you do not. You see its inconsistency as quickly as  would the government unto whom it might be made. You would not expect  to become a citizen of the United States upon your own terms. Why,  then, should you hope for admittance into God's kingdom upon any other  conditions than those which the King himself has laid down?\"    Man's Proper Attitude.--Truthfulness, honesty, virtue, and benevolence  are precious possessions, inestimable treasures. They enrich the soul  under all conditions, outside or inside the kingdom of God; but they  are not valuable enough to purchase a passport into"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5061"],[0,"The Children's Book of Christmas Stories (#5)"],[1,"ise. He was a  very pretty young fellow, and he brought cherries to sell in graceful  little straw baskets lined with moss. So she stood in the kitchen door  one morning and told him all about the great trouble that had come upon  the city. He listened in great astonishment; he had never heard of it  before. He lived several miles out in the country.    \"How did the Costumer look?\" he asked respectfully; he thought Violetta  the most beautiful lady on earth.    Then Violetta described the Costumer, and told him of the unavailing  attempts that had been made to find him. There were a great many  detectives out, constantly at work.    \"I know where he is!\" said the Cherry-man. \"He's up in one of my  cherry-trees. He's been living there ever since cherries were ripe, and  he won't come down.\"    Then Violetta ran and told her father in great excitement, and he at  once called a meeting of the Aldermen, and in a few hours half the city  was on the road to the Cherry-man's.    He had a beautiful orchard of cherry-trees all laden with fruit. And,  sure enough in one of the largest, way up amongst the topmost branches,  sat the Costumer in his red velvet and short clothes and his diamond  knee-buckles. He looked down between the green boughs. \"Good-morning,  friends!\" he shouted.    The Aldermen shook their gold-headed canes at him, and the people danced  round the tree in a rage. Then they began to climb. But they soon found  that to be impossible. As fast as they touched a hand or foot to a tree,  back it flew with a jerk exactly as if the tree pushed it. They tried a  ladder, but the ladder fell back the moment it touched the tree, and lay  sprawling upon the ground. Finally, they brought axes and thought they  could chop the tree down, Costumer and all; but the wood resisted the  axes as if it were iron, and only dented them, receiving no impression  itself.    Meanwhile, the Costumer sat up in the tree, eating cherries and throwing  the stones down. Finally he stood up on a stout branch, and, looking  down, addressed the people.    \"It's of no use, your trying to accomplish anything in this way,\" said  he; \"you'd better parley. I'm willing to come to terms with you, and  make everything right on two conditions.\"    The people grew quiet then, and the Mayor stepped forward as spokesman,  \"Name your two conditions,\" said he rather testily. \"You own, tacitly,  that you are the cause of all this trouble.\"    \"Well\" said the Costumer, reaching out for a handful of cherries, \"this  Christmas Masquerade of yours was a beautiful idea; but you wouldn't do  it every year, and your successors might not do it at all. I want those  poor children to have a Christmas every year. My first condition is that  every poor child in the city hangs its stocking for gifts in the  City Hall on every Christmas Eve, and gets it filled, too. I want the  resolution filed and put away in the city archives.\"    \"We agree to the first condition!\" cried the people with one voice,  without waiting for the Mayor and Aldermen.    \"The second condition,\" said the Costumer, \"is that this good young  Cherry-man here has the Mayor's daughter, Violetta, for his wife. He has  been kind to me, letting me live in his cherry-tree and eat his cherries  and I want to reward him.\"    \"We consent,\" cried all the people; but the Mayor, though he was so  generous, was a proud man. \"I will not consent to the second condition,\"  he cried angrily.    \"Very well,\" replied the Costumer, picking some more cherries, \"then  your youngest daughter tends geese the rest of her life, that's all.\"    The Mayor was in great distress; but the thought of his youngest  daughter being a goose-girl all her life was too much for him. He gave  in at last.    \"Now go home and take the costumes off your children,\" said the  Costumer, \"and leave me in peace to eat cherries.\"    Then the people hastened back to the city, and found, to their great  delight, that the costumes would come off. The pins stayed out, the  buttons stayed unbuttoned, and the strings stayed untied. The children  were dressed in their own proper clothes and were their own proper  selves once more. The shepherdesses and the chimney-sweeps came  home, and were washed and dressed in silks and velvets, and went to  embroidering and playing lawn-tennis. And the princesses and the  fairies put on their own suitable dresses, and went about their useful  employments. There was great rejoicing in every home. Violetta thought  she had never been so happy, now that her dear little sister was no  longer a goose-girl, but her own dainty little lady-self.    The resolution to provide every poor child in the city with a stocking  full of gifts on Christmas was solemnly filed, and deposited in the city  archives, and was never broken.    Violetta was married to the Cherry-man, and all the children came to the  wedding, and strewed flowers in her path till her feet were quite hidden  in them. The Costumer had mysteriously disappeared from the cherry-tree  the night before, but he left at the foot some beautiful wedding  presents for the bride--a silver service with a pattern of cherries  engraved on it, and a set of china with cherries on it, in hand  painting, and a white satin robe, embroidered with cherries down the  front.          IV. THE SHEPHERDS AND THE ANGELS    ADAPTED FROM THE BIBLE    And there were shepherds in the same country abiding in the field, and  keeping watch by night over their flock. And an angel of the Lord stood  by them and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were  sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, Be not afraid; for, behold,  I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all the people:  for there is born to you this day in the city of David a Saviour, which  is Christ the Lord. And this is the sign unto you; ye shall find a babe  wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger. And suddenly there  was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and  saying:         Glory to God in the highest,       And on earth peace,       Good will toward men.    And it came to pass, when the angels went away from them into heaven,  the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem,  and see this thing that is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known  unto us. And they came with haste, and found Mary and Joseph and  the babe lying in the manger. And when they saw it, they made known  concerning the saying which was spoken to them about this child. And all  that heard it wondered at the things which were spoken unto them by the  shepherds. But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart.  And the shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the  things that they had heard and seen, even as it was spoken unto them.    And when eight days were fulfilled his name was called                   JESUS          V. THE TELLTALE TILE*    * From \"Kristy's Queer Christmas,\" Houghton, Mifflin & Co., 1904.    OLIVE THORNE MILLER    It begins with a bit of gossip of a neighbour who had come in to see  Miss Bennett, and was telling her about a family who had lately moved  into the place and were in serious trouble. \"And they do say she'll have  to go to the poorhouse,\" she ended.    \"To the poorhouse! how dreadful! And the children, too?\" and Miss  Bennett shuddered.    \"Yes; unless somebody'll adopt them, and that's not very likely. Well, I  must go,\" the visitor went on, rising. \"I wish I could do something for  her, but, with my houseful of children, I've got use for every penny I  can rake and scrape.\"    \"I'm sure I have, with only myself,\" said Miss Bennett, as she closed  the door. \"I'm sure I have,\" she repeated to herself as she resumed her  knitting; \"it's as much as I can do to make ends meet, scrimping as I  do, not to speak of laying up a cent for sickness and old age.\"    \"But the poorhouse!\" she said again. \"I wish I could help her!\" and the  needles flew in and out, in and out, faster than ever, as she turned  this over in her mind. \"I might give up something,\" she said at last,  \"though I don't know what, unless--unless,\" she said slowly, thinking  of her one luxury, \"unless I give up my tea, and it don't seem as if I  COULD do that.\"    Some time the thought worked in her mind, and finally she resolved to  make the sacrifice of her only indulgence for six months, and send the  money to her suffering neighbour, Mrs. Stanley, though she had never  seen her, and she had only heard she was in want.    How much of a sacrifice that was you can hardly guess, you, Kristy, who  have so many luxuries.    That evening Mrs. Stanley was surprised by a small gift of money \"from a  friend,\" as was said on the envelope containing it.    \"Who sent it?\" she asked, from the bed where she was lying.    \"Miss Bennett told me not to tell,\" said the boy, unconscious that he  had already told.    The next day Miss Bennett sat at the window knitting, as usual--for  her constant contribution to the poor fund of the church was a certain  number of stockings and mittens--when she saw a young girl coming up to  the door of the cottage.    \"Who can that be?\" she said to herself. \"I never saw her before. Come  in!\" she called; in answer to a knock. The girl entered, and walked up  to Miss Bennett.    \"Are you Miss Bennett?\" she asked.    \"Yes,\" said Miss Bennett with an amused smile.    \"Well, I'm Hetty Stanley.\"    Miss Bennett started, and her colour grew a little brighter.    \"I'm glad to see you, Hetty.\" she said, \"won't you sit down?\"    \"Yes, if you please,\" said Hetty, taking a chair near her.    \"I came to tell you how much we love you for--\"    \"Oh, don't! don't say any more!\" interrupted Miss Bennett; \"never mind  that! Tell me about your mother and your baby brother.\"    This was an interesting subject, and they talked earnestly about it.  The time passed so quickly that, before she knew it, she had been in the  house an hour."]]]
