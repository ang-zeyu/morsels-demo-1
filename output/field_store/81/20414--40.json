Now about this time, cats were brought into the country and the children  made such pets of them that some of the cows seemed to be jealous of the  attentions paid to Pussy and the kittens. These were the days when cows  and people all lived under one long roof. The children learned to tell  the time of day, whether it was morning, noon or night by looking into  the cats' eyes. These seemed to open and shut, very much as if they had  doors.    The fat pussy, which was brought into the house where Honig-je' was,  seemed to be very fond of the little girl, and the two, the cat and the  child, played much together. It was often said that the cat loved the  baby even more than her own kittens. Every one called the affectionate  animal by the nickname of Dub-belt-je', which means Little Double;  because this puss was twice as loving as most cat mothers are. When her  own furry little babies were very young, she carried them from one place  to another in her mouth. But this way, of holding kittens, she never  tried on the baby. She seemed to know better. Indeed, Dub-belt-je' often  wondered why human babies were born so naked and helpless; for at an age  when her kittens could feed themselves and run about and play with their  tails and with each other, Honig-je' was not yet able to crawl.    But other dangers were in store for the little girl. One day, when the  men were out hunting, and the women went to the woods to gather nuts and  acorns, a great flood came. The waters washed away the houses, so that  everything floated into the great river, and then down towards the sea.    What had, what would, become of our baby? So thought the parents of  Honig-je', when they came back to find the houses swept away and no sign  of their little daughter. Dub-belt-je' and her kittens, and all the  cows, were gone too.    Now it had happened that when the flood came and the house crashed down,  baby was sound asleep. The cat, leaving its kittens, that were now  pretty well grown up, leaped up and on to the top of the cradle and the  two floated off together. Pretty soon they found themselves left alone,  with nothing in sight that was familiar, except one funny thing. That  was a wooden shoe, in which was a fuzzy little yellow chicken hardly  four days old. It had been playing in the shoe, when the floods came  and swept it off from under the very beak of the old hen, that, with all  her other chicks, was speedily drowned.    On and on, the raging flood bore baby and puss, until dark night came  down. For hours more they drifted until, happily, the cradle was swept  into an eddy in front of a village. There it spun round and round, and  might soon have been borne into the greater flood, which seemed to roar  louder as the waters rose.    Now a cat can see sometimes in the night, better even than in the day,  for the darker it becomes, the wider open the eyes of puss. In bright  sunshine, at noon, the inside doors of the cat's eyes close to a narrow  slit, while at night these doors open wide. That is the reason why, in  the days before clocks and watches were made, the children could tell  about the time of day by looking at the cat's eyes. Sometimes they named  their pussy Klok'-oog, which means Clock Eye, or Bell Eye, for bell  clocks are older than clocks with a dial, and because in Holland the  bells ring out the hours and quarter hours.    Puss looked up and saw the church tower looming up in the dark. At once  she began to meouw and caterwaul with all her might. She hoped that some  one in one of the houses near the river bank might catch the sound. But  none seemed to hear or heed. At last, when Puss was nearly dead with  howling, a light appeared at one of the windows. This showed that some  one was up and moving. It was a boy, who was named Dirck, after the  saint Theodoric, who had first, long ago, built a church in the village.  Then Puss opened her mouth and lungs again and set up a regular  cat-scream. This wakened all her other relatives in the village and  every Tom and Kitty made answer, until there was a cat concert of meouws  and caterwauls.    The boy heard, rushed down-stairs, and, opening the door, listened. The  wind blew out his candle, but the brave lad was guided by the sound  which Pussy made. Reaching the bank, he threw off his wooden klomps,  plunged into the boiling waters, and, seizing the cradle, towed it  ashore. Then he woke up his mother and showed her his prize. The way  that baby laughed and crowed, and patted the horn of milk, and kicked up  its toes in delight over the warm milk, which was brought, was a joy to  see. Near the hearth, in the middle of the floor, Dub-belt-je', the  puss, was given some straw for a bed and, after purring joyfully, was  soon, like the baby, sound asleep.    Thus the cat warned the boy, and the boy saved the baby, that was very  welcome in a family where there were no girls, but only a boy. When  Honig-je' grew up to be a young woman, she looked as lovely as a  princess and in the church was married to Dirck! It was the month of  April and all the world was waking to flowers, when the wedding  procession came out of the church and the air was sweet with the opening  of the buds.    Before the next New Year's day arrived, there lay in the same cradle,  and put to sleep over the same rockers, a baby boy. When they brought  him to the font, the good grandmother named him Luid-i-ger. He grew up  to be the great missionary, whose name in Friesland is, even today,  after a thousand years, a household word. He it was who drove out bad  fairies, vile enchanters, wicked spirits and terrible diseases. Best of  all, he banished \"eye-bite,\" which was the name the people gave to  witchcraft. Luid-i-ger, also, made it hard for the naughty elves and  sprites that delude men.    After this, it was easy for all the good spirits, that live in kind  hearts and noble lives, to multiply and prosper. The wolves were driven  away or killed off and became very few, while the cattle and sheep  multiplied, until everybody could have a woollen coat, and there was a  cow to every person in the land.    But the people still suffered from the floods, that from time to time  drowned the cattle and human beings, and the ebb tides, that carried  everything out to sea. Then the good missionary taught the men how to  build dykes, that kept out the ocean and made the water of the rivers  stay between the banks. The floods became fewer and fewer and at last  rarely happened. Then Santa Klaas arrived, to keep alive in the hearts  of the people the spirit of love and kindness and good cheer forever.    At last, when nearly a hundred years had passed away, Honig-je', once  the girl baby, and then the dear old lady, who was kind to everybody and  prepared the way for Santa Klaas, died. Then, also, Dub-belt-je' the  cat, that had nine lives in one, died with her. They buried the old lady  under the church floor and stuffed the pussy that everybody, kittens,  boys, girls and people loved. By and by, when the cat's tail and fur  fell to pieces, and ears tumbled off, and its glass eyes dropped out, a  skilful artist chiselled a statue of Dub-belt-je', which still stands  over the tomb in the church. Every year, on Santa Klaas day, December  sixth, the children put a new collar around its neck and talk about the  cat that saved a baby's life.          PRINCE SPIN HEAD AND MISS SNOW WHITE      Long, long ago, before the Romans came into the land and when the  fairies ruled in the forest, there was a maiden who lived under an oak  tree. When she was a baby they called her Bundlekin. She had four  brothers, who loved their younger sister very dearly and did everything  they could to make her happy. Her fat father was a famous hunter. When  he roamed the woods, no bear, wolf, aurochs, roebuck, deer, or big  animal of any kind, could escape from his arrows, his spear, or his  pit-trap. He taught his sons to be skilful in the chase, but also to be  kind to the dumb creatures when captured. Especially when the mother  beast was killed, the boys were always told to care for the cubs, whelps  and kittens. As for the smaller animals, foxes, hares, weasels, rabbits  and ermine, these were so numerous, that the father left the business of  hunting them to the lads, who had great sport.    The house under the oak tree was always well provided with meat and  furs. The four brothers brought the little animals, which they took in  the woods, to make presents to their sister. So there was always a  plenty of pets, bear and wolf cubs, wildcats' kittens and baby aurochs  for the girl to play with. Every day, while the animals were so young as  to be fed on milk, she enjoyed frolicking with the four-footed babies.  When they grew bigger, she romped and sported with them, as if she and  they were equal members of the same family. The older brother watched  carefully, so that the little brutes, as they increased in size, should  not bite or claw his sister, for he knew the fierce nature that was in  wild creatures. Yet the maiden had wonderful power over these beasts of  the forest, whether little or big. She was not very much afraid of them  and often made them run, by looking at them hard in the eye.    While the girl made a pet of the animals, her parents made a pet of her.  The mother prepared the skins of the wolves and bears, until these were  very soft, keeping the fur on, to make rugs for the floor, and winter  coats for her children. The hides of the aurochs sufficed for rougher  use, but from what had once been the clothes of the fawn, the weasel,  the rabbit, and the ermine, garments were made that were smooth enough  to suit a baby's tender flesh. The forest folk wrapped their infants in  swaddling hands made of these dressed pelts. After feeding the darling,  a mother hung her baby up, warmly covered, to a tree branch. The cradle,  which was a furry bag, was made of the same"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7882"],[0,"The Life of Kit Carson: Hunter, Trapper, Guide, Indian Agent and Colonel U.S.A. (#5)"],[1," our friends plainly  saw their stolen animals tied near one of the forts. The sight of their  property was anything but soothing to the wrathful trappers, who were  resolved not to go back to their own camp without taking the horses  along.    But the Crows were strong in numbers, well armed and ready to fight on  the briefest notice. It would have been an act of the greatest rashness  to charge upon their camp, while they were excited to an unusual degree  by the rejoicing in which all took a hilarious part. The whites decided  to wait several hours longer until most of their enemies would be  unconscious in slumber.    All this time the weather was growing colder, and, toughened as the  trappers had become by years of exposure, they suffered greatly. They  dare not move about to keep up the circulation of their blood, for the  slightest noise was liable to attract the suspicion of some of the Crows  who might be prowling through the grove. More than once Carson feared  his limbs were freezing, but he held out like the genuine hero he was,  and his companions were all worthy of him.    At last the dance was over and the tired warriors wrapped their blankets  around their forms and stretched out to rest. Their manner showed they  had no thought that a foe was anywhere in the neighborhood. Although  such men sleep lightly, they do not remain long awake when courting  sleep, and in a brief while all were unconscious except the sentinels  on duty. Even they were so confident that nothing threatened, that they  became less vigilant than usual.    \"Sh! now is the time,\" whispered the youthful leader. They had decided  long before upon their plan of action, so that no time was now lost in  consultation. Kit and five of his men began slowly creeping toward their  horses. This was anything but a pleasant occupation, for the snow, it  will be remembered, was deep on the ground; but such veterans cared  nothing for a trifle like that, and they speedily reached their animals.    Such an attempt is always a dangerous one, for the horse of the Indian  or white hunter often proves his most skilful sentinel. He is able to  detect the stealthy approach of a scout, long before the straining ear  of his master can catch the slightest sound. If the beasts should become  frightened by the shadowy figures crawling over the snow, they would be  likely to alarm the camp; but Carson and his companions managed it so  well that there was not a single neigh or stamp of a hoof.    Silently rising to their feet, they cut the halters which held the  horses fast, and then, withdrawing a slight distance, began throwing  snowballs at them. These feathery missiles fell among and struck against  them, until, to escape the mimic bombardment they moved out the wood  altogether, where they were taken charge by the others who were waiting.  All this was accomplished without attracting the attention of a single  Indian.    Having met with such success, common prudence and sense suggested that  the trappers should make all haste to their own comfortable quarters, so  many long miles away; but they had scarcely joined each other when they  fell into an earnest discussion as to what the next step should be.    Some were in favor of withdrawing with the least possible delay, but  Kit Carson and a couple of daring spirits were bent on going back and  punishing the thieves who had given them so much trouble. As they could  not be argued out of their purpose, the others, as a matter of course,  agreed to give them their aid.    Three of the trappers were sent to take the recaptured animals to where  the saddle horses were secured while the others advanced directly upon  the Indian camp. They moved cautiously as was their custom and were  almost upon the Crows, when one of their dogs gave notice of danger by a  vigorous barking. On the instant, the warriors leaped to their feet  and the fight opened. So many of the Indians were shot down and the  advantage was so strongly against them, that the survivors hastily  ran into the nearest fort, from which they returned the fire of their  assailants. The latter, however, had stationed themselves behind trees,  where they were safe against the whistling bullets, and in their attack  they threw away very few shots indeed.    It began growing light in the east, and, as soon as the Crows  discovered how few composed the besieging force, they in turn became  the assailants, and rushed out of their fort with their frightful war  whoops, but they were met by such a destructive fire that they scurried  back again.    The second attack of the savages was so furious that the trappers were  forced to fall back, but the reserve, as it may be called, speedily  joined them, and once more drove the Indians into their fort. Several  of the whites had been wounded though not dangerously, and both parties  having had enough of fighting, the battle ended.        CHAPTER VI.       The British and American Trapper--Hunting on the Laramie--The   Deserters--The Vain Pursuit--Arrival of Friends--The Return Journey--The   Night Alarm--The Attack Upon the Camp--Pursuit and Recovery of Horses.    A half century ago the vast region beyond the Rocky Mountains was  comparatively unknown and unexplored. Its general features of course  were understood, but the interior was like the central portion of  Australia or Africa. Clarke and Lewis made their famous expedition to  Oregon during the early days of the century, and helped to turn general  attention in that direction. Its growth and development since then is  one of the wonders of the age.    But there was one class (if the word may be used), who never hesitated  to penetrate the wildest and most dangerous recesses of the far West  and Northwest: those were the hunters and trappers. As we have already  stated, the employees of the venerable and all embracing Hudson Bay  Company ranged over British America and through Oregon, to which vast  territory they possessed the clear legal right, besides which they and  the trappers of the American Fur Company frequently trespassed on each  others reserves, and not infrequently came in bloody collision with each  other.    Far to the northward, the Indian drove his birch canoe across the silent  Athabasca and Great Bear Lakes, on his way with his peltries to the  distant factory or post of the Company; along the frozen shores of the  lone Mackenzie (the only American river flowing into the Arctic Ocean),  the trapper glided on his snow shoes, or with his sturdy dogs and  sleigh, fought his way over the snowy wastes of Prince Rupert's Land;  the brigades in their boats rounded the curves of the Saskatchewan,  keeping time with their paddles to their own cheery songs; their camp  fires were kindled in the land of the Assiniboine and they set their  traps in the wildest recesses of the Rocky Mountains where the whirling  snow storms almost carried them off their feet; but north of the  dividing line, the hunters had little if anything to fear from the red  men. Though they encountered in the loneliest and most desolate distant  regions, they generally met and separated as friends. Among the perils  of the trapper's life in British America was not reckoned that from the  hostile natives.    It was far different within our own territory. Those who left our  frontier States and pushed westward, and those who penetrated northward  and eastward from the Mexican country, knew they were invading the  hunting grounds of the fiercest Indians on the American continent. We  have already told enough to show the intense hostility of the red men;  between them and the hunters and trappers raged a war that never ceased  or slackened, except when policy held it for a time in check.    The little group of horsemen, who rode out from Independence or  Westport, or who took steamer at St. Louis up the Missouri, often came  back with several of their number missing. Up among the mountains, they  had gone out to visit their traps and had never come back to camp. The  lurking Blackfoot, or Sioux, or Crow, had aimed all too well, and, as  he bounded whooping away, he swung aloft the scalp of his victim whose  trapping days were ended forever.    After recovering their horses from the band of Crows, Carson and his  companions returned to camp, where they remained until spring, when they  cached their furs and made their way to the Laramie River on another  hunting expedition. While thus employed, a couple of the men deserted  taking several of the best animals. Kit Carson and a single companion  were sent in pursuit, the rascals having a good day's start. A desperate  fight was sure to follow a meeting between the parties, for Carson would  never forgive such treachery, and the deserters were not the ones to  permit themselves to be despoiled of their booty without doing their  utmost to prevent it.    It was suspected that they were on their way to the place where the  beaver had been cached; and disregarding the trail, therefore Carson  made all haste thither. It need not be said that he lost no time on the  road, but when he reached their old camp, he found the deserters had  preceded him. They had stolen several thousand dollars worth of furs and  departed.    Carson was more anxious than ever to overtake the scoundrels. He and his  companion made diligent search, but failed utterly to find them. They  were never seen or heard of again, and Carson was convinced they had  fallen victims to the Indians who in turn made off with the stolen  peltries.    It will be borne in mind that Kit and his friend were several hundred  miles from the main body of hunters, and in one of the most dangerous  countries they had ever visited. So dangerous, indeed, did they consider  an attempt to return to them, that they decided not to make it, but to  stay in the old camp. Inasmuch as it would be impossible to keep their  presence from the knowledge of the Indians, they threw up some rude"]]]
