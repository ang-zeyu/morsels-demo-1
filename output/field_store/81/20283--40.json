In a few minutes he was  as far ahead of Billy Mink as Billy was ahead of Spotty the Turtle.     For wings are swifter far than legs,    On whatsoever purpose bent,  But doubly swift and tireless  Those wings on kindly deed intent.    And this is how it happened that Ol' Mistah Buzzard was the first to  find out what it was that had stopped the laughing of the Laughing Brook  and the smiling of the Smiling Pool, but he was so surprised when he did  find out, that he forgot all about going back to tell Spotty the Turtle.  He forgot everything but his own great surprise, and he blinked his eyes  a great many times to make sure that he wasn't dreaming. Then he sailed  around and around in circles, looking down among the trees of the Green  Forest and saying over and over to himself:    \"Did yo' ever? No, Ah never! Did yo' ever? No, Ah never!\"        CHAPTER XIV: Spotty The Turtle Keeps Right On Going     \"One step, two steps, three steps, so!    Four steps, five steps, six steps go!    Keep right on and do your best;    Mayhap you'll win while others rest.\"    Spotty the Turtle said this over to himself every time he felt a little  down-hearted, as he plodded along the bed of the Laughing Brook. And  every time he said it, he felt better. \"One step, two steps,\" he kept  saying over and over, and each time he said it, he took a step and  then another. They were very short steps, very short steps indeed, for  Spotty's legs are very short. But each one carried him forward just  so much, and he knew that he was just so much nearer the thing he was  seeking. Anyway, he hoped he was.    You see, if the Laughing Brook would never laugh any more, and the  Smiling Pool would never smile any more, there was nothing to do but  to go down to the Big River to live, and no one wanted to do that,  especially Grandfather Frog and Spotty the Turtle.    Now, because Billy Mink could go faster than Little Joe Otter, and  Little Joe Otter could go faster than Jerry Muskrat, and Jerry could go  faster than Grandfather Frog, and Grandfather Frog could go faster than  Spotty the Turtle, and because each one wanted to be the first to find  the trouble, no one would wait for the one behind him. So Spotty the  Turtle, who has to carry his house with him, was a long, long way behind  the others. But he kept right on going.     \"One step, two steps, three steps, so!\"    and he didn't stop for anything. He crawled over sticks and around big  stones and sometimes, when he found a little pool of water, he swam. He  always felt better then, because he can swim faster than he can walk.    After a long, long time, Spotty the Turtle came to a little pool where  the sunshine lay warm and inviting. There, in the middle of it, on a  mossy stone, sat Grandfather Frog fast asleep. He had thought that he  was so far ahead of Spotty that he could safely rest his tired legs.  Spotty wanted to climb right up beside him and take a nap too, but he  didn't. He just grinned and kept right on going.     \"One step, two steps, three steps, so!\"    while Grandfather Frog slept on.    By and by, after a long, long time Spotty came to another little pool,  and who should he see but Jerry Muskrat busily opening and eating some  freshwater clams which he had found there. He was so busy enjoying  himself that he didn't see Spotty, and Spotty didn't say a word, but  kept right on going, although the sight of Jerry's feast had made him  dreadfully hungry.    By and by, after a long, long time, he came to a third little pool with  a high, smooth bank, and who should he see there but Little Joe Otter,  who had made a slippery slide down the smooth bank and was having a  glorious time sliding down into the little pool. Spotty would have liked  to take just one slide, but he didn't. He didn't even let Little Joe  Otter see him, but kept right on going.     \"One step, two steps, three steps, so!\"    By and by, after a long, long time, he came to a hollow log, and just  happening to peep in, he saw some one curled up fast asleep. Who was it?  Why, Billy Mink, to be sure! You see, Billy thought that he was so far  ahead that he might just as well take it easy, and that was what he was  doing. Spotty the Turtle didn't waken him. He just kept right on going  the same slow way he had come all day, and so, just as jolly, round,  red Mr. Sun was going to bed behind the Purple Hills, Spotty the Turtle  found the cause of the trouble in the Laughing Brook and the Smiling  Pool.        CHAPTER XV: What Spotty The Turtle Found    Spotty the Turtle stared and stared and stared, until it seemed as if  his eyes surely would pop out of his funny little head. Of course he  could believe his own eyes, and yet--and yet--well, if anybody else had  seen what he was looking at and had told him about it, he wouldn't have  believed it. No, Sir, he wouldn't have believed it. You see, he couldn't  have believed it because--why, because it didn't seem as if it could be  really and truly so.    He wondered if the sun shining in his eyes made him think he saw more  than he really did see, so he carefully changed his position. It made no  difference. Then Spotty was sure that what he saw was real, and that he  had found the cause of the trouble in the Laughing Brook, which had made  it stop laughing and the Smiling Pool stop smiling.    Spotty the Turtle was feeling pretty good. In fact, Spotty was feeling  very good indeed, because he had been the first to find out what was  the matter with the Laughing Brook. At least, he thought that he was the  first, and he was of all the little people who live in the Smiling Pool.  Only Ol' Mistah Buzzard had been before him, and he didn't count because  his wings are broad, and all he had to do was to sail over the Green  Forest and look down. The ones who really counted were Billy Mink and  Little Joe Otter and Jerry Muskrat and Grandfather Frog. Billy Mink had  stopped for a nap. Little Joe Otter had stopped to play. Jerry Muskrat  had stopped to eat. Grandfather Frog had stopped for a sun-nap. But  Spotty the Turtle had kept right on going, and now here he was, the  first one to find the cause of the trouble in the Laughing Brook. Do you  wonder that he felt proud and very happy?     Keeping at it, that's the way   Spotty won the race that day.    But now Spotty was beginning to wish that some of the others would hurry  up. He wanted to know what they thought. He wanted to talk it all over.  It was such a surprising thing that he could make neither head nor tail  of it himself, and he wondered what the others would say. And now the  long black shadows were creeping through the Green Forest, and if they  didn't get there pretty soon, they would have to wait until the next  day.    So Spotty the Turtle found a good place to spend the night, and then he  sat down to watch and wait. Right before him was the thing which he had  found and which puzzled him so. What was it? Why, it was a wall. Yes,  Sir, that is just what it was--a wall of logs and sticks and mud, and  it was right across the Laughing Brook, where the banks were steep  and narrow. Of course the Laughing Brook could laugh no longer; there  couldn't enough water get through that wall of logs and sticks and mud  to make even the beginning of a laugh. Spotty wondered what lay behind  that wall, and who had built it, and what for, and a lot of other  things. And he was still wondering when he fell asleep.        CHAPTER XVI: The Pond In The Green Forest    SPOTTY THE TURTLE was awake by the time the first rays of the rising sun  began to creep through the Green Forest. He was far, far up the Laughing  Brook, very much farther than he had ever been before, and as he yawned  and stretched, he wondered if after all he hadn't dreamed about the wall  of logs and sticks and mud across the Laughing Brook. When he had rubbed  the last sleepy-wink out of his eyes, he looked again. There it was,  just as he had seen it the night before! Then Spotty knew that it was  real, and he began to wonder what was on the other side of it.    \"I cannot climb it, for my legs were never made for climbing,\" said  Spotty mournfully as he looked at his funny little black feet. \"Oh,  dear, I wish that I could climb like Happy Jack Squirrel!\" Just then a  thought popped into his head and chased away the little frown that had  crept into Spotty's face. \"Perhaps Happy Jack sometimes wishes that he  could swim as I can, so I guess we are even. I can't climb, but he can't  swim. How foolish it is to wish for things never meant for you!\"    And with that, all the discontent left Spotty the Turtle, and he  began to study how he could make the most of his short legs and his  perseverance, of which, as you already know, he had a great deal. He  looked this way, and he looked that way, and he saw that if he could  climb to the top of the bank on one side of the Laughing Brook, he would  be able to walk right out on the strange wall of logs and sticks and  mud, and then, of course, he could see just what was on the other side.    So Spotty the Turtle wasted no more time wishing that he could do  something it was never meant that he should do. Instead, he picked out  what looked like the easiest place to climb the bank and started up. My,  my, my, it was hard work! You see, he had to carry his house along with  him, for he has to carry that wherever he goes, and it would have been  hard enough to have climbed that bank without carrying anything. Every  time he had climbed up three steps he slipped back two steps, but he  kept at it, puffing and blowing, saying over and over to himself:     \"I can if I will, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5113"],[0,"The Confessions of a Beachcomber (#5)"],[1," terrestrial orchid (CYRTOSTYLIS RENIFORMIS) is delicately fragrant, but  the great showy PHAIUS GRANDIFOLIUS (the tropical foxglove) and the meek  GEODORUM PICTUM (Queensland's lily of the valley) are denied the gift.    The forest, the jungle, the grassy spots, the hot rocks (with hoya and  orchids), and even the sands, with the native sweet-pea, are fragrant. A  lowly creeping plant (VITEX TRIFOLIA), with small spikes of  lavender-coloured flowers, and grey-green silvery leaves, mingles with  the coarse grasses of the sandy flats, and usurping broad areas forms an  aromatic carpet from which every footstep expresses a homely pungency as  of marjoram and sage. The odour of the island may be specific, and  therefore to be prized, yet it gladdens also because it awakens happy and  all too fleeting reminiscences. English fields and hedges cannot be  forgotten when one of our trees diffuses the scent of meadow-sweet, and  one of the orchids that of hawthorn. \"Scent and silence\" is the phrase  which expresses the individuality of our island, and better \"scented  silence\" than all the noisy odours of the town.    However showy the flora of the island, the existence of kindly fruits  must be deplored. Immense quantities, alluring in colour and form, are  produced; but not a single variety of real excellence. The raspberries  (two kinds) have but little flavour; the native \"Cape gooseberry\"  (PHYSALIS MIMIS), which appears like magic when the jungle is felled and  burnt off, is regarded with hostility, though unworthily, even by the  blacks; the\" wild\" grapes are sour and fiery, and among the many figs  only two or three are pleasant, and but one good. \"Bedyewrie\" (XIMENIA  AMERICANA) has a sweetish flavour, with a speedy after-taste of bitter  almonds, and generally refreshing and thirst-allaying qualities; the  shiny blue quandong (ELAEOCARPUS GRANDIS), misleading and insipid; the  Herbert River cherry (ANTIDESMA DALLACHYANUM), agreeable certainly, but  not high class; the finger cherry \"Pool-boo-nong\" of the blacks  (RHODOMYRTUS MACROCARPA), possesses the flavour of the cherry guava, but  has a most evil reputation. Some assert that this fruit is subject to a  certain disease (a kind of vegetable smallpox), and that if eaten when so  affected is liable to induce paralysis of the optic nerves and cause  blindness and even death. Blacks, however, partake of the fruit  unrestrictedly and declare it good, on the authority of tradition as well  as by present appreciation. They do not pay the slightest respect to the  injurious repute current among some white folks. Perhaps some trick of  constitution or some singularity of the nervous system renders them immune  to the poison, as the orange pigment said to reside in their epidermis  protects them from the actinic rays of the sun. Does not Darwin assert  that while white sheep and pigs are upset by certain plants dark-coloured  individuals escape. At any rate blacks are not affected by the fruit,  though large consumers of it, and many whites also eat of it raw and  preserved, without fear and without untoward effects. Some of the Eugenias  produce passable fruits, and one of the palms (CARYOTA) bears huge  bunches of yellow dates, the attractiveness of which lies solely in  appearance.    Quite a long list of pretty fruits might be compiled, and yet not more  than half a dozen are edible, and only half that number nice. The  majority are bitter and acrid, some merely insipid, and of the various  nuts not one is satisfactory.    Why all this profuse vegetation and the anomaly of tempting fruits and  nuts cram-full of meat and yet no real food--that is, food for man? Is it  that man was an after-thought of Nature, or did Nature fulfil herself in  his splendid purpose and capacities? She supplies abundantly food  convenient for birds and other animals lower in the scale of life, but  man is left to master his fate. Even when uncivilised he is called upon  to exercise more or less wit before he may eat, and the higher his grade  the more stress upon his intelligence.    When one contemplates the unpromising origin of the apple of today, and  the rich assortment of fruits here higher in the scale of progression  than it, imagination delights to dwell upon the wonders which await the  skill of a horticultural genius. The crude beginnings of scores of  pomological novelties are flaunted on every side. The patient man has to  come.    EARLY HISTORY    To that grand old mariner, Captain Cook, belongs the honour of the  discovery of the island. The names that he bestowed--judicious and  expressive--are among the most precious historic possessions of Australia.  They remind us that Cook formed the official bond between Britain and  this great Southern land, and bear witness to the splendid feats of quiet  heroism that he performed, the privations that he and his ship's company  endured, and the patience and perseverance with which difficulties were  faced and overcome.    In his journal, on 8th June 1770, Cook writes--\"At noon we were by  observation in the lat. of 17 degrees 59 minutes and abreast of the N.  point of Rockingham Bay which bore from us N. 2 miles. This boundary of  the Bay is formed by a tolerable high island known in the chart by the  name of Dunk Isle; it lay so near the shore as not to be distinguished  from it unless you are well in with the land... At this time we were in  the long. of 213 degrees 57 minutes, Cape Sandwich bore S. by E. 1/2 E.  distant 19 miles, and the northernmost land in sight N. 1/2 W. Our depth  of water in the course of this one day's sail was not more than 16 nor  less than 17 fathoms.\"    In those history-making days the First Lord of the Admiralty was George  Montagu Dunk, First Earl of Sandwich, Second Baron and First Earl of  Halifax, and Captain Cook took several opportunities of preserving his  patron's name. Halifax Bay (immediately to the north of Cleveland Bay)  perpetuates the title; \"Mount\" Hinchinbrook (from his course Cook could  not see the channel and did not realise that he was bestowing a name upon  an island) commemorates the family seat of the Montagus; Cape Sandwich  (the north-east point of Hinchinbrook) the older title, and Dunk Isle the  family name of the distinguished friend of the great discoverer of lands.    From this remote and unheard of spot may, accordingly, be traced  association with a contemporary of Robert Walpole, of Pitt and Fox, of  Edmund Burke, of John Wilkes (of the NORTH BRITON), of the author of THE  LETTERS OF JUNIUS and of JOHN GILPIN, and many others of credit and  renown. The First Earl Sandwich of Hinchinbrook was the \"my lord\" of the  gossiping Pepys. Through him Dunk Island possesses another strand in the  bond with the immortals, and is ensured connection with remote posterity.  He gambled so passionately that he invented as a means of hasty  refreshment the immemorial \"sandwich,\" that the fascination of basset,  ombre or quadrille should not be dispelled by the intrusion of a meal.  He, too, was the owner of Montagu House, behind which \"every morning saw  steel glitter and blood flow,\" for the age was that of the duellist as  well as the gambler.    Rockingham Bay was so named in honour of the marquis of that title, the  wise Whig premier who held that while the British Parliament had an  undoubted right to tax the American colonies, the notorious Stamp Act was  unjust and impolitic, \"sterile of revenue, and fertile of discontent!\"    Cook and his day and generation passed, and then for many years history  is silent respecting Dunk Island. The original inhabitants remained in  undisturbed possession; nor do they seem to have had more than one  passing visitor until Lieutenant Jeffereys, of the armed transport  Kangaroo, on his passage from Sydney to Ceylon in 1815, communicated with  the natives on then unnamed Goold Island. Captain Philip P. King,  afterwards Rear-Admiral, who made in the cutter MERMAID a running survey  of these coasts between the year 1818 and 1822, and who was the first to  indicate that \"Mount\" Hinchinbrook was probably separated from the  mainland, arrived in Rockingham Bay on the 19th June 1818. He named and  landed on Goold Island, and sailing north on the 21st, anchored off  Timana, where he went ashore. \"Dunk Island,\" he writes, \"a little to the  northward, is larger and higher, and remarkable for its double-peaked  summit.\"    Those natives who are versed in the ancient history of the island, tell  of the time when all were amazed by the appearance of bags of flour,  boxes of tobacco, and cases of goods drifting ashore. None at the time  knew what flour was; only one boy had previously smoked, and the goods  were too mysterious to be tested. Many tried to eat flour direct from the  bag. The individual who had acquired the reputation of a smoker made  himself so sick that none other had the courage to imitate him, and the  tobacco and goods were thrown about playfully. In after years the  inhabitants were fond of relating how they had humbugged themselves.    The next ensuing official reference of particular interest is contained  in the narrative of the voyage of H.M.S. RATTLESNAKE, by John  Macgillivray, F.R.G.S., naturalist of the expedition. The date is 26th  May 1848, and an extract reads--\"During the forenoon the ship was moved  over to an anchorage under the lee (north-west side) of Dunk Island,  where we remained for ten days. The summit of a very small rocky island,  near the anchorage, named, by Captain Owen Stanley, Mound Islet  (Purtaboi), formed the first station. Dunk Island, eight or nine miles in  circumference, is well wooded; it has two conspicuous peaks, one of which  (the north-west one) is 857 feet in height. Our excursions were confined  to the vicinity of the watering-place and the bay in which it is  situated. The shores are rocky on one side and sandy on the other, where  a low point runs out to the westward. At their junction,"]]]
