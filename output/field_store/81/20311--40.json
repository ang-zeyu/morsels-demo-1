You have cursed, and called him a Cattle Thief,      though you robbed him first of bread--  Robbed him and robbed my people--look there, at      that shrunken face,  Starved with a hollow hunger, we owe to you and      your race.  What have you left to us of land, what have you      left of game,  What have you brought but evil, and curses since      you came?  How have you paid us for our game? how paid us      for our land?  By a _book_, to save our souls from the sins _you_      brought in your other hand.  Go back with your new religion, we never have      understood  Your robbing an Indian's _body_, and mocking his      _soul_ with food.  Go back with your new religion, and find--if find      you can--  The _honest_ man you have ever made from out a      _starving_ man.  You say your cattle are not ours, your meat is not      our meat;  When _you_ pay for the land you live in, _we'll_ pay      for the meat we eat.  Give back our land and our country, give back our      herds of game;  Give back the furs and the forests that were ours      before you came;  Give back the peace and the plenty. Then come      with your new belief,  And blame, if you dare, the hunger that _drove_ him to      be a thief.\"        A CRY FROM AN INDIAN WIFE      My forest brave, my Red-skin love, farewell;  We may not meet to-morrow; who can tell  What mighty ills befall our little band,  Or what you'll suffer from the white man's hand?  Here is your knife! I thought 'twas sheathed for aye.  No roaming bison calls for it to-day;  No hide of prairie cattle will it maim;  The plains are bare, it seeks a nobler game:  'Twill drink the life-blood of a soldier host.  Go; rise and strike, no matter what the cost.  Yet stay. Revolt not at the Union Jack,  Nor raise Thy hand against this stripling pack  Of white-faced warriors, marching West to quell  Our fallen tribe that rises to rebel.  They all are young and beautiful and good;  Curse to the war that drinks their harmless blood.  Curse to the fate that brought them from the East  To be our chiefs--to make our nation least  That breathes the air of this vast continent.  Still their new rule and council is well meant.  They but forget we Indians owned the land  From ocean unto ocean; that they stand  Upon a soil that centuries agone  Was our sole kingdom and our right alone.  They never think how they would feel to-day,  If some great nation came from far away,  Wresting their country from their hapless braves,  Giving what they gave us--but wars and graves.  Then go and strike for liberty and life,  And bring back honour to your Indian wife.  Your wife? Ah, what of that, who cares for me?  Who pities my poor love and agony?  What white-robed priest prays for your safety here,  As prayer is said for every volunteer  That swells the ranks that Canada sends out?  Who prays for vict'ry for the Indian scout?  Who prays for our poor nation lying low?  None--therefore take your tomahawk and go.  My heart may break and burn into its core,  But I am strong to bid you go to war.  Yet stay, my heart is not the only one  That grieves the loss of husband and of son;  Think of the mothers o'er the inland seas;  Think of the pale-faced maiden on her knees;  One pleads her God to guard some sweet-faced child  That marches on toward the North-West wild.  The other prays to shield her love from harm,  To strengthen his young, proud uplifted arm.  Ah, how her white face quivers thus to think,  _Your_ tomahawk his life's best blood will drink.  She never thinks of my wild aching breast,  Nor prays for your dark face and eagle crest  Endangered by a thousand rifle balls,  My heart the target if my warrior falls.  O! coward self I hesitate no more;  Go forth, and win the glories of the war.  Go forth, nor bend to greed of white men's hands,  By right, by birth we Indians own these lands,  Though starved, crushed, plundered, lies our nation low...  Perhaps the white man's God has willed it so.        DAWENDINE      There's a spirit on the river, there's a ghost upon the shore,  They are chanting, they are singing through the starlight evermore,  As they steal amid the silence,      And the shadows of the shore.    You can hear them when the Northern candles light the Northern sky,  Those pale, uncertain candle flames, that shiver, dart and die,  Those dead men's icy finger tips,      Athwart the Northern sky.    You can hear the ringing war-cry of a long-forgotten brave  Echo through the midnight forest, echo o'er the midnight wave,  And the Northern lanterns tremble      At the war-cry of that brave.    And you hear a voice responding, but in soft and tender song;  It is Dawendine's spirit singing, singing all night long;  And the whisper of the night wind      Bears afar her Spirit song.    And the wailing pine trees murmur with their voice attuned to hers,  Murmur when they 'rouse from slumber as the night wind through them stirs;  And you listen to their legend,      And their voices blend with hers.    There was feud and there was bloodshed near the river by the hill;  And Dawendine listened, while her very heart stood still:  Would her kinsman or her lover      Be the victim by the hill?    Who would be the great unconquered? who come boasting how he dealt  Death? and show his rival's scalplock fresh and bleeding at his belt.  Who would say, \"O Dawendine!      Look upon the death I dealt?\"    And she listens, listens, listens--till a war-cry rends the night,  Cry of her victorious lover, monarch he of all the height;  And his triumph wakes the horrors,      Kills the silence of the night.    Heart of her! it throbs so madly, then lies freezing in her breast,  For the icy hand of death has chilled the brother she loved best;  And her lover dealt the death-blow;      And her heart dies in her breast.    And she hears her mother saying, \"Take thy belt of wampum white;  Go unto yon evil savage while he glories on the height;  Sing and sue for peace between us:      At his feet lay wampum white.    \"Lest thy kinsmen all may perish, all thy brothers and thy sire  Fall before his mighty hatred as the forest falls to fire;  Take thy wampum pale and peaceful,      Save thy brothers, save thy sire.\"    And the girl arises softly, softly slips toward the shore;  Loves she well the murdered brother, loves his hated foeman more,  Loves, and longs to give the wampum;      And she meets him on the shore.    \"Peace,\" she sings, \"O mighty victor, Peace! I bring thee wampum white.  Sheathe thy knife whose blade has tasted my young kinsman's blood to-night  Ere it drink to slake its thirsting,      I have brought thee wampum white.\"    Answers he, \"O Dawendine! I will let thy kinsmen be,  I accept thy belt of wampum; but my hate demands for me  That they give their fairest treasure,      Ere I let thy kinsmen be.    \"Dawendine, for thy singing, for thy suing, war shall cease;  For thy name, which speaks of dawning, _Thou_ shalt be the dawn of peace;  For thine eyes whose purple shadows tell of dawn,      My hate shall cease.    \"Dawendine, Child of Dawning, hateful are thy kin to me;  Red my fingers with their heart blood, but my heart is red for thee:  Dawendine, Child of Dawning,      Wilt thou fail or follow me?\"    And her kinsmen still are waiting her returning from the night,  Waiting, waiting for her coming with her belt of wampum white;  But forgetting all, she follows,      Where he leads through day or night.    There's a spirit on the river, there's a ghost upon the shore,  And they sing of love and loving through the starlight evermore,  As they steal amid the silence,      And the shadows of the shore.        WOLVERINE      \"Yes, sir, it's quite a story, though you won't believe it's true,  But such things happened often when I lived beyond the Soo.\"  And the trapper tilted back his chair and filled his pipe anew.    \"I ain't thought of it neither fer this many 'n many a day,  Although it used to haunt me in the years that's slid away,  The years I spent a-trappin' for the good old Hudson's Bay.    \"Wild? You bet, 'twas wild then, an' few an' far between  The squatters' shacks, for whites was scarce as furs when things is green,  An' only reds an' 'Hudson's' men was all the folk I seen.    \"No. Them old Indyans ain't so bad, not if you treat 'em square.  Why, I lived in amongst 'em all the winters I was there,  An' I never lost a copper, an' I never lost a hair.    \"But I'd have lost my life the time that you've heard tell about;  I don't think I'd be settin' here, but dead beyond a doubt,  If that there Indyan 'Wolverine' jest hadn't helped me out.    \"'Twas freshet time, 'way back, as long as sixty-six or eight,  An' I was comin' to the Post that year a kind of late,  For beaver had been plentiful, and trappin' had been great.    \"One day I had been settin' traps along a bit of wood,  An' night was catchin' up to me jest faster 'an it should,  When all at once I heard a sound that curdled up my blood.    \"It was the howl of famished wolves--I didn't stop to think  But jest lit out across for home as quick as you could wink,  But when I reached the river's edge I brought up at the brink.    \"That mornin' I had crossed the stream straight on a sheet of ice  An' now, God help me!

I says, 'Thank Heaven.' There stood the chief I'd nicknamed Wolverine.    \"I leapt on that there horse, an' then jest like a coward fled,  An' left that Indyan standin' there alone, as good as dead,  With the wolves a-howlin' at his back, the swollen stream ahead.    \"I don't know how them"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5630"],[0,"The Story of \"Mormonism\" and The Philosophy of \"Mormonism\" (#5)"],[1," Beautiful--was  the name given to this new abiding place.  It was situated but a  few miles from Quincy, in a bend of the majestic river, giving  the town three water fronts.  It seemed to nestle there as if the  Father of Waters was encircling it with his mighty arm.  Soon a  glorious temple crowned the hill up which the city had run in its  rapid growth.  Their settlements extended into Iowa, then a  territory.  The governors of both Iowa and Ohio testified to the  worthiness of the Latter-day Saints as citizens, and pledged them  the protection of the commonwealth.  The city of Nauvoo was  chartered by the state of Illinois, and the rights of local  self-government were assured to its citizens.    A military organization, the \"Nauvoo Legion,\" was authorized, and  the establishment of a university was provided for; both these  organizations were successfully effected.  It was here that a  memorial was prepared and sent to the national government,  reciting the outrages of Missouri, and asking reparation.  Joseph  Smith himself, the head of the delegation, had a personal  interview with President Van Buren, in which the grievances of  the Latter-day Saints were presented.  Van Buren replied in words  that will not be forgotten, \"Your cause is just, but I can do  nothing for you.\"    The peaceful conditions at first characteristic of their Illinois  settlement were not to continue.  The element of political  influence asserted itself and the \"Mormons\" bade fair to soon  hold the balance of power in local affairs.  The characteristic  unity, so marked in connection with every phase of the people's  existence, promised too much; immigration into Hancock county was  continuous, and the growing power of the Latter-day Saints was  viewed with apprehension.  With this as the true motive, many  pretexts for annoyance were found; and arrests, trials, and  acquittals were common experiences of the Church officers.    A charge, which promised to prove as devoid of foundation as had  the excuses for the fifty arrests preceding it, led Joseph Smith,  president of the Church, and Hyrum Smith, the patriarch, to again  surrender themselves to the officers of the law.  They were taken  to Carthage, Joseph having declared to friends his belief that he  was going to the slaughter.  Governor Ford gave to the prisoners  his personal guarantee for their safety; but mob violence was  supreme, more mighty than the power of the state militia placed  there to guard the prison; and these men were shot to death, even  while under the governor's plighted pledge of protection.  Hyrum  fell first; and Joseph, appearing at one of the windows in the  second story, received the leaden missiles of the besieging mob,  which was led by a recreant though professed minister of the  gospel.  But the brutish passion of the mob was not yet sated;  propping the body against a well-curb in the jail-yard, the  murderers poured a volley of bullets into the corpse, and fled.  Thus was the unholy vow of the mob fulfilled, that as law could  not touch the \"Mormon\" leaders, powder and ball should.  John  Taylor, who became years afterward president of the Church, was  in the jail at the same time; he received four bullets, and was  left supposedly dead.    Joseph Smith had been more than the ecclesiastical leader; his  presence and personality had been ever powerful as a stimulus to  the hearts of the people; none knew his personal power better  than the members of his own flock, unless indeed it were the  wolves who were ever seeking to harry the fold.  It had been the  boast of anti-\"Mormons\" that with Joseph Smith removed, the  Church would crumble to pieces of itself.  In the personality of  their leader, it was thought, lay the secret of the people's  strength; and like the Philistines, the enemy struck at the  supposed bond of power.  Terrible as was the blow of the fearful  fatality, the Church soon emerged from its despairing state of  poignant grief, and rose mightier than before.  It is the faith  of this people that while the work of God on earth is carried on  by men, yet mortals are but instruments in the Creator's hands  for the accomplishment of divine purposes.  The death of the  president disorganized the First Presidency of the Church; but  the official body next in authority, the Council of the Twelve,  stepped to the front, and the progress of the Church was  unhindered.  The work of the ministry was not arrested; the  people paused but long enough to bury their dead and clear their  eyes from the blinding tears that fell.    Let us take a retrospective glance at this unusual man.  Though  his opponents deny him the divine commission with which his  friends believe he was charged, they all, friends and foes alike,  admit that he was a great man.  Through the testimony of his  life's work and the sanctifying seal of his martyrdom, thousands  have come to acknowledge him all that he professed to be--a  messenger from God to the people.  He is not without admirers  among men who deny the truth of his principles and the faith of  his people.    A historical writer of the time, Josiah Quincy, a few weeks after  the martyrdom, wrote:        It is by no means improbable that some future text book      for the use of generations yet unborn, will contain a      question something like this: \"What historical American      of the nineteenth century has exerted the most powerful      influence upon the destinies of his countrymen?\"  And it      is by no means impossible that the answer to that      interrogatory may be thus written--\"Joseph Smith, the      Mormon Prophet.\"  And the reply, absurd as it doubtless      seems to most men now living, may be an obvious      commonplace to their descendants.  History deals in      surprises and paradoxes quite as startling as this.  A      man who established a religion in this age of free      debate, who was and is today accepted by hundreds of      thousands as a direct emissary from the Most High--such      a rare human being is not to be disposed of by pelting      his memory with unsavory epithets.  * * *  The most      vital questions Americans are asking each other today,      have to deal with this man and what he has left us.      * * *  Joseph Smith, claiming to be an inspired teacher,      faced adversity such as few men have been called to      meet, enjoyed a brief season of prosperity such as few      men have ever attained, and finally * * * went      cheerfully to a martyr's death.  When he surrendered      his person to Governor Ford, in order to prevent the      shedding of blood, the Prophet had a presentiment of      what was before him.  \"I am going like a lamb to the      slaughter,\" he is reported to have said, \"but I am as      calm as a summer's morning.  I have a conscience void of      offense, and shall die innocent.\"    The \"Mormon\" people regarded it as a duty to make every proper  effort to bring the perpetrators of the foul assassination of  their leaders to justice; sixty names were presented to the local  grand jury, and of the persons so designated, nine were indicted.  After a farcical semblance of a trial, these were acquitted, and  thus was notice, sanctioned by the constituted authority of the  law, served upon all anti-\"Mormons\" of Illinois, that they were  safe in any assault they might choose to make on the subjects of  their hate.  The mob was composed of apt pupils in the learning  of this lesson.  Personal outrages were of every-day occurrence;  husbandmen were captured in their fields, beaten, tortured, until  they barely had strength left to promise compliance with the  demands of their assailants,--that they would leave the state.  Houses were fired while the tenants were wrapped in uneasy  slumber within; indeed, one entire town, that of Morley, was by  such incendiarism reduced to ashes.  Women and children were  aroused in the night, and compelled to flee unclad or perish in  their burning dwellings.    But what of the internal work of the Church during these trying  periods?  As the winds of winter, the storms of the year's  deepest night, do but harden and strengthen the mountain pine,  whose roots strike the deeper, whose branches thicken, whose  twigs multiply by the inclemency that would be fatal to the  exotic palm, raised by man with hot-house nursing, so the new  sect continued its growth, partly in spite of, partly because of,  the storms to which it was subjected.  It was no green-house  growth, struggling for existence in a foreign clime, but a fit  plant for the soil of a free land; and there existed in the minds  of unprejudiced observers not a doubt as to its vitality.  The  Church soon found its equilibrium again after the shock of its  cruel experience.  Brigham Young, who for a decade had been  identified with the cause, who had received his full share of  persecution at mobocratic hands, now stood at the head of the  presiding body in the priesthood of the Church.  The effect of  this man's wonderful personality, his surprising natural ability,  and to the people, the proofs of his divine acceptance, were  apparent from the first.    Migration from other states and from foreign shores continued to  swell the \"Mormon\" band, and this but angered the oppressors the  more.  The members of the Church, recognizing the inevitable long  before predicted by their murdered prophet, that the march of the  Church would be westward, redoubled their efforts to complete the  grand temple upon which they had not ceased to work through all  the storms of persecution.  This structure, solemnly dedicated to  their God, they entered, and there received their anointings and  their blessings; then they abandoned it to the desecration and  self-condemning outrages of their foes.  For the mob's decree had  gone forth, that the \"Mormons\" must leave Illinois.  After a few  sanguinary encounters, the leaders of the people acceded to the  demands of their"]]]
