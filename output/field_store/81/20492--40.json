Around a large table in the parlour sat a motley group.  There were ragged wits, well-dressed students, new-fledged actors, a  hackney writer or so, an Irish barrister named Shuter, a Scotch  reporter, and a hodge-podge of most discordant materials congregated  under the amalgamating power of Suett, who seemed, by the incongruity of  his dress and diversified manner, to have studied the various tastes of  those he swayed, and to be the comprehensive representative of each of  the strange beings he looked upon, with all of whom he would  occasionally identify himself with so much ease, that it were hard to  say whether it was the result of labour or of tact, of calculation, or  the mere impulse of mother-wit. The _ropes of his face_, when drawn  _taught_, peculiarly commanded the attention of the Caledonian, while  the sly and humorous glance of his half-shut eye was acknowledged by the  Hibernian to whom it was addressed; the _snow drift_ of powder which lay  in patches on his long, straight hair, agreed with the taste of his  dramatic nursling; the far-extended cambric of white frill imposed upon  the students, while the unseemly rents in his coat at once compensated  to the wits for what there might be of gaudy or gay in his outward man.  We were received with equal courtesy and ceremony by the president; and  were just seated, when a ballet-dancer of Drury-lane entered. As he was  a Frenchman, it became a question of _national_ politeness: and Dicky  _chestered_ him to his dexter! and, as was befitting, condescended to  address him. \"I am proud, sir,\" said Suett, with the formality of _Black  Rod_ himself, \"to do the honours of my _country_ to the _representative_  of a nation which held my _master_ Garrick in peculiar respect. He was a  great actor, sir; a wonderful man! Your Lekain, or any other _Cain_,  could not come up to him, for he was _Able_, Pardon the pun. Oh,  la!--but he was vain, sir; vain as a peacock; it could not be of his  person. Had he been, as Richard has it, _'a marvellous proper man'_ like  myself, one might have said something. He used to say, I was too _lean_  for _Suett_. Oh, dear. _A votre sante, Monsieur,_ happy to see you on  this side the Channel. Never been to France yet, although in the  _Straits_ great part of my life, and not unfrequently _half seas  over_.--Well, sir, to return to Garrick. There was that man 'frae the  north,' who wrote the History of England and Roderick Random,--the  latter a true story, they say;--he who challenged Campbell the  barrister, for calling him _names_, _To bias_ the cause. Well, sir, Davy  refused one of his farces; but the wily Caledonian _pocketed_ the  affront, in coolly observing, 'that he had nearly completed another  volume of his history, and hoped he might be permitted to name _the  British Roscius_, the pride of his country, and all that sort of thing.'  It was a palpable hit, sir--the thing was settled--the _manager  managed_; and _Smelfungus_ retired, _without_ his manuscript, half sorry  he had not added _another_ scene to his farce. Well, sir, the story got  wind, and some days after Davy dined with a lawyer who had interested  himself vainly for a friend's comedy with him, when, in the course of  conversation, the barrister observed to Davy, before a large company,  that he had nearly compiled another volume of The Statutes _at large_  (would they were all _at large_), and hoped he might be permitted to  name _the British Roscius, the pride of his country._ There was a roar  at the expense of Garrick. 'The galled jade' winced terribly:--he was  touchy as tinder, sir:--never was _Digest_ so ill-_digested_.'\"    It was when the meteor-like popularity of little Betty was at its height  that poor Suett fell ill, at what he termed his _town_ residence (a  second-floor in a low street), and the pigmy Roscius, having eaten too  much fruit, kept all London in intense agony for his fate at the same  moment. Bulletins were exhibited in Southampton-row several times  a-day, signed by numerous physicians. Had he died, how posterity would  have been befooled! Suett was then _actually_ dying, yet would he have  his joke, and his last moments were cheered by the horse-laugh of the  rabble assembled to _spell_ the bulletin suspended to \"the second-floor  bell,\" attested by the _mark_ of the old woman who attended him. \"You  shall be buried in Saint Paul's,\" said a friend. \"Oh, la!\" was the dying  ejaculation of the comedian.    _New Monthly Magazine._           *       *       *       *       *        THE SELECTOR; AND LITERARY NOTICES OF NEW WORKS.           *       *       *       *       *      AMERICAN TRAVELLING.      June 7th, at three in the morning, the steam-boat (which was of immense  size, and on the high pressure system) arrived at Albany, having come  one hundred and sixty miles in seventeen hours, including stoppages. I  found that, unluckily, the mail-coach had left the place just before our  arrival, so I booked myself in an accommodation-stage, which was to  reach Boston (a distance of one hundred and sixty miles) in three days,  and entered the wretched-looking vehicle, with a heavy heart, at eight  o'clock.... The machine in which I travelled was slow and crowded. The  proprietor had undertaken to let us rest at night on the road; but we  found that his notions of rest were very imperfect, and that his night  was one of the polar regions.--Having partaken of a wretched dinner at  Sand Lake, we arrived about one in the morning at Cheshire, where we  were to sleep.    By dint of most active exertion, I secured a bed to myself, the narrow  dimensions of which precluded the possibility of participation, and  plunged into it with all possible haste, as there was not a moment to  be lost. Secure in \"single blessedness,\" I was incredibly amused at the  compliments of nocturnal arrangement which passed around me among my  Yankee companions. They were nine in number, and occupied by triplets  the three other beds which the room contained. Whether it was with a  view of preserving their linen unrumpled, or of enjoying greater space,  I cannot tell; but certain it is, that they divested themselves of  clothing to a degree not generally practised in Europe. A spirit of  accommodation appeared to prevail; and it seemed to be a matter of  indifference whether to occupy the lateral portions of the bed, or the  warmer central position, except in one instance, where a gentleman  protested against being placed next to the wall, as he was in the habit  of chewing tobacco in his sleep!    At four o'clock in the morning we again set off, and, as much rain had  fell in the night, the roads were in a dreadful state. The coach company  now consisted of nine passengers inside, one on the top, (which, from  its convex form, is a very precarious situation,) and three on the box,  besides the coachman, who sat on the knees of the unfortunate middle  man,--an uneasy burden, considering the intense heat of the weather.    It matters little to the American driver where he sits; he is indeed, in  all respects, a far different personage from his great-coated prototype  in England. He is in general extremely dexterous in the art of driving,  though his costume is of a most grotesque description. Figure to  yourself a slipshod sloven, dressed in a striped calico jacket and an  old straw hat, alternately arranging the fragile harness of his horses,  and springing again upon his box with surprising agility; careless of  the bones of his passengers, and confident in his skill and resources,  he scruples not frequently to gallop his coach over corderoy roads, (so  called from being formed of the trunks of trees laid transversely,) or  dash it round corners, and through holes that would appal the heart of  the stoutest English coachman, however elated by gin, or irritated by  opposition. I was once whirled along one of these roads, when the  leathers, (barbarous substitutes for springs,) which supported the  carriage gave way with a sudden shock. The undaunted driver instantly  sprang from his box, tore a stake from a rail fence by the road-side,  laid it across under the body of the coach, and was off again before I  properly recovered the use of my senses, which were completely  bewildered by the jolting I had undergone. I can compare it to nothing  but the butt of Regulus, without the nails. When the lash and butt-end  of the whip fail him, he does not scruple to use his foot, as the  situation of his seat allows the application of it to his wheelers.    We dined at New Salem at six, and arrived at Petersham, where we were to  sleep, at twelve o'clock at night, having been twenty hours coming sixty  miles.    Though tired and disgusted with my journey, the prospect of a short  respite from this state of purgatory was embittered during the last few  miles by alarm at the idea of passing the night with one, if not two, of  my fellow-travellers; and I internally resolved rather to sleep upon the  floor.    After a desperate struggle, I succeeded, to my great joy, in securing a  bed for myself, not, however, without undergoing a severe objurgation  from the landlady, who could not understand such unaccommodating  selfishness. Short were our slumbers. By the rigid order of the  proprietor, we were turned out the next morning at three, and pursued  our journey.--_De Roos's Personal Narrative._      KANGAROO WAGGERY.      One of the largest tame kangaroos I have seen in the country is  domiciled here, and a mischievous wag he is, creeping and snuffing  cautiously toward a stranger, with such an innocently expressive  countenance, that roguery could never be surmised to exist under  it--when, having obtained as he thinks a sufficient introduction, he  claps his forepaws on your shoulders, (as if to caress you,) and raising  himself suddenly upon"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10027"],[0,"The Triple Alliance, Its Trials and Triumphs (#6)"],[1,"d!\" whispered Jack Vance, in an ecstasy of delight as the  Philistines trooped back through the double doors.  \"That was old  Phillips.  I hope he gives Noaks a jolly good 'impot.'  That chap is a  cad,\" continued the speaker, as they hurried back towards The Birches:  \"when he can't do anything else, he chucks stones like he did to-night.  The wonder is he hasn't killed some one before now.  I don't see how  it's possible for the Philistines to show up well when they've got a  chap like him bossing the show.\"    The bell for evening preparation was ringing as they reached The  Birches, and only a very few hasty replies could be given to Acton's  eager inquiries as they rushed together up the garden path.  In the  little interval before supper, however, the subject was resumed in a  quiet corner of the passage.    \"So it must have been old Noaks who told them,\" said Acton; \"that's  proved without a doubt.  I vote we go and have a jolly row with him  to-morrow morning.\"    \"No, I shouldn't do that,\" answered Diggory; \"don't let him know that  we've found him out.\"    \"Well, look here,\" answered Acton, thumping the wall with his fist and  frowning heavily, \"what are we going to do to get even with the  Philistines?  We can't go out and fight them in Locker's Lane; we're too  small, and they know it.  Young Noaks would never have dared to act as  he did after they'd knocked our snow man down if Mason had been here.  They think now they're going to ride rough-shod over us; but they  aren't, and we must show them we aren't going to be trampled on.\"    \"So we will,\" cried Jack Vance excitedly, \"and that jolly quick!\"    \"But how?\"    There was a moment's pause.  \"I'm sure I don't know,\" answered Jack  sadly, and so the meeting terminated.    The fact of the insult, which had been put upon them by the destruction  of their snow man, remaining unavenged, caused a sense of gloom to rest  upon the Birchites, as though they already felt themselves suffering  beneath the yoke of the conquering Philistines.  Even the bedroom feuds  were forgotten: night after night the \"House of Lords\" left the  \"Dogs' Home\" in undisturbed tranquillity, and the occupants of the  \"Main-top\" retired to rest without even putting a washstand against  their door.  One thought occupied the minds of all, and even Mugford,  when asked on one occasion by Mr. Blake who were the conspirators in the  Gunpowder Plot, answered absent-mindedly, \"The Philistines!\"    \"Look here, you two,\" said Diggory one evening, as he scrambled into  bed, \"we three must think of some way of paying those fellows out for  knocking down our snow man.  It would be splendid if we could say that  the Triple Alliance had done it, and without telling any one  beforehand.\"    \"So we will,\" answered Jack Vance; \"that is if you'll think of the plan.  I'm not able to make one, and I'm jolly sure Mugford can't.\"    The speaker turned over and went to sleep; but after what seemed half  the night had passed, he was suddenly aroused by several violent tugs at  his bed-clothes.  Thinking it nothing less than a midnight raid, Jack  sprang up and grasped his pillow.    \"No, no, it's not that,\" said Diggory, \"but I wanted to help you;  I've got an idea.\"    \"W--what about?\" asked the other, in a sleepy voice.    \"Why, how we can pay out the Philistines!\"    \"Oh, bother the Philistines!\" grumbled Jack, and promptly returned to  the land of dreams.    \"I wonder where those fellows Vance and Trevanock are?\" said Acton the  following afternoon, as the boys were picking up for a game at  prisoner's base.  \"And there's that dummy of a Mugford--where's he  sneaked off to? he never will play games if he can possibly help it.\"    They set to work, and at the end of about twenty minutes were engaged in  a most exciting rally.  Acton had started out to rescue one of the  prisoners, while Shaw had rushed forth to capture Acton.  Morris left  the base with similar designs on Shaw, and every one, with the exception  of the den-keepers, seemed suddenly seized with an irresistible desire  to do something.  The playground was full of boys rushing and dodging  all over the place, when suddenly everybody stood still and listened.  Some one was pounding with his clinched fist at the door opening into  Locker's Lane, and at the same time Jack Vance was heard shouting,  \"Let us in quick, or the Philistines'll have us!\"    Acton ran to fetch the key, and the next moment the three members of the  Triple Alliance dashed through the open door, which was hastily secured  behind them, while a shout of baffled rage some little distance down the  road showed that they had only narrowly escaped falling into the hands  of the enemy.  The pursuit, however, was evidently abandoned, and  Morris, climbing on the roof of the shed, saw young Noaks and Hogson  slowly retreating round the corner of the road.    The three friends certainly presented a striking appearance.  Mugford's  nose was bleeding, Jack Vance's collar seemed to have been nearly torn  off his neck, while Diggory's cap was in his hand, and his hair in a  state of wild disorder.  Their faces, flushed with running, were radiant  with a look of triumph, while all three, the unfortunate Mugford  included, leaned up against the wall, and laughed until the tears ran  down their cheeks.    \"What have you fellows been up to?\" cried Acton; \"why don't you tell  us?\"    \"Oh my!\" gasped Diggory, \"we've taken a fine rise out of the  Philistines; they can't say we're not quits with them now!\" and he went  off into a fresh fit of merriment.    Shaw and Morris seized hold of Jack Vance, and at length succeeded in  shaking him into a sufficient state of sobriety to be able to answer  their questions.    \"Oh dear,\" he said faintly, \"I never laughed so much in my life before!  Diggory ought to tell you, because he planned it all.  We went very  quietly down to Horace House, and found the double doors were shut.  You know just what they're like, how the wall curves in a bit, and  there's a scraper close to the gate-post, on either side, about a foot  from the ground.  We'd got an old play-box cord with us, and we tied it  to each of the scrapers.  The doors have a sort of iron ring for a  handle, and through this we stuck a broken cricket-stump, and Mug and I  held the two ends so that you couldn't possibly lift the latch on the  inside.  Then--but you go on, Diggy.\"    \"Well, then,\" continued the other, \"I scrambled on to these two chaps'  shoulders, and looked over the top of the door.  We could hear some of  the Philistines knocking about on the gravel, and I saw there were  about half a dozen of them playing footer with a tennis-ball.  I shouted  out, 'Hullo!  Good-afternoon!'  They all stood still in a moment, and  young Noaks cried, 'Why, it's a Birchite!--What do you want here, you  young dog?'  I couldn't think of anything else to say, so I said,  'I want to know if this is the bear-pit or the monkey-house.'  My eye,  you should have seen them!  I dropped down in a trice, and they all  rushed to the doors; but they couldn't lift the latch, because Mug and  Jack were holding fast to the stump.  We waited a moment, and then let  go and ran for it.  You may judge what happened next.  It's a regular  sea of mud outside those gates.  They all came rushing out together, and  I saw Noaks and Hogson go head first over the rope, and two or three  others fall flat on the top of them.  It was a sight, I can tell you!\"    \"Yes, but that wasn't all,\" interrupted Jack Vance.  \"Bernard, one of  their big chaps, hopped over the rest and came after us.  We ran for all  we were worth, but he collared me.  Mugford went for him, and hung  on to his coat like a young bull-terrier, and got a smack on the nose;  and just then Diggory turned, and came prancing back, and ran his head  into the beggar's stomach, and that doubled him up, and so we all got  away.  But,\" concluded the speaker, turning towards his wounded comrade,  \"I never thought old Mug had so much grit in him before; he stuck to it  like a Briton!\"    A demonstration of the most genuine enthusiasm followed this warlike  speech.  Acton folded Diggory to his breast in a loving embrace, Shaw  and Morris stuffed the door-key down Mugford's back, while the remainder  of the company executed a war-dance round Jack Vance.    \"My eye,\" cried the dux, \"won't the Philistines be wild!  Fancy upsetting them in the mud, and knocking Bernard's wind out!  They won't be in a hurry to meddle with us again.  Well done, Diggy!\"    \"It wasn't I alone,\" said the author of the enterprise; \"we did it  between us--the Triple Alliance.\"    \"Then three cheers for the Triple Alliance!\" cried Acton.    The company shouted themselves hoarse, for every one felt that the  honour of The Birches had been retrieved, and that the day was still far  distant when they would be crushed beneath the iron heel of young Noaks,  or be exposed as an unresisting prey to the ravages of the wild hordes  of Horace House.        CHAPTER IV.      THE SUPPER CLUB.    As this story is to be a history of the Triple Alliance, and not of The  Birches, it will be necessary to pass over many things which happened  at the preparatory school, in order that full justice may be done to the  important parts played by our three friends in an epoch of strange and  stirring events at Ronleigh College.    Diggory, by the daring exploit described in the previous chapter, won  all hearts; and instead of being looked upon as a new boy, was regarded  quite as an old and trusty comrade.  Acton displayed marked favour  towards the Triple Alliance, and was even more friendly with Diggory and  Jack Vance than with his room and class mates, Shaw and Morris.    The Philistines seemed, for the time being, paralyzed by the humiliation  of their mud bath, and for many months there was a complete cessation  from hostilities.    It was perhaps only natural that in time of peace a brave knight like  Acton"]]]
