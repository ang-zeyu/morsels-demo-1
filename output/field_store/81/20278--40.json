That is the only  way we can get the men and bring back our veterans. There is no other way.  Action along this line should not be postponed beyond March, in order to  avoid uncertainty and disruption.    DOMESTIC AFFAIRS    I. THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK    Prophets of doom predicted that the United States could not escape a  runaway inflation during the war and an economic collapse after the war.  These predictions have not been borne out. On the contrary, the record of  economic stabilization during the war and during the period of reconversion  has been an outstanding accomplishment.    We know, however, that nothing is as dangerous as overconfidence, in war or  in peace. We have had to fight hard to hold the line. We have made  strenuous efforts to speed reconversion. But neither the danger of a  postwar inflation nor of a subsequent collapse in production and employment  is yet overcome. We must base our policies not on unreasoning optimism or  pessimism but upon a candid recognition of our objectives and upon a  careful analysis of foreseeable trends.    Any precise appraisal of the economic outlook at this time is particularly  difficult. The period of demobilization and reconversion is fraught with  uncertainties. There are also serious gaps in our statistical information.  Certain tendencies are, however, fairly clear and recognition of them  should serve as background for the consideration of next year's Federal  Program. In general, the outlook for business is good, and it is likely to  continue to be good--provided we control inflation and achieve peace in  management labor relations.    Civilian production and employment can be expected to increase throughout  the next year. This does not mean, however, that continuing full employment  is assured. It is probable that demobilization of the armed forces will  proceed faster than the increase in civilian employment opportunities. Even  if substantial further withdrawals from the labor market occur,  unemployment will increase temporarily. The extent to which this  unemployment will persist depends largely on the speed of industrial  expansion and the effectiveness of the policies of the Federal Government.    Along with extraordinary demand there are still at this time many critical  shortages resulting from the war. These extraordinary demands and shortages  may lead to a speculative boom, especially in the price of securities, real  estate, and inventories.    Therefore, our chief worry still is inflation. While we control this  inflationary pressure we must look forward to the time when this  extraordinary demand will subside. It will be years before we catch up with  the demand for housing. The extraordinary demand for other durable goods,  for the replenishment of inventories, and for exports may be satisfied  earlier. No backlog of demand can exist very long in the face of our  tremendous productive capacity. We must expect again to face the problem of  shrinking demand and consequent slackening in sales, production, and  employment. This possibility of a deflationary spiral in the future will  exist unless we now plan and adopt an effective full employment program.    2. GENERAL POLICIES--IMMEDIATE AND LONG-RANGE    During the war, production for civilian use was limited by war needs and  available manpower. Economic stabilization required measures, to spread  limited supplies equitably by rationing, price controls, increased taxes,  savings bond campaigns, and credit controls. Now, with the surrender of our  enemies, economic stabilization requires that policies be directed toward  promoting an increase in supplies at low unit prices.    We must encourage the development of resources and enterprises in all parts  of the country, particularly in underdeveloped areas. For example, the  establishment of new peacetime industries in the Western States and in the  South would, in my judgment, add to existing production and markets rather  than merely bring about a shifting of production. I am asking the  Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, and Labor to explore jointly methods  for stimulating new industries, particularly in areas with surplus  agricultural labor.    We must also aid small businessmen and particularly veterans who are  competent to start their own businesses. The establishment and development  of efficient small business ventures, I believe, will not take away from,  but rather will add to, the total business of all enterprises.    Even with maximum encouragement of Production, we cannot hope to remove  scarcities within a short time. The most serious deficiencies will persist  in the fields of residential housing, building materials, and consumers'  durable goods. The critical situation makes continued rent control, price  control, and priorities, allocations, and inventory controls absolutely  essential. Continued control of consumer credit will help to reduce the  pressure on prices of durable goods and will also prolong the period during  which the backlog demand will be effective.    While we are meeting these immediate needs we must look forward to a  long-range program of security and increased standard of living.    The best protection of purchasing power is a policy of full production and  full employment opportunities. Obviously, an employed worker is a better  customer than an unemployed worker. There always will be, however, some  frictional unemployment. In the present period of transition we must deal  with such temporary unemployment as results from the fact that  demobilization will proceed faster than reconversion or industrial  expansion. Such temporary unemployment is probably unavoidable in a period  of rapid change. The unemployed worker is a victim of conditions beyond his  control. He should be enabled to maintain a reasonable standard of living  for himself and his family.    The most serious difficulty in the path of reconversion and expansion is  the establishment of a fair wage structure.    The ability of labor and management to work together, and the wage and  price policies which they develop, are social and economic issues of first  importance.    Both labor and management have a special interest. Labor's interest is very  direct and personal because working conditions, wages, and prices affect  the very life and happiness of the worker and his family.    Management has a no less direct interest because on management rests the  responsibility for conducting a growing and prosperous business.    But management and labor have identical interests in the long run. Good  wages mean good markets. Good business means more jobs and better wages. In  this age of cooperation and in our highly organized economy the problems of  one very soon become the problems of all.    Better human relationships are an urgent need to which organized labor and  management should address themselves. No government policy can make men  understand each other, agree, and get along unless they conduct themselves  in a way to foster mutual respect and good will.    The Government can, however, help to develop machinery which, with the  backing of public opinion, will assist labor and management to resolve  their disagreements in a peaceful manner and reduce the number and duration  of strikes.    All of us realize that productivity--increased output per man--is in the  long run the basis of our standard of living. Management especially must  realize that if labor is to work wholeheartedly for an increase in  production, workers must be given a just share of increased output in  higher wages.    Most industries and most companies have adequate leeway within which to  grant substantial wage increases. These increases will have a direct effect  in increasing consumer demand to the high levels needed. Substantial wage  increases are good business for business because they assure a large market  for their products; substantial wage increases are good business for labor  because they increase labor's standard of living; substantial wage  increases are good business for the country as a whole because capacity  production means an active, healthy, friendly citizenry enjoying the  benefits of democracy under our free enterprise system.    Labor and management in many industries have been operating successfully  under the Government's wage-price policy. Upward revisions of wage scales  have been made in thousands of establishments throughout the Nation since  VJ-day. It is estimated that about 6 million workers, or more than 20  percent of all employees in nonagricultural and nongovernmental  establishments, have received wage increases since August 18, 1945. The  amounts of increases given by individual employers concentrate between 10  and 15 percent, but range from less than 5 percent to over 30 percent.    The United States Conciliation Service since VJ-day has settled over 3,000  disputes affecting over 1,300,000 workers without a strike threat and has  assisted in settling about 1,300 disputes where strikes were threatened  which involved about 500,000 workers. Only workers directly involved, and  not those in related industries who might have been indirectly affected,  are included in these estimates.    Many of these adjustments have occurred in key industries and would have  seemed to us major crises if they had not been settled peaceably.    Within the framework of the wage-price policy there has been definite  success, and it is to be expected that this success will continue in a vast  majority of the cases arising in the months ahead.    However, everyone who realizes the extreme need for a swift and orderly  reconversion must feel a deep concern about the number of major strikes now  in progress. If long continued, these strikes could put a heavy brake on  our program."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50535"],[0,"Blood Atonement and the Origin of Plural Marriage: A Discussion (#5)"],[1,"off their ears.\"--Journal of Discourses, vol.  1:213.    Brigham said again, March 27, 1853: \"I say, rather than that apostates  should flourish here, I will unsheath my bowie knife, and conquer or  die. (Great commotion in the congregation and a simultaneous burst  of feeling, assenting to the declaration.) Now, you nasty apostates,  clear out, or judgment will be put to the line and righteousness to  the plummet. (Voices generally, 'Go it, go it.') If you say it is all  right, raise your hands (all hands up). Let us call upon the Lord to  assist us in this and every good work.\"--Journal of Discourses, vol.  1:83.    Echoing what Brigham said, P. P. Pratt said, on March 27, 1853, \"My  feelings are with those who have spoken, decidedly and firmly so. * *  * I need not repeat their doom, it has been told here today, they have  been faithfully warned. * * * It is too late in the day for _us_ to  stop and inquire whether such an outcast has the truth.\"--Journal of  Discourses, vol. 1, pp. 84, 86.    Elder Orson Hyde said April 9, 1853: \"Suppose the shepherd should  discover a wolf approaching the flock, what would he be likely to do?  Why, we would suppose, if the wolf was within proper distance, that he  would kill him at once * * * kill him on the spot. * * * It would have  a tendency to place a terror on those who leave these parts, that may  prove their salvation when they see the heads of thieves taken off, or  shot down before the public.\"--Journal of Discourses, vol. 1:72, 73.    President Brigham Young preached, February 8, 1857, as follows \"All  mankind love themselves; and let these principles be known by an  individual and he would be glad to have his blood shed. That would be  loving themselves even to an eternal exaltation. Will you love your  brothers and sisters likewise when they have committed a sin that  cannot be atoned for without the shedding of blood? That is what Jesus  Christ meant. He never told a man or woman to love their enemies in  their wickedness. He never intended any such thing.    \"I could refer you to plenty of instances where men have been  righteously slain in order to atone for their sins. I have seen scores  and hundreds of people for whom there would have been a chance in the  last resurrection if their lives had been taken and their blood spilled  upon the ground, as a smoking incense to the Almighty, but who are now  angels to the devil, until our elder brother, Jesus Christ, raises them  up, conquers death, hell and the grave.[3] I have known a great many  men who have left this church, for whom there is no chance whatever for  exaltation; but if their blood had been spilt it would have been better  for them. The wickedness and ignorance of the nations forbid this  principle being in full force, but the time will come when the law of  God will be in full force.    \"This is loving our neighbor as ourselves; if he needs help, help  him; and if he wants salvation and it is necessary to spill his blood  upon the ground in order that he may be saved, spill it.\"--Journal of  Discourses, vol. 4, p. 220, or Deseret News, vol. 6, p. 397.    President J. M. Grant said, September 21, 1856: \"I say there are men  and women here that I would advise to go to the president immediately,  and ask him to appoint a committee to attend to their case, and  then let a place be selected, and let that committee shed their  blood.\"--_Deseret News_, vol. 6, p. 235.    President Heber C. Kimball said; July 19, 1854: \"It is believed in the  world that our females are all common women. Well, in one sense they  are common--that is, they are like all other women, I suppose, but they  are not unclean, for we wipe all unclean ones out of our midst; we not  only wipe them from our streets, but we wipe them out of existence. And  if the world wants to practice uncleanness, and bring their prostitutes  here, if they do not repent and forsake their sins, we will wipe the  evil out. We will not have them in this valley unless they repent, for  so help me God, while I live I will lend my hand to wipe such persons  out, and I know this people will.\"--_Deseret News_, August 16, 1854,  and _Millennial Star_, vol. 16, pages 738-9.    The above statements speak for themselves, and these were what I read  to the reporter. You ask, \"Do you _know_ of anyone whose blood was  ever shed by the command of the church or members thereof to save his  soul?\" To _know_ by hearing such a command given, or seeing a murder  committed, is one thing, to believe the evidence of many who have  testified is another. No sir, I was never present when such a command  was given, nor when murder was committed; but I have read that which  leads me to believe that under Brighamism, Utah was for years a land  of assassination and a field of blood. What of the Mountain Meadow  massacre--the destruction of the Aiken party; the dying confession of  Bishop J. D. Lee; the Hickman butcheries; the Danties? Alfred Henry  Lewis, writing in _Collier's Weekly_ for March 26, 1904, states:  \"Brigham Young invented his destroying angels, placed himself at their  head, and when a man rebelled, _he had him murdered_, if one fled the  fold he was pursued and slain.\"    The world has recently read the testimony of persons under oath, in  Washington, who testified concerning the endowment oaths, so I will  forbear any further remarks on this subject.      POLYGAMY    Speaking of \"plural marriage,\" you say, \"I shall not discuss its  _virtues_.\" Surely that is kind. Let civilization give ear, Mr. Smith  calls that a virtue which wrecks the happiness of every woman who is  enslaved by it, that doctrine which permits Brighamites to live in what  they call marriage with three sisters at one time, with mother and  daughter at the same time. Your father, Joseph F. Smith, married and is  now living with _two sisters as wives_. I refer to Julina Lambson and  Edna Lambson, both bearing children to him; yet you call that system a  _virtue_.    I have no evidence that those men you refer to, as having practiced  polygamy _before Young was guilty, as stated by you_. But the following  evidence shows clearly that Brigham Young was under suspicion before  Joseph's death, and that he has since admitted that he had a revelation  on polygamy before the church knew anything of the doctrine:    In a speech of Brigham Young on June 21, 1874, (see _Deseret News_ of  July 1, 1874), we read the following statement relative to the origin  of this doctrine of polygamy:        While we were in England (in 1839 and 1840, I think) the Lord      manifested to me by vision and His Spirit, things that I did not      then understand. I never opened my mouth to anyone concerning them,      until I returned to Nauvoo; _Joseph had never mentioned this; there      had never been a thought of it in the church_ that I ever knew      anything about at that time;--but I had this for myself and kept it      for myself.--The Messenger, volume 1, page 29.    Well, no one need blame Joseph any more, Brigham is the self-confessed  channel through which polygamy was given to his people.    I here submit the testimony of Brigham Young's legal wife, who left him  after he was untrue to her. Testimony of Major Thomas Wanless, given to  R. C. Evans, his nephew, in the presence of Mrs. Wanless, Mrs. Evans  and her daughter, in St. Louis, Missouri, September 7, 1904:        I met Brigham Young's first and legal wife and her daughter in the      winter of 1860 and 1861, at Central City, Colorado; she told me      that Joseph Smith had nothing to do with polygamy; that he did not      teach, practice, or in any way endorse the doctrine of polygamy,      that he had nothing to do with the so-called revelation on      celestial marriage; that he had but one wife. My husband, Brigham      Young, Orson Pratt (she gave the name of another man whose name I      have forgotten) made up the revelation on celestial marriage.        Before they left Illinois some of them practiced polygamy. Brigham      Young went to Utah to reorganize the church and publicly introduced      polygamy, or to reorganize the Church on a polygamous basis.        She left Brigham Young, finally obtained a divorce from him, and      was then living with her daughter. Brigham sent the daughter money      according to an agreement. She told me they ought to have shot      Brigham Young in place of Joseph Smith.    This statement of Major Wanless that she was Brigham's first wife is  a mistake. Brigham married Miriam Works, October 8, 1824; she died  September 8, 1832. In February, 1834, he married May Ann Angel; she  was his _legal wife_, and perhaps is the one referred to by the Major.  It is quite pardonable in Major Wanless in getting Brigham's wives  mixed up. We opine poor Brigham was at his wit's end to keep the family  record correct himself.    Chambers' encyclopedia, volume 8, students' edition, confirms Mrs.  Young's statement, in part. It says, speaking of the practice of  polygamy: \"Young, Pratt and Hyde are its true originators. Emma, wife  and widow of the prophet, stoutly denied that her husband had any wife  but herself. Young's revelation she declared to be a fraud.\"    From a host of other witnesses who testify that Brigham Young was the  man that introduced polygamy in the Church, I submit the statement of  another broken-hearted woman from the ranks of Brigham's Church. Fanny  Stenhouse says: \"Polygamy was unheard of among the (English) Saints in  1849.\" (pages 45, 47, 48) \"Tell It All,\" by Fanny Stenhouse. \"In June  1850, I heard the first whisper of polygamy. In January, 1853, I first  saw the revelation on Polygamy; it was published in the _Millennial  Star_,\" (page 132).    \"Out of thirty thousand Saints in England in 1853, 1776 had been  excommunicated for apostasy through polygamy, the president of the  conference was cut off,\" (page 160). When speaking regarding polygamy  she says: \"They know that the only source of"]]]
