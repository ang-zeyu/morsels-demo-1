[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8220"],[0,"Remarks (#5)"],[1,"cat. Mr.  Sweeney had a large cat, named Dr. Mary Walker, of which he was very fond.  Dr. Mary Walker remained at the drug store all the time, and was known all  over St. Paul as a quiet and reserved cat. If Dr. Mary Walker took in the  town after office hours, nobody seemed to know anything about it. She  would be around bright and cheerful the next morning and attend to her  duties at the store just as though nothing whatever had happened.    One day last summer Mr. Sweeney left a large plate of fly-paper with water  on it in the window, hoping to gather in a few quarts of flies in a  deceased state. Dr. Mary Walker used to go to this window during the  afternoon and look out on the busy street while she called up pleasant  memories of her past life. That afternoon she thought she would call up  some more memories, so she went over on the counter and from there jumped  down on the window-sill, landing with all four feet in the plate of  fly-paper.    At first she regarded it as a joke, and treated the matter very lightly,  but later on she observed that the fly-paper stuck to her feet with great  tenacity of purpose. Those who have never seen the look of surprise and  deep sorrow that a cat wears when she finds herself glued to a whole sheet  of fly-paper, cannot fully appreciate the way Dr. Mary Walker felt. She  did not dash wildly through a $150 plate-glass window, as some cats would  have done. She controlled herself and acted in the coolest manner, though  you could have seen that mentally she suffered intensely. She sat down a  moment to more fully outline a plan for the future. In doing so, she made  a great mistake. The gesture resulted in glueing the fly-paper to her  person in such a way that the edge turned up behind in the most abrupt  manner, and caused her great inconvenience.    [Illustration: AT FIRST SHE REGARDED IT AS A JOKE.]    Some one at that time laughed in a coarse and heartless way, and I wish  you could have seen the look of pain that Dr. Mary Walker gave him.    Then she went away. She did not go around the prescription case as the  rest of us did, but strolled through the middle of it, and so on out  through the glass door at the rear of the store. We did not see her go  through the glass door, but we found pieces of fly-paper and fur on the  ragged edges of a large aperture in the glass, and we kind of jumped at  the conclusion that Dr. Mary Walker had taken that direction in retiring  from the room.    Dr. Mary Walker never returned to St. Paul, and her exact whereabouts are  not known, though every effort was made to find her. Fragments of flypaper  and brindle hair were found as far west as the Yellowstone National Park,  and as far north as the British line, but the doctor herself was not  found. My own theory is, that if she turned her bow to the west so as to  catch the strong easterly gale on her quarter, with the sail she had set  and her tail pointing directly toward the zenith, the chances for Dr. Mary  Walker's immediate return are extremely slim.    [Illustration]          The Heyday of Life.    There will always be a slight difference in the opinions of the young and  the mature, relative to the general plan on which the solar system should  be operated, no doubt. There are also points of disagreement in other  matters, and it looks as though there always would be.    To the young the future has a more roseate hue. The roseate hue comes  high, but we have to use it in this place. To the young there spreads out  across the horizon a glorious range of possibilities. After the youth has  endorsed for an intimate friend a few times, and purchased the paper at  the bank himself later on, the horizon won't seem to horizon so  tumultuously as it did aforetime. I remember at one time of purchasing  such a piece of accommodation paper at a bank, and I still have it. I  didn't need it any more than a cat needs eleven tails at one and the same  time. Still the bank made it an object for me, and I secured it. Such  things as these harshly knock the flush and bloom off the cheek of youth,  and prompt us to turn the strawberry box bottom side up before we purchase  it.    Youth is gay and hopeful, age is covered with experience and scars where  the skin has been knocked off and had to grow on again. To the young a  dollar looks large and strong, but to the middle-aged and the old it is  weak and inefficient.    When we are in the heyday and fizz of existence, we believe everything;  but after awhile we murmur: \"What's that you are givin' us,\" or words of  like character. Age brings caution and a lot of shop-worn experience,  purchased at the highest market price. Time brings vain regrets and wisdom  teeth that can be left in a glass of water over night.    Still we should not repine. If people would repine less and try harder to  get up an appetite by persweating in someone's vineyard at so much per  diem, it would be better. The American people of late years seem to have a  deeper and deadlier repugnance for mannish industry, and there seems to be  a growing opinion that our crops are more abundant when saturated with  foreign perspiration. European sweat, if I may be allowed to use such a  low term, is very good in its place, but the native-born Duke of Dakota,  or the Earl of York State should remember that the matter of perspiration  and posterity should not be left solely to the foreigner.    There are too many Americans who toil not, neither do they spin. They  would be willing to have an office foisted upon them, but they would  rather blow their so-called brains out than to steer a pair of large  steel-gray mules from day to day. They are too proud to hoe corn, for fear  some great man will ride by and see the termination of their shirts  extending out through the seats of their pantaloons, but they are not too  proud to assign their shattered finances to a friend and their shattered  remains to the morgue.    Pride is all right if it is the right kind, but the pride that prompts a  man to kill his mother, because she at last refuses to black his boots any  more, is an erroneous pride. The pride that induces a man to muss up the  carpet with his brains because there is nothing left for him to do but to  labor, is the kind that Lucifer had when he bolted the action of the  convention and went over to the red-hot minority.    Youth is the spring-time of life. It is the time to acquire information,  so that we may show it off in after years and paralyze people with what we  know. The wise youth will \"lay low\" till he gets a whole lot of knowledge,  and then in later days turn it loose in an abrupt manner. He will guard  against telling what he knows, a little at a time. That is unwise. I once  knew a youth who wore himself out telling people all he knew from day to  day, so that when he became a bald-headed man he was utterly exhausted and  didn't have anything left to tell anyone. Some of the things that we know  should be saved for our own use. The man who sheds all his knowledge, and  don't leave enough to keep house with, fools himself.          They Fell.    Two delegates to the General Convocation of the Sons of Ice Water were  sitting in the lobby of the Windsor, in the city of Denver, not long ago,  strangers to each other and to everybody else. One came from Huerferno  county, and the other was a delegate from the Ice Water Encampment of  Correjos county.    From the beautiful billiard hall came the sharp rattle of ivory balls, and  in the bar-room there was a glitter of electric light, cut glass, and  French plate mirrors. Out of the door came the merry laughter of the giddy  throng, flavored with fragrant Havana smoke and the delicate odor of lemon  and mirth and pine apple and cognac.    The delegate from Correjos felt lonely, and he turned to the Ice Water  representative from Huerferno:    \"That was a bold and fearless speech you made this afternoon on the demon  rum at the convocation.\"    \"Think so?\" said the sad Huerferno man.    \"Yes, you entered into the description of rum's maniac till I could almost  see the red-eyed centipedes and tropical hornets in the air. How could you  describe the jimjams so graphically?\"    \"Well, you see, I'm a reformed drunkard. Only a little while ago I was in  the gutter.\"    \"So was I.\"    \"How long ago?\"    \"Week ago day after to-morrow.\"    \"Next Tuesday it'll be a week since I quit.\"    \"Well, I swan!\"    \"Ain't it funny?\"    \"Tolerable.\"      \"It's going to be a long, cold winter; don't you think so?\"    \"Yes, I dread it a good deal.\"      \"It's a comfort, though, to know that you never will touch rum again.\"    \"Yes, I am glad in my heart to-night that I am free from it. I shall never  touch rum again.\"    When he said this he looked up at the other delegate, and they looked into  each other's eyes earnestly, as though each would read the other's soul.  Then the Huerferno man said:    \"In fact, I never did care much for rum.\"    Then there was a long pause.    Finally the Correjos man ventured: \"Do you have to use an antidote to cure  the thirst?\"    \"Yes, I've had to rely on that a good deal at first. Probably this vain  yearning that I now feel in the pit of the bosom will disappear after  awhile.\"    \"Have you got any antidote with you?\"    \"Yes, I've got some up in 232-1/2. If you'll come up I'll give you a  dose.\"    \"There's no rum in it, is there?\"    \"No.\"    Then they went up the elevator. They did not get down to breakfast, but at  dinner they stole in. The man from Huerferno dodged nervously through the  archway leading to the dining-room as though he had doubts about getting  through so small a space with his augmented head, and the man from  Correjos looked like one who had wept his eyes almost blind over the woe  that rum has wrought in our fair land.    When the waiter asked the delegate from Correjos for his dessert order,  the red-nosed Son of Ice Water said: \"Bring me a cup of tea, some pudding"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8299"],[0,"Filipino Popular Tales (#5)"],[1,"owe something to Occidental influence.    In two of our variants it is the mother who in her fond pride places  her son in jeopardy of losing his head. As the hero is a young  bachelor when the story opens, the exploitation of his prowess would  naturally devolve upon his mother. The burning of the magic book  is found in version c, though the incident of the collapsing of the  room or house is lacking in all our variants. The most characteristic  episode, however, in the Philippine members of this cycle, is the  betting-contest between the two kings. It is introduced five times  into the four tales. Its only other occurrence that I know of in this  cycle is in an Arabian story cited by Cosquin (2 : 192), which follows.      One day, when the king was boasting of his conjurer before some other  kings, they said to him, \"We too have some diviners. Let us compare  their wits with the wisdom of your man.\" The kings then buried three  pots,--one filled with milk, another with honey, and the third with  pitch. The conjurers of the other kings could not say what was in  the pots. Then Asfour (the hero) was called. He turned to his wife,  and said, \"All this (trouble) comes of you. We could have left the  country. The first (time) it was milk; the second, honey; the third,  pitch.\" The kings were dumfounded. \"He has named the milk, the honey,  and the pitch without hesitation,\" they said, and they gave him  a pension.    The close resemblance between this detail and the corresponding one  (F) in \"Juan the Guesser\" is immediately evident. The fact that the  difficulty in Juan's career is overcome, not by an \"ejaculation guess,\"  but by a providential accident (much the same thing, however), does  not decrease the significance of the two passages.    That the betting-contest between the two kings is an Oriental  conception (very likely based on actual early custom) is further  borne out by its appearance in a remarkable group of Eastern stories  of the \"Clever Lass\" type (see Child, English and Scottish Ballads,  1 : 11). \"The gist of these narratives,\" writes Professor Child,  \"is that one king propounds tasks to another; in the earlier ones,  with the intent to discover whether his brother-monarch enjoys the aid  of such counsellors as will make an attack on him dangerous; in the  later, with the demand that he shall acquit himself satisfactorily,  or suffer a forfeit: and the king is delivered from a serious strait  by the sagacity either of a minister . . . or of the daughter of his  minister, who came to her father's assistance .... These tasks are  always such as require ingenuity of one kind or another, whether in  devising practical experiments, in contriving subterfuges, in solving  riddles, or even in constructing compliments.\"    One other Oriental variant of this story may be cited because of its  similarity to two of our tales (cf. our episodes C and C2). This is  an Anamese version, printed in the \"Chrestomathie cochin-chinoise\"  (Paris, 1872), 1 : 30:--    There was once a man who, being qualified for nothing, and not  knowing how to earn a living, made up his mind one day to become  a diviner. As luck had many times served him, the public came to  believe in his oracles.... He amassed a good round sum, and day  by day his success made him more bold and boastful. Once a golden  tortoise disappeared from the palace of the king. As all searches for  it resulted in nothing, some one mentioned the diviner to the king,  and begged permission to summon him. The king ordered his litter  prepared, the escort and the umbrellas of honor, and sent to have  the conjurer fetched. When the conjurer learned what was the matter,  he was very much disturbed, but he could not resist the commands  of the king. Accordingly he dressed himself, entered the litter,  and set out. Along the road the poor diviner continually bemoaned  his fate. Finally he cried out, \"What is the use of groaning? The  stomach (bung) has caused it all; the belly (da) will suffer for it\"  (an Anamese proverb). Now, it happened that the two litter-bearers  were named Bung and Da, and it was they who had stolen the king's gold  tortoise. When they heard the exclamation of the diviner, they believed  that they had been discovered. They begged him to have pity on them;  they confessed that they had stolen the tortoise and had hidden it  in the gutter. \"Very well,\" said the diviner, \"I will spare you; I  will say nothing; reassure yourselves.\" When he reached the palace,  he went through some magical performances, found the tortoise, and  was overwhelmed by the king with rewards and honors.--COSQUIN, 2 : 192.      It is entirely possible that this story and our two stories containing  the same situation are connected. Trading between Manila and Indo-China  has been going on for centuries.    The history of the Philippine story has probably been something like  this: To an early narrative about a wager between two neighboring  kings or datus, in which the winner was aided by the shrewdness of  an advisor (originally having a considerable amount of real ability),  were added other adventures showing how the advisor came to have his  post of honor. The germ of this story doubtless came from India via  the Malay migrations; the additional details possibly belong to a  much later period.    It is, moreover, not impossible that this whole cycle of the lucky  \"anti-hero\" grew up as a conscious antithesis to the earlier cycle  of the genuinely \"Clever Lass\" (see No. 7 in this collection).    In conclusion I might call attention to Benfey's treatment of this  droll in \"Orient und Occident\" (1 : 371 et seq.). Benfey traces the  story from the Orient, but considers that its fullest form is that  given in Schleicher's Lithuanian legends. The tale is also found in  \"Somadeva,\" Chapter XXX (Tawney, 1 : 272-274).        TALE 2    THE CHARCOAL-MAKER WHO BECAME KING.      Narrated by Jose R. Perez, a Tagalog living in Manila, who heard the  story when a boy from his nurse.      Once upon a time there lived a king who had one beautiful  daughter. When she was old enough to be married, her father, as was  the custom in ancient times, made a proclamation throughout his kingdom  thus: \"Whosoever shall be able to bring me ten car-loads of money for  ten successive days shall have the hand of my beautiful daughter and  also my crown. If, however, any one undertakes and fails, he shall  be put to death.\"    A boy, the only son of a poor charcoal-maker, heard this announcement  in his little town. He hurried home to his mother, and said that  he wanted to marry the beautiful princess and to be king of their  country. The mother, however, paid no attention to what her foolish  son had said, for she well knew that they had very little money.    The next day the boy, as usual, took his hatchet and went to the forest  to cut wood. He started to cut down a very huge tree, which would  take him several days to finish. While he was busy with his hatchet,  he seemed to hear a voice saying, \"Cut this tree no more. Dip your  hand into the hole of the trunk, and you will find a purse which  will give you all the money you wish.\" At first he did not pay any  attention to the voice, but finally he obeyed it. To his surprise,  he got the purse, but found it empty. Disappointed, he angrily threw  it away; but as the purse hit the ground, silver money rolled merrily  out of it. The youth quickly gathered up the coins; then, picking up  the purse, he started for home, filled with happiness.    When he reached the house, he spread petates [8] over the floor of  their little hut, called his mother, and began shaking the purse. The  old woman was amazed and delighted when she saw dollars coming out  in what seemed to be an inexhaustible stream. She did not ask her  son where he had found the purse, but was now thoroughly convinced  that he could marry the beautiful princess and be king afterwards.    The next morning she ordered her son to go to the palace to inform  his Majesty that he would bring him the money he demanded in exchange  for his daughter and his crown. The guard of the palace, however,  thought that the youth was crazy; for he was poorly dressed and had  rude manners. Therefore he refused to let him in. But their talk was  overheard by the king, who ordered the guard to present the youth  before him. The king read the announcement, emphasizing the part which  said that in case of failure the contestant would be put to death. To  this condition the charcoal-maker agreed. Then he asked the king  to let him have a talk with his daughter. The meeting was granted,  and the youth was extremely pleased with the beauty and vivacity of  the princess.    After he had bidden her good-by, he told the king to send the cars  with him to get the first ten car-loads of money. The cars were sent  with guards. The drivers and the guards of the convoy were astonished  when they saw the poor charcoal-maker fill the ten cars with bright  new silver dollars. The  princess, too, at first was very much pleased  with such a large sum of money.    Five days went by, and the youth had not failed to send the amount of  money required. \"Five days more, and I shall surely be married!\" said  the princess to herself. \"Married? Yes, married life is like music  without words. But will it be in my case? My future husband is ugly,  unrefined, and of low descent. But--he is rich. Yes, rich; but what  are riches if I am going to be wretched? No, I will not marry him  for all the world. I will play a trick on him.\"    The next day the guard informed her that the riches of the young  man were inexhaustible, for the purse from which he got his money  seemed to be magical. When she heard this, she commanded the guard to  tell the young man that she wished to see him alone. Filled with joy  because of this sign of her favor, the youth hastened to the palace,  conducted by the guard. The princess entertained him regally, "]]]
