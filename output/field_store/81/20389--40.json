It was so good to open up one's lungs and take in whole luscious  barrels-ful of the blessed God's untainted, dew-fashioned,  woodland-scented air once more, after suffocating body and mind for two  days and nights in the moral and physical stenches of that intolerable  old buzzard-roost!  I mean, for me: of course the place was all  right and agreeable enough for Sandy, for she had been used to  high life all her days.    Poor girl, her jaws had had a wearisome rest now for a while,  and I was expecting to get the consequences.  I was right; but she  had stood by me most helpfully in the castle, and had mightily  supported and reinforced me with gigantic foolishnesses which were  worth more for the occasion than wisdoms double their size; so  I thought she had earned a right to work her mill for a while,  if she wanted to, and I felt not a pang when she started it up:    \"Now turn we unto Sir Marhaus that rode with the damsel of thirty  winter of age southward--\"    \"Are you going to see if you can work up another half-stretch on  the trail of the cowboys, Sandy?\"    \"Even so, fair my lord.\"    \"Go ahead, then.  I won't interrupt this time, if I can help it.  Begin over again; start fair, and shake out all your reefs, and  I will load my pipe and give good attention.\"    \"Now turn we unto Sir Marhaus that rode with the damsel of thirty  winter of age southward.  And so they came into a deep forest,  and by fortune they were nighted, and rode along in a deep way,  and at the last they came into a courtelage where abode the duke  of South Marches, and there they asked harbour.  And on the morn  the duke sent unto Sir Marhaus, and bad him make him ready.  And  so Sir Marhaus arose and armed him, and there was a mass sung  afore him, and he brake his fast, and so mounted on horseback in  the court of the castle, there they should do the battle.  So there  was the duke already on horseback, clean armed, and his six sons  by him, and every each had a spear in his hand, and so they  encountered, whereas the duke and his two sons brake their spears  upon him, but Sir Marhaus held up his spear and touched none of  them.  Then came the four sons by couples, and two of them brake  their spears, and so did the other two.  And all this while  Sir Marhaus touched them not.  Then Sir Marhaus ran to the duke,  and smote him with his spear that horse and man fell to the earth.  And so he served his sons.  And then Sir Marhaus alight down, and  bad the duke yield him or else he would slay him.  And then some  of his sons recovered, and would have set upon Sir Marhaus.  Then  Sir Marhaus said to the duke, Cease thy sons, or else I will do  the uttermost to you all.  When the duke saw he might not escape  the death, he cried to his sons, and charged them to yield them  to Sir Marhaus.  And they kneeled all down and put the pommels  of their swords to the knight, and so he received them.  And then  they holp up their father, and so by their common assent promised  unto Sir Marhaus never to be foes unto King Arthur, and thereupon  at Whitsuntide after, to come he and his sons, and put them in  the king's grace.*    [*Footnote: The story is borrowed, language and all, from the  Morte d'Arthur.--M.T.]    \"Even so standeth the history, fair Sir Boss.  Now ye shall wit  that that very duke and his six sons are they whom but few days  past you also did overcome and send to Arthur's court!\"    \"Why, Sandy, you can't mean it!\"    \"An I speak not sooth, let it be the worse for me.\"    \"Well, well, well,--now who would ever have thought it?  One  whole duke and six dukelets; why, Sandy, it was an elegant haul.  Knight-errantry is a most chuckle-headed trade, and it is tedious  hard work, too, but I begin to see that there _is_ money in it,  after all, if you have luck.  Not that I would ever engage in it  as a business, for I wouldn't.  No sound and legitimate business  can be established on a basis of speculation.  A successful whirl  in the knight-errantry line--now what is it when you blow away  the nonsense and come down to the cold facts?  It's just a corner  in pork, that's all, and you can't make anything else out of it.  You're rich--yes,--suddenly rich--for about a day, maybe a week;  then somebody corners the market on _you_, and down goes your  bucket-shop; ain't that so, Sandy?\"    \"Whethersoever it be that my mind miscarrieth, bewraying simple  language in such sort that the words do seem to come endlong  and overthwart--\"    \"There's no use in beating about the bush and trying to get around  it that way, Sandy, it's _so_, just as I say.  I _know_ it's so.  And,  moreover, when you come right down to the bedrock, knight-errantry  is _worse_ than pork; for whatever happens, the pork's left, and  so somebody's benefited anyway; but when the market breaks, in a  knight-errantry whirl, and every knight in the pool passes in his  checks, what have you got for assets?  Just a rubbish-pile of  battered corpses and a barrel or two of busted hardware.  Can you  call _those_ assets?  Give me pork, every time.  Am I right?\"    \"Ah, peradventure my head being distraught by the manifold matters  whereunto the confusions of these but late adventured haps and  fortunings whereby not I alone nor you alone, but every each of us,  meseemeth--\"    \"No, it's not your head, Sandy.  Your head's all right, as far as  it goes, but you don't know business; that's where the trouble  is.  It unfits you to argue about business, and you're wrong  to be always trying.  However, that aside, it was a good haul,  anyway, and will breed a handsome crop of reputation in Arthur's  court.  And speaking of the cowboys, what a curious country this  is for women and men that never get old.  Now there's Morgan le Fay,  as fresh and young as a Vassar pullet, to all appearances, and  here is this old duke of the South Marches still slashing away with  sword and lance at his time of life, after raising such a family  as he has raised.  As I understand it, Sir Gawaine killed seven  of his sons, and still he had six left for Sir Marhaus and me to  take into camp.  And then there was that damsel of sixty winter  of age still excursioning around in her frosty bloom--How old  are you, Sandy?\"    It was the first time I ever struck a still place in her.  The mill  had shut down for repairs, or something.        CHAPTER XX    THE OGRE'S CASTLE    Between six and nine we made ten miles, which was plenty for a  horse carrying triple--man, woman, and armor; then we stopped  for a long nooning under some trees by a limpid brook.    Right so came by and by a knight riding; and as he drew near he  made dolorous moan, and by the words of it I perceived that he  was cursing and swearing; yet nevertheless was I glad of his  coming, for that I saw he bore a bulletin-board whereon in letters  all of shining gold was writ:        \"USE PETERSON'S PROPHYLACTIC TOOTH-BRUSH--ALL THE GO.\"    I was glad of his coming, for even by this token I knew him for  knight of mine.  It was Sir Madok de la Montaine, a burly great  fellow whose chief distinction was that he had come within an ace  of sending Sir Launcelot down over his horse-tail once.  He was  never long in a stranger's presence without finding some pretext  or other to let out that great fact.  But there was another fact  of nearly the same size, which he never pushed upon anybody unasked,  and yet never withheld when asked: that was, that the reason he  didn't quite succeed was, that he was interrupted and sent down  over horse-tail himself.  This innocent vast lubber did not see  any particular difference between the two facts.  I liked him,  for he was earnest in his work, and very valuable.  And he was so  fine to look at, with his broad mailed shoulders, and the grand  leonine set of his plumed head, and his big shield with its quaint  device of a gauntleted hand clutching a prophylactic tooth-brush,  with motto: \"Try Noyoudont.\"  This was a tooth-wash that I was  introducing.    He was aweary, he said, and indeed he looked it; but he would not  alight.  He said he was after the stove-polish man; and with this  he broke out cursing and swearing anew.  The bulletin-boarder  referred to was Sir Ossaise of Surluse, a brave knight, and of  considerable celebrity on account of his having tried conclusions  in a tournament once, with no less a Mogul than Sir Gaheris  himself--although not successfully.  He was of a light and laughing  disposition, and to him nothing in this world was serious.  It was  for this reason that I had chosen him to work up a stove-polish  sentiment.  There were no stoves yet, and so there could be nothing  serious about stove-polish.  All that the agent needed to do was  to deftly and by degrees prepare the public for the great change,  and have them established in predilections toward neatness against  the time when the stove should appear upon the stage.    Sir Madok was very bitter, and brake out anew with cursings.  He  said he had cursed his soul to rags; and yet he would not get down  from his horse, neither would he take any rest, or listen to any  comfort, until he should have found Sir Ossaise and settled this  account.  It appeared, by what I could piece together of the  unprofane fragments of his statement, that he had chanced upon  Sir Ossaise at dawn of the morning, and been told that if he would  make a short cut across the fields and swamps and broken hills and  glades, he could head off a company of travelers who would be rare  customers for prophylactics and tooth-wash.  With characteristic  zeal Sir Madok had plunged away at once upon this quest, and after  three hours of awful crosslot riding had overhauled his game.  And  behold, it was the five patriarchs that had been released from the  dungeons the evening before!  Poor old creatures, it was all of  twenty years since any one of them had known what it was to be  equipped with any remaining snag or remnant of a tooth.

Thus Dissenters were ineligible;  they could not run if asked, they could not serve if elected.  The aldermen, who without any question were Yankees in disguise,  hit upon this neat device: they passed a by-law imposing a fine  of L400 upon any one who should refuse to be a candidate for  sheriff, and a fine of L600 upon any person who, after being  elected sheriff, refused to serve.  Then they went to work and  elected a lot of Dissenters, one after another, and kept it up  until they had collected L15,000 in fines; and there stands the  stately Mansion House to this day, to keep the blushing citizen  in mind of a long past and lamented day when a band of Yankees  slipped into London and played games of the sort that has given  their race a unique and shady reputation among all truly good  and holy peoples that be in the earth.    The girl's case seemed strong to me; the bishop's case was just  as strong.  I did not see how the king was going to get out of  this hole.  But he got out.  I append his decision:    \"Truly I find small difficulty here, the matter being even a  child's affair for simpleness.  An the young bride had conveyed  notice, as in duty bound, to her feudal lord and proper master  and protector the bishop, she had suffered no loss, for the said  bishop could have got a dispensation making him, for temporary  conveniency, eligible to the exercise of his said right, and thus  would she have kept all she had.  Whereas, failing in her first  duty, she hath by that failure failed in all; for whoso, clinging  to a rope, severeth it above his hands, must fall; it being no  defense to claim that the rest of the rope is sound, neither any  deliverance from his peril, as he shall find.  Pardy, the woman's  case is rotten at the source.  It is the decree of the court that  she forfeit to the said lord bishop all her goods, even to the  last farthing that she doth possess, and be thereto mulcted in  the costs.  Next!\"    Here was a tragic end to a beautiful honeymoon not yet three months  old.  Poor young creatures!  They had lived these three months  lapped to the lips in worldly comforts.  These clothes and trinkets  they were wearing were as fine and dainty as the shrewdest stretch  of the sumptuary laws allowed to people of their degree; and in  these pretty clothes, she crying on his shoulder, and he trying  to comfort her with hopeful words set to the music of despair,  they went from the judgment seat out into the world homeless,  bedless, breadless; why, the very beggars by the roadsides were  not so poor as they.    Well, the king was out of the hole; and on terms satisfactory to  the Church and the rest of the aristocracy, no doubt.  Men write  many fine and plausible arguments in support of monarchy, but  the fact remains that where every man in a State has a vote, brutal  laws are impossible.  Arthur's people were of course poor material  for a republic, because they had been debased so long by monarchy;  and yet even they would have been intelligent enough to make short  work of that law which the king had just been administering if it  had been submitted to their full and free vote.  There is a phrase  which has grown so common in the world's mouth that it has come  to seem to have sense and meaning--the sense and meaning implied  when it is used; that is the phrase which refers to this or that or  the other nation as possibly being \"capable of self-government\";  and the implied sense of it is, that there has been a nation  somewhere, some time or other which _wasn't_ capable of it--wasn't as  able to govern itself as some self-appointed specialists were or  would be to govern it.  The master minds of all nations, in all  ages, have sprung in affluent multitude from the mass of the nation,  and from the mass of the nation only--not from its privileged  classes; and so, no matter what the nation's intellectual grade  was; whether high or low, the bulk of its ability was in the long  ranks of its nameless and its poor, and so it never saw the day  that it had not the material in abundance whereby to govern itself.  Which is to assert an always self-proven fact: that even the best  governed and most free and most enlightened monarchy is still  behind the best condition attainable by its people; and that the  same is true of kindred governments of lower grades, all the way  down to the lowest.    King Arthur had hurried up the army business altogether beyond  my calculations.  I had not supposed he would move in the matter  while I was away; and so I had not mapped out a scheme for determining  the merits of officers; I had only remarked that it would be wise  to submit every candidate to a sharp and searching examination;  and privately I meant to put together a list of military qualifications  that nobody could answer to but my West Pointers.  That ought  to have been attended to before I left; for the king was so taken  with the idea of a standing army that he couldn't wait but must  get about it at once, and get up as good a scheme of examination  as he could invent out of his own head.    I was impatient to see what this was; and to show, too, how much  more admirable was the one which I should display to the Examining  Board.  I intimated this, gently, to the king, and it fired his  curiosity.  When the Board was assembled, I followed him in; and  behind us came the candidates.  One of these candidates was a bright  young West Pointer of mine, and with him were a couple of my  West Point professors.    When I saw the Board, I did not know whether to cry or to laugh.  The head of it was the officer known to later centuries as Norroy  King-at-Arms!  The two other members were chiefs of bureaus in  his department; and all three were priests, of course; all officials  who had to know how to read and write were priests.    My candidate was called first, out of courtesy to me, and the head  of the Board opened on him with official solemnity:    \"Name?\"    \"Mal-ease.\"    \"Son of?\"    \"Webster.\"    \"Webster--Webster.  H'm--I--my memory faileth to recall the  name.  Condition?\"    \"Weaver.\"    \"Weaver!--God keep us!\"    The king was staggered, from his summit to his foundations; one  clerk fainted, and the others came near it.  The chairman pulled  himself together, and said indignantly:    \"It is sufficient.  Get you hence.\"    But I appealed to the king.  I begged that my candidate might be  examined.  The king was willing, but the Board, who were all  well-born folk, implored the king to spare them the indignity of  examining the weaver's son.  I knew they didn't know enough to  examine him anyway, so I joined my prayers to theirs and the king  turned the duty over to my professors.  I had had a blackboard  prepared, and it was put up now, and the circus began.  It was  beautiful to hear the lad lay out the science of war, and wallow  in details of battle and siege, of supply, transportation, mining  and countermining, grand tactics, big strategy and little strategy,  signal service, infantry, cavalry, artillery, and all about siege  guns, field guns, gatling guns, rifled guns, smooth bores, musket  practice, revolver practice--and not a solitary word of it all  could these catfish make head or tail of, you understand--and it  was handsome to see him chalk off mathematical nightmares on the  blackboard that would stump the angels themselves, and do it like  nothing, too--all about eclipses, and comets, and solstices, and  constellations, and mean time, and sidereal time, and dinner time,  and bedtime, and every other imaginable thing above the clouds or  under them that you could harry or bullyrag an enemy with and make  him wish he hadn't come--and when the boy made his military salute  and stood aside at last, I was proud enough to hug him, and all  those other people were so dazed they looked partly petrified,  partly drunk, and wholly caught out and snowed under.  I judged  that the cake was ours, and by a large majority.    Education is a great thing.  This was the same youth who had come  to West Point so ignorant that when I asked him, \"If a general  officer should have a horse shot under him on the field of battle,  what ought he to do?\" answered up naively and said:    \"Get up and brush himself.\"    One of the young nobles was called up now.  I thought I would  question him a little myself.  I said:    \"Can your lordship read?\"    His face flushed indignantly, and he fired this at me:    \"Takest me for a clerk?  I trow I am not of a blood that--\"    \"Answer the question!\"    He crowded his wrath down and made out to answer \"No.\"    \"Can you write?\"    He wanted to resent this, too, but I said:    \"You will confine yourself to the questions, and make no comments.  You are not here to air your blood or your graces, and nothing  of the sort will be permitted.  Can you write?\"    \"No.\"    \"Do you know the multiplication table?\"    \"I wit not what ye refer to.\"    \"How much is 9 times 6?\"    \"It is a mystery that is hidden from me by reason that the emergency  requiring the fathoming of it hath not in my life-days occurred,  and so, not having no need to know this thing, I abide barren  of the knowledge.\"    \"If A trade a barrel of onions to B, worth 2 pence the bushel,  in exchange for a sheep worth 4 pence and a dog worth a penny,  and C kill the dog before delivery, because bitten by the same,  who mistook him for D, what sum is still due to A from B, and  which party pays for the dog, C or D, and who gets the money?  If A, is the penny sufficient, or may he claim consequential damages  in the form of additional money to represent the possible profit  which might have inured from the dog, and classifiable as earned  increment, that is to say, usufruct?\"    \"Verily, in the all-wise and unknowable providence of God, who  moveth in mysterious ways his wonders to perform, have I never  heard the fellow to this question for confusion of"]]]
