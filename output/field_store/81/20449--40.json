Mr. Bleke, I hardly know how to break it to  you.\"    \"Break it to me!\"    \"My husband advised you to put a very large sum of money in a mine  called Wildcat Reefs.\"    \"Yes. Thirty thousand pounds.\"    \"As much as that! Oh, Mr. Bleke!\"    She began to cry softly. She pressed his hand. Roland gaped at her.    \"Mr. Bleke, there has been a terrible slump in Wildcat Reefs. To-day,  they may be absolutely worthless.\"    Roland felt as if a cold hand had been laid on his spine.    \"Wor-worthless!\" he stammered.    Mrs. Windlebird looked at him with moist eyes.    \"You can imagine how my husband feels about this. It was on his advice  that you invested your money. He holds himself directly responsible. He  is in a terrible state of mind. He is frantic. He has grown so fond of  you, Mr. Bleke, that he can hardly face the thought that he has been the  innocent instrument of your trouble.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Roland felt that it was an admirable comparison. His sensations were  precisely those of a leading actor in an earthquake. The solid earth  seemed to melt under him.    \"We talked it over last night after you had gone to bed, and we came to  the conclusion that there was only one honorable step to take. We must  make good your losses. We must buy back those shares.\"    A ray of hope began to steal over Roland's horizon.    \"But----\" he began.    \"There are no buts, really, Mr. Bleke. We should neither of us know a  minute's peace if we didn't do it. Now, you paid thirty thousand pounds  for the shares, you said? Well\"--she held out a pink slip of paper to  him--\"this will make everything all right.\"    Roland looked at the check.    \"But--but this is signed by you,\" he said.    \"Yes. You see, if Geoffrey had to sign a check for that amount, it would  mean selling out some of his stock, and in his position, with every  movement watched by enemies, he can not afford to do it. It might ruin  the plans of years. But I have some money of my own. My selling out  stock doesn't matter, you see. I have post-dated the check a week,  to give me time to realize on the securities in which my money is  invested.\"    Roland's whole nature rose in revolt at this sacrifice. If it had  been his host who had made this offer, he would have accepted it.  But chivalry forbade his taking this money from a woman. A glow of  self-sacrifice warmed him. After all, what was this money of his? He had  never had any fun out of it. He had had so little acquaintance with it  that for all practical purposes it might never have been his.    With a gesture which had once impressed him very favorably when  exhibited on the stage by the hero of the number two company of \"The  Price of Honor,\" which had paid a six days' visit to Bury St. Edwards a  few months before, he tore the check into little pieces.    \"I couldn't accept it, Mrs. Windlebird,\" he said. \"I can't tell you how  deeply I appreciate your wonderful kindness, but I really couldn't. I  bought the shares with my eyes open. The whole thing is nobody's fault,  and I can't let you suffer for it. After the way you have treated me  here, it would be impossible. I can't take your money. It's noble and  generous of you in the extreme, but I can't accept it. I've still got a  little money left, and I've always been used to working for my living,  anyway, so--so it's all right.\"    \"Mr. Bleke, I implore you.\"    Roland was hideously embarrassed. He looked right and left for a way of  escape. He could hardly take to his heels, and yet there seemed no other  way of ending the interview. Then, with a start of relief, he perceived  Johnson the groom coming toward him with the evening paper.    \"Johnson said he was going into the town,\" said Roland apologetically,  \"so I asked him to get me an evening paper. I wanted to see the lunch  scores.\"    If he had been looking at his hostess then, an action which he was  strenuously avoiding, he might have seen a curious spasm pass over her  face. Mrs. Windlebird turned very pale and sat down suddenly in the  chair which Roland had vacated at the beginning of their conversation.  She lay back in it with her eyes closed. She looked tired and defeated.    Roland took the paper mechanically. He wanted it as a diversion to  the conversation merely, for his interest in the doings of Surrey and  Yorkshire had waned to the point of complete indifference in competition  with Mrs. Windlebird's news.    Equally mechanically he unfolded it and glanced at front page; and, as  he did do, a flaring explosion of headlines smote his eye.    Out of the explosion emerged the word \"WILD-CATS\".    \"Why!\" he exclaimed. \"There's columns about Wild-cats on the front page  here!\"    \"Yes?\" Mrs. Windlebird's voice sounded strangely dull and toneless. Her  eyes were still closed.    Roland took in the headlines with starting eyes.           THE WILD-CAT REEF GOLD-MINE                ANOTHER KLONDIKE        FRENZIED SCENES ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE             BROKERS FIGHT FOR SHARES                  RECORD BOOM          UNPRECEDENTED RISE IN PRICES    Shorn of all superfluous adjectives and general journalistic exuberance,  what the paper had to announce to its readers was this:        The \"special commissioner\" sent out by The _Financial Argus_ to      make an exhaustive examination of the Wild-cat Reef Mine--with      the amiable view, no doubt, of exploding Mr. Geoffrey Windlebird      once and for all with the confiding British public--has found,      to his unbounded astonishment, that there are vast quantities of      gold in the mine.        The discovery of the new reef, the largest and richest, it is      stated, since the famous Mount Morgan, occurred with dramatic      appropriateness on the very day of his arrival. We need scarcely      remind our readers that, until that moment, Wild-cat Reef shares      had reached a very low figure, and only a few optimists retained      their faith in the mine. As the largest holder, Mr. Windlebird      is to be heartily congratulated on this new addition to his      fortune.        The publication of the expert's report in The _Financial Argus_ has      resulted in a boom in Wild-cats, the like of which can seldom have      been seen on the Stock Exchange. From something like one shilling      and sixpence per bundle the one pound shares have gone up to nearly      ten pounds a share, and even at this latter figure people were      literally fighting to secure them.    The world swam about Roland. He was stupefied and even terrified. The  very atmosphere seemed foggy. So far as his reeling brain was capable  of thought, he figured that he was now worth about two hundred thousand  pounds.    \"Oh, Mrs. Windlebird,\" he cried, \"It's all right after all.\"    Mrs. Windlebird sat back in her chair without answering.    \"It's all right for every one,\" screamed Roland joyfully. \"Why, if I've  made a couple of hundred thousand, what must Mr. Windlebird have netted.  It says here that he is the largest holder. He must have pulled off the  biggest thing of his life.\"    He thought for a moment.    \"The chap I'm sorry for,\" he said meditatively, \"is Mr. Windlebird's  pal. You know. The fellow whom Mr. Windlebird persuaded to sell all his  shares to me.\"    A faint moan escaped from his hostess's pale lips. Roland did not hear  it. He was reading the cricket news.            THE EPISODE OF THE THEATRICAL VENTURE    Third of a Series of Six Stories [First published in _Pictorial Review_,  July 1916]      It was one of those hard, nubbly rolls. The best restaurants charge you  sixpence for having the good sense not to eat them. It hit Roland Bleke  with considerable vehemence on the bridge of the nose. For the moment  Roland fancied that the roof of the Regent Grill-room must have fallen  in; and, as this would automatically put an end to the party, he was not  altogether sorry. He had never been to a theatrical supper-party before,  and within five minutes of his arrival at the present one he had  become afflicted with an intense desire never to go to a theatrical  supper-party again. To be a success at these gay gatherings one must  possess dash; and Roland, whatever his other sterling qualities, was a  little short of dash.    The young man on the other side of the table was quite nice about it.  While not actually apologizing, he went so far as to explain that it was  \"old Gerry\" whom he had had in his mind when he started the roll on  its course. After a glance at old Gerry--a chinless child of about  nineteen--Roland felt that it would be churlish to be angry with a young  man whose intentions had been so wholly admirable. Old Gerry had one of  those faces in which any alteration, even the comparatively limited  one which a roll would be capable of producing, was bound to be for the  better. He smiled a sickly smile and said that it didn't matter.    The charming creature who sat on his assailant's left, however, took a  more serious view of the situation.    \"Sidney, you make me tired,\" she said severely. \"If I had thought you  didn't know how to act like a gentleman I wouldn't have come here with  you. Go away somewhere and throw bread at yourself, and ask Mr. Bleke to  come and sit by me. I want to talk to him.\"    That was Roland's first introduction to Miss Billy Verepoint.    \"I've been wanting to have a chat with you all the evening, Mr. Bleke,\"  she said, as Roland blushingly sank into the empty chair. \"I've heard  such a lot about you.\"    What Miss Verepoint had heard about Roland was that he had two hundred  thousand pounds and apparently did not know what to do with it.    \"In fact, if I hadn't been told that you would be here, I shouldn't have  come to this party. Can't stand these gatherings of nuts in May as a  general rule. They bore me stiff.\"    Roland hastily revised his first estimate of the theatrical profession.  Shallow, empty-headed creatures some of them might be, no "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8743"],[0,"Mary Schweidler, the amber witch (#5)"],[1,"teach the few little ones there were in the  village; this, however, had long been abandoned. I could not, therefore,  deny her, although I feared that my child would share her bread with her,  seeing that she dearly loved the little maid, who was her godchild; and so  indeed it happened; for when the child saw me take out the bread, she  shrieked for joy, and began to scramble up on the bench. Thus she also got  a piece of the slice, our maid got another, and my child put the third  piece into her own mouth, as I wished for none, but said that I felt no  signs of hunger and would wait until the meat was boiled, the which I now  threw upon the bench. It was a goodly sight to see the joy which my poor  child felt when I then also told her about the rye. She fell upon my neck,  wept, sobbed, then took the little one up in her arms, danced about the  room with her, and recited as she was wont, all manner of Latin _versus_,  which she knew by heart. Then she would prepare a right good supper for  us, as a little salt was still left in the bottom of a barrel of meat  which the Imperialists had broken up. I let her take her own way, and  having scraped some soot from the chimney and mixed it with water, I tore  a blank leaf out of _Virgilius_, and wrote to the _Pastor Liepensis_, his  reverence Abraham Tiburtius, praying that for God his sake he would take  our necessities to heart, and would exhort his parishioners to save us  from dying of grim hunger, and charitably to spare to us some meat and  drink, according as the all-merciful God had still left some to them,  seeing that a beggar had told me that they had long been in peace from  the terrible enemy. I knew not, however, wherewithal to seal the letter,  until I found in the church a little wax still sticking to a wooden  altar-candlestick, which the Imperialists had not thought it worth their  while to steal, for they had only taken the brass ones. I sent three  fellows in a boat with Hinrich Seden, the churchwarden, with this letter  to Liepe.    First, however, I asked my old Ilse, who was born in Liepe, whether she  would not rather return home, seeing how matters stood, and that I, for  the present at least, could not give her a stiver of her wages (mark that  she had already saved up a small sum, seeing that she had lived in my  service above twenty years, but the soldiers had taken it all). Howbeit, I  could nowise persuade her to this, but she wept bitterly, and besought me  only to let her stay with the good damsel whom she had rocked in her  cradle. She would cheerfully hunger with us if it needs must be, so that  she were not turned away. Whereupon I yielded to her, and the others went  alone.    Meanwhile the broth was ready, but scarce had we said the _Gratias_, and  were about to begin our meal, when all the children of the village, seven  in number, came to the door, and wanted bread, as they had heard we had  some from my daughter her little godchild. Her heart again melted, and  notwithstanding I besought her to harden herself against them, she  comforted me with the message to Liepe, and poured out for each child a  portion of broth on a wooden platter (for these also had been despised by  the enemy), and put into their little hands a bit of meat, so that all our  store was eaten up at once. We were, therefore, left fasting next morning,  till towards mid-day, when the whole village gathered together in a meadow  on the banks of the river to see the boat return. But, God be merciful to  us, we had cherished vain hopes! six loaves and a sheep, _item_, a quarter  of apples, was all they had brought. His reverence Abraham Tiburtius wrote  to me that after the cry of their wealth had spread throughout the island,  so many beggars had flocked thither that it was impossible to be just to  all, seeing that they themselves did not know how it might fare with them  in these heavy troublous times. Meanwhile he would see whether he could  raise any more. I therefore with many sighs had the small pittance carried  to the manse, and though two loaves were, as _Pastor Liepensis_ said in  his letter, for me alone, I gave them up to be shared among all alike,  whereat all were content save Seden his squint-eyed wife, who would have  had somewhat _extra_ on the score of her husband's journey, which,  however, as may be easily guessed, she did not get; wherefore she again  muttered certain words between her teeth as she went away, which, however,  no one understood. Truly she was an ill woman, and not to be moved by the  word of God.    Any one may judge for himself that such a store could not last long; and  as all my parishioners felt an ardent longing after spiritual food, and  as I and the churchwardens could only get together about sixteen  farthings in the whole parish, which was not enough to buy bread and  wine, the thought struck me once more to inform my lord the Sheriff of  our need. With how heavy a heart I did this may be easily guessed, but  necessity knows no law. I therefore tore the last blank leaf out of  _Virgilius_, and begged that, for the sake of the Holy Trinity, his  lordship would mercifully consider mine own distress and that of the  whole parish, and bestow a little money to enable me to administer the  holy sacrament for the comfort of afflicted souls; also, if possible,  to buy a cup, were it only of tin, since the enemy had plundered us of  ours, and I should otherwise be forced to consecrate the sacred elements  in an earthen vessel. _Item_, I besought him to have pity on our bodily  wants, and at last to send me the first-fruits which had stood over for  so many years. That I did not want it for myself alone, but would  willingly share it with my parishioners, until such time as God in his  mercy should give us more.    Here a huge blot fell upon my paper; for the windows being boarded up, the  room was dark, and but little light came through two small panes of glass  which I had broken out of the church, and stuck in between the boards;  this, perhaps, was the reason why I did not see better. However, as I  could not anywhere get another piece of paper, I let it pass, and ordered  the maid, whom I sent with the letter to Pudgla, to excuse the same to his  lordship the Sheriff, the which she promised to do, seeing that I could  not add a word more on the paper, as it was written all over. I then  sealed it as I had done before.    But the poor creature came back trembling for fear and bitterly weeping,  and said that his lordship had kicked her out of the castle-gate, and had  threatened to set her in the stocks if she ever came before him again.  \"Did the parson think that he was as free with his money as I seemed to be  with my ink? I surely had water enough to celebrate the Lord's supper  wherewithal. For if the Son of God had once changed the water into wine,  he could surely do the like again. If I had no cup, I might water my flock  out of a bucket, as he did himself\"; with many more blasphemies, such as  he afterwards wrote to me, and by which, as may easily be guessed, I was  filled with horror. Touching the first-fruits, as she told me he said  nothing at all. In such great spiritual and bodily need the blessed Sunday  came round, when nearly all the congregation would have come to the Lord's  table, but could not. I therefore spoke on the words of St. Augustine,  _crede et manducasti_, and represented that the blame was not mine, and  truly told what had happened to my poor maid at Pudgla, passing over much  in silence, and only praying God to awaken the hearts of magistrates for  our good. Peradventure I may have spoken more harshly than I meant. I know  not, only that I spoke that which was in my heart. At the end I made all  the congregation stay on their knees for nearly an hour, and call upon the  Lord for his holy sacrament; _item_, for the relief of their bodily wants,  as had been done every Sunday, and at all the daily prayers I had been  used to read ever since the heavy time of the plague. Last of all I led  the glorious hymn, \"When in greatest need we be,\" which was no sooner  finished than my new churchwarden, Claus Bulk of Uekeritze, who had  formerly been a groom with his lordship, and whom he had now put into a  farm, ran off to Pudgla, and told him all that had taken place in the  church. Whereat his lordship was greatly angered, insomuch that he  summoned the whole parish, which still numbered about 150 souls, without  counting the children, and dictated _ad protocollum_ whatsoever they could  remember of the sermon, seeing that he meant to inform his princely grace  the Duke of Pomerania of the blasphemous lies which I had vomited against  him, and which must sorely offend every Christian heart. _Item_, what an  avaricious wretch I must be to be always wanting something of him, and to  be daily, so to say, pestering him in these hard times with my filthy  letters, when he had not enough to eat himself. This he said should break  the parson his neck, since his princely grace did all that he asked of  him, and that no one in the parish need give me anything more, but only  let me go my ways. He would soon take care that they should have quite a  different sort of parson from what I was.    (Now I would like to see the man who could make up his mind to come into  the midst of such wretchedness at all.)    This news was brought to me in the selfsame night, and gave me a great  fright, as I now saw that I should not have a gracious master in his  lordship, but should all the time of my miserable life, even if I could  anyhow support it, find in him an ungracious lord. But I soon felt some  comfort, when Chim Krueger from Uekeritze, who brought me the news, took a  little bit of his sucking-pig out of his pocket and gave it to me.  Meanwhile old Paasch came in and said the same, and likewise brought me a  piece of his old cow; _item_, my other warden, Hinrich Seden, with a slice  of bread, and a fish"]]]
