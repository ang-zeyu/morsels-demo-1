Then, one day, this kid Bergenholm  ambles into their shop--big, awkward, stumbling over his own feet. He  gazes innocently at the thing for a couple of minutes, then says:    \"'Why don't you use uranium instead of iron and rewind it so it will  put out a wave-form like this, with humps here, and here; instead of  there, and there?' and he draws a couple of free-hand, but really  beautiful curves.    \"'Why should we?' they squawk at him.    \"'Because it will work that way,' he says, and ambles out as  unconcernedly as he came in. Can't--or won't--say another word.    \"Well in sheer desperation, they tried it--and it WORKED! And nobody  has ever had a minute's trouble with a Bergenholm since. That's why  Rodebush and Cleveland both insisted on the name.\"    \"I see; and it points up what I just said. But if he's such a mental  giant, why isn't he getting results with his own problem, the meteor?  Or is he?\"    \"No ... or at least he wasn't as of last night. But there's a note on  my pad that he wants to see me sometime today--suppose we have him come  in now?\"    \"Fine! I'd like to talk to him, if it's O.K. with you and with him.\"    The young scientist was called in, and was introduced to the  Commissioner.    \"Go ahead, Doctor Bergenholm,\" Samms suggested then. \"You may talk to  both of us, just as freely as though you and I were alone.\"    \"I have, as you already know, been called psychic,\" Bergenholm began,  abruptly. \"It is said that I dream dreams, see visions, hear voices,  and so on. That I operate on hunches. That I am a genius. Now I very  definitely am _not_ a genius--unless my understanding of the meaning of  that word is different from that of the rest of mankind.\"    Bergenholm paused. Samms and Kinnison looked at each other. The latter  broke the short silence.    \"The Councillor and I have just been discussing the fact that there  are a great many things we do not know; that with the extension of our  activities into new fields, the occurrence of the impossible has become  almost a commonplace. We are able, I believe, to listen with open minds  to anything you have to say.\"    \"Very well. But first, please know that I am a scientist. As such, I  am trained to observe; to think calmly, clearly, and analytically;  to test every hypothesis. I do not believe at all in the so-called  supernatural. This universe did not come into being, it does not  continue to be, except by the operation of natural and immutable laws.  And I mean _immutable_, gentlemen. Everything that has ever happened,  that is happening now, or that ever is to happen, was, is, and will  be statistically connected with its predecessor event and with its  successor event. If I did not believe that implicitly, I would lose  all faith in the scientific method. For if one single 'supernatural'  event or thing had ever occurred or existed it would have constituted  an entirely unpredictable event and would have initiated a series--a  succession--of such events; a state of things which no scientist will  or can believe possible in an orderly universe.    \"At the same time, I recognize the fact that I myself have done  things--caused events to occur, if you prefer--that I cannot explain to  you or to any other human being in any symbology known to our science;  and it is about an even more inexplicable--call it 'hunch' if you  like--that I asked to have a talk with you today.\"    \"But you are arguing in circles,\" Samms protested. \"Or are you trying  to set up a paradox?\"    \"Neither. I am merely clearing the way for a somewhat startling thing I  am to say later on. You know, of course, that any situation with which  a mind is unable to cope; a really serious dilemma which it cannot  resolve; will destroy that mind--frustration, escape from reality, and  so on. You also will realize that I must have become cognizant of my  own peculiarities long before anyone else did or could?\"    \"Ah. I see. Yes, of course.\" Samms, intensely interested, leaned  forward. \"Yet your present personality is adequately, splendidly  integrated. How could you possibly have overcome--reconciled--a  situation so full of conflict?\"    \"You are, I think, familiar with my parentage?\" Samms, keen as he was,  did not consider it noteworthy that the big Norwegian answered his  question only by asking one of his own.    \"Yes ... oh, I'm beginning to see ... but Commissioner Kinnison has not  had access to your dossier. Go ahead.\"    \"My father is Dr. Hjalmar Bergenholm. My mother, before her marriage,  was Dr. Olga Bjornson. Both were, and are, nuclear physicists--very  good ones. Pioneers, they have been called. They worked, and are still  working, in the newest, outermost fringes of the field.\"    \"Oh!\" Kinnison exclaimed. \"A mutant? Born with second sight--or  whatever it is?\"    \"Not second sight, as history describes the phenomenon, no. The  records do not show that any such faculty was ever demonstrated to the  satisfaction of any competent scientific investigator. What I have is  something else. Whether or not it will breed true is an interesting  topic of speculation, but one having nothing to do with the problem now  in hand. To return to the subject, I resolved my dilemma long since.  There is, I am absolutely certain, a science of the mind which is as  definite, as positive, as immutable of law, as is the science of the  physical. While I will make no attempt to prove it to you, I _know_  that such a science exists, and that I was born with the ability to  perceive at least some elements of it.    \"Now to the matter of the meteor of the Patrol. That emblem was and is  purely physical. The pirates have just as able scientists as we have.  What physical science can devise and synthesize, physical science can  analyze and duplicate. There is a point, however, beyond which physical  science cannot go. It can neither analyze nor imitate the tangible  products of that which I have so loosely called the science of the mind.    \"I know, Councillor Samms, what the Triplanetary Service needs;  something vastly more than its meteor. I also know that the need will  become greater and greater as the sphere of action of the Patrol  expands. Without a really efficient symbol, the Solarian Patrol will  be hampered even more than the Triplanetary Service; and its logical  extension into the Space Patrol, or whatever that larger organization  may be called, will be definitely impossible. We need something which  will identify any representative of Civilization, positively and  unmistakably, wherever he may be. It must be impossible of duplication,  or even of imitation, to which end it must kill any unauthorized entity  who attempts imposture. It must operate as a telepath between its owner  and any other living intelligence, of however high or low degree, so  that mental communication, so much clearer and faster than physical,  will be possible without the laborious learning of language; or between  us and such peoples as those of Rigel Four or of Palain Seven, both  of whom we know to be of high intelligence and who must already be  conversant with telepathy.\"    \"Are you or have you been, reading my mind?\" Samms asked quietly.    \"No,\" Bergenholm replied flatly. \"It is not and has not been necessary.  Any man who can think, who has really considered the question, and  who has the good of Civilization at heart, must have come to the same  conclusions.\"    \"Probably so, at that. But no more side issues. You have a solution of  some kind worked out, or you would not be here. What is it?\"    \"It is that you, Solarian Councillor Samms, should go to Arisia as soon  as possible.\"    \"Arisia!\" Samms exclaimed, and:    \"Arisia! Of all the hells in space, why Arisia? And how can we make the  approach? Don't you know that _nobody_ can get anywhere near that damn  planet?\"    Bergenholm shrugged his shoulders and spread both arms wide in a  pantomime of complete helplessness.    \"How do you know--another of your hunches?\" Kinnison went on. \"Or did  somebody tell you something? _Where_ did you get it?\"    \"It is not a hunch,\" the Norwegian replied, positively. \"No one told me  anything. But I _know_--as definitely as I know that the combustion of  hydrogen in oxygen will yield water--that the Arisians are very well  versed in that which I have called the science of the mind; that if  Virgil Samms goes to Arisia he will obtain the symbol he needs; that he  will never obtain it otherwise. As to _how_ I know these things ... I  can't ... I just ... I _know_ it, I tell you!\"    Without another word, without asking permission to leave, Bergenholm  whirled around and hurried out. Samms and Kinnison stared at each other.    \"Well?\" Kinnison asked, quizzically.    \"I'm going. Now. Whether I can be spared or not, and whether you think  I'm out of control or not. I believe him, every word--and besides,  there's the Bergenholm. How about you? Coming?\"    \"Yes. Can't say that I'm sold one hundred percent; but, as you say, the  Bergenholm is a hard fact to shrug off. And at minimum rating, it's got  to be tried. What are you taking? Not a fleet, probably--the _Boise_?  Or the _Chicago_?\" It was the Commissioner of Public Safety speaking  now, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. \"The _Chicago_, I'd  say--the fastest and strongest thing in space.\"    \"Recommendation approved. Blast-off; twelve hundred hours tomorrow!\"          CHAPTER 3      The superdreadnought _Chicago_, as she approached the imaginary but  nevertheless sharply defined boundary, which no other ship had been  allowed to pass, went inert and crept forward, mile by mile. Every  man, from Commissioner and Councillor down, was taut and tense. So  widely variant, so utterly fantastic, were the stories going around  about this Arisia that no one knew what to expect."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4962"],[0,"The Story of Germ Life (#5)"],[1,"may be so short as to appear like a spherical organism.    With all these reasons for confusion, it is not to be wondered at  that no satisfactory classification of bacteria has been reached,  or that different bacteriologists do not agree as to what  constitutes a species, or whether two forms are identical or not.  But with all the confusion there is slowly being obtained  something like system. In spite of the fact that species may vary  and show different properties under different conditions, the  fundamental constancy of species is everywhere recognised to-day  as a fact. The members of the same species may show different  properties under different conditions, but it is believed that  under identical conditions the properties will be constant. It is  no more possible to convert one species into another than it is  among the higher orders of plants. It is believed that bacteria do  form a group of plants by themselves, and are not to be regarded  as stages in the history of higher plants. It is believed that,  together with a considerable amount of variability and an  occasional somewhat long life history with successive stages,  there is also an essential constancy. A systematic classification  has been made which is becoming more or less satisfactory. We are  constantly learning more and more of the characters, so that they  can be recognised in different places by different observers. It  is the conviction of all who work with bacteria that, in spite of  the difficulties, it is only a matter of time when we shall have a  classification and description of bacteria so complete as to  characterize the different species accurately.    Even with our present incomplete knowledge of what characterizes a  species, it is necessary to use some names. Bacteria are commonly  given a generic name based upon their microscopic appearance.  There are only a few of these names. Micrococcus, Streptococcus,  Staphylococcus, Sarcina, Bacterium, Bacillus, Spirillum, are all  the names in common use applying to the ordinary bacteria. There  are a few others less commonly used. To this generic name a  specific name is commonly added, based upon some physiological  character. For example, Bacillus typhosus is the name given to the  bacillus which causes typhoid fever. Such names are of great use  when the species is a common and well-known one, but of doubtful  value for less-known species It frequently happens that a  bacteriologist makes a study of the bacteria found in a certain  locality, and obtains thus a long list of species hitherto  unknown. In these cases it is common simply to number these  species rather than name them. This method is frequently  advisable, since the bacteriologist can seldom hunt up all  bacteriological literature with sufficient accuracy to determine  whether some other bacteriologist may not have found the same  species in an entirely different locality. One bacteriologist, for  example, finds some seventy different species of bacteria in  different cheeses. He studies them enough for his own purposes,  but not sufficiently to determine whether some other person may  not have found the same species perhaps in milk or water. He  therefore simply numbers them--a method which conveys no suggestion  as to whether they may be new species or not. This method avoids  the giving of separate names to the same species found by  different observers, and it is hoped that gradually accumulating  knowledge will in time group together the forms which are really  identical, but which have been described by different observers.    WHERE BACTERIA ARE FOUND.    There are no other plants or animals so universally found in  Nature as the bacteria. It is this universal presence, together  with their great powers of multiplication, which renders them of  so much importance in Nature. They exist almost everywhere on the  surface of the earth. They are in the soil, especially at its  surface. They do not extend to very great depths of soil, however,  few existing below four feet of soil. At the surface they are very  abundant, especially if the soil is moist and full of organic  material. The number may range from a few hundred to one hundred  millions per gramme. [Footnote: One gramme is fifteen grains.] The  soil bacteria vary also in species, some two-score different  species having been described as common in soil. They are in all  bodies of water, both at the surface and below it. They are found  at considerable depths in the ocean. All bodies of fresh water  contain them, and all sediments in such bodies of water are filled  with bacteria. They are in streams of running water in even  greater quantity than in standing water. This is simply because  running streams are being constantly supplied with water which has  been washing the surface of the country and thus carrying off all  surface accumulations. Lakes or reservoirs, however, by standing  quiet allow the bacteria to settle to the bottom, and the water  thus gets somewhat purified. They are in the air, especially in  regions of habitation. Their numbers are greatest near the surface  of the ground, and decrease in the upper strata of air. Anything  which tends to raise dust increases the number of bacteria in the  air greatly, and the dust and emanations from the clothes of  people crowded in a close room fill the air with bacteria in very  great numbers. They are found in excessive abundance in every bit  of decaying matter wherever it may be. Manure heaps, dead bodies  of animals, decaying trees, filth and slime and muck everywhere  are filled with them, for it is in such places that they find  their best nourishment. The bodies of animals contain them in the  mouth, stomach, and intestine in great numbers, and this is, of  course, equally true of man. On the surface of the body they cling  in great quantity; attached to the clothes, under the finger  nails, among the hairs, in every possible crevice or hiding place  in the skin, and in all secretions. They do not, however, occur in  the tissues of a healthy individual, either in the blood, muscle,  gland, or any other organ. Secretions, such as milk, urine, etc.,  always contain them, however, since the bacteria do exist in the  ducts of the glands which conduct the secretions to the exterior,  and thus, while the bacteria are never in the healthy gland  itself, they always succeed in contaminating the secretion as it  passes to the exterior. Not only higher animals, but the lower  animals also have their bodies more or less covered with bacteria.  Flies have them on their feet, bees among their hairs, etc.    In short, wherever on the face of Nature there is a lodging place  for dust there will be found bacteria. In most of these localities  they are dormant, or at least growing only a little. The bacteria  clinging to the dry hair can grow but little, if at all, and those  in pure water multiply very little. When dried as dust they are  entirely dormant. But each individual bacterium or spore has the  potential power of multiplication already noticed, and as soon as  it by accident falls upon a place where there is food and moisture  it will begin to multiply. Everywhere in Nature, then, exists this  group of organisms with its almost inconceivable power of  multiplication, but a power held in check by lack of food. Furnish  them with food and their potential powers become actual. Such food  is provided by the dead bodies of animals or plants, or by animal  secretions, or from various other sources. The bacteria which are  fortunate enough to get furnished with such food material continue  to feed upon it until the food supply is exhausted or their growth  is checked in some other way. They may be regarded, therefore, as  a constant and universal power usually held in check. With their  universal presence and their powers of producing chemical changes  in food material, they are ever ready to produce changes in the  face of Nature, and to these changes we will now turn.            CHAPTER II.    MISCELLANEOUS USE OF BACTERIA IN THE ARTS.      The foods upon which bacteria live are in endless variety, almost  every product of animal or vegetable life serving to supply their  needs. Some species appear to require somewhat definite kinds of  food, and have therefore rather narrow conditions of life, but the  majority may live upon a great variety of organic compounds. As  they consume the material which serves them as food they produce  chemical changes therein. These changes are largely of a nature  that the chemist knows as decomposition changes. By this is meant  that the bacteria, seizing hold of ingredients which constitute  their food, break them to pieces chemically. The molecule of the  original food matter is split into simpler molecules, and the food  is thus changed in its chemical nature. As a result, the compounds  which appear in the decomposing solution are commonly simpler than  the original food molecules. Such products are in general called  decomposition products, or sometimes cleavage products. Sometimes,  however, the bacteria have, in addition to their power of pulling  their food to pieces, a further power of building other compounds  out of the fragments, thus building up as well as pulling down.  But, however they do it, bacteria when growing in any food  material have the power of giving rise to numerous products which  did not exist in the food mass before. Because of their  extraordinary powers of reproduction they are capable of producing  these changes very rapidly and can give rise in a short time to  large amounts of the peculiar products of their growth.    It is to these powers of producing chemical changes in their food  that bacteria owe all their importance in the world. Their power  of chemically destroying the food products is in itself of no  little importance, but the products which arise as the result of  this series of chemical changes are of an importance"]]]
