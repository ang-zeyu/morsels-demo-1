To properly understand the condition of things preceding the great war  of the Rebellion, and the causes underlying that condition and the war  itself, we must glance backward through the history of the Country to,  and even beyond, that memorable 30th of November, 1782, when the  Independence of the United States of America was at last conceded by  Great Britain.  At that time the population of the United States was  about 2,500,000 free whites and some 500,000 black slaves.  We had  gained our Independence of the Mother Country, but she had left fastened  upon us the curse of Slavery.  Indeed African Slavery had already in  1620 been implanted on the soil of Virginia before Plymouth Rock was  pressed by the feet of the Pilgrim Fathers, and had spread, prior to the  Revolution, with greater or less rapidity, according to the surrounding  adaptations of soil, production and climate, to every one of the  thirteen Colonies.    But while it had thus spread more or less throughout all the original  Colonies, and was, as it were, recognized and acquiesced in by all, as  an existing and established institution, yet there were many, both in  the South and North, who looked upon it as an evil--an inherited evil  --and were anxious to prevent the increase of that evil.  Hence it was  that even as far back as 1699, a controversy sprang up between the  Colonies and the Home Government, upon the African Slavery question  --a controversy continuing with more or less vehemence down to the  Declaration of Independence itself.    It was this conviction that it was not alone an evil but a dangerous  evil, that induced Jefferson to embody in his original draft of that  Declaration a clause strongly condemnatory of the African Slave Trade--a  clause afterward omitted from it solely, he tells us, \"in complaisance  to South Carolina and Georgia, who had never* attempted to restrain the  importation of slaves, and who, on the contrary, still wished to  continue it,\" as well as in deference to the sensitiveness of Northern  people, who, though having few slaves themselves, \"had been pretty  considerable carriers of them to others\" a clause of the great  indictment of King George III., which, since it was not omitted for any  other reason than that just given, shows pretty conclusively that where  the fathers in that Declaration affirmed that \"all men are created  equal,\" they included in the term \"men,\" black as well as white, bond as  well as free; for the clause ran thus: \"Determined to keep open a market  where MEN should be bought and sold, he has prostituted his negative for  suppressing every Legislative attempt to prohibit or to restrain this  execrable commerce.  And that this assemblage of horrors might want no  fact of distinguished dye, he is now exciting those very people to rise  in arms among us, and purchase that liberty of which he has deprived  them, by murdering the people on whom he also obtruded them; thus paying  of former crimes committed against the LIBERTIES of our people with  crimes which he urges them to commit against the LIVES of another.\"         [Prior to 1752, when Georgia surrendered her charter and became a       Royal Colony, the holding of slaves within its limits was expressly       prohibited by law; and the Darien (Ga.) resolutions of 1775       declared not only a \"disapprobation and abhorrence of the unnatural       practice of Slavery in America\" as \"a practice founded in injustice       and cruelty, and highly dangerous to our Liberties (as well as       lives) but a determination to use our utmost efforts for the       manumission of our slaves in this colony upon the most safe and       equitable footing for the masters and themselves.\"]      During the war of the Revolution following the Declaration of  Independence, the half a million of slaves, nearly all of them in the  Southern States, were found to be not only a source of weakness, but,  through the incitements of British emissaries, a standing menace of  peril to the Slaveholders.  Thus it was that the South was overrun by  hostile British armies, while in the North-comparatively free of this  element of weakness--disaster after disaster met them.  At last,  however, in 1782, came the recognition of our Independence, and peace,  followed by the evacuation of New York at the close of 1783.    The lessons of the war, touching Slavery, had not been lost upon our  statesmen.  Early in 1784 Virginia ceded to the United States her claims  of jurisdiction and otherwise over the vast territory north-west of the  Ohio; and upon its acceptance, Jefferson, as chairman of a Select  Committee appointed at his instance to consider a plan of government  therefor, reported to the ninth Continental Congress an Ordinance to  govern the territory ceded already, or to be ceded, by individual States  to the United States, extending from the 31st to the 47th degree of  north latitude, which provided as \"fundamental conditions between the  thirteen original States and those newly described\" as embryo States  thereafter--to be carved out of such territory ceded or to be ceded to  the United States, not only that \"they shall forever remain a part of  the United States of America,\" but also that \"after the year 1800 of the  Christian era, there shall be neither Slavery nor involuntary servitude  in any of the said States\"--and that those fundamental conditions were  \"unalterable but by the joint consent of the United States in Congress  assembled, and of the particular State within which such alteration  is proposed to be made.\"    But now a signal misfortune befell.  Upon a motion to strike out the  clause prohibiting Slavery, six States: New Hampshire, Massachusetts,  Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York and Pennsylvania, voted to retain  the prohibitive clause, while three States, Maryland, Virginia and South  Carolina, voted not to retain it.  The vote of North Carolina was  equally divided; and while one of the Delegates from New Jersey voted to  retain it, yet as there was no other delegate present from that State,  and the Articles of Confederation required the presence of \"two or more\"  delegates to cast the vote of a State, the vote of New Jersey was lost;  and, as the same Articles required an affirmative vote of a majority of  all the States--and not simply of those present--the retention of the  clause prohibiting Slavery was also lost.  Thus was lost the great  opportunity of restricting Slavery to the then existing Slave States,  and of settling the question peaceably for all time.  Three years  afterward a similar Ordinance, since become famous as \"the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7144"],[0,"While the Billy Boils (#5)"],[1," I didn't  travel with him long after that. He was a decent young fellow as far as  chaps go, and a good mate as far as mates go; but he was too far ahead  for a peaceful, easy-going chap like me. It would have worn me out in a  year to keep up to him.    P.S.--The name of this should have been:  'Bill and Stiffner (thirdly, Jim)'          WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN      Jack Drew sat on the edge of the shaft, with his foot in the loop and  one hand on the rope, ready to descend. His elder brother, Tom, stood  at one end of the windlass and the third mate at the other. Jack paused  before swinging off, looked up at his brother, and impulsively held out  his hand:    \"You ain't going to let the sun go down, are you, Tom?\"    But Tom kept both hands on the windlass-handle and said nothing.    \"Lower away!\"    They lowered him to the bottom, and Tom shouldered his pick in silence  and walked off to the tent. He found the tin plate, pint-pot, and things  set ready for him on the rough slab table under the bush shed. The tea  was made, the cabbage and potatoes strained and placed in a billy near  the fire. He found the fried bacon and steak between two plates in the  camp-oven. He sat down to the table but he could not eat. He felt mean.  The inexperience and hasty temper of his brother had caused the quarrel  between them that morning; but then Jack admitted that, and apologized  when he first tried to make it up.    Tom moved round uneasily and tried to smoke: he could not get Jack's  last appeal out of his ears--\"You ain't going to let the sun go down,  Tom?\"    Tom found himself glancing at the sun. It was less than two hours from  sunset. He thought of the words of the old Hebrew--or Chinese--poet; he  wasn't religious, and the authorship didn't matter. The old poet's words  began to haunt him \"Let not the sun go down upon your wrath--Let not the  sun go down upon your wrath.\"    The line contains good, sound advice; for quick-tempered men are often  the most sensitive, and when they let the sun go down on the aforesaid  wrath that quality is likely to get them down and worry them during the  night.    Tom started to go to the claim, but checked himself, and sat down  and tried to draw comfort from his pipe. He understood his brother  thoroughly, but his brother never understood him--that was where the  trouble was. Presently he got thinking how Jack would worry about the  quarrel and have no heart for his work. Perhaps he was fretting over it  now, all alone by himself, down at the end of the damp, dark drive. Tom  had a lot of the old woman about him, in spite of his unsociable ways  and brooding temper.    He had almost made up his mind to go below again, on some excuse, when  his mate shouted from the top of the shaft:    \"Tom! Tom! For Christ's sake come here!\"    Tom's heart gave a great thump, and he ran like a kangaroo to the shaft.  All the diggers within hearing were soon on the spot. They saw at a  glance what had happened. It was madness to sink without timber in such  treacherous ground. _The sides of the shaft were closing in_. Tom sprang  forward and shouted through the crevice:    \"To the face, Jack! To the face, for your life!\"    \"The old Workings!\" he cried, turning to the diggers. \"Bring a fan and  tools. We'll dig him out.\"    A few minutes later a fan was rigged over a deserted shaft close by,  where fortunately the windlass had been left for bailing purposes,  and men were down in the old drive. Tom knew that he and his mates had  driven very close to the old workings.    He knelt in the damp clay before the face and worked like a madman; he  refused to take turn about, and only dropped the pick to seize a shovel  in his strong hands, and snatch back the loose clay from under his feet;  he reckoned that he had six or, perhaps, eight feet to drive, and he  knew that the air could not last long in the new drive--even if that  had not already fallen in and crushed his brother. Great drops of  perspiration stood out on Tom's forehead, and his breath began to come  in choking sobs, but he still struck strong, savage blows into the clay  before him, and the drive lengthened quickly. Once he paused a moment  to listen, and then distinctly heard a sound as of a tool or stone being  struck against the end of the new drive. Jack was safe!    Tom dug on until the clay suddenly fell away from his pick and left a  hole, about the size of a plate, in the \"face\" before him. \"Thank God!\"  said a hoarse, strained voice at the other side.    \"All right, Jack!\"    \"Yes, old man; you are just in time; I've hardly got room to stand in,  and I'm nearly smothered.\" He was crouching against the \"face\" of the  new drive.    Tom dropped his pick and fell back against the man behind him.    \"Oh, God! my back!\" he cried.    Suddenly he struggled to his knees, and then fell forward on his hand  and dragged himself close to the hole in the end of the drive.    \"Jack!\" he gasped, \"Jack!\"    \"Right, old man; what's the matter?\"    \"I've hurt my heart, Jack!--Put your hand--quick!... The sun's going  down.\"    Jack's hand came out through the hole, Tom gripped it, and then fell  with his face in the damp clay.    They half carried, half dragged him from the drive, for the roof was low  and they were obliged to stoop. They took him to the shaft and sent him  up, lashed to the rope.    A few blows of the pick, and Jack scrambled from his prison and went  to the surface, and knelt on the grass by the body of his brother. The  diggers gathered round and took off their hats. And the sun went down.        THE MAN WHO FORGOT      \"Well, I dunno,\" said Tom Marshall--known as \"The Oracle\"--\"I've heerd  o' sich cases before: they ain't commin, but--I've heerd o' sich  cases before,\" and he screwed up the left side of his face whilst he  reflectively scraped his capacious right ear with the large blade of a  pocket-knife.    They were sitting at the western end of the rouseabouts' hut, enjoying  the breeze that came up when the sun went down, and smoking and yarning.  The \"case\" in question was a wretchedly forlorn-looking specimen of the  swag-carrying clan whom a boundary-rider had found wandering about  the adjacent plain, and had brought into the station. He was a small,  scraggy man, painfully fair, with a big, baby-like head, vacant watery  eyes, long thin hairy hands, that felt like pieces of damp seaweed, and  an apologetic cringe-and-look-up-at-you manner. He professed to have  forgotten who he was and all about himself.    The Oracle was deeply interested in this case, as indeed he was in  anything else that \"looked curious.\" He was a big, simple-minded  shearer, with more heart than brains, more experience than sense, and  more curiosity than either. It was a wonder that he had not profited,  even indirectly, by the last characteristic. His heart was filled with  a kind of reverential pity for anyone who was fortunate or unfortunate  enough to possess an \"affliction;\" and amongst his mates had been  counted a deaf man, a blind man, a poet, and a man who \"had rats.\" Tom  had dropped across them individually, when they were down in the  world, and had befriended them, and studied them with great  interest--especially the poet; and they thought kindly of him, and were  grateful--except the individual with the rats, who reckoned Tom had an  axe to grind--that he, in fact, wanted to cut his (Rat's) liver out as a  bait for Darling cod--and so renounced the mateship.    It was natural, then, for The Oracle to take the present case under his  wing. He used his influence with the boss to get the Mystery on \"picking  up,\" and studied him in spare time, and did his best to assist the poor  hushed memory, which nothing the men could say or do seemed able to push  further back than the day on which the stranger \"kind o' woke up\" on  the plain, and found a swag beside him. The swag had been prospected  and fossicked for a clue, but yielded none. The chaps were sceptical at  first, and inclined to make fun of the Mystery; but Tom interfered, and  intimated that if they were skunks enough to chyack or try on any of  their \"funny business\" with a \"pore afflicted chap,\" he (Tom) would  be obliged to \"perform.\" Most of the men there had witnessed Tom's  performance, and no one seemed ambitious to take a leading part in it.  They preferred to be in the audience.    \"Yes,\" reflected The Oracle, \"it's a curious case, and I dare say some  of them big doctors, like Morell Mackenzie, would be glad to give a  thousand or two to get holt on a case like this.\"    \"Done,\" cried Mitchell, the goat of the shed. \"I'll go halves!--or stay,  let's form a syndicate and work the Mystery.\"    Some of the rouseabouts laughed, but the joke fell as flat with Tom as  any other joke.    \"The worst of it is,\" said the Mystery himself, in the whine that was  natural to him, and with a timid side look up at Tom--\"the worst of it  is I might be a lord or duke, and don't know anything about it. I might  be a rich man, with a lot of houses and money. I might be a lord.\"    The chaps guffawed.    \"Wot'yer laughing at?\" asked Mitchell. \"I don't see anything  unreasonable about it; he might be a lord as far as looks go. I've seen  two.\"    \"Yes,\" reflected Tom, ignoring Mitchell, \"there's something in that; but  then again, you see, you might be Jack the Ripper. Better let it slide,  mate; let the dead past bury its dead. Start fresh with a clean sheet.\"    \"But I don't even know my name, or whether I'm married or not,\" whined  the outcast. \"I might have a good wife and little ones.\"    \"Better keep on forgetting, mate,\" Mitchell said, \"and as for a name,  that's nothing. I don't know mine, and I've had eight. There's plenty  good names knocking round. I knew a man named Jim Smith that died. Take  his name, it just suits you, and he ain't likely to call round for it;  if he does, you can say you was born with it.\"    So they called him Smith, and soon began to regard him "]]]
