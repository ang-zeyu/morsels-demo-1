The initial phase envisaged footholds in the southern and central  Philippines for the establishment of bases and airfields from which  subsequent operations could be supported. The first operation, planned  for 1 November 1944, was to be the seizure of the Sarangani Bay area  in southern Mindanao for the purpose of establishing land-based air  forces to augment the carrier-based air support for the advance into  Leyte. The Leyte operation, the main effort of this series, was to  come on 22 November. Major air, naval, and logistic bases were to  be constructed on the shores of Leyte Gulf for the control of Leyte,  Samar, and Surigao Strait, and for the neutralization of the Japanese  aerial strength on Luzon. [24] The other phases covered the occupation  of Luzon and the consolidation of the Philippines.    On 26 July the Joint Chiefs agreed that the primary purpose of the  occupation of the Leyte-Mindanao area was to establish air forces  there in order to reduce the enemy air strength on Luzon. Some of  Admiral Nimitz' assault craft which were suitable for shore-to-shore  operations were to be transferred to General MacArthur. The Joint  Chiefs, therefore, asked their planners to submit their views on the  possibility of advancing the target date for Leyte to 15 November by  compressing the intervals between contemplated operations or by the  elimination of certain scheduled operations. [25]    In furtherance of this directive, planning officers from Washington  met with General MacArthur and his staff in Brisbane in the early  part of August and discussed means of accelerating the target date  for Leyte. General MacArthur told them that a substantial interval  between the operations at Sarangani Bay and Leyte was necessary. His  reasons were as follows: (1) the assault shipping that was used for the  Sarangani Bay operation would have time to turn around, reload, and  then be used for the Leyte operation; (2) in the interval six combat  air groups could be installed in the Sarangani Bay area to support  the Leyte operation; and (3) the carriers would have sufficient time  to execute two strikes before the Leyte operation. [26]    The planners from Washington, however, felt that there was  sufficient assault shipping in the Pacific without using the same  craft for both the Sarangani Bay and the Leyte operations. An  enumeration of the vessels assigned to the Southwest Pacific and  the Central Pacific gave the areas more than a six-division lift. As  Brig. Gen. Frank N. Roberts, chief of the Strategy and Policy Group,  Operations Division, War Department General Staff, in Washington,  told Col. William L. Ritchie, his deputy, who was in Brisbane,  \"If you sit down and look at those figures a bit you will see that  there should be sufficient assault lift for Leyte just on playing  the numbers racket, without touching the shipping on Sarangani.\" [27]    Both Washington and Brisbane recognized that the operations in the  Leyte-Surigao area were necessary in order to provide air bases, depot  areas, and a fleet anchorage for any future advance whether in the  Philippines, against Formosa, or by a direct route into the Japanese  homeland. Consequently, the planners never seriously entertained any  idea of bypassing this area, although they continued to probe for  means which would accelerate the target date.    The determination of the target date was dependent upon the  availability of assault shipping and the desire of General MacArthur  to have each successive advance supported by land-based aircraft. The  existing shipping was needed for operations already scheduled. The  planners concluded that additional shipping could be made available  if certain phases of the campaigns of Central Pacific forces into  the Palaus, scheduled to start on 15 September, were canceled or  set ahead of schedule. The alternatives were to modify the concept  of providing land-based air support for subsequent operations or to  execute the Sarangani Bay and Leyte operations simultaneously. [28]  There the matter rested. Apparently the Joint Chiefs had decided that  the time was not opportune for an acceleration of the target dates.    On 27 August General MacArthur furnished General Marshall a timetable  for future operations by his forces. On 15 September a division and  a reinforced regiment were to seize Morotai in order \"to protect  the western flank\" and to provide land-based aircraft for advances  northward. On 15 October a division less one regimental combat team  was to land in the Talaud Islands northwest of Morotai in order \"to  neutralize the [Japanese] western flank,\" to establish air bases  from which the neutralization of Mindanao and the western Visayan  Islands could be accomplished, and to set up a base for airborne  troops. On 15 November two divisions were to land in the Sarangani  Bay area in order to construct bases for land-based aircraft that  were to support the Leyte operation. On 7 December a regimental  combat team and a parachute battalion were to drop on Mindanao and  establish an airfield for fighter cover for the aerial neutralization  of the western Visayan Islands and southern Luzon. On 20 December  five divisions were to land on Leyte for the purpose of providing  \"major air and logistic bases for operations to the northward.\" The  plan was predicated on the assumption that there would be available  in the Pacific sufficient amphibious lift and fleet support. [29]          Plans Agreed Upon    On 1 September 1944 the Joint Chiefs of Staff in their 171st meeting  reviewed the situation in the Pacific. The time had come when it  was necessary to issue a directive for future operations in that  area. After much discussion, the Joint Chiefs left in abeyance the  question of what operation should follow Leyte but \"directed the Joint  Staff Planners to prepare, as a matter of urgency, a directive to the  Commander in Chief, Southwest Pacific Area, and the Commander in Chief,  Pacific Ocean Areas, to carry out the Leyte operation.\" [30]    Accordingly, on 8 September, the two commanders were given the  following missions: General MacArthur, after conducting the necessary  preliminary operations, was to take the Leyte-Surigao area on 20  December, with Admiral Nimitz furnishing fleet support and additional  assault shipping. Both commanders were to arrange for co-ordination  of plans and mutual support of operations; to co-ordinate plans with  General Joseph W. Stilwell, Commanding General, United States Army  forces, China, Burma and India, in order to get maximum support from  that theater; and to arrange with General Henry H. Arnold, Commanding  General, Twentieth Air Force, for supporting operations. [31]    Concurrently with the issuance of this directive, momentous events  were taking place in the Pacific. Admiral Halsey was in command of  scheduled operations against the Palau Islands. On 7 and 8 September  aircraft from his carriers struck at Yap and the Palau Islands,  against which Admiral Nimitz had scheduled operations, and for the  next two days bombed Mindanao. On the 12th and 14th the bombers hit  the central Philippines in support of the operations against the  Palau Islands and Morotai.    Admiral Halsey advised Admiral Nimitz that, as a result of the strikes,  few serviceable planes in the Philippines were left to the Japanese,  the bulk of the enemy's oil supplies was destroyed, there was \"no  shipping left to sink,\" the \"enemy's non-aggressive attitude [was]  unbelievable and fantastic,\" and \"the area is wide open.\" [32]  Halsey also told Nimitz that one of his downed carrier pilots had  been told by his Filipino rescuers that there were no Japanese on  Leyte. [33] He therefore felt that it was time to accelerate the  operations in the Pacific, and he strongly recommended that the  intermediate operations--Yap, Talaud, and the Sarangani Bay area on  Mindanao--be canceled. Leyte could be seized immediately and cheaply  without any intermediate operations. Halsey's fleet could cover the  initial landing until land-based aircraft could be established. The  force intended for the occupation of Yap could be made available to  General MacArthur. [34]    When this message was received, the Combined Chiefs of Staff were  attending a conference in Quebec. The recommendations were transmitted  to Quebec by Admiral Nimitz, who offered to place at MacArthur's  disposal the III Amphibious Force, including the XXIV Corps, which  was loading at Pearl Harbor for Yap. General Marshall so informed  General MacArthur and asked his opinion on the proposed change of  target date. [35]    The message reached MacArthur's headquarters at Hollandia, on New  Guinea, while MacArthur was en route to Morotai and observing radio  silence. His chief of staff advised General Marshall that although the  information from the rescued pilot that there were no Japanese on Leyte  was incorrect, the intermediate operations could be eliminated. The  1st Cavalry Division and the 24th Infantry Division with sufficient  service troops were available for the Leyte operation; adequate air  strength could be provided; the logistic support was practicable;  and the XXIV Corps could be used. [36]    General Marshall received this answer at Quebec on 15 September while  he, Admiral Leahy, Admiral King, and General Arnold were at a formal  dinner given by Canadian officers. The Americans withdrew from the  table for a conference. Within an hour and a half after the message  arrived, the Joint Chiefs ordered MacArthur and Nimitz to cancel  the three intermediate operations of Yap, Talaud, and Sarangani,  co-ordinate their plans, and invade Leyte on 20 October. [37]    Later that evening, as he was on his way to his quarters after the  dinner, General Marshall received this message: \"Subject to completion  of arrangements with Nimitz, we shall execute Leyte operation on 20  October.... MacArthur.\" [38]    On 3"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4907"],[0,"Moths of the Limberlost: A Book About Limberlost Cabin (#5)"],[1,"large, outstanding antennae, the claspers are less prominent than  with those having small, inconspicuous head parts.  A fine pair of  antennae, carried forward as by a big, fully developed Cecropia,  are as ornamental to the moth as splendidly branching antlers are  to the head of a deer.    The female now begins egg placing.  This requires time, as one of  these big night moths deposits from three hundred and fifty to  over six hundred eggs.  These lie in embryonic state in the abdomen  of the female.  At her maturity they ripen rapidly.  When they  are ready to deposit, she is forced to place them whether she has  mated or not.  In case a mate has found her, a small pouch near  the end of her abdomen is filled with a fluid that touches each  egg in passing and renders it fertile.  The eggs differ with species  and are placed according to family  characteristics.  They may be  pure white, pearl-coloured, grey, greenish, or yellow.  There are  round, flat, and oblong eggs.  These are placed differently in  freedom and captivity.  A moth in a natural location glues her eggs,  often one at a time, on the under or upper side of leaves.  Sometimes  she dots several in a row, or again makes a number of rows, like a  little beaded mat.  One authority I have consulted states that  \"The eggs are always laid by the female in a state of freedom upon  the food-plant which is most congenial to the larvae.\"  This has not  'always' been the case in my experience.  I have found eggs on  stone walls, boards, fences, outbuildings, and on the bark of dead  trees and stumps as well as living, even on the ground.  This also,  has been the case with the women who wrote \"Caterpillars and their  Moths\", the most invaluable work on the subject ever compiled.    A captive moth feels and resents her limitations.  I cannot force  one to mate even in a large box.  I must free her in the conservatory,  in a room, or put her on an outside window br door screen.  Under  these conditions one will place her eggs more nearly as in freedom;  but this makes them difficult to find and preserve.  Placed in a  box and forced by nature to deposit her eggs, as a rule, she will  remain in one spot and heap them up until she is forced to move to  make room for more.  One big female Regalis of the last chapter  of this book placed them a thimbleful at a time; but the little  caterpillars came rolling out in all directions when due.  In my  experience, they  finish in four or five nights, although I have  read of moths having lived and placed eggs for ten, some species  being said to have deposited over a thousand.  Seven days is  usually the limit of life for these big night moths with me;  they merely grow inactive and sluggish until the very last, when  almost invariably they are seized with a muscular attack, in which  they beat themselves to rags and fringes, as if resisting the  overcoming lethargy.  It is because of this that I have been forced  to resort to the gasoline bottle a few times when I found it impossible  to paint from the living moth; but I do not put one to sleep unless  I am compelled.    I never have been able to induce a female to mate after confinement  had driven her to begin depositing her eggs, not even under the  most favourable conditions I could offer, although others record  that they have been so fortunate.  Repeatedly I have experimented  with males and females of different species, but with no success.  I have not seem a polygamous moth; but have read of experiences  with them.    Sometimes the eggs have a smooth surface, again they may be  ridged or like hammered brass or silver.  The shells are very  thin and break easily.  At one side a place can be detected where  the fertilizing fluid enters.  The coming caterpillar begins to  develop at once and emerges in from six to thirty days, with the  exception of a few eggs placed in the fall that produce during the  following spring.  The length of the egg period differs with  species and somewhat with the same moths, according to suitable or  unfavourable placing, and climatic conditions.  Do not accept the  experience of any one if you have eggs you very much desire to  be productive of the caterpillars of rare moths; after six days  take a peep every day if you would be on the safe side.  With many  species the shells are transparent, and for the last few days  before emergence the growth of the little caterpillars can be  watched through them.    When matured they break or eat a hole in their shells and emerge,  seeming much too large for the space they occupied.  Family  characteristics show at once.  Many of them immediately turn and  eat their shells as if starving; others are more deliberate.  Some  grace around for a time as if exercising and then return and eat  their shells; others walk briskly away and do not dine on  shell for the first meal.  Usually all of them rest close  twenty-four hours before beginning on leaves.  Once they commence  feeding in favourable conditions they eat enormously and grow so  rapidly they soon become too large for their skins to hold them  another instant; so they pause and stop eating for a day or two  while new skin forms.  Then the old is discarded and eaten for a  first meal, with the exception of the face covering.  At the same  time the outer skin is cast the intestinal lining is thrown off,  and practically a new caterpillar, often bearing different markings,  begins to feed again.    These moults occur from four to six times in the development of the  caterpillar; at each it emerges larger, brighter, often with  other changes of colour, and eats more voraciously as it grows.  With me, in handling caterpillars about which I am anxious,  their moulting time is critical.  I lost many until I learned to  clean their boxes thoroughly the instant they stopped eating and  leave them alone until they exhibited hunger signs again.  They  eat greedily of the leaves preferred by each species, doing best  when the foliage is washed and drops of water left for them to  drink as they would find dew and rain out of doors.  Professor  Thomson, of the chair of Natural History of the University of  Aberdeen, makes this statement in his \"Biology of the Seasons\",  \"Another feature in the life of caterpillars is their enormous  appetite.  Some of them seem never to stop eating, and a species  of Polyphemus is said to eat eighty-six thousand times its own  weight in a day.\"  I notice Doctor Thomson does not say that he  knows this, but uses the convenient phrase, \"it is said.\"  This  is an utter impossibility.  The skin of no living creature will  contain eighty-six thousand times its own weight in a day.  I  have raised enough caterpillars to know that if one ate three  times its own weight in a day it would have performed a  skin-stretching feat.  Long after writing this, but before the  manuscript left my hands, I found that the origin of this statement  lies in a table compiled by Trouvelot, in which he estimates that  a Polyphemus caterpillar ten days old weighs one half grain, or  ten times its original weight; at twenty days three grains, or  sixty times its first weight; and so on until at fifty-six days  it weighs two hundred and seven grains, or four thousand one hundred  and forty times its first weight.  To this he adds one half ounce  of water and concludes: \"So the food taken by a single silkworm in  fifty-six days equals in weight eighty-six thousand times the  primitive weight of the worm.\"  This is a far cry from eating  eighty-six thousand times its own weight in a day and upholds in  part my contention in the first chapter, that people attempting to  write upon these subjects \"are not always rightly informed.\"    When the feeding period is finished in freedom, the caterpillar,  if hairless, must be ready to evolve from its interior, the  principal part of the winter quarters characteristic of its species  while changing to the moth form, and in the case of non-feeders,  sustenance for the lifetime of the moth also.  Similar to the moth,  the caterpillar is made up of three parts, head, thorax, and abdomen,  with the organs and appendages of each.  Immediately  after moulting  the head appears very large, and seems much too heavy for the size  of the body.  At the end of a feeding period and just previous to  another moult the body has grown until the head is almost lost from  sight, and it now seems small and insignificant; so that the appearance  of a caterpillar depends on whether you examine it before or after  moulting.    The head is made up of rings or segments, the same as the body, but  they are so closely set that it seems to be a flat, round, or  pointed formation with discernible rings on the face before casting  time.  The eyes are of so simple form that they are supposed only  to distinguish light from darkness.  The complicated mouth is at  the lower part of the head.  It carries a heavy pair of cutters  with which the caterpillar bites off large pieces of leaf, a first  pair of grinders with which it macerates the food, and a second  pair that join in forming the under lip.  There is also the tube that  connects with the silk glands and ends in the spinneret.  Through  this tube a fluid is forced that by movements of the head the  caterpillar attaches where it will and draws into fine threads that  at once harden in silk.  This organism is sufficiently developed  for use in a newly emerged caterpillar, for it can spin threads by  which to drop from leaf to leaf or to guide it back to a starting  point.    The thorax is covered by the first three rings behind the head,  and on it are six legs, two on each segment.  The remainder of the  caterpillar is abdominal and carries small pro-legs with which to  help it cling to twigs and leaves, and the heavy anal props that  support the vent.  By using these and several of the pro-legs  immediately before them, the caterpillar can cling and erect the  front"]]]
