Chapter iii.    An odd accident which befel Mr Allworthy at his return home. The  decent behaviour of Mrs Deborah Wilkins, with some proper  animadversions on bastards.      I have told my reader, in the preceding chapter, that Mr Allworthy  inherited a large fortune; that he had a good heart, and no family.  Hence, doubtless, it will be concluded by many that he lived like an  honest man, owed no one a shilling, took nothing but what was his own,  kept a good house, entertained his neighbours with a hearty welcome at  his table, and was charitable to the poor, i.e. to those who had  rather beg than work, by giving them the offals from it; that he died  immensely rich and built an hospital.    And true it is that he did many of these things; but had he done  nothing more I should have left him to have recorded his own merit on  some fair freestone over the door of that hospital. Matters of a much  more extraordinary kind are to be the subject of this history, or I  should grossly mis-spend my time in writing so voluminous a work; and  you, my sagacious friend, might with equal profit and pleasure travel  through some pages which certain droll authors have been facetiously  pleased to call _The History of England_.    Mr Allworthy had been absent a full quarter of a year in London, on  some very particular business, though I know not what it was; but  judge of its importance by its having detained him so long from home,  whence he had not been absent a month at a time during the space of  many years. He came to his house very late in the evening, and after a  short supper with his sister, retired much fatigued to his chamber.  Here, having spent some minutes on his knees--a custom which he never  broke through on any account--he was preparing to step into bed, when,  upon opening the cloathes, to his great surprize he beheld an infant,  wrapt up in some coarse linen, in a sweet and profound sleep, between  his sheets. He stood some time lost in astonishment at this sight;  but, as good nature had always the ascendant in his mind, he soon  began to be touched with sentiments of compassion for the little  wretch before him. He then rang his bell, and ordered an elderly  woman-servant to rise immediately, and come to him; and in the  meantime was so eager in contemplating the beauty of innocence,  appearing in those lively colours with which infancy and sleep always  display it, that his thoughts were too much engaged to reflect that he  was in his shirt when the matron came in. She had indeed given her  master sufficient time to dress himself; for out of respect to him,  and regard to decency, she had spent many minutes in adjusting her  hair at the looking-glass, notwithstanding all the hurry in which she  had been summoned by the servant, and though her master, for aught she  knew, lay expiring in an apoplexy, or in some other fit.    It will not be wondered at that a creature who had so strict a regard  to decency in her own person, should be shocked at the least deviation  from it in another. She therefore no sooner opened the door, and saw  her master standing by the bedside in his shirt, with a candle in his  hand, than she started back in a most terrible fright, and might  perhaps have swooned away, had he not now recollected his being  undrest, and put an end to her terrors by desiring her to stay without  the door till he had thrown some cloathes over his back, and was  become incapable of shocking the pure eyes of Mrs Deborah Wilkins,  who, though in the fifty-second year of her age, vowed she had never  beheld a man without his coat. Sneerers and prophane wits may perhaps  laugh at her first fright; yet my graver reader, when he considers the  time of night, the summons from her bed, and the situation in which  she found her master, will highly justify and applaud her conduct,  unless the prudence which must be supposed to attend maidens at that  period of life at which Mrs Deborah had arrived, should a little  lessen his admiration.    When Mrs Deborah returned into the room, and was acquainted by her  master with the finding the little infant, her consternation was  rather greater than his had been; nor could she refrain from crying  out, with great horror of accent as well as look, \"My good sir! what's  to be done?\" Mr Allworthy answered, she must take care of the child  that evening, and in the morning he would give orders to provide it a  nurse. \"Yes, sir,\" says she; \"and I hope your worship will send out  your warrant to take up the hussy its mother, for she must be one of  the neighbourhood; and I should be glad to see her committed to  Bridewell, and whipt at the cart's tail. Indeed, such wicked sluts  cannot be too severely punished. I'll warrant 'tis not her first, by  her impudence in laying it to your worship.\" \"In laying it to me,  Deborah!\" answered Allworthy: \"I can't think she hath any such design.  I suppose she hath only taken this method to provide for her child;  and truly I am glad she hath not done worse.\" \"I don't know what is  worse,\" cries Deborah, \"than for such wicked strumpets to lay their  sins at honest men's doors; and though your worship knows your own  innocence, yet the world is censorious; and it hath been many an  honest man's hap to pass for the father of children he never begot;  and if your worship should provide for the child, it may make the  people the apter to believe; besides, why should your worship provide  for what the parish is obliged to maintain? For my own part, if it was  an honest man's child, indeed--but for my own part, it goes against me  to touch these misbegotten wretches, whom I don't look upon as my  fellow-creatures. Faugh! how it stinks! It doth not smell like a  Christian. If I might be so bold to give my advice, I would have it  put in a basket, and sent out and laid at the churchwarden's door. It  is a good night, only a little rainy and windy; and if it was well  wrapt up, and put in a warm basket, it is two to one but it lives till  it is found in the morning. But if it should not, we have discharged  our duty in taking proper care of it; and it is, perhaps, better for  such creatures to die in a state of innocence, than to grow up and  imitate their mothers; for nothing better can be expected of them.\"    There were some strokes in this speech which perhaps would have  offended Mr Allworthy, had he strictly attended to it; but he had now  got one of his fingers into the infant's hand, which, by its gentle  pressure, seeming to implore his assistance, had certainly out-pleaded  the eloquence of Mrs Deborah, had it been ten times greater than it  was. He now gave Mrs Deborah positive orders to take the child to her  own bed, and to call up a maid-servant to provide it pap, and other  things, against it waked. He likewise ordered that proper cloathes  should be procured for it early in the morning, and that it should be  brought to himself as soon as he was stirring.    Such was the discernment of Mrs Wilkins, and such the respect she bore  her master, under whom she enjoyed a most excellent place, that her  scruples gave way to his peremptory commands; and she took the child  under her arms, without any apparent disgust at the illegality of its  birth; and declaring it was a sweet little infant, walked off with it  to her own chamber.    Allworthy here betook himself to those pleasing slumbers which a heart  that hungers after goodness is apt to enjoy when thoroughly satisfied.  As these are possibly sweeter than what are occasioned by any other  hearty meal, I should take more pains to display them to the reader,  if I knew any air to recommend him to for the procuring such an  appetite.        Chapter iv.    The reader's neck brought into danger by a description; his escape;  and the great condescension of Miss Bridget Allworthy.      The Gothic stile of building could produce nothing nobler than Mr  Allworthy's house. There was an air of grandeur in it that struck you  with awe, and rivalled the beauties of the best Grecian architecture;  and it was as commodious within as venerable without.    It stood on the south-east side of a hill, but nearer the bottom than  the top of it, so as to be sheltered from the north-east by a grove of  old oaks which rose above it in a gradual ascent of near half a mile,  and yet high enough to enjoy a most charming prospect of the valley  beneath.    In the midst of the grove was a fine lawn, sloping down towards the  house, near the summit of which rose a plentiful spring, gushing out  of a rock covered with firs, and forming a constant cascade of about  thirty feet, not carried down a regular flight of steps, but tumbling  in a natural fall over the broken and mossy stones till it came to the  bottom of the rock, then running off in a pebly channel, that with  many lesser falls winded along, till it fell into a lake at the foot  of the hill, about a quarter of a mile below the house on the south  side, and which was seen from every room in the front. Out of this  lake, which filled the center of a beautiful plain, embellished with  groups of beeches and elms, and fed with sheep, issued a river, that  for several miles was seen to meander through an amazing variety of  meadows and woods till it emptied itself into the sea, with a large  arm of which, and an island beyond it, the prospect was closed.    On the right of this valley opened another of less extent, adorned  with several villages, and terminated by one of the towers of an old  ruined abby, grown over with ivy, and part of the front, which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6603"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage : 600-1776 King Aethelbert - King George III (#5)"],[1,"family. Its members lived a  village in which a stone church was the most prominent building.  They lived in one-room huts with walls and roofs made of wood,  mud, and straw. Hangings covered the cracks in the walls to keep  the wind out. Smoke from a fire in the middle of the room filtered  out of cracks in the roof. Grain was ground at home by rotating by  hand one stone disk on another stone disk. Some villages had a  mill powered by the flow of water or by horses. All freeholders  had the duty of watch [at night] and ward [during the day], of  following the hue and cry to chase an offender, and of taking the  oath of peace. These three duties were constant until 1195.    Farmland surrounded the villages and was farmed by the community  as a whole under the direction of a lord. There was silver,  copper, iron, tin, gold, and various types of stones from remote  lead mines and quarries in the nation. Silver pennies replaced the  smaller scaetts. Freemen paid \"scot\" and bore \"lot\" according to  their means for local purposes.    Everyone in the village went to church on Sunday and brought gifts  such as grain to the priest. Later, contributions in the form of  money became customary, and then expected. They were called  \"tithes\" and were spent for church repair, the clergy, and poor  and needy laborers. Local custom determined the amount. There was  also church-scot: a payment to the clergy in lieu of the first  fruits of the land. The priest was the chaplain of a landlord and  his parish was coextensive with that landlord's holding and could  include one to several villages. The priest and other men who  helped him, lived in the church building. Some churches had lead  roofs and iron hinges, latches, and locks on their doors. The land  underneath had been given to the church by former kings and  persons who wanted the church to say prayers to help their souls  go from purgatory to heaven and who also selected the first  priest. The priest conducted Christianized Easter ceremonies in  the spring and (Christ's mass) ceremonies in winter in place of  the pagan Yuletide festivities. Burning incense took the place of  pagan burnt animal offerings, which were accompanied by incense to  disguise the odor of burning flesh. Holy water replaced haunted  wells and streams. Christian incantations replaced sorcerer's  spells. Nuns assisted priests in celebrating mass and  administering the sacraments. They alone consecrated new nuns.  Vestry meetings were community meetings held for church purposes.  The people said their prayers in English, and the priest conducted  the services in English. A person joined his hands in prayer as if  to offer them for binding together in submission.    The church baptized babies and officiated or gave blessings at  marriage ceremonies. It also said prayers for the dying, gave them  funerals, and buried them. There were burial service fees, candle  dues, and plough alms. A piece of stone with the dead person's  name marked his grave. It was thought that putting the name on the  grave would assist identification of that person for being taken  to heaven. The church heard the last wish or will of the person  dying concerning who he wanted to have his property. The church  taught that it was not necessary to bury possessions with the  deceased. The church taught boys and girls.    Every man carried a horn slung on his shoulder as he went about  his work so that he could at once send out a warning to his fellow  villagers or call them in chasing a thief or other offender. The  forests were full of outlaws, so strangers who did not blow a horn  to announce themselves were presumed to be fugitive offenders who  could be shot on sight. An eorl could call upon the ceorl farmers  for about forty days to fight off an invading group.    There were several kingdoms, whose boundaries kept changing due to  warfare, which was a sin according to the church. They were each  governed by a king and witan of wise men who met at a witanegemot,  which was usually held three times a year, mostly on great church  festivals and at the end of the harvest. The king and witan chose  the witan's members of bishops, eorldormen, and thegns  [landholding farmers]. The king and hereditary claims played a  major part in the selection of the eorldormen, who were the  highest military leaders and often of the royal family. They were  also chief magistrates of large jurisdictional areas of land. The  witan included officers of the king's household and perhaps other  of his retinue. There was little distinction then between his  gesith, fighting men, guards, household companions, dependents,  and servants. The king was sometimes accompanied by his wife and  sons at the witanagemot. A king was selected by the witan  according to his worthiness, usually from among the royal family,  and could be deposed by it. The witan and king decided on laws,  taxes, and transfers of land. They made determinations of war and  peace and directed the army and the fleet. The king wore a crown  or royal helmet. He extended certain protections by the king's  peace. He could erect castles and bridges and could provide a  special protection to strangers.    A king had not only a wergeld to be paid to his family if he were  killed, but a \"cynebot\" of equal amount that would be paid to his  kingdom's people. A king's household had a chamberlain for the  royal bedchamber, a marshall to oversee the horses and military  equipment, a steward as head of household, and a cupbearer. The  king had income from fines for breach of his peace; fines and  forfeitures from courts dealing with criminal and civil cases;  salvage from ship wrecks; treasure trove [assets hidden or buried  in times of war]; treasures of the earht such as gold and silver;  mines; saltworks; tolls and other dues of markets, ports, and the  routes by land and by river generally; heriot from heirs of his  special dependents for possession of land (usually in kind,  principally in horses and weapons). He also had rights of  purveyance [hospitality and maintenance when traveling]. The king  had private lands, which he could dispose of by his will. He also  had crown lands, which belonged to his office and could not be  alienated without consent of the witan. Crown lands often included  palaces and their appendant farms, and burhs. It was a queen's  duty to run the royal estate. Also, a queen could possess, manage,  and dispose of lands in her name. Violent queens waged wars.  Kingdoms were often allied by marriage between their royal  families. There were also royal marriages to royalty on the  continent.    The houses of the wealthy had ornamented silk hangings on the  walls. Some had fine white ox horn shaved so thin they were  transparent for windows. Brightly colored drapery, often purple,  and fly nets surrounded their beds, which were covered with the  fur of animals. They slept in bed clothes on pillows stuffed with  straw. Tables plated with silver and gems held silver  candlesticks, gold and silver goblets and cups, and lamps of gold,  silver, or glass. They used silver mirrors and silver writing  pens. There were covered seats, benches, and footstools with the  head and feet of animals at their extremities. They ate from a  table covered with a cloth. Servants brought in food on spits,  from which they ate. Food was boiled, broiled, or baked. The  wealthy ate wheat bread and others ate barley bread. Ale made from  barley was passed around in a cup. Mead made from honey was also  drunk.    Men wore long-sleeved wool and linen garments reaching almost to  the knee, around which they wore a belt tied in a knot. Men often  wore a gold ring on the fourth finger of the right hand. Leather  shoes were fastened with leather thongs around the ankle. Their  hair was parted in the middle and combed down each side in waving  ringlets. The beard was parted in the middle of the chin, so that  it ended in two points. The clergy did not wear beards. Great men  wore gold-embroidered clothes, gilt buckles and brooches, and  drank from drinking horns mounted in silver gilt or in gold. Well-  to-do women wore brightly colored robes with waist bands,  headbands, necklaces, gem bracelets, and rings. Their long hair  was in ringlets and they put rouge on their cheeks. They had  beads, pins, needles, tweezers of bronze, and workboxes of bronze,  some highly ornamented. They were often doing needlework. Silk was  affordable only by the wealthy.    Most families kept a pig and pork was the primary meat. There were  also sheep, goats, cows, deer, hare, and fowl. Fowl was obtained  by fowlers who trapped them. The inland waters yielded eels,  salmon, and trout. In the fall, meat was salted to preserve it for  winter meals. There were orchards growing figs, nuts, grapes,  almonds, pears, and apples. Also produced were beans, lentils,  onions, eggs, cheese, and butter. Pepper and cinnamon were  imported.    Fishing from the sea yielded herrings, sturgeon, porpoise,  oysters, crabs, and other fish. Sometimes a whale was driven into  an inlet by a group of boats. Whale skins were used to make ropes.    The roads were not much more than trails. They were often so  narrow that two pack horses could hardly pass each other. The pack  horses each carried two bales or two baskets slung over their  backs, which balanced each other. The soft soil was compacted into  a deep ditch which rains, floods, and tides, if near the sea, soon  turned into a river. Traveling a far distance was unsafe as there  were robbers on the roads. Traveling strangers were distrusted. It  was usual to wash one's feet in a hot tub after traveling and to  dry them with a rough wool cloth.    There were superstitions about the content of dreams, the events  of the moon, and the flights and voices of birds were often seen  as signs or omens of future events. Herbal mixtures were drunk for  sickness and maladies. From the witch hazel plant "]]]
