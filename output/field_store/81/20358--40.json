You can't make many  mistakes, if you're careful. It's mostly entering letters and stamping  them.'    They turned in at the door in the counter, and arrived at a desk which  ran parallel to the gangway. There was a high rack running along it, on  which were several ledgers. Tall, green-shaded electric lamps gave it  rather a cosy look.    As they reached the desk, a little man with short, black whiskers  buzzed out from behind a glass screen, where there was another desk.    'Where have you been, Bannister, where have you been? You must not  leave your work in this way. There are several letters waiting to be  entered. Where have you been?'    'Mr Bickersdyke sent for me,' said Bannister, with the calm triumph of  one who trumps an ace.    'Oh! Ah! Oh! Yes, very well. I see. But get to work, get to work. Who  is this?'    'This is a new man. He's taking my place. I've been moved on to the  cash.'    'Oh! Ah! Is your name Smith?' asked Mr Rossiter, turning to Mike.    Mike corrected the rash guess, and gave his name. It struck him as a  curious coincidence that he should be asked if his name were Smith, of  all others. Not that it is an uncommon name.    'Mr Bickersdyke told me to expect a Mr Smith. Well, well, perhaps there  are two new men. Mr Bickersdyke knows we are short-handed in this  department. But, come along, Bannister, come along. Show Jackson what  he has to do. We must get on. There is no time to waste.'    He buzzed back to his lair. Bannister grinned at Mike. He was a  cheerful youth. His normal expression was a grin.    'That's a sample of Rossiter,' he said. 'You'd think from the fuss he's  made that the business of the place was at a standstill till we got to  work. Perfect rot! There's never anything to do here till after lunch,  except checking the stamps and petty cash, and I've done that ages ago.  There are three letters. You may as well enter them. It all looks like  work. But you'll find the best way is to wait till you get a couple of  dozen or so, and then work them off in a batch. But if you see Rossiter  about, then start stamping something or writing something, or he'll run  you in for neglecting your job. He's a nut. I'm jolly glad I'm under  old Waller now. He's the pick of the bunch. The other heads of  departments are all nuts, and Bickersdyke's the nuttiest of the lot.  Now, look here. This is all you've got to do. I'll just show you, and  then you can manage for yourself. I shall have to be shunting off to my  own work in a minute.'          5. The Other Man      As Bannister had said, the work in the postage department was not  intricate. There was nothing much to do except enter and stamp letters,  and, at intervals, take them down to the post office at the end of the  street. The nature of the work gave Mike plenty of time for reflection.    His thoughts became gloomy again. All this was very far removed from  the life to which he had looked forward. There are some people who take  naturally to a life of commerce. Mike was not of these. To him the  restraint of the business was irksome. He had been used to an open-air  life, and a life, in its way, of excitement. He gathered that he would  not be free till five o'clock, and that on the following day he would  come at ten and go at five, and the same every day, except Saturdays  and Sundays, all the year round, with a ten days' holiday. The monotony  of the prospect appalled him. He was not old enough to know what a  narcotic is Habit, and that one can become attached to and interested  in the most unpromising jobs. He worked away dismally at his letters  till he had finished them. Then there was nothing to do except sit and  wait for more.    He looked through the letters he had stamped, and re-read the  addresses. Some of them were directed to people living in the country,  one to a house which he knew quite well, near to his own home in  Shropshire. It made him home-sick, conjuring up visions of shady  gardens and country sounds and smells, and the silver Severn gleaming  in the distance through the trees. About now, if he were not in this  dismal place, he would be lying in the shade in the garden with a book,  or wandering down to the river to boat or bathe. That envelope  addressed to the man in Shropshire gave him the worst moment he had  experienced that day.    The time crept slowly on to one o'clock. At two minutes past Mike awoke  from a day-dream to find Mr Waller standing by his side. The cashier  had his hat on.    'I wonder,' said Mr Waller, 'if you would care to come out to lunch. I  generally go about this time, and Mr Rossiter, I know, does not go out  till two. I thought perhaps that, being unused to the City, you might  have some difficulty in finding your way about.'    'It's awfully good of you,' said Mike. 'I should like to.'    The other led the way through the streets and down obscure alleys till  they came to a chop-house. Here one could have the doubtful pleasure of  seeing one's chop in its various stages of evolution. Mr Waller ordered  lunch with the care of one to whom lunch is no slight matter. Few  workers in the City do regard lunch as a trivial affair. It is the  keynote of their day. It is an oasis in a desert of ink and ledgers.  Conversation in city office deals, in the morning, with what one is  going to have for lunch, and in the afternoon with what one has had for  lunch.    At intervals during the meal Mr Waller talked. Mike was content to  listen. There was something soothing about the grey-bearded one.    'What sort of a man is Bickersdyke?' asked Mike.    'A very able man. A very able man indeed. I'm afraid he's not popular  in the office. A little inclined, perhaps, to be hard on mistakes. I  can remember the time when he was quite different. He and I were fellow  clerks in Morton and Blatherwick's. He got on better than I did. A  great fellow for getting on. They say he is to be the Unionist  candidate for Kenningford when the time comes. A great worker, but  perhaps not quite the sort of man to be generally popular in an  office.'    'He's a blighter,' was Mike's verdict. Mr Waller made no comment. Mike  was to learn later that the manager and the cashier, despite the fact  that they had been together in less prosperous days--or possibly  because of it--were not on very good terms. Mr Bickersdyke was a man of  strong prejudices, and he disliked the cashier, whom he looked down  upon as one who had climbed to a lower rung of the ladder than he  himself had reached.    As the hands of the chop-house clock reached a quarter to two, Mr  Waller rose, and led the way back to the office, where they parted for  their respective desks. Gratitude for any good turn done to him was a  leading characteristic of Mike's nature, and he felt genuinely grateful  to the cashier for troubling to seek him out and be friendly to him.    His three-quarters-of-an-hour absence had led to the accumulation of a  small pile of letters on his desk. He sat down and began to work them  off. The addresses continued to exercise a fascination for him. He was  miles away from the office, speculating on what sort of a man J. B.  Garside, Esq, was, and whether he had a good time at his house in  Worcestershire, when somebody tapped him on the shoulder.    He looked up.    Standing by his side, immaculately dressed as ever, with his eye-glass  fixed and a gentle smile on his face, was Psmith.    Mike stared.    'Commerce,' said Psmith, as he drew off his lavender gloves, 'has  claimed me for her own. Comrade of old, I, too, have joined this  blighted institution.'    As he spoke, there was a whirring noise in the immediate neighbourhood,  and Mr Rossiter buzzed out from his den with the _esprit_ and  animation of a clock-work toy.    'Who's here?' said Psmith with interest, removing his eye-glass,  polishing it, and replacing it in his eye.    'Mr Jackson,' exclaimed Mr Rossiter. 'I really must ask you to be good  enough to come in from your lunch at the proper time. It was fully  seven minutes to two when you returned, and--'    'That little more,' sighed Psmith, 'and how much is it!'    'Who are you?' snapped Mr Rossiter, turning on him.    'I shall be delighted, Comrade--'    'Rossiter,' said Mike, aside.    'Comrade Rossiter. I shall be delighted to furnish you with particulars  of my family history. As follows. Soon after the Norman Conquest, a  certain Sieur de Psmith grew tired of work--a family failing,  alas!--and settled down in this country to live peacefully for the  remainder of his life on what he could extract from the local  peasantry. He may be described as the founder of the family which  ultimately culminated in Me. Passing on--'    Mr Rossiter refused to pass on.    'What are you doing here? What have you come for?'    'Work,' said Psmith, with simple dignity. 'I am now a member of the  staff of this bank. Its interests are my interests. Psmith, the  individual, ceases to exist, and there springs into being Psmith, the  cog in the wheel of the New Asiatic Bank; Psmith, the link in the  bank's chain; Psmith, the Worker. I shall not spare myself,' he  proceeded earnestly. 'I shall toil with all the accumulated energy of  one who, up till now, has only known what work is like from hearsay.  Whose is that form sitting on the steps of the bank in the morning,  waiting eagerly for the place to open? It is the form of Psmith, the  Worker. Whose is that haggard, drawn face which bends over a ledger  long after the other toilers have sped blithely westwards to dine at  Lyons' Popular Cafe? It is the face of Psmith, the Worker.'    'I--' began Mr Rossiter.    'I tell you,' continued Psmith, waving aside the interruption and  tapping the head of the department rhythmically in the region of the  second waistcoat-button with a long finger, 'I tell _you_, Comrade  Rossiter, that you have got hold of a good man. You and I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6762"],[0,"Politics: A Treatise on Government (#5)"],[1," the story goes of the statues of Daedalus; or what the poet tells us  of the tripods of Vulcan, \"that they moved of their own accord into the  assembly of the gods \"), the shuttle would then weave, and the lyre play  of itself; nor would the architect want servants, or the [1254a] master  slaves. Now what are generally called instruments are the efficients  of something else, but possessions are what we simply use: thus with a  shuttle we make something else for our use; but we only use a coat, or a  bed: since then making and using differ from each other in species, and  they both require their instruments, it is necessary that these should  be different from each other. Now life is itself what we use, and not  what we employ as the efficient of something else; for which reason the  services of a slave are for use. A possession may be considered in the  same nature as a part of anything; now a part is not only a part of  something, but also is nothing else; so is a possession; therefore a  master is only the master of the slave, but no part of him; but the  slave is not only the slave of the master, but nothing else but that.  This fully explains what is the nature of a slave, and what are his  capacities; for that being who by nature is nothing of himself, but  totally another's, and is a man, is a slave by nature; and that man who  is the property of another, is his mere chattel, though he continues a  man; but a chattel is an instrument for use, separate from the body.          CHAPTER V      But whether any person is such by nature, and whether it is advantageous  and just for any one to be a slave or no, or whether all slavery is  contrary to nature, shall be considered hereafter; not that it is  difficult to determine it upon general principles, or to understand  it from matters of fact; for that some should govern, and others be  governed, is not only necessary but useful, and from the hour of their  birth some are marked out for those purposes, and others for the other,  and there are many species of both sorts. And the better those are who  are governed the better also is the government, as for instance of man,  rather than the brute creation: for the more excellent the materials  are with which the work is finished, the more excellent certainly is the  work; and wherever there is a governor and a governed, there certainly  is some work produced; for whatsoever is composed of many parts, which  jointly become one, whether conjunct or separate, evidently show the  marks of governing and governed; and this is true of every living thing  in all nature; nay, even in some things which partake not of life, as  in music; but this probably would be a disquisition too foreign to our  present purpose. Every living thing in the first place is composed of  soul and body, of these the one is by nature the governor, the other the  governed; now if we would know what is natural, we ought to search for  it in those subjects in which nature appears most perfect, and not in  those which are corrupted; we should therefore examine into a man who  is most perfectly formed both in soul and body, in whom this is evident,  for in the depraved and vicious the body seems [1254b] to rule rather  than the soul, on account of their being corrupt and contrary to nature.  We may then, as we affirm, perceive in an animal the first principles  of herile and political government; for the soul governs the body as the  master governs his slave; the mind governs the appetite with a political  or a kingly power, which shows that it is both natural and advantageous  that the body should be governed by the soul, and the pathetic part by  the mind, and that part which is possessed of reason; but to have no  ruling power, or an improper one, is hurtful to all; and this holds  true not only of man, but of other animals also, for tame animals are  naturally better than wild ones, and it is advantageous that both should  be under subjection to man; for this is productive of their common  safety: so is it naturally with the male and the female; the one is  superior, the other inferior; the one governs, the other is governed;  and the same rule must necessarily hold good with respect to all  mankind. Those men therefore who are as much inferior to others as the  body is to the soul, are to be thus disposed of, as the proper use of  them is their bodies, in which their excellence consists; and if what I  have said be true, they are slaves by nature, and it is advantageous to  them to be always under government. He then is by nature formed a slave  who is qualified to become the chattel of another person, and on that  account is so, and who has just reason enough to know that there is such  a faculty, without being indued with the use of it; for other animals  have no perception of reason, but are entirely guided by appetite,  and indeed they vary very little in their use from each other; for the  advantage which we receive, both from slaves and tame animals, arises  from their bodily strength administering to our necessities; for it  is the intention of nature to make the bodies of slaves and freemen  different from each other, that the one should be robust for their  necessary purposes, the others erect, useless indeed for what slaves are  employed in, but fit for civil life, which is divided into the duties of  war and peace; though these rules do not always take place, for slaves  have sometimes the bodies of freemen, sometimes the souls; if then it  is evident that if some bodies are as much more excellent than others as  the statues of the gods excel the human form, every one will allow that  the inferior ought to be slaves to the superior; and if this is true  with respect to the body, it is still juster to determine in the same  manner, when we consider the soul; though it is not so easy to perceive  the beauty of [1255a] the soul as it is of the body. Since then some  men are slaves by nature, and others are freemen, it is clear that where  slavery is advantageous to any one, then it is just to make him a slave.          CHAPTER VI      But it is not difficult to perceive that those who maintain the contrary  opinion have some reason on their side; for a man may become a slave two  different ways; for he may be so by law also, and this law is a certain  compact, by which whatsoever is taken in battle is adjudged to be the  property of the conquerors: but many persons who are conversant in law  call in question this pretended right, and say that it would be hard  that a man should be compelled by violence to be the slave and subject  of another who had the power to compel him, and was his superior in  strength; and upon this subject, even of those who are wise, some think  one way and some another; but the cause of this doubt and variety of  opinions arises from hence, that great abilities, when accompanied with  proper means, are generally able to succeed by force: for victory is  always owing to a superiority in some advantageous circumstances; so  that it seems that force never prevails but in consequence of great  abilities. But still the dispute concerning the justice of it remains;  for some persons think, that justice consists in benevolence, others  think it just that the powerful should govern: in the midst of these  contrary opinions, there are no reasons sufficient to convince us, that  the right of being master and governor ought not to be placed with those  who have the greatest abilities. Some persons, entirely resting upon the  right which the law gives (for that which is legal is in some respects  just), insist upon it that slavery occasioned by war is just, not that  they say it is wholly so, for it may happen that the principle upon  which the wars were commenced is unjust; moreover no one will say that a  man who is unworthily in slavery is therefore a slave; for if so, men of  the noblest families might happen to be slaves, and the descendants of  slaves, if they should chance to be taken prisoners in war and sold: to  avoid this difficulty they say that such persons should not be called  slaves, but barbarians only should; but when they say this, they do  nothing more than inquire who is a slave by nature, which was what we  at first said; for we must acknowledge that there are some persons  who, wherever they are, must necessarily be slaves, but others in no  situation; thus also it is with those of noble descent: it is not only  in their own country that they are Esteemed as such, but everywhere,  but the barbarians are respected on this account at home only; as if  nobility and freedom were of two sorts, the one universal, the other not  so. Thus says the Helen of Theodectes:      \"Who dares reproach me with the name of slave? When from the  immortal gods, on either side, I draw my lineage.\"    Those who express sentiments like these, shew only that they distinguish  the slave and the freeman, the noble and the ignoble from each other  by their virtues and their [1255b] vices; for they think it reasonable,  that as a man begets a man, and a beast a beast, so from a good man, a  good man should be descended; and this is what nature desires to do, but  frequently cannot accomplish it. It is evident then that this doubt  has some reason in it, and that these persons are not slaves, and those  freemen, by the appointment of nature; and also that in some instances  it is sufficiently clear, that it is advantageous to both parties for  this man to be a slave, and that to be a master, and that it is right  and just, that some should be governed, and others govern, in the manner  that nature intended; of which sort of government is that which a master  exercises over a slave. But to govern ill is disadvantageous to both;  for the same thing is useful to the part and to the whole, to the body  and to the soul; but the slave is as it were a part of the master, as if  he were an animated part of his body, though separate."]]]
