Is it to be wondered at that a feeling of  disquietude is spreading throughout all classes of the nation. By delay  on our side, valuable military advantages may be lost if the people once  suspect that there is an absence of that firmness and joy of  responsibility (_Verantwortungsfreudigkeit_) which marked the action of  the Austrian Government and was hailed with jubilation by the German  nation.    \"_Summa summarum_: The German Government has taken honest pains during  the last week in showing its peace-loving disposition and in seeking a  peaceful solution to the crisis. Nevertheless the political situation on  all sides and in every respect, has become worse from day to day through  the fault and according to the intention of the Triple Entente.\"[10]    [Footnote 10: _Kreuz Zeitung_, July 31st.]    \"The others are mobilizing. We--issue denials. We deny everything which  might mean mobilization or look like preparation for that step. It is  done for the sake of 'peace,' so that Russia, who is gathering her  national strength together in masses, may not be offended. Are we being  led? We look to the Kaiser. The Peace Societies and some of Germany's  enemies are looking to him.    \"Can we remain indifferent in our hour of dread need, when the gleaming  promise of a bright future appears in the distance, if the inability to  resolve and dare has made Berlin its headquarters. All efforts are for  'peace' with honour. But in politics one must be able to recognize when  it is impossible to continue at peace; when peace is at the cost of our  friends, our own security, and the future of European peace. In view of  this one must be able to act.\"[11]    [Footnote 11: _Deutsche Zeitung_, July 31st.]    The internal tactics of the German Government had been successful all  along the line. Insignificant Serbia had dropped out of the reckoning.  Russia must be humbled. The German nation, believing itself entirely  peaceful, and convinced that its leaders had done everything possible  for peace, now demanded in no unmistakable voice--action! mobilization!  war!    Announcements of mobilization on all sides (Switzerland, Holland,  Belgium) doubtless added to the popular belief that Germany desired  above all things--peace. Still, in spite of the warlike spirit of the  nation and the burning desire to settle off Russia once and for all,  there was an undercurrent of overstrained nervousness. A Dresden paper  of July 30th relates that between the hours of two and four on the  preceding afternoon a Berlin newspaper had been asked thirty-seven  different questions on the telephone relating to rumours of  assassinations, mobilization, etc.    The process of inspiring national confidence, however, had by no means  suffered through neglect. France was represented as being unprepared  and, together with England, desiring only peace. As early as July 27th  in the _Taegliche Rundschau_ the public had been told that Italy, had  officially declared herself ready and willing to stand by the Central  Powers as an ally.    Even Japan was used to stiffen Teutonic courage. The _Deutscher Kurier_  told its readers in a telegram from New York (?) that Americans fully  expected Japan to attack Russia in the back and Japanese ministers were  holding conferences all day and night. According to the _Weser Zeitung_,  August 1st, Japan was arming for war, while the _Muenchen-Augsburger  Zeitung_ published details of an alliance concluded between Austria and  Japan in Vienna on the afternoon of July 30th. According to this source  Japan had pledged herself to support Austria in case the latter was  attacked by Russia, while Austria declared her absolute  disinterestedness in the Far East. On August 1st the _Berliner  Tageblatt_ repeated this legend; but advised its readers to exercise  reserve in accepting it.    \"During the evening (August 2nd) the news spread in the streets of  Berlin that Japan was mobilizing and had already declared war on Russia.  Huge crowds flocked to the Japanese Embassy and spent hours in cheering  Japan, Germany, and the Triple Alliance.\"[12]    [Footnote 12: _Der Montag_, August 3rd.]    Meanwhile Russia, having failed to get her simple rights recognized and  knowing that Germany had made extensive military preparations, decided  on July 31st to mobilize her entire forces. The German Ambassador  immediately informed his Government of this step, and the Kaiser placed  Germany under martial law. On the same day the Emperor proceeded from  Potsdam to the Imperial Palace in Berlin.          CHAPTER III    THE DOGS LET LOOSE      \"Just after three o'clock a company, at war strength, from the  'Alexander' regiment marched under the command of a young lieutenant,  down Unter den Linden. Drums were beaten; a huge crowd listened in  solemn silence as the lieutenant read the articles placing the German  Empire under martial law. The crowd was fully alive to the awful  sternness of this historic moment.    \"After the proclamation was ended a deep silence ensued, then a loud  voice cried: 'The Kaiser! Hurrah!' Three times the shout rang to the  heavens. 'The German army! Hurrah!' Once more the caps were swung three  times. The boy-like lieutenant, with head erect, sword in hand,  commands: 'Attention! Slope arms!' The regular beat of marching men  follows as they proceed in the direction of the Imperial Residence.  Berlin is under martial law!\"[13]    [Footnote 13: _Deutscher Kurier_, July 31st.]    \"During the afternoon enormous masses of people collected in the streets  and open spaces of Berlin. Unter den Linden, in expectation of the  Kaiser's return, was overfilled with excited, waiting throngs. Just  before a quarter to four a great movement was seen from the direction of  the Brandenburger Tor, which spread like a wave along the street.  Everybody rushed on to the road, and the police were pushed aside. Then  the suppressed excitement of the last few days gave vent to a hurricane  of hurrahs as the populace greeted their monarch. The Emperor was  wearing the uniform of the _Garde-Kuerassiere_; beside him sat the  Empress. His countenance was overshadowed by deep gravity as he returned  the welcome of his subjects. At a quarter to four the Kaiser was in the  royal castle, and immediately the Imperial Standard was fluttering  aloft.\"[14]    [Footnote 14: _Vossische Zeitung_, July 31st.]    The next twenty-four hours are so full of fateful events that they seem  one big blur on the memory. Although everyone was convinced that an  appeal to the sword was inevitable, there was still a tense feeling of  dread expectation hanging like a cloud over the land. During the whole  of that long night the author was an observer from an overcrowded train  which left Nuremberg at 9 p.m. and rumbled dismally into Cologne the  next morning at ten o'clock. Every station, great and small, was crowded  with anxious, expectant crowds; the smaller stations full of spectators  and relatives bidding farewell to departing soldiers, and the greater  ones crowded with fleeing tourists.    On the platforms at Frankfort and Cologne many tons of luggage were  stacked in huge piles. It would be interesting to know what became of  them.[15] Few Germans could have slept that night; the anxiety was too  great. The whole railway line was guarded by patrols, many of whom were  in civilian attire. Here and there a \"field-grey\" uniform was visible.  On many stations armed guards awaited the arrival of reservists and gave  them conduct to the barracks.    [Footnote 15: The _Koenigsberger Hartungsche Zeitung_ contained a  paragraph on August 7th to the effect that 120,000 trunks and  portmanteaux had been collected on Berlin stations alone.]    The Kaiser spoke words of cheer from a window of the royal palace on  Friday evening, after which the restless crowd thronged to the official  residence of the Chancellor to receive as a watchword the words which  Prince Friedrich Karl had spoken on a memorable occasion to his  Brandenburger troops: \"Let your hearts beat to God, and your blows on  the enemy.\"    An ultimatum was despatched to St. Petersburg and presented at midnight  to the Russian Government. The latter was requested to cancel all  mobilization orders within twelve hours, or war would ensue.  Simultaneously the French Government was asked what its attitude would  be in case of a Russo-German war. In these measures it is safe to  conclude that the German nation was heart and soul behind the  Government, otherwise the tremendous outbreak of national enthusiasm  throughout the length and breadth of the land would be entirely  inexplicable.    Throughout the day the nation awaited, under tense strain, an answer  from Russia. \"At five o'clock the excitement of the masses in Unter den  Linden had increased to a degree almost beyond endurance. The crowd  surged from side to side when a court carriage or an officer drove by in  a motor-car. Everyone felt that the fateful decision might fall at any  minute, when the German nation would know its fate.    \"Suddenly motor-cars full of officers appeared from the gates of the  royal residence. They shouted to the excited crowd that the general  mobilization had been ordered. One officer waved his drawn sword,  another his handkerchief, while others stood up and waved their caps.  Then an indescribable scene of jubilation followed; the parole  'mobilization' was passed on by the police, and in less time than it  takes to write, the hundreds of thousands of human beings surging to and  fro between the monument to 'Old Fritz' and the Lustgarten, knew that  Germany would now speak with her sword.\"[16]    [Footnote 16: _Berliner Tageblatt_, August 2nd.]    \"Our hour of destiny has struck! Germany, the strongest and most  peaceful nation on earth, appeals to the sword. The last call which we  sent across the Eastern frontier has remained unanswered. The enemy is  mute. Now "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10201"],[0,"The Desert of Wheat (#6)"],[1," leisurely rose, to  fasten penetrating eyes upon the young man. \"That's what I heard about  you rich farmers of the Bend.\"    \"What business have you coming here?\" queried Kurt, with sharp heat.  \"You sneak out of sight of the farmers. You trespass to get at our men  and with a lot of lies and guff you make them discontented with their  jobs. I'll fire these men just for listening to you.\"    \"Mister Dorn, we want you to fire them. That's my business out here,\"  replied the American.    \"Who are you, anyway?\"    \"That's my business, too.\"    Kurt passed from hot to cold. He could not miss the antagonism of this  man, a bold and menacing attitude.    \"My foreman says your name's Glidden,\" went on Kurt, cooler this time,  \"and that you're talking I.W.W. as if you were one of its leaders; that  you don't want a job; that you've got a wad of money; that you coax,  then threaten; that you've intimidated three of our hands.\"    \"Your Jerry's a marked man,\" said Glidden, shortly.    \"You impudent scoundrel!\" exclaimed Kurt. \"Now you listen to this.  You're the first I.W.W. man I've met. You look and talk like an  American. But if you are American you're a traitor. We've a war to  fight! War with a powerful country! Germany! And you come spreading  discontent in the wheat-fields,... when wheat means life!... Get out of  here before I--\"    \"We'll mark you, too, Mister Dorn, and your wheat-fields,\" snapped  Glidden.    With one swift lunge Kurt knocked the man flat and then leaped to stand  over him, watching for a move to draw a weapon. The little foreigner  slunk back out of reach.    \"I'll start a little marking myself,\" grimly said Kurt. \"Get up!\"    Slowly Glidden moved from elbow to knees, and then to his feet. His  cheek was puffing out and his nose was bleeding. The light-gray eyes  were lurid.    \"That's for your I.W.W.!\" declared Kurt. \"The first rule of your I.W.W.  is to abolish capital, hey?\"    Kurt had not intended to say that. It slipped out in his fury. But the  effect was striking. Glidden gave a violent start and his face turned  white. Abruptly he hurried away. His companion shuffled after him. Kurt  stared at them, thinking the while that if he had needed any proof of  the crookedness of the I.W.W. he had seen it in Glidden's guilty face.  The man had been suddenly frightened, and surprise, too, had been  prominent in his countenance. Then Kurt remembered how Anderson had  intimated that the secrets of the I.W.W. had been long hidden. Kurt,  keen and quick in his sensibilities, divined that there was something  powerful back of this Glidden's cunning and assurance. Could it be only  the power of a new labor organization? That might well be great, but the  idea did not convince Kurt. During a hurried and tremendous preparation  by the government for war, any disorder such as menaced the country  would be little short of a calamity. It might turn out a fatality. This  so-called labor union intended to take advantage of a crisis to further  its own ends. Yet even so, that fact did not wholly explain Glidden and  his subtlety. Some nameless force loomed dark and sinister back of  Glidden's meaning, and it was not peril to the wheatlands of the  Northwest alone.    Like a huge dog Kurt shook himself and launched into action. There were  sense and pleasure in muscular activity, and it lessened the habit of  worry. Soon he ascertained that only Morgan had returned to work in the  fields. Andrew and Jansen were nowhere to be seen. Jansen had left four  horses hitched to a harrow. Kurt went out to take up the work thus  abandoned.    It was a long field, and if he had earned a dollar for every time he had  traversed its length, during the last ten years, he would have been a  rich man. He could have walked it blindfolded. It was fallow ground,  already plowed, disked, rolled, and now the last stage was to harrow it,  loosening the soil, conserving the moisture.    Morgan, far to the other side of this section, had the better of the  job, for his harrow was a new machine and he could ride while driving  the horses. But Kurt, using an old harrow, had to walk. The four big  horses plodded at a gait that made Kurt step out to keep up with them.  To keep up, to drive a straight line, to hold back on the reins, was  labor for a man. It spoke well for Kurt that he had followed that old  harrow hundreds of miles, that he could stand the strain, that he loved  both the physical sense and the spiritual meaning of the toil.    Driving west, he faced a wind laden with dust as dry as powder. At every  sheeted cloud, whipping back from the hoofs of the horses and the steel  spikes of the harrow, he had to bat his eyes to keep from being blinded.  The smell of dust clogged his nostrils. As soon as he began to sweat  under the hot sun the dust caked on his face, itching, stinging,  burning. There was dust between his teeth.    Driving back east was a relief. The wind whipped the dust away from him.  And he could catch the fragrance of the newly turned soil. How brown and  clean and earthy it looked! Where the harrow had cut and ridged, the  soil did not look thirsty and parched. But that which was unharrowed  cried out for rain. No cloud in the hot sky, except the yellow clouds of  dust!    On that trip east across the field, which faced the road, Dorn saw  pedestrians in twos and threes passing by. Once he was hailed, but made  no answer. He would not have been surprised to see a crowd, yet  travelers were scarce in that region. The sight of these men, some of  them carrying bags and satchels, was disturbing to the young farmer.  Where were they going? All appeared outward bound toward the river. They  came, of course, from the little towns, the railroads, the cities. At  this season, with harvest-time near at hand, it had been in former years  no unusual sight to see strings of laborers passing by. But this year  they came earlier, and in greater numbers.    With the wind in his face, however, Dorn saw nothing but the horses and  the brown line ahead, and half the time they were wholly obscured in  yellow dust. He began thinking about Lenore Anderson, just pondering  that strange, steady look of a girl's eyes; and then he did not mind the  dust or heat or distance. Never could he be cheated of his thoughts. And  those of her, even the painful ones, gave birth to a comfort that he  knew must abide with him henceforth on lonely labors such as this,  perhaps in the lonelier watches of a soldier's duty. She had been  curious, aloof, then sympathetic; she had studied his face; she had been  an eloquent-eyed listener to his discourse on wheat. But she had not  guessed his secret. Not until her last look--strange, deep, potent--had  he guessed that secret himself.    So, with mind both busy and absent, Kurt Dorn harrowed the fallow ground  abandoned by his men; and when the day was done, with the sun setting  hot and coppery beyond the dim, dark ranges, he guided the tired horses  homeward and plodded back of them, weary and spent.    He was to learn from Morgan, at the stables, that the old man had  discharged both Andrew and Jansen. And Jansen, liberating some newly  assimilated poison, had threatened revenge. He would see that any hired  men would learn a thing or two, so that they would not sign up with  Chris Dorn. In a fury the old man had driven Jansen out into the road.    Sober and moody, Kurt put the horses away, and, washing the dust grime  from sunburnt face and hands, he went to his little attic room, where he  changed his damp and sweaty clothes. Then he went down to supper with  mind made up to be lenient and silent with his old and sorely tried  father.    Chris Dorn sat in the light of the kitchen lamps. He was a huge man with  a great, round, bullet-shaped head and a shock of gray hair and  bristling, grizzled beard. His face was broad, heavy, and seemed sodden  with dark, brooding thought. His eyes, under bushy brows, were pale  gleams of fire. He looked immovable as to both bulk and will.    Never before had Kurt Dorn so acutely felt the fixed, contrary, ruthless  nature of his parent. Never had the distance between them seemed so  great. Kurt shivered and sighed at once. Then, being hungry, he fell to  eating in silence. Presently the old man shoved his plate back, and,  wiping his face, he growled, in German:    \"I discharged Andrew and Jansen.\"    \"Yes, I know,\" replied Kurt. \"It wasn't good judgment. What'll we do for  hands?\"    \"I'll hire more. Men are coming for the harvest.\"    \"But they all belong to the I.W.W.,\" protested Kurt.    \"And what's that?\"    In scarcely subdued wrath Kurt described in detail, and to the best of  his knowledge, what the I.W.W. was, and he ended by declaring the  organization treacherous to the United States.    \"How's that?\" asked old Dorn, gruffly.    Kurt was actually afraid to tell his father, who never read newspapers,  who knew little of what was going on, that if the Allies were to win the  war it was wheat that would be the greatest factor. Instead of that he  said if the I.W.W. inaugurated strikes and disorder in the Northwest it  would embarrass the government.    \"Then I'll hire I.W.W. men,\" said old Dorn.    Kurt battled against a rising temper. This blind old man was his father.    \"But I'll not have I.W.W. men on the farm,\" retorted Kurt. \"I just  punched one I.W.W. solicitor.\"    \"I'll run this farm. If you don't like my way you can leave,\" darkly  asserted the father.    Kurt fell back in his chair and stared at the turgid, bulging forehead  and hard eyes before him. What could be behind them? Had the war brought  out a twist in his father's brain? Why were Germans so impossible?    \"My Heavens! father, would you turn me out of my home because we  disagree?\" he asked, desperately.    \"In my country sons obey their fathers or they go out for themselves.\"    \"I've not been a disobedient son,\" declared Kurt. \"And here in America  sons have more freedom--more"]]]
