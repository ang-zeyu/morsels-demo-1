And  a strange cry did the harbour of Pagasae utter, yea and Pelian Argo  herself, urging them to set forth. For in her a beam divine had been  laid which Athena had brought from an oak of Dodona and fitted in the  middle of the stem. And the heroes went to the benches one after the  other, as they had previously assigned for each to row in his place, and  took their seats in due order near their fighting gear. In the middle  sat Antaeus and mighty Heracles, and near him he laid his club, and  beneath his tread the ship's keel sank deep. And now the hawsers were  being slipped and they poured wine on the sea. But Jason with tears held  his eyes away from his fatherland. And just as youths set up a dance in  honour of Phoebus either in Pytho or haply in Ortygia, or by the waters  of Ismenus, and to the sound of the lyre round his altar all together  in time beat the earth with swiftly-moving feet; so they to the sound of  Orpheus' lyre smote with their oars the rushing sea-water, and the  surge broke over the blades; and on this side and on that the dark brine  seethed with foam, boiling terribly through the might of the sturdy  heroes. And their arms shone in the sun like flame as the ship sped on;  and ever their wake gleamed white far behind, like a path seen over a  green plain. On that day all the gods looked down from heaven upon the  ship and the might of the heroes, half-divine, the bravest of men  then sailing the sea; and on the topmost heights the nymphs of Pelion  wondered as they beheld the work of Itonian Athena, and the heroes  themselves wielding the oars. And there came down from the mountain-top  to the sea Chiron, son of Philyra, and where the white surf broke he  dipped his feet, and, often waving with his broad hand, cried out to  them at their departure, \"Good speed and a sorrowless home-return!\" And  with him his wife, bearing Peleus' son Achilles on her arm, showed the  child to his dear father.    (ll. 559-579) Now when they had left the curving shore of the harbour  through the cunning and counsel of prudent Tiphys son of Hagnias,  who skilfully handled the well-polished helm that he might guide them  steadfastly, then at length they set up the tall mast in the mastbox,  and secured it with forestays, drawing them taut on each side, and from  it they let down the sail when they had hauled it to the top-mast. And  a breeze came down piping shrilly; and upon the deck they fastened the  ropes separately round the well-polished pins, and ran quietly past the  long Tisaean headland. And for them the son of Oeagrus touched his lyre  and sang in rhythmical song of Artemis, saviour of ships, child of a  glorious sire, who hath in her keeping those peaks by the sea, and the  land of Iolcos; and the fishes came darting through the deep sea, great  mixed with small, and followed gambolling along the watery paths. And as  when in the track of the shepherd, their master, countless sheep follow  to the fold that have fed to the full of grass, and he goes before  gaily piping a shepherd's strain on Iris shrill reed; so these fishes  followed; and a chasing breeze ever bore the ship onward.    (ll. 580-591) And straightway the misty land of the Pelasgians, rich in  cornfields, sank out of sight, and ever speeding onward they passed the  rugged sides of Pelion; and the Sepian headland sank away, and Sciathus  appeared in the sea, and far off appeared Piresiae and the calm shore  of Magnesia on the mainland and the tomb of Dolops; here then in the  evening, as the wind blew against them, they put to land, and paying  honour to him at nightfall burnt sheep as victims, while the sea was  tossed by the swell: and for two days they lingered on the shore, but on  the third day they put forth the ship, spreading on high the broad sail.  And even now men call that beach Aphetae [1104] of Argo.    (ll. 592-608) Thence going forward they ran past Meliboea, escaping a  stormy beach and surf-line. And in the morning they saw Homole close at  hand leaning on the sea, and skirted it, and not long after they were  about to pass by the outfall of the river Amyrus. From there they beheld  Eurymenae and the seawashed ravines of Ossa and Olympus; next they  reached the slopes of Pallene, beyond the headland of Canastra, running  all night with the wind. And at dawn before them as they journeyed rose  Athos, the Thracian mountain, which with its topmost peak overshadows  Lemnos, even as far as Myrine, though it lies as far off as the space  that a well-trimmed merchantship would traverse up to mid-day. For them  on that day, till darkness fell, the breeze blew exceedingly fresh, and  the sails of the ship strained to it. But with the setting of the sun  the wind left them, and it was by the oars that they reached Lemnos, the  Sintian isle.    (ll. 609-639) Here the whole of the men of the people together had been  ruthlessly slain through the transgressions of the women in the year  gone by. For the men had rejected their lawful wives, loathing them, and  had conceived a fierce passion for captive maids whom they themselves  brought across the sea from their forays in Thrace; for the terrible  wrath of Cypris came upon them, because for a long time they had grudged  her the honours due. O hapless women, and insatiate in jealousy to their  own ruin! Not their husbands alone with the captives did they slay on  account of the marriage-bed, but all the males at the same time, that  they might thereafter pay no retribution for the grim murder. And of all  the women, Hypsipyle alone spared her aged father Thoas, who was king  over the people; and she sent him in a hollow chest, to drift over the  sea, if haply he should escape. And fishermen dragged him to shore at  the island of Oenoe, formerly Oenoe, but afterwards called Sicinus from  Sicinus, whom the water-nymph Oenoe bore to Thoas. Now for all the  women to tend kine, to don armour of bronze, and to cleave with the  plough-share the wheat-bearing fields, was easier than the works of  Athena, with which they were busied aforetime. Yet for all that did they  often gaze over the broad sea, in grievous fear against the Thracians'  coming. So when they saw Argo being rowed near the island, straightway  crowding in multitude from the gates of Myrine and clad in their harness  of war, they poured forth to the beach like ravening Thyiades: for they  deemed that the Thracians were come; and with them Hypsipyle, daughter  of Thoas, donned her father's harness. And they streamed down speechless  with dismay; such fear was wafted about them.    (ll. 640-652) Meantime from the ship the chiefs had sent Aethalides the  swift herald, to whose care they entrusted their messages and the wand  of Hermes, his sire, who had granted him a memory of all things, that  never grew dim; and not even now, though he has entered the unspeakable  whirlpools of Acheron, has forgetfulness swept over his soul, but its  fixed doom is to be ever changing its abode; at one time to be numbered  among the dwellers beneath the earth, at another to be in the light  of the sun among living men. But why need I tell at length tales  of Aethalides? He at that time persuaded Hypsipyle to receive the  new-comers as the day was waning into darkness; nor yet at dawn did they  loose the ship's hawsers to the breath of the north wind.    (ll. 653-656) Now the Lemnian women fared through the city and sat down  to the assembly, for Hypsipyle herself had so bidden. And when they were  all gathered together in one great throng straightway she spake among  them with stirring words:    (ll. 657-666) \"O friends, come let us grant these men gifts to  their hearts' desire, such as it is fitting that they should take on  ship-board, food and sweet wine, in order that they may steadfastly  remain outside our towers, and may not, passing among us for need's  sake, get to know us all too well, and so an evil report be widely  spread; for we have wrought a terrible deed and in nowise will it be to  their liking, should they learn it. Such is our counsel now, but if any  of you can devise a better plan let her rise, for it was on this account  that I summoned you hither.\"    (ll. 667-674) Thus she spake and sat upon her father's seat of stone,  and then rose up her dear nurse Polyxo, for very age halting upon her  withered feet, bowed over a staff, and she was eager to address them.  Near her were seated four virgins, unwedded, crowned with white hair.  And she stood in the midst of the assembly and from her bent back she  feebly raised her neck and spake thus:    (ll. 675-696) \"Gifts, as Hypsipyle herself wishes, let us send to the  strangers, for it is better to give them. But for you what device have  ye to get profit of your life if the Thracian host fall upon us, or some  other foe, as often happens among men, even as now this company is come  unforeseen? But if one of the blessed gods should turn this aside yet  countless other woes, worse than battle, remain behind, when the aged  women die off and ye younger ones, without children, reach hateful old  age. How then will ye live, hapless ones? Will your oxen of their  own accord yoke themselves for the deep plough-lands and draw the  earth-cleaving share through the fallow, and forthwith, as the year  comes round, reap the harvest? Assuredly, though the fates till now have  shunned me in horror, I deem that in the coming year I shall put on the  garment of earth, when I have received my meed of burial even so as is  right, before the evil days draw near. But I bid you who are younger  give good heed to this. For now at your feet a way of escape lies open,  if ye trust to the strangers the care of your homes and all your stock  and your glorious city.\"   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/831"],[0,"Four Arthurian Romances (#5)"],[1,"will quickly find me ready for battle. And you may be  sure without fail that we two shall fight until he defeat me, or I him.  And if possible, I shall be back by the third day, when you will see me  home again either joyous or sad, I know not which. Lady, I cannot delay  longer, for I must follow after the knight. I go. To God I commend you.\"  And the Queen in like manner more than five hundred rimes commends him  to God, that he may defend him from harm.    (Vv. 275-310.) Erec leaves the Queen and ceases not to pursue the  knight. The Queen remains in the wood, where now the King had come up  with the Stag. The King himself outstripped the others at the death.  Thus they killed and took the White Stag, and all returned, carrying the  Stag, till they came again to Cardigan. After supper, when the knights  were all in high spirits throughout the hall, the King, as the custom  was, because he had taken the Stag, said that he would bestow the kiss  and thus observe the custom of the Stag. Throughout the court a great  murmur is heard: each one vows and swears to his neighbour that it  shall not be done without the protest of sword or ashen lance. Each one  gallantly desires to contend that his lady is the fairest in the hall.  Their conversation bodes no good, and when my lord Gawain heard it, you  must know that it was not to his liking. Thus he addressed the King:  \"Sire,\" he says, \"your knights here are greatly aroused, and all their  talk is of this kiss. They say that it shall never be bestowed without  disturbance and a fight.\" And the King wisely replied to him: \"Fair  nephew Gawain, give me counsel now, sparing my honour and my dignity,  for I have no mind for any disturbance.\"    (Vv. 311-341.) To the council came a great part of the best knights of  the court. King Yder [14] arrived, who was the first to be summoned, and  after him King Cadoalant, who was very wise and bold. Kay and Girflet  came too, and King Amauguin was there, and a great number of other  knights were there with them. The discussion was in process when the  Queen arrived and told them of the adventure which she had met in the  forest, of the armed knight whom she saw, and of the malicious little  dwarf who had struck her damsel on the bare hand with his whip, and who  struck Erec, too, in the same way an ugly blow on the face; but that  Erec followed the knight to obtain vengeance, or increase his shame, and  how he said that if possible he would be back by the third day. \"Sire,\"  says the Queen to the King, \"listen to me a moment. If these knights  approve what I say, postpone this kiss until the third day, when Erec  will be back.\" There is none who does not agree with her, and the King  himself approves her words.    (Vv. 342-392.) Erec steadily follows the knight who was armed and the  dwarf who had struck him until they come to a well placed town, strong  and fine [15]. They enter straight through the gate. Within the town  there was great joy of knights and ladies, of whom there were many and  fair. Some were feeding in the streets their sparrow-hawks and moulting  falcons; others were giving an airing to their tercels, [16] their mewed  birds, and young yellow hawks; others play at dice or other game of  chance, some at chess, and some at backgammon. The grooms in front of  the stables are rubbing down and currying the horses. The ladies are  bedecking themselves in their boudoirs. As soon as they see the knight  coming, whom they recognised with his dwarf and damsel, they go out  three by three to meet him. The knight they all greet and salute, but  they give no heed to Erec, for they did not know him. Erec follows close  upon the knight through the town, until he saw him lodged. Then, very  joyful, he passed on a little farther until he saw reclining upon some  steps a vavasor [17] well on in years. He was a comely man, with white  locks, debonair, pleasing, and frank. There he was seated all alone,  seeming to be engaged in thought. Erec took him for an honest man who  would at once give him lodging. When he turned through the gate into the  yard, the vavasor ran to meet him, and saluted him before Erec had said  a word. \"Fair sir,\" says he, \"be welcome. If you will deign to lodge  with me, here is my house all ready for you.\" Erec replies: \"Thank you!  For no other purpose have I come; I need a lodging place this night.\"    (Vv. 393-410.) Erec dismounts from his horse, which the host himself  leads away by the bridle, and does great honour to his guest. The  vavasor summons his wife and his beautiful daughter, who were busy in a  work-room--doing I know not what. The lady came out with her daughter,  who was dressed in a soft white under-robe with wide skirts hanging  loose in folds. Over it she wore a white linen garment, which completed  her attire. And this garment was so old that it was full of holes down  the sides. Poor, indeed, was her garb without, but within her body was  fair.    (Vv. 411-458.) The maid was charming, in sooth, for Nature had used all  her skill in forming her. Nature herself had marvelled more than five  hundred times how upon this one occasion she had succeeded in creating  such a perfect thing. Never again could she so strive successfully to  reproduce her pattern. Nature bears witness concerning her that never  was so fair a creature seen in all the world. In truth I say that never  did Iseut the Fair have such radiant golden tresses that she could be  compared with this maiden. [18] The complexion of her forehead and face  was clearer and more delicate than the lily. But with wondrous art her  face with all its delicate pallor was suffused with a fresh crimson  which Nature had bestowed upon her. Her eyes were so bright that they  seemed like two stars. God never formed better nose, mouth, and eyes.  What shall I say of her beauty? In sooth, she was made to be looked at;  for in her one could have seen himself as in a mirror. So she came forth  from the work-room: and when she saw the knight whom she had never seen  before, she drew back a little, because she did not know him, and in her  modesty she blushed. Erec, for his part, was amazed when he beheld such  beauty in her, and the vavasor said to her: \"Fair daughter dear, take  this horse and lead him to the stable along with my own horses. See that  he lack for nothing: take off his saddle and bridle, give him oats and  hay, look after him and curry him, that he may be in good condition.\"    (Vv. 459-546) The maiden takes the horse, unlaces his breast-strap, and  takes off his bridle and saddle. Now the horse is in good hands, for she  takes excellent care of him. She throws a halter over his head, rubs him  down, curries him, and makes him comfortable. Then she ties him to the  manger and puts plenty of fresh sweet hay and oats before him. Then she  went back to her father, who said to her: \"Fair daughter dear, take now  this gentleman by the hand and show him all honour. Take him by the hand  upstairs.\" The maiden did not delay (for in her there was no lack of  courtesy) and led him by the hand upstairs. The lady had gone before and  prepared the house. She had laid embroidered cushions and spreads upon  the couches, where they all three sat down Erec with his host beside  him, and the maiden opposite. Before them, the fire burns brightly. The  vavasor had only one man-servant, and no maid for chamber or kitchen  work. This one man was busy in the kitchen preparing meat and birds for  supper. A skilful cook was he, who knew how to prepare meal in boiling  water and birds on the spit. When he had the meal prepared in accordance  with the orders which had been given him, he brought them water for  washing in two basins. The table was soon set, cloths, bread, and wine  set out, and they sat down to supper. They had their fill of all they  needed. When they had finished and when the table was cleared, Erec thus  addressed his host, the master of the house: \"Tell me, fair host.\" he  asked, \"why your daughter, who is so passing fair and clever, is so  poorly and unsuitably attired.\" \"Fair friend,\" the vavasor replies,  \"many a man is harmed by poverty, and even so am I. I grieve to see  her so poorly clad, and yet I cannot help it, for I have been so long  involved in war that I have lost or mortgaged or sold all my land. [19]  And yet she would be well enough dressed if I allowed her to accept  everything that people wish to give her. The lord of this castle himself  would have dressed her in becoming fashion and would have done her every  manner of favour, for she is his niece and he is a count. And there is  no nobleman in this region, however rich and powerful, who would not  willingly have taken her to wife had I given my consent. But I am  waiting yet for some better occasion, when God shall bestow still  greater honour upon her, when fortune shall bring hither some king or  count who shall lead her away, for there is under Heaven no king or  count who would be ashamed of my daughter, who is so wondrous fair that  her match cannot be found. Fair, indeed, she is; but yet greater far  than her beauty, is her intelligence. God never created any one so  discreet and of such open heart. When I have my daughter beside me, I  don't care a marble about all the rest of the world. She is my delight  and my pastime, she is my joy and comfort, my wealth and my treasure,  and I love nothing so much as her own precious self.\"    (Vv. 547-690.) When Erec had listened to all that his host told him, he  asked him to inform him whence came all the chivalry that was quartered  in the town. For there was no street or house so poor and small but it  was full of knights and ladies and squires. And the vavasor said to him:  \"Fair friend, these are the nobles of the country round; all, both young  and old, have come to a fete which is to be held in this town tomorrow;  therefore the houses are so full. When they shall all have gathered,  there will be a"]]]
