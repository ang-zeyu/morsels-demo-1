In  royal historical inscriptions the kings often invoke the gods in  threes, though they never call any one three a triad or trinity. It  seems as if this arrangement of gods in threes was assumed to be of  divine origin.  In the Fourth Tablet of Creation, one triad  \"Anu-Bel-Ea\" is actually mentioned, and in the Fifth Tablet, another  is indicated, \"Sin-Shamash-Ishtar.\" In these triads Anu represents the  sky or heaven, Bel or Enlil the region under the sky and including the  earth, Ea the underworld, Sin the Moon, Shamash the Sun, and Ishtar  the star Venus. When the universe was finally constituted several  other great gods existed, e.g., Nusku, the Fire-god, Enurta,  [1] a solar god, Nergal, the god of war and handicrafts, Nabu, the god  of learning, Marduk of Babylon, the great national god of Babylonia,  and Ashur, the great national god of Assyria.    [Footnote 1: Formerly known as Ninip.]    When Marduk had arranged heaven and earth, and had established the gods  in their places, the gods complained that their existence was barren,  because they lacked worshippers at their shrines and offerings. To make  a way out of this difficulty Marduk devised another \"cunning plan,\" and  announced his intention of creating man out of \"blood and bone\" DAMI  ISSIMTUM. We have already quoted (see p. 11) the statement of Berosus  that man was created out of the blood of a god mixed with earth; here,  then, is the authority for his words. Marduk made known to Ea his  intention of creating man, and Ea suggested that if one of the gods were  sacrificed the remainder of them should be set free from service,  presumably to Marduk. Thereupon Marduk summons a council of the gods,  and asks them to name the instigator of the fight in which he himself  was the victor. In reply the gods named Kingu, Tiamat's second husband,  whom they seized forthwith, and bound with fetters and carried to Ea,  and then having \"inflicted punishment upon him they let his blood.\" From  Kingu's blood Ea fashioned mankind for the service of the gods.    Now among the texts which have been found on the tablets at Kal'at  Sharkat is an account of the creation of man which differs from the  version given in the Seven Tablets of Creation, but has two features in  common with it. These two features are: (1) the council of the gods to  discuss the creation of man; (2) the sacrifice which the gods had to  make for the creation of man. In the variant version two (or more) gods  are sacrificed, _Ilu Nagar Ilu Nagar_, i.e., \"the workmen gods,\" about  whom nothing is known. The place of sacrifice is specified with some  care, and it is said to be \"Uzu-mu-a, or the bond of heaven and earth.\"  Uzu-mu-a may be the bolt with which Marduk locked the two halves of  Tiamat into place.    The Anunnaki, wishing to give an expression of their admiration for  Marduk's heroism, decided to build him a shrine or temple. To this  Marduk agreed, and chose Babylon, i.e., the \"Gate of God,\" for its site.  The Anunnaki themselves made the bricks, and they built the great temple  of E-Sagila at Babylon. When the temple was finished, Marduk re-enacted  the scene of creation; for, as he had formerly assigned to each god his  place in the heavens, so now he assigned to each god his place in  E-Sagila. The tablet ends with a long hymn of praise which the Anunnaki  sang to Marduk, and describes the summoning of an assembly of the gods  to proclaim ceremonially the great Fifty Names of this god. Thus the  gods accepted the absolute supremacy of Marduk.    From the above it is clear that a dispute broke out between Marduk and  the gods after he had created them, and the tradition of it has made its  way into the religious literatures of the Hebrews, Syrians, Arabs, Copts  and Abyssinians. The cuneiform texts tell us nothing about the cause of  the dispute, but tradition generally ascribes it to the creation of man  by the supreme God; and it is probable that all the apocryphal stories  which describe the expulsion from heaven of the angels who contended  against God under the leadership of Satan, or Satnael, or Iblis, are  derived from a Babylonian original which has not yet been found. The  \"Fifty Names,\" or laudatory epithets mentioned above, find parallels in  \"Seventy-five Praises of Ra,\" sung by the Egyptians under the XIXth  dynasty, [1] and in the \"Ninety-nine Beautiful Names of Allah,\" which  are held in such great esteem by the Muhammadans. [2] The respect in  which the Fifty Names were held by the Babylonians is well shown by the  work of the Epilogue on the Seventh Tablet, where it is said, \"Let them  be held in remembrance, let the first-comer (i.e., any and every man)  proclaim them; let the wise and the understanding consider them  together. Let the father repeat them and teach them to his son. Let them  be in the ears of the herdsman and the shepherd.\"    [Footnote 1: See Naville, _La Litanie du Soleil_, Paris, 1875,  Plate ii ff.]    [Footnote 2: See _Kur'an_, Surah vii, v. 179. That there were  ninety-nine Beautiful Names of God rests on the authority of Abu  Hurairah, who repeats the statement as made by Muhammad the Prophet.]    The object of the writer of the Fifty Names was to show that Marduk  was the \"Lord of the gods,\" that the power, qualities and attributes  of every god were enshrined in him, and that they all were merely  forms of him. This fact is proved by the tablet (No. 47,406), [1]  which contains a long list of gods who are equated with Marduk in his  various forms.[2] The tendency in the later Babylonian religion to  make Marduk the god above all gods has led many to think that  monotheistic conceptions were already in existence among the  Babylonians as early as the period of the First Dynasty, about 2000  B.C.  It is indisputable that Marduk obtained his pre-eminence in the  Babylonian Pantheon at this early period. But some authorities deny  the existence of monotheistic conceptions among the Babylonians at  that time, and attribute Marduk's kingship of the gods to the  influence of the political situation of the time, when Babylon first  became the capital of the country, and mistress of the greater part of  the known world.  Material for deciding this question is wanting, but  it may be safely said that whatever monotheistic conceptions existed  at that time, their acceptance was confined entirely to the priests  and scribes. They certainly find no expression in the popular  religious texts.    [Footnote 1: Published by King, _Cuneiform Texts_, Part XXV,  Plate 50.]    [Footnote 2: Thus he is equated with En-Urta, Nergal, En-lil, Nabu,  Sin, Shamash, Adad, etc.]    Both the source of the original form of the Legend of the Fight  between Ea and Apsu, and Marduk and Tiamat, and the period of its  composition are unknown, but there is no doubt that in one form or  another it persisted in Mesopotamia for thousands of years. The  apocryphal book of \"Bel and the Dragon\" shows that a form of the  Legend was in existence among the Babylonian Jews long after the  Captivity, and the narrative relating to it associates it with  religious observances.  But there is no foundation whatsoever for the  assertion which has so often been made that the Two Accounts of the  Creation which are given in the early chapters in Genesis are derived  from the Seven Tablets of Creation described in the preceding  pages. It is true that there are many points of resemblance between  the narratives in cuneiform and Hebrew, and these often illustrate  each other, but the fundamental conceptions of the Babylonian and  Hebrew accounts are essentially different.  In the former the earliest  beings that existed were foul demons and devils, and the God of  Creation only appears at a later period, but in the latter the  conception of God is that of a Being Who existed in and from the  beginning, Almighty and Alone, and the devils of chaos and evil are  His servants.    [Illustration: Marduk destroying Tiamat, who is here represented in the  form of a huge serpent. From a seal-cylinder in the British Museum.  [No. 89,589.]]    Among the primitive Semitic peoples there were probably many versions of  the story of the Creation; and the narrative told by the Seven Tablets  is, no doubt, one of them in a comparatively modern form. It is quite  clear that the Account of the Creation given in the Seven Tablets is  derived from very ancient sources, and a considerable amount of literary  evidence is now available for reconstructing the history of the Legend.  Thus in the Sumerian Account the narrative of the exploits of the hero  called ZIUSUDU [1] begins with a description of the Creation and then  goes on to describe a Flood, and there is little doubt that certain  passages in this text are the originals of the Babylonian version as  given in the Seven Tablets. In the Story of ZIUSUDU, however, there is  no mention of any Dragon. And there is reason to think that the Legend  of the Dragon had originally nothing whatever to do with the Creation,  for the texts of fragments of two distinct Accounts [2] of the Creation  describe a fight between a Dragon and some deity other than Marduk. In  other Accounts the Dragon bears a strong resemblance to the Leviathan of  Psalm civ, 26; Job xli, 1. In the one text he is said to be 50 _biru_  [3] in length, and 1 _biru_ in thickness; his mouth was 6 cubits (about  9 feet) wide, and the circumference of his ears 12 cubits (18 feet). He  was slain by a god whose name is unknown, and the blood continued to  flow from his body for three years, three months, one day and one night.  In the second text the Dragon is 60 _biru_ long and his thickness is 30  _biru_; the diameter of each eye is half a _biru_, and his paws are 20  _biru_ long. Thus there is every reason for believing that the Legend as  it is given in the Seven Tablets is the work of some editor, who added  the Legend of the Creation to the Legend of the Dragon"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9922"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

The leopard of Southern Africa is known among the Cape colonists by the  name of tiger; but is, in fact, the real leopard, the _Felis jubata_ of  naturalists, well known for the beauty of its shape and spotted skin,  and the treachery and fierceness of its disposition. The animal called  leopard (_luipaard_) by the Cape Dutch boors, is a species of the  panther, and is inferior to the real leopard in size and beauty. Both of  them are dreaded in the mountainous districts on account of the ravages  which they occasionally commit among the flocks, and on the young cattle  and horses in the breeding season.    The South African panther is a cowardly animal, and, like the hyena,  flies from the face of man. The leopard also, though his low,  half-smothered growl is frequently heard by night, as he prowls like an  evil spirit around the cottage or the kraal, will seldom or never attack  mankind, (children excepted,) unless previously assailed or exasperated.  When hunted, as he usually is with dogs, he instinctively betakes  himself to a tree, when he falls an easy prey to the shot of the  huntsman. The leopard, however, though far inferior in strength and  intrepidity to the lion, is yet an exceedingly active and furious  animal; and when driven to extremity, proves himself occasionally an  antagonist not to be trifled with. The colonists relate many instances  of arduous and even fatal encounters with the hunted leopard. The  following is one of these adventures, which occurred in a frontier  district in 1822, as described by one of the two individuals so  perilously engaged in it.    Two boors returning from hunting the Hartebeest, (_antelope bubalis_,)  fell in with a leopard in a mountain ravine, and immediately gave chase  to him. The animal at first endeavoured to escape by clambering up a  precipice; but being hotly pressed, and slightly wounded by a  musket-ball, he turned upon his pursuers with that frantic ferocity  which on such emergencies he frequently displays, and springing upon the  man who had fired at him, tore him from his horse to the ground, biting  him at the same time very severely in the shoulder, and tearing his face  and arms with his talons. The other hunter, seeing the danger of his  comrade, (he was, if I mistake not, his brother,) sprung from his horse,  and attempted to shoot the leopard through the head; but, whether owing  to trepidation, or the fear of wounding his friend, or the sudden  motions of the animal, he unfortunately missed.    The leopard, abandoning his prostrate enemy, darted with redoubled fury  upon this second antagonist; and so fierce and sudden was his onset,  that before the boor could stab him with his hunting-knife, he had  struck him in the eyes with his claws, and torn the scalp over his  forehead. In this frightful condition the hunter grappled with the  raging beast, and struggling for life, they rolled together down a steep  declivity. All this passed so rapidly, that the other boor had scarcely  time to recover from the confusion in which his feline foe had left him,  to seize his gun, and rush forward to aid his comrade, when he beheld  them rolling together down the steep bank in mortal conflict. In a few  moments he was at the bottom with them, but too late to save the life of  his friend. The leopard had torn open the jugular vein, and so  dreadfully mangled the throat of the unfortunate man, that his death was  inevitable; and his comrade had only the melancholy satisfaction of  completing the destruction of the savage beast, already exhausted with  several deep wounds in the breast from the desperate knife of the  expiring huntsman.--_London Weekly Review_.           *       *       *       *       *      GLOAMING.

There is a beauty in the grey twilight,      Which minds unmusical can never know,      A holy quietude, that yields to woe      A pulseless pleasure, fraught with pure delight:      The aspect of the mountains huge, that brave      And bear upon their breasts the rolling storms;      And the soft twinkling of the stars, that pave      Heaven's highway with their bright and burning forms;      The rustle of the dark boughs overhead:      The murmurs of the torrent far away;      The last notes of the blackbird, and the bay      Of sullen watch-dog, from the far farm-stead--      All waken thoughts of Being's early day,      Loves quench'd, hopes past, friends lost, and pleasures fled.    _Blackwood's Magazine_.           *       *       *       *       *      ON READING NEW BOOKS.      There is a fashion in reading as well as in dress, which lasts only for  a season. One would imagine that books were, like women, the worse for  being old;[2] that they have a pleasure in being read for the first  time; that they open their leaves more cordially; that the spirit of  enjoyment wears out with the spirit of novelty; and that, after a  certain age, it is high time to put them on the shelf. This conceit  seems to be followed up in practice. What is it to me that another--that  hundreds or thousands have in all ages read a work? Is it on this  account the less likely to give me pleasure, because it has delighted so  many others? Or can I taste this pleasure by proxy? Or am I in any  degree the wiser for their knowledge? Yet this might appear to be the  inference. _Their_ having read the work may be said to act upon us by  sympathy, and the knowledge which so many other persons have of its  contents deadens our curiosity and interest altogether. We set aside the  subject as one on which others have made up their minds for us, (as if  we really could have ideas in their heads,) and are quite on the alert  for the next new work, teeming hot from the press, which we shall be the  first to read, to criticise, and pass an opinion on. Oh, delightful! To  cut open the leaves, to inhale the fragrance of the scarcely-dry paper,  to examine the type, to see who is the printer, (which is some clue to  the value that is set upon the work,) to launch out into regions of  thought and invention never trod till now, and to explore characters  that never met a human eye before--this is a luxury worth sacrificing a  dinner party, or a few hours of a spare morning to. Who, indeed, when  the work is critical and full of expectation, would venture to dine out,  or to face a _coterie_ of blue stockings in the evening, without having  gone through this ordeal, or at least without, hastily turning over a  few of the first pages while dressing, to be able to say that the  beginning does not promise much, or to tell the name of the heroine?        [2] \"Laws are not like women, the worse for being old.\"--_The      Duke of Buckingham's Speech in the House of Lords, in Charles      the Second's time_.    A new work is something in our power; we mount the bench, and sit in  judgment on it; we can damn or recommend it to others at pleasure, can  decry or extol it to the skies, and can give an answer to those who have  not yet read it, and expect an account of it; and thus show our  shrewdness and the independence of our taste before the world have had  time to form an opinion. If we cannot write ourselves, we become, by  busying ourselves about it, a kind of _accessaries after the fact_.  Though not the parent of the bantling that \"has just come into this  breathing world, scarce half made up,\" without the aid of criticism and  puffing, yet we are the gossips and foster-nurses on the occasion, with  all the mysterious significance and self-importance of the tribe. If we  wait, we must take our report from others; if we make haste, we may  dictate ours to them. It is not a race, then, for priority of  information, but for precedence in tattling and dogmatising. The work  last out is the first that people talk and inquire about. It is the  subject on the _tapis_--the cause that is pending. It is the last  candidate for success, (other claims have been disposed of,) and appeals  for this success to us, and us alone. Our predecessors can have nothing  to say to this question, however they may have anticipated us on others;  future ages, in all probability, will not trouble their heads about it;  we are the panel. How hard, then, not to avail ourselves of our  immediate privilege to give sentence of life or death--to seem in  ignorance of what every one else is full of--to be behind-hand with the  polite, the knowing, and fashionable part of mankind--to be at a loss  and dumb-founded, when all around us are in their glory, and figuring  away, on no other ground than that of having read a work that we have  not! Books that are to be written hereafter cannot be criticised by us;  those that were written formerly have been criticised long ago; but a  new book is the property, the prey of ephemeral criticism, which it  darts triumphantly upon; there is a raw thin air of ignorance and  uncertainty about it, not filled up by any recorded opinion; and  curiosity, impertinence, and vanity rush eagerly into the vacuum. A new  book is the fair field for petulance and coxcombry to gather laurels  in--the butt set up for roving opinion to aim at. Can we wonder, then,  that the circulating libraries are besieged by literary dowagers and  their grand-daughters, when a new novel is announced? That mail-coach  copies of the _Edinburgh Review_ are or were coveted? That the  manuscript of the _Waverley_ romances is sent abroad in time for the  French, German, or even Italian translation to appear on the same day as  the"]]]
