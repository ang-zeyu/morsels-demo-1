Through a grassy lane leading from the main street, he walked down to  the river with the pole on his shoulder.    He was not destined to solitude, for under a tree whose branches hung  over the river sat a young man, perhaps twenty-five years of age, with a  book in his hand.          CHAPTER VI. HERBERT'S GOOD LUCK.        \"Good-morning,\" said the young man, pleasantly.    \"Good-morning,\" answered Herbert, politely.    He recognized the young man, though he had never seen him before, as  a visitor from the city, who was boarding at the hotel, if the village  tavern could be so designated. He seemed to be a studious young man, for  he always had a book in his hand. He had a pleasant face, but was pale  and slender, and was evidently in poor health.    \"I see you are going to try your luck at fishing,\" said the young man.    \"Yes, sir; I have nothing else to do, and that brings me here.\"    \"I, too, have nothing else to do; but I judge from your appearance that  you have not the same reason for being idle.\"    \"What is that, sir?\"    \"Poor health.\"    \"No, sir; I have never been troubled in that way.\"    \"You are fortunate. Health is a blessing not to be overestimated. It is  better than money.\"    \"I suppose it is, sir; but at present I think I should value a little  money.\"    \"Are you in want of it?\" asked the young man, earnestly.    \"Yes, sir; I have just lost my place in the post office.\"    \"I think I have seen you in the post office.\"    \"Yes, sir; my mother had charge of the office till two weeks since,  when it was transferred to Mr. Graham. He employed me to attend to the  duties, and serve the customers in the store, till Saturday night, when  I was succeeded by his son, who had just returned from the city.\"    \"Your mother is a widow, is she not?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"I know where you live; I have had it pointed out to me. Your father  served in the war, did he not?\"    \"Yes, sir; and the injuries he received hastened his death.\"    The young man looked thoughtful. Then he said: \"How much did Mr. Graham  pay you for your services?\"    \"Three dollars a week.\"    \"That was not--excuse the question--all you and your mother had to  depend upon, was it?\"    \"Not quite; mother receives a pension of eight dollars per month.\"    \"Five dollars a week altogether--that is very little.\"    \"It is only two dollars now, sir.\"    \"True; but you have health and strength, and those will bring money.  In one respect you are more fortunate than I. You have a mother--I have  neither father nor mother.\"    \"I'm sorry for you, sir.\"    \"Thank you; anyone is to be pitied who has lost his parents. Now, as I  have asked about your affairs, it is only fair that I should tell you  about myself. To begin with, I am rich. Don't look envious, for there  is something to counterbalance. I am of feeble constitution, and the  doctors say that my lungs are affected. I have studied law, but the  state of my health has obliged me to give up, for the present at least,  the practice of my profession.\"    \"But if you are rich you do not need to practice,\" said Herbert, who may  be excused for still thinking his companion's lot a happy one.    \"No, I do not need to practice my profession, so far as the earning of  money is concerned; but I want something to occupy my mind. The doctors  say I ought to take considerable out-door exercise; but I suppose my  physical condition makes me indolent, for my chief exercise has been,  thus far, to wander to the banks of the river and read under the trees.\"    \"That isn't very severe exercise,\" said Herbert, smiling.    \"No; still it keeps me out in the open air, and that is something. Now  tell me, what are your plans?\"    \"My hope is to find something to do that will enable me to help mother;  but there doesn't seem much chance of finding anything in Wayneboro. Do  you think I could get a place in the city?\"    \"You might; but even if you did, you would find it difficult to earn  your own living, and there would be no chance of your helping your  mother.\"    Herbert, though naturally sanguine and hopeful, looked sober. Just  then he had a bite, and drew out a good-sized pickerel. This gave a new  direction to his thoughts, and he exclaimed, triumphantly:    \"Look at this pickerel! He must weigh over two pounds.\"    \"All of that,\" said the young man, rising and examining the fish with  interest. \"Let me use your pole, and see what luck I have.\"    \"Certainly.\"    The young man, some ten minutes later, succeeded in catching a smaller  pickerel, perhaps half the size of Herbert's.    \"That will do for me,\" he said, \"though it doesn't come up to your  catch.\"    For two hours Herbert and his friend alternately used the pole, and the  result was quite a handsome lot of fish.    \"You have more fish than you want,\" said the young man. \"You had better  bring what you don't want to the hotel. I heard the landlord say he  would like to buy some.\"    \"That would suit me,\" said Herbert. \"If he wants fish, I want money.\"    \"Come along with me, then. Really, I don't know when I have passed a  forenoon so pleasantly. Usually I get tired of my own company, and the  day seems long to me. I believe I see my way clear to a better way of  spending my time. You say you want a place. How would you like me for an  employer?\"    \"I am sure I should like you, but you are not in any business.\"    \"No,\" said the young man, smiling; \"or, rather, my business is the  pursuit of health and pleasure just now. In that I think you can help  me.\"    \"I shall be very glad to, if I can, Mr.---\"    \"My name is George Melville. Let me explain my idea to you. I want your  company to relieve my solitude. In your company I shall have enterprise  enough to go hunting and fishing, and follow out in good faith my  doctor's directions. What do you say?\"    Herbert smiled.    \"I would like that better than being in the post office,\" he said. \"It  would seem like being paid for having a good time.\"    \"How much would you consider your services worth?\" asked Mr. Melville.    \"I am content to leave that to you,\" said Herbert.    \"Suppose we say six dollars a week, then?\"    \"Six dollars a week!\" exclaimed Herbert, amazed.    \"Isn't that enough?\" asked Melville, smiling.    \"It is more than I can earn. Mr. Graham thought he was over-paying me  with three dollars a week.\"    \"You will find me a different man from Mr. Graham, Herbert. I am aware  that six dollars is larger pay than is generally given to boys of your  age. But I can afford to pay it, and I have no doubt you will find the  money useful.\"    \"It will quite set us on our feet again, Mr. Melville,\" said Herbert,  earnestly. \"You are very generous.\"    \"Oh, you don't know what a hard taskmaster you may find me,\" said the  young man, playfully. \"By the way, I consider that you have already  entered upon your duties. To-day is the first day. Now come to the hotel  with me, and see what you can get for the fish. I happen to know that  two of the guests, a lady and her daughter, are anxious for a good fish  dinner and, as there is no market here, I think the landlord will be  glad to buy from you.\"    Mr. Melville was right. Mr. Barton, the landlord, purchased the fish  that Herbert had to sell, for sixty cents, which he promptly paid.    \"Don't that pay you for your morning's work?\" asked Melville.    \"I don't know but the money ought to go to you, Mr. Melville,\" said  Herbert, \"as I am now in your employ. Besides, you caught a part of  them.\"    \"I waive all claim to compensation,\" said the young man, \"though it  would be a novel sensation to receive money for services rendered. What  will you say, Herbert, when I tell you that I never earned a dollar in  my life?\"    Herbert looked incredulous.    \"It is really true,\" said George Melville, \"my life has been passed at  school and college, and I have never had occasion to work for money.\"    \"You are in luck, then.\"    \"I don't know that; I think those who work for the money they receive  are happy. Tell me, now, don't you feel more satisfaction in the sixty  cents you have just been paid because you have earned it?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"I thought so. The happiest men are those who are usefully employed.  Don't forget that, and never sigh for the opportunity to lead an idle  life. But I suppose your dinner is ready. You may go home, and come back  at three o'clock.\"    \"Very well, sir.\"    Herbert made good time going home. He was eager to tell his mother the  good news of his engagement.          CHAPTER VII. EBEN GROWS ENVIOUS.        \"Well, mother,\" said Herbert, as he entered the house, \"I have brought  you enough fish for dinner.\"    \"I waited to see what luck you would have, Herbert, and therefore have  not got dinner ready. You will have to wait a little while.\"    \"I shall be all the hungrier, mother,\" said Herbert.    Mrs. Carr could not help noticing the beaming look on her som's face.    \"You look as if you had received a legacy, Herbert,\" she said.    Herbert laughed.    \"There it is,\" he said, displaying the sixty cents he had received from  the landlord.    \"There are ten cents more than I should have received for a whole day's  work at the store,\" he said.    \"Where did you get it, Herbert?\"    \"I sold a mess of fish to Mr. Barton, of the hotel.\"    \"You must have had good luck in fishing,\" said his mother, looking  pleased.    \"I had help, mother. Mr. Melville, the young man from the city, who  boards at the hotel, helped me fish.\"    \"Well, Herbert, you have made a good beginning. I couldn't help feeling  a little depressed when you left me this morning, reflecting that we  had but my pension to depend upon. It seemed so unlucky that Eben Graham  should have come home just at this time to deprive you of your place in  the store.\"    \"It was a piece of good luck for me, mother.\"    \"I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5760"],[0,"Two Trips to Gorilla Land and the Cataracts of the Congo, Volume 1 (#5)"],[1,"gay, a  dismal livid gloom palled the eastern sky, descending to the  watery horizon; and the estuary, beneath the sable hangings which  began to depend from the cloud canopy, gleamed with a ghastly  whitish green. Distant thunders rumbled and muttered, and flashes  of the broadest sheets inclosed fork and chain lightning; the  lift-fire zigzagged in tangled skeins here of chalk-white  threads, there of violet wires, to the surface of earth and sea.  Presently nimbus-step, tier and canopy, gradually breaking up,  formed a low arch regular as the BifrÃ¶st bridge which Odin  treads, spanning a space between the horizon, ninety degrees  broad and more. The sharply cut soffit, which was thrown out in  darkest relief by the dim and sallow light of the underlying sky,  waxed pendent and ragged, as though broken by a torrent of storm.  What is technically called the \"ox-eye,\" the \"egg of the  tornado,\" appeared in a fragment of space, glistening below the  gloomy rain-arch. The wind ceased to blow; every sound was hushed  as though Nature were nerving herself, silent for the throe, and  our looks said, \"In five minutes it will be down upon us.\" And  now it comes. A cold blast smelling of rain, and a few drops or  rather splashes, big as gooseberries and striking with a blow,  are followed by a howling squall, sharp and sudden puffs,  pulsations and gusts; at length a steady gush like a rush of  steam issues from that awful arch, which, after darkening the  heavens like an eclipse, collapses in fragmentary torrents of  blinding rain. In the midst of the spoon-drift we see, or we  think we see, \"La Junon\" gliding like a phantom-ship towards the  river mouth. The lightning seems to work its way into our eyes,  the air-shaking thunder rolls and roars around our very ears; the  oars are taken in utterly useless, the storm-wind sweeps the boat  before it at full speed as though it had been a bit of straw.  Selim and I sat with a large mackintosh sheet over our hunched  backs, thus offering a breakwater to the waves; happily for us,  the billow-heads were partly cut off and carried away bodily by  the raging wind, and the opened fountains of the firmament beat  down the breakers before they could grow to their full growth.  Otherwise we were lost men; the southern shore was still two  miles distant, and, as it was, the danger was not despicable.  These tornadoes are harmless enough to a cruiser, and under a  good roof men bless them. But H.M.S. \"Heron\" was sunk by one, and  the venture of a cranky gig laden Ã  fleur d'eau is what some call  \"tempting Providence.\"    Stunned with thunder, dazzled by the vivid flashes of white  lightning, dizzy with the drive of the boat, and drenched by the  torrents and washings from above and below, we were not a little  pleased to feel the storm-wind slowly lulling, as it had cooled  the heated regions ahead, and to see the sky steadily clearing up  behind, as the blackness of the cloud, rushing with racer speed,  passed over and beyond us. The increasing stillness of the sea  raised our spirits;              \"For nature, only loud when she destroys,                 Is silent when she fashions.\"    But the storm-demon's name is \"Tornado\" (Cyclone): it will  probably veer round to the south, where, meeting the dry clouds  that are gathering and massing there, it will involve us in  another fray. Meanwhile we are safe, and as the mist clears off  we sight the southern shore. The humbler elevation, notably  different from the northern bank, is dotted with villages and  clearings. The PÃ©ninsula de Marie-AmÃ©lie, alias \"Round Corner,\"  the innermost southern point visible from the mouth, projects to  the north-north-east in a line of scattered islets at high tides,  ending in Le bois FÃ©tiche, a clump of tall trees somewhat  extensively used for picnics. It has served for worse purposes,  as the name shows.    A total of two hours landed me from the Comte de Paris Roads upon  the open sandy strip that supports Denistown; the single broad  street runs at right angles from the river, the better to catch  the sea-breeze, and most of the huts have open gables, a practice  strongly to be recommended. Le Roi would not expose himself to  the damp air; the consul was not so particular. His majesty's  levÃ©e took place in the verandah of a poor bamboo hut, one of the  dozen which compose his capital. Seated in a chair and ready for  business, he was surrounded by a crowd of courtiers, who listened  attentively to every word, especially when he affected to  whisper; and some pretty women collected to peep round the  corners at the UtangÃ¡ni (white man). [FN#4]    Mr. Wilson described Roi Denis in 1856 as a man of middle  stature, with compact frame and well-made, of great muscular  power, about sixty years old, very black by contrast with the  snow-white beard veiling his brown face. \"He has a mild and  expressive eye, a gentle and persuasive voice, equally affable  and dignified; and, taken altogether, he is one of the most king-  like looking men I have ever met in Africa,\" says the reverend  gentleman. The account reminded me of Kimwere the Lion of  Usumbara, drawn by Dr. Krapf. Perhaps six years had exercised a  degeneratory effect upon Roi Denis, or perchance I have more  realism than sentiment; my eyes could see nothing but a petit  vieux vieux, nearer sixty than seventy, with a dark, wrinkled  face, and an uncommonly crafty eye, one of those African organs  which is always occupied in \"taking your measure\" not for your  good.    I read out the introductory letter from Baron Didelot--the king  speaks a little French and English, but of course his education  ends there. After listening to my projects and to my offers of  dollars, liquor, and cloth, Roi Denis replied, with due gravity,  that his chasseurs were all in the plantations, but that for a  somewhat increased consideration he would attach to my service  his own son Ogodembe, alias Paul. It was sometime before I found  out the real meaning of this crafty move; the sharp prince, sent  to do me honour, intended me to recommend him to Mr. Hogg as an  especially worthy recipient of \"trust.\" Roi Denis added an  abundance of \"sweet mouf,\" and, the compact ended, he  condescendingly walked down with me to the beach, shook hands and  exchanged a civilized \"Au revoir.\" I reentered the boat, and we  pushed off once more.    Prince Paul, a youth of the Picaresque school, a hungry as well  as a thirsty soul and vain with knowledge, which we know \"puffeth  up,\" having the true African eye on present gain as well as to  future \"trust,\" proceeded: \"Papa has at least a hundred sons,\"  enough to make Dan Dinmont blush, \"and say\" (he was not sure), \"a  hundred and fifty daughters. Father rules all the southern shore;  the French have no power beyond the brack and there are no  African rivals,\"--the prince evidently thought that the new-comer  had never heard of King George. Like most juniors here, the youth  knew French, or rather Gaboon-French; it was somewhat startling  to hear clearly and tolerably pronounced, \"M'sieur, veux-tu des  macacques?\" But the jargon is not our S'a Leone and West-coast  \"English;\" the superior facility of pronouncing the neo-Latin  tongues became at once apparent. It is evident that European  languages have been a mistake in Africa: the natives learn a  smattering sufficient for business purposes and foreigners remain  without the key to knowledge; hence our small progress in  understanding negro human nature. Had we so acted in British  India, we should probably have held the proud position which now  contents us in China as in Western Africa, with factories and  hulks at Bombay, Calcutta, Karachi, and Madras.    From Comte de Paris Roads the southern Gaboon shore is called in  charts Le Paletuvier, the Mangrove Bank; the rhizophora is the  growth of shallow brackish water, and at the projections there  are fringings of reefs and \"diabolitos,\" dangerous to boats.  After two hours we crossed the Mombe (Mombay) Creek-mouth, with  its outlying rocks, and passed the fishing village of Nenga-Oga,  whence supplies are sent daily to the Plateau. Then doubling a  point of leek-green grass, based upon comparatively poor soil,  sand, and clay, and backed by noble trees, we entered the MbÃ¡tÃ¡  River, the Toutiay of the chart and the Batta Creek of M. du  Chaillu's map. It comes from the south-west, and it heads much  nearer the coast than is shown on paper.    Presently the blood-red sun sank like a fire-balloon into the  west, flushing with its last fierce beams the higher clouds of  the eastern sky, and lighting the white and black plume of the  soaring fish-eagle. This Gypohierax (Angolensis) is a very wild  bird, flushed at 200 yards: I heard of, but I never saw, the  Gwanyoni, which M. du Chaillu, (chapter xvi.) calls Guanionian,  an eagle or a vulture said to kill deer. Rain fell at times,  thunder, anything but \"sweet thunder,\" again rolled in the  distance; and lightning flashed and forked before and behind us,  becoming painfully vivid in the shades darkening apace. We could  see nothing of the channel but a steel-grey streak, like a  Damascus blade, in a sable sheathing of tall mangrove avenue; in  places, however, tree-clumps suggested delusive hopes that we  were approaching a region where man can live. On our return we  found many signs of population which had escaped our sight during  the fast-growing obscurity. The first two reaches were long and  bulging; the next became shorter, and Prince Paul assured us  that, after one to the right, and another to the left, we should  fall into the direct channel. Roi Denis had promised us arrival  at sunset; his son gradually protracted sunset till midnight.  Still the distance grew and grew. I now learned for the first  time that the boat was too large for the channel, and that oars  were perfectly useless ahead.    At 8 P.M. we entered what seemed a cul de sac; it looked like  "]]]
