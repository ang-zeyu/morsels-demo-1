Run hard,\" said the crowd, and \"Let him rest.\"    \"Whatever is the use of it?\" said the Hare, and this time he stopped  for good. Some say he slept.    There was desperate excitement for an hour or two, and then the  Tortoise won.    \"Run hard. Run hard,\" shouted his backers. \"Hard shell and hard  living: that's what has done it.\" And then they asked the Tortoise what  his achievement signified, and he went and asked the Turtle. And the  Turtle said, \"It is a glorious victory for the forces of swiftness.\" And  then the Tortoise repeated it to his friends. And all the beasts said  nothing else for years. And even to this day, \"a glorious victory for  the forces of swiftness\" is a catch-phrase in the house of the snail.    And the reason that this version of the race is not widely known is  that very few of those that witnessed it survived the great forest-fire  that happened shortly after. It came up over the weald by night with  a great wind. The Hare and the Tortoise and a very few of the beasts  saw it far off from a high bare hill that was at the edge of the trees, and  they hurriedly called a meeting to decide what messenger they should  send to warn the beasts in the forest.    They sent the Tortoise.          ALONE THE IMMORTALS      I heard it said that far away from here, on the wrong side of the  deserts of Cathay and in a country dedicate to winter, are all the years  that are dead. And there a certain valley shuts them in and hides them,  as rumor has it, from the world, but not from the sight of the moon nor  from those that dream in his rays.    And I said: I will go from here by ways of dream and I will come to  that valley and enter in and mourn there for the good years that are  dead. And I said: I will take a wreath, a wreath of mourning, and lay  it at their feet in token of my sorrow for their dooms.    And when I sought about among the flowers, among the flowers for  my wreath of mourning, the lily looked too large and the laurel looked  too solemn and I found nothing frail enough nor slender to serve as an  offering to the years that were dead. And at last I made a slender  wreath of daisies in the manner that I had seen them made in one of  the years that is dead.    \"This,\" said I, \"is scarce less fragile or less frail than one of those  delicate forgotten years.\" Then I took my wreath in my hand and  went from here. And when I had come by paths of mystery to that  romantic land, where the valley that rumour told of lies close to the  mountainous moon, I searched among the grass for those poor slight  years for whom I bought my sorrow and my wreath. And when I found  there nothing in the grass I said: \"Time has shattered them and swept  them away and left not even any faint remains.\"    But looking upwards in the blaze of the moon I suddenly saw colossi  sitting near, and towering up and blotting out the stars and filling the  night with blackness; and at those idols' feet I saw praying and making  obeisance kings and the days that are and all times and all cities and all  nations and all their gods. Neither the smoke of incense nor of the  sacrifice burning reached those colossal heads, they sat there not to  be measured, not to be over-thrown, not to be worn away.    I said: \"Who are those?\"    One answered: \"Alone the Immortals.\"    And I said sadly: \"I came not to see dread gods, but I came to shed  my tears and to offer flowers at the feet of certain little years that are  dead and may not come again.\"    He answered me: \"These _are_ the years that are dead, alone the  immortals; all years to be are Their children--They fashioned their  smiles and their laughter; all earthly kings They have crowned, all  gods They have created; all the events to be flow down from their  feet like a river, the worlds are flying pebbles that They have already  thrown, and Time and all his centuries behind him kneel there with  bended crests in token of vassalage at Their potent feet.\"    And when I heard this I turned away with my wreath, and went back  to my own land comforted.          A MORAL LITTLE TALE      There was once an earnest Puritan who held it wrong to dance. And  for his principles he labored hard, his was a zealous life. And there  loved him all of those who hated the dance; and those that loved the  dance respected him too; they said \"He is a pure, good man and acts  according to his lights.\"    He did much to discourage dancing and helped to close several  Sunday entertainments. Some kinds of poetry, he said, he liked, but  not the fanciful kind as that might corrupt the thoughts of the very young.  He always dressed in black.    He was quite interested in morality and was quite sincere and there  grew to be much respect on Earth for his honest face and his flowing  pure-white beard.    One night the Devil appeared unto him in a dream and said \"Well done.\"    \"Avaunt,\" said that earnest man.    \"No, no, friend,\" said the Devil.    \"Dare not to call me 'friend,'\" he answered bravely.    \"Come, come, friend,\" said the Devil. \"Have you not done my work? Have  you not put apart the couples that would dance? Have you not checked  their laughter and their accursed mirth? Have you not worn my livery  of black? O friend, friend, you do not know what a detestable thing  it is to sit in hell and hear people being happy, and singing in  theatres and singing in the fields, and whispering after dances under  the moon,\" and he fell to cursing fearfully.    \"It is you,\" said the Puritan, \"that put into their hearts the evil desire  to dance; and black is God's own livery, not yours.\"    And the Devil laughed contemptuously and spoke.    \"He only made the silly colors,\" he said, \"and useless dawns on  hill-slopes facing South, and butterflies flapping along them as soon  as the sun rose high, and foolish maidens coming out to dance, and  the warm mad West wind, and worst of all that pernicious influence  Love.\"    And when the Devil said that God made Love that earnest man  sat up in bed and shouted \"Blasphemy! Blasphemy!\"    \"It's true,\" said the Devil. \"It isn't I that send the village fools  muttering and whispering two by two in the woods when the  harvest moon is high, it's as much as I can bear even to see them  dancing.\"    \"Then,\" said the man, \"I have mistaken right for wrong; but as soon  as I wake I will fight you yet.\"    \"O, no you don't,\" said the Devil. \"You don't wake up out of this sleep.\"    And somewhere far away Hell's black steel doors were opened, and  arm in arm those two were drawn within, and the doors shut behind  them and still they went arm in arm, trudging further and further into  the deeps of Hell, and it was that Puritan's punishment to know that  those that he cared for on Earth would do evil as he had done.          THE RETURN OF SONG      \"The swans are singing again,\" said to one another the gods. And  looking downwards, for my dreams had taken me to some fair and  far Valhalla, I saw below me an iridescent bubble not greatly larger  than a star shine beautifully but faintly, and up and up from it looking  larger and larger came a flock of white, innumerable swans, singing  and singing and singing, till it seemed as though even the gods were  wild ships swimming in music.    \"What is it?\" I said to one that was humble among the gods.    \"Only a world has ended,\" he said to me, \"and the swans are coming  back to the gods returning the gift of song.\"    \"A whole world dead!\" I said.    \"Dead,\" said he that was humble among the gods. \"The worlds are  not for ever; only song is immortal.\"    \"Look! Look!\" he said. \"There will be a new one soon.\"    And I looked and saw the larks, going down from the gods.          SPRING IN TOWN      At a street corner sat, and played with a wind, Winter disconsolate.    Still tingled the fingers of the passers-by and still their breath was  visible, and still they huddled their chins into their coats when turning  a corner they met with a new wind, still windows lighted early sent out  into the street the thought of romantic comfort by evening fires; these  things still were, yet the throne of Winter tottered, and every breeze  brought tidings of further fortresses lost on lakes or boreal hill-slopes.  And not any longer as a king did Winter appear in those streets, as when  the city was decked with gleaming white to greet him as a conqueror and  he rode in with his glittering icicles and haughty retinue of prancing  winds, but he sat there with a little wind at the corner of the street like  some old blind beggar with his hungry dog. And as to some old blind  beggar Death approaches, and the alert ears of the sightless man  prophetically hear his far-off footfall, so there came suddenly to  Winter's ears the sound, from some neighbouring garden, of Spring  approaching as she walked on daisies. And Spring approaching looked  at huddled inglorious Winter.    \"Begone,\" said Spring.    \"There is nothing for you to do here,\" said Winter to her. Nevertheless  he drew about him his grey and battered cloak and rose and called to  his little bitter wind and up a side street that led northward strode away.    Pieces of paper and tall clouds of dust went with him as far as the city's  outer gate. He turned then and called to Spring: \"You can do nothing  in this city,\" he said; then he marched homeward over plains and sea  and heard his old winds howling as he marched. The ice broke up  behind him and foundered like navies.

One day they were playing in the garden.    \"Oh, Helle, look!\" said the boy.    There on the grass was a fine large sheep. This sheep had a fleece of  gold and his horns were gold, too.    [Illustration: THE KING AND HIS TWO CHILDREN.]    The children wanted to pat the sheep, but they could not catch him.  When they went near, he ran away on the clouds.           *       *       *       *       *              grew          golden          hold            tame          ride            tight    Every day they played in the garden and every day the sheep came, too.    By and by he grew tame and let the children pat his golden fleece.    One day the boy said, \"Helle, let us take a ride.\"    First he helped his sister on the sheep's back.    Then he got on and held to the horns.    \"Hold tight to me, Helle,\" he said.           *       *       *       *       *              sky           dizzy           sea            sister        land            dragon            lose          nailed          Colchis    The sheep went up, up into the sky, and ran a long way on the clouds.  But Helle got dizzy and fell down into the sea.    The boy felt very bad to lose his sister, but went right on.    Then he came to the land Colchis. He killed the sheep and gave the  golden fleece to the king.    [Illustration: THE BOY GIVES THE GOLDEN FLEECE TO THE KING.]    The king was glad to have it and nailed it to an oak tree.    [Illustration: THE SHEEP WENT UP INTO THE SKY AND RAN A LONG WAY ON  THE CLOUDS]    By the tree was a dragon. The dragon never went to sleep. He would not  let any one but the king come to the tree.    So no one could get the golden fleece.          THE GOOD SHIP ARGO.                across        untied          wade            Jason         brave           party            rained        creek           bridge            shoe-strings                  invited      Jason was a brave young man. He lived a little way from the king's  city.    One day the king gave a big party and invited Jason.    It was a very dark night and it rained hard.    Jason had to go across a creek, but there was no bridge.    [Illustration: JASON COMES TO THE KING'S HOUSE.]    The creek was full of water and Jason had to wade.    One of his shoe-strings came untied and he lost his shoe in the  water.    When he came to the king's house, he had but one shoe.           *       *       *       *       *              knew          bring           fight            wild          Argo            asked            animals       shoe            Argonauts    The king did not like this, for a fairy had said, \"The man who shall  come to your house with one shoe, will be king.\"    So he knew Jason was to be king.    Then he said to Jason, \"You may be king when you bring me the golden  fleece.\"    Jason was glad to go, and asked many brave men to go with him.    To get the golden fleece they would have to fight wild men and  animals.    They made a big ship which they named \"Argo.\"    The men who went on the Argo were called Argonauts.          JASON AND THE HARPIES.                wings         blind           nobody            strong        iron            hard            skin          drive           claws            scratched     brass           Harpies    The ship Argo sailed a long way. There were two strong men on the  ship. They had wings and could fly.    One day the Argo came to a land where the blind king lived.    This poor king had a hard time. When he sat down to the table to eat,  some ugly birds called Harpies, came too. The Harpies had skin like  brass and nobody could hurt them. They had claws of iron, and  scratched people when they tried to drive them away.    When the king's dinner was ready, the Harpies came and took it away.  When Jason and his men came, the king told them all about it. Jason  said they would help him.           *       *       *       *       *              food          drowned         tired            swords        hurt            flying    They all sat down to the table. When the food was put on the table,  the Harpies came flying in. Jason and his men took their swords.    [Illustration: JASON TRIES TO KILL THE HARPIES.]    They cut at the Harpies but could not hurt them.    Then the two men with wings flew up in the air. The Harpies were  afraid and flew away. The men flew after them.    At last the Harpies grew very tired and fell into the sea and were  drowned.    Then the men with wings came back.    Now the blind king could eat all he wanted.           *       *       *       *       *              thanked       rocks           moved            friends       helping         good-bye            over          apart           icebergs    It was now time for Jason and his friends to go away.    The king thanked them over and over again for helping him.    When they said good-bye, he told them how to get to the land where  they would find the golden fleece.    On the sea where Jason and his men had to sail, were two big rocks.  These rocks moved on the waterlike icebergs.    They were as high as a big hill. They would come close to each other,  then they would go far apart.           *       *       *       *       *              fishes        pieces          dove            past          break           together            row           almost          rocks    When fishes swam in the water the rocks would come together and kill  the fishes.    If birds flew in the air, the rocks would come together and kill  birds.    If a boat sailed on the water, the rocks would come together and break  the boat into little pieces.    These rocks had been put in the sea, so no one could go to the land  where the golden fleece was.    When the ship Argo came to the rocks, Jason sent a dove out.    The rocks came together when the dove was almost past.    Then they went far apart. Jason made his men row as hard as they  could.    The rocks began to come together. \"Row hard, my men,\" said Jason.    Just as they got past, the rocks hit, but Jason and his men were all  right.    So they came to Colchis.          THE BRASS BULLS.                something     plow            bulls            stronger      chains          noses            mouths        smoke           plant            stone         flew            stall    When Jason came to Colchis, he went to the king and said, \"Will you  give me the golden fleece?\"    The king wanted to keep the fleece.    So he said to Jason, \"You may have it, but you must do something  for me first.\"    \"You must plow with the brass bulls, and plant the dragon's teeth.\"    The brass bulls looked like real bulls, but they were larger and  stronger.    They blew out fire and smoke from their noses and mouths.    The bulls had a stall made of iron and stone. They had to be tied  with strong iron chains.           *       *       *       *       *              daughter      Medea           carriage            snakes        through         pulled    When the dragon's teeth were planted, iron men grew up.    They always killed the one who had planted them.    The king wanted the bulls to kill Jason.    [Illustration: MEDEA GATHERS FLOWERS.]    He said, \"If the bulls do not kill him the iron men will.\"    The king had a daughter named Medea. She saw Jason was a brave  young man and did not want him killed.    She knew how to help him. She stepped into her carriage, which was  pulled by flying snakes.    Then Medea flew through the air. She went to hills and creeks and  picked all kinds of flowers.    She took the flowers home and cooked them.           *       *       *       *       *              nothing       face            rub            juice         legs            cut    Then Medea went to Jason when the king did not know it.    She said to Jason, \"Rub your face and hands and legs with this juice.\"    [Illustration: MEDEA GIVES JASON THE JUICE.]    When he did this, he was as strong as a giant.    Nothing could hurt him then. Fire could not burn him, and swords  could not cut him.    The next day Jason had to plow with the brass bulls and plant the  dragon's teeth.           *       *       *       *       *              climbed       early           tied            princess      seats           hold            untied        opened          place    Early in the morning, the king and princess went out to the place.    They had good seats where they could see well.    All the people in the city came out to see Jason plow.    The little boys climbed the trees so they could see better.    Then Jason came to the place. The stall where the brass bulls were  tied was not far off.    The door was opened and Jason went in.    He untied the bulls and took hold of their horns.    Then he made the bulls come out of their stall.           *       *       *       *       *              pushed        kicked          until    The bulls were very angry and blew fire and smoke from their mouths.    This made the cruel king glad. But the people who saw it were afraid.  They did not want Jason killed. They did not know that the princess  had helped him.    Jason pushed the bulls' heads down to the ground. Then they kicked at  him with their feet, but could not hurt him.    He held their heads down on the ground until the plow was ready.           *       *       *       *       *              handle        slowly          noon            wheat         lie             just    Jason took the chains in one hand. He took the handle of the plow in  the other.    The bulls jumped and wanted to run away.    But Jason held so hard they had to go very slowly.    When it was noon the ground was all plowed.    Then Jason let the bulls go.    They were so angry that they ran away to the woods.    Now Jason went to the king and said, \"Give me the dragon's teeth.\"    The king gave him his hat full.    Then Jason planted the dragon's teeth, just as a man plants wheat.    By this time he was very tired, so he"]]]
