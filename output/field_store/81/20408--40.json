He insisted upon their taking possession of his  house, and furnished them with every possible accommodation during  their stay at Madeira. They received, likewise, great marks of  attention and civility from Dr. Thomas Heberden, the principal  physician of the island, and brother to the excellent and learned Dr.  William Heberden of London. Dr. Thomas Heberden afforded all the  assistance in his power to Mr. Banks, and Dr. Solander in their  botanical inquiries.    It was not solely from the English that the lieutenant and his friends  experienced a kind reception. The fathers of the Franciscan convent  displayed a liberality of sentiment towards them, which might not have  been expected from Portuguese friars; and, in a visit which they paid  to a convent of nuns, the ladies expressed a particular pleasure at  seeing them. At this visit the good nuns gave an amusing proof of the  progress they had made to the cultivation of their understandings.  Having heard that there were great philosophers among the English  gentlemen, they asked them a variety of questions; one of which was,  when it would thunder; and another, whether a spring of fresh water,  which was much wanted, was any where to be found within the walls of  the convent. Eminent as our philosophers were, they were puzzled by  these questions.    Lieutenant Cook, having laid in a fresh stock of beef, water, and  wine, set sail from the island of Madeira, in the night of the 18th of  September, and proceeded on his voyage. By the 7th of November several  articles of the ship's provisions began to fall short; for which  reason, the lieutenant determined to put into Rio de Janeiro. This  place he preferred to any other port in Brazil or to Falkland's  Islands, because he could there be better supplied with what he  wanted, and had no doubt of meeting with a friendly reception.    During the run between Madeira and Rio de Janeiro, Lieutenant Cook and  the gentlemen in the Endeavour had an opportunity of determining a  philosophical question. On the evening of the 29th of October, they  observed that luminous appearance of the sea which has so often been  mentioned by navigators, and which has been ascribed to such a variety  of causes. Flashes of light appeared to be emitted, exactly resembling  those of lightning, though without being so considerable; and such was  the frequency of them, that sometimes eight or ten were visible almost  at the same moment. It was the opinion of Mr. Cook and the other  gentlemen, that these flashes proceeded from some luminous animal; and  their opinion was confirmed by experiment.    At Rio de Janeiro, in the port of which Lieutenant Cook came to an  anchor on the 13th of November, he did not meet with the polite  reception that, perhaps, he had too sanguinely expected. His stay was  spent in continual altercations, with the viceroy, who appeared not a  little jealous of the designs of the English: nor were all the  attempts of the lieutenant to set the matter right, capable of  producing any effect. The viceroy was by no means distinguished either  by his knowledge or his love of science; and the grand object of Mr.  Cook's expedition was quite beyond his comprehension. When he was told  that the English were bound to the southward, by the order of his  Britannic majesty, to observe a transit of the planet Venus over the  Sun, an astronomical phenomenon of great importance to navigation, he  could form no other conception of the matter, than that it was the  passing of the North star through the South Pole.    During the whole of the contest with the viceroy, Lieutenant Cook  behaved with equal spirit and discretion. A supply of water and other  necessaries could not be refused him, and those were gotten on board  by the 1st of December. On that day the lieutenant sent to the viceroy  for a pilot to carry the Endeavour to sea; but the wind preventing the  ship from getting out, she was obliged to continue some time longer in  the harbour. A Spanish packet having arrived at Rio de Janeiro on the  2d of December, with dispatches from Buenos Ayres for Spain, the  commander, Don Antonio de Monte Negro y Velasco, offered, with great  politeness, to convey the letters of the English to Europe. This  favour Lieutenant Cook accepted, and gave Don Antonio a packet for the  secretary of the Admiralty, containing copies of all the papers that  had passed between himself and the Viceroy. He left, also, duplicates  with the viceroy, that he might forward them, if he thought proper, to  Lisbon.    On the 5th of December, it being a dead calm, our navigators weighed  anchor, and towed down the Bay; but, to their great astonishment, two  shots were fired at them; when they had gotten abreast of Santa Cruz,  the principal fortification of the harbour. Lieutenant Cook  immediately cast anchor, and sent to the fort to demand, the reason of  this conduct; the answer to which was, that the commandant had  received no order from the viceroy to let the ship pass; and that,  without such an order, no vessel was ever suffered to go below the  fort. It now became necessary to send to the viceroy, to inquire why  the order had not been given; and his behaviour appeared the more  extraordinary, as notice had been transmitted to him of the departure  of the English, and he had thought proper to write a polite letter to  Mr. Cook, wishing him a good voyage. The lieutenant's messenger soon  returned, with the information that the order had been written several  days, and that its not having been sent had arisen from some  unaccountable negligence. It was not till the 7th of December that the  Endeavour got under sail.    In the account which Lieutenant Cook has given of Rio de Janeiro, and  the country round it, one circumstance is recorded, which cannot be  otherwise than very painful to humanity. It is the horrid expense of  life at which the gold mines are wrought. No less than forty thousand  Negroes are annually imported for this purpose, on the king of  Portugal's account; and the English were credibly informed, that, in  the year 1766, this number fell so short, that twenty thousand more  were drafted from the town of Rio.    From Rio de Janeiro, Lieutenant Cook pursued his voyage, and, on the  14th of January, 1769, entered the Strait of Le Maire, at which time  the tide drove the ship out with so much violence, and raised such a  sea off Cape St. Diego, that she frequently pitched, so that the  bowsprit was under water. On the next day, the lieutenant anchored,  first before a small cove, which was understood to be Port Maurice,  and afterward in the Bay of Good Success. While the Endeavour was in  this station, happened the memorable adventure of Mr. Banks, Dr.  Solander, Mr. Monkhouse the surgeon, and Mr. Green the astronomer,  together with their attendants and servants, and two seamen, in  ascending a mountain to search for plants. In this expedition they  were all of them exposed to the utmost extremity of danger and of  cold; Dr. Solander was seized with a torpor which had nearly proved  fatal to his life; and two black servants actually died. When the  gentlemen had, at length, on the second day of their adventure, gotten  back to the ship, they congratulated each other on their safety, with  a joy that can only be felt by those who have experienced equal  perils; and Mr. Cook was relieved from a very painful anxiety. It was  a dreadful testimony of the severity of the climate, that this event  took place when it was the midst of summer in that part of the world,  and at the close of a day, the beginning of which was as mild and  warm, as the month of May usually is in England.    In the passage through the Strait of Le Maire, Lieutenant Cook and his  ingenious associates had an opportunity of gaining a considerable  degree of acquaintance with the inhabitants of the adjoining country.  Here it was that they saw human nature to its lowest form. The natives  appeared to be the most destitute and forlorn, as well as the most  stupid, of the children of men. Their lives are spent in wandering  about the dreary wastes that surround them; and their dwellings are no  other than wretched hovels of sticks and grass, which not only admit  the wind, but the snow and the rain. They are almost naked, and so  devoid are they of every convenience which is furnished by the rudest  art, that they have not so much as an implement to dress their food.  Nevertheless, they seemed to have no wish for acquiring more than they  possessed; nor did any thing that was offered them by the English  appear acceptable but beads, as an ornamental superfluity of life. A  conclusion is hence drawn by Dr. Hawkesworth, that these people may be  upon a level with ourselves, in respect to the happiness they enjoy.  This, however, is a position which ought not hastily to be admitted.  It is, indeed, a beautiful circumstance, in the order of Divine  Providence, that the rudest inhabitants of the earth, and those who  are situated in the most unfavourable climates, should not be sensible  of their disadvantages. But still it must be allowed, that their  happiness is greatly inferior, both in kind and degree, to that  intellectual, social, and moral felicity, which is capable of being  attained in a highly cultivated state of society.    In voyages to the South Pacific Ocean, the determination of the best  passage from the Atlantic is a point of peculiar importance. It is  well known what prodigious difficulties were experienced in this  respect by former navigators. The doubling of Cape Horn, in  particular, was so much dreaded, that, to the general opinion, it was  far more eligible to pass through the Strait of Magalhaens. Lieutenant  Cook hath fully ascertained the erroneousness of this opinion. He was  but three-and-thirty days in coming round the land of Terra del Fuego,  from the east entrance of the Strait of Le Maire, till he had advanced  about "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7787"],[0,"A Complete Grammar of Esperanto (#5)"],[1,". 3.

Words which stand in the place of nouns, as \"you,\" \"he,\" \"who,\"  \"which,\" are called \"pronouns\". Pronouns referring to the person  speaking (\"I\", \"we\"), the person addressed (\"you\", \"thou\"), or the  person or thing spoken of (\"he\", \"she\", \"it\", \"they\"), are called  \"personal pronouns\". They are considered singular or plural, according  to whether they refer to one or more persons. Since the meaning of such  pronouns indicates the number, no plural ending is ever attached to  them. The personal pronouns are:                             Singular.            Plural.        First person:      mi, I (me).          ni, we (us).       Second person:      vi, you.             vi, you.                           li, he (him).      Third person:      sxi, she (her).      ili, they (them).                         gxi, it.    [Footnote: There is another pronoun \"ci\" (thou), for the second person  singular, used in solemn style, as in the Bible, in poetry, and also  for intimate or familiar address when desired, like German \"du\", French  \"tu\", etc.]                              AGREEMENT WITH PRONOUNS.    33. Nouns in predicate relation with pronouns, or adjectives modifying  such pronouns, are made to agree with them in number:       Ni estas bonaj kaj felicxaj, we are good and happy.     Rozoj estas floroj, ill ne estas fruktoj,        roses are flowers, they are not fruits.     Gertrudo, vi estas bona, Gertrude, you are good.     Knabinoj, cxu vi estas felicxaj? Girls, are you happy?                              CONJUGATION OF THE VERB.    34. Any pronoun may serve as the subject of a verb. The combination  of the verb with each of the personal pronouns in succession for its  subject, is called the \"conjugation\" of the verb. Following is the  conjugation of the present tense of \"esti\", and of \"vidi\":       mi estas = I am.                   mi vidas = I see.     vi estas = you are.                vi vidas = you see.     li (sxi, gxi) estas =              li (sxi, gxi) vidas :        he (she, it) is.                   he (she, it) sees.     ni estas = we are.                 ni vidas = we see.     vi estas = you (plural) are.       vi vidas = you (plural) see.     ili estas = they are.              ili vidas = they see.                                     VOCABULARY       al = to, toward.                                hodiaux = today.     Arturo = Arthur.                                kudri = to sew.     aux = or (aux ... aux ..., either ... or ...)   Roberto = Robert.     cxar = because.                                 skui = to shake.     doni = to give.                                 stari = to stand.     fali = to fall.                                 sub = under, beneath.     fenestro = window.                              virino = woman.

The past tense of the verb expresses an action which took place in  past time, or a condition which existed in past time. The ending of  this tense is \"-is\", as \"kuris\", ran, \"flugis\", flew, \"brilis\", shone.  The conjugation of \"esti\" and also of \"vidi\" in the past tense is as  follows:       mi estis = I was.                  mi vidis = I saw.     vi estis = you were.               vi vidis = you saw.     li (sxi, gxi) estis =              li (sxi, gxi) vidis :        he (she, it) was.                  he (she, it) saw.     ni estis = we were.                ni vidis = we saw.     vi estis = you (plural) were.      vi vidis = you (plural) saw.     ili estis = they were.             ili vidis = they saw.                                   PREPOSITIONS.    36. A preposition is a word like \"in,\" \"on,\" placed before a noun or  pronoun to indicate some relation between this and another word. The  preposition is said to \"govern\" the noun or pronoun, which is called its  \"complement\". In English, the complement of a preposition seems to be  put in the accusative case if it is a pronoun, but to remain unchanged  in form if it is a noun. In Esperanto the preposition does not affect  the form of the word governed, which remains in the nominative case:       La arbo estas en la gxardeno, the tree is in the garden.     Bonaj pomoj estas sur gxi, good apples are on it.     Mi donis cxerizojn al li, I gave cherries to him.     La knabo estas apud mi, the boy is near me.     Sub la arbo staris cxevalo, under the tree stood a horse.                       ACCUSATIVE CASE OF PERSONAL PRONOUNS.    37. For use as the object of a verb, any pronoun may be put in the  accusative case by addition of the accusative ending \"-n\" (23):       La viro vidis vin kaj min, the man saw you and me.     Li vidis ilin kaj nin, he saw them and us.     Mi vidis nek lin nek sxin, I saw neither him nor her.     Ni volas havi gxin, we wish to have it.                                     VOCABULARY       agrabla = pleasant, agreeable.     luma = light (not dark).     bildo = picture.                   muro = wall.     blua = blue.                       nun = now.     danki = to thank.                  planko = floor.     de = from.                         pordo = door.     diri = to say.                     rigardi = to look (at).     infano = child.                    tapisxo = carpet.     interesa = interesting.            tra = through.                                  READING LESSON.    1. Hodiaux la knaboj kaj knabinoj estas en la granda domo. 2. Ili staras  apud la tablo, en agrabla luma cxambro. 3. Gxi havas altajn largxajn  fenestrojn. 4.
