Where I met with any  circumstance which I imagined might be curious or entertaining, I have not  failed to produce it.   The Preliminary Discourse will acquaint the reader with the most  material particulars proper to be known previously to the entering on the  Korân itself, and which could not so conveniently have been thrown into the  Notes.  And I have taken care, both in the Preliminary Discourse and the  Notes, constantly to quote my authorities and the writers to whom I have been  beholden; but to none have I been more so than to the learned Dr. Pocock,  whose Specimen Historiæ Arabum is the most useful and accurate work that has  been hitherto published concerning the antiquities of that nation, and ought  to be read by every curious inquirer into them.   As I have had no opportunity of consulting public libraries, the  manuscripts of which I have made use throughout the whole work have been such  as I had in my own study, except only the Commentary of al Beidâwi and the  Gospel of St. Barnabas.  The first belongs to the library of the Dutch church  in Austin Friars, and for the use of it I have been chiefly indebted to the  Reverend Dr. Bolten, one of the ministers of that church: the other was very  obligingly lent me by the Reverend Dr. Holme, Rector of Hedley in Hampshire;  and I take this opportunity of returning both those gentlemen my thanks for  their favours.  The merit of al Beidâwi's commentary will appear from the  frequent quotations I have made thence; but of the Gospel of St. Barnabas  (which I had not seen when the little I have said of it in the Preliminary  Discourse,* and the extract I had borrowed from M. de la Monnoye and M.  Toland,? were printed off), I must beg leave to give some further account.   The book is a moderate quarto, in Spanish, written in a very legible  hand, but a little damaged towards the latter end.  It contains two hundred  and twenty-two chapters of unequal length, and four hundred       *  Sect. IV. p. 58.  ?  In not. ad cap. 3, p. 38        and twenty pages; and is said, in the front, to be translated from the  Italian, by an Arragonian Moslem, named Mostafa de Aranda.  There is a preface  prefixed to it, wherein the discoverer of the original MS., who was a  Christian monk, called Fra Marino, tells us that having accidentally met with  a writing of Irenæus (among others), wherein he speaks against St. Paul,  alleging, for his authority, the Gospel of St. Barnabas, he became exceeding  desirous to find this gospel; and that GOD, of His mercy, having made him very  intimate with Pope Sixtus V., one day, as they were together in that Pope's  library, his Holiness fell asleep, and he, to employ himself, reaching down a  book to read, the first he laid his hand on proved to be the very gospel he  wanted: overjoyed at the discovery, he scrupled not to hide his prize in his  sleeve, and on the Pope's awaking, took leave of him, carrying with him that  celestial treasure, by reading of which he became a convert to Mohammedism.   This Gospel of Barnabas contains a complete history of Jesus Christ from  His birth to His ascension; and most of the circumstances in the four real  Gospels are to be found therein, but many of them turned, and some artfully  enough, to favour the Mohammedan system.  From the design of the whole, and  the frequent interpolations of stories and passages wherein Mohammed is spoken  of and foretold by name, as the messenger of God, and the great prophet who  was to perfect the dispensation of Jesus, it appears to be a most barefaced  forgery.  One particular I observe therein induces me to believe it to have  been dressed up by a renegade Christian, slightly instructed in his new  religion, and not educated a Mohammedan (unless the fault be imputed to the  Spanish, or perhaps the Italian translator, and not to the original compiler);  I mean the giving to Mohammed the title of Messiah, and that not once or twice  only, but in several places; whereas the title of the Messiah, or, as the  Arabs write it, al Masîh, i.e., Christ, is appropriated to Jesus in the Korân,  and is constantly applied by the Mohammedans to Him, and never to their own  prophet.  The passages produced from the Italian MS. by M. de la Monnoye are  to be seen in this Spanish version almost word for word.   But to return to the following work.  Though I have freely censured the  former translations of the Korân, I would not therefore be suspected of a  design to make my own pass as free from faults: I am very sensible it is not;  and I make no doubt that the few who are able to discern them, and know the  difficulty of the undertaking, will give me fair quarter.  I likewise flatter  myself that they, and all considerate persons, will excuse the delay which has  happened in the publication of this work, when they are informed that it was  carried on at leisure times only, and amidst the necessary avocations of a  troublesome profession.

They are the unfailing attendants of all  flesh-hunters, human or feline; and also furiously pursue and persecute  all eagles and true vultures that venture on that great sea of grass, to  wander thereafter, for ever lost and harried, \"the Hagars and Ishmaels  of their kind.\"    The owls are few and all of wide-ranging species. The most common is the  burrowing-owl, found in both Americas. Not a retiring owl this, but all  day long, in cold and in heat, it stands exposed at the mouth of its  kennel, or on the vizcacha's mound, staring at the passer-by with an  expression of grave surprise and reprehension in its round yellow eyes;  male and female invariably together, standing stiff and erect, almost  touching--of all birds that pair for life the most Darby and Joan like.    Of the remaining land birds, numbering about forty species, a few that  are most attractive on account of their beauty, engaging habits, or  large size, may be mentioned here. On the southern portion of the pampas  the military starling (Sturnella) is found, and looks like the European  starling, with the added beauty of a scarlet breast: among resident  pampas birds the only one with a touch of brilliant colouring. It has a  pleasing, careless song, uttered on the wing, and in winter congregates  in great flocks, to travel slowly northwards over the plains. When thus  travelling the birds observe a kind of order, and the flock feeding  along the ground shows a very extended front--a representation in  bird-life of the \"thin red line\"--and advances by the hindmost birds  constantly flying over the others and alighting in the front ranks.    Among the tyrant-birds are several species of the beautiful wing-banded  genus, snow-white in colour, with black on the wings and tail: these are  extremely graceful birds, and strong flyers, and in desert places, where  man seldom intrudes, they gather to follow the traveller, calling to  each other with low whistling notes, and in the distance look like white  flowers as they perch on the topmost stems of the tall bending grasses.    The most characteristic pampean birds are the tinamous--called  partridges in the vernacular--the rufous tinamou, large as a fowl, and  the spotted tinamou, which is about the size of the English partridge.  Their habits are identical: both lay eggs of a beautiful wine-purple  colour, and in both species the young acquire the adult plumage and  power of flight when very small, and fly better than the adults. They  have small heads, slender curved beaks, unfeathered legs and feet, and  are tailless; the plumage is deep yellowish, marked with black and brown  above. They live concealed, skulking like rails through the tall grass,  fly reluctantly, and when driven up, their flight is exceedingly noisy  and violent, the bird soon exhausting itself. They are solitary, but  many live in proximity, frequently calling to each other with soft  plaintive voices. The evening call-notes of the larger bird are  flute-like in character, and singularly sweet and expressive.    The last figure to be introduced into this sketch--which is not a  catalogue--is that of the Rhea. Glyptodon, Toxodon, Mylodon,  Megatherium, have passed away, leaving no descendants, and only pigmy  representatives if any; but among the feathered inhabitants of the pampa  the grand archaic ostrich of America survives from a time when there  were also giants among the avians. Vain as such efforts usually are, one  cannot help trying to imagine something of the past history of this  majestic bird, before man came to lead the long chase now about to end  so mournfully. Its fleetness, great staying powers, and beautiful  strategy when hunted, make it seem probable that it was not without  pursuers, other than the felines, among its ancient enemies, long-winded  and tenacious of their quarry; and these were perhaps of a type still  represented by the wolf or hound-like aguara and aguara-guazu. It might  be supposed that when almost all the larger forms, both mammal and bird,  were overtaken by destruction, and when the existing rhea was on the  verge of extinction, these long-legged swift canines changed their  habits and lost their bold spirit, degenerating at last into hunters of  small birds and mammals, on which they are said to live.    The rhea possesses a unique habit, which is a puzzle to us, although it  probably once had some significance--namely, that of running, when  hunted, with one wing raised vertically, like a great sail--a veritable  \"ship of the wilderness.\" In every way it is adapted to the conditions  of the pampas in a far greater degree than other pampean birds, only  excepting the rufous and spotted tinamous. Its commanding stature gives  it a wide horizon; and its dim, pale, bluish-grey colour assimilates to  that of the haze, and renders it invisible at even a moderate distance.  Its large form fades out of sight mysteriously, and the hunter strains  his eyes in vain to distinguish it on the blue expanse. Its figure and  carriage have a quaint majestic grace, somewhat unavian in character,  and peculiar to itself. There are few more strangely fascinating sights  in nature than that of the old black-necked cock bird, standing with  raised agitated wings among the tall plumed grasses, and calling  together his scattered hens with hollow boomings and long mysterious  suspira-tions, as if a wind blowing high up in the void sky had found a  voice. Rhea-hunting with the bolas, on a horse possessing both speed and  endurance, and trained to follow the bird in all his quick doublings, is  unquestionably one of the most fascinating forms of sport ever invented,  by man. The quarry has even more than that fair chance of escape,  without which all sport degenerates into mere butchery, unworthy of  rational beings; moreover, in this unique method of hunting the ostrich  the capture depends on a preparedness for all the shifts and sudden  changes of course practised by the bird when closely followed, which is  like instinct or intuition; and, finally, in a dexterity in casting the  bolas at the right moment, with a certain aim, which no amount of  practice can give to those who are not to the manner born.    This 'wild mirth of the desert,' which the gaucho has known for the last  three centuries, is now passing away, for the rhea's fleetness can no  longer avail him. He may scorn the horse and his rider, what time he  lifts himself up, but the cowardly murderous methods of science, and a  systematic war of extermination, have left him no chance. And with the  rhea go the flamingo, antique and splendid; and the swans in their  bridal plumage; and the rufous tinamou--sweet and mournful melodist of  the eventide; and the noble crested screamer, that clarion-voiced  watch-bird of the night in the wilderness. Those, and the other large  avians, together with the finest of the mammalians, will shortly be lost  to the pampas utterly as the great bustard is to England, and as the  wild turkey and bison and many other species will shortly be lost to  North America. What a wail there would be in the world if a sudden  destruction were to fall on the accumulated art-treasures of the  National Gallery, and the marbles in the British Museum, and the  contents of the King's Library--the old prints and' mediaeval  illuminations! And these are only the work of human hands and  brains--impressions of individual genius on perishable material,  immortal only in the sense that the silken cocoon of the dead moth is  so, because they continue to exist and shine when the artist's hands and  brain are dust:--and man has the long day of life before him in which to  do again things like these, and better than these, if there is any truth  in evolution. But the forms of life in the two higher vertebrate classes  are Nature's most perfect work; and the life of even a single species is  of incalculably greater value to mankind, for what it teaches and would  continue to teach, than all the chiselled marbles and painted canvases  the world contains; though doubtless there are many persons who are  devoted to art, but blind to some things greater than art, who will set  me down as a Philistine for saying so. And, above all others, we should  protect and hold sacred those types, Nature's masterpieces, which are  first singled out for destruction on account of their size, or  splendour, or rarity, and that false detestable glory which is accorded  to their most successful slayers. In ancient times the spirit of life  shone brightest in these; and when others that shared the earth with  them were taken by death they were left, being more worthy of  perpetuation. Like immortal flowers they have drifted down to us on the  ocean of time, and their strangeness and beauty bring to our  imaginations a dream and a picture of that unknown world, immeasurably  far removed, where man was not: and when they perish, something of  gladness goes out from nature, and the sunshine loses something of its  brightness. Nor does their loss affect us and our times only. The  species now being exterminated, not only in South America but everywhere  on the globe, are, so far as we know, untouched by decadence. They are  links in a chain, and branches on the tree of life, with their roots in  a past inconceivably remote; and but for our action they would continue  to flourish, reaching outward to an equally distant future, blossoming  into higher and more beautiful forms, and gladdening innumerable  generations of our descendants. But we think nothing of all this: we  must give full scope to our passion for taking life, though by so doing  we \"ruin the great work of time;\" not in the sense in which the poet  used those words, but in one truer, and wider, and infinitely sadder.  Only when this sporting rage has spent itself, when there are no longer  any animals of the larger kinds remaining, the loss we are now  inflicting on "]]]
