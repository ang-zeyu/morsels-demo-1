Let us consider now the case of the goldfish in the house. His  diet is the same, but how different his surroundings! If his bowl  is placed on a table in the middle of the floor, he has but to  flash his tail once and he has been all round the drawing-room.  The drawing-room may not seem much to you, but to him this  impressionist picture through the curved glass must be amazing.  Let not the outdoor goldfish boast of his freedom. What does he,  in his little world of water-lily roots, know of the vista upon  vista which opens to his more happy brother as he passes jauntily  from china dog to ottoman and from ottoman to Henry's father? Ah,  here is life! It may be that in the course of years he will get  used to it, even bored by it; indeed, for that reason I always  advocate giving him a glance at the dining-room or the bedrooms  on Wednesdays and Saturdays; but his first day in the bowl must  be the opening of an undreamt of heaven to him.    Again, what an adventurous life is his. At any moment a cat may  climb up and fetch him out, a child may upset him, grown-ups may  neglect to feed him or to change his water. The temptation to  take him up and massage him must be irresistible to outsiders.  All these dangers the goldfish in the pond avoids; he lives a  sheltered and unexciting life, and when he wants to die he dies  unnoticed, unregretted, but for his brother the tears and the  solemn funeral.    Yes; now that I have thought it out, I can see that I was wrong  in calling the indoor goldfish a symbol of mid-Victorian  futility. An article of this sort is no good if it does not teach  the writer something as well as his readers. I recognize him now  as the symbol of enterprise and endurance, of restlessness and  Post-Impressionism. He is not mid-Victorian, he is Fifth  Georgian.    Which is all I want to say about goldfish.          Saturday to Monday      The happy man would have happy faces round him; a sad face is a  reproach to him for his happiness. So when I escape by the 2.10  on Saturday I distribute largesse with a liberal hand. The  cabman, feeling that an effort is required of him, mentions that  I am the first gentleman he has met that day; he penetrates my  mufti and calls me captain, leaving it open whether he regards me  as a Salvation Army captain or the captain of a barge. The  porters hasten to the door of my cab; there is a little struggle  between them as to who shall have the honour of waiting upon me.  ...    Inside the station things go on as happily. The booking-office  clerk gives me a pleasant smile; he seems to approve of the  station I am taking. \"Some do go to Brighton,\" he implies, \"but  for a gentleman like you--\" He pauses to point out that with this  ticket I can come back on the Tuesday if I like (as, between  ourselves, I hope to do). In exchange for his courtesies I push  him my paper through the pigeon hole. A dirty little boy thrust  it into my cab; I didn't want it, but as we are all being happy  to- day he had his penny.    I follow my porter to the platform. \"On the left,\" says the  ticket collector. He has said it mechanically to a hundred  persons, but he becomes human and kindly as he says it to me. I  feel that he really wishes me to get into the right train, to  have a pleasant journey down, to be welcomed heartily by my  friends when I arrive. It is not as to one of a mob but to an  individual that he speaks.    The porter has found me an empty carriage. He is full of ideas  for my comfort; he tells me which way the train will start, where  we stop, and when we may be expected to arrive. Am I sure I  wouldn't like my bag in the van? Can he get me any papers? No;  no, thanks. I don't want to read. I give him sixpence, and there  is another one of us happy.    Presently the guard. He also seems pleased that I have selected  this one particular station from among so many. Pleased, but not  astonished; he expected it of me. It is a very good run down in  his train, and he shouldn't be surprised if we had a fine week-  end. ...    I stand at the door of ray carriage feeling very happy. It is  good to get out of London. Come to think of it, we are all  getting out of London, and none of us is going to do any work to-  morrow. How jolly! Oh, but what about my porter? Bother! I wish  now I'd given him more than sixpence. Still, he may have a  sweetheart and be happy that way.    We are off. I have nothing to read, but then I want to think. It  is the ideal place in which to think, a railway carriage; the  ideal place in which to be happy. I wonder if I shall be in good  form this week-end at cricket and tennis, and croquet and  billiards, and all the other jolly games I mean to play. Look at  those children trying to play cricket in that dirty backyard.  Poor little beggars! Fancy living in one of those horrible  squalid houses. But you cannot spoil to- day for me, little  backyards. On Tuesday perhaps, when I am coming again to the ugly  town, your misery will make me miserable; I shall ask myself  hopelessly what it all means; but just now I am too happy for  pity. After all, why should I assume that you envy me, you two  children swinging on a gate and waving to me? You are happy,  aren't you? Of course; we are all happy to-day. See, I am waving  back to you.    My eyes wander round the carriage and rest on my bag. Have I put  everything in? Of course I have. Then why this uneasy feeling  that I have left something very important out? Well, I can soon  settle the question. Let's start with to-night. Evening clothes--  they're in, I know. Shirts, collars ...    I go through the whole programme for the week-end, allotting  myself in my mind suitable clothes for each occasion. Yes; I seem  to have brought everything that I can possibly want. But what a  very jolly programme I am drawing up for myself! Will it really  be as delightful as that? Well, it was last time, and the time  before; that is why I am so happy.    The train draws up at its only halt in the glow of a September  mid-afternoon. There is a little pleasant bustle; nice people get  out and nice people meet them; everybody seems very cheery and  contented. Then we are off again ... and now the next station is  mine.    We are there. A porter takes my things with a kindly smile and a  \"Nice day.\" I see Brant outside with the wagonette, not the trap;  then I am not the only guest coming by this train. Who are the  others, I wonder. Anybody I know? ... Why, yes, it's Bob and Mrs.  Bob, and--hallo!--Cynthia! And isn't that old Anderby? How  splendid! I must get that shilling back from Bob that I lost to  him at billiards last time. And if Cynthia really thinks that she  can play croquet ...    We greet each other happily and climb into the wagonette. Never  has the country looked so lovely. \"No; no rain at all,\" says  Brant, \"and the glass is going up.\" The porter puts our luggage  in the cart and comes round with a smile. It is a rotten life  being a porter, and I do so want everybody to enjoy this  afternoon. Besides, I haven't any coppers.    I slip half a crown into his palm. Now we are all very, very  happy.          The Pond      My friend Aldenham's pond stands at a convenient distance from  the house, and is reached by a well-drained gravel path; so that  in any weather one may walk, alone or in company, dry shod to its  brink, and estimate roughly how many inches of rain have fallen  in the night. The ribald call it the hippopotamus pond, tracing a  resemblance between it and the bath of the hippopotamus at the  Zoo, beneath the waters of which, if you particularly desire to  point the hippopotamus out to somebody, he always lies hidden. To  the rest of us it is known simply as \"the pond\"--a designation  which ignores the existence of several neighbouring ponds, the  gifts of nature, and gives the whole credit to the handiwork of  man. For \"the pond\" is just a small artificial affair of cement,  entirely unpretentious.    There are seven steps to the bottom of the pond, and each step is  10 in. high. Thus the steps help to make the pond a convenient  rain- gauge; for obviously when only three steps are left  uncovered, as was the case last Monday, you know that there have  been 40 in. of rain since last month, when the pond began to  fill. To strangers this may seem surprising, and it is only fair  to tell them the great secret, which is that much of the  surrounding land drains secretly into the pond too. This seems to  me to give a much fairer indication of the rain that has fallen  than do the official figures in the newspapers. For when your  whole day's cricket has been spoilt, it is perfectly absurd to be  told that .026 of an inch of rain has done the damage; the soul  yearns for something more startling than that The record of the  pond, that there has been another 5 in., soothes us, where the  record of the ordinary pedantic rain-gauge would leave us  infuriated. It speaks much for my friend Aldenham's breadth of  view that he understood this, and planned the pond accordingly.    A most necessary thing in a country house is that there should be  a recognized meeting-place, where the people who have been  writing a few letters after breakfast may, when they have  finished, meet those who have no intention of writing any, and  arrange plans with them for the  morning. I am one of those who  cannot write letters in another man's house, and when my pipe is  well alight I say to Miss Robinson--or whoever it may be--\"Let's  go and look at the pond.\" \"Right oh,\" she says willingly enough,  having spent the last quarter of an hour with The Times Financial  Supplement, all of the paper that is left to the women in the  first rush for the cricket news. We wander down to the pond  together, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5805"],[0,"The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel (#5)"],[1,"face turned to the  wall, and paid no heed either to his fellow-prisoners or to the  facetious remarks of the warder.    Chauvelin went up to him, made some curt remark. Mole kept an obstinate  shoulder turned towards him--a grimy shoulder, which showed naked  through a wide rent in his blouse. This portion of the cell was  well-nigh in total darkness; the feeble shaft of light which came  through the open door hardly penetrated to this remote angle of the  squalid burrow. The same sense of mystery and unreality overcame  Chauvelin again as he looked on the miserable creature in whom, an hour  ago, he had recognised the super-exquisite Sir Percy Blakeney. Now he  could only see a vague outline in the gloom: the stooping shoulders, the  long limbs, that naked piece of shoulder which caught a feeble reflex  from the distant light. Nor did any amount of none too gentle prodding  on the part of the warder induce him to change his position.    \"Leave him alone,\" said Chauvelin curly at last. \"I have seen all that I  wished to see.\"    The cell was insufferably hot and stuffy. Chauvelin, finical and queasy,  turned away with a shudder of disgust. There was nothing to be got now  out of a prolonged interview with his captured foe. He had seen him:  that was sufficient. He had seen the super-exquisite Sir Percy Blakeney  locked up in a common cell with some of the most scrubby and abject  rogues which the slums of indigent Paris could yield, having apparently  failed in some undertaking which had demanded for its fulfilment not  only tattered clothes and grimy hands, but menial service with a  beggarly and disease-ridden employer, whose very propinquity must have  been positive torture to the fastidious dandy.    Of a truth this was sufficient for the gratification of any revenge.  Chauvelin felt that he could now go contentedly to rest after an  evening's work excellently done.    He gave order that Mole should be put in a separate cell, denied all  intercourse with anyone outside or in the depot, and that he should be  guarded on sight day and night. After that he went his way.      VI    The following morning citizen Chauvelin, of the Committee of Public  Safety, gave due notice to citizen Fouquier-Tinville, the Public  Prosecutor, that the dangerous English spy, known to the world as the  Scarlet Pimpernel, was now safely under lock and key, and that he must  be transferred to the Abbaye prison forthwith and to the guillotine as  quickly as might be. No one was to take any risks this time; there must  be no question either of discrediting his famous League or of obtaining  other more valuable information out of him. Such methods had proved  disastrous in the past.    There were no safe Englishmen these days, except the dead ones, and it  would not take citizen Fouquier-Tinville much thought or time to frame  an indictment against the notorious Scarlet Pimpernel, which would do  away with the necessity of a prolonged trial. The revolutionary  government was at war with England now, and short work could be made of  all poisonous spies.    By order, therefore, of the Committee of Public Safety, the prisoner,  Paul Mole, was taken out of the cells of the depot and conveyed in a  closed carriage to the Abbaye prison. Chauvelin had the pleasure of  watching this gratifying spectacle from the windows of the Commissariat.  When he saw the closed carriage drive away, with Hebert and two men  inside and two others on the box, he turned to citizen Commissary  Cuisinier with a sigh of intense satisfaction.    \"There goes the most dangerous enemy our glorious revolution has had,\"  he said, with an accent of triumph which he did not attempt to disguise.    Cuisinier shrugged his shoulders.    \"Possibly,\" he retorted curtly. \"He did not seem to me to be very  dangerous and his papers were quite in order.\"    To this assertion Chauvelin made no reply. Indeed, how could he explain  to this stolid official the subtle workings of an intriguing brain? Had  he himself not had many a proof of how little the forging of identity  papers or of passports troubled the members of that accursed League? Had  he not seen the Scarlet Pimpernel, that exquisite Sir Percy Blakeney,  under disguises that were so grimy and so loathsome that they would have  repelled the most abject, suborned spy?    Indeed, all that was wanted now was the assurance that Hebert--who  himself had a deadly and personal grudge against the Scarlet  Pimpernel--would not allow him for one moment out of his sight.    Fortunately as to this, there was no fear. One hint to Hebert and the  man was as keen, as determined, as Chauvelin himself.    \"Set your mind at rest, citizen,\" he said with a rough oath. \"I guessed  how matters stood the moment you gave me the order. I knew you would not  take all that trouble for a real Paul Mole. But have no fear! That  accursed Englishman has not been one second out of my sight, from the  moment I arrested him in the late citizen Marat's lodgings, and by  Satan! he shall not be either, until I have seen his impudent head fall  under the guillotine.\"    He himself, he added, had seen to the arrangements for the disposal of  the prisoner in the Abbaye: an inner cell, partially partitioned off in  one of the guard-rooms, with no egress of its own, and only a tiny  grated air-hole high up in the wall, which gave on an outside corridor,  and through which not even a cat could manage to slip. Oh! the prisoner  was well guarded! The citizen Representative need, of a truth, have no  fear! Three or four men--of the best and most trustworthy--had not left  the guard-room since the morning. He himself (Hebert) had kept the  accursed Englishman in sight all night, had personally conveyed him to  the Abbaye, and had only left the guard-room a moment ago in order to  speak with the citizen Representative. He was going back now at once,  and would not move until the order came for the prisoner to be conveyed  to the Court of Justice and thence to summary execution.    For the nonce, Hebert concluded with a complacent chuckle, the  Englishman was still crouching dejectedly in a corner of his new cell,  with little of him visible save that naked shoulder through his torn  shirt, which, in the process of transference from one prison to another,  had become a shade more grimy than before.    Chauvelin nodded, well satisfied. He commended Hebert for his zeal,  rejoiced with him over the inevitable triumph. It would be well to  avenge that awful humiliation at Calais last September. Nevertheless, he  felt anxious and nervy; he could not comprehend the apathy assumed by  the factitious Mole. That the apathy was assumed Chauvelin was keen  enough to guess. What it portended he could not conjecture. But that the  Englishman would make a desperate attempt at escape was, of course, a  foregone conclusion. It rested with Hebert and a guard that could  neither be bribed nor fooled into treachery, to see that such an attempt  remained abortive.    What, however, had puzzled citizen Chauvelin all along was the motive  which had induced Sir Percy Blakeney to play the role of menial to Jean  Paul Marat. Behind it there lay, undoubtedly, one of those subtle  intrigues for which that insolent Scarlet Pimpernel was famous; and with  it was associated an attempt at theft upon the murdered body of the  demagogue ... an attempt which had failed, seeing that the  supposititious Paul Mole had been searched and nothing suspicious been  found upon his person.    Nevertheless, thoughts of that attempted theft disturbed Chauvelin's  equanimity. The old legend of the crumpled roseleaf was applicable in  his case. Something of his intense satisfaction would pale if this final  enterprise of the audacious adventurer were to be brought to a  triumphant close in the end.      VII    That same forenoon, on his return from the Abbaye and the depot,  Chauvelin found that a visitor was waiting for him. A woman, who gave  her name as Jeannette Marechal, desired to speak with the citizen  Representative. Chauvelin knew the woman as his colleague Marat's  maid-of-all-work, and he gave orders that she should be admitted at  once.    Jeannette Marechal, tearful and not a little frightened, assured the  citizen Representative that her errand was urgent. Her late employer had  so few friends; she did not know to whom to turn until she bethought  herself of citizen Chauvelin. It took him some little time to  disentangle the tangible facts out of the woman's voluble narrative. At  first the words: \"Child ... Chemin de Pantin ... Leridan,\" were only a  medley of sounds which conveyed no meaning to his ear. But when occasion  demanded, citizen Chauvelin was capable of infinite patience. Gradually  he understood what the woman was driving at.    \"The child, citizen!\" she reiterated excitedly. \"What's to be done about  him? I know that citizen Marat would have wished--\"    \"Never mind now what citizen Marat would have wished,\" Chauvelin broke  in quietly. \"Tell me first who this child is.\"    \"I do not know, citizen,\" she replied.    \"How do you mean, you do not know? Then I pray you, citizeness, what is  all this pother about?\"    \"About the child, citizen,\" reiterated Jeannette obstinately.    \"What child?\"    \"The child whom citizen Marat adopted last year and kept at that awful  house on the Chemin de Pantin.\"    \"I did not know citizen Marat had adopted a child,\" remarked Chauvelin  thoughtfully.    \"No one knew,\" she rejoined. \"Not even citizeness Evrard. I was the only  one who knew. I had to go and see the child once every month. It was a  wretched, miserable brat,\" the woman went on, her shrivelled old breast  vaguely stirred, mayhap, by some atrophied feeling of motherhood. \"More  than half-starved ... and the look in its eyes, citizen! It was enough  to make you cry! I could see by his poor little emaciated body and his  nice little hands and feet that he ought never to have been put in"]]]
