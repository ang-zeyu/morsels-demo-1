They were, in fact, the type of men of whom England is  proudest--the back-bone of a great country, toilers in the mart,  untired businessmen, keen red-blooded men of affairs. If they played a  little golf besides, who shall blame them?    So they went on, day by day, happy and contented. And then the Woman  came into their lives, like the Serpent in the Links of Eden, and  perhaps for the first time they realized that they were not one  entity--not one single, indivisible Something that made for topped  drives and short putts--but two individuals, in whose breasts Nature  had implanted other desires than the simple ambition some day to do the  dog-leg hole on the second nine in under double figures. My friends  tell me that, when I am relating a story, my language is inclined at  times a little to obscure my meaning; but, if you understand from what  I have been saying that James Todd and Peter Willard both fell in love  with the same woman--all right, let us carry on. That is precisely what  I was driving at.    I have not the pleasure of an intimate acquaintance with Grace  Forrester. I have seen her in the distance, watering the flowers in her  garden, and on these occasions her stance struck me as graceful. And  once, at a picnic, I observed her killing wasps with a teaspoon, and  was impressed by the freedom of the wrist-action of her back-swing.  Beyond this, I can say little. But she must have been attractive, for  there can be no doubt of the earnestness with which both Peter and  James fell in love with her. I doubt if either slept a wink the night  of the dance at which it was their privilege first to meet her.    The next afternoon, happening to encounter Peter in the bunker near the  eleventh green, James said:    \"That was a nice girl, that Miss What's-her-name.\"    And Peter, pausing for a moment from his trench-digging, replied:    \"Yes.\"    And then James, with a pang, knew that he had a rival, for he had not  mentioned Miss Forrester's name, and yet Peter had divined that it was  to her that he had referred.    Love is a fever which, so to speak, drives off without wasting time on  the address. On the very next morning after the conversation which I  have related, James Todd rang Peter Willard up on the 'phone and  cancelled their golf engagements for the day, on the plea of a sprained  wrist. Peter, acknowledging the cancellation, stated that he himself  had been on the point of ringing James up to say that he would be  unable to play owing to a slight headache. They met at tea-time at Miss  Forrester's house. James asked how Peter's headache was, and Peter said  it was a little better. Peter inquired after James's sprained wrist,  and was told it seemed on the mend. Miss Forrester dispensed tea and  conversation to both impartially.    They walked home together. After an awkward silence of twenty minutes,  James said:    \"There is something about the atmosphere--the aura, shall I say?--that  emanates from a good woman that makes a man feel that life has a new, a  different meaning.\"    Peter replied:    \"Yes.\"    When they reached James's door, James said:    \"I won't ask you in tonight, old man. You want to go home and rest and  cure that headache.\"    \"Yes,\" said Peter.    There was another silence. Peter was thinking that, only a couple of  days before, James had told him that he had a copy of Sandy MacBean's  \"How to Become a Scratch Man Your First Season by Studying Photographs\"  coming by parcel-post from town, and they had arranged to read it aloud  together. By now, thought Peter, it must be lying on his friend's  table. The thought saddened him. And James, guessing what was in  Peter's mind, was saddened too. But he did not waver. He was in no mood  to read MacBean's masterpiece that night. In the twenty minutes of  silence after leaving Miss Forrester he had realized that \"Grace\"  rhymes with \"face\", and he wanted to sit alone in his study and write  poetry. The two men parted with a distant nod. I beg your pardon? Yes,  you are right. Two distant nods. It was always a failing of mine to  count the score erroneously.    It is not my purpose to weary you by a minute recital of the happenings  of each day that went by. On the surface, the lives of these two men  seemed unchanged. They still played golf together, and during the round  achieved towards each other a manner that, superficially, retained all  its ancient cheeriness and affection. If--I should say--when, James  topped his drive, Peter never failed to say \"Hard luck!\" And when--or,  rather, if Peter managed not to top his, James invariably said \"Great!\"  But things were not the same, and they knew it.    It so happened, as it sometimes will on these occasions, for Fate is a  dramatist who gets his best effects with a small cast, that Peter  Willard and James Todd were the only visible aspirants for the hand of  Miss Forrester. Right at the beginning young Freddie Woosley had seemed  attracted by the girl, and had called once or twice with flowers and  chocolates, but Freddie's affections never centred themselves on one  object for more than a few days, and he had dropped out after the first  week. From that time on it became clear to all of us that, if Grace  Forrester intended to marry anyone in the place, it would be either  James or Peter; and a good deal of interest was taken in the matter by  the local sportsmen. So little was known of the form of the two men,  neither having figured as principal in a love-affair before, that even  money was the best you could get, and the market was sluggish. I think  my own flutter of twelve golf-balls, taken up by Percival Brown, was  the most substantial of any of the wagers. I selected James as the  winner. Why, I can hardly say, unless that he had an aunt who  contributed occasional stories to the \"Woman's Sphere\". These things  sometimes weigh with a girl. On the other hand, George Lucas, who had  half-a-dozen of ginger-ale on Peter, based his calculations on the fact  that James wore knickerbockers on the links, and that no girl could  possibly love a man with calves like that. In short, you see, we really  had nothing to go on.    Nor had James and Peter. The girl seemed to like them both equally.  They never saw her except in each other's company. And it was not until  one day when Grace Forrester was knitting a sweater that there seemed a  chance of getting a clue to her hidden feelings.    When the news began to spread through the place that Grace was knitting  this sweater there was a big sensation. The thing seemed to us  practically to amount to a declaration.    That was the view that James Todd and Peter Willard took of it, and  they used to call on Grace, watch her knitting, and come away with  their heads full of complicated calculations. The whole thing hung on  one point--to wit, what size the sweater was going to be. If it was  large, then it must be for Peter; if small, then James was the lucky  man. Neither dared to make open inquiries, but it began to seem almost  impossible to find out the truth without them. No masculine eye can  reckon up purls and plains and estimate the size of chest which the  garment is destined to cover. Moreover, with amateur knitters there  must always be allowed a margin for involuntary error. There were many  cases during the war where our girls sent sweaters to their sweethearts  which would have induced strangulation in their young brothers. The  amateur sweater of those days was, in fact, practically tantamount to  German propaganda.    Peter and James were accordingly baffled. One evening the sweater would  look small, and James would come away jubilant; the next it would have  swollen over a vast area, and Peter would walk home singing. The  suspense of the two men can readily be imagined. On the one hand, they  wanted to know their fate; on the other, they fully realized that  whoever the sweater was for would have to wear it. And, as it was a  vivid pink and would probably not fit by a mile, their hearts quailed  at the prospect.    In all affairs of human tension there must come a breaking point. It  came one night as the two men were walking home.    \"Peter,\" said James, stopping in mid-stride. He mopped his forehead.  His manner had been feverish all the evening.    \"Yes?\" said Peter.    \"I can't stand this any longer. I haven't had a good night's rest for  weeks. We must find out definitely which of us is to have that  sweater.\"    \"Let's go back and ask her,\" said Peter.    So they turned back and rang the bell and went into the house and  presented themselves before Miss Forrester.    \"Lovely evening,\" said James, to break the ice.    \"Superb,\" said Peter.    \"Delightful,\" said Miss Forrester, looking a little surprised at  finding the troupe playing a return date without having booked it in  advance.    \"To settle a bet,\" said James, \"will you please tell us who--I should  say, whom--you are knitting that sweater for?\"    \"It is not a sweater,\" replied Miss Forrester, with a womanly candour  that well became her. \"It is a sock. And it is for my cousin Juliet's  youngest son, Willie.\"    \"Good night,\" said James.    \"Good night,\" said Peter.    \"Good night,\" said Grace Forrester.    It was during the long hours of the night, when ideas so often come to  wakeful men, that James was struck by an admirable solution of his and  Peter's difficulty. It seemed to him that, were one or the other to  leave Woodhaven, the survivor would find himself in a position to  conduct his wooing as wooing should be conducted. Hitherto, as I have  indicated, neither had allowed the other to be more than a few minutes  alone with the girl. They watched each other like hawks. When James  called, Peter called. When Peter dropped in, James invariably popped  round. The thing had resolved itself into a stalemate.    The idea which now came to James was that he and Peter should settle  their rivalry by an eighteen-hole match on the links."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7037"],[0,"Beric the Briton : a Story of the Roman Invasion (#5)"],[1,"apartment,  where Caius received distinguished guests, and where, in the  lifetime of Julia, entertainments were given to the ladies of the  colony. Like the triclinium, this room was also partially open at  both ends, affording the guests a view of the graceful fountain  on the one side and of the garden on the other. In winter wooden  frames, with heavy hangings, were erected across these openings  and that of the tablinum, for the Romans soon found the necessity  for modifying the arrangements which, although well suited for an  Italian climate, were wholly unfit for that of Britain. The opening  in the centre of the atrium was then closed with an awning of  oiled canvas, which admitted a certain amount of light to pass,  but prevented the passage of rain and snow, and kept out much of  the cold. There was a narrow passage between the atrium and the  peristylium; this was called the fauces. Above the chambers round  the atrium was a second story, approached by a staircase from the  peristylium; here were the apartments of the ladies and of the  female slaves.    As Beric entered the atrium, a man, who was reading a roll of  parchment, rose to his feet.    \"Welcome, Beric!\" he said warmly.    \"All hail, preceptor!\" the lad replied. \"Are all well here?\"    \"All well, Beric. We had looked to see you before, and Berenice  has been constantly asking me when you were coming.\"    \"I had been absent over four years, you see,\" Beric replied, \"and  it was not easy to get away from home again. Now I must speak to  Caius.\" He crossed the apartment, and stood at the entrance to the  tablinum. Caius looked up from a military treatise he was perusing.    \"Ah, Beric! it is you! I am glad to see you again, though I am  sorry to observe that you have abandoned our fashions and taken to  the native garb again.\"    \"It was necessary, Caius,\" Beric said. \"I should have lost all  influence with the tribe had I not laid aside my Roman dress. As it  is, they regard me with some doubt, as one too enamoured of Roman  customs.\"    \"We have heard of you, Beric, and, indeed, report says that you  speak well of us, and are already famous for your relations of our  history.\"    \"I thought it well that my countrymen should know your great deeds,\"  Beric said, \"and should see by what means you have come to rule  the world. I received nought but kindness at your hands, and no  prisoner's lot was ever made more easy than mine. To you and yours  I am deeply grateful. If your people all behaved as kindly towards  the natives of this country as you did to me, Britain would be  conquered without need of drawing sword from scabbard.\"    \"I know not that, Beric; to rule, one should be strong as well  as kind. Still, as you know, I think that things might have been  arranged far less harshly than they have been. It was needful that  we should show ourselves to be masters; but I regret the harshness  that has been too often used, and I would that not one of us here,  from the governor down to the poorest soldier, was influenced by a  desire for gain, but that each was animated, as he assuredly should  be, only by a desire to uphold the glory and power of Rome. But  that would be expecting too much from human nature, and even among  you there are plenty ready to side against their countrymen for the  sake of Roman gold. In that they have less excuse than we. Custom  and habit have made our wants many, and all aim at attaining the  luxuries of the rich. On the other hand, your wants are few, and  I see not that the piling up of wealth adds in any way to your  happiness.\"    \"That is true, Caius. I quite agree with you that it is far more  excusable for a Roman to covet wealth than for a Briton; and while  I blame many officials and soldiers for the harshness with which  they strive to wring all their possessions from my countrymen, I  deem their conduct as worthy and honourable when compared with that  of Britons who sell their country for your gold.\"    \"We must take the world as we find it, Beric. We may regret that  greed and the love of luxury should influence men, as we may grieve  that they are victims of other base passions; but it is of no use  quarrelling with human nature. Certain it is that all vices bring  their own punishment, and that the Romans were a far nobler race  when they were poor and simple, in the days of the early consuls,  than they are now, with all their power, their riches, and their  luxuries. Such is the history of all peoples--of Egypt, of Persia,  of Greece, and Carthage; and methinks that Rome, too, will run the  course of other nations, and that some day, far distant maybe, she  will sink beneath the weight of her power and her luxury, and that  some younger and more vigorous people will, bit by bit, wrest her  dominions from her and rule in her place.    \"As yet, happily, I see no signs of failing in her powers. She is  still vigorous, and even in the distant outskirts of the empire  the wave of conquest flows onward. Happily for us, I think, it can  flow no farther this way; there is but one island beyond this to  conquer, and then, as in Western Gaul and Iberia, the ocean says  to Rome, 'Thou shalt go no farther.' Would that to the south, the  east, and north a similar barrier checked our progress, then we  could rest and be content, and need no longer waste our strength  in fresh conquests, or in opposing the incursions of hordes of  barbarians from regions unknown to us even by report. I could wish  myself, Beric, that nature had placed your island five days' sail  from the coasts of Gaul, instead of placing it within sight. Then  I might have been enjoying life in my villa among the Tuscan hills  with my daughter, instead of being exposed at any moment to march  with the Legion against the savage mountaineers of the west. Ah!  here comes Berenice,\" he broke off, as his daughter, attended by her  old nurse, entered the atrium from the vestibule. She hastened her  steps as she saw Beric standing before her father in the tablinum.    \"I knew you would come back, Beric, because you promised me; but  you have been a long time in keeping your word.\"    \"I am not my own master at home, any more than I was here, Berenice,\"  he said, \"and my mother would not hear before of my leaving her. I  have only come now for an hour's visit, to see that all goes well  in this house, and to tell you that I had not forgotten my promise;  the next time I hope to pay a longer visit. At daybreak tomorrow  we have a party to hunt the wolves, which have so multiplied as to  become a danger in the forests of late.\"    \"I should like to go out to see a wolf hunt, Beric.\"    \"I fear that would not be possible,\" he said; \"the woods are thick  and tangled, and we have to force our way through to get to their  lair.\"    \"But last winter they came close to the town, and I heard that some  came even into the streets.\"    \"Yes, they will do so when driven by hunger; but they were hunting  then and not being hunted. No, Berenice, I fear that your wish to  see a wolf hunt cannot be gratified; they are savage beasts, and  are great trouble and no loss to us. In winter they carry off many  children, and sometimes devour grown up people, and in times of  long snow have been known to attack large parties, and, in spite  of a stout resistance by the men, to devour them. In summer they  are only met singly, but in winter they go in packs and kill numbers  of our cattle.\"    \"I should like to go into the woods,\" the girl said earnestly, \"I  am tired of this town. My father says he will take me with him some  day when he goes west, but so far I have seen nothing except this  town and Verulamium, and the country was all just as it is here,  fields and cultivation. We could see the forests in the distance,  but that was all. My father says, that if we went west, we should  travel for miles through the forest and should sleep in tents, but  that we cannot do it till everything is quiet and peaceful. Oh,  Beric! I do wish the Britons would not be always fighting.\"    Beric smiled. \"The British girls, Berenice, say they wish the Romans  would not be always fighting.\"    \"It is very troublesome,\" she said pettishly. \"I should like  everyone to be friends, and then there would be no need to have so  many soldiers in Britain, and perhaps the emperor would order our  legions home. Father says that we ought to look upon this as home  now, for that the legion may remain here for years and years; but  he said the other day that he thought that if everything was quiet  here he should, when I am sixteen years old, obtain leave from the  governor, and go back to Rome for two or three years, and I think,  though he has not said so outright, that he will perhaps retire  and settle there.\"    \"It would be much the best for you,\" Beric said earnestly. \"I should be  sorry, because you have been very kind to me, and I should grieve  were you to leave me altogether; but there may be trouble here  again some day, and I think it would be far better for you to be  back in Rome, where you would have all the pleasures and delights  of the great capital, and live in ease and comfort, without the  risk of your father having to march away to the wars. I know that  if I were your father I would take you back. He says that his villa  there is exactly like this, and you have many relations there,  and there must be all sorts of pleasures and grand spectacles far  beyond anything there is here. I am sure it would be better for  you, and happier.\"    \"I thought that you would be quite sorry,\" she said gravely.    \"So I shall be very sorry for myself,\" Beric said; \"as, next to  my own mother, there is no one I care for so much as you and your  father. I shall miss you terribly; but yet I am so sure that it  would be best for you to be at home with your own people, that I  should be glad to hear that your father was going to take you back  to Rome.\"    But Berenice did not altogether"]]]
