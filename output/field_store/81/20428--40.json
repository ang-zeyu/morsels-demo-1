And she still sat staring straight  before her, raving; but here voice was gentler now, there were more chimes  in it, and occasional song. Midnight passed, and the rain still swept down  on me, and still the solitudes of the mountain were full of the mutterings  of the poor mad city. And the hours after midnight came, the cold hours  wherein sick men die.    \"Suddenly I was aware of great shapes moving in the rain, and heard the  sound of voices that were not of my city nor yet of any that I ever knew.  And presently I discerned, though faintly, the souls of a great concourse  of cities, all bending over Andelsprutz and comforting her, and the  ravines of the mountains roared that night with the voices of cities that  had lain still for centuries. For there came the soul of Camelot that had  so long ago forsaken Usk; and there was Ilion, all girt with towers, still  cursing the sweet face of ruinous Helen; I saw there Babylon and  Persepolis, and the bearded face of bull-like Nineveh, and Athens mourning  her immortal gods.    \"All these souls if cities that were dead spoke that night on the mountain  to my city and soothed her, until at last she muttered of war no longer,  and her eyes stared wildly no more, but she hid her face in her hands and  for some while wept softly. At last she arose, and walking slowly and with  bended head, and leaning upon Ilion and Carthage, went mournfully  eastwards; and the dust of her highways swirled behind her as she went, a  ghostly dust that never turned to mud in all that drenching rain. And so  the souls of the cities led her away, and gradually they disappeared from  the mountain, and the ancient voices died away in the distance.    \"Now since then have I seen my city alive; but once I met with a traveler  who said that somewhere in the midst of a great desert are gathered  together the souls of all dead cities. He said that he was lost once in a  place where there was no water, and he heard their voices speaking all the  night.\"    But I said: \"I was once without water in a desert and heard a city  speaking to me, but knew not whether it really spoke to me or not, for on  that day I heard so many terrible things, and only some of them were  true.\"    And the man with the black hair said: \"I believe it to be true, though  whither she went I know not. I only know that a shepherd found me in the  morning faint with hunger and cold, and carried me down here; and when I  came to Andelsprutz it was, as you have perceived it, dead.\"          WHERE THE TIDES EBB AND FLOW      I dreamt that I had done a horrible thing, so that burial was to be denied  me either in soil or sea, neither could there be any hell for me.    I waited for some hours, knowing this. Then my friends came for me, and  slew me secretly and with ancient rite, and lit great tapers, and carried  me away.    It was all in London that the thing was done, and they went furtively at  dead of night along grey streets and among mean houses until they came to  the river. And the river and the tide of the sea were grappling with one  another between the mud-banks, and both of them were black and full of  lights. A sudden wonder came in to the eyes of each, as my friends came  near to them with their glaring tapers. All these things I saw as they  carried me dead and stiffening, for my soul was still among my bones,  because there was no hell for it, and because Christian burial was denied  me.    They took me down a stairway that was green with slimy things, and so came  slowly to the terrible mud. There, in the territory of forsaken things,  they dug a shallow grave. When they had finished they laid me in the  grave, and suddenly they cast their tapers to the river. And when the  water had quenched the flaring lights the tapers looked pale and small as  they bobbed upon the tide, and at once the glamour of the calamity was  gone, and I noticed then the approach of the huge dawn; and my friends  cast their cloaks over their faces, and the solemn procession was turned  into many fugitives that furtively stole away.    Then the mud came back wearily and covered all but my face. There I lay  alone with quite forgotten things, with drifting things that the tides  will take no farther, with useless things and lost things, and with the  horrible unnatural bricks that are neither stone nor soil. I was rid of  feeling, because I had been killed, but perception and thought were in my  unhappy soul. The dawn widened, and I saw the desolate houses that crowded  the marge of the river, and their dead windows peered into my dead eyes,  windows with bales behind them instead of human souls. I grew so weary  looking at these forlorn things that I wanted to cry out, but could not,  because I was dead. Then I knew, as I had never known before, that for all  the years that herd of desolate houses had wanted to cry out too, but,  being dead, were dumb. And I knew then that it had yet been well with the  forgotten drifting things if they had wept, but they were eyeless and  without life. And I, too, tried to weep, but there were no tears in my  dead eyes. And I knew then that the river might have cared for us, might  have caressed us, might have sung to us, but he swept broadly onwards,  thinking of nothing but the princely ships.    At last the tide did what the river would not, and came and covered me  over, and my soul had rest in the green water, and rejoiced and believed  that it had the Burial of the Sea. But with the ebb the water fell again,  and left me alone again with the callous mud among the forgotten things  that drift no more, and with the sight of all those desolate houses, and  with the knowledge among all of us that each was dead.    In the mournful wall behind me, hung with green weeds, forsaken of the  sea, dark tunnels appeared, and secret narrow passages that were clamped  and barred. From these at last the stealthy rats came down to nibble me  away, and my soul rejoiced thereat and believed that he would be free  perforce from the accursed bones to which burial was refused. Very soon  the rats ran away a little space and whispered among themselves. They  never came any more. When I found that I was accursed even among the rats  I tried to weep again.    Then the tide came swinging back and covered the dreadful mud, and hid the  desolate houses, and soothed the forgotten things, and my soul had ease  for a while in the sepulture of the sea. And then the tide forsook me  again.    To and fro it came about me for many years. Then the County Council found  me, and gave me decent burial. It was the first grave that I had ever  slept in. That very night my friends came for me. They dug me up and put  me back again in the shallow hold in the mud.    Again and again through the years my bones found burial, but always behind  the funeral lurked one of those terrible men who, as soon as night fell,  came and dug them up and carried them back again to the hole in the mud.    And then one day the last of those men died who once had done to me this  terrible thing. I heard his soul go over the river at sunset.    And again I hoped.    A few weeks afterwards I was found once more, and once more taken out of  that restless place and given deep burial in sacred ground, where my soul  hoped that it should rest.    Almost at once men came with cloaks and tapers to give me back to the mud,  for the thing had become a tradition and a rite. And all the forsaken  things mocked me in their dumb hearts when they saw me carried back, for  they were jealous of me because I had left the mud. It must be remembered  that I could not weep.    And the years went by seawards where the black barges go, and the great  derelict centuries became lost at sea, and still I lay there without any  cause to hope, and daring not to hope without a cause, because of the  terrible envy and the anger of the things that could drift no more.    Once a great storm rode up, even as far as London, out of the sea from the  South; and he came curving into the river with the fierce East wind. And  he was mightier than the dreary tides, and went with great leaps over the  listless mud. And all the sad forgotten things rejoiced, and mingled with  things that were haughtier than they, and rode once more amongst the  lordly shipping that was driven up and down. And out of their hideous home  he took my bones, never again, I hoped, to be vexed with the ebb and flow.  And with the fall of the tide he went riding down the river and turned to  the southwards, and so went to his home. And my bones he scattered among  many isles and along the shores of happy alien mainlands. And for a  moment, while they were far asunder, my soul was almost free.    Then there arose, at the will of the moon, the assiduous flow of the tide,  and it undid at once the work of the ebb, and gathered my bones from the  marge of sunny isles, and gleaned them all along the mainland's shores,  and went rocking northwards till it came to the mouth of the Thames, and  there turned westwards its relentless face, and so went up the river and  came to the hole in the mud, and into it dropped my bones; and partly the  mud covered them, and partly it left them white, for the mud cares not for  its forsaken things.    Then the ebb came, and I saw the dead eyes of the houses and the jealousy  of the other forgotten things that the storm had not carried thence.    And some more centuries passed over the ebb and flow and over the  loneliness of things for gotten. And I lay there all the while in the  careless grip of the mud, never wholly covered, yet never able to go free,  and I longed for the great caress of the warm Earth or the comfortable lap  of the Sea.    Sometimes men found my bones and buried them, but the tradition never  died, and my friends' successors always brought them back.

When I was a boy, and for the first time wrote a set of French verses  for the letter-box, I was so shy when they were read that I hid under  the table, and sat there the whole evening until I was pulled out by  force.    For a long time after, I wrote no more, and was always fonder of hearing  other people's compositions read than my own.    All the events of our life at Yasnaya Polyana found their echo in one  way or another in the letter-box, and no one was spared, not even the  grown-ups.    All our secrets, all our love-affairs, all the incidents of our  complicated life were revealed in the letter-box, and both household and  visitors were good-humoredly made fun of.    Unfortunately, much of the correspondence has been lost, but bits of  it have been preserved by some of us in copies or in memory. I cannot  recall everything interesting that there was in it, but here are a few  of the more interesting things from the period of the eighties.          THE LETTER-BOX    THE old fogy continues his questions. Why, when women or old men enter  the room, does every well-bred person not only offer them a seat, but  give them up his own?    Why do they make Ushakof or some Servian officer who comes to pay a  visit necessarily stay to tea or dinner?    Why is it considered wrong to let an older person or a woman help you on  with your overcoat?    And why are all these charming rules considered obligatory toward  others, when every day ordinary people come, and we not only do not ask  them to sit down or to stop to dinner or spend the night or render them  any service, but would look on it as the height of impropriety?    Where do those people end to whom we are under these obligations? By  what characteristics are the one sort distinguished from the others? And  are not all these rules of politeness bad, if they do not extend to all  sorts of people? And is not what we call politeness an illusion, and a  very ugly illusion?                                                   LYOFF TOLSTOY.      Question: Which is the most \"beastly plague,\" a cattle-plague case for a  farmer, or the ablative case for a school-boy?                                                   LYOFF TOLSTOY.      Answers are requested to the following questions:    Why do Ustyusha, Masha, Alyona, Peter, etc., have to bake, boil, sweep,  empty slops, wait at table, while the gentry have only to eat, gobble,  quarrel, make slops, and eat again?                                                   LYOFF TOLSTOY.    My Aunt Tanya, when she was in a bad temper because the coffee-pot had  been spilt or because she had been beaten at croquet, was in the habit  of sending every one to the devil. My father wrote the following story,  \"Susoitchik,\" about it.      The devil, not the chief devil, but one of the rank and file, the one  charged with the management of social affairs, Susoitchik by name, was  greatly perturbed on the 6th of August, 1884. From the early morning  onward, people kept arriving who had been sent him by Tatyana Kuzminsky.    The first to arrive was Alexander Mikhailovitch Kuzminsky; the second  was Misha Islavin; the third was Vyatcheslaf; the fourth was Seryozha  Tolstoy, and last of all came old Lyoff Tolstoy, senior, accompanied  by Prince Urusof. The first visitor, Alexander Mikhailovitch, caused  Susoitchik no surprise, as he often paid Susoitchik visits in obedience  to the behests of his wife.    \"What, has your wife sent you again?\"    \"Yes,\" replied the presiding judge of the district-court, shyly, not  knowing what explanation he could give of the cause of his visit.    \"You come here very often. What do you want?\"    \"Oh, nothing in particular; she just sent her compliments,\" murmured  Alexander Mikhailovitch, departing from the exact truth with some  effort.    \"Very good, very good; come whenever you like; she is one of my best  workers.\"    Before Susoitchik had time to show the judge out, in came all the  children, laughing and jostling, and hiding one behind the other.    \"What brought you here, youngsters? Did my little Tanyitchka send you?  That's right; no harm in coming. Give my compliments to Tanya, and  tell her that I am always at her service. Come whenever you like. Old  Susoitchik may be of use to you.\"    No sooner had the young folk made their bow than old Lyoff Tolstoy  appeared with Prince Urusof.    \"Aha! so it's the old boy! Many thanks to Tanyitchka. It's a long time  since I have seen you, old chap. Well and hearty? And what can I do for  you?\"    Lyoff Tolstoy shuffled about, rather abashed.    Prince Urusof, mindful of the etiquette of diplomatic receptions,  stepped forward and explained Tolstoy's appearance by his wish to make  acquaintance with Tatyana Andreyevna's oldest and most faithful friend.    \"Les amis des nos amis sont nos amis.\"    \"Ha! ha! ha! quite so!\" said Susoitchik. \"I must reward her for to-day's  work. Be so kind, Prince, as to hand her the marks of my good-will.\"    And he handed over the insignia of an order in a morocco case. The  insignia consisted of a necklace of imp's tails to be worn about the  throat, and two toads, one to be worn on the bosom and the other on the  bustle.    LYOFF TOLSTOY, SENIOR.          SERGEI NIKOLAYEVITCH TOLSTOY    I CAN remember my Uncle Seryozha (Sergei) from my earliest childhood. He  lived at Pirogovo, twenty miles from Yasnaya, and visited us often.    As a young man he was very handsome. He had the same features as my  father, but he was slenderer and more aristocratic-looking. He had the  same oval face, the same nose, the same intelligent gray eyes, and the  same thick, overhanging eyebrows. The only difference between his face  and my father's was defined by the fact that in those distant days,  when my father cared for his personal appearance, he was always worrying  about his ugliness, while Uncle Seryozha was considered, and really was,  a very handsome man.    This is what my father says about Uncle Seryozha in his fragmentary  reminiscences:    \"I and Nitenka [11] were chums, Nikolenka I revered, but Seryozha I  admired enthusiastically and imitated; I loved him and wished to be he.    \"I admired his handsome exterior, his singing,--he was always a  singer,--his drawing, his gaiety, and above all, however strange a thing  it may seem to say, the directness of his egoism. [12]    \"I always remembered myself, was aware of myself, always divined rightly  or wrongly what others thought about me and felt toward me; and this  spoiled the joy of life for me. This was probably the reason why I  particularly delighted in the opposite of this in other people; namely,  directness of egoism. That is what I especially loved in Seryozha,  though the word 'loved' is inexact.    \"I loved Nikolenka, but I admired Seryozha as something alien and  incomprehensible to me. It was a human life very beautiful, but  completely incomprehensible to me, mysterious, and therefore especially  attractive.    \"He died only a few days ago, and while he was ill and while he was  dying he was just as inscrutable and just as dear to me as he had been  in the distant days of our childhood.    \"In these latter days, in our old age, he was fonder of me, valued my  attachment more, was prouder of me, wanted to agree with me, but could  not, and remained just the same as he had always been; namely, something  quite apart, only himself, handsome, aristocratic, proud, and, above  all, truthful and sincere to a degree that I never met in any other man.    \"He was what he was; he concealed nothing, and did not wish to appear  anything different.\"    Uncle Seryozha never treated children affectionately; on the contrary,  he seemed to put up with us rather than to like us. But we always  treated him with particular reverence. The result, as I can see now,  partly of his aristocratic appearance, but chiefly because of the fact  that he called my father \"Lyovotchka\" and treated him just as my father  treated us.    He was not only not in the least afraid of him, but was always teasing  him, and argued with him like an elder person with a younger. We were  quite alive to this.    Of course every one knew that there were no faster dogs in the world  than our black-and-white Darling and her daughter Wizard. Not a hare  could get away from them. But Uncle Seryozha said that the gray hares  about us were sluggish creatures, not at all the same thing as steppe  hares, and neither Darling nor Wizard would get near a steppe hare.    We listened with open mouths, and did not know which to believe, papa or  Uncle Seryozha.    Uncle Seryozha went out coursing with us one day. A number of gray  hares were run down, not one, getting away; Uncle Seryozha expressed  no surprise, but still maintained that the only reason was because they  were a poor lot of hares. We could not tell whether he was right or  wrong.    Perhaps, after all, he was right, for he was more of a sportsman than  papa and had run down ever so many wolves, while we had never known papa  run any wolves down.    Afterward papa kept dogs only because there was Agafya Mikhailovna to be  thought of, and Uncle Seryozha gave up sport because it was impossible  to keep dogs.    \"Since the emancipation of the peasants,\" he said, \"sport is out of the  question; there are no huntsmen to be had, and the peasants turn out  with sticks and drive the sportsmen off the fields. What is there left  to do nowadays? Country life has become impossible.\"    With all his good breeding and sincerity, Uncle Seryozha never concealed  any characteristic but one; with the utmost shyness he concealed the  tenderness of his affections, and if it ever forced itself into the  light, it was only in exceptional circumstances and that against his  will.    He displayed with peculiar clearness a family characteristic which was  partly shared by my father,"]]]
