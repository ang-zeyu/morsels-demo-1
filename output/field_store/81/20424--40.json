for it is             great.    19:025:012 What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in             the way that he shall choose.    19:025:013 His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the             earth.    19:025:014 The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will             shew them his covenant.    19:025:015 Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet             out of the net.    19:025:016 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate             and afflicted.    19:025:017 The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of             my distresses.    19:025:018 Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my             sins.    19:025:019 Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me             with cruel hatred.    19:025:020 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I             put my trust in thee.    19:025:021 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.    19:025:022 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.    19:026:001 Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have             trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide.    19:026:002 Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.    19:026:003 For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked             in thy truth.    19:026:004 I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with             dissemblers.    19:026:005 I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit             with the wicked.    19:026:006 I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine             altar, O LORD:    19:026:007 That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of             all thy wondrous works.    19:026:008 LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place             where thine honour dwelleth.    19:026:009 Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:    19:026:010 In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of             bribes.    19:026:011 But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and             be merciful unto me.    19:026:012 My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I             bless the LORD.    19:027:001 The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the             LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?    19:027:002 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me             to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.    19:027:003 Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not             fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be             confident.    19:027:004 One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after;             that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my             life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his             temple.    19:027:005 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion:             in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set             me up upon a rock.    19:027:006 And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round             about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices             of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.    19:027:007 Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon             me, and answer me.    19:027:008 When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee,             Thy face, LORD, will I seek.    19:027:009 Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in             anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake             me, O God of my salvation.    19:027:010 When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will             take me up.    19:027:011 Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because             of mine enemies.    19:027:012 Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false             witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out             cruelty.    19:027:013 I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of             the LORD in the land of the living.    19:027:014 Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen             thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.    19:028:001 Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me:             lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down             into the pit.    19:028:002 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when             I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.    19:028:003 Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of             iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief             is in their hearts.    19:028:004 Give them according to their deeds, and according to the             wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of             their hands; render to them their desert.    19:028:005 Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the             operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build             them up.    19:028:006 Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my             supplications.    19:028:007 The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in             him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth;             and with my song will I praise him.    19:028:008 The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of             his anointed.    19:028:009 Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also,             and lift them up for ever.    19:029:001 Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and             strength.    19:029:002 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the             LORD in the beauty of holiness.    19:029:003 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory             thundereth: the LORD is upon many waters.    19:029:004 The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is             full of majesty.    19:029:005 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD             breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.    19:029:006 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion             like a young unicorn.    19:029:007 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire.    19:029:008 The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh             the wilderness of Kadesh.    19:029:009 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and             discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one             speak of his glory.    19:029:010 The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King             for ever.    19:029:011 The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will             bless his people with peace.    19:030:001 I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and             hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.    19:030:002 O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.    19:030:003 O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast             kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.    19:030:004 Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the             remembrance of his holiness.    19:030:005 For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life:             weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.    19:030:006 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.    19:030:007 LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand             strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.    19:030:008 I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made             supplication.    19:030:009 What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit?             Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?    19:030:010 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.    19:030:011 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast             put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;    19:030:012 To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be             silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.    19:031:001 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed:             deliver me in thy righteousness.    19:031:002 Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my             strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.    19:031:003 For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's             sake lead me, and guide me.    19:031:004 Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for             thou art my strength.    19:031:005 Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O             LORD God of truth.    19:031:006 I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in             the LORD.    19:031:007 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast             considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;    19:031:008 And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast             set my feet in a large room.    19:031:009 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is             consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly.    19:031:010 For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my             strength faileth because of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8020"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 20: Proverbs (#5)"],[1,"ief: but a faithful             ambassador is health.    20:013:018 Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction:             but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured.    20:013:019 The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but it is             abomination to fools to depart from evil.    20:013:020 He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion             of fools shall be destroyed.    20:013:021 Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be             repayed.    20:013:022 A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children:             and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just.    20:013:023 Much food is in the tillage of the poor: but there is that is             destroyed for want of judgment.    20:013:024 He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him             chasteneth him betimes.    20:013:025 The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the             belly of the wicked shall want.    20:014:001 Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh             it down with her hands.    20:014:002 He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but he             that is perverse in his ways despiseth him.    20:014:003 In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but the lips of             the wise shall preserve them.    20:014:004 Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by             the strength of the ox.    20:014:005 A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will             utter lies.    20:014:006 A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: but knowledge is             easy unto him that understandeth.    20:014:007 Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest             not in him the lips of knowledge.    20:014:008 The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: but the             folly of fools is deceit.    20:014:009 Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous there is             favour.    20:014:010 The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not             intermeddle with his joy.    20:014:011 The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the             tabernacle of the upright shall flourish.    20:014:012 There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end             thereof are the ways of death.    20:014:013 Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that             mirth is heaviness.    20:014:014 The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and             a good man shall be satisfied from himself.    20:014:015 The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh             well to his going.    20:014:016 A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool             rageth, and is confident.    20:014:017 He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked             devices is hated.    20:014:018 The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with             knowledge.    20:014:019 The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of             the righteous.    20:014:020 The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich hath             many friends.    20:014:021 He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath             mercy on the poor, happy is he.    20:014:022 Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth shall be             to them that devise good.    20:014:023 In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips             tendeth only to penury.    20:014:024 The crown of the wise is their riches: but the foolishness of             fools is folly.    20:014:025 A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful witness             speaketh lies.    20:014:026 In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence: and his children             shall have a place of refuge.    20:014:027 The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, to depart from the             snares of death.    20:014:028 In the multitude of people is the king's honour: but in the             want of people is the destruction of the prince.    20:014:029 He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he             that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.    20:014:030 A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the             rottenness of the bones.    20:014:031 He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that             honoureth him hath mercy on the poor.    20:014:032 The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous             hath hope in his death.    20:014:033 Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding:             but that which is in the midst of fools is made known.    20:014:034 Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any             people.    20:014:035 The king's favour is toward a wise servant: but his wrath is             against him that causeth shame.    20:015:001 A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up             anger.    20:015:002 The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth             of fools poureth out foolishness.    20:015:003 The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil             and the good.    20:015:004 A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein             is a breach in the spirit.    20:015:005 A fool despiseth his father's instruction: but he that             regardeth reproof is prudent.    20:015:006 In the house of the righteous is much treasure: but in the             revenues of the wicked is trouble.    20:015:007 The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the             foolish doeth not so.    20:015:008 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but             the prayer of the upright is his delight.    20:015:009 The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD: but he             loveth him that followeth after righteousness.    20:015:010 Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: and he             that hateth reproof shall die.    20:015:011 Hell and destruction are before the LORD: how much more then             the hearts of the children of men?    20:015:012 A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he             go unto the wise.    20:015:013 A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of             the heart the spirit is broken.    20:015:014 The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge:             but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.    20:015:015 All the days of the afflicted are evil: but he that is of a             merry heart hath a continual feast.    20:015:016 Better is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure             and trouble therewith.    20:015:017 Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox             and hatred therewith.    20:015:018 A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but he that is slow to             anger appeaseth strife.    20:015:019 The way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns: but the             way of the righteous is made plain.    20:015:020 A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth             his mother.    20:015:021 Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom: but a man of             understanding walketh uprightly.    20:015:022 Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the             multitude of counsellors they are established.    20:015:023 A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word spoken             in due season, how good is it!    20:015:024 The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from             hell beneath.    20:015:025 The LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will             establish the border of the widow.    20:015:026 The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD: but             the words of the pure are pleasant words.    20:015:027 He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that             hateth gifts shall live.    20:015:028 The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth             of the wicked poureth out evil things.    20:015:029 The LORD is far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of             the righteous.    20:015:030 The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: and a good report             maketh the bones fat.    20:015:031 The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the             wise.    20:015:032 He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he             that heareth reproof getteth understanding.    20:015:033 The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before             honour is humility.    20:016:001 The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the             tongue, is from the LORD.    20:016:002 All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD             weigheth the spirits.    20:016:003 Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be             established.    20:016:004 The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the             wicked for the day of evil.    20:016:005 Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the             LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.    20:016:006 By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the             LORD men depart from evil.    20:016:007 When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies             to be at peace with him.    20:016:008 Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues             without right.    20:016:009 A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his             steps.    20:016:010 A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth             transgresseth not in judgment.    20:016:011 A just weight and balance are the LORD's: all the weights of             the bag are his work."]]]
