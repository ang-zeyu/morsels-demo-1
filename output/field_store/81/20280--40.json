It covers about two hundred and sixteen square miles and it guards  the trade routes to the Indian Ocean. It is very well fortified, and  any nation who tries to take it away from us is going to have a battle  on his hands, I can tell you. The city is built....\"    \"Okay, okay!\" Dave laughed and threw up his hands. \"I guess you've  read books. Spare me the rest of the details. I read a book once,  myself.\"    \"Right-o,\" Freddy Farmer said. \"Now it's my turn to ask questions. No,  not about Singapore. Here's a question that oddly enough not one man in  fifty could answer correctly.\"    \"Then shoot!\" Dawson said with a chuckle. \"Me, I'm that one man.\"    \"Here goes then,\" the English born R.A.F. ace said. \"Is there a type of  Nazi dive bomber called the Stuka?\"    Dave Dawson sat up a little straighter in the cockpit seat and gave his  friend a keen look.    \"What was that last one?\" he demanded. \"You wouldn't be kidding a pal,  would you, pal?\"    \"Certainly not!\" Freddy retorted. \"And _you_ stop crawling. Answer the  question. Is there a type of Nazi dive bomber called the Stuka?\"    \"I hope to kiss a Messerschmitt there is!\" Dave replied. \"And I wish  I had a dime for every time one of them has come piling down in my  direction. What is this, anyway? You didn't drop your brains over the  side, did you?\"    \"No, but you must have!\" the English youth snapped back. \"My poor  misinformed little friend, Stuka is a name for _all_ kinds of dive  bombers. Not just one type, as is commonly believed. It comes  from the German word _Sturzkampfflugzeug_. And that word means,  plunge-battle-fight-apparatus. And so, I would suggest that you go back  and make your solo flight all over again.\"    \"My, my!\" Dave breathed and gave a shake of his head in mock  admiration. \"After all this time and I didn't once dream that you had  that big word inside of you. I must really get to know you one of these  days. You'd be quite something to have along at one of those radio quiz  programs. I just bet you got sore fingers from tearing off box tops,  and sending into the corner drugstore. But hold it! You don't have  advertising on your English radio programs, do you?\"    \"No, we don't,\" Freddy said with a frown. \"And what do you mean, tear  off a box top?\"    \"It's a radio stunt used back home to build up sales,\" Dave explained.  \"A manufacturer may be offering a booklet, or some kind of prize free,  see? You can get it for nothing. All you do is buy say five or ten  boxes of his product, tear off the tops and send them in with your  name and address. And they send you whatever it is they are offering  special, see? The catch is to get you to buy more of his product so's  you can tear off the box tops. I once tried to get a book of old  American songs that was being offered, but the folks wouldn't let me.  It would have cost my Dad close to six thousand dollars to get the top  of the boxes their product came in.\"    Freddy Farmer's eyes popped, and his mouth fell open.    \"Six thousand dollars?\" he gasped. \"Good Lord! Why that much money?\"    \"The company sold pianos!\" Dave said and ducked as Freddy flushed and  swung his opened hand.    \"When will I learn not to believe a thing that falls out of your big  mouth!\" Freddy groaned. Then after a moment's silence, he said, \"This  is a bit of foolishness, isn't it? Why don't we talk about what's  really on our minds?\"    \"Okay,\" Dave said with a shrug. \"Let's talk about it, then. Go ahead.\"    \"Well, right at this moment I'm not feeling too kindly toward Air Vice  Marshal Bostworth,\" Freddy said. \"It's over three hours since we were  to meet him at Singapore R.A.F. Base. I should think he would have sent  planes out hunting for us by now. What do you think?\"    Dave didn't answer for a moment. He slowly twisted around in the seat  and took a good look at the sky and at the four horizons. He saw  nothing in the air, and only far to the south did he see the thin dark  line low down that marked land of some sort. It could be any one of  the several islands that dotted the Strait.    \"The same as you think, I guess, Freddy,\" he said presently, turning to  his friend. \"I frankly thought that we might have to wait for a spell  or so. But not so long as this. If help's coming I hope it comes soon.  That sun is getting closer and closer to the western horizon. Maybe  when we didn't show up Air Vice Marshal Bostworth decided that Captain  Standers wouldn't let us take a plane. And speaking of Standers,  he's sure going to tear out his hair when he doesn't get this Fairey  Swordfish back. He struck me as a lad who doesn't like folks to keep  things they borrow.\"    \"Oh, bother to Standers!\" Freddy grunted and shook a hand impatiently.  \"What do we do when darkness falls, Dave?\"    \"Let it fall,\" the Yank replied. \"What else?\"    \"Lord, what a help you are to a chap!\" the English youth groaned. \"We  can't stay here forever. In case you don't realize it, my funny man, a  seam has split in the pontoon, and we've been taking in water for an  hour now. We're going to go under eventually.\"    \"Yes, I've known we were taking in water, Freddy,\" Dave said quietly.  \"It isn't our combined weight that's making this job list a few  degrees. But.... Well, Freddy, if it happens, I guess we've just got  to take it, that's all. To tell the truth I've been beating my brains  all over the place trying to figure some way to get in touch with the  nearest shore. But the only way I can figure, wouldn't help us at all.  Not unless help came out quicker than greased lightning.\"    \"Well, as you've often said, anything's worth a try!\" Freddy exclaimed.  \"What's your idea?\"    \"A bum one, and definitely out,\" Dave replied with a vigorous shake of  his head. \"The only way we could attract attention on shore is to set  the plane on fire. If we did, it would only be a case of who got us  first, the flames, or the sharks. Nope! I shouldn't even have brought  it up.\"    \"I'll say you shouldn't have!\" Freddy growled and glared at the radio  panel. \"Look at that thing, there! Perfectly good when we're in the air  but not worth a hoot down here on the water. Runs off the engine. Why  don't they fit the things with hand driven generators so a chap can  still work the radio when he's forced down?\"    \"They do on the big ships,\" Dave said. \"But every extra pound of weight  counts on this type of plane. Besides, Air Ministry expects you to be a  good pilot and not get forced down.\"    \"Blast Air Ministry!\" Freddy snarled. \"I wish some of those precious  Brass Hats were here with us now. Perhaps they'd get a better idea of  what a flying johnnie has to go through. It's all wrong, I tell you,  Dave. The blokes at Air Ministry think that....\"    \"Tell me tomorrow, pal!\" Dave suddenly broke in excitedly and flung  up a hand toward the southwest. \"Take a good look up there. Is that a  plane, or have they got birds that big in this neck of the world?\"    Freddy Farmer snapped his opened mouth shut and swiveled eagerly around  in his seat, and peered intently in the direction of Dave's pointed  finger. After a long minute he let clamped air out of his lungs in a  great sigh of unbelievable relief.    \"It's not a bird, Dave, it's a plane!\" he cried. \"A flying boat. It's  one of our American built patrol Catalinas. Can't you recognize it?  Lord knows you had enough experience on one!\"[1]    [Footnote 1: _Dave Dawson On Convoy Patrol._]    \"Old Freddy Farmer, the lad with telescopic eyes!\" Dave cried as the  prospect of immediate rescue drove all the little gnawing fears away.  \"They should get you to censor mail. You wouldn't have to take the  letters out of the envelopes. But.... I hope you're right, sweetheart.  I can see something headed this way, but it's too doggone small for a  good look.\"    \"Don't fret, it's a Catalina!\" the English youth cried out happily.  \"I'm sure of it now. See? They've sighted us. They're coming down.\"    \"They could be going out for lunch, for all I could tell,\" Dave grunted  as he strained his eyes at the faint blackish blur high up in the China  Sea sky. \"But I'll take your word for it. Tell me, how many aboard? And  has the pilot got a mustache or not?\"    \"He has not, but he's got a gold tooth!\" Freddy snapped at him. \"Stop  pulling my leg. You must be able to see it clearly, now. Just because  you're being rescued from a possible watery grave, my good man, don't  be so blasted funny.\"    \"Funny?\" Dave echoed with a snort. \"Look at me! I could weep with joy.  Now that things look okay for us, I can admit that I was plenty worried  awhile back. And no kidding, either!\"    \"Hardly the word to express how I felt,\" Freddy murmured and took a  deep breath. \"But perhaps we were really born under a lucky star, Dave.  We always manage to skin through, somehow.\"    \"Skin through, he says?\" Dave echoed. \"You mean, I walk through and  pull you through after me. But let it go. Boy! What I'm going to tell  Air Vice Marshal Bostworth when I see him!\"    \"Well, don't do it unless I'm outside the building,\" Freddy said.    \"Outside the building?\" Dave echoed and gave him a puzzled look. \"Why?\"    \"To catch you when you come out,\" the English youth replied with a  grin. \"Air Vice Marshal Bostworth is six foot, three, as you know. And  he is a holy terror about insubordination, as you _also_ know.\"    \"Yeah, that's true,\" Dave murmured, and watched the Catalina slide  down lower and lower. \"Well, at least I'll be thinking plenty when,  and if, I meet him. Five hours on this sea of liquid fire is enough to  make anybody sore. Okay, Freddy, give the pilot a wave. He's waving at  us. Man, oh man! Doesn't it make you feel good to see that old R.A.F.  insignia on the wings and hull?\"    Freddy simply nodded. For the moment he was unable to speak. He was  too choked up with emotion to dare trust his tongue. So he simply  nodded, waved his hand and smiled all over the place as the Catalina  sank "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5067"],[0,"The Rainbow Trail (#5)"],[1,"scenes in his mind. The valley was  half a mile wide, perhaps several miles long, and it extended in a curve  between the cedar-sloped mesa and a looming wall of red stone. There was  not a bird or a beast in sight. He found a well-defined trail, but it  had not been recently used. He passed a low structure made of peeled  logs and mud, with a dark opening like a door. It did not take him many  minutes to learn that the valley was longer than he had calculated.  He walked swiftly and steadily, in spite of the fact that the pack had  become burdensome. What lay beyond the jutting corner of the mesa had  increasing fascination for him and acted as a spur. At last he turned  the corner, only to be disappointed at sight of another cedar slope.  He had a glimpse of a single black shaft of rock rising far in the  distance, and it disappeared as his striding forward made the crest of  the slope rise toward the sky.    Again his view became restricted, and he lost the sense of a slow and  gradual uplift of rock and an increase in the scale of proportion.  Half-way up this ascent he was compelled to rest; and again the sun was  slanting low when he entered the cedar forest. Soon he was descending,  and he suddenly came into the open to face a scene that made his heart  beat thick and fast.    He saw lofty crags and cathedral spires, and a wonderful canyon winding  between huge beetling red walls. He heard the murmur of flowing water.  The trail led down to the canyon floor, which appeared to be level and  green and cut by deep washes in red earth. Could this canyon be the  mouth of Deception Pass? It bore no resemblance to any place Shefford  had heard described, yet somehow he felt rather than saw that it was the  portal to the wild vastness he had traveled so far to enter.    Not till he had descended the trail and had dropped his pack did he  realize how weary and footsore he was. Then he rested. But his eyes  roved to and fro, and his mind was active. What a wild and lonesome  spot! The low murmur of shallow water came up to him from a deep, narrow  cleft. Shadows were already making the canyon seem full of blue haze. He  saw a bare slope of stone out of which cedar-trees were growing. And as  he looked about him he became aware of a singular and very perceptible  change in the lights and shades. The sun was setting; the crags were  gold-tipped; the shadows crept upward; the sky seemed to darken swiftly;  then the gold changed to red, slowly dulled, and the grays and purples  stood out. Shefford was entranced with the beautiful changing effects,  and watched till the walls turned black and the sky grew steely and a  faint star peeped out. Then he set about the necessary camp tasks.    Dead cedars right at hand assured him a comfortable night with steady  fire; and when he had satisfied his hunger he arranged an easy seat  before the blazing logs, and gave his mind over to thought of his weird,  lonely environment.    The murmur of running water mingled in harmonious accompaniment with the  moan of the wind in the cedars--wild, sweet sounds that were balm to his  wounded spirit! They seemed a part of the silence, rather than a break  in it or a hindrance to the feeling of it. But suddenly that silence  did break to the rattle of a rock. Shefford listened, thinking some wild  animal was prowling around. He felt no alarm. Presently he heard the  sound again, and again. Then he recognized the crack of unshod hoofs  upon rock. A horse was coming down the trail. Shefford rather resented  the interruption, though he still had no alarm. He believed he was  perfectly safe. As a matter of fact, he had never in his life been  anything but safe and padded around with wool, hence, never having  experienced peril, he did not know what fear was.    Presently he saw a horse and rider come into dark prominence on the  ridge just above his camp. They were silhouetted against the starry  sky. The horseman stopped and he and his steed made a magnificent black  statue, somehow wild and strange, in Shefford's sight. Then he came on,  vanished in the darkness under the ridge, presently to emerge into the  circle of camp-fire light.    He rode to within twenty feet of Shefford and the fire. The horse was  dark, wild-looking, and seemed ready to run. The rider appeared to be an  Indian, and yet had something about him suggesting the cowboy. At once  Shefford remembered what Presbrey had said about half-breeds. A little  shock, inexplicable to Shefford, rippled over him.    He greeted his visitor, but received no answer. Shefford saw a dark,  squat figure bending forward in the saddle. The man was tense. All about  him was dark except the glint of a rifle across the saddle. The face  under the sombrero was only a shadow. Shefford kicked the fire-logs and  a brighter blaze lightened the scene. Then he saw this stranger a little  more clearly, and made out an unusually large head, broad dark face, a  sinister tight-shut mouth, and gleaming black eyes.    Those eyes were unmistakably hostile. They roved searchingly over  Shefford's pack and then over his person. Shefford felt for the gun that  Presbrey had given him. But it was gone. He had left it back where he  had lost his horse, and had not thought of it since. Then a strange,  slow-coming cold agitation possessed Shefford. Something gripped his  throat.    Suddenly Shefford was stricken at a menacing movement on the part of  the horseman. He had drawn a gun. Shefford saw it shine darkly in the  firelight. The Indian meant to murder him. Shefford saw the grim, dark  face in a kind of horrible amaze. He felt the meaning of that drawn  weapon as he had never felt anything before in his life. And he  collapsed back into his seat with an icy, sickening terror. In a second  he was dripping wet with cold sweat. Lightning-swift thoughts flashed  through his mind. It had been one of his platitudes that he was not  afraid of death. Yet here he was a shaking, helpless coward. What had  he learned about either life or death? Would this dark savage plunge  him into the unknown? It was then that Shefford realized his hollow  philosophy and the bitter-sweetness of life. He had a brain and a soul,  and between them he might have worked out his salvation. But what were  they to this ruthless night-wanderer, this raw and horrible wildness of  the desert?    Incapable of voluntary movement, with tongue cleaving to the roof of his  mouth, Shefford watched the horseman and the half-poised gun. It was not  yet leveled. Then it dawned upon Shefford that the stranger's head was  turned a little, his ear to the wind. He was listening. His horse was  listening. Suddenly he straightened up, wheeled his horse, and trotted  away into the darkness. But he did not climb the ridge down which he had  come.    Shefford heard the click of hoofs upon the stony trail. Other horses and  riders were descending into the canyon. They had been the cause of his  deliverance, and in the relaxation of feeling he almost fainted. Then he  sat there, slowly recovering, slowly ceasing to tremble, divining that  this situation was somehow to change his attitude toward life.    Three horses, two with riders, moved in dark shapes across the skyline  above the ridge, disappeared as had Shefford's first visitor, and then  rode into the light. Shefford saw two Indians--a man and a woman; then  with surprise recognized the latter to be the Indian girl he had met at  Red Lake. He was still more surprised to recognize in the third horse  the one he had lost at the last camp. Shefford rose, a little shaky on  his legs, to thank these Indians for a double service. The man slipped  from his saddle and his moccasined feet thudded lightly. He was tall,  lithe, erect, a singularly graceful figure, and as he advanced Shefford  saw a dark face and sharp, dark eyes. The Indian was bareheaded, with  his hair bound in a band. He resembled the girl, but appeared to have a  finer face.    \"How do?\" he said, in a voice low and distinct. He extended his hand,  and Shefford felt a grip of steel. He returned the greeting. Then  the Indian gave Shefford the bridle of the horse, and made signs that  appeared to indicate the horse had broken his hobbles and strayed.  Shefford thanked him. Thereupon the Indian unsaddled and led the horses  away, evidently to water them. The girl remained behind. Shefford  addressed her, but she was shy and did not respond. He then set about  cooking a meal for his visitors, and was busily engaged at this when the  Indian returned without the horses. Presently Shefford resumed his seat  by the fire and watched the two eat what he had prepared. They certainly  were hungry and soon had the pans and cups empty. Then the girl drew  back a little into the shadow, while the man sat with his legs crossed  and his feet tucked under him.    His dark face was smooth, yet it seemed to have lines under the surface.  Shefford was impressed. He had never seen an Indian who interested him  as this one. Looked at superficially, he appeared young, wild, silent,  locked in his primeval apathy, just a healthy savage; but looked at more  attentively, he appeared matured, even old, a strange, sad, brooding  figure, with a burden on his shoulders. Shefford found himself growing  curious.    \"What place?\" asked Shefford, waving his hand toward the dark opening  between the black cliffs.    \"Sagi,\" replied the Indian.    That did not mean anything to Shefford, and he asked if the Sagi was the  pass, but the Indian shook his head.    \"Wife?\" asked Shefford, pointing to the girl.    The Indian shook his head again. \"_Bi-la_,\" he said.    \"What you mean?\" asked Shefford. \"What _bi-la_?\"    \"Sister,\" replied the Indian. He spoke the word reluctantly, as if the  white man's language did not please him, but the clearness and correct  pronunciation surprised Shefford.    \"What name--what call her?\" he went on.    \"Glen Naspa.\"    \"What your name?\" inquired"]]]
