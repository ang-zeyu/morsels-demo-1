If Fog were non-existent, all lines would appear equally and  indistinguishably clear; and this is actually the case in those unhappy  countries in which the atmosphere is perfectly dry and transparent.  But wherever there is a rich supply of Fog, objects that are at a  distance, say of three feet, are appreciably dimmer than those at the  distance of two feet eleven inches; and the result is that by careful  and constant experimental observation of comparative dimness and  clearness, we are enabled to infer with great exactness the  configuration of the object observed.    An instance will do more than a volume of generalities to make my  meaning clear.    Suppose I see two individuals approaching whose rank I wish to  ascertain.  They are, we will suppose, a Merchant and a Physician, or  in other words, an Equilateral Triangle and a Pentagon; how am I to  distinguish them?    It will be obvious, to every child in Spaceland who has touched the  threshold of Geometrical Studies, that, if I can bring my eye so that  its glance may bisect an angle (A) of the approaching stranger, my view  will lie as it were evenly between the two sides that are next to me  (viz. CA and AB), so that I shall contemplate the two impartially, and  both will appear of the same size.    Now in the case of (1) the Merchant, what shall I see?  I shall see a  straight line DAE, in which the middle point (A) will be very bright  because it is nearest to me; but on either side the line will shade  away RAPIDLY TO DIMNESS, because the sides AC and AB RECEDE RAPIDLY  INTO THE FOG and what appear to me as the Merchant's extremities, viz.  D and E, will be VERY DIM INDEED.    On the other hand in the case of (2) the Physician, though I shall here  also see a line (D'A'E') with a bright centre (A'), yet it will shade  away LESS RAPIDLY to dimness, because the sides (A'C', A'B') RECEDE  LESS RAPIDLY INTO THE FOG:  and what appear to me the Physician's  extremities, viz. D' and E', will not be NOT SO DIM as the extremities  of the Merchant.    The Reader will probably understand from these two instances how--after  a very long training supplemented by constant experience--it is  possible for the well-educated classes among us to discriminate with  fair accuracy between the middle and lowest orders, by the sense of  sight.  If my Spaceland Patrons have grasped this general conception,  so far as to conceive the possibility of it and not to reject my  account as altogether incredible--I shall have attained all I can  reasonably expect.  Were I to attempt further details I should only  perplex.  Yet for the sake of the young and inexperienced, who may  perchance infer--from the two simple instances I have given above, of  the manner in which I should recognize my Father and my Sons--that  Recognition by sight is an easy affair, it may be needful to point out  that in actual life most of the problems of Sight Recognition are far  more subtle and complex.    If for example, when my Father, the Triangle, approaches me, he happens  to present his side to me instead of his angle, then, until I have  asked him to rotate, or until I have edged my eye around him, I am for  the moment doubtful whether he may not be a Straight Line, or, in other  words, a Woman.  Again, when I am in the company of one of my two  hexagonal Grandsons, contemplating one of his sides (AB) full front, it  will be evident from the accompanying diagram that I shall see one  whole line (AB) in comparative brightness (shading off hardly at all at  the ends) and two smaller lines (CA and BD) dim throughout and shading  away into greater dimness towards the extremities C and D.    But I must not give way to the temptation of enlarging on these topics.  The meanest mathematician in Spaceland will readily believe me when I  assert that the problems of life, which present themselves to the  well-educated--when they are themselves in motion, rotating, advancing  or retreating, and at the same time attempting to discriminate by the  sense of sight between a number of Polygons of high rank moving in  different directions, as for example in a ball-room or  conversazione--must be of a nature to task the angularity of the most  intellectual, and amply justify the rich endowments of the Learned  Professors of Geometry, both Static and Kinetic, in the illustrious  University of Wentbridge, where the Science and Art of Sight  Recognition are regularly taught to large classes of the ELITE of the  States.    It is only a few of the scions of our noblest and wealthiest houses,  who are able to give the time and money necessary for the thorough  prosecution of this noble and valuable Art.  Even to me, a  Mathematician of no mean standing, and the Grandfather of two most  hopeful and perfectly regular Hexagons, to find myself in the midst of  a crowd of rotating Polygons of the higher classes, is occasionally  very perplexing.  And of course to a common Tradesman, or Serf, such a  sight is almost as unintelligible as it would be to you, my Reader,  were you suddenly transported to my country.    In such a crowd you could see on all sides of you nothing but a Line,  apparently straight, but of which the parts would vary irregularly and  perpetually in brightness or dimness.  Even if you had completed your  third year in the Pentagonal and Hexagonal classes in the University,  and were perfect in the theory of the subject, you would still find  there was need of many years of experience, before you could move in a  fashionable crowd without jostling against your betters, whom it is  against etiquette to ask to \"feel,\" and who, by their superior culture  and breeding, know all about your movements, while you know very little  or nothing about theirs.  In a word, to comport oneself with perfect  propriety in Polygonal society, one ought to be a Polygon oneself.  Such at least is the painful teaching of my experience.    It is astonishing how much the Art--or I may almost call it  instinct--of Sight Recognition is developed by the habitual practice of  it and by the avoidance of the custom of \"Feeling.\"  Just as, with you,  the deaf and dumb, if once allowed to gesticulate and to use the  hand-alphabet, will never acquire the more difficult but far more  valuable art of lip-speech and lip-reading, so it is with us as regards  \"Seeing\" and \"Feeling.\" None who in early life resort to \"Feeling\" will  ever learn \"Seeing\" in perfection.    For this reason, among our Higher Classes, \"Feeling\" is discouraged or  absolutely forbidden.  From the cradle their children, instead of going  to the Public Elementary schools (where the art of Feeling is taught,)  are sent to higher Seminaries of an exclusive character; and at our  illustrious University, to \"feel\" is regarded as a most serious fault,  involving Rustication for the first offence, and Expulsion for the  second.    But among the lower classes the art of Sight Recognition is regarded as  an unattainable luxury.  A common Tradesman cannot afford to let his  son spend a third of his life in abstract studies.  The children of the  poor are therefore allowed to \"feel\" from their earliest years, and  they gain thereby a precocity and an early vivacity which contrast at  first most favourably with the inert, undeveloped, and listless  behaviour of the half-instructed youths of the Polygonal class; but  when the latter have at last completed their University course, and are  prepared to put their theory into practice, the change that comes over  them may almost be described as a new birth, and in every art, science,  and social pursuit they rapidly overtake and distance their Triangular  competitors.    Only a few of the Polygonal Class fail to pass the Final Test or  Leaving Examination at the University.  The condition of the  unsuccessful minority is truly pitiable.  Rejected from the higher  class, they are also despised by the lower.  They have neither the  matured and systematically trained powers of the Polygonal Bachelors  and Masters of Arts, nor yet the native precocity and mercurial  versatility of the youthful Tradesman.  The professions, the public  services, are closed against them, and though in most States they are  not actually debarred from marriage, yet they have the greatest  difficulty in forming suitable alliances, as experience shews that the  offspring of such unfortunate and ill-endowed parents is generally  itself unfortunate, if not positively Irregular.    It is from these specimens of the refuse of our Nobility that the great  Tumults and Seditions of past ages have generally derived their  leaders; and so great is the mischief thence arising that an increasing  minority of our more progressive Statesmen are of opinion that true  mercy would dictate their entire suppression, by enacting that all who  fail to pass the Final Examination of the University should be either  imprisoned for life, or extinguished by a painless death.    But I find myself digressing into the subject of Irregularities, a  matter of such vital interest that it demands a separate section.            SECTION 7  Concerning Irregular Figures      Throughout the previous pages I have been assuming--what perhaps should  have been laid down at the beginning as a distinct and fundamental  proposition--that every human being in Flatland is a Regular Figure,  that is to say of regular construction.  By this I mean that a Woman  must not only be a line, but a straight line; that an Artisan or  Soldier must have two of his sides equal; that Tradesmen must have  three sides equal; Lawyers (of which class I am a humble member), four  sides equal, and, generally, that in every Polygon, all the sides must  be equal.    The sizes of the sides would of course depend upon the age of the  individual.  A Female at birth would be about an inch long, while a  tall adult Woman might extend to a foot.  As to the Males of every  class, it may be "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9791"],[0,"Harrigan (#5)"],[1,"known.\"    The door opened and the bos'n entered with Harrigan. He fixed his eyes  upon the captain without a glance for Kate Malone.    \"Harrigan,\" said McTee, \"I've been telling Miss Malone that you can be  released from your trouble by saying half a dozen words to me. And you  know that you can. You will be treated better than anyone in the crew  if you will put your hand in mine and say: 'Captain McTee, I give you  my word of honor as a man to do my best to obey orders during the rest  of this trip and to hold no malice against you for anything that has  happened to me so far.'    \"For you see,\" he explained to the girl, \"he probably thinks himself  aggrieved by my discipline. Will you say it, Harrigan?\"    Instead of answering, the cold eye of Harrigan turned on Kate.    \"I told you not to speak to the captain,\" he said.    \"Ah,\" said McTee, \"you were clever enough for that?\"    \"Do you say nothing, Harrigan?\" she said incredulously. \"Do you really  refuse to speak those words to the captain after he has been generous  enough to give you a last chance to make a man of yourself?\"    Harrigan turned pale as he glanced at the captain. Her scorn and  contempt gave a little metallic ring to her voice.    \"You need not be afraid. Captain McTee hasn't told me anything about  your record.\"    Harrigan smiled, but in such a manner that she stepped back. \"Easy,\"  said McTee, \"you don't need to fear him in here. He knows that I'm his  master.\"    \"I'm glad you didn't tell me his record,\" she answered.    \"I can read it in his eyes.\"    \"Lady,\" said Harrigan, and his head tilted back till the cords stood  strongly out at the base of his throat, \"I'm afther askin' your pardon  for thinkin' ye had ever a dr-rop av hot Irish blood in ye.\"    \"Take him below, bos'n,\" broke in McTee, \"and put him in on the night  shift in the fireroom.\"    No hours of Harrigan's life were bitterer than that night shift. The  bandages saved his hands from much of the torture of the shovel handle,  but there was deep night in his heart. Early in the morning one of the  firemen ran to the chief engineer's room and forced open the door.    \"The red-headed man, sir,\" he stammered breathlessly.    The chief engineer awoke with a snarl. He had drunk much good Scotch  whisky that evening, and the smoke of it was still dry in his throat  and cloudy in his brain.    \"And what the hell is wrong with the red-headed man now?\" he roared.  \"Ain't he doin' two men's work still?\"    \"Two? He's doin' ten men's work with his hands rolled in cloth and the  blood soakin' through, an' he sings like a devil while he works. He's  gone crazy, sir.\"    \"Naw, he ain't,\" growled the chief; \"that'll come later. Black McTee is  breakin' him an' he'll be broke before he goes off his nut. Now get to  hell out of here. I ain't slept a wink for ten days.\"    The fireman went back to his work muttering, and Harrigan sang the rest  of the night.          CHAPTER 6      In the morning there was the usual task of scrubbing down the bridge.  The suds soaked through the bandages at once and burned his hands like  fire. He tore away the cloths and kept at his task, for he knew that if  he refused to continue, he became by that act of disobedience a  mutineer.    The fourth day was a long nightmare, but at the end of it Harrigan was  still at his post. That night the pain kept him awake. For forty-eight  hours he had not closed his eyes. The next morning, as he prepared his  bucket of suds and looked down at his blood-caked hands, the thought of  surrender rose strongly for the first time. Two things fought against  it: his fierce pride and a certain awe which he had noted as it grew  from day to day in the eyes of the rest of the crew. They were  following the silent battle between the great Irishman and the captain  with a profound, an almost uncanny interest.    As he scrubbed the bridge that morning, McTee, as always, stood staring  out across the bows, impassive, self-contained as a general overlooking  a field of battle. And the temptation to surrender swelled up in the  throat of Harrigan like the desire for speech in a child. He kept his  teeth hard together and prayed for endurance. Only five days, and it  might be weeks before they made a port. Even then the captain might put  him in irons rather than risk his escape.    \"Harrigan,\" said McTee suddenly. \"Don't keep it up. You're bound to  break. Speak those words now that I told you to say and you're a free  man.\"    Harrigan looked up and the words formed at the base of his tongue.  Harrigan looked down and saw his crimson hands. The words fell back  like dust on his heart.    \"Take you for my master an' swear to forget what you've done?\" he said,  and his voice was hardly more than a whisper. \"McTee, if I promised you  that I'd perjure blacker 'n hell an' kill you someday when your back  was turned. As it is, I'll kill you while we're standin' face to face.\"    McTee laughed, low, deep, and his eyes were half closed as if he heard  pleasant music. Harrigan grinned up at him.    \"I'll kill you with my bare hands. There's no gun or knife could do  justice to what's inside of me.\"    His head tilted back and his whisper went thick like that of a  drunkard: \"Ah-h, McTee, look at the hands, look at the hands! They're  red now for a sign av the blood av ye that'll someday be on 'em!\"    And he picked up his bucket and brush and went down the deck. The laugh  of McTee followed him.    Having framed the wish in words, it was never absent from Harrigan's  mind now. It made that day easier for him. He stopped singing. He  needed all his brain energy to think of how he should kill McTee.    It was this hungry desire which sustained him during the days which  followed. The rest of the crew began to sense the mighty emotion which  consumed Harrigan. When they saw both him and McTee on the deck, their  eyes traveled from one to the other making comparisons, for they felt  that these men would one day meet hand to hand. They could not stay  apart any more than the iron can keep from the magnet.    Finally Harrigan knew that they were nearing the end of their long  journey. The port was only a few days distant, for they were far in the  south seas and they began to pass islands, and sometimes caught sight  of green patches of water. Those were the coral reefs, the terror of  all navigators, for they grow and change from year to year. To a  light-draught ship like the _Mary Rogers_ these seas were comparatively  safe, but not altogether. Even small sailing craft had come to grief in  those regions.    Yet the islands, the reefs, the keen sun, the soft winds, the singing  of the sailors, all these things came dimly to Harrigan, for he knew  that his powers of resistance were almost worn away. His face was a  mask of tragedy, and his body was as lean as a starved wolf in winter.  His will to live, his will to hate, alone remained.    Each morning it was harder for him to leave the bridge without speaking  those words to the captain. He rehearsed them every day and vowed they  would never pass his lips. And every day he knew that his vow was  weaker. When he was about to give in, he chanced to see McTee and Kate  Malone laughing together on the promenade.    It was McTee who saw Harrigan first and pointed him out to Kate. She  leaned against the rail and peered down at him, shuddering at the sight  of his drawn face and shadowed eyes. Then she turned with a little  shrug of repulsion.    McTee must have made some humorous comment, for she turned to glance  down at Harrigan again and this time she laughed. Blind rage made the  blood of the Irishman hot. That gave him his last strength, but even  this ran out. Finally he knew that the next day was his last, and when  that day came, he counted the hours. They passed heavy-footed, as time  goes for one condemned to die. And then he sat cross-legged on his bunk  and waited.    The giant Negro came, bringing word that the bos'n wanted him to scrub  down the bridge. He remained with his head bowed, unhearing. The bos'n  himself came, cursing. He called to Harrigan, and getting no answer  shook him by the shoulder. He put his hand under Harrigan's chin and  raised the listless head. It rolled heavily back and the dull eyes  stared up at him.    \"God!\" said the bos'n, and started back.    The head remained where he had placed it, the eyes staring straight up  at the ceiling.    \"God!\" whispered the bos'n again, and ran from the forecastle.    In time--it seemed hours--Harrigan heard many voices approaching.  McTee's bass was not among them, but he knew that McTee was coming, and  Harrigan wondered whether he would have the strength to refuse to obey  and accept the fate of the mutineer; or whether terror would overwhelm  him and he would drop to his knees and beg for mercy. He had once seen  a sight as horrible. The voices swept closer. McTee was bringing all  the available crew to watch the surrender, and Harrigan prayed with all  his soul to a nameless deity for strength.    Something stopped in the Irishman. It was not his heart, but something  as vital. The very movement of the earth seemed to be suspended when  the great form blocked the door to the forecastle and the ringing voice  called: \"Harrigan!\"    At the summons Harrigan's jaw fell loosely like that of an exhausted  distance-runner, and long-suppressed words grew achingly large in his  throat.    \"I've had enough!\" he groaned.    \"Harrigan!\" thundered the captain, and Harrigan knew that his attempted  speech had been merely a silent wish.    \"God help me!\" he whispered hoarsely, and in response to that brief  prayer a warm pulse of strength flooded through him. He sprang to his  feet.    \"I refuse to work!\" he cried, and this time the sound echoed back  against his ears.    There was a long pause.    \"Mutiny!\" said McTee at last, and his voice was harsh with the  knowledge of his failure. \"Bring him outside in the open. I'll deal"]]]
