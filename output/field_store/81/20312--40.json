There now, you're all right.\"    \"Oh!\" said Phronsie, sitting quite stiffly, glad if she could not be  comfortable, she could be a princess.    \"'Gentle ladies and brave sirs,'\" began Jasper in a loud, impressive  tone, from the temporary stage, the large rug in front of the crackling  hearth fire.    Clare burst into a laugh. \"See here now,\" cried Jasper, brandishing his  text at him, \"if you embarrass me like that, you may leave, you old  dragon!\"    \"You ought to see your face,\" cried Clare. \"Jap, you are anything but a  hit.\"    \"You'll be yet,\" declared Jasper with a pretended growl, and another  flourish of the manuscript.    \"Go on, do,\" implored Polly, \"I think it is lovely. Clare, you really  ought to be ashamed,\" and she shook her brown head severely at him.    \"If I don't quench such melodrama in the outset,\" said Clare, \"he'll  ruin us all. Fair ladies and brave sirs,\" mimicking to perfection  Jasper's tones.    \"Thank you for a hint,\" cried Jasper, pulling out his pencil. \"I didn't  say 'fair'; that's better than 'gentle.' I wish critics would always be  so useful as to give one good idea. Heigho! here goes again:              \"'Fair ladies and brave sirs,             The player's art is to amuse,             Instruct, or to confuse             By too much good advice,             But poorly given:             That no one follows, because, forsooth,             'Tis thrown at him, neck and heels.             The drama, pure and simple, is forgot             In tugging in the moral'\"?    \"I thought you were going to alter 'tugging in' to something more  elegant,\" said Polly.    \"Lugging in,\" suggested Clare, with another laugh.    \"Morals are always tugged in by the head and shoulders,\" said Jasper.  \"Why not say so?\"    \"We should have pretty much the whole anatomy of the human form divine,  if you had your way,\" cried Clare. \"Listen!    \"'Because, forsooth, 'tis thrown at him, neck and heels' and 'Tugging  in the moral, head and shoulders.' Now just add 'by the pricking of my  thumbs,' etc., and you have them all.\"    Jasper joined as well as Polly and Ben in the laugh at the prologue's  expense, but Phronsie sat erect winking hard, her royal hands folded  quite still in her lap.    \"You're bound for a newspaper office, my boy,\" said Jasper at length.  \"How you will cut into the coming poet, and maul the fledgling of the  prose writer! Well, I stand corrected.              \"'The drama pure and simple,             Is forgot, in straining at the moral.'\"            \"Is that any better?\" (To the audience.)    \"Yes, I think it is,\" said Polly, \"but I do believe it's time to talk  more elegantly, Jasper. It is due to the people in the private boxes,  you know.\"    \"Oh! the boxes are to have things all right before the play is over;  never you fear, Polly,\" said Jasper.              \"'A poor presentment,             You will say we give;             But cry you mercy, Sirs, and'\"?    \"I don't like 'cry you mercy,'\" announced Ben slowly, \"because it  doesn't seem to mean anything.\"    \"Oh! don't cut that out,\" exclaimed Polly, clasping her hands and  rushing up to Ben. \"That's my pet phrase; you mustn't touch that,  Bensie.\"    \"But it doesn't mean anything,\" reiterated Ben in a puzzled way.    \"Who cares?\" cried Jasper defiantly. \"A great many expressions that  haven't the least significance are put in a thing of this sort.  Padding, you know, my dear sir.\"    \"Oh!\" said Ben literally, \"I didn't know as you needed padding. All  right, if it is necessary.\" \"It's antique, and perfectly lovely, and  just like Shakespeare,\" cried Polly, viewing Ben in alarm.    \"Oh! let the Bard of Avon have one say in this production,\" cried  Clare. \"Go on, do, with your 'cry you mercy.' What's next, Jap?\"    \"Are you willing, Ben?\" asked Jasper, with a glance at Polly.    \"Ye--es,\" said Ben, also gazing at the rosy face and anxious eyes, \"it  can go as padding, I suppose.\"    \"Oh! I am so glad,\" exclaimed Polly in glee, and dancing around the  room. \"And you won't be sorry, I know, Bensie; the audience will  applaud that very thing I'm almost sure,\" which made Jasper sternly  resolve something on the spot.    \"Well, I shall never be through at this rate,\" he said, whirling over  the manuscript to find his place. \"Oh! here I am:              \"'But cry you mercy, Sirs and ladies fair,             We aim but to be dragons,             Not mortals posing for effect.             We have a princess, to be sure'\"?    \"I should think we have,\" interrupted Clare with a glance over at the  sofa. \"Goodness me, she's fast asleep!\"    \"Poor little thing, she is tired to death,\" cried Polly remorsefully,  while they all rushed over to the heap of lace and spangles, blissfully  oblivious of \"prologues.\"    \"Do let her sleep through this piece of stupidity,\" said Jasper,  bundling up another satin skirt that Mrs. Whitney had loaned for Polly  to make a choice from. \"There,\" putting it under the yellow head,  \"we'll call her when the dragons come on.\"    \"Take care,\" cried Polly, with intercepting hand, \"that's Auntie's  lovely satin gown.\"    \"Beg pardon,\" said Jasper, relinquishing it speedily. \"Here's the sofa  pillow, after all,\" dragging it from its temporary retirement under the  theatrical debris. \"Now let's get back to work; time is going fast.\" In  a lowered voice:              \"'We have a princess, to be sure,             A sweet and gracious Clotilde,             And a knight who does her homage,             But the rest of us             Are fishy, scaly,             Horny and altogether horrid,             And of very low degree             Who scarce know why we are upon the boards,             Except for your amusement,             So prithee'\"?    \"Hold!\" cried Clare, \"what stuff.\"    \"Give me an inch of time,\" cried Jasper, hurrying on, \"and I'll end the  misery:              \"'So prithee, be amused;             We're undone, if you are not,             And all our labor lost.             Pray laugh, and shake your sides,             And say \"'tis good;             I' faith, 'tis very good.\"             And we shall say             \"Your intellects do you credit.\"             And so we bid you a fond adieu,             And haste away to unshackle the dragons,             Who even now do roar without.'\"    Clare threw himself into the part of the dragons, and forgetful of  Phronsie, gave a loud roar. Polly clapped her hands and tossed an  imaginary bouquet as Jasper bowed himself off.    \"Hush!\" said Ben, \"you'll wake up Phronsie,\" but it was too late; there  she sat rubbing her eyes in astonishment.    \"Oh! you darling,\" cried Polly, running over to her, to clasp her in  her arms, \"I'm so sorry I tired you all out, Phronsie dear, do forgive  me.\"    \"I'm not tired,\" said Phronsie, with dewy eyes. \"Has Jasper got through  reading? What was it all about, Polly?\"    \"Indeed and I have finished,\" he cried with a yawn and throwing the  manuscript on the table, \"and I don't know in the least what it is all  about, Phronsie.\"    \"Just a lot of dreadful words,\" said Clare over in the corner, pulling  at a heap of costumes on the floor. \"Never mind; the horrible spell is  broken; come on, you fellows, and tumble into your dragon skins!\"    With that the chief dragon deserted Phronsie, and presently there  resounded the rattle of the scales, the clanking of chains, and the  dragging about of the rest of their paraphernalia.    \"Now, Phronsie,\" said Jasper, coming back, half-within his dragon skin  and gesticulating, \"you see that it's only I in this thing. Look, dear!  here goes in my head,\" and he pulled on the scaly covering, observing  great care to smile reassuringly the last thing before his countenance  was obscured.    Phronsie screamed with delight and clapped her hands. \"Oh, Jasper! let  me have one on, do, Jasper! I'd much rather be a dragon than a  princess. Really and truly I would, Jasper.\"    \"I don't agree with you,\" said Jasper, in a muffled voice. \"Phew! this  is no end stuffy, fellows. I can't stand it long.\"    \"I'm all coming to pieces,\" said Ben, turning around to regard his back  where the scales yawned fearfully.    \"I'll run and ask Mamsie to come and sew you up,\" cried Polly, flying  off. \"She said she would help, if we wanted her.\"          IV    WELCOME HOME!      \"Marian,\" said old Mr. King, putting his head in at the door of her  little writing-room, \"can't you get her comfortably out of the way this  morning? I want your services without interruption.\"    \"She's going down to Pinaud's,\" said Mrs. Whitney, looking up from the  note she was writing.    \"Capital! when she once gets there, she'll stay the morning,\" declared  Mr. King, greatly pleased. \"Now, then, after she's cleverly off, you  may come to me.\"    \"I will, father,\" said Marian, going back with a smile to her  correspondence.    Half an hour later Thomas, with the aid of the horses and the shopping  coupe having carried off Mrs. Chatterton, Mrs. Whitney pushed aside her  notes, and ran down to her father's study.    She found him in his velvet morning-gown seated before his table, busy  with a good-sized list of names that was rapidly growing longer under  his pen.    \"Oh! I forgot,\" he said, looking up; \"I intended to tell you to bring  some of your cards and envelopes. I want some invitations written.\"    \"Are you going to give a dinner?\" asked Marian, looking over his  shoulder. \"Oh, no! I see by the length of your list it's an evening  affair, or a musicale.\"    \"You run along, daughter,\" said the old gentleman, \"and get what I tell  you. This is my affair; it's a musicale and something else combined. I  don't just know myself.\" And he laughed at the sight of her face.    \"If father is only pleased, I don't care what it is,\" said Mrs. Whitney  to herself, hurrying over the stairs and back again, never once  thinking of Polly's and Jasper's surprise for the boys.    \"You see, Marian,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5637"],[0,"Literary and Philosophical Essays: French, German and Italian (#5)"],[1,"can, attaine to this advantage: Herein consists the  true and soveraigne liberty, that affords us meanes wherewith to  jeast and make a scorne of force and injustice, and to deride  imprisonment, gives [Footnote: Gyves, shackles] or fetters.           --in manicis, et       Compedibus, savo te sub custode tenebo.       Ipse Deus simui atque volam, me solvet: opinor       Hoc sentit, moriar. Mors ultima linea rerum est.       [Footnote: Hor. I. i. Ep. xvi. 76.]         In gyves and fetters I will hamper thee,       Under a Jayler that shall cruell be:       Yet, when I will, God me deliver shall,       He thinkes, I shall die: death is end of all.    Our religion hath had no surer humane foundation than the contempt  of life. Discourse of reason doth not only call and summon us unto  it. For why should we feare to lose a thing, which being lost,  cannot be moaned? but also, since we are threatened by so many kinds  of death, there is no more inconvenience to feare them all, than to  endure one: what matter is it when it commeth, since it is  unavoidable? Socrates answered one that told him, \"The thirty  tyrants have condemned thee to death.\" \"And Nature them,\" said he.  What fondnesse is it to carke and care so much, at that instant and  passage from all exemption of paine and care? As our birth brought  us the birth of all things, so shall our death the end of all  things. Therefore is it as great follie to weepe, we shall not live  a hundred yeeres hence, as to waile we lived not a hundred yeeres  agoe. \"Death is the beginning of another life.\" So wept we, and so  much did it cost us to enter into this life; and so did we spoile us  of our ancient vaile in entring into it. Nothing can be grievous  that is but once. Is it reason so long to fear a thing of so short  time? Long life or short life is made all one by death. For long or  short is not in things that are no more. Aristotle saith, there are  certaine little beasts alongst the river Hyspanis, that live but one  day; she which dies at 8 o'clocke in the morning, dies in her youth,  and she that dies at 5 in the afternoon, dies in her decrepitude,  who of us doth not laugh, when we shall see this short moment of  continuance to be had in consideration of good or ill fortune? The  most and the least is ours, if we compare it with eternitie, or  equall it to the lasting of mountains, rivers, stars, and trees, or  any other living creature, is not lesse ridiculous. But nature  compels us to it. Depart (saith she) out of this world, even as you  came into it. The same way you came from death to life, returne  without passion or amazement, from life to death: your death is but  a peece of the worlds order, and but a parcell of the worlds life.       --inter se mortales mutua vivunt,       Et quasi cursores vitae lampada tradunt.       [Footnote: Lucret. ii. 74. 77.]         Mortall men live by mutuall entercourse:       And yeeld their life-torch, as men in a course.    Shal I not change this goodly contexture of things for you? It is  the condition of your creation: death is a part of yourselves: you  flie from yourselves. The being you enjoy is equally shared betweene  life and death. The first day of your birth doth as wel addresse you  to die, as to live.         Prima quae vitam dedit, hora, carpsit.       [Footnote: Sen. Her. Sw. ckor. Iii.]         The first houre, that to men       Gave life, strait, cropt it then.         Nascentes morimur, finisque ab origine pendet:       [Footnote: Manil. At. l. iv]         As we are borne we die; the end       Doth of th' originall depend.    All the time you live, you steale it from death: it is at her  charge. The continuall worke of your life, is to contrive death: you  are in death, during the time you continue in life: for, you are  after death, when you are no longer living. Or if you had rather  have it so, you are dead after life: but during life, you are still  dying: and death doth more rudely touch the dying than the dead, and  more lively and essentially. If you have profited by life, you have  also beene fed thereby, depart then satisfied.         Cur non ut plenus vitae conviva recedis?       [Footnote: Lucret. 1. iii. 982.]         Why like a full-fed guest,       Depart you not to rest?    If you have not knowne how to make use of it: if it were  unprofitable to you, what need you care to have lost it to what end  would you enjoy it longer?       --cur amplius addere quaeris       Rursum quod pereat male,       et ingratum occidat omne?       [Footnote: Lucret. 1. iii. 989.]         Why seeke you more to gaine, what must againe       All perish ill, and passe with griefe or paine?    Life in itselfe is neither good nor evill: it is the place of good  or evill, according as you prepare it for them. And if you have  lived one day, you have seene all: one day is equal to all other  daies. There is no other light, there is no other night. This Sunne,  this Moone, these Starres, and this disposition, is the very same  which your forefathers enjoyed, and which shall also entertaine your  posteritie.         Non alium videre patres, aliumve nepotes       Aspicient.       [Footnote: Manil. i. 523.]         No other saw our Sires of old,       No other shall their sonnes behold.    And if the worst happen, the distribution and varietie of all the  acts of my comedie, is performed in one yeare. If you have observed  the course of my foure seasons; they containe the infancie, the  youth, the viriltie, and the old age of the world. He hath plaied  his part: he knowes no other wilinesse belonging to it, but to begin  againe, it will ever be the same, and no other.         Versamur ibidem, atque insumus usque,       [Footnote: Lucret. 1. iii. 123.]         We still in one place turne about,       Still there we are, now in, now out.         Atque in se sua per vestigia volvitur annus.       [Footnote: Virg. Georg. 1. ii. 403.]         The yeare into it selfe is cast       By those same steps, that it hath past.    I am not purposed to devise you other new sports.         Nam tibi praterea quod machiner, inveniamque       Quod placeat nihil est; eadem suni omnia semper.       [Footnote: Lucret. 1. ii. 978.]         Else nothing, that I can devise or frame,       Can please thee, for all things are still the same.    Make roome for others, as others have done for you. Equalitie is the  chiefe ground-worke of equitie, who can complaine to be comprehended  where all are contained? So may you live long enough, you shall  never diminish anything from the time you have to die: it is  bootlesse; so long shall you continue in that state which you feare,  as if you had died, being in your swathing-clothes, and when you  were sucking.       --licet, quot vis, vivendo vincere secla.       Mors sterna tamen, nihilominus ilia manebit.       [Footnote: Ib. 1126.]         Though yeares you live, as many as you will,       Death is eternall, death remaineth still.    And I will so please you, that you shall have no discontent.         In vera nescis nullum fore morte alium te,       Qui possit vivus tibi te lugere peremptum,       Stansque jacentem.       [Footnote: Idt. 1. Iii. 9.]         Thou know'st not there shall be not other thou,       When thou art dead indeed, that can tell how       Alive to waile thee dying, Standing to waile thee lying.    Nor shall you wish for life, which you so much desire         Nec sibi enim quisquam tum se vitamque requirit,       [Footnote: ib. 963.]       Nec desiderium nostri nos afficit ullum.       [Footnote: Ib. 966.]         For then none for himselfe or life requires:       Nor are we of our selves affected with desires.    Death is lesse to be feared than nothing, if there were anything  lesse than nothing.         --multo mortem minus ad nos esse putandum,       Si minus esse potest quam quod nihil esse videmus.       [Footnote: Ib. 970.]         Death is much less to us, we ought esteeme,       If lesse may be, than what doth nothing seeme.    Nor alive, nor dead, it doth concern you nothing. Alive because you  are: Dead, because you are no more. Moreover, no man dies before his  houre. The time you leave behinde was no more yours than that which  was before your birth, and concerneth you no more.         Respice enim quam nil ad nos anteacta vetustas       Temporis aeterni fuerit.       [Footnote: Ib. 1016.]         For marke, how all antiquitie foregone       Of all time ere we were, to us was none.    Wheresoever your life ended, there is it all. The profit of life  consists not in the space, but rather in the use. Some man hath  lived long, that hath a short life, Follow it whilst you have time.  It consists not in number of yeeres, but in your will, that you have  lived long enough. Did you thinke you should never come to the  place, where you were still going? There is no way but hath an end.  And if company may solace you, doth not the whole world walke the  same path?       --Omnia te, vita perfuncta, sequentur.       [Footnote: Ib. 1012.]         Life past, all things at last       Shall follow thee as thou hast past.    Doe not all things move as you doe, or keepe your course? Is there  any thing grows not old together with yourselfe? A thousand men, a  thousand beasts, and a thousand other creatures die in the very  instant that you die.         Nam nox nulla diem, neque noctem aurora sequuta est,       Que non audierit mistus vagitibus aegris       Ploratus, mortis comites et funeris atri.       [Footnote: Id. i. ii. 587.]         No night ensued day light; no morning followed night,       Which heard not moaning mixt with sick-mens groaning,       With deaths and funerals joyned was that moaning.    To what end recoile you from it, if you cannot goe backe. You have  seene many who have found good in death, ending thereby many many  miseries. But have you seene any that hath received hurt thereby?  Therefore it is meere simplicitie to condemne a thing you never"]]]
