She was brought to  the dockyard at Deptford to fit out. Her appearance was, of course,  wholly different from that of a vessel built as a man-of-war, and we  shall see that this caused trouble at Rio Janeiro, where the combination  of merchant build and officers in uniform in an armed ship, aroused  suspicions in the mind of the Portuguese Viceroy.    It is nowhere directly stated whether the Endeavour was sheathed with  copper or not; but as Cook in the account of his second voyage expresses  himself as adverse to this method of protecting ships' bottoms, and the  operation is recorded of heeling and boot topping, which was cleaning and  greasing the part of the ship just below waterline, it may be concluded  that her sheathing was wood.    She proved a most suitable vessel. The log states she was a little crank,  but an admirable sea-boat. Her rate of sailing was of course, with her  build, slow, but her strength and flat bottom stood her in good stead  when she made acquaintance with a coral reef.    She mounted ten small carriage guns and twelve swivels.    Mr. Banks, a scientific botanist, afterwards well known as Sir Joseph  Banks, and for a long time President of the Royal Society, a gentleman of  private means, volunteered to accompany Cook, and took with him a staff  of his own, of artists and others.    He also induced Dr. Solander, a Swedish naturalist, afterwards attached  to the British Museum, to accompany him.    Mr. Charles Green, one of the assistants at the Royal Observatory at  Greenwich, was sent as astronomer.    This scientific staff added much to the success of the expedition.    Banks and Solander, both men of observation, were able to collect  specimens of natural history, and study the manners and customs of the  natives with whom they came in contact, which neither the time at Cook's  disposal nor his training enabled him to undertake; and though the  Journal of the former has never yet been published, and cannot at the  present time be traced, many interesting remarks were extracted by Dr.  Hawkesworth from it and went far to make his account of the voyage  complete.    Mr. Green also demands special notice.    One great question of the day amongst seamen and geographers was the  discovering of some ready and sure method of ascertaining the longitude.  Half the value of the explorations made up to this time had been lost  from this want. The recognised means of finding longitude was by the  observation of lunars; that is, accurately measuring the angular distance  between the centres of the moon and of the sun, or of the moon and some  star.    The motion of the moon is so rapid that this angular distance changes  from second to second, and thereby, by previous astronomical calculation,  the time at Greenwich at which its distance from any body is a certain  number of degrees can be ascertained and recorded.    By well-known calculations the local time at any spot can be obtained,  and when this is ascertained, at the precise moment that the angular  distance of sun and moon is observed, the difference gives the longitude.    This seems simple enough, but there is a good deal of calculation to go  through before the result is reached, and neither the observation nor the  calculation is easy, especially with the astronomical tables of those  days, and there were very few sailors who were capable of, or patient  enough to make them, nor was the result, as a rule, very accurate. For  one thing, the motions of the moon, which are extremely complicated, were  not enough known to allow her calculated position in the heavens to be  very accurate, and a very small error in this position considerably  affects the time, and therefore the longitude.    Luckily for Cook, the Nautical Almanac had just been started, and  contained tables of the moon which had not previously been available, and  which much lightened the calculations.    The great invention of the chronometer, that is, a watch that can be  trusted to keep a steady rate for long periods, was at this time  completed by Harrison; but very few had been manufactured, and  astronomers and sailors were slow to believe in the efficacy of this  method of carrying time about with a ship. Thus Cook had no chronometer  supplied to him.    Green had accompanied Mr. Maskelyne, afterwards Astronomer Royal, to  Barbados in 1763 in H.M.S. Princess Louisa, in order to test Harrison's  timekeeper, and also a complicated chair, from which it was supposed  observations of Jupiter's satellites could be observed on board ship; and  as this trial afforded the final triumph of the new method, one would  have thought that on a voyage of circumnavigation he would have made  every effort to get one of these watches.    Be this as it may, the Endeavour had no chronometer, and lunars were the  mainstay of the expedition.    In these observations Green was indefatigable. Cook, an excellent  observer himself frequently took part in them; but it was Green's  especial business, and no doubt to him is due the major part of the  determinations of accurate longitude, which is one of the very remarkable  points of this voyage.    Green's log, which is extant, is filled with lunar observations, and the  extraordinary coincidence between different observations attests the care  with which they were made. I dwell upon this because, while full of  admiration for Cook's knowledge, and his untiring zeal in every detail of  his expedition, it is evident, from a study of the original documents,  that without Green many opportunities of getting longitude would have  been lost, Cook having no time to spare to make use of them. Let us give  honour to whom honour is due.    The final results of the observations are not equally good, but this  arises from the errors, before referred to, in the moon's place in the  heavens as given in the almanac, which would vary with her position, and  affect the longitude accordingly. The astonishing thing is, not that some  longitudes are considerably in error, but that the majority of them are  so near the truth.    The Endeavour sailed from the Thames on June 30th, 1768, and was in  Plymouth Sound from July 14th to the 26th, when she finally sailed, Banks  and the scientific staff having joined here.    She carried a complement, all told, of ninety-four, and very close  stowage it must have been.    A list is given in this book, immediately before the \"Journal,\" of every  person on board when the ship sailed from Plymouth.    The draught of the ship was 13 feet 6 inches, and her provisions were  calculated to last eighteen months. The original intention had been that  the transit of Venus should be observed at the Marquesas; but the  Dolphin's return before Cook sailed, with the news of the discovery of  Tahiti and its friendly inhabitants, caused this island to be finally  selected.    The exact text of Cook's orders cannot be given. They were secret orders;  but, curiously enough, while the covering letter, which enjoined him to  show them to nobody, which is dated July 30th, 1768, is duly entered in  Admiralty Records, the orders themselves, which should follow in the  letter book, are omitted. They have never been published. Nevertheless,  we can gather what they were.    Cook, in the published account of his Second Voyage, says he had  instructions to proceed directly to Tahiti, and afterwards to prosecute  the design of making discoveries in the Pacific by proceeding southward  to the latitude of 40 degrees, and if he did not find land to continue  his voyage to the west till he fell in with New Zealand, which he was  directed to explore, and thence to return to England by such route as he  should judge most convenient.    Precautions against the terrible scourge, scurvy, had not been forgotten.    Besides the supply of all anti-scorbutics then known, a special letter  was written to Cook directing him to take a quantity of malt to sea, for  the purpose of being made into wort, as a cure for scorbutic disorders,  as recommended by Dr. McBride.    The directions for its use were as follows:--    \"The malt must be ground under the direction of the surgeon, and made  into wort, fresh every day, in the following manner:--    \"1. Take one quart of ground malt, and pour on it three quarts of boiling  water. Stir them well, and let the mixture stand close covered up for  three or four hours, after which strain off the liquor.    \"2. The wort, so prepared, is then to be boiled into a panada, with sea  biscuit or dried fruits generally carried to sea.    \"3. The patient must make at least two meals a day of the said panada,  and should drink a quart or more of the fresh infusion as it may agree  with him, every twenty-four hours.    \"4. The surgeon is to keep an exact account of its effects.\"    Though it is somewhat anticipating events, it is convenient to record  here the result of these efforts to defeat the hitherto unconquerable  enemy. Mr. Perry's report at the termination of the voyage is as  follows:--    \"Sour krout, mustard, vinegar, wheat, inspissated orange and lemon  juices, saloup, portable soup, sugar, molasses, vegetables (at all times  when they could be got) were, some in constant, others in occasional use.  These were of such infinite service to the people in preserving them from  a scorbutic taint, that the use of the malt was (with respect to  necessity) almost entirely precluded.    \"Again cold bathing was encouraged and enforced by example; the allowance  of salt beef and pork was abridged from nearly the beginning of the  voyage, and the sailors' usual custom of mixing the salt beef fat with  their flour, etc., was strictly forbad.    \"Upon our leaving England, also, a stop was put to our issuing butter and  cheese, and throughout the voyage raisins were served with the flour  instead of pickled suet.

[Footnote: The Peak of Teneriffe is 12,182 feet  high.] But within two miles of the top is nothing but ashes and pumish  stones: yet beneath that two miles is the colde region couered all the yere  with snow, and somewhat lower are mighty huge trees growing called  Vinatico, which are exceeding heauy and will not rot in any water although  they lie a thousand yeeres therein. Also there is a wood called Barbusano,  of like vertue, with many Sauine trees and Pine trees. And beneath these  sorts of trees are woods of Bay trees of ten and 12 miles long, which is a  pleasant thing to trauell thorow, among the which are great numbers of  small birds, which sing exceeding sweet, but especially one sort that are  very litle, and of colour in all respects like a Swallow, sauing that he  hath a little blacke spot on his breast as broad as a peny. He singeth more  sweetly than all the rest, but if he be taken and imprisoned in a cage, he  liueth but a small while. [Sidenote: Lime.] This Iland bringeth foorth all  sorts of fruits, as Canaria doth: and also all the other Ilands in generall  bring foorth shrubs or bushes, out of the which issueth a iuice as white as  milke, which after a while that it hath come out waxeth thicke, and is  exceeding good birdlime, the bush is called Taybayba. This Iland also  bringeth foorth another tree called Drago, which groweth on high among  rocks, and by incision at the foot of the tree issueth out a liquor like  blood, which is a common drug among Apothecaries. Of the wood of this tree  are made targets greatly esteemed, because if any sword or dagger hit  thereon, they sticke so fast that it is hard plucking them out.    This is the most fruitfull Iland of all the rest for corne, and in that  respect is a mother or nurse to all the others in time of need. [Sidenote:  Orchel good for dying.] There groweth also a certaine mosse vpon the high  rocks called Orchel, which is bought for Diars to die withall. There are 12  sugar houses called Ingenios, which make great quantity of sugar. There is  also one league of ground which standeth between two townes, the one called  Larotaua, and the other Rialeio, and it is thought that the like plot of  ground is not in all the world. The reason is, that this one league of  ground produceth sweet water out of the cliffes or rocky mountaines, come  of all sortes, fruites of all sortes, and excellent good silke, flaxe,  waxe, and hony, and very good wines in abundance, with great store of sugar  and fire wood. Out of this Iland is laden great quantities of wines for the  West India, and other countreys. The best groweth on a hill side called the  Ramble.    There is in that Iland a faire citie, standing three leagues from the sea,  nere vnto a lake called Laguna, wherein are two faire parish churches,  there dwelleth the gouernour who ruleth all that Iland, with iustice. There  are also aldermen for the publike weale, who buy their offices of the king:  the most of the whole inhabitants of this city are gentlemen, merchants,  and husband men.    [Sidenote: Santa Cruz.] There are foure other townes called Santa Cruz,  Larotaua, Rialeio, and Garachico. In this Iland before the conquest dwelt  seuen kings, who with all their people dwelt in caues, and were clothed in  goat skinnes, as the Canaria people were, and vsed such like order of diet  as they had. Their order of buriall was, that when any died, he was carried  naked to a great caue, where he was propped vp against the wall standing on  his feet. But if he were of any authority among them, then had he a staffe  in his hand, and a vessell of milke standing by him. I haue seene caues of  300 of these corpses together, the flesh being dried vp, the body remained  as light as parchment. These people were called Guanches, naturally they  spake another language cleane contrary to the Canarians, and so  consequently euery Iland spake a seuerall language.    Note (gentle reader) that the Iland of Canaria, the Ile of Tenerif, and the  Ile of Palma appertaine to the king of Spaine, vnto whom they pay fifty  thousand duckats yeerely for custome and other profits. All these Ilands  ioyntly are one bishopricke, which pay to the bishop twelue thousand  duckats yeerely. And thus I conclude of the Ile of Tenerif, which standeth  in 27 degrees and a halfe, as I haue before declared.      Gomera.    The Iland of Gomera standeth Westward from Tenerif in distance sixe  leagues: this is but a small Iland conteining eight leagues in length. It  is an Earledome, and the Lord thereof is called the earle of Gomera. But in  case of any controuersie the vassals may appeale to the kings superior  Iudges which reside in Canaria.    This Iland hath one proper towne called Gomera, which hath an excellent  good port or harbour for ships, where often times the Indian fleet takes  refreshing for their voyage.    There is also sufficient graine and fruit for the maintenance of  themselues.    There is one Ingenio or Sugar-house, with great plenty of wine and other  sorts of fruits, as Canaria and Tenerif hath.    This Iland yeeldeth no other commodity but onely orchell; it standeth in 27  degrees distant from the Equator toward the pole Arcticke.      The Ile of Palma.    The Ile of Palma standeth twelue leagues distant from the Ile of Gomera  Northwestward. This Iland is fruitfull of wine and sugar: it hath a proper  city called the city of Palma, where is great contraction for vines, which  are laden for the West India and other places. This city hath one faire  church, and a gouernour, and aldermen to maintaine and execute iustice. It  hath also another prety towne, called S. Andrewes. It hath also foure  Ingenios which make excellent sugar, two of the which are called Zauzes,  and the other two, Tassacort.    This Iland yeeldeth but little bread-corne; but rather is thereof prouided  from Tenerif and other places.    Their best wines grow in a soile called the Brenia, where yeerely is  gathered twelue thousand buts of wine like vnto Malmsies. This Iland  standeth round, and containeth in circuit neere fiue and twenty leagues. It  hath plenty of all sorts of fruits, as Canaria and Tenerif haue, it  standeth in twenty seuen degrees and a halfe.      The Iland of Yron, called Hierro.    This Iland standeth ten leagues distant from the Iland of Palma Westward:  it is but a little Iland, which containeth sixe leagues in circuit, and  hath but small extension. It appertaineth to the earle of Gomera. The  chiefest commodity of this Iland is goats flesh and orchell. [Sidenote: The  onely vineyard in Hierro planted by Ioh. Hill of Taunton.] There is no wine  in all that Iland, but onely one vineyard that an English man of Taunton in  the West countrey planted among rocks, his name was Iohn Hill.    This Iland hath no kind of fresh water, but onely in the middle of the  Iland groweth a great tree with leaues like an Oliue tree which hath a  great cisterne at the foot of the sayd tree. This tree continually is  couered with clouds, and by meanes thereof the leaues of the said tree  continually drop water, very sweet, into the sayd cisterne, which commeth  to the sayd tree from the clouds by attraction. And this water sufficeth  the Iland for all necessities, as well for the cattell, as for the  inhabitants. [Footnote: In connection with this fable, it is interesting to  see what is said by Le Maire, who visited these Islands in 1682. \"As I had  been told of a wonderful tree in Ferro, whose long and narrow leaves were  always green, and furnished all the inhabitants with water, I wished to  find out if it were true. I asked if, as I had heard, such a heavy dew fell  on this tree that it dropped clear water into stone basins placed expressly  to receive it. There was enough of it for the islanders and their cattle,  Nature repairing by this miracle the defect of not providing pure water for  this isle. The inhabitants confirmed my belief that this was a pure fable.  There were some, however, who said that there might have been such a tree,  but it could never have furnished the quantity attributed to it.\" [See  VOYAGE TO THE CANARIES, etc, page 21, reprinted In _Bibliotheca Curiosa_.]]  It standeth in 27 degrees.      The Iland of Lanzarota    The Iland of Lanzarota standeth eighteene leagues distant from grand  Canaria Southeastward. The onely commodity of this Iland is goats flesh and  orchell. It is an earldome, and doth, appertaine to Don Augustine de  Herrerra, with title of earle of Fortauentura and Lanzarota. But the  vassals of these earledomes may in any cause of wrong appeale to the Kings  Iudges, which reside in Canaria, as I haue sayd before: because although  the king hath reserued to himselfe but onely the three fruitful Ilands,  called Canaria, Teneriff and Palma, yet he also reserued the rod of Iustice  to himselfe, because otherwise the vassals might be euil intreated of their  Lords.    From this Iland do weekly resort to Canaria, Tenerif, and Palma, boats  laden with dried goats flesh, called Tussmetta, which serueth in stead of  bacon, and is very good meat. This Iland standeth in 26 degrees, and is in  length twelue leagues.      The Ile of Forteuentura.    The Ile of Forteuentura standeth fifty leagues from the promontory of Cabo  de Guer, in the firme land of Africa, and foure and twenty leagues distant  from Canaria Eastward. This Iland doth appertaine to the lord of Lanzarota.  It is reasonable fruitfull of wheat and barley, and also of kine, goats,  and orchel: this Ile is fifteene leagues long and ten leagues broad. On the  North side it hath a little Iland about one league distant from the maine  Iland, betweene both of the which it is nauigable for any ships, and is  called Graciosa.    Both Forteuentura and Lanzarota haue very little wine of the growth of  those Ilands. It standeth"]]]
