It is during the Kirtland period of her history also that the Church  raised her eyes and for the first time gazed out upon the world-wide  sphere of her future activities. Until now she had confined her  missions and labors to the United States and Canada. But lo! a foreign  {XXV} ministry had been organized, a quorum of Twelve Apostles and two  quorums of Seventy had been called into existence and ordained. Was  that without significance? Undoubtedly there is power in ordinances,  in divine appointments: \"Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit  of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him and the children  of Israel hearkened unto him and did as the Lord commanded Moses.\"  While Timothy, the young Christian evangelist, was admonished by Paul  to stir up the gift of God which was in him by the putting on of  the Apostle's hands. Since, then, there is virtue in ordinations of  divine appointing, it is but to be expected that the Church of Christ  in this last dispensation would be influenced by the appointment and  ordination of her foreign ministry. It was but a proper sequence of the  appointment of this ministry that Apostles and their associates should  be sent to England. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints was  never intended to be merely an American sect of religion. It is a new  and the last dispensation of the Christian religion--the Dispensation  of the Fullness of Times, the dispensation into which will be gathered  all former dispensations of the Gospel of Christ; all keys of  authority, all powers, all gifts, all graces essential to the welfare  and salvation of man--all that is essential to the completion of the  mission of the Christian religion. The mission of the Church in such a  dispensation is general not local, world-embracing. Had it been less  than one of the world's great movements, Mormonism had been inadequate  to the world's needs--less than sufficient for a world's redemption.  There was marked, therefore, a mighty bound forward in the progress  of the work when the foreign ministry of the Church was organized,  and a mission appointed to England. The work would have perished had  it not taken this step forward. The Church had reached that stage  of development when there must be a forward movement. Things do not  stand inert in this world. Inertia is death. In progress only is there  life. The thing that does not grow dies. The very rocks increase or  decay. For the time being the elements on which the Church lived were  exhausted in the land where it came forth. The material which had been  gathered into it was passing through the crucible. There was need of an  enlargement of action, a necessity for new elements being brought into  the body religious. That enlargement of action was found in opening  the British mission. The new elements essential to the preservation of  the work were found in the English people; for among them were given  the evidences of the existence of the spiritual light and life which  had characterized the work at its coming forth: and as that mission  had been directly appointed by the Prophet Joseph Smith, it supplied  the proofs that God was still with him, honored the {XXVI} authority  which had been given him, and still directed his movements in the  administration of the affairs of the Church; for it was the prompting  of the Spirit of God in the Prophet, that led to the appointment of  this first foreign mission. These considerations made the opening of  the British mission an epoch in the history of the Church.    _The Restoration of the Keys for the Gathering of Israel_.    The work of God was also greatly enlarged during this Kirtland period,  by the appearance of Moses and Elias and Elijah, and bestowing upon the  Prophet the keys of their respective dispensations. Let us contemplate  the event. \"Moses appeared before us,\" says the Prophet, \"and committed  unto us the keys of the gathering of Israel, from the four parts of the  earth, and the leading of the ten tribes from the land of the north.\"  Who, at the time comprehended the full import of this incident? Who  comprehends it now? From the beginning of the great Latter-Day work  men had their attention directed to the gathering of Israel and the  establishment of Zion and Jerusalem as a part of the purposes of God to  be accomplished in the work. The angel Moroni on the occasion of his  first visit to the Prophet Joseph, quoted a number of Old Testament  scriptures referring to the Lord's promises concerning the redemption  of Judah and Jerusalem; [1] also concerning the gathering of Israel  from all the lands whither they had been driven. [2] Numerous are the  prophecies relating to the return of Israel from the land of the north,  and other parts of the earth, into which they were driven in the day of  their rebellion and apostasy; [3] but it occurred to no one that before  these prophecies could be fulfilled Israel's great prophet, Moses,  who held the keys of the dispensation pertaining to the gathering of  Israel, must come and give to men the authority to proceed with that  work. The moment he appears, however, and gives such authority, the  propriety of it, the fitness of it is apparent. The appearance of Moses  was also in proper sequence of events in the development of the great  Latter-Day work. Although, as already stated, the gathering of Israel  in the last days had been made a prominent feature in the communication  of Moroni to the Prophet Joseph, and the subject also of some other  early revelations to the Church [4] not until the foreign ministry had  been organized--the Twelve and the Seventy--the quorums of Priesthood  on which rests the {XXVII} responsibility to travel in all the world  and preach the Gospel and gather Israel--not until this ministry  was organized did Moses appear and commit the keys of the gathering  of Israel from the four parts of the earth. What order is here? The  organization of the foreign ministry to go into all the nations of  earth, and then the coming of Moses to commit the keys of the gathering  of Israel from the four parts of the earth, and the leading of the ten  tribes from the land of the north. In this incident as in a thousand  others in the great work of God in the last days, the evidence of a  divine wisdom having regard for the eternal fitness of things, for the  proper sequence in the order of events in the development of the Lord's  purposes, is apparent. Note, too, the spiritual effect upon the Saints  of the restoration of these keys of the gathering of Israel. Before the  mission for England under Elders Kimball and Hyde departed, the prophet  enjoined them to adhere strictly to the first principles of the Gospel,  and say nothing for the present in relation to the gathering; this,  doubtless on account of the unsettled condition of the Church at the  time. Similar instructions, and for the same reason, were given to the  Twelve Apostles in 1839 when they went on their mission to England. But  the Saints could not be kept in ignorance of these matters. No sooner  were the people baptized than they were seized with a desire to gather  with the main body of the Church. \"I find it is difficult to keep  anything from the Saints,\" writes Elder Taylor in his journal of this  period, \"for the Spirit of God reveals it to them. * * * * Some time  ago Sister Mitchell dreamed the she, her husband and a number of others  were on board a vessel, and that there were other vessels, loaded with  Saints, going somewhere. She felt very happy and was rejoicing in the  Lord.\" Another sister, Elder Taylor informs us, had a similar dream,  and was informed that all the Saints were going. Neither of these  sisters nor any of the Saints at that time, knew anything about the  principle of gathering, yet all were anxious to leave their homes,  their kindred and the associations of a lifetime, to join the main  body of the Church in a distant land, the members of which were total  strangers to them. [5] The same spirit has rested upon the people in  every nation where the Gospel has been received. There has been little  need of preaching the gathering, the people as a rule have had to be  restrained rather than encouraged in the matter of gathering to Zion  and her stakes.    _The Spirit of Gathering on the Jews_.    During the last ten years the world has witnessed a remarkable change  of spirit come over the Jewish race. We hear of Jewish aspirations for  national existence; for the perpetuation of the Jewish customs {XXVIII}  and Jewish ideals. After saying so long, \"May we celebrate the next  Passover in Jerusalem,\" the thought at last seems to have occurred to  some Jewish minds that if that expressed wish is ever realized, some  practical steps must be taken looking to the actual achievement of that  possibility--which has given rise among the Jews to what is called the  \"Zionite Movement.\" The keynotes of that movement are heard in the  following utterances of some of the leaders in explanation of it: \"We  want to resume the broken thread of our national existence; we want to  show to the world the moral strength, the intellectual power of the  Jewish people. We want a place where the race can be centralized.\" [6]  \"It is for these Jews [of Russia, Romania and Galicia] that the name of  their country [Palestine] spells 'Hope.' I should not be a man if I did  not realize that for these persecuted Jews, Jerusalem spells reason,  justice, manhood and integrity.\" [7] \"Jewish nationalism on a modern  basis in Palestine, the old home of the people.\" [8] \"Palestine needs  a people, Israel needs a country. Give the country without a people,  to the people without a country.\" [9] In a word, it is the purpose of  \"Zionism\" to redeem Palestine and give it back to Jewish control--  create, in fact, a Jewish state in the land"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4723"],[0,"A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (#5)"],[1,"man, by so  much the deeper was he likely to be ensnared and faster held therein.  THIRDLY, so long as I confine my thoughts to my own ideas divested of  words, I do not see how I can easily be mistaken. The objects I consider,  I clearly and adequately know. I cannot be deceived in thinking I have an  idea which I have not. It is not possible for me to imagine that any of  my own ideas are alike or unlike that are not truly so. To discern the  agreements or disagreements there are between my ideas, to see what ideas  are included in any compound idea and what not, there is nothing more  requisite than an attentive perception of what passes in my own  understanding.    23. But the attainment of all THESE ADVANTAGES doth PRESUPPOSE AN ENTIRE  DELIVERANCE FROM THE DECEPTION OF WORDS, which I dare hardly promise  myself; so difficult a thing it is to dissolve an union so early begun,  and confirmed by so long a habit as that betwixt words and ideas. Which  difficulty seems to have been very much increased by the doctrine of  ABSTRACTION. For, so long as men thought abstract ideas were annexed to  their words, it doth not seem strange that they should use words for  ideas--it being found an impracticable thing to lay aside the word, and  RETAIN THE ABSTRACT IDEA IN THE MIND, WHICH IN ITSELF WAS PERFECTLY  INCONCEIVABLE. This seems to me the principal cause why those men who  have so emphatically recommended to others the laying aside all use of  words in their meditations, and contemplating their bare ideas, have yet  failed to perform it themselves. Of late many have been very sensible of  the absurd opinions and insignificant disputes which grow out of the  abuse of words. And, in order to remedy these evils, they advise well,  that we attend to the ideas signified, and draw off our attention from  the words which signify them. But, how good soever this advice may be  they have given others, it is plain they could not have a due regard to  it themselves, so long as they thought the only immediate use of words  was to signify ideas, and that the immediate signification of every  general name was a DETERMINATE ABSTRACT IDEA.    24. But, THESE BEING KNOWN TO BE MISTAKES, A MAN MAY with greater ease  PREVENT HIS BEING IMPOSED ON BY WORDS. He that knows he has no other than  particular ideas, will not puzzle himself in vain to find out and  conceive the abstract idea annexed to any name. And he that knows names  do not always stand for ideas will spare himself the labour of looking  for ideas where there are none to be had. It were, therefore, to be  wished that everyone would use his utmost endeavours to obtain a clear  view of the ideas he would consider, separating from them all that dress  and incumbrance of words which so much contribute to blind the judgment  and divide the attention. In vain do we extend our view into the heavens  and pry into the entrails of the earth, in vain do we consult the  writings of learned men and trace the dark footsteps of antiquity--we  need only draw the curtain of words, to hold the fairest tree of  knowledge, whose fruit is excellent, and within the reach of our hand.    25. Unless we take care TO CLEAR THE FIRST PRINCIPLES OF KNOWLEDGE FROM  THE embarras and DELUSION OF WORDS, we may make infinite reasonings upon  them to no purpose; we may draw consequences from consequences, and be  never the wiser. The farther we go, we shall only lose ourselves the more  irrecoverably, and be the deeper entangled in difficulties and mistakes.  Whoever therefore designs to read the following sheets, I entreat him to  make my words the occasion of his own thinking, and endeavour to attain  the same train of thoughts in reading that I had in writing them. By this  means it will be easy for him to discover the truth or falsity of what I  say. He will be out of all danger of being deceived by my words, and I do  not see how he can be led into an error by considering his own naked,  undisguised ideas.          OF THE PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE      1. OBJECTS OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE.--It is evident to any one who takes a  survey of the objects of human knowledge, that they are either IDEAS  actually imprinted on the senses; or else such as are perceived by  attending to the passions and operations of the mind; or lastly, ideas  formed by help of memory and imagination--either compounding, dividing,  or barely representing those originally perceived in the aforesaid ways.  By sight I have the ideas of light and colours, with their several degrees  and variations. By touch I perceive hard and soft, heat and cold, motion  and resistance, and of all these more and less either as to quantity or  degree. Smelling furnishes me with odours; the palate with tastes; and  hearing conveys sounds to the mind in all their variety of tone and  composition. And as several of these are observed to accompany each  other, they come to be marked by one name, and so to be reputed as one  thing. Thus, for example a certain colour, taste, smell, figure and  consistence having been observed to go together, are accounted one  distinct thing, signified by the name APPLE. Other collections of ideas  constitute a stone, a tree, a book, and the like sensible things--which  as they are pleasing or disagreeable excite the passions of love,  hatred, joy, grief, and so forth.    2. MIND--SPIRIT--SOUL.--But, besides all that endless variety of ideas or  objects of knowledge, there is likewise something which knows or perceives  them, and exercises divers operations, as willing, imagining, remembering,  about them. This perceiving, active being is what I call MIND, SPIRIT,  SOUL, or MYSELF. By which words I do not denote any one of my ideas, but a  thing entirely distinct from them, WHEREIN THEY EXIST, or, which is the  same thing, whereby they are perceived--for the existence of an idea  consists in being perceived.    3. HOW FAR THE ASSENT OF THE VULGAR CONCEDED.--That neither our thoughts,  nor passions, nor ideas formed by the imagination, exist WITHOUT the mind,  is what EVERYBODY WILL ALLOW. And it seems no less evident that the  various sensations or ideas imprinted on the sense, however blended  or combined together (that is, whatever objects they compose),  cannot exist otherwise than IN a mind perceiving them. I think an  intuitive knowledge may be obtained of this by any one that shall  attend to WHAT IS MEANT BY THE TERM EXIST, when applied to sensible  things. The table I write on I say exists, that is, I see and feel  it; and if I were out of my study I should say it existed--meaning  thereby that if I was in my study I might perceive it, or that some other  spirit actually does perceive it.[Note.] There was an odour, that is, it  was smelt; there was a sound, that is, it was heard; a colour or figure,  and it was perceived by sight or touch. This is all that I can understand  by these and the like expressions. For as to what is said of the absolute  existence of unthinking things without any relation to their being  perceived, that seems perfectly unintelligible. Their ESSE is PERCIPI,  nor is it possible they should have any existence out of the minds or  thinking things which perceive them.    [Note: First argument in support of the author's theory.]    4. THE VULGAR OPINION INVOLVES A CONTRADICTION.--It is indeed  an opinion STRANGELY prevailing amongst men, that houses, mountains,  rivers, and in a word all sensible objects, have an existence,  natural or real, distinct from their being perceived by the  understanding. But, with how great an assurance and acquiescence soever  this principle may be entertained in the world, yet whoever shall find in  his heart to call it in question may, if I mistake not, perceive it to  involve a manifest contradiction. For, what are the fore-mentioned  objects but the things we perceive by sense? and what do we PERCEIVE  BESIDES OUR OWN IDEAS OR SENSATIONS? and is it not plainly repugnant that  any one of these, or any combination of them, should exist unperceived?    5. CAUSE OF THIS PREVALENT ERROR.--If we thoroughly examine this  tenet it will, perhaps, be found at bottom to depend on the doctrine  of ABSTRACT IDEAS. For can there be a nicer strain of abstraction  than to distinguish the existence of sensible objects from their  being perceived, so as to conceive them existing unperceived?  Light and colours, heat and cold, extension and figures--in a  word the things we see and feel--what are they but so many sensations,  notions, ideas, or impressions on the sense? and is it possible to  separate, even in thought, any of these from perception? For my part, I  might as easily divide a thing from itself. I may, indeed, divide in my  thoughts, or conceive apart from each other, those things which, perhaps  I never perceived by sense so divided. Thus, I imagine the trunk of a  human body without the limbs, or conceive the smell of a rose without  thinking on the rose itself. So far, I will not deny, I can abstract--if  that may properly be called ABSTRACTION which extends only to the  conceiving separately such objects as it is possible may really exist or  be actually perceived asunder. But my conceiving or imagining power does  not extend beyond the possibility of real existence or perception. Hence,  as it is impossible for me to see or feel anything without an actual  sensation of that thing, so is it impossible for me to conceive in my  thoughts any sensible thing or object distinct from the sensation or  perception of it.[Note.]    [Note: \"In truth the object and the sensation are the same thing, and  cannot therefore be abstracted from each other--Edit 1710.\"]    6. Some truths there are so near and obvious to the mind that a man need  only open his eyes to see them. Such I take this important one to be,  viz., that all the choir of heaven and furniture of the earth, in a word  all those bodies which compose the mighty frame of the world, have not  any subsistence"]]]
