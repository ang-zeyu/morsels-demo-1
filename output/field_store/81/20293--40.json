[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5268"],[0,"Courts and Criminals (#5)"],[1,"st, the police; second, the district attorney; third,  the press; and, lastly, the personal friends and family of the deceased  or injured party. Each for its own ends--be it professional pride,  personal glorification, hard cash, or revenge--is equally anxious to  find the evidence and establish a case. Of course, the police are the  first ones notified of the commission of a crime, but as it is now  almost universally their duty to inform at once the coroner and also  the district attorney thereof, a tripartite race for glory frequently  results which adds nothing to the dignity of the administration of  criminal justice.    The coroner is at best no more than an appendix to the legal anatomy,  and frequently he is a disease. The spectacle of a medical man of  small learning and less English trying to preside over a court of first  instance is enough to make the accused himself chuckle for joy.    Not long ago the coroners of New York discovered that, owing to the  fact that the district attorney or his representatives generally  arrived first at the scene of any crime, there was nothing left for the  \"medicos\" to do, for the district attorney would thereupon submit the  matter at once to the grand jury instead of going through the formality  of a hearing in the coroner's court. The legal medicine men felt  aggrieved, and determined to be such early birds that no worm should  escape them. Accordingly, the next time one of them was notified of a  homicide he raced his horse down Madison Avenue at such speed that he  collided with a trolley car and broke his leg.    Another complained to the district attorney that the assistants of the  latter, who had arrived at the scene of an asphyxiation before him, had  bungled everything.    \"Ach, dose young men!\" he exclaimed, wringing his hands--\"Dose young  men, dey come here and dey opened der vindow and let out der gas and all  mine evidence esgaped.\"    It is said that this interesting personage once instructed his jury  to find that \"the diseased came to his death from an ulster on the  stomach.\"    These anecdotes are, perhaps, what judges would call obiter dicta, yet  the coroner's court has more than once been utilized as a field in the  actual preparation of a criminal case. When Roland B. Molineux was first  suspected of having caused the death of Mrs. Adams by sending the famous  poisoned package of patent medicine to Harry Cornish through the  mails, the assistant district attorney summoned him as a witness to the  coroner's court and attempted to get from him in this way a statement  which Molineux would otherwise have refused to make.    When all the first hullabaloo is over and the accused is under arrest  and safely locked up, it is usually found that the police have merely  run down the obvious witnesses and made a prima facie case. All the  finer work remains to be done either by the district attorney himself  or by the detective bureau working under his immediate direction or  in harmony with him. Little order has been observed in the securing of  evidence. Every one is a fish who runs into the net of the police, and  all is grist that comes to their mill. The district attorney sends  for the officers who have worked upon the case and for the captain  or inspector who has directed their efforts, takes all the papers and  tabulates all their information. His practiced eye shows him at once  that a large part is valueless, much is contradictory, and all needs  careful elaboration. A winnowing process occurs then and there; and  the officers probably receive a \"special detail\" from headquarters and  thereafter take their orders from the prosecutor himself. The detective  bureau is called in and arrangements made for the running down of  particular clues. Then he will take off his coat, clear his desk, and  get down to work.    Of course, his first step is to get all the information he can as to the  actual facts surrounding the crime itself. He immediately subpoenas all  the witnesses, whether previously interrogated by the police or not,  who know anything about the matter, and subjects them to a rigorous  cross-examination. Then he sends for the police themselves and  cross-examines them. If it appears that any witnesses have disappeared  he instructs his detectives how and where to look for them. Often this  becomes in the end the most important element in the preparation for  the trial. Thus in the Nan Patterson case the search for and ultimate  discovery of Mr. and Mrs. Morgan Smith (the sister and brother-in-law of  the accused) was one of its most dramatic features. After they had been  found it was necessary to indict and then to extradite them in order  to secure their presence within the jurisdiction, and when all this had  been accomplished it proved practically valueless.    It frequently happens that an entire case will rest upon the testimony  of a single witness whose absence from the jurisdiction would prevent  the trial. An instance of such a case was that of Albert T. Patrick, for  without the testimony of his alleged accomplice--the valet, Jones--he  could not have been convicted of murder. The preservation of such a  witness and his testimony thus becomes of paramount importance, and  rascally witnesses sometimes enjoy considerable ease, if not luxury, at  the expense of the public while waiting to testify. Often, too, a case  of great interest will arise where the question of the guilt of the  accused turns upon the evidence of some one person who, either from  mercenary motives or because of \"blood and affection,\" is unwilling  to come to the fore and tell the truth. A striking case of this sort  occurred some ten years ago. The \"black sheep\" of a prominent New York  family forged the name of his sister to a draft for thirty thousand  dollars. This sister, who was an elderly woman of the highest character  and refinement, did not care to pocket the loss herself and declined to  have the draft debited to her account at the bank. A lawsuit followed,  in which the sister swore that the name signed to the draft was not in  her handwriting. She won her case, but some officious person laid the  matter before the district attorney. The forger was arrested and  his sister was summoned before the grand jury. Here was a pleasant  predicament. If she testified for the State her brother would  undoubtedly go to prison for many years, to say nothing of the notoriety  for the entire family which so sensational a case would occasion. She,  therefore, slipped out of the city and sailed for Europe the night  before she was to appear before the grand jury. Her brother was in due  course indicted and held for trial in large bail, but there was and  is no prospect of convicting him for his crime so long as his sister  remains in the voluntary exile to which she has subjected herself. She  can never return to New York to live unless something happens either to  the indictment or her brother, neither of which events seems likely in  the immediate future.    Perhaps, if the case is one of shooting, the weapon has vanished. Its  discovery may lead to the finding of the murderer. In one instance where  a body was found in the woods with a bullet through the heart, there was  nothing to indicate who had committed the crime. The only scintilla of  evidence was an exploded cartridge--a small thing on which to build  a case. But the district attorney had the hammer marks upon the cap  magnified several hundred times and then set out to find the rifle which  bore the hammer which had made them. Thousands of rifles all over the  State were examined. At last in a remote lumber camp was found the  weapon which had fired the fatal bullet. The owner was arrested, accused  of the murder, and confessed his crime. In like manner, if it becomes  necessary to determine where a typewritten document was prepared the  letters may be magnified, and by examining the ribbons of suspected  machines the desired fact may be ascertained. The magnifying glass still  plays an important part in detecting crime, although usually in ways  little suspected by the general public.    On the other hand, where the weapon has not been spirited away the  detectives may spend weeks in discovering when and where it was  purchased. Every pawnshop, every store where a pistol could be bought,  is investigated, and under proper circumstances the requisite evidence  to show deliberation and premeditation may be secured.    These investigations are naturally conducted at the very outset of the  preparation of the case.    The weapon, in seven trials out of ten, is the most important thing in  it. By its means it can generally be demonstrated whether the shooting  was accidental or intentional--and whether or not the killing was in  self-defence.    Where this last plea is interposed it is usually made at once upon the  arrest, the accused explaining to the police that he fired only to  save his own life. In such a situation, where the killing is admitted,  practically the entire preparation will centre upon the most minute  tests to determine whether or not the shot was fired as the accused  claims that it was. The writer can recall at least a dozen cases in his  own experience where the story of the defendant, that the revolver was  discharged in a hand-to-hand struggle, was conclusively disproved by  experimenting with the weapon before the trial. There was one homicide  in which a bullet perforated a felt cap and penetrated the forehead of  the deceased. The defendant asserted that he was within three feet of  his victim when he fired, and that the other was about to strike him  with a bludgeon. A quantity of felt, of weight similar to that of  the cap, was procured and the revolver discharged at it from varying  distances. A microscopic examination showed that certain discolorations  around the bullet-hole (claimed by the defence to be burns made by the  powder) were, in fact, grease marks, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52819"],[0,"Defense of the Faith and the Saints (Volume 2 of 2) (#5)"],[1," has direct evidence in its support is the  allegation that Spaulding's rewritten story of the \"Manuscript Found\"  was, after Spaulding's death, in the possession of his widow. That  allegation rests upon the following statement of Spaulding's daughter,  Mrs. McKinstry, and the family belief in it without any additional  evidence upon which to base that belief. She says:    [Footnote 37: \"Hand Book on Mormonism,\" 3; \"Braden-Kelly Debate,\" 47 and  118.]        \"In 1816 my father died at Amity, Pa, and directly after his death      my mother and myself went to visit my mother's brother, William H.      Sabine, at Onondaga Valley, Onondaga County, N Y. * * * We carried      our personal effects with us, and one of these was an old trunk in      which my mother had placed my father's writings, which had been      preserved. I perfectly remember the appearance of this trunk, and      of looking at its contents. There were sermons and other papers,      and I saw a manuscript about an inch thick, closely written, tied      with some of the stories my father had written for me, one of which      he called the 'Frogs of Wyndham,' On the outside of this manuscript      were written the words, 'Manuscript Found.' I did not read it,      but looked through it and had it in my hands many times and saw      the names I had heard at Conneaut when my father read it to his      friends. I was about eleven years old at this time.\" [38]    [Footnote 38: \"New Light on Mormonism,\" 238; _Magazine of American  History,_ June, 1882; _Scribner's Monthly,_ August, 1880.]    The trunk remained at Sabine's until some time soon after 1820, [39]  while in 1823 Smith is said to have worked for Sabine as a teamster,  and almost certainly heard Spaulding's stories discussed as a matter  of family history. If the rewritten story of Spaulding's \"Manuscript  Found\" had been in the trunk at Sabine's while Smith worked there,  which is doubtful, he might have stolen it or copied it, though the  latter is made almost impossible by Smith's inability to write, [40] and  by his youth.    [Footnote 40: ii _Journal of Discourses,_ 197.]    Assuming, for the sake of argument, that it has been established that  the Book of Mormon is a plagiarism from 'Spaulding's rewritten story,  then we may still doubt that any of the above theories have sufficient  evidence to warrant their acceptance as established facts. These  various theories were all invented because of a supposed necessity of  accounting for the alleged presence of the rewritten \"Manuscript Found\"  in the trunk at Sabine's house after 1816, the date of Spaulding's  death. If the \"Manuscript Found\" was never there, the theories  constructed to explain that fact must fall.    That the first outline of the story which is now at Oberlin was then  in the trunk is certain, because Hurlburt, in 1834, found it there.  It is even possible that this first manuscript may at some time have  been labeled \"Manuscript Found.\" But was the rewritten story ever in  the trunk at Sabine's? If not, Smith could neither have stolen it  nor copied it, and, if never there, or if stolen by Smith, Hurlburt  could not have secured the rewritten manuscript and sold it to the  Mormons, as it has been charged he did do, while he gave only the first  manuscript to Howe, by whom he was employed to secure another. It may  not be amiss to here state that Howe never doubted Hurlburt's fidelity  in this matter. [41]    [Footnote 41: Under date of September 12, 1879, E.D. Howe wrote to  R. Patterson saying, \"I am very certain he (Hurlburt) never had any  Manuscript Found to sell to anybody. Whatever Mormons may say, I think  Hurlburt was perfectly honest in all his transactions here.\" (Taken  from a copy of the letter furnished by Patterson in his History of  Washington County, Pa.)]    The great preponderance of the evidence is against the allegation  that the second manuscript was ever in the trunk at Sabine's. Mrs.  McKinstry's evidence does not establish the identity of Spaulding's  rewritten \"Manuscript Found\" and the trunk manuscript. Such assertion  of identity is contradicted by that more satisfactory evidence to be  hereafter reviewed, and which shows that the rewritten manuscript  was stolen from the printing office before Spaulding's death; that  the latter suspected Rigdon of being the thief; the possession by  Rigdon of some such manuscript, and which, on one occasion, he  said had been written by Spaulding; Rigdon's advance knowledge of  the forthcoming Book of Mormon and his sudden conversion after its  appearance, and coupled with a very plain connection between Rigdon and  Smith through Parley P. Pratt as intermediary. These conclusions and  much of the evidence upon which they are based will contradict Mrs.  McKinstry's statement, if she meant by it to assert that the Sabine  trunk manuscript contained the names \"Mormon,\" \"Moroni,\" \"Lamanite,\"  and \"Nephi,\" which names, it will be shown, occur in and only in the  rewritten manuscript and the Book of Mormon.    In determining what weight to give to Mrs. McKinstry's statement as to  the contents of the trunk manuscript, several important facts must be  kept in mind. Mrs. McKinstry made this statement in 1880, when she was  seventy-four years of age. Her father died in October, 1816, very soon  after she and the trunk went to Sabine's at Hartwick, Onondaga County,  N.Y., and there she \"many times\" had it in her hand. At the earliest  date this must have been in the fore part of 1817, and she tells us  that she was about eleven years old at this time. If, in 1817, she  was eleven years old, then, in 1812, when she, with her parents, left  Conneaut for Pittsburg, she could not have exceeded six years of age.  At the age of seventy-four Mrs. McKinstry testified that when she was  eleven years old she looked through, but did not read, a manuscript,  yet saw the names she heard her father read at Conneaut, between 1810  and 1812, when she was from four to six years old. That this woman, at  seventy-four, should remember strange names, casually repeated in her  presence, before her sixth year, and those names wholly unrelated to  anything of direct consequence to her child life, is a feat of memory  too extraordinary to give her uncorroborated statement any weight, as  against valid contradictory conclusions drawn from established facts.    From 1834, when this alleged plagiarism was first publicly charged,  until the giving of Mrs. McKinstry's evidence in 1880, it had  necessarily been a matter of frequent discussion in the family circle  that the Book of Mormon was a plagiarism from her father's \"Manuscript  Found,\" and always the identity of names must have been spoken of as  the connecting link in the chain of evidence proving the plagiarism,  since that identity of names was the principal item of evidence as it  was first argued and published in 1834. With like uniformity, it was  firmly believed (but as a mere matter of inference, be it remembered)  that Hurlburt secured from the trunk that second manuscript, which  contained these names. Hence it would be inferred by the Spaulding  family that the trunk must have contained the names in question. This  association of ideas through an almost infinite number of recurrences  in mind became firmly impressed as a fixed fact during these forty-six  years of frequent repetition. It is not strange, therefore, if, after  these forty-six years, and with the failing memory of the age of  seventy-four, Mrs. McKinstry should have forgotten the real origin  of this association of ideas, and relate it back to the supposed  inspection of the trunk manuscript and the Conneaut readings, honestly  believing in her accuracy. In this conclusion Mormon authorities  concur. [42]    [Footnote 42: \"Myth of the Manuscript Found,\" 29.]    The only other statement which has ever been claimed as evidence  showing Spaulding's rewritten manuscript to have been in the Sabine  trunk is one by his widow, Matilda Spaulding-Davidson. She says that  before leaving Pittsburg for Amity, her husband's manuscript was  returned by the publishers. She seemingly remembers nothing of its  second submission while her husband resided at Amity, or else those  who wrote and signed her statement didn't see fit to mention it. \"The  Manuscript then [after Mr. Spaulding's death in 1816] fell into my  hands, and was preserved carefully. It has frequently been _examined by  my daughter,_ Mrs. McKinstry of Monson, Mass., with whom I now reside,  and by other friends.\" [43]    [Footnote 43: Boston _Daily Advertiser,_ copied in iii. _Millennial  Harbinger,_ May, 1839; \"Mormons' Own Book,\" 28; Boston _Recorder,_ May,  1839; \"Prophet of Palmyra,\" 417.]    By what follows, she makes it plain that the \"other friends\" referred  to are the Conneaut neighbors, whose examination was made prior  to 1812, and not at Sabine's. That she herself never examined the  Sabine trunk manuscript so as to speak upon the matter of identity of  manuscripts from personal knowledge, is apparent from several facts.  First, although writing an argumentative article, the strongest part  of which would have been her personal testimony as to some point of  identity between the trunk manuscript and the Book of Mormon, she  mentioned none such as being within her own knowledge. In the absence  of personal knowledge, she repeats as a justification of her belief  the evidence of Conneaut witnesses as to the identity of her husband's  \"Manuscript Found\" and the Book of Mormon. Even upon the question of  the existence of any manuscript in the Sabine trunk, she seems not to  rely upon any personal inspection of the trunk manuscript, but with an  apparent intention of putting the responsibility for her statement upon  the inspection of her daughter, Mrs. McKinstry, speaks of the latter's  inspection, while remaining silent as to whether or not she made any  inspection of her own.    The argumentative style and "]]]
