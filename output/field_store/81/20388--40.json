Everybody could be any kind of a Christian he wanted  to; there was perfect freedom in that matter.  But I confined public  religious teaching to the churches and the Sunday-schools, permitting  nothing of it in my other educational buildings.  I could have  given my own sect the preference and made everybody a Presbyterian  without any trouble, but that would have been to affront a law  of human nature: spiritual wants and instincts are as various in  the human family as are physical appetites, complexions, and  features, and a man is only at his best, morally, when he is  equipped with the religious garment whose color and shape and  size most nicely accommodate themselves to the spiritual complexion,  angularities, and stature of the individual who wears it; and,  besides, I was afraid of a united Church; it makes a mighty power,  the mightiest conceivable, and then when it by and by gets into  selfish hands, as it is always bound to do, it means death to  human liberty and paralysis to human thought.    All mines were royal property, and there were a good many of them.  They had formerly been worked as savages always work mines--holes  grubbed in the earth and the mineral brought up in sacks of hide by  hand, at the rate of a ton a day; but I had begun to put the mining  on a scientific basis as early as I could.    Yes, I had made pretty handsome progress when Sir Sagramor's  challenge struck me.    Four years rolled by--and then!  Well, you would never imagine  it in the world.  Unlimited power is the ideal thing when it is in  safe hands.  The despotism of heaven is the one absolutely perfect  government.  An earthly despotism would be the absolutely perfect  earthly government, if the conditions were the same, namely, the  despot the perfectest individual of the human race, and his lease  of life perpetual.  But as a perishable perfect man must die, and  leave his despotism in the hands of an imperfect successor, an  earthly despotism is not merely a bad form of government, it is  the worst form that is possible.    My works showed what a despot could do with the resources of  a kingdom at his command.  Unsuspected by this dark land, I had  the civilization of the nineteenth century booming under its very  nose!  It was fenced away from the public view, but there it was,  a gigantic and unassailable fact--and to be heard from, yet, if  I lived and had luck.  There it was, as sure a fact and as substantial  a fact as any serene volcano, standing innocent with its smokeless  summit in the blue sky and giving no sign of the rising hell in its  bowels.  My schools and churches were children four years before;  they were grown-up now; my shops of that day were vast factories  now; where I had a dozen trained men then, I had a thousand now;  where I had one brilliant expert then, I had fifty now.  I stood  with my hand on the cock, so to speak, ready to turn it on and  flood the midnight world with light at any moment.  But I was not  going to do the thing in that sudden way.  It was not my policy.  The people could not have stood it; and, moreover, I should have  had the Established Roman Catholic Church on my back in a minute.    No, I had been going cautiously all the while.  I had had confidential  agents trickling through the country some time, whose office was  to undermine knighthood by imperceptible degrees, and to gnaw  a little at this and that and the other superstition, and so prepare  the way gradually for a better order of things.  I was turning on  my light one-candle-power at a time, and meant to continue to do so.    I had scattered some branch schools secretly about the kingdom,  and they were doing very well.  I meant to work this racket more  and more, as time wore on, if nothing occurred to frighten me.  One of my deepest secrets was my West Point--my military academy.  I kept that most jealously out of sight; and I did the same with my  naval academy which I had established at a remote seaport.  Both  were prospering to my satisfaction.    Clarence was twenty-two now, and was my head executive, my right  hand.  He was a darling; he was equal to anything; there wasn't  anything he couldn't turn his hand to.  Of late I had been training  him for journalism, for the time seemed about right for a start  in the newspaper line; nothing big, but just a small weekly for  experimental circulation in my civilization-nurseries.  He took  to it like a duck; there was an editor concealed in him, sure.  Already he had doubled himself in one way; he talked sixth century  and wrote nineteenth.  His journalistic style was climbing,  steadily; it was already up to the back settlement Alabama mark,  and couldn't be told from the editorial output of that region  either by matter or flavor.    We had another large departure on hand, too.  This was a telegraph  and a telephone; our first venture in this line.  These wires were  for private service only, as yet, and must be kept private until  a riper day should come.  We had a gang of men on the road, working  mainly by night.  They were stringing ground wires; we were afraid  to put up poles, for they would attract too much inquiry.  Ground  wires were good enough, in both instances, for my wires were  protected by an insulation of my own invention which was perfect.  My men had orders to strike across country, avoiding roads, and  establishing connection with any considerable towns whose lights  betrayed their presence, and leaving experts in charge. Nobody  could tell you how to find any place in the kingdom, for nobody  ever went intentionally to any place, but only struck it by  accident in his wanderings, and then generally left it without  thinking to inquire what its name was.  At one time and another  we had sent out topographical expeditions to survey and map the  kingdom, but the priests had always interfered and raised trouble.  So we had given the thing up, for the present; it would be poor  wisdom to antagonize the Church.    As for the general condition of the country, it was as it had been  when I arrived in it, to all intents and purposes.  I had made  changes, but they were necessarily slight, and they were not  noticeable.  Thus far, I had not even meddled with taxation,  outside of the taxes which provided the royal revenues.  I had  systematized those, and put the service on an effective and  righteous basis.  As a result, these revenues were already quadrupled,  and yet the burden was so much more equably distributed than  before, that all the kingdom felt a sense of relief, and the praises  of my administration were hearty and general.    Personally, I struck an interruption, now, but I did not mind it,  it could not have happened at a better time.  Earlier it could  have annoyed me, but now everything was in good hands and swimming  right along.  The king had reminded me several times, of late, that  the postponement I had asked for, four years before, had about  run out now.  It was a hint that I ought to be starting out to seek  adventures and get up a reputation of a size to make me worthy  of the honor of breaking a lance with Sir Sagramor, who was still  out grailing, but was being hunted for by various relief expeditions,  and might be found any year, now.  So you see I was expecting  this interruption; it did not take me by surprise.        CHAPTER XI    THE YANKEE IN SEARCH OF ADVENTURES    There never was such a country for wandering liars; and they were  of both sexes.  Hardly a month went by without one of these tramps  arriving; and generally loaded with a tale about some princess or  other wanting help to get her out of some far-away castle where  she was held in captivity by a lawless scoundrel, usually a giant.  Now you would think that the first thing the king would do after  listening to such a novelette from an entire stranger, would be  to ask for credentials--yes, and a pointer or two as to locality  of castle, best route to it, and so on.  But nobody ever thought  of so simple and common-sense a thing at that.  No, everybody  swallowed these people's lies whole, and never asked a question  of any sort or about anything.  Well, one day when I was not  around, one of these people came along--it was a she one, this  time--and told a tale of the usual pattern.  Her mistress was  a captive in a vast and gloomy castle, along with forty-four other  young and beautiful girls, pretty much all of them princesses;  they had been languishing in that cruel captivity for twenty-six  years; the masters of the castle were three stupendous brothers,  each with four arms and one eye--the eye in the center of the  forehead, and as big as a fruit.  Sort of fruit not mentioned;  their usual slovenliness in statistics.    Would you believe it?  The king and the whole Round Table were  in raptures over this preposterous opportunity for adventure.  Every knight of the Table jumped for the chance, and begged for it;  but to their vexation and chagrin the king conferred it upon me,  who had not asked for it at all.    By an effort, I contained my joy when Clarence brought me the news.  But he--he could not contain his.  His mouth gushed delight and  gratitude in a steady discharge--delight in my good fortune,  gratitude to the king for this splendid mark of his favor for me.  He could keep neither his legs nor his body still, but pirouetted  about the place in an airy ecstasy of happiness.    On my side, I could have cursed the kindness that conferred upon  me this benefaction, but I kept my vexation under the surface  for policy's sake, and did what I could to let on to be glad.  Indeed, I _said_ I was glad.  And in a way it was true; I was as  glad as a person is when he is scalped.

This horse belongs in  the circus; he is born before his time.\"    \"I know him well, said Sir Uwaine, he is a passing good knight as  any is on live.\"    \"_On live_.  If you've got a fault in the world, Sandy, it is that  you are a shade too archaic.  But it isn't any matter.\"    \"--for I saw him once proved at a justs where many knights were  gathered, and that time there might no man withstand him.  Ah, said  Sir Gawaine, damsels, methinketh ye are to blame, for it is to  suppose he that hung that shield there will not be long therefrom,  and then may those knights match him on horseback, and that is  more your worship than thus; for I will abide no longer to see  a knight's shield dishonored.  And therewith Sir Uwaine and  Sir Gawaine departed a little from them, and then were they ware  where Sir Marhaus came riding on a great horse straight toward  them.  And when the twelve damsels saw Sir Marhaus they fled into  the turret as they were wild, so that some of them fell by the way.  Then the one of the knights of the tower dressed his shield, and  said on high, Sir Marhaus defend thee.  And so they ran together  that the knight brake his spear on Marhaus, and Sir Marhaus smote  him so hard that he brake his neck and the horse's back--\"    \"Well, that is just the trouble about this state of things,  it ruins so many horses.\"    \"That saw the other knight of the turret, and dressed him toward  Marhaus, and they went so eagerly together, that the knight of  the turret was soon smitten down, horse and man, stark dead--\"    \"_Another_ horse gone; I tell you it is a custom that ought to be  broken up.  I don't see how people with any feeling can applaud  and support it.\"        .   .   .   .    \"So these two knights came together with great random--\"    I saw that I had been asleep and missed a chapter, but I didn't  say anything.  I judged that the Irish knight was in trouble with  the visitors by this time, and this turned out to be the case.    \"--that Sir Uwaine smote Sir Marhaus that his spear brast in pieces  on the shield, and Sir Marhaus smote him so sore that horse and  man he bare to the earth, and hurt Sir Uwaine on the left side--\"    \"The truth is, Alisande, these archaics are a little _too_ simple;  the vocabulary is too limited, and so, by consequence, descriptions  suffer in the matter of variety; they run too much to level Saharas  of fact, and not enough to picturesque detail; this throws about  them a certain air of the monotonous; in fact the fights are all  alike: a couple of people come together with great random  --random is a good word, and so is exegesis, for that matter, and  so is holocaust, and defalcation, and usufruct and a hundred others,  but land! a body ought to discriminate--they come together with  great random, and a spear is brast, and one party brake his shield  and the other one goes down, horse and man, over his horse-tail  and brake his neck, and then the next candidate comes randoming in,  and brast _his_ spear, and the other man brast his shield, and down  _he_ goes, horse and man, over his horse-tail, and brake _his_ neck,  and then there's another elected, and another and another and still  another, till the material is all used up; and when you come to  figure up results, you can't tell one fight from another, nor who  whipped; and as a _picture_, of living, raging, roaring battle,  sho! why, it's pale and noiseless--just ghosts scuffling in a fog.  Dear me, what would this barren vocabulary get out of the mightiest  spectacle?--the burning of Rome in Nero's time, for instance?  Why, it would merely say, 'Town burned down; no insurance; boy  brast a window, fireman brake his neck!'  Why, _that_ ain't a picture!\"    It was a good deal of a lecture, I thought, but it didn't disturb  Sandy, didn't turn a feather; her steam soared steadily up again,  the minute I took off the lid:    \"Then Sir Marhaus turned his horse and rode toward Gawaine with  his spear.  And when Sir Gawaine saw that, he dressed his shield,  and they aventred their spears, and they came together with all  the might of their horses, that either knight smote other so hard  in the midst of their shields, but Sir Gawaine's spear brake--\"    \"I knew it would.\"    --\"but Sir Marhaus's spear held; and therewith Sir Gawaine and  his horse rushed down to the earth--\"    \"Just so--and brake his back.\"    --\"and lightly Sir Gawaine rose upon his feet and pulled out  his sword, and dressed him toward Sir Marhaus on foot, and therewith  either came unto other eagerly, and smote together with their  swords, that their shields flew in cantels, and they bruised their  helms and their hauberks, and wounded either other.  But Sir Gawaine,  fro it passed nine of the clock, waxed by the space of three hours  ever stronger and stronger and thrice his might was increased.  All this espied Sir Marhaus, and had great wonder how his might  increased, and so they wounded other passing sore; and then when  it was come noon--\"    The pelting sing-song of it carried me forward to scenes and  sounds of my boyhood days:    \"N-e-e-ew Haven! ten minutes for refreshments--knductr'll strike  the gong-bell two minutes before train leaves--passengers for  the Shore-line please take seats in the rear k'yar, this k'yar  don't go no furder--_ahh_-pls, _aw_-rnjz, b'_nan_ners,  _s-a-n-d_'ches, p--_op_-corn!\"    --\"and waxed past noon and drew toward evensong.  Sir Gawaine's  strength feebled and waxed passing faint, that unnethes he might  dure any longer, and Sir Marhaus was then bigger and bigger--\"    \"Which strained his armor, of course; and yet little would one  of these people mind a small thing like that.\"    --\"and so, Sir Knight, said Sir Marhaus, I have well felt that  ye are a passing good knight, and a marvelous man of might as ever  I felt any, while it lasteth, and our quarrels are not great, and  therefore it were a pity to do you hurt, for I feel you are passing  feeble.  Ah, said Sir Gawaine, gentle knight, ye say the word  that I should say.  And therewith they took off their helms and  either kissed other, and there they swore together either to love  other as brethren--\"    But I lost the thread there, and dozed off to slumber, thinking  about what a pity it was that men with such superb strength  --strength enabling them to stand up cased in cruelly burdensome  iron and drenched with perspiration, and hack and batter and bang  each other for six hours on a stretch--should not have been born  at a time when they could put it to some useful purpose.  Take  a jackass, for instance: a jackass has that kind of strength, and  puts it to a useful purpose, and is valuable to this world because  he is a jackass; but a nobleman is not valuable because he is  a jackass.  It is a mixture that is always ineffectual, and should  never have been attempted in the first place.  And yet, once you  start a mistake, the trouble is done and you never know what is  going to come of it.    When I came to myself again and began to listen, I perceived that  I had lost another chapter, and that Alisande had wandered a long  way off with her people.    \"And so they rode and came into a deep valley full of stones,  and thereby they saw a fair stream of water; above thereby was  the head of the stream, a fair fountain, and three damsels sitting  thereby. In this country, said Sir Marhaus, came never knight  since it was christened, but he found strange adventures--\"    \"This is not good form, Alisande.  Sir Marhaus the king's son of  Ireland talks like all the rest; you ought to give him a brogue,  or at least a characteristic expletive; by this means one would  recognize him as soon as he spoke, without his ever being named.  It is a common literary device with the great authors.  You should  make him say, 'In this country, be jabers, came never knight since  it was christened, but he found strange adventures, be jabers.'  You see how much better that sounds.\"    --\"came never knight but he found strange adventures, be jabers.  Of a truth it doth indeed, fair lord, albeit 'tis passing hard  to say, though peradventure that will not tarry but better speed  with usage.  And then they rode to the damsels, and either saluted  other, and the eldest had a garland of gold about her head, and  she was threescore winter of age or more--\"    \"The _damsel_ was?\"    \"Even so, dear lord--and her hair was white under the garland--\"    \"Celluloid teeth, nine dollars a set, as like as not--the loose-fit  kind, that go up and down like a portcullis when you eat, and  fall out when you laugh.\"    \"The second damsel was of thirty winter of age, with a circlet of  gold about her head.  The third damsel was but fifteen year of age--\"    Billows of thought came rolling over my soul, and the voice faded  out of my hearing!    Fifteen!  Break--my heart! oh, my lost darling!  Just her age  who was so gentle, and lovely, and all the world to me, and whom  I shall never see again!  How the thought of her carries me back  over wide seas of memory to a vague dim time, a happy time, so many,  many centuries hence, when I used to wake in the soft summer  mornings, out of sweet dreams of her, and say \"Hello, Central!\"  just to hear her dear voice come melting back to me with a  \"Hello, Hank!\" that was music of the spheres to my enchanted ear.  She got three dollars a week, but she was worth it.    I could not follow Alisande's further explanation of who our  captured knights were, now--I mean in case she should ever get  to explaining who they were.  My interest was gone, my thoughts  were far away, and sad.  By fitful glimpses of the drifting tale,  caught here and there and now and then, I merely noted in a vague  way that each of these three knights took one of these three damsels  up behind him on his horse, and one rode north, another east,  the other south, to seek adventures, and meet again and lie, after  year and day.  Year and day--and without baggage. "]]]
