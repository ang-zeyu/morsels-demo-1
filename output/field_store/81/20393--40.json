I really have nothing for you.\"    \"My orders is,\" said Friesshardt, \"to stand in this 'ere meadow and to  see as how all them what passes through it does obeisance to that there  hat. Them's Governor's orders, them is. So now.\"    \"My good fellow,\" said Tell, \"let me pass. I shall get cross, I know I  shall.\"    Shouts of encouragement from the crowd, who were waiting patiently for  the trouble to begin.    \"Go it, Tell!\" they cried. \"Don't stand talking to him. Hit him a  kick!\"    Friesshardt became angrier every minute.    \"My orders is,\" he said again, \"to arrest them as don't bow down to the  hat, and for two pins, young feller, I'll arrest you. So which is it to  be? Either you bow down to that there hat or you come along of me.\"    Tell pushed him aside, and walked on with his chin in the air. Walter  went with him, with his chin in the air.    WHACK!    A howl of dismay went up from the crowd as they saw Friesshardt raise  his pike and bring it down with all his force on Tell's head. The sound  of the blow went echoing through the meadow and up the hills and down  the valleys.    [Illustration: PLATE V]    \"Ow!\" cried Tell.    \"_Now_,\" thought the crowd, \"things must begin to get exciting.\"    Tell's first idea was that one of the larger mountains in the  neighbourhood had fallen on top of him. Then he thought that there must  have been an earthquake. Then it gradually dawned upon him that he had  been hit by a mere common soldier with a pike. Then he _was_  angry.    \"Look here!\" he began.    \"Look there!\" said Friesshardt, pointing to the cap.    [Illustration: PLATE VI]    \"You've hurt my head very much,\" said Tell. \"Feel the bump. If I hadn't  happened to have a particularly hard head I don't know what might not  have happened;\" and he raised his fist and hit Friesshardt; but as  Friesshardt was wearing a thick iron helmet the blow did not hurt him  very much.    But it had the effect of bringing the crowd to Tell's assistance. They  had been waiting all this time for him to begin the fighting, for  though they were very anxious to attack the soldiers, they did not like  to do so by themselves. They wanted a leader.    So when they saw Tell hit Friesshardt, they tucked up their sleeves,  grasped their sticks and cudgels more tightly, and began to run across  the meadow towards him.    Neither of the soldiers noticed this. Friesshardt was busy arguing with  Tell, and Leuthold was laughing at Friesshardt. So when the people came  swarming up with their sticks and cudgels they were taken by surprise.  But every soldier in the service of Gessler was as brave as a lion, and  Friesshardt and Leuthold were soon hitting back merrily, and making a  good many of the crowd wish that they had stayed at home. The two  soldiers were wearing armour, of course, so that it was difficult to  hurt them; but the crowd, who wore no armour, found that _they_  could get hurt very easily. Conrad Hunn, for instance, was attacking  Friesshardt, when the soldier happened to drop his pike. It fell on  Conrad's toe, and Conrad limped away, feeling that fighting was no fun  unless you had thick boots on.    And so for a time the soldiers had the best of the fight.          CHAPTER IX      For many minutes the fight raged furiously round the pole, and the  earth shook beneath the iron boots of Friesshardt and Leuthold as they  rushed about, striking out right and left with their fists and the  flats of their pikes. Seppi the cowboy (an ancestor, by the way, of  Buffalo Bill) went down before a tremendous blow by Friesshardt, and  Leuthold knocked Klaus von der Flue head over heels.    \"What you _want_\" said Arnold of Sewa, who had seen the beginning  of the fight from the window of his cottage and had hurried to join it,  and, as usual, to give advice to everybody--\"what you want here is  guile. That's what you want--guile, cunning. Not brute force, mind you.  It's no good rushing at a man in armour and hitting him. He only hits  you back. You should employ guile. Thus. Observe.\"    He had said these words standing on the outskirts of the crowd. He now  grasped his cudgel and began to steal slowly towards Friesshardt, who  had just given Werni the huntsman such a hit with his pike that the  sound of it was still echoing in the mountains, and was now busily  engaged in disposing of Jost Weiler. Arnold of Sewa crept stealthily  behind him, and was just about to bring his cudgel down on his head,  when Leuthold, catching sight of him, saved his comrade by driving his  pike with all his force into Arnold's side. Arnold said afterwards that  it completely took his breath away. He rolled over, and after being  trodden on by everybody for some minutes, got up and limped back to his  cottage, where he went straight to bed, and did not get up for two  days.    All this time Tell had been standing a little way off with his arms  folded, looking on. While it was a quarrel simply between himself and  Friesshardt he did not mind fighting. But when the crowd joined in he  felt that it was not fair to help so many men attack one, however badly  that one might have behaved.    He now saw that the time had come to put an end to the disturbance. He  drew an arrow from his quiver, placed it in his crossbow, and pointed  it at the hat. Friesshardt, seeing what he intended to do, uttered a  shout of horror and rushed to stop him. But at that moment somebody in  the crowd hit him so hard with a spade that his helmet was knocked over  his eyes, and before he could raise it again the deed was done. Through  the cap and through the pole and out at the other side sped the arrow.  And the first thing he saw when he opened his eyes was Tell standing  beside him twirling his moustache, while all around the crowd danced  and shouted and threw their caps into the air with joy.    [Illustration: PLATE VII]    [Illustration: PLATE VIII]    \"A mere trifle,\" said Tell modestly.    The crowd cheered again and again.    Friesshardt and Leuthold lay on the ground beside the pole, feeling  very sore and bruised, and thought that perhaps, on the whole, they had  better stay there. There was no knowing what the crowd might do after  this, if they began to fight again. So they lay on the ground and made  no attempt to interfere with the popular rejoicings. What they  _wanted_, as Arnold of Sewa might have said if he had been there,  was a few moments' complete rest. Leuthold's helmet had been hammered  with sticks until it was over his eyes and all out of shape, and  Friesshardt's was very little better. And they both felt just as if  they had been run over in the street by a horse and cart.    \"Tell!\" shouted the crowd. \"Hurrah for Tell! Good old Tell!\"    \"Tell's the boy!\" roared Ulric the smith. \"Not another man in  Switzerland could have made that shot.\"    \"No,\" shrieked everybody, \"not another!\"    \"Speech!\" cried someone from the edge of the crowd.    \"Speech! Speech! Tell, speech!\" Everybody took up the cry.    \"No, no,\" said Tell, blushing.    \"Go on, go on!\" shouted the crowd.    \"Oh, I couldn't,\" said Tell; \"I don't know what to say.\"    \"Anything will do. Speech! Speech!\"    Ulric the smith and Ruodi the fisherman hoisted Tell on to their  shoulders, and, having coughed once or twice, he said:    \"Gentlemen--\"    Cheers from the crowd.    \"Gentlemen,\" said Tell again, \"this is the proudest moment of my life.\"    More cheers.    \"I don't know what you want me to talk about. I have never made a  speech before. Excuse my emotion. This is the proudest moment of my  life. To-day is a great day for Switzerland. We have struck the first  blow of the revolution. Let us strike some more.\"    Shouts of \"Hear, hear!\" from the crowd, many of whom, misunderstanding  Tell's last remark, proceeded to hit Leuthold and Friesshardt, until  stopped by cries of \"Order!\" from Ulric the smith.    \"Gentlemen,\" continued Tell, \"the floodgates of revolution have been  opened. From this day they will stalk through the land burning to ashes  the slough of oppression which our tyrant Governor has erected in our  midst. I have only to add that this is the proudest moment of my life,  and----\"    He was interrupted by a frightened voice.    \"Look out, you chaps,\" said the voice; \"here comes the Governor!\"    Gessler, with a bodyguard of armed men, had entered the meadow, and was  galloping towards them.          CHAPTER X      Gessler came riding up on his brown horse, and the crowd melted away in  all directions, for there was no knowing what the Governor might not do  if he found them plotting. They were determined to rebel and to throw  off his tyrannous yoke, but they preferred to do it quietly and  comfortably, when he was nowhere near.    So they ran away to the edge of the meadow, and stood there in groups,  waiting to see what was going to happen. Not even Ulric the smith and  Ruodi the fisherman waited, though they knew quite well that Tell had  not nearly finished his speech. They set the orator down, and began to  walk away, trying to look as if they had been doing nothing in  particular, and were going to go on doing it--only somewhere else.    Tell was left standing alone in the middle of the meadow by the pole.  He scorned to run away like the others, but he did not at all like the  look of things. Gessler was a stern man, quick to punish any insult,  and there were two of his soldiers lying on the ground with their nice  armour all spoiled and dented, and his own cap on top of the pole had  an arrow right through the middle of it, and would never look the same  again, however much it might be patched. It seemed to Tell that there  was a bad time coming.    Gessler rode up, and reined in his horse.    \"Now then, now then, now then!\" he said, in his quick, abrupt way.  \"What's this? what's this? what's this?\"    (When a man repeats what he says three times, you can see that he is  not in a good temper.) "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/73"],[0,"The Red Badge of Courage: An Episode of the American Civil War (#5)"],[1,"down to think.  The odor of the peaceful  pines was in the men's nostrils.  The sound of monotonous axe blows  rang through the forest, and the insects, nodding upon their perches,  crooned like old women.  The youth returned to his theory of a blue  demonstration.    One gray dawn, however, he was kicked in the leg by the tall soldier,  and then, before he was entirely awake, he found himself running down a  wood road in the midst of men who were panting from the first effects  of speed.  His canteen banged rythmically upon his thigh, and his  haversack bobbed softly.  His musket bounced a trifle from his shoulder  at each stride and made his cap feel uncertain upon his head.    He could hear the men whisper jerky sentences:  \"Say--what's all  this--about?\"  \"What th' thunder--we--skedaddlin' this way fer?\"  \"Billie--keep off m' feet.  Yeh run--like a cow.\"  And the loud  soldier's shrill voice could be heard:  \"What th'devil they in sich a  hurry for?\"    The youth thought the damp fog of early morning moved from the rush of  a great body of troops.  From the distance came a sudden spatter of  firing.    He was bewildered.  As he ran with his comrades he strenuously tried to  think, but all he knew was that if he fell down those coming behind  would tread upon him.  All his faculties seemed to be needed to guide  him over and past obstructions.  He felt carried along by a mob.    The sun spread disclosing rays, and, one by one, regiments burst into  view like armed men just born of the earth.  The youth perceived that  the time had come.  He was about to be measured.  For a moment he felt  in the face of his great trial like a babe, and the flesh over his  heart seemed very thin.  He seized time to look about him calculatingly.    But he instantly saw that it would be impossible for him to escape from  the regiment.  It inclosed him.  And there were iron laws of tradition  and law on four sides.  He was in a moving box.    As he perceived this fact it occurred to him that he had never wished  to come to the war.  He had not enlisted of his free will.  He had been  dragged by the merciless government.  And now they were taking him out  to be slaughtered.    The regiment slid down a bank and wallowed across a little stream.  The  mournful current moved slowly on, and from the water, shaded black,  some white bubble eyes looked at the men.    As they climbed the hill on the farther side artillery began to boom.  Here the youth forgot many things as he felt a sudden impulse of  curiosity.  He scrambled up the bank with a speed that could not be  exceeded by a bloodthirsty man.    He expected a battle scene.    There were some little fields girted and squeezed by a forest.  Spread  over the grass and in among the tree trunks, he could see knots and  waving lines of skirmishers who were running hither and thither and  firing at the landscape.  A dark battle line lay upon a sunstruck  clearing that gleamed orange color.  A flag fluttered.    Other regiments floundered up the bank.  The brigade was formed in line  of battle, and after a pause started slowly through the woods in the  rear of the receding skirmishers, who were continually melting into the  scene to appear again farther on.  They were always busy as bees,  deeply absorbed in their little combats.    The youth tried to observe everything.  He did not use care to avoid  trees and branches, and his forgotten feet were constantly knocking  against stones or getting entangled in briers.  He was aware that these  battalions with their commotions were woven red and startling into the  gentle fabric of softened greens and browns.  It looked to be a wrong  place for a battle field.    The skirmishers in advance fascinated him.  Their shots into thickets  and at distant and prominent trees spoke to him of tragedies--hidden,  mysterious, solemn.    Once the line encountered the body of a dead soldier.  He lay upon his  back staring at the sky.  He was dressed in an awkward suit of  yellowish brown.  The youth could see that the soles of his shoes had  been worn to the thinness of writing paper, and from a great rent in  one the dead foot projected piteously.  And it was as if fate had  betrayed the soldier.  In death it exposed to his enemies that poverty  which in life he had perhaps concealed from his friends.    The ranks opened covertly to avoid the corpse.  The invulnerable dead  man forced a way for himself.  The youth looked keenly at the ashen  face.  The wind raised the tawny beard.  It moved as if a hand were  stroking it.  He vaguely desired to walk around and around the body and  stare; the impulse of the living to try to read in dead eyes the answer  to the Question.    During the march the ardor which the youth had acquired when out of  view of the field rapidly faded to nothing.  His curiosity was quite  easily satisfied.  If an intense scene had caught him with its wild  swing as he came to the top of the bank, he might have gone  roaring on.  This advance upon Nature was too calm.  He had opportunity  to reflect.  He had time in which to wonder about himself and to  attempt to probe his sensations.    Absurd ideas took hold upon him.  He thought that he did not relish the  landscape.  It threatened him.  A coldness swept over his back, and it  is true that his trousers felt to him that they were no fit for his  legs at all.    A house standing placidly in distant fields had to him an ominous look.  The shadows of the woods were formidable.  He was certain that in this  vista there lurked fierce-eyed hosts.  The swift thought came to him  that the generals did not know what they were about.  It was all a  trap.  Suddenly those close forests would bristle with rifle barrels.  Ironlike brigades would appear in the rear.  They were all going to be  sacrificed.  The generals were stupids.  The enemy would presently  swallow the whole command.  He glared about him, expecting to see the  stealthy approach of his death.    He thought that he must break from the ranks and harangue his comrades.  They must not all be killed like pigs; and he was sure it would come to  pass unless they were informed of these dangers.  The generals were  idiots to send them marching into a regular pen.  There was but one  pair of eyes in the corps.  He would step forth and make a speech.  Shrill and passionate words came to his lips.    The line, broken into moving fragments by the ground, went calmly on  through fields and woods.  The youth looked at the men nearest him, and  saw, for the most part, expressions of deep interest, as if they were  investigating something that had fascinated them.  One or two stepped  with overvaliant airs as if they were already plunged into war.  Others  walked as upon thin ice.  The greater part of the untested men appeared  quiet and absorbed.  They were going to look at war, the red  animal--war, the blood-swollen god.  And they were deeply engrossed in  this march.    As he looked the youth gripped his outcry at his throat.  He saw that  even if the men were tottering with fear they would laugh at his  warning.  They would jeer him, and, if practicable, pelt him with  missiles.  Admitting that he might be wrong, a frenzied declamation of  the kind would turn him into a worm.    He assumed, then, the demeanor of one who knows that he is doomed alone  to unwritten responsibilities.  He lagged, with tragic glances at the  sky.    He was surprised presently by the young lieutenant of his company, who  began heartily to beat him with a sword, calling out in a loud and  insolent voice:  \"Come, young man, get up into ranks there.  No  skulking 'll do here.\"  He mended his pace with suitable haste.  And he  hated the lieutenant, who had no appreciation of fine minds.  He was a  mere brute.    After a time the brigade was halted in the cathedral light of a forest.  The busy skirmishers were still popping.  Through the aisles of the  wood could be seen the floating smoke from their rifles.  Sometimes it  went up in little balls, white and compact.    During this halt many men in the regiment began erecting tiny hills in  front of them.  They used stones sticks, earth, and anything they  thought might turn a bullet.  Some built comparatively large ones,  while others seems content with little ones.    This procedure caused a discussion among the men.  Some wished to fight  like duelists, believing it to be correct to stand erect and be, from  their feet to their foreheads, a mark.  They said they scorned the  devices of the cautious.  But the others scoffed in reply, and pointed  to the veterans on the flanks who were digging at the ground like  terriers.  In a short time there was quite a barricade along the  regimental fronts.  Directly, however, they were ordered to withdraw  from that place.    This astounded the youth.  He forgot his stewing over the advance  movement.  \"Well, then, what did they march us out here for?\" he  demanded of the tall soldier.  The latter with calm faith began a heavy  explanation, although he had been compelled to leave a little  protection of stones and dirt to which he had devoted much care and  skill.    When the regiment was aligned in another position each man's regard for  his safety caused another line of small intrenchments.  They ate their  noon meal behind a third one.  They were moved from this one also.  They were marched from place to place with apparent aimlessness.    The youth had been taught that a man became another thing in battle.  He saw his salvation in such a change.  Hence this waiting was an  ordeal to him.  He was in a fever of impatience.  He considered that  there was denoted a lack of purpose on the part of the generals.  He  began to complain to the tall soldier.  \"I can't stand this much  longer,\" he cried.  \"I don't see what good it does to make us wear out  our legs for nothin'.\"  He wished to return to camp, knowing that this  affair was a blue demonstration; or else to go into "]]]
