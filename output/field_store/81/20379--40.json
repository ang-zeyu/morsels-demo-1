[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7050"],[0,"The Swoop! or, How Clarence Saved England: A Tale of the Great Invasion (#5)"],[1,"\"The Merry  Widow\" had taken on a new lease of life. Selfridge's, abandoning its  policy of caution, had advertised to the extent of a quarter of a  column in two weekly papers.    Now the Young Turks were back at school in Constantinople, shuffling  their feet and throwing ink pellets at one another; Raisuli, home again  in the old mountains, was working up the kidnapping business, which had  fallen off sadly in his absence under the charge of an incompetent  _locum tenens_; and the Chinese, the Bollygollans, and the troops  of the Mad Mullah were enduring the miseries of sea-sickness out in  mid-ocean.    The Swiss army had also gone home, in order to be in time for the  winter hotel season. There only remained the Germans, the Russians, and  the troops of Monaco.           *        *        *        *        *    In the camp of the Boy Scouts a vast activity prevailed.    Few of London's millions realise how tremendous and far-reaching an  association the Boy Scouts are. It will be news to the Man in the  Street to learn that, with the possible exception of the Black Hand,  the Scouts are perhaps the most carefully-organised secret society in  the world.    Their ramifications extend through the length and breadth of England.  The boys you see parading the streets with hockey-sticks are but a  small section, the aristocrats of the Society. Every boy in England,  and many a man, is in the pay of the association. Their funds are  practically unlimited. By the oath of initiation which he takes on  joining, every boy is compelled to pay into the common coffers a  percentage of his pocket-money or his salary. When you drop his weekly  three and sixpence into the hand of your office-boy on Saturday,  possibly you fancy he takes it home to mother. He doesn't. He spend  two-and-six on Woodbines. The other shilling goes into the treasury of  the Boy Scouts. When you visit your nephew at Eton, and tip him five  pounds or whatever it is, does he spend it at the sock-shop?  Apparently, yes. In reality, a quarter reaches the common fund.    Take another case, to show the Boy Scouts' power. You are a City  merchant, and, arriving at the office one morning in a bad temper, you  proceed to cure yourself by taking it out of the office-boy. He says  nothing, apparently does nothing. But that evening, as you are going  home in the Tube, a burly working-man treads heavily on your gouty  foot. In Ladbroke Grove a passing hansom splashes you with mud.  Reaching home, you find that the cat has been at the cold chicken and  the butler has given notice. You do not connect these things, but they  are all alike the results of your unjust behaviour to your office-boy  in the morning. Or, meeting a ragged little matchseller, you pat his  head and give him six-pence. Next day an anonymous present of champagne  arrives at your address.    Terrible in their wrath, the Boy Scouts never forget kindness.           *       *       *       *       *    The whistle of a Striped Iguanodon sounded softly in the darkness. The  sentry, who was pacing to and fro before the camp-fire, halted, and  peered into the night. As he peered, he uttered the plaintive note of a  zebra calling to its mate.    A voice from the darkness said, \"Een gonyama-gonyama.\"    \"Invooboo,\" replied the sentry argumentatively \"Yah bo! Yah bo!  Invooboo.\"    An indistinct figure moved forward.    \"Who goes there?\"    \"A friend.\"    \"Advance, friend, and give the countersign.\"    \"Remember Mafeking, and death to Injuns.\"    \"Pass friend! All's well.\"    The figure walked on into the firelight. The sentry started; then  saluted and stood to attention. On his face was a worshipping look of  admiration and awe, such as some young soldier of the Grande Armee  might have worn on seeing Napoleon; for the newcomer was Clarence  Chugwater.    \"Your name?\" said Clarence, eyeing the sturdy young warrior.    \"Private William Buggins, sir.\"    \"You watch well, Private Buggins. England has need of such as you.\"    He pinched the young Scout's ear tolerantly. The sentry flushed with  pleasure.    \"My orders have been carried out?\" said Clarence.    \"Yes, sir. The patrols are all here.\"    \"Enumerate them.\"    \"The Chinchilla Kittens, the Bongos, the Zebras, the Iguanodons, the  Welsh Rabbits, the Snapping Turtles, and a half-patrol of the 33rd  London Gazekas, sir.\"    Clarence nodded.    \"'Tis well,\" he said. \"What are they doing?\"    \"Some of them are acting a Scout's play, sir; some are doing Cone  Exercises; one or two are practising deep breathing; and the rest are  dancing an Old English Morris Dance.\"    Clarence nodded.    \"They could not be better employed. Inform them that I have arrived and  would address them.\"    The sentry saluted.    Standing in an attitude of deep thought, with his feet apart, his hands  clasped behind him, and his chin sunk upon his breast, Clarence made a  singularly impressive picture. He had left his Essex home three weeks  before, on the expiration of his ten days' holiday, to return to his  post of junior sub-reporter on the staff of a leading London evening  paper. It was really only at night now that he got any time to himself.  During the day his time was his paper's, and he was compelled to spend  the weary hours reading off results of races and other sporting items  on the tape-machine. It was only at 6 p.m. that he could begin to  devote himself to the service of his country.    The Scouts had assembled now, and were standing, keen and alert, ready  to do Clarence's bidding.    Clarence returned their salute moodily.    \"Scout-master Wagstaff,\" he said.    The Scout-master, the leader of the troop formed by the various  patrols, stepped forward.    \"Let the war-dance commence.\"    Clarence watched the evolutions absently. His heart was ill-attuned to  dances. But the thing had to be done, so it was as well to get it over.  When the last movement had been completed, he raised his hand.    \"Men,\" he said, in his clear, penetrating alto, \"although you have not  the same facilities as myself for hearing the latest news, you are all,  by this time, doubtless aware that this England of ours lies 'neath the  proud foot of a conqueror. It is for us to save her. (Cheers, and a  voice \"Invooboo!\") I would call on you here and now to seize your  hockey-sticks and rush upon the invader, were it not, alas! that such  an action would merely result in your destruction. At present the  invader is too strong. We must wait; and something tells me that we  shall not have to wait long. (Applause.) Jealousy is beginning to  spring up between the Russians and the Germans. It will be our task to  aggravate this feeling. With our perfect organisation this should be  easy. Sooner or later this smouldering jealousy is going to burst into  flame. Any day now,\" he proceeded, warming as he spoke, \"there may be  the dickens of a dust-up between these Johnnies, and then we've got 'em  where the hair's short. See what I mean, you chaps? It's like this. Any  moment they may start scrapping and chaw each other up, and then we'll  simply sail in and knock what's left endways.\"    A shout of applause went up from the assembled scouts.    \"What I am anxious to impress upon you men,\" concluded Clarence, in  more measured tones, \"is that our hour approaches. England looks to us,  and it is for us to see that she does not look in vain. Sedulously  feeding the growing flame of animosity between the component parts of  the invading horde, we may contrive to bring about that actual  disruption. Till that day, see to it that you prepare yourselves for  war. Men, I have finished.\"    \"What the Chief Scout means,\" said Scout-master Wagstaff, \"is no  rotting about and all that sort of rot. Jolly well keep yourselves fit,  and then, when the time comes, we'll give these Russian and German  blighters about the biggest hiding they've ever heard of. Follow the  idea? Very well, then. Mind you don't go mucking the show up.\"    \"Een gonyama-gonyama!\" shouted the new thoroughly roused troops.  \"Invooboo! Yah bo! Yah bo! Invooboo!\"    The voice of Young England--of Young England alert and at its post!          Chapter 2    AN IMPORTANT ENGAGEMENT      Historians, when they come to deal with the opening years of the  twentieth century, will probably call this the Music-Hall Age. At the  time of the great invasion the music-halls dominated England. Every  town and every suburb had its Hall, most of them more than one. The  public appetite for sight-seeing had to be satisfied somehow, and the  music-hall provided the easiest way of doing it. The Halls formed a  common place on which the celebrity and the ordinary man could meet. If  an impulsive gentleman slew his grandmother with a coal-hammer, only a  small portion of the public could gaze upon his pleasing features at  the Old Bailey. To enable the rest to enjoy the intellectual treat, it  was necessary to engage him, at enormous expense, to appear at a  music-hall. There, if he happened to be acquitted, he would come on the  stage, preceded by an asthmatic introducer, and beam affably at the  public for ten minutes, speaking at intervals in a totally inaudible  voice, and then retire; to be followed by some enterprising lady who  had endeavoured, unsuccessfully, to solve the problem of living at the  rate of ten thousand a year on an income of nothing, or who had  performed some other similarly brainy feat.    It was not till the middle of September that anyone conceived what one  would have thought the obvious idea of offering music-hall engagements  to the invading generals.    The first man to think of it was Solly Quhayne, the rising young agent.  Solly was the son of Abraham Cohen, an eminent agent of the Victorian  era. His brothers, Abe Kern, Benjamin Colquhoun, Jack Coyne, and Barney  Cowan had gravitated to the City; but Solly had carried on the old  business, and was making a big name for himself. It was Solly who had  met Blinky"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/706"],[0,"The Amateur Cracksman (#5)"],[1,"a decent living were all going begging  together?  Of course it's very wrong, but we can't all be moralists,  and the distribution of wealth is very wrong to begin with.  Besides,  you're not at it all the time.  I'm sick of quoting Gilbert's lines to  myself, but they're profoundly true.  I only wonder if you'll like the  life as much as I do!\"    \"Like it?\" I cried out.  \"Not I!  It's no life for me.  Once is enough!\"    \"You wouldn't give me a hand another time?\"    \"Don't ask me, Raffles.  Don't ask me, for God's sake!\"    \"Yet you said you would do anything for me! You asked me to name my  crime!  But I knew at the time you didn't mean it; you didn't go back  on me to-night, and that ought to satisfy me, goodness knows!  I  suppose I'm ungrateful, and unreasonable, and all that.  I ought to let  it end at this.  But you're the very man for me, Bunny, the--very--man!  Just think how we got through to-night.  Not a scratch--not a hitch!  There's nothing very terrible in it, you see; there never would be,  while we worked together.\"    He was standing in front of me with a hand on either shoulder; he was  smiling as he knew so well how to smile.  I turned on my heel, planted  my elbows on the chimney-piece, and my burning head between my hands.  Next instant a still heartier hand had fallen on my back.    \"All right, my boy!  You are quite right and I'm worse than wrong.  I'll never ask it again. Go, if you want to, and come again about  mid-day for the cash.  There was no bargain; but, of course, I'll get  you out of your scrape--especially after the way you've stood by me  to-night.\"    I was round again with my blood on fire.    \"I'll do it again,\" I said, through my teeth.    He shook his head.  \"Not you,\" he said, smiling quite good-humoredly on  my insane enthusiasm.    \"I will,\" I cried with an oath.  \"I'll lend you a hand as often as you  like!  What does it matter now?  I've been in it once.  I'll be in it  again.  I've gone to the devil anyhow.  I can't go back, and wouldn't  if I could.  Nothing matters another rap!  When you want me, I'm your  man!\"    And that is how Raffles and I joined felonious forces on the Ides of  March.        A COSTUME PIECE    London was just then talking of one whose name is already a name and  nothing more. Reuben Rosenthall had made his millions on the diamond  fields of South Africa, and had come home to enjoy them according to  his lights; how he went to work will scarcely be forgotten by any  reader of the halfpenny evening papers, which revelled in endless  anecdotes of his original indigence and present prodigality, varied  with interesting particulars of the extraordinary establishment which  the millionaire set up in St.  John's Wood.  Here he kept a retinue of  Kaffirs, who were literally his slaves; and hence he would sally, with  enormous diamonds in his shirt and on his finger, in the convoy of a  prize-fighter of heinous repute, who was not, however, by any means the  worst element in the Rosenthall mÃ©lange.  So said common gossip; but  the fact was sufficiently established by the interference of the police  on at least one occasion, followed by certain magisterial proceedings  which were reported with justifiable gusto and huge headlines in the  newspapers aforesaid.    And this was all one knew of Reuben Rosenthall up to the time when the  Old Bohemian Club, having fallen on evil days, found it worth its while  to organize a great dinner in honor of so wealthy an exponent of the  club's principles.  I was not at the banquet myself, but a member took  Raffles, who told me all about it that very night.    \"Most extraordinary show I ever went to in my life,\" said he.  \"As for  the man himself--well, I was prepared for something grotesque, but the  fellow fairly took my breath away.  To begin with, he's the most  astounding brute to look at, well over six feet, with a chest like a  barrel, and a great hook-nose, and the reddest hair and whiskers you  ever saw.  Drank like a fire-engine, but only got drunk enough to make  us a speech that I wouldn't have missed for ten pounds.  I'm only sorry  you weren't there, too, Bunny, old chap.\"    I began to be sorry myself, for Raffles was anything but an excitable  person, and never had I seen him so excited before.  Had he been  following Rosenthall's example?  His coming to my rooms at midnight,  merely to tell me about his dinner, was in itself enough to excuse a  suspicion which was certainly at variance with my knowledge of A. J.  Raffles.    \"What did he say?\" I inquired mechanically, divining some subtler  explanation of this visit, and wondering what on earth it could be.    \"Say?\" cried Raffles.  \"What did he not say!  He boasted of his rise,  he bragged of his riches, and he blackguarded society for taking him up  for his money and dropping him out of sheer pique and jealousy because  he had so much.  He mentioned names, too, with the most charming  freedom, and swore he was as good a man as the Old Country had to  show--PACE the Old Bohemians. To prove it he pointed to a great diamond  in the middle of his shirt-front with a little finger loaded with  another just like it: which of our bloated princes could show a pair  like that?  As a matter of fact, they seemed quite wonderful stones,  with a curious purple gleam to them that must mean a pot of money.  But  old Rosenthall swore he wouldn't take fifty thousand pounds for the  two, and wanted to know where the other man was who went about with  twenty-five thousand in his shirt-front and another twenty-five on his  little finger. He didn't exist.  If he did, he wouldn't have the pluck  to wear them.  But _he_ had--he'd tell us why. And before you could say  Jack Robinson he had whipped out a whacking great revolver!\"    \"Not at the table?\"    \"At the table!  In the middle of his speech!  But it was nothing to  what he wanted to do.  He actually wanted us to let him write his name  in bullets on the opposite wall, to show us why he wasn't afraid to go  about in all his diamonds!  That brute Purvis, the prize-fighter, who  is his paid bully, had to bully his master before he could be persuaded  out of it.  There was quite a panic for the moment; one fellow was  saying his prayers under the table, and the waiters bolted to a man.\"    \"What a grotesque scene!\"    \"Grotesque enough, but I rather wish they had let him go the whole hog  and blaze away.  He was as keen as knives to show us how he could take  care of his purple diamonds; and, do you know, Bunny, _I_ was as keen  as knives to see.\"    And Raffles leaned towards me with a sly, slow smile that made the  hidden meaning of his visit only too plain to me at last.    \"So you think of having a try for his diamonds yourself?\"    He shrugged his shoulders.    \"It is horribly obvious, I admit.  But--yes, I have set my heart upon  them!  To be quite frank, I have had them on my conscience for some  time; one couldn't hear so much of the man, and his prize-fighter, and  his diamonds, without feeling it a kind of duty to have a go for them;  but when it comes to brandishing a revolver and practically challenging  the world, the thing becomes inevitable.  It is simply thrust upon one.  I was fated to hear that challenge, Bunny, and I, for one, must take it  up.  I was only sorry I couldn't get on my hind legs and say so then  and there.\"    \"Well,\" I said, \"I don't see the necessity as things are with us; but,  of course, I'm your man.\"    My tone may have been half-hearted.  I did my best to make it  otherwise.  But it was barely a month since our Bond Street exploit,  and we certainly could have afforded to behave ourselves for some time  to come.  We had been getting along so nicely: by his advice I had  scribbled a thing or two; inspired by Raffles, I had even done an  article on our own jewel robbery; and for the moment I was quite  satisfied with this sort of adventure.  I thought we ought to know when  we were well off, and could see no point in our running fresh risks  before we were obliged.  On the other hand, I was anxious not to show  the least disposition to break the pledge that I had given a month ago.  But it was not on my manifest disinclination that Raffles fastened.    \"Necessity, my dear Bunny?  Does the writer only write when the wolf is  at the door?  Does the painter paint for bread alone?  Must you and I  be DRIVEN to crime like Tom of Bow and Dick of Whitechapel?  You pain  me, my dear chap; you needn't laugh, because you do.  Art for art's  sake is a vile catchword, but I confess it appeals to me. In this case  my motives are absolutely pure, for I doubt if we shall ever be able to  dispose of such peculiar stones.  But if I don't have a try for  them--after to-night--I shall never be able to hold up my head again.\"    His eye twinkled, but it glittered, too.    \"We shall have our work cut out,\" was all I said.    \"And do you suppose I should be keen on it if we hadn't?\" cried  Raffles.  \"My dear fellow, I would rob St. Paul's Cathedral if I could,  but I could no more scoop a till when the shopwalker wasn't looking  than I could bag the apples out of an old woman's basket.  Even that  little business last month was a sordid affair, but it was necessary,  and I think its strategy redeemed it to some extent. Now there's some  credit, and more sport, in going where they boast they're on their  guard against you.  The Bank of England, for example, is the ideal  crib; but that would need half a dozen of us with years to give to the  job; and meanwhile Reuben Rosenthall is high enough game for you and  me.  We know he's armed.  We know how Billy Purvis can fight.  It'll be  no soft thing, I grant you. But what of that, my good Bunny--what of  that?  A man's reach must exceed his grasp, dear boy, or what the  dickens is a heaven for?\"    \"I would rather we didn't exceed ours just yet,\" I answered laughing,  for his spirit was irresistible, and the plan was growing upon me,  despite my"]]]
