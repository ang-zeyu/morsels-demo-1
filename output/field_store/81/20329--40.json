[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5994"],[0,"Our Nervous Friends â€” Illustrating the Mastery of Nervousness (#5)"],[1," she was eighty. She possessed qualities which with the help of a  normal husband would have been a wholesome heritage to the children;  but it was a home of double standards, certainly so in the training of  Lena, who had never failed, when her father was home, to get the  things her mother had denied her in his absence. She was thirteen when  he died; at fifteen then followed her two most normal years. The  accident occurred which, was to prove fateful for her life, and  through hers, for others.    Lena was a good roller-skater, but was upset one night, at the rink,  by an awkward novice and fell sharply on the back of her head. She was  taken home unconscious and was afterward delirious, not being herself  until noon the next day, when she found beside her an anxious mother  who for several days continued ministering to her daughter's every  wish. Three months later she set her heart on a certain dress in a  near-by shop window; her mother said it was too old for her, and cost  too much. Day after day passed and the dress remained there, more to  be desired each time she saw it. The Sunday-school picnic was only a  week off. She made another appeal at the supper table; her sister  unwisely interjected a sympathetic \"too bad.\" The emphasis of the  mother's \"No\" sounded like a \"settler,\" but just then things went dark  for Lena. She grasped her head and apparently was about to fall--her  face twitched and her body jerked convulsively. The mother lost her  nerve, and feeling that her harshness had brought back the \"brain  symptoms\" which followed the skating accident, spent the night in  ministrations--and hanging at the foot of Lena's bed, when she was  herself next morning, was the coveted dress. To those who know, the  mental processes were simple; strong desire, an implacable mother,  save when touched by maternal fear, the association in the girl's mind  of a relationship between her accident and her mother's compliance, a  remoter association of her illness at seven with her father's years of  free giving. What was to restrain her jerkings and twitchings and  meanings? Many of these reactions were taking place in the semi-  mysterious laboratory of her subconscious self; but it was the  beginning of a life of periodic outbreaks through which she had  practically never failed to secure what she desired. To the end of her  good mother's life, Lena remained the only one who could change her  \"no\" to \"yes.\"    The elder sister was a more normal girl. She studied stenography and  soon married a promising young man. They had two children. He made a  trip down the coast and died of yellow fever. The wife was much  depressed and spent a bad year and most of the insurance money,  getting adjusted. Then the Galveston storm with its harvest of death  and miraculous escapes--the mother was taken, the two children left.  Meanwhile Lena had finished high school, had taken a year in the  Normal and secured a community school to teach, near Houston. She was  now eighteen, her face was interesting, some of the features were  fine. Her bluish-gray eyes could be particularly appealing; there was  much mobility of expression; a wealth of slightly curling, light-  chestnut hair was always stylishly arranged; in fact, her whole make-  up caused the young fellows to speak of her as the \"cityfied school-  marm.\" Then came the merchant's son and all was going well, so well  that they both pledged their love and plighted their troth. The  temporary distraction of her lover's attention, deflected by the  visiting brunette in silks, an inadvertently broken appointment (the  train was late and he could not help it), and the first attack of the  \"jerks\" among strangers is recorded. They hastily summoned old Jake  Platt's son, just fresh from medical college, who, helpless with this  suffering bit of femininity, supplied in attention and practical  nursing what he lacked in medical discernment and skill, to the end  that one engagement was broken and another formed in a fortnight. Old  Jake had some money; the young doctor was starting in well, and needed  a wife; she was still jealous, and young Dr. Platt got a wife, who  molded his future as the modeler does his clay.    Within the first month the bride had another attack. They had planned  a trip to Houston to do some shopping and to attend the theater. The  doctor-husband was delayed on a case and found his young bride in the  throes of another nervous storm when he reached home, nor did the  symptoms entirely abate until he had promised her that he would always  come at once, no matter what other duties he might have, when she  needed him. By this promise he handicapped his future success as a  physician and did all that devoted ignorance could do to make certain  a periodic repetition of the convulsive seizures. This was but the  first of a series of concessions which involved his professional,  social and financial future, which her \"infirmity\" exacted of him as  the years passed. Later old Jake died and the doctor's share of his  big farms was an opportune help. But Mrs. Platt had a certain far-  reaching ambition; therefore, they soon moved to Houston. He would  have done well where he started; his education, his medical equipment,  his personality were certain to limit his progress in a city. The  doctor's wife was superficially bright, capable of adapting herself  with distinct charm to those she admired. She formed intense likes and  dislikes--while often impulsively kind-hearted, she could cling to  vindictive abuse for months. Here was a woman who proved very useful  on church committees, in societies, in Sunday-school, who worked  effectively in the Civic Club. She sang fairly well naturally, of  course \"adored music\" and was an efficient enthusiastic worker when  interested. But Lena Platt was never able to work when not interested.  Periodically her \"fearful nervous spells\" would interfere with all  duties. The doctor was absolutely subsidized. Had any other  attractions appealed to him, his wife's early evidences of implacable  jealousy would have proven a sure antidote. He was an unconscious  slave. Her nervousness expressed itself toward him in other terms than  convulsively. She had a tongue which from time to time blistered the  poor man. He would never talk back, fearful as he ever was of bringing  on one of those storms which, in his inadequate medical knowledge,  were as mysterious and ominous as epileptic attacks.    For years the absence of children in the home was a sorrow from which  much affecting sentimentality evolved, being as well the pathetic  cause for days of sickness, when outside interests were less  attractive to this artful sufferer than the attentions elicited by her  illness. Then out of the great gulf surged the heroic Galveston  tragedy, and the two orphan children came to fill the idealized want.  At first they received an abundance of impulsive loving, but unhappily  one day, a few months after they came, the foster-mother overheard the  elder girl make an unfavorable comparison between her and the real  mother; and for years distinctions were made--the younger being always  favored, the unfortunate, older child living half-terrorized, never  knowing when angry, unfair words would assail her.    Lena Platt had confided to several of her bosom friends the tragedy of  her unequal marriage and that she knew she would yet find a \"soul  mate.\" There was a Choral Society in Houston one winter, and following  a few gratuitous compliments from the dapper young director, she  decided she had found it. He left in the spring and this dream faded.  A few months later the new minister's incautious exaggeration that \"he  didn't know how he could run the church without her\" came near  resulting in trouble, for some of the good sisters unkindly questioned  the quality of her sudden excessive devotion and religious zeal. Mrs.  Platt was not vicious, but she craved excitement; hers was a life of  constantly forming new plans. Attention from any source was sweet and  from those of prominence it was nectar. Things were pretty bad in the  doctor's home after the preacher episode, and she was finally  persuaded to let her husband call in another physician. He was very  nice to her, and while he never pretended to understand her case, his  medicine and advice benefited her tremendously and she went nearly a  year without a bad attack. Her visits to his office and her  conscienceless use of his time were finally brought to a sudden close  when one day he deliberately called other patients in, leaving her  unnoticed in the waiting-room. Bad times again, then other new  doctors, other periods of immunity from attacks, with exaggerated  devotion to each new helper until she had made the rounds of the  desirable, professional talent of Houston.    Meanwhile, impulsive extravagance had sadly reduced the Platt  inheritance, so when an acquaintance returned from St. Louis nervously  recreated by a specialist there, the poor doctor had to borrow on his  insurance to make it possible for her to have the benefit of this  noted physician's skill. The trip North meant sacrifice for the entire  family. Apparently she wished to be cured, and the treatment began  most auspiciously. After careful, expert investigation, assurance had  been given that if she would do her part, she could be made well in  six months. Her husband told the physician that he hoped he would  \"look in on her often, for she will do anything on earth for one she  likes.\" The treatment was thorough-going; it began at the beginning,  and during the early weeks she was enthusiastically satisfied with the  skill of her treatment and the care of her special nurse, in whom she  found another \"bosom friend,\" to whom she confided all. Her devotion  for the new doctor grew by leaps. Mistaking his kindness and thinking  perchance she might extract more beneficent sympathy by physical  methods, she impulsively"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59951"],[0,"New Witnesses for God (Volume 3 of 3) (#5)"],[1,"that had escaped destruction,  and were conversing upon the many physical changes which had taken  place in the land, and also of this same Jesus, of whose death they had  received such appalling evidences, when--but let me quote the account  of the event from the Book of Mormon:        And it came to pass that while they were conversing one with      another, they heard a voice as it came out of heaven; and they cast      their eyes round about, for they understood not the voice which      they heard; and it was not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud      voice; and notwithstanding it being a small voice, it did pierce      them that did hear to the centre, insomuch that there was no part      of their frame that it did not cause to quake; yea, it did pierce      them to the very soul and did cause their hearts to burn. And it      came to pass that again they heard the voice, and they understood      it not; and again the third time they did hear the voice, and did      open their ears to hear it; and their eyes were towards the sound      thereof; and they did look steadfastly towards heaven, from whence      the sound came; and behold the third time they did understand the      voice which they heard; and it said unto them, \"Behold my beloved      son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name:      hear ye him.\" And it came to pass as they understood, they cast      their eyes up again towards heaven; and behold, they saw a man      descending out of heaven; and he was clothed in a white robe, and      he came down and stood in the midst of them, and the eyes of the      whole multitude were turned upon him, and they durst not open their      mouths, even one to another, and wist not what it meant, for they      thought it was an angel that had appeared unto them. And it came to      pass that he stretched forth his hand and spake unto the people,      saying, Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified      should come into the world; and behold, I am the light and the life      of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the      Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon      me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of      the Father in all things from the beginning. And it came to pass      that when Jesus had spoken these words, the whole multitude fell to      the earth, for they remembered that it had been prophesied among      them that Christ should shew himself unto them after his ascension      into heaven. [1]    The task before us now is to ascertain if there is anything in the  native American traditions which sustain the probability of this  historical incident. Of course the reader must not be surprised if he  finds the native traditions on such a subject very much confused. All  such traditions, as I have before remarked, are so confused. Besides  it must be remembered that there were several great characters among  the inhabitants of the western world, according to the Book of Mormon,  who would likely be confounded with Messiah in the native traditions;  such as Moriancumr and Coriantumr among the Jaredites, the first and  the last great leaders, respectively, of that ancient people. Then  there is the first Nephi, Mulek, the first Mosiah, and several of the  Lord's apostles chosen from among the Nephites that are likely to be  confounded with Messiah and their mission with his ministry among  the people. But notwithstanding this confusion, I think evidences  of this advent of Messiah in the western world are traceable in the  native traditions; and I should be much disappointed if I had found it  otherwise, for of all incidents in Book of Mormon history, the advent  of Messiah is the most important.    II.    _Of the Culture-Heroes of America._    Speaking of American \"culture-heroes\" in general, Bancroft says:        Although bearing various names and appearing in different      countries, the American culture-heroes all present the same general      characteristics. They are all described as white, bearded men,      generally clad in long robes; appearing suddenly and mysteriously      upon the scene of their labors, they at once set about improving      the people by instructing them in useful and ornamental arts,      giving them laws, exhorting them to practice brotherly love and      other Christian virtues, and introducing a milder and better form      of religion; having accomplished their mission, they disappear      as mysteriously and unexpectedly as they came; and finally,      they are apotheosized and held in great reverence by a grateful      posterity. In such guise or on such mission did Quetzalcohuatl      appear in Cholula, Votan in Chiapas, Wixepecocha in Ojaca, Zamna,      and Cukulcan with his nineteen disciples, in Yucatan, Gucumatz in      Guatemala, Viracocha in Peru, Sume and Paye-Tome in Brazil, the      mysterious apostle mentioned by Rosales, in Chili, and Bochica in      Colombia. Peruvian legends speak of a nation of giants who came by      sea, waged war with the natives, and erected splendid edifices,      the ruins of many of which still remain. Besides these, there are      numerous vague traditions of settlements or nations of white men,      who lived apart from the other people of the country, and were      possessed of an advanced civilization. [2]    I suggest, in passing, that the part of the tradition which relates to  the existence \"of settlements or nations of white men who lived apart  from the other people of the country, and were possessed of an advanced  civilization,\" refers to those conditions that prevailed when the  Nephites and Lamanites occupied the land; the former an industrious,  civilized race, the latter an idle, savage race, conditions frequently  referred to in the Book of Mormon, in describing the status of the  Nephites and Lamanites, respectively.    Observe also that Bancroft, in the foregoing statement, says of some  of the characters that, having accomplished their mission, they  mysteriously disappeared. There are several such characters spoken  of in the Book of Mormon. Such was the case with the second Alma, a  noted Nephite character of the first half of the century immediately  preceding the advent of Messiah. He was the first president or \"judge\"  of the Nephite republic, also high priest of the Church, uniting in his  person the two offices--a thing not unusual among the Nephites, [3]  nor among the native Americans, if their annals may be trusted. [4]  After completing his life's mission, and making a remarkable prediction  concerning the destruction of the Nephite people, Alma departed out  of the land, \"and it came to pass that he was never heard of more; as  to his death or burial we know not of. Behold, this we know, that he  was a righteous man; and the saying went abroad in the church that  he was taken by the Spirit, or buried by the hand of the Lord.\" [5]  In a similar manner, Nephi, the father of Nephi, the apostle, a very  noted Nephite leader and prophet, departed out of the land in the same  mysterious manner. [6]    The quotation just made from Bancroft on the culture-heroes of  America represents them as quite numerous; we shall see, however, as  we proceed, that a number of them are the same person remembered in  different countries under different names and titles, and that in  the character and mission of each there is much similarity. Because  of this similarity, however, it must not be supposed that it is my  intention to claim each of these \"culture heroes\" as a more or less  tradition-distorted representation of Messiah; and the life and  mission of the culture-hero a distorted account of Messiah's advent  and mission among the Nephites. Quite to the contrary, I believe that  the traditions concerning some of these \"culture-heroes\" more nearly  represent other Book of Mormon characters than they do Messiah. Such,  for instance, is Votan, the supposed founder of the Maya confederation.  Some things in his character and career make him more nearly resemble  Moriancumr, the leader of the Jaredite colony, than Messiah. Bancroft,  in one summary of the legends respecting him, says:        Votan, another mysterious personage, closely resembling      Quetzalcohuatl in many points, was the supposed founder of the      Maya civilization. He is said to have been a descendant of Noah and      to have assisted at the building of the Tower of Babel. After the      confusion of tongues he led a portion of the dispersed people to      America. There he established the kingdom of Xibalba and built the      city of Palenque. [7]    Then again, in some respects, Votan resembles the first Nephi. He  is said to have come to America one thousand years B. C.; [8] Nephi  came early in the sixth century B. C.; Votan brought with him seven  families; the Nephite colony, as nearly as may be estimated, on  reaching America, consisted of eight families. [9] Votan came to  America by divine commandment; so, too, did the Nephite colony. [10]  Votan wrote a book, in which he inscribed a complete record of all he  had done; [11] so, also, did Nephi. [12] Votan united in his person the  qualities of high priest and king; so, also, did Nephi.    After saying all this, however, it has to be admitted that there are  some things in the legends concerning Votan which do not run parallel  with the career of Nephi. Such, for instance, as his alleged visit to  Spain, Rome, Jerusalem, where, in the latter place, he saw the temple  of Solomon building; also his visit to the Euphrates valley, where  he saw the unfinished Tower of Babel. The part of his story which  describes his finding in America a colony of the same race as his  own people, reminds one of the first Mosiah, who found the people of  Zarahemla, in the valley of the Sidon. It will be remembered that these  people came from Jerusalem, were Jews, and are known as the"]]]
