The solitary visionaries are despised or regarded as abnormal and  eccentric. Those who are not wrapped in lethargy and who feel  vague longings for spiritual life and knowledge and progress, cry  in harsh chorus, without any to comfort them. The night of the  spirit falls more and more darkly. Deeper becomes the misery of  these blind and terrified guides, and their followers, tormented  and unnerved by fear and doubt, prefer to this gradual darkening  the final sudden leap into the blackness.    At such a time art ministers to lower needs, and is used for  material ends. She seeks her substance in hard realities because  she knows of nothing nobler. Objects, the reproduction of which  is considered her sole aim, remain monotonously the same. The  question \"what?\" disappears from art; only the question \"how?\"  remains. By what method are these material objects to be  reproduced? The word becomes a creed. Art has lost her soul.    In the search for method the artist goes still further. Art  becomes so specialized as to be comprehensible only to artists,  and they complain bitterly of public indifference to their work.  For since the artist in such times has no need to say much, but  only to be notorious for some small originality and consequently  lauded by a small group of patrons and connoisseurs (which  incidentally is also a very profitable business for him), there  arise a crowd of gifted and skilful painters, so easy does the  conquest of art appear. In each artistic circle are thousands of  such artists, of whom the majority seek only for some new  technical manner, and who produce millions of works of art  without enthusiasm, with cold hearts and souls asleep.    Competition arises. The wild battle for success becomes more and  more material. Small groups who have fought their way to the top  of the chaotic world of art and picture-making entrench  themselves in the territory they have won. The public, left far  behind, looks on bewildered, loses interest and turns away.    But despite all this confusion, this chaos, this wild hunt for  notoriety, the spiritual triangle, slowly but surely, with  irresistible strength, moves onwards and upwards.    The invisible Moses descends from the mountain and sees the dance  round the golden calf. But he brings with him fresh stores of  wisdom to man.    First by the artist is heard his voice, the voice that is  inaudible to the crowd. Almost unknowingly the artist follows the  call. Already in that very question \"how?\" lies a hidden seed of  renaissance. For when this \"how?\" remains without any fruitful  answer, there is always a possibility that the same \"something\"  (which we call personality today) may be able to see in the  objects about it not only what is purely material but also  something less solid; something less \"bodily\" than was seen in  the period of realism, when the universal aim was to reproduce  anything \"as it really is\" and without fantastic imagination.    [Footnote: Frequent use is made here of the terms \"material\" and  \"non-material,\" and of the intermediate phrases \"more\" or \"less  material.\" Is everything material? or is EVERYTHING spiritual?  Can the distinctions we make between matter and spirit be nothing  but relative modifications of one or the other? Thought which,  although a product of the spirit, can be defined with positive  science, is matter, but of fine and not coarse substance. Is  whatever cannot be touched with the hand, spiritual? The  discussion lies beyond the scope of this little book; all that  matters here is that the boundaries drawn should not be too  definite.]    If the emotional power of the artist can overwhelm the \"how?\" and  can give free scope to his finer feelings, then art is on the  crest of the road by which she will not fail later on to find the  \"what\" she has lost, the \"what\" which will show the way to the  spiritual food of the newly awakened spiritual life. This \"what?\"  will no longer be the material, objective \"what\" of the former  period, but the internal truth of art, the soul without which the  body (i.e. the \"how\") can never be healthy, whether in an  individual or in a whole people.    THIS \"WHAT\" IS THE INTERNAL TRUTH WHICH ONLY ART CAN DIVINE,  WHICH ONLY ART CAN EXPRESS BY THOSE MEANS OF EXPRESSION WHICH ARE  HERS ALONE.        III. SPIRITUAL REVOLUTION        The spiritual triangle moves slowly onwards and upwards. Today  one of the largest of the lower segments has reached the point of  using the first battle cry of the materialist creed. The dwellers  in this segment group themselves round various banners in  religion. They call themselves Jews, Catholics, Protestants, etc.  But they are really atheists, and this a few either of the  boldest or the narrowest openly avow. \"Heaven is empty,\" \"God is  dead.\" In politics these people are democrats and republicans.  The fear, horror and hatred which yesterday they felt for these  political creeds they now direct against anarchism, of which they  know nothing but its much dreaded name.    In economics these people are Socialists. They make sharp the  sword of justice with which to slay the hydra of capitalism and  to hew off the head of evil.    Because the inhabitants of this great segment of the triangle  have never solved any problem independently, but are dragged as  it were in a cart by those the noblest of their fellowmen who  have sacrificed themselves, they know nothing of the vital  impulse of life which they regard always vaguely from a great  distance. They rate this impulse lightly, putting their trust in  purposeless theory and in the working of some logical method.    The men of the segment next below are dragged slowly higher,  blindly, by those just described. But they cling to their old  position, full of dread of the unknown and of betrayal. The  higher segments are not only blind atheists but can justify their  godlessness with strange words; for example, those of Virchow--so  unworthy of a learned man--\"I have dissected many corpses, but  never yet discovered a soul in any of them.\"    In politics they are generally republican, with a knowledge of  different parliamentary procedures; they read the political  leading articles in the newspapers. In economics they are  socialists of various grades, and can support their \"principles\"  with numerous quotations, passing from Schweitzer's EMMA via  Lasalle's IRON LAW OF WAGES, to Marx's CAPITAL, and still  further.    In these loftier segments other categories of ideas, absent in  these just described, begin gradually to appear--science and art,  to which last belong also literature and music.    In science these men are positivists, only recognizing those  things that can be weighed and measured. Anything beyond that  they consider as rather discreditable nonsense, that same  nonsense about which they held yesterday the theories that today  are proven.    In art they are naturalists, which means that they recognize and  value the personality, individuality and temperament of the  artist up to a certain definite point. This point has been fixed  by others, and in it they believe unflinchingly.    But despite their patent and well-ordered security, despite their  infallible principles, there lurks in these higher segments a  hidden fear, a nervous trembling, a sense of insecurity. And this  is due to their upbringing. They know that the sages, statesmen  and artists whom today they revere, were yesterday spurned as  swindlers and charlatans. And the higher the segment in the  triangle, the better defined is this fear, this modern sense of  insecurity. Here and there are people with eyes which can see,  minds which can correlate. They say to themselves: \"If the  science of the day before yesterday is rejected by the people of  yesterday, and that of yesterday by us of today, is it not  possible that what we call science now will be rejected by the  men of tomorrow?\" And the bravest of them answer, \"It is  possible.\"    Then people appear who can distinguish those problems that the  science of today has not yet explained. And they ask themselves:  \"Will science, if it continues on the road it has followed for so  long, ever attain to the solution of these problems? And if it  does so attain, will men be able to rely on its solution?\" In  these segments are also professional men of learning who can  remember the time when facts now recognized by the Academies as  firmly established, were scorned by those same Academies. There  are also philosophers of aesthetic who write profound books about  an art which was yesterday condemned as nonsense. In writing  these books they remove the barriers over which art has most  recently stepped and set up new ones which are to remain for ever  in the places they have chosen. They do not notice that they are  busy erecting barriers, not in front of art, but behind it. And  if they do notice this, on the morrow they merely write fresh  books and hastily set their barriers a little further on. This  performance will go on unaltered until it is realized that the  most extreme principle of aesthetic can never be of value to the  future, but only to the past. No such theory of principle can be  laid down for those things which lie beyond, in the realm of the  immaterial. That which has no material existence cannot be  subjected to a material classification. That which belongs to the  spirit of the future can only be realized in feeling, and to this  feeling the talent of the artist is the only road. Theory is the  lamp which sheds light on the petrified ideas of yesterday and of  the more distant past. [Footnote: Cf.
