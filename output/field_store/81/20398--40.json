She crept carefully along till she saw a settlement of little huts very  like mushrooms, for they were made of cookies set on lumps of the brown  sugar; and queer people, looking as if made of gingerbread, were working  very busily round several stoves which seemed to bake at a great rate.    \"I'll creep nearer and see what sort of people they are before I show  myself,\" said Lily, going into a grove of spice-trees, and sitting down  on a stone which proved to be the plummy sort of cake we used to call  Brighton Rock.    Presently one of the tallest men came striding toward the trees with a  pan, evidently after spice; and before she could run, he saw Lily.    \"Hollo, what do you want?\" he asked, staring at her with his black  currant eyes, while he briskly picked the bark off a cinnamon-tree.    \"I'm travelling, and would like to know what place this is, if you  please,\" answered Lily, very politely, being a little frightened.    \"Cake-land. Where do you come from?\" asked the gingerbread man, in a  crisp tone of voice.    \"I was blown into the Candy country, and have been there a long time;  but I got tired of it, and ran away to find something better.\"    \"Sensible child!\" and the man smiled till Lily thought his cheeks would  crumble. \"You'll get on better here with us Brownies than with the lazy  Bonbons, who never work and are all for show. They won't own us, though  we are all related through our grandparents Sugar and Molasses. We are  busy folks; so they turn up their noses and don't speak when we meet at  parties. Poor creatures, silly and sweet and unsubstantial! I pity 'em.\"    \"Could I make you a visit? I'd like to see how you live, and what you  do. I'm sure it must be interesting,\" said Lily, picking herself up  after a tumble, having eaten nearly all the stone, she was so hungry.    \"I know you will. Come on! I can talk while I work.\" And the funny  gingerbread man trotted off toward his kitchen, full of pans,  rolling-pins, and molasses jugs.    \"Sit down. I shall be at leisure as soon as this batch is baked. There  are still some wise people down below who like gingerbread, and I have  my hands full,\" he said, dashing about, stirring, rolling out, and  slapping the brown dough into pans, which he whisked into the oven and  out again so fast that Lily knew there must be magic about it somewhere.    Every now and then he threw her a delicious cooky warm from the oven.  She liked the queer fellow, and presently began to talk, being very  curious about this country.    \"What is your name, sir?\"    \"Ginger Snap.\"    Lily thought it a good one; for he was very quick, and she fancied he  could be short and sharp if he liked.    \"Where does all this cake go to?\" she asked, after watching the other  kitchens full of workers, who were all of different kinds of cake, and  each set of cooks made its own sort.    \"I'll show you by and by,\" answered Snap, beginning to pile up the heaps  of gingerbread on a little car that ran along a track leading to some  unknown storeroom, Lily thought.    \"Don't you get tired of doing this all the time?\"    \"Yes; but I want to be promoted, and I never shall be till I've done my  best, and won the prize here.\"    \"Oh, tell me about it! What is the prize, and how are you promoted? Is  this a cooking-school?\"    \"Yes; the prize for best gingerbread is a cake of condensed yeast. That  puts a soul into me, and I begin to rise till I am able to go over the  hills yonder into the blessed land of bread, and be one of the happy  creatures who are always wholesome, always needed, and without which the  world below would be in a bad way.\"    \"Bless me! that is the queerest thing I've heard yet. But I don't wonder  you want to go; I'm tired of sweets myself, and long for a good piece of  bread, though I used to want cake and candy at home.\"    \"Ah, my dear, you'll learn a good deal here; and you are lucky not to  have got into the clutches of Giant Dyspepsia, who always gets people if  they eat too much of such rubbish and scorn wholesome bread. I leave my  ginger behind when I go, and get white and round and beautiful, as you  will see. The Gingerbread family have never been as foolish as some of  the other cakes. Wedding is the worst; such extravagance in the way of  wine and spice and fruit I never saw, and such a mess to eat when it's  done! I don't wonder people get sick; serves 'em right.\" And Snap flung  down a pan with such a bang that it made Lily jump.    \"Sponge cake isn't bad, is it? Mamma lets me eat it, but I like frosted  pound better,\" she said, looking over to the next kitchen, where piles  of that sort of cake were being iced.    \"Poor stuff. No substance. Ladies' fingers will do for babies, but pound  has too much butter ever to be healthy. Let it alone, and eat cookies or  seed-cakes, my dear. Now, come along; I'm ready.\" And Snap trundled away  his car-load at a great pace.    Lily ran behind to pick up whatever fell, and looked about her as she  went, for this was certainly a very queer country. Lakes of eggs all  beaten up, and hot springs of saleratus foamed here and there ready for  use. The earth was brown sugar or ground spice; and the only fruits  were raisins, dried currants, citron, and lemon peel. It was a very busy  place; for every one cooked all the time, and never failed and never  seemed tired, though they got so hot that they only wore sheets of paper  for clothes. There were piles of it to put over the cake, so that it  shouldn't burn; and they made cook's white caps and aprons of it, and  looked very nice. A large clock made of a flat pancake, with cloves to  mark the hours and two toothpicks for hands, showed them how long to  bake things; and in one place an ice wall was built round a lake of  butter, which they cut in lumps as they wanted it.    \"Here we are. Now, stand away while I pitch 'em down,\" said Snap,  stopping at last before a hole in the ground where a dumbwaiter hung  ready, with a name over it.    There were many holes all round, and many waiters, each with its name;  and Lily was amazed when she read \"Weber,\" \"Copeland,\" \"Dooling,\" and  others, which she knew very well.    Over Snap's place was the name \"Newmarch;\" and Lily said, \"Why, that's  where mamma gets her hard gingerbread, and Weber's is where we go for  ice-cream. Do _you_ make cake for them?\"    \"Yes, but no one knows it. It's one of the secrets of the trade. We cook  for all the confectioners, and people think the good things come out of  the cellars under their saloons. Good joke, isn't it?\" And Snap laughed  till a crack came in his neck and made him cough.    Lily was so surprised she sat down on a warm queen's cake that happened  to be near, and watched Snap send down load after load of gingerbread  to be eaten by children, who would have liked it much better if they had  only known where it came from, as she did.    As she sat, the clatter of many spoons, the smell of many dinners, and  the sound of many voices calling, \"One vanilla, two strawberries, and a  Charlotte Russe,\" \"Three stews, cup coffee, dry toast,\" \"Roast chicken  and apple without,\" came up the next hole, which was marked \"Copeland.\"    \"Dear me! it seems as if I was there,\" said Lily, longing to hop down,  but afraid of the bump at the other end.    \"I'm done. Come along, I'll ride you back,\" called Snap, tossing the  last cooky after the dumb-waiter as it went slowly out of sight with its  spicy load.    \"I wish you'd teach me to cook. It looks great fun, and mamma wants me  to learn; only our cook hates to have me mess round, and is so cross  that I don't like to try at home,\" said Lily, as she went trundling  back.    \"Better wait till you get to Bread-land, and learn to make that. It's  a great art, and worth knowing. Don't waste your time on cake, though  plain gingerbread isn't bad to have in the house. I'll teach you that in  a jiffy, if the clock doesn't strike my hour too soon,\" answered Snap,  helping her down.    \"What hour?\"    \"Why, of my freedom. I never know when I've done my task till I'm called  by the chimes and go to get my soul,\" said Snap, turning his currant  eyes anxiously to the clock.    \"I hope you _will_ have time.\" And Lily fell to work with all her might,  after Snap had put on her a paper apron and a cap like his.    It was not hard; for when she was going to make a mistake a spark flew  out of the fire and burnt her in time to remind her to look at the  receipt, which was a sheet of gingerbread in a frame of pie-crust hung  up before her, with the directions written while it was soft and baked  in. The third sheet she made came out of the oven spicy, light, and  brown; and Snap, giving it one poke, said, \"That's all right. Now you  know. Here's your reward.\"    He handed her a receipt-book made of thin sheets of sugar-gingerbread  held together by a gelatine binding, with her name stamped on the back,  and each leaf crimped with a cake-cutter in the most elegant manner.    Lily was charmed with it, but had no time to read all it contained; for  just then the clock began to strike, and a chime of bells to ring,--      \"Gingerbread,    Go to the head.    Your task is done;    A soul is won.    Take it and go    Where muffins grow,    Where sweet loaves rise    To the very skies,    And biscuits fair    Perfume the air.    Away, away!    Make no delay;    In the sea of flour    Plunge this hour.    Safe in your breast    Let the yeast-cake rest,    Till you rise in joy,    A white bread boy!\"    \"Ha, ha! I'm free! I'm free!\" cried Snap, catching up the silver-covered  square that seemed to fall from heaven; and running to a great white sea  of flour, he went "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7439"],[0,"English Fairy Tales (#5)"],[1,"guineas for the cow, and the owner said that, as  he was a friend, he'd oblige him. So the bargain was made, and he got  the cow and he drove it backwards and forwards to show it.    By-and-by he saw a man playing the bagpipes--Tweedle-dum tweedle-dee.  The children followed him about, and he appeared to be pocketing money  on all sides. \"Well,\" thought Mr. Vinegar, \"if I had but that beautiful  instrument I should be the happiest man alive--my fortune would be  made.\"    So he went up to the man. \"Friend,\" says he, \"what a beautiful  instrument that is, and what a deal of money you must make.\" \"Why, yes,\"  said the man, \"I make a great deal of money, to be sure, and it is a  wonderful instrument.\" \"Oh!\" cried Mr. Vinegar, \"how I should like to  possess it!\" \"Well,\" said the man, \"as you are a friend, I don't much  mind parting with it; you shall have it for that red cow.\" \"Done!\" said  the delighted Mr. Vinegar. So the beautiful red cow was given for the  bagpipes.    He walked up and down with his purchase; but it was in vain he tried  to play a tune, and instead of pocketing pence, the boys followed him  hooting, laughing, and pelting.    Poor Mr. Vinegar, his fingers grew very cold, and, just as he was  leaving the town, he met a man with a fine thick pair of gloves. \"Oh,  my fingers are so very cold,\" said Mr. Vinegar to himself. \"Now if I had  but those beautiful gloves I should be the happiest man alive.\" He went  up to the man, and said to him, \"Friend, you seem to have a capital pair  of gloves there.\" \"Yes, truly,\" cried the man; \"and my hands are as warm  as possible this cold November day.\" \"Well,\" said Mr. Vinegar, \"I should  like to have them.\". \"What will you give?\" said the man; \"as you are  a friend, I don't much mind letting you have them for those bagpipes.\"  \"Done!\" cried Mr. Vinegar. He put on the gloves, and felt perfectly  happy as he trudged homewards.    At last he grew very tired, when he saw a man coming towards him with a  good stout stick in his hand.    \"Oh,\" said Mr. Vinegar, \"that I had but that stick! I should then be the  happiest man alive.\" He said to the man: \"Friend! what a rare good stick  you have got.\" \"Yes,\" said the man; \"I have used it for many a long  mile, and a good friend it has been; but if you have a fancy for it,  as you are a friend, I don't mind giving it to you for that pair of  gloves.\" Mr. Vinegar's hands were so warm, and his legs so tired, that  he gladly made the exchange.    As he drew near to the wood where he had left his wife, he heard a  parrot on a tree calling out his name: \"Mr. Vinegar, you foolish man,  you blockhead, you simpleton; you went to the fair, and laid out all  your money in buying a cow. Not content with that, you changed it  for bagpipes, on which you could not play, and which were not worth  one-tenth of the money. You fool, you--you had no sooner got the  bagpipes than you changed them for the gloves, which were not worth  one-quarter of the money; and when you had got the gloves, you changed  them for a poor miserable stick; and now for your forty guineas, cow,  bagpipes, and gloves, you have nothing to show but that poor miserable  stick, which you might have cut in any hedge.\" On this the bird laughed  and laughed, and Mr. Vinegar, falling into a violent rage, threw the  stick at its head. The stick lodged in the tree, and he returned to his  wife without money, cow, bagpipes, gloves, or stick, and she instantly  gave him such a sound cudgelling that she almost broke every bone in his  skin.          NIX NOUGHT NOTHING    There once lived a king and a queen as many a one has been. They were  long married and had no children; but at last a baby-boy came to the  queen when the king was away in the far countries. The queen would not  christen the boy till the king came back, and she said, \"We will just  call him _Nix Nought Nothing_ until his father comes home.\" But it was  long before he came home, and the boy had grown a nice little laddie.  At length the king was on his way back; but he had a big river to cross,  and there was a whirlpool, and he could not get over the water. But a  giant came up to him, and said \"I'll carry you over.\" But the king said:  \"What's your pay?\" \"O give me Nix, Nought, Nothing, and I will carry you  over the water on my back.\" The king had never heard that his son was  called Nix Nought Nothing, and so he said: \"O, I'll give you that and  my thanks into the bargain.\" When the king got home again, he was very  happy to see his wife again, and his young son. She told him that she  had not given the child any name, but just Nix Nought Nothing, until he  should come home again himself. The poor king was in a terrible case.  He said: \"What have I done? I promised to give the giant who carried me  over the river on his back, Nix Nought Nothing.\" The king and the queen  were sad and sorry, but they said: \"When the giant comes we will give  him the hen-wife's boy; he will never know the difference.\" The next  day the giant came to claim the king's promise, and he sent for the  hen-wife's boy; and the giant went away with the boy on his back. He  travelled till he came to a big stone, and there he sat down to rest. He  said,    \"Hidge, Hodge, on my back, what time of day is that?\"    The poor little boy said: \"It is the time that my mother, the hen-wife,  takes up the eggs for the queen's breakfast.\"    The Giant was very angry, and dashed the boy's head on the stone and  killed him.    So he went back in a tower of a temper and this time they gave him the  gardener's boy. He went off with him on his back till they got to the  stone again when the giant sat down to rest. And he said:    \"Hidge, Hodge, on my back, what time of day do you make that?\"    The gardener's boy said: \"Sure it's the time that my mother takes up the  vegetables for the queen's dinner.\" Then the giant was right wild and  dashed his brains out on the stone.    Then the giant went back to the king's house in a terrible temper and  said he would destroy them all if they did not give him Nix Nought  Nothing this time. They had to do it; and when he came to the big stone,  the giant said: \"What time of day is that?\" Nix Nought Nothing said: \"It  is the time that my father the king will be sitting down to supper.\" The  giant said: \"I've got the right one now;\" and took Nix Nought Nothing to  his own house and brought him up till he was a man.    The giant had a bonny daughter, and she and the lad grew very fond of  each other. The giant said one day to Nix Nought Nothing: \"I've work for  you to-morrow. There is a stable seven miles long and seven miles broad,  and it has not been cleaned for seven years, and you must clean it  to-morrow, or I will have you for my supper.\"    The giant's daughter went out next morning with the lad's breakfast, and  found him in a terrible state, for always as he cleaned out a bit, it  just fell in again. The giant's daughter said she would help him, and  she cried all the beasts in the field, and all the fowls of the air, and  in a minute they all came, and carried away everything that was in the  stable and made it all clean before the giant came home. He said: \"Shame  on the wit that helped you; but I have a worse job for you to-morrow.\"  Then he said to Nix Nought Nothing: \"There's a lake seven miles long,  and seven miles deep, and seven miles broad, and you must drain it  to-morrow by nightfall, or else I'll have you for my supper.\" Nix Nought  Nothing began early next morning and tried to lave the water with his  pail, but the lake was never getting any less, and he didn't know what  to do; but the giant's daughter called on all the fish in the sea to  come and drink the water, and very soon they drank it dry. When the  giant saw the work done he was in a rage, and said: \"I've a worse job  for you to-morrow; there is a tree, seven miles high, and no branch on  it, till you get to the top, and there is a nest with seven eggs in it,  and you must bring down all the eggs without breaking one, or else I'll  have you for my supper.\" At first the giant's daughter did not know how  to help Nix Nought Nothing; but she cut off first her fingers and then  her toes, and made steps of them, and he clomb the tree and got all the  eggs safe till he came just to the bottom, and then one was broken. So  they determined to run away together and after the giant's daughter had  tidied up her hair a bit and got her magic flask they set out together  as fast as they could run. And they hadn't got but three fields away  when they looked back and saw the giant walking along at top speed after  them. \"Quick, quick,\" called out the giant's daughter, \"take my comb  from my hair and throw it down.\" Nix Nought Nothing took her comb from  her hair and threw it down, and out of every one of its prongs there  sprung up a fine thick briar in the way of the giant. You may be sure it  took him a long time to work his way through the briar bush and by the  time he was well through Nix Nought Nothing and his sweetheart had run  on a tidy step away from him. But he soon came along after them and was  just like to catch 'em up when the giant's daughter called out to Nix  Nought Nothing, \"Take my hair dagger and throw it down, quick, quick.\"  So Nix Nought Nothing threw down the hair dagger and out of it grew as  quick as lightning a thick hedge of sharp razors placed criss-cross. The  giant had to tread very cautiously to get through all this and meanwhile  the young lovers ran on, and on, and on, till they were nearly out of  sight. But at last the giant was through, and it wasn't long before he  was like to catch them up. But just as he was stretching out his hand  to catch Nix Nought Nothing his daughter took out her magic flask and  dashed it on the ground. And as it broke out of it welled a big, big  wave that grew, and that grew, till it reached the giant's waist and  then his neck, and when it got to his head, he was drowned"]]]
