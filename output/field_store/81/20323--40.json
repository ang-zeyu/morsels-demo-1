[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5827"],[0,"The Problems of Philosophy (#5)"],[1,"science and common sense assume, there is one public  all-embracing physical space in which physical objects are, the relative  positions of physical objects in physical space must more or less  correspond to the relative positions of sense-data in our private  spaces. There is no difficulty in supposing this to be the case. If we  see on a road one house nearer to us than another, our other senses will  bear out the view that it is nearer; for example, it will be reached  sooner if we walk along the road. Other people will agree that the house  which looks nearer to us is nearer; the ordnance map will take the  same view; and thus everything points to a spatial relation between the  houses corresponding to the relation between the sense-data which we see  when we look at the houses. Thus we may assume that there is a physical  space in which physical objects have spatial relations corresponding to  those which the corresponding sense-data have in our private spaces. It  is this physical space which is dealt with in geometry and assumed in  physics and astronomy.    Assuming that there is physical space, and that it does thus correspond  to private spaces, what can we know about it? We can know _only_ what is  required in order to secure the correspondence. That is to say, we can  know nothing of what it is like in itself, but we can know the sort  of arrangement of physical objects which results from their spatial  relations. We can know, for example, that the earth and moon and sun  are in one straight line during an eclipse, though we cannot know what  a physical straight line is in itself, as we know the look of a straight  line in our visual space. Thus we come to know much more about the  _relations_ of distances in physical space than about the distances  themselves; we may know that one distance is greater than another, or  that it is along the same straight line as the other, but we cannot have  that immediate acquaintance with physical distances that we have with  distances in our private spaces, or with colours or sounds or other  sense-data. We can know all those things about physical space which a  man born blind might know through other people about the space of sight;  but the kind of things which a man born blind could never know about the  space of sight we also cannot know about physical space. We can know the  properties of the relations required to preserve the correspondence with  sense-data, but we cannot know the nature of the terms between which the  relations hold.    With regard to time, our _feeling_ of duration or of the lapse of time  is notoriously an unsafe guide as to the time that has elapsed by the  clock. Times when we are bored or suffering pain pass slowly, times when  we are agreeably occupied pass quickly, and times when we are sleeping  pass almost as if they did not exist. Thus, in so far as time is  constituted by duration, there is the same necessity for distinguishing  a public and a private time as there was in the case of space. But in so  far as time consists in an _order_ of before and after, there is no need  to make such a distinction; the time-order which events seem to have is,  so far as we can see, the same as the time-order which they do have. At  any rate no reason can be given for supposing that the two orders are  not the same. The same is usually true of space: if a regiment of men  are marching along a road, the shape of the regiment will look different  from different points of view, but the men will appear arranged in the  same order from all points of view. Hence we regard the order as true  also in physical space, whereas the shape is only supposed to correspond  to the physical space so far as is required for the preservation of the  order.    In saying that the time-order which events seem to have is the same as  the time-order which they really have, it is necessary to guard against  a possible misunderstanding. It must not be supposed that the various  states of different physical objects have the same time-order as the  sense-data which constitute the perceptions of those objects. Considered  as physical objects, the thunder and lightning are simultaneous; that is  to say, the lightning is simultaneous with the disturbance of the air in  the place where the disturbance begins, namely, where the lightning  is. But the sense-datum which we call hearing the thunder does not take  place until the disturbance of the air has travelled as far as to where  we are. Similarly, it takes about eight minutes for the sun's light  to reach us; thus, when we see the sun we are seeing the sun of eight  minutes ago. So far as our sense-data afford evidence as to the physical  sun they afford evidence as to the physical sun of eight minutes ago; if  the physical sun had ceased to exist within the last eight minutes, that  would make no difference to the sense-data which we call 'seeing  the sun'. This affords a fresh illustration of the necessity of  distinguishing between sense-data and physical objects.    What we have found as regards space is much the same as what we find  in relation to the correspondence of the sense-data with their  physical counterparts. If one object looks blue and another red, we may  reasonably presume that there is some corresponding difference between  the physical objects; if two objects both look blue, we may presume a  corresponding similarity. But we cannot hope to be acquainted directly  with the quality in the physical object which makes it look blue or red.  Science tells us that this quality is a certain sort of wave-motion, and  this sounds familiar, because we think of wave-motions in the space we  see. But the wave-motions must really be in physical space, with which  we have no direct acquaintance; thus the real wave-motions have not that  familiarity which we might have supposed them to have. And what holds  for colours is closely similar to what holds for other sense-data. Thus  we find that, although the _relations_ of physical objects have all  sorts of knowable properties, derived from their correspondence with the  relations of sense-data, the physical objects themselves remain unknown  in their intrinsic nature, so far at least as can be discovered by means  of the senses. The question remains whether there is any other method of  discovering the intrinsic nature of physical objects.    The most natural, though not ultimately the most defensible, hypothesis  to adopt in the first instance, at any rate as regards visual  sense-data, would be that, though physical objects cannot, for the  reasons we have been considering, be _exactly_ like sense-data, yet they  may be more or less like. According to this view, physical objects will,  for example, really have colours, and we might, by good luck, see an  object as of the colour it really is. The colour which an object seems  to have at any given moment will in general be very similar, though  not quite the same, from many different points of view; we might thus  suppose the 'real' colour to be a sort of medium colour, intermediate  between the various shades which appear from the different points of  view.    Such a theory is perhaps not capable of being definitely refuted, but  it can be shown to be groundless. To begin with, it is plain that the  colour we see depends only upon the nature of the light-waves that  strike the eye, and is therefore modified by the medium intervening  between us and the object, as well as by the manner in which light is  reflected from the object in the direction of the eye. The intervening  air alters colours unless it is perfectly clear, and any strong  reflection will alter them completely. Thus the colour we see is a  result of the ray as it reaches the eye, and not simply a property of  the object from which the ray comes. Hence, also, provided certain waves  reach the eye, we shall see a certain colour, whether the object from  which the waves start has any colour or not. Thus it is quite gratuitous  to suppose that physical objects have colours, and therefore there is no  justification for making such a supposition. Exactly similar arguments  will apply to other sense-data.    It remains to ask whether there are any general philosophical arguments  enabling us to say that, if matter is real, it must be of such and such  a nature. As explained above, very many philosophers, perhaps most, have  held that whatever is real must be in some sense mental, or at any rate  that whatever we can know anything about must be in some sense mental.  Such philosophers are called 'idealists'. Idealists tell us that what  appears as matter is really something mental; namely, either (as Leibniz  held) more or less rudimentary minds, or (as Berkeley contended) ideas  in the minds which, as we should commonly say, 'perceive' the matter.  Thus idealists deny the existence of matter as something intrinsically  different from mind, though they do not deny that our sense-data are  signs of something which exists independently of our private sensations.  In the following chapter we shall consider briefly the reasons--in my  opinion fallacious--which idealists advance in favour of their theory.        CHAPTER IV. IDEALISM    The word 'idealism' is used by different philosophers in somewhat  different senses. We shall understand by it the doctrine that whatever  exists, or at any rate whatever can be known to exist, must be in  some sense mental. This doctrine, which is very widely held among  philosophers, has several forms, and is advocated on several different  grounds. The doctrine is so widely held, and so interesting in itself,  that even the briefest survey of philosophy must give some account of  it.    Those who are unaccustomed to philosophical speculation may be inclined  to dismiss such a doctrine as obviously absurd.

I trace these lines, self-distrustfully, with the shadows  of after-events darkening the very paper I write on; and still I say,  what could I do?    What I did do, was to try and gain time by questioning her.  \"Are you  sure that your friend in London will receive you at such a late hour as  this?\" I said.    \"Quite sure.  Only say you will let me leave you when and how I  please--only say you won't interfere with me.  Will you promise?\"    As she repeated the words for the third time, she came close to me and  laid her hand, with a sudden gentle stealthiness, on my bosom--a thin  hand; a cold hand (when I removed it with mine) even on that sultry  night.  Remember that I was young; remember that the hand which touched  me was a woman's.    \"Will you promise?\"    \"Yes.\"    One word! The little familiar word that is on everybody's lips, every  hour in the day.  Oh me! and I tremble, now, when I write it.    We set our faces towards London, and walked on together in the first  still hour of the new day--I, and this woman, whose name, whose  character, whose story, whose objects in life, whose very presence by  my side, at that moment, were fathomless mysteries to me.  It was like  a dream.  Was I Walter Hartright? Was this the well-known, uneventful  road, where holiday people strolled on Sundays? Had I really left,  little more than an hour since, the quiet, decent, conventionally  domestic atmosphere of my mother's cottage? I was too bewildered--too  conscious also of a vague sense of something like self-reproach--to  speak to my strange companion for some minutes.  It was her voice again  that first broke the silence between us.    \"I want to ask you something,\" she said suddenly.  \"Do you know many  people in London?\"    \"Yes, a great many.\"    \"Many men of rank and title?\" There was an unmistakable tone of  suspicion in the strange question.  I hesitated about answering it.    \"Some,\" I said, after a moment's silence.    \"Many\"--she came to a full stop, and looked me searchingly in the  face--\"many men of the rank of Baronet?\"    Too much astonished to reply, I questioned her in my turn.    \"Why do you ask?\"    \"Because I hope, for my own sake, there is one Baronet that you don't  know.\"    \"Will you tell me his name?\"    \"I can't--I daren't--I forget myself when I mention it.\" She spoke  loudly and almost fiercely, raised her clenched hand in the air, and  shook it passionately; then, on a sudden, controlled herself again, and  added, in tones lowered to a whisper \"Tell me which of them YOU know.\"    I could hardly refuse to humour her in such a trifle, and I mentioned  three names.  Two, the names of fathers of families whose daughters I  taught; one, the name of a bachelor who had once taken me a cruise in  his yacht, to make sketches for him.    \"Ah! you DON'T know him,\" she said, with a sigh of relief.  \"Are you a  man of rank and title yourself?\"    \"Far from it.  I am only a drawing-master.\"    As the reply passed my lips--a little bitterly, perhaps--she took my  arm with the abruptness which characterised all her actions.    \"Not a man of rank and title,\" she repeated to herself.  \"Thank God! I  may trust HIM.\"    I had hitherto contrived to master my curiosity out of consideration  for my companion; but it got the better of me now.    \"I am afraid you have serious reason to complain of some man of rank  and title?\" I said.  \"I am afraid the baronet, whose name you are  unwilling to mention to me, has done you some grievous wrong? Is he the  cause of your being out here at this strange time of night?\"    \"Don't ask me: don't make me talk of it,\" she answered.  \"I'm not fit  now.  I have been cruelly used and cruelly wronged.  You will be kinder  than ever, if you will walk on fast, and not speak to me.  I sadly want  to quiet myself, if I can.\"    We moved forward again at a quick pace; and for half an hour, at least,  not a word passed on either side.  From time to time, being forbidden  to make any more inquiries, I stole a look at her face. It was always  the same; the lips close shut, the brow frowning, the eyes looking  straight forward, eagerly and yet absently.  We had reached the first  houses, and were close on the new Wesleyan college, before her set  features relaxed and she spoke once more.    \"Do you live in London?\" she said.    \"Yes.\" As I answered, it struck me that she might have formed some  intention of appealing to me for assistance or advice, and that I ought  to spare her a possible disappointment by warning her of my approaching  absence from home.  So I added, \"But to-morrow I shall be away from  London for some time.  I am going into the country.\"    \"Where?\" she asked.  \"North or south?\"    \"North--to Cumberland.\"    \"Cumberland!\" she repeated the word tenderly.  \"Ah! wish I was going  there too.  I was once happy in Cumberland.\"    I tried again to lift the veil that hung between this woman and me.    \"Perhaps you were born,\" I said, \"in the beautiful Lake country.\"    \"No,\" she answered.  \"I was born in Hampshire; but I once went to  school for a little while in Cumberland.  Lakes? I don't remember any  lakes.  It's Limmeridge village, and Limmeridge House, I should like to  see again.\"    It was my turn now to stop suddenly.  In the excited state of my  curiosity, at that moment, the chance reference to Mr. Fairlie's place  of residence, on the lips of my strange companion, staggered me with  astonishment.    \"Did you hear anybody calling after us?\" she asked, looking up and down  the road affrightedly, the instant I stopped.    \"No, no.  I was only struck by the name of Limmeridge House.  I heard  it mentioned by some Cumberland people a few days since.\"    \"Ah! not my people.  Mrs. Fairlie is dead; and her husband is dead; and  their little girl may be married and gone away by this time.  I can't  say who lives at Limmeridge now.  If any more are left there of that  name, I only know I love them for Mrs. Fairlie's sake.\"    She seemed about to say more; but while she was speaking, we came  within view of the turnpike, at the top of the Avenue Road.  Her hand  tightened round my arm, and she looked anxiously at the gate before us.    \"Is the turnpike man looking out?\" she asked.    He was not looking out; no one else was near the place when we passed  through the gate.  The sight of the gas-lamps and houses seemed to  agitate her, and to make her impatient.    \"This is London,\" she said.  \"Do you see any carriage I can get? I am  tired and frightened.  I want to shut myself in and be driven away.\"    I explained to her that we must walk a little further to get to a  cab-stand, unless we were fortunate enough to meet with an empty  vehicle; and then tried to resume the subject of Cumberland.  It was  useless.  That idea of shutting herself in, and being driven away, had  now got full possession of her mind.  She could think and talk of  nothing else.    We had hardly proceeded a third of the way down the Avenue Road when I  saw a cab draw up at a house a few doors below us, on the opposite side  of the way.  A gentleman got out and let himself in at the garden door.  I hailed the cab, as the driver mounted the box again.  When we crossed  the road, my companion's impatience increased to such an extent that  she almost forced me to run.    \"It's so late,\" she said.  \"I am only in a hurry because it's so late.\"    \"I can't take you, sir, if you're not going towards Tottenham Court  Road,\" said the driver civilly, when I opened the cab door. \"My horse  is dead beat, and I can't get him no further than the stable.\"    \"Yes, yes.  That will do for me.  I'm going that way--I'm going that  way.\" She spoke with breathless eagerness, and pressed by me into the  cab.    I had assured myself that the man was sober as well as civil before I  let her enter the vehicle.  And now, when she was seated inside, I  entreated her to let me see her set down safely at her destination.    \"No, no, no,\" she said vehemently.  \"I'm quite safe, and quite happy  now.  If you are a gentleman, remember your promise.  Let him drive on  till I stop him.  Thank you--oh! thank you, thank you!\"    My hand was on the cab door.  She caught it in hers, kissed it, and  pushed it away.  The cab drove off at the same moment--I started into  the road, with some vague idea of stopping it again, I hardly knew  why--hesitated from dread of frightening and distressing her--called,  at last, but not loudly enough to attract the driver's attention.  The  sound of the wheels grew fainter in the distance--the cab melted into  the black shadows on the road--the woman in white was gone.      Ten minutes or more had passed.  I was still on the same side of the  way; now mechanically walking forward a few paces; now stopping again  absently.  At one moment I found myself doubting the reality of my own  adventure; at another I was perplexed and distressed by an uneasy sense  of having done wrong, which yet left me confusedly ignorant of how I  could have done right.  I hardly knew where I was going, or what I  meant to do next; I was conscious of nothing but the confusion of my  own thoughts, when I was abruptly recalled to myself--awakened, I might  almost say--by the sound of rapidly approaching wheels close behind me.    I was on the dark side of the road, in the thick shadow of some garden  trees, when I stopped to look round.  On the opposite and lighter side  of the way, a short distance below me, a policeman was strolling along  in the direction of the Regent's Park.    The carriage passed me--an open chaise driven by two men.    \"Stop!\" cried one.  \"There's a policeman.  Let's ask him.\"    The horse was instantly pulled up, a few yards beyond the dark place  where I stood.    \"Policeman!\" cried the first speaker.  \"Have you seen a woman pass this  way?\"    \"What sort of woman, sir?\"    \"A woman in a lavender-coloured"]]]
