Amidst the overwhelming majesty  of Nature, and the stupendous objects she presents at every step,  the traveller is little disposed to record in his journal matters  which relate only to himself, and the ordinary details of life.    I composed a very brief itinerary during the course of my  excursions on the rivers of South America, and in my long journeys  by land. I regularly described (and almost always on the spot) the  visits I made to the summits of volcanoes, or mountains remarkable  for their height; but the entries in my journal were interrupted  whenever I resided in a town, or when other occupations prevented  me from continuing a work which I considered as having only a  secondary interest. Whenever I wrote in my journal, I had no other  motive than the preservation of some of those fugitive ideas which  present themselves to a naturalist, whose life is almost wholly  passed in the open air. I wished to make a temporary collection of  such facts as I had not then leisure to class, and note down the  first impressions, whether agreeable or painful, which I received  from nature or from man. Far from thinking at the time that those  pages thus hurriedly written would form the basis of an extensive  work to be offered to the public, it appeared to me, that my  journal, though it might furnish certain data useful to science,  would present very few of those incidents, the recital of which  constitutes the principal charm of an itinerary.    The difficulties I have experienced since my return, in the  composition of a considerable number of treatises, for the purpose  of making known certain classes of phenomena, insensibly overcame  my repugnance to write the narrative of my journey. In undertaking  this task, I have been guided by the advice of many estimable  persons, who honour me with their friendship. I also perceived that  such a preference is given to this sort of composition, that  scientific men, after having presented in an isolated form the  account of their researches on the productions, the manners, and  the political state of the countries through which they have  passed, imagine that they have not fulfilled their engagements with  the public, till they have written their itinerary.    An historical narrative embraces two very distinct objects; the  greater or the less important events connected with the purpose of  the traveller, and the observations he has made during his journey.  The unity of composition also, which distinguishes good works from  those on an ill-constructed plan, can be strictly observed only  when the traveller describes what has passed under his own eye; and  when his principal attention has been fixed less on scientific  observations than on the manners of different people and the great  phenomena of nature. Now, the most faithful picture of manners is  that which best displays the relations of men towards each other.  The character of savage or civilized life is portrayed either in  the obstacles a traveller meets with, or in the sensations he  feels. It is the traveller himself whom we continually desire to  see in contact with the objects which surround him; and his  narration interests us the more, when a local tint is diffused over  the description of a country and its inhabitants. Such is the  source of the interest excited by the history of those early  navigators, who, impelled by intrepidity rather than by science,  struggled against the elements in their search for the discovery of  a new world. Such is the irresistible charm attached to the fate of  that enterprising traveller (Mungo Park.), who, full of enthusiasm  and energy, penetrated alone into the centre of Africa, to discover  amidst barbarous nations the traces of ancient civilization.    In proportion as travels have been undertaken by persons whose  views have been directed to researches into descriptive natural  history, geography, or political economy, itineraries have partly  lost that unity of composition, and that simplicity which  characterized those of former ages. It is now become scarcely  possible to connect so many different materials with the detail of  other events; and that part of a traveller's narrative which we may  call dramatic gives way to dissertations merely descriptive. The  numerous class of readers who prefer agreeable amusement to solid  instruction, have not gained by the exchange; and I am afraid that  the temptation will not be great to follow the course of travellers  who are incumbered with scientific instruments and collections.    To give greater variety to my work, I have often interrupted the  historical narrative by descriptions. I first represent phenomena  in the order in which they appeared; and I afterwards consider them  in the whole of their individual relations. This mode has been  successfully followed in the journey of M. de Saussure, whose most  valuable work has contributed more than any other to the  advancement of science. Often, amidst dry discussions on  meteorology, it contains many charming descriptions; such as those  of the modes of life of the inhabitants of the mountains, the  dangers of hunting the chamois, and the sensations felt on the  summit of the higher Alps.    There are details of ordinary life which it may be useful to note  in an itinerary, because they serve for the guidance of those who  afterwards journey through the same countries. I have preserved a  few, but have suppressed the greater part of those personal  incidents which present no particular interest, and which can be  rendered amusing only by the perfection of style.    With respect to the country which has been the object of my  investigations, I am fully sensible of the great advantages enjoyed  by persons who travel in Greece, Egypt, the banks of the Euphrates,  and the islands of the Pacific, in comparison with those who  traverse the continent of America. In the Old World, nations and  the distinctions of their civilization form the principal points in  the picture; in the New World, man and his productions almost  disappear amidst the stupendous display of wild and gigantic  nature. The human race in the New World presents only a few  remnants of indigenous hordes, slightly advanced in civilization;  or it exhibits merely the uniformity of manners and institutions  transplanted by European colonists to foreign shores. Information  which relates to the history of our species, to the various forms  of government, to monuments of art, to places full of great  remembrances, affect us far more than descriptions of those vast  solitudes which seem destined only for the development of vegetable  life, and to be the domain of wild animals. The savages of America,  who have been the objects of so many systematic reveries, and on  whom M. Volney has lately published some accurate and intelligent  observations, inspire less interest since celebrated navigators  have made known to us the inhabitants of the South Sea islands, in  whose character we find a striking mixture of perversity and  meekness. The state of half-civilization existing among those  islanders gives a peculiar charm to the description of their  manners. A king, followed by a numerous suite, presents the fruits  of his orchard; or a funeral is performed amidst the shade of the  lofty forest. Such pictures, no doubt, have more attraction than  those which pourtray the solemn gravity of the inhabitant of the  banks of the Missouri or the Maranon.    America offers an ample field for the labours of the naturalist. On  no other part of the globe is he called upon more powerfully by  nature to raise himself to general ideas on the cause of phenomena  and their mutual connection. To say nothing of that luxuriance of  vegetation, that eternal spring of organic life, those climates  varying by stages as we climb the flanks of the Cordilleras, and  those majestic rivers which a celebrated writer (M. Chateaubriand.)  has described with such graceful accuracy, the resources which the  New World affords for the study of geology and natural philosophy  in general have been long since acknowledged. Happy the traveller  who may cherish the hope that he has availed himself of the  advantages of his position, and that he has added some new facts to  the mass of those previously acquired!    Since I left America, one of those great revolutions, which at  certain periods agitate the human race, has broken out in the  Spanish colonies, and seems to prepare new destinies for a  population of fourteen millions of inhabitants, spreading from the  southern to the northern hemisphere, from the shores of the Rio de  la Plata and Chile to the remotest part of Mexico. Deep  resentments, excited by colonial legislation, and fostered by  mistrustful policy, have stained with blood regions which had  enjoyed, for the space of nearly three centuries, what I will not  call happiness but uninterrupted peace. At Quito several of the  most virtuous and enlightened citizens have perished, victims of  devotion to their country. While I am giving the description of  regions, the remembrance of which is so dear to me, I continually  light on places which recall to my mind the loss of a friend.    When we reflect on the great political agitations of the New World,  we observe that the Spanish Americans are by no means in so  favourable a position as the inhabitants of the United States; the  latter having been prepared for independence by the long enjoyment  of constitutional liberty. Internal dissensions are chiefly to be  dreaded in regions where civilization is but slightly rooted, and  where, from the influence of climate, forests may soon regain their  empire over cleared lands if their culture be abandoned. It may  also be feared that, during a long series of years, no foreign  traveller will be enabled to traverse all the countries which I  have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6329"],[0,"Catalogue of British Columbia Birds (#5)"],[1,"OWL.      _Asio accipitrinus_ (Pall.).
