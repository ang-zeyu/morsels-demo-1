Oft have I dreamed of thee! whose glorious name    Who knows not, knows not man's divinest lore:    And now I view thee, 'tis, alas! with shame    That I in feeblest accents must adore.    When I recount thy worshippers of yore    I tremble, and can only bend the knee;    Nor raise my voice, nor vainly dare to soar,    But gaze beneath thy cloudy canopy    In silent joy to think at last I look on thee!    The city of Delphi was the seat of the celebrated temple and  oracle of that name. Here the Pythia, the priestess of Apollo,  pronounced the prophetic responses, in extempore prose or verse;  and here the Pythian Games were celebrated in honor of Apollo.      Here, thought-entranced, we wander, where of old    From Delphi's chasm the mystic vapor rose,    And trembling nations heard their doom foretold    By the dread spirit throned 'midst rocks and snows.    Though its rich fanes be blended with the dust,    And silence now the hallowed haunt possess,    Still is the scene of ancient rites august,    Magnificent in mountain loneliness;    Still Inspiration hovers o'er the ground,    Where Greece her councils held, her Pythian victors crowned.      --MRS. HEMANS.    8. Boeo'tia.--Boeotia, lying to the east of Phocis, bordering  on the Euri'pus, or \"Euboe'an Sea,\" a narrow strait which separates  it from the Island of Euboe'a, and touching the Corinthian Gulf  on the south-west, is mostly one large basin enclosed by mountain  ranges, and having a soil exceedingly fertile. It was the most  thickly settled part of Greece; it abounded in cities of historic  interest, of which Thebes, the capital, was the chief--whose walls  were built, according to the fable, to the sound of the Muses:      With their ninefold symphonies      There the chiming Muses throng;    Stone on stone the walls arise      To the choral Music-song.      --SCHILLER.    Boeotia was the scene of many of the legends celebrated by the  poets, and especially of those upon which were founded the plays  of the Greek tragedians. Near a fountain on Mount Cithae'ron, on  its southern border, the hunter Actae'on, having been changed into  a stag by the goddess Diana, was hunted down and killed by his  own hounds. Pen'theus, an early king of Thebes, having ascended  Cithaeron to witness the orgies of the Bacchanals, was torn in  pieces by his own mother and aunts, to whom Bacchus made him  appear as a wild beast. On this same mountain range also occurred  the exposure of OEd'ipus, the hero of the most famous tragedy of  Sophocles. Near the Corinthian Gulf was Mount Hel'icon, sacred  to Apollo and the Muses. Its slopes and valleys were renowned  for their fertility; it had its sacred grove, and near it was  the famous fountain of Aganip'pe, which was believed to inspire  with oracular powers those who drank of its waters. Nearer the  summit was the fountain Hippocre'ne, which is said to have burst  forth when the winged horse Peg'asus, the favorite of the Muses,  struck the ground with his hoofs, and which Venus, accompanied  by her constant attendants, the doves, delighted to visit. Here,  we are told,      Her darling doves, light-hovering round their Queen,    Dipped their red beaks in rills from Hippocrene.    [Footnote: Always Hip-po-cre'ne in prose; but it is    allowable to contract it into three syllables in poetry,    as in the example above.]    It was here, also--                       near this fresh fount,    On pleasant Helicon's umbrageous mount--    that occurred the celebrated contest between the nine daughters  of Pie'rus, king of E-ma'thi-a (the ancient name of Macedonia),  and the nine Muses. It is said that \"at the song of the daughters  of Pierus the sky became dark, and all nature was put out of  harmony; but at that of the Muses the heavens themselves, the  stars, the sea, and the rivers stood motionless, and Helicon  swelled up with delight, so that its summit reached the sky.\"  The Muses then, having turned the presumptuous maidens into  chattering magpies, first took the name of Pi-er'i-des, from  Pieria, their natal region.    9. Attica.--Bordering Boeotia on the south-east was the district  of Attica, nearly in the form of a triangle, having two of its  sides washed by the sea, and the other--the northern--shut off  from the east of Central Greece by the mountain range of Cithaeron  on the north-west, and Par'nes on the east. Its other noted  mountains were Pentel'icus (sometimes called Mende'li), so  celebrated for its quarries of beautiful marble, and Hymet'tus,  celebrated for its excellent honey, and the broad belt of flowers  at its base, which scented the air with their delicious perfume.  It could boast of its chief city, the favored seat of the goddess  Minerva--      Athens, the eye of Greece, mother of arts    And eloquence--    as surpassing all other cities in beauty and magnificence, and  in the great number of its illustrious citizens. Yet the soil  of Attica was, on the whole, exceedingly barren, with the exception  of a few very fertile spots; but olive groves abounded, and the  olive was the most valuable product.    The general sterility of Attica was the great safety of her people  in their early history. \"It drove them abroad; it filled them  with a spirit of activity, which loved to grapple with danger  and difficulty; it told them that, if they would maintain themselves  in the dignity which became them, they must regard the resources of  their own land as nothing, and those of other countries as their  own.\" Added to this, the situation of Attica marked it out in an  eminent manner for a commercial country; and it became distinguished  beyond all the other states of Greece for its extensive commercial  relations, while its climate was deemed the most favorable of  all the regions of the civilized world for the physical and  intellectual development of man. It was called \"a sunny land,\"  and, notwithstanding the infertility of its soil, it was full  of picturesque beauty. The poet BYRON, in his apostrophe to Greece,  makes many striking and beautiful allusions to the Attica of his  own time:      Yet are thy skies as blue, thy crags as wild;    Sweet are thy groves, and verdant are thy fields,    Thine olive ripe as when Minerva smiled,    And still its honeyed wealth Hymettus yields.    There the blithe bee his fragrant fortress builds,    The freeborn wanderer of thy mountain air;    Apollo still thy long, long summer gilds,    Still in his beam Mendeli's marbles glare;    Art, Glory, Freedom fail, but Nature still is fair.    10. Entering now upon the isthmus which leads into Southern Greece,  we find the little state of Corinth, with its famous city of the  same name, keeping guard over the narrow pass, with one foot on  the Corinthian Gulf and the other on the Saron'ic, thereby commanding  both the Ionian and AEge'an seas, controlling the commerce that  passed between them, and holding the keys of Peloponnesus. It  was a mountainous and barren region, with the exception of a small  plain north-west of the city. Thus situated, Corinth early became  the seat of opulence and the arts, which rendered her the ornament  of Greece. On a lofty eminence overhanging the city, forming a  conspicuous object at a great distance, was her famous citadel--so  important as to be styled by Philip of Macedon \"the fetters of  Greece.\" Rising abruptly nearly two thousand feet above the  surrounding plain, the hill itself, in its natural defences, is  the strongest mountain fortress in Europe.      The whirlwind's wrath, the earthquake's shock,    Have left untouched her hoary rock,    The key-stone of a land which still,    Though fallen, looks proudly on that hill,    The landmark to the double tide    That purpling rolls on either side,    As if their waters chafed to meet,    Yet pause and crouch beneath her feet.      --BYRON.    The ascent to the citadel, in the days of Corinthian glory, was  lined on both sides with temples and altars; but temples and  altars are gone, and citadel and city alike are now in ruins.  Antip'ater of Sidon describes the city as a scene of desolation  after it had been conquered, plundered, and its walls thrown down  by the Romans, 146 B.C. Although the city was partially rebuilt,  the description is fully applicable to its present condition. A  modern traveller thus describes the site of the ancient city:      The hoarse wind sighs around the mouldering walls    Of the vast theatre, like the deep roar    Of distant waves, or the tumultuous rush    Of multitudes: the lichen creeps along    Each yawning crevice, and the wild-flower hangs    Its long festoons around each crumbling stone.    The window's arch and massive buttress glow    With time's deep tints, whilst cypress shadows wave    On high, and spread a melancholy gloom.      Silent forever is the voice    Of Tragedy and Eloquence. In climes    Far distant, and beneath a cloudy sky,    The echo of their harps is heard; but all    The soul-subduing energy is fled.      --HAYGARTH.    11. Adjoining the Corinthian territory on the west, and extending  about sixty-five miles along the southern coast of the Corinthian  Gulf, was Acha'ia, mountainous in the interior; but its coast  region for the most part was level, exposed to inundations, and  without a single harbor of any size. Hence the Achae'ans were never  famous for maritime enterprise. Of the eleven Achaean cities that  formed the celebrated Achaean league, Pal'trae (now Patras') alone  survives. Si'cy-on, on the eastern border of Achaia, was at times  an independent state.    12. South of Achaia was the central region of Arcadia, surrounded  by a ring of mountains, and completely encompassed by the other  states of the Peloponnesus. Next to Laconia it was the largest  of the ancient divisions of Greece, and the most picturesque and  beautiful portion (not unlike Switzerland in its mountain  character), and without either seaports or navigable rivers. It  was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6852"],[0,"Venus in Furs (#5)"],[1," if it were an Aspasia,  with another revolts us. We are jealous as is our God. For example,  we have made a term abuse out of the name of the glorious Phryne.    \"We prefer one of Holbein's meagre, pallid virgins, which is wholly  ours to an antique Venus, no matter how divinely beautiful she is,  but who loves Anchises to-day, Paris to-morrow, Adonis the day after.  And if nature triumphs in us so that we give our whole glowing,  passionate devotion to such a woman, her serene joy of life appears  to us as something demonic and cruel, and we read into our happiness  a sin which we must expiate.\"    \"So you too are one of those who rave about modern women, those  miserable hysterical feminine creatures who don't appreciate a real  man in their somnambulistic search for some dream-man and masculine  ideal. Amid tears and convulsions they daily outrage their Christian  duties; they cheat and are cheated; they always seek again and choose  and reject; they are never happy, and never give happiness. They  accuse fate instead of calmly confessing that they want to love and  live as Helen and Aspasia lived. Nature admits of no permanence in  the relation between man and woman.\"    \"But, my dear lady--\"    \"Let me finish. It is only man's egoism which wants to keep woman  like some buried treasure. All endeavors to introduce permanence in  love, the most changeable thing in this changeable human existence,  have gone shipwreck in spite of religious ceremonies, vows, and  legalities. Can you deny that our Christian world has given itself  over to corruption?\"    \"But--\"    \"But you are about to say, the individual who rebels against the  arrangements of society is ostracized, branded, stoned. So be it. I  am willing to take the risk; my principles are very pagan. I will  live my own life as it pleases me. I am willing to do without your  hypocritical respect; I prefer to be happy. The inventors of the  Christian marriage have done well, simultaneously to invent  immortality. I, however, have no wish to live eternally. When with  my last breath everything as far as Wanda von Dunajew is concerned  comes to an end here below, what does it profit me whether my pure  spirit joins the choirs of angels, or whether my dust goes into the  formation of new beings? Shall I belong to one man whom I don't love,  merely because I have once loved him? No, I do not renounce; I love  everyone who pleases me, and give happiness to everyone who loves me.  Is that ugly? No, it is more beautiful by far, than if cruelly I  enjoy the tortures, which my beauty excites, and virtuously reject  the poor fellow who is pining away for me. I am young, rich, and  beautiful, and I live serenely for the sake of pleasure and  enjoyment.\"    While she was speaking her eyes sparkled roguishly, and I had taken  hold of her hands without exactly knowing what to do with them, but  being a genuine dilettante I hastily let go of them again.    \"Your frankness,\" I said, \"delights me, and not it alone--\"    My confounded dilettantism again throttled me as though there were  a rope around my neck.    \"You were about to say--\"    \"I was about to say--I was--I am sorry--I interrupted you.\"    \"How, so?\"    A long pause. She is doubtless engaging in a monologue, which  translated into my language would be comprised in the single word,  \"donkey.\"    \"If I may ask,\" I finally began, \"how did you arrive at these--these  conclusions?\"    \"Quite simply, my father was an intelligent man. From my cradle onward  I was surrounded by replicas of ancient art; at ten years of age I  read _Gil Blas_, at twelve _La Pucelle_. Where others had  Hop-o'-my-thumb, Bluebeard, Cinderella, as childhood friends, mine  were Venus and Apollo, Hercules and Lackoon. My husband's personality  was filled with serenity and sunlight. Not even the incurable illness  which fell upon him soon after our marriage could long cloud his brow.  On the very night of his death he took me in his arms, and during the  many months when he lay dying in his wheel chair, he often said  jokingly to me: 'Well, have you already picked out a lover?' I blushed  with shame. 'Don't deceive me,' he added on one occasion, 'that would  seem ugly to me, but pick out an attractive lover, or preferably  several. You are a splendid woman, but still half a child, and you  need toys.'    \"I suppose, I hardly need tell you that during his life time I had  no lover; but it was through him that I have become what I am, a  woman of Greece.\"    \"A goddess,\" I interrupted.    \"Which one,\" she smiled.    \"Venus.\"    She threatened me with her finger and knitted her brows. \"Perhaps,  even a 'Venus in Furs.' Watch out, I have a large, very large fur,  with which I could cover you up entirely, and I have a mind to catch  you in it as in a net.\"    \"Do you believe,\" I said quickly, for an idea which seemed good, in  spite of its conventionality and triteness, flashed into my head, \"do  you believe that your theories could be carried into execution at the  present time, that Venus would be permitted to stray with impunity  among our railroads and telegraphs in all her undraped beauty and  serenity?\"    \"_Undraped_, of course not, but in furs,\" she replied smiling, \"would  you care to see mine?\"    \"And then--\"    \"What then?\"    \"Beautiful, free, serene, and happy human beings, such as the Greeks  were, are only possible when it is permitted to have _slaves_ who will  perform the prosaic tasks of every day for them and above all else  labor for them.\"    \"Of course,\" she replied playfully, \"an Olympian divinity, such as  I am, requires a whole army of slaves. Beware of me!\"    \"Why?\"    I myself was frightened at the hardiness with which I uttered this  \"why\"; it did not startle her in the least.    She drew back her lips a little so that her small white teeth became  visible, and then said lightly, as if she were discussing some  trifling matter, \"Do you want to be my slave?\"    \"There is no equality in love,\" I replied solemnly. \"Whenever it is  a matter of choice for me of ruling or being ruled, it seems much  more satisfactory to me to be the slave of a beautiful woman. But  where shall I find the woman who knows how to rule, calmly, full of  self-confidence, even harshly, and not seek to gain her power by  means of petty nagging?\"    \"Oh, that might not be so difficult.\"    \"You think--\"    \"I--for instance--\" she laughed and leaned far back--\"I have a real  talent for despotism--I also have the necessary furs--but last night  you were really seriously afraid of me!\"    \"Quite seriously.\"    \"And now?\"    \"Now, I am more afraid of you than ever!\"    We are together every day, I and--Venus; we are together a great  deal. We breakfast in my honey-suckle arbor, and have tea in her  little sitting-room. I have an opportunity to unfold all my small,  very small talents. Of what use would have been my study of all the  various sciences, my playing at all the arts, if I were unable in the  case of a pretty, little woman--    But this woman is by no means little; in fact she impresses me  tremendously. I made a drawing of her to-day, and felt particularly  clearly, how inappropriate the modern way of dressing is for a  cameo-head like hers. The configuration of her face has little of the  Roman, but much of the Greek.    Sometimes I should like to paint her as Psyche, and then again as  Astarte. It depends upon the expression in her eyes, whether it is  vaguely dreamy, or half-consuming, filled with tired desire.  She, however, insists that it be a portrait-likeness.    I shall make her a present of furs.    How could I have any doubts? If not for her, for whom would princely  furs be suitable?           *       *       *       *       *    I was with her yesterday evening, reading the _Roman Elegies_ to her.  Then I laid the book aside, and improvised something for her. She  seemed pleased; rather more than that, she actually hung upon my  words, and her bosom heaved.    Or was I mistaken?    The rain beat in melancholy fashion on the window-panes, the fire  crackled in the fireplace in wintery comfort. I felt quite at home  with her, and for a moment lost all my fear of this beautiful woman;  I kissed her hand, and she permitted it.    Then I sat down at her feet and read a short poem I had written for  her.      VENUS IN FURS.      \"Place thy foot upon thy slave,    Oh thou, half of hell, half of dreams;    Among the shadows, dark and grave,    Thy extended body softly gleams.\"    And--so on. This time I really got beyond the first stanza. At her  request I gave her the poem in the evening, keeping no copy. And now  as I am writing this down in my diary I can only remember the first  stanza.    I am filled with a very curious sensation. I don't believe that I am  in love with Wanda; I am sure that at our first meeting, I felt  nothing of the lightning-like flashes of passion. But I feel how her  extraordinary, really divine beauty is gradually winding magic snares  about me. It isn't any spiritual sympathy which is growing in me; it  is a physical subjection, coming on slowly, but for that reason more  absolutely.    I suffer under it more and more each day, and she--she merely smiles.           *       *       *       *       *    Without any provocation she suddenly said to me to-day: \"You  interest me. Most men are very commonplace, without verve or poetry.  In you there is a certain depth and capacity for enthusiasm and a  deep seriousness, which delight me. I might learn to love you.\"    After a short but severe shower we went out together to the meadow  and the statue of Venus. All about us the earth steamed; mists rose  up toward heaven like clouds of incense; a shattered rainbow still  hovered in the air. The trees were still shedding drops, but sparrows  and finches were already hopping from twig to twig. They are  twittering gaily, as if very much pleased at something. Everything  is filled with a fresh fragrance. We cannot"]]]
