Still the facts had to stand unless refuted by the  Scriptures, in which case he would be first to cast his books into the  fires.    Obviously the diet could not at this moment disprove his works by the  Bible. There was a consultation. The interrogator turned to Luther.  \"Give us a direct answer--one without horns. Will you or will you not  recant your errors?\"                               Neither Right nor Safe    The Spanish guards were mentally stacking faggots around the lonely  little figure in the middle of the room. Princes, nobles, and the Holy  Roman Emperor leaned forward to catch his words.    \"Since Your Majesty and Your Lordships want a direct reply, I will  answer without horns or teeth,\" he began quietly.    The spectators looked at each other significantly, then back to the  earnest friar. Confidence was returning and his voice carried plainly to  all corners of the room.    \"Unless convinced by the testimony of Scripture or right reason--for I  trust neither the pope nor councils inasmuch as they have often erred  and contradicted one another--I am bound in conscience, held captive by  the Word of God in the Scriptures I have quoted. I neither can nor will  recant anything, for it is neither right nor safe to act against  conscience. God help me! Amen.\"    There was silence for an instant. Then pandemonium broke loose. The  interrogator tried to restore order but the emperor walked out and the  meeting adjourned. Luther was escorted back to his rooms by the admiring  populace. Nobles who had been on the fringe now openly praised the  courageous preacher and vowed their support. During the night warning  notices were surreptitiously posted on the doors of his enemies.    Charles summoned the electors and princes the following day to decide  what should be done. His own impulse to condemn Luther right away was  restrained because he needed the good will of the Germans in other  measures coming before the diet. A plan was evolved whereby a select  group of theologians would call on Luther and try to effect a  reconciliation through persuasion. The discussion always bogged down  when Luther insisted he must be persuaded on the basis of Scripture.    Having received a twenty-one-day safe-conduct Luther set out for  Wittenberg on April 26. The diet closed officially on May 25, and the  next day, following a rump session of prejudiced nobles, the emperor  signed the Edict of Worms. According to it, Luther was the devil himself  in a monk's habit. He was to be seized on sight and turned over to the  emperor--an outlaw of the church and the state.                                      DRASTIC CHANGES                               Wartburg to Wittenberg    Fortunately for Luther there was more than noisy adulation among the  people. A few sober minds knew how relentless the papal wolves would be  in tracking him down after the safe-conduct expired, and so a  \"kidnapping\" and removal to a safe place was planned.    Luther made a detour along the road to Wittenberg in order to visit  relatives at MÃ¶hra. For months the outside world knew only that he had  been captured near there in the Thuringian forest by a band of knights.  Many lamented him as dead, but gradually the flow of thorny letters to  his adversaries and the new treatises rolling from the press allayed  their fears.    By a circuitous route Luther had been conveyed to the Wartburg, an  ancient fortress-castle near Eisenach. He arrived on May 4 and, with the  exception of short trips into the forest and to near-by villages, did  not leave for seven months. To outward appearances he was Junker George,  a carefree, bearded knight with sword swinging impressively at his side.  The secret was well kept and at the outset even the elector, who  authorized the masquerade, did not know Luther's whereabouts.    Luther chafed at his forced inactivity, and, ever the monk, fell to  contemplation and examination of himself. Could past generations and  earlier scholars have been so completely out of step with the gospel?  Could a mere friar be right against them all? Might he not be in error  and drag many others to eternal damnation?        [Illustration: (uncaptioned)]    Hard work helped take his mind off his problems. During his stay in the  Wartburg, in addition to correspondence and pamphlets, he authored a  work on confession, expositions on several Psalms, a commentary on the  Magnificat, had a volume of sermons on the Epistles and Gospels well  underway, and had translated the entire New Testament into German.    Prayer and study restored his conviction. To doubt, or even to remain  silent was like going against conscience--neither right nor safe. With  conviction came a sense of divine commission. When events called him  back into the world again he went courageously and with determination.  He was a revolutionary, but a conservative one. That quality is what  took him back to Wittenberg.                              From Freedom to License    So often a new movement suffers from overenthusiasm. The Reformation was  no exception in this respect. Zealots took the usual shortcut from  bondage to freedom by way of turmoil instead of restrained orderly  procedure.    In parts of Germany the old ways were thrown off hastily. Organs,  paintings, and statues were thrown from the churches, vestments were  discarded, bread and wine were both administered to the laity, priests  married, nuns took husbands, monastic vows were renounced, various forms  of the mass were discontinued, priests and worshipers who persisted in  the traditional forms were attacked.    Rumors of violent acts reached the Wartburg. Luther, still in the guise  of Junker George, made a hurried trip to Wittenberg early in December,  1521. Matters there had not yet reached the unrestrained stage which  they later assumed. Nevertheless he cautioned the people in a \"warning  against riot and rebellion,\" written on his return to the Wartburg.    In it he reasoned that reform is not so much a matter of externals as of  faith. Breaking up the furniture in a church does not change the heart  of a man. Vandalism is by no means a sign of repentance and trust in  God--in fact it approaches the old form of seeking favor through works.  Giving wine as well as bread in the Lord's Supper is not as important as  the spiritual attitude of the communicant.    Finally the tumult in Wittenberg reached the point where he had to step  in, so--in the face of the imperial ban--he returned on March 6, 1522.  Insisting that no drastic change should be made until, through  re-education, those affected requested it as a matter of faith, he  restored order in the university city in a remarkably short time.    The peasants meanwhile took the shortcut to freedom, too, in a series of  bloody uprisings. Chafing under their bondage to the nobles, they  adapted Luther's \"free lord of all\" statement to their own demands for  social reform. Luther preached the Christian duty of submission to  lawful authority, but the peasants ravaged and plundered until finally  defeated in 1525. It was a dark hour in the Reformation.                               Pigtails on the Pillow    Wittenberg, June 14--Katherine von Bora, 26, late of the Cistercian  nunnery at Nimbschen, and Martin Luther, 42, professor of Bible at the  local university, were married last night at a simple ceremony in the  Black Cloister. Dr. John Bugenhagen officiated. In attendance were  Artist Lucas Cranach and Mrs. Cranach; Dr. Justus Jonas, prior of Castle  Church; and John Apel, professor of law at the university....    If there had been newspapers in 1525, Luther's wedding might have been  announced to the public in this way. However, newspapers weren't to  appear until much later, and the lack of publicity gave gossips and  slanderers choice opportunity to vilify the former monk and nun. The  malicious stories were partly offset by a public ceremony, complete with  a special service in the town church, a wedding dinner in the cloister,  and a dance at the town hall on June 27.    The wedding was a direct result of Luther's reform teachings. He  disliked the monastic system because men and women sought merit before  God through restraints and vows rather than depending upon grace.  Celibacy, he had written earlier, is not founded on Scripture but  marriage is. These teachings found their way into many cloisters and  convents, among them the one at Nimbschen where Katherine von Bora, at  the age of sixteen, had been received into the Cistercian Order.    She and eleven other nuns sought Luther's assistance in effecting a plan  of escape. Although he had no idea of what it would involve for him  personally, he arranged for them to be smuggled out of the convent in  empty fish barrels on the day before Easter in 1523. The plan succeeded  and some of the nuns came to Wittenberg where they found homes,  husbands, or new positions. Two years later Kathie was the only one not  permanently cared for despite Luther's several attempts at matchmaking.  Then the spunky miss hinted rather boldly that the Reformer himself  would be an acceptable husband and he resolved to take the course which  he had urged on so many others.    It was strange for one accustomed to solitude. \"Formerly at the table I  was alone,\" he wrote, \"now I am with someone. When I awaken I see a pair  of pigtails on the pillow which were not there before.\"                            The Cloister Becomes a Home    Marriage probably extended Luther's life for a number of years.  Previously he and his dog enjoyed an irregular sort of existence in the  Black Cloister. Dishes were covered with dust, the bed hadn't been made  in over a year, his clothes were in disorder. Sometimes Luther forgot  his meals altogether and at other times stuffed himself.    The vigor with which his industrious wife established order can be  imagined by his reference to her as \"my lord"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53506"],[0,"A Collection of KachÃ¡ri Folk-Tales and Rhymes (#5)"],[1," \"Ãng nang hÃ¢t-sing-bÃ¢ be khorÃ¢ng-khÃ´  khiÂ­thÃ¢nu hÃ¢iÃ¢.
