Rivers which have a  course parallel to the coast, and are nowhere farther distant from it  than five or six nautical miles, characterize the whole of the shore  between the Orinoco and the Amazon.    Ten leagues distant from Cape Barima, the great bed of the Orinoco is  divided for the first time into two branches of two thousand toises in  breadth. They are known by the Indian names of Zacupana and Imataca.  The first, which is the northernmost, communicates on the west of the  islands Congrejos and del Burro with the bocas chicas of Lauran,  Nuina, and Mariusas. As the Isla del Burro disappears in the time of  great inundations, it is unhappily not suited to fortifications. The  southern bank of the brazo Imataca is cut by a labyrinth of little  channels, into which the Rio Imataca and the Rio Aquire flow. A long  series of little granitic hills rises in the fertile savannahs between  the Imataca and the Cuyuni; it is a prolongation of the Cordilleras of  Parima, which, bounding the horizon south of Angostura, forms the  celebrated cataracts of the Rio Caroni, and approaches the Orinoco  like a projecting cape near the little fort of Vieja Guyana. The  populous missions of the Caribbee and Guiana Indians, governed by the  Catalonian Capuchins, lie near the sources of the Imataca and the  Aquire. The easternmost of these missions are those of Miamu, Camamu,  and Palmar, situate in a hilly country, which extends towards  Tupuquen, Santa Maria, and the Villa de Upata. Going up the Rio  Aquire, and directing your course across the pastures towards the  south, you reach the mission of Belem de Tumeremo, and thence the  confluence of the Curumu with the Rio Cuyuni, where the Spanish post  or destacamento de Cuyuni was formerly established. I enter into this  topographical detail because the Rio Cuyuni, or Cuduvini, runs  parallel to the Orinoco from west to east, through an extent of 2.5 or  3 degrees of longitude,* and furnishes an excellent natural boundary  between the territory of Caracas and that of English Guiana. (*  Including the Rio Juruam, one of the principal branches of the Cuyuni.  The Dutch military post is five leagues west of the union of Cuyuni  with the Essequibo, where the former river receives the Mazuruni.)    The two great branches of the Orinoco, the Zacupana and the Imataca,  remain separate for fourteen leagues: on going up farther, the waters  of the river are found united* in a single channel extremely broad. (*  At this point of union are found two villages of Guaraons. They also  bear the names of Imataca and Zacupana.) This channel is near eight  leagues long; at its western extremity a second bifurcation appears;  and as the summit of the delta is in the northern branch of the  bifurcated river, this part of the Orinoco is highly important for the  military defence of the country. All the channels* that terminate in  the bocas chicas, rise from the same point of the trunk of the  Orinoco. (* Cano de Manamo grande, Cano de Manamo chico, Cano  Pedernales, Cano Macareo, Cano Cutupiti, Cano Macuona, Cano grande de  Mariusas, etc. The last three branches form by their union the sinuous  channel called the Vuelta del Torno.) The branch (Cano Manamo) that  separates from it near the village of San Rafael has no ramification  till after a course of three or four leagues; and by placing a small  fort above the island of Chaguanes, Angostura might be defended  against an enemy that should attempt to penetrate by one of the bocas  chicas. In my time the station of the gun-boats was east of San  Rafael, near the northern bank of the Orinoco. This is the point which  vessels must pass in sailing up toward Angostura by the northern  channel, that of San Rafael, which is the broadest but the most  shallow.    Six leagues above the point where the Orinoco sends off a branch to  the bocas chicas is placed an ancient fort (los Castillos de la Vieja  or Antigua Guayana,) the first construction of which goes back to the  sixteenth century. In this spot the bed of the river is studded with  rocky islands; and it is asserted that its breadth is nearly six  hundred and fifty toises. The town is almost destroyed, but the  fortifications subsist, and are well worthy the attention of the  government of Terra Firma. There is a magnificent view from the  battery established on a bluff north-west of the ancient town, which,  at the period of great inundations, is entirely surrounded with water.  Pools that communicate with the Orinoco form natural basins, adapted  for the reception of vessels that want repairs.    After having passed the little forts of Vieja Guayana, the bed of the  Orinoco again widens. The state of cultivation of the country on the  two banks affords a striking contrast. On the north is seen the desert  part of the province of Cumana, steppes (Llanos) destitute of  habitations, and extending beyond the sources of the Rio Mamo, toward  the tableland or mesa of Guanipa. On the south we find three populous  villages belonging to the missions of Carony, namely, San Miguel de  Uriala, San Felix and San Joaquin. The last of these villages, situate  on the banks of the Carony, immediately below the great cataract, is  considered as the embarcadero of the Catalonian missions. On  navigating more to the east, between the mouth of the Carony and  Angostura, the pilot should avoid the rocks of Guarampo, the sandbank  of Mamo, and the Piedra del Rosario. From the numerous materials which  I brought home, and from astronomical discussions, the principal  results of which I have indicated above, I have constructed a map of  the country bounded by the delta of the Orinoco, the Carony, and the  Cuyuni. This part of Guiana, from its proximity to the coast, will  some day offer the greatest attraction to European settlers.    The whole population of this vast province in its present state is,  with the exception of a few Spanish parishes, scattered on the banks  of the Lower Orinoco, and subject to two monastic governments.  Estimating the number of the inhabitants of Guiana, who do not live in  savage independence, at thirty-five thousand, we find nearly  twenty-four thousand settled in the missions, and thus withdrawn as it  were from the direct influence of the secular arm. At the period of my  voyage, the territory of the Observantin monks of St. Francis  contained seven thousand three hundred inhabitants, and that of the  Capuchinos Catalanes seventeen thousand; an astonishing disproportion,  when we reflect on the smallness of the latter territory compared to  the vast banks of the Upper Orinoco, the Atabapo, the Cassiquiare and  the Rio Negro. It results from these statements that nearly two-thirds  of the population of a province of sixteen thousand eight hundred  square leagues are found concentrated between the Rio Imataca and the  town of Santo Thome del Angostura, on a space of ground only  fifty-five leagues in length, and thirty in breadth. Both of these  monastic governments are equally inaccessible to Whites, and form  status in statu. The first, that of the Observantins, I have described  from my own observations; it remains for me to record here the notions  I could procure respecting the second of these governments, that of  the Catalonian Capuchins. Fatal civil dissensions and epidemic fevers  have of late years diminished the long-increasing prosperity of the  missions of the Carony; but, notwithstanding these losses, the region  which we are going to examine is still highly interesting with respect  to political economy.    The missions of the Catalonian Capuchins, which in 1804 contained at  least sixty thousand head of cattle grazing in the savannahs, extend  from the eastern banks of the Carony and the Paragua as far as the  banks of the Imataca, the Curumu, and the Cuyuni; at the south-east  they border on English Guiana, or the colony of Essequibo; and toward  the south, in going up the desert banks of the Paragua and the  Paraguamasi, and crossing the Cordillera of Pacaraimo, they touch the  Portuguese settlements on the Rio Branco. The whole of this country is  open, full of fine savannahs, and no way resembling that through which  we passed on the Upper Orinoco. The forests become impenetrable only  on advancing toward the south; on the north are meadows intersected  with woody hills. The most picturesque scenes lie near the falls of  the Carony, and in that chain of mountains, two hundred and fifty  toises high, which separates the tributary streams of the Orinoco from  those of the Cuyuni. There are situate the Villa de Upata,* the  capital of the missions, Santa Maria, and Cupapui. (* Founded in 1762.  Population in 1797, 657 souls; in 1803, 769 souls. The most populous  villages of these missions, Alta Gracia, Cupapui, Santa Rosa de Cura,  and Guri, had between 600 and 900 inhabitants in 1797; but in 1818  epidemic fevers diminished the population more than a third. In some  missions these diseases have swept away nearly half of the  inhabitants.) Small table-lands afford a healthy and temperate  climate. Cacao, rice, cotton, indigo, and sugar grow in abundance  wherever a virgin soil, covered with a thick coat of grasses, is  subjected to cultivation. The first Christian settlements in those  countries are not, I believe, of an earlier date than 1721. The  elements of which the present population is composed are the three  Indian races of the Guayanos, the Caribs and the Guaycas. The last are  a people of mountaineers and are far from being so diminutive in size  as the Guaycas whom we found at Esmeralda.

Up. III, 8). That passion and darkness veil the  knowledge of truth while goodness on the other hand gives rise to it,  the Divine one has declared himself, in the passage 'From goodness  springs knowledge' (Bha. Gî. XIV, 17). Hence, in order that knowledge  may arise, evil works have to be got rid of, and this is effected by the  performance of acts of religious duty not aiming at some immediate  result (such as the heavenly world and the like); according to the text  'by works of religious duty he discards all evil.' Knowledge which is  the means of reaching Brahman, thus requires the works prescribed for  the different âsramas; and hence the systematic enquiry into works (i.  e. the Pûrva Mîmâmsâ)--from which we ascertain the nature of the works  required and also the transitoriness and limitation of the fruits of  mere works--forms a necessary antecedent to the systematic enquiry into  Brahman. Moreover the discrimination of permanent and non-permanent  things, &c. (i.e. the tetrad of 'means' mentioned above, p. 11) cannot  be accomplished without the study of the Mîmâmsâ; for unless we  ascertain all the distinctions of fruits of works, means, modes of  procedure and qualification (on the part of the agent) we can hardly  understand the true nature of works, their fruits, the transitoriness or  non-transitoriness of the latter, the permanence of the Self, and  similar matters. That those conditions (viz. nityânityavastuviveka,  sama, dama, &c.) are 'means' must be determined on the basis of viniyoga  ('application' which determines the relation of principal and  subordinate matters--angin and anga); and this viniyoga which depends on  direct scriptural statement (sruti), inferential signs (linga), and so  on, is treated of in the third book of the Pûrva Mîmâmsâ-sûtras. And  further we must, in this connexion, consider also the meditations on the  Udgîtha and similar things--which, although aiming at the success of  works, are of the nature of reflections on Brahman (which is viewed in  them under various forms)--and as such have reference to knowledge of  Brahman. Those works also (with which these meditations are connected)  aim at no special results of their own, and produce and help to perfect  the knowledge of Brahman: they are therefore particularly connected with  the enquiry into Brahman. And that these meditations presuppose an  understanding of the nature of works is admitted by every one.          THE GREAT PÛRVAPAKSHA.    THE ONLY REALITY IS BRAHMAN.    Brahman, which is pure intelligence and opposed to all difference,  constitutes the only reality; and everything else, i.e. the plurality of  manifold knowing subjects, objects of knowledge, and acts of knowledge  depending on those two, is only imagined on (or 'in') that Brahman, and  is essentially false.    'In the beginning, my dear, there was that only which is, one only  without a second' (Ch. Up. VI, 2, 1); 'The higher knowledge is that by  which the Indestructible is apprehended' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 5); 'That which  cannot be seen nor seized, which has no eyes nor ears, no hands nor feet,  the permanent, the all-pervading, the most subtle, the imperishable  which the wise regard as the source of all beings' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 6);  'The True, knowledge, the Infinite is Brahman' (Taitt. Up. II, 1); 'He  who is without parts, without actions, tranquil, without fault, without  taint' (Svet. Up. VI, 19); 'By whom it is not thought, by him it is  thought; he by whom it is thought knows it not. It is not known by those  who know it, known by those who do not know it' (Ke. Up. II, 3); 'Thou  mayest not see the seer of sight; thou mayest not think the thinker of  thought' (Bri. Up. III, 4, 2); 'Bliss is Brahman' (Taitt. Up. III, 6, 1);  'All this is that Self' (Bri. Up. IV, 5, 7); 'There is here no diversity  whatever' (Bri. Up. IV, 4, 19); 'From death to death goes he who sees  any difference here' (Ka. Up. II, 4, 10); 'For where there is duality as  it were, there one sees the other'; 'but where the Self has become all  of him, by what means, and whom, should he see? by what means, and whom,  should he know?' (Bri. Up. IV, 5, 15); 'the effect is a name merely  which has its origin in speech; the truth is that (the thing made of  clay) is clay merely' (Ch. Up. VI, 1, 4); 'for if he makes but the  smallest distinction in it there is fear for him' (Taitt. Up. II, 7);--  the two following Vedânta-sûtras: III, 2, 11; III, 2, 3--the following  passages from the Vishnu-purâna: 'In which all difference vanishes,  which is pure Being, which is not the object of words, which is known by  the Self only--that knowledge is called Brahman' (VI, 7, 53); 'Him whose  essential nature is knowledge, who is stainless in reality'; 'Him who,  owing to erroneous view, abides in the form of things' (I, 2, 6); 'the  Reality thou art alone, there is no other, O Lord of the world!--  whatever matter is seen belongs to thee whose being is knowledge; but  owing to their erroneous opinion the non-devout look on it as the form  of the world. This whole world has knowledge for its essential nature,  but the Unwise viewing it as being of the nature of material things are  driven round on the ocean of delusion. Those however who possess true  knowledge and pure minds see this whole world as having knowledge for  its Self, as thy form, O highest Lord!' (Vi. Pu. I, 4, 38 ff.).--'Of  that Self, although it exists in one's own and in other bodies, the  knowledge is of one kind, and that is Reality; those who maintain  duality hold a false view' (II, 14, 31); 'If there is some other one,  different from me, then it can be said, \"I am this and that one is  another\"' (II, 13, 86); 'As owing to the difference of the holes of the  flute the air equally passing through them all is called by the names of  the different notes of the musical scale; so it is with the universal  Self' (II, 14, 32); 'He is I; he is thou; he is all: this Universe is  his form. Abandon the error of difference. The king being thus  instructed, abandoned the view of difference, having gained an intuition  of Reality' (II, 16, 24). 'When that view which gives rise to difference  is absolutely destroyed, who then will make the untrue distinction  between the individual Self and Brahman?' (VI, 7, 94).--The following  passages from the Bhagavad-Gîtâ: 'I am the Self dwelling within all  beings' (X, 20); 'Know me to be the soul within all bodies' (XIII, 2);  'Being there is none, movable or immovable, which is without me' (X, 39).--  All these and other texts, the purport of which clearly is instruction  as to the essential nature of things, declare that Brahman only, i.e.  non-differenced pure intelligence is real, while everything else is  false.    The appearance of plurality is due to avidyâ.    'Falsehood' (mithyâtva) belongs to what admits of being terminated by  the cognition of the real thing--such cognition being preceded by  conscious activity (not by mere absence of consciousness or knowledge).  The snake, e.g. which has for its substrate a rope or the like is false;  for it is due to an imperfection (dosha) that the snake is imagined in  (or 'on') the rope. In the same way this entire world, with its  distinctions of gods, men, animals, inanimate matter, and so on, is,  owing to an imperfection, wrongly imagined in the highest Brahman whose  substance is mere intelligence, and therefore is false in so far as it  may be sublated by the cognition of the nature of the real Brahman. What  constitutes that imperfection is beginningless Nescience (avidyâ), which,  hiding the truth of things, gives rise to manifold illusions, and cannot  be defined either as something that is or as something that is not.--'By  the Untrue they are hidden; of them which are true the Untrue is the  covering' (Ch, Up. VIII, 3, 1); 'Know Mâya to be Prakriti, and the great  Lord him who is associated with Mâya' (Svet. Up. IV, 10); 'Indra appears  manifold through the Mâyâs' (Bri. Up. II, 5, 19); 'My Mâya is hard to  overcome' (Bha. Gî. VII, 14); 'When the soul slumbering in beginningless  Mâyâ awakes' (Gau. Kâ. I, 16).--These and similar texts teach that it is  through beginningless Mâyâ that to Brahman which truly is pure  non-differenced intelligence its own nature hides itself, and that it  sees diversity within itself. As has been said, 'Because the Holy One is  essentially of the nature of intelligence, the form of all, but not  material; therefore know that all particular things like rocks, oceans,  hills and so on, have proceeded from intelligence [FOOTNOTE 22:1] But  when, on the cessation of all work, everything is only pure intelligence  in its own proper form, without any imperfections; then no differences--  the fruit of the tree of wishes--any longer exist between things.  Therefore nothing whatever, at any place or any time, exists apart from  intelligence: intelligence, which is one only, is viewed as manifold by  those whose minds are distracted by the effects of their own works.  Intelligence pure, free from stain, free from grief, free from all  contact with desire and other affections, everlastingly one is the  highest Lord--Vâsudeva apart from whom nothing exists. I have thus  declared to you the lasting truth of things--that intelligence only is  true and everything else untrue. And that also which is the cause of  ordinary worldly existence has been declared to you' (Vi. Pu. II, 12,  39, 40, 43-45).    Avidyâ is put an end to by true Knowledge.    Other texts declare that this Nescience comes to an end through the  cognition of the essential unity of the Self with Brahman which is  nothing but non-differenced intelligence. 'He does not again go to death;'  'He sees this as one;' 'He who sees this does not see death' (Ch. Up.  VI, 27); 'When he finds freedom from fear and rest in that which is  invisible, incorporeal, undefined, unsupported,"]]]
