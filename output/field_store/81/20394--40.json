A majority of the votes  cast on the Suffrage question were cast in its favor, but not a majority  of all the votes cast at the election. The supreme courts have generally  held that, in so important a matter, a complete majority vote was  required, but the Supreme Court of Idaho did not so hold, and woman  suffrage is now established in that State. This, also, is hardly a success  of sound democracy.    The subject of woman suffrage has lately been dealt with by two States  that represent republican progress at its best. They are New York and  Massachusetts. In the former State a Constitutional Convention in 1894  gave an impartial hearing to the subject, and decided not to submit to the  people an amendment striking the word \"male\" from the State Constitution.  Massachusetts at its State election in 1895 asked the people to vote upon  the question of extending municipal suffrage to women, and the answer was  given in a heavy adverse majority. Fewer than four in one hundred women  qualified to vote on the subject voted in its favor, and half a million  women declined to vote at all. A majority of over 100,000 votes was cast  against it by men. Utah and New York, Wyoming and Massachusetts, which  States do Americans hold up as nearest their model? In which have women  made most progress, and showed themselves most likely to understand their  rights, privileges and duties?    During the late Presidential election the issues passed the boundary that  separates party politics from patriotic faith. For months preceding that  struggle the Suffrage body had conducted the most efficient campaign in  its history. When the test came, California voted for sound money against  repudiation, for authority against anarchy, by a small majority, and threw  its ballots heavily against woman suffrage. With the enthusiastic help of  its woman voters, Colorado gave its electoral voice 16 to 1 against sound  money and sound Americanism. Which State can claim that its action rings  truest to the stroke of honest metal in finance and in defence of national  honor?    A few States have extended municipal suffrage to woman. It is generally  local and restricted Only in Kansas is there full municipal suffrage. Dr.  Jacobi, in her \"Common Sense,\" says: \"Municipal suffrage in Kansas demands  no property qualification, and its exercise therefore does not differ in  the least from that required in a Presidential election.\" This is a  mistake, for the difference is essential and illustrates the undemocratic  character of woman suffrage. Municipal suffrage in Kansas, like the  Territorial suffrage in Wyoming, was given by legislative act, and could  be done away with by another legislative act without appeal to the people,  or any change of the Constitution. It did not touch the vital question  whether women, in a democracy, could form a component part of the  government. Mrs. Stanton well understood that difference. Kansas had long  possessed local municipal suffrage when, in 1894, the question of granting  full suffrage, by constitutional amendment, was submitted to the people.  Mrs. Stanton then wrote: \"My hope now rests with Kansas. If that fails  too, we must trust no longer to the Republican and Democratic parties, but  henceforth give our money, our eloquence, our enthusiasm to a People's  party that will recognize woman as an equal factor in a new civilization.\"  There was enough leaven of republicanism working then to cause the old  fighting-ground, the free-soil State, to reject the amendment by a popular  majority of 35,000. To the \"People's Party\" in Kansas woman suffrage may  look for the most striking illustration of its results. Where municipal  suffrage could be secured only by constitutional enactment, and was so  secured, it would differ merely in degree from presidential suffrage; but  it never has been so secured in any State except those that give full  constitutional suffrage. It is on a par with school suffrage, except that  legislative enactment extends the vote to town and city matters.    The history of the school suffrage affords another proof of the  incompatibility of republicanism and constitutional suffrage for woman.  Dr. Jacobi recognizes the difference between constitutional and school  suffrage when she says: \"Women continually sign petitions for this  privilege, till startled by the discovery that it also means something  else. It means, however, in the State of New York, according to the  decision of the Supreme Court, that woman can only enjoy this privilege  thoroughly if empowered by constitutional amendment to vote for all  officers as well as for school commissioners.\" The States that have  refused to comply with the Suffragists' demand for the elective franchise,  the most progressive States, have been first to grant school suffrage,  under constitutional limits. The twenty-seven odd States that grant school  suffrage have had different methods of dealing with the question, because  their laws differ, but both the positive proof of its being granted, and  the negative proof of its being withheld, tell the same story in regard to  the fundamental principle involved. This is shown strikingly in the  situation in Kansas. Women have full municipal suffrage, and the Supreme  Court of that State decided that they could vote for school treasurer,  which was a charter office, but could not vote for County Superintendent  of Schools, because that office was provided for in the Constitution. The  school suffrage may or may not have a property qualification attached.  That makes no difference. The difference is the essential one between  delegated power and sovereign power. The States differ so widely in their  methods of dealing with municipal as well as school legislation, that only  a study of the laws of each State will reveal the situation. In Ohio, in  1895, for instance, the Legislature passed a bill enabling women to vote  on a municipal tax-levy, which the courts held was unconstitutional, while  they granted votes on license and other local questions.    In answer to the question whether, in Massachusetts, a woman could be a  member of a school committee, the Supreme Court returned the following  decision in 1874: \"The Constitution contains nothing relating to school  committees; the office is created and regulated by statute; and the  Constitution confers upon the General Court full power and authority to  name and settle annually, or provide by fixed laws for naming and  settling, all civil officers within the Commonwealth the election and  constitution of whom are not in the Constitution otherwise provided for.  The question is therefore answered in the affirmative.\" The Supreme Court  of New York, in 1892, held that \"School Commissioners are constitutional  officers within Article II. part 1 of the Constitution, and consequently  the law of 1892 giving women the right to vote for them is void.\" The case  was that of Matilda Joslyn Gage. The office of School Commissioner was  created after the adoption of the Constitution, and it was therefore urged  that the Constitution did not bear upon it; but the Supreme Court further  decided that the law gave the Legislature the right to appoint or to elect  the Commissioner; and as they had decided that the office should be  elective, the women could not vote for that office. They vote for  district-school officers under various local permissions or limitations.  In a case brought to decide the right of women to vote for County  Superintendent of Schools the Supreme Court of Illinois, in 1893, held  that, as the office was designated in the Constitution as elective, women  could not vote for it. The decision further said. \"The votes for State  Superintendent of Instruction, and County Superintendent, are provided for  by law, and the Legislature cannot change the law. It may be that it is  competent for the Legislature to provide that women who are citizens of  the United States and over twenty-one may vote at elections held for  school directors and other school officers not mentioned in the  Constitution.\" Later, the Supreme Court held that women were entitled to  vote for school trustees, as \"no officer of the school district is  mentioned in the State Constitution.\"    The Supreme Court of Ohio, in 1894, held that the provision of the act of  April 24, 1894, conferring upon women the right to vote at elections of  certain school officers, is valid, such right being within the legislative  power to provide for the establishment and maintenance of public schools,  and not within Article V. part 1, of the Constitution, which limits the  right to male citizens. Judge Shauck says: \"The whole subject of the  public schools is delegated to the Assembly. As the common-school  organization is wholly a creation of the Legislature, it is in the power  of the Legislature to determine the qualifications of an elector and  office-holder in it.\" In upholding his ruling, he cited similar decisions  from the Supreme Courts of Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, Massachusetts,  Michigan, and Iowa.    This rapid survey suggests, it seems to me, that, instead of being \"a  legitimate outgrowth of the fundamental principles of our government,\"  woman suffrage is really incompatible with true republican forms. Pre-  civilized conditions, aristocratic tendencies, the forces that would  destroy government--these appear to be its natural allies. We must study  more closely its connection with representative government the better to  comprehend this portentous truth.          CHAPTER III.      WOMAN SUFFRAGE AND THE AMERICAN REPUBLIC.      The writers of the \"History of Woman Suffrage\" give the following account  of the founding of their Association. In July, 1848, Elizabeth Cady  Stanton, Lucretia Mott, Martha O. Wright, and Ann McClintock issued an  unsigned call for a convention, which was asked to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7335"],[0,"Jack Harkaway and His Son's Escape from the Brigands of Greece (#5)"],[1,"of the man Matteo a  pair of trunks of blue cloth slashed with amber silk, and quick as an  eye could wink, he was into them.    And then he fastened on a similarly coloured mantle.    \"Tell me, Matteo, does that change me?\"    \"Yes, perfectly.\"    \"Good! take this.\"    \"What, jewels?\"    \"Hush! hear all, see all, and say nothing. Away with you, now.\"    \"Yes. Where to?\"    \"Back to the mountains, where we can always guard what we ourselves  have made.\"    \"True.\"    Just then there was a commotion in the ball-room, and a voice was heard  to cry out--    \"The contessa has lost her richest diamonds and other precious stones.  There are robbers here. No one must leave the grounds.\"    \"By Heaven!\" ejaculated Hunston; \"we are lost.\"          CHAPTER IV.    HUNSTON'S ADVENTURE--MOLE IN A MAZE--HE MEETS AN EVIL SPIRIT--GROSS  OUTRAGE ON HIS WOODEN LEGS--MATHIAS IN TROUBLE-THE ASSASSIN'S  KNIFE.      Quasimodo, who had detected one of the devils, was Magog Brand.    The audacity of the fearless Greek had carried him through so far, but  Quasimodo had spoilt him at last.    A number of gentlemen in the company began to inquire very minutely  into the affair.    Prominent amongst them was Harkaway.    He and Jefferson, prompt to act as ever, inquired into the  circumstances of this gross outrage, and then it was elicited that the  depredator was seen last in diabolical costume.    \"A devil!\" ejaculated one of the company. \"Of course, I saw the man  myself.\"    \"I too,\" said another.    \"Yes, he wore a red feather in his high-crowned hat.\"    \"No,\" said another; \"a feather, it is true, but the feather was green,  I am sure.\"    Upon this, Magog Brand came forward.    \"I saw it all done,\" he said. \"I saw the man who did it\"    \"What, rob the contessa?\"    \"Yes, and as soon as I saw what It meant, I gave the alarm; but the  devil disappeared like greased lightning.\"    \"There!\" exclaimed half a dozen at once, \"I said it was the devil.\"    \"Yes,\" added one of the guests, eagerly. \"What coloured feather had  he?\"    \"Red,\" ejaculated another, immediately.    \"Green,\" retorted the opposite faction, loudly, but Magog Brand said--    \"It was neither red nor green,\" said he, \"but a bright yellow.\"    Now, while this inquiry was being proceeded with, nobody happened to  observe one singular circumstance.    That was the presence, the whole of the time, in the motley-coloured  crowd, of one of the diabolical trio in question.    This very devil no sooner heard the question raised about the coloured  feathers in their head gear, than he doffed his hat unperceived and  pulled out the feather.    And then, as the controversy grew warmer, he sneaked off.    He made all possible haste for the garden gate.    Once here he was about to rush through, when he was accosted by two  men, whose uniform gave him an unpleasant twinge.    They were gendarmes.    \"You cannot leave the ground yet, sir,\" said one of them sharply.    \"I don't wish to,\" replied the devil, promptly. \"I come to bring you  orders.\"    \"I beg your pardon,\" said the gendarme.    \"A robbery has been committed.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"That is the reason you have had your orders to guard the gate. Oh, you  know it. Well, what you don't know is that the robbery is supposed to  have been committed by a masker dressed as I am. Take particular note  of my dress.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    The gendarme grinned as he said this.    \"Keep your eyes open. These are the contessa's particular orders.\"    \"Trust me, sir.\"    \"There is a reward if you capture the thief.\"    The gendarme laughed at this, and said, with an air of  self-confidence--\"I think I shall get him.\"    The merry devil slapped the gendarme upon the back heartily.    \"You are the sort of man for my money.\"    Saying which, he turned and left the spot.    Making his way to a place in the grounds previously agreed upon, he ran  across the brigand Matteo armed with a change of dress for him.    The spot selected was up one of the narrowest alleys in the grounds, at  the end of which was a species of Hampton Court maze in miniature.    Just as the diabolical one was about to divest himself of half of his  skin, Matteo gave the alarm.    \"The devil!\" ejaculated the masker, which was, perhaps, the most  natural exclamation he could make, all things considered. \"What can  this be? Somebody watched me here.\"    He waited a minute or so in anxiety.    An unsteady footfall was heard upon the gravel walk, and a man in a  cloak came staggering along.    \"They may call this a grand _fete_ if they like,\" he mumbled. \"I  call it a shabby affair. Why, there's not a respectable drink in the  place. The lucky thing is that I have provided my own.\"    He had a bottle with him, and he sucked at it from time to time as he  staggered on, until all of a sudden he ran on to the alarmed masker,  who was growing impatient to change his garments.    The staggering one looked up, and seeing such an alarming figure  towering over him, he gave a wild howl and fled.    \"The devil! the devil!\" he shouted wildly. \"Help! help!\"    \"Stop that fool, Matteo, or he will bring the whole house down about  our ears.\"    Matteo seized the merrymaker, and was about to make short work with  him, when his superior held his hand.    \"Put by your knife,\" he said; \"not that. Hold him tight and threaten  him; but no knife.\"    But for this timely interference, it would have gone hard with the  unfortunate new-comer, who was our old friend Mole.    Mole, it should be noted, had been compelled to change his cork legs,  on which he could scarcely stand, for his old, familiar stumps, which  Harvey had brought with him in case any accident should occur.    \"Forgive me, Mr. Devil,\" he implored, in drunken tones, \"oh, forgive  me.\"    \"Mole!\" exclaimed the devil, in a thrilling voice, \"your evil deeds are  known to me.\"    \"Oh, oh, oh!\" groaned the wretched Isaac, piteously.    \"Your time has come.\"    \"Mercy, mercy!\" gasped Mole.    \"Never.\"    \"Give me a little time, Mr. Devil.\"    \"No.\"    \"Oh, do, do, for the sake of my twins,\" said Mole, in his most  persuasive manner, \"and I'll stand any thing you like to--hic--to name.  Don't take me away, but come and liquor up with me.\"    \"Silence!\" thundered the irritable devil    \"I'm dumb.\"    \"Away with you, and repent.\"    Mole staggered off.    As soon as he was gone, Matteo assisted his master to change his  garments, and in the space of five minutes at the outside, the devil  disappeared, and was replaced by a gay cavalier, habited in a rich  costume of blue slashed with amber, and a broad-brimmed sombrero.    The excitement occasioned by the impudent robbery of the contessa  Maraviglia's jewels had not by any means subsided, so the confusion  prevailing in consequence was highly favourable to Hunston's new  villany for trapping little Emily.    Nearing the entrance to the ball-room, he came to a conservatory, into  which Mr. Mole had strolled, or let us say staggered, and then dropped  into a seat.    Hunston glided in unperceived by Mole, and concealed himself behind  some thick shrubs close to him.    Mole was bent upon making himself comfortable.    The irrepressible bottle was out again.    \"I feel,\" mumbled Mole, little thinking there was a listener near, \"I  feel that I am a devil of a fellow. All the ladies love me, and all the  men fear me. I'm too much for anyone of them, ha, ha, ha! I've taken a  rise out of the devil himself.\"    Here he had a suck at the bottle.    \"I'm getting quite familiar with evil spirits to-night,\" he said  grinning; \"I don't think he will see me again in a hurry--he, he!\" He  raised the bottle again to his lips, when a ghostly voice sounded in  his ear--    \"Beware!\"    He turned pale, and then got very red in the face.    \"Who's there?\" said Mole, looking nervously round; \"come in, don't  knock; what a fool I am.\"    \"Remember!\" said the same hollow voice as before.    \"Oh, Lor', oh, Lor'!\" cried Mole; \"I'm gone; he's there again.\"    \"Beware!\"    \"I'm gone, I'm going,\" cried Mole; \"oh, Lor', oh, Lor'!\"    And off he ran, Hunston following closely behind him.    Now Hunston got near enough to him to see that he was really trying to  get little Emily and Paquita to take care of him for a time, and walk  with him in the grounds.    \"There will be two of them to take care of,\" said Hunston, following  them up as closely as was prudent; \"that complicates matters. I hope  Matteo has taken his measures carefully.\"    Matteo had.    They drew near to the entrance of the maze, and then Hunston began to  look anxiously about him for Matteo and the rest of their accomplices.    \"I think we had better return,\" he heard little Emily say.    Suddenly a whistle was blown, and five or six men sprang out from the  maze.    In less time than it takes to record the outrage, the two girls were  seized and borne off in stout, relentless arms, their cries being  stifled by thick wraps thrown over their heads.    \"To the small gate,\" exclaimed Hunston.    Mole recognised the familiar voice of Hunston, and the whole danger  flashed into his mind at once, sobering him most effectually.    \"Hunston, you villain, I know you!\" he cried. \"And I will lose my life  rather than harm should come to these dear girls.\"    Hunston turned and faced him savagely.    \"If you know me, Mole,\" he said meaningly, \"then beware of me.\"    Mole's only reply was to grapple with him with all his strength.    But the foolish old man was hurled to the ground, and then one of the  brigands fell upon him, brandishing a huge knife.    Hunston here interfered, and gave a command which made the men laugh  very heartily.    A fresh outrage was perpetrated, and in the space of two minutes, Mr.  Mole found himself alone, and on his back.    \"Hunston, you black-hearted thief,\" he cried, \"I'll follow you if--\"    He tried to rise, but down he went again.    He was lop-sided.    And why?    The brigands had amputated one of his wooden legs.      "]]]
