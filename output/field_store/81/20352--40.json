These, with Anthony's Nose, are the  principal points of interest in the lovely and impressive panorama that  unfolds before the view as the boats fly onward.    Concerning the last-named elevation, the aquiline promontory that abuts  on the Hudson opposite Dunderberg, it takes title from no resemblance to  the human feature, but is so named because Anthony Van Corlaer, the  trumpeter, who afterwards left a reason for calling the upper boundary of  Manhattan Island Spuyten Duyvil Creek, killed the first sturgeon ever  eaten at the foot of this mountain. It happened in this wise: By  assiduous devotion to keg and flagon Anthony had begotten a nose that was  the wonder and admiration of all who knew it, for its size was  prodigious; in color it rivalled the carbuncle, and it shone like  polished copper. As Anthony was lounging over the quarter of Peter  Stuyvesant's galley one summer morning this nose caught a ray from the  sun and reflected it hissing into the water, where it killed a sturgeon  that was rising beside the vessel. The fish was pulled aboard, eaten, and  declared good, though the singed place savored of brimstone, and in  commemoration of the event Stuyvesant dubbed the mountain that rose above  his vessel Anthony's Nose.          MOODUA CREEK    Moodua is an evolution, through Murdy's and Moodna, from Murderer's  Creek, its present inexpressive name having been given to it by N. P.  Willis. One Murdock lived on its shore with his wife, two sons, and a  daughter; and often in the evening Naoman, a warrior of a neighboring  tribe, came to the cabin, caressed the children, and shared the woodman's  hospitality. One day the little girl found in the forest an arrow wrapped  in snake-skin and tipped with crow's feather; then the boy found a  hatchet hanging by a hair from a bough above the door; then a glare of  evil eyes was caught for an instant in a thicket. Naoman, when he came,  was reserved and stern, finding voice only to warn the family to fly that  night; so, when all was still, the threatened family made its way softly,  but quickly, to the Hudson shore, and embarked for Fisher's Kill, across  the river.    The wind lagged and their boat drew heavily, and when, from the shade of  Pollopel's Island, a canoe swept out, propelled by twelve men, the hearts  of the people in the boat sank in despair. The wife was about to leap  over, but Murdock drew her back; then, loading and firing as fast as  possible, he laid six of his pursuers low; but the canoe was savagely  urged forward, and in another minute every member of the family was a  helpless captive. When the skiff had been dragged back, the prisoners  were marched through the wood to an open spot where the principal members  of the tribe sat in council.    The sachem arose, twisted his hands in the woman's golden hair, bared his  knife, and cried, \"Tell us what Indian warned you and betrayed his tribe,  or you shall see husband and children bleed before your eyes.\" The woman  answered never a word, but after a little Naoman arose and said, \"'Twas  I;\" then drew his blanket about him and knelt for execution. An axe cleft  his skull. Drunk with the sight of blood, the Indians rushed upon the  captives and slew them, one by one. The prisoners neither shrank nor  cried for mercy, but met their end with hymns upon their lips, and,  seeing that they could so meet death, one member of the band let fall his  arm and straight became a Christian. The cabin was burned, the bodies  flung into the stream, and the stain of blood was seen for many a year in  Murderer's Creek.          A TRAPPER'S GHASTLY VENGEANCE    About a mile back from the Hudson, at Coxsackie, stood the cabin of Nick  Wolsey, who, in the last century, was known to the river settlements as a  hunter and trapper of correct aim, shrewdness, endurance, and taciturn  habit. For many years he lived in this cabin alone, except for the  company of his dog; but while visiting a camp of Indians in the  wilderness he was struck with the engaging manner of one of the girls of  the tribe; he repeated the visit; he found cause to go to the camp  frequently; he made presents to the father of the maid, and at length won  her consent to be his wife. The simple marriage ceremony of the tribe was  performed, and Wolsey led Minamee to his home; but the wedding was  interrupted in an almost tragic manner, for a surly fellow who had loved  the girl, yet who never had found courage to declare himself, was wrought  to such a jealous fury at the discovery of Wolsey's good fortune that he  sprang at him with a knife, and would have despatched him on the spot had  not the white man's faithful hound leaped at his throat and borne him to  the ground.    Wolsey disarmed the fellow and kicked and cuffed him to the edge of the  wood, while the whole company shouted with laughter at this ignominious  punishment, and approved it. A year or more passed. Wolsey and his Indian  wife were happy in their free and simple life; happy, too, in their  little babe. Wolsey was seldom absent from his cabin for any considerable  length of time, and usually returned to it before the night set in. One  evening he noticed that the grass and twigs were bent near his house by  some passing foot that, with the keen eye of the woodman, he saw was not  his wife's.    \"Some hunter,\" he said, \"saw the house when he passed here, and as,  belike, he never saw one before, he stopped to look in.\" For the trail  led to his window, and diverged thence to the forest again. A few days  later, as he was returning, he came on the footprints that were freshly  made, and a shadow crossed his face. On nearing the door he stumbled on  the body of his dog, lying rigid on the ground. \"How did this happen,  Minamee?\" he cried, as he flung open the door. The wife answered, in a  low voice, \"O Hush! you'll wake the child.\"    Nick Wolsey entered the cabin and stood as one turned to marble. Minamee,  his wife, sat on the gold hearth, her face and hands cut and blackened,  her dress torn, her eyes glassy, a meaningless smile on her lips. In her  arms she pressed the body of her infant, its dress soaked with blood, and  the head of the little creature lay on the floor beside her. She crooned  softly over the cold clay as if hushing it to sleep, and when Wolsey at  length found words, she only whispered, \"Hush! you will wake him.\" The  night went heavily on; day dawned, and the crooning became lower and  lower; still, through all that day the bereft woman rocked to and fro  upon the floor, and the agonized husband hung about her, trying in vain  to give comfort, to bind her wounds, to get some explanation of the  mystery that confronted him. The second night set in, and it was evident  that it would be the last for Minamee. Her strength failed until she  allowed herself to be placed on a couch of skins, while the body of her  child was gently lifted from her arms. Then, for a few brief minutes, her  reason was restored, and she found words to tell her husband how the  Indian whose murderous attack he had thwarted at the wedding had come to  the cabin, shot the dog that had rushed out to defend the place, beat the  woman back from the door, tore the baby from its bed, slashed its head  off with a knife, and, flinging the little body into her lap, departed  with the words, \"This is my revenge. I am satisfied.\" Before the sun was  in the east again Minamee was with her baby.    Wolsey sat for hours in the ruin of his happiness, his breathing alone  proving that he was alive, and when at last he arose and went out of the  house, there were neither tears nor outcry; he saddled his horse and rode  off to the westward. At nightfall he came to the Indian village where he  had won his wife, and relating to the assembled tribe what had happened,  he demanded that the murderer be given up to him. His demand was readily  granted, whereupon the white man advanced on the cowering wretch, who had  confidently expected the protection of his people, and with the quick  fling and jerk of a raw-hide rope bound his arms to his side. Then  casting a noose about his neck and tying the end of it to his saddle-bow,  he set off for the Hudson. All that night he rode, the Indian walking and  running at the horse's heels, and next day he reached his cabin. Tying  his prisoner to a tree, the trapper cut a quantity of young willows, from  which he fashioned a large cradle-like receptacle; in this he placed the  culprit, face upward, and tied so stoutly that he could not move a  finger; then going into his house, he emerged with the body of Minamee,  and laid it, face downward, on the wretch, who could not repress a groan  of horror as the awful burden sank on his breast. Wolsey bound together  the living and the dead, and with a swing of his powerful arms he flung  them on his horse's back, securing them there with so many turns of rope  that nothing could displace them. Now he began to lash his horse until  the poor beast trembled with anger and pain, when, flinging off the  halter, he gave it a final lash, and the animal plunged, foaming and  snorting, into the wilderness. When it had vanished and the hoof-beats  were no longer heard, Nick Wolsey took his rifle on his arm and left his  home forever. And tradition says that the horse never stopped in its mad  career, but that on still nights it can be heard sweeping through the  woods along the Hudson and along the Mohawk like a whirlwind, and that as  the sound goes "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6622"],[0,"Legends That Every Child Should Know; a Selection of the Great Legends of All (#5)"],[1,"boy; his skin was like roses and lilies, and as clear as glass;  and he was as brave as he was handsome. At fifteen years old his like  was not to be seen in all the kingdoms around. He had a band of  play-fellows, twelve boys of noble birth, but not one of them could  throw the ball so high as Horn. Out of the twelve, two were his special  companions, and one of them, Athulf, was the best of the company, while  the other, Figold, was altogether the worst.    It came to pass one summer morning that good King Altof was riding on  the sea-shore with only two attendants, and he looked out to sea and saw  fifteen ships lying in the offing. It was the heathen Vikings who had  come from Northland, bent on plundering Christian lands. When these saw  the three Norsemen, they swarmed on to shore like a pack of wolves, all  armed and full of battle fury. They slew the King and his knights, and  made themselves masters of the whole land.    Queen Gotthild wept much for her lord, and more for her son, Childe  Horn, who could not now ascend his father's throne. She clad herself in  mourning garments, the meanest she could find, and went to dwell in a  cave, where she prayed night and day for her son, that he might be  preserved from the malice of his enemies, at whose mercy he and his  comrades lay. At first they thought to have slain him, but one of their  leaders was touched by his glorious beauty, and so he said to the boy,  \"Horn, you are a fair stripling and a bold, and when you come to years,  you and your band here, you are like to prove too many for us, so I am  going to put you all in a boat and let it drift out to sea--where may  the gods preserve you, or else send you to the bottom; but, for all our  sakes, you cannot remain here.\"    Then they led the boys down to the shore, placed them in a little skiff,  and pushed it off from the land. All but Horn wrung their hands in fear.  The waves rose high, and, as the boat was tossed up and down, the lads  gave themselves up for lost, not knowing whither they were driven; but  when the morning of the second day broke, Horn sprang up from where he  sat in the forepart of the skiff, crying, \"I hear the birds sing, and I  see the grass growing green--we are at the land!\" Then they sprang right  gladly on shore, and Horn called after the boat as it floated away, \"A  good voyage to thee, little boat! May wind and wave speed thee back to  Southland. Greet all who knew me, and chiefly the good Queen Gotthild,  my mother. And tell the heathen King that some day he shall meet his  death at my hand.\"    Then the boys went on till they came to a city, where reigned King  Aylmer of Westland--whom God reward for his kindness to them. He asked  them in mild words whence they came, \"for in good sooth,\" said he,  \"never have I seen so well-favoured a company\"; and Horn answered  proudly, \"We are of good Christian blood, and we come from Southland,  which has just been raided by pagans, who slew many of our people, and  sent us adrift in a boat, to be the sport of the winds and waves. For a  day and a night we have been at sea without a rudder; and now we have  been cast upon your coast, you may enslave or slay us, if but, it please  thee, show us mercy.\"    Then the good King asked, \"What is your name, my child?\" and the boy  answered. \"Horn, at your pleasure, my Lord King; and if you need a  servant, I will serve you well and truly.\"    \"Childe Horn,\" said the King, \"you bear a mighty name for one so young  and tender.      \"Over hills and valleys oft the horn has rung,    In the royal palace long the horn has hung.    So shall thy name, O Hornchild, through every land resound,    And the fame of thy wondrous beauty in all the West be found.\"    So Horn found great favour with the King, and he put him in charge of  Athelbrus, the house-steward, that he might teach him all knightly  duties, and he spared no pains with him, nor yet with his companions;  but well trained as they all were, Horn was far ahead of them both in  stature and noble bearing. Even a stranger looking at him could guess  his lofty birth, and the splendour of his marvellous beauty lit up all  the palace; while he won all hearts, from the meanest grooms to the  greatest of the court ladies.    Now the fairest thing in that lordly court was the King's only daughter,  Riminild. Her mother was dead, and she was well-beloved of her father,  as only children are. Not a word had she ever ventured to speak to Horn  when she saw him among the other knights at the great feasts, but day  and night she bore his image in her heart. One night she dreamed that he  entered her apartments (and she wondered much at his boldness), and in  the morning she sent for Athelbrus, the house-steward, and bade him  conduct Horn into her presence. But he went to Athulf, who was the pure  minded and true one of Horn's two chosen companions, while Figold, the  other, was a wolf in sheep's clothing, and said to him, \"You shall go  with me in Horn's stead to the Princess.\"    So he went, and she, not recognising him in the ill-lighted room,  stretched out her hand to him, crying, \"Oh, Horn, I have loved you long.  Now plight me your troth.\"    But Athulf whispered to her, \"Hold! I am not Horn. I am but his friend,  Athulf, as unlike him as may well be. Horn's little finger is fairer  than my whole body; and were he dead, or a thousand miles off, I would  not play him false.\"    Then Riminild rose up in anger and glared upon the old steward, crying,  \"Athelbrus, you wicked man, out of my sight, or I shall hate you for  evermore! All shame and ill befall you if you bring me not Childe Horn  himself!\"    \"Lady and Princess,\" answered Athelbrus warily, \"listen, and I will tell  you why I brought Athulf. The King entrusted Horn to my care, and I  dread his anger. Now be not angry with me, and I will fetch him  forthwith.\"    Then he went away, but, instead of Horn, this time he called Figold, the  deceiver, and said to him, \"Come with me, instead of Horn, to the royal  Princess. Do not betray yourself, lest we both suffer for it.\"    Willingly went the faithless one with him, but to Figold the maid held  not out her hand--well she knew that he was false, and she drove him  from her presence in rage and fury. Athelbrus feared her anger, and said  to himself, \"To make my peace with her I must now send her the true  Horn.\" He found him in the hall presenting the wine cup to the King, and  whispered to him, \"Horn, you are wanted in the Princess's apartments\";  and when Horn heard this his hand holding the full goblet so trembled  that the wine ran over the edge. He went straight into the presence of  the royal maiden, and as he knelt before her his beauty seemed to light  up the room.    \"Fair befall thee and thy maidens, O Lady!\" said he. \"The house-steward  has sent me hither to ask thy will.\"    Then Riminild stood up, her cheeks red as the dawn, and told him of her  love; and Horn took counsel with himself how he should answer her.    \"May God in heaven bless him whom thou weddest, whoever he may be,\" he  said. \"I am but a foundling, and the King's servant to boot--it would be  against all rule and custom were he to wed me with thee.\"    When Riminild heard this her heart died within her, and she fell  fainting on the floor; but Horn lifted her up, and advised her to  request her father that he might now receive knighthood. \"An then,\" said  he, \"I will win you by my brave deeds.\"    When she heard that, she recovered herself and said, \"Take my ring here  to Master Athelbrus, and bid him from me ask the King to make you a  knight.\"    So Horn went and told all to Athelbrus, who sought the King forthwith,  and said, \"To-morrow is a festival; I counsel thee to admit Horn to  knighthood.\" And the King was pleased, and said, \"Good! Horn is well  worthy of it. I will create him a knight to-morrow, and he himself shall  confer it on his twelve companions.\"    The next day the newly knighted one went to Riminild's bower, and told  her that now he was her own true knight, and must go forth to do brave  deeds in her name, and she said she would trust him evermore, and she  gave him a gold ring with her name graven on it, which would preserve  him from all evil. \"Let this remind thee of me early and late,\" she  said, \"and thou canst never fall by treachery.\" And then they kissed  each other, and she closed the door behind him, with tears.    The other knights were feasting and shouting in the King's hall, but  Horn went to the stable, armed from head to foot. He stroked his  coal-black steed, then sprang upon his back and rode off, his armour  ringing as he went. Down to the seashore he galloped, singing joyously  and praying God soon to send him the chance to do some deed of knightly  daring, and there he met a band of pagen marauders, who had just landed  from their pirate-ship. Horn asked them civilly what they wanted there,  and one of the pagans answered insolently, \"To conquer the land and slay  all that dwell in it, as we did to King Altof, whose son now serves a  foreign lord.\"    Horn, on hearing this, drew his sword and struck off the fellow's head;  then he thought of his dead father and of his mother in her lonely cave;  he looked on his ring and thought of Riminild, and dashed among the  pirates, laying about him right and left, till, I warrant you, there  were few of them left to tell the tale. \"This,\" he cried, \"is but the  foretaste of what will be when I return to my own land and avenge my  father's death!\"    Then he rode back to the palace and told the King how he had slain the  invaders, and \"Here,\" he said, \"is the head of the leader, to requite  thee, O King, for granting me knighthood.\"    The next day the King went a-hunting in the forest, and the false Figold  rode at his side, but Horn stayed at home. And Figold spoke to the King  out of his wicked heart and said, \"I warn thee, King Aylmer, Horn is  plotting to dishonour thee--to"]]]
