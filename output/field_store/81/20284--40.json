She talks of dreams, too.  Methought as she spoke there was trouble in her face, as if a dream had  warned her what work is to be done tonight. But no, no; 't would kill  her to think it. Well, she's a blessed angel on earth; and after this  one night I'll cling to her skirts and follow her to heaven.\"    With this excellent resolve for the future, Goodman Brown felt himself  justified in making more haste on his present evil purpose. He had  taken a dreary road, darkened by all the gloomiest trees of the forest,  which barely stood aside to let the narrow path creep through, and  closed immediately behind. It was all as lonely as could be; and there  is this peculiarity in such a solitude, that the traveller knows not  who may be concealed by the innumerable trunks and the thick boughs  overhead; so that with lonely footsteps he may yet be passing through  an unseen multitude.    \"There may be a devilish Indian behind every tree,\" said Goodman Brown  to himself; and he glanced fearfully behind him as he added, \"What if  the devil himself should be at my very elbow!\"    His head being turned back, he passed a crook of the road, and, looking  forward again, beheld the figure of a man, in grave and decent attire,  seated at the foot of an old tree. He arose at Goodman Brown's approach  and walked onward side by side with him.    \"You are late, Goodman Brown,\" said he. \"The clock of the Old South was  striking as I came through Boston, and that is full fifteen minutes  agone.\"    \"Faith kept me back a while,\" replied the young man, with a tremor in  his voice, caused by the sudden appearance of his companion, though not  wholly unexpected.    It was now deep dusk in the forest, and deepest in that part of it  where these two were journeying. As nearly as could be discerned, the  second traveller was about fifty years old, apparently in the same rank  of life as Goodman Brown, and bearing a considerable resemblance to  him, though perhaps more in expression than features. Still they might  have been taken for father and son. And yet, though the elder person  was as simply clad as the younger, and as simple in manner too, he had  an indescribable air of one who knew the world, and who would not have  felt abashed at the governor's dinner table or in King William's court,  were it possible that his affairs should call him thither. But the only  thing about him that could be fixed upon as remarkable was his staff,  which bore the likeness of a great black snake, so curiously wrought  that it might almost be seen to twist and wriggle itself like a living  serpent. This, of course, must have been an ocular deception, assisted  by the uncertain light.    \"Come, Goodman Brown,\" cried his fellow-traveller, \"this is a dull pace  for the beginning of a journey. Take my staff, if you are so soon  weary.\"    \"Friend,\" said the other, exchanging his slow pace for a full stop,  \"having kept covenant by meeting thee here, it is my purpose now to  return whence I came. I have scruples touching the matter thou wot'st  of.\"    \"Sayest thou so?\" replied he of the serpent, smiling apart. \"Let us  walk on, nevertheless, reasoning as we go; and if I convince thee not  thou shalt turn back. We are but a little way in the forest yet.\"    \"Too far! too far!\" exclaimed the goodman, unconsciously resuming his  walk. \"My father never went into the woods on such an errand, nor his  father before him. We have been a race of honest men and good  Christians since the days of the martyrs; and shall I be the first of  the name of Brown that ever took this path and kept--\"    \"Such company, thou wouldst say,\" observed the elder person,  interpreting his pause. \"Well said, Goodman Brown! I have been as well  acquainted with your family as with ever a one among the Puritans; and  that's no trifle to say. I helped your grandfather, the constable, when  he lashed the Quaker woman so smartly through the streets of Salem; and  it was I that brought your father a pitch-pine knot, kindled at my own  hearth, to set fire to an Indian village, in King Philip's war. They  were my good friends, both; and many a pleasant walk have we had along  this path, and returned merrily after midnight. I would fain be friends  with you for their sake.\"    \"If it be as thou sayest,\" replied Goodman Brown, \"I marvel they never  spoke of these matters; or, verily, I marvel not, seeing that the least  rumor of the sort would have driven them from New England. We are a  people of prayer, and good works to boot, and abide no such wickedness.\"    \"Wickedness or not,\" said the traveller with the twisted staff, \"I have  a very general acquaintance here in New England. The deacons of many a  church have drunk the communion wine with me; the selectmen of divers  towns make me their chairman; and a majority of the Great and General  Court are firm supporters of my interest. The governor and I, too--But  these are state secrets.\"    \"Can this be so?\" cried Goodman Brown, with a stare of amazement at his  undisturbed companion. \"Howbeit, I have nothing to do with the governor  and council; they have their own ways, and are no rule for a simple  husbandman like me. But, were I to go on with thee, how should I meet  the eye of that good old man, our minister, at Salem village? Oh, his  voice would make me tremble both Sabbath day and lecture day.\"    Thus far the elder traveller had listened with due gravity; but now  burst into a fit of irrepressible mirth, shaking himself so violently  that his snake-like staff actually seemed to wriggle in sympathy.    \"Ha! ha! ha!\" shouted he again and again; then composing himself,  \"Well, go on, Goodman Brown, go on; but, prithee, don't kill me with  laughing.\"    \"Well, then, to end the matter at once,\" said Goodman Brown,  considerably nettled, \"there is my wife, Faith. It would break her dear  little heart; and I'd rather break my own.\"    \"Nay, if that be the case,\" answered the other, \"e'en go thy ways,  Goodman Brown. I would not for twenty old women like the one hobbling  before us that Faith should come to any harm.\"    As he spoke he pointed his staff at a female figure on the path, in  whom Goodman Brown recognized a very pious and exemplary dame, who had  taught him his catechism in youth, and was still his moral and  spiritual adviser, jointly with the minister and Deacon Gookin.    \"A marvel, truly, that Goody Cloyse should be so far in the wilderness  at nightfall,\" said he. \"But with your leave, friend, I shall take a  cut through the woods until we have left this Christian woman behind.  Being a stranger to you, she might ask whom I was consorting with and  whither I was going.\"    \"Be it so,\" said his fellow-traveller. \"Betake you to the woods, and  let me keep the path.\"    Accordingly the young man turned aside, but took care to watch his  companion, who advanced softly along the road until he had come within  a staff's length of the old dame. She, meanwhile, was making the best  of her way, with singular speed for so aged a woman, and mumbling some  indistinct words--a prayer, doubtless--as she went. The traveller put  forth his staff and touched her withered neck with what seemed the  serpent's tail.    \"The devil!\" screamed the pious old lady.    \"Then Goody Cloyse knows her old friend?\" observed the traveller,  confronting her and leaning on his writhing stick.    \"Ah, forsooth, and is it your worship indeed?\" cried the good dame.  \"Yea, truly is it, and in the very image of my old gossip, Goodman  Brown, the grandfather of the silly fellow that now is. But--would your  worship believe it?--my broomstick hath strangely disappeared, stolen,  as I suspect, by that unhanged witch, Goody Cory, and that, too, when I  was all anointed with the juice of smallage, and cinquefoil, and wolf's  bane.\"    \"Mingled with fine wheat and the fat of a new-born babe,\" said the  shape of old Goodman Brown.    \"Ah, your worship knows the recipe,\" cried the old lady, cackling  aloud. \"So, as I was saying, being all ready for the meeting, and no  horse to ride on, I made up my mind to foot it; for they tell me there  is a nice young man to be taken into communion to-night. But now your  good worship will lend me your arm, and we shall be there in a  twinkling.\"    \"That can hardly be,\" answered her friend. \"I may not spare you my arm,  Goody Cloyse; but here is my staff, if you will.\"    So saying, he threw it down at her feet, where, perhaps, it assumed  life, being one of the rods which its owner had formerly lent to the  Egyptian magi. Of this fact, however, Goodman Brown could not take  cognizance. He had cast up his eyes in astonishment, and, looking down  again, beheld neither Goody Cloyse nor the serpentine staff, but his  fellow-traveller alone, who waited for him as calmly as if nothing had  happened.    \"That old woman taught me my catechism,\" said the young man; and there  was a world of meaning in this simple comment.    They continued to walk onward, while the elder traveller exhorted his  companion to make good speed and persevere in the path, discoursing so  aptly that his arguments seemed rather to spring up in the bosom of his  auditor than to be suggested by himself. As they went, he plucked a  branch of maple to serve for a walking stick, and began to strip it of  the twigs and little boughs, which were wet with evening dew. The  moment his fingers touched them they became strangely withered and  dried up as with a week's sunshine.

Because  they breed continuously, the job would never be done.\"    \"I see. Like the marching Chinese!\"    \"Who the devil are they?\"    \"It was a--uh--paradox of my time. Somebody figured out that if all  the Chinese in the world were to line up four abreast, I think it was,  and start marching past a given point, they'd never stop because of the  babies that would be born and grow up before they passed the point.\"    \"That's right. Only instead of 'a given point,' make it 'the largest  conceivable number of operating rooms that we could build and staff.'  There could never be enough.\"    \"Say!\" said Barlow. \"Those movies about babies--was that your  propaganda?\"    \"It was. It doesn't seem to mean a thing to them. We have abandoned the  idea of attempting propaganda contrary to a biological drive.\"    \"So if you work _with_ a biological drive--?\"    \"I know of none which is consistent with inhibition of fertility.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Barlow's face went poker-blank, the result of years of careful  discipline. \"You don't, huh? You're the great brains and you can't  think of any?\"    \"Why, no,\" said the psychist innocently. \"Can you?\"    \"That depends. I sold ten thousand acres of Siberian tundra--through  a dummy firm, of course--after the partition of Russia. The buyers  thought they were getting improved building lots on the outskirts of  Kiev. I'd say that was a lot tougher than this job.\"    \"How so?\" asked the hawk-faced man.    \"Those were normal, suspicious customers and these are morons, born  suckers. You just figure out a con they'll fall for; they won't know  enough to do any smart checking.\"    The psychist and the hawk-faced man had also had training; they kept  themselves from looking with sudden hope at each other.    \"You seem to have something in mind,\" said the psychist.    Barlow's poker face went blanker still. \"Maybe I have. I haven't heard  any offer yet.\"    \"There's the satisfaction of knowing that you've prevented Earth's  resources from being so plundered,\" the hawk-faced man pointed out,  \"that the race will soon become extinct.\"    \"I don't know that,\" Barlow said bluntly. \"All I have is your word.\"    \"If you really have a method, I don't think any price would be too  great,\" the psychist offered.    \"Money,\" said Barlow.    \"All you want.\"    \"More than you want,\" the hawk-faced man corrected.    \"Prestige,\" added Barlow. \"Plenty of publicity. My picture and my name  in the papers and over TV every day, statues to me, parks and cities  and streets and other things named after me. A whole chapter in the  history books.\"    The psychist made a facial sign to the hawk-faced man that meant, \"Oh,  brother!\"    The hawk-faced man signaled back, \"Steady, boy!\"    \"It's not too much to ask,\" the psychist agreed.    Barlow, sensing a seller's market, said, \"Power!\"    \"Power?\" the hawk-faced man repeated puzzledly. \"Your own hydro station  or nuclear pile?\"    \"I mean a world dictatorship with me as dictator!\"    \"Well, now--\" said the psychist, but the hawk-faced man interrupted,  \"It would take a special emergency act of Congress but the situation  warrants it. I think that can be guaranteed.\"    \"Could you give us some indication of your plan?\" the psychist asked.    \"Ever hear of lemmings?\"    \"No.\"    \"They are--were, I guess, since you haven't heard of them--little  animals in Norway, and every few years they'd swarm to the coast and  swim out to sea until they drowned. I figure on putting some lemming  urge into the population.\"    \"How?\"    \"I'll save that till I get the right signatures on the deal.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The hawk-faced man said, \"I'd like to work with you on it, Barlow. My  name's Ryan-Ngana.\" He put out his hand.    Barlow looked closely at the hand, then at the man's face. \"Ryan what?\"    \"Ngana.\"    \"That sounds like an African name.\"    \"It is. My mother's father was a Watusi.\"    Barlow didn't take the hand. \"I thought you looked pretty dark. I don't  want to hurt your feelings, but I don't think I'd be at my best working  with you. There must be somebody else just as well qualified, I'm sure.\"    The psychist made a facial sign to Ryan-Ngana that meant, \"Steady  _yourself_, boy!\"    \"Very well,\" Ryan-Ngana told Barlow. \"We'll see what arrangement can be  made.\"    \"It's not that I'm prejudiced, you understand. Some of my best  friends--\"    \"Mr. Barlow, don't give it another thought. Anybody who could pick on  the lemming analogy is going to be useful to us.\"    And so he would, thought Ryan-Ngana, alone in the office after  Tinny-Peete had taken Barlow up to the helicopter stage. So he  would. Poprob had exhausted every rational attempt and the new  Poprobattacklines would have to be irrational or sub-rational. This  creature from the past with his lemming legends and his improved  building lots would be a fountain of precious vicious self-interest.    Ryan-Ngana sighed and stretched. He had to go and run the San  Francisco subway. Summoned early from the Pole to study Barlow, he'd  left unfinished a nice little theorem. Between interruptions, he was  slowly constructing an n-dimensional geometry whose foundations and  superstructure owed no debt whatsoever to intuition.           *       *       *       *       *    Upstairs, waiting for a helicopter, Barlow was explaining to  Tinny-Peete that he had nothing against Negroes, and Tinny-Peete wished  he had some of Ryan-Ngana's imperturbability and humor for the ordeal.    The helicopter took them to International Airport where, Tinny-Peete  explained, Barlow would leave for the Pole.    The man from the past wasn't sure he'd like a dreary waste of ice and  cold.    \"It's all right,\" said the psychist. \"A civilized layout. Warm,  pleasant. You'll be able to work more efficiently there. All the facts  at your fingertips, a good secretary--\"    \"I'll need a pretty big staff,\" said Barlow, who had learned from  thousands of deals never to take the first offer.    \"I meant a private, confidential one,\" said Tinny-Peete readily, \"but  you can have as many as you want. You'll naturally have top-primary-top  priority if you really have a workable plan.\"    \"Let's not forget this dictatorship angle,\" said Barlow.    He didn't know that the psychist would just as readily have promised  him deification to get him happily on the \"rocket\" for the Pole.  Tinny-Peete had no wish to be torn limb from limb; he knew very  well that it would end that way if the population learned from this  anachronism that there was a small elite which considered itself  head, shoulders, trunk and groin above the rest. The fact that this  assumption was perfectly true and the fact that the elite was condemned  by its superiority to a life of the most grinding toil would not be  considered; the difference would.    The psychist finally put Barlow aboard the \"rocket\" with some thirty  people--real people--headed for the Pole.           *       *       *       *       *    Barlow was airsick all the way because of a post-hypnotic suggestion  Tinny-Peete had planted in him. One idea was to make him as averse as  possible to a return trip, and another idea was to spare the other  passengers from his aggressive, talkative company.    Barlow during the first day at the pole was reminded  of his first day in the Army. It was the same  now-where-the-hell-are-we-going-to-put-_you_? business until he took a  firm line with them. Then instead of acting like supply sergeants they  acted like hotel clerks.    It was a wonderful, wonderfully calculated buildup, and one that he  failed to suspect. After all, in his time a visitor from the past would  have been lionized.    At day's end he reclined in a snug underground billet with the 60-mile  gales roaring yards overhead, and tried to put two and two together.    It was like old times, he thought--like a coup in real estate where  you had the competition by the throat, like a 50-per cent rent boost  when you knew damned well there was no place for the tenants to move,  like smiling when you read over the breakfast orange juice that the  city council had decided to build a school on the ground you had  acquired by a deal with the city council. And it was simple. He would  just sell tundra building lots to eagerly suicidal lemmings, and that  was absolutely all there was to solving the Problem that had these  double-domes spinning.    They'd have to work out most of the details, naturally, but what the  hell, that was what subordinates were for. He'd need specialists in  advertising, engineering, communications--did they know anything about  hypnotism? That might be helpful. If not, there'd have to be a lot of  bribery done, but he'd make sure--damned sure--there were unlimited  funds.    Just selling building lots to lemmings....    He wished, as he fell asleep, that poor Verna could have been in on  this. It was his biggest, most stupendous deal. Verna--that sharp  shyster Sam Immerman must have swindled her....           *       *       *       *       *    It began the next day with people coming to visit him. He knew the  approach. They merely wanted to be helpful to their illustrious visitor  from the past and would he help fill them in about his era, which  unfortunately was somewhat obscure historically, and what did he think  could be done about the Problem? He told them he was too old to be  roped any more, and they wouldn't get any information out of him until  he got a letter of intent from at least the Polar President, and a  session of the Polar Congress empowered to make him dictator.    He got the letter and the session. He presented his program, was asked  whether his conscience didn't revolt at its callousness, explained  succinctly that a deal was a deal and anybody who wasn't smart enough  to protect himself didn't deserve protection--\"Caveat emptor,\" he threw  in for scholarship, and"]]]
