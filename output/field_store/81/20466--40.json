[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9457"],[0,"Travels in Arabia; comprehending an account of those territories in Hedjaz which (#5)"],[1,"fifteenth century,  although it had been known in the most ancient times of Arabian history  as the harbour of Mekka.] Besides many small mosques, there are two of  considerable size: one of these was built by Sherif Serour, predecessor  of the last reigning Sherif Ghaleb. The Governors habitation, in which  the Sherif himself frequently resided, is a paltry building; such,  likewise, is that in which dwells the collector of the customs. There  are some well-built public khans in the town, with good accommodation,  where the foreign merchants reside during their short stay here. In  these khans are large open squares with arched passages, which afford a  cool shade to the merchants for the greater part of the day. Except  during the monsoon, when Djidda is extremely crowded with people,  private lodgings may easily be procured in the most distant quarters of  the town. The best private dwellings of Djidda belong to the great  mercantile establishment of Djeylani, who, with his family, occupies a  small square behind the principal street. This square is composed of  three large buildings, the most commodious and costly private houses in  all the Hedjaz. Every house of moderate size has its cistern; but as the  rains are not sufficiently regular or abundant to fill the cisterns from  the tops of the houses, (as    [p.12] throughout Syria,) they are often supplied with water from pools  formed outside of the town in rainy seasons.    Of these cisterns, the water is very inadequate to the consumption of  Djidda, and is reckoned a delicacy. Much of the drinking water is drawn  from some wells a mile and a half distant on the southern side; water,  indeed, may be found every where at a depth of fifteen feet, but it is  generally of a bad taste, and in some places scarcely drinkable. Two  only of the wells afford water that can be called sweet; but even this  is considered heavy, [Heavy and light, applied to water, are expressions  common in most languages of the East, where both natives and foreigners,  from the vast quantity which they consume, become more refined in their  taste regarding it than the people of our northern climates.] and, if  suffered to stand twenty-four hours in a vessel, it becomes full of  insects. The good water of these two wells being scarce and dear, cannot  always be procured without the assistance of powerful friends; in fact,  not more than from two to three hundred persons are ever able to obtain  it, while the rest of the inhabitants must content themselves with the  water supplied by other wells; and to this the constant ill-health of  the people may chiefly be ascribed. As Djidda has the name of a Turkish  fortress, we might suppose that the wells would have been protected by a  fort; but the Turks have neglected this precaution, and when, in  December, 1814, the people apprehended that the Wahabis were advancing  on the side of Gonfady, the Governor of Djidda, in great haste, filled  the few cisterns belonging to the government houses with water from the  wells, and for several days withheld that necessary of life from all the  inhabitants, as every water-camel was employed by him. Several of the  wells are private property, and yield to their owners a considerable  income.    The town of Djidda is without gardens, or vegetation of any kind except  a few date-trees adjoining one of the mosques; even outside the town the  whole country is a barren desert, covered    [p.13] on the sea-shore with a saline earth, and higher up with sand:  here are found some shrubs and a few low acacia trees. The number of  wells around the town might be considerably augmented, and water  obtained for the purposes of irrigation; but the inhabitants of Djidda  consider their residence as merely temporary, and, like all the other  people of the Hedjaz, devote their whole attention to commerce and the  acquisition of riches: on this account they are much less inclined to  rural enjoyments or occupations than any other race of Moslems that I  ever saw.    Beyond the Báb Mekka, and close to the town, are several huts, through  the midst of which lies the road to Mekka. These huts are inhabited by  the camel-drivers who traffic between that city and Djidda; by poor  Bedouins, who earn a livelihood by cutting wood at a considerable  distance in the mountains; and by Negro Hadjis, who adopt the same means  of supporting themselves during their stay at Djidda. Here is held the  market for live cattle, wood and charcoal, fruits and vegetables in  wholesale. Coffee also is sold in many booths in this place, frequented  for a short time, at an early hour, by the inferior class of merchants,  who resort hither to learn the news from Mekka, whence the post arrives  every morning soon after sunrise. About a mile beyond these huts,  eastward of the town, is the principal burial-ground, containing the  tombs of several sheikhs; but there are smaller cemeteries within the  walls. About two miles northward of the town, is shown the tomb of Howa  (Eve), the mother of mankind; it is, as I was informed, a rude structure  of stone, about four feet in length, two or three feet in height, and as  many in breadth; thus resembling the tomb of Noah, seen in the valley of  Bekaa, in Syria.    During the predominance of the Wahabis, Djidda had been in a declining  state; many of its buildings had gone to ruin; no one constructed a new  house; trade was much depressed, in consequence of the pilgrimage from  Turkey having been discontinued, and the unwillingness of the merchants  to bring their goods hither    [p.14] for sale. Since the recovery of the holy cities, however, and the  re-establishment of the pilgrimage, together with the daily arrival of  soldiers, and a number of merchants and followers of the army, the town  has quickly recovered its former condition, and is now as flourishing as  at any former period. The number of its inhabitants may be estimated,  generally, at from twelve to fifteen thousand; but in the months  preceding the pilgrimage, and again during the summer months  corresponding with the monsoon winds, there is a great influx of  strangers, which increases the above number perhaps one-half.    The inhabitants of Djidda, like those of Mekka and Medina, are almost  exclusively foreigners. The descendants of the ancient Arabs who once  peopled the town, have perished by the hands of the governors, or have  retired to other countries. Those who can be truly called natives are  only a few families of sherifs, who are all learned men, and attached to  the mosques or the courts of justice; all the other Djiddawys (people of  Ddjidda) are foreigners or their descendants. Of the latter, those from  Hadramaut and Yemen are the most numerous: colonies from every town and  province of those countries are settled in Djidda, and keep up an active  commerce with their native places. Upwards of a hundred Indian families  (chiefly from Surat, and a few from Bombay,) have also established  themselves here; and to these may be added some Malays and people of  Maskat. The settlers from Egypt, Syria, Barbary, European Turkey, and  Anatolia, may be still recognised in the features of their descendants,  who are all mixed in one general mass, and live and dress in the same  Arab manner. The Indians alone remain a distinct race in manners, dress,  and employment. There are no Christians settled in Djidda; but a few  Greeks from the islands of the Archipelago occasionally bring  merchandize to this market from Egypt. In the time of the sherifs they  were much molested, compelled to wear a particular dress, and prohibited  from approaching the Mekka gate; but the Turks having become    [p.15] masters of the Hedjaz, abolished these restrictions, and a  Christian now enjoys complete liberty here: if he dies, he is not buried  on shore, (this being sanctified ground, belonging to the holy city,)  but upon some one of the small islands in the bay of Djidda. Jews were  formerly the brokers of this town; but they were driven out, about  thirty or forty years since, by Serour, the predecessor of Ghaleb, some  of them having offended by their misconduct. They all retired to Yemen  or to Sanaa. During the monsoons some Banians visit Djidda in the Indian  ships; but they always return with them, and none are settled here.    The mixture of races in Djidda is an effect of the pilgrimage, during  which rich merchants visit the Hedjaz with large adventures of goods:  some of these not being able immediately to settle their accounts, wait  till another year; during this period, they cohabit, according to the  custom of the country, with some Abyssinian slaves, whom they soon  marry; finding themselves at last with a family, they are induced to  settle in the country. Thus every pilgrimage adds fresh numbers to the  population not only of Djidda, but of Mekka also, which is indeed very  necessary, as in both towns the number of deaths is far greater than  that of births.    The people of Djidda are almost entirely engaged in commerce, and pursue  no manufactures or trades but those of immediate necessity. They are all  either sea-faring people, traders by sea, or engaged in the traffic with  Arabia. Djidda derives its opulence not only from being the port of  Mekka, but it may be considered as that of Egypt, of India, and of  Arabia; all the exports of those countries destined for Egypt first  passing through the hands of the Djidda merchants. Hence, it is probably  richer than any town of the same size in the Turkish dominions. Its  Arabian name, which means rich, is therefore perfectly well bestowed.  The two greatest merchants in the place, Djeylany and Sakkat, both of  Maggrebin [Maggrebin, inhabitants of the West, is the name given by all  the Eastern Arabs to the natives of the Barbary States.]    [p.16] origin, and whose grandfathers first settled here, are known to  possess from one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9479"],[0,"The Boy Life of Napoleon, Afterwards Emperor of the French (#5)"],[1,"and undutiful boy. I forbid you to speak to him.\"    Then turning to his son, he said, \"Napoleon, we have given you more than  the time offered you for reflection. Now, sir, come and ask pardon for  your misdeed, and all will be over.\"    \"Yes, come,\" said Uncle Lucien.    Napoleon remained silent.    \"Do you not hear me, Napoleon?\" his father said.    \"Yes, papa,\" replied the boy.    \"Well?\"    Pauline pushed her brother; but he would not move. \"Go! do go!\" she  said. Instead, Napoleon drew away from her. Uncle Joey Fesch took  Napoleon by the arm, and sought to draw him toward the table. Even  Joseph rose and beckoned him to come. But the boy made no motion toward  the proffered pardon.    \"Stupid boy! Obstinate pig!\" cried Joseph; \"why do you not ask pardon?\"    \"Because I have done no evil,\" replied Napoleon. \"You are the stupid  one; you are the pig, I say. Did I not tell you I did not touch the  fruit?\"    \"Still obstinate!\" exclaimed \"Papa Charles,\" turning away from his  son. \"He does not wish for pardon. He is wicked. Saveria! take this  headstrong boy to the kitchen, and lay the whip upon him well, do you  hear? He has deserved it.\"    Napoleon fled to the corner, and stood at bay. Uncle Joey Fesch joined  him, as if to protect and defend him. But when big and strong Nurse  Saveria bore down upon them both, Uncle Joey, after an unsuccessful  attempt to drag Napoleon with him, turned from the enemy, and sprang  through the open window.    Then Saveria flung her arms about the little Napoleon, and, in spite of  his kickings and scratchings, bore him from the room, while all laughed  except Pauline. She stuffed her fingers into her ears to shut out the  sound of her brother's cries. But she had no need to do this. No sound  came from the punishment chamber. For not a sound, not a cry, not even a  sigh, escaped from the boy who was bearing an unmerited punishment.          CHAPTER FOUR.    BREAD AND WATER.    You will, no doubt, wonder what Napoleon's mother was doing while her  little son was undergoing his unjust punishment. Perhaps if she had been  at home things would not have turned out so badly with the boy; for  \"Mamma Letitia,\" as the Bonaparte children called their beautiful  mother, had a way about her that none of them could resist. She had much  more will and spirit, she saw things clearer and better, than did \"Papa  Charles.\"    Indeed, Napoleon said when he was a man, recalling the days of his  boyhood in Ajaccio, \"I had to be quick when I wished to do anything  naughty, for my Mamma Letitia would always restrain my warlike temper;  she would not put up with my defiance and petulance. Her tenderness was  severe, meting out punishment and reward with equal justice,--merit and  demerit, she took both into account.\"    So, you see, she would probably have understood that Napoleon spoke the  truth, and that it was some one else who had taken the fruit from the  basket of their uncle the canon. But Mamma Letitia was not at home. She  had gone to Melilli, in the country beyond Ajaccio, to visit her mother  and step-father--the father and mother of her half-brother, \"Uncle Joey  Fesch,\" as the Bonaparte children called him. Melilli was in the midst  of fields and forests and luscious vineyards, and it was a great treat  for the children to go there to visit their grandmother.    Sometimes their mother would take one or two of the children with her;  but on this visit she had gone alone. That very evening her husband was  to join her, and there had been great contention among the children as  to which of them should accompany their father.    Before leaving the supper-table \"Papa Charles\" announced that their  Uncle Santa's carriage would be at the door in half an hour; that Uncle  Joey Fesch would drive; and that Joseph and Lucien and Eliza--\"the good  children,\" as he called them--should go with him to Melilli to visit  their Grandmother Fesch, and bring back Mamma Letitia. Joseph exulted  loudly; Eliza said nothing; and baby Lucien crowed his delight. But  Pauline slipped out into the pantry where Napoleon stood silent and  still defiant. \"I am to stay with you, brother,\" she said. \"Will you be  good to me?\"    Napoleon slipped his arm about his little sister's neck; but just then  his father came from the dining-room, and the boy drew up again, haughty  and hard.    \"Well, Napoleon,\" said his father, stopping an instant before the boy,  \"I hope you are sorry and subdued. Will you now ask your Uncle Lucien's  pardon?\"    [Illustration: _\"What! Stubborn still?\"_]    Napoleon looked his father full in the face. \"I did not take that fruit,  papa,\" he said.    \"What! stubborn still?\" his father cried. \"See, then; it shall not be  said in my home that an obstinate little fellow like you can rule the  house. Since the whip has not conquered you, we will try what starving  will do. Listen! I am to go to Melilli for Mamma Letitia. Joseph, Eliza,  and Lucien, our three good ones, shall go with me; we shall be gone for  three days. As for you, Napoleon, you shall remain here, and shall have  only bread and water, unless, indeed, before our return you ask pardon  from your uncle the canon.\"    Pauline looked sadly at Napoleon, and caught his hand. Then she asked  her father, \"But he may have a little cheese with his bread, may he not,  papa?\"    \"Well--yes\"--her father yielded. \"But only common cheese, Pauline; not  broccio.\"    Now, broccio was the favorite cheese of the Corsican children, and  Pauline protested.    \"Oh, yes, papa! let him have broccio, papa,\" she said. \"Why, broccio is  the best cheese in Corsica!\"    \"And that is why Napoleon shall not have it,\" replied her father.  \"Broccio is for good boys and girls; and Napoleon is not good.\"    As he said this he glanced at Napoleon sharply, as if he really hoped  for and expected a word of repentance, a look of entreaty. But Napoleon  said nothing. He looked even more haughty and unyielding than ever; and  his father, with a word of farewell only to Pauline, left the room.    \"Poor Napoleon,\" said Pauline pityingly, as their father closed the  door. \"See, I will stay by you. But why will you not ask for pardon?\"    \"Because pardon is for the guilty, Pauline,\" Napoleon replied; \"and I am  not guilty.\"    \"And will you never ask it?\"    \"Never,\" her brother said firmly.    \"But, O Napoleon!\" cried the little girl, \"what if they should always  give you just bread and water and cheese?\"    \"And if they should, I would not give in,\" Napoleon answered. \"What can  I do? I am not master here.\"    Pauline gave a great sigh of sympathy. The thought of never having  anything to eat but bread and water and a little cheese was too much for  her courage.    \"I could confess anything, rather,\" she said. \"I would ask pardon three  times a day.\"    \"And I would not,\" said Napoleon. \"But then, I am a man.\"    Just then the three children who were to accompany their father to  Milelli, passed through the pantry, for they had been to bid Nurse  Saveria good-by. Joseph caught the last word.    \"A man, are you!\" he cried. \"Then, why not be a man, and not a baby?\"    \"Bah, rascal! and who is the greater baby?\" his brother responded. \"It  is he who cries the loudest when things go wrong; and I never cry.\"    Joseph said nothing further except, \"Good-by, obstinate one!\"    \"Good-by,\" lisped baby Lucien.    But Eliza said nothing. She did not even glance at Napoleon as she  passed him; and he simply looked at her, without a word of accusation or  farewell.    The three days passed quietly, though hungrily, for Napoleon. Uncle  Lucien said nothing to influence the boy, though he looked sadly, and  sometimes wistfully, at him; and Pauline tried to sweeten the bread and  water and cheese as much as possible by her sympathy and companionship.    Of this last, however, Napoleon did not wish much. He spent much of the  time in his grotto, brooding over his wrongs, and thinking how he would  act if people tried to treat him thus when he became a man.    The second day he dragged his toy cannon to his grotto, and made believe  he was a Corsican patriot, intrenched in his fortifications, and  holding the whole French army at bay; for though Corsica was a French  possession, the people were still smarting under their wrongs, and hated  their French oppressors, as they termed them. Some years after, when he  was a young man, Napoleon, talking about the home of his boyhood and  the troubles of Corsica, said, \"I was born while my country was dying.  Thirty thousand French thrown upon our shores, drowning the throne of  liberty in blood--such was the horrid sight that first met my view.  The cries of the dying, the groans of the oppressed, tears of despair,  surrounded my cradle at my birth.\"    It was not quite as bad as all that. But Napoleon liked to use big words  and dramatic phrases. It had been, in fact, very much like this before  Napoleon was born. He had heard all the stories of French tyranny and  Corsican courage, and, like a true Corsican, was hot with wrath against  the enslavers of his country, as he called the French. So he found an  especial pleasure in bombarding all France with his toy gun from his  grotto; and as he then felt very bitter indeed because of his treatment  at home, you may be sure the French army was horribly butchered in the  boy's make-believe battle before Napoleon's grotto.    Then he went back for his bread and water.    As he approached the house, he found that he was beginning to rebel at  the bread and water diet.    Bread and water alone, with just a little cheese, begin to grow  monotonous to a healthy boy with a good appetite, after two or three  days.    Suddenly Napoleon had a brilliant idea. \"The shepherd boys!\" he  exclaimed.    He hurried to the house, took from Saveria the bread she had put aside  for him, and was speedily out of the house again.    This time he took his way to the grazing-lands, where, upon the slopes  of the"]]]
