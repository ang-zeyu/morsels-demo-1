But if we attempt to ascend the stream of time by giving to its symbol  continually diminishing values, we are led up to a state of things in  which the formula has what is called a critical value; and if we  inquire into the state of things the instant before, we find that the  formula becomes absurd.    We thus arrive at the conception of a state of things which cannot be  conceived as the physical result of a previous state of things, and we  find that this critical condition actually existed at an epoch not in  the utmost depths of a past eternity, but separated from the present  time by a finite interval.    This idea of a beginning is one which the physical researches of  recent times have brought home to us, more than any observer of the  course of scientific thought in former times would have had reason to  expect.    But the mind of man is not, like Fourier's heated body, continually  settling down into an ultimate state of quiet uniformity, the  character of which we can already predict; it is rather like a tree,  shooting out branches which adapt themselves to the new aspects of the  sky towards which they climb, and roots which contort themselves among  the strange strata of the earth into which they delve.  To us who  breathe only the spirit of our own age, and know only the  characteristics of contemporary thought, it is as impossible to  predict the general tone of the science of the future as it is to  anticipate the particular discoveries which it will make.    Physical research is continually revealing to us new features of  natural processes, and we are thus compelled to search for new forms  of thought appropriate to these features.  Hence the importance of a  careful study of those relations between mathematics and Physics which  determine the conditions under which the ideas derived from one  department of physics may be safely used in forming ideas to be  employed in a new department.    The figure of speech or of thought by which we transfer the language  and ideas of a familiar science to one with which we are less  acquainted may be called Scientific Metaphor.    Thus the words Velocity, Momentum, Force, &c. have acquired certain  precise meanings in Elementary Dynamics.  They are also employed in  the Dynamics of a Connected System in a sense which, though perfectly  analogous to the elementary sense, is wider and more general.    These generalized forms of elementary ideas may be called metaphorical  terms in the sense in which every abstract term is metaphorical.  The  characteristic of a truly scientific system of metaphors is that each  term in its metaphorical use retains all the formal relations to the  other terms of the system which it had in its original use.  The  method is then truly scientific--that is, not only a legitimate  product of science, but capable of generating science in its turn.    There are certain electrical phenomena, again, which are connected  together by relations of the same form as those which connect  dynamical phenomena.  To apply to these the phrases of dynamics with  proper distinctions and provisional reservations is an example of a  metaphor of a bolder kind; but it is a legitimate metaphor if it  conveys a true idea of the electrical relations to those who have been  already trained in dynamics.    Suppose, then, that we have successfully introduced certain ideas  belonging to an elementary science by applying them metaphorically to  some new class of phenomena.  It becomes an important philosophical  question to determine in what degree the applicability of the old  ideas to the new subject may be taken as evidence that the new  phenomena are physically similar to the old.    The best instances for the determination of this question are those in  which two different explanations have been given of the same thing.    The most celebrated case of this kind is that of the corpuscular and  the undulatory theories of light.  Up to a certain point the phenomena  of light are equally well explained by both; beyond this point, one of  them fails.    To understand the true relation of these theories in that part of the  field where they seem equally applicable we must look at them in the  light which Hamilton has thrown upon them by his discovery that to  every brachistochrone problem there corresponds a problem of free  motion, involving different velocities and times, but resulting in the  same geometrical path.  Professor Tait has written a very interesting  paper on this subject.    According to a theory of electricity which is making great progress in  Germany, two electrical particles act on one another directly at a  distance, but with a force which, according to Weber, depends on their  relative velocity, and according to a theory hinted at by Gauss, and  developed by Riemann, Lorenz, and Neumann, acts not instantaneously,  but after a time depending on the distance.  The power with which this  theory, in the hands of these eminent men, explains every kind of  electrical phenomena must be studied in order to be appreciated.    Another theory of electricity, which I prefer, denies action at a  distance and attributes electric action to tensions and pressures in  an all-pervading medium, these stresses being the same in kind with  those familiar to engineers, and the medium being identical with that  in which light is supposed to be propagated.    Both these theories are found to explain not only the phenomena by the  aid of which they were originally constructed, but other phenomena,  which were not thought of or perhaps not known at the time; and both  have independently arrived at the same numerical result, which gives  the absolute velocity of light in terms of electrical quantities.    That theories apparently so fundamentally opposed should have so large  a field of truth common to both is a fact the philosophical importance  of which we cannot fully appreciate till we have reached a scientific  altitude from which the true relation between hypotheses so different  can be seen.    I shall only make one more remark on the relation between Mathematics  and Physics.  In themselves, one is an operation of the mind, the  other is a dance of molecules.  The molecules have laws of their own,  some of which we select as most intelligible to us and most amenable  to our calculation.  We form a theory from these partial data, and we  ascribe any deviation of the actual phenomena from this theory to  disturbing causes.  At the same time we confess that what we call  disturbing causes are simply those parts of the true circumstances  which we do not know or have neglected, and we endeavour in future to  take account of them.  We thus acknowledge that the so-called  disturbance is a mere figment of the mind, not a fact of nature, and  that in natural action there is no disturbance.    But this is not the only way in which the harmony of the material with  the mental operation may be disturbed.  The mind of the mathematician  is subject to many disturbing causes, such as fatigue, loss of memory,  and hasty conclusions; and it is found that, from these and other  causes, mathematicians make mistakes.    I am not prepared to deny that, to some mind of a higher order than  ours, each of these errors might be traced to the regular operation of  the laws of actual thinking; in fact we ourselves often do detect, not  only errors of calculation, but the causes of these errors.  This,  however, by no means alters our conviction that they are errors, and  that one process of thought is right and another process wrong.  I    One of the most profound mathematicians and thinkers of our time, the  late George Boole, when reflecting on the precise and almost  mathematical character of the laws of right thinking as compared with  the exceedingly perplexing though perhaps equally determinate laws of  actual and fallible thinking, was led to another of those points of  view from which Science seems to look out into a region beyond her own  domain.    \"We must admit,\" he says, \"that there exist laws\" (of thought) \"which  even the rigour of their mathematical forms does not preserve from  violation.  We must ascribe to them an authority, the essence of which  does not consist in power, a supremacy which the analogy of the  inviolable order of the natural world in no way assists us to  comprehend.\"          Introductory Lecture on Experimental Physics.    James Clerk Maxwell      The University of Cambridge, in accordance with that law of its  evolution, by which, while maintaining the strictest continuity  between the successive phases of its history, it adapts itself with  more or less promptness to the requirements of the times, has lately  instituted a course of Experimental Physics.  This course of study,  while it requires us to maintain in action all those powers of  attention and analysis which have been so long cultivated in the  University, calls on us to exercise our senses in observation, and our  hands in manipulation.  The familiar apparatus of pen, ink, and paper  will no longer be sufficient for us, and we shall require more room  than that afforded by a seat at a desk, and a wider area than that of  the black board.  We owe it to the munificence of our Chancellor,  that, whatever be the character in other respects of the experiments  which we hope hereafter to conduct, the material facilities for their  full development will be upon a scale which has not hitherto been  surpassed.    The main feature, therefore, of Experimental Physics at Cambridge is  the Devonshire Physical Laboratory, and I think it desirable that on  the present occasion, before we enter on the details of any special  study, we should consider by what means we, the University of  Cambridge, may, as a living body, appropriate and vitalise this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4912"],[0,"Wacousta : a tale of the Pontiac conspiracy (Complete) (#5)"],[1,"of the scene we have brought more  immediately under the province of our pen. What Detroit was in 1763 it  nearly is at the present day, with this difference, however, that many  of those points which were then in a great degree isolated and rude are  now redolent with the beneficent effects of improved cultivation; and  in the immediate vicinity of that memorable bridge, where formerly  stood merely the occasional encampment of the Indian warrior, are now  to be seen flourishing farms and crops, and other marks of agricultural  industry. Of the fort of Detroit itself we will give the following  brief history:--It was, as we have already stated, erected by the  French while in the occupancy of the country by which it is more  immediately environed; subsequently, and at the final cession of the  Canadas, it was delivered over to England, with whom it remained until  the acknowledgement of the independence of the colonists by the  mother-country, when it hoisted the colours of the republic; the  British garrison marching out, and crossing over into Canada, followed  by such of the loyalists as still retained their attachment to the  English crown. At the commencement of the late war with America it was  the first and more immediate theatre of conflict, and was remarkable,  as well as Michilimackinac, for being one of the first posts of the  Americans that fell into our hands. The gallant daring, and promptness  of decision, for which the lamented general, Sir Isaac Brock, was so  eminently distinguished, achieved the conquest almost as soon as the  American declaration of war had been made known in Canada; and on this  occasion we ourselves had the good fortune to be selected as part of  the guard of honour, whose duty it was to lower the flag of America,  and substitute that of England in its place. On the approach, however,  of an overwhelming army of the enemy in the autumn of the ensuing year  it was abandoned by our troops, after having been dismantled and  reduced, in its more combustible parts, to ashes. The Americans, who  have erected new fortifications on the site of the old, still retain  possession of a post to which they attach considerable importance, from  the circumstance of its being a key to the more western portions of the  Union.          CHAPTER II.    It was during the midnight watch, late in September, 1763, that the  English garrison of Detroit, in North America, was thrown into the  utmost consternation by the sudden and mysterious introduction of a  stranger within its walls. The circumstance at this moment was  particularly remarkable; for the period was so fearful and pregnant  with events of danger, the fort being assailed on every side by a  powerful and vindictive foe, that a caution and vigilance of no common  kind were unceasingly exercised by the prudent governor for the safety  of those committed to his charge. A long series of hostilities had been  pursued by the North-American Indians against the subjects of England,  within the few years that had succeeded to the final subjection of the  Canadas to her victorious arms; and many and sanguinary were the  conflicts in which the devoted soldiery were made to succumb to the  cunning and numbers of their savage enemies. In those lone regions,  both officers and men, in their respective ranks, were, by a  communionship of suffering, isolation, and peculiarity of duty, drawn  towards each other with feelings of almost fraternal affection; and the  fates of those who fell were lamented with sincerity of soul, and  avenged, when opportunity offered, with a determination prompted  equally by indignation and despair. This sentiment of union, existing  even between men and officers of different corps, was, with occasional  exceptions, of course doubly strengthened among those who fought under  the same colours, and acknowledged the same head; and, as it often  happened in Canada, during this interesting period, that a single  regiment was distributed into two or three fortresses, each so far  removed from the other that communication could with the utmost  facility be cut off, the anxiety and uncertainty of these detachments  became proportioned to the danger with which they knew themselves to be  more immediately beset. The garrison of Detroit, at the date above  named, consisted of a third of the ---- regiment, the remainder of  which occupied the forts of Michilimackinac and Niagara, and to each  division of this regiment was attached an officer's command of  artillery. It is true that no immediate overt act of hostility had for  some time been perpetrated by the Indians, who were assembled in force  around the former garrison; but the experienced officer to whom the  command had been intrusted was too sensible of the craftiness of the  surrounding hordes to be deceived, by any outward semblance of amity,  into neglect of those measures of precaution which were so  indispensable to the surety of his trust.    In this he pursued a line of policy happily adapted to the delicate  nature of his position. Unwilling to excite the anger or wound the  pride of the chiefs, by any outward manifestation of distrust, he  affected to confide in the sincerity of their professions, and, by  inducing his officers to mix occasionally in their councils, and his  men in the amusements of the inferior warriors, contrived to impress  the conviction that he reposed altogether on their faith. But, although  these acts were in some degree coerced by the necessity of the times,  and a perfect knowledge of all the misery that must accrue to them in  the event of their provoking the Indians into acts of open hostility,  the prudent governor took such precautions as were deemed efficient to  defeat any treacherous attempt at violation of the tacit treaty on the  part of the natives. The officers never ventured out, unless escorted  by a portion of their men, who, although appearing to be dispersed  among the warriors, still kept sufficiently together to be enabled, in  a moment of emergency, to afford succour not only to each other but to  their superiors. On these occasions, as a further security against  surprise, the troops left within were instructed to be in readiness, at  a moment's warning, to render assistance, if necessary, to their  companions, who seldom, on any occasion, ventured out of reach of the  cannon of the fort, the gate of which was hermetically closed, while  numerous supernumerary sentinels were posted along the ramparts, with a  view to give the alarm if any thing extraordinary was observed to occur  without.    Painful and harassing as were the precautions it was found necessary to  adopt on these occasions, and little desirous as were the garrison to  mingle with the natives on such terms, still the plan was pursued by  the Governor from the policy already named: nay, it was absolutely  essential to the future interests of England that the Indians should be  won over by acts of confidence and kindness; and so little disposition  had hitherto been manifested by the English to conciliate, that every  thing was to be apprehended from the untameable rancour with which  these people were but too well disposed to repay a neglect at once  galling to their pride and injurious to their interests.    Such, for a term of many months, had been the trying and painful duty  that had devolved on the governor of Detroit; when, in the summer of  1763, the whole of the western tribes of Indians, as if actuated by one  common impulse, suddenly threw off the mask, and commenced a series of  the most savage trespasses upon the English settlers in the vicinity of  the several garrisons, who were cut off in detail, without mercy, and  without reference to either age or sex. On the first alarm the weak  bodies of troops, as a last measure of security, shut themselves up in  their respective forts, where they were as incapable of rendering  assistance to others as of receiving it themselves. In this emergency  the prudence and forethought of the governor of Detroit were eminently  conspicuous; for, having long foreseen the possibility of such a  crisis, he had caused a plentiful supply of all that was necessary to  the subsistence and defence of the garrison to be provided at an  earlier period, so that, if foiled in their attempts at stratagem,  there was little chance that the Indians would speedily reduce them by  famine. To guard against the former, a vigilant watch was constantly  kept by the garrison both day and night, while the sentinels, doubled  in number, were constantly on the alert. Strict attention, moreover,  was paid to such parts of the ramparts as were considered most  assailable by a cunning and midnight enemy; and, in order to prevent  any imprudence on the part of the garrison, all egress or ingress was  prohibited that had not the immediate sanction of the chief. With this  view the keys of the gate were given in trust to the officer of the  guard; to whom, however, it was interdicted to use them unless by  direct and positive order of the Governor. In addition to this  precaution, the sentinels on duty at the gate had strict private  instructions not to suffer any one to pass either in or out unless  conducted by the governor in person; and this restriction extended even  to the officer of the guard.    Such being the cautious discipline established in the fort, the  appearance of a stranger within its walls at the still hour of midnight  could not fail to be regarded as an extraordinary event, and to excite  an apprehension which could scarcely have been surpassed had a numerous  and armed band of savages suddenly appeared among them. The first  intimation of this fact was given by the violent ringing of an alarm  bell; a rope communicating with which was suspended in the Governor's  apartments, for the purpose of arousing the slumbering soldiers in any  case of pressing emergency. Soon afterwards the Governor himself was  seen to"]]]
