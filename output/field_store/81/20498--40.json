This agreeable labor accomplished, the wagon at last emerged;  but if I mention that some interruption of this sort occurred at least  four or five times a day for a fortnight, the reader will understand  that our progress toward the Platte was not without its obstacles.    We traveled six or seven miles farther, and \"nooned\" near a brook. On  the point of resuming our journey, when the horses were all driven down  to water, my homesick charger, Pontiac, made a sudden leap across, and  set off at a round trot for the settlements. I mounted my remaining  horse, and started in pursuit. Making a circuit, I headed the runaway,  hoping to drive him back to camp; but he instantly broke into a gallop,  made a wide tour on the prairie, and got past me again. I tried this  plan repeatedly, with the same result; Pontiac was evidently disgusted  with the prairie; so I abandoned it, and tried another, trotting along  gently behind him, in hopes that I might quietly get near enough to  seize the trail-rope which was fastened to his neck, and dragged about a  dozen feet behind him. The chase grew interesting. For mile after mile  I followed the rascal, with the utmost care not to alarm him, and  gradually got nearer, until at length old Hendrick's nose was fairly  brushed by the whisking tail of the unsuspecting Pontiac. Without  drawing rein, I slid softly to the ground; but my long heavy rifle  encumbered me, and the low sound it made in striking the horn of the  saddle startled him; he pricked up his ears, and sprang off at a run.  \"My friend,\" thought I, remounting, \"do that again, and I will shoot  you!\"    Fort Leavenworth was about forty miles distant, and thither I determined  to follow him. I made up my mind to spend a solitary and supperless  night, and then set out again in the morning. One hope, however,  remained. The creek where the wagon had stuck was just before us;  Pontiac might be thirsty with his run, and stop there to drink. I kept  as near to him as possible, taking every precaution not to alarm him  again; and the result proved as I had hoped: for he walked deliberately  among the trees, and stooped down to the water. I alighted, dragged old  Hendrick through the mud, and with a feeling of infinite satisfaction  picked up the slimy trail-rope and twisted it three times round my hand.  \"Now let me see you get away again!\" I thought, as I remounted. But  Pontiac was exceedingly reluctant to turn back; Hendrick, too, who  had evidently flattered himself with vain hopes, showed the utmost  repugnance, and grumbled in a manner peculiar to himself at being  compelled to face about. A smart cut of the whip restored his  cheerfulness; and dragging the recovered truant behind, I set out in  search of the camp. An hour or two elapsed, when, near sunset, I saw the  tents, standing on a rich swell of the prairie, beyond a line of woods,  while the bands of horses were feeding in a low meadow close at hand.  There sat Jack C., cross-legged, in the sun, splicing a trail-rope,  and the rest were lying on the grass, smoking and telling stories. That  night we enjoyed a serenade from the wolves, more lively than any with  which they had yet favored us; and in the morning one of the musicians  appeared, not many rods from the tents, quietly seated among the horses,  looking at us with a pair of large gray eyes; but perceiving a rifle  leveled at him, he leaped up and made off in hot haste.    I pass by the following day or two of our journey, for nothing occurred  worthy of record. Should any one of my readers ever be impelled to visit  the prairies, and should he choose the route of the Platte (the best,  perhaps, that can be adopted), I can assure him that he need not  think to enter at once upon the paradise of his imagination. A dreary  preliminary, protracted crossing of the threshold awaits him before  he finds himself fairly upon the verge of the \"great American desert,\"  those barren wastes, the haunts of the buffalo and the Indian, where  the very shadow of civilization lies a hundred leagues behind him. The  intervening country, the wide and fertile belt that extends for  several hundred miles beyond the extreme frontier, will probably answer  tolerably well to his preconceived ideas of the prairie; for this it  is from which picturesque tourists, painters, poets, and novelists, who  have seldom penetrated farther, have derived their conceptions of the  whole region. If he has a painter's eye, he may find his period of  probation not wholly void of interest. The scenery, though tame, is  graceful and pleasing. Here are level plains, too wide for the eye  to measure green undulations, like motionless swells of the ocean;  abundance of streams, followed through all their windings by lines of  woods and scattered groves. But let him be as enthusiastic as he may,  he will find enough to damp his ardor. His wagons will stick in the mud;  his horses will break loose; harness will give way, and axle-trees prove  unsound. His bed will be a soft one, consisting often of black mud,  of the richest consistency. As for food, he must content himself with  biscuit and salt provisions; for strange as it may seem, this tract of  country produces very little game. As he advances, indeed, he will see,  moldering in the grass by his path, the vast antlers of the elk, and  farther on, the whitened skulls of the buffalo, once swarming over this  now deserted region. Perhaps, like us, he may journey for a fortnight,  and see not so much as the hoof-print of a deer; in the spring, not even  a prairie hen is to be had.    Yet, to compensate him for this unlooked-for deficiency of game, he  will find himself beset with \"varmints\" innumerable. The wolves will  entertain him with a concerto at night, and skulk around him by day,  just beyond rifle shot; his horse will step into badger-holes; from  every marsh and mud puddle will arise the bellowing, croaking, and  trilling of legions of frogs, infinitely various in color, shape and  dimensions. A profusion of snakes will glide away from under his horse's  feet, or quietly visit him in his tent at night; while the pertinacious  humming of unnumbered mosquitoes will banish sleep from his eyelids.  When thirsty with a long ride in the scorching sun over some boundless  reach of prairie, he comes at length to a pool of water, and alights to  drink, he discovers a troop of young tadpoles sporting in the bottom of  his cup. Add to this, that all the morning the hot sun beats upon him  with sultry, penetrating heat, and that, with provoking regularity, at  about four o'clock in the afternoon, a thunderstorm rises and drenches  him to the skin. Such being the charms of this favored region, the  reader will easily conceive the extent of our gratification at learning  that for a week we had been journeying on the wrong track! How this  agreeable discovery was made I will presently explain.    One day, after a protracted morning's ride, we stopped to rest at noon  upon the open prairie. No trees were in sight; but close at hand, a  little dribbling brook was twisting from side to side through a hollow;  now forming holes of stagnant water, and now gliding over the mud in a  scarcely perceptible current, among a growth of sickly bushes, and great  clumps of tall rank grass. The day was excessively hot and oppressive.  The horses and mules were rolling on the prairie to refresh themselves,  or feeding among the bushes in the hollow. We had dined; and Delorier,  puffing at his pipe, knelt on the grass, scrubbing our service of tin  plate. Shaw lay in the shade, under the cart, to rest for a while,  before the word should be given to \"catch up.\" Henry Chatillon, before  lying down, was looking about for signs of snakes, the only living  things that he feared, and uttering various ejaculations of disgust,  at finding several suspicious-looking holes close to the cart. I sat  leaning against the wheel in a scanty strip of shade, making a pair of  hobbles to replace those which my contumacious steed Pontiac had  broken the night before. The camp of our friends, a rod or two distant,  presented the same scene of lazy tranquillity.    \"Hallo!\" cried Henry, looking up from his inspection of the snake-holes,  \"here comes the old captain!\"    The captain approached, and stood for a moment contemplating us in  silence.    \"I say, Parkman,\" he began, \"look at Shaw there, asleep under the cart,  with the tar dripping off the hub of the wheel on his shoulder!\"    At this Shaw got up, with his eyes half opened, and feeling the part  indicated, he found his hand glued fast to his red flannel shirt.    \"He'll look well when he gets among the squaws, won't he?\" observed the  captain, with a grin.    He then crawled under the cart, and began to tell stories of which his  stock was inexhaustible. Yet every moment he would glance nervously at  the horses. At last he jumped up in great excitement. \"See that horse!  There--that fellow just walking over the hill! By Jove; he's off. It's  your big horse, Shaw; no it isn't, it's Jack's! Jack! Jack! hallo,  Jack!\" Jack thus invoked, jumped up and stared vacantly at us.    \"Go and catch your horse, if you don't want to lose him!\" roared the  captain.    Jack instantly set off at a run through the grass, his broad pantaloons  flapping about his feet. The captain gazed anxiously till he saw  that the horse was caught; then he sat down, with a countenance of  thoughtfulness and care.    \"I tell you what it is,\" he said, \"this will never do at all. We shall  lose every horse in the band someday or other, and then a pretty plight  we should be in! Now I am convinced that the only way for us is to have  every man in the camp stand horse-guard in rotation whenever we stop.

Once become militant, Mohammed turned from the purely defensive to the  aggressive attitude, with such success that a great part of the Arab tribes  were compelled to accept Islam, \"obedience to Allah and His Messenger.\" The  rule formerly insisted upon: \"No compulsion in religion,\" was sacrificed,  since experience taught him, that the truth was more easily forced upon  men by violence than by threats which would be fulfilled only after the  resurrection. Naturally, the religious value of the conversions sank in  proportion as their number increased. The Prophet of world renouncement  in Mecca wished to win souls for his faith; the Prophet-Prince in Medina  needed subjects and fighters for his army. Yet he was still the same  Mohammed.    Parallel with his altered position towards the heathen Arabs went a  readjustment of his point of view towards the followers of Scripture.  Mohammed never pretended to preach a new religion; he demanded in the name  of Allah the same Islam (submission) that Moses, Jesus, and former prophets  had demanded of their nations. In his earlier revelations he always points  out the identity of his \"Qorans\" with the contents of the sacred books of  Jews and Christians, in the sure conviction that these will confirm his  assertion if asked. In Medina he was disillusioned by finding neither Jews  nor Christians prepared to acknowledge an Arabian prophet, not even for the  Arabs only; so he was led to distinguish between the _true_ contents of the  Bible and that which had been made of it by the falsification of later  Jews and Christians. He preferred now to connect his own revelations more  immediately with those of Abraham, no books of whom could be cited against  him, and who was acknowledged by Jews and Christians without being himself  either a Jew or a Christian.    This turn, this particular connection of Islam with Abraham, made it  possible for him, by means of an adaptation of the biblical legends  concerning Abraham, Hagar, and Ishmael, to include in his religion a set of  religious customs of the Meccans, especially the hajj.[1] Thus Islam became  more Arabian, and at the same time more independent of the other revealed  religions, whose degeneracy was demonstrated by their refusal to  acknowledge Mohammed.    [Footnote 1: A complete explanation of the gradual development of the  Abraham legend in the Qoran can be found in my book _Het Mekkaansche Feest_  (The Feast of Mecca), Leiden, 1880.]    All this is to be explained without the supposition of conscious trickery  or dishonesty on the part of Mohammed. There was no other way for the  unlettered Prophet, whose belief in his mission was unshaken, to overcome  the difficulties entailed by his closer acquaintance with the tenets of  other religions.    How, then, are we to explain the starting-point of it all--Mohammed's sense  of vocation? Was it a disease of the spirit, a kind of madness? At all  events, the data are insufficient upon which to form a serious diagnosis.  Some have called it epilepsy. Sprenger, with an exaggerated display of  certainty based upon his former medical studies, gave Mohammed's disorder  the name of hysteria. Others try to find a connection between Mohammed's  extraordinary interest in the fair sex and his prophetic consciousness.  But, after all, is it explaining the spiritual life of a man, who was  certainly unique, if we put a label upon him, and thus class him with  others, who at the most shared with him certain abnormalities? A normal man  Mohammed certainly was not. But as soon as we try to give a positive name  to this negative quality, then we do the same as the heathens of Mecca, who  were violently awakened by his thundering prophecies: \"He is nothing but  one possessed, a poet, a soothsayer, a sorcerer,\" they said. Whether we say  with the old European biographers \"impostor,\" or with the modern ones put  \"epileptic,\" or \"hysteric\" in its place, makes little difference. The  Meccans ended by submitting to him, and conquering a world under the banner  of his faith. We, with the diffidence which true science implies, feel  obliged merely to call him Mohammed, and to seek in the Qoran, and with  great cautiousness in the Tradition, a few principal points of his life and  work, in order to see how in his mind the intense feeling of discontent  during the misery of his youth, together with a great self-reliance, a  feeling of spiritual superiority to his surroundings, developed into  a call, the form of which was largely decided by Jewish and Christian  influence.    While being struck by various weaknesses which disfigured this great  personality and which he himself freely confessed, we must admire the  perseverance with which he retained his faith in his divine mission, not  discouraged by twelve years of humiliation, nor by the repudiation of the  \"People of Scripture,\" upon whom he had relied as his principal witnesses,  nor yet by numbers of temporary rebuffs during his struggle for the  dominion of Allah and His Messenger, which he carried on through the whole  of Arabia.    Was Mohammed conscious of the universality of his mission? In the beginning  he certainly conceived his work as merely the Arabian part of a universal  task, which, for other parts of the world, was laid upon other messengers.  In the Medina period he ever more decidedly chose the direction of \"forcing  to comply.\" He was content only when the heathens perceived that further  resistance to Allah's hosts was useless; their understanding of his \"clear  Arabic Qoran\" was no longer the principal object of his striving. _Such_  an Islam could equally well be forced upon _non-Arabian_ heathens. And,  as regards the \"People of Scripture,\" since Mohammed's endeavour to be  recognized by them had failed, he had taken up his position opposed to  them, even above them. With the rise of his power he became hard and cruel  to the Jews in North-Arabia, and from Jews and Christians alike in Arabia  he demanded submission to his authority, since it had proved impossible to  make them recognize his divine mission. This demand could quite logically  be extended to all Christians; in the first place to those of the Byzantine  Empire. But did Mohammed himself come to these conclusions in the last part  of his life? Are the words in which Allah spoke to him: \"We have sent thee  to men in general,\"[1] and a few expressions of the same sort, to be taken  in that sense, or does \"humanity\" here, as in many other places in the  Qoran, mean those with whom Mohammed had especially to do? Noldeke is  strongly of opinion that the principal lines of the program of conquest  carried out after Mohammed's death, had been drawn by the Prophet himself.  Lammens and others deny with equal vigour, that Mohammed ever looked upon  the whole world as the field of his mission. This shows that the solution  is not evident.[2]    [Footnote 1: _Qoran_, xxxiv., 27. The translation of this verse has  always been a subject of great difference of opinion. At the time of its  revelation--as fixed by Mohammedan as well as by western authorities--the  universal conception of Mohammed's mission was quite out of question.]    [Footnote 2: Professor T.W. Arnold in the 2d edition (London, 1913) of  his valuable work _The Preaching of Islam_ (especially pp. 28-31), warmly  endeavours to prove that Mohammed from the beginning considered his mission  as universal. He weakens his argument more than is necessary by placing the  Tradition upon an almost equal footing with the Qoran as a source, and by  ignoring the historical development which is obvious in the Qoran itself.  In this way he does not perceive the great importance of the history of the  Abraham legend in Mohammed's conception. Moreover, the translation of  the verses of the Qoran on p. 29 sometimes says more than the original.  _Lil-nas_ is not \"_to mankind_\" but \"_to men_,\" in the sense of \"_to  everybody_.\" _Qoran_, xvi., 86, does not say: \"One day we will raise up  a witness out of every nation,\" but: \"On the day (_i.e._, the day of  resurrection) when we will raise up, etc.,\" which would seem to refer to  the theme so constantly repeated in the Qoran, that each nation will be  confronted on the Day of Judgment with the prophet sent to it. When the  Qoran is called an \"admonition to the world (_'alamin_)\" and Mohammed's  mission a \"mercy to the world (_'alamin_),\" then we must remember that  'alamin is one of the most misused rhymewords in the Qoran (e.g., _Qoran_,  xv., 70); and we should not therefore translate it emphatically as \"all  created beings,\" unless the universality of Mohammed's mission is firmly  established by other proofs. And this is far from being the case.]    In our valuation of Mohammed's sayings we cannot lay too much stress upon  his incapability of looking far ahead. The final aims which Mohammed set  himself were considered by sane persons as unattainable. His firm belief in  the realization of the vague picture of the future which he had conceived,  nay, which Allah held before him, drove him to the uttermost exertion of  his mental power in order to surmount the innumerable unexpected obstacles  which he encountered. Hence the variability of the practical directions  contained in the Qoran; they are constantly altered according to  circumstances. Allah's words during the last part of Mohammed's life:  \"This day have I perfected your religion for you, and have I filled up  the measure of my favours towards you, and chosen Islam for you as your  religion,\" have in no way the meaning of the exclamation: \"It is finished,\"  of the dying Christ. They are only a cry of jubilation over the degradation  of the heathen Arabs by the triumph of Allah's weapons. At Mohammed's death  everything was still unstable; and the vital questions for Islam were  subjects of contention between the"]]]
