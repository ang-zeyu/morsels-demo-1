If in the same zone the ocean contain at depths of  seven or eight hundred fathoms, water the temperature of which is at 7  degrees, that is to say, twelve or thirteen degrees colder than the  maximum of the heat* of the equinoctial atmosphere over the sea, I  think it must be considered as a direct proof of a submarine current,  carrying the waters of the pole towards the equator. (* It is almost  superfluous to observe that I am considering here only that part of  the atmosphere lying on the ocean between 10 degrees north and 10  degrees south latitude. Towards the northern limits of the torrid  zone, in latitude 23 degrees, whither the north winds bring with an  extreme rapidity the cold air of Canada, the thermometer falls at sea  as low as 16 degrees, and even lower.) We will not here solve the  delicate problem, as to the manner in which, within the tropics and in  the temperate zone, (for example, in the Caribbean Sea and in the  lakes of Switzerland,) these inferior strata of water, cooled to 4 or  7 degrees, act upon the temperature of the stony strata of the globe  which they cover; and how these same strata, the primitive temperature  of which is, within the tropics, 27 degrees, and at the lake of Geneva  10 degrees, react upon the half-frozen waters at the bottom of the  lakes, and of the equinoctial ocean. These questions are of the  highest importance, both with regard to the economy of animals that  live habitually at the bottom of fresh and salt waters, and to the  theory of the distribution of heat in lands surrounded by vast and  deep seas.    The lake of Valencia is full of islands, which embellish the scenery  by the picturesque form of their rocks, and the beauty of the  vegetation with which they are covered: an advantage which this  tropical lake possesses over those of the Alps. The islands are  fifteen in number, distributed in three groups;* without reckoning  Morro and Cabrera, which are already joined to the shore. (* The  position of these islands is as follows: northward, near the shore,  the Isla de Cura; on the south-east, Burro, Horno, Otama, Sorro,  Caiguira, Nuevos Penones, or the Aparecidos; on the north-west, Cabo  Blanco, or Isla de Aves, and Chamberg; on the south-west, Brucha and  Culebra. In the centre of the lake rise, like shoals or small detached  rocks, Vagre, Fraile, Penasco, and Pan de Azucar.) They are partly  cultivated, and extremely fertile on account of the vapours that rise  from the lake. Burro, the largest of these islands, is two miles in  length, and is inhabited by some families of mestizos, who rear goats.  These simple people seldom visit the shore of Mocundo. To them the  lake appears of immense extent; they have plantains, cassava, milk,  and a little fish. A hut constructed of reeds; hammocks woven from the  cotton which the neighbouring fields produce; a large stone on which  the fire is made; the ligneous fruit of the tutuma (the calabash) in  which they draw water, constitute their domestic establishment. An old  mestizo who offered us some goat's milk had a beautiful daughter. We  learned from our guide, that solitude had rendered him as mistrustful  as he might perhaps have been made by the society of men. The day  before our arrival, some hunters had visited the island. They were  overtaken by the shades of night; and preferred sleeping in the open  air to returning to Mocundo. This news spread alarm throughout the  island. The father obliged the young girl to climb up a very lofty  zamang or acacia, which grew in the plain at some distance from the  hut, while he stretched himself at the foot of the tree, and did not  permit his daughter to descend till the hunters had departed.    The lake is in general well stocked with fish; though it furnishes  only three kinds, the flesh of which is soft and insipid, the guavina,  the vagre, and the sardina. The two last descend into the lake with  the streams that flow into it. The guavina, of which I made a drawing  on the spot, is 20 inches long and 3.5 broad. It is perhaps a new  species of the genus erythrina of Gronovius. It has large silvery  scales edged with green. This fish is extremely voracious, and  destroys other kinds. The fishermen assured us that a small crocodile,  the bava,* which often approached us when we were bathing, contributes  also to the destruction of the fish. (* The bava, or bavilla, is very  common at Bordones, near Cumana. See volume 1. The name of bava,  baveuse, has misled M. Depons; he takes this reptile for a fish of our  seas, the Blennius pholis. Voyage a la Terre Ferme. The Blennius  pholis, smooth blenny, is called by the French baveuse (slaverer), in  Spanish, baba.) We never could succeed in procuring this reptile so as  to examine it closely: it generally attains only three or four feet in  length. It is said to be very harmless; its habits however, as well as  its form, much resemble those of the alligator (Crocodilus acutus). It  swims in such a manner as to show only the point of its snout, and the  extremity of its tail; and places itself at mid-day on the bare beach.  It is certainly neither a monitor (the real monitors living only in  the old continent,) nor the sauvegarde of Seba (Lacerta teguixin,)  which dives and does not swim. It is somewhat remarkable that the lake  of Valencia, and the whole system of small rivers flowing into it,  have no large alligators, though this dangerous animal abounds a few  leagues off in the streams which flow either into the Apure or the  Orinoco, or immediately into the Caribbean Sea between Porto Cabello  and La Guayra.    In the islands that rise like bastions in the midst of the waters, and  wherever the rocky bottom of the lake is visible, I recognised a  uniform direction in the strata of gneiss. This direction is nearly  that of the chains of mountains on the north and south of the lake. In  the hills of Cabo Blanco there are found among the gneiss, angular  masses of opaque quartz, slightly translucid on the edges, and varying  from grey to deep black. This quartz passes sometimes into hornstein,  and sometimes into kieselschiefer (schistose jasper). I do not think  it constitutes a vein. The waters of the lake* decompose the gneiss by  erosion in a very extraordinary manner. (* The water of the lake is  not salt, as is asserted at Caracas. It may be drunk without being  filtered. On evaporation it leaves a very small residuum of carbonate  of lime, and perhaps a little nitrate of potash. It is surprising that  an inland lake should not be richer in alkaline and earthy salts,  acquired from the neighbouring soils. I have found parts of it porous,  almost cellular, and split in the form of cauliflowers, fixed on  gneiss perfectly compact. Perhaps the action ceases with the movement  of the waves, and the alternate contact of air and water.    The island of Chamberg is remarkable for its height. It is a rock of  gneiss, with two summits in the form of a saddle, and raised two  hundred feet above the surface of the water. The slope of this rock is  barren, and affords only nourishment for a few plants of clusia with  large white flowers. But the view of the lake and of the richly  cultivated neighbouring valleys is beautiful, and their aspect is  wonderful after sunset, when thousands of aquatic birds, herons,  flamingoes, and wild ducks cross the lake to roost in the islands, and  the broad zone of mountains which surrounds the horizon is covered  with fire. The inhabitants, as we have already mentioned, burn the  meadows in order to produce fresher and finer grass. Gramineous plants  abound, especially at the summit of the chain; and those vast  conflagrations extend sometimes the length of a thousand toises, and  appear like streams of lava overflowing the ridge of the mountains.  When reposing on the banks of the lake to enjoy the soft freshness of  the air in one of those beautiful evenings peculiar to the tropics, it  is delightful to contemplate in the waves as they beat the shore, the  reflection of the red fires that illumine the horizon.    Among the plants which grow on the rocky islands of the lake of  Valencia, many have been believed to be peculiar to those spots,  because till now they have not been discovered elsewhere. Such are the  papaw-trees of the lake; and the tomato* of the island of Cura. (* The  tomatoes are cultivated, as well as the papaw-tree of the lake, in the  Botanical Garden of Berlin, to which I had sent some seeds.) The  latter differs from our Solanum lycopersicum; the fruit is round and  small, but has a fine flavour; it is now cultivated at La Victoria, at  Nueva Valencia, and everywhere in the valleys of Aragua. The  papaw-tree of the lake (papaya de la laguna) abounds also in the  island of Cura and at Cabo Blanco; its trunk shoots higher than that  of the common papaw (Carica papaya), but its fruit is only half as  large, perfectly spherical, without projecting ribs, and four or five  inches in diameter. When cut open it is found quite filled with seeds,  and without those hollow places which occur constantly in the common  papaw. The taste of this fruit, of which I have often eaten, is  extremely sweet.* (* The people of the country attribute to it an  astringent quality, and call it tapaculo.) I know not whether it be a  variety of the Carica microcarpa, described by Jacquin.    The environs of the lake are insalubrious only in times of great  drought, when the waters in their retreat leave a muddy sediment  exposed to the rays of the sun. The banks, shaded by tufts of  Coccoloba barbadensis, and decorated with fine liliaceous plants,* (*  Pancratium undulatum, Amaryllis nervosa.) remind us, by the appearance  of the aquatic vegetation, of the marshy shores of our lakes in  Europe. We find there, pondweed (potamogeton), chara, and cats'-tail  three feet high, which it is difficult not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7015"],[0,"Buddhist Psalms translated from the Japanese of Shinran Shonin (#5)"],[1,"company of the Bodhisattvas utter these words, \"When  we became wise in holiness, yea, we who have striven through Kalpas  unnumbered,    126. \"Yet could we not root out our earthly desires which are the  very seed of birth and death. But through that only way of the  meditation of the Highest did we attain unto the final deliverance  that hath destroyed all our sin.\"      OF THANKSGIVING FOR VASUBANDH, THE GREAT TEACHER OF INDIA    127. Among those doctrines taught of our Lord Vasubandh, the great  priest hath persuaded us who are full of sinful desires to accept  the Divine Promise of our infinite Father.    128. Only to Him who is above all things is known the glory of the  Land of Peace. Wide as the sky and boundless is it spread forth.    129. Whoso believeth in the power of the Divine Promise shall verily  be at one with the holy Essence, even as the turbid stream is clear  and pure within the ocean depth when they have flowed together.    130. When the assemblage of the believers in the holy faith is born  within that Land of Purity that hath sprung from the lotus of the  true enlightenment, soon shall their heart's desire be fulfilled in  them.    131. The heavenly spirits and those souls freed from illusion, they  who are born in the land of purity from the wisdom deep as the ocean  of the Divine Promise, differ not the one from the other in their  powers. Pure are they as the air is pure.    132. Vasubandh, that exalted master of excelling works, who himself  hath found refuge in the Buddha of Infinite Light, hath declared  that whoso is borne in the Vehicle of the Divine Promise shall  without doubt attain unto the Promised Land.    133. Whoso taketh refuge in the Buddha of Infinite Light, that light  that shineth unto all the worlds of the Ten Regions, shall be  called, according to the teaching of that master of excelling works,  a man whose heart is great, and to him shall the True Light be  shown.    134. He whose heart is great and who shall attain unto the true  enlightenment is he also that desireth the salvation of all living,  and verily the true faith given of that Blessed One is salvation.    135. The single heart perceiveth the true faith, and so doing is  strong and clear as the diamond, and this strength is the wisdom of  the supreme that strengthened us.    136. When we shall attain, unto the Promised Land, which is that  Nirvana past all understanding, there shall we labour abundantly for  the salvation of all living things. For so the Sutra teaches us in  these words: \"A heart that inclineth to the succour of others.\"      OF THANKSGIVING FOR DONRAN, THE GREAT TEACHER OF CHINA    137. Donran, that great teacher of China, being instructed of  Bodhi-ruci, the priest of India, sought refuge in the Land of  Purity, and thus doing he burned with fire the books of the Taoist  teaching which he had aforetime held in honour.    138. Having thus cast from him the writings that he had so many  years diligently studied, he preached unto all men the doctrine of  the Divine Promise, and, so teaching, he led men that are fast bound  in the fetters of illusion, in at the Gate of the Great Peace.    139. A mighty King of this world brought homage unto him in his  monastery and put unto him this question, saying: \"If so it is that  the Land of Purity should be in all the Ten Regions, how then is it  declared unto us in the Sutra that it is in the Western Heaven?\"    140. And with humble piety he replied:    \"Of this matter can I not tell thee. It is too high for me. Still am  I in the lower rank of wisdom, even still small is my knowledge. I  cannot fathom this great mystery.\"    141. All men in the priesthood or the people who know not the rock  of their trust, did Donran the Great Priest guide unto the sure  refuge of the doctrine of the Land of Bliss.    142. He abode in the Temple of the Great Rock, being favourably  bidden thereto by the King of the Gi Dynasty, and in the evening of  his days he travelled into the district of Dun.    143. And this King of the Gi Dynasty reverently offered unto him the  holy title of Shinran (Ran of Divinity) and the honourable name of  \"Rock of the Venerable Ran\"--that his dwelling-place should be  called by it.    144. Great and mighty upon the people was his spiritual power in the  temple of Genchu and in the fourth year of Kokwa of the Gi Dynasty  the Temple of Yosen became his beloved dwelling.    145. And when he had reached sixty-seven years, he sought his final  refuge in the Eternal Kingdom. And at that departing were vouchsafed  many holy marvels unto which all men, both of the priests and  people, came and did reverence.    146. And when Donran the Great High Priest had departed into the  Peace, the King of the Gi Dynasty by a royal order commanded there  should be built for him a holy monument in the lands of Dun.    147. What man could know the unsearchable mystery of the faith and  deeds of the Divine Promise were it not for that most excelling  commentary of Donran the wise Priest, which he wrote concerning the  teaching of Vasubandh that had lived aforetime.    148. He who believeth that the Sole Vehicle of the Divine Promise,  most perfect, most mighty, receiveth within itself the Greatest of  Sinners, and this because it is its chief will so to do, will  receive the depth of this essential teaching--namely, that before  the eyes of the Instructed, illusion and wisdom are in their Essence  One.    149. Among the Five Mysteries that are preached in this Sutra, the  mystery of the Divine Power of the Enlightened One is highest, and  this is the holy vow of our Blessed One, this and this only.    150. Unto us hath our Father given those two spiritual gifts. Of  these the first is the Virtue whereby we attain unto His Kingdom,  and the second is the Virtue whereby having so attained we return  into this world for the Salvation of men. By the merit of these two  gifts are we initiates of the true faith and of its deeds.    151. When we shall have attained unto the faith and the deeds of the  Merciful Promise through our Father that is in all things able to  give them unto us, birth and death are henceforward as Nirvana. And  this is called the Gift of Departure.    152. And when we shall have attained unto that height which is  desire for the ingathering of all beings into Paradise, shall we  return again into this world that we may be Saviours of Men. And  this is called the Gift of Returning.    153. That \"Single Mind\" expounded unto us by Vasubandh, the Master  of Writings that excel, is nothing other than the faith of us that  are now fast bound in illusion. So teacheth Donran the Great Teacher  in his Commentary.    154. The Buddha of that inexpressible Light that shineth into the  worlds of the Ten Regions, being for ever enlightened in the night  of ignorance, hath most certainly opened the way of Nirvana to every  man who even for one moment rejoiceth in receiving His Divine  Promise.    155. By the merit of His Infinite Light, when we attain unto that  faith divine and omnipotent, the ice of illusion shall melt into the  water of perfect wisdom.    156. Sin is made one with virtue in its essence, even as ice is one  with water. The more there is ice, so much the more water is  there. So also is the binding up of sin with virtue.    157. In the unbounded ocean of the Holy Name is not seen even one  single death of a blasphemer. For the myriad streams of sin are on  purity with the ocean of righteousness when they have flowed into  the impurity thereof.    158. When the streams of illusion have flowed into the Great Sea of  the Merciful Promise of the Enlightened One, whose light shineth  into all the worlds of the Ten Religions, then shall they too become  the pure water of the Perfect Wisdom.    159. No other way is there of attaining unto the Perfect  Enlightenment save only by birth into the Land of Gladness, and  therefore have all the Enlightened Ones exhorted men that they  should receive the Doctrine of the Kingdom Purity.    160. The Great Priest hath well taught us that in order to cleanse  our deeds, words, and thoughts of deceitfulness, our Father hath  performed the three of His pure and universal.    161. There is no way unto the Kingdom of Gladness save only by  attaining unto the true faith through that Holy Name, the very Jewel  of Wonder.    162. When the new birth through the clearness of the Divine Promise  is attained in the Eternal Kingdom, it is not like unto the birth of  this world; then is there no inferiority even in those that in this  world were sinners, for they have entered into Paradise.    163. The Holy Name of the Buddha of that Boundless Light that  shineth into all the worlds of the Ten Regions, and the glory of His  Wisdom, destroy the darkness of ignorance in the Eternal Night, thus  fulfilling all the desires of men.      CONCERNING UNRIGHTEOUS DEEDS    164. These three things are expounded unto us by Donran  Daishi. First, that faith is not holiness, for faith is not  abiding. At one time it abideth, at another it is gone.    165. And second: This faith is not Single Minded, for it hath not  resolution.    And third: It continueth not, for the other thoughts of the heart  divide it against itself.    166. The three ways of this faith lead the one to the other one. On  this must the believer fix his eyes. If his faith is not in  holiness, then hath he not the faith of resolution.    167. And having not the faith that is resolute, that faith cannot  endure, and because it endureth not, how can he attain unto the  faith of determination? And attaining not unto the faith of  determination, the faith is not sanctified in him.    168. For the attainment of Right Practice expounded by the Master of  the Written Word is according unto the true faith and this alone.    169. If a man return into the Great Way of the Divine Promise,  eschewing the narrow ways of deeds and works, in him shall the true"]]]
