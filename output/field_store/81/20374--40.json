[Footnote: How constantly the hand aids us in explaining  or enforcing a thought! We affirm a fact by placing the hand as if we  would rest it firmly on a body; we deny by a gesture putting the false or  erroneous proposition away from us; we express doubt by holding the hand  suspended, as if hesitating whether to take or reject. When we part from  dear friends, or greet them again after long absence, the hand extends  toward them as if to retain, or to bring them sooner to us. If a recital  or a proposition is revolting, we reject it energetically in gesture as in  thought. In a friendly adieu we wave our good wishes to him who is their  object; but when it expresses enmity, by a brusque movement we sever every  tie. The open hand is carried backward to express fear or horror, as well  as to avoid contact; it goes forward to meet the hand of friendship; it is  raised suppliantly in prayer toward Him from whom we hope for help; it  caresses lovingly the downy cheek of the infant, and rests on its head  invoking the blessing of Heaven,--_Wonders of the Human Body_.]    FIG. 13.    [Illustration: _The Mechanism of the Hip Joint._]    2. THE LOWER LIMBS.--THE HIP--The thigh bone, or _femur_, is the  largest and necessarily the strongest in the skeleton, since at every step  it has to bear the weight of the whole body. It articulates with the hip  bone by a ball-and-socket joint. Unlike the shoulder joint, the cup here  is deep, thus affording less play, but greater strength. It fits so  tightly that the pressure of the air largely aids in keeping the bones in  place. [Footnote: In order to test this, a hole was bored through a hip  bone, so as to admit air into the socket, the thigh bone at once fell out  as far as the ligaments would permit. An experiment was also devised  whereby a suitably prepared hip joint was placed under the receiver of an  air pump. On exhausting the air, the weight of the femur caused it to drop  out of the socket, while the readmission of the air raised it to its  place. Without this arrangement, the adjacent muscles would have been  compelled to bear the additional weight of the thighbone every time it was  raised. Now the pressure of the air rids them of this unnecessary burden,  and hence they are less easily fatigued--WEBER] Indeed, when the muscles  are cut away, great force is required to detach the limbs.    THE KNEE is strengthened by the patella_, or kneepan (_patella_,  little dish), a chestnut-shaped bone firmly fastened over the joint.    The shin bone, or _tibia_, the large, triangular bone on the inner  side of the leg, articulates both with the femur and the foot by hinge  joints. The kneejoint is so made, however, as to admit of a slight rotary  motion when the limb is not extended.    The _fibula_ (_fibula_, a clasp), the small, outside bone of the  leg, is firmly bound at each end to the tibia. (See Fig. 1.) It is  immovable, and, as the tibia bears the principal weight of the body, the  chief use of this second bone seems to be to give more surface to which  the muscles may be attached. [Footnote: A young man in the hospital at  Limoges had lost the middle part of his tibia. The lost bone was not  reproduced, but the fibula, the naturally weak and slender part of the  leg, became thick and strong enough to support the whole body.--STANLEY'S  _Lectures_.]    THE FOOT.--The general arrangement of the foot is strikingly like that of  the hand (Fig. 1). The several parts are the _tarsus_, the  _metatarsus_, and the _phalanges_. The graceful arch of the  foot, and the numerous bones joined by cartilages, give an elasticity to  the step that could never be attained by a single, flat bone. [Footnote:  The foot consists of an arch, the base of which is more extended in front  than behind, and the whole weight of the body is made to fall on this arch  by means of a variety of joints. These joints further enable the foot to  be applied, without inconvenience, to rough and uneven surfaces.--HINTON.]  The toes naturally lie straight forward in the line of the foot. Few  persons in civilized nations, however, have naturally formed feet. The big  toe is crowded upon the others, while crossed toes, nails grown-in,  enormous joints, corns, and bunions abound.    THE CAUSE OF THESE DEFORMITIES is found in the shape and size of  fashionable boots and shoes. The sole ought to be large enough for full  play of motion, the uppers should not crowd the toes, and the heels should  be low, flat, and broad. As it is, there is a constant warfare between  Nature and our shoemakers, [Footnote: When we are measured for boots or  shoes, we should stand on a sheet of paper, and have the shoemaker mark  with a pencil the exact outline of our feet as they bear our whole weight.  When the shoe is made, the sole should exactly cover this outline.] and we  are the victims. The narrow point in front pinches our toes, and compels  them to override one another; the narrow sole compresses the arch; while  the high heel, by throwing all the weight forward on the toes, strains the  ankle, and, by sending the pressure where Nature did not design it to  fall, causes that joint to become enlarged. The body bends forward to meet  the demand of this new motion, and thus loses its uprightness and beauty,  making our gait stiff and ungraceful. (See p. 271.)    DISEASES, ETC.--l. _Rickets_, a disease of early life, is caused by a  lack of mineral matter in the bones, rendering them soft and pliable, so  that they bend under the weight of the body. They thus become permanently  distorted, and of course are weaker than if they were straight, [Footnote:  Just here appears an exceedingly beautiful provision. As soon as the  disproportion of animal matter ceases, a larger supply of mineral is sent  to the weak points, and the bones actually become thicker, denser, harder,  and consequently stronger at the very concave part where the stress of  pressure is greatest.--WATSON'S _Lectures_. We shall often have  occasion to refer to similar wise and providential arrangements whereby  the body is enabled to remedy defects, and to prepare for accidents.]  Rickets is most common among children who have inherited a feeble  constitution and who are ill fed, or who live in damp, ill-ventilated  houses. \"Rickety\" children should have plenty of fresh air and sunlight,  nourishing food, comfortable clothing, and, in short, the best of hygienic  care.    2. _A Felon_ is a swelling of the finger or thumb, usually of the  last joint. It is marked by an accumulation beneath the periosteum and  next the bone. The physician will merely cut through the periosteum, and  let out the effete matter.    3. _Bowlegs_ are caused by children standing on their feet before the  bones of the lower limbs are strong enough to bear their weight. The  custom of encouraging young children to stand by means of a chair or the  support of the hand, while the bones are yet soft and pliable, is a cruel  one, and liable to produce permanent deformity. Nature will set the child  on its feet when the proper time comes.    4. _Curvature of the Spine_.--When the spine is bent, the packing  between the vertebræ becomes compressed on one side into a wedge-like  shape. After a time, it will lose its elasticity, and the spine will  become distorted. This often occurs in the case of students who bend  forward to bring their eyes nearer their books, instead of lifting their  books nearer their eyes, or who raise their right shoulder above their  left when writing at a desk which is too high. Round shoulders, small,  weak lungs, and, frequently, diseases of the spine are the consequences.  An erect posture in reading or writing conduces not alone to beauty of  form, but also to health of body. We shall learn hereafter that the action  of the muscles bears an important part in preserving the symmetry of the  spine. Muscular strength comes from bodily activity; hence, one of the  best preventives of spinal curvature is daily exercise in the open air.    5. _Sprains_ are produced when the ligaments which bind the bones of  a joint are strained, twisted, or torn from their attachments. They are  quite as serious as a broken bone, and require careful attention lest they  lead to a crippling for life. By premature use a sprained limb may be  permanently impaired. Hence, the joint should be kept quiet, even after  the immediate pain is gone.    6. _A Dislocation_ is the forcible displacement of a bone from its  socket. It is, generally, the result of a fall or a violent blow. The  tissues of the joint are often ruptured, while the contraction of the  muscles prevents the easy return of the bone to its place. A dislocation  should be reduced as soon as possible after the injury, before  inflammation supervenes.    PRACTICAL QUESTIONS.    1.

[5]    I spent eight years in the Filipinas Islands, the best years of  my life, serving continuously as lieutenant of the governor and  captain-general, and, as soon as the royal Audiencia of Manila was  established, in the office of auditor, which I was the first to  fill. [6] And desirous that the affairs of those islands should be  known, especially those which occurred during my connection with  them, I have related these matters in a book of eight chapters,  tracing them from their origin so far as was necessary. The first  seven chapters contain an account of the discoveries, conquests, and  other events in the islands and neighboring kingdoms and provinces,  which occurred during the time of the proprietary governors [7]  until the death of Don Pedro de Acuña. The eighth and last chapter  contains a brief summary and account of the nature of these regions,  their inhabitants, the manner of governing and converting them, and  other details; moreover, it treats of the acquaintance, dealings,  and intercourse which they maintain with their neighboring islands and  pagan communities. As fearful am I for the imperfections which will be  found in this work, as I am persuaded that they deserve forgiveness,  since my design and chief intent has been to give each one his due and  to present the truth without hatred or flattery, which has been injured  in some current narratives. [8] The latter is a fault to be severely  reproved in those who relate the deeds of others, inasmuch as it was  prohibited by a penal law which Cato and Marcius, tribunes of the  Roman people, established for those who, in relating their own deeds,  overstepped the truth--although this seemed less worthy of punishment,  on account of the self-love which intervenes in such a case.    There will not be wanting some person who will point out my oversights,  but I shall have already answered him by confessing them; and should  this not suffice to silence him, I shall stop up my ears like another  Ulysses, and--considering the haste with which I have written--endure  this inconvenience and difficulty, desiring only to please and serve  whomsoever may read it; and this will be sufficient to protect me  from greater dangers.    Notice is given that    In reading this history, one may find certain words--names of  provinces, towns, magistrates, arms, and vessels--which it has seemed  more suitable to write by their usual names in those regions. In  the last chapter, which contains an account of the islands and their  peculiarities, these words will be explained and defined.        ¶ Of the first discoveries of the eastern islands; the voyage thither  by Adelantado Miguel Lopez de Legazpi; the conquest and pacification of  the Filipinas during his governorship, and that of Guido de Labazarris,  who afterward held the office.    ¶ CHAPTER FIRST    According to ancient and modern cosmographers, that part of the world  called Asia has adjacent to it a multitude of greater and lesser  islands, inhabited by various nations and peoples, and as rich in  precious stones, gold, silver, and other minerals, as they abound in  fruit and grain, flocks, and animals. Some of the islands yield all  kinds of spices which are carried away and distributed throughout  the world. These islands are commonly designated in their books,  descriptions, and sea-charts, as the great archipelago of San Lazaro,  and are located in the eastern ocean. Among the most famous of them  are the islands of Maluco, Céleves, Tendaya, Luzon, Mindanao, and  Borneo, which are now called the Filipinas.    When Pope Alexander the Sixth divided the conquests of the new world  between the kings of Castilla and of Portugal, the kings agreed to  make the division by means of a line drawn across the world by the  cosmographers, so that they might continue their discoveries and  conquests, one toward the west and the other toward the east, and  pacify whatever regions each might gain within his own demarcation.    After the crown of Portugal had conquered the city of Malaca, on  the mainland of Asia, in the kingdom of Jor [Johore]--called by  the ancients Aurea Chersonesus--a Portuguese fleet, in the year one  thousand five hundred and eleven, on hearing of neighboring islands  and especially of those of Maluco and Banda, where cloves and nutmegs  are gathered, went to discover them. After touching at Banda, they  went to Terrenate, one of the islands of Maluco, at the invitation  of its king, to defend him against his neighbor, the king of Tidore,  with whom he was at war. This was the beginning of the Portuguese  settlement in Maluco.    Francisco Serrano, who after this discovery returned to Malaca, and  thence went to India with the purpose of going to Portugal to give  an account of the discovery, died before he had accomplished this  voyage, but not, however, without having communicated in letters to  his friend, Fernando de Magallanes, what he had seen; [9] for they  had been together at the taking of Malaca, although the latter was  then in Portugal. From this relation, Magallanes learned whatever  was necessary for the discovery and navigation of these islands. [10]    At this time, Magallanes, who for certain reasons had entered the  service of the king of Castilla, told the emperor Cárlos V, our  sovereign, that the islands of Maluco fell within the demarcation of  the latter's crown of Castilla, and that their conquest belonged to  him, according to the concessions made by Pope Alexander; moreover,  he offered to make the expedition and navigation to the islands in  the emperor's name, by sailing through that part of the demarcation  belonging to Castilla, and by availing himself of a famous astrologer  and cosmographer, named Ruyfarelo [sic], whom he had with him.    The emperor, moved by the importance of the undertaking, entrusted  Fernando de Magallanes with this expedition and discovery, supplying  him with the necessary ships and provisions therefor. Thus equipped, he  set sail and discovered the strait to which he gave his name. Through  this he entered the southern sea, and sailed to the islands of Tendaya  and Sebu, where he was killed by the natives of Matan, which is one of  these islands. His ships proceeded to Maluco, where the sailors fell  into disputes and contentions with the Portuguese then stationed in the  island of Terrenate. Finally, not being able to maintain themselves  there, the Castilians left Maluco in a ship, called the \"Victoria,\"  the only remaining vessel of their fleet. As leader and captain,  they chose Juan Sebastian del Caño, who made the voyage to Castilla  by way of India, where he arrived with but few men, and informed his  Majesty of the discovery of the great archipelago, and of his voyage.    The same enterprise was attempted at other times, and was carried  out by Juan Sebastian del Caño, Comendador Loaisa, the Saoneses,  and the bishop of Plasencia. [11] But these did not bear the fruits  expected, on account of the hardships and perils of so long a voyage,  and the opposition received by those who reached Maluco, from the  Portuguese there.    After all these events, as it was thought that this discovery might  be made quicker and better by way of Nueva España, in the year one  thousand five hundred and forty-five, [12] a fleet, under command of  Rui Lopez de Villalobos, was sent by that route. They reached Maluco  by way of Sebu, where they quarreled with the Portuguese, and suffered  misfortunes and hardships, so that they were unable to effect the  desired end; nor could the fleet return to Nueva España whence it  had sailed, but was destroyed. Some of the surviving Castilians left  Maluco by way of Portuguese India and returned to Castilla. There they  related the occurrences of their voyage, and the quality and nature  of the islands of Maluco and of the other islands that they had seen.    Afterward as King Don Felipe II, our sovereign, considered it  inadvisable for him to desist from that same enterprise, and being  informed by Don Luys de Velasco, viceroy of Nueva España, and by Fray  Andres de Urdaneta of the Augustinian order--who had been in Maluco  with the fleet of Comendador Loaisa, while a layman--that this voyage  might be made better and quicker by way of Nueva Españia, he entrusted  the expedition to the viceroy. Fray Andres de Urdaneta left the court  for Nueva Españia, [13] for, as he was so experienced and excellent  a cosmographer, he offered to go with the fleet and to discover the  return voyage. The viceroy equipped a fleet and its crew with the  most necessary things in Puerto de la Navidad, in the southern sea,  under charge of a worthy and reliable man, Miguel Lopez de Legazpi,  a citizen of Mexico and a native of the province of Guipuzcoa. On  account of the viceroy's death, the Audiencia which was governing in  his place completed arrangements for the despatching of Legazpi, and  gave him instructions as to his destination, with orders not to open  them until three hundred leguas at sea; for there were differences  among members of the fleet, some saying that they would better go  to Nueva Guinea, others to the Luzones, and others to Maluco. Miguel  Lopez de Legazpi left Puerto de la Navidad in the year one thousand  five hundred and sixty-four, with five ships and five hundred men,  accompanied by Fray Andres de Urdaneta and four other religious of  the Order of St. Augustine. After sailing westward for several days,  he opened his instructions, and found that he was ordered to go to  the islands of Luzones and there endeavor to pacify them and reduce  them to the obedience of his Majesty, and to make them accept the  holy Catholic faith. [14] He continued his voyage until reaching the  island of Sebu, where he anchored, induced by the convenience of a  good port and by the nature of the land. At first he was received  peacefully by the natives and by their chief"]]]
