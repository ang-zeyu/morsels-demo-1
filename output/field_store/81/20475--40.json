This did not prevent him from undertaking the difficult task of  haranguing the mob; but the mob preferred forcing the guard of  the States--which, however, offered no resistance to the sovereign  people--to listening to the speech of Mynheer d'Asperen.    \"Now, then,\" the young man coolly remarked, whilst the crowd was rushing  into the principal gate of the Town-hall, \"it seems the question will be  discussed indoors, Captain. Come along, and let us hear the debate.\"    \"Oh, Monseigneur! Monseigneur! take care!\"    \"Of what?\"    \"Among these deputies there are many who have had dealings with you,  and it would be sufficient, that one of them should recognize your  Highness.\"    \"Yes, that I might be charged with having been the instigator of all  this work, indeed, you are right,\" said the young man, blushing for  a moment from regret of having betrayed so much eagerness. \"From  this place we shall see them return with or without the order for the  withdrawal of the dragoons, then we may judge which is greater, Mynheer  Bowelt's honesty or his courage.\"    \"But,\" replied the officer, looking with astonishment at the personage  whom he addressed as Monseigneur, \"but your Highness surely does not  suppose for one instant that the deputies will order Tilly's horse to  quit their post?\"    \"Why not?\" the young man quietly retorted.    \"Because doing so would simply be signing the death warrant of Cornelius  and John de Witt.\"    \"We shall see,\" his Highness replied, with the most perfect coolness;  \"God alone knows what is going on within the hearts of men.\"    The officer looked askance at the impassible figure of his companion,  and grew pale: he was an honest man as well as a brave one.    From the spot where they stood, his Highness and his attendant heard  the tumult and the heavy tramp of the crowd on the staircase of the  Town-hall. The noise thereupon sounded through the windows of the hall,  on the balcony of which Mynheers Bowelt and D'Asperen had presented  themselves. These two gentlemen had retired into the building, very  likely from fear of being forced over the balustrade by the pressure of  the crowd.    After this, fluctuating shadows in tumultuous confusion were seen  flitting to and fro across the windows: the council hall was filling.    Suddenly the noise subsided, and as suddenly again it rose with  redoubled intensity, and at last reached such a pitch that the old  building shook to the very roof.    At length, the living stream poured back through the galleries and  stairs to the arched gateway, from which it was seen issuing like waters  from a spout.    At the head of the first group, man was flying rather than running, his  face hideously distorted with satanic glee: this man was the surgeon  Tyckelaer.    \"We have it! we have it!\" he cried, brandishing a paper in the air.    \"They have got the order!\" muttered the officer in amazement.    \"Well, then,\" his Highness quietly remarked, \"now I know what to believe  with regard to Mynheer Bowelt's honesty and courage: he has neither the  one nor the other.\"    Then, looking with a steady glance after the crowd which was rushing  along before him, he continued,--    \"Let us now go to the Buytenhof, Captain; I expect we shall see a very  strange sight there.\"    The officer bowed, and, without making any reply, followed in the steps  of his master.    There was an immense crowd in the square and about the neighbourhood of  the prison. But the dragoons of Tilly still kept it in check with the  same success and with the same firmness.    It was not long before the Count heard the increasing din of the  approaching multitude, the first ranks of which rushed on with the  rapidity of a cataract.    At the same time he observed the paper, which was waving above the  surface of clenched fists and glittering arms.    \"Halloa!\" he said, rising in his stirrups, and touching his lieutenant  with the knob of his sword; \"I really believe those rascals have got the  order.\"    \"Dastardly ruffians they are,\" cried the lieutenant.    It was indeed the order, which the burgher guard received with a roar  of triumph. They immediately sallied forth, with lowered arms and fierce  shouts, to meet Count Tilly's dragoons.    But the Count was not the man to allow them to approach within an  inconvenient distance.    \"Stop!\" he cried, \"stop, and keep off from my horse, or I shall give the  word of command to advance.\"    \"Here is the order!\" a hundred insolent voices answered at once.    He took it in amazement, cast a rapid glance on it, and said quite  aloud,--    \"Those who have signed this order are the real murderers of Cornelius  de Witt. I would rather have my two hands cut off than have written one  single letter of this infamous order.\"    And, pushing back with the hilt of his sword the man who wanted to take  it from him, he added,--    \"Wait a minute, papers like this are of importance, and are to be kept.\"    Saying this, he folded up the document, and carefully put it in the  pocket of his coat.    Then, turning round towards his troop, he gave the word of command,--    \"Tilly's dragoons, wheel to the right!\"    After this, he added, in an undertone, yet loud enough for his words to  be not altogether lost to those about him,--    \"And now, ye butchers, do your work!\"    A savage yell, in which all the keen hatred and ferocious triumph  rife in the precincts of the prison simultaneously burst forth, and  accompanied the departure of the dragoons, as they were quietly filing  off.    The Count tarried behind, facing to the last the infuriated populace,  which advanced at the same rate as the Count retired.    John de Witt, therefore, had by no means exaggerated the danger,  when, assisting his brother in getting up, he hurried his departure.  Cornelius, leaning on the arm of the Ex-Grand Pensionary, descended the  stairs which led to the courtyard. At the bottom of the staircase he  found little Rosa, trembling all over.    \"Oh, Mynheer John,\" she said, \"what a misfortune!\"    \"What is it, my child?\" asked De Witt.    \"They say that they are gone to the Town-hall to fetch the order for  Tilly's horse to withdraw.\"    \"You do not say so!\" replied John. \"Indeed, my dear child, if the  dragoons are off, we shall be in a very sad plight.\"    \"I have some advice to give you,\" Rosa said, trembling even more  violently than before.    \"Well, let us hear what you have to say, my child. Why should not God  speak by your mouth?\"    \"Now, then, Mynheer John, if I were in your place, I should not go out  through the main street.\"    \"And why so, as the dragoons of Tilly are still at their post?\"    \"Yes, but their order, as long as it is not revoked, enjoins them to  stop before the prison.\"    \"Undoubtedly.\"    \"Have you got an order for them to accompany you out of the town?\"    \"We have not?\"    \"Well, then, in the very moment when you have passed the ranks of the  dragoons you will fall into the hands of the people.\"    \"But the burgher guard?\"    \"Alas! the burgher guard are the most enraged of all.\"    \"What are we to do, then?\"    \"If I were in your place, Mynheer John,\" the young girl timidly  continued, \"I should leave by the postern, which leads into a deserted  by-lane, whilst all the people are waiting in the High Street to see you  come out by the principal entrance. From there I should try to reach the  gate by which you intend to leave the town.\"    \"But my brother is not able to walk,\" said John.    \"I shall try,\" Cornelius said, with an expression of most sublime  fortitude.    \"But have you not got your carriage?\" asked the girl.    \"The carriage is down near the great entrance.\"    \"Not so,\" she replied. \"I considered your coachman to be a faithful man,  and I told him to wait for you at the postern.\"    The two brothers looked first at each other, and then at Rosa, with a  glance full of the most tender gratitude.    \"The question is now,\" said the Grand Pensionary, \"whether Gryphus will  open this door for us.\"    \"Indeed, he will do no such thing,\" said Rosa.    \"Well, and how then?\"    \"I have foreseen his refusal, and just now whilst he was talking from  the window of the porter's lodge with a dragoon, I took away the key  from his bunch.\"    \"And you have got it?\"    \"Here it is, Mynheer John.\"    \"My child,\" said Cornelius, \"I have nothing to give you in exchange for  the service you are rendering us but the Bible which you will find in  my room; it is the last gift of an honest man; I hope it will bring you  good luck.\"    \"I thank you, Master Cornelius, it shall never leave me,\" replied Rosa.    And then, with a sigh, she said to herself, \"What a pity that I do not  know how to read!\"    \"The shouts and cries are growing louder and louder,\" said John; \"there  is not a moment to be lost.\"    \"Come along, gentlemen,\" said the girl, who now led the two brothers  through an inner lobby to the back of the prison. Guided by her,  they descended a staircase of about a dozen steps; traversed a small  courtyard, which was surrounded by castellated walls; and, the arched  door having been opened for them by Rosa, they emerged into a lonely  street where their carriage was ready to receive them.    \"Quick, quick, my masters! do you hear them?\" cried the coachman, in a  deadly fright.    Yet, after having made Cornelius get into the carriage first, the Grand  Pensionary turned round towards the girl, to whom he said,--    \"Good-bye, my child! words could never express our gratitude. God will  reward you for having saved the lives of two men.\"    Rosa took the hand which John de Witt proffered to her, and kissed it  with every show of respect.    \"Go! for Heaven's sake, go!\" she said; \"it seems they are going to force  the gate.\"    John de Witt hastily got in, sat himself down by the side of his  brother, and, fastening the apron of the carriage, called out to the  coachman,--    \"To the Tol-Hek!\"    The Tol-Hek was the iron gate"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9650"],[0,"Independent Bohemia (#5)"],[1," not only for the European Powers, but also for the      non-German nations of Europe. _And if, therefore, a conflict should      break out between the German and the non-German world and the definite      fate of Austria should be at stake, the conflict would surely not end      with the preservation of Austria_.\"    And on November 10, 1911, he admitted that his former hopes for the  destruction of the Austro-German Alliance and a rapprochement between  Austria and Russia proved to be in vain:        \"... _I had an aim in life and a leading idea. The events of the      annexation crisis have proved calamitous for the policy which I      followed all my life_. I wished to do everything which lay within the      compass of my small powers, to render my own nation happy and great in      a free, powerful and generally respected Austria ... _I have always      resented the fact that when they talked about Austria people really      meant only the Germans and Magyars, as if the great majority of Slavs      upon whom rest the biggest burdens did not exist_. But now--and no      beautiful words can make me change my opinion on that point--an      entirely independent policy has become unthinkable, because the only      path which remains open to Vienna leads by way of Berlin. Berlin will      henceforward direct our policy.\"    4. To offer any proofs that the present war was deliberately planned and  provoked by the Governments of Berlin, Vienna and Budapest seems to me  superfluous. Who can to-day have any doubt that Austria wilfully provoked  the war in a mad desire to crush Serbia? Who can doubt that Austria for a  long time entertained imperialist ambitions with respect to the Balkans  which were supported by Berlin which wished to use Austria as a \"bridge to  the East\"?    No more damning document for Austria can be imagined than Prince  Lichnowsky's Memorandum. He denounces Austria's hypocritical support of the  independence of Albania. In this respect he holds similar views to those  expressed in the Austrian delegations of 1913 by Professor Masaryk, who  rightly denounced the Austrian plan of setting up an independent Albania on  the plea of \"the right of nationalities\" which Austria denied her own  Slavs. Professor Masaryk rightly pointed out at that time that an outlet to  the sea is a vital necessity for Serbia, that the Albanians were divided  into so many racial, linguistic and religious groups and so uncivilised  that they could not form an independent nation, and that the whole project  was part and parcel of Austria's anti-Serbian policy and her plans for the  conquest of the Balkans. Prince Lichnowsky admits that an independent  Albania \"had no prospect of surviving,\" and that it was merely an Austrian  plan for preventing Serbia from obtaining an access to the sea.    He apparently disagrees with the idea of \"the power of a Ruling House, the  dynastic idea,\" but stands up for \"a National State, the democratic idea.\"  That in itself seems to indicate that he is in favour of the destruction of  Austria and its substitution by new states, built according to the  principle of nationality. He admittedly disagrees with the views of Vienna  and Budapest, and criticises Germany's alliance with Austria, probably  knowing, as a far-sighted and well-informed politician, that  Austria-Hungary cannot possibly survive this war.    Prince Lichnowsky frankly admits that the murder of the Archduke Francis  Ferdinand was a mere pretext for Vienna, which in fact had resolved on an  expedition against Serbia soon after the second Balkan war by which she  felt herself humiliated. In scathing terms he denounces the Triple Alliance  policy and thinks it a great mistake that Germany allied herself with the  \"Turkish and Magyar oppressors.\" And though he says that it was Germany  which \"persisted that Serbia must be massacred,\" he makes it quite clear  that it was Vienna that led the conspiracy against Europe, since on all  questions Germany \"took up the position prescribed to her by Vienna.\" The  policy of espousing Austria's quarrels, the development of the  Austro-German Alliance into a pooling of interests in all spheres, was \"the  best way of producing war.\" The Balkan policy of conquest and strangulation  \"was not the German policy, but that of the Austrian Imperial House.\" What  better testimony is required to prove that Austria was not the blind tool,  but the willing and wilful accomplice of Germany?        III    CZECH POLITICAL PARTIES BEFORE AND DURING THE WAR    The Czech policy during the past seventy years has always had but one  ultimate aim in view: the re-establishment of the ancient kingdom of  Bohemia and the full independence of the Czecho-Slovak nation. From the  very beginning of their political activity Czech politicians resisted the  Pan-German scheme of Central Europe. They preached the necessity of the  realisation of liberty and equality for all nations, and of a federation of  the non-Germans of Central Europe as a barrier against German expansion.    The chief reason for the failure of their efforts was the fact that they  sometimes had illusions that the Habsburgs might favour the plan of such an  anti-German federation, although the Habsburgs always mainly relied on the  Germans and Magyars and could not and would not satisfy the Czech  aspirations. The Czechs were greatly handicapped in their political  struggle, because they had only just begun to live as a nation and had to  face the powerful German-Magyar predominance, with the dynasty and the  whole state machinery behind them. Moreover, the Czechs had no national  aristocracy like the Poles or Magyars, and their leaders lacked all  political experience and all sense of reality in politics which was so  marked in a state built on deceit and hypocrisy. They continually defended  themselves with declarations about the justice of their claims, satisfied  themselves with empty promises which Austria has never kept, and cherished  vain illusions of obtaining justice in Austria, while Austria was _via  facti_ steadily depriving them of all their rights. On the other hand, it  should be remembered that they were faced with a government that had the  whole powerful German Empire behind it, and that they had to struggle for  freedom in a state where genuine constitutional government and democracy  were unknown. The Czech efforts to obtain some measure of freedom by  struggling for democratic reforms were consistently opposed by the dominant  Germans. To-day, of course, the situation has greatly improved as compared  with the situation seventy years ago. The Czecho-Slovak nation, through its  own work and energy, is a highly advanced and economically self-supporting  and rich nation, and in its struggle for a just resettlement of Central  Europe it has the support not only of all the other non-German nations of  Central Europe, but also of the Entente on whose victory it has staked its  all. The Czecho-Slovaks are resolved not to let themselves be fooled by  Austria any longer and claim full independence from Berlin, Vienna and  Budapest, which alone will safeguard them against the possibility of being  again exploited militarily, economically and politically against their own  interests for a cause which they detest.    1. Although as early as 1812 the Bohemian Diet (then a close aristocratic  body) demanded the restitution of the rights of the kingdom of Bohemia, the  political activity of the Czechs did not really begin until 1848 when, on  April 8, the emperor issued the famous Bohemian Charter recognising the  rights of Bohemia to independence. It was that year which marked the end of  Metternich's absolutism and in which revolution broke out in Western and  Central Europe, including Hungary and Bohemia. Already at that time the  Czechs counted on the break-up of Austria. Havlicek, who in 1846 began to  publish the first national Czech newspaper, wrote on May 7, 1848, when  inviting the Poles to attend the Pan-Slav Congress in Prague:        \"An understanding between us--the Czecho-Slovaks and the Poles--would      be to the mutual advantage of both nations, especially under the      present circumstances when everything, even the break-up of Austria,      may be anticipated. I am sure that if the government continues to      pursue its present policy, Austria will fall to pieces before next      winter and the Czechs are not going to save her. The Czecho-Slovaks,      Poles and Yugoslavs, united politically and supporting each other, will      surely sooner or later attain their object, which is to obtain full      independence, national unity and political liberty.\"    It is characteristic of Austria that during the present war she has  prohibited the circulation of this article written seventy years ago.    Similarly, also, Palacky in his letter to Frankfurt, explaining why the  Czechs would not attend the Pan-German Parliament, made it clear that he  had no illusions about the good-will of Austria to adopt a just policy  towards her nationalities:        \"In critical times we always saw this state, destined to be the bulwark      against Asiatic invasions, helpless and hesitating. In an unfortunate      blindness this state has never understood its true interests, always      suppressing its moral duty to accord to all races justice and equality      of rights.\"    At the Pan-Slav Congress presided over by Palacky, Bakunin, the Russian  revolutionary, openly advocated the dismemberment of Austria in the  interests of justice and democracy, and proposed a free Slav federation in  Central Europe.    The Pan-Slav Congress, in which also the Poles and Yugoslavs participated,  issued a manifesto to Europe on June 12, 1848, proclaiming the \"liberty,  equality and fraternity of nations.\" It ended prematurely by the outbreak  of an abortive revolt in Prague, provoked by the military, which resulted  in bloodshed and in the re-establishment of "]]]
