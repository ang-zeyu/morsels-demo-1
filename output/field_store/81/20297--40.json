Should he, the proudest, most  magnificent of cardinals, be compelled to go seeking a mate like any  common bird?  Perish the thought!    He went to the river to bathe.  After finding a spot where the water  flowed crystal-clear over a bed of white limestone, he washed until he  felt that he could be no cleaner.  Then the Cardinal went to his  favourite sun-parlour, and stretching on a limb, he stood his feathers  on end, and sunned, fluffed and prinked until he was immaculate.    On the tip-top antler of the old stag sumac, he perched and strained  until his jetty whiskers appeared stubby.  He poured out a tumultuous  cry vibrant with every passion raging in him.  He caught up his own  rolling echoes and changed and varied them.  He improvised, and set the  shining river ringing, \"Wet year! Wet year!\"    He whistled and whistled until all birdland and even mankind heard, for  the farmer paused at his kitchen door, with his pails of foaming milk,  and called to his wife:    \"Hear that, Maria! Jest hear it! I swanny, if that bird doesn't stop  predictin' wet weather, I'll get so scared I won't durst put in my corn  afore June.  They's some birds like killdeers an' bobwhites 'at can  make things pretty plain, but I never heard a bird 'at could jest speak  words out clear an' distinct like that fellow.  Seems to come from the  river bottom.  B'lieve I'll jest step down that way an' see if the  lower field is ready for the plow yet.\"    \"Abram Johnson,\" said his wife, \"bein's you set up for an honest man,  if you want to trapse through slush an' drizzle a half-mile to see a  bird, why say so, but don't for land's sake lay it on to plowin' 'at  you know in all conscience won't be ready for a week yet 'thout  pretendin' to look.\"    Abram grinned sheepishly.  \"I'm willin' to call it the bird if you are,  Maria.  I've been hearin' him from the barn all day, an' there's  somethin' kind o' human in his notes 'at takes me jest a little  diffrunt from any other bird I ever noticed.  I'm really curious to set  eyes on him.  Seemed to me from his singin' out to the barn, it 'ud be  mighty near like meetin' folks.\"    \"Bosh!\" exclaimed Maria.  \"I don't s'pose he sings a mite better 'an  any other bird.  It's jest the old Wabash rollin' up the echoes.  A  bird singin' beside the river always sounds twicet as fine as one on  the hills.  I've knowed that for forty year.  Chances are 'at he'll be  gone 'fore you get there.\"    As Abram opened the door, \"Wet year! Wet year!\" pealed the flaming  prophet.    He went out, closing the door softly, and with an utter disregard for  the corn field, made a bee line for the musician.    \"I don't know as this is the best for twinges o' rheumatiz,\" he  muttered, as he turned up his collar and drew his old hat lower to keep  the splashing drops from his face.  \"I don't jest rightly s'pose I  should go; but I'm free to admit I'd as lief be dead as not to answer  when I get a call, an' the fact is, I'm CALLED down beside the river.\"    \"Wet year! Wet year!\" rolled the Cardinal's prediction.    \"Thanky, old fellow!  Glad to hear you!  Didn't jest need the  information, but I got my bearin's rightly from it! I can about pick  out your bush, an' it's well along towards evenin', too, an' must be  mighty near your bedtime.  Looks as if you might be stayin' round these  parts!  I'd like it powerful well if you'd settle right here, say 'bout  where you are.  An' where are you, anyway?\"    Abram went peering and dodging beside the fence, peeping into the  bushes, searching for the bird.  Suddenly there was a whir of wings and  a streak of crimson.    \"Scared you into the next county, I s'pose,\" he muttered.    But it came nearer being a scared man than a frightened bird, for the  Cardinal flashed straight toward him until only a few yards away, and  then, swaying on a bush, it chipped, cheered, peeked, whistled broken  notes, and manifested perfect delight at the sight of the white-haired  old man.  Abram stared in astonishment.    \"Lord A'mighty!\" he gasped.  \"Big as a blackbird, red as a live coal,  an' a-comin' right at me.  You are somebody's pet, that's what you are!  An' no, you ain't either.  Settin' on a sawed stick in a little wire  house takes all the ginger out of any bird, an' their feathers are  always mussy.  Inside o' a cage never saw you, for they ain't a feather  out o' place on you.  You are finer'n a piece o' red satin.  An' you  got that way o' swingin' an' dancin' an' high-steppin' right out in God  A'mighty's big woods, a teeterin' in the wind, an' a dartin' 'crost the  water.  Cage never touched you! But you are somebody's pet jest the  same.  An' I look like the man, an' you are tryin' to tell me so, by  gum!\"    Leaning toward Abram, the Cardinal turned his head from side to side,  and peered, \"chipped,\" and waited for an answering \"Chip\" from a little  golden-haired child, but there was no way for the man to know that.    \"It's jest as sure as fate,\" he said.  \"You think you know me, an' you  are tryin' to tell me somethin'.  Wish to land I knowed what you want!  Are you tryin' to tell me `Howdy'?  Well, I don't 'low nobody to be  politer 'an I am, so far as I know.\"    Abram lifted his old hat, and the raindrops glistened on his white  hair.  He squared his shoulders and stood very erect.    \"Howdy, Mr.  Redbird!  How d'ye find yerself this evenin'?  I don't  jest riccolict ever seein' you before, but I'll never meet you agin  'thout knowin' you.  When d'you arrive?  Come through by the special  midnight flyer, did you? Well, you never was more welcome any place in  your life.  I'd give a right smart sum this minnit if you'd say you  came to settle on this river bank.  How do you like it?  To my mind  it's jest as near Paradise as you'll strike on earth.    \"Old Wabash is a twister for curvin' and windin' round, an' it's  limestone bed half the way, an' the water's as pretty an' clear as in  Maria's springhouse.  An' as for trimmin', why say, Mr. Redbird, I'll  jest leave it to you if she ain't all trimmed up like a woman's spring  bunnit.  Look at the grass a-creepin' right down till it's a trailin'  in the water!  Did you ever see jest quite such fine fringy willers?  An' you wait a little, an' the flowerin' mallows 'at grows long the  shinin' old river are fine as garden hollyhocks.  Maria says 'at thy'd  be purtier 'an hers if they were only double; but, Lord, Mr.  Redbird,  they are!  See 'em once on the bank, an' agin in the water!  An' back a  little an' there's jest thickets of papaw, an' thorns, an' wild  grape-vines, an' crab, an' red an' black haw, an' dogwood, an' sumac,  an' spicebush, an' trees! Lord! Mr. Redbird, the sycamores, an' maples,  an' tulip, an' ash, an' elm trees are so bustin' fine 'long the old  Wabash they put 'em into poetry books an' sing songs about 'em.  What  do you think o' that? Jest back o' you a little there's a sycamore  split into five trunks, any one o' them a famous big tree, tops up  'mong the clouds, an' roots diggin' under the old river; an' over a  little farther's a maple 'at's eight big trees in one.  Most anything  you can name, you can find it 'long this ole Wabash, if you only know  where to hunt for it.    \"They's mighty few white men takes the trouble to look, but the Indians  used to know.  They'd come canoein' an' fishin' down the river an' camp  under these very trees, an' Ma 'ud git so mad at the old squaws.  Settlers wasn't so thick then, an' you had to be mighty careful not to  rile 'em, an' they'd come a-trapesin' with their wild berries.  Woods  full o' berries!  Anybody could get 'em by the bushel for the pickin',  an' we hadn't got on to raisin' much wheat, an' had to carry it on  horses over into Ohio to get it milled.  Took Pa five days to make the  trip; an' then the blame old squaws 'ud come, an' Ma 'ud be compelled  to hand over to 'em her big white loaves.  Jest about set her plumb  crazy.  Used to get up in the night, an' fix her yeast, an' bake, an'  let the oven cool, an' hide the bread out in the wheat bin, an' get the  smell of it all out o' the house by good daylight, so's 'at she could  say there wasn't a loaf in the cabin.  Oh!  if it's good pickin' you're  after, they's berries for all creation 'long the river yet; an' jest  wait a few days till old April gets done showerin' an' I plow this corn  field!\"    Abram set a foot on the third rail and leaned his elbows on the top.  The Cardinal chipped delightedly and hopped and tilted closer.    \"I hadn't jest 'lowed all winter I'd tackle this field again.  I've  turned it every spring for forty year.  Bought it when I was a young  fellow, jest married to Maria.  Shouldered a big debt on it; but I  always loved these slopin' fields, an' my share of this old Wabash  hasn't been for sale nor tradin' any time this past forty year.  I've  hung on to it like grim death, for it's jest that much o' Paradise I'm  plumb sure of.  First time I plowed this field, Mr. Redbird, I only hit  the high places.  Jest married Maria, an' I didn't touch earth any too  frequent all that summer. I've plowed it every year since, an' I've  been 'lowin' all this winter, when the rheumatiz was gettin' in its  work, 'at I'd give it up this spring an' turn it to medder; but I don't  know.  Once I got started, b'lieve I could go it all right an' not feel  it so much, if you'd stay to cheer me up a little an' post me on the  weather.  Hate the doggondest to own I'm worsted, an' if you say it's  stay, b'lieve I'll try it.  Very sight o' you kinder warms the cockles  o' my heart all up, an' every skip you take sets me a-wantin' to be  jumpin', too.    \"What on earth are you lookin' for?  Man!  I b'lieve it's grub!  Somebody's been feedin' you!  An' you want me to keep it up?  Well, you  struck it all right, Mr. Redbird.  Feed you?  You bet I will!  You  needn't even 'rastle for grubs if you don't want to.

Vol. 2 (of 3) (#5)"],[1," extravagant style, _Caro  Maestro_,\" she said, to Winter, as they were enjoying an April day,  which seemed to have borrowed the balmy air of early summer. They had  crossed the ferry, and were strolling side by side, her tall, graceful  form, and elastic step, contrasting strongly with his stout puffy  figure.    \"You had better tie a knapsack on your shoulder at once, and trudge  it--humph! ha! not so fast if you please--you walked me up that hill at  a killing pace.    \"But seriously--let us consider the best method of setting to work, for  you cannot think how eagerly I look forward to the journey; and if we  go cheaply to work, Mr. Gilpin might join us, and--\"    \"_Signorina Carrissima_, yes! I want to speak seriously,\" replied  Winter, in a kinder accents than usual. \"Are you not too sanguine  about this journey, You make too little of the law's uncertainties.  Mr. Moore's letters seem to promise well, as you read them. Your  grandfather and I see only, and at best, the promise of a long, perhaps  ruinous litigation. I felt so convinced that this will be the case,  that, from the first, I strongly advised Colonel Vernon to endeavour  to effect a compromise. It is true you have not much to divide, but  remember _chi lascia il poco per haver l'assai nè l'uno nè l'altro  avera mai_,\". I see I am acting as usual like a brute,\" he continued,  thickly. \"I intended to say all this by degrees, and tenderly--but I  plunged into it at last too abruptly. My dear child, it cuts me to the  heart, to hear you anticipating such unalloyed enjoyment, and forming  such plans, when perhaps the reverse is before you; and I fancy your  grandfather feels somewhat as I do, though he is more sanguine than I  am.\"    They walked on a few paces, in silence--Kate's color varying, and her  heart, after feeling, for a second or two, to stand still (at this  sudden and rude shock, to her bright dreams), throbbing as though it  would burst its prison.    \"_Bella mia_, dear child, are you angry with me?\" cried Winter  anxiously. \"Why do you not speak?\"    \"Simply, kind friend,\" returned she, putting her arm through his,  \"because I could not--angry with you? no; I am obliged to you,\" she  added, with an effort to smile. \"And now tell me all you think, and  what we ought to do.\"    \"Humph! you _are_ a good girl; you see, my dear, it is more than  a month since this business began; if it could have been settled  quickly, it would be settled before this, and successful or  unsuccessful, a chancery suit is ruin. There, you had better know it  all.\"    \"And are we absolutely embarked in this ruinous course?\" asked Kate,  faintly.    \"I fear so. Did you not see Moore's last letter.\"    \"No; grandpapa said there was nothing new in it.\"    \"Ha! a mistaken tenderness; there certainly was nothing new in it; but  the plot thickens; and, I fear there is no case at present, to preven  Mr. Taaffe proceeding to revive the judgment, and ultimately obtain a  receiver over your grandfather's remaining property.\"    \"A receiver--what for?\"    \"To receive the rents in payment of the debt, if debt there be.\"    \"What, all of them?\"    \"Yes all; but, do not be too much cast down, remember you have, few,  but friends sincere; who will stick by you, and--\"    \"Dear Mr. Winter, let us be silent for a moment, I want to collect my  thoughts.\"    They walked on in silence for some time.    \"Then from what you tell me, before long we may be left quite  penniless! Are you sure that this is a true picture of our case? and  that your hatred of law does not color it!\"    \"Heaven grant your conjecture may be right,\" cried Winter. \"I only tell  you my own, and I think your grandfather's, real view of the matter.  I have been long wishing for an opportunity to do so. I dreaded the  effect of the shock on your sensitive and imaginative nature, and  intended to have broken it to you gradually.\"    \"But,\" continued Kate, not noticing the latter part of his speech,  \"shall we have nothing left? no money at all! good God! And grandpapa,  what am I to do for him--and nurse? Do not think me very weak, but I  cannot help the terror I feel.\"    \"Miss Vernon, I vow to Heaven, I only intended just to prepare you a  little for the worst; perhaps matters may not be so bad as your alarmed  imagination paints. My great object in speaking thus to you is to show  the necessity for endeavouring to effect a compromise, or at least, to  come to some understanding with your grandfather as to future plans,  you cannot look about you too soon; I know the first shock of a thing  of this kind is terrible--but you are not one of those cowards who  defer looking danger in the face, until it is too late.\"    \"Yes, I know, but what plan can we possibly think of, if we are to have  all our money taken from us, what are we to do?\"    \"Dear child, be prepared for it. I would in the first place, begin at  once to curtail every possible outlay--look out for a tenant for the  Priory. Take a smaller, humbler abode, or, a thousand times better,  make our house your home, till matters are more decided.\"    \"Always kind and good,\" murmured Kate, \"and there is nothing more you  would suggest?\"    \"No; except to speak freely of it all to the Colonel, and, by so doing,  creep into his complete confidence.\"    \"Oh! Mr. Winter,\" cried Kate, with an irrepressible burst of tears,  \"and is this to be his end? I always hoped that something, I knew  not what would happen to restore him to his old position; and now to  think of his being obliged to live and end his days in some mean and  unsightly place.\"    \"Courage Kate--you know not what good may be hidden up in store for  you, behind this sterner dispensation; I have experienced severe  poverty, and I tell you, none but those who have felt it, can know how  few, how simple, and yet, how satisfying are the wants and pleasures of  life.\"    \"For you and I, yes; but for grandpapa, at his age, after youth  and manhood spent in the possession and enjoyment of wealth and a  dignified proposition.\"    \"If I mistake not, Colonel Vernon's greatest concern will be on your  account, and if he sees you content, or at least, resigned, he will be  the same.\"    \"Well, we can say no more now; I feel how necessary it was, I should  be roused from my false security, and that you have acted as a true  friend in undertaking, what I know, must have been so painful a task.  I must try and think clearly and deeply; and will speak to you about  my cogitations; meanwhile, as we shall soon be home, let us change the  subject, and I will endeavour to recover my serenity before I meet  grandpapa.\"    Winter pressed the hand she held out to him, with a feeling of sincere  respect and admiration, for the manner in which she had borne his  communications, and an earnest wish that the platform, at the next  Jews' meeting, might prove insecure, and so open the ranks of the  peerage to Fred Egerton--    \"Though,\" he added, mentally, \"there is no knowing the effects of  prosperity on him.\"    \"Is grandpapa at home, nurse?\" asked Kate.    \"No, miss, he said he felt lonesome, and walked out to see Mr. Gilpin.\"    Thankful for a few minutes' solitary reflection, she ran to her room,  and hastily fastening the door, threw herself into a chair--not to  think, that would be by no means a correct term to apply to the  confusion of ideas, and images, which presented themselves to her mind;  some most foreign to the subject of the conversation with Winter.  Dungar, and her early days, with their bright anticipations rose  painfully clear before her eyes--the dreadful possibility of seeing her  grandfather in poverty--and the insurmountable difficulty of making  nurse understand the necessity for retrenchment--the distressing  consciousness of the necessity to think deeply, struggling with  the impossibility of fixing her thoughts; and a dim feeling that an  impassable barrier was about to be raised between her and the class of  which Fred Egerton was a representative.    All these and a thousand more undefined, shadowy, outlines swept across  her mind, while she sat so still that she felt the throbbing of her  heart, as if echoed in her head, and she could almost almost hear the  pulses that vibrated through her slight frame.    Frightened at this continued rebellion of her thoughts, against her  will, she threw herself on her knees, silently laying the painful chaos  before the Almighty ruler and searcher of hearts!    \"If accepted as coming from God,\" she murmured, \"and therefore good,  nothing is unbearable, Mr. Gilpin says, and he is right; perhaps we  may succeed in this business after all, though I feel quite hopeless,  after what Mr. Winter has said--but if we have no money, could I not  earn it? I have a good knowledge of music--ah, delightful! how proud I  should be, to earn it for grandpapa, who has always taken such care of  me; and nurse would not mind it much. I like teaching. Ah! we may be  happy yet--I must speak to Mr. Winter about it. Ah! nurse's dream may  come true, but by contraries, after all; who can tell what strength  love, and God's good help may lend even to these weak arms,\" and she  stretched them out. \"Enough to support dear grandpapa, perhaps--that  would be a proud achievement!\" she said almost aloud, as a feeling of  quiet courage swelled her heart.    She proceeded to bathe her eyes and make her simple toilette,  interrupted, it is true, by a delicious vision that would intrude  itself, of Fred Egerton wealthy and powerful, flying to save her and  hers, and interposing the shield of his affectionate care between them  and every earthly ill; in vain she chided herself for so far-fetched  a thought; instinctively she felt how readily and rapturously he would  perform such a part; and however impressively she told herself she was  absurd and visionary the idea would return. It was the nearest approach  to love that had ever connected itself with him in her mind, and his"]]]
