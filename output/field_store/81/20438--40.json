A thousand circumstances of time, place, position, leisure and  disposition of the parties must control this, but as a rule, the  most generous hospitality and courtesy it is possible to give,  should be extended to your friend's friend. It is a compliment to  both the bearer and the writer of the letter. La Fontaine says: \"A  letter of introduction is a draft at sight, and you must cash it.\"  It might be added, \"You must cash it in full, never allowing the  courtesy exchange to be against the presenter of the draft.\"    Letters of introduction should bear upon the envelope the name and  address of the party introduced, written in the left hand corner--  thus:    JOHN JONES, ESQ.,  No. 714 --- Street,  Philadelphia.  Introducing L. F. Townsend, Esq., of Troy.    Letters of introduction to and from business men, for business  purposes, may be delivered by the bearers in person, and etiquette  does not require the receiver to entertain the person introduced  as the private friend of the writer. Good nature and native  courtesy would suggest some attentions, which could be increased  according to the pleasure conferred or received, but it is  entirely optional.    Letters of introduction are very useful to travellers, or those  about to change their place of residence; care, however, should be  especially taken in the latter case to present persons to each  other only, who will prove mutually agreeable, as it is surely no  friendly act to force upon your friends a life-long acquaintance,  perhaps with uncongenial persons.    A form is given for an ordinary letter of introduction, to be  varied according to circumstances, always bearing in mind that  brevity is essential, long acquaintance necessary, and some claim  on both parties important, before giving any letters of introduction  to your friends and acquaintances.    \"New York, August 12, 1869.    \"JAMES WILCOX, ESQ.,    \"Dear Sir:--Allow me to introduce to you my friend, Mr. Loving,  who will make a brief visit to your city. Any attention you may be  able to show him, during his stay, will be appreciated as a favor  by,    \"Yours sincerely,  \"E. B. Lyons.\"    (To be directed) \"JAMES WILCOX, ESQ.,  \"No. 204 --- Street,  \"Washington, D.C.  \"Introducing F. G. Loving, Esq., of New York.\"    In receiving such a letter, bear in mind the courtesy extended is  really a compliment to the writer of the letter, and such  hospitality and courtesy as you extend you are entitled to claim  again for your own friends at some future time. If you are in a  position to do so, you should follow your first call by an  invitation to dinner, or to meet friends in the evening, and if  the new comer is a stranger in the city, select such friends to  meet him or her, as will prove agreeable and valuable  acquaintances. If your are a bachelor or boarding, and cannot  extend the hospitalities of a home, offer your services as guide  to points of interest in the city, places of public amusement, in  short, extend any courtesy your purse or leisure time will  warrant.    It is contrary to etiquette for the bearer of a letter of  introduction to visit too frequently the house to which he has  just been introduced. The fact that Mr. Smith is your only friend  in town, and has been cordial in his invitations to \"make his  house your home,\" does not justify you in pulling too frequently  at Mr. Smith's door-bell, or presenting yourself at unseasonable  hours in Mrs. Smith's drawing-room.    In travelling abroad it is impossible to have too many letters of  introduction. They take up but little room in a trunk, but their  value when you find yourself \"a stranger in a strange land,\"  cannot be over-estimated.      SALUTES AND SALUTATIONS.    IN this country men do not embrace each other, nor do they  exchange kisses, while, unless amongst intimate friends, even the  fair sex now dispense with demonstrative salutations. In many  European countries kisses are exchanged, even between gentlemen,  and an embrace is quite in accordance with even a somewhat formal  salutation. In America, however, these demonstrations are mostly  confined to gushing misses and school-girls.    Men in this country acknowledge an introduction by extending the  right hand in greeting--the whole hand--for it is positively  insulting to offer two fingers, as some under-bred snobs will  sometimes do, and it is almost as bad to extend the left hand,  unless two persons are introduced at the same time, or the right  hand is useless or occupied; in any such case apologize for the  hand extended. The right hand is the sword hand, and its extension  to a friend is emblematic as a proof of peace, and as a safeguard  against treachery.    In offering the hand to a friend in the house, always remove the  glove, and grasp the hand given in return firmly for a moment. In  the street, however, the glove may be retained, if it would cause  an awkward pause to remove it; but always in such a case apologize  for the covered hand.    In shaking hands, do not try to wring them off the wrists, nor  press them as in a vise, nor pull them as though they were bell  handles, nor fling the two together with violence, so as to cause  a report. Let the palms grasp each other firmly, but without any  display of energy, and shake the hand moderately for a moment,  then release it. Mr. Pecksniff was wont to clasp his left hand  over his \"dear friend's\" right hand, resting in his own right.  This practice may be very effective, from a scenic point of view,  but it is not countenanced by any rule of etiquette.    A lady must first recognize a gentleman by bowing before he is at  liberty to salute her. She is the sole judge of the propriety of  recognizing him at all, and etiquette requires the strictest  deference to her desire in this respect. Should she recognize him,  he should raise his hat a little from his head, with the hand  furthest from her, and return her salutation with a slight  inclination of the body. He may not obtrude himself upon her  notice even if he thinks she has not observed him.    A lady should never stop in the street to salute a gentleman  friend, nor may a gentleman join a lady in the street.    Should a lady, however, stop in meeting a gentleman, etiquette  requires him to stop also, no matter how great his haste. If he is  really unable to stop any time, he must at least pause long enough  to state this fact, and apologize for leaving her in such haste.    When a lady wishes to end a conversation in the street, she should  bow slightly, and the gentleman must at once take his leave.    If a lady resumes her walk without any pause in the conversation,  a gentleman is then at liberty to join her in her promenade.    Married ladies are allowed more freedom in such matters than  unmarried ones. It is against all established laws of etiquette  for young unmarried ladies to do more than bow to gentlemen in the  street, unless the fact of relationship allows some violation of  strict etiquette.    Unless related, or upon terms of intimate friendship with a  gentleman, a lady should never salute excepting by a slightly  formal bow. A nod is vulgar, even when exchanged by intimate  friends.    In her own house, however, a lady should extend her hand in  salutation to every guest who crosses her threshold.    Froissart, that charmingly quaint writer, tells of the dame of  ancient days thus:    \"When Sir Walter Manny and his men returned from a successful  sortie out of Henneboune, the chronicle tells us,' The Countess de  Montfort came down from the castle to meet them, and with a most  cheerful countenance kissed Sir Walter Manny and all his  companions, one after the other, like a noble and valiant dame.'\"  Modern etiquette would hardly speak in praise of such a lady in  the current year.    On horseback a lady salutes by bowing slightly. A gentleman,  grasping reins and whip in his left hand, raises his hat slightly  with his right, at the same time inclining the body forward. He  may not, however, join a lady riding, unless she is escorted only  by a groom, and then he must first request permission to do so.    Never will a gentleman so far imitate a vulgar clown as to smack a  friend on the back, poke him in the ribs, or by clapping his hand  upon his shoulder. It is equally bad taste to use a familiar  shout, or \"Hullo, old boy!\" or any other \"Hail fellow, well met\"  phrase of salutation.    If a gentleman salutes another by mistake, even if he has given  him an unceremonious slap or poke, it is etiquette to treat the  offender with the utmost courtesy. He will probably be  sufficiently embarrassed, when he discovers his error, without  having any blunt speech made to add to his discomfiture.    If a gentleman meet a gentleman, be may salute him by touching his  hat without removing it, but if a lady be with either gentleman  both hats must be lifted in salutation.    If a gentleman stops to speak to a lady, in the street, he must  hold his hat in his hand during the interview, unless she requests  him to replace it. With a gentleman friend etiquette does not  require this formality.    A gentleman may bow to a lady seated at a window, if he is passing  on the street, but he must not bow from a window to a lady on the  street.    A gentleman may never offer to shake hands with a lady, but he  must accept such an offer on her part, taking her hand lightly but  firmly in his ungloved right one, and delicately shaking it for a  moment. A pressure is an insult in such a case.    In entering a church a gentleman must remove his hat as soon as  his foot crosses the threshold of the sacred edifice. Travellers  will often omit this salutation in visiting churches abroad, whose  faith differs from their own. There is no more certain sign of ill  breeding as well as irreverence.    A gentleman may always bow to a lady he may meet on a airway, even  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8492"],[0,"The King in Yellow (#5)"],[1," known that he is entitled  to the fame of it.\"    \"He won't thank you for that,\" I answered sharply; \"please say nothing  about it.\"    \"Do you know what it is worth?\" said Hawberk.    \"No, fifty dollars, perhaps.\"    \"It is valued at five hundred, but the owner of the 'Prince's Emblazoned'  will give two thousand dollars to the person who completes his suit; that  reward also belongs to Mr. Wilde.\"    \"He doesn't want it! He refuses it!\" I answered angrily. \"What do you  know about Mr. Wilde? He doesn't need the money. He is rich--or will  be--richer than any living man except myself. What will we care for money  then--what will we care, he and I, when--when--\"    \"When what?\" demanded Hawberk, astonished.    \"You will see,\" I replied, on my guard again.    He looked at me narrowly, much as Doctor Archer used to, and I knew he  thought I was mentally unsound. Perhaps it was fortunate for him that he  did not use the word lunatic just then.    \"No,\" I replied to his unspoken thought, \"I am not mentally weak; my mind  is as healthy as Mr. Wilde's. I do not care to explain just yet what I  have on hand, but it is an investment which will pay more than mere gold,  silver and precious stones. It will secure the happiness and prosperity  of a continent--yes, a hemisphere!\"    \"Oh,\" said Hawberk.    \"And eventually,\" I continued more quietly, \"it will secure the happiness  of the whole world.\"    \"And incidentally your own happiness and prosperity as well as Mr.  Wilde's?\"    \"Exactly,\" I smiled. But I could have throttled him for taking that tone.    He looked at me in silence for a while and then said very gently, \"Why  don't you give up your books and studies, Mr. Castaigne, and take a tramp  among the mountains somewhere or other? You used to be fond of fishing.  Take a cast or two at the trout in the Rangelys.\"    \"I don't care for fishing any more,\" I answered, without a shade of  annoyance in my voice.    \"You used to be fond of everything,\" he continued; \"athletics, yachting,  shooting, riding--\"    \"I have never cared to ride since my fall,\" I said quietly.    \"Ah, yes, your fall,\" he repeated, looking away from me.    I thought this nonsense had gone far enough, so I brought the  conversation back to Mr. Wilde; but he was scanning my face again in a  manner highly offensive to me.    \"Mr. Wilde,\" he repeated, \"do you know what he did this afternoon? He  came downstairs and nailed a sign over the hall door next to mine; it  read:    \"MR. WILDE,  REPAIRER OF REPUTATIONS.  Third Bell.    \"Do you know what a Repairer of Reputations can be?\"    \"I do,\" I replied, suppressing the rage within.    \"Oh,\" he said again.    Louis and Constance came strolling by and stopped to ask if we would join  them. Hawberk looked at his watch. At the same moment a puff of smoke  shot from the casemates of Castle William, and the boom of the sunset gun  rolled across the water and was re-echoed from the Highlands opposite.  The flag came running down from the flag-pole, the bugles sounded on the  white decks of the warships, and the first electric light sparkled out  from the Jersey shore.    As I turned into the city with Hawberk I heard Constance murmur something  to Louis which I did not understand; but Louis whispered \"My darling,\" in  reply; and again, walking ahead with Hawberk through the square I heard a  murmur of \"sweetheart,\" and \"my own Constance,\" and I knew the time had  nearly arrived when I should speak of important matters with my cousin  Louis.          III    One morning early in May I stood before the steel safe in my bedroom,  trying on the golden jewelled crown. The diamonds flashed fire as I  turned to the mirror, and the heavy beaten gold burned like a halo about  my head. I remembered Camilla's agonized scream and the awful words  echoing through the dim streets of Carcosa. They were the last lines in  the first act, and I dared not think of what followed--dared not, even  in the spring sunshine, there in my own room, surrounded with familiar  objects, reassured by the bustle from the street and the voices of the  servants in the hallway outside. For those poisoned words had dropped  slowly into my heart, as death-sweat drops upon a bed-sheet and is  absorbed. Trembling, I put the diadem from my head and wiped my forehead,  but I thought of Hastur and of my own rightful ambition, and I remembered  Mr. Wilde as I had last left him, his face all torn and bloody from the  claws of that devil's creature, and what he said--ah, what he said. The  alarm bell in the safe began to whirr harshly, and I knew my time was up;  but I would not heed it, and replacing the flashing circlet upon my head  I turned defiantly to the mirror. I stood for a long time absorbed in the  changing expression of my own eyes. The mirror reflected a face which was  like my own, but whiter, and so thin that I hardly recognized it And all  the time I kept repeating between my clenched teeth, \"The day has come!  the day has come!\" while the alarm in the safe whirred and clamoured, and  the diamonds sparkled and flamed above my brow. I heard a door open but  did not heed it. It was only when I saw two faces in the mirror:--it was  only when another face rose over my shoulder, and two other eyes met  mine. I wheeled like a flash and seized a long knife from my  dressing-table, and my cousin sprang back very pale, crying: \"Hildred!  for God's sake!\" then as my hand fell, he said: \"It is I, Louis, don't  you know me?\" I stood silent. I could not have spoken for my life. He  walked up to me and took the knife from my hand.    \"What is all this?\" he inquired, in a gentle voice. \"Are you ill?\"    \"No,\" I replied. But I doubt if he heard me.    \"Come, come, old fellow,\" he cried, \"take off that brass crown and toddle  into the study. Are you going to a masquerade? What's all this theatrical  tinsel anyway?\"    I was glad he thought the crown was made of brass and paste, yet I didn't  like him any the better for thinking so. I let him take it from my hand,  knowing it was best to humour him. He tossed the splendid diadem in the  air, and catching it, turned to me smiling.    \"It's dear at fifty cents,\" he said. \"What's it for?\"    I did not answer, but took the circlet from his hands, and placing it in  the safe shut the massive steel door. The alarm ceased its infernal din  at once. He watched me curiously, but did not seem to notice the sudden  ceasing of the alarm. He did, however, speak of the safe as a biscuit  box. Fearing lest he might examine the combination I led the way into my  study. Louis threw himself on the sofa and flicked at flies with his  eternal riding-whip. He wore his fatigue uniform with the braided jacket  and jaunty cap, and I noticed that his riding-boots were all splashed  with red mud.    \"Where have you been?\" I inquired.    \"Jumping mud creeks in Jersey,\" he said. \"I haven't had time to change  yet; I was rather in a hurry to see you. Haven't you got a glass of  something? I'm dead tired; been in the saddle twenty-four hours.\"    I gave him some brandy from my medicinal store, which he drank with a  grimace.    \"Damned bad stuff,\" he observed. \"I'll give you an address where they  sell brandy that is brandy.\"    \"It's good enough for my needs,\" I said indifferently. \"I use it to rub  my chest with.\" He stared and flicked at another fly.    \"See here, old fellow,\" he began, \"I've got something to suggest to you.  It's four years now that you've shut yourself up here like an owl, never  going anywhere, never taking any healthy exercise, never doing a damn  thing but poring over those books up there on the mantelpiece.\"    He glanced along the row of shelves. \"Napoleon, Napoleon, Napoleon!\" he  read. \"For heaven's sake, have you nothing but Napoleons there?\"    \"I wish they were bound in gold,\" I said. \"But wait, yes, there is  another book, _The King in Yellow_.\" I looked him steadily in the  eye.    \"Have you never read it?\" I asked.    \"I? No, thank God! I don't want to be driven crazy.\"    I saw he regretted his speech as soon as he had uttered it. There is only  one word which I loathe more than I do lunatic and that word is crazy.  But I controlled myself and asked him why he thought _The King in  Yellow_ dangerous.    \"Oh, I don't know,\" he said, hastily. \"I only remember the excitement it  created and the denunciations from pulpit and Press. I believe the author  shot himself after bringing forth this monstrosity, didn't he?\"    \"I understand he is still alive,\" I answered.    \"That's probably true,\" he muttered; \"bullets couldn't kill a fiend like  that.\"    \"It is a book of great truths,\" I said.    \"Yes,\" he replied, \"of 'truths' which send men frantic and blast their  lives. I don't care if the thing is, as they say, the very supreme  essence of art. It's a crime to have written it, and I for one shall  never open its pages.\"    \"Is that what you have come to tell me?\" I asked.    \"No,\" he said, \"I came to tell you that I am going to be married.\"    I believe for a moment my heart ceased to beat, but I kept my eyes on his  face.    \"Yes,\" he continued, smiling happily, \"married to the sweetest girl on  earth.\"    \"Constance Hawberk,\" I said mechanically.    \"How did you know?\" he cried, astonished. \"I didn't know it myself until  that evening last April, when we strolled down to the embankment before  dinner.\"    \"When is it to be?\" I asked.    \"It was to have been next September, but an hour ago a despatch came  ordering our regiment to the Presidio, San Francisco. We leave at noon  to-morrow. To-morrow,\" he repeated. \"Just think, Hildred, to-morrow I  shall be the happiest fellow that ever drew breath in this jolly world,  for Constance will go with me.\"    I offered him my hand in congratulation, and he seized and shook it like  the good-natured fool he was--or pretended to be.    \"I am going to get my squadron as a wedding present,\" he rattled on.  \"Captain and Mrs. Louis Castaigne, eh, Hildred?\""]]]
