But if the man is from Oklahoma, I sometimes have to  lie just a little to make the story interesting to him.  Those  Okies are almost as bad as Texans about story telling.    Some people think Texas is a state, but it's not.  Texas is a  state of mind, an attitude, a broad open expanse of freedom and  liberty known only to Texans.  It's a feeling you can never get  just by living in Texas, you've got to be born in Texas.    There are other happenings dating back to the Flint place.  Here  are a couple which took place before my time.  I can only relate  them to you as they were told to me.    We don't know where Frank got his first taste of chewing tobacco,  but he liked it and he wanted another taste.  It was only a half-  mile from our house over to Uncle Andrew's.  Now, Uncle Andrew  chewed tobacco and Frank knew it.  So, Frank found it easy to get  Mama to let him walk over there to play with Ruth.  He also found  it easy to ask Ruth if she knew where her dad kept his tobacco.    She knew all right, and she found it easy to \"snitch\" a chew for  Frank.  She also had the forethought to make sure she took enough  for both of them.  But, now that they had the tobacco in their  possession, it wouldn't be smart to risk being caught playing  around the house with tobacco in their mouths.    So, now Frank tells Aunt Mary he came over to see if Ruth could  come over to his house and play.  Yes, Aunt Mary would allow her  to go, which was a perfect set-up for five-year-old kids.  They  could chew the tobacco all the way from Ruth's house over to  Frank's house, just so they got rid of it before they got there.  Who cares how long it might take two little kids to walk a half  mile?  They could chew a long time.    However, one little problem developed.  The tobacco didn't affect  Frank at all, but before they got to Frank's house, Ruth was as  sick as a horse.    Naturally, they didn't dare tell why she was sick.  And she was  sure she would feel better in a little while.    Another little story came to me from Susie, my older sister.  She  was always having to see after the baby of the family.  At this  time Albert was the baby and I was about three years old.  She  probably had to take care of me also, when I was a baby.  But on  this particular day--the day of the snuff--Mama, Grandma, and I  went out to the garden.  Susie wanted to go but had to stay in  the house with Albert.    This was one of the few times during my childhood that I was just  the right size, and here I am, unable to remember a thing about  it.  Susie had to tell me about it.  If I had been any smaller, I  might have had to stay in the house with Susie and Albert.  And  if I had been any larger, I might have had to watch after Albert  while Susie went to the garden.    Anyway, Susie's brain was partly angry but mostly just idle, so  the devil used it for his workshop.    Grandma had put her snuffbox on the door casing above the kitchen  door.  Susie had never been allowed to taste snuff, but she  reasoned that it must be something special, because Grandma  \"dipped\" it all the time.    Many's the time Grandma would send me to the \"branch\" (creek) to  bring her a small hackberry limb for a tooth brush.  (It was  really a snuff brush.)  She would take a hackberry twig about  twice as big and twice as long as a wooden match and chew on one  end until it \"frazzled\" out into a bristle.  Then she would dip  the damp bristle into her snuff, put it in her mouth, and work  happily for hours, with the \"brush\" extending out one corner of  her mouth.    Now, this picture of contentment on Grandma's face as she dipped  and worked, is what the devil showed to Susie when he told her  she ought to climb up on the kitchen cabinet and get her some of  that delicious brown snuff in the little tin box.    She climbed up in a chair and got up on the cabinet, only to find  that she couldn't reach the snuff.  But she didn't give up.  She  climbed back down and put a chair up on the cabinet.  Then she  climbed up in the bottom chair to get onto the cabinet so she  could get up in the top chair.  And by leaning way over, she  could reach the snuffbox.    Now, Susie didn't want to climb down to dip her snuff.  It would  be too hard to have to climb all the way back up to put the snuff  back on the shelf over the door.  So she just sat down in the  upper chair and began dipping the snuff.    That's about all the story.  At least that's all she remembered.  She never did know how she got down from the chairs and the  cabinet.  She only remembers that, when she began to regain  consciousness, she was a mighty sick little girl, and snuff had  lost its charm and glitter.          CHAPTER 3    AT THE EXUM FARM AFTER I WAS FIVE    We, the Will Johnsons, owned this first farm 12 years.  Then in  the fall of 1910, Papa bought the Exum farm, just east of us.  It  was much larger and it fitted our needs better.  There were 332  acres in the place, and we paid $9,000 for it.    When January rolled around, it was time for us to move onto the  Exum place.  And on the day we moved that half-mile, I had to  stay at our old home.  I was allowed to help load the wagons at  our old farm, but they wouldn't let me go with them to our new  home to unload the wagons.  Of course, that hurt my feelings  terribly.    But I was hurt even worse when one of the older boys came running  back to the house to get a gun to kill a skunk down on the  creek--and Mama wouldn't let me go with him.    She said, \"No, you can't go.  You're too little.\"    I didn't understand how Mama could be so mistaken in my size.  I  was as big as most of the other boys, I thought, and smarter than  some of them.    After we got moved to the new home, again Papa set out to build  whatever buildings we needed to suit our wants.  There was  already a house and a good size barn.  And when Papa finished  building, there were shelters for tools, livestock, poultry, and  a blacksmith shop.    He made a large, roomy cellar at our new home.  I can't remember  ever having to go to the cellar because of a storm, but it was  there just in case.  And it was good for storing fruits,  vegetables, and canned goods.    One time Papa brought home a stalk of bananas and hung it down in  the cellar.  Down there it would be protected from the heat of  the days and the freezing nights.  Papa explained to us that we  should eat the ripest bananas first before they got too ripe and  had to be thrown away.  Then some of the older kids jokingly told  that Papa said, \"Eat the rotten ones first and wait till the  others rot to eat them.\"    We were poor in terms of money, yet we had as much as or more  than the average family in our community.  Papa was a carpenter,  a blacksmith, a good farmer.  And when automobiles came along, he  became a mechanic.    We never left our hack out in the weather, we had a shed to  shelter it.  Our barn was second to none in our neighborhood,  especially by the time we finished building sheds and stalls on  both sides of it.  Later on, we got a car and built a shed for  it.  We didn't call it a garage, it was a car shed.  And one time  Papa bought another house, moved it up beside ours, and joined  them together.    We had a good well of water, a big windmill, and a cypress water  tank on a tower about ten feet tall.  The tower under the tank  was boarded up on all four sides to form a room that was used for  keeping milk, butter, watermelons, and other things cool.  Screened windows allowed the wind to pass through.  That was  about the coolest place on the farm.    Next to the windmill was a garden, fenced rabbit proof and  irrigated with water from the well.  Every summer we had roasting  ears, popcorn, cantaloupes, watermelons, peanuts, okra, squash,  pumpkins, and more kinds of beans and peas than I can name.    The barn was filled with feed heads, corn, and cottonseed, both  for planting and for feeding.  There was room in the barn and  adjoining sheds for horses, cows, chickens and hogs.  And up in  the loft, there were peanuts still on the vines.    Some of our neighbors had given up trying to grow peanuts because  rabbits ate so many of the vines.  It was all but impossible to  keep the rabbits out of the patch.  But we always grew peanuts  anyway.  When neighbors asked Papa how he managed to grow so many  good peanuts, he told them he just planted enough for the rabbits  and the youngsters too.  I can't remember when we didn't have  enough peanuts in the barn loft to last all winter.  We stored  them on the vines and then we picked them off as we needed them,  and fed the vines to the stock.    I remember one sunny afternoon, four or five of us boys were  sitting up in the barn over the horse stalls eating peanuts.  I  was sitting on a board that was nailed to the underside of the  ceiling joists.  Well, the nails pulled out of the board and I  fell to the ground and hit my head on a wooden block.  The block  proved to be tougher than my head.  It cut a two-inch gash in my  scalp above my right ear.  Papa took me to our family doctor and  had it sewed up.    The story was told on us boys that, when we were all little, a  mule kicked one of us in the head, and that boy was never quite  normal after that.  But then, as we grew older, we all got to  acting so much alike that Mama and Papa couldn't tell which one  of us the mule had kicked.    Many years later, during the depression of the 1930s, a neighbor  was giving me a homemade haircut one Sunday afternoon and, when  he discovered the scar on my head, he laughed and said, \"Now I  know which one the mule kicked.\"    Now let's get back to the story of when I was a boy on the Exum  farm.  I started to school when I was seven.  In fact, most kids  started at seven in those days.  And since I was seven when  school started in September, that meant I had been seven since  last January 11th.  In other words I was almost eight.    While we lived at the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5430"],[0,"Preface to a Dictionary of the English Language (#5)"],[1,"rather with subtilty than  skill, and the attention is harrassed with unnecessary minuteness.    The examples are too often injudiciously truncated, and perhaps  sometimes, I hope very rarely, alleged in a mistaken sense; for in  making this collection I trusted more to memory, than, in a state  of disquiet and embarrassment, memory can contain, and purposed  to supply at the review what was left incomplete in the first  transcription.    Many terms appropriated to particular occupations, though necessary  and significant, are undoubtedly omitted; and of the words most  studiously considered and exemplified, many senses have escaped  observation.    Yet these failures, however frequent, may admit extenuation and  apology. To have attempted much is always laudable, even when the  enterprize is above the strength that undertakes it: To rest below  his own aim is incident to every one whose fancy is active, and  whose views are comprehensive; nor is any man satisfied with himself  because he has done much, but because he can conceive little. When  first I engaged in this work, I resolved to leave neither words  nor things unexamined, and pleased myself with a prospect of the  hours which I should revel away in feasts of literature, with the  obscure recesses of northern learning, which I should enter and  ransack; the treasures with which I expected every search into those  neglected mines to reward my labour, and the triumph with which I  should display my acquisitions to mankind. When I had thus enquired  into the original of words, I resolved to show likewise my attention  to things; to pierce deep into every science, to enquire the nature  of every substance of which I inserted the name, to limit every idea  by a definition strictly logical, and exhibit every production of  art or nature in an accurate description, that my book might be in  place of all other dictionaries whether appellative or technical.  But these were the dreams of a poet doomed at last to wake  a lexicographer.  I soon found that it is too late to look for  instruments, when the work calls for execution, and that whatever  abilities I had brought to my task, with those I must finally  perform it. To deliberate whenever I doubted, to enquire whenever  I was ignorant, would have protracted the undertaking without end,  and, perhaps, without much improvement; for I did not find by my  first experiments, that that I had not of my own was easily to be  obtained: I saw that one enquiry only gave occasion to another,  that book referred to book, that to search was not always to find,  and to find was not always to be informed; and that thus to persue  perfection, was, like the first inhabitants of Arcadia, to chace  the sun, which, when they had reached the hill where he seemed to  rest, was still beheld at the same distance from them.    I then contracted my design, determining to confide in myself, and  no longer to solicit auxiliaries, which produced more incumbrance  than assistance: by this I obtained at least one advantage, that  I set limits to my work, which would in time be ended, though not  completed.    Despondency has never so far prevailed as to depress me to  negligence; some faults will at last appear to be the effects of  anxious diligence and persevering activity. The nice and subtle  ramifications of meaning were not easily avoided by a mind intent  upon accuracy, and convinced of the necessity of disentangling  combinations, and separating similitudes. Many of the distinctions  which to common readers appear useless and idle, will be found  real and important by men versed in the school philosophy, without  which no dictionary shall ever be accurately compiled, or skilfully  examined. Some senses however there are, which, though not the same,  are yet so nearly allied, that they are often confounded. Most men  think indistinctly, and therefore cannot speak with exactness; and  consequently some examples might be indifferently put to either  signification: this uncertainty is not to be imputed to me, who do  not form, but register the language; who do not teach men how they  should think, but relate how they have hitherto expressed their  thoughts.    The imperfect sense of some examples I lamented, but could not  remedy, and hope they will be compensated by innumerable passages  selected with propriety, and preserved with exactness; some shining  with sparks of imagination, and some replete with treasures of  wisdom.    The orthography and etymology, though imperfect, are not imperfect  for want of care, but because care will not always be successful,  and recollection or information come too late for use.    That many terms of art and manufacture are omitted, must be frankly  acknowledged; but for this defect I may boldly allege that it  was unavoidable: I could not visit caverns to learn the miner's  language, nor take a voyage to perfect my skill in the dialect of  navigation, nor visit the warehouses of merchants, and shops of  artificers, to gain the names of wares, tools and operations, of  which no mention is found in books; what favourable accident, or  easy enquiry brought within my reach, has not been neglected; but  it had been a hopeless labour to glean up words, by courting living  information, and contesting with the sullenness of one, and the  roughness of another.    To furnish the academicians della Crusca with words of this kind,  a series of comedies called la Fiera, or the Fair, was professedly  written by Buonaroti; but I had no such assistant, and therefore  was content to want what they must have wanted likewise, had they  not luckily been so supplied.    Nor are all words which are not found in the vocabulary, to be  lamented as omissions. Of the laborious and mercantile part of the  people, the diction is in a great measure casual and mutable; many  of their terms are formed for some temporary or local convenience,  and though current at certain times and places, are in others  utterly unknown. This fugitive cant, which is always in a state of  increase or decay, cannot be regarded as any part of the durable  materials of a language, and therefore must be suffered to perish  with other things unworthy of preservation.    Care will sometimes betray to the appearance of negligence. He that  is catching opportunities which seldom occur, will suffer those to  pass by unregarded, which he expects hourly to return; he that is  searching for rare and remote things, will neglect those that are  obvious and familiar: thus many of the most common and cursory words  have been inserted with little illustration, because in gathering  the authorities, I forbore to copy those which I thought likely to  occur whenever they were wanted. It is remarkable that, in reviewing  my collection, I found the word sea unexemplified.    Thus it happens, that in things difficult there is danger from  ignorance, and in things easy from confidence; the mind, afraid of  greatness, and disdainful of littleness, hastily withdraws herself  from painful searches, and passes with scornful rapidity over tasks  not adequate to her powers, sometimes too secure for caution, and  again too anxious for vigorous effort; sometimes idle in a plain  path, and sometimes distracted in labyrinths, and dissipated by  different intentions.    A large work is difficult because it is large, even though all  its parts might singly be performed with facility; where there are  many things to be done, each must be allowed its share of time and  labour, in the proportion only which it bears to the whole; nor can  it be expected, that the stones which form the dome of a temple,  should be squared and polished like the diamond of a ring.    Of the event of this work, for which, having laboured it with so  much application, I cannot but have some degree of parental fondness,  it is natural to form conjectures. Those who have been persuaded  to think well of my design, will require that it should fix our  language, and put a stop to those alterations which time and chance  have hitherto been suffered to make in it without opposition.  With this consequence I will confess that I flattered myself for  a while; but now begin to fear that I have indulged expectation  which neither reason nor experience can justify. When we see men  grow old and die at a certain time one after another, from century  to century, we laugh at the elixir that promises to prolong life  to a thousand years; and with equal justice may the lexicographer  be derided, who being able to produce no example of a nation that  has preserved their words and phrases from mutability, shall imagine  that his dictionary can embalm his language, and secure it from  corruption and decay, that it is in his power to change sublunary  nature, and clear the world at once from folly, vanity, and  affectation.    With this hope, however, academies have been instituted, to guard  the avenues of their languages, to retain fugitives, and repulse  intruders; but their vigilance and activity have hitherto been  vain; sounds are too volatile and subtile for legal restraints; to  enchain syllables, and to lash the wind, are equally the undertakings  of pride, unwilling to measure its desires by its strength. The  French language has visibly changed under the inspection of the  academy; the stile of Amelot's translation of Father Paul is observed  by Le Courayer to be un peu passe; and no Italian will maintain  that the diction of any modern writer is not perceptibly different  from that of Boccace, Machiavel, or Caro.    Total and sudden transformations of a language seldom happen; conquests  and migrations are now very rare: but there are other causes of  change, which, though slow in their operation, and invisible in  their progress, are perhaps as much superiour to human resistance,  as the revolutions of the sky, or intumescence of the tide.
