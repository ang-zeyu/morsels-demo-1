[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10084"],[0,"Kazan (#6)"],[1," In a snarling  mass the pack closed in from behind, and the doe went down, with Kazan  half under her body, his fangs sunk deep in her jugular. She lay heavily  on him, but he did not lose his hold. It was his first big kill. His  blood ran like fire. He snarled between his clamped teeth.    Not until the last quiver had left the body over him did he pull himself  out from under her chest and forelegs. He had killed a rabbit that day  and was not hungry. So he sat back in the snow and waited, while the  ravenous pack tore at the dead doe. After a little he came nearer, nosed  in between two of them, and was nipped for his intrusion.    As Kazan drew back, still hesitating to mix with his wild brothers, a  big gray form leaped out of the pack and drove straight for his throat.  He had just time to throw his shoulder to the attack, and for a moment  the two rolled over and over in the snow. They were up before the  excitement of sudden battle had drawn the pack from the feast. Slowly  they circled about each other, their white fangs bare, their yellowish  backs bristling like brushes. The fatal ring of wolves drew about the  fighters.    It was not new to Kazan. A dozen times he had sat in rings like this,  waiting for the final moment. More than once he had fought for his life  within the circle. It was the sledge-dog way of fighting. Unless man  interrupted with a club or a whip it always ended in death. Only one  fighter could come out alive. Sometimes both died. And there was no man  here--only that fatal cordon of waiting white-fanged demons, ready to  leap upon and tear to pieces the first of the fighters who was thrown  upon his side or back. Kazan was a stranger, but he did not fear those  that hemmed him in. The one great law of the pack would compel them to  be fair.    He kept his eyes only on the big gray leader who had challenged him.  Shoulder to shoulder they continued to circle. Where a few moments  before there had been the snapping of jaws and the rending of flesh  there was now silence. Soft-footed and soft-throated mongrel dogs from  the South would have snarled and growled, but Kazan and the wolf were  still, their ears laid forward instead of back, their tails free and  bushy.    Suddenly the wolf struck in with the swiftness of lightning, and his  jaws came together with the sharpness of steel striking steel. They  missed by an inch. In that same instant Kazan darted in to the side, and  like knives his teeth gashed the wolf's flank.    They circled again, their eyes growing redder, their lips drawn back  until they seemed to have disappeared. And then Kazan leaped for that  death-grip at the throat--and missed. It was only by an inch again, and  the wolf came back, as he had done, and laid open Kazan's flank so that  the blood ran down his leg and reddened the snow. The burn of that  flank-wound told Kazan that his enemy was old in the game of fighting.  He crouched low, his head straight out, and his throat close to the  snow. It was a trick Kazan had learned in puppyhood--to shield his  throat, and wait.    Twice the wolf circled about him, and Kazan pivoted slowly, his eyes  half closed. A second time the wolf leaped, and Kazan threw up his  terrible jaws, sure of that fatal grip just in front of the forelegs.  His teeth snapped on empty air. With the nimbleness of a cat the wolf  had gone completely over his back.    The trick had failed, and with a rumble of the dog-snarl in his throat,  Kazan reached the wolf in a single bound. They met breast to breast.  Their fangs clashed and with the whole weight of his body, Kazan flung  himself against the wolf's shoulders, cleared his jaws, and struck again  for the throat hold. It was another miss--by a hair's breadth--and  before he could recover, the wolf's teeth were buried in the back of  his neck.    For the first time in his life Kazan felt the terror and the pain of the  death-grip, and with a mighty effort he flung his head a little forward  and snapped blindly. His powerful jaws closed on the wolf's foreleg,  close to the body. There was a cracking of bone and a crunching of  flesh, and the circle of waiting wolves grew tense and alert. One or the  other of the fighters was sure to go down before the holds were broken,  and they but awaited that fatal fall as a signal to leap in to the  death.    Only the thickness of hair and hide on the back of Kazan's neck, and the  toughness of his muscles, saved him from that terrible fate of the  vanquished. The wolf's teeth sank deep, but not deep enough to reach the  vital spot, and suddenly Kazan put every ounce of strength in his limbs  to the effort, and flung himself up bodily from under his antagonist.  The grip on his neck relaxed, and with another rearing leap he tore  himself free.    As swift as a whip-lash he whirled on the broken-legged leader of the  pack and with the full rush and weight of his shoulders struck him  fairly in the side. More deadly than the throat-grip had Kazan sometimes  found the lunge when delivered at the right moment. It was deadly now.  The big gray wolf lost his feet, rolled upon his back for an instant,  and the pack rushed in, eager to rend the last of life from the leader  whose power had ceased to exist.    From out of that gray, snarling, bloody-lipped mass, Kazan drew back,  panting and bleeding. He was weak. There was a curious sickness in his  head. He wanted to lie down in the snow. But the old and infallible  instinct warned him not to betray that weakness. From out of the pack a  slim, lithe, gray she-wolf came up to him, and lay down in the snow  before him, and then rose swiftly and sniffed at his wounds.    She was young and strong and beautiful, but Kazan did not look at her.  Where the fight had been he was looking, at what little remained of the  old leader. The pack had returned to the feast. He heard again the  cracking of bones and the rending of flesh, and something told him that  hereafter all the wilderness would hear and recognize his voice, and  that when he sat back on his haunches and called to the moon and the  stars, those swift-footed hunters of the big plain would respond to it.  He circled twice about the caribou and the pack, and then trotted off to  the edge of the black spruce forest.    When he reached the shadows he looked back. Gray Wolf was following him.  She was only a few yards behind. And now she came up to him, a little  timidly, and she, too, looked back to the dark blotch of life out on the  lake. And as she stood there close beside him, Kazan sniffed at  something in the air that was not the scent of blood, nor the perfume of  the balsam and spruce. It was a thing that seemed to come to him from  the clear stars, the cloudless moon, the strange and beautiful quiet of  the night itself. And its presence seemed to be a part of Gray Wolf.    He looked at her, and he found Gray Wolf's eyes alert and questioning.  She was young--so young that she seemed scarcely to have passed out of  puppyhood. Her body was strong and slim and beautifully shaped. In the  moonlight the hair under her throat and along her back shone sleek and  soft. She whined at the red staring light in Kazan's eyes, and it was  not a puppy's whimper. Kazan moved toward her, and stood with his head  over her back, facing the pack. He felt her trembling against his chest.  He looked at the moon and the stars again, the mystery of Gray Wolf and  of the night throbbing in his blood.    Not much of his life had been spent at the posts. Most of it had been on  the trail--in the traces--and the spirit of the mating season had only  stirred him from afar. But it was very near now. Gray Wolf lifted her  head. Her soft muzzle touched the wound on his neck, and in the  gentleness of that touch, in the low sound in her throat, Kazan felt and  heard again that wonderful something that had come with the caress of  the woman's hand and the sound of her voice.    He turned, whining, his back bristling, his head high and defiant of the  wilderness which he faced. Gray Wolf trotted close at his side as they  entered into the gloom of the forest.          CHAPTER V    THE FIGHT IN THE SNOW      They found shelter that night under thick balsam, and when they lay down  on the soft carpet of needles which the snow had not covered, Gray Wolf  snuggled her warm body close to Kazan and licked his wounds. The day  broke with a velvety fall of snow, so white and thick that they could  not see a dozen leaps ahead of them in the open. It was quite warm, and  so still that the whole world seemed filled with only the flutter and  whisper of the snowflakes. Through this day Kazan and Gray Wolf traveled  side by side. Time and again he turned his head back to the ridge over  which he had come, and Gray Wolf could not understand the strange note  that trembled in his throat.    In the afternoon they returned to what was left of the caribou doe on  the lake. In the edge of the forest Gray Wolf hung back. She did not yet  know the meaning of poison-baits, deadfalls and traps, but the instinct  of numberless generations was in her veins, and it told her there was  danger in visiting a second time a thing that had grown cold in death.    Kazan had seen masters work about carcasses that the wolves had left. He  had seen them conceal traps cleverly, and roll little capsules of  strychnine in the fat of the entrails, and once he had put a foreleg in  a trap, and had experienced its sting and pain and deadly grip. But he  did not have Gray Wolf's fear. He urged her to accompany him to the  white hummocks on the ice, and at last she went with him and sank back  restlessly on her haunches, while he dug out the bones and pieces of  flesh that the snow had kept from freezing. But she would not eat, and  at last Kazan went and sat on his haunches at her side, and with her  looked at what he had dug out from under the snow. He sniffed the air.  He could not smell danger, but Gray Wolf told"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10114"],[0,"The Great Events (#6)"],[1," Virginius, and he passed through them holding up the bloody knife, and  went out at the gate and made straight for the army. There, when the  soldiers had heard his tale, they at once abandoned their decemviral  generals and marched to Rome. They were soon followed by the other army  from the Sabine frontier; for to them Icilius had gone, and Numitorius;  and they found willing ears among men who were already enraged by the  murder of old Siccius Dentatus. So the two armies joined their banners,  elected new generals, and encamped upon the Aventine hill, the quarter  of the plebeians.    Meantime the people at home had risen against Appius, and after driving  him from the Forum they joined their armed fellow-citizens upon the  Aventine. There the whole body of the commons, armed and unarmed, hung  like a dark cloud ready to burst upon the city.    Whatever may be the truth of the legends of Siccius and Virginia, there  can be no doubt that the conduct of the decemvirs had brought matters to  the verge of civil war. At this juncture the senate met, and the  moderate party so far prevailed as to send their own leaders, M.  Horatius Barbatus and L. Valerius Potitus, to negotiate with the  insurgents. The plebeians were ready to listen to the voices of these  men; for they remembered that the consuls of the first year of the  Republic, when the patrician burgesses were friends to the plebeians,  were named Valerius and Horatius; and so they appointed M. Duillius, a  former tribune, to be their spokesman. But no good came of it; and  Duillius persuaded the plebeians to leave the city, and once more to  occupy the Sacred Mount.    Then remembrances of the great secession came back upon the minds of the  patricians, and the senate, observing the calm and resolute bearing of  the plebeian leaders, compelled the decemvirs to resign, and sent back  Valerius and Horatius to negotiate anew.    The leaders of the plebeians demanded: First, that the tribuneship  should be restored, and the _Comitia Tributa_ recognized; secondly, that  a right of appeal to the people against the power of the supreme  magistrate should be secured; thirdly, that full indemnity should be  granted to the movers and promoters of the late secession; fourthly,  that the decemvirs should be burnt alive.    Of these demands the deputies of the senate agreed to the three first;  but the fourth, they said, was unworthy of a free people; it was a piece  of tyranny, as bad as any of the worst acts of the late government; and  it was needless, because anyone who had reason of complaint against the  late decemvirs might proceed against them according to law. The  plebeians listened to these words of wisdom, and withdrew their savage  demand. The other three were confirmed by the fathers, and the plebeians  returned to their quarters on the Aventine. Here they held an assembly  according to their tribes, in which the pontifex Maximus presided; and  they now, for the first time, elected ten tribunes--first Virginius,  Numitorius, and Icilius, then Duillius and six others: so full were  their minds of the wrong done to the daughter of Virginius; so entirely  was it the blood of young Virginia that overthrew the decemvirs, even as  that of Lucretia had driven out the Tarquins.    The plebeians had now returned to the city, headed by their ten  tribunes, a number which was never again altered so long as the  tribunate continued in existence. It remained for the patricians to  redeem the pledges given by their agents Valerius and Horatius on the  other demands of the plebeian leaders.    The first thing to settle was the election of the supreme magistrates.  The decemvirs had fallen, and the state was without any executive  government.    It has been supposed, as we have said above, that the government of the  decemvirs was intended to be perpetual. The patricians gave up their  consuls, and the plebeians their tribunes, on condition that each order  was to be admitted to an equal share in the new decemviral college. But  the tribunes were now restored in augmented number, and it was but  natural that the patricians should insist on again occupying all places  in the supreme magistracy. By common consent, as it would seem, the  Comitia of the Centuries met and elected to the consulate the two  patricians who had shown themselves the friends of both orders: L.  Valerius Potitus and M. Horatius Barbatus. Thus ended the government of  the decemvirate.          PERICLES RULES IN ATHENS    B.C. 444    PLUTARCH      (Under the sway of Pericles many changes occurred in the civil affairs  of Athens affecting the constitution of the state and the character and  administration of its laws. Events of magnitude marked the struggles of  the Athenians with other powers. The development of art and learning was  carried to an unprecedented height, and the Age of Pericles is the most  illustrious in ancient history.    Pericles began his career by opposing the aristocratic party of Athens,  led by Cimon. In this policy he was aided by complications arising with  Sparta and Argos. Directing his attack particularly against the  Areopagus, he succeeded in greatly modifying the composition of that  body and diminishing its powers. The exile of Cimon, the strengthening  of Athens by new alliances, and the vigorous prosecution of wars against  Persia and Corinth combined to establish his supremacy, which was still  further confirmed by the building of the long walls connecting Athens  with the sea, and by the acquisition of neighboring territory.    A favorable convention was concluded with Persia, Athens resumed a state  of general peace, and Pericles found himself at the head of a powerful  empire formed out of a confederacy previously existing. The strength of  this empire was indeed soon impaired by ill-judged military movements,  against the advice of Pericles himself, but during six years of peace  which followed he succeeded in perfecting a state whose preeminence in  intellectual, political, and artistic development has had no rival.    In the later wars of Athens the renown of Pericles was still further  enhanced; but his chief glory arose from the architectural adornment of  the city, and especially from the building of the Parthenon and the  splendid decoration of the Acropolis; while his work of judicial reform  remains an added monument to his fame, and among the masters of  eloquence his orations preserve for him a foremost place.)      Pericles was of the tribe Acamantis, and of the township of Cholargos,  and was descended from the noblest families in Athens, on both his  father's and mother's side. His father, Xanthippus, defeated the Persian  generals at Mycale, while his mother, Agariste, was a descendant of  Clisthenes, who drove the sons of Pisistratus out of Athens, put an end  to their despotic rule, and established a new constitution admirably  calculated to reconcile all parties and save the country. She dreamed  that she had brought forth a lion, and a few days afterward was  delivered of Pericles. His body was symmetrical, but his head was long,  out of all proportion; for which reason, in nearly all his statues he is  represented wearing a helmet, as the sculptors did not wish, I suppose,  to reproach him with this blemish. The Attic poets called him  squill-head, and the comic poet Cratinus, in his play _Chirones_, says;      \"From Chronos old and faction      Is sprung a tyrant dread,    And all Olympus calls him      The man-compelling head.\"    And again in the play of _Nemesis_:      \"Come, hospitable Zeus, with lofty head.\"    Teleclides, too, speaks of him as sitting                             \"Bowed down             With a dreadful frown,    Because matters of state have gone wrong,             Until at last,             From his head so vast,    His ideas burst forth in a throng.\"    And Eupolis, in his play of _Demoi_, asking questions about each of the  great orators as they come up from the other world one after the other,  when at last Pericles ascends, says:      \"The great headpiece of those below.\"    Most writers tell us that his tutor in music was Damon, whose name they  say should be pronounced with the first syllable short. Aristotle,  however, says that he studied under Pythoclides. This Damon, it seems,  was a sophist of the highest order, who used the name of music to  conceal this accomplishment from the world, but who really trained  Pericles for his political contests just as a trainer prepares an  athlete for the games. However, Damon's use of music as a pretext did  not impose upon the Athenians, who banished him by ostracism, as a  busybody and lover of despotism.    Pericles greatly admired Anaxagoras, and became deeply interested in  grand speculations, which gave him a haughty spirit and a lofty style of  oratory far removed from vulgarity and low buffoonery, and also an  imperturbable gravity of countenance and a calmness of demeanor and  appearance which no incident could disturb as he was speaking, while the  tone of his voice never showed that he heeded any interruption. These  advantages greatly impressed the people. The poet Ion, however, says  that Pericles was overbearing and insolent in conversation, and that his  pride had in it a great deal of contempt for others, while he praises  Cimon's civil, sensible, and polished address. But we may disregard Ion  as a mere dramatic poet who always sees in great men something upon  which to exercise his satiric vein; whereas Zeno used to invite those  who called the haughtiness of Pericles a mere courting of popularity and  affectation of grandeur, to court popularity themselves in the same  fashion, since the acting of such a part might insensibly mould their  dispositions until they resembled that of their model.    Pericles when young greatly feared the people. He had a certain personal  likeness to the despot Pisistratus; and as his own voice was sweet, and  he was"]]]
