I do suspect that they  escaped, but if they did, I am not sorry, certainly.\"    \"I am not sorry, I _think_--but--\"    \"What is it?  What is there for one to be troubled about?\"    \"_If_ they did escape, then are we bound in duty to lay hands upon  them and deliver them again to their lord; for it is not seemly  that one of his quality should suffer a so insolent and high-handed  outrage from persons of their base degree.\"    There it was again.  He could see only one side of it.  He was  born so, educated so, his veins were full of ancestral blood that  was rotten with this sort of unconscious brutality, brought down  by inheritance from a long procession of hearts that had each done  its share toward poisoning the stream.  To imprison these men  without proof, and starve their kindred, was no harm, for they were  merely peasants and subject to the will and pleasure of their lord,  no matter what fearful form it might take; but for these men to  break out of unjust captivity was insult and outrage, and a thing  not to be countenanced by any conscientious person who knew his  duty to his sacred caste.    I worked more than half an hour before I got him to change the  subject--and even then an outside matter did it for me.  This was  a something which caught our eyes as we struck the summit of a  small hill--a red glow, a good way off.    \"That's a fire,\" said I.    Fires interested me considerably, because I was getting a good  deal of an insurance business started, and was also training some  horses and building some steam fire-engines, with an eye to a paid  fire department by and by.  The priests opposed both my fire and  life insurance, on the ground that it was an insolent attempt to  hinder the decrees of God; and if you pointed out that they did not  hinder the decrees in the least, but only modified the hard  consequences of them if you took out policies and had luck, they  retorted that that was gambling against the decrees of God, and was  just as bad.  So they managed to damage those industries more  or less, but I got even on my Accident business.  As a rule, a knight  is a lummox, and some times even a labrick, and hence open to pretty  poor arguments when they come glibly from a superstition-monger,  but even _he_ could see the practical side of a thing once in a while;  and so of late you couldn't clean up a tournament and pile the  result without finding one of my accident-tickets in every helmet.    We stood there awhile, in the thick darkness and stillness, looking  toward the red blur in the distance, and trying to make out the  meaning of a far-away murmur that rose and fell fitfully on the  night.  Sometimes it swelled up and for a moment seemed less  remote; but when we were hopefully expecting it to betray its cause  and nature, it dulled and sank again, carrying its mystery with it.  We started down the hill in its direction, and the winding road  plunged us at once into almost solid darkness--darkness that was  packed and crammed in between two tall forest walls.  We groped  along down for half a mile, perhaps, that murmur growing more and  more distinct all the time.  The coming storm threatening more and  more, with now and then a little shiver of wind, a faint show of  lightning, and dull grumblings of distant thunder.  I was in the  lead.  I ran against something--a soft heavy something which gave,  slightly, to the impulse of my weight; at the same moment the  lightning glared out, and within a foot of my face was the writhing  face of a man who was hanging from the limb of a tree!  That is,  it seemed to be writhing, but it was not.  It was a grewsome sight.  Straightway there was an ear-splitting explosion of thunder, and  the bottom of heaven fell out; the rain poured down in a deluge.  No matter, we must try to cut this man down, on the chance that  there might be life in him yet, mustn't we?  The lightning came  quick and sharp now, and the place was alternately noonday and  midnight.  One moment the man would be hanging before me in an  intense light, and the next he was blotted out again in the darkness.  I told the king we must cut him down.  The king at once objected.    \"If he hanged himself, he was willing to lose him property to  his lord; so let him be.  If others hanged him, belike they had  the right--let him hang.\"    \"But--\"    \"But me no buts, but even leave him as he is.  And for yet another  reason.  When the lightning cometh again--there, look abroad.\"    Two others hanging, within fifty yards of us!    \"It is not weather meet for doing useless courtesies unto dead folk.  They are past thanking you.  Come--it is unprofitable to tarry here.\"    There was reason in what he said, so we moved on.  Within the next  mile we counted six more hanging forms by the blaze of the lightning,  and altogether it was a grisly excursion.  That murmur was a murmur  no longer, it was a roar; a roar of men's voices.  A man came flying  by now, dimly through the darkness, and other men chasing him.  They disappeared.  Presently another case of the kind occurred,  and then another and another.  Then a sudden turn of the road  brought us in sight of that fire--it was a large manor-house, and  little or nothing was left of it--and everywhere men were flying  and other men raging after them in pursuit.    I warned the king that this was not a safe place for strangers.  We would better get away from the light, until matters should  improve.  We stepped back a little, and hid in the edge of the  wood.  From this hiding-place we saw both men and women hunted  by the mob.  The fearful work went on until nearly dawn.  Then,  the fire being out and the storm spent, the voices and flying  footsteps presently ceased, and darkness and stillness reigned again.    We ventured out, and hurried cautiously away; and although we were  worn out and sleepy, we kept on until we had put this place some  miles behind us.  Then we asked hospitality at the hut of a charcoal  burner, and got what was to be had.  A woman was up and about, but  the man was still asleep, on a straw shake-down, on the clay floor.  The woman seemed uneasy until I explained that we were travelers  and had lost our way and been wandering in the woods all night.  She became talkative, then, and asked if we had heard of the  terrible goings-on at the manor-house of Abblasoure.  Yes, we had  heard of them, but what we wanted now was rest and sleep.  The  king broke in:    \"Sell us the house and take yourselves away, for we be perilous  company, being late come from people that died of the Spotted Death.\"    It was good of him, but unnecessary.  One of the commonest decorations  of the nation was the waffle-iron face.  I had early noticed that  the woman and her husband were both so decorated.  She made us  entirely welcome, and had no fears; and plainly she was immensely  impressed by the king's proposition; for, of course, it was a good  deal of an event in her life to run across a person of the king's  humble appearance who was ready to buy a man's house for the sake  of a night's lodging.  It gave her a large respect for us, and she  strained the lean possibilities of her hovel to the utmost to make  us comfortable.    We slept till far into the afternoon, and then got up hungry enough to  make cotter fare quite palatable to the king, the more particularly  as it was scant in quantity.  And also in variety; it consisted  solely of onions, salt, and the national black bread made out of  horse-feed.  The woman told us about the affair of the evening  before.  At ten or eleven at night, when everybody was in bed,  the manor-house burst into flames.  The country-side swarmed to  the rescue, and the family were saved, with one exception, the  master.  He did not appear.  Everybody was frantic over this loss,  and two brave yeomen sacrificed their lives in ransacking the  burning house seeking that valuable personage.  But after a while  he was found--what was left of him--which was his corpse.  It was  in a copse three hundred yards away, bound, gagged, stabbed in a  dozen places.    Who had done this?  Suspicion fell upon a humble family in the  neighborhood who had been lately treated with peculiar harshness  by the baron; and from these people the suspicion easily extended  itself to their relatives and familiars.  A suspicion was enough;  my lord's liveried retainers proclaimed an instant crusade against  these people, and were promptly joined by the community in general.  The woman's husband had been active with the mob, and had not  returned home until nearly dawn.  He was gone now to find out  what the general result had been.  While we were still talking he  came back from his quest.  His report was revolting enough.  Eighteen  persons hanged or butchered, and two yeomen and thirteen prisoners  lost in the fire.    \"And how many prisoners were there altogether in the vaults?\"    \"Thirteen.\"    \"Then every one of them was lost?\"    \"Yes, all.\"    \"But the people arrived in time to save the family; how is it they  could save none of the prisoners?\"    The man looked puzzled, and said:    \"Would one unlock the vaults at such a time?  Marry, some would  have escaped.\"    \"Then you mean that nobody _did_ unlock them?\"    \"None went near them, either to lock or unlock.  It standeth to  reason that the bolts were fast; wherefore it was only needful  to establish a watch, so that if any broke the bonds he might not  escape, but be taken. None were taken.\"    \"Natheless, three did escape,\" said the king, \"and ye will do well  to publish it and set justice upon their track, for these murthered  the baron and fired the house.\"    I was just expecting he would come out with that.  For a moment  the man and his wife showed an eager interest in this news and  an impatience to go"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7248"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 7. (#5)"],[1,"the mind of this farmer.\"  I was in miserable apprehension;  I sat upon thorns.    \"--and further instancing the known truth that in the case of  animals, the young, which may be called the green fruit of the  creature, is the better, all confessing that when a goat is ripe,  his fur doth heat and sore engame his flesh, the which defect,  taken in connection with his several rancid habits, and fulsome  appetites, and godless attitudes of mind, and bilious quality  of morals--\"    They rose and went for him!  With a fierce shout, \"The one would  betray us, the other is mad!  Kill them!  Kill them!\" they flung  themselves upon us.  What joy flamed up in the king's eye!  He  might be lame in agriculture, but this kind of thing was just in  his line.  He had been fasting long, he was hungry for a fight.  He hit the blacksmith a crack under the jaw that lifted him clear  off his feet and stretched him flat on his back.  \"St. George for  Britain!\" and he downed the wheelwright.  The mason was big, but  I laid him out like nothing.  The three gathered themselves up and  came again; went down again; came again; and kept on repeating  this, with native British pluck, until they were battered to jelly,  reeling with exhaustion, and so blind that they couldn't tell us  from each other; and yet they kept right on, hammering away with  what might was left in them.  Hammering each other--for we stepped  aside and looked on while they rolled, and struggled, and gouged,  and pounded, and bit, with the strict and wordless attention to  business of so many bulldogs.  We looked on without apprehension,  for they were fast getting past ability to go for help against us,  and the arena was far enough from the public road to be safe  from intrusion.    Well, while they were gradually playing out, it suddenly occurred  to me to wonder what had become of Marco.  I looked around; he  was nowhere to be seen.  Oh, but this was ominous!  I pulled the  king's sleeve, and we glided away and rushed for the hut.  No Marco  there, no Phyllis there!  They had gone to the road for help, sure.  I told the king to give his heels wings, and I would explain later.  We made good time across the open ground, and as we darted into  the shelter of the wood I glanced back and saw a mob of excited  peasants swarm into view, with Marco and his wife at their head.  They were making a world of noise, but that couldn't hurt anybody;  the wood was dense, and as soon as we were well into its depths  we would take to a tree and let them whistle.  Ah, but then came  another sound--dogs!  Yes, that was quite another matter.  It  magnified our contract--we must find running water.    We tore along at a good gait, and soon left the sounds far behind  and modified to a murmur.  We struck a stream and darted into it.  We waded swiftly down it, in the dim forest light, for as much  as three hundred yards, and then came across an oak with a great  bough sticking out over the water.  We climbed up on this bough,  and began to work our way along it to the body of the tree; now  we began to hear those sounds more plainly; so the mob had struck  our trail.  For a while the sounds approached pretty fast.  And  then for another while they didn't.  No doubt the dogs had found  the place where we had entered the stream, and were now waltzing  up and down the shores trying to pick up the trail again.    When we were snugly lodged in the tree and curtained with foliage,  the king was satisfied, but I was doubtful.  I believed we could  crawl along a branch and get into the next tree, and I judged it  worth while to try.  We tried it, and made a success of it, though  the king slipped, at the junction, and came near failing to connect.  We got comfortable lodgment and satisfactory concealment among  the foliage, and then we had nothing to do but listen to the hunt.    Presently we heard it coming--and coming on the jump, too; yes,  and down both sides of the stream.  Louder--louder--next minute  it swelled swiftly up into a roar of shoutings, barkings, tramplings,  and swept by like a cyclone.    \"I was afraid that the overhanging branch would suggest something  to them,\" said I, \"but I don't mind the disappointment.  Come,  my liege, it were well that we make good use of our time.  We've  flanked them.  Dark is coming on, presently.  If we can cross the  stream and get a good start, and borrow a couple of horses from  somebody's pasture to use for a few hours, we shall be safe enough.\"    We started down, and got nearly to the lowest limb, when we seemed  to hear the hunt returning.  We stopped to listen.    \"Yes,\" said I, \"they're baffled, they've given it up, they're on  their way home.  We will climb back to our roost again, and let  them go by.\"    So we climbed back.  The king listened a moment and said:    \"They still search--I wit the sign.  We did best to abide.\"    He was right.  He knew more about hunting than I did.  The noise  approached steadily, but not with a rush.  The king said:    \"They reason that we were advantaged by no parlous start of them,  and being on foot are as yet no mighty way from where we took  the water.\"    \"Yes, sire, that is about it, I am afraid, though I was hoping  better things.\"    The noise drew nearer and nearer, and soon the van was drifting  under us, on both sides of the water.  A voice called a halt from  the other bank, and said:    \"An they were so minded, they could get to yon tree by this branch  that overhangs, and yet not touch ground.  Ye will do well to send  a man up it.\"    \"Marry, that we will do!\"    I was obliged to admire my cuteness in foreseeing this very thing  and swapping trees to beat it.  But, don't you know, there are  some things that can beat smartness and foresight?  Awkwardness  and stupidity can.  The best swordsman in the world doesn't need  to fear the second best swordsman in the world; no, the person  for him to be afraid of is some ignorant antagonist who has never  had a sword in his hand before; he doesn't do the thing he ought  to do, and so the expert isn't prepared for him; he does the thing  he ought not to do; and often it catches the expert out and ends  him on the spot.  Well, how could I, with all my gifts, make any  valuable preparation against a near-sighted, cross-eyed, pudding-headed  clown who would aim himself at the wrong tree and hit the right  one?  And that is what he did.  He went for the wrong tree, which  was, of course, the right one by mistake, and up he started.    Matters were serious now.  We remained still, and awaited developments.  The peasant toiled his difficult way up.  The king raised himself  up and stood; he made a leg ready, and when the comer's head  arrived in reach of it there was a dull thud, and down went the man  floundering to the ground.  There was a wild outbreak of anger  below, and the mob swarmed in from all around, and there we were  treed, and prisoners.  Another man started up; the bridging bough  was detected, and a volunteer started up the tree that furnished  the bridge.  The king ordered me to play Horatius and keep the  bridge.  For a while the enemy came thick and fast; but no matter,  the head man of each procession always got a buffet that dislodged  him as soon as he came in reach.  The king's spirits rose, his joy  was limitless.  He said that if nothing occurred to mar the prospect  we should have a beautiful night, for on this line of tactics we  could hold the tree against the whole country-side.    However, the mob soon came to that conclusion themselves; wherefore  they called off the assault and began to debate other plans.  They had no weapons, but there were plenty of stones, and stones  might answer.  We had no objections.  A stone might possibly  penetrate to us once in a while, but it wasn't very likely; we were  well protected by boughs and foliage, and were not visible from  any good aiming point.  If they would but waste half an hour in  stone-throwing, the dark would come to our help.  We were feeling  very well satisfied.  We could smile; almost laugh.    But we didn't; which was just as well, for we should have been  interrupted.  Before the stones had been raging through the leaves  and bouncing from the boughs fifteen minutes, we began to notice  a smell.  A couple of sniffs of it was enough of an explanation  --it was smoke!  Our game was up at last.  We recognized that.  When  smoke invites you, you have to come.  They raised their pile of  dry brush and damp weeds higher and higher, and when they saw  the thick cloud begin to roll up and smother the tree, they broke  out in a storm of joy-clamors.  I got enough breath to say:    \"Proceed, my liege; after you is manners.\"    The king gasped:    \"Follow me down, and then back thyself against one side of the  trunk, and leave me the other.  Then will we fight.  Let each pile  his dead according to his own fashion and taste.\"    Then he descended, barking and coughing, and I followed.  I struck  the ground an instant after him; we sprang to our appointed places,  and began to give and take with all our might.  The powwow and  racket were prodigious; it was a tempest of riot and confusion and  thick-falling blows.  Suddenly some horsemen tore into the midst  of the crowd, and a voice shouted:    \"Hold--or ye are dead men!\"    How good it sounded!  The owner of the voice bore all the marks of  a gentleman: picturesque and costly raiment, the aspect of command,  a hard countenance, with complexion and features marred by dissipation.  The mob fell humbly back, like so many spaniels.  The gentleman  inspected us critically, then said sharply to the peasants:    \"What are ye doing to these people?\"    \"They be madmen, worshipful sir, that have come wandering we know  not whence, and--\"    \"Ye know not whence?  Do ye pretend ye know them not?\"    \"Most honored sir, we speak but the truth.  They are strangers  and unknown to any in this region; and they be the most violent"]]]
