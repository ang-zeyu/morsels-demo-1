He would sit beside the sick-bed  of a servant the night through, but growl at the demands of his near  relatives--and it is not unlikely that he had good reason.    At last he withdrew himself from all human society but that of little  children, whom he cared to speak with and to please. He would have  naught to do with men of genius like himself; and when he fell from a  scaffolding and injured himself, the physician had to force his way  through a barred window, in order to get into the sick man's presence  to serve him.    An illustration of his determined solitude is given in the \"Young  People's Story of Art:\"    \"There had long been lying idle in Florence an immense block of  marble. One hundred years before a sculptor had tried to carve  something from it, but had failed. This was now given to Michael  Angelo. He was to be paid twelve dollars a month, and to be allowed  two years in which to carve a statue. He made his design in wax; and  then built a tower around the block, so that he might work inside  without being seen.\"    Everything Angelo undertook bore the marks of gigantic  enterprise. Although he never succeeded in making the tomb of Julius  II. the central piece in his forest of statues, the undertaking was  marvellous enough. His original plan was to make the tomb three  stories high and to ornament it with forty statues, and if St. Peter's  Church was large enough to hold it, the work was to be placed therein;  but if not, a church was to be built specially to hold the tomb. When  at last, in spite of his difficulties with workmen and shipowners, the  marbles were deposited in the great square before St. Peter's, they  filled the whole place; and the pope, wishing to watch the progress of  the work and not himself to be observed, had a covered way built from  the Vatican to the workshop of Angelo in the square, by which he might  come and go as he chose, while an order was issued that the sculptor  was to be admitted at all times to the Vatican. No sooner was this  arrangement completed than Angelo's enemies frightened the pope by  telling him there was danger in making his tomb before his death; and  with these superstitions haunting him Julius II. stopped the work,  leaving Angelo without the means to pay for his marbles. With the  doors of the Vatican closed to him, Angelo withdrew, post haste to  Florence--and who can blame him? Nevertheless, the work was resumed  after infinite trouble on the pope's part. He had to send again and  again for Angelo and after forty years, the work was finished. There  the sequel of the sculptor's forty-years war with self and the world  stands to-day in \"Moses,\" the wonderful, commanding central figure  which seems to reflect all the fierce power which Angelo had to keep  in check during a life-time.    The command of Julius that he should paint the ceiling of the Sistine  Chapel aroused all his fierce resistance. He did it under protest, all  the while accusing those about him of having designs upon his life.    \"I am not a painter, but a sculptor,\" he said.    \"Such a man as thou is everything that he wishes to be,\" the pope  replied.    \"But this is an affair of Raphael. Give him this room to paint and let  me carve a mountain!\" But no, he must paint the ceiling; but to render  it easier for him the pope told him he might fill in the spaces with  saints, and charge a certain amount for each. This Angelo, who was  first of all an artist, refused to do. He would do the work rightly or  not at all. So he made his own plans and cut himself a cardboard  helmet, into the front of which he thrust a candle, as if it were a  Davy lamp, and he lay upon his back to work day and night at the hated  task. During those months he was compelled to look up so continually,  that never afterward was he able to look down without difficulty. When  he had finished the work Julius had some criticisms to make.    \"Those dresses on your saints are such poor things,\" he said. \"Not  rich enough--such very poor things!\"    \"Well, they were poor things,\" was Angelo's answer. \"The saints did  not wear golden ornaments, nor gold on their garments.\"    After Julius II. and Leo X. came Pope Paul III., and he, like the  other two, determined to have Angelo for his workman. Indeed all his  life, Michael Angelo's gifts were commanded by the Church of Rome. It  was for Paul III. he painted the \"Last Judgment.\" His former work upon  the Sistine Chapel had been the story of the creation. All his work  was of a mighty and allegorical nature; tremendous shoulders, mighty  limbs, herculean muscles that seemed fit to support the  universe. These allegories are made of hundreds of figures. To-day  they are still there, though dimmed by the smoke of centuries of  incense, and dismembered by the cracking of plaster and disintegration  of materials.    Angelo's methods of work, as well as their results, were  oppressive. In his youth, while trying to perfect himself in his study  of the human form, he drew or modelled, from nude corpses. He had  these conveyed by stealth from the hospital into the convent of Santo  Spirito, where he had a cell and there he worked, alone.    He was concentrated, mentally and emotionally, upon himself. The only  remark he made after the blow from Torregiano was, \"You will be  remembered only as the man who broke my nose!\" This proved nearly  true, since Torregiano was banished, and murdered by the Spanish  Inquisition.    All sorts of anecdotes have floated through the centuries concerning  this man and his work. For example, he made a statue of a sleeping  cupid, which was buried in the ground for a time that it might assume  the appearance of age, and pass for an antique. Afterward it was sold  to the Cardinal San Giorgio for two hundred ducats, though Michael  Angelo received only thirty. Nevertheless, he died a rich man, after  having cared for a numerous family, while he himself lived like a man  without means. All the tranquillity he ever knew he enjoyed in his old  age.    It was characteristic of his perversity that he left his name upon  nothing that he made, with one exception. Vasari relates the story of  that exception:    \"The love and care which Michael Angelo had given to this group, 'In  Paradise,' were such that he there left his name--a thing he never did  again for any work--on the cincture which girdles the robe of Our  Lady; for it happened one day that Michael Angelo, entering the place  where it was erected, found a large assemblage of strangers from  Lombardy there, who were praising it highly; one of them asking who  had done it, was told, 'our Hunchback of Milan'; hearing which Michael  Angelo remained silent, although surprised that his work should be  attributed to another. But one night he repaired to St. Peter's with a  light and his chisels, to engrave his name on the figure, which seems  to breathe a spirit as perfect as her form and countenance.\"    If his youth had been given to sculpture, his maturity to the painting  of wondrous frescoes, so his old age was devoted to architecture, and  as architect he rebuilt the decaying St. Peter's. In this work he felt  that he partly realised his ideal. Sculpture meant more to him, \"did  more for the glory of God,\" than any other form of art. When he had  finished his work on St. Peter's, he is said to have looked upon it  and exclaimed: \"I have hung the Pantheon in the air!\"    This colossal genius died in Rome, and was carried by the light of  torches from that city back to his better loved Florence, where he was  buried. His tomb was made in the Santa Croce, and upon it are three  female figures representing Michael Angelo's three wonderful arts:  Architecture, sculpture and painting. No artist was greater than he.    His will committed \"his soul to God, his body to the earth, and his  property to his nearest relatives.\"      PLATE--DANIEL    This wonderful painting is a part of the decoration of the Sistine  Chapel in Rome. The picture of the prophet tells so much in itself,  that a description seems absurd. It is enough to call attention to the  powerful muscles in the arm, the fall of the hand, and then to speak  of the main characteristics of the artist's pictures.    It is extraordinary that there is no blade of grass to be found in any  painting by Michael Angelo. He loved to paint but one thing, and that  was the naked man, the powerful muscles, or the twisted limbs of those  in great agony. He loved only to work upon vast spaces of ceiling or  wall. Look at this picture of Daniel and see how like sculpture the  pose and modelling appear to be. First of all, Michael Angelo was a  sculptor, and most of the painting which fate forced him to do has the  characteristics of sculpture.    One critic has remarked that he loves to think of this strange man  sitting before the marble quarry of Pietra Santa and thinking upon all  the beings hidden in the cliff--beings which he should fashion from  the marble.    It was said that in Michael Angelo's hands the Holy Family became a  race of Titans, and where others would have put plants or foliage,  Angelo placed men and naked limbs to fill the space. When his subject  made some sort of herbage necessary, he invented a kind of mediaeval  fern in place of grass and familiar leaves. Everything appears brazen  and hard and mighty, suggestive of Angelo's own throbbing spirit and  maddened soul. Most of his work, when illustrated, must be shown not  as a whole but in sections, but one can best mention them as entire  picture themes. On the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel are nine frescoes  describing \"The Creation of The World,\" \"The Fall of Man\" and \"The  Deluge.\" \"The Last Judgment\" occupies the entire altar wall in the  same chapel of the Vatican. \"The Holy Family\" is in the Uffizi  Gallery, Florence.          III    ARNOLD BOeCKLIN        (Pronounced Bek'-lin)    _Modern German School (Duesseldorf)_    1827-1901    This splendid artist is so "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6933"],[0,"France and England in North America, Part II: The Jesuits in North America in (#5)"],[1,"arrow heads, and bone fish-hooks, were fast giving place to  the iron of the French; but they had not laid aside their shields of raw  bison-hide, or of wood overlaid with plaited and twisted thongs of skin.  They still used, too, their primitive breastplates and greaves of twigs  interwoven with cordage. [12] The masterpiece of Huron handiwork,  however, was the birch canoe, in the construction of which the  Algonquins were no less skilful. The Iroquois, in the absence of the  birch, were forced to use the bark of the elm, which was greatly  inferior both in lightness and strength. Of pipes, than which nothing  was more important in their eyes, the Hurons made a great variety, some  of baked clay, others of various kinds of stone, carved by the men,  during their long periods of monotonous leisure, often with great skill  and ingenuity. But their most mysterious fabric was wampum. This was at  once their currency, their ornament, their pen, ink, and parchment; and  its use was by no means confined to tribes of the Iroquois stock. It  consisted of elongated beads, white and purple, made from the inner part  of certain shells. It is not easy to conceive how, with their rude  implements, the Indians contrived to shape and perforate this  intractable material. The art soon fell into disuse, however; for wampum  better than their own was brought them by the traders, besides abundant  imitations in glass and porcelain. Strung into necklaces, or wrought  into collars, belts, and bracelets, it was the favorite decoration of  the Indian girls at festivals and dances. It served also a graver  purpose. No compact, no speech, or clause of a speech, to the  representative of another nation, had any force, unless confirmed by the  delivery of a string or belt of wampum. [13] The belts, on occasions of  importance, were wrought into significant devices, suggestive of the  substance of the compact or speech, and designed as aids to memory. To  one or more old men of the nation was assigned the honorable, but very  onerous, charge of keepers of the wampum,--in other words, of the  national records; and it was for them to remember and interpret the  meaning of the belts. The figures on wampum-belts were, for the most  part, simply mnemonic. So also were those carved on wooden tablets, or  painted on bark and skin, to preserve in memory the songs of war,  hunting, or magic. [14] The Hurons had, however, in common with other  tribes, a system of rude pictures and arbitrary signs, by which they  could convey to each other, with tolerable precision, information  touching the ordinary subjects of Indian interest.    [12] Some of the northern tribes of California, at the present day, wear  a sort of breastplate \"composed of thin parallel battens of very tough  wood, woven together with a small cord.\"  [13] Beaver-skins and other valuable furs were sometimes, on such  occasions, used as a substitute.  [14] Engravings of many specimens of these figured songs are given in  the voluminous reports on the condition of the Indians, published by  Government, under the editorship of Mr. Schoolcraft. The specimens are  chiefly Algonquin.    Their dress was chiefly of skins, cured with smoke after the well-known  Indian mode. That of the women, according to the Jesuits, was more  modest than that \"of our most pious ladies of France.\" The young girls  on festal occasions must be excepted from this commendation, as they  wore merely a kilt from the waist to the knee, besides the wampum  decorations of the breast and arms. Their long black hair, gathered  behind the neck, was decorated with disks of native copper, or gay  pendants made in France, and now occasionally unearthed in numbers from  their graves. The men, in summer, were nearly naked,--those of a kindred  tribe wholly so, with the sole exception of their moccasins. In winter  they were clad in tunics and leggins of skin, and at all seasons, on  occasions of ceremony, were wrapped from head to foot in robes of beaver  or otter furs, sometimes of the greatest value. On the inner side, these  robes were decorated with painted figures and devices, or embroidered  with the dyed quills of the Canada hedgehog. In this art of embroidery,  however, the Hurons were equalled or surpassed by some of the Algonquin  tribes. They wore their hair after a variety of grotesque and startling  fashions. With some, it was loose on one side, and tight braided on the  other; with others, close shaved, leaving one or more long and cherished  locks; while, with others again, it bristled in a ridge across the  crown, like the back of a hyena. [15] When in full dress, they were  painted with ochre, white clay, soot, and the red juice of certain  berries. They practised tattooing, sometimes covering the whole body  with indelible devices. [16] When of such extent, the process was very  severe; and though no murmur escaped the sufferer, he sometimes died  from its effects.    [15] See Le Jeune, Relation, 1633, 35.--\"Quelles hures!\" exclaimed some  astonished Frenchman. Hence the name, Hurons.  [16] Bressani, Relation AbrÃ©gÃ©e, 72.--Champlain has a picture of a  warrior thus tattooed.    Female life among the Hurons had no bright side. It was a youth of  license, an age of drudgery. Despite an organization which, while it  perhaps made them less sensible of pain, certainly made them less  susceptible of passion, than the higher races of men, the Hurons were  notoriously dissolute, far exceeding in this respect the wandering and  starving Algonquins. [17] Marriage existed among them, and polygamy was  exceptional; but divorce took place at the will or caprice of either  party. A practice also prevailed of temporary or experimental marriage,  lasting a day, a week, or more. The seal of the compact was merely the  acceptance of a gift of wampum made by the suitor to the object of his  desire or his whim. These gifts were never returned on the dissolution  of the connection; and as an attractive and enterprising damsel might,  and often did, make twenty such marriages before her final  establishment, she thus collected a wealth of wampum with which to adorn  herself for the village dances. [18] This provisional matrimony was no  bar to a license boundless and apparently universal, unattended with  loss of reputation on either side. Every instinct of native delicacy  quickly vanished under the influence of Huron domestic life; eight or  ten families, and often more, crowded into one undivided house, where  privacy was impossible, and where strangers were free to enter at all  hours of the day or night.    [17] Among the Iroquois there were more favorable features in the  condition of women. The matrons had often a considerable influence on  the decisions of the councils. Lafitau, whose book appeared in 1724,  says that the nation was corrupt in his time, but that this was a  degeneracy from their ancient manners. La Potherie and Charlevoix make a  similar statement. Megapolensis, however, in 1644, says that they were  then exceedingly debauched; and Greenhalgh, in 1677, gives ample  evidence of a shameless license. One of their most earnest advocates of  the present day admits that the passion of love among them had no other  than an animal existence. (Morgan, League of the Iroquois, 322.) There  is clear proof that the tribes of the South were equally corrupt. (See  Lawson, Carolina, 34, and other early writers.) On the other hand,  chastity in women was recognized as a virtue by many tribes. This was  peculiarly the case among the Algonquins of GaspÃ©, where a lapse in this  regard was counted a disgrace. (See Le Clerc, Nouvelle Relation de la  GaspÃ©sie, 417, where a contrast is drawn between the modesty of the  girls of this region and the open prostitution practised among those of  other tribes.) Among the Sioux, adultery on the part of a woman is  punished by mutilation.    The remarkable forbearance observed by Eastern and Northern tribes  towards female captives was probably the result of a superstition.  Notwithstanding the prevailing license, the Iroquois and other tribes  had among themselves certain conventional rules which excited the  admiration of the Jesuit celibates. Some of these had a superstitious  origin; others were in accordance with the iron requirements of their  savage etiquette. To make the Indian a hero of romance is mere nonsense.  [18] \"Il s'en trouue telle qui passe ainsi sa ieunesse, qui aura en plus  de vingt maris, lesquels vingt maris ne sont pas seuls en la jouyssance  de la beste, quelques mariez qu'ils soient: car la nuict venuÃ«, les  ieunes femmes courent d'une cabane en une autre, come font les ieunes  hommes de leur costÃ©, qui en prennent par ou bon leur semble, toutesfois  sans violence aucune, et n'en reÃ§oiuent aucune infamie, ny injure, la  coustume du pays estant telle.\"--Champlain (1627), 90. Compare Sagard,  Voyage des Hurons, 176. Both were personal observers.    The ceremony, even of the most serious marriage, consisted merely in the  bride's bringing a dish of boiled maize to the bridegroom, together with  an armful of fuel. There was often a feast of the relatives, or of the  whole village.    Once a mother, and married with a reasonable permanency, the Huron woman  from a wanton became a drudge. In March and April she gathered the  year's supply of firewood. Then came sowing, tilling, and harvesting,  smoking fish, dressing skins, making cordage and clothing, preparing  food. On the march it was she who bore the burden; for, in the words of  Champlain, \"their women were their mules.\" The natural effect followed.  In every Huron town were shrivelled hags, hideous and despised, who, in  vindictiveness, ferocity, and cruelty, far exceeded the men.    To the men fell the task of building the houses, and making weapons,  pipes, and canoes. For the rest, their home-life was a life of leisure  and amusement. The summer and autumn were their seasons of serious"]]]
