For over    40 years, the Stalinist-type economy operated on the principle of central    planning and state ownership of the means of production. Fitful economic    reforms begun during 1991, including the liberalization of prices and trade,    the privatization of shops and transport, and land reform, were crippled by    widespread civil disorder. Following its overwhelming victory in the 22    March 1992 elections, the new Democratic government announced a program of    shock therapy to stabilize the economy and establish a market economy. In an    effort to expand international ties, Tirane has reestablished diplomatic    relations with the major republics of the former Soviet Union and the US and    has joined the IMF and the World Bank. The Albanians have also passed    legislation allowing foreign investment, but not foreign ownership of real    estate. Albania possesses considerable mineral resources and, until 1990,    was largely self-sufficient in food; however, the breakup of cooperative    farms in 1991 and general economic decline forced Albania to rely on foreign    aid to maintain adequate supplies. In 1992 the government tightened    budgetary contols leading to another drop in domestic output. The    agricultural sector is steadily gaining from the privatization process. Low    domestic output is supplemented by remittances from the 200,000 Albanians    working abroad.  National product:    GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $2.5 billion (1992 est.)

Such will I show myself to you all.--\"What, exempt from sickness also:  from age, from death?\"--Nay, but accepting sickness, accepting death as  becomes a God!          LXII    No labour, according to Diogenes, is good but that which aims at  producing courage and strength of soul rather than of body.          LXIII    A guide, on finding a man who has lost his way, brings him back to the  right path--he does not mock and jeer at him and then take himself off.  You also must show the unlearned man the truth, and you will see that he  will follow. But so long as you do not show it him, you should not mock,  but rather feel your own incapacity.          LXIV    It was the first and most striking characteristic of Socrates never to  become heated in discourse, never to utter an injurious or insulting  word--on the contrary, he persistently bore insult from others and thus  put an end to the fray. If you care to know the extent of his power  in this direction, read Xenophon's Banquet, and you will see how many  quarrels he put an end to. This is why the Poets are right in so highly  commending this faculty:--    Quickly and wisely withal even bitter feuds would he settle.    Nevertheless the practice is not very safe at present, especially in  Rome. One who adopts it, I need not say, ought not to carry it out in an  obscure corner, but boldly accost, if occasion serve, some personage of  rank or wealth.    \"Can you tell me, sir, to whose care you entrust your horses?\"    \"I can.\"    \"Is it to the first comer, who knows nothing about them?\"    \"Certainly not.\"    \"Well, what of the man who takes care of your gold, your silver or your  raiment?\"    \"He must be experienced also.\"    \"And your body--have you ever considered about entrusting it to any  one's care?\"    \"Of course I have.\"    \"And no doubt to a person of experience as a trainer, a physician?\"    \"Surely.\"    \"And these things the best you possess, or have you anything more  precious?\"    \"What can you mean?\"    \"I mean that which employs these; which weights all things; which takes  counsel and resolve.\"    \"Oh, you mean the soul.\"    \"You take me rightly; I do mean the soul. By Heaven, I hold that far  more precious than all else I possess. Can you show me then what care  you bestow on a soul? For it can scarcely be thought that a man of your  wisdom and consideration in the city would suffer your most precious  possession to go to ruin through carelessness and neglect.\"    \"Certainly not.\"    \"Well, do you take care of it yourself? Did any one teach you the right  method, or did you discover it yourself?\"    Now here comes in the danger: first, that the great man may answer,  \"Why, what is that to you, my good fellow? are you my master?\" And then,  if you persist in troubling him, may raise his hand to strike you. It is  a practice of which I was myself a warm admirer until such experiences  as these befell me.          LXV    When a youth was giving himself airs in the Theatre and saying, \"I am  wise, for I have conversed with many wise men,\" Epictetus replied, \"I  too have conversed with many rich men, yet I am not rich!\"          LXVI    We see that a carpenter becomes a carpenter by learning certain things:  that a pilot, by learning certain things, becomes a pilot. Possibly also  in the present case the mere desire to be wise and good is not enough.  It is necessary to learn certain things. This is then the object of our  search. The Philosophers would have us first learn that there is a God,  and that His Providence directs the Universe; further, that to hide  from Him not only one's acts but even one's thoughts and intentions is  impossible; secondly, what the nature of God is. Whatever that nature is  discovered to be, the man who would please and obey Him must strive with  all his might to be made like unto him. If the Divine is faithful, he  also must be faithful; if free, he also must be free; if beneficent, he  also must be beneficent; if magnanimous, he also must be magnanimous.  Thus as an imitator of God must he follow Him in every deed and word.          LXVII    If I show you, that you lack just what is most important and necessary  to happiness, that hitherto your attention has been bestowed on  everything rather than that which claims it most; and, to crown all,  that you know neither what God nor Man is--neither what Good or Evil is:  why, that you are ignorant of everything else, perhaps you may bear to  be told; but to hear that you know nothing of yourself, how could you  submit to that? How could you stand your ground and suffer that to be  proved? Clearly not at all. You instantly turn away in wrath. Yet what  harm have I done to you? Unless indeed the mirror harms the ill-favoured  man by showing him to himself just as he is; unless the physician can  be thought to insult his patient, when he tells him:--\"Friend, do you  suppose there is nothing wrong with you? why, you have a fever. Eat  nothing to-day, and drink only water.\" Yet no one says, \"What an  insufferable insult!\" Whereas if you say to a man, \"Your desires are  inflamed, your instincts of rejection are weak and low, your aims  are inconsistent, your impulses are not in harmony with Nature, your  opinions are rash and false,\" he forthwith goes away and complains that  you have insulted him.          LXVIII    Our way of life resembles a fair. The flocks and herds are passing along  to be sold, and the greater part of the crowd to buy and sell. But there  are some few who come only to look at the fair, to inquire how and why  it is being held, upon what authority and with what object. So too, in  this great Fair of life, some, like the cattle, trouble themselves about  nothing but the fodder. Know all of you, who are busied about land,  slaves and public posts, that these are nothing but fodder! Some few  there are attending the Fair, who love to contemplate what the world  is, what He that administers it. Can there be no Administrator? is it  possible, that while neither city nor household could endure even a  moment without one to administer and see to its welfare, this Fabric, so  fair, so vast, should be administered in order so harmonious, without a  purpose and by blind chance? There is therefore an Administrator. What  is His nature and how does He administer? And who are we that are  His children and what work were we born to perform? Have we any close  connection or relation with Him or not?    Such are the impressions of the few of whom I speak. And further, they  apply themselves solely to considering and examining the great assembly  before they depart. Well, they are derided by the multitude. So are the  lookers-on by the traders: aye, and if the beasts had any sense, they  would deride those who thought much of anything but fodder!          LXIX    I think I know now what I never knew before--the meaning of the common  saying, A fool you can neither bend nor break. Pray heaven I may never  have a wise fool for my friend! There is nothing more intractable.--\"My  resolve is fixed!\"--Why so madman say too; but the more firmly they  believe in their delusions, the more they stand in need of treatment.          LXX    --\"O! when shall I see Athens and its Acropolis again?\"--Miserable man!  art thou not contented with the daily sights that meet thine eyes? canst  thou behold aught greater or nobler than the Sun, Moon, and Stars;  than the outspread Earth and Sea? If indeed thou apprehendest Him who  administers the universe, if thou bearest Him about within thee, canst  thou still hanker after mere fragments of stone and fine rock? When thou  art about to bid farewell to the Sun and Moon itself, wilt thou sit down  and cry like a child? Why, what didst thou hear, what didst thou learn?  why didst thou write thyself down a philosopher, when thou mightest have  written what was the fact, namely, \"I have made one or two Compendiums,  I have read some works of Chrysippus, and I have not even touched the  hem of Philosophy's robe!\"          LXXI    Friend, lay hold with a desperate grasp, ere it is too late, on Freedom,  on Tranquility, on Greatness of soul! Lift up thy head, as one escaped  from slavery; dare to look up to God, and say:--\"Deal with me henceforth  as Thou wilt; Thou and I are of one mind. I am Thine: I refuse nothing  that seeeth good to Thee; lead on whither Thou wilt; clothe me in what  garb Thou pleasest; wilt Thou have me a ruler or a subject--at home or  in exile--poor or rich? All these things will I justify unto men for  Thee. I will show the true nature of each. . . .\"    Who would Hercules have been had he loitered at home? no Hercules, but  Eurystheus. And in his wanderings through the world how many friends and  comrades did he find? but nothing dearer to him than God. Wherefore he  was believed to be God's son, as indeed he was. So then in obedience to  Him, he went about delivering the earth from injustice and lawlessness.    But thou art not Hercules, thou sayest, and canst not deliver others  from their iniquity--not even Theseus, to deliver the soil of Attica  from its monsters? Purge away thine own, cast forth thence--from thine  own mind, not robbers and monsters, but Fear, Desire, Envy, Malignity,  Avarice, Effeminacy, Intemperance. And these may not be cast out, except  by looking to God alone, by fixing thy affections on Him only, and by  consecrating thyself to His commands. If thou choosest aught else, with  sighs and groans thou wilt be forced to follow a Might greater than  thine own, ever seeking Tranquillity without, and never able to attain  unto her. For thou seekest her where she is not to be found; and where  she is, there thou seekest her not!          LXXII    If a man would pursue Philosophy, his first"]]]
