[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8112"],[0,"Houses and House-Life of the American Aborigines (#5)"],[1," is a brotherhood, as the term imports, and a  natural growth from the organization into gentes. It is an organic  union or association of two or more gentes of the same tribe for  certain common objects. These gentes were usually such as had been  formed by the segmentation of an original gens.    The phratry existed in a large number of the tribes of the American  aborigines, where it is seen to arise by natural growth, and to  stand as the second member of the organic series, as among the  Grecian and Latin tribes. It did not possess original governmental  functions, as the gens tribe and confederacy possessed them but it  was endowed with certain useful powers in the social system, from  the necessity for some organization larger than a gens and smaller  than a tribe and especially when the tribe was large. The same  institution in essential features and in character, it presents the  organization in its archaic form and with its archaic functions. A  knowledge of the Indian phratry is necessary to an intelligent  understanding of the Grecian and the Roman.    The eight gentes of the Seneca Iroquois tribe were reintegrated in  two phratries as follows:                      First Phratry    Gentes--1 Bear 2 Wolf 3 Beaver 4 Turtle                  Second Phratry    Gentes--5 Deer 6 Snipe 7 Heron 8 Hawk      Each phratry (De da non da a yoh) is a brotherhood as this term also  imports. The gentes in the same phratry are brother gentes to each  other and cousin gentes to those of the other phratry. They are  equal in grade, character, and privileges. It is a common practice  of the Senecas to call the gentes of their own phratry brother  gentes and those of the other phratry their cousin gentes, when they  mention them in their relation to the phratries. Originally marriage  was not allowed between the members of the same phratry but the  members of either could marry into any gens of the other. This  prohibition tends to show that the gentes of each phratry were  subdivisions of an original gens and therefore the prohibition  against marrying into a person's own gens had followed to its  subdivisions. This restriction however was long since removed except  with respect to the gens of the individual. A tradition of the  Senecas affirms that the Bear and the Deer were the original gentes,  of which the others were subdivisions. It is thus seen that the  phratry had a natural foundation in the kinship of the gentes of  which it was composed. After their subdivision from increase of  numbers there was a natural tendency to their reunion in a higher  organization for objects common to them all. The same gentes are not  constant in a phratry indefinitely, as appears from the composition  of the phratries in the remaining Iroquois tribes. Transfers of  particular gentes from one phratry to the other must have occurred  when the equilibrium in their respective numbers was disturbed. It  is important to know the simple manner in which this organization  springs up, and the facility with which it is managed as a part of  the social system of ancient society. With the increase of numbers  in a gens, followed by local separation of its members, segmentation  occurred, and the seceding portion adopted a new gentile name. But a  tradition of their former unity would remain and become the basis of  their reorganization in a phratry.    From the differences in the composition of the phratries in the  several tribes it seems probable that the phratries are modified in  their gentes at intervals of time to meet changes of condition. Some  gentes prosper and increase in numbers, while others, through  calamities, decline, and others become extinct; so that transfers of  gentes from one phratry to another were found necessary to preserve  some degree of equality in the number of phrators in each. The  phratric organization has existed among the Iroquois from time  immemorial. It is probably older than the confederacy which was  established more than four centuries ago. The amount of difference  in their composition, as to the gentes they contain, represents the  vicissitudes through which each tribe has passed in the interval. In  any view of the matter it is small, tending to illustrate the  permanence of the phratry as well as the gens.    The Iroquois tribes had a total of thirty-eight gentes, and in four  of the tribes a total of eight phratries.    The phratry among the Iroquois was partly for social and partly for  religious objects. Its functions and uses can be best shown by  practical illustrations. We begin with the lowest, with games, which  were of common occurrence at tribal and confederate councils. In the  ball game, for example, among the Senecas, they play by phratries,  one against the other, and they bet against each other upon the  result of the game. Each phratry puts forward its best players,  usually from six to ten on a side, and the members of each phratry  assemble together, but upon opposite sides of the field in which the  game is played. Before it commences, articles of personal property  are hazarded upon the result by members of the opposite phratries.  These are deposited with keepers to abide the event. The game is  played with spirit and enthusiasm, and is an exciting spectacle. The  members of each phratry, from their opposite stations, watch the  game with eagerness, and cheer their respective players at every  successful turn of the game. [Footnote: League of the Iroquois, p.  294.]    Again, when a murder had been committed it was usual for the gens of  the murdered person to meet in council, and, after ascertaining the  facts, to take measures for avenging the deed. The gens of the  criminal also held a council, and endeavored to effect an adjustment  or condonation of the crime with the gens of the murdered person;  but it often happened that the gens of the criminal called upon the  other gentes of their phratry, when the slayer and the slain  belonged to opposite phratries, to unite with them to obtain a  condonation of the crime. In such a case the phratry held a council,  and then addressed itself to the other phratry, to which it sent a  delegation with a belt of white wampum asking for a council of the  phratry and for an adjustment of the crime. They offered reparation  to the family and gens of the murdered person in expressions of  regret and in presents of value. Negotiations were continued between  the two councils until an affirmative or a negative conclusion was  reached. The influence of a phratry composed of several gentes would  be greater than that of a single gens; and by calling into action  the opposite phratry the probability of a condonation would be  increased, especially if there were extenuating circumstances. We  may thus see how naturally the Grecian phratry, prior to civilization,  assumed the principal though not exclusive management of cases of  murder, and also of the purification of the murderer if he escaped  punishment, and after the institution of political society with what  propriety the phratry assumed the duty of prosecuting the murderer  in the courts of justice.    At the funerals of persons of recognized importance in the tribe the  phratric organization manifested itself in a conspicuous manner The  phrators of the decedent in a body were the mourners, and the  members of the opposite phratry conducted the ceremonies. At the  funeral of Handsome Lake (Ga-ne-o-di'-yo), one of the eight Seneca  sachems (which occurred some years ago), there was an assemblage of  sachems and chiefs to the number of twenty-seven, and a large  concourse of members of both phratries The customary address to the  dead body, and the other addresses before the removal of the body,  were made by members of the opposite phratry After the addresses  were concluded the body was borne to the grave by persons selected  from the last named phratry, followed, first, by the sachems and  chiefs, then by the family and gens of the decedent, next by his  remaining phrators, and last by the members of the opposite phratry  After the body had been deposited in the grave the sachems and  chiefs formed in a circle around it for the purpose of filling it  with earth. Each in turn, commencing with the senior in years, cast  in three shovelfuls, a typical number in their religious system, of  which the first had relation to the Great Spirit, the second to the  Sun, and the third to Mother Earth When the grave was filled the  senior sachem, by a figure of speech, deposited \"the horns\" of the  departed sachem, emblematic of his office, upon the top of the grave  over his head, there to remain until his successor was installed In  that subsequent ceremony \"the horns\" were said to be taken from the  grave of the deceased ruler and placed upon the head of his  successor The social and religious functions of the phratry, and its  naturalness in the organic system of ancient society, are rendered  apparent by this single usage.    The phratry was also directly concerned in the election of sachems  and chiefs of the several gentes, upon which they had a negative as  well as a confirmative vote After the gens of a deceased sachem had  elected his successor, or had elected a chief of the second grade,  it was necessary, as elsewhere stated, that their choice should be  accepted and confirmed by each phratry It was expected that the  gentes of the same phratry would confirm the choice almost as a  matter of course, but the opposite phratry also must acquiesce, and  from this source opposition sometimes appeared A council of each  phratry was held and pronounced upon the question of acceptance or  rejection. If the nomination made was accepted by both it became  complete, but if either refused it was thereby set aside and a new  election was made by the gens. When the choice made by the gens had  been accepted by the phratries it was still necessary, as before  stated, that the new sachem, or the new"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8115"],[0,"Authors of Greece (#5)"],[1,"Athena who gave him  power to resist; the river was checked by the Fire-God who dried up his  streams. The gods then plunged into strife, the sight whereof made Zeus  laugh in joy. Athena quickly routed Aphrodite and Hera Artemis. Apollo  deemed it worthless to fight Poseidon.        \"Thou wouldst not call me prudent were I to strive with thee for      cowering mortals, who like leaves sometimes are full of fire, then      again waste away spiritless. Let us make an end of our quarrel;      let men fight it out themselves.\"    Deserted by their protectors the Trojans broke before Achilles, who  nearly took the town.    Baulked a second time of his vengeance by Apollo, Achilles vowed he  would have punished the god had he the power. Hector had at last decided  to face his foe at the Scaean Gate. His father and his mother pleaded  with him in a frenzy of grief to enter the town, but the dread of  Polydamas' reproaches fixed his resolve. When Achilles came rushing  towards him, his heart failed; he ran three times round the walls of the  city. Meanwhile the gods held up the scales of doom; when his life sank  down to death Apollo left him for ever.    Athena then took the shape of Deiphobus, encouraging him to face  Achilles. Seeing unexpectedly a friend, he turned and stood his ground,  for she had already warned Achilles of her plot. Hector launched his  spear which sped true, but failed to penetrate the divine armour. When  he found no Deiphobus at his side to give him another weapon, he knew  his end had come. Drawing himself up for a final effort, he darted at  Achilles; the latter spied a gap in the armour he had once worn, through  which he smote Hector mortally. Lying in approaching death, the Trojan  begged that his body might be honoured with a burial, but Achilles swore  he should never have it, rather the dogs and carrion birds should devour  his flesh. Seeing their great foe dead the Greeks flocked around him,  not one passing by him without stabbing his body. Achilles bored through  his ankles and attached him to his car; then whipping up his horses,  he drove full speed to the camp, dragging Hector in disgrace over the  plain. This scene of pure savagery is succeeded by the laments of Priam,  Hecuba and Andromache over him whom Zeus allowed to be outraged in his  own land.    That night the shade of Patroclus visited Achilles, bidding him bury him  speedily that he might cross the gates of death; the dust of his ashes  was to be stored up in an urn and mixed with Achilles' own when his turn  came to die. After the funeral Achilles held games of great splendour in  which the leading athletes contended for the prizes he offered.    Yet nothing could make up for the loss of his friend. Every day he  dragged Hector's body round Patroclus' tomb, but Apollo in pity for the  dead man kept away corruption, maintaining the body in all its beauty of  manhood. At last on the twelfth day Apollo appealed to the gods to end  the barbarous outrage.        \"Hath not Hector offered to you many a sacrifice of bulls and      goats? Yet ye countenance the deeds of Achilles, who hath forsaken      all pity which doth harm to men and bringeth a blessing too. Many      another is like to lose a friend, but he will weep and let his      foe's body go, for the Fates have given men an heart to endure.      Good man though he be, let Achilles take heed lest he move us to      indignation by outraging in fury senseless clay.\"    Zeus sent to fetch Thetis whom he bade persuade her son to ransom the  body; meanwhile Iris went to Troy to tell Priam to take a ransom and  go to the ships without fear, for the convoy who should guide him would  save him from harm.    On hearing of Priam's resolve Hecuba tried to dissuade him, but the old  King would not be turned. That night he went forth alone; he was met in  the plain by Hermes, disguised as a servant of Achilles, who conducted  him to the hut where Hector lay. Slipping in unseen, Priam caught  Achilles' knees and kissed the dread hands that had slain his son.  In pity for the aged King Achilles remembered his own father, left as  defenceless as Priam. Calling out his servants he bade them wash the  corpse outside, lest Priam at the sight of it should upbraid him and  thus provoke him to slay him and offend against the commands of Zeus. As  they supped, Priam marvelled at the stature and beauty of Achilles and  Achilles wondered at Priam's reverend form and his words. While Achilles  slept, Hermes came to Priam to warn him of his danger if he were found  in the Greek host. Hastily harnessing the chariot, he led him back  safely to Troy, where the body was laid upon a bed in Hector's palace.    The laments which follow are of great beauty. Andromache bewailed her  widowhood, Hecuba her dearest son; Helen's lament is a masterpiece.        \"Hector, far the dearest to me of all my brethren, of a truth Paris      is my lord, who brought me hither--would I had died first. This is      the tenth year since I left my native land, yet have I never heard      from thee a word cruel or despiteful; rather, if any other chode me,      thy sister or a brother's wife or thy mother--though thy father is      gentle to me always as he were my own sire--thou didst restrain such      with words of persuasion and kindness and gentleness all thine own.      Wherefore I grieve for thee and for myself in anguish, for there is      no other friend in broad Troy kind and tender, but all shudder at me.\"    Then with many a tear they laid to his rest mighty Hector.    Such is the _Iliad_. To modern readers it very often seems a little  dull. Horace long ago pointed out that it is inevitable that a long  poem should flag; even Homer nods sometimes. Some of the episodes are  distinctly wearisome, for they are invented to give a place in this  national Epic to lesser heroes who could hardly be mentioned if Achilles  were always in the foreground. Achilles himself is not a pleasing  person; his character is wayward and violent; he is sometimes childish,  always liable to be carried away by a fit of pettishness and unable to  retain our real respect; further, a hero who is practically invulnerable  and yet dons divine armour to attack those who are no match for him when  he is without it falls below the ordinary \"sportsman's\" level. Nor can  we feel much reverence for many of the gods; Hera is odious, Athena  guilty of flat treachery, Zeus, liable to allow his good nature to  overcome his judgment--Apollo alone seems consistently noble. More, we  shall look in vain in the _Iliad_ for any sign of the pure battle-joy  which is so characteristic of northern Epic poetry; the Greek ideal  of bravery had nothing of the Berserker in it. Perhaps these are the  reasons why the sympathy of nearly all readers is with the Trojans, who  are numerically inferior, are aided by fewer and weaker gods and have  less mighty champions to defend them.    What then is left to admire in the _Iliad_? It is well to remember  that the poem is not the first but the last of a long series; its very  perfection of form and language makes it certain that it is the result  of a long literary tradition. As such, it has one or two remarkable  features. We shall not find in many other Epics that sense of wistful  sorrow for man's brief and uncertain life which is the finest breath  of all poetry that seeks to touch the human heart. The marks of rude or  crude workmanship which disfigure much Epic have nearly all disappeared  from the _Iliad_. The characterisation of many of the figures of the  poem is masterly, their very natures being hit off in a few lines--and  it is important to remember that it is not really the business of Epic  to attempt analysis of character at all except very briefly; the story  cannot be kept waiting. But the real Homeric power is displayed in  the famous scenes of pure and worthy pathos such as the parting of  Andromache from Hector and the laments over his body. Those who would  learn how to touch great depths of sorrow and remain dignified must see  how it has been treated in the _Iliad_.    A few vigorous lines hit off the plan of the _Odyssey_.        \"Sing, Muse, of the man of much wandering who travelled right far      after sacking sacred Troy, and saw the cities of many men and knew      their ways. Many a sorrow he suffered on the sea, trying to win a      return home for himself and his comrades; yet he could not for all      his longing, for they died like fools through their own blindness.\"    Odysseus, when the poem opens, was in Calypso's isle pitied of all  the gods save Poseidon. In a council Zeus gave his consent that Hermes  should go to Calypso, while Athena should descend to Ithaca to encourage  Odysseus' son Telemachus to seek out news of his father.    Taking the form of Mentes, Athena met Telemachus and informed him that  his father was not yet dead. Seeing the suitors who were wooing his  mother Penelope and eating up the house in riot, she advised him to  dismiss them and visit Nestor in Pylos. A lay sung by Phemius brought  Penelope from her chamber, who was astonished at the immediate change  which her son's speech showed had come upon him, transforming him to  manhood.    Next day Telemachus called an Assembly of the Ithacans; his appeal to  the suitors to leave him in peace provoked an insulting speech from  their ringleader Antinous who held Penelope to blame for their presence;  she had constantly eluded them, on one occasion promising to marry when  she had woven a shroud for Laertes her father-in-law; the work she did  by day she undid at night, till she was betrayed by a serving-woman.  Telemachus then asked the suitors for a ship to get news of his father.  When the assembly broke up, Athena appeared in answer to Telemachus'  prayer in the form of Mentor and pledged herself to go with him on his  travels. She prepared a ship and got together a crew, while Telemachus  bade his"]]]
