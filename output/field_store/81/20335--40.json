Do you charge us with wanting to stop the exploitation of  children by their parents?  To this crime we plead guilty.    But, you will say, we destroy the most hallowed of relations,  when we replace home education by social.    And your education!  Is not that also social, and determined by the  social conditions under which you educate, by the intervention,  direct or indirect, of society, by means of schools, etc.?  The  Communists have not invented the intervention of society in  education; they do but seek to alter the character of that  intervention, and to rescue education from the influence of the  ruling class.    The bourgeois clap-trap about the family and education, about  the hallowed co-relation of parent and child, becomes all the  more disgusting, the more, by the action of Modern Industry, all  family ties among the proletarians are torn asunder, and their  children transformed into simple articles of commerce and  instruments of labour.    But you Communists would introduce community of women, screams  the whole bourgeoisie in chorus.    The bourgeois sees in his wife a mere instrument of production.  He hears that the instruments of production are to be exploited  in common, and, naturally, can come to no other conclusion than  that the lot of being common to all will likewise fall to the  women.    He has not even a suspicion that the real point is to do away  with the status of women as mere instruments of production.    For the rest, nothing is more ridiculous than the  virtuous indignation of our bourgeois at the community of women  which, they pretend, is to be openly and officially established  by the Communists.  The Communists have no need to introduce  community of women; it has existed almost from time immemorial.    Our bourgeois, not content with having the wives and daughters  of their proletarians at their disposal, not to speak of common  prostitutes, take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other's  wives.    Bourgeois marriage is in reality a system of wives in common  and thus, at the most, what the Communists might possibly  be reproached with, is that they desire to introduce, in  substitution for a hypocritically concealed, an openly legalised  community of women. For the rest, it is self-evident that the  abolition of the present system of production must bring with it  the abolition of the community of women springing from that  system, i.e., of prostitution both public and private.    The Communists are further reproached with desiring to abolish  countries and nationality.    The working men have no country.  We cannot take from them what  they have not got.  Since the proletariat must first of all  acquire political supremacy, must rise to be the leading class of  the nation, must constitute itself the nation, it is, so far,  itself national, though not in the bourgeois sense of the word.    National differences and antagonisms between peoples are daily  more and more vanishing, owing to the development of the  bourgeoisie, to freedom of commerce, to the world-market, to  uniformity in the mode of production and in the conditions of  life corresponding thereto.    The supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still  faster. United action, of the leading civilised countries at  least, is one of the first conditions for the emancipation of  the proletariat.    In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another  is put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will  also be put an end to.  In proportion as the antagonism between  classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation  to another will come to an end.    The charges against Communism made from a religious, a  philosophical, and, generally, from an ideological standpoint,  are not deserving of serious examination.    Does it require deep intuition to comprehend that man's ideas,  views and conceptions, in one word, man's consciousness, changes  with every change in the conditions of his material existence, in  his social relations and in his social life?    What else does the history of ideas prove, than that  intellectual production changes its character in proportion as  material production is changed? The ruling ideas of each age  have ever been the ideas of its ruling class.    When people speak of ideas that revolutionise society, they do  but express the fact, that within the old society, the elements  of a new one have been created, and that the dissolution of the  old ideas keeps even pace with the dissolution of the old  conditions of existence.    When the ancient world was in its last throes, the ancient  religions were overcome by Christianity.  When Christian ideas  succumbed in the 18th century to rationalist ideas, feudal  society fought its death battle with the then revolutionary  bourgeoisie.  The ideas of religious liberty and freedom of  conscience merely gave expression to the sway of free competition  within the domain of knowledge.    \"Undoubtedly,\" it will be said, \"religious, moral, philosophical  and juridical ideas have been modified in the course of  historical development.  But religion, morality philosophy,  political science, and law, constantly survived this change.\"    \"There are, besides, eternal truths, such as Freedom, Justice,  etc. that are common to all states of society. But Communism  abolishes eternal truths, it abolishes all religion, and all  morality, instead of constituting them on a new basis; it  therefore acts in contradiction to all past historical experience.\"    What does this accusation reduce itself to?  The history of  all past society has consisted in the development of class  antagonisms, antagonisms that assumed different forms at  different epochs.    But whatever form they may have taken, one fact is common to all  past ages, viz., the exploitation of one part of society by the  other. No wonder, then, that the social consciousness of past  ages, despite all the multiplicity and variety it displays,  moves within certain common forms, or general ideas, which  cannot completely vanish except with the total disappearance of  class antagonisms.    The Communist revolution is the most radical rupture with  traditional property relations; no wonder that its development  involves the most radical rupture with traditional ideas.    But let us have done with the bourgeois objections to Communism.    We have seen above, that the first step in the revolution by the  working class, is to raise the proletariat to the position of  ruling as to win the battle of democracy.    The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by  degrees, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralise all  instruments of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the  proletariat organised as the ruling class; and to increase the  total of productive forces as rapidly as possible.    Of course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by  means of despotic inroads on the rights of property, and on  the conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures,  therefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable,  but which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves,  necessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and are  unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionising the mode of  production.    These measures will of course be different in different  countries.    Nevertheless in the most advanced countries, the following will  be pretty generally applicable.    1.  Abolition of property in land and application of all rents      of land to public purposes.    2.  A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.    3.  Abolition of all right of inheritance.    4.  Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.    5.  Centralisation of credit in the hands of the State, by means      of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive      monopoly.    6.  Centralisation of the means of communication and transport      in the hands of the State.    7.  Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by      the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and      the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a      common plan.    8.  Equal liability of all to labour.  Establishment of      industrial armies, especially for agriculture.    9.  Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries;      gradual abolition of the distinction between town and      country, by a more equable distribution of the population      over the country.    10. Free education for all children in public schools.      Abolition of children's factory labour in its present form.      Combination of education with industrial production, &c., &c.    When, in the course of development, class distinctions have  disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the  hands of a vast association of the whole nation, the public power  will lose its political character.  Political power, properly so  called, is merely the organised power of one class for oppressing  another.  If the proletariat during its contest with the  bourgeoisie is compelled, by the force of circumstances, to  organise itself as a class, if, by means of a revolution, it  makes itself the ruling class, and, as such, sweeps away by force  the old conditions of production, then it will, along with these  conditions, have swept away the conditions for the existence of  class antagonisms and of classes generally, and will thereby have  abolished its own supremacy as a class.    In place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and  class antagonisms, we shall have an association, in which  the free development of each is the condition for the free  development of all.

Feudal Socialism    Owing to their historical"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6104"],[0,"Station Life in New Zealand (#5)"],[1," creek by a series of jumps from one wet stone to another  is not easy for a beginner.    Mr. L---- brought a large dog with him, a kangaroo-hound (not unlike  a lurcher in appearance), to hunt the wekas. I had heard at night the  peculiar cry or call of these birds, but had not seen one until to-day.  \"Fly\" put up several, one after another, and soon ran them down. At  first I thought it very cruel to destroy such a tame and apparently  harmless creature, but I am assured that they are most mischievous, and  that it would be useless to turn out the pheasants and partridges which  Mr. L---- has brought from England, until the numbers of the wekas are  considerably reduced. They are very like a hen pheasant without the long  tail feathers, and until you examine them you cannot tell they have no  wings, though there is a sort of small pinion among the feathers, with  a claw at the end of it. They run very swiftly, availing themselves  cleverly of the least bit of cover; but when you hear a short sharp cry,  it is a sign that the poor weka is nearly done, and the next thing you  see is Fly shaking a bundle of brown feathers vehemently. All the dogs  are trained to hunt these birds, as they are a great torment, sucking  eggs and killing chickens; but still I could not help feeling sorry when  Fly, having disposed of the mother, returned to the flax-bush out of  which he had started her, and killed several baby-wekas by successive  taps of his paw.    I have wandered away from my account of the picnic in the most  unjustifiable manner. The gentlemen were toiling up the hill, after we  had crossed the creek, carrying the big basket by turns between them;  it was really hard work, and I must tell you in confidence, that I don't  believe they liked it--at least I can answer for one. I laughed at them  for not enjoying their task, and assured them that I was looking forward  with pleasure to washing up the plates and dishes after our luncheon;  but I found that they had all been obliged, in the early days of the  colony, to work at domestic drudgery in grim and grimy earnest, so it  had lost the charm of novelty which it still possessed for me.    As soon as we reached a pretty sheltered spot half-way up the hill among  some trees and ferns, and by the side of the creek, we unpacked the  basket, and began collecting dry wood for a fire: we soon had a splendid  blaze under the lee of a fine rock, and there we boiled our kettle and  our potatoes. The next thing was to find a deep hole in the creek, so  over-shadowed by rocks and trees that the water would be icy cold: in  this we put the champagne to cool. The result of all our preparations  was a capital luncheon, eaten in a most romantic spot, with a lovely  view before us, and the creek just like a Scotch burn, hurrying and  tumbling down the hill-side to join the broader stream in the valley.  After luncheon, the gentlemen considered themselves entitled to rest,  lying lazily back among the fern and smoking, whilst we ladies sat a  little apart and chatted: I was busy learning to knit. Then, about five,  we had the most delicious cup of tea I ever tasted, and we repacked the  basket (it was very light now, I assure you), and made our way back to  the top of the terrace, put the horses in again, and so home. It was  a long, bright, summer holiday, and we enjoyed it thoroughly. After a  voyage, such an expedition as this is full of delight; every tree and  bird is a source of pleasure.          Letter V: A pastoral letter.      Heathstock, December 1st, 1865. All I can find to tell you this month is  that I have seen one of the finest and best wool-sheds in the country  in full work. Anything about sheep is as new to you as it is to me, so I  shall begin my story at the very beginning.    I am afraid you will think us a very greedy set of people in this part  of the world, for eating seems to enter so largely into my letters; but  the fact is--and I may as well confess it at once--I am in a chronic  state of hunger; it is the fault of the fine air and the outdoor life:  and then how one sleeps at night! I don't believe you really know  in England what it is to be sleepy as we feel sleepy here; and it  is delightful to wake up in the morning with the sort of joyous  light-heartedness which only young children have. The expedition I  am going to relate may fairly be said to have begun with eating,  for although we started for our twelve miles' drive over the downs  immediately after an excellent and somewhat late breakfast, yet by the  time we reached the Home Station we were quite ready for luncheon. All  the work connected with the sheep is carried on here. The manager has  a nice house; and the wool-shed, men's huts, dip, etc., are near each  other. It is the busiest season of the year, and no time could be  spared to prepare for us; we therefore contented ourselves with what was  described to me as ordinary station fare, and I must tell you what they  gave us: first, a tureen of real mutton-broth, not hot water and chopped  parsley, but excel-lent thick soup, with plenty of barley and meat in  it; this had much the same effect on our appetites as the famous treacle  and brimstone before breakfast in \"Nicholas Nickleby,\" so that we were  only able to manage a few little sheeps' tongues, slightly pickled; and  very nice _they_ were; then we finished with a Devonshire junket, with  clotted cream _a discretion_. Do you think we were much to be pitied?    After this repast we were obliged to rest a little before we set out  for the wool-shed, which has only been lately finished, and has all the  newest improvements. At first I am \"free to confess\" that I did not like  either its sounds or sights; the other two ladies turned very pale, but  I was determined to make myself bear it, and after a moment or two I  found it quite possible to proceed with Mr. L----round the \"floor.\"  There were about twenty-five shearers at work, and everything seemed to  be very systematically and well arranged. Each shearer has a trap-door  close to him, out of which he pushes his sheep as soon as the fleece is  off, and there are little pens outside, so that the manager can notice  whether the poor animal has been too much cut with the shears, or badly  shorn in any other respect, and can tell exactly which shearer is to  blame. Before this plan was adopted it was hopeless to try to find out  who was the delinquent, for no one would acknowledge to the least snip.  A good shearer can take off 120 fleeces in a day, but the average is  about 80 to each man. They get one pound per hundred, and are found in  everything, having as much tea and sugar, bread and mutton, as they can  consume, and a cook entirely to themselves; they work at least fourteen  hours out of the twenty-four, and with such a large flock as this--about  50,000--must make a good deal.    We next inspected the wool tables, to which two boys were incessantly  bringing armfuls of rolled-up fleeces; these were laid on the tables  before the wool-sorters, who opened them out, and pronounced in a moment  to which _bin_ they belonged; two or three men standing behind rolled  them up again rapidly, and put them on a sort of shelf divided into  compartments, which were each labelled, so that the quality and kind of  wool could be told at a glance. There was a constant emptying of these  bins into trucks to be carried off to the press, where we followed  to see the bales packed. The fleeces are tumbled in, and a heavy  screw-press forces them down till the bale--which is kept open in a  large square frame--is as full as it can hold. The top of canvas is then  put on, tightly sewn, four iron pins are removed and the sides of the  frame fall away, disclosing a most symmetrical bale ready to be hoisted  by a crane into the loft above, where it has the brand of the sheep  painted on it, its weight, and to what class the wool belongs. Of course  everything has to be done with great speed and system.    I was much impressed by the silence in the shed; not a sound was to be  heard except the click of the shears, and the wool-sorter's decision as  he flings the fleece behind him, given in one, or at most two words. I  was reminded how touchingly true is that phrase, \"Like as a sheep before  her shearers is dumb.\" All the noise is _outside_; there the hubbub, and  dust, and apparent confusion are great,--a constant succession of woolly  sheep being brought up to fill the \"skillions\" (from whence the shearers  take them as they want them), and the newly-shorn ones, white, clean,  and bewildered-looking, being turned out after they have passed through  a narrow passage, called a \"race,\" where each sheep is branded, and has  its mouth examined in order to tell its age, which is marked in a book.  It was a comfort to think all their troubles were over, for a year. You  can hear nothing but barking and bleating, and this goes on from early  morning till dark. We peeped in at the men's huts--a long, low wooden  building, with two rows of \"bunks\" (berths, I should call their) in one  compartment, and a table with forms round it in the other, and piles of  tin plates and pannikins all about. The kitchen was near, and we were  just in time to see an enormous batch of bread withdrawn from a huge  brick oven: the other commissariat arrangements were on the same scale.  Cold tea is supplied all day long to the shearers, and they appear to  consume great quantities of it.    Our last visit was to the Dip, and it was only a short one, for it  seemed a cruel process; unfortunately, this fine station is in technical  parlance \"scabby,\" and although of course great precautions are taken,  still some 10,000 sheep had an ominous large S on them. These poor  sufferers are dragged down a plank into a great pit filled with hot  water, tobacco, and sulphur, and soused over head and ears two or three  times. This torture is repeated more than once.    I was very glad"]]]
