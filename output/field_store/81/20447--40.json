Then the fairies began walking round and round, singing their  song. When they had finished the song they heard a loud screech from  the devils that frightened all the fairies except the queen. She was  unmoved, and going to the fire, stirred the ashes with her wand, and saw  that the book and wand were burnt, and then she walked thrice round the  outer ring by herself, when she turned to the devils, and said:    \"I command you to be gone from our earthly home, get to your own abode.  I take the power of casting you all from here. Begone! begone! begone!\"  And all the devils flew up, and there was a mighty clap as of thunder,  and the earth trembled, and the sky became overcast, and all the devils  burst, and the sky cleared again.    After this the queen put three fairies by the old witch's side, and  they constantly dipped their wands in the sacred spring, and touched her  head, and she was sorely troubled and converted.    \"Bring the mirror,\" said the queen.    And the fairies brought the mirror and laid it in the middle circle, and  they all walked round three times, chanting again the song beginning  \"At the hour of one.\" When they had done this the queen stood still, and  said:    \"Stand and watch to see what you can see.\"    And as she looked she said:      \"The mirror shines unto me    That the witch we can see    Has three devils inside of she.\"    Immediately the witch had a fit, and the three fairies had a hard job to  keep the three devils quiet; indeed, they could not do so, and the queen  had to go herself with her wand, for fear the devils should burst the  witch asunder, and she said, \"Come out three evil spirits, out of thee.\"    And they came gnashing their teeth, and would have killed all the  fairies, but the queen said:    \"Begone, begone, begone! you evil spirits, to the place of your abode,\"  and suddenly the sky turned bright as fire, for the evil spirits were  trying their spleen against the fairies, but the queen said, \"Collect,  collect, collect, into one fierce ball,\" and the fiery sky collected  into one ball of fire more dazzling than the sun, so that none could  look at it except the queen, who wore a black silk mask to protect  her eyes. Suddenly the ball burst with a terrific noise, and the earth  trembled.    \"Enter into your abode, and never come down to our abode on earth any  more,\" said the queen.    And the witch was herself again, and she and the queen fairy were  immediately great friends. The witch, when she came out of the ring,  dropped on her knee and asked the queen if she might call her the Lady  of the Dell, and how she could serve her.    \"We will see about that,\" said the queen.    \"Well, how do you live?\" asked the woman who had been a witch.    \"Well, I'll tell you,\" said the queen. \"We go at midnight and milk the  cows, and we keep the milk, and it never grows less so long as we leave  some in the bottom of the vessel; we must not use it all. After milking  the cow, we rub the cow's purse and bless it, and she gives double the  amount of milk.\"    \"Well, how do you get corn?\"    \"Well, we were at the mill playing one day, and the miller came in and  saw us, and spoke kindly to us, and offered us some flour. 'We never  take nothing for nothing,' I said, so I blessed the bin: so in a few  minutes the bin was full to the brim with flour, and I said to the  miller, 'Now don't you empty the bin, but always leave a peck in it, and  for twelve months, no matter how much you use the bin, it will always  be full in the morning.' Now I have told you this much, and I will tell  further, 'You must love your neighbour, you must love all mankind.' Now  here is a purse of gold, go and buy what you want, eggs, bacon, cheese,  and get a flagon of wine and use these things freely, giving freely to  the aged poor, and if you never finish these things, there will always  be as much the next morning as you started with. And I shall make a  salve for you, and you must use the water from the sacred well. That  will be as a medicine, and people shall come from far and wide to be  cured by you, and you shall be loved by all, and you shall be known to  the poorest of the poor as Madame Dorothy.\"    And the woman did as she was told, and she became renowned for her  medical skill, especially in childbirth, for her salve eased the pains,  and her waters brought milk. By-and-by, she got known all over the  island, and rich people came to her from afar, and she always made the  rich pay, and the poor were treated free.    Madame Dorothy used to see the queen fairy at times, and one day she  asked her, \"Shall we meet again?\"    \"We cannot tell,\" said the queen, \"but I will give you a ring--let me  place it on your finger--it is a magic ring worked by fairies. Whenever  you seek to know of me, make a ring of your own, and walk round three  times and rub the ring; if it turns bright I am alive, but if you see  blood I am dead.\"    \"But how can that be? You are much younger than I am.\"    \"Oh, no! we fairies look young to the day of our death; we live to a  great age, but die naturally of old age, for we never have any ailments,  but still our power fades. Men fade in the flesh and power, but we fade  only in power. I am over seventy now.\"    \"But you look to be thirty.\"    \"Well, we will shake hands and part, for I must go elsewhere; as I have  no king, I do not stop in one place.\"    And they shook hands and parted.          ELLEN'S LUCK.    Ellen was a good girl, and beautiful to look upon. One Sunday she was  walking by an open gutter in a town in North Wales when she found a  copper. After that day Ellen walked every Sunday afternoon by the same  drain, and always found a copper. She was a careful girl, and used to  hoard her money.    One day her old mother found her pile of pennies, and wished to know  where she got them.    Ellen told her, but though she walked by the gutter for many a Sunday  after, she never found another copper.          THE FAIRIES' MINT.    Once upon a time there was a miller, who lived in Anglesey. One day  he noticed that some of his sacks had been moved during the night. The  following day he felt sure that some of his grain had been disturbed,  and, lastly, he was sure someone had been working his mill in the night  during his absence. He confided his suspicions to a friend, and they  determined to go the next night and watch the mill. The following night,  at about midnight, as they approached the mill, that stood on a bare  stony hill, they were surprised to find the mill all lit up and at work,  the great sails turning in the black night. Creeping up softly to  a small window, the miller looked in, and saw a crowd of little men  carrying small bags, and emptying them into the millstones. He could not  see, however, what was in the bags, so he crept to another window, when  he saw golden coins coming from the mill, from the place where the flour  usually ran out.    Immediately the miller went to the mill door, and, putting his key into  the lock, he unlocked the door; and as he did so the lights went out  suddenly, and the mill stopped working. As he and his friend went into  the dark mill they could hear sounds of people running about, but by  the time they lit up the mill again there was nobody to be seen, but  scattered all about the millstones and on the floor were cockle-shells.    After that, many persons who passed the mill at midnight said they saw  the mill lit up and working; but the old miller left the fairies alone  to coin their money.          THE PELLINGS.    In a meadow belonging to Ystrad, bounded by the river which falls from  Cwellyn Lake, they say the fairies used to assemble, and dance in fair  moonlight nights. One evening a young man, who was the heir and occupier  of this farm, hid himself in a thicket close to the spot where they used  to gambol. Presently they appeared, and when in their merry mood, out  he bounced from his covert, and seized one of their females; the rest  of the company dispersed themselves, and disappeared in an instant.  Disregarding her struggles and screams, he hauled her to his home, where  he treated her so very kindly that she became contented to live with him  as his maid-servant, but he could not prevail upon her to tell him her  name. Some time after, happening again to see the fairies upon the same  spot, he heard one of them saying, \"The last time we met here our sister  Penelope was snatched away from us by one of the mortals.\" Rejoiced at  knowing the name of his incognita, he returned home; and as she was  very beautiful and extremely active, he proposed to marry her, which she  would not for a long time consent to; at last, however, she complied,  but on this condition, \"That if ever he should strike her with iron, she  would leave him, and never return to him again.\" They lived happy for  many years together, and he had by her a son and a daughter; and by  her industry and prudent management as a housewife he became one of the  richest men in the country. He farmed, besides his own freehold, all the  lands on the north side of Nant y Bettws to the top of Snowdon, and  all Cwm brwynog in Llanberis, an extent of about five thousand acres or  upwards.    Unfortunately, one day Penelope followed her husband into the field to  catch a horse, and he, being in a rage at the animal as he ran away from  him, threw at him the bridle that was in his hand, which unluckily fell  on poor Penelope. She disappeared in an instant, and he never saw her  afterwards, but heard her voice in the window of his room one night  after, requesting him to take care of the children, in these words:--      \"Rhag bod anwyd ar fy mab,    Yn rhodd rhowch arno gob ei dad:    Rhag bod anwyd ar liw'r cann,    Rhoddwch arni bais ei mam.\"    That is,      \"Oh! lest my son should suffer cold,    Him in his father's coat infold:    Lest cold should"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8694"],[0,"The Abbot's Ghost, or Maurice Treherne's Temptation: A Christmas Story (#5)"],[1,"tand, but do not be anxious; the line I left was merely      this--\"I must see you alone, tell me when and where.\" No one can      make much of it, and I will discover the thief before dinner. Do      nothing, but watch to whom I speak first on entering, when we meet      in the evening, and beware of that person._    Quietly transferring the note to the fire with the wrapper of the  magazine, he dismissed the matter from his mind and left Mrs. Snowdon  to play detective as she pleased, while he busied himself about his  own affairs.    It was a clear, bright December day, and when the young people separated  to prepare for a ride, while the general and the major sunned themselves  on the terrace, Lady Treherne said to her nephew, \"I am going for an  airing in the pony carriage. Will you be my escort, Maurice?\"    \"With pleasure,\" replied the young man, well knowing what was in  store for him.    My lady was unusually taciturn and grave, yet seemed anxious to say  something which she found difficult to utter. Treherne saw this, and  ended an awkward pause by dashing boldly into the subject which  occupied both.    \"I think you want to say something to me about Tavie, Aunt. Am I right?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Then let me spare you the pain of beginning, and prove my sincerity by  openly stating the truth, as far as I am concerned. I love her very  dearly, but I am not mad enough to dream of telling her so. I know that  it is impossible, and I relinquish my hopes. Trust me. I will keep  silent and see her marry Annon without a word of complaint, if you will  it. I see by her altered manner that you have spoken to her, and that my  little friend and nurse is to be mine no longer. Perhaps you are wise,  but if you do this on my account, it is in vain--the mischief is done,  and while I live I shall love my cousin. If you do it to spare her, I am  dumb, and will go away rather than cause her a care or pain.\"    \"Do you really mean this, Maurice?\" And Lady Treherne looked at him with  a changed and softened face.    Turning upon her, Treherne showed her a countenance full of suffering  and sincerity, of resignation and resolve, as he said earnestly, \"I do  mean it; prove me in any way you please. I am not a bad fellow, Aunt,  and I desire to be better. Since my misfortune I've had time to test  many things, myself among others, and in spite of many faults, I do  cherish the wish to keep my soul honest and true, even though my body be  a wreck. It is easy to say these things, but in spite of temptation, I  think I can stand firm, if you trust me.\"    \"My dear boy, I do trust you, and thank you gratefully for this  frankness. I never forget that I owe Jasper's life to you, and never  expect to repay that debt. Remember this when I seem cold or unkind, and  remember also that I say now, had you been spared this affliction, I  would gladly have given you my girl. But--\"    \"But, Aunt, hear one thing,\" broke in Treherne. \"They tell me that any  sudden and violent shock of surprise, joy, or sorrow may do for me what  they hope time will achieve. I said nothing of this, for it is but a  chance; yet, while there is any hope, need I utterly renounce Octavia?\"    \"It is hard to refuse, and yet I cannot think it wise to build upon a  chance so slight. Once let her have you, and both are made unhappy, if  the hope fail. No, Maurice, it is better to be generous, and leave her  free to make her own happiness elsewhere. Annon loves her, she is  heart-whole, and will soon learn to love him, if you are silent. My poor  boy, it seems cruel, but I must say it.\"    \"Shall I go away, Aunt?\" was all his answer, very firmly uttered, though  his lips were white.    \"Not yet, only leave them to themselves, and hide your trouble if you  can. Yet, if you prefer, you shall go to town, and Benson shall see that  you are comfortable. Your health will be a reason, and I will come, or  write often, if you are homesick. It shall depend on you, for I want to  be just and kind in this hard case. You shall decide.\"    \"Then I will stay. I can hide my love; and to see them together will  soon cease to wound me, if Octavia is happy.\"    \"So let it rest then, for a time. You shall miss your companion as  little as possible, for I will try to fill her place. Forgive me,  Maurice, and pity a mother's solicitude, for these two are the last of  many children, and I am a widow now.\"    Lady Treherne's voice faltered, and if any selfish hope or plan  lingered in her nephew's mind, that appeal banished it and touched his  better nature. Pressing her hand he said gently, \"Dear Aunt, do not  lament over me. I am one set apart for afflictions, yet I will not be  conquered by them. Let us forget my youth and be friendly counselors  together for the good of the two whom we both love. I must say a word  about Jasper, and you will not press me to explain more than I can  without breaking my promise.\"    \"Thank you, thank you! It is regarding that woman, I know. Tell me all  you can; I will not be importunate, but I disliked her the instant I saw  her, beautiful and charming as she seems.\"    \"When my cousin and I were in Paris, just before my illness, we met her.  She was with her father then, a gay old man who led a life of pleasure,  and was no fit guardian for a lovely daughter. She knew our story and,  having fascinated both, paused to decide which she would accept: Jasper,  for his title, or me, for my fortune. This was before my uncle changed  his will, and I believed myself his heir; but, before she made her  choice, something (don't ask me what, if you please) occurred to send us  from Paris. On our return voyage we were wrecked, and then came my  illness, disinheritance, and helplessness. Edith Dubarry heard the  story, but rumor reported it falsely, and she believed both of us had  lost the fortune. Her father died penniless, and in a moment of despair  she married the general, whose wealth surrounds her with the luxury she  loves, and whose failing health will soon restore her liberty--\"    \"And then, Maurice?\" interrupted my lady.    \"She hopes to win Jasper, I think.\"    \"Never! We must prevent that at all costs. I had rather see him dead  before me, than the husband of such a woman. Why is she permitted to  visit homes like mine? I should have been told this sooner,\" exclaimed  my lady angrily.    \"I should have told you had I known it, and I reproved Jasper for his  neglect. Do not be needlessly troubled, Aunt. There is no blemish on  Mrs. Snowdon's name, and, as the wife of a brave and honorable man, she  is received without question; for beauty, grace, or tact like hers can  make their way anywhere. She stays but a week, and I will devote myself  to her; this will save Jasper, and, if necessary, convince Tavie of my  indifference--\" Then he paused to stifle a sigh.    \"But yourself, have you no fears for your own peace, Maurice? You must  not sacrifice happiness or honor, for me or mine.\"    \"I am safe; I love my cousin, and that is my shield. Whatever happens  remember that I tried to serve you, and sincerely endeavored to  forget myself.\"    \"God bless you, my son! Let me call you so, and feel that, though I deny  you my daughter, I give you heartily a mother's care and affection.\"    Lady Treherne was as generous as she was proud, and her nephew had  conquered her by confidence and submission. He acted no part, yet, even  in relinquishing all, he cherished a hope that he might yet win the  heart he coveted. Silently they parted, but from that hour a new and  closer bond existed between the two, and exerted an unsuspected  influence over the whole household.           *       *       *       *       *    Maurice waited with some impatience for Mrs. Snowdon's entrance, not  only because of his curiosity to see if she had discovered the thief,  but because of the part he had taken upon himself to play. He was equal  to it, and felt a certain pleasure in it for a threefold reason. It  would serve his aunt and cousin, would divert his mind from its own  cares, and, perhaps by making Octavia jealous, waken love; for, though  he had chosen the right, he was but a man, and moreover a lover.    Mrs. Snowdon was late. She always was, for her toilet was elaborate, and  she liked to enjoy its effects upon others. The moment she entered  Treherne's eye was on her, and to his intense surprise and annoyance she  addressed Octavia, saying blandly, \"My dear Miss Treherne, I've been  admiring your peacocks. Pray let me see you feed them tomorrow. Miss  Talbot says it is a charming sight.\"    \"If you are on the terrace just after lunch, you will find them there,  and may feed them yourself, if you like\" was the cool, civil reply.    \"She looks like a peacock herself in that splendid green and gold dress,  doesn't she?\" whispered Rose to Sir Jasper, with a wicked laugh.    \"Faith, so she does. I wish Tavie's birds had voices like Mrs.  Snowdon's; their squalling annoys me intensely.\"    \"I rather like it, for it is honest, and no malice or mischief is hidden  behind it. I always distrust those smooth, sweet voices; they are  insincere. I like a full, clear tone; sharp, if you please, but decided  and true.\"    \"Well said, Octavia. I agree with you, and your own is a perfect sample  of the kind you describe.\" And Treherne smiled as he rolled by to join  Mrs. Snowdon, who evidently waited for him, while Octavia turned to her  brother to defend her pets.    \"Are you sure? How did you discover?\" said Maurice, affecting to admire  the lady's bouquet, as he paused beside her.    \"I suspected it the moment I saw her this morning. She is no actress;  and dislike, distrust, and contempt were visible in her face when we  met. Till you so cleverly told me my note was lost, I fancied she was  disturbed about her brother--or you.\"    A sudden pause and a keen glance followed the last softly uttered  word, but Treherne met it with an inscrutable smile and a quiet \"Well,  what next?\"    \"Th"]]]
