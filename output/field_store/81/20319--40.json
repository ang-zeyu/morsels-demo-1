These are the only  instruments we shall use in this great summer offensive against  unemployment.  But we shall use them to the limit to protect the  willing from the laggard and to make the plan succeed.    In war, in the gloom of night attack, soldiers wear a bright badge  on their shoulders to be sure that comrades do not fire on  comrades.  On that principle, those who cooperate in this program  must know each other at a glance.  That is why we have provided a  badge of honor for this purpose, a simple design with a legend.  \"We  do our part,\" and I ask that all those who join with me shall  display that badge prominently.  It is essential to our purpose.    Already all the great, basic industries have come forward willingly  with proposed codes, and in these codes they accept the principles  leading to mass reemployment.  But, important as is this heartening  demonstration, the richest field for results is among the small  employers, those whose contribution will give new work for from one  to ten people.  These smaller employers are indeed a vital part of  the backbone of the country, and the success of our plans lies  largely in their hands.    Already the telegrams and letters are pouring into the White  House--messages from employers who ask that their names be placed  on this special Roll of Honor.  They represent great corporations  and companies, and partnerships and individuals.  I ask that even  before the dates set in the agreements which we have sent out, the  employers of the country who have not already done so--the big  fellows and the little fellows--shall at once write or telegraph to  me personally at the White House, expressing their intention of  going through with the plan.  And it is my purpose to keep posted in  the post office of every town, a Roll of Honor of all those who  join with me.    I want to take this occasion to say to the twenty-four governors  who are now in conference in San Francisco, that nothing thus far  has helped in strengthening this great movement more than their  resolutions adopted at the very outset of their meeting, giving  this plan their unanimous and instant approval, and pledging to  support it in their states.    To the men and women whose lives have been darkened by the fact or  the fear of unemployment, I am justified in saying a word of  encouragement because the codes and the agreements already  approved, or about to be passed upon, prove that the plan does  raise wages, and that it does put people back to work.  You can look  on every employer who adopts the plan as one who is doing his part,  and those employers deserve well of everyone who works for a  living.  It will be clear to you, as it is to me, that while the  shirking employer may undersell his competitor, the saving he thus  makes is made at the expense of his country's welfare.    While we are making this great common effort there should be no  discord and dispute.  This is no time to cavil or to question the  standard set by this universal agreement.  It is time for patience  and understanding and cooperation.  The workers of this country have  rights under this law which cannot be taken from them, and nobody  will be permitted to whittle them away, but, on the other hand, no  aggression is now necessary to attain those rights.  The whole  country will be united to get them for you.  The principle that  applies to the employers applies to the workers as well, and I ask  you workers to cooperate in the same spirit.    When Andrew Jackson, \"Old Hickory,\" died, someone asked, \"Will he  go to Heaven?\" and the answer was, \"He will if he wants to.\"  If I  am asked whether the American people will pull themselves out of  this depression, I answer, \"They will if they want to.\"  The essence  of the plan is a universal limitation of hours of work per week for  any individual by common consent, and a universal payment of wages  above a minimum, also by common consent.  I cannot guarantee the  success of this nationwide plan, but the people of this country can  guarantee its success.  I have no faith in \"cure-alls\" but I believe  that we can greatly influence economic forces.  I have no sympathy  with the professional economists who insist that things must run  their course and that human agencies can have no influence on  economic ills.  One reason is that I happen to know that  professional economists have changed their definition of economic  laws every five or ten years for a very long time, but I do have  faith, and retain faith, in the strength of common purpose, and in  the strength of unified action taken by the American people.    That is why I am describing to you the simple purposes and the  solid foundations upon which our program of recovery is built.  That  is why I am asking the employers of the nation to sign this common  covenant with me--to sign it in the name of patriotism and  humanity.  That is why I am asking the workers to go along with us  in a spirit of understanding and of helpfulness.        October 22,1933.      It is three months since I have talked with the people of this  country about our national problems; but during this period many  things have happened, and I am glad to say that the major part of  them have greatly helped the well-being of the average citizen.    Because, in every step which your government is taking we are  thinking in terms of the average of you--in the old words, \"the  greatest good to the greatest number\"--we, as reasonable people,  cannot expect to bring definite benefits to every person or to  every occupation or business, or industry or agriculture.  In the  same way, no reasonable person can expect that in this short space  of time, during which new machinery had to be not only put to work,  but first set up, that every locality in every one of the forty-  eight states of the country could share equally and simultaneously  in the trend to better times.    The whole picture, however--the average of the whole territory from  coast to coast--the average of the whole population of 120,000,000  people--shows to any person willing to look, facts and action of  which you and I can be proud.    In the early spring of this year there were actually and  proportionately more people out of work in this country than in any  other nation in the world.  Fair estimates showed twelve or thirteen  millions unemployed last March.  Among those there were, of course,  several millions who could be classed as normally unemployed--  people who worked occasionally when they felt like it, and others  who preferred not to work at all.  It seems, therefore, fair to say  that there were about 10 millions of our citizens who earnestly,  and in many cases hungrily, were seeking work and could not get it.  Of these, in the short space of a few months, I am convinced that  at least 4 millions have been given employment--or, saying it  another way, 40 percent of those seeking work have found it.    That does not mean, my friends, that I am satisfied, or that you  are satisfied that our work is ended.  We have a long way to go but  we are on the way.    How are we constructing the edifice of recovery--the temple which,  when completed, will no longer be a temple of money-changers or of  beggars, but rather a temple dedicated to and maintained for a  greater social justice, a greater welfare for America--the  habitation of a sound economic life?  We are building, stone by  stone, the columns which will support that habitation.  Those  columns are many in number and though, for a moment the progress of  one column may disturb the progress on the pillar next to it, the  work on all of them must proceed without let or hindrance.    We all know that immediate relief for the unemployed was the first  essential of such a structure and that is why I speak first of the  fact that three hundred thousand young men have been given  employment and are being given employment all through this winter  in the Civilian Conservation Corps Camps in almost every part of  the nation.    So, too, we have, as you know, expended greater sums in cooperation  with states and localities for work relief and home relief than  ever before--sums which during the coming winter cannot be lessened  for the very simple reason that though several million people have  gone back to work, the necessities of those who have not yet  obtained work is more severe than at this time last year.    Then we come to the relief that is being given to those who are in  danger of losing their farms or their homes.  New machinery had to  be set up for farm credit and for home credit in every one of the  thirty-one hundred counties of the United States, and every day  that passes is saving homes and farms to hundreds of families.  I  have publicly asked that foreclosures on farms and chattels and on  homes be delayed until every mortgagor in the country shall have  had full opportunity to take advantage of federal credit.  I make  the further request which many of you know has already been made  through the great federal credit organizations that if there is any  family in the United States about to lose its home or about to lose  its chattels, that family should telegraph at once either to the  Farm Credit Administration or the Home Owners Loan Corporation in  Washington requesting their help.    Two other great agencies are in full swing.  The Reconstruction  Finance Corporation continues to lend large sums to industry and  finance with the definite objective of making easy the extending of  credit to industry, commerce and finance.    The program of public works in three months has advanced to this  point:  Out of a total appropriated for public works of three  billion three hundred million, one billion eight hundred million  has already been allocated to federal projects of all kinds and  literally in every part of the United States and work on these is  starting forward.  In addition, three hundred millions have "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5770"],[0,"The Rover Boys in the Jungle; Or, Stirring Adventures in Africa (#5)"],[1,"than that feast we had, last year.\"    \"Right you are!\" came from Tom, \"Oh dear, do you remember how we  served Mumps that night!\" and he set up a roar over the  remembrance of the scene.    Hans Mueller had become one of the occupants of the dormitory, and  he was as much, interested as anybody in the preparations for the  spread. \"Dot vill pe fine!\" he said.  \"I like to have von feast  twist a veek, ha I ha!    \"He's a jolly dog,\" said Tom to Frank.    \"But, say, I've been thinking of having some fun with him before  this spread comes off.\"    \"Let me in on the ground floor,\" pleaded Frank, who always wok a  great interest in Tom's jokes.    \"I will, on one condition, Frank.\"    \"And what is that?\"    \"That you loan me that masquerade suit you have in your trunk.  The one you used at that New Year's dance at home.\"    \"You mean that Indian rig?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Hullo, I reckon I smell a mouse!\" laughed the senator's son.  \"I  heard you giving Hans that yarn about us training to fight  Indians.\"'    \"Did you indeed.\"    \"I did indeed; and I heard Hans say that he wanted nothing to do  with the Indians.\"    \"Well, he's going to have something to do with at least one  Indian,\" grinned Tom.  \"What do you say I get the suit?\"    \"Yes; if you'll fix it so that I can see the sport.\"    \"All of the crowd can see it, if they don't leak about it,\"  returned the fun-loving Rover.    Tom soon had the masquerade suit in his possession and also, some  face paints which Frank had saved from the New Year's dance mentioned.  Shortly afterward Tom joined the crowd in the gymnasium, where  Hans Mueller was trying to do some vaulting over the bars.    \"I dink I could chump dem sticks of I vos taller,\" the German  youth was saying.    \"Or the sticks were lower,\" replied Tom, with a wink at the crowd.  \"That's right, Hans, you had better learn how to jump now, and to  run, too.\"    \"The Indians have come,\" put in Frank.    \"Indians?\" repeated Hans Mueller.  \"Vere is da?\"    \"They say a band of them are in the woods around here,\" answered  Tom.  \"If you go out you want to be careful or they may scalp  you.\"    \"Cracious, Rofer, ton't say dot!\" cried Mueller in alarm.  \"Vot is  dem Indians doing here annavay?\"    \"They came in East to hunt up some buffalo that got away.  They  had something like half a million in a corral, and about two  thousand got away from them.\"    This preposterous announcement was taken by Hans Mueller in all  seriousness, and he asked Tom all sorts of ridiculous questions  about the savage red men, whom he supposed as wild and wily as  those of generations ago.    \"No, I ton't vonts to meet any of dem,\" he said at last.  \"Da vos  von pad lot alretty!\"    \"That's right, Hans, you give them a wide berth,\" said Tom, and  walked away.    Later on Tom persuaded Dick to ask Hans if he would not walk down  to Cedarville for him, to buy him a baseball.  Eager to be  accommodating, the German youth received the necessary permission  to leave the academy acres and hurried off at the full speed of  his sturdy legs.    \"Now for some fun!\" cried Tom, and ran off for the Indian suit and  the face paints.  These he took down to the bam and set to work to  transform himself into a wild-looking red man.    \"You're a lively one!\" grinned Peleg Snuggers, who stood watching  him.  \"We never had such a lad as you before Master Thomas.\"    \"Thanks, Peleg, and perhaps you'll never have one like me again--and  then you'll be dreadfully sorry.\"    \"Or glad,\" murmured Peleg.    \"Mum's the word, old man.\"    \"Oh, I never say nuthin, Master Thomas; you know that,\" returned  the man-of-all-work.    A number of the other pupils had been let into the secret, and,  led by Dick, they ran off to the woods lining the Cedarville road.  Tom came after them, skulking along that nobody driving by might  catch sight of him.    Not quite an hour later Hans Mueller was heard coming back.  The  German boy was humming to himself and at the same time throwing up  the new ball he had purchased for Dick.    \"Burra!  Burra!\" thundered out Tom, as he leaped from behind a big  tree.  \"Dutcha boy heap big scalp-me take um!  Burra!\"  And he  danced up to Hans, flourishing a big tin knife as he did so.  The  masquerade was a perfect one, and he looked like an Indian who had  just stepped forth from some Wild West show.    \"Ach du!\" screamed Hans, as he stopped short and grew white.  \"It's dem Indians come to take mine hair!  Oh, please, Mister  Indian, ton't vos touch me!\"    \"Dutcha boy heap nice hair,\" continued Tom, drawing nearer.  \"Maka  nice door-mat for Big Wolf.  Burra!\"    \"No, no; ton't vos touch mine hair-it vos all der hair I vos got!\"  howled Hans.  \"Please, Mister Indian mans, let me go!\"  And then  he started to back away.    \"White bay stop or Big Wolf shoot!\" bellowed Tom, drawing forth a  rusty pistol he had picked up in the barn.  This rusty pistol had  done lots of duty at fun-making before.    \"No, no; ton't shoot!\" screamed Hans.  Then he fell on his knees  in despair.    Tom could scarcely keep from laughing at the sight, and a snicker  or two could be heard coming from where Frank, Dick, and the  others were concealed behind the bushes.  But the German youth was  too terrorized to notice anything but that awful red man before  him, with his hideous war-paint of blue and yellow.    \"Dutcha boy dance for Big Wolf,\" went on Tom.  \"Dance!  Dance or  Big Wolf shoot!\"  And the fun-loving Rover set the pace in a mad,  caper that would have done credit to a Zulu.    \"I can't vos dance!\" faltered Hans, and then, thinking he might  appease the wrath of his unexpected enemy he began to caper about  in a clumsy fashion which was comical in the extreme.    \"Hoopla! keep it up!\" roared Tom.  \"Dutcha boy take the cake for  flingin' hees boots.  Faster, faster, or Big Wolf shoot, bang!\"    \"No, no; I vos dance so hard as I can!\" panted Hans, and renewed  his exertions until Tom could keep in no longer, and set up such a  laugh as had not been heard around the Hall for many a day.  It is  needless to add that the other boys joined in, still, however,  keeping out of sight.    \"You're a corker, Hans!\" cried Tom in his natural voice.  \"You  ought to join the buck-and-wing dancers in a minstrel company.\"    \"Vot--vot--?\" began the German boy in bewilderment.  \"Ain't  you no Indian?\"    \"To be sure I am; I'm Big Wolf, the Head Dancing Master of the  Tuscaroras, Hans, dear boy.  Don't you think I'm a stunner.\"    \"You vos Tom Rofer, made up,\" growled Hans in sudden and deep  disgust.  \"Vot for you vos blay me such a drick as dis, hey?\"    \"Just to wake you up, Hans.\"    \"I ton't vos been asleep, not me!\"    \"I mean to stir up your ideas--put something new into your  head.\"    \"Mine head vos all right, Tom.\"    \"To be sure it is.\"    \"Den vot you say you vos put somedings new py him, hey?\"    \"I mean to make you sharper-put you on your mettle.\"    \"I ton't understand,\" stammered the German youth hopelessly.    \"That's so, and you won't in a thousand years, Hans.  But you are  the right sort, any way.\"    \"I dink  I blay me Indian mineselluf some tay,\" mused Hans.  \"Dot  vos lots of fun to make me tance, vosn't it?  Vere you got dot  bistol?\"    \"Down in the barn.  Look out, or it may go off,\" added Tom, as he  held out the weapons, thinking Hans would draw back in alarm.    Instead, however, the German boy took the pistol and of a sudden  pointed it at Tom's head.    \"Now you tance!\" he cried abruptly.  \"Tance, or I vos shoot you  full of holes!\"    \"Hi, Tom; he's got the best of you now!\" cried Frank from behind  the bushes.    \"You can't make me dance, Hans,\" returned Tom.  \"That old rusty  iron hasn't been loaded for years.\"     \"It ton't vos no goot?  No.  Maybe you vos only fool me.\"    \"Pull the trigger and see,\" answered Tom coolly.    He had scarcely spoken when Hans Mueller did as advised.  A  tremendous report followed, and when the smoke cleared away the  boys in the bushes were horrified to see that the rusty pistol had  been shattered into a thousand pieces and that both Tom and Hans  lay on their backs in the road, their faces covered with blood.          CHAPTER VI    THE STRANGE FIGURE IN THE HALLWAY      At the fearful outcome of the joke Tom had been perpetrating the  boys concealed in the bushes were almost struck dumb, and for  several seconds nobody could speak or move.    \"Oh, Heavens, Tom is killed!\" burst out Dick, who was the first to  find his voice.  He ran forth as speedily as possible, and one  after another the other cadets followed.    Tom lay as quiet as death, with his eyes closed and the blood  trickling over his temple and left cheek.  Quickly Dick knelt by  his side and felt of his heart.    \"Tom, Tom, speak to me!  Tell me you are not seriously hurt!\" he  faltered.    But no answer came back, and Sam raced off to get some water,  which he brought in a tin can he had discovered lying handy.  The  water was dashed over Toni's face, and presently he gave a little  gasp.    \"Oh my! what struck me?\" he murmured, and then tried to sit up,  but for the minute the effort was a failure.    \"The pistol exploded,\" said Frank.  \"A piece must have hit you on  the head,\" and he pointed at a nasty scalp wound from which the  flow of blood emanated.    As well as it could be done, Frank and Dick bound up Tom's head  with a handkerchief, and presently the fun-loving lad declared  himself about as well as ever, \"Only a bit light-headed,\" as he  added.    In the meantime the others had given their attention to Hans, who  had been struck both in the scalp and in the shoulder.  It was a  good quarter of an hour before the German youth came around, and  then he felt so weak that the boys had to assist him back to the  academy.    \"Honestly, I thought the pistol was empty,\" said Tom, on the  return to the Hall.  \"Why, I think I've pulled that trigger a  dozen times.\"    \"Don't mention it,\" said Frank with a shiver.  \"Why, only last  week I "]]]
