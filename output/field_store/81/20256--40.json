Again I find it necessary to say that it is foreign to my purpose  to enter into a consideration of the merits or demerits of Higher  Criticism, or even to point out how much of that criticism merely  attacks an apostate Christianity's misconceptions and false  interpretations of the Bible, and not the Bible itself. It is  sufficient for my purpose, if I have made clear the results that must  inevitably follow this attack upon the Scriptures under the guise of  Higher Criticism.    I must notice briefly the other side of the question; that is, give  some account of the materials which have been brought to light in the  nineteenth century for the defense of the Bible; materials which tend  to prove its authenticity, its credibility, its inspiration and its  divine authority. And here I am but a compiler of a very few of the  principal results of researches that have been made in Egypt, in the  valley of the Euphrates and in Palestine. I make no pretentions to  original investigations of these researches, but accept the statements  of what I consider to be reliable authorities in relation to them.    In the year 1799 a French officer named Boussard discovered a large,  black basalt stone at Fort St. Julian near Rosetta, in the delta of  the Nile. From the circumstances of the discovery being near Rosetta  it has always been known as the Rosetta Stone. It was inscribed in  Greek, in Egyptian hieroglyphics, and a third class of writing which  is called Demotic. The last is the common writing of the people of  Egypt as opposed to the hieroglyphic which was written by the priests.  The Greek upon the stone was readily made out, and it was found to  consist of a decree drawn up by the priests of Memphis in honor of  Ptolemy Epiphanes, who ruled about 198 B. C. It was at once evident  that the Greek inscription on this stone was the translation of the  hieroglyphics upon it, and hence afforded a key to the interpretation  of the Egyptian hieroglyphics. By the fortunes of war the Rosetta Stone  was surrendered by the French to General Hutchinson and subsequently  presented to the British Museum where it is now preserved. Accurate  copies of the three-fold text were made forthwith and distributed among  the scholars of Europe with the result that through the combined,  patient labors of Silvestre de Sacy, Akebald the Swede, Thomas Young,  Champollion, Lepsius in Germany, Birch in England, and others, the  hieroglyphics were deciphered and a system of translation constructed  which enabled European scholars to read many of the inscriptions upon  the monuments of Egypt, and bring to light much of the history of  that country which hitherto had been a mystery. This gave an impetus  to research. The political representatives of the great countries of  Europe made collections of antiquities in Egypt, and travelers spent  much time and money in opening tombs and digging out ruins. The tombs  have given up not only their dead, but with them the books which  the Egyptians read, the furniture which they used in their houses,  the ornaments and articles of the toilet of the Egyptian lady, the  weapons of the warrior, the tools of the handicraftsman and laborer,  the dice of the gambler, the toys of the children, and the portraits,  statutes and figures of the men and women for whom they were made.  The many-lined inscriptions upon the tombs give us their ideas about  the future world, the judgment of the dead, the paradise of the happy  souls, the transmigration of souls, and they enable us to place a  juster estimate upon the statements of those Greek writers who profess  to understand and to describe with accuracy the difficult religion  of the educated Egyptians. And the result of all this, as affecting  the authenticity of the Bible? Simply this: the manners, customs,  governments, arts, sciences, occupations and state of civilization of  the Egyptians in general, are demonstrated by these monuments to be  substantially what they are described to be in the book of Genesis.  Also there is supposed to be the confirmation of special events in  the scripture narrative. Professor A. H. Sayce, for instance, has  the following upon the existence of such a line of kings ruling at  Jerusalem as Melchizedek is described to be in Genesis:        \"Among the cuneiform tablets found at Tel el-Amarna in Upper Egypt,      are letters to the Pharaoh from Ebed-tob, king of Jerusalem,      written a century before the time of Moses. In them he describes      himself as appointed to the throne, not by inheritance from his      father or mother (compare Heb. 7:3), but by the arm of 'the Mighty      King,' i. e. of the god of whose temple stood on Mount Moriah. He      must therefore have been a priest-king like Melchizedek. The name      of Jerusalem is written Ura-Salim, 'the city of the god of peace,'      and it was the capital of a territory which extended southward to      Kellah. In the inscriptions of Rameses II and Rameses III, Salem is      mentioned among the conquests of the Egyptian kings.\"    The same writer sees confirmation of the history of Joseph, son of  Jacob, in the following circumstance:        The \"Story of the Two Brothers,\" an Egyptian romance written for      the son of the Pharaoh of the oppression, contains an episode very      similar to the Biblical account of Joseph's treatment by Potiphar's      wife. Potiphar and Potipherah are the Egyptian Pa-tu-pa-Ra, \"the      gift of the Sun-god.\" The name given to Joseph, Zaphnath-paaneah,      (Gen. 41:45), is probably the Egyptian Zaf-nti-pa-ankh, \"nourisher      of the living one,\" i. e. of the Pharaoh. There are many instances      in the inscriptions of foreigners in Egypt receiving Egyptian      names, and rising to the highest offices of state.    The story of the Exodus as related in the Bible is supposed to find  confirmation in the following:        \"The cuneiform tablets found at Tel el-Amarna, in Upper Egypt, have      shown that in the latter days of the eighteenth Egyptian dynasty,      when the Pharaoh had become a convert to an Asiatic form of faith,      the highest offices of state were absorbed by foreigners, most of      whom were Canaanites. In the national reaction which followed, the      foreigners were expelled, exterminated, or reduced to serfdom;      while a new dynasty, the nineteenth, was founded by Rameses I. He,      therefore, must be the new king, the builder of Pa-Tum or Pithom      (now Tel el-Maskhuteh, near Ismailia), as has been proved by Dr.      Naville's researches, and consequently, as Egyptian students had      long maintained he must have been the Pharaoh of the oppression.\"    The occupancy of the land of Goshen by the Israelites who, it will be  remembered, were shepherds, is supposed to receive confirmation in the  following:        Further excavations of Dr. Neville have shown that Goshen, the      Egyptian Goshen (now Saft el-Henneh), is the modern Wadi Tumilat,      between Zagazig and Ismailia. A dispatch dated in the eighth year      of the reign of Meneptah, the son and successor of Rameses II,      state that Bedouin from Edom has been allowed to pass the Khetam or      \"fortress\" in the district of Succoth (Thukot), in order to feed      themselves and their herds on the possessions of Pharaoh. Khetam      is the Etham of Exodus 13:20. The geography of the Exodus agrees      remarkably with that of the Egyptian papyri of the time of Rameses      II and his son. [14]    The search for evidence of the truth of the Bible has not been confined  to Egypt. Equal interest has been awakened in those ancient empires  that occupied the valley of the Euphrates; in Palestine, and the  Sinaitic Peninsula. European scholars with keen interest followed the  study of the cuneiform characters found on Babylonian tablets and  monuments. Progress made in deciphering this ancient method of writing  led M. Botta, in 1842, to begin excavations upon the ancient site of  Nineveh, but he met with little success. Later, however,--1845--Mr.  Henry Layard (subsequently Sir Henry Layard) undertook excavations at  the same place for the Trustees of the British Museum, and succeeded in  uncovering the palaces of Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and Assur-banipal,  and in bringing to light the terra cotta tablets which formed the great  library founded by these kings at Nineveh, and of which some twenty-two  thousand are now preserved in the British Museum. An examination  of these tablets soon showed that they consisted of historical  inscriptions, astronomical reports and calculations, grammatical lists,  etc., and scholars began to apply Sir Henry Rawlinson's system of  decipherment of the Babylonian version of the Behistun inscription to  the texts inscribed upon these tablets. A large portion of the history  of Babylonia and Assyria through the translation of these tablets  is now revealed to us, and the knowledge of the language of these  countries has thrown much light upon the language, literature, history,  and learning of the Jews. The excavations which have been carried on  in Mesopotamia for the last fifty years have yielded the most valuable  results; and the inscribed slabs, monolithic stelae, boundary stones,  gate-sockets, bricks, seal-cylinders and tablets, now preserved in  the British Museum, afford an abundant supply of material from which  Bible customs and language may be freely explained and illustrated. The  cuneiform writing is, at least, as old as B. C. 3,80"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4732"],[0,"Prolegomena to the History of Israel (#5)"],[1,"iii., xxxiv.)    Scholars long rested satisfied with this twofold division of the  non-Deuteronomic Hexateuch, until Hupfeld demonstrated in certain  parts of Genesis, which until then had been assigned partly to the  \"main stock\" and partly to the Jehovist, the existence of a third  continuous source, the work of the so-called younger Elohist.  The  choice of this name was due to the circumstance that in this  document also Elohim is the ordinary name of the Deity, as it is  in the \"main stock\" up to Exodus vi.; the epithet \"younger,\"  however, is better left out, as it involves an unproved assumption,  and besides, is no longer required for distinction's sake, now that  the \"main stock\" is no longer referred to under so unsuitable a  name as that of Elohist.  Hupfeld further assumed that all the  three sources continued to exist separately until some one at a  later date brought them together simultaneously into a single  whole.  But this is a view that cannot be maintained: not merely  is the Elohist in his matter and in his manner of looking at things  most closely akin to the Jehovist; his document has come down to  us as Noldeke was thc first to perceive, only in extracts embodied  in the Jehovist narrative./1/    ***************************  Hermann Hupfeld, Die Quellen der Genesis u. die Art ihrer Zusammersetzung,  Berlin, 1853; Theodor Noldeke, Die s. g. Grundschrift des Pentateuch,  in Untersuchungen zur Kritik des Alten Testaments, Kiel, 1869.  ***************************    Thus, notwithstanding Hupfeld's discovery, the old division  into two great sections continues to hold good, and there is every  reason for adhering to this primary distinction as the basis of  further historical research, in spite of the fact, which is coming  to be more and more clearly perceived, that not only the  Jehovistic document, but the \"main stock\" as well, are complex  products, and that alongside of them occur hybrid or posthumous  elements which do not admit of being simply referred to either the  one or the other formation. /2/    ************************   2. J. Wellhausen, Die Composition des Hexateuchs, in Jahrb. f.  Deutsche Theologie, 1876, pp. 392-450, 531-602; 1877, pp. 407-479.  I do not insist on all the details, but, as regards the way in which  the literary process which resulted in the formation of the Pentateuch  is to be looked at in general, I believe I had indicated the proper  line of investigation.  Hitherto the only important corrections  I have received have been those of Kuenen in his Contributions  to the Criticism of the Pentateuch and Joshua, published in the Leyden  Theologisch Tijdschrift; but these are altogether welcome,  inasmuch as they only free my own fundamental view from some  relics of the old leaven of a mechanical separation of sources  which had continued to adhere to it.  For what Kuenen points out  is, that certain elements assigned by me to the Elohist are not  fragments of a once independent whole, but interpolated and  parasitic additions.  What effect this demonstration may have on  the judgment we form of the Elohist himself is as yet uncertain.  In the following pages the Jehovistic history-book is denoted by  the symbol JE, its Jehovistic part by J, and the Elohistic by E;  the \"main stock\" pure and simple, which is distinguished by its  systematising history and is seen unalloyed in Genesis, is called  the Book of the Four Covenants and is symbolised by Q;  for the  \"main stock\" as a whole (as modified by an editorial process) the  title of Priestly Code and the symbol RQ (Q and Revisers) are  employed.  *************************    Now the Law, whose historical position we have to determine,  is the so-called \"main stack,\" which, both by its contents  and by its origin, is entitled to be called the Priestly  Code, and will accordingly be so designated.  The Priestly Code  preponderates over the rest of the legislation in force, as well as  in bulk; in all matters of primary importance it is the normal  and final authority.  It was according to the mode furnished by it  that the Jews under Ezra ordered their sacred community, and upon it  are formed our conceptions of the Mosaic theocracy, with the  tabernacle at its centre, the high priest at its head, the priests  and Levites as its organs, the legitimate cultus as its regular  function.  It is precisely this Law, so called par exceIlence,  that creates the difficulties out of which our problem rises, and  it is only in connection with it that the great difference of  opinion exists as to date.  With regard to the Jehovistic document,  all are happily agreed that, substantially at all events, in  language, horizon, and other features, it dates from the golden age  of Hebrew literature, to which the finest parts of Judges, Samuel,  and Kings, and the oldest extant prophetical writings also  belong,--the period of the kings and prophets which preceded the  dissolution of the two Israelite kingdoms by the Assyrians.  About the origin of Deuteronomy there is still less dispute; in  all circles where appreciation of scientific results can be looked  for at all, it is recognised that it was composed in the same age  as that in which it was discovered, and that it was made the rule  of Josiah's reformation, which took place about a generation before  the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldaeans.  It is only in  the case of the Priestly Code that opinions differ widely; for it  tries hard to imitate the costume of the Mosaic period, and, with  whatever success, to disguise its own.  This is not nearly so much  the case with Deuteronomy, which, in fact, allows the real  situation (that of the period during which, Samaria having been  destroyed, only the kingdom of Judah continued to subsist) to  reveal itself very plainly through that which is assumed (xii.8,  xix.8). And the Jehovist does not even pretend to being a Mosaic  law of any kind; it aims at being a simple book of history; the  distance between the present and the past spoken of is not  concealed in the very least.  It is here that all the marks are  found which attracted the attention of Abenezra and afterwards of  Spinoza, such as Gen. xii. 6 (\"And the Canaanite was then in the  land\"), Gen.xxxvi.31 (\"These are the kings who reigned in Edom  before the children of Israel had a king\"), Num. xii.6, 7, Deut.  xxxiv.10 (\"There arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto  Moses\").  The Priestly Code, on the other hand, guards itself  against all reference to later times and settled life in Canaan,  which both in the Jehovistic Book of the Covenant (Exodus  xxi.-xxiii.) and in Deuteronomy are the express basis of the  legislation: it keeps itself carefully and strictly within the  limits of the situation in the wilderness, for which in all  seriousness it seeks to give the law.  It has actually been  successful, with its movable tabernacle, its wandering camp, and  other archaic details, in so concealing the true date of its  composition that its many serious inconsistencies with what we  know, from other sources, of Hebrew antiquity previous to the  exile, are only taken as proving that it lies far beyond all known  history, and on account of its enormous antiquity can hardly be  brought into any connection with it.  It is the Priestly Code,  then, that presents us with our problem.    3. The instinct was a sound one which led criticism for the time  being to turn aside from the historical problem which had  originally presented itself to De Wette, and afterwards had been  more distinctly apprehended by George and Vatke, in order, in the  first instance, to come to some sort of clear understanding as to  the composition of the Pentateuch.  But a mistake was committed  when it was supposed that by a separation of the sources (in which  operation attention was quite properly directed chiefly to  Genesis) that great historical question had been incidentally  answered.  The fact was, that it had been merely put to sleep, and  Graf has the credit of having, after a considerable interval,  awakened it again.  In doing so, indeed, he in turn laboured under  the disadvantage of not knowing what success had been achieved in  separating the sources, and thereby he became involved in a  desperate and utterly untenable assumption.  This assumption,  however, had no necessary connection with his own hypothesis, and  at once fell to the ground when the level to which Hupfeld brought  the criticism of the text had been reached.  Graf originally  followed the older view, espoused by Tuch in particular, that in  Genesis the Priestly Code, with its so obtrusively bare skeleton,  is the \"main stock,\" and that it is the Jehovist who supplements,  and is therefore of course the later.  But since, on the other  hand, he regarded the ritual legislature of the middle books as  much more recent than the work of the Jehovist, he was compelled to  tear it asunder as best he could from its introduction in Genesis,  and to separate the two halves of the Priestly Code by half a  millennium.  But Hupfeld had long before made it quite clear that  the Jehovist is no mere supplementer, but the author of a perfectly  independent work, and that the passages, such as Gen. xx.-xxii.,  usually cited as examples of the way in which the Jehovist worked  over the \"main stock,\" really proceed from quite another  source,--the Elohist.  Thus the stumbling-block of Graf had already  been taken out of the way, and his path had been made clear by an  unlooked-for ally.  Following Kuenen's suggestion, he did not  hesitate to take the helping-hand extended to him; he gave up his  violent division of the Priestly Code, and then had no difficulty  in deducing from the results which he had obtained with respect to  the main legal portion similar consequences with regard to the  narrative part in Genesis. /1/    ***************************  1.
