In their religious faith our parents were by profession Baptists, but  not of the rigid, iron-bedstead order; their house was a resort for  the good and intelligent of all denominations, and their hospitality  was proverbial. Thus, as their children grew up they had ample  opportunities for forming acquaintances with the erudite of all  religious persuasions.    Without the least shadow of vanity we can truly say of our parents,  their integrity was unimpeachable, and they were trustworthy in all  the social relations and business transactions of life; and carefully  trained their children to habits of industry, economy, and strict  morality, and extended to them the best facilities for scholastic  education the country at that time afforded.    Although a farmer by occupation, father was much abroad on public  business, and Lorenzo, being the eldest of the three brothers, was left  in charge, and early in life became accustomed to responsibilities,  which he discharged with scrupulous punctuality and that inflexibility  of purpose which ensures success; and from early childhood exhibited  the energy and decision of character which have marked his progress  in subsequent life. An unseen hand evidently was guiding him, for in  his boyhood he was energetically, yet unconsciously, preparing for the  position in life he was destined to occupy. Ever a student, at home  as well as in school, (most of his schooling after his twelfth year  was during the winter terms,) his book was his constant companion when  disengaged from filial duties; and when sought by his associates, \"_hid  up with his book_\" became proverbial. With the exception of one term in  a High School in Ravenna, Ohio, also a special term of tuition under  a Hebrew professor, he completed his scholastic training in Oberlin  College, which at that time was exclusively a Presbyterian institution.  Through the solicitation of an intimate friend, connected with the  college, he was induced to enter, and through whose influence, as a  special favor, he was admitted.    Although religiously trained from infancy, up to this time my brother  had devoted little or no attention to the subject of religion, at least  not sufficiently to decide in preference of any particular sect.    In the progress of his development, his ambition strongly led in the  direction of military distinction, so much so, that, watching with  a sisterly, jealous eye, the steps one by one, by which he gained  promotion in the military road to honor, I feared lest in the course of  human events his path might lead to the battle field, and his earthly  career prematurely close on a gory bed. I frequently plead, entreated,  and at times exhausted my stock of persuasion, but without effect.    At length he must have a first class military suit, and no one could  make it so precisely to his liking as his sister; she had made his  \"freedom suit\" (at the time referred to he had passed his twenty-first  year), which every one admired--it fitted him exactly, and now this  most important of all mortal habiliments should be entrusted to no  other. I made the suit--it was beautiful, magnificent, and my brother  donned it with as much, if not of military pride, of self-satisfaction  as ever Napoleon won a battle, but it proved of short duration, for he  soon felt that his ambition could not be satisfied without a collegiate  education. Determined on this, he laid his military ambition on the  altar, disposed of his paternal inheritance, and started for Oberlin.  His classical purpose was very satisfactory to my views--forming a  permanent quietus to my imaginary forebodings.    On his way to Oberlin, my brother accidentally fell in company with  David W. Patten, an incident to which he frequently refers as one  of those seemingly trivial occurrences in human life which leave an  indelible trace. This gentleman was an early champion of the fulness  of the Gospel as taught by Jesus and His Apostles in the meridian of  time, and revealed in our own day through the Prophet Joseph Smith; to  which cause Elder Patten fell a martyr on the 24th of October, 1838,  in Missouri, during the terrible scenes of persecution through which  the Latter-day Saints passed in that State. He possessed a mind of deep  thought and rich intelligence. In conversation with him, my brother  was much impressed with the depth and beauty of the philosophical  reasoning with which this inspired Elder seemed perfectly familiar, as  he descanted on the condition of the human family in connection with  the sayings of the ancient Prophets, as recorded in the Scriptures--the  dealings with, and the purposes of God in relation to His children on  the earth. From that time a new field, with a new train of reflections,  was open to my brother's mind, the impress of which has never been  erased.    We will now leave the subject of these sketches, in Oberlin, clubbed  with three or four of his classmates, alternately cooking their meals  and pursuing their studies with combined energies, while we digress in  order to form a connecting link in our narrative.    Having been thoroughly convinced of the authenticity of the Gospel in  its purity as revealed through Joseph Smith, I was baptized on the  fifth of April, 1835, and in the autumn of the same year, left my  father's house and united my interest with the Latter-day Saints in  Kirtland, Ohio.    Soon after my arrival, I sent for the \"Building Committee of the  Kirtland Temple,\" and, on my asking them if they would like a little  money, they replied that they had a payment to make soon, and did not  know where the means was coming from. I do not recollect how much I  gave them; however, it was sufficient to cover the present liability  of the committee, who felt greatly relieved, and proposed to send me  their note of hand for the amount. I told them that I did not want a  note--they were welcome to the money: however, they sent the note, and  some time after wished me to accept a house and lot--thus redeeming  their note. The lot was a very valuable one--situated near the Temple,  with fruit trees--an excellent spring of water, and a house that  accommodated two families. It was truly an enviable situation, and,  although I was teaching the Prophet's family school, and had my home  with them, my eldest sister, a widow with two children, wanted a home  in Kirtland, and I rented one part of the house while she occupied  the other. In all this, the hand of God was too plainly visible to be  mistaken, as will be manifest in the following events.    Now to our narrative: So intimately was my brother associated while  in college, with professors and students, that he became thoroughly  acquainted with the profession and the practice of the denomination  by which that popular institution was controlled; and, although he  cherished very friendly regards for the people, he was unfavorably  impressed with their system of religion. A short time before leaving  Oberlin, he wrote, asking me many questions concerning revealed  religion, at the same time saying, \"_If there is nothing better than is  to be found here in Oberlin College, good bye to all religions_.\"    I answered his questions, and knowing he intended crowning his studies  with a thorough knowledge of Hebrew, invited him to come to Kirtland  at the close of his term in Oberlin, as a school was soon to commence  there, under the tuition of an able Hebrew professor, for the sole  study of that language. Accordingly he came, but not with the most  distant idea of embracing the faith of the Latter-day Saints, of which  were most of the Hebrew students, with whom, including Apostles and the  Prophet Joseph, he became familiarly associated; and while he studied  the dead language of the ancient Hebrews, his mind also drank in,  and his heart became imbued with the living faith of the everlasting  Gospel--\"the faith once delivered to the\" ancient \"saints,\" and not  many weeks passed after his arrival, before he was baptized into the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.    What a marvelous change crossed the path of the young aspirant! This  one act of stepping into the waters of baptism, with its accompanying  ordinance of the laying on of hands for the reception of the Holy  Ghost, by authorized administrators, opened up a new world before him.  He now sees with a changed and vastly enlarged vision--having been  invested with an additional, a sixth sense, a sense which comprehends  the things of God--which penetrates into futurity and estimates eternal  values.    How wonderfully changed all his youthful aims! How suddenly they  sink into insignificance! How extended the sphere of his youthful  anticipations! How glorious--how exalted the motive power, the  incentive that now prompts his youthful ambition! Instead of earthly  military renown, he now enters the arena for championship with the  armies of heaven--the achievements of the Gods, crowned with the  laurels of eternity, everlasting glory, honor and eternal lives. Not  to be armed with carnal weapons, and to be decked with glittering  badges and costly equipage, to march forth in the pomp and pride of  battle array, for the shedding of human blood: but to go \"forth without  purse or scrip,\" clothed in the power of the Gospel of the Son of God,  wielding the sword of the Spirit of the Almighty, he now takes the  field to battle with the powers of darkness, priestcraft, superstition,  and wickedness, until the kingdoms of this world shall become the  kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.    In my brother's journal I find the following incidents recorded by  himself:    I was baptized by Elder John Boynton, then one of the Twelve Apostles,  June, 1836, in Kirtland, Ohio. Previous to accepting the ordinance  of baptism, in my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47730"],[0,"Defense of the Faith and the Saints (Volume 1 of 2) (#5)"],[1,"the plainness and  emphasis of this revelation, because from it I am made to realize  that there is a very important reason for the existence of the work  with which we are identified. I am glad to know that \"Mormonism\" did  not come into existence because its founders chanced to disagree with  prevailing notions about the form or object of baptism; that it did not  come into existence through a disagreement as to the character of the  government of the Church. From the revelation referred to I learn that  \"Mormonism\" came into existence because there was an absolute necessity  for a new dispensation of the gospel, a re-establishment of the Church  of Christ among men. The gospel had been corrupted; its ordinances  had been changed; its laws transgressed its truths so far lost to the  children of men that it rendered this new dispensation of the gospel  of Christ--miscalled \"Mormonism\"--necessary. I say that I rejoice in  the fact that \"Mormonism\" came into the world, and exists in the world  today, because the world stood and stands in sore need of it. But does  this re-establishment of the Church of Christ, this new dispensation  of the gospel, which we have received, make our relationship to the  children of men one of unfriendliness? I answer, No. On the contrary  our relationship to men is one of absolute friendliness, and we are  anxious to do the world good. We ought to understand that. We do  understand it. And it is important that the world should understand  it, that they may come to regard us in our true light, as friends of  humanity, and not enemies.    If you will look through some of the revelations given in the early  history of the church, you will find that from time to time the Lord  was under the necessity of correcting the ideas of the brethren  respecting their attitude towards religious world. The Lord said to  Martin Harris, by of correction:        \"Thou shalt declare glad tidings, yea, publish it upon the      mountains, and upon every high place, and among people that thou      shalt be permitted to see. And thou do it with all humility,      trusting in me, reviling not against revilers. And of tenets thou      shall not talk, but thou shall declare repentance and faith on the      Savior, and remission of sin by baptism and by fire, yea, even the      Holy Ghost.\"    The Prophet also from time to time found it necessary to correct the  Elders of the Church in respect of their attacks upon other churches.  At Kirtland, in 1836, when many of the Elders were upon the eve of  taking their departure for their fields of labor, he instructed them as  follows:        \"While waiting [for the Sacrament] I made the following remarks:      The time that we were required to tarry in Kirtland to be endowed      would be fulfilled in a few days, and then the Elders would go      forth, and each stand for himself . . . . to go in all meekness, in      sobriety, and preach Christ and him crucified; not to contend with      others on account of their faith or systems of religion, but pursue      a steady course. This I delivered by way of commandment; and all      who observe it not, will pull down persecution upon their heads,      while those who do, shall always be filled with the Holy Ghost;      this I pronounced as a prophesy.\" [A]    [Footnote A: History of the Church, vol. II, p. 431.]    In other words, because the Lord has opened the heavens and has given  a new dispensation of the gospel, it does not follow that his servants  or his people are to be contentious; that they are to make war upon  other people for holding different views respecting religion. Hence  this caution to the Elders of the Church that they should not contend  against other churches, make war upon their tenets, or revile even the  revilers.    At an earlier date still, the Lord had said to Oliver Cowdery and David  Whitmer:        \"If you have not faith, hope and charity, you can do nothing.      Contend against no church, save it be the church of the devil. Take      upon you the name of Christ, and speak the truth in soberness.\" [A]    [Footnote A: Doc. & Cov. Sec. 18, 19-21.]        \"The church of the devil\" here alluded to, I understand to mean      not any particular church among men, or any one sect of religion,      but something larger than that--something that includes within its      boundaries all evil wherever it may be found; as well in schools of      philosophy as in Christian sects; as well in systems of ethics as      in systems of religion--something that includes the whole empire of      Satan--what I shall call \"The Kingdom of Evil.\"    This descriptive phrase, \"the church of the devil,\" is also used in  the Book of Mormon; and while in attendance at a conference in one of  the border stakes of Zion, a question was propounded to me in relation  to its meaning. The passage occurs in the writings of the first Nephi.  An angel of the Lord is represented as saying to Nephi, \"Behold, there  are save two churches only: the one is the church of the Lamb of God,  and the other is the church of the devil.\" The question submitted to me  was, \"Is the Catholic church the church here referred to--the church of  the devil?\" \"Well,\" said I, in answer, \"I would not like to take that  position, because it would leave me with a lot of churches on my hands  that I might not then be able to classify.\" So far as the Catholic  church is concerned, I believe that there is just as much truth,  nay, personally I believe it has retained even more truth than other  divisions of so-called Christendom; and there is just as much virtue in  the Roman Catholic church as there is in Protestant Christendom; and I  am sure there is more strength.    I would not like; therefore, to designate the Catholic church as the  church of the devil. Neither would I like to designate any one or all  of the various divisions and subdivisions of Protestant Christendom  combined as such church; nor the Greek Catholic church; nor the  Buddhist sects; nor the followers of Confucius; nor the followers of  Mohammed; nor would I like to designate even the societies formed by  deists and atheists as constituting the church of the devil. The Book  of Mormon text ought to be read in connection with its context--with  the chapter that precedes it and the remaining portions of the chapter  in which the expression is found--then, I think, those who study it in  that manner will be forced to the conclusion that the prophet here has  in mind no particular church, no particular division of Christendom,  but he has in mind, as just stated, the whole empire of Satan; and  perhaps the thought of the passage would be more nearly expressed if we  use the term \"the Kingdom of Evil\" as Constituting the church of the  devil, in proof of which I submit the following passage from the Book  of Mormon---covering both the text and the context on the subject:        1. And it shall come to pass, that if the Gentiles shall hearken      unto the Lamb of God in that day that he shall manifest himself      unto them in word, and also in power, in very deed, unto the taking      away of their stumbling blocks;        2. And if they harden not their hearts against the Lamb of God,      they shall be numbered among the seed of thy father [Lehi; an      Israelite]; yea, they shall be numbered among the house of Israel;      and they shall be a blessed people upon the promised land for ever;      they shall be no more brought down into captivity; and the house of      Israel shall no more be confounded;        3. And that great pit which hath been digged for them, by that      great and abominable church, which was founded by the devil and his      children, that he might lead away the souls of men down to hell;      yea, that great pit which hath been digged for the destruction      of men, shall be filled by those who digged it, unto their utter      destruction, saith the Lamb of God; not the destruction of the      soul, save it be the casting of it into that hell which hath no end;        4. For behold, this is according to the captivity of the devil, and      also according to the justice of God, upon all those who will work      wickedness and abomination before him.        5. And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me, Nephi, saying,      Thou hast beheld that if the Gentiles repent, it shall be well with      them; and thou also knowest concerning the covenants of the Lord      unto the house of Israel; and thou also hast heard, that whoso      repenteth not, must perish;        6. Therefore, wo, be unto the Gentiles, if it so be that they      harden their hearts against the Lamb of God;        7. For the time cometh, saith the Lamb of God, that I will work      a great and a marvellous work among the children of men; a work      which shall be everlasting, either on the one hand or on the other;      either to the convincing of them unto peace and life eternal,      or unto the deliverance of them to the hardness of their hearts      and the blindness of their minds, unto their being brought down      into captivity, and also into destruction, both temporally and      spiritually, according to the captivity of the devil, of which I      have spoken.        8. And it came to pass that when the angel had spoken these words,      he said unto me, Rememberest thou the covenants of the Father unto      the house of Israel? I said unto him, Yea. And it came to pass that      he said unto me, look, and behold that great and abominable church,      which is the mother of abominations, whose foundation is the devil.      And he said unto me, behold there are, save two churches only; the      one is the church of the Lamb of God, and the other is the church      of the devil; wherefore, whoso belongeth not to the church of the      Lamb of God, belongeth to that great church, which is the mother of      abominations; and she is the whore of all the earth.        47.
