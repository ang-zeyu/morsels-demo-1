I own I am at a loss what to think.    PHIL.  Your judgment will soon be determined, if you will venture to  think as freely concerning this quality as you have done concerning the  rest. Was it not admitted as a good argument, that neither heat nor cold  was in the water, because it seemed warm to one hand and cold to the  other?    HYL.  It was.    PHIL.  Is it not the very same reasoning to conclude, there is no  extension or figure in an object, because to one eye it shall seem  little, smooth, and round, when at the same time it appears to the other,  great, uneven, and regular?    HYL.  The very same. But does this latter fact ever happen?    PHIL.  You may at any time make the experiment, by looking with one eye  bare, and with the other through a microscope.    HYL.  I know not how to maintain it; and yet I am loath to give up  EXTENSION, I see so many odd consequences following upon such a  concession.    PHIL.  Odd, say you? After the concessions already made, I hope you will  stick at nothing for its oddness. But, on the other hand, should it not  seem very odd, if the general reasoning which includes all other  sensible qualities did not also include extension? If it be allowed that  no idea, nor anything like an idea, can exist in an unperceiving  substance, then surely it follows that no figure, or mode of extension,  which we can either perceive, or imagine, or have any idea of, can be  really inherent in Matter; not to mention the peculiar difficulty there  must be in conceiving a material substance, prior to and distinct from  extension to be the SUBSTRATUM of extension. Be the sensible quality  what it will--figure, or sound, or colour, it seems alike impossible it  should subsist in that which doth not perceive it.    HYL.  I give up the point for the present, reserving still a right to  retract my opinion, in case I shall hereafter discover any false step in  my progress to it.    PHIL.  That is a right you cannot be denied. Figures and extension being  despatched, we proceed next to MOTION. Can a real motion in any  external body be at the same time very swift and very slow?    HYL.  It cannot.    PHIL.  Is not the motion of a body swift in a reciprocal proportion to  the time it takes up in describing any given space? Thus a body that  describes a mile in an hour moves three times faster than it would in  case it described only a mile in three hours.    HYL.  I agree with you.    PHIL.  And is not time measured by the succession of ideas in our minds?    HYL.  It is.    PHIL.  And is it not possible ideas should succeed one another twice as  fast in your mind as they do in mine, or in that of some spirit of  another kind?    HYL.  I own it.    PHIL.  Consequently the same body may to another seem to perform its  motion over any space in half the time that it doth to you. And the same  reasoning will hold as to any other proportion: that is to say, according  to your principles (since the motions perceived are both really in the  object) it is possible one and the same body shall be really moved the  same way at once, both very swift and very slow. How is this consistent  either with common sense, or with what you just now granted?    HYL.  I have nothing to say to it.    PHIL.  Then as for SOLIDITY; either you do not mean any sensible  quality by that word, and so it is beside our inquiry: or if you do, it  must be either hardness or resistance. But both the one and the other are  plainly relative to our senses: it being evident that what seems hard to  one animal may appear soft to another, who hath greater force and  firmness of limbs. Nor is it less plain that the resistance I feel is not  in the body.    HYL.  I own the very SENSATION of resistance, which is all you  immediately perceive, is not in the body; but the CAUSE of that  sensation is.    PHIL.  But the causes of our sensations are not things immediately  perceived, and therefore are not sensible. This point I thought had been  already determined.    HYL.  I own it was; but you will pardon me if I seem a little  embarrassed: I know not how to quit my old notions.    PHIL.  To help you out, do but consider that if EXTENSION be once  acknowledged to have no existence without the mind, the same must  necessarily be granted of motion, solidity, and gravity; since they all  evidently suppose extension. It is therefore superfluous to inquire  particularly concerning each of them. In denying extension, you have  denied them all to have any real existence.    HYL.  I wonder, Philonous, if what you say be true, why those  philosophers who deny the Secondary Qualities any real existence should  yet attribute it to the Primary. If there is no difference between them,  how can this be accounted for?    PHIL.  It is not my business to account for every opinion of the  philosophers. But, among other reasons which may be assigned for this, it  seems probable that pleasure and pain being rather annexed to the former  than the latter may be one. Heat and cold, tastes and smells, have  something more vividly pleasing or disagreeable than the ideas of  extension, figure, and motion affect us with. And, it being too visibly  absurd to hold that pain or pleasure can be in an unperceiving substance,  men are more easily weaned from believing the external existence of the  Secondary than the Primary Qualities. You will be satisfied there is  something in this, if you recollect the difference you made between an  intense and more moderate degree of heat; allowing the one a real  existence, while you denied it to the other. But, after all, there is no  rational ground for that distinction; for, surely an indifferent  sensation is as truly a SENSATION as one more pleasing or  painful; and consequently should not any more than they be supposed to  exist in an unthinking subject.    HYL.  It is just come into my head, Philonous, that I have somewhere  heard of a distinction between absolute and sensible extension. Now,  though it be acknowledged that GREAT and SMALL, consisting merely in  the relation which other extended beings have to the parts of our own  bodies, do not really inhere in the substances themselves; yet nothing  obliges us to hold the same with regard to ABSOLUTE EXTENSION, which is  something abstracted from GREAT and SMALL, from this or that  particular magnitude or figure. So likewise as to motion; SWIFT and  SLOW are altogether relative to the succession of ideas in our own  minds. But, it doth not follow, because those modifications of motion  exist not without the mind, that therefore absolute motion abstracted  from them doth not.    PHIL.  Pray what is it that distinguishes one motion, or one part of  extension, from another? Is it not something sensible, as some degree of  swiftness or slowness, some certain magnitude or figure peculiar to each?    HYL.  I think so.    PHIL.  These qualities, therefore, stripped of all sensible properties,  are without all specific and numerical differences, as the schools call  them.    HYL.  They are.    PHIL.  That is to say, they are extension in general, and motion in  general.    HYL.  Let it be so.    PHIL.  But it is a universally received maxim that EVERYTHING WHICH  EXISTS IS PARTICULAR. How then can motion in general, or extension in  general, exist in any corporeal substance?    HYL.  I will take time to solve your difficulty.    PHIL.  But I think the point may be speedily decided. Without doubt you  can tell whether you are able to frame this or that idea. Now I am  content to put our dispute on this issue. If you can frame in your  thoughts a distinct ABSTRACT IDEA of motion or extension, divested of  all those sensible modes, as swift and slow, great and small, round and  square, and the like, which are acknowledged to exist only in the mind, I  will then yield the point you contend for. But if you cannot, it will be  unreasonable on your side to insist any longer upon what you have no  notion of.    HYL.  To confess ingenuously, I cannot.    PHIL.  Can you even separate the ideas of extension and motion from the  ideas of all those qualities which they who make the distinction term  SECONDARY?    HYL.  What! is it not an easy matter to consider extension and motion by  themselves, abstracted from all other sensible qualities? Pray how do the  mathematicians treat of them?    PHIL.  I acknowledge, Hylas, it is not difficult to form general  propositions and reasonings about those qualities, without mentioning any  other; and, in this sense, to consider or treat of them abstractedly.  But, how doth it follow that, because I can pronounce the word MOTION  by itself, I can form the idea of it in my mind exclusive of body? or,  because theorems may be made of extension and figures, without any  mention of GREAT or SMALL, or any other sensible mode or quality,  that therefore it is possible such an abstract idea of extension, without  any particular size or figure, or sensible quality, should be  distinctly formed, and apprehended by the mind? Mathematicians treat of  quantity, without regarding what other sensible qualities it is attended  with, as being altogether indifferent to their demonstrations. But, when  laying aside the words, they contemplate the bare ideas, I believe you  will find, they are not the pure abstracted ideas of extension.    HYL.  But what say you to PURE INTELLECT? May not abstracted ideas be  framed by that faculty?    PHIL.  Since I cannot frame abstract ideas at all, it is plain I cannot  frame them by the help of PURE INTELLECT; whatsoever faculty you  understand by those words. Besides, not to inquire into the nature of  pure intellect and its spiritual objects, as VIRTUE, REASON, GOD,  or the like, thus much seems manifest--that sensible things are only to  be perceived by sense, or represented by the imagination.

A sob rose in her throat, two tears welled up in her eyes and  fell down her smooth, lovely cheeks.  \"Seven of you, and I'm only  twenty!\" she said pitifully.  \"Oh! it's too bad--oh dear! it  is too bad.\"          CHAPTER IV    The General Sees Active Service       \"My brain it teems      With endless schemes,      Both good and new.\"      It was a day after \"the events narrated in the last chapter,\"  as story-book parlance has it.  And Judy, with a wrathful look in  her eyes, was sitting on the nursery table, her knees touching her  chin and her thin brown hands clasped round them.    \"It's a shame,\" she said, \"it's a burning, wicked shame!  What's the use of fathers in the world, I'd like to know!\"    \"Oh, Judy!\" said Meg, who was curled up in an armchair, deep in  a book.  But she said it mechanically, and only as a matter of  duty, being three years older than Judy.    \"Think of the times we could have if he didn't live with us,\"  Judy continued, calmly disregardful.  \"Why, we'd have fowl  three times a day, and the pantomime seven nights a week.\"    Nell suggested that it was not quite usual to have pantomimic  performances on the seventh day, but Judy was not daunted.    \"I'd have a kind of church pantomime,\" she said thoughtfully--\"beautiful  pictures and things about the Holy Land, and the loveliest music,  and beautiful children in white, singing hymns, and bright colours  all about, and no collection plates to take your only threepenny  bit--oh! and no sermons or litanies, of course.\"    \"Oh, Judy!\" murmured Meg, turning a leaf.  Judy unclasped her  hands, and then clasped them again more tightly than before.  \"Six whole tickets wasted--thirty beautiful shillings--just  because we have a father!\"    \"He sent them to the Digby-Smiths,\" Bunty volunteered, \"and wrote  on the envelope, 'With compts. J. C. Woolcot.'\"    Judy moaned.  \"Six horrid little Digby-Smiths sitting in the  theatre watching our fun with their six horrid little eyes,\" she  said bitterly.    Bunty, who was mathematically inclined, wanted to know why they  wouldn't look at it through their twelve horrid little eyes, and  Judy laughed and came down from the table, after expressing a  wicked wish that the little Digby-Smiths might all tumble over the  dress-circle rail before the curtain rose.  Meg shut her book with  a hurried bang.    \"Has Pip gone yet?  Father'll be awfully cross.  Oh dear, what a  head I've got!\" she said.  \"Where's Esther?  Has anyone seen Esther?\"    \"My DEAR Meg!\" Judy said; \"why, it's at least two hours since  Esther went up the drive before your very nose.  She's gone to  Waverly--why, she came in and told you, and said she trusted you  to see about the coat, and you said, 'M--'m! all right.'\"    Meg gave a startled look of recollection.  \"Did I have to clean  it?\" she asked in a frightened tone, and pushing her fair hair  back from her forehead.  \"Oh, girls! what WAS it I had to do?\"    \"Clean with benzine, iron while wet, put in a cool place to keep  warm, and bake till brown,\" said Judy promptly.  \"SURELY you  heard, Margaret?  Esther was at such pains to explain.\"    Meg ruffled her hair again despairingly.  \"What shall I do?\" she  said, actual tears springing to her eyes.  \"What will Father  say?  Oh, Judy, you might have reminded me.\"    Nell slipped an arm round her neck.  \"She's only teasing,  Megsie; Esther did it and left it ready in the hall--you've only  to give it to Pip.  Pat has to take the dogcart into town this  afternoon to have the back seat mended, and Pip's going in it,  too, that's all, and they're putting the horse in now; you're  not late.\"    It was the coat Bunty had done his best to spoil that all  the trouble was about.  It belonged, as I said, to the Captain's  full-dress uniform, and was wanted for a dinner at the Barracks  this same evening.  And Esther had been sponging and cleaning  at it all the morning, and had left directions that it was to be  taken to the Barracks in the afternoon.    Presently the dogcart came spinning round to the door in great  style, Pip driving and Pat looking sulkily on.  They took the  coat parcel and put it carefully under the seat, and were  preparing to start again, when Judy came out upon the veranda,  holding the General in an uncomfortable position in her arms.    \"You come, too, Fizz, there's heaps of room--there's no reason you  shouldn't,\" Pip said suddenly.  \"Oh--h--h!\" said Judy, her eyes  sparkling.  She took a rapid step forward and lifted her foot to  get in.    \"Oh, I say!\" remonstrated Pip, \"you'll have to put on something  over that dress, old girl--it's all over jam and things.\"    Judy shot herself into the hall and returned with her ulster; she  set the General on the floor for a minute while she donned it,  then picked him up and handed him up to Pip.    \"He'll have to come, too,\" she said; \"I promised Esther I  wouldn't let him out of my sight for a minute; she's getting  quite nervous about him lately--thinks he'll get broken.\"    Pip grumbled a minute or two, but the General gave a gurgling,  captivating laugh and held up his arms, so he took him up and  held him while Judy clambered in.    \"We can come back in the tram to the Quay, and then get a boat  back,\" she said, squeezing the baby on the seat between them.  \"The General loves going on the water.\"    Away they sped; down the neglected carriage drive, out of the  gates, and away down the road.  Pip, Judy of the shining eyes,  the General devouring his thumb, and Pat smiling-faced once more  because in possession of the reins.    A wind from the river swept through the belt of gum trees on the  Crown lands, and sent the young red blood leaping through their  veins; it played havoc with Judy's curls, and dyed her brown  cheeks a warm red; it made the General kick and laugh and grow  restive, and caused Pip to stick his hat on the back of his head  and whistle joyously.    Until town was reached, when they were forced to yield  somewhat to the claims of conventionality.  On the way to  Paddington a gentleman on horseback slackened pace a little.  Pip took off his hat with a flourish, and Judy gave a frank,  pleased smile, for it was a certain old Colonel they had known  for years, and had cause to remember his good-humour and  liberality.    \"Well, my little maid--well, Philip, lad,\" he said, smiling  genially, while his horse danced round the dogcart--\"and the  General too--where are you all off to?\"    \"The Barracks--I'm taking something up for the governor,\" Pip  answered, Judy was watching the plunging horse with admiring eyes.  \"And then we're going back home.\"    The old gentleman managed, in spite of the horse's tricks, to  slip his hand in his pocket.  \"Here's something to make yourselves  ill with on the way,\" he said, handing them two half-crowns; \"but  don't send me the doctor's bill.\"    He flicked the General's cheek with his whip, gave Judy a nod, and  cantered off.    The children looked at each other with sparkling eyes.    \"Coconuts,\" Pip said, \"and tarts and toffee, and save the rest for  a football?\"  Judy shook her head.  \"Where do I come in?\" she said.  \"You'd keep the football at school.  I vote pink jujubes, and icecreams,  and a wax doll.\"    \"A wax grandmother!\" Pip retorted; \"you wouldn't be such a girl, I  hope.\"  Then he added, with almost pious fervour, \"Thank goodness  you've always hated dolls, Fizz.\"    Judy gave a sudden leap in her seat, almost upsetting the General,  and bringing down upon her head a storm of reproaches from the  coachman.  \"I know!\" she said; \"and we're almost halfway there  now.  Oh--h--h! it will be lovely.\"    Pip urged her to explain herself.    \"Bondi Aquarium--skating, boats, merry-go-round, switchback  threepence a go!\" she returned succinctly.    \"Good iron,\" Pip whispered softly, while he revolved the thing  in his mind.  \"There'd be something over, too, to get some tucker  with, and perhaps something for the football, too.\"  Then his  brow clouded.    \"There's the kid--whatever did you go bringing him for?  Just  like a girl to spoil everything!\" Judy looked nonplussed.    \"I quite forgot him,\" she said, vexedly.  \"Couldn't we leave  him somewhere?  Couldn't we ask someone to take care of him  while we go?  Oh, it would be TOO bad to have to give it up  just because of him.  It's beginning to rain, too; we couldn't  take him with us.\"    They were at the foot of Barrack Hill now, and Pat told them  they must get out and walk the rest of the way up, or he would  never get the dogcart finished to take back that evening.    Pip tumbled out and took the General, all in a bunched-up heap,  and Judy alighted carefully after him, the precious coat parcel  in her arms.  And they walked up the asphalt hill to the  gate leading to the officers' quarters in utter silence.    \"Well?\" Pip said querulously, as they reached the top.  \"Be  quick; haven't you thought of anything?\"    That levelling of brows, and pursing of lips, always meant deep  and intricate calculation on his sister's part, as he knew full  well.    \"Yes,\" Judy said quietly.  \"I've got a plan that will do, I think.\"  Then a sudden fire entered her manner.    \"Who is the General's father?  Tell me that,\" she said, in a  rapid, eager way; \"and isn't it right and proper fathers should  look after their sons?  And doesn't he deserve we should get  even with him for doing us out of the pantomime?  And isn't the  Aquarium too lovely to miss?\"    \"Well?\"  Pip said; his slower brain did not follow such rapid  reasoning.    \"Only I'm going to leave the General here at the Barracks for a  couple of hours till we come back, his father being the proper  person to watch over him.\"  Judy grasped the General's small.  fat hand in a determined way,"]]]
