And this the unlucky one knows,              Yet ventures a peace to oppose,      And being addicted to blows he carries a stick as he goes,      Lest while he is tipsy and reeling, some robber his cloak should be          stealing.        Often has it crossed my fancy, that the city loves to deal      With the very best and noblest members of her commonweal,      Just as with our ancient coinage, and the newly-minted gold.      Yea for these, our sterling pieces, all of pure Athenian mould,      All of perfect die and metal, all the fairest of the fair,      All of workmanship unequalled, proved and valued every-where        Both amongst our own Hellenes and Barbarians far away,      These we use not: but the worthless pinchbeck coins of yesterday,      Vilest die and basest metal, now we always use instead.      Even so, our sterling townsmen, nobly born and nobly bred,      Men of worth and rank and metal, men of honourable fame,      Trained in every liberal science, choral dance and manly game,      These we treat with scorn and insult, but the strangers newliest           come,      Worthless sons of worthless fathers, pinchbeck townsmen, yellowy           scum,      Whom in earlier days the city hardly would have stooped to use      Even for her scapegoat victims, these for every task we choose.      O unwise and foolish people, yet to mend your ways begin;      Use again the good and useful: so hereafter, if ye win      'Twill be due to this your wisdom: if ye fall, at least 'twill be      Not a fall that brings dishonour, falling from a worthy tree.      AEAC. By Zeus the Saviour, quite the gentleman    Your master is.      XAN. Gentleman? I believe you. He's all for wine and women, is my    master.      AEAC. But not to have flogged you, when the truth came out    That you, the slave, were passing off as master!      XAN. He'd get the worst of that.      AEAC. Bravo! that's spoken Like a true slave: that's what I love    myself.      XAN. You love it, do you?      AEAC. Love it? I'm entranced    When I can curse my lord behind his back.      XAN. How about grumbling, when you have felt the stick,    And scurry out of doors?      AEAC. That's jolly too.      XAN. How about prying?      AEAC. That beats everything!      XAN. Great Kin-god Zeus! And what of overhearing    Your master's secrets?      AEAC. What? I'm mad with joy.      XAN. And blabbing them abroad?      AEAC. O heaven and earth! When I do that, I can't contain myself.      XAN. Phoebus Apollo! clap your hand in mine, Kiss and be kissed: and    prithee tell me this, Tell me by Zeus, our rascaldom's own god, What's    all that noise within? What means this hubbub And row?      AEAC. That's Aeschylus and Euripides.      XAN. Eh?      AEAC. Wonderful, wonderful things are going on. The dead are rioting,    taking different sides.      XAN. Why, what's the matter?      AEAC. There's a custom here    With all the crafts, the good and noble crafts,    That the chief master of his art in each    Shall have his dinner in the assembly hall,    And sit by Pluto's side.      XAN. I understand.      AEAC. Until another comes, more wise than he    In the same art: then must the first give way.      XAN. And how has this disturbed our Aeschylus?      AEAC. 'Twas he that occupied the tragic chair,    As, in his craft, the noblest.      XAN. Who does now?      AEAC. But when Euripides came down, he kept    Flourishing off before the highwaymen,    Thieves, burglars, parricides--these form our mob    In Hades--till with listening to his twists    And turns, and pleas and counterpleas, they went    Mad on the man, and hailed him first and wisest:    Elate with this, he claimed the tragic chair    Where Aeschylus was seated.      XAN. Wasn't he pelted?      AEAC. Not he: the populace clamoured out to try    Which of the twain was wiser in his art.      XAN. You mean the rascals?      AEAC. Aye, as high as heaven!      XAN. But were there none to side with Aeschylus?      AEAC. Scanty and sparse the good, (_Regards the audience_) the same as    here.      XAN. And what does Pluto now propose to do?      AEAC. He means to hold a tournament, and bring    Their tragedies to the proof.      XAN. But Sophocles, How came not he to claim the tragic chair?      AEAC. Claim it? Not he! When _he_ came down, he kissed    With reverence Aeschylus, and clasped his hand,    And yielded willingly the chair to him.    But now he's going, says Cleidemides,    To sit third-man: and then if Aeschylus win,    He'll stay content: if not, for his art's sake,    He'll fight to the death against Euripides.      XAN. Will it come off?      AEAC. O yes, by Zeus, directly.    And then, I hear, will wonderful things be done,    The art poetic will be weighed in scales.      XAN. What! weigh out tragedy, like butcher's meat?      AEAC. Levels they'll bring, and measuring-tapes for words,    And moulded oblongs.      XAN. Is it bricks they are making?      AEAC. Wedges and compasses: for Euripides Vows that he'll test the    dramas, word by word.      XAN. Aeschylus chafes at this, I fancy.      AEAC. Well, He lowered his brows, upglaring like a bull.      XAN. And who's to be the judge?      AEAC. There came the rub. Skilled men were hard to find: for with the    Athenians Aeschylus, somehow, did not hit it off.      XAN. Too many burglars, I expect, he thought.      AEAC. And all the rest, he said, were trash and nonsense    To judge poetic wits. So then at last    They chose your lord, an expert in the art.    But go we in: for when our lords are bent    On urgent business, that means blows for us.        CHOR. O surely with terrible wrath will the thunder-voiced monarch be          filled,      When he sees his opponent beside him, the tonguester, the          artifice-skilled,      Stand, whetting his tusks for the fight! O surely, his eyes          rolling-fell              Will with terrible madness be fraught!      O then will be charging of plume-waving words with their          wild-floating mane,      And then will be whirling of splinters, and phrases smoothed down          with the plane,      When the man would the grand-stepping maxims, the language gigantic,          repel              Of the hero-creator of thought.      There will his shaggy-born crest upbristle for anger and woe,      Horribly frowning and growling, his fury will launch at the foe      Huge-clamped masses of words, with exertion Titanic up--tearing              Great ship-timber planks for the fray.      But here will the tongue be at work, uncoiling, word-testing              refining,      Sophist-creator of phrases, dissecting, detracting, maligning,      Shaking the envious bits, and with subtle analysis paring      The lung's large labour away.      EURIPIDES. Don't talk to me; I won't give up the chair, I say I am    better in the art than he.      DIO. You hear him, Aeschylus: why don't you speak?      EUR. He'll do the grand at first, the juggling trick    He used to play in all his tragedies.      DIO. Come, my fine fellow, pray don't talk too big.      EUR. I know the man, I've scanned him through and through,    A savage-creating stubborn-pulling fellow,    Uncurbed, unfettered, uncontrolled of speech,    Unperiphrastic, bombastiloquent.      AESCHYLUS. Hah! sayest thou so, child of the garden quean!    And this to ME, thou chattery-babble-collector,    Thou pauper-creating rags-and-patches-stitcher?    Thou shalt abye it dearly!      DIO. Pray, be still; Nor heat thy soul to fury, Aeschylus.      AESCH. Not till I've made you see the sort of man    This cripple-maker is who crows so loudly.      DIO. Bring out a ewe, a black-fleeced ewe, my boys:    Here's a typhoon about to burst upon us.      AESCH. Thou picker-up of Cretan monodies,    Foisting thy tales of incest on the stage--      DIO. Forbear, forbear, most honoured Aeschylus;    And you, my poor Euripides, begone    If you are wise, out of this pitiless hail,    Lest with some heady word he crack your scull    And batter out your brain-less Telephus.    And not with passion. Aeschylus, but calmly    Test and be tested. 'Tis not meet for poets    To scold each other, like two baking-girls.    But you go roaring like an oak on fire.      EUR. I'm ready, I!    I don't draw back one bit.    I'll lash or, if he will, let him lash first    The talk, the lays, the sinews of a play:    Aye and my Peleus, aye and Aeolus,    And Meleager, aye and Telephus.      DIO. And what do _you_ propose? Speak, Aeschylus.      AESCH. I could have wished to meet him otherwhere.    We fight not here on equal terms.      DIO. Why not?      AESCH. My poetry survived me: his died with him:    He's got it here, all handy to recite.    Howbeit, if so you wish it, so we'll have it.      DIO. O bring me fire, and bring me frankincense.    I'll pray, or e'er the clash of wits begin,    To judge the strife with high poetic skill.    Meanwhile (_to the Chorus_) invoke the Muses with a song.        CHOR. O Muses, the daughters divine of Zeus, the immaculate Nine,      Who gaze from your mansions serene on intellects subtle and keen,      When down to the tournament lists, in bright-polished wit they          descend,      With wrestling and turnings and twists in the battle of words to          contend,      O come and behold what the two antagonist poets can do,      Whose mouths are the swiftest to teach grand language and filings of          speech:      For now of their wits is the sternest encounter commencing in          earnest.

And the Canaanite was then in the land.    01:012:007 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed  will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who  appeared unto him.    01:012:008 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of  Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the  east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the  name of the LORD.    01:012:009 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.    01:012:010 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into  Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.    01:012:011 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into  Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou  art a fair woman to look upon:    01:012:012 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see  thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but  they will save thee alive.    01:012:013 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well  with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.    01:012:014 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt,  the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.    01:012:015 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before  Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.    01:012:016 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep,  and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she  asses, and camels.    01:012:017 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues  because of Sarai Abram's wife.    01:012:018 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou  hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?    01:012:019 Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her  to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.    01:012:020 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent  him away, and his wife, and all that he had.    01:013:001 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all  that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.    01:013:002 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.    01:013:003 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel,  unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel  and Hai;    01:013:004 Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the  first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.    01:013:005 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds,  and tents.    01:013:006 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell  together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell  together.    01:013:007 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle  and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite  dwelled then in the land.    01:013:008 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee,  between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be  brethren.    01:013:009 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray  thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the  right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.    01:013:010 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of  Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed  Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of  Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.    01:013:011 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed  east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.    01:013:012 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the  cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.    01:013:013 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD  exceedingly.    01:013:014 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated  from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art  northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:    01:013:015 For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it,  and to thy seed for ever.    01:013:016 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if  a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be  numbered.    01:013:017 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the  breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.    01:013:018 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain  of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.    01:014:001 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar,  Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of  nations;    01:014:002 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha  king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim,  and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.    01:014:003 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which  is the salt sea.    01:014:004 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth  year they rebelled.    01:014:005 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings  that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the  Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim,    01:014:006 And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is  by the wilderness.    01:014:007 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh,  and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that  dwelt in Hazezontamar.    01:014:008 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of  Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king  of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale  of Siddim;    01:014:009 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of  nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four  kings with five.    01:014:010 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings  of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled  to the mountain.    01:014:011 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all  their victuals, and went their way.    01:014:012 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom,  and his goods, and departed.    01:014:013 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the  Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of  Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.    01:014:014 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he  armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and  eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.    01:014:015 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by  night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left  hand of Damascus.    01:014:016 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his  brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.    01:014:017 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return  from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him,  at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.    01:014:018 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine:  and he was the priest of the most high God.    01:014:019 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most  high God, possessor of heaven and earth:    01:014:020 And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine  enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.    01:014:021 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons,  and take the goods to thyself.    01:014:022 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand  unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,    01:014:023 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and  that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I  have made Abram rich:    01:014:024 Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the  portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them  take their portion.    01:015:001 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a  vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding  great reward.    01:015:002 And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go  childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?    01:015:003 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and,  lo, one born in my house is mine heir.    01:015:004 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This  shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own  bowels shall be thine heir.    01:015:005 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward  heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said  unto him, So shall thy seed be.    01:015:006 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for  righteousness.    01:015:007 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of  Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.    01:015:008 And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall  inherit it?    01:015:009 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old,  and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a  turtledove, and a young pigeon."]]]
