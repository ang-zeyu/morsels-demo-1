Sitting in her green nook, watching  the golden light sparkling upon the river below, she faced her problem:    \"_Merle would really make a far better monitress than I should. Oughtn't  I to give the post up to her?_\"    It was a struggle, and a very difficult one, for Mavis, quiet though she  was, had her ambitions, and it would be hard to yield place to her  younger sister. It is only those who are accustomed to practise self-  control who have the strength for an emergency. She longed for the  opportunity of helping the school, and to stand aside voluntarily and  give the work up to another seemed a big sacrifice.    \"It's got to be, though!\" sighed Mavis. \"I'll go down and see Miss Fanny  about it at once. I expect I can make her understand.\"    Dodging Merle, who was disconsolately doing some gardening, she walked  back to 'The Moorings' and went to the hostel. Miss Fanny, busy among the  new boarders, received her with astonishment.    \"What is it, Mavis? I can only spare you five minutes. You want to speak  to me about the monitress-ship? My dear child, Miss Mitchell will explain  everything to you to-morrow, and tell you exactly what you have to do.  There's no need to trouble about it now.\"    \"It isn't that, please, Miss Fanny!\" blushed Mavis. \"The fact of the  matter is that I think Merle ought to have been chosen instead of me. I  was only one mark ahead of her. She'd make a far better monitress than I  should. May I resign and let her have the post instead?\"    This was coming to the point with a vengeance. Miss Fanny knitted her  eyebrows and pursed up her mouth into a button.    \"I rather expected Merle to be elected,\" she admitted cautiously.    \"She'd be splendid!\" urged Mavis, pursuing her advantage. \"She's a born  leader. She's able to organise things and to keep order, and she's good  at games. She'd throw herself heart and soul into it, and work  tremendously at all the new schemes. She'd start clubs among the juniors  as well as the seniors, and coach them in hockey, and do her level best!  I'll guarantee she would!\"    \"And what about yourself? Can't you do any of these things?\" questioned  Miss Fanny.    \"Not so well as Merle! I'm shyer, and I daren't speak out, and I'm not  much good at games. And oh! Miss Fanny, there's another side of the  question. I know Merle so well. If she's made monitress she'll be heart  and soul for the school and an enormous help, but--she's a queer girl,  and if she has no special place here or anything to concentrate her  energy on, she may give trouble.\"    \"That is certainly no reason for placing her in a post of authority,\"  frowned Miss Fanny.    \"No--but she's a girl who's always for or against, and it's so very  important she should be on the right side. I believe this would be the  making of her. She'd try for the sake of others when she wouldn't make  any effort for herself.\"    \"I believe you're right,\" conceded Miss Fanny thoughtfully. \"Miss  Mitchell would certainly be most relieved to have a monitress who was  capable of organising the juniors at games. She was wondering how she was  going to manage. Do I understand, then, that you wish to resign in favour  of Merle?\"    \"Please! I'll help her all I can in the background.\"    \"Very well, Mavis. I'll accept your resignation and announce the matter  in school to-morrow. Now I must go, for I have a hundred things to do.  Tell Merle to come five minutes earlier in the morning and I'll talk to  her in the study. On the whole, I think the arrangement will be all for  the best.\"    It was a very radiant, triumphant Mavis who ran home to the old garden,  found Merle among the flowerbeds, and told her the glorious news.    \"Sis! You can't mean it! Is it true? Oh, I don't like to take it! It's  too good of you! Don't you really mind? It's all the world to _me_.  I've been hoping to be made monitress ever since Miss Pollard spoke about  reorganising the school. Won't I have the time of my life! Monitress  Merle! It sounds nice, doesn't it? I must go and tell Jessop and Aunt  Nellie! How astonished everybody will be in school to-morrow. Fay and  Beata will be pleased. They were tremendously keen on my winning the  ballot. I'm so glad about it I want to turn a somersault or do something  mad. Come and dance with me, you old darling! What a trump you are!  You're _sure_ you don't mind?\"    \"Not a bit,\" said Mavis, swallowing a little lump in her throat. \"Of  course I'll be ready to help you with anything whenever you want me.  There'll be plenty of hard work just at first, no doubt. You'll soon be  up to your eyes in starting clubs and societies. Keep a corner for me on  the school magazine if you found one. That's all I bargain for. I always  liked the Literary Society at Whinburn High. My hearty congratulations to  you, and every good wish for the success of everything you undertake  --Miss Monitress Merle!\"          CHAPTER III    The New Monitress      The announcement of Mavis's resignation and the consequent promotion of  Merle to the post of monitress was received at school with varying  degrees of surprise. Some of the girls regretted it, others thought that  in the circumstances it was a wise decision.    \"On the whole, I'm glad,\" admitted Iva in private to Nesta. \"I love  Mavis, but she's too fine stuff for the job. It's like trying to cut  sacking with your most delicate pair of scissors. Now Merle will slash  away and won't mind anything. She's not afraid of those juniors, and  really some of them need a tight hand, the young wretches. It would half  kill Mavis to have to battle with them. Merle enjoys fighting.\"    \"She'll get it, then,\" laughed Nesta. \"There'll be plenty of scope for it  in the school, and I daresay I shall have a scrimmage or two with her  myself. Certainly Muriel will! Don't look shocked. We'll do our squabbles  in private if we have any. To the rest of the world, of course, the four  monitresses will seem absolutely at one about everything. We won't give  ourselves away!\"    In a school where hitherto there has been no strict standard of  discipline, and which has suddenly doubled its numbers, it is rather a  difficult matter to decide the absolute limits of authority. Miss  Mitchell, new herself, gave the monitresses some general rules and  directions but left them to make what she called 'their own by-laws.'    \"Work as much as you can through committees, and have an occasional  general meeting to voice popular opinion,\" she counselled. \"Always keep  your position as leaders, but don't degenerate into an oligarchy. Listen  to just grievances, and try and bring everybody into harmony. The tone of  the school will depend very largely upon you four. Remember it's a  responsibility as well as an honour to have such a post of trust.\"    By the wish of both Miss Pollard and Miss Mitchell, it was arranged that  Iva and Nesta, who were boarders, should busy themselves mostly with the  affairs of the hostel, and that Muriel and Merle should look after those  things which specially concerned the day-girls. There were, of course,  various societies in which they could all unite, but the interests of  both were to be equally balanced. In order that the girls should have  time to inaugurate the numerous projects that loomed on the horizon, the  last hour of the coming Thursday afternoon was set apart for the purpose,  and a general meeting was to be held in the schoolroom.    \"I shall leave you to manage it entirely yourselves,\" said Miss Mitchell.  \"Found your own clubs, make your own arrangements, and elect your own  committees and officers. You can come and tell me about it afterwards.\"    Merle, rejoicing over the liberty thus given, found Iva, Nesta, and  Muriel a trifle nervous and diffident.    \"The fact of the matter is,\" admitted Iva ruefully, \"we none of us know  how to conduct a public meeting. What do you _do_? I've a vague idea  that there ought to be a chairman and a secretary, but what else? Rather  weak of us, isn't it? It seems so humiliating to go and tell Miss  Mitchell we can't carry on! She'll think us queer monitresses. Merle, can  you give any light?\"    \"We used to have heaps of public meetings at Whinburn High, and I think I  know the ropes. I can coach you all up beforehand. I should say we'd  better find out what girls are most likely to be of help, and arrange for  them to be proposed as members of committees. There's Mavis, of course.  Beata and Romola Castleton have been at school before, and so has Fay  Macleod. Kitty Trefyre looks as if she might be useful.\"    \"I shall propose that you take the chair,\" said Iva. \"Oughtn't that to be  a question of age?\" interrupted Muriel quickly.    \"It's a question of who is competent to do it. Merle's the only one of us  who knows how,\" returned Nesta, looking Muriel squarely in the face.    \"Oh, all right!\" (rather sulkily).    \"We shall want a secretary, and you're a quick writer,\" suggested Merle,  with more tact than she generally possessed.    It was evident to Merle from the first that the greatest factor of  trouble in connection with her new post would lie with Muriel Burnitt.  Muriel was a little older than herself, she was clever, and she had a  sharp tongue. She had been educated solely at 'The Moorings,' and she  very much resented any allusions by Merle to former doings at the  Whinburn High school. Iva and Nesta were more broad-minded, and were  quite ready to take the benefit of Merle's past experiences, but as their  work lay largely at the hostel they were not so likely to clash. Even  Muriel, however, recognised the necessity of receiving instruction on the  subject of a public meeting, and allowed herself to be duly coached for  the duties of the occasion.    All the school felt quite excited when three o'clock on Thursday  afternoon arrived,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7836"],[0,"Jewish History : An Essay in the Philosophy of History (#5)"],[1,"history. Inductive logic lays down a rule for ascertaining the law of  a phenomenon produced by two or more contributory causes. By means of  what might be called a laboratory experiment, the several causes must  be disengaged from one another, and the effect of each observed by  itself. Thus it becomes possible to arrive with mathematical precision  at the share of each cause in the result achieved by several  co-operating causes. This method of difference, as it is called, is  available, however, only for a limited number of phenomena, only for  phenomena in the department of the natural sciences. It is in the  nature of the case that mental and spiritual phenomena, though they  may be observed, cannot be artificially reproduced. Now, in one  respect, Jewish history affords the advantages of an arranged  experiment. The historical life of ordinary nations, such nations as  are endowed with territory and are organized into a state, is a  complete intermingling of the political with the spiritual element.  Totally ignorant as we are of the development either would have  assumed, had it been dissevered from the other, the laws governing  each of the elements singly can be discovered only approximately.  Jewish history, in which the two elements have for many centuries been  completely disentangled from each other, presents a natural  experiment, with the advantage of artificial exclusions, rendering  possible the determination of the laws of spiritual phenomena with far  greater scientific exactitude than the laws of phenomena that result  from several similar causes.    Besides this high value for the purposes of science, this fruitful  suggestiveness for philosophic thought, Jewish history, as compared  with the history of other nations, enjoys another distinction in its  capacity to exercise an ennobling influence upon the heart. Nothing so  exalts and refines human nature as the contemplation of moral  steadfastness, the history of the trials of a martyr who has fought  and suffered for his convictions. At bottom, the second half of Jewish  history is nothing but this. The effective educational worth of the  Biblical part of Jewish history is disputed by none. It is called  \"sacred\" history, and he who acquires a knowledge of it is thought to  advance the salvation of his soul. Only a very few, however, recognize  the profound, moral content of the second half of Jewish history, the  history of the diaspora. Yet, by reason of its exceptional qualities  and intensely tragic circumstances, it is beyond all others calculated  to yield edification to a notable degree. The Jewish people is  deserving of attention not only in the time when it displayed its  power and enjoyed its independence, but as well in the period of its  weakness and oppression, during which it was compelled to purchase  spiritual development by constant sacrifice of self. A thinker crowned  with thorns demands no less veneration than a thinker with the laurel  wreath upon his brow. The flame issuing from the funeral pile on which  martyrs die an heroic death for their ideas is, in its way, as  awe-inspiring as the flame from Sinai's height. With equal force,  though by different methods, both touch the heart, and arouse the  moral sentiment. Biblical Israel the celebrated--medieval Judah the  despised--it is one and the same people, judged variously in the  various phases of its historical life. If Israel bestowed upon mankind  a religious theory of life, Judah gave it a thrilling example of  tenacious vitality and power of resistance for the sake of conviction.  This uninterrupted life of the spirit, this untiring aspiration for  the higher and the better in the domain of religious thought,  philosophy, and science, this moral intrepidity in night and storm and  in despite of all the blows of fortune--is it not an imposing,  soul-stirring spectacle? The inexpressible tragedy of the Jewish  historical life is unfailing in its effect upon a susceptible  heart.[6] The wonderful exhibition of spirit triumphant, subduing the  pangs of the flesh, must move every heart, and exercise uplifting  influence upon the non-Jew no less than upon the Jew.      [6] \"If there are ranks in suffering, Israel takes precedence of      all the nations--if the duration of sorrows and the patience      with which they are borne ennoble, the Jews are among the      aristocracy of every land--if a literature is called rich in      the possession of a few classic tragedies, what shall we say      to a National Tragedy lasting for fifteen hundred years, in      which the poets and the actors were also the heroes?\" (Zunz,      _Die synagogale Poesie_. Translation by George Eliot in      \"Daniel Deronda.\")    For non-Jews a knowledge of Jewish history may, under certain  conditions, come to have another, an humanitarian significance. It is  inconceivable that the Jewish people should be held in execration by  those acquainted with the course of its history, with its tragic and  heroic past.[7] Indeed, so far as Jew-haters by profession are  concerned, it is running a risk to recommend the study of Jewish  history to them, without adding a word of caution. Its effect upon  them might be disastrous. They might find themselves cured of their  modern disease, and in the possession of ideas that would render  worthless their whole stock in trade. Verily, he must have fallen to  the zero-point of anti-Semitic callousness who is not thrilled through  and through by the lofty fortitude, the saint-like humility, the  trustful resignation to the will of God, the stoic firmness, laid bare  by the study of Jewish history. The tribute of respect cannot be  readily withheld from him to whom the words of the poet[8] are  applicable:     \"To die was not his hope; he fain    Would live to think and suffer pain.\"      [7] As examples and a proof of the strong humanitarian influence      Jewish history exercises upon Christians, I would point to the      relation established between the Jews and two celebrities of      the nineteenth century, Schleiden and George Eliot. In his old      age, the great scientist and thinker accidentally, in the      course of his study of sources for the history of botany,      became acquainted with medieval Jewish history. It filled him      with ardent enthusiasm for the Jews, for their intellectual      strength, their patience under martyrdom. Dominated by this      feeling, he wrote the two admirable sketches: _Die Bedeutung      der Juden fuer Erhaltung und Wiederbelebung der Wissenschaften      im Mittelalter_ (1876) and _Die Romantik des Martyriums      bei den Juden im Mittelalter_ (1878). According to his own      confession, the impulse to write them was \"the wish to take at      least the first step toward making partial amends for the      unspeakable wrong inflicted by Christians upon Jews.\" As for      George Eliot, it may not be generally known that it was her      reading of histories of the Jews that inspired her with the      profound veneration for the Jewish people to which she gave      glowing utterance in \"Daniel Deronda.\" (She cites Zunz, was      personally acquainted with Emanuel Deutsch, and carried on a      correspondence with Professor Dr. David Kaufmann. See      _George Eliot's Life as related in her Letters and      Journals_. Arranged and edited by her husband, J. W. Cross,      Vol. iii, ed. Harper and Brothers.) Her enthusiasm prompted      her, in 1879, to indite her passionate apology for the Jews,      under the title, \"The Modern Hep! Hep! Hep!\"      [8] Pushkin.    When, in days to come, the curtain rises upon the touching tragedy of  Jewish history, revealing it to the astonished eye of a modern  generation, then, perhaps, hearts will be attuned to tenderness, and  on the ruins of national hostility will be enthroned mutual love,  growing out of mutual understanding and mutual esteem. And who can  tell--perhaps Jewish history will have a not inconsiderable share in  the spiritual change that is to annihilate national intolerance, the  modern substitute for the religious bigotry of the middle ages. In  this case, the future task of Jewish history will prove as sublime as  was the mission of the Jewish people in the past. The latter consisted  in the spread of the dogma of the unity of creation; the former will  contribute indirectly to the realization of the not yet accepted dogma  of the unity of the human race.          IV    THE HISTORICAL SYNTHESIS      To define the scope of Jewish history, its content and its  significance, or its place among scientific pursuits, disposes only of  the formal part of the task we have set ourselves. The central problem  is to unfold the meaning of Jewish history, to discover the principle  toward which its diversified phenomena converge, to state the  universal laws and philosophic inferences deducible from the peculiar  course of its events. If we liken history to an organic being, then  the skeleton of facts is its body, and the soul is the spiritual bond  that unites the facts into a whole, that conveys the meaning, the  psychologic essence, of the facts. It becomes our duty, then, to  unbare the soul of Jewish history, or, in scientific parlance, to  construct, on the basis of the facts, the synthesis of the whole of  Jewish national life. To this end, we must pass in review, by periods  and epochs, one after another, the most important groups of historical  events, the most noteworthy currents in life and thought that tell of  the stages in the development of Jewry and of Judaism. Exhaustive  treatment of the philosophical synthesis of a history extending over  three thousand years is possible only in a voluminous work. In an  essay like the present it can merely be sketched in large outline, or  painted in miniature. We cannot expect to do more than state a series  of general principles substantiated by the most fundamental arguments.  Complete demonstration of"]]]
