When it was desired to do this the occupants put on diving  suits, which were provided with portable oxygen tanks. Then they  entered a chamber into which water was admitted until it was equal in  pressure to that outside. Then a steel door was opened, and they could  step out. To re-enter the ship the operation was reversed.  This was  not a new feature. In fact, many submarines to-day use it.    At certain places there were thick bull's-eye windows, by means of  which the under-water travelers could look out into the ocean through  which they were moving. As a defense against the attacks of submarine  monsters there was a steel, pointed ram, like a big harpoon. There were  also a bow and a stern electrical gun, of which more will be told later.    In addition to ample sleeping accommodations, there were many  conveniences aboard the Advance. Plenty of fresh water could be  carried, and there was an apparatus for distilling more from the sea  water that surrounded the travelers.  Compressed air was carried in  large tanks, and oxygen could be made as needed. In short, nothing that  could add to the comfort or safety of the travelers had been omitted.  There was a powerful crane and windlass, which had been installed when  Mr. Swift thought his boat might be bought by the Government. This was  to be used for raising wrecks or recovering objects from the bottom of  the ocean. Ample stores and provisions were to be carried and, once the  travelers were shut up in the Advance, they could exist for a month  below the surface, providing no accident occurred.    All these things Tom and Mr. Sharp thought of as they looked over the  ship before turning in for the night. The craft was made immensely  strong to withstand powerful pressure at the bottom of the ocean. The  submarine could penetrate to a depth of about three miles. Below that  it was dangerous to go, as the awful force would crush the plates,  powerful as they were.    \"Well, we'll rush things to-morrow and the next day,\" observed Tom as  he prepared to leave the building. \"Then we'll soon see if it works.\"    For the next week there were busy times in the shop near the ocean.  Great secrecy was maintained, and though curiosity seekers did stroll  along now and then, they received little satisfaction. At first Mr.  Swift thought that the visit of Mr. Berg would have unpleasant results,  for he feared that the agent would talk about the craft, of which he  had so unexpectedly gotten a sight. But nothing seemed to follow from  his chance inspection, and it was forgotten.    It was one evening, about a week later, that Tom was alone in the shop.  The two mechanics that had been hired to help out in the rush had been  let go, and the ship needed but a few adjustments to make it ready for  the sea.    \"I think I'll just take another look at the water tank valves,\" said  Tom to himself as he prepared to enter the big compartments which  received the water ballast. \"I want to be sure they work properly and  quickly. We've got to depend on them to make us sink when we want to,  and, what's more important, to rise to the surface in a hurry. I've got  time enough to look them over before dad and Mr. Sharp get back.\"    Tom entered the starboard tank by means of an emergency sliding door  between the big compartments and the main part of the ship. This was  closed by a worm and screw gear, and once the ship was in the water  would seldom be used.    The young inventor proceeded with his task, carefully inspecting the  valves by the light of a lantern he carried.  The apparatus seemed to  be all right, and Tom was about to leave when a peculiar noise  attracted his attention. It was the sound of metal scraping on metal,  and the lad's quick and well-trained ear told him it was somewhere  about the ship.    He turned to leave the tank, but as he wheeled around his light flashed  on a solid wall of steel back of him. The emergency outlet had been  closed! He was a prisoner in the water compartment, and he knew, from  past experience, that shout as he would, his voice could not be heard  ten feet away. His father and Mr. Sharp, as he was aware, had gone to a  nearby city for some tools, and Mr. Jackson, the engineer, was  temporarily away. Mrs. Baggert, in the house, could not hear his cries.    \"I'm locked in!\" cried Tom aloud. \"The worm gear must have shut of  itself. But I don't see how that could be. I've got to get out mighty  soon, though, or I'll smother. This tank is airtight, and it won't take  me long to breath up all the oxygen there is here. I must get that  slide open.\"    He sought to grasp the steel plate that closed the emergency opening.  His fingers slipped over the smooth, polished surface. He was  hermetically sealed up--a captive!  Blankly he set his lantern down and  leaned hopelessly against the wall of the tank.    \"I've got to get out,\" he murmured.    As if in answer to him he heard a voice on the outside, crying:    \"There, Tom Swift! I guess I've gotten even with you now!  Maybe next  time you won't take a reward away from me, and lick me into the  bargain. I've got you shut up good and tight, and you'll stay there  until I get ready to let you out.\"    \"Andy Foger!\" gasped Tom. \"Andy Foger sneaked in here and turned the  gear. But how did he get to this part of the coast? Andy Foger, you let  me out!\" shouted the young inventor; and as Andy's mocking laugh came  to him faintly through the steel sides of the submarine, the imprisoned  lad beat desperately with his hands on the smooth sides of the tank,  vainly wondering how his enemy had discovered him.          Chapter Five    Mr. Berg is Suspicious      Not for long did the young inventor endeavor to break his way out of  the water-ballast tank by striking the heavy sides of it. Tom realized  that this was worse than useless.  He listened intently, but could hear  nothing. Even the retreating footsteps of Andy Foger were inaudible.    \"This certainly is a pickle!\" exclaimed Tom aloud. \"I can't understand  how he ever got here. He must have traced us after we went to Shopton  in the airship the last time.  Then he sneaked in here. Probably he saw  me enter, but how could he know enough to work the worm gear and close  the door? Andy has had some experience with machinery, though, and one  of the vaults in the bank where his father is a director closed just  like this tank. That's very likely how he learned about it. But I've  got to do something else besides thinking of that sneak, Andy. I've got  to get out of here. Let's see if I can work the gear from inside.\"    Before he started, almost, Tom knew that it would be impossible. The  tank was made to close from the interior of the submarine, and the  heavy door, built to withstand the pressure of tons of water, could not  be forced except by the proper means.    \"No use trying that,\" concluded the lad, after a tiring attempt to  force back the sliding door with his hands. \"I've got to call for help.\"    He shouted until the vibrations in the confined space made his ears  ring, and the mere exertion of raising his voice to the highest pitch  made his heart beat quickly. Yet there came no response. He hardly  expected that there would be any, for with his father and Mr. Sharp  away, the engineer absent on an errand, and Mrs. Baggert in the house  some distance off, there was no one to hear his calls for help, even if  they had been capable of penetrating farther than the extent of the  shed, where the under-water craft had been constructed.    \"I've got to wait until some of them come out here,\" thought Tom.  \"They'll be sure to release me and make a search. Then it will be easy  enough to call to them and tell them where I am, once they are inside  the shed. But--\" He paused, for a horrible fear came over him. \"Suppose  they should come--too late?\" The tank was airtight. There was enough  air in it to last for some time, but, sooner or later, it would no  longer support life. Already, Tom thought, it seemed oppressive, though  probably that was his imagination.    \"I must get out!\" he repeated frantically. \"I'll die in here soon.\"    Again he tried to shove back the steel door. Then he repeated his cries  until he was weary. No one answered him.  He fancied once he could hear  footsteps in the shed, and thought, perhaps, it was Andy, come back to  gloat over him.  Then Tom knew the red-haired coward would not dare  venture back. We must do Andy the justice to say that he never realized  that he was endangering Tom's life. The bully had no idea the tank was  airtight when he closed it. He had seen Tom enter and a sudden whim  came to him to revenge himself.    But that did not help the young inventor any. There was no doubt about  it now--the air was becoming close. Tom had been imprisoned nearly two  hours, and as he was a healthy, strong lad, he required plenty of  oxygen. There was certainly less than there had been in the tank. His  head began to buzz, and there was a ringing in his ears.    Once more he fell upon his knees, and his fingers sought the small  projections of the gear on the inside of the door. He could no more  budge the mechanism than a child could open a burglar-proof vault.    \"It's no use,\" he moaned, and he sprawled at full length on the floor  of the tank, for there the air was purer. As he did so his fingers  touched something. He started as they closed around the handle of a big  monkey wrench. It was one he had brought into the place with him.  Imbued with new hope he struck a match and lighted his lantern, which  he had allowed to go out as it burned up too much of the oxygen. By the  gleam of it he looked to see if there were any bolts or nuts he could  loosen with the wrench, in order to slide the door back. It needed but  a glance to show him the futility of this.    \"It's no go,\" he murmured, and he let the wrench fall to the floor.  There was a ringing,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/95"],[0,"The Prisoner of Zenda (#5)"],[1,"right to be. The King began  talking of what he would do in the future, old Sapt of what he had  done in the past, Fritz of some beautiful girl or other, and I of the  wonderful merits of the Elphberg dynasty. We all talked at once, and  followed to the letter Sapt's exhortation to let the morrow take care of  itself.    At last the King set down his glass and leant back in his chair.    \"I have drunk enough,\" said he.    \"Far be it from me to contradict the King,\" said I.    Indeed, his remark was most absolutely true--so far as it went.    While I yet spoke, Josef came and set before the King a marvellous old  wicker-covered flagon. It had lain so long in some darkened cellar that  it seemed to blink in the candlelight.    \"His Highness the Duke of Strelsau bade me set this wine before the  King, when the King was weary of all other wines, and pray the King to  drink, for the love that he bears his brother.\"    \"Well done, Black Michael!\" said the King. \"Out with the cork, Josef.  Hang him! Did he think I'd flinch from his bottle?\"    The bottle was opened, and Josef filled the King's glass. The King  tasted it. Then, with a solemnity born of the hour and his own  condition, he looked round on us:    \"Gentlemen, my friends--Rudolf, my cousin ('tis a scandalous story,  Rudolf, on my honour!), everything is yours to the half of Ruritania.  But ask me not for a single drop of this divine bottle, which I will  drink to the health of that--that sly knave, my brother, Black Michael.\"    And the King seized the bottle and turned it over his mouth, and drained  it and flung it from him, and laid his head on his arms on the table.    And we drank pleasant dreams to his Majesty--and that is all I remember  of the evening. Perhaps it is enough.            CHAPTER 4    The King Keeps His Appointment      Whether I had slept a minute or a year I knew not. I awoke with a start  and a shiver; my face, hair and clothes dripped water, and opposite me  stood old Sapt, a sneering smile on his face and an empty bucket in his  hand. On the table by him sat Fritz von Tarlenheim, pale as a ghost and  black as a crow under the eyes.    I leapt to my feet in anger.    \"Your joke goes too far, sir!\" I cried.    \"Tut, man, we've no time for quarrelling. Nothing else would rouse you.  It's five o'clock.\"    \"I'll thank you, Colonel Sapt--\" I began again, hot in spirit, though I  was uncommonly cold in body.    \"Rassendyll,\" interrupted Fritz, getting down from the table and taking  my arm, \"look here.\"    The King lay full length on the floor. His face was red as his hair,  and he breathed heavily. Sapt, the disrespectful old dog, kicked him  sharply. He did not stir, nor was there any break in his breathing. I  saw that his face and head were wet with water, as were mine.    \"We've spent half an hour on him,\" said Fritz.    \"He drank three times what either of you did,\" growled Sapt.    I knelt down and felt his pulse. It was alarmingly languid and slow. We  three looked at one another.    \"Was it drugged--that last bottle?\" I asked in a whisper.    \"I don't know,\" said Sapt.    \"We must get a doctor.\"    \"There's none within ten miles, and a thousand doctors wouldn't take  him to Strelsau today. I know the look of it. He'll not move for six or  seven hours yet.\"    \"But the coronation!\" I cried in horror.    Fritz shrugged his shoulders, as I began to see was his habit on most  occasions.    \"We must send word that he's ill,\" he said.    \"I suppose so,\" said I.    Old Sapt, who seemed as fresh as a daisy, had lit his pipe and was  puffing hard at it.    \"If he's not crowned today,\" said he, \"I'll lay a crown he's never  crowned.\"    \"But heavens, why?\"    \"The whole nation's there to meet him; half the army--ay, and Black  Michael at the head. Shall we send word that the King's drunk?\"    \"That he's ill,\" said I, in correction.    \"Ill!\" echoed Sapt, with a scornful laugh. \"They know his illnesses too  well. He's been 'ill' before!\"    \"Well, we must chance what they think,\" said Fritz helplessly. \"I'll  carry the news and make the best of it.\"    Sapt raised his hand.    \"Tell me,\" said he. \"Do you think the King was drugged?\"    \"I do,\" said I.    \"And who drugged him?\"    \"That damned hound, Black Michael,\" said Fritz between his teeth.    \"Ay,\" said Sapt, \"that he might not come to be crowned. Rassendyll here  doesn't know our pretty Michael. What think you, Fritz, has Michael no  king ready? Has half Strelsau no other candidate? As God's alive, man  the throne's lost if the King show himself not in Strelsau today. I know  Black Michael.\"    \"We could carry him there,\" said I.    \"And a very pretty picture he makes,\" sneered Sapt.    Fritz von Tarlenheim buried his face in his hands. The King breathed  loudly and heavily. Sapt stirred him again with his foot.    \"The drunken dog!\" he said; \"but he's an Elphberg and the son of his  father, and may I rot in hell before Black Michael sits in his place!\"    For a moment or two we were all silent; then Sapt, knitting his bushy  grey brows, took his pipe from his mouth and said to me:    \"As a man grows old he believes in Fate. Fate sent you here. Fate sends  you now to Strelsau.\"    I staggered back, murmuring \"Good God!\"    Fritz looked up with an eager, bewildered gaze.    \"Impossible!\" I muttered. \"I should be known.\"    \"It's a risk--against a certainty,\" said Sapt. \"If you shave, I'll wager  you'll not be known. Are you afraid?\"    \"Sir!\"    \"Come, lad, there, there; but it's your life, you know, if you're  known--and mine--and Fritz's here. But, if you don't go, I swear to you  Black Michael will sit tonight on the throne, and the King lie in prison  or his grave.\"    \"The King would never forgive it,\" I stammered.    \"Are we women? Who cares for his forgiveness?\"    The clock ticked fifty times, and sixty and seventy times, as I stood in  thought. Then I suppose a look came over my face, for old Sapt caught me  by the hand, crying:    \"You'll go?\"    \"Yes, I'll go,\" said I, and I turned my eyes on the prostrate figure of  the King on the floor.    \"Tonight,\" Sapt went on in a hasty whisper, \"we are to lodge in the  Palace. The moment they leave us you and I will mount our horses--Fritz  must stay there and guard the King's room--and ride here at a gallop.  The King will be ready--Josef will tell him--and he must ride back with  me to Strelsau, and you ride as if the devil were behind you to the  frontier.\"    I took it all in in a second, and nodded my head.    \"There's a chance,\" said Fritz, with his first sign of hopefulness.    \"If I escape detection,\" said I.    \"If we're detected,\" said Sapt. \"I'll send Black Michael down below  before I go myself, so help me heaven! Sit in that chair, man.\"    I obeyed him.    He darted from the room, calling \"Josef! Josef!\" In three minutes he was  back, and Josef with him. The latter carried a jug of hot water, soap  and razors. He was trembling as Sapt told him how the land lay, and bade  him shave me.    Suddenly Fritz smote on his thigh:    \"But the guard! They'll know! they'll know!\"    \"Pooh! We shan't wait for the guard. We'll ride to Hofbau and catch a  train there. When they come, the bird'll be flown.\"    \"But the King?\"    \"The King will be in the wine-cellar. I'm going to carry him there now.\"    \"If they find him?\"    \"They won't. How should they? Josef will put them off.\"    \"But--\"    Sapt stamped his foot.    \"We're not playing,\" he roared. \"My God! don't I know the risk? If  they do find him, he's no worse off than if he isn't crowned today in  Strelsau.\"    So speaking, he flung the door open and, stooping, put forth a strength  I did not dream he had, and lifted the King in his hands. And as he did  so, the old woman, Johann the keeper's mother, stood in the doorway.  For a moment she stood, then she turned on her heel, without a sign of  surprise, and clattered down the passage.    \"Has she heard?\" cried Fritz.    \"I'll shut her mouth!\" said Sapt grimly, and he bore off the King in his  arms.    For me, I sat down in an armchair, and as I sat there, half-dazed, Josef  clipped and scraped me till my moustache and imperial were things of the  past and my face was as bare as the King's. And when Fritz saw me thus  he drew a long breath and exclaimed:--    \"By Jove, we shall do it!\"    It was six o'clock now, and we had no time to lose. Sapt hurried me into  the King's room, and I dressed myself in the uniform of a colonel of the  Guard, finding time as I slipped on the King's boots to ask Sapt what he  had done with the old woman.    \"She swore she'd heard nothing,\" said he; \"but to make sure I tied her  legs together and put a handkerchief in her mouth and bound her hands,  and locked her up in the coal-cellar, next door to the King. Josef will  look after them both later on.\"    Then I burst out laughing, and even old Sapt grimly smiled.    \"I fancy,\" said he, \"that when Josef tells them the King is gone they'll  think it is because we smelt a rat. For you may swear Black Michael  doesn't expect to see him in Strelsau today.\"    I put the King's helmet on my head. Old Sapt handed me the King's sword,  looking at me long and carefully.    \"Thank God, he shaved his beard!\" he exclaimed.    \"Why did he?\" I asked.    \"Because Princess Flavia said he grazed her cheek when he was graciously  pleased to give her a cousinly kiss. Come though, we must ride.\"    \"Is all safe here?\"    \"Nothing's safe anywhere,\" said Sapt, \"but we can make it no safer.\"    Fritz now rejoined us in the uniform of a captain in the same regiment  as that to which my dress belonged. In four minutes Sapt had arrayed  himself in his uniform. Josef called that the horses were ready. We  jumped on their backs and started at a rapid trot. The game had begun.  What would the issue of it be?    The cool morning air cleared my head, and I was able to take in all  Sapt said to me. He was wonderful. Fritz hardly spoke, riding like a man  asleep, but Sapt, "]]]
