It has  become a rare occasion when it is permitted him to stroke his chin in  contemplation of some inner palsy. Therefore to give his wisdom scope,  the doctor some time since announced the cellar of the building to be a  hospital for dogs. Must I press the analogy? I have seen the doctor with  bowl and spoon in hand take leave of the cheerful world. He opens the  cellar door. A curdling yelp comes up the stairs. In the abyss below there  are twenty dogs at least, all of them sick, all dangerous. Not since Orion  led his hunting pack across the heavens has there been so fierce a sound.  The door closes. There is a final yelp, such as greets a bone. Doubtless,  by this time, they are munching on the doctor. Good sir, had you lived in  pre-apostolic days, your name would have been lined with Daniel's in the  hymn. I might have spent my earliest treble in your praise.    But there are other kinds of dogs. Gentlest of readers, have you ever  passed a few days at Tunbridge Wells? It lies on one of the roads that run  from London to the Channel and for several hundred years persons have gone  there to take the waters against the more fashionable ailments. Its chief  fame was in the days when rich folk, to ward off for the season a touch of  ancestral gout, travelled down from London in their coaches. We may fancy  Lord Thingumdo crossing his sleek legs inside or putting his head to the  window on the change of horses. He has outriders and a horn to sound his  coming. His Lordship has a liver that must be mended, but also he has  a weakness for the gaming table. Or Lady Euphemia, wrapped in silks,  languishes mornings in her lodgings with a latest novel, but goes forth at  noon upon the Pantilles to shop in the stalls. A box of patches must be  bought. A lace flounce has caught her eye. Bless her dear eyes, as she  bends upon her purchase she is fair to look upon. The Grand Rout is set for  tonight. Who knows but that the Duke will put the tender question and will  ask her to name the happy day?    But these golden days are past. Tunbridge Wells has sunk from fashion. The  gaming tables are gone. A band still plays mornings in the Pantilles--or  did so before the war--but cheaper gauds are offered in the shops. Emerald  brooches are fallen to paste. In all the season there is scarcely a single  demand for a diamond garter. If there were now a Rout, the only dancers  would be stiff shadows from the past. The healing waters still trickle from  the ground and an old woman serves you for a penny, but the miracle has  gone. The old world is cured and dead.    Tunbridge Wells is visited now chiefly by old ladies whose husbands--to  judge by the black lace caps--have left Lombard Street for heaven. At the  hotel where I stopped, which was at the top of the Commons outside the  thicker town, I was the only man in the breakfast room. Two widows, each  with a tiny dog on a chair beside her, sat at the next table. This was  their conversation:    \"Did you hear her last night?\"    \"Was it Flossie that I heard?\"    \"Yes. The poor dear was awake all night. She got her feet wet yesterday  when I let her run upon the grass.\"    But after breakfast--if the day is sunny and the wind sits in a favoring  quarter--one by one the widows go forth in their chairs. These are wicker  contrivances that hang between three wheels. Burros pull them, and men walk  alongside to hold their bridles. Down comes the widow. Down comes a maid  with her wraps. Down comes a maid with Flossie. The wraps are adjusted. The  widow is handed in. Her feet are wound around with comforters against a  draft. Her salts rest in her lap. Her ample bag of knitting is safe aboard.  Flossie is placed beside her. Proot! The donkey starts.    All morning the widow sits in the Pantilles and listens to the band and  knits. Flossie sits on the flagging at her feet with an intent eye upon the  ball of worsted. Twice in a morning--three times if the gods are kind--the  ball rolls to the pavement. Flossie has been waiting so long for this  to happen. It is the bright moment of her life--the point and peak of  happiness. She darts upon it. She paws it exultantly for a moment. Brief is  the rainbow and brief the Borealis. The finger of Time is swift.    The poppy blooms and fades. The maid captures the ball of worsted and  restores it.    It lies in the widow's lap. The band plays. The needles click to a long  tune. The healing waters trickle from the ground. The old woman whines  their merits. Flossie sits motionless, her head cocked and her eye upon the  ball. Perhaps the god of puppies will again be good to her.          ROADS OF MORNING      My grandfather's farm lay somewhere this side of the sunset, so near that  its pastures barely missed the splash of color. But from the city it was a  two hours' journey by horse and phaeton. My grandfather drove. I sat next,  my feet swinging clear of the lunchbox. My brother had the outside, a place  denied to me for fear that I might fall across the wheel. When we were  all set, my mother made a last dab at my nose--an unheeded smudge having  escaped my vigilance. Then my grandfather said, \"Get up,\"--twice, for the  lazy horse chose to regard the first summons as a jest. We start. The great  wheels turn. My brother leans across the guard to view the miracle. We  crunch the gravel. We are alive for excitement. My brother plays we are  a steamboat and toots. I toot in imitation, but higher up as if I were a  younger sort of steamboat. We hold our hands on an imaginary wheel and  steer. We scorn grocery carts and all such harbor craft. We are on a long  cruise. Street lights will guide us sailing home.    Of course there were farms to the south of the city and apples may have  ripened there to as fine a flavor, and to the east, also, doubtless there  were farms. It would be asking too much that the west should have all the  haystacks, cherry trees and cheese houses. If your judgment skimmed upon  the surface, you would even have found the advantage with the south. It was  prettier because more rolling. It was shaggier. The country to the south  tipped up to the hills, so sharply in places that it might have made its  living by collecting nickels for the slide. Indeed, one might think that a  part of the city had come bouncing down the slope, for now it lay resting  at the bottom, sprawled somewhat for its ease. Or it might appear--if your  belief runs on discarded lines--that the whole flat-bottomed earth had been  fouled in its celestial course and now lay aslant upon its beam with its  cargo shifted and spilled about.    The city streets that led to the south, which in those days ended in lanes,  popped out of sight abruptly at the top of the first ridge. And when the  earth caught up again with their level, already it was dim and purple and  tall trees were no more than a roughened hedge. But what lay beyond that  range of hills--what towns and cities--what oceans and forests--how beset  with adventure--how fearful after dark--these things you could not see,  even if you climbed to some high place and strained yourself on tiptoe. And  if you walked from breakfast to lunch--until you gnawed within and were but  a hollow drum--there would still be a higher range against the sky. There  are misty kingdoms on this whirling earth, but the ways are long and steep.    The lake lay to the north with no land beyond, the city to the east. But to  the west--    Several miles outside the city as it then was, and still beyond its  clutches, the country was cut by a winding river bottom with sharp edges of  shale. Down this valley Rocky River came brawling in the spring, over-fed  and quarrelsome. Later in the year--its youthful appetite having caught an  indigestion--it shrunk and wasted to a shadow. By August you could cross it  on the stones. The uproar of its former flood was marked upon the shale and  trunks of trees here and there were wedged, but now the river plays drowsy  tunes upon the stones. There is scarcely enough movement of water to flick  the sunlight. A leaf on its idle current is a lazy craft whose skipper  nods. There were hickory trees on the point above. May-apples grew in the  deep woods, and blackberries along the fences. And in the season sober  horses plowed up and down the fields with nodding heads, affirming their  belief in the goodness of the soil and their willingness to help in its  fruition.    Yet the very core of this valley in days past was a certain depth of water  at a turn of the stream. There was a clay bank above it and on it small  naked boys stood and daubed themselves. One of them put a band of clay  about himself by way of decoration. Another, by a more general smudge, made  himself a Hottentot and thereby gave his manners a wider scope and license.  But by daubing yourself entire you became an Indian and might vent yourself  in hideous yells, for it was amazing how the lungs grew stouter when the  clay was laid on thick. Then you tapped your flattened palm rapidly against  your mouth and released an intermittent uproar in order that the valley  might he warned of the deviltry to come. You circled round and round and  beat upon the ground in the likeness of a war dance. But at last, sated  with scalps, off you dived into the pool and came up a white man. Finally,  you stood on one leg and jounced the water from your ear, or pulled a  bloodsucker from your toes before he sapped your life--for this tiny  creature of the rocks was credited with the gift of prodigious inflation,  and might inhale you, blood, sinews, suspenders and all, if left to his  ugly purpose.    Farms should not be too precisely located; at least this is true of farms  which, like my grandfather's, hang in a mist of memory. I read once of a  wonderful spot--quite inferior, doubtless, to my grandfather's farm--which  was located by evil directions intentionally to throw a seeker off."]]]
