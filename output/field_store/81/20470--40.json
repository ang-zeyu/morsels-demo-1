The Royal Gardener had been frightened nearly into fits by the crash of  glass and the fall of the shaggy stranger into the bower of Roses, but  now he peeped out from behind a bush and cried in his squeaky voice:    \"You're breaking the Law! You're breaking the Law!\"    Shaggy stared at him solemnly.    \"Is the glass the Law in this country?\" he asked.    \"Breaking the glass is breaking the Law,\" squeaked the Gardener,  angrily. \"Also, to intrude in any part of the Rose Kingdom is breaking  the Law.\"    \"How do you know?\" asked Shaggy.    \"Why, it's printed in a book,\" said the Gardener, coming forward and  taking a small book from his pocket. \"Page thirteen. Here it is: 'If  any stranger enters the Rose Kingdom he shall at once be condemned by  the Ruler and put to death.' So you see, strangers,\" he continued  triumphantly, \"it's death for you all and your time has come!\"    But just here Hank interposed. He had been stealthily backing toward  the Royal Gardener, whom he disliked, and now the mule's heels shot out  and struck the little man in the middle. He doubled up like the letter  \"U\" and flew out of the door so swiftly--never touching the  ground--that he was gone before Betsy had time to wink.    But the mule's attack frightened the girl.    \"Come,\" she whispered, approaching the Shaggy Man and taking his hand;  \"let's go somewhere else. They'll surely kill us if we stay here!\"    \"Don't worry, my dear,\" replied Shaggy, patting the child's head. \"I'm  not afraid of anything, so long as I have the Love Magnet.\"    \"The Love Magnet! Why, what is that?\" asked Betsy.    \"It's a charming little enchantment that wins the heart of everyone who  looks upon it,\" was the reply. \"The Love Magnet used to hang over the  gateway to the Emerald City, in the Land of Oz; but when I started on  this journey our beloved Ruler, Ozma of Oz, allowed me to take it with  me.\"    \"Oh!\" cried Betsy, staring hard at him; \"are you really from the  wonderful Land of Oz?\"    \"Yes. Ever been there, my dear?\"    \"No; but I've heard about it. And do you know Princess Ozma?\"    \"Very well indeed.\"    \"And--and Princess Dorothy?\"    \"Dorothy's an old chum of mine,\" declared Shaggy.    \"Dear me!\" exclaimed Betsy. \"And why did you ever leave such a  beautiful land as Oz?\"    \"On an errand,\" said Shaggy, looking sad and solemn. \"I'm trying to  find my dear little brother.\"    \"Oh! Is he lost?\" questioned Betsy, feeling very sorry for the poor man.    \"Been lost these ten years,\" replied Shaggy, taking out a handkerchief  and wiping a tear from his eye. \"I didn't know it until lately, when I  saw it recorded in the magic Record Book of the Sorceress Glinda, in  the Land of Oz. So now I'm trying to find him.\"    \"Where was he lost?\" asked the girl sympathetically.    \"Back in Colorado, where I used to live before I went to Oz. Brother  was a miner, and dug gold out of a mine. One day he went into his mine  and never came out. They searched for him, but he was not there.  Disappeared entirely,\" Shaggy ended miserably.    \"For goodness sake! What do you s'pose became of him?\" she asked.    \"There is only one explanation,\" replied Shaggy, taking another apple  from his pocket and eating it to relieve his misery. \"The Nome King  probably got him.\"    \"The Nome King! Who is he?\"    \"Why, he's sometimes called the Metal Monarch, and his name is Ruggedo.  Lives in some underground cavern. Claims to own all the metals hidden  in the earth. Don't ask me why.\"    \"Why?\"    \"'Cause I don't know. But this Ruggedo gets wild with anger if anyone  digs gold out of the earth, and my private opinion is that he captured  brother and carried him off to his underground kingdom. No--don't ask  me why. I see you're dying to ask me why. But I don't know.\"    \"But--dear me!--in that case you will never find your lost brother!\"  exclaimed the girl.    \"Maybe not; but it's my duty to try,\" answered Shaggy. \"I've wandered  so far without finding him, but that only proves he is not where I've  been looking. What I seek now is the hidden passage to the underground  cavern of the terrible Metal Monarch.\"    \"Well,\" said Betsy doubtfully, \"it strikes me that if you ever manage  to get there the Metal Monarch will make you, too, his prisoner.\"    \"Nonsense!\" answered Shaggy, carelessly. \"You mustn't forget the Love  Magnet.\"    \"What about it?\" she asked.    \"When the fierce Metal Monarch sees the Love Magnet, he will love me  dearly and do anything I ask.\"    \"It must be wonderful,\" said Betsy, with awe.    \"It is,\" the man assured her. \"Shall I show it to you?\"    \"Oh, do!\" she cried; so Shaggy searched in his shaggy pocket and drew  out a small silver magnet, shaped like a horseshoe.    The moment Betsy saw it she began to like the Shaggy Man better than  before. Hank also saw the Magnet and crept up to Shaggy to rub his head  lovingly against the man's knee.    But they were interrupted by the Royal Gardener, who stuck his head  into the greenhouse and shouted angrily:    \"You are all condemned to death! Your only chance to escape is to leave  here instantly.\"    This startled little Betsy, but the Shaggy Man merely waved the Magnet  toward the Gardener, who, seeing it, rushed forward and threw himself  at Shaggy's feet, murmuring in honeyed words:    \"Oh, you lovely, lovely man! How fond I am of you! Every shag and  bobtail that decorates you is dear to me--all I have is yours! But for  goodness' sake get out of here before you die the death.\"    \"I'm not going to die,\" declared Shaggy Man.    \"You must. It's the Law,\" exclaimed the Gardener, beginning to weep  real tears. \"It breaks my heart to tell you this bad news, but the Law  says that all strangers must be condemned by the Ruler to die the  death.\"    \"No Ruler has condemned us yet,\" said Betsy.    \"Of course not,\" added Shaggy. \"We haven't even seen the Ruler of the  Rose Kingdom.\"    \"Well, to tell the truth,\" said the Gardener, in a perplexed tone of  voice, \"we haven't any real Ruler, just now. You see, all our Rulers  grow on bushes in the Royal Gardens, and the last one we had got  mildewed and withered before his time. So we had to plant him, and at  this time there is no one growing on the Royal Bushes who is ripe  enough to pick.\"    \"How do you know?\" asked Betsy.    \"Why, I'm the Royal Gardener. Plenty of royalties are growing, I admit;  but just now they are all green. Until one ripens, I am supposed to  rule the Rose Kingdom myself, and see that its Laws are obeyed.  Therefore, much as I love you, Shaggy, I must put you to death.\"    \"Wait a minute,\" pleaded Betsy. \"I'd like to see those Royal Gardens  before I die.\"    \"So would I,\" added Shaggy Man. \"Take us there, Gardener.\"    \"Oh, I can't do that,\" objected the Gardener. But Shaggy again showed  him the Love Magnet and after one glance at it the Gardener could no  longer resist.    He led Shaggy, Betsy and Hank to the end of the great greenhouse and  carefully unlocked a small door. Passing through this they came into  the splendid Royal Garden of the Rose Kingdom.    It was all surrounded by a tall hedge and within the enclosure grew  several enormous rosebushes having thick green leaves of the texture of  velvet. Upon these bushes grew the members of the Royal Family of the  Rose Kingdom--men, women and children in all stages of maturity. They  all seemed to have a light green hue, as if unripe or not fully  developed, their flesh and clothing being alike green. They stood  perfectly lifeless upon their branches, which swayed softly in the  breeze, and their wide open eyes stared straight ahead, unseeing and  unintelligent.    While examining these curious growing people, Betsy passed behind a big  central bush and at once uttered an exclamation of surprise and  pleasure. For there, blooming in perfect color and shape, stood a Royal  Princess, whose beauty was amazing.    \"Why, she's ripe!\" cried Betsy, pushing aside some of the broad leaves  to observe her more clearly.    \"Well, perhaps so,\" admitted the Gardener, who had come to the girl's  side; \"but she's a girl, and so we can't use her for a Ruler.\"    \"No, indeed!\" came a chorus of soft voices, and looking around Betsy  discovered that all the Roses had followed them from the greenhouse and  were now grouped before the entrance.    \"You see,\" explained the Gardener, \"the subjects of Rose Kingdom don't  want a girl Ruler. They want a King.\"    \"A King! We want a King!\" repeated the chorus of Roses.    \"Isn't she Royal?\" inquired Shaggy, admiring the lovely Princess.    \"Of course, for she grows on a Royal Bush. This Princess is named Ozga,  as she is a distant cousin of Ozma of Oz; and, were she but a man, we  would joyfully hail her as our Ruler.\"    The Gardener then turned away to talk with his Roses and Betsy  whispered to her companion: \"Let's pick her, Shaggy.\"    \"All right,\" said he. \"If she's royal, she has the right to rule this  Kingdom, and if we pick her she will surely protect us and prevent our  being hurt, or driven away.\"    So Betsy and Shaggy each took an arm of the beautiful Rose Princess and  a little twist of her feet set her free of the branch upon which she  grew. Very gracefully she stepped down from the bush to the ground,  where she bowed low to Betsy and Shaggy and said in a delightfully  sweet voice: \"I thank you.\"    But at the sound of these words the Gardener and the Roses turned and  discovered that the Princess had been picked, and was now alive. Over  every face flashed an expression of resentment and anger, and one of  the Roses cried aloud.    \"Audacious mortals! What have you done?\"    \"Picked a Princess for you, that's all,\" replied Betsy, cheerfully.    \"But we won't have her! We want a King!\" exclaimed a Jacque Rose, and  another added with a voice of scorn: \"No girl shall rule over us!\"    The newly-picked Princess looked from one to another of her rebellious  subjects in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/957"],[0,"The Scarecrow of Oz (#5)"],[1,"is a circle--in which case we can keep  walkin' till doomsday. Not knowin' what's before us so well as we know  what's behind us, I propose we make a stop, now, an' try to sleep till  mornin'.\"    \"That will suit me,\" asserted the Ork, with a groan. \"My feet are  hurting me dreadfully and for the last few miles I've been limping with  pain.\"    \"My foot hurts, too,\" said the sailor, looking for a smooth place on  the rocky floor to sit down.    \"Your foot!\" cried the Ork. \"why, you've only one to hurt you, while I  have four. So I suffer four times as much as you possibly can. Here;  hold the candle while I look at the bottoms of my claws. I declare,\" he  said, examining them by the flickering light, \"there are bunches of  pain all over them!\"    \"P'r'aps,\" said Trot, who was very glad to sit down beside her  companions, \"you've got corns.\"    \"Corns? Nonsense! Orks never have corns,\" protested the creature,  rubbing its sore feet tenderly.    \"Then mebbe they're--they're-- What do you call 'em, Cap'n Bill?  Something 'bout the Pilgrim's Progress, you know.\"    \"Bunions,\" said Cap'n Bill.    \"Oh, yes; mebbe you've got bunions.\"    \"It is possible,\" moaned the Ork.  \"But whatever they are, another day  of such walking on them would drive me crazy.\"    \"I'm sure they'll feel better by mornin',\" said Cap'n Bill,  encouragingly. \"Go to sleep an' try to forget your sore feet.\"    The Ork cast a reproachful look at the sailor-man, who didn't see it.  Then the creature asked plaintively: \"Do we eat now, or do we starve?\"    \"There's only half a biscuit left for you,\" answered Cap'n Bill. \"No  one knows how long we'll have to stay in this dark tunnel, where  there's nothing whatever to eat; so I advise you to save that morsel o'  food till later.\"    \"Give it me now!\" demanded the Ork. \"If I'm going to starve, I'll do it  all at once--not by degrees.\"    Cap'n Bill produced the biscuit and the creature ate it in a trice.  Trot was rather hungry and whispered to Cap'n Bill that she'd take part  of her share; but the old man secretly broke his own half-biscuit in  two, saving Trot's share for a time of greater need.    He was beginning to be worried over the little girl's plight and long  after she was asleep and the Ork was snoring in a rather disagreeable  manner, Cap'n Bill sat with his back to a rock and smoked his pipe and  tried to think of some way to escape from this seemingly endless  tunnel. But after a time he also slept, for hobbling on a wooden leg  all day was tiresome, and there in the dark slumbered the three  adventurers for many hours, until the Ork roused itself and kicked the  old sailor with one foot.    \"It must be another day,\" said he.          Chapter Four    Daylight at Last      Cap'n Bill rubbed his eyes, lit a match and consulted his watch.    \"Nine o'clock.  Yes, I guess it's another day, sure enough. Shall we go  on?\" he asked.    \"Of course,\" replied the Ork. \"Unless this tunnel is different from  everything else in the world, and has no end, we'll find a way out of  it sooner or later.\"    The sailor gently wakened Trot. She felt much rested by her long sleep  and sprang to her feet eagerly.    \"Let's start, Cap'n,\" was all she said.    They resumed the journey and had only taken a few steps when the Ork  cried \"Wow!\" and made a great fluttering of its wings and whirling of  its tail. The others, who were following a short distance behind,  stopped abruptly.    \"What's the matter?\" asked Cap'n Bill.    \"Give us a light,\" was the reply. \"I think we've come to the end of the  tunnel.\" Then, while Cap'n Bill lighted a candle, the creature added:  \"If that is true, we needn't have wakened so soon, for we were almost  at the end of this place when we went to sleep.\"    The sailor-man and Trot came forward with a light. A wall of rock  really faced the tunnel, but now they saw that the opening made a sharp  turn to the left. So they followed on, by a narrower passage, and then  made another sharp turn this time to the right.    \"Blow out the light, Cap'n,\" said the Ork, in a pleased voice. \"We've  struck daylight.\"    Daylight at last! A shaft of mellow light fell almost at their feet as  Trot and the sailor turned the corner of the passage, but it came from  above, and raising their eyes they found they were at the bottom of a  deep, rocky well, with the top far, far above their heads. And here the  passage ended.    For a while they gazed in silence, at least two of them being filled  with dismay at the sight. But the Ork merely whistled softly and said  cheerfully:    \"That was the toughest journey I ever had the misfortune to undertake,  and I'm glad it's over. Yet, unless I can manage to fly to the top of  this pit, we are entombed here forever.\"    \"Do you think there is room enough for you to fly in?\" asked the little  girl anxiously; and Cap'n Bill added:    \"It's a straight-up shaft, so I don't see how you'll ever manage it.\"    \"Were I an ordinary bird--one of those horrid feathered things--I  wouldn't even make the attempt to fly out,\" said the Ork.  \"But my  mechanical propeller tail can accomplish wonders, and whenever you're  ready I'll show you a trick that is worth while.\"    \"Oh!\" exclaimed Trot; \"do you intend to take us up, too?\"    \"Why not?\"    \"I thought,\" said Cap'n Bill, \"as you'd go first, an' then send  somebody to help us by lettin' down a rope.\"    \"Ropes are dangerous,\" replied the Ork, \"and I might not be able to  find one to reach all this distance. Besides, it stands to reason that  if I can get out myself I can also carry you two with me.\"    \"Well, I'm not afraid,\" said Trot, who longed to be on the earth's  surface again.    \"S'pose we fall?\" suggested Cap'n Bill, doubtfully.    \"Why, in that case we would all fall together,\" returned the Ork. \"Get  aboard, little girl; sit across my shoulders and put both your arms  around my neck.\"    Trot obeyed and when she was seated on the Ork, Cap'n Bill inquired:    \"How 'bout me, Mr. Ork?\"    \"Why, I think you'd best grab hold of my rear legs and let me carry you  up in that manner,\" was the reply.    Cap'n Bill looked way up at the top of the well, and then he looked at  the Ork's slender, skinny legs and heaved a deep sigh.    \"It's goin' to be some dangle, I guess; but if you don't waste too much  time on the way up, I may be able to hang on,\" said he.    \"All ready, then!\" cried the Ork, and at once his whirling tail began  to revolve. Trot felt herself rising into the air; when the creature's  legs left the ground Cap'n Bill grasped two of them firmly and held on  for dear life.  The Ork's body was tipped straight upward, and Trot had  to embrace the neck very tightly to keep from sliding off. Even in this  position the Ork had trouble in escaping the rough sides of the well.  Several times it exclaimed \"Wow!\" as it bumped its back, or a wing hit  against some jagged projection; but the tail kept whirling with  remarkable swiftness and the daylight grew brighter and brighter. It  was, indeed, a long journey from the bottom to the top, yet almost  before Trot realized they had come so far, they popped out of the hole  into the clear air and sunshine and a moment later the Ork alighted  gently upon the ground.    The release was so sudden that even with the creature's care for its  passengers Cap'n Bill struck the earth with a shock that sent him  rolling heel over head; but by the time Trot had slid down from her  seat the old sailor-man was sitting up and looking around him with much  satisfaction.    \"It's sort o' pretty here,\" said he.    \"Earth is a beautiful place!\" cried Trot.    \"I wonder where on earth we are?\" pondered the Ork, turning first one  bright eye and then the other to this side and that. Trees there were,  in plenty, and shrubs and flowers and green turf. But there were no  houses; there were no paths; there was no sign of civilization whatever.    \"Just before I settled down on the ground I thought I caught a view of  the ocean,\" said the Ork. \"Let's see if I was right.\" Then he flew to a  little hill, near by, and Trot and Cap'n Bill followed him more slowly.  When they stood on the top of the hill they could see the blue waves of  the ocean in front of them, to the right of them, and at the left of  them. Behind the hill was a forest that shut out the view.    \"I hope it ain't an island, Trot,\" said Cap'n Bill gravely.    \"If it is, I s'pose we're prisoners,\" she replied.    \"Ezzackly so, Trot.\"    \"But, 'even so, it's better than those terr'ble underground tunnels and  caverns,\" declared the girl.    \"You are right, little one,\" agreed the Ork. \"Anything above ground is  better than the best that lies under ground. So let's not quarrel with  our fate but be thankful we've escaped.\"    \"We are, indeed!\" she replied. \"But I wonder if we can find something  to eat in this place?\"    \"Let's explore an' find out,\" proposed Cap'n Bill. \"Those trees over at  the left look like cherry-trees.\"    On the way to them the explorers had to walk through a tangle of vines  and Cap'n Bill, who went first, stumbled and pitched forward on his  face.    \"Why, it's a melon!\" cried Trot delightedly, as she saw what had caused  the sailor to fall.    Cap'n Bill rose to his foot, for he was not at all hurt, and examined  the melon. Then he took his big jackknife from his pocket and cut the  melon open. It was quite ripe and looked delicious; but the old man  tasted it before he permitted Trot to eat any. Deciding it was good he  gave her a big slice and then offered the Ork some. The creature looked  at the fruit somewhat disdainfully, at first, but once he had tasted  its flavor he ate of it as heartily as did the others. Among the vines  they discovered many other melons, and Trot said gratefully: \"Well,  there's no danger of our starving, even if this is an island.\"    \"Melons,\" remarked Cap'n Bill, \"are both food an' water. We couldn't  have struck anything better.\"    Farther on they came to the"]]]
