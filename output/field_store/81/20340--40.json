I cleared a little earth from it, and, finding that it  seemed part of a large mass, determined to investigate it. The workmen  I sent for unearthed an oblong vault some eight feet below the surface,  and set in the corner of what had evidently been the foundation walls  of an ancient house. A layer of ashes and charcoal on the top of the  vault showed that the house above had perished by fire. The vault  itself was perfectly intact, the cement being as good as when first  applied. It had a door, but this we could not force, and found entrance  by removing one of the flagstones which formed the roof. The air which  came up was stagnant but pure, dry and not cold. Descending with a  lantern, I found myself in an apartment fitted up as a bedroom in the  style of the nineteenth century. On the bed lay a young man. That he  was dead and must have been dead a century was of course to be taken  for granted; but the extraordinary state of preservation of the body  struck me and the medical colleagues whom I had summoned with  amazement. That the art of such embalming as this had ever been known  we should not have believed, yet here seemed conclusive testimony that  our immediate ancestors had possessed it. My medical colleagues, whose  curiosity was highly excited, were at once for undertaking experiments  to test the nature of the process employed, but I withheld them. My  motive in so doing, at least the only motive I now need speak of, was  the recollection of something I once had read about the extent to which  your contemporaries had cultivated the subject of animal magnetism. It  had occurred to me as just conceivable that you might be in a trance,  and that the secret of your bodily integrity after so long a time was  not the craft of an embalmer, but life. So extremely fanciful did this  idea seem, even to me, that I did not risk the ridicule of my fellow  physicians by mentioning it, but gave some other reason for postponing  their experiments. No sooner, however, had they left me, than I set on  foot a systematic attempt at resuscitation, of which you know the  result.\"    Had its theme been yet more incredible, the circumstantiality of this  narrative, as well as the impressive manner and personality of the  narrator, might have staggered a listener, and I had begun to feel very  strangely, when, as he closed, I chanced to catch a glimpse of my  reflection in a mirror hanging on the wall of the room. I rose and went  up to it. The face I saw was the face to a hair and a line and not a  day older than the one I had looked at as I tied my cravat before going  to Edith that Decoration Day, which, as this man would have me believe,  was celebrated one hundred and thirteen years before. At this, the  colossal character of the fraud which was being attempted on me, came  over me afresh. Indignation mastered my mind as I realized the  outrageous liberty that had been taken.    \"You are probably surprised,\" said my companion, \"to see that, although  you are a century older than when you lay down to sleep in that  underground chamber, your appearance is unchanged. That should not  amaze you. It is by virtue of the total arrest of the vital functions  that you have survived this great period of time. If your body could  have undergone any change during your trance, it would long ago have  suffered dissolution.\"    \"Sir,\" I replied, turning to him, \"what your motive can be in reciting  to me with a serious face this remarkable farrago, I am utterly unable  to guess; but you are surely yourself too intelligent to suppose that  anybody but an imbecile could be deceived by it. Spare me any more of  this elaborate nonsense and once for all tell me whether you refuse to  give me an intelligible account of where I am and how I came here. If  so, I shall proceed to ascertain my whereabouts for myself, whoever may  hinder.\"    \"You do not, then, believe that this is the year 2000?\"    \"Do you really think it necessary to ask me that?\" I returned.    \"Very well,\" replied my extraordinary host. \"Since I cannot convince  you, you shall convince yourself. Are you strong enough to follow me  upstairs?\"    \"I am as strong as I ever was,\" I replied angrily, \"as I may have to  prove if this jest is carried much farther.\"    \"I beg, sir,\" was my companion's response, \"that you will not allow  yourself to be too fully persuaded that you are the victim of a trick,  lest the reaction, when you are convinced of the truth of my  statements, should be too great.\"    The tone of concern, mingled with commiseration, with which he said  this, and the entire absence of any sign of resentment at my hot words,  strangely daunted me, and I followed him from the room with an  extraordinary mixture of emotions. He led the way up two flights of  stairs and then up a shorter one, which landed us upon a belvedere on  the house-top. \"Be pleased to look around you,\" he said, as we reached  the platform, \"and tell me if this is the Boston of the nineteenth  century.\"    At my feet lay a great city. Miles of broad streets, shaded by trees  and lined with fine buildings, for the most part not in continuous  blocks but set in larger or smaller inclosures, stretched in every  direction. Every quarter contained large open squares filled with  trees, among which statues glistened and fountains flashed in the late  afternoon sun. Public buildings of a colossal size and an architectural  grandeur unparalleled in my day raised their stately piles on every  side. Surely I had never seen this city nor one comparable to it  before. Raising my eyes at last towards the horizon, I looked westward.  That blue ribbon winding away to the sunset, was it not the sinuous  Charles? I looked east; Boston harbor stretched before me within its  headlands, not one of its green islets missing.    I knew then that I had been told the truth concerning the prodigious  thing which had befallen me.        Chapter 4    I did not faint, but the effort to realize my position made me very  giddy, and I remember that my companion had to give me a strong arm as  he conducted me from the roof to a roomy apartment on the upper floor  of the house, where he insisted on my drinking a glass or two of good  wine and partaking of a light repast.    \"I think you are going to be all right now,\" he said cheerily. \"I  should not have taken so abrupt a means to convince you of your  position if your course, while perfectly excusable under the  circumstances, had not rather obliged me to do so. I confess,\" he added  laughing, \"I was a little apprehensive at one time that I should  undergo what I believe you used to call a knockdown in the nineteenth  century, if I did not act rather promptly. I remembered that the  Bostonians of your day were famous pugilists, and thought best to lose  no time. I take it you are now ready to acquit me of the charge of  hoaxing you.\"    \"If you had told me,\" I replied, profoundly awed, \"that a thousand  years instead of a hundred had elapsed since I last looked on this  city, I should now believe you.\"    \"Only a century has passed,\" he answered, \"but many a millennium in the  world's history has seen changes less extraordinary.\"    \"And now,\" he added, extending his hand with an air of irresistible  cordiality, \"let me give you a hearty welcome to the Boston of the  twentieth century and to this house. My name is Leete, Dr. Leete they  call me.\"    \"My name,\" I said as I shook his hand, \"is Julian West.\"    \"I am most happy in making your acquaintance, Mr. West,\" he responded.  \"Seeing that this house is built on the site of your own, I hope you  will find it easy to make yourself at home in it.\"    After my refreshment Dr. Leete offered me a bath and a change of  clothing, of which I gladly availed myself.    It did not appear that any very startling revolution in men's attire  had been among the great changes my host had spoken of, for, barring a  few details, my new habiliments did not puzzle me at all.    Physically, I was now myself again. But mentally, how was it with me,  the reader will doubtless wonder. What were my intellectual sensations,  he may wish to know, on finding myself so suddenly dropped as it were  into a new world. In reply let me ask him to suppose himself suddenly,  in the twinkling of an eye, transported from earth, say, to Paradise or  Hades. What does he fancy would be his own experience? Would his  thoughts return at once to the earth he had just left, or would he,  after the first shock, wellnigh forget his former life for a while,  albeit to be remembered later, in the interest excited by his new  surroundings? All I can say is, that if his experience were at all like  mine in the transition I am describing, the latter hypothesis would  prove the correct one. The impressions of amazement and curiosity which  my new surroundings produced occupied my mind, after the first shock,  to the exclusion of all other thoughts. For the time the memory of my  former life was, as it were, in abeyance.    No sooner did I find myself physically rehabilitated through the kind  offices of my host, than I became eager to return to the house-top; and  presently we were comfortably established there in easy-chairs, with  the city beneath and around us. After Dr. Leete had responded to  numerous questions on my part, as to the ancient landmarks I missed and  the new ones which had replaced them, he asked me what point of the  contrast between the new and the old city struck me most forcibly.    \"To speak of small things before great,\" I responded, \"I really think  that the complete absence of chimneys and their smoke is the detail  that first impressed me.\"    \"Ah!\" ejaculated my companion with an air of much interest, \"I had  forgotten the chimneys, it is so long since they went out of use. It is  nearly a century since the crude method of combustion on which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/626"],[0,"The Love of Books: The Philobiblon of Richard de Bury (#5)"],[1,"about every way to the minds of listeners.  Finally, by the knowledge of literature, we establish Priests, Bishops,  Cardinals, and the Pope, that all things in the ecclesiastical  hierarchy may be fitly disposed.  For it is from books that everything  of good that befalls the clerical condition takes its origin.  But let  this suffice: for it pains us to recall what we have bestowed upon the  degenerate clergy, because whatever gifts are distributed to the  ungrateful seem to be lost rather than bestowed.    Let us next dwell a little on the recital of the wrongs with which they  requite us, the contempts and cruelties of which we cannot recite an  example in each kind, nay, scarcely the main classes of the several  wrongs.  In the first place, we are expelled by force and arms from the  homes of the clergy, which are ours by hereditary right, who were used  to have cells of quietness in the inner chamber, but, alas! in these  unhappy times we are altogether exiled, suffering poverty without the  gates.  For our places are seized now by dogs, now by hawks, now by  that biped beast whose cohabitation with the clergy was forbidden of  old, from which we have always taught our nurslings to flee more than  from the asp and the cockatrice; wherefore she, always jealous of the  love of us, and never to be appeased, at length seeing us in some  corner protected only by the web of some dead spider, with a frown  abuses and reviles us with bitter words, declaring us alone of all the  furniture in the house to be unnecessary, and complaining that we are  useless for any household purpose, and advises that we should speedily  be converted into rich caps, sendal and silk and twice-dyed purple,  robes and furs, wool and linen: and, indeed, not without reason, if she  could see our inmost hearts, if she had listened to our secret  counsels, if she had read the book of Theophrastus or Valerius, or only  heard the twenty-fifth chapter of Ecclesiasticus with understanding  ears.    And hence it is that we have to mourn for the homes of which we have  been unjustly robbed; and as to our coverings, not that they have not  been given to us, but that the coverings anciently given to us have  been torn by violent hands, insomuch that our soul is bowed down to the  dust, our belly cleaveth unto the earth.  We suffer from various  diseases, enduring pains in our backs and sides; we lie with our limbs  unstrung by palsy, and there is no man who layeth it to heart, and no  man who provides a mollifying plaster.  Our native whiteness that was  clear with light has turned to dun and yellow, so that no leech who  should see us would doubt that we are diseased with jaundice.  Some of  us are suffering from gout, as our twisted extremities plainly show.  The smoke and dust by which we are continuously plagued have dulled the  keenness of our visual rays, and are now infecting our bleared eyes  with ophthalmia.  Within we are devoured by the fierce gripings of our  entrails, which hungry worms cease not to gnaw, and we undergo the  corruption of the two Lazaruses, nor is there anyone to anoint us with  balm of cedar, nor to cry to us who have been four days dead and  already stink, Lazarus come forth!  No healing drug is bound around our  cruel wounds, which are so atrociously inflicted upon the innocent, and  there is none to put a plaster upon our ulcers; but ragged and  shivering we are flung away into dark corners, or in tears take our  place with holy Job upon his dunghill, or--too horrible to relate--are  buried in the depths of the common sewers.  The cushion is withdrawn  that should support our evangelical sides, which ought to have the  first claim upon the incomes of the clergy, and the common necessaries  of life thus be for ever provided for us, who are entrusted to their  charge.    Again, we complain of another sort of injury which is too often  unjustly inflicted upon our persons.  We are sold for bondmen and  bondwomen, and lie as hostages in taverns with no one to redeem us.  We  fall a prey to the cruel shambles, where we see sheep and cattle  slaughtered not without pious tears, and where we die a thousand times  from such terrors as might frighten even the brave.  We are handed over  to Jews, Saracens, heretics and infidels, whose poison we always dread  above everything, and by whom it is well known that some of our parents  have been infected with pestiferous venom.  In sooth, we who should be  treated as masters in the sciences, and bear rule over the mechanics  who should be subject to us, are instead handed over to the government  of subordinates, as though some supremely noble monarch should be  trodden under foot by rustic heels.  Any seamster or cobbler or tailor  or artificer of any trade keeps us shut up in prison for the luxurious  and wanton pleasures of the clergy.    Now we would pursue a new kind of injury by which we suffer alike in  person and in fame, the dearest thing we have.  Our purity of race is  diminished every day, while new authors' names are imposed upon us by  worthless compilers, translators, and transformers, and losing our  ancient nobility, while we are reborn in successive generations, we  become wholly degenerate; and thus against our will the name of some  wretched stepfather is affixed to us, and the sons are robbed of the  names of their true fathers.  The verses of Virgil, while he was yet  living, were claimed by an impostor; and a certain Fidentinus  mendaciously usurped the works of Martial, whom Martial thus deservedly  rebuked:           \"The book you read is, Fidentinus! mine,    Though read so badly, 't well may pass for thine!\"      What marvel, then, if when our authors are dead clerical apes use us to  make broad their phylacteries, since even while they are alive they try  to seize us as soon as we are published?  Ah! how often ye pretend that  we who are ancient are but lately born, and try to pass us off as sons  who are really fathers, calling us who have made you clerks the  production of your studies.  Indeed, we derived our origin from Athens,  though we are now supposed to be from Rome; for Carmentis was always  the pilferer of Cadmus, and we who were but lately born in England,  will to-morrow be born again in Paris; and thence being carried to  Bologna, will obtain an Italian origin, based upon no affinity of  blood.  Alas! how ye commit us to treacherous copyists to be written,  how corruptly ye read us and kill us by medication, while ye supposed  ye were correcting us with pious zeal.  Oftentimes we have to endure  barbarous interpreters, and those who are ignorant of foreign idioms  presume to translate us from one language into another; and thus all  propriety of speech is lost and our sense is shamefully mutilated  contrary to the meaning of the author!  Truly noble would have been the  condition of books if it had not been for the presumption of the tower  of Babel, if but one kind of speech had been transmitted by the whole  human race.    We will add the last clause of our long lament, though far too short  for the materials that we have. For in us the natural use is changed to  that which is against nature, while we who are the light of faithful  souls everywhere fall a prey to painters knowing nought of letters, and  are entrusted to goldsmiths to become, as though we were not sacred  vessels of wisdom, repositories of gold-leaf.  We fall undeservedly  into the power of laymen, which is more bitter to us than any death,  since they have sold our people for nought, and our enemies themselves  are our judges.    It is clear from what we have said what infinite invectives we could  hurl against the clergy, if we did not think of our own reputation.  For the soldier whose campaigns are over venerates his shield and arms,  and grateful Corydon shows regard for his decaying team, harrow, flail  and mattock, and every manual artificer for the instruments of his  craft; it is only the ungrateful cleric who despises and neglects those  things which have ever been the foundation of his honours.        CHAPTER V    THE COMPLAINT OF BOOKS AGAINST THE POSSESSIONERS    The venerable devotion of the religious orders is wont to be solicitous  in the care of books and to delight in their society, as if they were  the only riches.  For some used to write them with their own hands  between the hours of prayer, and gave to the making of books such  intervals as they could secure and the times appointed for the  recreation of the body.  By whose labours there are resplendent to-day  in most monasteries these sacred treasuries full of cherubic letters,  for giving the knowledge of salvation to the student and a delectable  light to the paths of the laity.  O manual toil, happier than any  agricultural task!  O devout solicitude, where neither Martha nor Mary  deserves to be rebuked!  O joyful house, in which the fruitful Leah  does not envy the beauteous Rachel, but action and contemplation share  each other's joys!  O happy charge, destined to benefit endless  generations of posterity, with which no planting of trees, no sowing of  seeds, no pastoral delight in herds, no building of fortified camps can  be compared!  Wherefore the memory of those fathers should be immortal,  who delighted only in the treasures of wisdom, who most laboriously  provided shining lamps against future darkness, and against hunger of  hearing the Word of God, most carefully prepared, not bread baked in  the ashes, nor of barley, nor musty, but unleavened loaves made of the  finest wheat of divine wisdom, with which hungry souls might be  joyfully fed These men were the stoutest champions of the Christian  army, who defended our weakness by their most valiant arms; they were  in their time the most cunning takers of foxes, who have left us their  nets, that we might catch the young foxes, who cease not to devour the  growing vines.  Of a truth, noble fathers, worthy of perpetual"]]]
