After a time, he removed from Sharon, and later, in  1815, left the State of Vermont, locating at Palmyra, Ontario County,  New York: in which place and the adjoining town of Manchester, whither  the family moved four years afterward, they dwelt for several years.  Here they engaged in clearing land and farming, the boys, including  the young Joseph, giving their constant aid to the family work. With  the severest toil they could only compass a frugal mode of life. But  they wasted no time in useless repining. They were able to pay their  obligations, to maintain their honest name, to live in happiness, and  to devote some hours of each week to the rudimentary education of the  younger children.    The offspring of Joseph and Lucy Smith, with the dates and places of  their birth, are named as follow: [1]    Alvin, born February 11th, 1798, at Tunbridge, Vermont.    Hyrum, born February 9th, 1800, at Tunbridge, Vermont.    Sophronia, born May 18th, 1803, at Tunbridge, Vermont.    Joseph, born December 23rd, 1805, at Sharon, Vermont.    Samuel, born March 13th, 1808, at Tunbridge, Vermont.    Ephraim, born March 13th, 1810, at Royalton, Vermont.    William, born March 13th, 1811, at Royalton, Vermont.    Catherine, born July 8th, 1812, at Lebanon, New Hampshire.    Don Carlos, born March 25th, 1816, probably at Palmyra, New York.    Lucy, born July 18th, 1821, probably at Palmyra, New York.    The first quarter of the nineteenth century was a time of intense  religious excitement, and New York and surrounding states were the  scenes of many revivals and much strife. Not only among preachers and  exhorters was the enthusiasm manifested, but the people themselves  became much exercised over their sinful condition, and ran here and  there in a wild search for the salvation for which their souls seemed  to yearn. The movement originated with the Methodists; but it soon  spread to other sects in the neighborhood, until the whole region was  infected by it, and the greatest excitement was created, in which all  the good effects of a revival were swallowed up in bitter contests of  opinions and the strife of words between the adherents of the various  creeds.    The Smith family inclined towards the Presbyterian faith, and the  mother, two sons and a daughter united themselves with that church.  Joseph was at the time in his fifteenth year--just at an age, with his  limited experience, he might be deemed most susceptible to the example  of others. He listened and considered, yet could not profess the faith  of his family. The clergymen of other sects assailed him; but although  he became somewhat partial to the Methodist creed, their soft words and  direful threats were alike unavailing. The tempest could not reach the  depths of the boy's nature. Unknown to himself he was awaiting the hour  when the divine message should stir the waters of his soul.    Footnotes    1. See NOTE 1., APPENDIX.        CHAPTER III.    LIGHT FROM THE SCRIPTURES--THE PRAYER AND ITS ANSWER--\"THIS IS MY  BELOVED SON: HEAR HIM\"--PERSECUTION AND SCOFFING OF THE MULTITUDE--  JOSEPH DOUBTS HIMSELF AND SUPPLICATES FOR RENEWED HELP.    Joseph was earnest beyond his years; but he was not of a nature to  become a prey to morbid feelings. He was neither terrified by the  awful threats of the revivalists into a ready acceptance of their  dogmas, nor driven by their divisions and strife into unbelief in  revealed religion. The all-absorbing question with him was: Which  of these churches is the church of Christ? Under the influence of  his great desire to know the truth and the correct path which led to  salvation, he made a thoughtful analysis of the proffered creeds. Can  it be wondered at that he was bewildered in the labyrinth of paths,  each of which claimed to be the heavenly way? When at divers times he  thought of uniting himself with some one of the churches, his further  investigation each time revealed some false mysteries. Dissatisfied  with their claims and pretensions, and conscious of his own want of  knowledge and how easily he might err in a matter of such vital and  eternal importance, he was led to seek for guidance from a righteous  source. He had recourse to the word of God.    Searching the scriptures for comfort and light, one happy and most  fortunate moment he read these sacred words:    \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men  liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\"    Like a flash of sunlight through lowering clouds, the import of a  mighty truth burst upon Joseph's mind. He had been vainly asking help  from men who had answered him out of their own darkness. He determined  now to seek assistance from God. A modest fear might suggest: Who was  he that he should dare to approach the great Creator's throne? But  there was the plain promise. He could not doubt it, without doubting  his Maker. He felt that he lacked wisdom; and to such as he, asking of  God, there was the divine pledge to hear and give without upbraiding.    It was one morning in early springtime of the year 1820, that Joseph  felt the earnest prompting and adopted the holy resolve. He walked into  the depths of a wood, which stood near his home, and sought a little  glade. There, in trembling humility, but with a faith which thrilled  his soul--alone, unseen of man, he fell upon his knees and lifted his  voice in prayer to God. While he was calling upon the Almighty, a  subtle and malignant power seized him and stilled his utterance. Deep  darkness enveloped him; he felt that he was in the grasp of Satan,  and that the destroyer was exerting all the power of hell to drag him  to sudden destruction. In his agony he called anew upon the Lord for  deliverance; and at the moment when he seemed to be sinking under the  power of the evil one, the deep gloom was rolled away and he saw a  brilliant light. A pillar of celestial fire, far more glorious than  the brightness of the noon-day sun, appeared directly above him. The  defeated power fled with the darkness; and Joseph's spirit was free to  worship and marvel at his deliverance. Gradually the light descended  until it rested upon him; and he saw, standing above him in the air,  enveloped in the pure radiance of the fiery pillar, two personages of  incomparable beauty, alike in form and feature, and clad alike in snowy  raiment. Sublime, dazzling, they filled his soul with awe. At length,  One, calling Joseph by name, stretched His shining arm towards the  other, and said:    \"THIS IS MY BELOVED SON: HEAR HIM!\"    As soon as Joseph could regain possession of himself, to which he was  encouraged by the benign and comforting look of the Son, and by the  heavenly bliss which pervaded his own soul, he found words to ask,  which of all the multitude of churches upon the face of the globe had  the gospel of Christ; for up to this time it had never entered his mind  to doubt that the true church of the Lamb, pure and undefiled, had  an existence somewhere among men. But the answer came that no one of  the creeds of earth was pure, and that Joseph must unite himself with  none of them. Said the glorious Being: \"THEY DRAW NEAR ME WITH THEIR  LIPS, BUT THEIR HEARTS ARE FAR FROM ME; THEY TEACH FOR THE DOCTRINE  THE COMMANDMENTS OF MEN, HAVING A FORM OF GODLINESS, BUT THEY DENY THE  POWER THEREOF.\"    Even in the transport of his vision, Joseph felt amazed at the  instruction. But the Heavenly Personages continued to commune with him,  and repeated Their command that he should not ally himself with any  of the man-made sects. Then They and Their enclosing pillar of light  passed from his gaze, and he was left to look into the immensity of  space.    The boy's faith in the promises of God had now deepened into knowledge.  He had been assailed by the power of evil, until it seemed he must  succumb--that the limit of human endurance was passed. And in that  instant of deepest despair, he had been suddenly transported into the  blaze of celestial light. He had seen with his own eyes the Father and  the Son, with his own ears he had heard Their eternal voice. Over this  untaught youth at least, the Heavens were no longer as brass. He had  emerged from the maze of doubt and uncertainty in which he had so long  groped, and had received positive assurances on the matter nearest his  heart from Him, whom to know was anciently declared to be life eternal.    Emboldened, satisfied, and happy beyond expression, Joseph's first  thought was of his loved ones. He must impart the glorious truth to  them. His parents and his brethren listened, and were lost in awe  at his straightforward recital. He next sought his old friends the  ministers, those who had affected such an interest in his welfare and  who would nave so willingly acted as his guides toward heaven. His  first experience with these gentlemen was somewhat discouraging. A  Methodist preacher who had formerly cultivated the utmost friendship,  and who probably had acquired considerable influence with him, was  soon informed by Joseph of the Heavenly manifestation. The pious man  treated the communication with contempt, and curtly replied that  there were no such things as visions or revelations in these days,  they having ceased with the Apostles, and that the whole thing was of  the Devil. Other ministers, and in fact the religious portion of the  entire neighborhood, as the event became more widely known, united in  the determination to overwhelm with ridicule and abuse that which they  found themselves unable to silence by argument.    Joseph had been a great favorite among his neighbors, his gentle ways  had made him beloved by all; he now was hated and reviled. He had  been especially sought after by the clergy because of his diligence,  earnestness and humility in striving to secure the grace of God; he now  was stigmatized as a dissolute dreamer, a worthless knave and an an  arrant hypocrite.

Far from shunning the attack, Yawkins sprung forward,  shouting, 'Come on, my lads; Yawkins is before you.' The revenue officers  were intimidated and relinquished their prize, though defended only by  the courage and address of a single man. On his proper element Yawkins  was equally successful. On one occasion he was landing his cargo at the  Manxman's Lake near Kirkcudbright, when two revenue cutters (the 'Pigmy'  and the 'Dwarf') hove in sight at once on different tacks, the one coming  round by the Isles of Fleet, the other between the point of Rueberry and  the Muckle Ron. The dauntless freetrader instantly weighed anchor and  bore down right between the luggers, so close that he tossed his hat on  the deck of the one and his wig on that of the other, hoisted a cask to  his maintop, to show his occupation, and bore away under an extraordinary  pressure of canvass, without receiving injury. To account for these and  other hairbreadth escapes, popular superstition alleged that Yawkins  insured his celebrated buckkar by compounding with the devil for  one-tenth of his crew every voyage. How they arranged the separation of  the stock and tithes is left to our conjecture. The buckkar was perhaps  called the 'Black Prince' in honour of the formidable insurer.    The 'Black Prince' used to discharge her cargo at Luce, Balcarry, and  elsewhere on the coast; but her owner's favourite landing-places were at  the entrance of the Dee and the Cree, near the old Castle of Rueberry,  about six miles below Kirkcudbright. There is a cave of large dimensions  in the vicinity of Rueberry, which, from its being frequently used by  Yawkins and his supposed connexion with the smugglers on the shore, is  now called Dirk Hatteraick's Cave. Strangers who visit this place, the  scenery of which is highly romantic, are also shown, under the name of  the Gauger's Loup, a tremendous precipice, being the same, it is  asserted, from which Kennedy was precipitated.    Meg Merrilies is in Galloway considered as having had her origin in the  traditions concerning the celebrated Flora Marshal, one of the royal  consorts of Willie Marshal, more commonly called the Caird of Barullion,  King of the Gipsies of the Western Lowlands. That potentate was himself  deserving of notice from the following peculiarities:--He was born in the  parish of Kirkmichael about the year 1671; and, as he died at  Kirkcudbright 23d November 1792, he must then have been in the one  hundred and twentieth year of his age. It cannot be said that this  unusually long lease of existence was noted by any peculiar excellence of  conduct or habits of life. Willie had been pressed or enlisted in the  army seven times, and had deserted as often; besides three times running  away from the naval service. He had been seventeen times lawfully  married; and, besides, such a reasonably large share of matrimonial  comforts, was, after his hundredth year, the avowed father of four  children by less legitimate affections. He subsisted in his extreme old  age by a pension from the present Earl of Selkirk's grandfather. Will  Marshal is buried in Kirkcudbright church, where his monument is still  shown, decorated with a scutcheon suitably blazoned with two tups' horns  and two cutty spoons.    In his youth he occasionally took an evening walk on the highway, with  the purpose of assisting travellers by relieving them of the weight of  their purses. On one occasion the Caird of Barullion robbed the Laird of  Bargally at a place between Carsphairn and Dalmellington. His purpose was  not achieved without a severe struggle, in which the gipsy lost his  bonnet, and was obliged to escape, leaving it on the road. A respectable  farmer happened to be the next passenger, and, seeing the bonnet,  alighted, took it up, and rather imprudently put it on his own head. At  this instant Bargally came up with some assistants, and, recognising the  bonnet, charged the farmer of Bantoberick with having robbed him, and  took him into custody. There being some likeness between the parties,  Bargally persisted in his charge, and, though the respectability of the  farmer's character was proved or admitted, his trial before the Circuit  Court came on accordingly. The fatal bonnet lay on the table of the  court. Bargally swore that it was the identical article worn by the man  who robbed him; and he and others likewise deponed that they had found  the accused on the spot where the crime was committed, with the bonnet on  his head. The case looked gloomily for the prisoner, and the opinion of  the judge seemed unfavourable. But there was a person in court who knew  well both who did and who did not commit the crime. This was the Caird of  Barullion, who, thrusting himself up to the bar near the place where  Bargally was standing, suddenly seized on the bonnet, put it on his head,  and, looking the Laird full in the face, asked him, with a voice which  attracted the attention of the court and crowded audience--'Look at me,  sir, and tell me, by the oath you have sworn--Am not _I_ the man who  robbed you between Carsphairn and Dalmellington?' Bargally replied, in  great astonishment, 'By Heaven! you are the very man.' 'You see what sort  of memory this gentleman has,' said the volunteer pleader; 'he swears to  the bonnet whatever features are under it. If you yourself, my Lord, will  put it on your head, he will be willing to swear that your Lordship was  the party who robbed him between Carsphairn and Dalmellington.' The  tenant of Bantoberick was unanimously acquitted; and thus Willie Marshal  ingeniously contrived to save an innocent man from danger, without  incurring any himself, since Bargally's evidence must have seemed to  every one too fluctuating to be relied upon.    While the King of the Gipsies was thus laudably occupied, his royal  consort, Flora, contrived, it is said, to steal the hood from the judge's  gown; for which offence, combined with her presumptive guilt as a gipsy,  she was banished to New England, whence she never returned.    Now, I cannot grant that the idea of Meg Merrilies was, in the first  concoction of the character, derived from Flora Marshal, seeing I have  already said she was identified with Jean Gordon, and as I have not the  Laird of Bargally's apology for charging the same fact on two several  individuals. Yet I am quite content that Meg should be considered as a  representative of her sect and class in general, Flora as well as others.    The other instances in which my Gallovidian readers have obliged me by  assigning to         Airy nothing       A local habitation and a name,    shall also be sanctioned so far as the Author may be entitled to do so. I  think the facetious Joe Miller records a case pretty much in point; where  the keeper of a museum, while showing, as he said, the very sword with  which Balaam was about to kill his ass, was interrupted by one of the  visitors, who reminded him that Balaam was not possessed of a sword, but  only wished for one. 'True, sir,' replied the ready-witted cicerone; 'but  this is the very sword he wished for.' The Author, in application of this  story, has only to add that, though ignorant of the coincidence between  the fictions of the tale and some real circumstances, he is contented to  believe he must unconsciously have thought or dreamed of the last while  engaged in the composition of Guy Mannering.              EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION    TO    GUY MANNERING.      The second essay in fiction of an author who has triumphed in his first  romance is a doubtful and perilous adventure. The writer is apt to become  self-conscious, to remember the advice of his critics,--a fatal  error,--and to tremble before the shadow of his own success. He knows  that he will have many enemies, that hundreds of people will be ready to  find fault and to vow that he is \"written out.\" Scott was not  unacquainted with these apprehensions. After publishing \"Marmion\" he  wrote thus to Lady Abercorn:--    \"No one acquires a certain degree of popularity without exciting an equal  degree of malevolence among those who, either from rivalship or from the  mere wish to pull down what others have set up, are always ready to catch  the first occasion to lower the favoured individual to what they call his  'real standard.' Of this I have enough of experience, and my political  interferences, however useless to my friends, have not failed to make me  more than the usual number of enemies. I am therefore bound, in justice  to myself and to those whose good opinion has hitherto protected me, not  to peril myself too frequently. The naturalists tell us that if you  destroy the web which the spider has just made, the insect must spend  many days in inactivity till he has assembled within his person the  materials necessary to weave another. Now, after writing a work of  imagination one feels in nearly the same exhausted state as the spider. I  believe no man now alive writes more rapidly than I do (no great  recommendation); but I never think of making verses till I have a  sufficient stock of poetical ideas to supply them,--I would as soon join  the Israelites in Egypt in their heavy task of making bricks without  clay. Besides, I know, as a small farmer, that good husbandry consists in  not taking the same crop too frequently from the same soil; and as  turnips come after wheat, according to the best rules of agriculture, I  take it that an edition of Swift will do well after such a scourging crop  as 'Marmiou.'\"    [March 13, 1808. Copied from the Collection of Lady Napier and Ettrick.]    These fears of the brave, then, were not unfamiliar to Scott; but he  audaciously disregarded all of them in the composition of \"Guy  Mannering.\" He had just spun his web, like the spider of his simile, he  had just taken off his intellectual fields the \"scourging crop\" of \"The  Lord of the Isles,\" he had just received "]]]
