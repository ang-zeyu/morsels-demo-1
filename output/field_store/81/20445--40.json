He would have  mourned the death of his father his whole life, had it been right  for a great prince thus to abandon himself to grief. During this  interval the queen, mother to Queen Gulnare, and King Saleh,  together with the princesses their relations, arrived at the  Persian court, and shared their affliction, before they offered any  consolation.    When the month was expired, the king could not refuse admittance to  the grand vizier and the other lords of his court, who besought him  to lay aside his mourning, to show himself to his subjects, and  take upon him the administration of affairs as before.    He showed such great reluctance at their request, that the grand  vizier was forced to take upon himself to say to him; 'Sir, neither  our tears nor yours are capable of restoring life to the good king  your father, though we should lament him all our days. He has  undergone the common law of all men, which subjects them to pay the  indispensable tribute of death. Yet we cannot say absolutely that  he is dead, since we see him in your sacred person. He did not  himself doubt, when he was dying, but that he should revive in you,  and to your majesty it belongs to show that he was not deceived.'    King Beder could no longer oppose such pressing entreaties: he laid  aside his mourning; and after he had resumed the royal habit and  ornaments, he began to provide for the necessities of his kingdom  and subjects with the same care as before his father's death. He  acquitted himself with universal approbation: and as he was exact  in maintaining the ordinances of his predecessor, the people did  not feel they had changed their sovereign.    King Saleh, who had returned to his dominions in the sea with the  queen his mother and the princesses, no sooner saw that King Beder  had resumed the government, at the end of the month than he came  alone to visit him; and King Beder and Queen Gulnare were overjoyed  to see him.    One evening when they rose from table, they talked of various  matters. King Saleh began with the praises of the king his nephew,  and expressed to the queen his sister how glad he was to see him  govern so prudently, all of which had acquired him great  reputation, not among his neighbours only, but more remote princes.  King Beder, who could not bear to hear himself so well spoken of,  and not being willing, through good manners, to interrupt the king  his uncle, turned on one side to sleep, leaning his head against a  cushion that was behind him.    'Sister,' said King Saleh, 'I wonder you have not thought of  marrying him ere this: if I mistake not, he is in his twentieth  year; and, at that age, no prince like him ought to be suffered to  be without a wife. I will think of a wife for him myself, since you  will not, and marry him to some princess of our lower world that  may be worthy of him.'    'Brother,' replied Queen Gulnare, 'I have never thought of it to  this very moment, and I am glad you have spoken of it to me. I like  your proposing one of our princesses; and I desire you to name one  so beautiful and accomplished that the king my son may be obliged  to love her.'    'I know one that will suit,' replied King Saleh, softly; 'but I see  many difficulties to be surmounted, not on the lady's part, as I  hope, but on that of her father. I need only mention to you the  Princess Giauhara, daughter of the king of Samandal.'    'What?' replied Queen Gulnare, 'is not the Princess Giauhara yet  married? I remember to have seen her before I left your palace; she  was then about eighteen months old, and surprisingly beautiful, and  must needs be the wonder of the world. The few years she is older  than the king my son ought not to prevent us from doing our utmost  to bring it about. Let me but know the difficulties that are to be  surmounted, and we will surmount them.'    'Sister,' replied King Saleh, 'the greatest difficulty is, that the  King of Samandal is insupportably vain, looking upon all others as  his inferiors: it is not likely we shall easily get him to enter  into this alliance. For my part, I will go to him in person, and  demand of him the princess his daughter; and, in case he refuses  her, we will address ourselves elsewhere, where we shall be more  favourably heard. For this reason, as you may perceive,' added he,  'it is as well for the king my nephew not to know anything of our  design, lest he should fall in love with the Princess Giauhara,  till we have got the consent of the King of Samandal, in case,  after all, we should not be able to obtain her for him.' They  discoursed a little longer upon this point, and, before they  parted, agreed that King Saleh should forthwith return to his own  dominions, and demand the Princess Giauhara of the King of Samandal  her father, for the King of Persia his nephew.    Now King Beder had heard what they said, and he immediately fell in  love with the Princess Giauhara without having even seen her, and  he lay awake thinking all night. Next day King Saleh took leave of  Queen Gulnare and the king his nephew. The young king, who knew the  king his uncle would not have departed so soon but to go and  promote his happiness without loss of time, changed colour when he  heard him mention his departure. He resolved to desire his uncle to  bring the princess away with him: but only asked him to stay with  him one day more, that they might hunt together. The day for  hunting was fixed, and King Beder had many opportunities of being  alone with his uncle, but he had not the courage to open his mouth.  In the heat of the chase, when King Saleh was separated from him,  and not one of his officers and attendants was near, he alighted  near a rivulet; and having tied his horse to a tree, which, with  several others growing along the banks, afforded a very pleasing  shade, he laid himself down on the grass. He remained a good while  absorbed in thought, without speaking a word.    King Saleh, in the meantime, missing the king his nephew, began to  be much concerned to know what had become of him. He therefore left  his company to go in search of him, and at length perceived him at  a distance. He had observed the day before, and more plainly that  day, that he was not so lively as he used to be; and that if he was  asked a question, he either answered not at all, or nothing to the  purpose. As soon as King Saleh saw him lying in that disconsolate  posture, he immediately guessed he had heard what passed between  him and Queen Gulnare. He hereupon alighted at some distance from  him, and having tied his horse to a tree, came upon him so softly,  that he heard him say to himself:    'Amiable princess of the kingdom of Samandal, I would this moment  go and offer you my heart, if I knew where to find you.'    King Saleh would hear no more; he advanced immediately, and showed  himself to King Beder. 'From what I see, nephew,' said he, 'you  heard what the queen your mother and I said the other day of the  Princess Giauhara. It was not our intention you should have known  anything, and we thought you were asleep.'    'My dear uncle,' replied King Beder, 'I heard every word, but was  ashamed to disclose to you my weakness. I beseech you to pity me,  and not wait to procure me the consent of the divine Giauhara till  you have gained the consent of the King of Samandal that I may  marry his daughter.'    These words of the King of Persia greatly embarrassed King Saleh.  He represented to him how difficult it was, and that he could not  well do it without carrying him along with him; which might be of  dangerous consequence, since his presence was so absolutely  necessary in his kingdom. He begged him to wait. But these reasons  were not sufficient to satisfy the King of Persia.    'Cruel Uncle,' said he, 'I find you do not love me so much as you  pretended, and that you had rather see me die than grant the first  request I ever made you.'    'I am ready to convince your majesty,' replied King Saleh, 'that I  would do anything to serve you; but as for carrying you along with  me, I cannot do that till I have spoken to the queen your mother.  What would she say of you and me? If she consents, I am ready to do  all you would have me, and I will join my entreaties to yours.'    'If you do really love me,' replied the King of Persia impatiently,  'as you would have me believe you do, you must return to your  kingdom immediately, and carry me along with you.'    King Saleh, finding himself obliged to yield to his nephew, drew  from his finger a ring, on which were engraven the same mysterious  names that were upon Solomon's seal, that had wrought so many  wonders by their virtue. 'Here, take this ring,' said he, 'put it  upon your finger, and fear neither the waters of the sea, nor their  depth.'    The King of Persia took the ring, and when he had put it on his  finger, King Saleh said to him, 'Do as I do.' At the same time they  both mounted lightly up into the air, and made towards the sea  which was not far distant, whereinto they both plunged.    The sea-king was not long in getting to his palace with the King of  Persia, whom he immediately carried to the queen's apartment, and  presented him to her. The King of Persia kissed the queen his  grandmother's hands, and she embraced him with great joy. 'I do not  ask you how you are,' said she to him; 'I see you are very well,  and I am rejoiced at it; but I desire to know how is my daughter,  your mother, Queen Gulnare?'    The King of Persia told her the queen his mother was in perfect  health. Then the queen presented him to the princesses; and while  he was in conversation with them, she left him, and went with King  Saleh, who told her how the King of Persia was fallen in love with  the Princess Giauhara, and that he had brought him along with him,  without being able to hinder it.    Although King Saleh was, to do him justice, perfectly innocent, yet  the queen could hardly forgive his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8642"],[0,"Woman in the Nineteenth Century (#5)"],[1,"  that of the champions of the enslaved African. And this band it is,  which, partly from a natural following out of principles, partly  because many women have been prominent in that cause, makes, just now,  the warmest appeal in behalf of Woman.    Though there has been a growing liberality on this subject, yet  society at large is not so prepared for the demands of this party, but  that its members are, and will be for some time, coldly regarded as  the Jacobins of their day.    \"Is it not enough,\" cries the irritated trader, \"that you have done  all you could to break up the national union, and thus destroy the  prosperity of our country, but now you must be trying to break up  family union, to take my wife away from the cradle and the  kitchen-hearth to vote at polls, and preach from a pulpit? Of course,  if she does such things, she cannot attend to those of her own sphere.  She is happy enough as she is. She has more leisure than I  have,--every means of improvement, every indulgence.\"    \"Have you asked her whether she was satisfied with these  _indulgences_?\"    \"No, but I know she is. She is too amiable to desire what would make  me unhappy, and too judicious to wish to step beyond the sphere of her  sex. I will never consent to have our peace disturbed by any such  discussions.\"    \"'Consent--you?' it is not consent from you that is in question--it is  assent from your wife.\"    \"Am not I the head of my house?\"    \"You are not the head of your wife. God has given her a mind of her own.    \"I am the head, and she the heart.\"    \"God grant you play true to one another, then! I suppose I am to be  grateful that you did not say she was only the hand. If the head  represses no natural pulse of the heart, there can be no question as  to your giving your consent. Both will be of one accord, and there  needs but to present any question to get a full and true answer. There  is no need of precaution, of indulgence, nor consent. But our doubt is  whether the heart _does_ consent with the head, or only obeys its  decrees with a passiveness that precludes the exercise of its natural  powers, or a repugnance that turns sweet qualities to bitter, or a  doubt that lays waste the fair occasions of life. It is to ascertain  the truth that we propose some liberating measures.\"    Thus vaguely are these questions proposed and discussed at present.  But their being proposed at all implies much thought, and suggests  more. Many women are considering within themselves what they need that  they have not, and what they can have if they find they need it. Many  men are considering whether women are capable of being and having more  than they are and have, _and_ whether, if so, it will be best to  consent to improvement in their condition.    This morning, I open the Boston \"Daily Mail,\" and find in its \"poet's  corner\" a translation of Schiller's \"Dignity of Woman.\" In the  advertisement of a book on America, I see in the table of contents  this sequence, \"Republican Institutions. American Slavery. American  Ladies.\"    I open the \"_Deutsche Schnellpost_\" published in New York, and  find at the head of a column, _Juden und Frauenemancipation in  Ungarn_--\"Emancipation of Jews and Women in Hungary.\"    The past year has seen action in the Rhode Island legislature, to  secure married women rights over their own property, where men showed  that a very little examination of the subject could teach them much;  an article in the Democratic Review on the same subject more largely  considered, written by a woman, impelled, it is said, by glaring wrong  to a distinguished friend, having shown the defects in the existing  laws, and the state of opinion from which they spring; and on answer  from the revered old man, J. Q. Adams, in some respects the Phocion of  his time, to an address made him by some ladies. To this last I shall  again advert in another place.    These symptoms of the times have come under my view quite  accidentally: one who seeks, may, each month or week, collect more.    The numerous party, whose opinions are already labeled and adjusted  too much to their mind to admit of any new light, strive, by lectures  on some model-woman of bride-like beauty and gentleness, by writing  and lending little treatises, intended to mark out with precision the  limits of Woman's sphere, and Woman's mission, to prevent other than  the rightful shepherd from climbing the wall, or the flock from using  any chance to go astray.    Without enrolling ourselves at once on either side, let us look upon  the subject from the best point of view which to-day offers; no  better, it is to be feared, than a high house-top. A high hill-top, or  at least a cathedral-spire, would be desirable.    It may well be an Anti-Slavery party that pleads for Woman, if we  consider merely that she does not hold property on equal terms with  men; so that, if a husband dies without making a will, the wife,  instead of taking at once his place as head of the family, inherits  only a part of his fortune, often brought him by herself, as if she  were a child, or ward only, not an equal partner.    We will not speak of the innumerable instances in which profligate and  idle men live upon the earnings of industrious wives; or if the wives  leave them, and take with them the children, to perform the double  duty of mother and father, follow from place to place, and threaten to  rob them of the children, if deprived of the rights of a husband, as  they call them, planting themselves in their poor lodgings,  frightening them into paying tribute by taking from them the children,  running into debt at the expense of these otherwise so overtasked  helots. Such instances count up by scores within my own memory. I have  seen the husband who had stained himself by a long course of low vice,  till his wife was wearied from her heroic forgiveness, by finding that  his treachery made it useless, and that if she would provide bread for  herself and her children, she must be separate from his ill fame--I  have known this man come to install himself in the chamber of a woman  who loathed him, and say she should never take food without his  company. I have known these men steal their children, whom they knew  they had no means to maintain, take them into dissolute company,  expose them to bodily danger, to frighten the poor woman, to whom, it  seems, the fact that she alone had borne the pangs of their birth, and  nourished their infancy, does not give an equal right to them. I do  believe that this mode of kidnapping--and it is frequent enough in all  classes of society--will be by the next age viewed as it is by Heaven  now, and that the man who avails himself of the shelter of men's laws  to steal from a mother her own children, or arrogate any superior  right in them, save that of superior virtue, will bear the stigma he  deserves, in common with him who steals grown men from their  mother-land, their hopes, and their homes.    I said, we will not speak of this now; yet I _have_ spoken, for  the subject makes me feel too much. I could give instances that would  startle the most vulgar and callous; but I will not, for the public  opinion of their own sex is already against such men, and where cases  of extreme tyranny are made known, there is private action in the  wife's favor. But she ought not to need this, nor, I think, can she  long. Men must soon see that as, on their own ground, Woman is the  weaker party, she ought to have legal protection, which would make  such oppression impossible. But I would not deal with \"atrocious  instances,\" except in the way of illustration, neither demand from men  a partial redress in some one matter, but go to the root of the whole.  If principles could be established, particulars would adjust  themselves aright. Ascertain the true destiny of Woman; give her  legitimate hopes, and a standard within herself; marriage and all  other relations would by degrees be harmonized with these.    But to return to the historical progress of this matter. Knowing that  there exists in the minds of men a tone of feeling toward women as  toward slaves, such as is expressed in the common phrase, \"Tell that  to women and children;\" that the infinite soul can only work through  them in already ascertained limits; that the gift of reason, Man's  highest prerogative, is allotted to them in much lower degree; that  they must be kept from mischief and melancholy by being constantly  engaged in active labor, which is to be furnished and directed by  those better able to think, &c., &c.,--we need not multiply instances,  for who can review the experience of last week without recalling words  which imply, whether in jest or earnest, these views, or views like  these,--knowing this, can we wonder that many reformers think that  measures are not likely to be taken in behalf of women, unless their  wishes could be publicly represented by women?    \"That can never be necessary,\" cry the other side. \"All men are  privately influenced by women; each has his wife, sister, or female  friends, and is too much biased by these relations to fail of  representing their interests; and, if this is not enough, let them  propose and enforce their wishes with the pen. The beauty of home  would be destroyed, the delicacy of the sex be violated, the dignity  of halls of legislation degraded, by an attempt to introduce them  there. Such duties are inconsistent with those of a mother;\" and then  we have ludicrous pictures of ladies in hysterics at the polls, and  senate-chambers filled with cradles.    But if, in reply, we admit as truth that Woman seems destined by  nature rather for the inner circle, we must add that the arrangements  of civilized life have not been, as yet, such as to secure it to her.  Her circle, if the duller, is not the quieter. If kept from  \"excitement,\" she is not from drudgery. Not only the Indian squaw  carries the burdens of the camp, but the favorites"]]]
