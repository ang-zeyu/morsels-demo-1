[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9793"],[0,"Josephus (#5)"],[1,"Jews should rule the world. The people looked for the  realization of the prophecy of Isaiah (41:2), \"He shall raise up the  righteous one from the East, give the nations before Israel, and make  him rule over kings.\"    The belief in the approach of the Messianic kingdom was undoubtedly one  of the mainsprings of the revolt. There had been a series of popular  leaders claiming to be Messiahs, but in the final struggle it was not  the claim of any individual, but the passionate faith of the whole  people, that inspired a belief in the coming of a perfect deliverance.  Some events appeared to favor the fulfilment of their hopes of temporal  sovereignty, bred though they were of despair. Rome under the corrupting  influence of Nero seemed to be passing her zenith; national movements  were stirring in the West, in Gaul and in Germany; in the East the  Parthians were again threatening the security of the Roman provinces.  The Jewish cause, on the other hand, seemed to be gaining ground  everywhere. Its converts, numerous in the West, were still more numerous  and important in the East. Among those recently brought over to the true  faith as full proselytes were Helena, the queen of Adiabene, a kingdom  situate in Mesopotamia, and her son Izates, who built themselves  splendid palaces at Jerusalem. In Babylon the Jews had made themselves  almost independent, and waged open war on the Parthian satraps. A large  section of the people cherished a somewhat simple theodicy. How could  God allow the wicked and dissolute Romans to prosper and the chosen  people to be oppressed? The Hellenistic writers of Sibylline oracles and  the Hebrew writers of Apocalypses, imitating the doom-songs of Isaiah  and Ezekiel, announced the coming overthrow of evil and the triumph of  good. Evil had reached its acme in Nero, and the time had come when God  would break the \"fourth horn\" of Daniel's vision (ch. 8), and exalt his  chosen people.    The fight for national independence was bound to have come, for nothing  could have prevented the Romans from their attempt to crush the spirit  of the Jews, and nothing could have held back the Jews from making a  supreme effort to obtain their freedom from the hated yoke. For one  hundred and twenty years Palestine had been ground beneath the iron heel  of Roman governors and Romanizing tyrants. The conditions of the foreign  rule had steadily grown more intolerable. At first the oppression was  mainly fiscal; then it had sought to crush all political liberty, and  finally it had come to outrage the deepest religious feeling and menace  the Temple-worship. As Graetz says, \"The Jewish people was like a  captive, who, continually visited by his jailer, rattles at his fetters  with the strength of despair, till he wrenches them asunder.\" It was not  only the freedom of the Jew, but the safety of Judaism that was  imperiled by the misrule of a Claudius and a Nero. The war against the  Romans was then not merely a struggle for national liberty, but, equally  with the wars of the Maccabees against the Seleucids, an episode in the  more vital conflict between Hebraism and paganism, between material  force and the ardent passion for religious freedom.          II    THE LIFE OF JOSEPHUS TO THE FALL OF JOTAPATA      Josephus was essentially an apologist, and his writings include not only  an apology for his people, but an apology for his own life. In contrast  with the greater Jewish writers, he was given to vaunting his own deeds.  We have therefore abundant, if not always reliable, information about  the chief events of his career. It must always be borne in mind that he  had to color the narrative of his own as well as his people's history to  suit the tastes and prejudices of the Roman conqueror. He was born in 37  C.E., the first year of the reign of Gaius Caesar, the lunatic Emperor,  who nearly provoked the Jews to the final struggle. Though he is known  to history as Josephus Flavius, his proper name was Joseph ben  Mattathias, Josephus being the Latinized form of the Hebrew [Hebrew:  Yosef] and his patronymic being exchanged, when he went over to the  Romans, for the family name of his patrons, Flavius. His father was a  priest of the first of the twenty-four orders, named Jehoiarib, and on  his mother's side he was connected with the royal house of the  Hasmoneans. His genealogy, which he traces back to the time of the  Maccabean princes, is a little vague, and we may suspect that he was not  above improving it. But his family was without doubt among the priestly  aristocracy of Jerusalem, and his father, he says, was \"eminent not only  on account of his nobility, but even more for his virtue.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: Vita, 2.]    He was brought up with his brother Matthias to fit himself for the  priestly office, and he received the regular course of Jewish education  in the Torah and the tradition. He says in the _Antiquities_ that \"only  those who know the laws and can interpret the practices of our  ancestors, are called educated among the Jews;\" and it is likely that he  attended in his boyhood one of the numerous schools that existed in  Jerusalem at the time. According to the Talmud there were four hundred  and eighty synagogues each with a Bet Sefer for teaching the written law  and a Bet Talmud for the study of the oral law.[1] From his silence we  may infer that he did not study Greek at this period, and Aramaic was  his natural tongue. He was never able to speak Greek fluently or with  sufficient exactness, because, as he says in the _Antiquities_, \"Our own  nation does not encourage those who learn the language of many peoples,  and so color their discourses with the smoothness of their periods: for  they look upon this sort of accomplishment as common, not only to  freemen, but to any slave that pleases to learn it.\"[2] When, in his  middle age, he set himself to write the history of his people in Greek,  he was compelled to get the help of friends to correct his composition  and syntax.    [Footnote 1: Yer. Meg. iii. 1.]    [Footnote 2: Ant. XX. xi. 2.]    As to his Hebrew accomplishments, he tells us, with his native  immodesty, that he acquired marvelous proficiency in learning, and was  famous for his great memory and understanding. When he was fourteen  years of age, he continues, such was his fame that the high priests and  principal men of the city frequently came to consult him about difficult  points of the law. His mature works do not show any profound knowledge  either of the Halakah or of the Haggadah, so that the statement is not  to be taken strictly. It is probably nothing more than a grandiloquent  way of saying that he was a precocious child, who impressed his elders.  Paul, too, claimed that he was \"a Pharisee of the Pharisees, and zealous  beyond those of his own age in the Jews' religion,\" and yet he can  hardly be regarded as an authority on the tradition. The autobiography  of Josephus, it is pertinent to remember, was designed to impress the  Romans with the greatness of the writer, and its readers were not  equipped with the means of criticising his Jewish accomplishments. With  the same object of impressing the Romans, Josephus recounts that, when  about the age of sixteen, he had a mind to imbue himself with the tenets  of the three Jewish parties, the Sadducees, the Pharisees, and the  Essenes.    Elsewhere he describes the teaching of these sects for the benefit of  his Roman readers according to a technical classification borrowed from  his environment, i.e. he represents them as three philosophical schools  of the Greek type, each holding different views about fate and  Providence and the nature of the soul and its immortality. But just as  this is demonstrably a misleading coloring of the difference between the  sections of the Jewish people, so is his attempt to represent that he  attended, as a cultured Greek or Roman of the time would have done,  three philosophical colleges. He was compelled by the needs of his  audience to present Jewish life in the form of Greco-Roman institutions,  however ill it fits the mould, and his remarks about sects and schools  must always be taken with caution. It is as though a modern writer  should describe Judaism as a Church, and express its ideas and  observances in the language of Christian theology.    There is, however, no reason to doubt that Josephus made himself  acquainted with the tenets of the chief teachers of the time, and he may  conceivably have sat at the feet of Rabbi Gamaliel, then the chief sage  at Jerusalem. But, anxious to exhibit his catholicity, after professing  himself a Pharisee, he says that, not content with these studies, he  became for three years a faithful disciple of one Banus, who lived in  the desert, and used no other clothing than grew upon trees, ate no  other food than that which grew wild, and bathed frequently in cold  water both night and day.[1] The extreme hermit form of the religious  life was more fashionable in the first century of the Christian era  among Gentiles than among Jews, and it is not unlikely that Josephus is  embroidering his idea of life in an Essene community, rather than  setting down his actual experience. An Essene he never became, but he  remained throughout his life very partial to certain forms of the Essene  belief, more especially those which coincided with the Greco-Roman  superstitions of the time, such as the literal prediction of future  events, the meaning of dreams, the significance of omens.[2] These  ideas, handed down from primitive Israel, had lived on among the masses  of the people, though discarded by the learned teachers, and Josephus,  finding them in vogue among his masters, readily professed acceptance of  them.    [Footnote 1: Vita, 2.]    [Footnote 2: Comp. B.J.

But I must go to see  what's left of the Baths, even though there's only a bit of mosaic and  the remains of a room. Monny's anxious to get on to Cairo, but we shall  come back to Alexandria later. Lord Ernest, when I shut my eyes, I  really do seem to picture the Mareotic Lake, and the buildings that  made Alexandria the glory of the world. Do you remember what Strabo  said about Deinchares, the architect who laid out the plan of the city  in the shape of a Macedonian mantle, to please Alexander?\"    \"I'm not as well up in history as you are,\" I said, \"though I've  studied a bit, because I was born in Egypt. Poor Alexander didn't live  long in his fine city, did he? I wonder what he'd think of it now? And  I wonder if his palace was handsomer than the Khedive's? That huge  white building with the pillars and domes. I seem to remember----\"    \"What, you remember, too? You _ought_ to consult Sayda!\"    \"I didn't mean exactly what you mean,\" I explained, humbly. \"Still, why  shouldn't I have lived in Egypt long ago? The learned ones say you're  always drawn back where you've been in other states of existence----\"    \"That's true, I'm sure!\"    \"Well, then, why shouldn't I have the same sort of right to Egypt you  have, if you were Cleopatra?--I believe you must have been, because you  look as she ought to have looked, you know. Why shouldn't I have been a  friend of Marc Antony, coming from Rome to give him good advice and  trying to persuade----\"    \"Oh, _not_ that he ought to give me up!\"    \"No, indeed: to urge him to leave the island where he hid even from you  (didn't they call it Timoneum?). Why couldn't Antony play his cards so  as to keep Cleopatra and the world, too? She'd have liked him better,  wouldn't she? My friend Antoun Effendi--I mean Anthony Fenton,\"--I  stopped short: for the less said about Fenton the better, at present.  But Cleopatra caught me up.    \"What--have you really a friend Antony? Where does he live? and what's  he like?\"    I hesitated; and glancing round for inspiration (in other words for  some harmless, necessary fib) I saw that Brigit and Monny had arrived  on the scene. They had been pacing the deck, arm in arm; and now,  arrested by Mrs. East's question, they hovered near, awaiting my answer  with vague curiosity. A twinkle in Biddy's eyes, which I caught,  rattled me completely. I missed all the easiest fibs and could catch  hold of nothing but the bare truth. There are moments like that, when,  do what you will, you must be truthful or silent; and silence fires  suspicion.    \"What is he?\" I echoed feebly. \"Oh, Captain Fenton. He's in the Gyppy  Army stationed up at Khartum, hundreds of miles beyond where Cook's  boats go. You wouldn't be interested in Anthony, because he spells his  name with an 'H', and he's dark and thin, not a bit like _your_ Antony,  who was a big, stout fellow, I've always heard, and fair.\" \"Big, but  _not_ stout,\" Cleopatra corrected me. \"And--and if he's incarnated  again, he may be dark for a change. As for the 'H', that's not  important. I wonder if we shall meet your Anthony? We think of going to  Khartum, don't we, Monny?\"    \"Yes,\" said the girl, shortly. She was always rather short in her  manner at that time when in her opinion her aunt was being \"silly.\"    I gathered from a vexed flash in the gray eyes that there had never  been any hint of an impending Antony.    \"Is your friend in Khartum now?\" Biddy ventured, in her creamiest  voice. The twinkle was carefully turned off like the light of a dark  lantern, but I knew well that \"Mrs. Jones\" was recalling a certain  conversation, in which I had refused to satisfy her curiosity. Brigit's  quick, Irish mind has a way of matching mental jigsaw puzzles, even  when vital bits appear to be missing; and if she could make a cat's paw  of Cleopatra, the witch would not be above doing it. I bore her no  grudge--who could bear soft-eyed, laughing, yet tragic Biddy a grudge?  --but I wished that she and Monny were at the other end of the deck.    \"I--er--really, I don't know where my friend is just now,\" I answered,  with more or less foundation of truth.    \"I wonder if I didn't read in the papers about a Captain Fenton who  took advantage of leave he'd got, to make a rush for the Balkans, and  see the fighting from the lines of the Allies?\" Biddy murmured with  dreadful intelligence. \"Can he be your Captain Fenton? I fancy he'd  been stationed in the Sudan; and he was officially supposed to have  gone home to spend his leave in England. Anyhow, there was a row of  some sort after he and another man dropped down on to the Turks out of  a Greek aeroplane. Or was it a Servian one? Anyhow, I know he oughtn't  to have been in it; and 'Paterfamilias' and 'Patriot' wrote letters to  the _Times_ about British officers who didn't mind their own business.  Why, I saw the papers on board this ship! They were old ones. Papers on  ships always are. But I think they came on at Algiers or somewhere.\"    \"Probably 'somewhere,'\" I witheringly replied. \"_I_ didn't come on at  Algiers, so I don't know anything about it.\"    \"Diplomatists never do know anything official, do they, Duffer dear?\"  smiled Biddy. \"I'll wager your friend is interesting, even if he does  spell himself with an 'H', and weighs two stone less than his namesake  from Rome. Mrs. East believes in reincarnation, and I'm not sure I  don't, though Monny's so young she doesn't believe in anything. Just  suppose your friend is a reincarnation of Antony without an 'H'? And  suppose, too, by some strange trick of fate he should meet you in  Alexandria or Cairo? You'd introduce him to us, wouldn't you?\"    \"It's the most unlikely thing in the world. And he'd be no good to you.  He's a man's man. He thinks he doesn't like women.\"    \"Doesn't like women!\" echoed Monny Gilder. \"He must be a curmudgeon. Or  has he been jilted?\"    \"Rather not!\" Too impulsively I defended the absent. \"Girls go mad  about him. He has to keep them off with a stick. He's got other things  to think of than girls, things he believes are more important--though,  of course, he's mistaken. He'll find that out some day, when he has  more time. So far, he's been hunting other game, often in wild places.  A book might be written on his adventures.\"    \"What kind of adventures? Tell us about them,\" said Biddy, \"up to the  Balkan one, which you deny having heard of.\"    \"You wouldn't care about his sort of adventures. There aren't any women  in them,\" said I. \"Women want love stories. It's only the heroines they  care for, not the heroes, and I don't somehow see the right heroine for  Fenton's story.\"    I noticed an expression dawning on Cleopatra's face, as I thus bereft  her of a possible Antony (with an \"H\"). There was a softening of the  long eyes, and the glimmer of a smile which said \"Am I Cleopatra for  nothing?\"    Never had she looked handsomer. Never before had I thought of her as  really dangerous. I'd been inclined to poke fun at the lady for her  superstition and her cartouche, and Cleopatra-hood in general. But  suddenly I realized that her make-up was no more exaggerated than that  of many a beauty of the stage and of society: and that nowadays, women  who are--well, forty-ish--can be formidable rivals for younger and  simpler sisters. Not that I feared much for Anthony from Cleopatra or  any other female thing, for I'd come to consider him practically  woman-proof; still, I saw danger that the lady might make a dead set at  him, if she got the chance, and all through my stupidity in giving away  his name. \"Antony\" was a thrilling password to that mysterious \"something\"  which she expected to happen in Egypt: and already she regarded my  friend as a ram caught in the bushes, for a sacrifice on her altar.  Instead of screening him I had dragged him in front of the footlights.  But fortunately there was still time to jerk down the curtain.    I threw a glance at Brigit and Monny, and was relieved to find that  their attention was distracted by a new arrival: Miss Rachel Guest from  Salem, Massachusetts: a pale, thin, lanky copy of our Rose, with the  beauty and bloom left out; but a pair of eyes to redeem the colourless  face--oh, yes, a pair of eyes! Strange, hungry, waiting eyes.    When I am alone, I fear Monny's favourite _protegee_, who started out  to \"see the world\" on a legacy of two thousand dollars, and won Miss  Gilder's admiration (and hospitality) through her unassuming pluck. To  my mind she is the ideal adventuress of a new, unknown, and therefore  deadly type; but for once I rejoiced at sight of the pallid, fragile  woman, so cheerful in spite of frail health, so frank about her  twenty-eight years. She had news to tell of a nature so exciting that,  after a whisper or two, Cleopatra forgot Anthony in her desire to know the  latest development in the Ship's Mystery.    \"My stewardess says he won't let his wife land till we're all off,\"  murmured the ex-schoolmistress, in her colourless voice. \"She heard the  end of a conversation, when she carried the poor girl's lunch to the  door--just a word or two. So we shan't see her again, I suppose.\"    \"Oh, yes, we shall,\" said Monny. \"If Wretched Bey can get a private  boat, so can I. I'll not desert her, if I have to stay on board the  _Laconia_ the whole night.\"    All four began talking together eagerly, and blessing Miss Guest I  sneaked away. Presently I saw that clever Neill Sheridan and handsome,  actor-like Willis Bailey, the two _betes noires_ of Wretched Bey, had  joined the group.    By this time the roofs and domes and minarets of Alexandria sparkled in  clearly sketched outlines between sunset-sky and sea; sunset of Egypt,  which divided ruby-flame of cloud, emerald dhurra, gold of desert, and  sapphire waters into separate bands of colour, vivid as the stripes of  a rainbow.
