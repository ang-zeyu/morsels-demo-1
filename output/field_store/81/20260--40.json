We must take, as our 'Universe', some class  of things which will include Dragons and Scotchmen: shall we say  'Animals'?  And, as \"canny\" is evidently the Attribute belonging  to the 'Middle Terms', we will let m stand for \"canny\", x for  \"Dragons\", and y for \"Scotchmen\".  So that our two Premisses are,  in full,         \"All Dragon-Animals are uncanny (Animals);     All Scotchman-Animals are canny (Animals).\"      And these may be expressed, using letters for words, thus:--                      \"All x are m';                   All y are m.\"      The first Premiss consists, as you already know, of two parts:--                       \"Some x are m',\"               and \"No x are m.\"      And the second also consists of two parts:--                       \"Some y are m,\"               and \"No y are m'.\"      Let us take the negative portions first.    We have, then, to mark, on the larger Diagram, first, \"no x are  m\", and secondly, \"no y are m'\".  I think you will see, without  further explanation, that the two results, separately, are             -----------           -----------        |     |     |         |0    |     |        |   --|--   |         |   --|--   |        |  |0 | 0|  |         |  |  |  |  |        |--|--|--|--|         |--|--|--|--|        |  |  |  |  |         |  |  |  |  |        |   --|--   |         |   --|--   |        |     |     |         |0    |     |         -----------           -----------        and that these two, when combined, give us                          -----------                     |0    |     |                     |   --|--   |                     |  |0 | 0|  |                     |--|--|--|--|                     |  |  |  |  |                     |   --|--   |                     |0    |     |                      -----------      We have now to mark the two positive portions, \"some x are m'\"  and \"some y are m\".    The only two compartments, available for Things which are xm', are  No. 9 and No. 10.  Of these, No. 9 is already marked as 'empty';  so our red counter must go into No. 10.    Similarly, the only two, available for ym, are No. 11 and No. 13.  Of these, No. 11 is already marked as 'empty'; so our red counter  MUST go into No. 13.    The final result is                          -----------                     |0    |    1|                     |   --|--   |                     |  |0 | 0|  |                     |--|--|--|--|                     |  |1 |  |  |                     |   --|--   |                     |0    |     |                      -----------        And now how much of this information can usefully be transferred  to the smaller Diagram?    Let us take its four compartments, one by one.    As to No. 5?  This, we see, is wholly 'empty'. (So mark it with a  grey counter.)    As to No. 6?  This, we see, is 'occupied'.  (So mark it with a red  counter.)    As to No. 7?  Ditto, ditto.    As to No. 8?  No information.    The smaller Diagram is now pretty liberally marked:--                           -------                      | 0 | 1 |                      |---|---|                      | 1 |   |                       -------      And now what Conclusion can we read off from this?  Well, it is  impossible to pack such abundant information into ONE Proposition:  we shall have to indulge in TWO, this time.    First, by taking x as Subject, we get \"all x are y'\", that is,      \"All Dragons are not-Scotchmen\":      secondly, by taking y as Subject, we get \"all y are x'\", that is,      \"All Scotchmen are not-Dragons\".      Let us now write out, all together, our two Premisses and our brace  of Conclusions.              \"All Dragons are uncanny;           All Scotchmen are canny.           &there4  All Dragons are not-Scotchmen;                    All Scotchmen are not-Dragons.\"      Let me mention, in conclusion, that you may perhaps meet with  logical treatises in which it is not assumed that any Thing EXISTS  at all, by \"some x are y\" is understood to mean \"the Attributes x,  y are COMPATIBLE, so that a Thing can have both at once\", and \"no  x are y\" to mean \"the Attributes x, y are INCOMPATIBLE, so that  nothing can have both at once\".    In such treatises, Propositions have quite different meanings  from what they have in our 'Game of Logic', and it will be well to  understand exactly what the difference is.    First take \"some x are y\".  Here WE understand \"are\" to mean \"are,  as an actual FACT\"--which of course implies that some x-Things EXIST.  But THEY (the writers of these other treatises) only understand  \"are\" to mean \"CAN be\", which does not at all imply that any EXIST.  So they mean LESS than we do: our meaning includes theirs (for of  course \"some x ARE y\" includes \"some x CAN BE y\"), but theirs does  NOT include ours.  For example, \"some Welsh hippopotami are heavy\"  would be TRUE, according to these writers (since the Attributes  \"Welsh\" and \"heavy\" are quite COMPATIBLE in a hippopotamus), but  it would be FALSE in our Game (since there are no Welsh hippopotami  to BE heavy).    Secondly, take \"no x are y\".  Here WE only understand \"are\" to  mean \"are, as an actual FACT\"--which does not at all imply that no  x CAN be y.  But THEY understand the Proposition to mean, not only  that none ARE y, but that none CAN POSSIBLY be y.  So they mean  more than we do: their meaning includes ours (for of course \"no x  CAN be y\" includes \"no x ARE y\"), but ours does NOT include theirs.  For example, \"no Policemen are eight feet high\" would be TRUE  in our Game (since, as an actual fact, no such splendid specimens  are ever found), but it would be FALSE, according to these writers  (since the Attributes \"belonging to the Police Force\" and \"eight  feet high\" are quite COMPATIBLE:  there is nothing to PREVENT a  Policeman from growing to that height, if sufficiently rubbed with  Rowland's Macassar Oil--which said to make HAIR grow, when rubbed  on hair, and so of course will make a POLICEMAN grow, when rubbed  on a Policeman).    Thirdly, take \"all x are y\", which consists of the two partial  Propositions \"some x are y\" and \"no x are y'\".  Here, of course,  the treatises mean LESS than we do in the FIRST part, and more than  we do in the SECOND.  But the two operations don't balance each  other--any more than you can console a man, for having knocked down  one of his chimneys, by giving him an extra door-step.    If you meet with Syllogisms of this kind, you may work them, quite  easily, by the system I have given you: you have only to make  'are' mean 'are CAPABLE of being', and all will go smoothly.  For  \"some x are y\" will become \"some x are capable of being y\", that  is, \"the Attributes x, y are COMPATIBLE\".  And \"no x are y\" will  become \"no x are capable of being y\", that is, \"the Attributes  x, y are INCOMPATIBLE\".  And, of course, \"all x are y\" will become  \"some x are capable of being y, and none are capable of being y'\",  that is, \"the Attributes x, y are COMPATIBLE, and the Attributes  x, y' are INCOMPATIBLE.\"  In using the Diagrams for this system,  you must understand a red counter to mean \"there may POSSIBLY be  something in this compartment,\" and a grey one to mean \"there cannot  POSSIBLY be anything in this compartment.\"        3. Fallacies.      And so you think, do you, that the chief use of Logic, in real life,  is to deduce Conclusions from workable Premisses, and to satisfy  yourself that the Conclusions, deduced by other people, are correct?  I only wish it were!  Society would be much less liable to panics  and other delusions, and POLITICAL life, especially, would be a  totally different thing, if even a majority of the arguments, that  scattered broadcast over the world, were correct!  But it is all  the other way, I fear.  For ONE workable Pair of Premisses (I mean  a Pair that lead to a logical Conclusion) that you meet with in  reading your newspaper or magazine, you will probably find FIVE  that lead to no Conclusion at all: and, even when the Premisses  ARE workable, for ONE instance, where the writer draws a correct  Conclusion, there are probably TEN where he draws an incorrect one.    In the first case, you may say \"the PREMISSES are fallacious\": in  the second, \"the CONCLUSION is fallacious.\"    The chief use you will find, in such Logical skill as this Game  may teach you, will be in detecting 'FALLACIES' of these two kinds.    The first kind of Fallacy--'Fallacious Premisses'--you will detect  when, after marking them on the larger Diagram, you try to transfer  the marks to the smaller.  You will take its four compartments, one  by one, and ask, for each in turn, \"What mark can I place HERE?\";  and in EVERY one the answer will be \"No information!\", showing that  there is NO CONCLUSION AT ALL.  For instance,                \"All soldiers are brave;             Some Englishmen are brave.              &there4 Some Englishmen are soldiers.\"      looks uncommonly LIKE a Syllogism, and might easily take in a  less experienced Logician.  But YOU are not to be caught by such  a trick!  You would simply set out the Premisses, and would then  calmly remark \"Fallacious PREMISSES!\": you wouldn't condescend to  ask what CONCLUSION the writer professed to draw--knowing that,  WHATEVER it is, it MUST be wrong.  You would be just as safe as  that wise mother was, who said \"Mary, just go up to the nursery,  and see what Baby's doing, AND TELL HIM NOT TO DO IT!\"    The other kind of Fallacy--'Fallacious Conclusion'--you will not  detect till you have marked BOTH Diagrams, and have read off the  correct Conclusion, and have compared it with the Conclusion which  the writer has drawn.    But mind, you mustn't say \"FALLACIOUS Conclusion,\" simply because  it is not IDENTICAL with the correct one: it may be a PART of the  correct Conclusion, and so be quite correct, AS FAR AS IT GOES.  In  this case you would merely remark, with a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/477"],[0,"Criminal Sociology (#5)"],[1,"elong.  <p 11>    Thus the psychology of the criminal is summed up in a defective  resistance to criminal tendencies and temptations, due to that  ill-balanced impulsiveness which characterises children and  savages.      II.      I have long been convinced, by my study of works on criminal  anthropology, but especially by direct and continuous observation  from a physiological or a psychological point of view of a large  number of criminals, whether mad or of normal intelligence, that  the data of criminal anthropology are not entirely applicable, in  their complete and essential form, to all who commit crimes.  They  are to be confined to a certain number, who may be called  congenital, incorrigible, and habitual criminals.  But apart from  these there is a class of occasional criminals, who do not  exhibit, or who exhibit in slighter degrees, the anatomical,  physiological, and psychological characteristics which constitute  the type described by Lombroso as ``the criminal man.''    Before further defining these two main classes of criminals, in  their natural and descriptive characterisation, I must add a  positive demonstration, which can be attested under two distinct  forms--(1) by the results of anthropological observation of  criminals, and (2) by statistics of relapse, and of the  manifestations of crime which anthropologists have hitherto  chiefly studied.    As for organic anomalies, as I cannot here treat <p 12>the whole  matter in detail, I will simply reproduce from my study of  homicide a summary of results for a single category of these  anomalies, which a methodical observation of every class of  criminals will carry further and render more precise, as Lombroso  has already shown (see the fourth edition of his work, 1889, p.  273).                                    Homicides sentenced                          To penal        To Imprisonment      Soldiers                                servitude   Persons in whom I detected     (346)               (363)            (711)   No anomaly in the skull      11.9 p. c.          8.2 p. c.         37.2 p. c.   One or two anomalies         47.2  ''            56.6  ''          51.8  ''   Three or four anomalies      30.9  ''            32.6  ''          11    ''   Five or six anomalies        6.7  ''             2.3  ''           0    ''   Seven or more anomalies        .3  ''              .3  ''           0    ''      That is to say, men with normal skulls were three times as  numerous amongst soldiers as they were amongst criminals; of men  with a noteworthy number of anomalies occurring together (three or  four), there were three times as many amongst criminals as amongst  soldiers; and there was not one soldier amongst those who showed  an extraordinary number (five or more).    This proves to demonstration not only the greater frequency of  anomalous skulls (and the same is true of physiognomical,  physiological, and psychological anomalies) amongst criminals, but  also that amongst these criminals between fifty and sixty per  cent. show very few anomalies, whilst about one-third of the whole  number present a remarkable combination, and one-tenth are normal  in this respect.  <p 13>    Amongst the statistical data exhibiting the primary  characteristics of the majority of criminals, the data connected  with relapsed criminals are especially conspicuous.  Though  relapses, like first offences, are partly due to social  conditions, they also have a manifest biological cause, since,  under the operation of the same penal system, there are some  liberated prisoners who relapse and some who do not.    The statistics of relapse are unfortunately very difficult to  collect, on account of differences in the legislation of different  countries, and in the preparation of records, which, even under  the more general adoption of anthropometrical identification,  rarely succeed in preventing the use of fresh names by  professional criminals.  So that we may still say, in the words of  one who is a very good judge in this matter, M. Yvern<e!>s, not  only that ``the Prisons Congress of London (1872) was compelled to  leave various problems undecided for lack of documentary evidence,  and especially the question of relapsed criminals,'' but also that  to this day (1879), ``we find varying results in different  countries, the exact significance of which is not apparent.''    I have, however, published an essay on international statistics of  relapsed criminals, from which I drew the following general  conclusion: that even in prison statistics, which often give  higher totals of relapsed cases than are given by judicial  statistics, because they are more personal, and therefore less  uncertain, we never obtain the full number of relapses, though the  totals given vary from country to country, from district to  district, and from prison to prison.  It <p 14>would be impossible  to state accurately what proportion the numbers given bear to the  actual number; but I am justified in saying, from all the  materials which I have collected and compared in the aforesaid  essay, that the number of relapses in Europe is generally between  50 and 60 per cent., and certainly rather above than below this  limit.  Whilst the Italian statistics, for instance, give 14 per  cent. of relapses amongst prisoners sentenced to penal servitude,  I found by experience 37 per cent; out of 346 who admitted to me  that they had relapsed; and, amongst those who had been sentenced  to simple imprisonment, I found 60 per cent. out of 363, in place  of the 33 per cent. recorded in the prison statistics.  The  difference may be due to the particular conditions of the prisons  which I visited; but in any case it establishes the inadequacy of  the official figures dealing with relapse.    After this statement of a general fact, which proves, as Lombroso  and Espinas said, that ``the relapsed criminal is the rule rather  than the exception,'' we can proceed to set down the special  proportions of relapse for each particular crime, so as to obtain  an indication of the forms of crime which are most frequently  resorted to by habitual criminals.    For Italy I have found that the highest percentages of relapse are  afforded by persons convicted of theft and petty larceny, forgery,  rape, manslaughter, conspiracy, and, at the correctional courts,  vagrancy and mendicity.  The lowest percentages are amongst those  convicted of assault and bodily harm, murders, and infanticide.  <p 15>    For France, where legal statistics are remarkably adapted for the  most minute inquiry, I have drawn up the following table of  statistics from the lists of persons convicted at the assize  courts and correctional tribunals, taking an average of the years  1877-81, which is not sensibly affected by the results of  succeeding years.    It will be seen that the average of relapses for crimes against  the person is higher than the average for the most serious cases  of murderous and indecent assault, which are clearly an outcome of  the most anti-social tendencies (such as parricide, murder, rape,  inflicting bodily harm on parents, &c.).  Thus homicide and fatal  wounding, though relapse is very frequent in these cases, still  display a less abnormal and more occasional character by their  lower position in the table, as shown in the cases of infanticide,  concealment of birth, and abandonment of infants.  As for the very  frequent occurrence of relapse in special crimes, such as assaults  on officials and resistance to authority, which rarely come before  the assize courts--though even there they tend to support the  higher numbers in the tribunals--these are offences which may also  be committed by criminals of every kind, and which, moreover,  depend in some measure on the social factor of police  organisation, and frequently on the psycho-pathological state of  particular individuals.    The somewhat rare occurrence of relapse in such a grave type of  murder as poisoning is noteworthy.  But this is only an effect of  the special psychology of these criminals, as I have explained  elsewhere.      {Table printed in ``landscape'' mode was not OCR'd.}  FRANCE--CASES OF RELAPSE, 1877-81.        <p 17>    Amongst crimes against property, the most frequent relapses are  found in the case of thieves (not including thefts and breaches of  trust by domestic servants, which thus, proving their more  occasional character, confirm the agreement of statistics with  criminal psychology).  The same thing is observed in regard to  forgers of commercial documents and to fraudulent bankrupts, who  are partly drawn into crime under the stress of personal or  general crises.  And the infrequency of relapse amongst postal  employees condemned for embezzlement, and amongst customs officers  who have been guilty of smuggling, is only a further confirmation  of the inducement to crime by the opportunities met with in each  case, rather than by personal tendencies.    Amongst minor offences, apart from that evasion of supervision  which is no more than a legal condition, there are, both in France  and in Italy, very frequent cases of relapse by vagabonds and  mendicants, which is a consequence of social environment, as well  as of the feeble organisation of the individuals.  Other relapses  above the average, included amongst these offences, constitute a  sort of accessory criminality, existing side by side with the  habitual criminality of thieves, murderers, and the like, such as  drunkenness, attacks on public functionaries, infractions of the  regulations of domicile, &c.    In thefts and resistance to authorities, relapse is less frequent  here than in the assize courts, for in the majority of these minor  offences, in their general forms, there is a greater number of  occasional offences, as is also the case with bankruptcies,  defamation, <p 18>abuse, rural offences, &c., which demonstrate  their more occasional character by their"]]]
