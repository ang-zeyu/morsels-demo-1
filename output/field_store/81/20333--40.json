Bennett in his book \"The  History of the Saints,\" (p. 282) makes a quotation from the _Nauvoo  Wasp_ in which he charges editorial expressions of approval of the  deed, as follows:        The _Nauvoo Wasp_ of May 28, A. D., 1842, a paper edited by      William Smith, one of the Twelve Mormon Apostles, and brother of      the Prophet, declared, [\"Boggs is undoubtedly killed according to      report, but] [C] Who did the Noble Deed remains to be found out.\"    [Footnote C: The words in brackets are in the _Wasp_ communication, but  not in Bennett's book. They are inserted here for clearness.]    This, however, is not an editorial expression of the _Wasp_; but is  found in a communication, on the editorial page, it is true, signed  by a now unknown writer under the nom de plume, \"Vortex,\" who is  indignantly taking to task a correspondent in the _Hawk Eye,_ a paper  published in Keokuk, Iowa, for charging the supposed assassination of  Boggs upon some Mormon. It is \"Vortex\" in the _Wasp_ that refers to  the then supposed assassination of Boggs as a \"noble deed,\" not the  editor. The editorial comment of the _Wasp_ on this communication from  \"Vortex\" is as follows: \"We admit the foregoing communication to please  our correspondent, not that we have any faith that any one has killed  Governor Boggs. The last account we have received is that he is still  living and likely to live.\" On the same page of the _Wasp_ is published  Joseph Smith's denial of complicity in the then supposed assassination  of Boggs and also the prediction of his violent death.    _The First Attempt of Missouri to Extradite the Prophet_.    That Joseph Smith should be accused of the crime of being accessory  before the fact to the attempted assassination of ex-Governor Boggs,  was perhaps to be expected as soon as a Mormon was charged with the  assault. But that his extradition should be demanded by Missouri on  the ground that he was \"a fugitive from justice from that State\" is  something at which to be astonished, even when the {XXIII} action is  by the officials of Missouri of the period of which I am writing.  For surely it must be a true principle of law--since it is a plain  deduction from common sense principles--that the alleged fugitive from  justice must be such in connection with and in consequence of the crime  with which he is charged. It was matter of common knowledge both in  Missouri and in Illinois, that Joseph Smith had not been in Missouri  for more than three years preceding the assault upon Boggs, nor since  the time of the assault; and that on the day the assault was made he  was in attendance upon an officer's drill. Finally, then, he was not  a fugitive from the State of Missouri in respect of this particular  crime, therefore not extraditable under such charge. If, then, Joseph  Smith had committed the crime of being accessory before the fact, to  the assault upon Boggs at all, it must have been a crime committed in  the state of Illinois and not in the state of Missouri. Therefore he  was not extraditable for the offense at all, but he must be tried, if  tried at all, in the state where the crime was committed, _viz_., in  Illinois. But if astonishment is due that even Missouri should make  such palpable blunders in legal procedure in moving for the extradition  of the Prophet, astonishment changes to amazement when Governor Carlin  of Illinois becomes a party to the attempted illegal extradition. The  whole procedure up to the close of Carlin's administration (which  went out of existence on the 8th of December 1842), warrants the  conclusion that a conspiracy existed between the high state officials  of both Missouri and Illinois against Joseph Smith, and that it was  the intent of that conspiracy to encompass his destruction. When  the Prophet and Orrin Porter Rockwell were arrested (8th of August,  1842) by the deputy sheriff of Adams county, they made no attempt to  evade the officer, but immediately applied to the municipal court of  Nauvoo for writ of _habeas corpus_, which was granted, but the deputy  sheriff refused to recognize the authority of the municipal court in  this case, and leaving his prisoner in the hands of the city marshal,  withdrew from Nauvoo. He returned two days later, however, determined  to take the Prophet from Nauvoo and deliver him to the agents of the  state of Missouri. The Prophet, however, avoided arrest and went  into retirement, where he remained--with now and then an occasional  appearance among the people--throughout the summer of 1842. In the  early days of December, Governor Carlin's administration came to an end  and Ford's began, and the Prophet at once petitioned the new executive  to rescind Carlin's order for his arrest. Ford referred the matter to  the judges of the Supreme Court, who were unanimously of the opinion  that the requisition from Missouri was illegal, but advised that the  matter be settled in the courts rather than by executive action. The  Governor suggested that if the Prophet found it necessary to repair to  {XXIV} Springfield, the state capital, for a judicial investigation  of his rights, he did not think there would be any disposition to use  illegal violence against him; and the governor pledged himself to  protect the Prophet if necessary with any amount of force from mob  violence while asserting his rights before the courts, as well as when  going to and returning from them. This advice was supplemented by the  advice of his eminent counsel, Justin Butterfield; also by his very  dear and trusted friend, General James Adams. The Prophet accordingly  submitted to arrest and immediately set out for Springfield with a  company of his friends.    The matter once before the Circuit Court of the United States for  the district of Illinois, Judge Pope presiding, the matter was soon  disposed of by declaring the procedure of Missouri and the executive of  Illinois, (Carlin) illegal, and ordering that the Prophet be discharged  from his arrest, as set forth in detail in the body of this volume.    _The Second Attempt of Missouri to Extradite the Prophet_.    A second attempt of Missouri to drag the Prophet from the state of  Illinois by extradition procedure, was even more infamous than the  first. No sooner was Joseph released from arrest and departed from  Springfield than John C. Bennett arrived there and wrote some of his  friends in Nauvoo his intention to leave immediately for Missouri and  obtain a new indictment by a grand jury on the old charge of \"murder,  treason, burglary, theft,\" etc., brought against the Prophet, Hyrum  Smith, Lyman Wight, Parley P. Pratt _et al_., in 1838, hoping that upon  this charge he might succeed in getting out extradition papers on the  ground that the Prophet was a fugitive from the justice of the state of  Missouri. It will be remembered that a former attempt was made under  this same charge, in June, 1841, when the Prophet was tried on writ  of _habeas corpus_ at Monmouth, Warren county, Illinois, before Judge  Douglas and set at liberty. It was on this occasion that Esquire O. H.  Browning declared that to ask Joseph Smith \"to go to Missouri for a  trial was adding insult to injury\" (Vol. IV, chapter XX).    An indictment on these old charges was finally obtained, supposedly at  the instance of Bennett and the Prophet's old Missouri enemies, at a  special term of the Circuit Court of Daviess county, Missouri, on the  5th of June, 1843. Governor Reynolds, of Missouri issued a requisition  on Governor Ford for Joseph Smith, and appointed J. H. Reynolds as  agent of Missouri to receive the Prophet from the authorities of  Illinois. The story of the arrest and the incidents thereto are given  in great detail in the body of this volume, and need not be dwelt  upon here. It will be sufficient to say that Joseph finally succeeded  in bringing {XXV} his captors to Nauvoo where he obtained a writ  of_ habeas corpus_ from the municipal court of Nauvoo by which the  validity of the procedure of Missouri might be tested. When Joseph was  on trial upon these same charges before Judge Douglas on a writ of  _habeas corpus_ in 1841, the Monmouth court refused to enter into a  consideration of the merits of the case, as the judge doubted whether  on the writ of _habeas corpus_ he had a right to go beyond the writ  and inquire into the merits of the case, but ordered the release of  the prisoner on the ground of some defect in the writ under which he  was held. The same point was avoided by Judge Pope in the hearing at  Springfield on the charge against the Prophet for complicity in the  assault upon ex-Governor Boggs. But the Nauvoo municipal court had  no such scruples, and at once proceeded to try the case _exparte_  on its merits, and Hyrum Smith, P. P. Pratt, Brigham Young, Geo. W.  Pitkin, Lyman Wight, and Sidney Rigdon were examined as witnesses.  Their affidavits before the court concerning events that happened to  the Saints in Missouri, afford the most circumstantial, reliable and  exhaustive data for the history of the Church while in that state.  They will be found in the Appendix to Vol. III of this history. After  hearing the testimony of these witnesses and the pleading of counsel  the court ordered that Joseph Smith be released from the arrest and  imprisonment of which he complained for want of substance in the  warrant by which he was held, as well as upon the merits of the case.  A copy of the proceedings before the municipal court at Nauvoo and all  the papers connected with the case were immediately sent to Governor  Ford, as also were affidavits from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60758"],[0,"History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Volume 6 (#5)"],[1,"university, literary  and dramatic associations were organized, as also choral and band  organizations for the cultivation of musical talents and to promote the  pleasure and refinement of society; while the religious zeal of the  community expressed itself in the rapidly rising walls of the splendid  temple--soon to be the most solid and pretentious building in the  state; and in the tireless missionary enterprise of the dominant Church.    {XXV} _V. Jealousy of Nauvoo's Promising Greatness._    Nothing was lacking, then, in the promises of constant and rapid  growth, of prosperity and future greatness of Nauvoo. Small wonder  if the narrow bigotry and jealousy of small-souled men of the time  and vicinity--especially those who were inhabitants of rival towns,  particularly those of Warsaw and Carthage--were envious of Nauvoo's  prosperity and promise of future greatness. Hitherto this element of  jealousy of Nauvoo's prosperity and promise of future greatness has  not been accorded the importance due to it as a contributing cause to  the warfare made upon that city and the Saints. Little doubt, however,  can be entertained, now attention has been called to it, but what as a  contributing cause jealousy of Nauvoo stood next to religious prejudice  and political distrust and hatred.    A correspondent from Fair Haven, Connecticut, to a gentleman in Nauvoo,  set forth this matter most convincingly. An excerpt of the letter was  published in the _Nauvoo Neighbor_ of August 7th, 1844. It is proper to  say that the writer was not a member of the Mormon Church; \"but,\" as  the editor of the _Neighbor_ describes him, \"a citizen of Connecticut,  loving law and liberty and life;\" and now the paragraph dealing with  the point under discussion:        \"It is now known here that the lazy speculators of Warsaw, and the      still lazier office drones at Carthage, cared nothing for Joseph      Smith personally, or for his tenets either; but the prosperity      of Nauvoo increasing as it did, beyond any former parallel, even      in the western world, excited in their bosoms envy, hatred and      all ungodliness. This is the true secret of all their barbarous      movements against Mormonism--and they supposed by destroying      the Smiths they should extinguish their religion, disperse the      Mormons--depopulating and desolating Nauvoo.\"    Also a correspondent to the _State Register_ published at Springfield,  Illinois, speaking of Thomas C. Sharp, editor of the _Warsaw Signal_  and the anti-Mormon disturbances in Hancock county said:        \"He [Sharp] is also described as having made himself the 'organ      of a gang of town lot speculators at Warsaw,' who are afraid that      Nauvoo is about to kill off their town and render speculation      abortive.\" [5]    Mr. Backenstos in January, 1845, when the repeal of the Nauvoo Charter  was under discussion in the Illinois legislature, referred to this same  subject in a speech on the floor of the house of representatives, in  the course of which he said:        \"Town rivalry had also something to do with this opposition to      Nauvoo. While Warsaw was on the decline, Nauvoo was rapidly      increasing {XXVI} in wealth and population; a plan to bring about      a re-action was soon concocted by the leading men of Warsaw,      who made one pilgrimage after another to Nauvoo, imploring the      Mormon Prophet to aid them in building up a city adjoining the      town of Warsaw, by settling a portion of the Mormon population in      and about Warsaw, and commence the building of a new city. The      bubble soon exploded, and the speculation failed. This gave rise      to dissatisfaction with some who had heretofore been exceedingly      polite to '_Lieutenant General Joseph Smith!_'\" [6]    Thus in every way, to refer back to the point of starting the  discussion of this subdivision, the Latter-day Saints are proven  by their achievements and the foundations they laid for the future  greatness of their city, to be a superior people, and hence a desirable  addition to the population of the then young commonwealth of Illinois.    _VI. The Character of the People of Western Illinois._    On the other hand there was a population in western Illinois, and  perhaps more especially in Hancock county, which had more than its  full share of lawless and desperate men; who, as by a law of social  gravitation, seek the frontiers of civilization. Moreover it is  notorious that the whole upper Mississippi was a rendezvous for  gamblers, counterfeiters, horse thieves, murderers and other criminals  that infested the great river, which gave easy ingress and egress to a  frontier wilderness on the one hand, and to such centers of population  and activity, on the other, as New Orleans, St. Louis, and many minor  places, besides. \"I must give some account of the anti-Mormons,\"  says Governor Ford in his History of Illinois, when referring to the  inhabitants of Hancock county. \"I had a good opportunity to know the  settlers of Hancock county,\" he continues. \"I had attended the circuit  courts there as state's attorney, from 1830, when the county was first  organized, up to 1834: and to my certain knowledge the early settlers,  with some honorable exceptions, were in popular languages hard cases\"  (page 406). Then for a period of several years to the advent of the  \"Mormons\" he had no means of knowing the character of the people who  drifted into the country: \"But,\" he adds, \"having passed my whole  life on the frontier, on the outer edge of the settlements, I have  frequently seen that a few first settlers would fix the character of a  settlement for good or for bad, for many years after its commencement.  If bad men began the settlement, bad men would be attracted to them,  upon the well known principle that birds of a feather will flock  together. Rogues will find each other out, and so will honest men.  From all which it appears extremely probable, that the later {XXVII}  immigrants were many of them attracted to Hancock by a secret sympathy  between them and the early settlers.\"    Indeed the governor suggests that it may have been \"the promptings of  a secret instinct,\" which led the \"Mormons\" to \"discern their fellows\"  and induced them to settle in Hancock in preference to other localities  open to them. All which may be regarded as an ingenious thrust at the  Latter-day Saints, but which fails of reaching its mark from the fact  that it was the criminal element chiefly in Hancock county's population  which arrayed itself in antagonism against the Saints, and against  whom they were arrayed in all their conflicts in that county. Whereas,  under the governor's theory, this criminal element among the \"old  citizens\" and the Saints should have been as hand in glove in their  cooperation of encompassing evil things. But to the contrary; from the  time the \"Mormons\" appeared on the scenes at Commerce, in 1839, until  they were expelled, they steadfastly and emphatically set their faces  against the evils that cursed that community, and denounced all manner  of evil both as manifested in a few of their own delinquent members,  apostates and camp followers who trailed after the main body of the  Church from Missouri, as well as in others: such as dram-drinking,  swearing, Sabbath-breaking, contracting debts under pretense of poverty  and distress without any prospects or intention of paying, [7] and  especially did they denounce stealing, under any and all pretexts  whatsoever. [8]    And as it was largely the criminal element among the \"old citizens\"  that was arrayed against the Saints (with unprincipled politicians  and a few bigoted and jealous religious leaders added), so was it the  conservative and law-abiding portion of the community among whom they  had many friends; and nearly all of whom were at least so far friendly  with the Saints that they could not be induced to oppose them, much  less join in acts of mob violence to the injury of their persons or  property; for which reason this portion of the non-Mormon population  were called by the contemptuous name of \"Jack-Mormons,\" which epithet  was invented by the editor of the Warsaw _Signal,_ Thomas C. Sharp,  who also originated the term \"Jack-Mason\" when editing an anti-Masonic  paper in western New York. In all probability it was this second name  which suggested the first.    {XXVIII} _VII. Educational Status of the People of Western Illinois._    Education among the masses of Hancock's non-Mormon population was of  the meagrest kind. Even Mr. Gregg, the historian of the county, who  always gives the best report possible of conditions, remarks, when  treating of the county's educational status, that \"a new country  and among pioneers, is not the place where prosperous colleges and  seminaries, or even high schools, are actually found. Hence common  schools and, in many instances, very 'common' ones at that, were the  best means of education in Hancock county in early days,\" But this is  said of the schools of Hancock county; the greater number of the adult  population, 1839-1846, which represent the years when the Saints lived  in the county, had migrated from states where educational opportunities  were even fewer and less advanced than in western Illinois. Even  some of the men prominent in political life in the state were men  of extremely limited education. \"Joseph Duncan, elected governor of  Illinois in 1834, and who had served four terms in Congress previous  to his election as governor, had but a limited education,\" says Gregg.  [9] And of Thomas Carlin, who was the governor of Illinois when the  exiled Saints moved into the state--he had previously held many minor  offices--the same authority says: \"He had but a meager education.\" [10]    But while the above represents the educational conditions both among  the masses of Hancock county and western Illinois in general, and of  some of the men in public life, it is"]]]
