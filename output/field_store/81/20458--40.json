[Footnote 1: Referred to in Letter XLV, Vol. II of this work.]        INTRODUCTION.    On ushering into the world a literary production, custom has  established that its parent should give some account of his  offspring. Indeed, this becomes the more necessary at the present  moment, as the short-lived peace, which gave birth to the following  sheets, had already ceased before they were entirely printed; and the  war in which England and France are now engaged, is of a nature  calculated not only to rouse all the energy and ancient spirit of my  countrymen, but also to revive their prejudices, and inflame their  passions, in a degree proportionate to the enemy's boastful and  provoking menace.    I therefore premise that those who may be tempted to take up this  publication, merely with a view of seeking aliment for their enmity,  will, in more respects than one, probably find themselves  disappointed. The two nations were not rivals in arms, but in the  arts and sciences, at the time these letters were written, and  committed to the press; consequently, they have no relation whatever  to the present contest. Nevertheless, as they refer to subjects which  manifest the indefatigable activity of the French in the  accomplishment of any grand object, such parts may, perhaps, furnish  hints that may not be altogether unimportant at this momentous  crisis.    The plan most generally adhered to throughout this work, being  detailed in LETTER V, a repetition of it here would be superfluous;  and the principal matters to which the work itself relates, are  specified in the title. I now come to the point.    A long residence in France, and particularly in the capital, having  afforded me an opportunity of becoming tolerably well acquainted with  its state before the revolution, my curiosity was strongly excited to  ascertain the changes which that political phenomenon might have  effected. I accordingly availed myself of the earliest dawn of peace  to cross the water, and visit Paris. Since I had left that city in  1789-90, a powerful monarchy, established on a possession of fourteen  centuries, and on that sort of national prosperity which seemed to  challenge the approbation of future ages, had been destroyed by the  force of opinion which, like, a subterraneous fire, consumed its very  foundations, and plunged the nation into a sea of troubles, in which  it was, for several years, tossed about, amid the wreck of its  greatness.    This is a phenomenon of which antiquity affords no parallel; and it  has produced a rapid succession of events so extraordinary as almost  to exceed belief.    It is not the crimes to which it has given birth that will be thought  improbable: the history of revolutions, as well ancient as modern,  furnishes but too many examples of them; and few have been committed,  the traces of which are not to be found in the countries where the  imagination of the multitude has been exalted by strong and new  ideas, respecting Liberty and Equality. But what posterity will find  difficult to believe, is the agitation of men's minds, and the  effervescence of the passions, carried to such a pitch, as to stamp  the French revolution with a character bordering on the marvellous  --Yes; posterity will have reason to be astonished at the facility  with which the human mind can be modified and made to pass from one  extreme to another; at the suddenness, in short, with which the ideas  and manners of the French were changed; so powerful, on the one hand,  is the ascendency of certain imaginations; and, on the other, so  great is the weakness of the vulgar!    It is in the recollection of most persons, that the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/90"],[0,"The Son of Tarzan (#5)"],[1,"his side, listening with eager ears, was the son of Tarzan of the  Apes.    After the boy had been tucked away in bed--and without the threatened  punishment--John Clayton told his wife of the events of the evening,  and that he had at last acquainted the boy with the facts of his jungle  life.  The mother, who had long foreseen that her son must some time  know of those frightful years during which his father had roamed the  jungle, a naked, savage beast of prey, only shook her head, hoping  against hope that the lure she knew was still strong in the father's  breast had not been transmitted to his son.    Tarzan visited Akut the following day, but though Jack begged to be  allowed to accompany him he was refused.  This time Tarzan saw the  pock-marked old owner of the ape, whom he did not recognize as the wily  Paulvitch of former days.  Tarzan, influenced by Akut's pleadings,  broached the question of the ape's purchase; but Paulvitch would not  name any price, saying that he would consider the matter.    When Tarzan returned home Jack was all excitement to hear the details  of his visit, and finally suggested that his father buy the ape and  bring it home.  Lady Greystoke was horrified at the suggestion.  The  boy was insistent.  Tarzan explained that he had wished to purchase  Akut and return him to his jungle home, and to this the mother  assented.  Jack asked to be allowed to visit the ape, but again he was  met with flat refusal.  He had the address, however, which the trainer  had given his father, and two days later he found the opportunity to  elude his new tutor--who had replaced the terrified Mr. Moore--and  after a considerable search through a section of London which he had  never before visited, he found the smelly little quarters of the  pock-marked old man.  The old fellow himself replied to his knocking,  and when he stated that he had come to see Ajax, opened the door and  admitted him to the little room which he and the great ape occupied.  In former years Paulvitch had been a fastidious scoundrel; but ten  years of hideous life among the cannibals of Africa had eradicated the  last vestige of niceness from his habits.  His apparel was wrinkled and  soiled.  His hands were unwashed, his few straggling locks uncombed.  His room was a jumble of filthy disorder.  As the boy entered he saw  the great ape squatting upon the bed, the coverlets of which were a  tangled wad of filthy blankets and ill-smelling quilts.  At sight of  the youth the ape leaped to the floor and shuffled forward.  The man,  not recognizing his visitor and fearing that the ape meant mischief,  stepped between them, ordering the ape back to the bed.    \"He will not hurt me,\" cried the boy.  \"We are friends, and before, he  was my father's friend.  They knew one another in the jungle.  My  father is Lord Greystoke.  He does not know that I have come here.  My  mother forbid my coming; but I wished to see Ajax, and I will pay you  if you will let me come here often and see him.\"    At the mention of the boy's identity Paulvitch's eyes narrowed.  Since  he had first seen Tarzan again from the wings of the theater there had  been forming in his deadened brain the beginnings of a desire for  revenge.  It is a characteristic of the weak and criminal to attribute  to others the misfortunes that are the result of their own wickedness,  and so now it was that Alexis Paulvitch was slowly recalling the events  of his past life and as he did so laying at the door of the man whom he  and Rokoff had so assiduously attempted to ruin and murder all the  misfortunes that had befallen him in the failure of their various  schemes against their intended victim.    He saw at first no way in which he could, with safety to himself, wreak  vengeance upon Tarzan through the medium of Tarzan's son; but that  great possibilities for revenge lay in the boy was apparent to him, and  so he determined to cultivate the lad in the hope that fate would play  into his hands in some way in the future.  He told the boy all that he  knew of his father's past life in the jungle and when he found that the  boy had been kept in ignorance of all these things for so many years,  and that he had been forbidden visiting the zoological gardens; that he  had had to bind and gag his tutor to find an opportunity to come to the  music hall and see Ajax, he guessed immediately the nature of the great  fear that lay in the hearts of the boy's parents--that he might crave  the jungle as his father had craved it.    And so Paulvitch encouraged the boy to come and see him often, and  always he played upon the lad's craving for tales of the savage world  with which Paulvitch was all too familiar.  He left him alone with Akut  much, and it was not long until he was surprised to learn that the boy  could make the great beast understand him--that he had actually learned  many of the words of the primitive language of the anthropoids.    During this period Tarzan came several times to visit Paulvitch.  He  seemed anxious to purchase Ajax, and at last he told the man frankly  that he was prompted not only by a desire upon his part to return the  beast to the liberty of his native jungle; but also because his wife  feared that in some way her son might learn the whereabouts of the ape  and through his attachment for the beast become imbued with the roving  instinct which, as Tarzan explained to Paulvitch, had so influenced his  own life.    The Russian could scarce repress a smile as he listened to Lord  Greystoke's words, since scarce a half hour had passed since the time  the future Lord Greystoke had been sitting upon the disordered bed  jabbering away to Ajax with all the fluency of a born ape.    It was during this interview that a plan occurred to Paulvitch, and as  a result of it he agreed to accept a certain fabulous sum for the ape,  and upon receipt of the money to deliver the beast to a vessel that was  sailing south from Dover for Africa two days later.  He had a double  purpose in accepting Clayton's offer.  Primarily, the money  consideration influenced him strongly, as the ape was no longer a  source of revenue to him, having consistently refused to perform upon  the stage after having discovered Tarzan.  It was as though the beast  had suffered himself to be brought from his jungle home and exhibited  before thousands of curious spectators for the sole purpose of  searching out his long lost friend and master, and, having found him,  considered further mingling with the common herd of humans unnecessary.  However that may be, the fact remained that no amount of persuasion  could influence him even to show himself upon the music hall stage, and  upon the single occasion that the trainer attempted force the results  were such that the unfortunate man considered himself lucky to have  escaped with his life.  All that saved him was the accidental presence  of Jack Clayton, who had been permitted to visit the animal in the  dressing room reserved for him at the music hall, and had immediately  interfered when he saw that the savage beast meant serious mischief.    And after the money consideration, strong in the heart of the Russian  was the desire for revenge, which had been growing with constant  brooding over the failures and miseries of his life, which he  attributed to Tarzan; the latest, and by no means the least, of which  was Ajax's refusal to longer earn money for him.  The ape's refusal he  traced directly to Tarzan, finally convincing himself that the ape man  had instructed the great anthropoid to refuse to go upon the stage.    Paulvitch's naturally malign disposition was aggravated by the  weakening and warping of his mental and physical faculties through  torture and privation.  From cold, calculating, highly intelligent  perversity it had deteriorated into the indiscriminating, dangerous  menace of the mentally defective.  His plan, however, was sufficiently  cunning to at least cast a doubt upon the assertion that his mentality  was wandering.  It assured him first of the competence which Lord  Greystoke had promised to pay him for the deportation of the ape, and  then of revenge upon his benefactor through the son he idolized.  That  part of his scheme was crude and brutal--it lacked the refinement of  torture that had marked the master strokes of the Paulvitch of old,  when he had worked with that virtuoso of villainy, Nikolas Rokoff--but  it at least assured Paulvitch of immunity from responsibility, placing  that upon the ape, who would thus also be punished for his refusal  longer to support the Russian.    Everything played with fiendish unanimity into Paulvitch's hands.  As  chance would have it, Tarzan's son overheard his father relating to the  boy's mother the steps he was taking to return Akut safely to his  jungle home, and having overheard he begged them to bring the ape home  that he might have him for a play-fellow.  Tarzan would not have been  averse to this plan; but Lady Greystoke was horrified at the very  thought of it.  Jack pleaded with his mother; but all unavailingly.  She was obdurate, and at last the lad appeared to acquiesce in his  mother's decision that the ape must be returned to Africa and the boy  to school, from which he had been absent on vacation.    He did not attempt to visit Paulvitch's room again that day, but  instead busied himself in other ways.  He had always been well supplied  with money, so that when necessity demanded he had no difficulty in  collecting several hundred pounds.  Some of this money he invested in  various strange purchases which he managed to smuggle into the house,  undetected, when he returned late in the afternoon.    The next morning, after giving his father time to precede him and  conclude his business with Paulvitch, the lad hastened to the Russian's  room.  Knowing nothing of the man's true character the boy dared not  take him fully into his confidence for fear that the old fellow"]]]
