Now Ziba had             fifteen sons and twenty servants.    10:009:011 Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord             the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do.             As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table,             as one of the king's sons.    10:009:012 And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And             all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto             Mephibosheth.    10:009:013 So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually             at the king's table; and was lame on both his feet.    10:010:001 And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children             of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.    10:010:002 Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of             Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent             to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And             David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.    10:010:003 And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their             lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he             hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his             servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and             to overthrow it?    10:010:004 Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one             half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the             middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.    10:010:005 When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because             the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at             Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.    10:010:006 And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before             David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of             Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen,             and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve             thousand men.    10:010:007 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of             the mighty men.    10:010:008 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in             array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba,             and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, were by themselves in             the field.    10:010:009 When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him             before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel,             and put them in array against the Syrians:    10:010:010 And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of             Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against             the children of Ammon.    10:010:011 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou             shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for             thee, then I will come and help thee.    10:010:012 Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people,             and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which             seemeth him good.    10:010:013 And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto             the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.    10:010:014 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,             then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city.             So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to             Jerusalem.    10:010:015 And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel,             they gathered themselves together.    10:010:016 And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were             beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the             captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.    10:010:017 And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together,             and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set             themselves in array against David, and fought with him.    10:010:018 And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of             seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand             horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who             died there.    10:010:019 And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw             that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with             Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the             children of Ammon any more.    10:011:001 And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time             when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his             servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the             children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried             still at Jerusalem.    10:011:002 And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from             off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and             from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman             was very beautiful to look upon.    10:011:003 And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is             not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah             the Hittite?    10:011:004 And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto             him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her             uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.    10:011:005 And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I             am with child.    10:011:006 And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And             Joab sent Uriah to David.    10:011:007 And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how             Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.    10:011:008 And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy             feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there             followed him a mess of meat from the king.    10:011:009 But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the             servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.    10:011:010 And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto             his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy             journey? why then didst thou not go down unto thine house?    10:011:011 And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah,             abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord,             are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine             house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou             livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.    10:011:012 And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow             I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day,             and the morrow.    10:011:013 And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before             him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on             his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to             his house.    10:011:014 And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter             to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.    10:011:015 And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the             forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that             he may be smitten, and die.    10:011:016 And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he             assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men             were.    10:011:017 And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and             there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and             Uriah the Hittite died also.    10:011:018 Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the             war;    10:011:019 And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end             of telling the matters of the war unto the king,    10:011:020 And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto             thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye             did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?    10:011:021 Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman             cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he             died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy             servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.    10:011:022 So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab             had sent him for.    10:011:023 And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed             against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were             upon them even unto the entering of the gate.    10:011:024 And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and             some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the             Hittite is dead also.    10:011:025 Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto             Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword             devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong             against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.    10:011:026 And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was             dead, she mourned for her husband.    10:011:027 And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to             his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son.

   18:015:003 Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches             wherewith he can do no good?    18:015:004 Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.    18:015:005 For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the             tongue of the crafty.    18:015:006 Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own             lips testify against thee.    18:015:007 Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before             the hills?    18:015:008 Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain             wisdom to thyself?    18:015:009 What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou,             which is not in us?    18:015:010 With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder             than thy father.    18:015:011 Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any             secret thing with thee?    18:015:012 Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes             wink at,    18:015:013 That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such             words go out of thy mouth?    18:015:014 What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of             a woman, that he should be righteous?    18:015:015 Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens             are not clean in his sight.    18:015:016 How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh             iniquity like water?    18:015:017 I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will             declare;    18:015:018 Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid             it:    18:015:019 Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed             among them.    18:015:020 The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the             number of years is hidden to the oppressor.    18:015:021 A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer             shall come upon him.    18:015:022 He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he             is waited for of the sword.    18:015:023 He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth             that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.    18:015:024 Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail             against him, as a king ready to the battle.    18:015:025 For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth             himself against the Almighty.    18:015:026 He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses             of his bucklers:    18:015:027 Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh             collops of fat on his flanks.    18:015:028 And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man             inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.    18:015:029 He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,             neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the             earth.    18:015:030 He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up             his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.    18:015:031 Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall             be his recompence.    18:015:032 It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall             not be green.    18:015:033 He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall             cast off his flower as the olive.    18:015:034 For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire             shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.    18:015:035 They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their             belly prepareth deceit.    18:016:001 Then Job answered and said,    18:016:002 I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye             all.    18:016:003 Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that             thou answerest?    18:016:004 I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's             stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head             at you.    18:016:005 But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my             lips should asswage your grief.    18:016:006 Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I             forbear, what am I eased?    18:016:007 But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my             company.    18:016:008 And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness             against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to             my face.    18:016:009 He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me             with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.    18:016:010 They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me             upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves             together against me.    18:016:011 God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into             the hands of the wicked.    18:016:012 I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also             taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up             for his mark.    18:016:013 His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins             asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the             ground.    18:016:014 He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me             like a giant.    18:016:015 I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in             the dust.    18:016:016 My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow             of death;    18:016:017 Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.    18:016:018 O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no             place.    18:016:019 Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on             high.    18:016:020 My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.    18:016:021 O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth             for his neighbour!    18:016:022 When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I             shall not return.    18:017:001 My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are             ready for me.    18:017:002 Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue             in their provocation?    18:017:003 Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that             will strike hands with me?    18:017:004 For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore             shalt thou not exalt them.    18:017:005 He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his             children shall fail.    18:017:006 He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I             was as a tabret.    18:017:007 Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members             are as a shadow.    18:017:008 Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall             stir up himself against the hypocrite.    18:017:009 The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath             clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.    18:017:010 But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot             find one wise man among you.    18:017:011 My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the             thoughts of my heart.    18:017:012 They change the night into day: the light is short because of             darkness.    18:017:013 If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the             darkness.    18:017:014 I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm,             Thou art my mother, and my sister.    18:017:015 And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?    18:017:016 They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest             together is in the dust.    18:018:001 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,    18:018:002 How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and             afterwards we will speak.    18:018:003 Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your             sight?    18:018:004 He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken             for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?    18:018:005 Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark             of his fire shall not shine.    18:018:006 The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle             shall be put out with him.    18:018:007 The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own             counsel shall cast him down.    18:018:008 For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon             a snare.    18:018:009 The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall             prevail against him.    18:018:010 The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in             the way.    18:018:011 Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive             him to his feet.    18:018:012 His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be             ready at his side.    18:018:013 It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn             of death shall devour his strength.    18:018:014 His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it             shall bring him to the king of terrors.    18:018:015 It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his:             brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.    18:018:016 His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above"]]]
