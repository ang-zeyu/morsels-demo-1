If you cannot arrange to hang the  mutton by a string to turn like a roasting jack, then bake it, and  continually baste it. A small shoulder is most successful. For one of  four pounds bake for fifty minutes.          ROAST RUMP OF BEEF, BORDELAISE SAUCE    Take three pounds of the rump of beef, put it into a pretty deep pan  upon one onion, one sliced carrot, some thyme, and a bay-leaf, three  table-spoonfuls of dripping, salt, and pepper. Put it on the top of the  fire, and when it comes fully to the boil, put it to the side, and allow  it to simmer nicely for an hour and a half. Dress it on a dish and serve  the sauce separately.          ROASTED FILLET OF BEEF    About three pounds of fillet of beef roasted in a good hot oven for  forty minutes; let it be rather underdone. Take three turnips,  four good-sized carrots, cut them into jardiniere slices. Cook them  separately in salted water, drain them and add salt, pepper, a tiny  pinch of sugar and one dessert-spoonful of butter. Dress the fillet on  a long dish with the garniture of carrots and turnips, and some  artichoke-bottoms cooked in water and finished with butter, also add  some potatoes _chateau_. Be sure the dish is very hot. Put a little  water, or, for choice, clear stock, upon the roasting-dish and pour it  over the fillet.          BEEF A LA BOURGUIGNONNE    Braise three pounds of beef upon twenty little onions, ten mushrooms,  and two glasses of red wine, salt, pepper, thyme and bay-leaf; cook for  one and one-half hours with not too hot a fire. After that, place the  beef on an oval dish; keep it hot; stir two tablespoonfuls of demi-glaze  into the vegetables and let it boil up. Cut some slices of the beef, and  strain the sauce over all.          OX-TONGUE A LA BOURGEOISE    Braise a tongue with two glasses of Madeira, one carrot, one onion,  thyme, bay-leaf, for two hours. Take seven tomatoes cut in pieces, four  carrots cut in two and three in four, about one-half inch long, ten  smallish onions, and braise them all together; then add two large  table-spoonfuls of demi-glaze, some salt and pepper. Serve all very hot  on an oval dish.    Braised tongue eats very well with spinach, carrots or sorrel.          BEEF A LA MODE    Take the raw beef, either rump-steak or fillet, and brown it in the pan  in some butter. Then add a little boiling water. Add then six or eight  chopped shallots, the hearts of two celeries chopped, a few small and  whole carrots, pepper, salt, two cloves. Before serving, bind the sauce  with a little flour and pour all over the meat.    [_V. Verachtert_.]          BOEUF A LA FLAMANDE    For this national dish that part of the animal called the \"spiering\" is  used, which is cut from near the neck. What is called fresh silverside  in England answers very well. Cut the beef into slices about  half-an-inch thick and divide the slices into four pieces. This you can  do with a piece of four pounds. For a piece of four pounds, cook first  of all four large fried onions in fat. Put the beef in the hot fat when  the onions are colored, and saute it; that is, keep moving the meat  about gently. Take the meat out and place it on a dish. Add to the fat  two dessert-spoonsful of flour and let it cook gently for five minutes,  adding a good pint of water. Pass the sauce through a tammy, over the  onions, and put the meat back in it, and it ought to cover them. Then  add a dessert-spoonful of good vinegar and a strong bunch of herbs. Stew  for an hour, take off the fat and remove the bunch of herbs. Heat up  again and serve.          CARETAKER'S BEEF    The real name of this dish is _Miroton de la Concierge_, and it is  currently held that only _concierges_ can do it to perfection. Put a  handful of minced onion to fry in butter; when it is nearly cooked, but  not quite, add a dessert-spoonful of flour, and stir it till all is well  colored. Pour on it a little gravy, or meat-juice of some kind, and let  it simmer for ten minutes after it begins to steam again. Then take your  beef, which must be cold, and cut in small slices; throw them in and  let it all cook for a quarter of an hour, only simmering, and constantly  stirring it, so that though it becomes considerably reduced it does not  stick to the pan.          BLANKENBERG BEEF    This is a winter dish; it is most sustaining, and once made, it can be  kept hot for hours without spoiling. Make a puree of lentils or peas,  and season it with pepper and salt. Mince your beef with an equal  quantity of peeled chestnuts, add chopped parsley, a dust of nutmeg or  a few cloves. If you have any cheap red wine pour it over the mince till  it is well moistened. If you have no red wine, use gravy. If you have  no gravy, use milk. Let all heat up in the oven for ten minutes, then  sprinkle in some currants or sultanas. Take the dish you wish to serve  it in, put the stew in the middle, and place the puree round it. If the  mince is moist it can be kept by the fire till required, or the dish can  be covered with another one and placed in a carrying-can, taken out to  skating or shooting parties.          VEAL WITH TOMATOES    Grill some slices of fat veal; cook some sliced tomatoes with butter,  pepper and salt, on a flat dish in a pretty quick oven. Garnish the veal  with the tomatoes laid on top of each slice, and pour _maitre-d'hotel_  butter over, made with butter, salt, chopped parsley, and lemon-juice.          FRICANDEAU OF VEAL    A fillet of veal, larded with fat bacon, of about three pounds. Braise  it one and one-half hours on a moderate fire. Dish with its own gravy.  This eats well with spinach, endive, sorrel or carrots.          VEAL CUTLETS WITH MADEIRA SAUCE    are garnished with potatoes and mushrooms, and the sauce is made of  demi-glaze and madeira, worked up with butter, pepper, salt and chopped  parsley.          GRENADINS OF VEAL    Cut your veal into fairly thick cutlets, lard them with fat bacon, and  braise them in the oven, with salt, pepper and butter. Dish up, and  rinse the pot with a little stock, and pour it on the meat ready to  serve.          CALF'S LIVER A LA BOURGEOISE    Take a calf's liver, lard it with fat bacon, braise it with the  _bourgeoise_ garnish--carrots and turnips. After it is cooked and  dished, stir some demi-glaze into the sauce, pour it on to the meat and  garnish with potatoes _chateau_.          VEAL WITH MUSHROOMS, OR THE CALF IN PARADISE    Take some slices of loin of veal, fry them in butter, with pepper and  salt, for twenty minutes. Take two spoonfuls of demi-glaze and heat it  with some mushrooms and a little madeira. Put the mushrooms and sauce on  each slice and sprinkle chopped parsley over all.    This can also be done with _fines herbes_, mushrooms, chervil and  parsley, chopped before cooking them in the butter.          BLANQUETTE OF VEAL    Take your veal, which need not be from the fillet or the best cuts. Cut  it into pieces about an inch long and add a little water when putting  it into the pan; salt, pepper and a little nutmeg, and let it simmer for  two hours. When tender, stir in the juice of half a lemon, and then bind  the sauce with the yolk of an egg, or, in default of that, with a little  flour. Serve immediately. You will find that when you wish to bind a  sauce at the last minute, egg powder will serve very well.    [_V. Verachtert_.]          VEAL CAKE, EXCELLENT FOR SUPPER    Take some chopped veal and with it an equal quantity of chopped beef,  and one-quarter the quantity of breadcrumbs from a fresh loaf. Bind all  with a raw egg, adding salt and pepper, and, if wished, some blanched  and chopped almonds. (Put a large piece of butter both above and below.)  Shape the meat into the form of a loaf and put it in a dish, with  a large slice of butter above and below it. Cook it for about  half-an-hour.    [_Mme. Gabrielle Janssens_.]          BREAST OF VEAL    (A good and inexpensive dish)    Cook the breast of veal in stock or in a little meat extract and water,  with sliced carrots and onions, thyme, pepper, salt, three bay-leaves  and three cloves. Let it stew for one hour in this, and then take  it out. Take out also the vegetables, and strain the liquor. Make a  bechamel sauce and add it to the liquor, giving it all a sharp taste  with the juice of half a lemon. Put back the breast of veal in this  sauce and when hot again serve them together.    [_Mdlle. Spinette_.]          OX TONGUE    Cook the ox tongue in stock or in meat extract and water. Make the  hunters' sauce, as for a hare, but sprinkle into it some chopped  sultanas. Take the tongue out of the stock and skin it, cut it in neat  pieces if you wish, and let it heat in your sauce.    [_Mdlle. Spinette_.]          VEAL A LA MILANAISE    Egg and breadcrumb some thick slices of veal; fry and garnish with  boiled macaroni cut in small pieces, with ham, mushrooms, truffles, all  cut in Julienne strips, pepper, salt, and a little tomato sauce. Mix all  these well together, and serve very hot.          STUFFED VEAL LIVER, OR LIVER A LA PANIER D'OR    The _Panier d'Or_ is a hotel in Bruges, much frequented before the war  by the English.    Take the yolk of a hard-boiled egg, a bit of bread the same size, and  crumble them together; rub in some chopped parsley and onion and moisten  it with gravy or with milk; season highly with salt, cayenne, and a  little vinegar or mustard. Take your liver, if possible in one rather  large flat slice. Make deep cuts in it, parallel to each other, and  lying closely together. Press your stuffing into these cuts. Put a bit  of butter the size of a walnut into a pan, or fireproof dish. Take your  liver and tie it round with a slice of fat bacon or fat pork. Lay it  in the dish and let it cook for an hour in a moderate oven. When done,  remove the slice of bacon, if there is any left, and serve the liver in  its own juice.          VEAL A LA CREME    Take a piece of veal suitable for roasting,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7234"],[0,"Species and Varieties, Their Origin (#5)"],[1,"this is the process of variety-testing. In nature it is the  survival of the fittest species, or, as Morgan designates it, the  survival of species in the struggle for existence. The species are not  changed by this struggle, they are only weighed against each other, the  weak being thrown aside.    Within the chosen elementary species there is also a struggle. It is  obvious, that the fluctuating variability adapts some to the given  circumstances, while it lessens the chances of others. A choice results,  and this choice is what is often exclusively called selection, either  natural or artificial. In cultivation it produces the improved and the  local races; in nature little is known about improvement in this way,  but [19] local adaptations with slight changes of the average character  in separate localities, seem to be of quite normal occurrence.    A new method of individual selection has been used in recent years in  America, especially by W.M. Hays. It consists in judging the hereditary  worth of a plant by the average condition of its offspring, instead of  by its own visible characters. If this determination of the \"centgener  power,\" as Hays calls it, should prove to be the true principle of  selection, then indeed the analogy between natural and artificial  selection would lose a large part of its importance. We will reserve  this question for the last lecture, as it pertains more to the future,  than to our present stock of knowledge.    Something should be said here concerning hybrids and hybridism. This  problem has of late reached such large proportions that it cannot be  dealt with adequately in a short survey of the phenomena of heredity in  general. It requires a separate treatment. For this reason I shall limit  myself to a single phase of the problem, which seems to be indispensable  for a true and at the same time easy distinction between elementary  species and retrograde varieties. According to accepted terminology,  some crosses are to be considered as unsymmetrical, while others are  symmetrical. The first are one-sided, [21] some peculiarity being found  in one of the parents and lacking in the other. The second are balanced,  as all the characters are present in both parents, but are found in a  different condition. Active in one of them, they are concealed or  inactive in the other. Hence pairs of contrasting units result, while in  unbalanced crosses no pairing of the particular character under  consideration is possible. This leads to the principal difference  between species and varieties, and to an experimental method of deciding  between them in difficult and doubtful cases.    Having thus indicated the general outlines of the subjects I shall deal  with, something now may be said as to methods of investigation.    There are two points in which scientific investigation differs from  ordinary pedigree-culture in practice. First the isolation of the  individuals and the study of individual inheritance, instead of  averages. Next comes the task of keeping records. Every individual must  be entered, its ancestry must be known as completely as possible, and  all its relations must be noted in such a form, that the most complete  reference is always possible. Mutations may come unexpectedly, and when  once arisen, their parents and grand-parents should be known. Records  must be available which will allow of a most complete knowledge of the  whole ancestral [22] line. This, and approximately this only, is the  essential difference between experimental and accidental observation.    Mutations are occurring from time to time in the wild state as well as  in horticulture and agriculture. A selection of the most interesting  instances will be given later. But in all such cases the experimental  proof is wanting. The observations as a rule, only began when the  mutation had made its appearance. A more or less vague remembrance about  the previous state of the plants in question might be available, though  even this is generally absent. But on doubtful points, concerning  possible crosses or possible introduction of foreign strains, mere  recollection is insufficient. The fact of the mutation may be very  probable, but the full proof is, of course, wanting. Such is the case  with the mutative origin of _Xanthium commune_ Wootoni from New Mexico  and of _Oenothera biennis cruciata_ from Holland. The same doubt exists  as to the origin of the _Capsella heegeri_ of Solms-Laubach, and of the  oldest recorded mutation, that of _Chelidonium laciniatum_ in Heidelberg  about 1600.    First, we have doubts about the fact itself. These, however, gradually  lose their importance in the increasing accumulation of evidence.  Secondly, the impossibility of a closer [23] inquiry into the real  nature of the change. For experimental purposes a single mutation does  not suffice; it must be studied repeatedly, and be produced more or less  arbitrarily, according to the nature of the problems to be solved. And  in order to do this, it is evidently not enough to have in hand the  mutated individual, but it is indispensable to have also the mutable  parents, or the mutable strain from which it sprang.    All conditions previous to the mutation are to be considered as of far  higher importance than all those subsequent to it.    Now mutations come unexpectedly, and if the ancestry of an accidental  mutation is to be known, it is of course necessary to keep accounts of  all the strains cultivated. It is evident that the required knowledge  concerning the ancestry of a supposed mutation, must necessarily nearly  all be acquired from the plants in the experimental garden.    Obviously this rule is as simple in theory, as it is difficult to carry  out in practice. First of all comes the book-keeping. The parents,  grandparents and previous ancestors must be known individually. Accounts  of them must be kept under two headings. A full description of their  individual character and peculiarities must always be available on the  one hand, and on the other, all facts concerning their hereditary [24]  qualities. These are to be deduced from the composition of the progeny,  and in order to obtain complete evidence on this point, two successive  generations are often required. The investigation must ascertain the  average condition of this offspring and the occurrence of any deviating  specimens, and for both purposes it is necessary to cultivate them in  relatively large numbers. It is obvious that, properly speaking, the  whole family of a mutated individual, including all its nearer and more  remote relatives, should be known and recorded.    Hence pedigree-book-keeping must become the general rule. Subordinate to  this are two further points, which should likewise be stated here. One  pertains to the pure or hybrid nature of the original strain, and the  other to the life-conditions and all other external influences. It is  manifest that a complete understanding of a mutation depends upon full  information upon these points.    All experiments must have a beginning. The starting-point may be a  single individual, or a small group of plants, or a lot of seeds. In  many cases the whole previous history is obscure, but sometimes a little  historical evidence is at hand. Often it is evident that the initial  material belongs to a pure species, but with respect to the question of  elementary species it is [25] not rarely open to doubt. Large numbers of  hybrid plants and hybrid races are in existence, concerning the origin  of which it is impossible to decide. It is impossible in many instances  to ascertain whether they are of hybrid or of pure origin. Often there  is only one way of determining the matter; it is to guess at the  probable parents in case of a cross and to repeat the cross. This is a  point which always requires great care in the interpretation of unusual  facts.    Three cases are to be distinguished as to heredity. Many plants are so  constituted as to be fertilized with their own pollen. In this case the  visits of insects have simply to be excluded, which may be done by  covering plants with iron gauze or with bags of prepared paper.  Sometimes they fertilize themselves without any aid, as for instance,  the common evening-primrose; in other cases the pollen has to be placed  on the stigma artificially, as with Lamarck's evening-primrose and its  derivatives. Other plants need cross-fertilization in order to produce a  normal yield of seeds. Here two individuals have always to be combined,  and the pedigree becomes a more complicated one. Such is the case with  the toad-flax, which is nearly sterile with its own pollen. But even in  these cases the visits of insects bringing pollen [26] from other  plants, must be carefully excluded. A special lecture will be devoted to  this very interesting source of impurity and of uncertainty in ordinary  cultures.    Of course, crosses may lie in the proposed line of work, and this is the  third point to be alluded to. They must be surrounded with the same  careful isolation and protection against bees, as any other  fertilizations. And not only the seed-parent, but also the pollen must  be kept pure from all possible foreign admixtures.    A pure and accurately recorded ancestry is thus to be considered as the  most important condition of success in experimental plant breeding. Next  to this comes the gathering of the seeds of each individual separately.  Fifty or sixty, and often more, bags of seeds are by no means uncommon  for a single experiment, and in ordinary years the harvest of my garden  is preserved in over a thousand separate lots.    Complying with these conditions, the origin of species may be seen as  easily as any other phenomenon. It is only necessary to have a plant in  a mutable condition. Not all species are in such a state at present, and  therefore I have begun by ascertaining which were stable and which were  not. These attempts, of"]]]
