Every evil passion was allowed to revel with impunity, and  revenge, lust, and avarice,--each had its hundred victims in unhappy  Semlin. Any maniac can kindle a conflagration, but it requires many  wise men to put it out. Peter the Hermit had blown the popular fury  into a flame, but to cool it again was beyond his power. His followers  rioted unrestrained, until the fear of retaliation warned them to  desist. When the King of Hungary was informed of the disasters of  Semlin, he marched with a sufficient force to chastise the Hermit, who  at the news broke up his camp and retreated towards the Morava, a broad  and rapid stream that joins the Danube a few miles to the eastward of  Belgrade. Here a party of indignant Bulgarians awaited him, and so  harassed him as to make the passage of the river a task both of  difficulty and danger. Great numbers of his infatuated followers  perished in the waters, and many fell under the swords of the  Bulgarians. The ancient chronicles do not mention the amount of the  Hermit's loss at this passage, but represent it in general terms as  very great.    At Nissa the Duke of Bulgaria fortified himself, in fear of an assault;  but Peter, having learned a little wisdom from experience, thought it  best to avoid hostilities. He passed three nights in quietness under  the walls, and the duke, not wishing to exasperate unnecessarily so  fierce and rapacious a host, allowed the townspeople to supply them  with provisions. Peter took his departure peaceably on the following  morning, but some German vagabonds falling behind the main body of the  army, set fire to the mills and house of a Bulgarian, with whom, it  appears, they had had some dispute on the previous evening. The  citizens of Nissa, who had throughout mistrusted the crusaders, and  were prepared for the worst, sallied out immediately, and took signal  vengeance. The spoilers were cut to pieces, and the townspeople  pursuing the Hermit, captured all the women and children who had lagged  in the rear, and a great quantity of baggage. Peter hereupon turned  round and marched back to Nissa, to demand explanation of the Duke of  Bulgaria. The latter fairly stated the provocation given, and the  Hermit could urge nothing in palliation of so gross an outrage. A  negotiation was entered into which promised to be successful, and the  Bulgarians were about to deliver up the women and children when a party  of undisciplined crusaders, acting solely upon their own suggestion,  endeavoured to scale the walls and seize upon the town. Peter in vain  exerted his authority; the confusion became general, and after a short  but desperate battle, the crusaders threw down their arms and fled in  all directions. Their vast host was completely routed, the slaughter  being so great among them as to be counted, not by hundreds, but by  thousands.    It is said that the Hermit fled from this fatal field to a forest a few  miles from Nissa, abandoned by every human creature. It would be  curious to know whether, after so dire a reverse,      . . . . . . . . . . \"His enpierced breast    Sharp sorrow did in thousand pieces rive,\"    or whether his fiery zeal still rose superior to calamity, and pictured  the eventual triumph of his cause. He, so lately the leader of a  hundred thousand men, was now a solitary skulker in the forests, liable  at every instant to be discovered by some pursuing Bulgarian, and cut  off in mid career. Chance at last brought him within sight of an  eminence where two or three of his bravest knights had collected five  hundred of the stragglers. These gladly received the Hermit, and a  consultation having taken place, it was resolved to gather together the  scattered remnants of the army. Fires were lighted on the hill, and  scouts sent out in all directions for the fugitives. Horns were sounded  at intervals to make known that friends were near, and before nightfall  the Hermit saw himself at the head of seven thousand men.  During the  succeeding day he was joined by twenty thousand more, and with this  miserable remnant of his force he pursued his route towards  Constantinople. The bones of the rest mouldered in the forests of  Bulgaria.    On his arrival at Constantinople, where he found Walter the Pennyless  awaiting him, he was hospitably received by the Emperor Alexius. It  might have been expected that the sad reverses they had undergone would  have taught his followers common prudence; but, unhappily for them,  their turbulence and love of plunder were not to be restrained.  Although they were surrounded by friends, by whom all their wants were  liberally supplied, they could not refrain from rapine. In vain the  Hermit exhorted them to tranquillity; he possessed no more power over  them, in subduing their passions, than the obscurest soldier of the  host, They set fire to several public buildings in Constantinople, out  of pure mischief, and stripped the lead from the roofs of the churches,  which, they afterwards sold for old metal in the purlieus of the city.  From this time may be dated the aversion which the Emperor Alexius  entertained for the crusaders, and which was afterwards manifested in  all his actions, even when he had to deal with the chivalrous and more  honourable armies which arrived after the Hermit. He seems to have  imagined that the Turks themselves were enemies less formidable to his  power than these outpourings of the refuse of Europe: he soon found a  pretext to hurry them into Asia Minor. Peter crossed the Bosphorus with  Walter, but the excesses of his followers were such, that, despairing  of accomplishing any good end by remaining at their head, he left them  to themselves, and returned to Constantinople, on the pretext of making  arrangements with the government of Alexius for a proper supply of  provisions. The crusaders, forgetting that they were in the enemy's  country, and that union, above all things, was desirable, gave  themselves up to dissensions. Violent disputes arose between the  Lombards and Normans, commanded by Walter the Pennyless, and the Franks  and Germans, led out by Peter. The latter separated themselves from the  former, and, choosing for their leader one Reinaldo, or Reinhold,  marched forward, and took possession of the fortress of Exorogorgon.  The Sultan Solimaun was on the alert, with a superior force. A party of  crusaders, which had been detached from the fort, and stationed at a  little distance as an ambuscade, were surprised and cut to pieces, and  Exorogorgon invested on all sides. The siege was protracted for eight  days, during which the Christians suffered the most acute agony from  the want of water. It is hard to say how long the hope of succour or  the energy of despair would have enabled them to hold out: their  treacherous leader cut the matter short by renouncing the Christian  faith, and delivering up the fort into the hands of the Sultan. He was  followed by two or three of his officers; all the rest, refusing to  become Mahometans, were ruthlessly put to the sword. Thus perished the  last wretched remnant of the vast multitude which had traversed Europe  with Peter the Hermit.    Walter the Pennyless and his multitude met as miserable a fate. On the  news of the disasters of Exorogorgon, they demanded to be led instantly  against the Turks. Walter, who only wanted good soldiers to have made a  good general, was cooler of head, and saw all the dangers of such a  step. His force was wholly insufficient to make any decisive movement  in a country where the enemy was so much superior, and where, in case  of defeat, he had no secure position to fall back upon; and he  therefore expressed his opinion against advancing until the arrival of  reinforcements. This prudent counsel found no favour: the army loudly  expressed their dissatisfaction at their chief, and prepared to march  forward without him. Upon this, the brave Walter put himself at their  head, and rushed to destruction. Proceeding towards Nice, the modern  Isnik, he was intercepted by the army of the Sultan: a fierce battle  ensued in which the Turks made fearful havoc; out of twenty-five  thousand Christians, twenty-two thousand were slain, and among them  Gautier himself, who fell pierced by seven mortal wounds. The remaining  three thousand retreated upon Civitot, where they intrenched themselves.    Disgusted as was Peter the Hermit at the excesses of the multitude,  who, at his call, had forsaken Europe, his heart was moved with grief  and pity at their misfortunes. All his former zeal revived: casting  himself at the feet of the Emperor Alexius, he implored him, with tears  in his eyes, to send relief to the few survivors at Civitot. The  Emperor consented, and a force was sent, which arrived just in time to  save them from destruction. The Turks had beleaguered the place, and  the crusaders were reduced to the last extremity.  Negotiations were  entered into, and the last three thousand were conducted in safety to  Constantinople. Alexius had suffered too much by their former excesses  to be very desirous of retaining them in his capital: he therefore  caused them all to be disarmed, and, furnishing each with a sum of  money, he sent them back to their own country.  While these events were  taking place, fresh hordes were issuing from the woods and wilds of  Germany, all bent for the Holy Land. They were commanded by a fanatical  priest, named Gottschalk, who, like Gautier and Peter the Hermit, took  his way through Hungary. History is extremely meagre in her details of  the conduct and fate of this host, which amounted to at least one  hundred thousand men. Robbery and murder seem to have journeyed with  them, and the poor Hungarians were rendered almost desperate by their  numbers and rapacity. Karloman, the king of the country, made a bold  effort "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/714"],[0,"The Bobbsey Twins in the Country (#5)"],[1,"ar--those--those--\"    \"Crickets,\" Harry told him, \"and tree toads and katydids. Oh, there's  lots to listen to if you shouldn't feel sleepy.\"    The house was now all quiet, and even the boys had ceased whispering.  Suddenly there was a noise in the driveway!    The next minute someone called out in the night!    \"Hello there! All asleep! Wake up, somebody!\"    Even Freddie did wake up and ran into his mother's room.    \"Come down here, Mr. Bobbsey,\" the voice continued.    \"Oh, is that you, Peter? I'll be down directly,\" called back Uncle  Daniel, who very soon after appeared on the front porch.    \"Well, I declare!\" Uncle Daniel exclaimed, loud enough for all the  listeners at the windows to hear. \"So you've got her? Well, I'm very  glad indeed. Especially on the boys' account.\"    \"Yes,\" spoke out Peter Burns, \"I went in the barn a while ago with the  lantern, and there wasn't your calf asleep with mine as cozy as could  be. I brought her over to-night for fear you might miss her and get to  lookin', otherwise I wouldn't have disturbed you.\"    By this time the man from the barn was up and out too, and he took  Frisky back to her own bed; but not until the little calf had been  taken far out on the front lawn so that Freddie could see her from the  window \"to make sure.\"    \"The Lord did bring her back,\" Freddie told his mamma as she kissed him  good-night again and put him in his bed, happier this time than before.  \"And I promised to be awful good to pay Him for His trouble,\" the  sleepy boy murmured.    Flossie had been asleep about two hours when she suddenly called to her  mother.    \"What is it, my dear?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey.    \"Somebody is playing the piano,\" answered the little girl. \"Who is it?\"    \"Nobody is playing. You must be dreaming,\" answered the mother, and  smiled to herself.    \"No, I am sure I heard the piano,\" insisted Flossie.    Mother and daughter listened, but could hear nothing.    \"You were surely dreaming,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey. \"Come, I will tuck you  in again,\" and she did so.    But was Flossie dreaming? Let us wait and see.        CHAPTER VII    A COUNTRY PICNIC    When morning came everyone was astir early, for not only was a happy  day promised, but there was Frisky, the runaway, to be looked over. Mr.  Richard Bobbsey, Freddie's father, left on an early train for Lakeport,  and would not come back to Meadow Brook until Saturday afternoon.    \"Let me go out and see Frisky,\" Freddie insisted, even before his  breakfast had been served. \"I want to be sure it's her.\"    \"Yes, that's her,\" Freddie admitted, \"'cause there's the rope that cut  my hands when I was a real fireman!\"    But Frisky didn't seem to care a bit about ropes or firemen, but just  chewed and chewed like all cows do, as if there was nothing in this  world to do but eat.    \"Come on, sonny,\" called Dinah. \"You can help me pick de radishes fo'  breakfast,\" and presently our little boy, with the kind-hearted maid,  was up in the garden looking for the best radishes of the early crop.    \"See, Freddie,\" said Dinah. \"De red ones show above de ground. And we  must only pull de ones wid de big leaves, 'cause dey're ripe.\"    Freddie bent down so close to find the radishes that a disturbed toad  hopped right up at his nose.    \"Oh!\" he cried, frightened. \"Dinah, was that--a--a--a snake?\"    \"Snake, chile; lan' sakes alive! Dat was a poor little toady--more  scare' den you was,\" and she pointed to the big dock leaf under which  the hop-toad was now hiding.    \"Let's pick beans,\" Freddie suggested, liking the garden work.    \"Not beans fer breakfast,\" laughed Dinah.    \"That stuff there, then,\" the boy persisted, pointing to the soft green  leaves of early lettuce.    \"Well, I dunno. Martha didn't say so, but it sure does look pretty.  Yes, I guess we kin pick some fo' salad,\" and so Dinah showed Freddie  how to cut the lettuce heads off and leave the stalks to grow again.    \"Out early,\" laughed Uncle Daniel, seeing the youngest member of the  family coming down the garden path with the small basket of vegetables.    \"Is it?\" Freddie asked, meaning early of course, in his queer way of  saying things without words.    \"See! see!\" called Nan and Flossie, running down the cross path back of  the cornfield.    \"Such big ones!\" Nan exclaimed, referring to the luscious red  strawberries in the white dish she held.    \"Look at mine,\" insisted Flossie. \"Aren't they bigger?\"    \"Fine!\" ejaculated Dinah.    \"But my redishes are-are--redder,\" argued Freddie, who was not to be  outdone by his sisters.    \"Ours are sweeter,\" laughed Nan, trying to tease her little brother.    \"Ours are--ours are--\"    \"Hotter,\" put in Dinah, which ended the argument.    Bert and Harry had also been out gathering for breakfast, and returned  now with a basket of lovely fresh water-cress.    \"We can't eat 'em all,\" Martha told the boys, \"But they'll go good in  the picnic lunch.\"    What a pretty breakfast table it was! Such berries, such lettuce, such  water-cress, and the radishes!    \"Too bad papa had to go so early,\" Bert remarked. \"He just loves green  stuff.\"    \"So does Frisky,\" put in Freddie, and he wondered why everyone laughed.    After breakfast the lunch baskets were put up and while Bert and Harry,  Nan and Aunt Sarah, went to invite the neighboring children, Flossie  and Freddie were just busy jumping around the kitchen, where Dinah and  Martha were making them laugh merrily with funny little stories.    Snoop and Fluffy had become good friends, and now lay close together on  the kitchen hearth. Dinah said they were just like two babies, only not  so much trouble.    \"Put peaches in my basket, Dinah,\" Freddie ordered.    \"And strawberries in mine,\" added Flossie.    \"Now, you-uns jest wait!\" Dinah told them; \"and when you gets out in de  woods if you hasn't 'nough to eat you kin jest climb a tree an' cut  down--\"    \"Wood!\" put in Freddie innocently, while Martha said that was about all  that could be found in the woods in July.    The boys had come in from inviting the \"other fellers,\" when Uncle  Daniel proposed a feature for the picnic.    \"How would you like to take two homer pigeons along?\" he asked them.  \"You can send a note back to Martha to say what time you will be home.\"    \"Jolly!\" chorused the boys, all instantly making a run for the pigeon  house.    \"Wait!\" Harry told the visitors. \"We must be careful not to scare  them.\" Then he went inside the wire cage with a handful of corn.    \"See--de--coon; see--de--coon!\" called the boys softly, imitating the  queer sounds made by the doves cooing.    Harry tossed the corn inside the cage, and as the light and dark homers  he wanted tasted the food Harry lowered the little door, and took the  birds safely in his arms.    \"Now, Bert, you can get the quills,\" he told his cousin. \"Go into the  chicken yard and look for two long goose feathers. Tom Mason, you can  go in the kitchen and ask Dinah for a piece of tissue paper and a spool  of silk thread.\"    Each boy started off to fulfill his commission, not knowing exactly  what for until all came together in the barnyard again.    \"Now, Bert,\" went on Harry, \"write very carefully on the slip of paper  the message for Martha. Have you a soft pencil?\"    Bert found that he had one, and so following his cousin's dictation he  wrote on one slip:    \"Have dinner ready at five.\" And on the other he wrote: \"John, come for  us at four.\"    \"Now,\" continued Harry, \"roll the slips up fine enough to go in the  goose quills.\"    This was done with much difficulty, as the quills were very narrow, but  the task was finally finished.    \"All ready now,\" concluded Harry, \"to put the letters in the box,\" and  very gently he tied with the silken thread one quill under the wing of  each pigeon. Only one feather was used to tie the thread to, and the  light quill, the thin paper, and the soft silk made a parcel so very  small and light in weight that the pigeons were no way inconvenienced  by the messages.    \"Now we'll put them in this basket, and they're ready for the picnic,\"  Harry announced to his much interested companions. Then all started for  the house with Harry and the basket in the lead.    John, the stableman, was at the door now with the big hay wagon, which  had been chosen as the best thing to take the jolly party in.    There was nice fresh hay in the bottom, and seats at the sides for the  grown folks, while the little ones nestled in the sweet-smelling hay  like live birds.    \"It's like a kindergarten party,\" laughed Nan, as the \"birds' nests\"  reminded her of one of the mother plays.    \"No, 'tain't!\" Freddie corrected, for he really was not fond of the  kindergarten. \"It's just like a picnic,\" he finished.    Besides the Bobbseys there were Tom Mason, Jack Hopkins, and August  Stout, friends of Harry. Then, there were Mildred Manners and Mabel  Herold, who went as Nan's guests; little Roy Mason was Freddie's  company, and Bessie Dimple went with Flossie. The little pigeons kept  cooing every now and then, but made no attempt to escape from Harry's  basket.    It was a beautiful day, and the long ride through the country was  indeed a merry one. Along the way people called out pleasantly from  farmhouses, for everybody in Meadow Brook knew the Bobbseys.    \"That's their cousins from the city,\" little boys and girls along the  way would say.    \"Haven't they pretty clothes!\" the girls were sure to add.    \"Let's stop for a drink at the spring,\" suggested August Stout, who was  stout by name and nature, and always loved a good drink of water.    The children tumbled out of the wagon safely, and were soon waiting  turns at the spring.    There was a round basin built of stones and quite deep. Into this the  clear sprinkling water dropped from a little cave in the hill above. On  top of the cave a large flat stone was placed. This kept the little  waterfall clean and free from the falling leaves.    \"Oh, what a cute little pond!\""]]]
