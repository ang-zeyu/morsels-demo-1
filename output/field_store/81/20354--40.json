Francois d'Espinay de Saint-Luc, sometimes called _Le Brave Saint      Luc_, was born in 1554, and was killed at the battle of Amiens on      the 8th of September, 1597. He was early appointed governor of      Saintonge, and of the Fortress of Brouage, which he successfully      defended in 1585 against the attack of the King of Navarre and the      Prince de Conde. He assisted at the battle of Coutras in 1587. He      served as a lieutenant-general in Brittany from 1592 to 1596. In      1594, he planned with Brissac, his brother-in-law, then governor      of Paris for the League, for the surrender of Paris to Henry      IV. For this he was offered the baton of a Marshal of France by      the king, which he modestly declined, and begged that it might be      given to Brissac. In 1578, through the influence or authority of      Henry III., he married the heiress, Jeanne de Cosse-Brissac,      sister of Charles de Cosse-Brissac, _postea_, a lady of no      personal attractions, but of excellent understanding and      character.  --_Vide Courcelle's Histoire Genealogique des Pairs de      France_, Vol.  II.; _Birch's Memoirs of Queen Elizabeth_, Vol. I.,      pp. 163, 191; _Freer's Henry III._, p. 162; _De Mezeray's      His.

He delivered up Paris, of which he was governor, to Henry IV. in 1594,      for which he received the Marshal's baton.

The service of Champlain as quarter-master in the war in Brittany commenced  probably with the appointment of Marshal d'Aumont to the command of the  army in 1592, and, if we are right in this conjecture, it covered a period  of not far from six years. The activity of the army, and the difficulty of  obtaining supplies in the general destitution of the province, imposed upon  him constant and perplexing duty. But in the midst of his embarrassments he  was gathering up valuable experience, not only relating to the conduct of  war, but to the transactions of business under a great variety of forms. He  was brought into close and intimate relations with men of character,  standing, and influence. The knowledge, discipline, and self-control of  which he was daily becoming master were unconsciously fitting him for a  career, humble though it might seem in its several stages, but nevertheless  noble and potent in its relations to other generations.    At the close of the war, the army which it had called into existence  was disbanded, the soldiers departed to their homes, the office of  quarter-master was of necessity vacated, and Champlain was left  without employment.    Casting about for some new occupation, following his instinctive love of  travel and adventure, he conceived the idea of attempting an exploration of  the Spanish West Indies, with the purpose of bringing back a report that  should be useful to France. But this was an enterprise not easy either to  inaugurate or carry out. The colonial establishments of Spain were at that  time hermetically sealed against all intercourse with foreign nations.  Armed ships, like watch-dogs, were ever on the alert, and foreign  merchantmen entered their ports only at the peril of confiscation. It was  necessary for Spain to send out annually a fleet, under a convoy of ships  of war, for the transportation of merchandise and supplies for the  colonies, returning laden with cargoes of almost priceless value.  Champlain, fertile in expedient, proposed to himself to visit Spain, and  there form such acquaintances and obtain such influence as would secure to  him in some way a passage to the Indies in this annual expedition.    The Spanish forces, allies of the League in the late war, had not yet  departed from the coast of France. He hastened to the port of Blavet, [18]  where they were about to embark, and learned to his surprise and  gratification that several French ships had been chartered, and that his  uncle, a distinguished French mariner, commonly known as the _Provencal  Cappitaine_, had received orders from Marshal de Brissac to conduct the  fleet, on which the garrison of Blavet was embarked, to Cadiz in Spain.  Champlain easily arranged to accompany his uncle, who was in command of the  \"St. Julian,\" a strong, well-built ship of five hundred tons.    Having arrived at Cadiz, and the object of the voyage having been  accomplished, the French ships were dismissed, with the exception of the  \"St. Julian,\" which was retained, with the Provincial Captain, who had  accepted the office of pilot-general for that year, in the service of the  King of Spain.    After lingering a month at Cadiz, they proceeded to St. Lucar de Barameda,  where Champlain remained three months, agreeably occupied in making  observations and drawings of both city and country, including a visit to  Seville, some fifty miles in the interior.    In the mean time, the fleet for the annual visit to the West Indies, to  which we have already alluded, was fitting out at Saint Lucar, and about to  sail under the command of Don Francisco Colombo, who, attracted by the size  and good sailing qualities of the \"Saint Julian,\" chartered her for the  voyage. The services of the pilot-general were required in another  direction, and, with the approbation of Colombo, he gave the command of the  \"Saint Julian\" to Champlain. Nothing could have been more gratifying than  this appointment, which assured to Champlain a visit to the more important  Spanish colonies under the most favorable circumstances.    He accordingly set sail with the fleet, which left Saint Lucar at the  beginning of January, 1599.    Passing the Canaries, in two months and six days they sighted the little  island of Deseada, [19] the _vestibule_ of the great Caribbean  archipelago, touched at Guadaloupe, wound their way among the group called  the Virgins, turning to the south made for Margarita, [20] then famous for  its pearl fisheries, and from thence sailed to St. Juan de Porto-rico. Here  the fleet was divided into three squadrons. One was to go to Porto-bello,  on the Isthmus of Panama, another to the coast of South America, then  called Terra Firma, and the third to Mexico, then known as New Spain. This  latter squadron, to which Champlain was attached, coasted along the  northern shore of the island of Saint Domingo, otherwise Hispaniola,  touching at Porto Platte, Mancenilla, Mosquitoes, Monte Christo, and Saint  Nicholas. Skirting the southern coast of Cuba, reconnoitring the Caymans,  [21] they at length cast anchor in the harbor of San Juan d'Ulloa, the  island fortress near Vera Cruz. While here, Champlain made an inland  journey to the City of Mexico, where he remained a month. He also sailed in  a _patache_, or advice-boat, to Porto-bello, when, after a month, he  returned again to San Juan d'Ulloa. The squadron then sailed for Havana,  from which place Champlain was commissioned to visit, on public business,  Cartagena, within the present limits of New Grenada, on the coast of South  America. The whole _armada_ was finally collected together at Havana,  and from thence took its departure for Spain, passing through the channel  of Bahama, or Gulf of Florida, sighting Bermuda and the Azores, reaching  Saint Lucar early in March, 1601, after an absence from that port of two  years and two months. [22]    On Champlain's return to France, he prepared an elaborate report of his  observations and discoveries, luminous with sixty-two illustrations  sketched by his own hand. As it was his avowed purpose in making the voyage  to procure information that should be valuable to his government, he  undoubtedly communicated it in some form to Henry IV. The document remained  in manuscript two hundred and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6659"],[0,"History of King Charles the Second of England (#5)"],[1,"morning,  but that she must remember that, by the marriage treaty, _he_ was to  appoint those officers. She said, in reply, that a part of those whom  she had named were English. The king said that he would look at the  paper in the morning, and such of the English names as he approved he  would confirm, but that he could not appoint any Frenchmen. The queen  answered that she and her mother had selected the men whom she had  named, and she would not have any body else. Charles rejoined that the  business was not either in her power or her mother's, and if she relied  on such an influence to effect her wishes, he would not appoint _any  body_ that she recommended. The queen was very much hurt at this, and  began to be angry. She said that if she could not put in whom she  chose, to have the care of her property, she would not have any such  property. He might take back her houses and lands, and allow her what  he pleased in money in its stead. Charles replied by telling her to  remember whom she was speaking to; that he could not be treated in  that manner; and then the queen, giving way to lamentations and tears,  said she was wretched and miserable; every thing that she wanted was  denied her, and whatever she recommended was refused on the very account  of her recommendation. Charles tried to speak, but she would not hear;  she went on with her lamentations and complaints, interrupted only by  her own sobs of passion and grief.    The reader may perhaps imagine that this must have been an extreme and  unusual instance of dissension between this royal pair; but it was  not. Cases of far greater excitement and violence sometimes occurred.  The French servants and attendants, whom the queen very naturally  preferred, and upon whom the king was as naturally inclined to look  with suspicion and ill will, were a continual source of disagreement  between them. At last, one afternoon, the king, happening to come into  that part of the palace at Whitehall where the queen's apartments were  situated, and which was called \"the queen's side\", found there a number  of her gentlemen and lady attendants in a great frolic, capering and  dancing in a way which the gay Frenchmen probably considered nothing  extraordinary, but which King Charles regarded as very irreverent and  unsuitable conduct to be witnessed in the presence of an English queen.  He was very much displeased. He advanced to Henrietta, took her by the  arm, conducted her sternly to his own side of the palace, brought her  into one of his own apartments, and locked the door. He then sent an  officer to direct all the French servants and attendants in the queen's  apartments to leave the palace immediately, and repair to Somerset  House, which was not far distant, and remain there till they received  further orders. The officer executed these commands in a very rough  manner. The French women shrieked and cried, and filled the court yard  of the palace with their clamor; but the officer paid no regard to  this noise. He turned them all out of the apartments, and locked the  doors after them.    The queen was rendered quite frantic with vexation and rage at these  proceedings. She flew to the windows to see and to bid farewell to her  friends, and to offer them expressions of her sympathy. The king pulled  her away, telling her to be quiet and submit, for he was determined  that they should go. The queen was determined that she would not submit.  She attempted to open the windows; the king held them down. Excited  now to a perfect frenzy in the struggle, she began to break out the  panes with her fist, while Charles exerted all his force to restrain  and confine her, by grasping her wrists and endeavoring to force her  away. What a contrast between the low and sordid selfishness and  jealousy evinced in such dissensions as these, and the lofty and heroic  devotedness and fidelity which this wife afterward evinced for her  husband in the harassing cares the stormy voyages, and the martial  exposures and fatigues which she endured for his sake! And yet,  notwithstanding this great apparent contrast, and the wide difference  in the estimation which mankind form of the conduct of the actor in  these different scenes, still we can see that it is, after all, the  impulse of the same lofty and indomitable spirit which acted in both.  The soul itself of the queen was not altered, nor even the character  of her action. The change was in the object and aim. In the one case  she was contending against the authority of a husband, to gain petty  and useless victories in domestic strife; in the other, the same spirit  and energy were expended in encountering the storms and tempests of  outward adversity to sustain her husband and protect her children.  Thus the change was a change of circumstances rather than of character.    The change was, however, none the less important on that account in  its influence on the king. It restored to him the affection and sympathy  of his wife, and filled his heart with inward happiness. It was a  joyous change to him, though it was produced by sufferings and sorrows;  for it was the very pressure of outward calamity that made his wife  his friend again, and restored his domestic peace. In how many thousand  instances is the same effect produced in a still more striking manner,  though on a less conspicuous stage, than in the case of this royal  pair! And how many thousands of outwardly prosperous families there  are, from which domestic peace and happiness are gone, and nothing but  the pressure from without of affliction or calamity can ever restore  them!    In consequence, in a great measure, of Henrietta's efficient help, the  king's affairs greatly improved, and, for a time, it seemed as if he  would gain an ultimate and final victory over his enemies, and recover  his lost dominion. He advanced to Oxford, and made his head quarters  there, and commenced the preparations for once more getting possession  of the palaces and fortresses of London. He called together a Parliament  at Oxford; some members came, and were regularly organized in the two  houses of Lords and Commons, while the rest remained at London and  continued their sittings there. Thus there were two governments, two  Parliaments, and two capitals in England, and the whole realm was rent  and distracted by the respective claims of these contending powers  over the allegiance of the subjects and the government of the realm.          CHAPTER III.    QUEEN HENRIETTA'S FLIGHT.        The brightening of the prospects in King Charles's affairs which was  produced, for a time, by the queen's vigorous and energetic action,  proved to be only a temporary gleam after all. The clouds and darkness  soon returned again, and brooded over his horizon more gloomily than  ever. The Parliament raised and organized new and more powerful armies.  The great Republican general, Oliver Cromwell, who afterward became  so celebrated as the Protector in the time of the Commonwealth, came  into the field, and was very successful in all his military plans.  Other Republican generals appeared in all parts of the kingdom, and  fought with great determination and great success, driving the armies  of the king before them wherever they moved, and reducing town after  town, and castle after castle, until it began to appear evident that  the whole kingdom would soon fall into their hands.    In the mean time, the family of the queen were very much separated  from each other, the children having been left in various places,  exposed each to different privations and dangers. Two or three of them  were in London in the hands of their father's enemies. Mary, the young  bride of the Prince of Orange, was in Holland. Prince Charles, the  oldest son, who was now about fourteen years of age, was at the head  of one of his father's armies in the west of England. Of course, such  a boy could not be expected to accomplish any thing as a general, or  even to exercise any real military command. He, however, had his place  at the head of a considerable force, and though there were generals  with him to conduct all the operations, and to direct the soldiery,  they were nominally the lieutenants of the prince, and acted, in all  cases, in their young commander's name. Their great duty was, however,  after all, to take care of their charge; and the army which accompanied  Charles was thus rather an escort and a guard, to secure his safety,  than a force from which any aid was to be expected in the recovery of  the kingdom.    The queen did every thing in her power to sustain the sinking fortunes  of her husband, but in vain. At length, in June, 1644, she found herself  unable to continue any longer such warlike and masculine exposures and  toils. It became necessary for her to seek some place of retreat, where  she could enjoy, for a time at least, the quiet and repose now essential  to the preservation of her life. Oxford was no longer a place of safety.  The Parliament had ordered her impeachment on account of her having  brought in arms and munitions of war from foreign lands, to disturb,  as they said, the peace of the kingdom. The Parliamentary armies were  advancing toward Oxford, and she was threatened with being shut up and  besieged there. She accordingly left Oxford, and went down to the sea-  coast to Exeter, a strongly fortified place, on a hill surrounded in  part by other hills, and very near the sea. There was a palace within  the walls, where the queen thought she could enjoy, for a time at  least, the needed seclusion and repose. The king accompanied her for  a few miles on her journey, to a place called Abingdon, which is in  the neighborhood of Oxford, and there the unhappy pair bade each other  farewell, with much grief and many tears. They never met again.    Henrietta continued her sorrowful journey alone. She reached the sea-  coast in the south-western part of England, where Exeter is situated,  "]]]
