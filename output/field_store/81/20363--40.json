Quickly she set on her own light curls    Her mother's fillet with fringes of pearls;      Quickly she turned with a child's caprice    And pressed on the mirror a swift, glad kiss.

Tarry a while, O Death, I cannot die    With all my blossoming hopes unharvested,    My joys ungarnered, all my songs unsung,    And all my tears unshed.      Tarry a while, till I am satisfied    Of love and grief, of earth and altering sky;    Till all my human hungers are fulfilled,    O Death, I cannot die!        THE INDIAN GIPSY      In tattered robes that hoard a glittering trace    Of bygone colours, broidered to the knee,    Behold her, daughter of a wandering race,    Tameless, with the bold falcon's agile grace,    And the lithe tiger's sinuous majesty.      With frugal skill her simple wants she tends,    She folds her tawny heifers and her sheep    On lonely meadows when the daylight ends,    Ere the quick night upon her flock descends    Like a black panther from the caves of sleep.      Time's river winds in foaming centuries    Its changing, swift, irrevocable course    To far off and incalculable seas;    She is twin-born with primal mysteries,    And drinks of life at Time's forgotten source.        TO MY CHILDREN      Jaya Surya, aetat 4      Golden sun of victory, born    In my life's unclouded morn,    In my lambent sky of love,    May your growing glory prove    Sacred to your consecration,    To my heart and to my nation.    Sun of victory, may you be    Sun of song and liberty.        Padmaja, aetat 3      Lotus-maiden, you who claim    All the sweetness of your name,    Lakshmi, fortune's queen, defend you,    Lotus-born like you, and send you    Balmy moons of love to bless you,    Gentle joy-winds to caress you.    Lotus-maiden, may you be    Fragrant of all ecstasy.        Ranadheera, aetat 2      Little lord of battle, hail    In your newly-tempered mail!    Learn to conquer, learn to fight    In the foremost flanks of right,    Like Valmiki's heroes bold,    Rubies girt in epic gold.    Lord of battle, may you be,    Lord of love and chivalry.        Lilamani, aetat 1      Limpid jewel of delight    Severed from the tender night    Of your sheltering mother-mine,    Leap and sparkle, dance and shine,    Blithely and securely set    In love's magic coronet.    Living jewel, may you be    Laughter-bound and sorrow-free.        THE PARDAH NASHIN      Her life is a revolving dream    Of languid and sequestered ease;    Her girdles and her fillets gleam    Like changing fires on sunset seas;    Her raiment is like morning mist,    Shot opal, gold and amethyst.      From thieving light of eyes impure,    From coveting sun or wind's caress,    Her days are guarded and secure    Behind her carven lattices,    Like jewels in a turbaned crest,    Like secrets in a lover's breast.      But though no hand unsanctioned dares    Unveil the mysteries of her grace,    Time lifts the curtain unawares,    And Sorrow looks into her face . . .    Who shall prevent the subtle years,    Or shield a woman's eyes from tears?        TO YOUTH      O Youth, sweet comrade Youth, wouldst thou be gone?    Long have we dwelt together, thou and I;    Together drunk of many an alien dawn,    And plucked the fruit of many an alien sky.      Ah, fickle friend, must I, who yesterday    Dreamed forwards to long, undimmed ecstasy,    Henceforward dream, because thou wilt not stay,    Backward to transient pleasure and to thee?      I give thee back thy false, ephemeral vow;    But, O beloved comrade, ere we part,    Upon my mournful eyelids and my brow    Kiss me who hold thine image in my heart.        NIGHTFALL IN THE CITY OF HYDERABAD      See how the speckled sky burns like a pigeon's throat,    Jewelled with embers of opal and peridote.      See the white river that flashes and scintillates,    Curved like a tusk from the mouth of the city-gates.      Hark, from the minaret, how the muezzin's call    Floats like a battle-flag over the city wall.      From trellised balconies, languid and luminous    Faces gleam, veiled in a splendour voluminous.      Leisurely elephants wind through the winding lanes,    Swinging their silver bells hung from their silver chains.      Round the high Char Minar sounds of gay cavalcades    Blend with the music of cymbals and serenades.      Over the city bridge Night comes majestical,    Borne like a queen to a sumptuous festival.        STREET CRIES      When dawn's first cymbals beat upon the sky,    Rousing the world to labour's various cry,    To tend the flock, to bind the mellowing grain,    From ardent toil to forge a little gain,    And fasting men go forth on hurrying feet,    BUY BREAD, BUY BREAD, rings down the eager street.      When the earth falters and the waters swoon    With the implacable radiance of noon,    And in dim shelters koils hush their notes,    And the faint, thirsting blood in languid throats    Craves liquid succour from the cruel heat,    BUY FRUIT, BUY FRUIT, steals down the panting street.      When twilight twinkling o'er the gay bazaars,    Unfurls a sudden canopy of stars,    When lutes are strung and fragrant torches lit    On white roof-terraces where lovers sit    Drinking together of life's poignant sweet,    BUY FLOWERS, BUY FLOWERS, floats down the singing street.        TO INDIA      O young through all thy immemorial years!    Rise, Mother, rise, regenerate from thy gloom,    And, like a bride high-mated with the spheres,    Beget new glories from thine ageless womb!      The nations that in fettered darkness weep    Crave thee to lead them where great mornings break . . . .    Mother, O Mother, wherefore dost thou sleep?    Arise and answer for thy children's sake!      Thy Future calls thee with a manifold sound    To crescent honours, splendours, victories vast;    Waken, O slumbering Mother and be crowned,    Who once wert empress of the sovereign Past.        THE ROYAL TOMBS OF GOLCONDA      I muse among these silent fanes    Whose spacious darkness guards your dust;    Around me sleep the hoary plains    That hold your ancient wars in trust.    I pause, my dreaming spirit hears,    Across the wind's unquiet tides,    The glimmering music of your spears,    The laughter of your royal brides.      In vain, O Kings, doth time aspire    To make your names oblivion's sport,    While yonder hill wears like a tier    The ruined grandeur of your fort.    Though centuries falter and decline,    Your proven strongholds shall remain    Embodied memories of your line,    Incarnate legends of your reign.      O Queens, in vain old Fate decreed    Your flower-like bodies to the tomb;    Death is in truth the vital seed    Of your imperishable bloom    Each new-born year the bulbuls sing    Their songs of your renascent loves;    Your beauty wakens with the spring    To kindle these pomegranate groves.        TO A BUDDHA SEATED ON A LOTUS      Lord Buddha, on thy Lotus-throne,    With praying eyes and hands elate,    What mystic rapture dost thou own,    Immutable and ultimate?    What peace, unravished of our ken,    Annihilate from the world of men?      The wind of change for ever blows    Across the tumult of our way,    To-morrow's unborn griefs depose    The sorrows of our yesterday.    Dream yields to dream, strife follows strife,      And Death unweaves the webs of Life.      For us the travail and the heat,    The broken secrets of our pride,    The strenuous lessons of defeat,    The flower deferred, the fruit denied;    But not the peace, supremely won,    Lord Buddha, of thy Lotus-throne.      With futile hands we seek to gain    Our inaccessible desire,    Diviner summits to attain,    With faith that sinks and feet that tire;    But nought shall conquer or control    The heavenward hunger of our soul.      The end, elusive and afar,    Still lures us with its beckoning flight,    And all our mortal moments are    A session of the Infinite.    How shall we reach the great, unknown    Nirvana of thy Lotus-throne?

The ruling motive which led most of them to the  wilds was that Anglo-Saxon lust of land which seems inseparable from  the race. The prospect of possessing a four-hundred-acre farm by  merely occupying it, and the privilege of exchanging a basketful of  almost worthless continental currency for an unlimited estate at the  nominal value of forty cents per acre, were irresistible to thousands  of land-loving Virginians and Carolinians whose ambition of  proprietorship was larger than their means. Accompanying this flood of  emigrants of good faith was the usual froth and scum of shiftless  idlers and adventurers, who were either drifting with a current they  were too worthless to withstand, or in pursuit of dishonest gains in  fresher and simpler regions. The vices and virtues of the pioneers  were such as proceeded from their environment. They were careless of  human life because life was worth comparatively little in that hard  struggle for existence; but they had a remarkably clear idea of the  value of property, and visited theft not only with condign punishment,  but also with the severest social proscription. Stealing a horse was  punished more swiftly and with more feeling than homicide. A man might  be replaced more easily than the other animal. Sloth was the worst of  weaknesses. An habitual drunkard was more welcome at \"raisings\" and  \"logrollings\" than a known faineant. The man who did not do a man's  share where work was to be done was christened \"Lazy Lawrence,\" and  that was the end of him socially. Cowardice was punished by inexorable  disgrace. The point of honor was as strictly observed as it ever has  been in the idlest and most artificial society. If a man accused  another of falsehood, the ordeal by fisticuffs was instantly resorted  to. Weapons were rarely employed in these chivalrous encounters, being  kept for more serious use with Indians and wild beasts; nevertheless  fists, teeth, and the gouging thumb were often employed with fatal  effect. Yet among this rude and uncouth people there was a genuine and  remarkable respect for law. They seemed to recognize it as an absolute  necessity of their existence. In the territory of Kentucky, and  afterwards in that of Illinois, it occurred at several periods in the  transition from counties to territories and states, that the country  was without any organized authority. But the people were a law unto  themselves. Their improvised courts and councils administered law and  equity; contracts were enforced, debts were collected, and a sort of  order was maintained. It may be said, generally, that the character of  this people was far above their circumstances. In all the accessories  of life, by which we are accustomed to rate communities and races in  the scale of civilization, they were little removed from primitive  barbarism. They dressed in the skins of wild beasts killed by  themselves, and in linen stuffs woven by themselves. They hardly knew  the use of iron except in their firearms and knives. Their food  consisted almost exclusively of game, fish, and roughly ground corn-  meal. Their exchanges were made by barter; many a child grew up  without ever seeing a piece of money. Their habitations were hardly  superior to those of the savages with whom they waged constant war.  Large families lived in log huts, put together without iron, and far  more open to the inclemencies of the skies than the pig-styes of the  careful farmer of to-day. An early schoolmaster says that the first  place where he went to board was the house of one Lucas, consisting of  a single room, sixteen feet square, and tenanted by Mr. and Mrs.  Lucas, ten children, three dogs, two cats, and himself. There were  many who lived in hovels so cold that they had to sleep on their shoes  to keep them from freezing too stiff to be put on. The children grew  inured to misery like this, and played barefoot in the snow. It is an  error to suppose that all this could be undergone with impunity. They  suffered terribly from malarial and rheumatic complaints, and the  instances of vigorous and painless age were rare among them. The lack  of moral and mental sustenance was still more marked. They were  inclined to be a religious people, but a sermon was an unusual luxury,  only to be enjoyed at long intervals and by great expense of time.  There were few books or none, and there was little opportunity for the  exchange of opinion. Any variation in the dreary course of events was  welcome. A murder was not without its advantages as a stimulus to  conversation; a criminal trial was a kind of holiday to a county. It  was this poverty of life, this famine of social gratification, from  which sprang their fondness for the grosser forms of excitement, and  their tendency to rough and brutal practical joking. In a life like  theirs a laugh seemed worth having at any expense.    [Illustration:   HOUSE NEAR BEECHLAND, KENTUCKY, IN WHICH THOMAS LINCOLN  AND NANCY HANKS WERE MARRIED.]    But near as they were to barbarism in all the circumstances of their  daily existence, they were far from it politically. They were the  children of a race which had been trained in government for centuries  in the best school the world has ever seen, and wherever they went  they formed the town, the county, the court, and the legislative power  with the ease and certainty of nature evolving its results. And this  they accomplished in the face of a savage foe surrounding their feeble  settlements, always alert and hostile, invisible and dreadful as the  visionary powers of the air. Until the treaty of Greenville, in 1795,  closed the long and sanguinary history of the old Indian wars, there  was no day in which the pioneer could leave his cabin with the  certainty of not finding it in ashes when he returned, and his little  flock murdered on his threshold, or carried into a captivity worse  than death. Whenever nightfall came with the man of the house away  from home, the anxiety and care of the women and children were none  the less bitter because so common.    [Illustration:   MAP SHOWING VARIOUS LOCALITIES CONNECTED WITH EARLY  EVENTS IN THE LINCOLN FAMILY.]    The life of the pioneer Abraham Lincoln soon came to a disastrous  close. He had settled in Jefferson County, on the land he had bought  from the Government, and cleared a small farm in the forest.  [Footnote: Lyman C. Draper, of the Wisconsin Historical Society, has  kindly furnished us with a MS account of a Kentucky tradition  according to which the pioneer Abraham Lincoln was captured by the  Indians, near Crow's Station, in August, 1782, carried into captivity,  and forced to run the gauntlet. The story rests on the statement of a  single person, Mrs. Sarah Graham.] One morning in the year 1784, he  started with his three sons, Mordecai, Josiah, and Thomas, to the edge  of the clearing, and began the day's work. A shot from the brush  killed the father; Mordecai, the eldest son, ran instinctively to the  house, Josiah to the neighboring fort, for assistance, and Thomas, the  youngest, a child of six, was left with the corpse of his father.  Mordecai, reaching the cabin, seized the rifle, and saw through the  loophole an Indian in his war-paint stooping to raise the child from  the ground. He took deliberate aim at a white ornament on the breast  of the savage and brought him down. The little boy, thus released, ran  to the cabin, and Mordecai, from the loft, renewed his fire upon the  savages, who began to show themselves from the thicket, until Josiah  returned with assistance from the stockade, and the assailants fled.  This tragedy made an indelible impression on the mind of Mordecai.  Either a spirit of revenge for his murdered father, or a sportsmanlike  pleasure in his successful shot, made him a determined Indian-stalker,  and he rarely stopped to inquire whether the red man who came within  range of his rifle was friendly or hostile. [Footnote: Late in life  Mordecai Lincoln removed to Hancock County, Illinois, where his  descendants still live.]    [Illustration:   FAC-SIMILE OF THE MARRIAGE BOND OF THOMAS LINCOLN.]    The head of the family being gone, the widow Lincoln soon removed to a  more thickly settled neighborhood in Washington County. There her  children grew up. Mordecai and Josiah became reputable citizens; the  two daughters married two men named Crume and Brumfield. Thomas, to  whom were reserved the honors of an illustrious paternity, learned the  trade of a carpenter. He was an easy-going man, entirely without  ambition, but not without self-respect. Though the friendliest and  most jovial of gossips, he was not insensible to affronts; and when  his slow anger was roused he was a formidable adversary. Several  border bullies, at different times, crowded him indiscreetly, and were  promptly and thoroughly whipped. He was strong, well-knit, and sinewy;  but little over the medium height, though in other respects he seems  to have resembled his son in appearance.    On the 12th of June, 1806, [Footnote: All previous accounts give the  date of this marriage as September 23d. This error arose from a  clerical blunder in the county record of marriages. The minister, the  Rev. Jesse Head, in making his report, wrote the date before the  names; the clerk, copying it, lost the proper sequence of the entries,  and gave to the Lincolns the date belonging to the next couple on the  list.] while learning his trade in the carpenter shop of Joseph Hanks,  in Elizabethtown, he married Nancy Hanks, a niece of his employer,  near Beechland, in Washington County.
