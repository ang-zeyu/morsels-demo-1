The group wore protective clothing and respirators and spent  about 30 minutes in the area.  The remaining three men drove as close  as 320 meters southwest of ground zero to retrieve neutron detectors.  They got out of their vehicle only once, at about 460 meters from  ground zero, and spent a total of about ten minutes making this trip  through the area.  Each man's radiation exposure measured less than 1  roentgen (1).    Most of the soldiers of the evacuation detachment remained in their  bivouac area near Guard Post 2.  According to a report written by the  detachment commander, a reinforced platoon was sent to the town of  Bingham, about 29 kilometers northeast of the test site, while offsite  radiological safety monitors surveyed the area.  The evacuation  detachment was dismissed at 1300 hours on shot-day when it became  evident from offsite monitoring that evacuations would not be  undertaken.  The detachment returned to LASL at 0400 on 17 July (15).    Two B-29 aircraft from Kirtland Field, Albuquerque, New Mexico,  participated in post-shot events.  Their planned mission was to pass  over the test area shortly before the explosion to simulate a bomb  drop.  After the TRINITY device had been detonated, the aircraft would  circle near ground zero, while the men onboard would measure the  atmospheric effects of the nuclear explosion.  This would enable them  to determine whether a delivery aircraft would be endangered.  However, because of bad weather on shot-day, Dr. Oppenheimer canceled  the aircraft's flight in the ground zero area.  Instead, the two  B-29s, each with 12 men onboard, flew along the perimeter of the  bombing range and observed the shot from a distance of 19 to 29  kilometers.  Among those observers was a Navy captain who was also the  MED Chief of Ordnance (6; 12; 13).      2.3  ACTIVITIES AFTER 16 JULY 1945    On 17, 18, and 19 July, all personnel and visitors had to receive  permission to approach ground zero from the \"Going-in Board.\"  On  these three days, 21 groups were authorized to go beyond the Broadway  roadblocks.  Most of those who sought this authorization were  scientists and military support personnel whose job required that they  work near ground zero.  Except for a group of two military men and  three civilians who went to ground zero on 16 and 17 July and a group  of two civilians who approached as close as 90 meters on 18 July, the  reentry personnel came no closer than 180 meters to ground zero.  Of  these personnel, the individual who received the highest exposure  during the three days was an Army sergeant who received 15 roentgens.  During the same period, two civilians received 10 roentgens and 7.5  roentgens, respectively.  All other personnel received exposures of 5  roentgens or less (1; 3).    After the \"Going-In Board\" was disbanded on 19 July, permission to  enter the ground zero area had to be obtained from Dr. Bainbridge or  one of his deputies.  Many scientists entered the ground zero area  after 19 July to retrieve instruments or to perform experiments.  The  population of the TRINITY test site was diminishing, however, as the  emphasis shifted to preparing the devices that were to be dropped on  Japan (1).    On 23 July, a week after the shot, chain barricades with prominent  signs warning against trespassing were placed 910 meters north, south,  and west of ground zero.  These barricades were supplemented with two  concentric circles of red flags 1,830 and 2,740 meters from ground  zero.  Except during bad weather, the entire ground zero area was  visible from the roadblocks.  No unauthorized person was ever detected  entering the ground zero area (1).    On 10 August, the Broadway roadblocks were removed, and mounted  military policemen began patrolling around ground zero at a distance  of 730 meters.  Each guard was assigned to a daily six-hour shift for  a period of two weeks; in the third week, the guard was assigned tasks  away from the ground zero area.  The mounted guards and their horses  wore film badges.  No exposure greater than 0.1 roentgen was  registered.  On 1 September, the mounted patrol moved to a distance of  460 meters from ground zero, just outside a fence installed a week  earlier to seal off the area.  The same rotating patrol schedule was  used.  The guards' film badge readings showed an average daily  exposure of 0.02 roentgens.  The mounted patrol at the fence continued  until early 1947 (1).    Between 20 July 1945 and 21 November 1945, 67 groups entered the  ground zero area.  Most of these parties entered in the month after  shot-day.  These were the scientists and technicians conducting  experiments or retrieving data.  By the beginning of September, most  of those who entered the ground zero area were invited guests (1).    Also during the period 20 July through 21 November, at least 71  soldiers were at the TRINITY test site.  Twenty-five of these men were  support personnel who never went within 460 meters of ground zero.  The remaining 46 men were technical personnel, laborers who erected  the 460-meter fence, or military policemen who served as guides.  Eleven of these men, probably members of the fence detail, spent  several days at about 460 meters from ground zero.  Working three to  five hours per day between 9 August and 25 August, they would have  been the only group to stay longer than one hour in the ground zero  area.  Of the remaining personnel who approached within 460 meters  from ground zero, 25 spent 15 minutes and ten spent between 30 minutes  and one hour in the ground zero area.  Only 11 people received  exposures of 3 to 5 roentgens between 20 July and 21 November.  Most  received less than 1 roentgen.  After 21 November 1945, no one  approached closer than the fence which was 460 meters from ground  zero, although about 200 civilian and military personnel worked at or  visited the TRINITY site through 1946 (1; 16).    According to dosimetry data, entrance logs, and other records, about  1,000 individuals were at the test site at some time between 16 July  1945 and the end of 1946.  This number includes not only the  scientists, technicians, and military personnel who were part of  Project TRINITY but also many visitors.  Some of the scientists took  their wives and children on a tour of the area near ground zero,  particularly to view the green glass called \"trinitite,\" which covered  the crater floor.  Trinitite was the product of the detonation's  extreme beat, which melted and mixed desert sand, tower steel, and  other debris (1; 8; 9; 16).        CHAPTER 3    RADIATION PROTECTION AT PROJECT TRINITY      The TR-7 or Medical Group, shown in the figure 1-5 organizational  chart, was responsible for radiological safety at Project TRINITY.  Many of the physicians and scientists in the Medical Group had worked  with radioactive materials before and were trained in radiological  safety procedures.  The Chief of the Medical Group supervised the  radiological safety operations and reported to the TRINITY director.  In addition to providing medical care to TRINITY personnel, this group  established radiological safety programs to:    o Minimize radiation exposure of personnel on the test site and in  offsite areas    o Provide monitors to conduct radiological surveys onsite and offsite    o Provide and maintain radiation detection instruments    o Provide protective clothing and equipment.    An exposure limit of 5 roentgens during a two-month period was  established.  Personnel were provided with radiation detection  instruments to determine their exposures (1).      3.1  ORGANIZATION    The Medical Group consisted of physicians, scientists, and  administrators, as well as radiological monitors.  Many of these  personnel were nonmilitary, but all worked on the Manhattan Project  under the administration of the Army Corps of Engineers Manhattan  Engineer District.    The Medical Group was divided into two monitoring groups, the Site  Monitoring Group, which was responsible for onsite monitoring, and the  Offsite Monitoring Group.  Each reported to the Chief of the Medical  Group, and each communicated with the other during the monitoring  activities.  In addition to these two groups, a small group of medical  technicians provided radiation detection instruments to Medical Group  personnel (1; 10).      3.2  SITE MONITORING GROUP    The Site Monitoring Group consisted of a chief monitor, three other  monitors, and several medical doctors.  This group had the following  functions (1; 10):    o Conduct ground surveys of the test area and mark areas of  radioactivity    o Conduct surveys of the Base Camp and roads leading into the test  area    o Provide protective clothing and equipment, including film badges and  pocket dosimeters, to personnel    o Monitor all personnel for radioactive contamination and provide for  their decontamination    o Maintain a record of radiation exposures received by personnel.    The Site Monitoring Group monitored the radiation exposures of  personnel in the test area.  The time spent by personnel in radiation  areas was limited, and radiation detection instruments were provided  to permit continuous monitoring of exposure rates.  In many cases, a  monitor from the Site Monitoring Group accompanied project personnel  into the test area to monitor exposure rates (1; 10).    Two members of the Site Monitoring Group, a monitor and a physician  with radiological safety training, were assigned to each shelter.  The  supervising monitor was stationed at the Base Camp and was in radio  and telephone communication with all three shelters and the offsite  ground and aerial survey teams.  Before any personnel were allowed to  leave the shelter areas, a radiological safety monitor and a military  policeman from each shelter advanced along the roads to Broadway to  check radiation levels.  They wore respirators to prevent them from  inhaling radioactive"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5529"],[0,"The Bride of the Nile — Complete (#5)"],[1," her mature heart,  and sometimes at the young girl whom she was ill-pleased to see thus  preferred by this favorite of the gods. It was a deliciously warm, still  night, and the moon, which makes the ocean swell and flow, stirs the  tide of feeling to rise in the human breast.    Whatever Paula asked for Orion sang, as though nothing was unknown to  him that had ever sounded on a Greek lute; and the longer they went on  the clearer and richer his voice grew, the more melting and seductive  its expression, and the more urgently it appealed to the young girl's  heart. Paula gave herself up to the sweet enchantment, and when he laid  down the lute and asked in low tones if his native land was not lovely  on such a night as this, or which song she liked best, and whether she  had any idea of what it had been to him to find her in his parents'  house, she yielded to the charm and answered him in whispers like his  own.    Under the dense foliage of the sleeping garden he pressed her hand to  his lips, and she, tremulous, let him have his way.--Bitter, bitter  years lay behind her. The physician had spoken only too truly. The  hardest blows of fate had brought her--the proud daughter of a noble  father--to a course of cruel humiliations. The life of a friendless  though not penniless relation, taken into a wealthy house out of  charity, had proved a thorny path to tread, but now-since the day before  yesterday--all was changed. Orion had come. His home and the city had  held high festival on his return, as at some gift of Fortune, in  which she too had a goodly share. He had met her, not as the dependent  relative, but as a beautiful and high-born woman. There was sunshine in  his presence which warmed her very heart, and made her raise her head  once more like a flower that is brought out under the open sky after  long privation of light and air. His bright spirit and gladness of  life refreshed her heart and brain; the respect he paid her revived her  crushed self-confidence and filled her soul with fervent gratitude. Ah!  and how delightful it was to feel that she might be grateful, devotedly  grateful.--And then, then this evening had been hers, the sweetest, most  blessed that she had known for years. He had reminded her of what she  had almost forgotten: that she was still young, that she was  still lovely, that she had a right to be happy, to enchant and be  enchanted--perhaps even to love and to be loved.    Her hand was still conscious of his burning kiss as she entered the  cool room where the Lady Neforis sat awaiting the return of the party,  turning her spinning-wheel by the couch of her invalid husband who  always went to rest at late hours. It was with an overflowing heart that  Paula raised her uncle's hand to her lips--Orion's father, might she not  say HER Orion's?--Then she kissed her aunt--his mother, and it was  long since she had done so--as she and little Mary bid her good-night.  Neforis accepted the kiss coolly but with some surprise, and looked  up enquiringly at the girl and at her son. No doubt she thought many  things, but deemed it prudent to give them no utterance for the present.  She allowed the girl to retire as though nothing unusual had occurred,  superintended the servants who came to carry her husband into his  bedroom, gave him the white globule which was to secure him sleep, and  with indefatigable patience turned and moved his pillows till his  couch was to his mind. Not till then, nor till she was satisfied that a  servant was keeping watch in the adjoining room, did she leave him; and  then--for there was danger in delay--she went to seek her son.    This tall, large and rather too portly woman had been in her youth  a slender and elegant girl; a graceful creature though her calm and  expressionless features had never been strikingly beautiful. Age had  altered them but little; her face was now that of a good-looking, plump,  easy-going matron, which had lost its freshness through long and devoted  attendance on the sick man. Her birth and position gave her confidence  and self-reliance, but there was nothing gracious or captivating in  her individuality. The joys and woes of others were not hers; still she  could be moved and stirred by them, even to self-denial, and was very  capable of feeling quite a passionate interest for others; only, those  others must be her own immediate belongings and no one else. Thus a more  devoted and anxious wife, or a more loving mother would have been hard  to find; but, if we compare her faculty for loving with a star, its rays  were too short to reach further than to those nearest to her, and these  regarded it as an exceptional state of grace to be included within the  narrow circle of those beloved by her somewhat grudging soul.    She knocked at Orion's sitting-room, and he hailed her late visit with  surprise and pleasure. She had come to speak of a matter of importance,  and had done so promptly, for her son's and Paula's conduct just now  urged her to lose no time. Something was going on between these two  and her husband's niece was far outside the narrow limits of her loving  kindness.    This, she began by saying, would not allow her to sleep. She had but one  heart's desire and his father shared it: Orion must know full well what  she meant; she had spoken to him about it only yesterday. His father had  received him with warm affection, had paid his debts unhesitatingly and  without a word of reproach, and now it was his part to turn over a new  leaf: to break with his former reckless life and set up a home of his  own. The bride, as he knew, was chosen for him. \"Susannah was here just  now,\" she said. \"You scapegrace, she confessed that you had quite turned  her Katharina's little head this morning.\"    \"I am sorry for it,\" he interrupted in a tone of annoyance. \"These ways  with women have grown upon me as a habit; but I have done with them  henceforth. They are unworthy of me now, and I feel, my dear Mother....\"    \"That life is beginning in earnest,\" Neforis threw in. \"The wish which  brings me to you now entirely accords with that. You know what it is,  and I cannot imagine what you can have to say against it. In short, you  must let me settle the matter to-morrow with Dame Susannah. You are sure  of her daughter's affection, she is the richest heiress in the country,  well brought up, and as I said before, she has quite lost her little  heart to you.\"    \"And she had better have kept it!\" said Orion with a laugh.    Then his mother waxed wroth and exclaimed: \"I must beg you to reserve  your mirth for a more fitting season and for laughable things. I am very  much in earnest when I say: The girl is a sweet, good little creature  and will be a faithful and loving wife to you, under God. Or have  you left your heart in Constantinople? Has the Senator Justinus' fair  relation.--But nonsense! You can hardly suppose that that volatile Greek  girl....\"    Orion clasped her in his arms, and said tenderly, \"No, dearest mother,  no. Constantinople lies far, far behind me, in grey mist beyond the  farthest Thule; and here, close here, under my father's roof, I have  found something far more lovely and more perfect than has ever been  beheld by the dwellers on the Bosphorus. That little girl is no  match for a son of our stalwart and broad-shouldered race. Our future  generations must still tower proudly above the common herd in every  respect; I want no plaything for a wife, but a woman, such as you  yourself were in youth--tall, dignified and handsome. My heart goes  forth to no gold-crested wren but to a really royal maiden.--Of what use  to waste words! Paula, the noble daughter of a glorious father, is my  choice. It came upon me just now like a revelation; I ask your blessing  on my union with her!\"    So far had Neforis allowed her son to speak. He had frankly and  boldly uttered what she had indeed feared to hear. And so long she had  succeeded in keeping silence!--But now her patience gave way. Trembling  with anger she abruptly broke in, exclaiming, as her face grew crimson:    \"No more, no more! Heaven grant that this which I have been compelled  to hear may be no more than a fleeting and foolish whim! Have you  quite forgotten who and what we are? Have you forgotten that those were  Melchites who slew your two dear brothers--our two noble sons? Of what  account are we among the orthodox Greeks? While among the Egyptians and  all who confess the saving doctrine of Eutyches, among the Monophysites  we are the chief, and we will remain so, and close our ears and hearts  against all heretics and their superstitions. What! A grandson of  Menas, the brother of two martyrs for our glorious faith, married to  a Melchite! The mere idea is sacrilege, is blasphemy; I can give it no  milder name! I and your father will die childless before we consent! And  it is for the love of this woman, whose heart is so cold that I shiver  only to think of it--for this waif and stray, who has nothing but her  ragged pride and the mere scrapings of a lost fortune, which never could  compare with ours--for this thankless creature, who can hardly bring  herself to bid me, your mother, such a civil good-morning--by Heaven it  is the truth--as I can say to a slave--for her that I, that your parents  are to be bereft of their son, the only child that a gracious Providence  has left to be their joy and comfort? No, no, never! Far be it from me!  You, Orion, my heart's darling, you have been a wilful fellow all your  life, but you cannot have such a perverse heart as to bring your old  mother, who has kept you in her heart these four and twenty years, in  sorrow to the grave and embitter your father's few remaining days--for  his hours are numbered!--And all for the sake of this cold beauty, whom  you have seen for a few hours these last two days. You cannot have  the heart to do this, my heart's treasure, no, you cannot!--But if  you should in some"]]]
