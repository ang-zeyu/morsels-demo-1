She had round red arms, a dress of some sober woollen  stuff, and a brass brooch the size of a cheese-cake stuck in the front  of it.    \"Peter the fuller!\" she kept repeating. \"Marry come up! if I were Peter  the fuller's wife I would teach him better than to give his clothes to  the first knave who asks for them. But he was always a poor, fond, silly  creature, was Peter, though we are beholden to him for helping to bury  our second son Wat, who was a 'prentice to him at Lymington in the year  of the Black Death. But who are you, young sir?\"    \"I am a clerk on my road from Beaulieu to Minstead.\"    \"Aye, indeed! Hast been brought up at the Abbey then. I could read it  from thy reddened cheek and downcast eye. Hast learned from the monks, I  trow, to fear a woman as thou wouldst a lazar-house. Out upon them! that  they should dishonor their own mothers by such teaching. A pretty world  it would be with all the women out of it.\"    \"Heaven forfend that such a thing should come to pass!\" said Alleyne.    \"Amen and amen! But thou art a pretty lad, and the prettier for thy  modest ways. It is easy to see from thy cheek that thou hast not spent  thy days in the rain and the heat and the wind, as my poor Wat hath been  forced to do.\"    \"I have indeed seen little of life, good dame.\"    \"Wilt find nothing in it to pay for the loss of thy own freshness. Here  are the clothes, and Peter can leave them when next he comes this way.  Holy Virgin! see the dust upon thy doublet! It were easy to see that  there is no woman to tend to thee. So!--that is better. Now buss me,  boy.\"    Alleyne stooped and kissed her, for the kiss was the common salutation  of the age, and, as Erasmus long afterwards remarked, more used in  England than in any other country. Yet it sent the blood to his temples  again, and he wondered, as he turned away, what the Abbot Berghersh  would have answered to so frank an invitation. He was still tingling  from this new experience when he came out upon the high-road and saw a  sight which drove all other thoughts from his mind.    Some way down from where he had left him the unfortunate Peter was  stamping and raving tenfold worse than before. Now, however, instead of  the great white cloak, he had no clothes on at all, save a short woollen  shirt and a pair of leather shoes. Far down the road a long-legged  figure was running, with a bundle under one arm and the other hand to  his side, like a man who laughs until he is sore.    \"See him!\" yelled Peter. \"Look to him! You shall be my witness. He shall  see Winchester jail for this. See where he goes with my cloak under his  arm!\"    \"Who then?\" cried Alleyne.    \"Who but that cursed brother John. He hath not left me clothes enough to  make a gallybagger. The double thief hath cozened me out of my gown.\"    \"Stay though, my friend, it was his gown,\" objected Alleyne.    \"It boots not. He hath them all--gown, jerkin, hosen and all. Gramercy  to him that he left me the shirt and the shoon. I doubt not that he will  be back for them anon.\"    \"But how came this?\" asked Alleyne, open-eyed with astonishment.    \"Are those the clothes? For dear charity's sake give them to me. Not the  Pope himself shall have these from me, though he sent the whole college  of cardinals to ask it. How came it? Why, you had scarce gone ere this  loathly John came running back again, and, when I oped mouth to reproach  him, he asked me whether it was indeed likely that a man of prayer would  leave his own godly raiment in order to take a layman's jerkin. He  had, he said, but gone for a while that I might be the freer for my  devotions. On this I plucked off the gown, and he with much show of  haste did begin to undo his points; but when I threw his frock down  he clipped it up and ran off all untrussed, leaving me in this sorry  plight. He laughed so the while, like a great croaking frog, that I  might have caught him had my breath not been as short as his legs were  long.\"    The young man listened to this tale of wrong with all the seriousness  that he could maintain; but at the sight of the pursy red-faced man and  the dignity with which he bore him, the laughter came so thick upon him  that he had to lean up against a tree-trunk. The fuller looked sadly and  gravely at him; but finding that he still laughed, he bowed with much  mock politeness and stalked onwards in his borrowed clothes. Alleyne  watched him until he was small in the distance, and then, wiping the  tears from his eyes, he set off briskly once more upon his journey.        CHAPTER IV. HOW THE BAILIFF OF SOUTHAMPTON SLEW THE TWO MASTERLESS MEN.      The road along which he travelled was scarce as populous as most other  roads in the kingdom, and far less so than those which lie between the  larger towns. Yet from time to time Alleyne met other wayfarers, and  more than once was overtaken by strings of pack mules and horsemen  journeying in the same direction as himself. Once a begging friar came  limping along in a brown habit, imploring in a most dolorous voice to  give him a single groat to buy bread wherewith to save himself from  impending death. Alleyne passed him swiftly by, for he had learned from  the monks to have no love for the wandering friars, and, besides, there  was a great half-gnawed mutton bone sticking out of his pouch to prove  him a liar. Swiftly as he went, however, he could not escape the curse  of the four blessed evangelists which the mendicant howled behind him.  So dreadful are his execrations that the frightened lad thrust his  fingers into his ear-holes, and ran until the fellow was but a brown  smirch upon the yellow road.    Further on, at the edge of the woodland, he came upon a chapman and his  wife, who sat upon a fallen tree. He had put his pack down as a table,  and the two of them were devouring a great pasty, and washing it down  with some drink from a stone jar. The chapman broke a rough jest as he  passed, and the woman called shrilly to Alleyne to come and join them,  on which the man, turning suddenly from mirth to wrath, began to belabor  her with his cudgel. Alleyne hastened on, lest he make more mischief,  and his heart was heavy as lead within him. Look where he would, he  seemed to see nothing but injustice and violence and the hardness of man  to man.    But even as he brooded sadly over it and pined for the sweet peace of  the Abbey, he came on an open space dotted with holly bushes, where was  the strangest sight that he had yet chanced upon. Near to the pathway  lay a long clump of greenery, and from behind this there stuck straight  up into the air four human legs clad in parti-colored hosen, yellow and  black. Strangest of all was when a brisk tune struck suddenly up and  the four legs began to kick and twitter in time to the music. Walking on  tiptoe round the bushes, he stood in amazement to see two men bounding  about on their heads, while they played, the one a viol and the other  a pipe, as merrily and as truly as though they were seated in a choir.  Alleyne crossed himself as he gazed at this unnatural sight, and  could scarce hold his ground with a steady face, when the two dancers,  catching sight of him, came bouncing in his direction. A spear's length  from him, they each threw a somersault into the air, and came down upon  their feet with smirking faces and their hands over their hearts.    \"A guerdon--a guerdon, my knight of the staring eyes!\" cried one.    \"A gift, my prince!\" shouted the other. \"Any trifle will serve--a purse  of gold, or even a jewelled goblet.\"    Alleyne thought of what he had read of demoniac possession--the  jumpings, the twitchings, the wild talk. It was in his mind to repeat  over the exorcism proper to such attacks; but the two burst out  a-laughing at his scared face, and turning on to their heads once more,  clapped their heels in derision.    \"Hast never seen tumblers before?\" asked the elder, a black-browed,  swarthy man, as brown and supple as a hazel twig. \"Why shrink from us,  then, as though we were the spawn of the Evil One?\"    \"Why shrink, my honey-bird? Why so afeard, my sweet cinnamon?\" exclaimed  the other, a loose-jointed lanky youth with a dancing, roguish eye.    \"Truly, sirs, it is a new sight to me,\" the clerk answered. \"When I saw  your four legs above the bush I could scarce credit my own eyes. Why is  it that you do this thing?\"    \"A dry question to answer,\" cried the younger, coming back on to  his feet. \"A most husky question, my fair bird! But how? A flask, a  flask!--by all that is wonderful!\" He shot out his hand as he spoke, and  plucking Alleyne's bottle out of his scrip, he deftly knocked the neck  off, and poured the half of it down his throat. The rest he handed to  his comrade, who drank the wine, and then, to the clerk's increasing  amazement, made a show of swallowing the bottle, with such skill  that Alleyne seemed to see it vanish down his throat. A moment later,  however, he flung it over his head, and caught it bottom downwards upon  the calf of his left leg.    \"We thank you for the wine, kind sir,\" said he, \"and for the ready  courtesy wherewith you offered it. Touching your question, we may tell  you that we are strollers and jugglers, who, having performed with much  applause at Winchester fair, are now on our way to the great Michaelmas  market at Ringwood. As our art is a very fine and delicate one, however,  we cannot let a day go by without exercising ourselves in it, to which  end we choose some quiet and sheltered spot where we may break our  journey. Here you find us; and we cannot wonder that you, who are new to  tumbling, should be astounded, since many great barons, earls, marshals  and knights, who have wandered as far as the Holy Land, are of one  mind in saying that they have never seen a more noble or gracious  performance. If you will be pleased to sit upon that stump, we will now  continue our exercise.\"    Alleyne sat down willingly as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9069"],[0,"Saint Augustin (#5)"],[1,"marabouts. Just as in the time of St. Monnica, they sit around the  tombs, so cool with their casing of painted tiles, in the shade of the  cypress and eucalyptus. They gobble sweetmeats, they gossip, they laugh,  they enjoy themselves--the husbands are not there.    Monnica made these visits in a really pious state of mind, and was far  from trying to find in them opportunities for lewdness or carouse. She was  content to drink a little wine very carefully--she always bore in mind her  youthful sin. Besides, this wine weakened with water that she brought from  the house, was tepid by the time she reached the cemetery; it would be a  drink of very moderate relish, little likely to stimulate the senses. She  distributed what was left of it among the needy, together with the contents  of her basket, and came back modestly to her house.    But however staid and reserved she might be, still these outings gave rise  to scandalous talk. They annoyed a suspicious husband. All the Africans are  that. Marital jealousy was not invented by Islam. Moreover, in Monnica's  time men and women took part in these funeral love-feasts and mingled  together disturbingly. Patricius got cross about it, and about a good many  other things too. His old mother chafed his suspicions by carrying to  him the ugly gossip and even the lies of the servants about his wife. By  dint of patience and mildness and attentions, Monnica ended by disarming  her mother-in-law and making it clear that her conduct was perfect. The  old woman flew into a rage with the servants who had lied to her, and  denounced them to her son. Patricius, like a good head of a household, had  them whipped to teach them not to lie any more. Thanks to this exemplary  punishment, and the good sense of the young wife, peace reigned once more  in the family.    Women, friends of Monnica, were amazed that the good understanding was  not oftener upset, at least in an open manner, between husband and wife.  Everybody in Thagaste knew the quick-tempered and violent character of  Patricius. And yet there were no signs that he beat his wife. Nor did  any one say he did. Other women who had less passionate husbands were  nevertheless beaten by them. When they came to Monnica's house they shewed  her the marks of the whacks they had got, their faces swollen from blows,  and they burst out in abuse of men, clamouring against their lechery,  which, said these matrons, was the cause of the ill-treatment they had to  endure.    \"Blame your own tongue,\" retorted Monnica.    According to her, women should close their eyes to the infidelities of  their husbands and avoid arguing with them when they were angry. Silence,  submissiveness, were the all-powerful arms. And since, as a young woman,  she had a certain natural merriment, she added, laughing:    \"Remember what was read to you on your wedding-day. You were told that you  are the handmaids of your husbands. Don't rebel against your masters!...\"    Possibly this was a keen criticism of the pagan code, so hard in its rules.  Still, in this matter, the Roman law was in agreement with the Gospel.  Sincere Christian as she was, the wife of Patricius never had any quarrel  with him on account of his infidelities. So much kindness and resignation  touched the dissolute and brutal husband, who besides was an excellent  man and warm-hearted. The modesty of his wife, after a while, made her  attractive in his eyes. He loved her, so to speak, on the strength of  his respect and admiration for her. He would indeed have been a churl to  find fault with a wife who interfered with him so little and who was a  perfect housekeeper, as we shall see later on when we come to her life at  Cassicium. In one point, where even she did not intend it, she forwarded  the interests of her husband by gaining him the good-will of the Christians  in Thagaste; while he, on his side, could say to the pagans who looked  askance at his marriage: \"Am I not one of yourselves?\"    In spite of all the differences between him and Monnica, Patricius was a  contented husband.          III    THE COMFORT OF THE MILK      Augustin came into this world the thirteenth of November of the year of  Christ 354.    It was just one little child more in this sensual and pleasure-loving  Africa, land of sin and of carnal productiveness, where children are  born and die like the leaves. But the son of Monnica and Patricius was  predestined: he was not to die in the cradle like so many other tiny  Africans.    Even if he had not been intended for great things, if he had been only a  head in the crowd, the arrival of this baby ought, all the same, to affect  us, for to the Christian, the destiny of the obscurest and humblest of  souls is a matter of importance. Forty years afterwards, Augustin, in his  _Confessions_, pondered this slight ordinary fact of his birth, which  happened almost unnoticed by the inhabitants of Thagaste, and in truth it  seems to him a great event, not because it concerns himself, bishop and  Father of the Church, but because it is a soul which at this imperceptible  point of time comes into the world.    Let us clearly understand Augustin's thought. Souls have been ransomed by a  Victim of infinite value. They have themselves an infinite value. Nothing  which goes on in them can be ignored. Their most trifling sins, their  feeblest stirrings towards virtue, are vital for the eternity of their lot.  All shall be attributed to them by the just Judge. The theft of an apple  will weigh perhaps as heavily in the scales as the seizure of a province  or a kingdom. The evil of sin is in the evil intention. Now the fate  of a soul, created by God, on Him depends. Hence everything in a human  life assumes an extreme seriousness and importance. In the history of a  creature, all is worthy of being examined, weighed, studied, and perhaps  also, for the edification of others, told.    Here is an altogether new way of regarding life, and, proceeding from that,  of understanding art. Even as the slaves, thanks to Christianity, came into  the spiritual city, so the most minute realities by this outlook are to be  included in literature. The _Confessions_ will be the first model of the  art of the new era. A deep and magnificent realism, because it goes even  to the very depths of the divine--utterly distinct, at any rate, from  our surface realism of mere amusement--is about to arise from this new  conception. Without doubt, in Augustin's eyes, beauty dwells in all things,  in so far forth as beauty is a reflection of the order and the thought  of the Word. But it has also a more essential character--it has a moral  signification and value. Everything, in a word, can be the instrument of  the loss or the redemption of a soul. The most insignificant of our actions  reverberates to infinitude on our fate. Regarded from this point, both  things and beings commence to live a life more closely leagued together and  at the same time more private; more individual and more general. All is in  the lump, and nevertheless all is separate. Our salvation concerns only  ourselves, and yet through charity it becomes involved with the salvation  of our fellows.    In this spirit let us look at the cradle of Augustin. Let us look at it  with the eyes of Augustin himself, and also, perchance, of Monnica. Bending  over the frail body of the little child he once was, he puts to himself  all the great desperate questions which have shaken humanity for thousands  of years. The mystery of life and death rises before him, formidable. It  tortures him to the point of anguish, of confusion: \"Yet suffer me to speak  before Thy mercy, me who am but dust and ashes. Yea, suffer me to speak,  for, behold, I speak not to man who scorns me, but to Thy mercy. Even Thou  perhaps dost scorn me, but Thou wilt turn and have pity. For what is it  that I would say, O Lord my God, save that I know not whence I came hither  into this dying life, shall I call it, or living death?... And, lo, my  infancy has long been dead, and I live. But Thou, O Lord, who ever livest  and in whom nothing ever dies--tell me, I beseech Thee, O God, and have  mercy on my misery, tell me whether another life of mine died before my  infancy began.\"    One is reminded here of Pascal's famous prosopopoeia: \"I know not who  has put me into the world, nor what the world is, nor myself. I am in a  terrible ignorance about everything.... All I know is that I must soon die,  but what I know least of all is this very death which I cannot escape.\"    The phrases of the _Pensees_ are only the echo of the phrases of the  _Confessions_. But how different is the tone! Pascal's charge against human  ignorance is merciless. The God of Port-Royal has the hard and motionless  face of the ancient Destiny: He withdraws into the clouds, and only shews  Himself at the end to raise up His poor creature. In Augustin the accent  is tender, trusting, really like a son, and though he be harassed, one can  discern the thrill of an unconquerable hope. Instead of crushing man under  the iron hand of the Justice-dealer, he makes him feel the kindness of the  Father who has got all ready, long before its birth, for the feeble little  child: \"The comforts of Thy pity received me, as I have heard from the  father and mother of my flesh.... And so the comfort of woman's milk was  ready for me. For my mother and my nurses did not fill their own bosoms,  but Thou, O Lord, by their means gavest me the food of infancy, according  to Thy ordinance....\"    And see! his heart overflows at this remembrance of his mother's milk. The  great doctor humbles his style, makes it simple and familiar, to tell us of  his first mewlings, and of his baby angers and joys. He too was a father;  he knew what is a new-born child, and a young mother who gives it suck,  because he had seen that with his own eyes close beside him. All the small  bothers which mingle with the pleasures of"]]]
