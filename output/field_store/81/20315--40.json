Economic considerations have played second fiddle to   political and military upheavals during more than 15 years of war,   including the nearly 10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended   15 February 1989). Over the past decade, one-third of the population   fled the country, with Pakistan sheltering more than 3 million   refugees and Iran about 3 million. About 1.4 million Afghan refugees   remain in Pakistan and about 2 million in Iran. Another 1 million   probably moved into and around urban areas within Afghanistan.

I am very far from desiring to be thought a superior judge of  this animal, but I will be bold to say, that according to these  principles of length and power, there never was a Horse (at least  that I have seen) so well entitled to get racers as the Godolphin  Arabian; for whoever has seen this Horse, must remember that his  shoulders were deeper, and lay farther into his back, than any  Horse's ever yet seen; behind the shoulders, there was but a very  small space; before, the muscles of his loins rose excessively  high, broad, and expanded, which were inserted into his quarters  with greater strength and power than in any Horse I believe ever  yet seen of his dimensions. If we now consider the plainness of  his head and ears, the position of his fore-legs, and his stinted  growth, occasioned by the want of food in the country where he was  bred, it is not to be wondered at, that the excellence of this  Horse's shape, which we see only in miniature, and therefore  imperfectly, was not so manifest and apparent to the perception of  some men as of others.    It has been said, that the sons of the Godolphin Arabian had  better wind than other Horses, and that this perfection of the  wind was in the blood. But when we consider any Horse thus  mechanically made, whose leavers acquire more purchase, and whose  powers are stronger than his adversaries, such a Horse will be  enabled by this superiority of mechanism, to act with greater  facility, and therefore it is no wonder that the organs of  respiration (if not confined or straitened more than his  adversaries) should be less fatigued. Suppose now, we take ten  mares of the same, or different blood, all which is held equally  good, when the Mares are covered, and have been esteemed so long  before, and put to this Godolphin Arabian, let us suppose some of  the colts to be good racers, and others very inferior to them;  shall we condemn the blood of these mares which produced the  inferior Horses? If so, we shall never know what good blood is, or  where it is to be found, or ever act with any certainty in the  propagation of this species, and it is this ridiculous opinion  alone of blood, that deceives mankind so much in the breed of  racers. If we ask the jockey the cause of this difference in the  performance of these brothers, he (willing to account some how for  it) readily answers, that the blood did not nick; but will a wise  and reasoning man, who seriously endeavours to account for this  difference, be content with such a vague, unmeaning answer, when,  by applying his attention to matters of fact, and his observation  to the different mechanism of these brothers, the difference of  their performance is not only rationally, but demonstratively  accounted for?    But if this excellence of the racer should really be in the blood,  or what is called the proper nicking of it, I must say, it is a  matter of great wonder to me, that the blood of the Godolphin  Arabian, who was a confined Stallion, and had but few Mares,  should nick so well as to produce so many excellent racers; and  that the blood of his son Cade, who has had such a number of  Mares, and those, perhaps, the very best in the kingdom, should  not nick any better than it seems to have done; for I do not  conceive the performances of the sons of Cade to have been equal  in any respect to the sons of the Godolphin Arabian; though I do  not pretend to determine this myself, but shall leave it to the  opinion of mankind.    The question then is, whether this excellence of Horses is in the  blood or the mechanism; whoever is for blood, let him take two  brothers of any sort or kind, and breed one up in plenty, the  other upon a barren heath; I fancy he will find, that a different  mechanism of the body will be acquired to the two brothers by the  difference of their living, and that the blood of him brought up  on the barren heath, will not be able to contend with the  mechanism of the other, brought up in a land of plenty. Now if  this difference of shape will make a difference in the performance  of the animal, it will be just the same thing in its consequences,  whether this imperfection of shape be produced by scarcity of  foot, or entailed by the laws of nature; if so, does it signify  whether the colt be got by Turk, Barb, or what kind of blood his  dam be of? or where shall we find one certain proof of the  efficacy of blood in any Horse produced in any age or any country,  independent of the laws of mechanics.    If it should be urged, that these foreign Horses get better colts  than their descendants, that therefore the blood of foreign ones  is best, I answer, no; for that according to the number of foreign  Stallions we have had in this kingdom, there have been more  reputed and really bad than good ones, which would not happen in  the case of Horses, who come from the same country, and are of the  same extraction, if this goodness was in the blood only. But the  true reason why foreign Horses get better colts than their  descendants, if they do get better, is that (mechanism alike)  their descendants from which we breed, are generally such Horses  as have been thoroughly tried, consequently much strained, and  gone through strong labour and fatigue; whereas the foreign Horse  has perhaps seldom or never known what labour was; for we find the  Turk a sober grave person, always riding a foot pace, except on  emergencies, and the Arab preferring his Mare to his Horse for use  and service. As a proof of this truth, let us take two sister  hound bitches, and ward them both with the same dog; let us  suppose one bitch to have run in the pack, and the other by some  accident not to have worked at all, it will be found that the  offspring of her who has never worked, will be much superior to  the offspring of her who has run in the pack.    All I have now to ask of my brother jockeys is, that for the  future, when speaking of these Horses, they will, instead of the  phrase HIGH-BRED, say only well-bred, and that they will not even  then be understood to mean any thing more by it, than that they  are descended from a race of Horses, whose actions have  established their goodness: and that I may have leave to prefer my  opinion of the mechanical powers of a Horse, to all their opinions  concerning blood, which is in reality no more than a vain chimera.  If these things are so, have not we and our fore-fathers been  hoodwinked all our days by the prevalence of a ridiculous custom,  and the mistaken system, when by consulting our own reason and  understanding, this mist of error had fled before it? If this  mechanical power was considered as it ought to be, it would excite  a proper emulation amongst all breeders: and when the excellence  in the breed of Horses was found to be the effect of judgment, and  not of chance, there would be more merit as well as more pleasure  in having bred a superior Horse. Add to this, mankind by applying  their attention to this mechanism of animals, would improve their  judgment in the laws of nature, and it would not only produce a  much better breed of racers than any we have yet seen, but the  good of it would extend to all sorts of Horses throughout the  kingdom of what kind soever. It is a cruel thing to say, but yet a  very true one, that amongst the present breed of Horses in this  nation, a man of any tolerable judgment can hardly find one in  fifty fit for his purpose, whether designed to draw or ride;  whereas if the purchasers would endeavour to make themselves  masters of this mechanism, the breeders of every kind of Horses  must consult it also, or keep their useless ones in their own  hands, which I conceive would be a proper punishment for their  ignorance.    And now the author appeals not to the illiterate and unlearned  (whose obstinacy is too great to receive instruction, and whose  prejudices are too strong to be obliterated by any reasons) but to  the candid and impartial inquiry of reasoning and unprejudiced men  into these principles, and hopes this may be a means of exciting  some more able pen, to vindicate a truth so many ages buried in  darkness. If aught conducive to the pleasure or use of mankind  shall accrue from these hints, he will think himself happy; on the  other hand, if the principles here advanced should prove  erroneous, and any man be kind enough to point out the fallacy of  them, he will kiss the rod with chearfulness** and submission.
