The incidents which the 'enclosed photograph' recalled were productive of  a severe shock to Mrs Anstruther. It was decided that she must spend the  winter abroad.    Mr Anstruther, when he went down to Westfield to make the necessary  arrangements, not unnaturally told this story to the rector (an old  gentleman), who showed little surprise.    'Really I had managed to piece out for myself very much what must have  happened, partly from old people's talk and partly from what I saw in  your grounds. Of course we have suffered to some extent also. Yes, it was  bad at first: like owls, as you say, and men talking sometimes. One night  it was in this garden, and at other times about several of the cottages.  But lately there has been very little: I think it will die out. There is  nothing in our registers except the entry of the burial, and what I for a  long time took to be the family motto: but last time I looked at it I  noticed that it was added in a later hand and had the initials of one of  our rectors quite late in the seventeenth century, A. C.--Augustine  Crompton. Here it is, you see--_quieta non movere_. I suppose-- Well, it  is rather hard to say exactly what I do suppose.'          THE TRACTATE MIDDOTH    Towards the end of an autumn afternoon an elderly man with a thin face  and grey Piccadilly weepers pushed open the swing-door leading into the  vestibule of a certain famous library, and addressing himself to an  attendant, stated that he believed he was entitled to use the library,  and inquired if he might take a book out. Yes, if he were on the list of  those to whom that privilege was given. He produced his card--Mr John  Eldred--and, the register being consulted, a favourable answer was given.  'Now, another point,' said he. 'It is a long time since I was here, and I  do not know my way about your building; besides, it is near closing-time,  and it is bad for me to hurry up and down stairs. I have here the title  of the book I want: is there anyone at liberty who could go and find it  for me?' After a moment's thought the doorkeeper beckoned to a young man  who was passing. 'Mr Garrett,' he said, 'have you a minute to assist this  gentleman?' 'With pleasure,' was Mr Garrett's answer. The slip with the  title was handed to him. 'I think I can put my hand on this; it happens  to be in the class I inspected last quarter, but I'll just look it up in  the catalogue to make sure. I suppose it is that particular edition that  you require, sir?' 'Yes, if you please; that, and no other,' said Mr  Eldred; 'I am exceedingly obliged to you.' 'Don't mention it I beg, sir,'  said Mr Garrett, and hurried off.    'I thought so,' he said to himself, when his finger, travelling down the  pages of the catalogue, stopped at a particular entry. 'Talmud: Tractate  Middoth, with the commentary of Nachmanides, Amsterdam, 1707. 11.3.34.  Hebrew class, of course. Not a very difficult job this.'    Mr Eldred, accommodated with a chair in the vestibule, awaited anxiously  the return of his messenger--and his disappointment at seeing an  empty-handed Mr Garrett running down the staircase was very evident. 'I'm  sorry to disappoint you, sir,' said the young man, 'but the book is out.'  'Oh dear!' said Mr Eldred, 'is that so? You are sure there can be no  mistake?' 'I don't think there is much chance of it, sir: but it's  possible, if you like to wait a minute, that you might meet the very  gentleman that's got it. He must be leaving the library soon, and I  _think_ I saw him take that particular book out of the shelf.' 'Indeed!  You didn't recognize him, I suppose? Would it be one of the professors or  one of the students?' 'I don't think so: certainly not a professor. I  should have known him; but the light isn't very good in that part of the  library at this time of day, and I didn't see his face. I should have  said he was a shortish old gentleman, perhaps a clergyman, in a cloak. If  you could wait, I can easily find out whether he wants the book very  particularly.'    'No, no,' said Mr Eldred, 'I won't--I can't wait now, thank you--no. I  must be off. But I'll call again to-morrow if I may, and perhaps you  could find out who has it.'    'Certainly, sir, and I'll have the book ready for you if we--' But Mr  Eldred was already off, and hurrying more than one would have thought  wholesome for him.    Garrett had a few moments to spare; and, thought he, 'I'll go back to  that case and see if I can find the old man. Most likely he could put off  using the book for a few days. I dare say the other one doesn't want to  keep it for long.' So off with him to the Hebrew class. But when he got  there it was unoccupied, and the volume marked 11.3.34 was in its place  on the shelf. It was vexatious to Garrett's self-respect to have  disappointed an inquirer with so little reason: and he would have liked,  had it not been against library rules, to take the book down to the  vestibule then and there, so that it might be ready for Mr Eldred when he  called. However, next morning he would be on the look out for him, and he  begged the doorkeeper to send and let him know when the moment came. As a  matter of fact, he was himself in the vestibule when Mr Eldred arrived,  very soon after the library opened, and when hardly anyone besides the  staff were in the building.    'I'm very sorry,' he said; 'it's not often that I make such a stupid  mistake, but I did feel sure that the old gentleman I saw took out that  very book and kept it in his hand without opening it, just as people do,  you know, sir, when they mean to take a book out of the library and not  merely refer to it. But, however, I'll run up now at once and get it for  you this time.'    And here intervened a pause. Mr Eldred paced the entry, read all the  notices, consulted his watch, sat and gazed up the staircase, did all  that a very impatient man could, until some twenty minutes had run out.  At last he addressed himself to the doorkeeper and inquired if it was a  very long way to that part of the library to which Mr Garrett had gone.    'Well, I was thinking it was funny, sir: he's a quick man as a rule, but  to be sure he might have been sent for by the libarian, but even so I  think he'd have mentioned to him that you was waiting. I'll just speak  him up on the toob and see.' And to the tube he addressed himself. As he  absorbed the reply to his question his face changed, and he made one or  two supplementary inquiries which were shortly answered. Then he came  forward to his counter and spoke in a lower tone. 'I'm sorry to hear,  sir, that something seems to have 'appened a little awkward. Mr Garrett  has been took poorly, it appears, and the libarian sent him 'ome in a  cab the other way. Something of an attack, by what I can hear.' 'What,  really? Do you mean that someone has injured him?' 'No, sir, not violence  'ere, but, as I should judge, attacted with an attack, what you might  term it, of illness. Not a strong constitootion, Mr Garrett. But as to  your book, sir, perhaps you might be able to find it for yourself. It's  too bad you should be disappointed this way twice over--' 'Er--well, but  I'm so sorry that Mr Garrett should have been taken ill in this way while  he was obliging me. I think I must leave the book, and call and inquire  after him. You can give me his address, I suppose.' That was easily done:  Mr Garrett, it appeared, lodged in rooms not far from the station. 'And,  one other question. Did you happen to notice if an old gentleman, perhaps  a clergyman, in a--yes--in a black cloak, left the library after I did  yesterday. I think he may have been a--I think, that is, that he may be  staying--or rather that I may have known him.'    'Not in a black cloak, sir; no. There were only two gentlemen left later  than what you done, sir, both of them youngish men. There was Mr Carter  took out a music-book and one of the prefessors with a couple o' novels.  That's the lot, sir; and then I went off to me tea, and glad to get it.  Thank you, sir, much obliged.'           *       *       *       *       *    Mr Eldred, still a prey to anxiety, betook himself in a cab to Mr  Garrett's address, but the young man was not yet in a condition to  receive visitors. He was better, but his landlady considered that he must  have had a severe shock. She thought most likely from what the doctor  said that he would be able to see Mr Eldred to-morrow. Mr Eldred returned  to his hotel at dusk and spent, I fear, but a dull evening.    On the next day he was able to see Mr Garrett. When in health Mr Garrett  was a cheerful and pleasant-looking young man. Now he was a very white  and shaky being, propped up in an arm-chair by the fire, and inclined to  shiver and keep an eye on the door. If however, there were visitors whom  he was not prepared to welcome, Mr Eldred was not among them. 'It really  is I who owe you an apology, and I was despairing of being able to pay  it, for I didn't know your address. But I am very glad you have called. I  do dislike and regret giving all this trouble, but you know I could not  have foreseen this--this attack which I had.'    'Of course not; but now, I am something of a doctor. You'll excuse my  asking; you have had, I am sure, good advice. Was it a fall you had?'    'No. I did fall on the floor--but not from any height. It was, really, a  shock.'    'You mean something startled you. Was it anything you thought you saw?'    'Not much _thinking_ in the case, I'm afraid. Yes, it was something I  saw. You remember when you called the first time at the library?'    'Yes, of course. Well, now, let me beg you not to try to describe it--it  will not be good for you to recall it, I'm sure.'    'But indeed it would be a relief to me to tell anyone like yourself: you  might be able to explain it away. It was just when I was going into the  class where your book is--"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/964"],[0,"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (#5)"],[1,"  age nigh the same; and he hath blue eyes, too.\"    \"Nay,\" quoth the Tinker, \"thou art but a green youth. I thought him to  be a great bearded man. Nottingham men feared him so.\"    \"Truly, he is not so old nor so stout as thou art,\" said Robin. \"But men  do call him a right deft hand at quarterstaff.\"    \"That may be,\" said the Tinker right sturdily, \"but I am more deft than  he, for did I not overcome Simon of Ely in a fair bout in the ring at  Hertford Town? But if thou knowest him, my jolly blade, wilt thou go  with me and bring me to him? Fourscore bright angels hath the Sheriff  promised me if I serve the warrant upon the knave's body, and ten of  them will I give to thee if thou showest me him.\"    \"Ay, that will I,\" quoth Robin, \"but show me thy warrant, man, until I  see whether it be good or no.\"    \"That will I not do, even to mine own brother,\" answered the Tinker. \"No  man shall see my warrant till I serve it upon yon fellow's own body.\"    \"So be it,\" quoth Robin. \"And thou show it not to me I know not to whom  thou wilt show it. But here we are at the Sign of the Blue Boar, so let  us in and taste his brown October.\"    No sweeter inn could be found in all Nottinghamshire than that of the  Blue Boar. None had such lovely trees standing around, or was so covered  with trailing clematis and sweet woodbine; none had such good beer and  such humming ale; nor, in wintertime, when the north wind howled and  snow drifted around the hedges, was there to be found, elsewhere, such  a roaring fire as blazed upon the hearth of the Blue Boar. At such times  might be found a goodly company of yeomen or country folk seated around  the blazing hearth, bandying merry jests, while roasted crabs(2) bobbed  in bowls of ale upon the hearthstone. Well known was the inn to Robin  Hood and his band, for there had he and such merry companions as Little  John or Will Stutely or young David of Doncaster often gathered when all  the forest was filled with snow. As for mine host, he knew how to keep  a still tongue in his head, and to swallow his words before they passed  his teeth, for he knew very well which side of his bread was spread with  butter, for Robin and his band were the best of customers and paid their  scores without having them chalked up behind the door. So now, when  Robin Hood and the Tinker came thereto and called aloud for two great  pots of ale, none would have known from look or speech that the host had  ever set eyes upon the outlaw before.         (2) Small sour apples.    \"Bide thou here,\" quoth Robin to the Tinker, \"while I go and see that  mine host draweth ale from the right butt, for he hath good October, I  know, and that brewed by Withold of Tamworth.\" So saying, he went within  and whispered to the host to add a measure of Flemish strong waters to  the good English ale; which the latter did and brought it to them.    \"By Our Lady,\" said the Tinker, after a long draught of the ale, \"yon  same Withold of Tamworth--a right good Saxon name, too, I would have  thee know--breweth the most humming ale that e'er passed the lips of Wat  o' the Crabstaff.\"    \"Drink, man, drink,\" cried Robin, only wetting his own lips meanwhile.  \"Ho, landlord! Bring my friend another pot of the same. And now for a  song, my jolly blade.\"    \"Ay, that will I give thee a song, my lovely fellow,\" quoth the Tinker,  \"for I never tasted such ale in all my days before. By Our Lady, it  doth make my head hum even now! Hey, Dame Hostess, come listen, an thou  wouldst hear a song, and thou too, thou bonny lass, for never sing I so  well as when bright eyes do look upon me the while.\"    Then he sang an ancient ballad of the time of good King Arthur, called  \"The Marriage of Sir Gawaine,\" which you may some time read yourself, in  stout English of early times; and as he sang, all listened to that noble  tale of noble knight and his sacrifice to his king. But long before the  Tinker came to the last verse his tongue began to trip and his head to  spin, because of the strong waters mixed with the ale. First his tongue  tripped, then it grew thick of sound; then his head wagged from side to  side, until at last he fell asleep as though he never would waken again.    Then Robin Hood laughed aloud and quickly took the warrant from out the  Tinker's pouch with his deft fingers. \"Sly art thou, Tinker,\" quoth he,  \"but not yet, I bow, art thou as sly as that same sly thief Robin Hood.\"    Then he called the host to him and said, \"Here, good man, are ten broad  shillings for the entertainment thou hast given us this day. See that  thou takest good care of thy fair guest there, and when he wakes thou  mayst again charge him ten shillings also, and if he hath it not, thou  mayst take his bag and hammer, and even his coat, in payment. Thus do  I punish those that come into the greenwood to deal dole to me. As for  thine own self, never knew I landlord yet that would not charge twice an  he could.\"    At this the host smiled slyly, as though saying to himself the rustic  saw, \"Teach a magpie to suck eggs.\"    The Tinker slept until the afternoon drew to a close and the shadows  grew long beside the woodland edge, then he awoke. First he looked up,  then he looked down, then he looked east, then he looked west, for he  was gathering his wits together, like barley straws blown apart by the  wind. First he thought of his merry companion, but he was gone. Then he  thought of his stout crabstaff, and that he had within his hand. Then of  his warrant, and of the fourscore angels he was to gain for serving it  upon Robin Hood. He thrust his hand into his pouch, but not a scrap nor  a farthing was there. Then he sprang to his feet in a rage.    \"Ho, landlord!\" cried he, \"whither hath that knave gone that was with me  but now?\"    \"What knave meaneth Your Worship?\" quoth the landlord, calling the  Tinker Worship to soothe him, as a man would pour oil upon angry water.  \"I saw no knave with Your Worship, for I swear no man would dare call  that man knave so nigh to Sherwood Forest. A right stout yeoman I saw  with Your Worship, but I thought that Your Worship knew him, for few  there be about here that pass him by and know him not.\"    \"Now, how should I, that ne'er have squealed in your sty, know all the  swine therein? Who was he, then, an thou knowest him so well?\"    \"Why, yon same is a right stout fellow whom men hereabouts do call Robin  Hood, which same--\"    \"Now, by'r Lady!\" cried the Tinker hastily, and in a deep voice like an  angry bull, \"thou didst see me come into thine inn, I, a staunch, honest  craftsman, and never told me who my company was, well knowing thine own  self who he was. Now, I have a right round piece of a mind to crack thy  knave's pate for thee!\" Then he took up his cudgel and looked at the  landlord as though he would smite him where he stood.    \"Nay,\" cried the host, throwing up his elbow, for he feared the blow,  \"how knew I that thou knewest him not?\"    \"Well and truly thankful mayst thou be,\" quoth the Tinker, \"that I be  a patient man and so do spare thy bald crown, else wouldst thou ne'er  cheat customer again. But as for this same knave Robin Hood, I go  straightway to seek him, and if I do not score his knave's pate, cut  my staff into fagots and call me woman.\" So saying, he gathered himself  together to depart.    \"Nay,\" quoth the landlord, standing in front of him and holding out his  arms like a gooseherd driving his flock, for money made him bold, \"thou  goest not till thou hast paid me my score.\"    \"But did not he pay thee?\"    \"Not so much as one farthing; and ten good shillings' worth of ale have  ye drunk this day. Nay, I say, thou goest not away without paying me,  else shall our good Sheriff know of it.\"    \"But nought have I to pay thee with, good fellow,\" quoth the Tinker.    \"'Good fellow' not me,\" said the landlord. \"Good fellow am I not when  it cometh to lose ten shillings! Pay me that thou owest me in broad  money, or else leave thy coat and bag and hammer; yet, I wot they  are not worth ten shillings, and I shall lose thereby. Nay, an thou  stirrest, I have a great dog within and I will loose him upon thee.  Maken, open thou the door and let forth Brian if this fellow stirs one  step.\"    \"Nay,\" quoth the Tinker--for, by roaming the country, he had learned  what dogs were--\"take thou what thou wilt have, and let me depart in  peace, and may a murrain go with thee. But oh, landlord! An I catch yon  scurvy varlet, I swear he shall pay full with usury for that he hath  had!\"    So saying, he strode away toward the forest, talking to himself, while  the landlord and his worthy dame and Maken stood looking after him, and  laughed when he had fairly gone.    \"Robin and I stripped yon ass of his pack main neatly,\" quoth the  landlord.    Now it happened about this time that Robin Hood was going through the  forest to Fosse Way, to see what was to be seen there, for the moon was  full and the night gave promise of being bright. In his hand he carried  his stout oaken staff, and at his side hung his bugle horn. As thus he  walked up a forest path, whistling, down another path came the Tinker,  muttering to himself and shaking his head like an angry bull; and so,  at a sudden bend, they met sharply face to face. Each stood still for a  time, and then Robin spoke:    \"Halloa, my sweet bird,\" said he, laughing merrily, \"how likest thou  thine ale? Wilt not sing to me another song?\"    The Tinker said nothing at first but stood looking at Robin with a grim  face. \"Now,\" quoth he at last, \"I am right glad I have met thee, and if  I do not rattle thy bones within thy hide this day, I give thee leave to  put thy foot upon my neck.\"    \"With all my heart,\" cried merry Robin. \"Rattle my bones, an thou  canst.\" So saying, he gripped his staff and threw himself upon his  guard. Then the Tinker spat upon his hands and, grasping his staff, came  straight at the other. He struck two or three blows, but soon"]]]
