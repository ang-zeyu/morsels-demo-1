Poisoned their minds with  hate.\"    \"Oh--ah!\" Cherry shuddered. \"Gives me the creeps to think of that son of  his prowling about here at night.\"    \"Oh come!\" Applegate sprang up. \"It's not as bad as all that. Come on,  Cherry.\" He put out his hands. \"How about a song. I'll do the honors at  the old grand. Happy days.\"    \"I'd love it!\" said Cherry, allowing herself to be led away to the  corner where a huge grand piano loomed out of the shadows.    Taking up a candle, Alice carried it to that corner, set it on the  piano, then tiptoed back.    With this pale light playing across their interesting mobile faces the  young Lord and Cherry took their places.    The moments that followed will linger long in David's memory. Never  before had he seen or heard anything like it. The pale light playing on  two bright happy faces, eager for all life, and most of all the perfect  blending of mellow tones from the ancient piano with the fresh, free joy  of Cherry's voice. Ah! That was something indeed! More than once,  without knowing it, he whispered:    \"Oh Cherry! I didn't know you could sing like that!\"    From moment to moment the mood of the music changed. Now the girl's  slender form was swaying to \"It's a Lovely Day Tomorrow,\" the next she  was bringing back for good old Jock's sake a song loved by all those of  twenty years before:      \"There's a long, long trail awinding    Into the land of my dreams,    Where the nightingale is singing    And the white moon beams.\"    And then, springing to a place on the long piano bench she cried: \"Now!  Let's all sing, Roll out the barrel.\"    Long before this songfest was over Dave found himself bursting with a  wonderful plan. No, it was not his war. But he could do his bit,  couldn't he? And he would.    When quite out of breath after her last rollicking song Cherry was led  to her place by the fire, she exclaimed:    \"Oh! It's wonderful just to live!\"    \"Yes,\" the Young Lord agreed. \"It is grand. And yet, perhaps tomorrow we  die.    \"Come!\" He took Brand by the shoulder. \"Let's go out and see the holes  those bombs dug for you. I've got to report to my C. O. about them.\" And  so the two of them disappeared into the night.    \"Come Peggy. Come Tillie,\" Alice called. \"Time for a goodnight story.  And then to bed.\"    \"Will you really tell us a spy story?\" Peggy begged.    \"Perhaps.\"    \"A real, true spy story!\" Tillie was fairly dancing.    \"Yes, I guess so.\"    At that Alice, the two children, and Flash, the dog, marched into the  small dining room to close the door behind them.    \"It was the Young Lord who piloted that Tomahawk plane this afternoon,\"  Jock said in a hoarse whisper. \"I have it on good authority, the very  best.\"    \"And he said never a word about it!\" Dave marvelled.    \"He's like that.\" Cherry's lips went white. \"He never tells of such  things. But just think! He nearly crashed!\"    \"So near I closed my eyes,\" Dave replied admiringly. \"Young Lord,\" he  thought. \"Not a bad name for a chap like that!\"                                        _Chapter VI_                                 Lady Spies      When Jock had gone stomping out to follow the Young Lord on his tour of  inspection, Dave found himself alone with Cherry.    \"Listen, Cherry.\" He was more excited than the girl had ever known him  to be. \"I've got a grand idea!\"    \"That's what England needs right now,\" the girl laughed nervously. \"Just  think what happened today, and is likely to happen more and more.\"    \"That's just it!\" Dave leaned forward eagerly. \"In all of England there  are thousands of anxious people, millions, really, who need a touch of  youthful cheer. And you can give it to them!\"    \"I?\" The girl caught her breath. \"How?\"    \"By singing for them as you sang for us tonight--singing over the  radio.\"    \"Oh--o!\" Cherry drew in a long breath. \"I hadn't thought of doing that.  You--you see, I'm only a local song bird in a little country village.  Easter at the church, you know, Christmas carols, parties, and all that.  But the radio! I--I--just--\"    \"Don't say you couldn't,\" Dave pleaded. \"Please say you'll try. We must  each do our bit.\" He had forgotten for the moment that this was not his  war.    \"Yes, I know,\" Cherry breathed. \"There's mother, you know. She was a  World War nurse. Now she's directing an entire ward. Alice has her  refugee children. And I--I just sit in the sun and tend the sheep.\"    \"Yes. And you might be the most talked-of girl in England!\" Dave was  bursting with his new idea. \"Just go up to London with me tomorrow. My  uncle has a trans-Atlantic news broadcast. He'll arrange it all.  Wi--will you go?\"    \"Sure! Shake on it.\" The girl put out a slim hand.    \"It's just as I thought,\" declared the Little Lord, as the men came  stomping back into the room a moment later. \"Those bombs were rather  small. A Messerschmitt can't carry a heavy load. But they can keep all  of England on edge with their nuisance flight.\"    \"Cheerio!\" Cherry sprang to her feet. \"At least one Messerschmitt has  ceased to be a nuisance, and that, I'm told, is because a certain Young  Lord learned how to fly long ago.\"    \"All part of a day's work,\" the Young Lord grinned. \"I'd like just such  a scrap every morning before breakfast.\"    At that the cook brought in cakes and steaming coffee and they all took  seats by the great broad three-inch thick table that had served the  Ramsey family for more than a hundred years.    In the meantime Alice was telling her young refugees the promised spy  story.    \"Once,\" she began, \"in that other terrible war, the one in which my  father and your grandfather fought, there were two spies named Louise  and Charlotte.\"    \"Oh!\" Tillie exclaimed with a sudden start. \"Are there really lady  spies?\"    \"To be sure,\" was the quiet reply.    \"Goody!\" Tillie clapped her hands. \"I'm going to be a lady spy!\"    \"Yes sir!\" Peggy broke in with her high, piping voice. \"We'll both be  spies. You be Louise, and I'll be Charlotte!\"    \"Wait and see!\" the story teller warned. \"Let me tell you the story.  Then you may not want to be a spy at all!\"    \"Oh, yes we will!\" Tillie insisted. \"Aunt Alice (they called her aunt)  do we have a spy right here on our farm?\" The child's voice was low,  mysterious.    \"Hush!\" Alice warned. \"Don't dare to breathe a word about that.\"    \"Tillie!\" The younger child's voice rose sharply, \"Let her tell the  story!\"    And so, while the children lay back among the cushions, Alice told the  story of Louise and Charlotte.    \"They had lived in France.\" Her voice was low and mellow. \"Then had come  the terrible German soldiers. Louise fled before them. Charlotte hid in  a cellar.    \"Louise was very bright. She had been a teacher. She could speak French,  German and Belgian.    \"A great soldier asked her to be a spy. This frightened her nearly out  of her wits. But she said 'all right. I will do it.'    \"One dark night a great giant of a man named Alphonse, who had been a  smuggler and was a friend of her country, took her hand and said: 'We  will go.'\"    \"Wh--where did they go?\" Tillie was growing excited.    \"They went to the border.\" Alice smiled. \"At the border there was a very  high barbed wire fence. You couldn't go over it. If you tried to go  under it you might touch an electric wire that would sound an alarm.  Then you would be shot. If you tripped on something it might set off a  mine, and you'd be blown to bits.\"    \"And wa--was--\" Tillie got no further. Her sister's fingers were on her  lips.    \"Alphonse knew all about these things,\" Alice went on. \"He made a hole  under the fence. The earth was very loose. He had gone under before.  They got across safely. Then they were in the land where German soldiers  were. And, just when they were breathing easy, a blinding white light  swept along the barbed wire fence. It was searching for them.\"    \"And--did--\"    \"Alphonse and Louise dropped flat and lay there hiding their faces in  the damp earth. The sweeping searchlight came and went, came and went,  then came to go away for good.\"    \"Oh--oo!\" Peggy breathed. \"They didn't get them.\"    Just then Tillie sat straight up. \"Aunt Alice!\" she cried. \"We _do_ have  a spy on our farm. I saw his face at the window. I really did, just  now.\" At that same instant the dog Flash growled softly.    Visibly shaken, Alice managed to regain her poise. \"Shish!\" was all she  said. Then she went on with her story.    \"When this loyal French girl reached her home where German soldiers now  were living, she began making lace and selling it from town to town.  What was more important, she was finding friends to help her work as a  spy. One was a scientist who could do strange things with chemicals,  magnifying glasses, cameras and printing presses. Another was a map  maker who in shorthand could write three thousand words with invisible  ink on a piece of transparent paper so small Louise could paste it to a  spectacle lens and carry it across the line that way.\"    \"What for?\" Tillie breathed.    \"So none of the German spies could read it,\" Alice explained.    \"You see,\" she went on, \"things were happening over there that great  French and English officers needed to know. And Louise could tell them.  Once there was a terrible battle. Thousands of Germans were wounded. How  many? Louise must find out.    \"There was a house close to the railroad track where all the cars filled  with wounded soldiers were passing. Someone hid in the dark room. Every  time a car passed, she'd tap on the floor, tap, tap, tap. In the next  room, seeming to study her lessons, was a school girl.\"    \"Just like you and me!\" Tillie squeezed Peggy's arm.    \"This school girl was making marks on paper,\" Alice went on. \"Four  marks, then one across, four more and one across.\"    \"Keeping track of the taps. I could do that.\" Tillie was growing excited  again.    \"When all the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4932"],[0,"A Knight of the White Cross: A Tale of the Siege of Rhodes (#5)"],[1,"t, but the rule is constantly broken.  Were it otherwise there could be no commanderies in this or any  other country; we should have, on entering the Order, to abandon our  nationality, and to form part of one community in the East. The Order  is true to its oaths. We cannot defend the Holy Sepulchre, for that,  for the present, is hopelessly lost; but we can and do wage war with  the infidel. For this funds are necessary as well as swords, and our  commanderies throughout Europe supply the funds by which the struggle is  maintained, and, when it is needed, send out contingents to help those  fighting in the East. It was from the neglect of this cardinal point  that the Templars fell. Their commanderies amassed wealth and wide  possessions, but unlike us the knights abstained altogether from  fulfilling their vows, and ceased to resist the infidel. Therefore they  were suppressed, and, with the general approval of Europe, a portion of  their possessions was handed over to the knights of St. John. However,  as I understand, it is your wish that as soon as the boy comes of age  to wield arms he shall go to Rhodes and become an active member of the  Order. This is indeed the rule with all neophytes, but having served  a certain time they are then permitted to return and join one of the  commanderies in their native countries.\"    \"I do not wish that for Gervaise,\" his father said; \"at least, I wish  him to remain at Rhodes until all the civil troubles are absolutely  at an end here. My life has been ruined by them. Loving retirement and  quiet, and longing for nothing so much as a life among my tenantry, I  have almost from a boy been actively engaged in warfare or have been  away as an exile. Here every one of gentle blood has been more or less  mixed up in these civil broils. To few of us does it personally matter  whether a member of the House of York or Lancaster sits on the throne,  and yet we have been almost compelled to take sides with one or the  other; and now, in my middle age I am on the eve of another battle  in which I risk my life and fortune. If we win I gain naught but the  satisfaction of seeing young Edward made King of England. If we lose I  am going into exile again, or I may leave my wife a widow, and my child  penniless.\"    \"It is too true, Tresham; and as I am as likely to fall as you are, the  child might be left without a protector as well as fatherless. However,  against that I will provide. I will write a letter to Peter D'Aubusson,  who is the real governor of Rhodes, for the Grand Master Orsini is so  old that his rule is little more than nominal. At his death D'Aubusson  is certain to be elected Grand Master. He is a dear friend of mine. We  entered the Order the same year, and were comrades in many a fight with  the Moslems, and I am quite sure that when I tell him that it is my last  request of him, he will, in memory of our long friendship, appoint your  son as one of the Grand Master's pages. As you know, no one, however  high his rank, is accepted as a novice before the age of sixteen.  After a year's probation he is received into the body of the Order as a  professed knight, and must go out and serve for a time in Rhodes. After  three years of active service he must reside two more at the convent,  and can then be made a commander. There is but one exception to the  rule--namely, that the pages of the grand master are entitled to  the privilege of admission at the age of twelve, so that they become  professed knights at thirteen. Your son is now but nine, you say, and  we must remember that D'Aubusson is not yet Grand Master, and Orsini may  live for some years yet. D'Aubusson, however, can doubtless get him to  appoint the boy as one of his pages. But, in any case, there are three  years yet to be passed before he can go out. Doubtless these he will  spend under his mother's care; but as it is as well to provide against  everything, I will furnish your dame with a letter to the knight who  will probably succeed me as Grand Prior of the English langue, asking  him to see to the care and education of the boy up to the time when he  can proceed to Rhodes. We may hope, my dear Tresham, that there will be  no occasion to use such documents, and that you and I may both be able  personally to watch over his career. Still, it is as well to take every  precaution. I shall, of course, give D'Aubusson full particulars about  you, your vow, and your wishes.\"    \"I thank you greatly, old friend,\" Sir Thomas said. \"It has taken a  load off my mind. I shall leave him here with his mother when we march  forward, and bid her, if ill befalls me, cross again to France, and then  to keep Gervaise with her until she can bring herself to part with him.  She has her jewels and a considerable sum of money which I accepted from  the man who has been enjoying my estates for the last five years, in  lieu of the monies that he had received during that time. Therefore, she  will not lack means for some years to come. Besides, Queen Margaret has  a real affection for her, and will, doubtless, be glad to have her with  her again in exile.\"    \"When I am old enough,\" Gervaise said, suddenly looking up from a missal  of the Grand Prior's which he had been examining, \"I will chop off the  head of the Duke of York, and bring mother back to England.\"    \"You will be a valiant champion no doubt, my boy,\" the prior said,  laughing. \"But that is just what your father does not want. Chop off the  heads of as many infidels as you will, but leave Englishmen alone, be  they dukes or commoners. It is a far more glorious career to be aiding  to defend Europe against the Moslem than to be engaged in wars with your  own countrymen. If the great lords will fight, let them fight it out  themselves without our aid; but I hope that long before you become a  man even they will be tired of these perpetual broils, and that some  agreement may be arrived at, and peace reign in this unhappy land.\"    \"Besides, Gervaise,\" his father added, \"you must bear in mind always  that my earnest wish and hope is that you will become a champion of  the Cross. I took a solemn vow before you were born that if a son were  granted to me I would dedicate him to the service of the Cross, and if I  am taken from you, you must still try to carry that oath into effect.  I trust that, at any rate for some years after you attain manhood,  you will expend your whole strength and powers in the defence of  Christianity, and as a worthy knight of the Order of St. John. Too many  of the knights, after serving for three years against the infidels,  return to their native countries and pass the rest of their lives in  slothful ease at their commanderies, save perhaps when at any great  crisis they go out for a while and join in the struggle. Such is not the  life I should wish you to lead. At the death of your mother and myself,  you will have no family ties in England--nothing to recall you here. If  the House of York succeeds in establishing itself firmly on the throne,  my estates will be forfeited. Therefore, regard Rhodes as your permanent  home, and devote your life to the Order. Beginning so young, you may  hope to distinguish yourself--to gain high rank in it; but remember that  though these are my wishes, they are not my orders, and that your career  must be in your own hands.\"    \"I will be a brave knight, father,\" the boy said firmly.    \"That is right, my boy. Now go upstairs to your bed; it is already late.  I do not regret my vow,\" he went on, after Gervaise had left the room,  \"though I regret that he is my only son. It is singular that men should  care about what comes after them, but I suppose it is human nature.  I should have liked to think that my descendants would sit in the old  house, and that men of my race and name would long own the estates. But  doubtless it is all for the best; for at least I can view the permanent  loss of my estates, in case the Yorkists triumph, without any poignant  regret.\"    \"Doubtless it is for the best, Tresham, and you must remember that  things may not, even now, turn out as you think. A knight who has done a  brave service does not find much difficulty in obtaining from the Pope  a dispensation from his vows. Numbers of knights have so left the Order  and have married and perpetuated their name. It is almost a necessity  that it should be so, for otherwise many princes and barons would  object to their sons entering the Order. Its object is to keep back the  irruption of the Moslems, and when men have done their share of hard  work no regret need be felt if they desire to leave the Order. Our  founder had no thought of covering Europe with monasteries, and beyond  the fact that it is necessary there should be men to administer our  manors and estates, I see no reason why any should not freely leave when  they reach the age of thirty or thirty-five, and indeed believe that it  would strengthen rather than weaken us were the vows, taken at the age  of seventeen, to be for fifteen years only.\"    \"There is something in that,\" the knight said thoughtfully. \"However,  that is far in the distance, and concerns me but little; still, I agree  with you, for I see no advantage in men, after their time of usefulness  to the Order is past, being bound to settle down to a monastic life if  by nature and habit unsuited for it. There are some spirits who,  after long years of warfare, are well content so to do, but there are  assuredly others to whom a life of forced inactivity, after a youth and  manhood spent in action, must be well nigh unendurable. And now tell me  frankly what you think of our chances here.\"    \"Everything depends upon time. Promises of aid have come in from all  quarters, and if Edward delays we shall soon be at the head of an  overwhelming force. But Edward, with all his faults and vices, is an  able and energetic leader, and must be well aware that if he is to  strike successfully he must"]]]
