The prize    was a crown of wild olive, and the winner returned in triumph to his    city, where poets sang his praises, a special seat at public games was    reserved for him, and often artists were employed to make a bronze    statue of him to be set up in Olympia or in his own city.      [Illustration: GREEK GAMES--RUNNING From an antique vase]    THE GOVERNMENT OF ATHENS. The citizen of Athens, and of other Greek    cities, had more to do with his government than do most Americans with    theirs. As nearly all work was done by slaves, he had plenty of time    to attend meetings. All the citizens could attend the great assembly,    or _ecclesia_, where six thousand at least must be present before    anything could be decided. By this assembly foreigners might be    admitted to citizenship or citizens might be expelled, or ostracized,    from Athens as hurtful to its welfare.      There was a smaller council of five hundred which decided less    important questions without laying them before the general assembly.    This body was chosen by lot just as our juries are, but members of the    council whose term had ended had a right to object to any new member    as an unworthy citizen A tenth of the council ruled for a tenth of the    year, and they chose their president by lot every day, so that any    worthy man at Athens had a chance to be president for a day and a    night.      [Illustration: A DECREE OF THE COUNCIL--ABOUT 450 B.C.]      Many citizens also served in the courts, for there were six thousand    judges, and in deciding important cases as many as a thousand and one,    or even fifteen hundred and one, took part. Before such large courts    and assemblies it was necessary to be a good speaker to be able to win    a case or persuade the citizens. Some of the greatest orators of the    world were Athenians, the best known being Demosthenes.    SOCRATES. The Athenians were not always just, although so many of them    acted as judges. One court, composed of five hundred and one judges,    condemned to death Socrates, the wisest man of the Greeks and one of    the wisest in the world. He did not make speeches, or write books, or    teach in school. He went about, in the market place, at the gymnasium,    and on the streets, asking men, young and old, questions about what    interested him most, that is, What is the true way to live? If people    did not give him an answer which seemed good, he asked more questions,    until sometimes they went away angry. Many of them thought because he    asked questions about everything that he did not believe in anything,    not even in the religion of his city.      [Illustration: SOCRATES After the marble bust in the Vatican]    THE DEATH OF SOCRATES, 399 B.C. After a while the enemies of Socrates    accused him of being a wicked man who persuaded young men to be    wicked. He was tried by an Athenian court, which made the terrible    blunder of finding him guilty and condemning him to death. According    to the Athenian custom he was obliged to drink a cup of poisonous    hemlock. This he did, after talking to his friends cheerily about how    a good man should live. As he wrote no books we have learned about him    from his friends. The most famous of these was Plato, who is also    counted among the wisest men that ever lived. The story of the lives    of these men is another gift which the Greeks made to all who were to    live after them, and it is quite as valuable as are the ways of    building, artistic skill, or great poems and plays.

CHAPTER IV      GREEK EMIGRANTS OR COLONISTS    WHEN THE ATLANTIC WAS UNKNOWN. One of the most important things    done by the men of Ancient Times was to explore the coasts and lands of    Europe and to make settlements wherever they went. At first they knew    little of the western and northern parts of Europe. Herodotus, a Greek    whom we call the \"Father of History,\" and who was a great traveler,    said, \"Though I have taken vast pains, I have never been able to get an    assurance from any eye-witness that there is any sea on the further side    of Europe.\" By the \"further side\" he meant \"western,\" and his remark    shows that he did not know of the Atlantic Ocean. He understood that tin    and amber came from the \"Tin Islands,\" which he called the \"ends of the    earth.\" As tin came from England, it is plain that he had heard a little    of that island.      [Illustration: MAP OF THE WORLD AS DESCRIBED BY THE GREEK    HISTORIAN HERODOTUS]    GREEK EMIGRANTS. Long before Athens became a great and beautiful    city the Greeks had begun to make settlements on distant shores. Those    who lived on the western coast of Asia Minor, as well as those who lived    where the kingdom of Greece is now, sent out colonists or emigrants. The    Greek colonies were very important, because by them the ancient    civilized world was made larger, just as by the settlement of America    the modern world was doubled in size. The colonists sailed away from    home for the same reasons which led our forefathers to leave England and    Europe for America. They either hoped to find it easier in a new land to    make a living and obtain property, or they did not like the way their    city was ruled, and being unable to change this, resolved to build    elsewhere a city which they could manage as they pleased.    HOW THEY LOCATED A NEW CITY. There were several different lands to    which they could go, just as the European of to-day may sail for the    United States or South America or Australia. They could attempt to    settle on the shores of the Black Sea, or cross over to northern Africa,    or try to reach Italy and the more distant coasts of what are now France    and Spain. In order to choose wisely, they generally asked the advice of    the priests of their god Apollo at his temple at Delphi. These priests    knew more about good places for settlements than most other persons,    because travelers from everywhere came to Delphi and the priests were    wise enough to inquire about all parts of the world.      [Illustration: _The territory occupied by the Greeks is    indicated by solid black_]      The story is told that one group of emigrants was advised to locate    their new colony opposite the \"city of the blind.\" They discovered that    these words meant that an earlier band of emigrants had passed by the    wonderful harbor of the present city of Constantinople and had settled    instead on the other shore of the Bosphorus. Taught by the oracle they    chose the better place and began to build the city of Byzantium, which    later became Constantinople.    MOTHER AND DAUGHTER CITIES. Solemn ceremonies took place when    colonists departed. They carried with them fire from the hearth of the    mother city in order to light a similar fire on their new hearth, for    every city had its hearthstone and on it a fire that was never quenched.    The ties between the mother and the daughter city were close, and the    enemies of one were the enemies of the other. He who wished to visit the    colony usually went to the mother city to find a ship bound thither.    WHERE THE SETTLEMENTS WERE MADE. When the Greek sailors first    entered the Black Sea, they thought it a boundless ocean, and called it    the Pontus, a word which means \"The Main.\" Until that time they had been    accustomed to sail only from island to island in the Aegean Sea. After a    while they made settlements all around the shores of the Black Sea, and    in later times Athens drew from this region her supply of grain. Still    more important settlements were made in Sicily and southern Italy, for    it was through these settlements that some of the things the Greeks    knew, like the art of writing, were taught to the Italian tribes and to    the Romans.    DANGERS OF THE VOYAGE. At first Greek sailors feared the dangers of the    western Mediterranean as much as those of the Black Sea. They imagined    that the huge, misshapen, and dreadful monsters Scylla and Charybdis    lurked in the Straits of Messina waiting to seize and swallow the    unlucky passer-by. On the slopes of Mount Aetna dwelt, they thought,    hideous, one-eyed giants, the Cyclops, who fed their fierce appetites    with the quivering flesh of many captives.

Radicalism, so far from being  odious, is not the popular passport to power.  The men most bitterly  charged with it go to Congress with the largest majorities, while the  timid and doubtful are sent by lean majorities, or else left at home.  The strange controversy between the President and the Congress, at one  time so threatening, is disposed of by the people.  The high  reconstructive powers which he so confidently, ostentatiously, and  haughtily claimed, have been disallowed, denounced, and utterly  repudiated; while those claimed by Congress have been confirmed.    Of the spirit and magnitude of the canvass nothing need be said.  The  appeal was to the people, and the verdict was worthy of the tribunal.  Upon an occasion of his own selection, with the advice and approval of  his astute Secretary, soon after the members of the Congress had returned  to their constituents, the President quitted the executive mansion,  sandwiched himself between two recognized heroes,--men whom the whole  country delighted to honor,--and, with all the advantage which such  company could give him, stumped the country from the Atlantic to the  Mississippi, advocating everywhere his policy as against that of  Congress.  It was a strange sight, and perhaps the most disgraceful  exhibition ever made by any President; but, as no evil is entirely  unmixed, good has come of this, as from many others.  Ambitious,  unscrupulous, energetic, indefatigable, voluble, and plausible,--a  political gladiator, ready for a \"set-to\" in any crowd,--he is beaten in  his own chosen field, and stands to-day before the country as a convicted  usurper, a political criminal, guilty of a bold and persistent attempt to  possess himself of the legislative powers solemnly secured to Congress by  the Constitution.  No vindication could be more complete, no condemnation  could be more absolute and humiliating.  Unless reopened by the sword, as  recklessly threatened in some circles, this question is now closed for  all time.    Without attempting to settle here the metaphysical and somewhat  theological question (about which so much has already been said and  written), whether once in the Union means always in the Union,--agreeably  to the formula, Once in grace always in grace,--it is obvious to common  sense that the rebellious States stand to-day, in point of law, precisely  where they stood when, exhausted, beaten, conquered, they fell powerless  at the feet of Federal authority.  Their State governments were  overthrown, and the lives and property of the leaders of the Rebellion  were forfeited.  In reconstructing the institutions of these shattered  and overthrown States, Congress should begin with a clean slate, and make  clean work of it.  Let there be no hesitation.  It would be a cowardly  deference to a defeated and treacherous President, if any account were  made of the illegitimate, one-sided, sham governments hurried into  existence for a malign purpose in the absence of Congress.  These  pretended governments, which were never submitted to the people, and from  participation in which four millions of the loyal people were excluded by  Presidential order, should now be treated according to their true  character, as shams and impositions, and supplanted by true and  legitimate governments, in the formation of which loyal men, black and  white, shall participate.    It is not, however, within the scope of this paper to point out the  precise steps to be taken, and the means to be employed.  The people are  less concerned about these than the grand end to be attained.  They  demand such a reconstruction as shall put an end to the present  anarchical state of things in the late rebellious States,--where  frightful murders and wholesale massacres are perpetrated in the very  presence of Federal soldiers.  This horrible business they require shall  cease.  They want a reconstruction such as will protect loyal men, black  and white, in their persons and property; such a one as will cause  Northern industry, Northern capital, and Northern civilization to flow  into the South, and make a man from New England as much at home in  Carolina as elsewhere in the Republic.  No Chinese wall can now be  tolerated.  The South must be opened to the light of law and liberty, and  this session of Congress is relied upon to accomplish this important work.    The plain, common-sense way of doing this work, as intimated at the  beginning, is simply to establish in the South one law, one government,  one administration of justice, one condition to the exercise of the  elective franchise, for men of all races and colors alike.  This great  measure is sought as earnestly by loyal white men as by loyal blacks, and  is needed alike by both.  Let sound political prescience but take the  place of an unreasoning prejudice, and this will be done.    Men denounce the negro for his prominence in this discussion; but it is  no fault of his that in peace as in war, that in conquering Rebel armies  as in reconstructing the rebellious States, the right of the negro is the  true solution of our national troubles.  The stern logic of events, which  goes directly to the point, disdaining all concern for the color or  features of men, has determined the interests of the country as identical  with and inseparable from those of the negro.    The policy that emancipated and armed the negro--now seen to have been  wise and proper by the dullest--was not certainly more sternly demanded  than is now the policy of enfranchisement.  If with the negro was success  in war, and without him failure, so in peace it will be found that the  nation must fall or flourish with the negro.    Fortunately, the Constitution of the United States knows no distinction  between citizens on account of color.  Neither does it know any  difference between a citizen of a State and a citizen of the United  States.  Citizenship evidently includes all the rights of citizens,  whether State or national.  If the Constitution knows none, it is clearly  no part of the duty of a Republican Congress now to institute one.  The  mistake of the last session was the attempt to do this very thing, by a  renunciation of its power to secure political rights to any class of  citizens, with the obvious purpose to allow the rebellious States to  disfranchise, if they should see fit, their colored citizens.  This  unfortunate blunder must now be retrieved, and the emasculated  citizenship given to the negro supplanted by that contemplated in the  Constitution of the United States, which declares that the citizens of  each State shall enjoy all the rights and immunities of citizens of the  several States,--so that a legal voter in any State shall be a legal  voter in all the States."]]]
