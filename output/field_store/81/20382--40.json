I had, like most people, often been \"sat  upon,\" figuratively, during my life, but never literally, and it was with  some difficulty that I managed to extricate myself. The girl next  proceeded, with the assistance of a dirty pocket-handkerchief and the tin  drinking-mug belonging to the car, to perform her toilet and that of her  infant; her efforts resulting in a streakiness of dirt on both faces,  where the colour had been uniform before.    We were on the Prairie--the great rolling prairie, at last; and I was  disappointed--nothing but grass and sky, desolate and lonely. These,  however, were my first impressions. How fond I grew of the prairie I know  now that I am away from it; perhaps for ever. Towards night, black clouds  gathered in the sky, and distant thunder heralded the coming of one of  those great storms for which the prairie is so famous. The air was so  charged with electricity that the train had to be stopped several times,  and the wheels of the cars drenched with water to prevent their taking  fire. As night closed in, incessant flashes of white sheet lightning  almost blinded us. Each white flash was riven by red forks of flame,  until, with the horizon one constant blaze, the plain seemed a vast sea  of fire. Over our heads, in great zigzag lines, shot the fire fluid, as  the thunder rattled, roared, crashed, and broke around us; then, in a  momentary lull, came torrents of rain, rushing madly across the sward,  and drowning the noise of the fast-flying train, as if some fiend upon a  diabolical errand were borne through the warring elements. It seemed as  though two or three storms had met, to contend for mastery; flashes of  white, yellow, and red lightning outdid each other in brilliancy, and  peals of thunder, near and distant, reverberated in quick succession. No  one who has not encountered a rain-storm on the prairie can form an idea  of its grandeur and force.    During a short lull in the storm, we stopped at a place called Crookstown  for tea, following a touter for the \"_Ho_-tel\" there--or rather a  railway lantern, as the darkness completely hid the man--through mud and  water up to our ankles; over stumps and sticks; through a dilapidated  gateway, stoup, and wash-house, to a long, low room, where the table was  laid for tea. Seated round it on benches, chairs, three-legged stools--in  fact, on anything they could get hold of--were the engine-driver,  conductor, express-man, and other officials. The meal consisted of bread  and butter, potatoes boiled in their jackets, fried bacon swimming in  fat, and scalding tea in handleless cups. Asking for eggs, we were told  there was not one to be had in the \"town.\" Query, what is a town?  Crookstown could not boast of half a dozen houses besides the station.    Another hour's journey brought us to Fisher's Landing, on Red Lake River,  where we were to remain until next morning. Although the boat was at the  landing, we were not allowed to go on board until all the freight was  shipped. This intelligence was given us by a rakish-looking Yankee, who  added that his \"_Ho_-tel\" was the best in the place, and if we would  come \"right along\" he would give us rooms for the night. Gathering up our  traps, and thinking we could not do much worse than remain in the crowded  car all night, we followed, paddling through the mud to the much-boasted  \"_Ho_-tel.\" This was a house built of boards, the entrance room or  office having a high desk or counter across one corner; a recess under  the stairs in the other containing a bench, on which were ranged two or  three pails and a basin, while on the wall hung the general towel,  looking rather the worse for wear. A room opening from the recess had a  table set like the one at Crookstown, apparently for breakfast; the  floors were literally covered with mud. What, we surmised, can the  bedrooms be like in such a place? Our question was only too soon  answered. Presently a shaggy-headed, untidy woman made her appearance,  hastily fastening her clothes. She was very cross, and grumbled that  there were only two rooms, but that she would take one of us in with her  (an offer which was politely declined), and snappishly ordered a man to  show the way upstairs. Clambering up a steep flight of steps after our  conductor and his lantern, we were ushered into a room containing a  bed--which had all the appearance of having been slept in for a week--a  rocking-chair, and a bureau; a smaller room opening out of it also  contained a very-much-slept-in bed. Throwing open the door of the latter  room with a flourish that would have been creditable in a professional  showman, he introduced us.    \"This, ladies, you can have. Two can sleep here _nicely_. True, the  bed has not been made, but I can soon settle that!\" and putting his  lantern on the floor, he gave the bed a poke or two, and tried to smooth  the frowsy-looking coverlet.    \"Oh, that's the express-man's bed!\" he said, in answer to our inquiry as  to who was to occupy the outer room. \"Must have it, you know; always  stops here. The best room in the town!\"    Seeing that we did not appear satisfied, he added--    \"You can lock your door\" (there was a whole board a foot wide out of the  partition); \"and, after all, it's only the express-man; you needn't mind  him. Then in the morning you can sit here, for he is off early, and we  make it the ladies' sitting-room.\" And drawing the rocking-chair to the  window, he set it going.    But as we still _did_ object to the express-man's proximity, he led  the way to another room, about the same size, but with a door that we  could latch, a bunk bed, a wooden box, and, for toilet apparatus, a  yellow pudding-bowl, and white jug full of water. With some difficulty we  succeeded in getting a lamp, and spreading our rugs over the bed, we lay  down. When the tramping about downstairs ceased, sometime after midnight,  we dozed until morning. I was up first, and, going downstairs in search  of water, could not help laughing at the absurd sight of a row of legs  and dangling braces under the stairway, the heads belonging to them,  being bent over the pails I had noticed there the night before. Seven men  had slept on the floor of the express-man's room that night, for which  accommodation they paid three dollars (15s.). During the day some  twenty women emigrants, who were obliged to leave the car, taking refuge  there from the mud and rain, were charged twenty-five cents (1s. 3d.)  a head; and, as a concession, children were taken at half-price.    Breakfast was a repetition of the supper at Crookstown, and although  blessed with excellent appetites generally, we lost them completely at  Fisher's Landing. About noon, we smuggled ourselves on board the  _Minnesota_, and a few judicious tips enabled us to take up our  quarters there at once. How we did enjoy our dinner! Never did fish,  flesh, or fowl taste so good, and we felt compelled to apologize to the  steward for the emptiness of the dishes he carried away. However, he did  not appear astonished, as the bill of fare at the \"_Ho_-tel\" was  well known.    It was Thursday morning before all the freight was stowed away and we  could leave the landing--or \"Fisher's,\" as _habitu√©s_ of the road  call it. The _Minnesota_ is a very comfortable boat, and with the  exception of one or two farmers and their families, and an old  Frenchwoman, we had her to ourselves. The captain was a genial,  large-hearted Yankee, the steward and pretty little maid were very  attentive; and, by contrast with the \"_Ho_-tel,\" we thought  ourselves in pleasant quarters.          CHAPTER IV.    Red Lake River--Grand Forks--The Ferry--Custom-house Officers at  Pembina--Mud and Misery--Winnipeg at last--A Walk through the  Town--A Hospitable Welcome--Macadam wanted--Holy Trinity Church--A  Picturesque Population--Indians shopping--An \"All-sorts\" Store--St.  Boniface and its Bells--An Evening Scene.      Red Lake River flows into Red River at Grand Forks, some twelve or  thirteen miles below Fisher's Landing. It is much the narrower stream,  with so many bends that when we were not running headlong into the left  bank we grounded on the right. The boat frequently formed a bridge from  one bend to the other, and heads were ducked down or drawn back suddenly  to avoid having eyes scratched out by the spreading boughs of beech and  hazel which stretched over the stream. It was nothing unusual to find our  course impeded by a large branch becoming so entangled in the wheel at  the stern, that men had to get down and chop it away before the boat  could proceed.    At Grand Forks, where there is a Hudson Bay Company's trading post, a  billiard saloon, hotel, general store, and post-office all in one, and a  few smaller houses, the ferry is a large flat-bottomed sort of platform,  railed on either side and fastened to a long thick rope stretched across  the river. When there is a load to ferry over, this platform is let loose  from the shore, and the current carries it across, the rope keeping it  from going down stream. The shores of Red River are almost bare; a few  miserable poplars here and there, one or two small log-houses and  mud-built huts from which wild, dirty Indians emerged to watch the boat  pass, were all we saw upon them. The banks are for the most part so high  that only from the upper deck could we see inland.    The frontier post, Pembina, is well known as the spot beyond which in  1869 the rebel Louis Riel, the \"Little Napoleon\" of Red River, would not  allow Mr. McDougall, the \"lieutenant-governor of Manitoba,\" appointed by  the Canadian administration, to pass. Here we had a visit from the  custom-house officers. They were good specimens of their different  countries. The Canadian was a round, fat, jolly, handsome, fair man; the  Yankee was tall, slight, and black-eyed, with a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7128"],[0,"Indian Fairy Tales (#5)"],[1,"Prudhan's widow come  to the door, and beg for a few sticks from the fire to cook her  dinner with. Balna turned to her, angrily, and said, \"Why don't you  keep fuel in your own house, and not come here every day and take  ours? Sisters, don't give this woman any more wood; let her buy it for  herself.\"    Then the eldest sister answered, \"Balna, let the poor woman take the  wood and the fire; she does us no harm.\" But Balna replied, \"If you  let her come here so often, maybe she will do us some harm, and make  us sorry for it, some day.\"    The Raja then saw the Prudhan's widow go to the place where all his  dinner was nicely prepared, and, as she took the wood, she threw a  little mud into each of the dishes.    At this he was very angry, and sent to have the woman seized and  brought before him. But when the widow came, she told him that she had  played this trick because she wanted to gain an audience with him; and  she spoke so cleverly, and pleased him so well with her cunning words,  that instead of punishing her, the Raja married her, and made her his  Ranee, and she and her daughter came to live in the palace.    Now the new Ranee hated the seven poor Princesses, and wanted to get  them, if possible, out of the way, in order that her daughter might  have all their riches, and live in the palace as Princess in their  place; and instead of being grateful to them for their kindness to  her, she did all she could to make them miserable. She gave them  nothing but bread to eat, and very little of that, and very little  water to drink; so these seven poor little Princesses, who had been  accustomed to have everything comfortable about them, and good food  and good clothes all their lives long, were very miserable and  unhappy; and they used to go out every day and sit by their dead  mother's tomb and cry--and say:    \"Oh mother, mother, cannot you see your poor children, how unhappy we  are, and how we are starved by our cruel step-mother?\"    One day, whilst they were thus sobbing and crying, lo and behold! a  beautiful pomelo tree grew up out of the grave, covered with fresh  ripe pomeloes, and the children satisfied their hunger by eating some  of the fruit, and every day after this, instead of trying to eat the  bad dinner their step-mother provided for them, they used to go out to  their mother's grave and eat the pomeloes which grew there on the  beautiful tree.    Then the Ranee said to her daughter, \"I cannot tell how it is, every  day those seven girls say they don't want any dinner, and won't eat  any; and yet they never grow thin nor look ill; they look better than  you do. I cannot tell how it is.\" And she bade her watch the seven  Princesses, and see if any one gave them anything to eat.    So next day, when the Princesses went to their mother's grave, and  were eating the beautiful pomeloes, the Prudhan's daughter followed  them, and saw them gathering the fruit.    Then Balna said to her sisters, \"Do you not see that girl watching us?  Let us drive her away, or hide the pomeloes, else she will go and tell  her mother all about it, and that will be very bad for us.\"    But the other sisters said, \"Oh no, do not be unkind, Balna. The girl  would never be so cruel as to tell her mother. Let us rather invite  her to come and have some of the fruit.\" And calling her to them,  they gave her one of the pomeloes.    No sooner had she eaten it, however, than the Prudhan's daughter went  home and said to her mother, \"I do not wonder the seven Princesses  will not eat the dinner you prepare for them, for by their mother's  grave there grows a beautiful pomelo tree, and they go there every day  and eat the pomeloes. I ate one, and it was the nicest I have ever  tasted.\"    The cruel Ranee was much vexed at hearing this, and all next day she  stayed in her room, and told the Raja that she had a very bad  headache. The Raja was deeply grieved, and said to his wife, \"What can  I do for you?\" She answered, \"There is only one thing that will make  my headache well. By your dead wife's tomb there grows a fine pomelo  tree; you must bring that here, and boil it, root and branch, and put  a little of the water in which it has been boiled, on my forehead, and  that will cure my headache.\" So the Raja sent his servants, and had  the beautiful pomelo tree pulled up by the roots, and did as the Ranee  desired; and when some of the water, in which it had been boiled, was  put on her forehead, she said her headache was gone and she felt quite  well.    Next day, when the seven Princesses went as usual to the grave of  their mother, the pomelo tree had disappeared. Then they all began to  cry very bitterly.    Now there was by the Ranee's tomb a small tank, and as they were  crying they saw that the tank was filled with a rich cream-like  substance, which quickly hardened into a thick white cake. At seeing  this all the Princesses were very glad, and they ate some of the cake,  and liked it; and next day the same thing happened, and so it went on  for many days. Every morning the Princesses went to their mother's  grave, and found the little tank filled with the nourishing cream-like  cake. Then the cruel step-mother said to her daughter: \"I cannot tell  how it is, I have had the pomelo tree which used to grow by the  Ranee's grave destroyed, and yet the Princesses grow no thinner, nor  look more sad, though they never eat the dinner I give them. I cannot  tell how it is!\"    And her daughter said, \"I will watch.\"    Next day, while the Princesses were eating the cream cake, who should  come by but their step-mother's daughter. Balna saw her first, and  said, \"See, sisters, there comes that girl again. Let us sit round the  edge of the tank and not allow her to see it, for if we give her some  of our cake, she will go and tell her mother; and that will be very  unfortunate for us.\"    The other sisters, however, thought Balna unnecessarily suspicious,  and instead of following her advice, they gave the Prudhan's daughter  some of the cake, and she went home and told her mother all about it.    The Ranee, on hearing how well the Princesses fared, was exceedingly  angry, and sent her servants to pull down the dead Ranee's tomb, and  fill the little tank with the ruins. And not content with this, she  next day pretended to be very, very ill--in fact, at the point of  death--and when the Raja was much grieved, and asked her whether it  was in his power to procure her any remedy, she said to him: \"Only one  thing can save my life, but I know you will not do it.\" He replied,  \"Yes, whatever it is, I will do it.\" She then said, \"To save my life,  you must kill the seven daughters of your first wife, and put some of  their blood on my forehead and on the palms of my hands, and their  death will be my life.\" At these words the Raja was very sorrowful;  but because he feared to break his word, he went out with a heavy  heart to find his daughters.    He found them crying by the ruins of their mother's grave.    Then, feeling he could not kill them, the Raja spoke kindly to them,  and told them to come out into the jungle with him; and there he made  a fire and cooked some rice, and gave it to them. But in the  afternoon, it being very hot, the seven Princesses all fell asleep,  and when he saw they were fast asleep, the Raja, their father, stole  away and left them (for he feared his wife), saying to himself: \"It is  better my poor daughters should die here, than be killed by their  step-mother.\"    He then shot a deer, and returning home, put some of its blood on the  forehead and hands of the Ranee, and she thought then that he had  really killed the Princesses, and said she felt quite well.    Meantime the seven Princesses awoke, and when they found themselves  all alone in the thick jungle they were much frightened, and began to  call out as loud as they could, in hopes of making their father hear;  but he was by that time far away, and would not have been able to hear  them even had their voices been as loud as thunder.    It so happened that this very day the seven young sons of a  neighbouring Raja chanced to be hunting in that same jungle, and as  they were returning home, after the day's sport was over, the youngest  Prince said to his brothers: \"Stop, I think I hear some one crying and  calling out. Do you not hear voices? Let us go in the direction of  the sound, and find out what it is.\"    So the seven Princes rode through the wood until they came to the  place where the seven Princesses sat crying and wringing their hands.  At the sight of them the young Princes were very much astonished, and  still more so on learning their story; and they settled that each  should take one of these poor forlorn ladies home with him, and marry  her.    So the first and eldest Prince took the eldest Princess home with him,  and married her.    And the second took the second;    And the third took the third;    And the fourth took the fourth;    And the fifth took the fifth;    And the sixth took the sixth;    And the seventh, and the handsomest of all, took the beautiful Balna.    And when they got to their own land, there was great rejoicing  throughout the kingdom, at the marriage of the seven young Princes to  seven such beautiful Princesses.    About a year after this Balna had a little son, and his uncles and  aunts were so fond of the boy that it was as if he had seven fathers  and seven mothers. None of the other Princes and Princesses had any  children, so the son of the seventh Prince and Balna was acknowledged  their heir by all the rest.    They had thus lived very happily for some time, when one fine day the  seventh Prince (Balna's husband) said he would go out hunting, and  away he went; and they waited long for him, but he never came back.    Then his six brothers said they would go and see what had become of  him; and they went away, but they also did not return.    And the seven Princesses grieved very much,"]]]
