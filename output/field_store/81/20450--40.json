Wulf had donned a riding suit instead of court  attire, which, in deference to the king's partiality for the Normans,  was, even among the staunchest opposers of the foreigners, a  compromise between Saxon and Norman fashions. He now wore a tunic  of a bright green cloth, girded in at the waist and reaching only  to the knee. Over this was worn a garment closely resembling the  Roman toga, though somewhat less ample. The folds in front fell  below the waist, but it was looped up at each shoulder by a brooch,  leaving the arms bare. His legs were clad in tightly-fitting trousers,  and his feet in somewhat high shoes. On his head he wore a cap in  shape closely resembling the Phrygian bonnet. He was armed with a  dagger, and a short sword, which hung by a leather strap, two or  three inches long, from his belt. The outer garment had a hood which  could in bad weather be drawn over the head.    The man who was the bearer of Harold's orders to the steward wore  a civilian dress, not unlike that of Wulf's. He occupied the position  of a confidential scribe to Harold. The other wore the garb of a  soldier. He was clothed from head to foot in a tight fitting leather  suit, upon which were sewn iron rings overlapping each other, and  strongly resembling in appearance the chain-armour of later days.  His casque, with a curtain of leather similarly covered and affording  a protection to the neck, cheeks, and throat, hung from his saddle-bow,  and he wore a cap with a long projecting peak, while a cloak was  thrown over his shoulders and fell almost to his feet.    \"I am afraid you will find it but dull time with me, Leof,\" Wulf  said as they came up abreast of him, \"for the earl says that he has  charged you to remain with me at Steyning.\"    \"I shall not be sorry for that,\" the soldier said bluntly, \"for I  shall be right glad to be away from these Normans who fill every  place at court and swagger there as if Englishmen were but dirt  under their feet. Moreover, I love not London nor its ways, and  shall be glad to be down again among honest country folk, though I  would still rather be following my lord the earl in the field.\"    \"And you, Master Gurth, will your stay down at Steyning be a long  one?\"    \"No, indeed. I have but to bear my master's wishes and instructions  to the steward, and to stay for a few days to see that they are  carried out according to his desires. I am not like Leof, for I  prefer life in London, where one meets with learned monks and others,  can obtain sometimes the use of a choice manuscript, and can hear  the news from beyond the seas, whereas in the country there is  nought to talk about save beeves and sheep. I like the journey well  enough, though I would that the animal I bestrode were more gentle  in his paces. He has for the last half-hour been fretting on the  rein to place himself by the side of yours. Horses are well enough  for nobles and fighting men, but for a peaceful scrivener like  myself a chair makes a far more comfortable seat.\"    The soldier gave a contemptuous grunt, and Wulf laughed. \"It is  well that we have not all the same tastes, but for my part a seat  in a chair tires me more than one in a saddle, and I am never more  happy than when galloping briskly along,\" and he shook the reins,  a signal which the horse had been expecting for a considerable time,  and at once responded to by breaking into a canter.    \"Stay you, I pray, Master Wulf,\" the scrivener cried in great  tribulation as his horse followed the example of its companion.  \"Even if the animal does not break my neck he will jolt the life  out of me. I pray you curb him in if you would not see me prone in  the dust; and if I am disabled, who is to carry the earl's message  to the steward?\"    Wulf reined in his horse. \"Pardon me, good Gurth. I had forgotten  that you are not accustomed to journey on horseback. I was scarce  conscious, indeed, that I touched my horse, but he is used to travel  more rapidly, and was so eager to be off at the slightest hint that  I was willing that he should do so. We will try and journey soberly  for the rest of the distance.\"    Osgod was overtaken, plodding steadily along the road, fifteen miles  from town. Leof took him up on his horse, and they reached Guildford  just as the sun was setting. The inn, which stood in the principal  street of the town, was a low building built with a massive framework  filled in with bricks. The ground-floor was occupied by a single  room. At one end was the great fireplace where, over a pile of  blazing logs, were hung many cauldrons and pots. Round the room ran  a raised bench some six feet wide on which the guests disposed  themselves for sleep at night; rough tables and benches occupied  the rest of the room. Some twenty or thirty travellers were seated  at these. Few were eating, but the greater portion had horns of  beer or mead before them. As Wulf and his companions entered, after  giving over their horses to one of the helpers, the host, seeing  by his attire that he was of condition above the ordinary, came  forward and led him to the end of the room nearest the fire, where  the floor was raised a foot and a half above the general level,  forming a sort of dais where travellers of distinction could take  their meals apart from the rest of the guests. Leof was now spokesman.    \"We will have supper, and of your best, master host, for we have  ridden from London. We are in the service of Earl Harold, and are  riding with this young thane, Wulf of Steyning.\"    The name of Earl Harold was sufficient to gain for them the best  attentions of their host, and in twenty minutes supper was served,  consisting of trout broiled over the fire, swine's flesh, and a  stew of fowls and smoked bacon flavoured with herbs. Wulf took the  head of the table, and the other three sat a short distance below  him. The dishes were handed round, and each with his dagger cut off  his portion and ate it on his wooden platter with the assistance  of dagger and fingers only, for the utility of forks was at that  time a matter undreamt of. After the meal was over, the host brought  a ewer of water with a napkin, and each dipped his fingers into the  water, an operation necessary even for the most dainty feeder.  Presently a glee singer came in, and for an hour amused the guests  with songs, for the most part of a patriotic character.    Wulf was then conducted by the host to a small chamber upstairs,  where there was the luxury of a bed stuffed with straw. The rest  of the travellers, including Wulf's companions, merely wrapped  themselves in their cloaks and lay down on the raised bench which  ran round the room.    On the afternoon of the third day the party arrived at Steyning.  It was four years since Wulf had been at home, and he gave a shout  of pleasure as his eye fell on the long low house with its background  of trees, and touching his horse with his heel he left his companions  behind and galloped towards the door. An old servitor came out.    \"Why, Cedric, do you not know me? I am Wulf, whom you first taught  to play single-stick and to draw a bow.\"    \"Why, surely it is my young master,\" Cedric said, taking the hand  that Wulf held out to him and placing it to his lips; \"this is a  glad day indeed for us all. We have longed sorely for a sight of  you, for though I say nought against Master Egbert the steward, who  is well liked by all, it is not the same as having our lord with  us. You have come to stay, I trust.\"    \"For a time at any rate, Cedric. Earl Harold wishes me to learn my  duties as a thane and to fit myself to lead my people in the field  if it be necessary.\"    \"I trust that it never will be so,\" Cedric said, \"but as we fought  under your father so will we all be ready to fight under you should  it be needful. The men of Steyning were never backward when there  was fighting to be done, and in my young days there was no lack of  that, though we have had quiet times since King Edward came to the  throne.\"    The house was not built for the purpose of resistance, for, unlike  the Normans, the Saxons did not deem it necessary to convert their  houses into castles. It was, however, massively framed, the windows  on the ground-floor were barred, the door was strong and solid, and  after nightfall none could come in or go out without the knowledge  and consent of the master. Wulf's companions came up just as the  steward himself appeared at the door. He knew both Gurth and Leof,  having himself been in the service of Harold before being deputed  by him to manage the estates of Steyning during the earl's guardianship  of its thane.    \"The earl sends his greetings to you, Egbert,\" Gurth said, \"and he  has sent us hither with the young thane, who, as the letter I bring  from the earl will inform you, has come down to take up his position  as lord here, and to learn from you all things connected with his  estate.\"    \"Welcome to Steyning, thane,\" the steward said, doffing his cap;  \"it is well that you should be here. I have done my best to carry  out the earl's commands to keep all things in readiness for your  coming, and to be just and fair to the tenants, seeing that they  pay their dues, and yet not pressing too hardly upon them if things  go not well with them; but it is always best that the master should  be in his own place, and right willingly do I give over my authority  to you.\"    \"The authority has been in good hands, I know well,\" Wulf said,  \"and right heartily do I thank you for having so well filled my  place; but I would not take up my thaneship as yet I am but a boy,  and have to learn my duties from you, and shall account myself but  as your pupil. I know something of the ways of court, but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8770"],[0,"Milton (#5)"],[1,"ectly, its  signification is not that which Milton intended, viz. thoughtful, or  contemplative, but anxious, full of cares, carking. The rapid  purification of Milton's taste will be best perceived by comparing  _L'Allegro_ and _Il Penseroso_ of uncertain date, but written after  1632, with the _Ode on the Nativity_, written 1629. The Ode, notwith-  standing its foretaste of Milton's grandeur, abounds in frigid conceits,  from which the two later pieces are free. The Ode is frosty, as written  in winter, within the four walls of a college chamber. The two idylls  breathe the free air of spring and summer, and of the fields round  Horton. They are thoroughly naturalistic; the choicest expression our  language has yet found of the fresh charm of country life, not as that  life is lived by the peasant, but as it is felt by a young and lettered  student, issuing at early dawn, or at sunset, into the fields from his  chamber and his books. All rural sights and sounds and smells are here  blended in that ineffable combination, which once or twice perhaps in  our lives has saluted our young senses before their perceptions were  blunted by        alcohol, by lust, or ambition, or diluted by the social      distractions of great cities.        The fidelity to nature of the imagery of these poems      has been impugned by the critics.        Then to come, in spite of sorrow,      And at my window bid good morrow.    The skylark never approaches human habitations in this way, as the  redbreast does, Mr. Masson replies that the subject of the verb \"to  come\" is, not the skylark, but L'Allegro, the joyous student. I cannot  construe the lines as Mr. Masson does, even though the consequence  were to convict Milton, a city-bred youth, of not knowing a skylark  from a sparrow when he saw it. A close observer of things around us  would not speak of the eglantine as twisted, of the cowslip as wan,  of the violet as glowing, or of the reed as balmy. Lycidas' laureate  hearse is to be strewn at once with primrose and woodbine, daffodil  and jasmine. When we read \"the rathe primrose that forsaken dies,\" we  see that the poet is recollecting Shakespeare (Winter's Tale, 4. 4),  not looking at the primrose. The pine is not \"rooted deep as high\"  (_P.R._ 4416), but sends its roots along the surface. The elm, one of  the thinnest foliaged trees of the forest, is inappropriately named  starproof (_Arc_. 89). Lightning does not singe the tops of trees  (_P.L._ i. 613), but either shivers them, or cuts a groove down the  stem to the ground. These and other such like inaccuracies must be set  down partly to conventional language used without meaning, the vice  of Latin versification enforced as a task, but they are partly due to  real defect of natural knowledge.    Other objections of the critics on the same score, which may be met  with, are easily dismissed. The objector, who can discover no reason  why the oak should be styled \"monumental,\" meets with his match in  the defender who suggests, that it may be rightly so called because  monuments in churches are made of oak. I should tremble to have to  offer an explanation to critics of Milton so acute as these two. But  of less ingenious readers I would ask, if any single word can be found  equal to \"monumental\" in its power of suggesting to the imagination  the historic oak of park or chase, up to the knees in fern, which has  outlasted ten generations of men; has been the mute witness of the  scenes of love, treachery, or violence enacted in the baronial hall  which it shadows and protects; and has been so associated with man,  that it is now rather a column and memorial obelisk than a tree of the  forest?    These are the humours of criticism. But, apart from these, a  naturalist is at once aware that Milton had neither the eye nor the  ear of a naturalist. At no time, even before his loss of sight, was he  an exact observer of natural objects. It may be that he knew a  skylark from a redbreast, and did not confound the dog-rose with the  honeysuckle. But I am sure that he had never acquired that interest in  nature's things and ways, which leads to close and loving watching  of them. He had not that sense of outdoor nature, empirical and not  scientific, which endows the _Angler_ of his cotemporary Walton, with  its enduring charm, and which is to be acquired only by living in the  open country in childhood. Milton is not a man of the fields, but of  books. His life is in his study, and when he steps abroad into the air  he carries his study thoughts with him. He does look at nature, but he  sees her through books. Natural impressions are received from without,  but always in those forms of beautiful speech, in which the poets of  all ages have clothed them. His epithets are not, like the epithets of  the school of Dryden and Pope, culled from the _Gradus ad Parnassum_;  they are expressive of some reality, but it is of a real emotion in  the spectator's soul, not of any quality detected by keen insight  in the objects themselves. This emotion Milton's art stamps with an  epithet, which shall convey the added charm of classical reminiscence.  When, e.g., he speaks of \"the wand'ring moon,\" the original  significance of the epithet comes home to the scholarly reader with  the enhanced effect of its association with the \"errantem lunam\" of  Virgil. Nor because it is adopted from Virgil has the epithet here the  second-hand effect of a copy. If Milton sees nature through books, he  still sees it.        To behold the wand'ring moon,      Riding near her highest noon,      Like one that had been led astray.      Through the heaven's wide pathless way,      And oft, as if her head she bow'd,      Stooping through a fleecy cloud.    No allegation that \"wand'ring moon\" is borrowed from Horace can hide  from us that Milton, though he remembered Horace, had watched the  phenomenon with a feeling so intense that he projected his own soul's  throb into the object before him, and named it with what Thomson calls  \"recollected love\".    Milton's attitude towards nature is not that of a scientific  naturalist, nor even that of a close observer. It is that of a poet  who feels its total influence too powerfully to dissect it. If, as I  have said, Milton reads books first and nature afterwards, it is not  to test nature by his books, but to learn from both. He is learning  not books, but from books. All he reads, sees, hears, is to him but  nutriment for the soul. He is making himself. Man is to him the  highest object; nature is subordinate to man, not only in its more  vulgar uses, but as an excitant of fine emotion. He is not concerned  to register the facts and phenomena of nature, but to convey the  impressions they make on a sensitive soul. The external forms of  things are to be presented to us as transformed through the heart and  mind of the poet. The moon is endowed with life and will, \"stooping\",  \"riding\", \"wand'ring\", \"bowing her head\", not as a frigid  personification, and because the ancient poets so personified her, but  by communication to her of the intense agitation which the nocturnal  spectacle rouses in the poet's own breast.    I have sometimes read that these two idylls are \"masterpieces of  description\". Other critics will ask if in the scenery of _L'Allegro_  and _Il Penseroso_ Milton has described the country about Horton, in  Bucks, or that about Forest Hill, in Oxfordshire; and will object that  the Chiltern Hills are not high enough for clouds to rest upon their  top, much less upon their breast. But he has left out the pollard  willows, says another censor, and the lines of pollard willow are the  prominent feature in the valley of the Colne, even more so than the  \"hedgerow elms.\" Does the line \"Walk the studious cloister's pale,\"  _mean_ St. Paul's or Westminster Abbey? When these things can continue  to be asked, it is hardly superfluous to continue to repeat, that  truth of fact and poetical truth are two different things. Milton's  attitude towards nature is not that of a \"descriptive poet\", if indeed  the phrase be not a self-contradiction.    In Milton, nature is not put forward as the poet's theme. His theme  is man, in the two contrasted moods of joyous emotion, or grave  reflection. The shifting scenery ministers to the varying mood.  Thomson, in the _Seasons_ (1726), sets himself to render natural  phenomena as they truly are. He has left us a vivid presentation in  gorgeous language of the naturalistic calendar of the changing year.  Milton, in these two idylls, has recorded a day of twenty-four  hours. But he has not registered the phenomena; he places us at the  standpoint of the man before whom they deploy. And the man, joyous  or melancholy, is not a bare spectator of them; he is the student,  compounded of sensibility and intelligence, of whom we are not told  that he saw so and so, or that he felt so, but with whom we are  made copartners of his thoughts and feeling. Description melts into  emotion, and contemplation bodies itself in imagery. All the charm of  rural life is there, but it is not tendered to us in the form of a  landscape; the scenery is subordinated to the human figure in the  centre.    These two short idylls are marked by a gladsome spontaneity which  never came to Milton again. The delicate fancy and feeling which play  about _L'Allegro_ and _Il Penseroso_ never reappear, and form a strong  contrast to the austere imaginings of his later poetical period. These  two poems have the freedom and frolic, the natural grace of movement,  the improvisation, of the best Elizabethan examples, while both  thoughts and words are under a strict economy unknown to the diffuse  exuberance of the Spenserians.    In _Lycidas_ (1637) we have reached the high-water mark of English  Poesy and of Milton's own production. A period of a century and a half  was to elapse before poetry in England seemed, in Wordsworth's _Ode  on Immortality_ (1807), to be "]]]
