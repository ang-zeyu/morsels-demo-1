Men call me Robin Hood.\"    \"The saints forefend that you should treat me ill!\" said the butcher in  terror. \"Oft have I heard of you, and how you lighten the purses of the  fat priests and knights. But I am naught but a poor butcher, selling  this load of meat, perchance, for enough to pay my quarter's rent.\"    \"Rest you, my friend, rest you,\" quoth Robin, \"not so much as a silver  penny would I take from you, for I love an honest Saxon face and a fair  name with my neighbors. But I would strike a bargain with you.\"    Here he took from his girdle a well-filled purse, and continued, \"I  would fain be a butcher, this day, and sell meat at Nottingham town.  Could you sell me your meat, your cart, your mare, and your good-will,  without loss, for five marks?\"    \"Heaven bless ye, good Robin,\" cried the butcher right joyfully, \"that  can I!\" And he leaped down forthwith from the cart, and handed Robin the  reins in exchange for the purse.    \"One moment more,\" laughed Robin, \"we must e'en change garments for the  nonce. Take mine and scurry home quickly lest the King's Foresters try  to put a hole through this Lincoln green.\"    So saying he donned the butcher's blouse and apron, and, climbing into  the cart, drove merrily down the road to the town.    When he came to Nottingham he greeted the scowling gate-keeper blithely  and proceeded to the market-place. Boldly he led his shuffling horse to  the place where the butchers had their stalls.    He had no notion of the price to ask for his meat, but put on a foolish  and simple air as he called aloud his wares:         \"Hark ye, lasses and dames, hark ye,       Good meat come buy, come buy,       Three pen'orths go for one penny,       And a kiss is good, say I!\"    Now when the folk found what a simple butcher he was, they crowded  around his cart; for he really did sell three times as much for one  penny as was sold by the other butchers. And one or two serving-lasses  with twinkling eyes liked his comely face so well that they willingly  gave boot of a kiss.    But the other butchers were wroth when they found how he was taking  their trade; and they accordingly put their heads together.    One said, \"He is a prodigal and has sold his father's land, and this is  his first venture in trading.\"    Another said, \"He is a thief who has murdered a butcher, and stolen his  horse and meat.\"    Robin heard these sayings, but only laughed merrily and sang his song  the louder. His good-humor made the people laugh also and crowd round  his cart closely, shouting uproariously when some buxom lass submitted  to be kissed.    Then the butchers saw that they must meet craft with craft; and they  said to him, \"Come, brother butcher, if you would sell meat with us, you  must e'en join our guild and stand by the rules of our trade.\"    \"We dine at the Sheriff's mansion to-day,\" said another, \"and you must  take one of our party.\"         \"Accurst of his heart,\" said jolly Robin,       \"That a butcher will deny.       I'll go with you, my brethren true,       And as fast as I can hie.\"    Whereupon, having sold all his meat, he left his horse and cart in  charge of a friendly hostler and prepared to follow his mates to the  Mansion House.    It was the Sheriff's custom to dine various guilds of the trade, from  time to time, on Fair days, for he got a pretty profit out of the fees  they paid him for the right to trade in the market-place. The Sheriff  was already come with great pomp into the banqueting room, when Robin  Hood and three or four butchers entered, and he greeted them all with  great condescension; and presently the whole of a large company was  seated at a table groaning beneath the good cheer of the feast.    Now the Sheriff bade Robin sit by his right hand, at the head of the  board; for one or two butchers had whispered to the official, \"That  fellow is a right mad blade, who yet made us much sport to-day. He sold  more meat for one penny than we could sell for three; and he gave extra  weight to whatsoever lass would buss him.\" And others said, \"He is  some prodigal who knows not the value of goods, and may be plucked by a  shrewd man right closely.\"    The Sheriff was will to pluck a prodigal with the next man, and he was  moreover glad to have a guest who promised to enliven the feast. So, as  I have told you, he placed Robin by his side, and he made much of him  and laughed boisterously at his jests; though sooth to say, the laugh  were come by easily, for Robin had never been in merrier mood, and his  quips and jests soon put the whole table at a roar.    Then my lord Bishop of Hereford came in, last of all, to say a ponderous  grace and take his seat on the other side of the Sheriff--the prelate's  fat body showing up in goodly contrast to the other's lean bones.    After grace was said, and while the servants clattered in with the meat  platters, Robin stood up and said:    \"An amen say I to my lord Bishop's thanks! How, now, my fine fellows, be  merry and drink deep; for the shot I'll pay ere I go my way, though it  cost me five pounds and more. So my lords and gentlemen all, spare not  the wine, but fall to lustily.\"    \"Hear! hear!\" shouted the butchers.    \"Now are you a right jolly soul,\" quoth the Sheriff, \"but this feast is  mine own. Howbeit you must have many a head of horned beasts, and many  an acre of broad land, to spend from your purse so freely.\"    \"Aye, that have I,\" returned Robin, his eyes all a twinkle, \"five  hundred horned beasts have I and my brothers, and none of them have we  been able to sell. That is why I have turned butcher. But I know not the  trade, and would gladly sell the whole herd, an I could find a buyer.\"    At this, the Sheriff's greed 'gan to rise. Since this fool _would_ be  plucked, thought he, why should not he do the plucking?    \"Five hundred beasts, say you?\" he queried sharply.    \"Five hundred and ten fat beasts by actual count, that I would sell for  a just figure. Aye, to him who will pay me in right money, would I sell  them for twenty pieces of gold. Is that too much to ask, lording?\"    Was there ever such an idiot butcher? thought the Sheriff; and he so far  forgot his dignity as to nudge the Bishop in his fat ribs.    \"Nay, good fellow,\" quoth he chuckling, \"I am always ready to help  any in my shire. An you cannot find a buyer for your herd at this just  figure, I will e'en buy them myself.\"    At this generosity Robin was quite overcome, and fell to praising the  Sheriff to the skies, and telling him that he should not have cause to  forget the kindness.    \"Tut, tut,\" said the Sheriff, \"'tis naught but a trade. Drive in your  herd tomorrow to the market-place and you shall have money down.\"    \"Nay, excellence,\" said Robin, \"that can I not easily do, for they are  grazing in scattered fashion. But they are over near Gamewell, not more  than a mile therefrom at most. Will you not come and choose your own  beasts tomorrow?\"    \"Aye, that I will,\" said the Sheriff, his cupidity casting his caution  to the winds. \"Tarry with me over night, and I will go with you in the  morning.\"    This was a poser for Robin, since he liked not the idea of staying over  night at the Sheriff's house. He had hoped to appoint a meeting-place  for the other, but now saw that this might excite doubt. He looked  around at the company. By this time, you must know, the feast had  progressed far, and the butchers were deep in their cups. The Sheriff  and Robin had talked in a low voice, and my lord Bishop was almost  asleep.    \"Agreed,\" said Robin presently, and the words were no sooner out of his  mouth than the door opened and a serving-man entered bearing tray of  mulled wine. At sight of the fellow's face, Robin gave an involuntary  start of surprise which was instantly checked. The other also saw him,  stood still a moment, and as if forgetting something turned about and  left the hall.    It was Little John.    A dozen questions flashed across Robin's mind, and he could find answer  for none of them. What was Little John doing in the Sheriff's house? Why  had he not told the band? Was he true to them? Would he betray him?    But these questions of distrust were dismissed from Robin's open mind  as soon as they had entered. He knew that Little John was faithful and  true.    He recovered his spirits and began again upon a vein of foolish banter,  for the amusement of the Sheriff and his guests, all being now merry  with wine.    \"A song!\" one of them shouted, and the cry was taken up round the table.  Robin mounted his chair and trolled forth:         \"A lass and a butcher of Nottingham       Agreed 'twixt them for to wed.       Says he, 'I'll give ye the meat, fair dame,       And ye will give me the bread.\"    Then they joined in the chorus amid a pounding of cups upon the board:         \"With a hey and a ho       And a hey nonny no,       A butcher of Nottingham!\"    While the song was at its height, Little John reappeared, with other  servants, and refilled the cups. He came up to Robin and, as if asking  him if he would have more wine, said softly, \"Meet me in the pantry  to-night.\"    Robin nodded, and sang loudly. The day was already far spent, and  presently the company broke up with many hiccupy bows of the Sheriff and  little notice of the drowsy Bishop.    When the company was dispersed, the Sheriff bade a servant show Robin to  his room, and promised to see him at breakfast the next day.    Robin kept his word and met Little John that night, and the sheriff next  day; but Little John has been doing so much in the meantime that he must  be allowed a chapter to himself.    So let us turn to another story that was sung of, in the ballads of  olden time, and find out how Little John entered the Sheriff's service.          CHAPTER IV    HOW LITTLE JOHN ENTERED THE SHERIFF'S"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/836"],[0,"The Phoenix and the Carpet (#5)"],[1,"'t know where they might be going, and it makes people stare if you  go out of doors in November in pinafores and without hats.    Then Robert gently awoke the Phoenix, who yawned and stretched itself,  and allowed Robert to lift it on to the middle of the carpet, where it  instantly went to sleep again with its crested head tucked under its  golden wing as before. Then every one sat down on the carpet.    'Where shall we go?' was of course the question, and it was warmly  discussed. Anthea wanted to go to Japan. Robert and Cyril voted for  America, and Jane wished to go to the seaside.    'Because there are donkeys there,' said she.    'Not in November, silly,' said Cyril; and the discussion got warmer and  warmer, and still nothing was settled.    'I vote we let the Phoenix decide,' said Robert, at last. So they  stroked it till it woke. 'We want to go somewhere abroad,' they said,  'and we can't make up our minds where.'    'Let the carpet make up ITS mind, if it has one,' said the Phoenix.    'Just say you wish to go abroad.'    So they did; and the next moment the world seemed to spin upside down,  and when it was right way up again and they were ungiddy enough to look  about them, they were out of doors.    Out of doors--this is a feeble way to express where they were. They  were out of--out of the earth, or off it. In fact, they were floating  steadily, safely, splendidly, in the crisp clear air, with the pale  bright blue of the sky above them, and far down below the pale bright  sun-diamonded waves of the sea. The carpet had stiffened itself somehow,  so that it was square and firm like a raft, and it steered itself so  beautifully and kept on its way so flat and fearless that no one was at  all afraid of tumbling off. In front of them lay land.    'The coast of France,' said the Phoenix, waking up and pointing with  its wing. 'Where do you wish to go? I should always keep one wish, of  course--for emergencies--otherwise you may get into an emergency from  which you can't emerge at all.'    But the children were far too deeply interested to listen.    'I tell you what,' said Cyril: 'let's let the thing go on and on, and  when we see a place we really want to stop at--why, we'll just stop.  Isn't this ripping?'    'It's like trains,' said Anthea, as they swept over the low-lying  coast-line and held a steady course above orderly fields and straight  roads bordered with poplar trees--'like express trains, only in trains  you never can see anything because of grown-ups wanting the windows  shut; and then they breathe on them, and it's like ground glass, and  nobody can see anything, and then they go to sleep.'    'It's like tobogganing,' said Robert, 'so fast and smooth, only there's  no door-mat to stop short on--it goes on and on.'    'You darling Phoenix,' said Jane, 'it's all your doing. Oh, look at  that ducky little church and the women with flappy cappy things on their  heads.'    'Don't mention it,' said the Phoenix, with sleepy politeness.    'OH!' said Cyril, summing up all the rapture that was in every heart.  'Look at it all--look at it--and think of the Kentish Town Road!'    Every one looked and every one thought. And the glorious, gliding,  smooth, steady rush went on, and they looked down on strange and  beautiful things, and held their breath and let it go in deep sighs, and  said 'Oh!' and 'Ah!' till it was long past dinner-time.    It was Jane who suddenly said, 'I wish we'd brought that jam tart and  cold mutton with us. It would have been jolly to have a picnic in the  air.'    The jam tart and cold mutton were, however, far away, sitting quietly in  the larder of the house in Camden Town which the children were supposed  to be keeping. A mouse was at that moment tasting the outside of the  raspberry jam part of the tart (she had nibbled a sort of gulf, or bay,  through the pastry edge) to see whether it was the sort of dinner she  could ask her little mouse-husband to sit down to. She had had a very  good dinner herself. It is an ill wind that blows nobody any good.    'We'll stop as soon as we see a nice place,' said Anthea. 'I've got  threepence, and you boys have the fourpence each that your trams didn't  cost the other day, so we can buy things to eat. I expect the Phoenix  can speak French.'    The carpet was sailing along over rocks and rivers and trees and towns  and farms and fields. It reminded everybody of a certain time when all  of them had had wings, and had flown up to the top of a church tower,  and had had a feast there of chicken and tongue and new bread and  soda-water. And this again reminded them how hungry they were. And just  as they were all being reminded of this very strongly indeed, they saw  ahead of them some ruined walls on a hill, and strong and upright, and  really, to look at, as good as new--a great square tower.    'The top of that's just the exactly same size as the carpet,' said Jane.  '_I_ think it would be good to go to the top of that, because then none  of the Abby-what's-its-names--I mean natives--would be able to take the  carpet away even if they wanted to. And some of us could go out and get  things to eat--buy them honestly, I mean, not take them out of larder  windows.'    'I think it would be better if we went--' Anthea was beginning; but Jane  suddenly clenched her hands.    'I don't see why I should never do anything I want, just because I'm  the youngest. I wish the carpet would fit itself in at the top of that  tower--so there!'    The carpet made a disconcerting bound, and next moment it was hovering  above the square top of the tower. Then slowly and carefully it began to  sink under them. It was like a lift going down with you at the Army and  Navy Stores.    'I don't think we ought to wish things without all agreeing to them  first,' said Robert, huffishly. 'Hullo! What on earth?'    For unexpectedly and greyly something was coming up all round the four  sides of the carpet. It was as if a wall were being built by magic  quickness. It was a foot high--it was two feet high--three, four, five.  It was shutting out the light--more and more.    Anthea looked up at the sky and the walls that now rose six feet above  them.    'We're dropping into the tower,' she screamed. 'THERE WASN'T ANY TOP TO  IT. So the carpet's going to fit itself in at the bottom.'    Robert sprang to his feet.    'We ought to have--Hullo! an owl's nest.' He put his knee on a jutting  smooth piece of grey stone, and reached his hand into a deep window  slit--broad to the inside of the tower, and narrowing like a funnel to  the outside.    'Look sharp!' cried every one, but Robert did not look sharp enough. By  the time he had drawn his hand out of the owl's nest--there were no eggs  there--the carpet had sunk eight feet below him.    'Jump, you silly cuckoo!' cried Cyril, with brotherly anxiety.    But Robert couldn't turn round all in a minute into a jumping position.  He wriggled and twisted and got on to the broad ledge, and by the time  he was ready to jump the walls of the tower had risen up thirty feet  above the others, who were still sinking with the carpet, and Robert  found himself in the embrasure of a window; alone, for even the owls  were not at home that day. The wall was smoothish; there was no climbing  up, and as for climbing down--Robert hid his face in his hands, and  squirmed back and back from the giddy verge, until the back part of him  was wedged quite tight in the narrowest part of the window slit.    He was safe now, of course, but the outside part of his window was like  a frame to a picture of part of the other side of the tower. It was very  pretty, with moss growing between the stones and little shiny gems; but  between him and it there was the width of the tower, and nothing in it  but empty air. The situation was terrible. Robert saw in a flash that  the carpet was likely to bring them into just the same sort of tight  places that they used to get into with the wishes the Psammead granted  them.    And the others--imagine their feelings as the carpet sank slowly and  steadily to the very bottom of the tower, leaving Robert clinging to the  wall. Robert did not even try to imagine their feelings--he had quite  enough to do with his own; but you can.    As soon as the carpet came to a stop on the ground at the bottom of the  inside of the tower it suddenly lost that raft-like stiffness which had  been such a comfort during the journey from Camden Town to the topless  tower, and spread itself limply over the loose stones and little earthy  mounds at the bottom of the tower, just exactly like any ordinary  carpet. Also it shrank suddenly, so that it seemed to draw away from  under their feet, and they stepped quickly off the edges and stood on  the firm ground, while the carpet drew itself in till it was its proper  size, and no longer fitted exactly into the inside of the tower, but  left quite a big space all round it.    Then across the carpet they looked at each other, and then every chin  was tilted up and every eye sought vainly to see where poor Robert had  got to. Of course, they couldn't see him.    'I wish we hadn't come,' said Jane.    'You always do,' said Cyril, briefly. 'Look here, we can't leave Robert  up there. I wish the carpet would fetch him down.'    The carpet seemed to awake from a dream and pull itself together. It  stiffened itself briskly and floated up between the four walls of the  tower. The children below craned their heads back, and nearly broke  their necks in doing it. The carpet rose and rose. It hung poised darkly  above them for an anxious moment or two; then it dropped down again,  threw itself on the uneven floor of the tower, and as it did so it  tumbled Robert out on the uneven floor of the tower.    'Oh, glory!' said Robert, 'that was a squeak. You don't know how I felt.  I say, I've had about enough for a bit. Let's wish ourselves at home  again and have a go at that jam tart and mutton. We"]]]
