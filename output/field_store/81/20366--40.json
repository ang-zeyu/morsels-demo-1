He did not want to see Fenn plunging into any more strife with the  authorities this term.    \"Think of the crowned heads who are coming to hear you,\" pleaded Jimmy  Silver. \"Think of the nobility and gentry. Think of me. You must  play.\"    \"Ah, there you are, Fenn.\"    Mr Kay had bustled in in his energetic way.    Fenn said nothing. He _was_ there. It was idle to deny it.    \"I thought I should find you here. Yes, I wanted to see you about the  concert tonight. Mr Mulholland has met with an unfortunate accident,  and I am looking after the entertainment in his place. Come with me  and play over your piece. I should like to see that you are perfect in  it. Dear me, dear me, what a noise those boys are making. Why  _are_ they behaving in that extraordinary way, I wonder!\"    Kay's juniors had left the pavilion, and were trooping back to their  house. At the present moment they were passing the school shop, and  their tuneful voices floated in through the open window.    \"This is very unusual. Why, they seem to be boys in my house. They are  groaning.\"    \"I think they are a little upset at the result of the match, sir,\"  said Jimmy Silver suavely. \"Fenn did not arrive, for some reason, till  the end of the innings, so Mr Blackburn's won. The wicket was good,  but a little fiery.\"    \"Thank you, Silver,\" replied Mr Kay with asperity. \"When I require  explanations I will ask for them.\"    He darted out of the shop, and a moment later they heard him pouring  out a flood of recriminations on the groaning fags.    \"There was _once_ a man who snubbed me,\" said Jimmy Silver. \"They  buried him at Brookwood. Well, what are you going to do, Fenn? Going  to play tonight? Harkee, boy. Say but the word, and I will beard this  tyrant to his face.\"    Fenn rose.    \"Yes,\" he said briefly, \"I shall play. You'd better turn up. I think  you'll enjoy it.\"    Silver said that no human power should keep him away.           *       *       *       *       *    The School concert was always one of the events of the summer term.  There was a concert at the end of the winter term, too, but it was not  so important. To a great many of those present the summer concert  marked, as it were, the last flutter of their school life. On the  morrow they would be Old Boys, and it behoved them to extract as much  enjoyment from the function as they could. Under Mr Mullholland's rule  the concert had become a very flourishing institution. He aimed at a  high standard, and reached it. There was more than a touch of the  austere about the music. A glance at the programme was enough to show  the lover of airs of the trashy, clashy order that this was no place  for him. Most of the items were serious. When it was thought necessary  to introduce a lighter touch, some staidly rollicking number was  inserted, some song that was saved--in spite of a catchy tune--by a  halo of antiquity. Anything modern was taboo, unless it were the work  of Gotsuchakoff, Thingummyowsky, or some other eminent foreigner.  Foreign origin made it just possible.    The school prefects lurked during the performance at the doors and at  the foot of the broad stone steps that led to the Great Hall. It was  their duty to supply visitors with programmes.    Jimmy Silver had foregathered with Kennedy, Challis, and Williams at  the junior door. The hall was full now, and their labours consequently  at an end.    \"Pretty good 'gate',\" said Silver, looking in through the open door.  \"It must be warm up in the gallery.\"    Across the further end of the hall a dais had been erected. On this  the bulk of the school sat, leaving the body of the hall to the  crowned heads, nobility, and gentry to whom Silver had referred in his  conversation with Fenn.    \"It always is warm in the gallery,\" said Challis. \"I lost about two  stone there every concert when I was a kid. We simply used to sit and  melt.\"    \"And I tell you what,\" broke in Silver, \"it's going to get warmer  before the end of the show. Do you notice that all Kay's house are  sitting in a lump at the back. I bet they're simply spoiling for a  row. Especially now Kay's running the concert. There's going to be a  hot time in the old town tonight--you see if there isn't. Hark at  'em.\"    The choir had just come to the end of a little thing of Handel's.  There was no reason to suppose that the gallery appreciated Handel.  Nevertheless, they were making a deafening noise. Clouds of dust rose  from the rhythmical stamping of many feet. The noise was loudest and  the dust thickest by the big window, beneath which sat the men from  Kay's. Things were warming up.    The gallery, with one last stamp which nearly caused the dais to  collapse, quieted down. The masters in the audience looked serious.  One or two of the visitors glanced over their shoulders with a smile.  How excited the dear boys were at the prospect of holidays! Young  blood! Young blood! Boys _would_ be boys.    The concert continued. Half-way through the programme there was a ten  minutes' interval. Fenn's pianoforte solo was the second item of the  second half.    He mounted the platform amidst howls of delight from the gallery.  Applause at the Eckleton concerts was granted more for services in the  playing-fields than merit as a musician. Kubelik or Paderewski would  have been welcomed with a few polite handclaps. A man in the eleven or  fifteen was certain of two minutes' unceasing cheers.    \"Evidently one of their heroes, my dear,\" said Paterfamilias to  Materfamilias. \"I suppose he has won a scholarship at the University.\"    Paterfamilias' mind was accustomed to run somewhat upon scholarships  at the University. What the school wanted was a batting average of  forty odd or a bowling analysis in single figures.    Fenn played the \"Moonlight Sonata\". A trained musical critic would  probably have found much to cavil at in his rendering of the piece,  but it was undoubtedly good for a public school player. Of course he  was encored. The gallery would have encored him if he had played with  one finger, three mistakes to every bar.    \"I told Fenn,\" said Jimmy Silver, \"if he got an encore, that he ought  to play the--My aunt! _He is!_\"    Three runs and half-a-dozen crashes, and there was no further room for  doubt. Fenn was playing the \"Coon Band Contest\".    \"He's gone mad,\" gasped Kennedy.    Whether he had or not, it is certain that the gallery had. All the  evening they had been stewing in an atmosphere like that of the inner  room of a Turkish bath, and they were ready for anything. It needed  but a trifle to set them off. The lilt of that unspeakable Yankee  melody supplied that trifle. Kay's malcontents, huddled in their seats  by the window, were the first to break out. Feet began to stamp in  time to the music--softly at first, then more loudly. The wooden dais  gave out the sound like a drum.    Other rioters joined in from the right. The noise spread through the  gallery as a fire spreads through gorse. Soon three hundred pairs of  well-shod feet were rising and falling. Somebody began to whistle.  Everybody whistled. Mr Kay was on his feet, gesticulating wildly. His  words were lost in the uproar.    For five minutes the din prevailed. Then, with a final crash, Fenn  finished. He got up from the music-stool, bowed, and walked back to  his place by the senior door. The musical efforts of the gallery  changed to a storm of cheering and clapping.    The choir rose to begin the next piece.    Still the noise continued.    People began to leave the Hall--in ones and twos first, then in a  steady stream which blocked the doorways. It was plain to the dullest  intelligence that if there was going to be any more concert, it would  have to be performed in dumb show. Mr Kay flung down his baton.    The visitors had left by now, and the gallery was beginning to follow  their example, howling as it went.    \"Well,\" said Jimmy Silver cheerfully, as he went with Kennedy down the  steps, \"I _think_ we may call that a record. By my halidom,  there'll be a row about this later on.\"          V    CAMP      With the best intentions in the world, however, a headmaster cannot  make a row about a thing unless he is given a reasonable amount of  time to make it in. The concert being on the last evening of term,  there was only a single morning before the summer holidays, and that  morning was occupied with the prize-giving. The school assembled at  ten o'clock with a shadowy hope that this prize-day would be more  exciting than the general run of prize-days, but they were  disappointed. The function passed off without sensation. The  headmaster did not denounce the school in an impassioned speech from  the dais. He did not refer to the events of the previous evening. At  the same time, his demeanour was far from jovial. It lacked that  rollicking bonhomie which we like to see in headmasters on prize-day.  It was evident to the most casual observer that the affair was not  closed. The school would have to pay the bill sooner or later. But  eight weeks would elapse before the day of reckoning, which was a  comforting thought.    The last prize was handed over to its rightful owner. The last and  dullest vote of thanks had been proposed by the last and dullest  member of the board of governors. The Bishop of Rumtifoo (who had been  selected this year to distribute the prizes) had worked off his  seventy minutes' speech (inaudible, of course, as usual), and was  feeling much easier. The term had been formally declared at an end,  and those members of the school corps who were going to camp were  beginning to assemble in front of the buildings.    \"I wonder why it always takes about three hours to get us off to the  station,\" said Jimmy Silver. \"I've been to camp two years now, and  there's always been this rotting about in the grounds before we start.  Nobody's likely to turn up to inspect us for the next hour or so. If  any gent cares to put in a modest"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6879"],[0,"The Gold Bat (#5)"],[1,"appearance in higher football circles than one is accustomed to,  Barry did well against the scratch team--certainly far better than  Rand-Brown had done. His smallness was, of course, against him, and, on  the only occasion on which he really got away, Paget overtook him and  brought him down. But then Paget was exceptionally fast. In the two  most important branches of the game, the taking of passes and tackling,  Barry did well. As far as pluck went he had enough for two, and when  the whistle blew for no-side he had not let Paget through once, and  Trevor felt that his inclusion in the team had been justified. There  was another scratch game on the Saturday. Barry played in it, and did  much better. Paget had gone away by an early train, and the man he had  to mark now was one of the masters, who had been good in his time, but  was getting a trifle old for football. Barry scored twice, and on one  occasion, by passing back to Trevor after the manner of Paget, enabled  the captain to run in. And Trevor, like the captain in _Billy  Taylor_, \"werry much approved of what he'd done.\" Barry began to be  regarded in the school as a regular member of the fifteen. The first of  the fixture-card matches, versus the Town, was due on the following  Saturday, and it was generally expected that he would play. M'Todd's  devotion increased every day. He even went to the length of taking long  runs with him. And if there was one thing in the world that M'Todd  loathed, it was a long run.    On the Thursday before the match against the Town, Clowes came  chuckling to Trevor's study after preparation, and asked him if he had  heard the latest.    \"Have you ever heard of the League?\" he said.    Trevor pondered.    \"I don't think so,\" he replied.    \"How long have you been at the school?\"    \"Let's see. It'll be five years at the end of the summer term.\"    \"Ah, then you wouldn't remember. I've been here a couple of terms  longer than you, and the row about the League was in my first term.\"    \"What was the row?\"    \"Oh, only some chaps formed a sort of secret society in the place. Kind  of Vehmgericht, you know. If they got their knife into any one, he  usually got beans, and could never find out where they came from. At  first, as a matter of fact, the thing was quite a philanthropical  concern. There used to be a good deal of bullying in the place then--at  least, in some of the houses--and, as the prefects couldn't or wouldn't  stop it, some fellows started this League.\"    \"Did it work?\"    \"Work! By Jove, I should think it did. Chaps who previously couldn't  get through the day without making some wretched kid's life not worth  living used to go about as nervous as cats, looking over their  shoulders every other second. There was one man in particular, a chap  called Leigh. He was hauled out of bed one night, blindfolded, and  ducked in a cold bath. He was in the School House.\"    \"Why did the League bust up?\"    \"Well, partly because the fellows left, but chiefly because they didn't  stick to the philanthropist idea. If anybody did anything they didn't  like, they used to go for him. At last they put their foot into it  badly. A chap called Robinson--in this house by the way--offended them  in some way, and one morning he was found tied up in the bath, up to  his neck in cold water. Apparently he'd been there about an hour. He  got pneumonia, and almost died, and then the authorities began to get  going. Robinson thought he had recognised the voice of one of the  chaps--I forget his name. The chap was had up by the Old Man, and gave  the show away entirely. About a dozen fellows were sacked, clean off  the reel. Since then the thing has been dropped.\"    \"But what about it? What were you going to say when you came in?\"    \"Why, it's been revived!\"    \"Rot!\"    \"It's a fact. Do you know Mill, a prefect, in Seymour's?\"    \"Only by sight.\"    \"I met him just now. He's in a raving condition. His study's been  wrecked. You never saw such a sight. Everything upside down or smashed.  He has been showing me the ruins.\"    \"I believe Mill is awfully barred in Seymour's,\" said Trevor. \"Anybody  might have ragged his study.\"    \"That's just what I thought. He's just the sort of man the League used  to go for.\"    \"That doesn't prove that it's been revived, all the same,\" objected  Trevor.    \"No, friend; but this does. Mill found it tied to a chair.\"    It was a small card. It looked like an ordinary visiting card. On it,  in neat print, were the words, \"_With the compliments of the  League_\".    \"That's exactly the same sort of card as they used to use,\" said  Clowes. \"I've seen some of them. What do you think of that?\"    \"I think whoever has started the thing is a pretty average-sized idiot.  He's bound to get caught some time or other, and then out he goes. The  Old Man wouldn't think twice about sacking a chap of that sort.\"    \"A chap of that sort,\" said Clowes, \"will take jolly good care he isn't  caught. But it's rather sport, isn't it?\"    And he went off to his study.    Next day there was further evidence that the League was an actual going  concern. When Trevor came down to breakfast, he found a letter by his  plate. It was printed, as the card had been. It was signed \"The  President of the League.\" And the purport of it was that the League did  not wish Barry to continue to play for the first fifteen.          V    MILL RECEIVES VISITORS      Trevor's first idea was that somebody had sent the letter for a  joke,--Clowes for choice.    He sounded him on the subject after breakfast.    \"Did you send me that letter?\" he inquired, when Clowes came into his  study to borrow a _Sportsman_.    \"What letter? Did you send the team for tomorrow up to the sporter? I  wonder what sort of a lot the Town are bringing.\"    \"About not giving Barry his footer colours?\"    Clowes was reading the paper.    \"Giving whom?\" he asked.    \"Barry. Can't you listen?\"    \"Giving him what?\"    \"Footer colours.\"    \"What about them?\"    Trevor sprang at the paper, and tore it away from him. After which he  sat on the fragments.    \"Did you send me a letter about not giving Barry his footer colours?\"    Clowes surveyed him with the air of a nurse to whom the family baby has  just said some more than usually good thing.    \"Don't stop,\" he said, \"I could listen all day.\"    Trevor felt in his pocket for the note, and flung it at him. Clowes  picked it up, and read it gravely.    \"What _are_ footer colours?\" he asked.    \"Well,\" said Trevor, \"it's a pretty rotten sort of joke, whoever sent  it. You haven't said yet whether you did or not.\"    \"What earthly reason should I have for sending it? And I think you're  making a mistake if you think this is meant as a joke.\"    \"You don't really believe this League rot?\"    \"You didn't see Mill's study 'after treatment'. I did. Anyhow, how do  you account for the card I showed you?\"    \"But that sort of thing doesn't happen at school.\"    \"Well, it _has_ happened, you see.\"    \"Who do you think did send the letter, then?\"    \"The President of the League.\"    \"And who the dickens is the President of the League when he's at home?\"    \"If I knew that, I should tell Mill, and earn his blessing. Not that I  want it.\"    \"Then, I suppose,\" snorted Trevor, \"you'd suggest that on the strength  of this letter I'd better leave Barry out of the team?\"    \"Satirically in brackets,\" commented Clowes.    \"It's no good your jumping on _me_,\" he added. \"I've done nothing.  All I suggest is that you'd better keep more or less of a look-out. If  this League's anything like the old one, you'll find they've all sorts  of ways of getting at people they don't love. I shouldn't like to come  down for a bath some morning, and find you already in possession, tied  up like Robinson. When they found Robinson, he was quite blue both as  to the face and speech. He didn't speak very clearly, but what one  could catch was well worth hearing. I should advise you to sleep with a  loaded revolver under your pillow.\"    \"The first thing I shall do is find out who wrote this letter.\"    \"I should,\" said Clowes, encouragingly. \"Keep moving.\"    In Seymour's house the Mill's study incident formed the only theme of  conversation that morning. Previously the sudden elevation to the first  fifteen of Barry, who was popular in the house, at the expense of  Rand-Brown, who was unpopular, had given Seymour's something to talk  about. But the ragging of the study put this topic entirely in the shade.  The study was still on view in almost its original condition of disorder,  and all day comparative strangers flocked to see Mill in his den, in  order to inspect things. Mill was a youth with few friends, and it is  probable that more of his fellow-Seymourites crossed the threshold of  his study on the day after the occurrence than had visited him in the  entire course of his school career. Brown would come in to borrow a  knife, would sweep the room with one comprehensive glance, and depart,  to be followed at brief intervals by Smith, Robinson, and Jones, who  came respectively to learn the right time, to borrow a book, and to ask  him if he had seen a pencil anywhere. Towards the end of the day, Mill  would seem to have wearied somewhat of the proceedings, as was proved  when Master Thomas Renford, aged fourteen (who fagged for Milton, the  head of the house), burst in on the thin pretence that he had mistaken  the study for that of his rightful master, and gave vent to a prolonged  whistle of surprise and satisfaction at the sight of the ruins. On  that occasion, the incensed owner of the dismantled study, taking a  mean advantage of the fact that he was a prefect, and so entitled to  wield the rod, produced a handy swagger-stick from an adjacent corner,  and, inviting Master Renford to bend over, gave him six of the best to  remember him by. Which ceremony being concluded, he kicked him out into  the passage, and Renford went down to the"]]]
