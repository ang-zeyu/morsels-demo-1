I can conceive of no  form of big game hunting so conducive to great mental excitement  and physical activity as walrus hunting from an open whale-boat.  At the completion of such a hunt I have seen Eskimo so excited and  worked up that they were taken violently sick with vomiting and  headache.    \"The walrus is a gregarious animal, confederating in herds  numbering from ten to fifty, and in some instances no doubt larger  numbers may be found together. On calm days they rest in  unmolested peace on pans of broken ice which drift up and down the  waters of Whale Sound. It is unfortunate that no soundings were  taken in the region where the walrus were found, as a knowledge of  the depth of water would have furnished some information as to the  distances to which the animal will dive in search of food.    \"The stomachs of all half- and full-grown walrus taken in Whale  Sound were without exception well filled with freshly opened  clams, with very few fragments of shells in evidence; the removal  of the clam from the shell being as neatly accomplished as though  done by an expert oysterman.    \"In most cases these segregated herds of walrus were in charge of  a large bull who generally occupied a central position in the mass  of animals. Upon approaching such a herd for the first time, and  when within about 200 feet, a large bull would lift his head,  sniff audibly in our direction and give a loud grunt which  apparently struck a responsive chord in the other sleeping  animals. They would grunt in unison, in more subdued tones, after  which the old walrus would drop his head to resume his interrupted  nap. Their contempt for us was somewhat disconcerting.    \"At the first crack of a rifle, however, the animals immediately  aroused, and then during the fusillade which followed there  occurred what might be called an orderly scramble for the water.  In the first place the young ones were hustled to the edge of the  ice-pan, and there, apparently under the protection of the  mother's flipper, pushed into the water, immediately followed by  the mother. The young bulls followed, and I recall no exceptions  where the last animal into the water was not the big bull, who  before diving would give our boat a wicked look and a roar of  rage.    \"The animals would immediately dive, and then we first became  aware of a remarkable phenomenon. We found that when excited they  would continue their roaring under water, and these strange sounds  coming to us from below added considerably to the excitement of  the chase. Although the cows and young animals would generally  swim to places of safety, the other full grown animals would hover  beneath our boat and from time to time come to the surface and  charge. These charges were in all cases repulsed by the discharge  of our rifles in the faces of the animals. The balls, however,  from our .45 calibre carbines would flatten out under the skin on  the massive bony structure of the animal's skull, and cause only a  sort of rage and a sneeze, but it however had the effect of making  them dive again. It is my belief that when enraged the walrus if  not resisted would attack and attempt to destroy a boat. Icquah,  one of our native hunters, showed me in the deck of his kyak two  mended punctures which he told me were made by the tusks of a  walrus that had made an _unprovoked_ attack upon him.    \"On more than one occasion I have seen two strong uninjured  animals come to the assistance of a wounded companion, and swim  away with it to a position of safety, _the injured animal being  supported on both sides_, giving the appearance of three  animals swimming abreast. The first time I witnessed this I did  not comprehend its real meaning, but on another occasion in  McCormick Bay I saw a wounded animal leaving a trail of blood and  oil, supported on either side by two uninjured ones. They were  making a hasty retreat and would occasionally dive together, but  would quickly return to the surface.    \"We found the most effective exposed spot to place a bullet was at  the base of the animal's skull. A walrus instantly killed this way  generally sinks, leaving a trail of blood and oil to mark the  place of his descent. When hunting these animals it is well to  have an Eskimo along with harpoon and line in readiness to make  fast; otherwise one is apt to lose his quarry.    \"In the early winter we usually found the walrus in smaller groups  up in the bays. This was after the ice had begun to make, and in  coming to the surface to breathe the animals found it necessary  to butt their noses against the ice to break it. I have seen this  done in ice at least four inches in thickness. In some instances  I have seen a fractured star in the ice, a record of an unsuccessful  attempt to make a breathing hole.\" Around these breathing holes  we frequently found fragments of clam-shells, sections of  crinoids and sea-anemones. It is evident that after raking the  bottom with his tusks and filling his mouth with food, the walrus  separates the food he desires to retain and rejects on his way up  and at the surface such articles as he has picked up in haste and  does not want.    \"From the fact that the walrus is easily approached it is a simple  matter to kill him with the modern high power rule. It is  therefore to be hoped that future expeditions into the arctic seas  will kill sparingly of these tremendous brutes which from point of  size stand in the foremost rank among mammals.\"    The Elephant, Rhinoceros and Hippopotamus. _Individual  Elephants_ vary in temperament far more than do rhinoceroses  or hippopotami, and the variations are wide. In a wild state,  elephants are quiet and undemonstrative, almost to the point of  dullness. They do not domineer, or hector, or quarrel, save when a  rogue develops in the ranks, and sets out to make things  interesting by the commission of lawless acts. A professional  rogue is about everything that an orthodox elephant should not  be, and he soon makes of himself so great a nuisance that he is  driven out of the herd.    The temperament of the standardized and normal elephant is  distinctly sanguine, _but a nervous or hysterical individual is  easily developed by bad conditions or abuse_. Adult male  elephants are subject to various degrees of what we may as well  call sexual insanity, which is dangerous in direct proportion to  its intensity. This causes many a \"bad\" show elephant to be  presented to a zoological garden, where the dangers of this mental  condition can at least be reduced to their lowest terms. Our  Indian elephant who was known as Gunda was afflicted with sexual  insanity, and he gradually grew worse, and increasingly dangerous  to his keepers, until finally it was necessary to end his troubles  painlessly with a bullet through his brain.    _The Rhinoceros_ is a sanguine animal, of rather dull vision  and slow understanding. In captivity it gives little trouble, and  lives long. Adults individually often become pettish, or peevish,  and threaten to prod their keepers without cause, but I have never  known a keeper to take those lapses seriously. The average rhino  is by no means a dull or a stupid animal, and they have quite  enough life to make themselves interesting to visitors. In British  East Africa a black rhinoceros often trots briskly toward a  caravan, and seems to be charging, when in reality it is only  desiring a \"close-up\" to satisfy its legitimate curiosity.    _Every Hippopotamus_, either Nile or pygmy, is an animal of  serene mind and steady habits. Their appetites work with clock-  like regularity, and require no winding. I can not recall that any  one of our five hippos was ever sick for a day, or missed a meal.  When the idiosyncrasies of Gunda, our bad elephant, were at their  worst, the contemplation of Peter the Great ponderously and  serenely chewing his hay was a rest to tired nerves. Keeper Thuman  treats the four pygmy hippos like so many pet pigs,--save the  solitary adult male, who sets himself up to be peevish. The  breeding female is a wise and good mother, with much more maternal  instinct than our chimpanzee \"Suzette.\"    It may be set down as an absolute rule that hippos are lymphatic,  easy-going, contented, and easy to take care of _provided_  they are kept scrupulously clean, and are fed as they should be  fed. They live long, breed persistently, give no trouble and have  high exhibition value.    _Giraffe_ individuals vary exceedingly,--beyond all other  hoofed animals. Each one has its own headful of notions, and  rarely will two be found quite alike in temperament and views of  life. Some are sanguine and sensible, others are nervous,  crotchety, and full of senseless fears. Those who are responsible  for them in captivity are constantly harassed by fears that they  will stampede in their stalls or yards, and break their own necks  and legs in most unexpected ways. They require greater vigilance  than any other hoofed animals we know. Sometimes a giraffe will  develop foolishness to such a degree as to be unwilling to go out  of its own huge door, into a shady and comfortable yard.          III    THE LANGUAGE OF WILD ANIMALS      Language is the means by which men and animals express their  thoughts. Of language there are four kinds: vocal, pictured,  written and sign language.    Any vocal sound uttered for the purpose of conveying thought, or  influencing thought or action, is to be classed as vocal language.  Among the mammals below man, _speech_ is totally absent; but  parrots, macaws, cockatoos and crows have been taught to imitate  the sound of man's words, or certain simple kinds of music.    The primitive races of mankind first employed the sign language,  and spoken words. After that comes picture language, and lastly  the language of written words. Among the Indians and frontiersmen  of the western United States and Canada, the sign language has  reached what "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60708"],[0,"History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Volume 4 (#5)"],[1,"men; they are only so to bad men who are  breakers of the laws. * * * The lawyers themselves acknowledge that we  have all power granted us in our charters, that we could ask for--that  we had more power than any other court in the State; for all other  courts were restricted while ours was not.\"    Such views in relation to an ordinary municipal government would  unquestionably be stamped as preposterous. No such powers as are here  claimed are accorded to ordinary city governments in Illinois or any  other of the states of the American Union. What then may be said of  the Prophet's claims in respect to the municipal powers of Nauvoo?  Nothing in way of defense, except that Nauvoo was _not_ an ordinary  municipality; that Joseph Smith had sought for extraordinary grants of  power for the city of Nauvoo and had obtained them; that his personal  experiences and the experiences of his people, both in Ohio and  Missouri, had taught him the necessity of having officers charged with  the duty of administering government wherein his people were concerned,  who were friendly disposed and whose interests were largely identical  with those of the Saints: that the things which both the Prophet and  his people had suffered justified both him and them in seeking for  and obtaining such power as had been conferred by charters upon the  city of Nauvoo; that the Prophet was wholly within the lines of right  conduct when he invoked the municipal powers in his own protection  {XXIV} against the aggressions of his old enemies in Missouri and his  new betrayers in Illinois. But whether the legislature of Illinois was  fully aware of the extraordinary powers they were conferring upon the  city of Nauvoo, or being aware of the import of their action the party  in control of the legislature was willing to grant the extraordinary  powers in the hope of currying political favor with the Saints, may not  now be determined; but in any event these extraordinary powers were  granted; and wittingly or unwittingly a \"city-state\" had practically  been established within the state of Illinois. Nothing short of this  descriptive term can adequately set forth the municipal government  of Nauvoo. It seems to be an unconscious reversion. In an incipient  way, to the \"city-states\" or \"city-republics\" of the old Greek  confederations; or the \"free-towns\" of medieval times, when the cities  were more potent than nations in commerce and even in politics. Whether  or not the state courts of Illinois and United States courts would have  sustained the Nauvoo charters if the matter of their validity had been  referred to them for adjudication, may not be determined; but one can  scarcely suppress the thought that the likelihood is that they would  not have been sustained; on the contrary they would have been most  likely declared anomalous to our system of government as it then stood,  and now stands. But certainly if the experiment of such a municipal  government had not been interrupted in its progress, it might have been  an instructive object lesson in the government of cities; and even as  it is, the founding of Nauvoo, the \"city-state,\" suggests an important  idea which may work out great practical reforms in municipal government  in our country.    The founders of our Government dealt with conditions that were very  simple in comparison with the complexity of the conditions which  government in its various forms, municipal, state and national, is  confronted with today. The Municipal problems which now vex the  people had not then arisen above the horizon of their experience. The  American commonwealths of the early decades of the nineteenth century  were practically rural commonwealths. At the time of Washington's  inauguration (1789) the population of New York was but thirty-three  thousand; Philadelphia forty-two thousand; Boston but eighteen  thousand; Baltimore thirteen thousand; Brooklyn one thousand six  hundred, and more village than town. Now compare these cities with  their present population. New York has a population of over four  millions; [6] Philadelphia a population of one and a half millions; [7]  Boston more than half {XXV} a million; [8] Baltimore over five hundred  thousand; [9] Brooklyn is absorbed in New York, but as a borough of  the larger city it has a population of nearly one and a half millions;  [10] Chicago, which in 1840 had but four thousand inhabitants, much  smaller than Nauvoo, has now a population of more than two millions;  [11] St. Louis which in 1840 had a population of but 16,469, has now a  population of three quarters of a million. [12] Nothing like the growth  of urban population within the United States during the last fifty  years has been known in the history of the world, and it has brought to  the inhabitants of these cities problems undreamed of by the founders  of our government. Every year discloses more and more distinctly the  fact that between these condensed communities and the town, village,  and rural population of the states in which they are located, there are  very distinct interests and governmental problems of widely differing  character. The differences which justify distinct local governments  in the state of New York and the peninsula of Florida are not more  insistent than the differences between the great commercial city of New  York and the state of the same name. Without entering upon elaborate  discussion of these questions (a discussion which is foreign to the  character of this writing) I venture the suggestion that separate and  complete state governments for our large cities, or the elevation of  them into what I have called \"city-states,\" such as Nauvoo was, in  an incipient way, will be the solution to most of the problems of  municipal government in our very large cities. It would greatly enlarge  in them the governmental powers essential to their more perfect peace,  security, and prosperity. Also it would separate them from embroilment  in those questions of the state governments under which they are now  located, and in which they have so little interest--often indeed,  there is even sharp conflict of interests, engendering bitterness  and strife which hinders progress for both city and state. Besides,  granting complete statehood to our larger cities would be but a proper  recognition of the right of those great aggregations of citizens with  their varied industries, their immense wealth and distinct interests,  to that measure of influence in our national affairs which their  numbers and intelligence and interests justly demand.    {XXVI} _The Appeal of the Church to the National government for Redress  of Wrongs Suffered in Missouri_.    The Prophet Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon, and Judge Elias Higbee were  chosen as the committee to present to the National Congress the  petition of the Saints for a redress of their grievances, suffered in  Missouri. This journey to the nation's Capital was of importance quite  apart from the immediate purpose for which it was undertaken; namely,  it brought the Prophet in contact with the leading statesmen of the  United States. While in Washington, he was brought in contact with  and interviewed such men as Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun, President  Martin Van Buren, different members of the Cabinet, Senators, and  Representatives. Such contact enabled him to take new measurements,  not only of a different class of men from those with whom he had been  accustomed to associate, but new measurements of himself by comparison  and contrast of himself with those leading spirits of the nation.  Comparisons which could not result otherwise than in advantage to  him; and I think it must be conceded by all students of the Prophet's  character, especially to those who have been at all close observers of  its development, that after this trip to Washington, which afforded the  above noted opportunities of comparison and contrast, the Prophet's  growth was immeasurably greater than at any time before that journey.    In some respects however it was unfortunate that the Prophet was not  more cosmopolitan in his training and in his views of life on the  occasion of this visit to the nation's capital; for lack of such  training and views of life led him to the formation of rather hasty  judgments as to the character of our nation's public men at that time.  He undoubtedly had sticking to him as yet, some of the prejudices of  his New England and New York sectional training; and at the time of  his visit the spirit of the public men of the nation at Washington  was largely influenced by the Southern character and spirit. Bourbon  Democracy was at its height. The gentlemen of the South with their  extreme notions of chivalry and polite deportment, predominated. In  those days men were held to strict account for their manner of address  one to another. An improper word, a slight, magnified into an insult,  meant a challenge to mortal combat on \"the field of honor,\" and this  sense of personal responsibility for utterances begot, no doubt, an  extreme politeness in personal deportment which seemed puerile to  those reared in another atmosphere and influenced by other sentiments  than those which resulted from education in the South. Joseph Smith's  judgment upon manners and customs in Washington, was doubtless New  England's judgment upon Southern customs with which it had no patience,  much less sympathy. It is only from these considerations that the  rather harsh {XXVII} judgment of the Prophet in relation to conditions  in Washington can be properly understood.    Relative to the business upon which this committee visited Washington,  it should be said that Sidney Rigdon failed to participate in it at  all, in consequence of an illness which befell him on his journey,  and hindered him from reaching Washington until the business was  practically settled. A short stay in Washington convinced the Prophet  that nothing was to be expected in the way of "]]]
