[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7386"],[0,"Egyptian Tales, Translated from the Papyri: First series, IVth to XIIth dynasty (#5)"],[1,"adventures.    One reference to a date needs notice. The 25th of the month Tybi is said  to be the predicted birthday of the children; and Khufu refers to going  to Sakhebu about that time apparently, when the banks of the canal are  cut and the land was drying after the inundation, whereon Dedi  threatens that the water shall still be deep there. This points to 25th  Tybi being about the close of the inundation. This would be about  the case both in the beginning of the IVth Dynasty, and also in the  XIIth Dynasty, when the papyrus was perhaps written: hence there is  nothing conclusive to be drawn from this allusion so far. But when we  compare this tale with those following, we see good ground for its  belonging to a time before the XIIth Dynasty The following tale of the  peasant and the workman evidently belongs to the IXth or Xth Dynasties,  when Herakleopolis was the capital, and Sanehat is certainly of the  XIIth Dynasty. Yet in those we see character and incident made the basis  of interest, in place of the childish profusion of marvels of the Tales  of the Magicians. It seems impossible not to suppose that they belong to  very different ages and canons of taste; and hence we cannot refer the  crudities of the Khufu tales to the time of the far more elaborate and  polished recital of the adventures of Sanehat in the XIIth Dynasty.  Being thus obliged to suppose an earlier date for these tales, the  allusion to the month Tybi throws us back to a very early period--the  IVth Dynasty--for their original outlines. Doubtless they were modified  by reciters, and probably took shape in the Vth or VIth Dynasties; but  yet we must regard them as belonging practically to the age to which  they refer.          IN THE SEKHET HEMAT    IXTH DYNASTY          THE PEASANT AND THE WORKMAN      There dwelt in the Sekhet Hemat--or salt country--a peasant called the  Sekhti, with his wife and children, his asses and his dogs; and he  trafficked in all good things of the Sekhet Hemat to Henenseten. Behold  now he went with rushes, natron, and salt, with wood and pods, with  stones and seeds, and all good products of the Sekhet Hemat. And this  Sekhti journeyed to the south unto Henenseten; and when he came to the  lands of the house of Fefa, north of Denat, he found a man there  standing on the bank, a man called Hemti--the workman--son of a man  called Asri, who was a serf of the High Steward Meruitensa. Now said  this Hemti, when he saw the asses of Sekhti, that were pleasing in his  eyes, \"Oh that some good god would grant me to steal away the goods of  Sekhti from him!\"    Now the Hemti's house was by the dyke of the tow-path, which was  straitened, and not wide, as much as the width of a waist cloth: on the  one side of it was the water, and on the other side of it grew his corn.  Hemti said then to his servant, \"Hasten I bring me a shawl from the  house,\" and it was brought instantly. Then spread he out this shawl on  the face of the dyke, and it lay with its fastening on the water and its  fringe on the corn.    Now Sekhti approached along the path used by all men. Said Hemti, \"Have  a care, Sekhti! you are not going to trample on my clothes!\" Said  Sekhti, \"I will do as you like, I will pass carefully.\" Then went he  up on the higher side.  But Hemti said, \"Go you over my corn, instead  of the path?\" Said Sekhti, \"I am going carefully; this high field of  corn is not my choice, but you have stopped your path with your  clothes, and will you then not let us pass by the side of the path?\"  And one of the asses filled its mouth with a cluster of corn. Said  Hemti, \"Look you, I shall take away your ass, Sekhti, for eating my  corn; behold it will have to pay according to the amount of the  injury.\" Said Sekhti, \"I am going carefully; the one way is stopped,  therefore took I my ass by the enclosed ground, and do you seize it  for filling its mouth with a cluster of corn? Moreover, I know unto  whom this domain belongs, even unto the Lord Steward Meruitensa. He it  is who smites every robber in this whole land; and shall I then be  robbed in his domain?\"    Said Hemti, \"This is the proverb which men speak: 'A poor man's name is  only his own matter.' I am he of whom you spake, even the Lord Steward  of whom you think.\" Thereon he took to him branches of green tamarisk  and scourged all his limbs, took his asses, and drave them into the  pasture.  And Sekhti wept very greatly, by reason of the pain of what  he had suffered. Said Hemti, \"Lift not up your voice, Sekhti, or you  shall go to the Demon of Silence.\" Sekhti answered, \"You beat me, you  steal my goods, and now would take away even my voice, O demon of  silence! If you will restore my goods, then will I cease to cry out at  your violence.\"    Sekhti stayed the whole day petitioning Hemti, but he would not give ear  unto him. And Sekhti went his way to Khenensuten to complain to the Lord  Steward Meruitensa. He found him coming out from the door of his house  to embark on his boat, that he might go to the judgment hall. Sekhti  said, \"Ho! turn, that I may please thy heart with this discourse. Now at  this time let one of thy followers whom thou wilt, come to me that I  may send him to thee concerning it.\" The Lord Steward Meruitensa made  his follower, whom he chose, go straight unto him, and Sekhti sent him  back with an account of all these matters. Then the Lord Steward  Meruitensa accused Hemti unto the nobles who sat with him; and they said  unto him, \"By your leave: As to this Sekhti of yours, let him bring a  witness. Behold thou it is our custom with our Sekhtis; witnesses come  with them; behold, that is our custom.  Then it will be fitting to  beat this Hemti for a trifle of natron and a trifle of salt; if he is  commanded to pay for it, he will pay for it.\" But the High Steward  Meruitensa held his peace; for he would not reply unto these nobles,  but would reply unto the Sekhti.    Now Sekhti came to appeal to the Lord Steward Meruitensa, and said, \"O  my Lord Steward, greatest of the great, guide of the needy:      When thou embarkest on the lake of truth,--    Mayest thou sail upon it with a fair wind;    May thy mainsail not fly loose.    May there not be lamentation in thy cabin;    May not misfortune come after thee.    May not thy mainstays be snapped;    Mayest thou not run aground.    May not the wave seize thee;    Mayest thou not taste the impurities of the river;    Mayest thou not see the face of fear.    May the fish come to thee without escape;    Mayest thou reach unto plump waterfowl.    For thou art the orphan's father, the widow's husband,    The desolate woman's brother, the garment of the motherless.    Let me celebrate thy name in this land for every virtue.    A guide without greediness of heart;    A great one without any meanness.    Destroying deceit, encouraging justice;    Coming to the cry, and allowing utterance.    Let me speak, do thou hear and do justice;    O praised! whom the praised ones praise.    Abolish oppression, behold me, I am overladen,    Reckon with me, behold me defrauded.\"    Now the Sekhti made this speech in the time of the majesty of the King  Neb-ka-n-ra, blessed. The Lord Steward Meruitensa went away straight to  the king and said, \"My lord, I have found one of these Sekhti, excellent  of speech, in very truth; stolen are his goods, and he has come to  complain to me of the matter.\"    His majesty said, \"As thou wishest that I may see health! lengthen out  his complaint, without replying to any of his speeches. He who  desireth him to continue speaking should be silent; behold, bring us  his words in writing, that we may listen to them. But provide for his  wife and his children, and let the Sekhti himself also have a living.  Thou must cause one to give him his portion without letting him know  that thou art he who is giving it to him.\"    There were given to him four loaves and two draughts of beer each day;  which the Lord Steward Meruitensa provided for him, giving it to a  friend of his, who furnished it unto him. Then the Lord Steward  Meruitensa sent the governor of the Sekhet Hemat to make provision for  the wife of the Sekhti, three rations of corn each day.    Then came the Sekhti a second time, and even a third time, unto the Lord  Steward Meruitensa; but he told two of his followers to go unto the  Sekhti, and seize on him, and beat him with staves. But he came again  unto him, even unto six times, and said--    \"My Lord Steward-Destroying deceit, and encouraging justice; Raising up  every good thing, and crushing every evil; As plenty comes removing  famine, As clothing covers nakedness, As clear sky after storm warms the  shivering; As fire cooks that which is raw, As water quenches the  thirst; Look with thy face upon my lot; do not covet, but  content me without fail; do the right and do not evil.\"    But yet Meruitensa would not hearken unto his complaint; and the Sekhti  came yet, and yet again, even unto the ninth time. Then the Lord Steward  told two of his followers to go unto the Sekhti; and the Sekhti feared  that he should be beaten as at the third request. But the Lord Steward  Meruitensa then said unto him, \"Fear not, Sekhti, for what thou has  done. The Sekhti has made many speeches, delightful to the heart of his  majesty and I take an oath--as I eat bread, and as I drink water--that  thou shalt be remembered to eternity.\" Said the Lord Steward, \"Moreover,  thou shalt be satisfied when thou shalt hear of thy complaints.\" He  caused to be written on a clean roll of papyrus each petition to the  end, and the Lord Steward Meruitensa sent it to the majesty of the  King Neb-ka-n-ra, blessed, and it was good to him more than anything  that is in the whole land: but his majesty said to Meruitensa, \"Judge  it thyself; I do not desire it.\"    The Lord Steward Meruitensa made two of his followers to go to the  Sekhet Hemat, and bring a list of the household of the Sekhti; and its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7401"],[0,"A Crystal Age (#5)"],[1,"nsion!\" I remarked at length to my venerable host, feeling,  Englishman-like, a sudden great access of respect towards the owner of a  big house. Men in such a position can afford to be as eccentric as they  like, even to the wearing of Carnivalesque garments, burying their  friends or relations in a park, and shaking their heads over such names  as Smith or Shakespeare. \"A glorious place! It must have cost a pot of  money, and taken a long time to build.\"    \"What you mean by _a pot of money_ I do not know,\" said he. \"When  you add _a long time to build_, I am also puzzled to understand  you. For are not all houses, like the forest of trees, the human race,  the world we live in, eternal?\"    \"If they stand forever they are so in one sense, I suppose,\" I answered,  beginning to fear that I had already unfortunately broken the rule I had  so recently laid down for my own guidance. \"But the trees of the forest,  to which you compare a house, spring from seed, do they not? and so have  a beginning. Their end also, like the end of man, is to die and return  to the dust.\"    \"That is true,\" he returned; \"it is, moreover, a truth which I do not  now hear for the first time; but it has no connection with the subject  we are discussing. Men pass away, and others take their places. Trees  also decay, but the forest does not die, or suffer for the loss of  individual trees; is it not the same with the house and the family  inhabiting it, which is one with the house, and endures forever, albeit  the members composing it must all in time return to the dust?\"    \"Is there no decay, then, of the materials composing a house?\"    \"Assuredly there is! Even the hardest stone is worn in time by the  elements, or by the footsteps of many generations of men; but the stone  that decays is removed, and the house does not suffer.\"    \"I have never looked at it quite in this light before,\" said I. \"But  surely we can build a house whenever we wish!\"    \"Build a house whenever we wish!\" he repeated, with that astonished look  which threatened to become the permanent expression of his face--so long  as he had me to talk with, at any rate.    \"Yes, or pull one down if we find it unsuitable--\" But his look of  horror here made me pause, and to finish the sentence I added: \"Of  course, you must admit that a house had a beginning?\"    \"Yes; and so had the forest, the mountain, the human race, the world  itself. But the origin of all these things is covered with the mists of  time.\"    \"Does it never happen, then, that a house, however substantially  built--\"    \"However what! But never mind; you continue to speak in riddles. Pray,  finish what you were saying.\"    \"Does it never happen that a house is overthrown by some natural  force--by floods, or subsidence of the earth, or is destroyed by  lightning or fire?\"    \"No!\" he answered, with such tremendous emphasis that he almost made me  jump from my seat. \"Are you alone so ignorant of these things that you  speak of building and of pulling down a house?\"    \"Well, I fancied I knew a lot of things once,\" I answered, with a sigh.  \"But perhaps I was mistaken--people often are. I should like to hear you  say something more about all these things--I mean about the house and  the family, and the rest of it.\"    \"Are you not, then, able to read--have you been taught absolutely  nothing?\"    \"Oh yes, certainly I can read,\" I answered, joyfully seizing at once on  the suggestion, which seemed to open a simple, pleasant way of escape  from the difficulty. \"I am by no means a studious person; perhaps I am  never so happy as when I have nothing to read. Nevertheless, I do  occasionally look into books, and greatly appreciate their gentle,  kindly ways. They never shut themselves up with a sound like a slap, or  throw themselves at your head for a duffer, but seem silently grateful  for being read, even by a stupid person, and teach you very patiently,  like a pretty, meek-spirited young girl.\"    \"I am very pleased to hear it,\" said he. \"You shall read and learn all  these things for yourself, which is the best method. Or perhaps I ought  rather to say, you shall by reading recall them to your mind, for it is  impossible to believe that it has always been in its present pitiable  condition. I can only attribute such a mental state, with its disordered  fancies about cities, or immense hives of human beings, and other things  equally frightful to contemplate, and its absolute vacancy concerning  ordinary matters of knowledge, to the grave accident you met with in the  hills. Doubtless in falling your head was struck and injured by a stone.  Let us hope that you will soon recover possession of your memory and  other faculties. And now let us repair to the eating-room, for it is  best to refresh the body first, and the mind afterwards.\"              Chapter 3    We ascended the steps, and passing through the portico went into the  hall by what seemed to me a doorless way. It was not really so, as I  discovered later; the doors, of which there were several, some of  colored glass, others of some other material, were simply thrust back  into receptacles within the wall itself, which was five or six feet  thick. The hall was the noblest I had ever seen; it had a stone and  bronze fireplace some twenty or thirty feet long on one side, and  several tall arched doorways on the other. The spaces between the doors  were covered with sculpture, its material being a blue-gray stone  combined or inlaid with a yellow metal, the effect being indescribably  rich. The floor was mosaic of many dark colors, but with no definite  pattern, and the concave roof was deep red in color. Though beautiful,  it was somewhat somber, as the light was not strong. At all events, that  is how it struck me at first on coming in from the bright sunlight. Nor,  it appeared, was I alone in experiencing such a feeling. As soon as we  were inside, the old gentleman, removing his cap and passing his thin  fingers through his white hair, looked around him, and addressing some  of the others, who were bringing in small round tables and placing them  about the hall, said: \"No, no; let us sup this evening where we can look  at the sky.\"    The tables were immediately taken away.    Now some of those who were in the hall or who came in with the tables  had not attended the funeral, and these were all astonished on seeing  me. They did not stare at me, but I, of course, saw the expression on  their faces, and noticed that the others who had made my acquaintance at  the grave-side whispered in their ears to explain my presence. This made  me extremely uncomfortable, and it was a relief when they began to go  out again.    One of the men was seated near me; he was of those who had assisted in  carrying the corpse, and he now turned to me and remarked: \"You have  been a long time in the open air, and probably feel the change as much  as we do.\"    I assented, and he rose and walked away to the far end of the hall,  where a great door stood facing the one by which we had entered. From  the spot where I was--a distance of forty or fifty feet, perhaps--this  door appeared to be of polished slate of a very dark gray, its surface  ornamented with very large horse-chestnut leaves of brass or copper, or  both, for they varied in shade from bright yellow to deepest copper-red.  It was a double door with agate handles, and, first pressing on one  handle, then on the other, he thrust it back into the walls on either  side, revealing a new thing of beauty to my eyes, for behind the  vanished door was a window, the sight of which came suddenly before me  like a celestial vision. Sunshine, wind, cloud and rain had evidently  inspired the artist who designed it, but I did not at the time  understand the meaning of the symbolic figures appearing in the picture.  Below, with loosened dark golden-red hair and amber-colored garments  fluttering in the wind, stood a graceful female figure on the summit of  a gray rock; over the rock, and as high as her knees, slanted the thin  branches of some mountain shrub, the strong wind even now stripping them  of their remaining yellow and russet leaves, whirling them aloft and  away. Round the woman's head was a garland of ivy leaves, and she was  gazing aloft with expectant face, stretching up her arms, as if to  implore or receive some precious gift from the sky. Above, against the  slaty-gray cloud-wrack, four exquisite slender girl-forms appeared, with  loose hair, silver-gray drapery and gauzy wings as of ephemerae, flying  in pursuit of the cloud. Each carried a quantity of flowers, shaped like  lilies, in her dress, held up with the left hand; one carried red  lilies, another yellow, the third violet, and the last blue; and the  gauzy wings and drapery of each was also touched in places with the same  hue as the flowers she carried. Looking back in their flight they were  all with the disengaged hand throwing down lilies to the standing  figure.    This lovely window gave a fresh charm to the whole apartment, while the  sunlight falling through it served also to reveal other beauties which I  had not observed. One that quickly drew and absorbed my attention was a  piece of statuary on the floor at some distance from me, and going to it  I stood for some time gazing on it in the greatest delight. It was a  statue about one-third the size of life, of a young woman seated on a  white bull with golden horns. She had a graceful figure and beautiful  countenance; the face, arms and feet were alabaster, the flesh tinted,  but with colors more delicate than in nature. On her arms were broad  golden armlets, and the drapery, a long flowing robe, was blue,  embroidered with yellow flowers. A stringed instrument rested on her  knee, and she was represented playing and singing. The bull, with  lowered horns, appeared walking; about his chest hung a garland of  flowers mingled with ears of yellow corn, oak, ivy, and various other  "]]]
