He found the narrow cleft leading downward into the heart of the kopje  along well-worn, granite steps.  He advanced quite to the dark mouth of  the tunnel into which the runway disappeared; but here he halted,  fearing to enter, lest he meet Tarzan returning.    The ape-man, far ahead of him, groped his way along the rocky passage,  until he came to the ancient wooden door.  A moment later he stood  within the treasure chamber, where, ages since, long-dead hands had  ranged the lofty rows of precious ingots for the rulers of that great  continent which now lies submerged beneath the waters of the Atlantic.    No sound broke the stillness of the subterranean vault.  There was no  evidence that another had discovered the forgotten wealth since last  the ape-man had visited its hiding place.    Satisfied, Tarzan turned and retraced his steps toward the summit of  the kopje.  Werper, from the concealment of a jutting, granite  shoulder, watched him pass up from the shadows of the stairway and  advance toward the edge of the hill which faced the rim of the valley  where the Waziri awaited the signal of their master.  Then Werper,  slipping stealthily from his hiding place, dropped into the somber  darkness of the entrance and disappeared.    Tarzan, halting upon the kopje's edge, raised his voice in the  thunderous roar of a lion.  Twice, at regular intervals, he repeated  the call, standing in attentive silence for several minutes after the  echoes of the third call had died away.  And then, from far across the  valley, faintly, came an answering roar--once, twice, thrice.  Basuli,  the Waziri chieftain, had heard and replied.    Tarzan again made his way toward the treasure vault, knowing that in a  few hours his blacks would be with him, ready to bear away another  fortune in the strangely shaped, golden ingots of Opar.  In the  meantime he would carry as much of the precious metal to the summit of  the kopje as he could.    Six trips he made in the five hours before Basuli reached the kopje,  and at the end of that time he had transported forty-eight ingots to  the edge of the great boulder, carrying upon each trip a load which  might well have staggered two ordinary men, yet his giant frame showed  no evidence of fatigue, as he helped to raise his ebon warriors to the  hill top with the rope that had been brought for the purpose.    Six times he had returned to the treasure chamber, and six times  Werper, the Belgian, had cowered in the black shadows at the far end of  the long vault.  Once again came the ape-man, and this time there came  with him fifty fighting men, turning porters for love of the only  creature in the world who might command of their fierce and haughty  natures such menial service.  Fifty-two more ingots passed out of the  vaults, making the total of one hundred which Tarzan intended taking  away with him.    As the last of the Waziri filed from the chamber, Tarzan turned back  for a last glimpse of the fabulous wealth upon which his two inroads  had made no appreciable impression.  Before he extinguished the single  candle he had brought with him for the purpose, and the flickering  light of which had cast the first alleviating rays into the  impenetrable darkness of the buried chamber, that it had known for the  countless ages since it had lain forgotten of man, Tarzan's mind  reverted to that first occasion upon which he had entered the treasure  vault, coming upon it by chance as he fled from the pits beneath the  temple, where he had been hidden by La, the High Priestess of the Sun  Worshipers.    He recalled the scene within the temple when he had lain stretched upon  the sacrificial altar, while La, with high-raised dagger, stood above  him, and the rows of priests and priestesses awaited, in the ecstatic  hysteria of fanaticism, the first gush of their victim's warm blood,  that they might fill their golden goblets and drink to the glory of  their Flaming God.    The brutal and bloody interruption by Tha, the mad priest, passed  vividly before the ape-man's recollective eyes, the flight of the  votaries before the insane blood lust of the hideous creature, the  brutal attack upon La, and his own part of the grim tragedy when he had  battled with the infuriated Oparian and left him dead at the feet of  the priestess he would have profaned.    This and much more passed through Tarzan's memory as he stood gazing at  the long tiers of dull-yellow metal.  He wondered if La still ruled the  temples of the ruined city whose crumbling walls rose upon the very  foundations about him.  Had she finally been forced into a union with  one of her grotesque priests?  It seemed a hideous fate, indeed, for  one so beautiful.  With a shake of his head, Tarzan stepped to the  flickering candle, extinguished its feeble rays and turned toward the  exit.    Behind him the spy waited for him to be gone.  He had learned the  secret for which he had come, and now he could return at his leisure to  his waiting followers, bring them to the treasure vault and carry away  all the gold that they could stagger under.    The Waziri had reached the outer end of the tunnel, and were winding  upward toward the fresh air and the welcome starlight of the kopje's  summit, before Tarzan shook off the detaining hand of reverie and  started slowly after them.    Once again, and, he thought, for the last time, he closed the massive  door of the treasure room.  In the darkness behind him Werper rose and  stretched his cramped muscles.  He stretched forth a hand and lovingly  caressed a golden ingot on the nearest tier.  He raised it from its  immemorial resting place and weighed it in his hands.  He clutched it  to his bosom in an ecstasy of avarice.    Tarzan dreamed of the happy homecoming which lay before him, of dear  arms about his neck, and a soft cheek pressed to his; but there rose to  dispel that dream the memory of the old witch-doctor and his warning.    And then, in the span of a few brief seconds, the hopes of both these  men were shattered.  The one forgot even his greed in the panic of  terror--the other was plunged into total forgetfulness of the past by a  jagged fragment of rock which gashed a deep cut upon his head.          5    The Altar of the Flaming God      It was at the moment that Tarzan turned from the closed door to pursue  his way to the outer world.  The thing came without warning.  One  instant all was quiet and stability--the next, and the world rocked,  the tortured sides of the narrow passageway split and crumbled, great  blocks of granite, dislodged from the ceiling, tumbled into the narrow  way, choking it, and the walls bent inward upon the wreckage.  Beneath  the blow of a fragment of the roof, Tarzan staggered back against the  door to the treasure room, his weight pushed it open and his body  rolled inward upon the floor.    In the great apartment where the treasure lay less damage was wrought  by the earthquake.  A few ingots toppled from the higher tiers, a  single piece of the rocky ceiling splintered off and crashed downward  to the floor, and the walls cracked, though they did not collapse.    There was but the single shock, no other followed to complete the  damage undertaken by the first.  Werper, thrown to his length by the  suddenness and violence of the disturbance, staggered to his feet when  he found himself unhurt.  Groping his way toward the far end of the  chamber, he sought the candle which Tarzan had left stuck in its own  wax upon the protruding end of an ingot.    By striking numerous matches the Belgian at last found what he sought,  and when, a moment later, the sickly rays relieved the Stygian darkness  about him, he breathed a nervous sigh of relief, for the impenetrable  gloom had accentuated the terrors of his situation.    As they became accustomed to the light the man turned his eyes toward  the door--his one thought now was of escape from this frightful  tomb--and as he did so he saw the body of the naked giant lying  stretched upon the floor just within the doorway.  Werper drew back in  sudden fear of detection; but a second glance convinced him that the  Englishman was dead.  From a great gash in the man's head a pool of  blood had collected upon the concrete floor.    Quickly, the Belgian leaped over the prostrate form of his erstwhile  host, and without a thought of succor for the man in whom, for aught he  knew, life still remained, he bolted for the passageway and safety.    But his renewed hopes were soon dashed.  Just beyond the doorway he  found the passage completely clogged and choked by impenetrable masses  of shattered rock.  Once more he turned and re-entered the treasure  vault.  Taking the candle from its place he commenced a systematic  search of the apartment, nor had he gone far before he discovered  another door in the opposite end of the room, a door which gave upon  creaking hinges to the weight of his body.  Beyond the door lay another  narrow passageway.  Along this Werper made his way, ascending a flight  of stone steps to another corridor twenty feet above the level of the  first.  The flickering candle lighted the way before him, and a moment  later he was thankful for the possession of this crude and antiquated  luminant, which, a few hours before he might have looked upon with  contempt, for it showed him, just in time, a yawning pit, apparently  terminating the tunnel he was traversing.    Before him was a circular shaft.  He held the candle above it and  peered downward.  Below him, at a great distance, he saw the light  reflected back from the surface of a pool of water.  He had come upon a  well.  He raised the candle above his head and peered across the black  void, and there upon the opposite side he saw the continuation of the  tunnel; but how was he to span the gulf?    As he stood there measuring the distance to the opposite side and  wondering if he dared venture so great a leap, there broke"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/926"],[0,"Ten Thousand Dreams Interpreted; Or, What's in a Dream (#5)"],[1,"  _Dreams transpire on the subjective plane.  They should therefore  be interpreted by subjective intelligence_.  This, though burdened  with many business cares, I have honestly endeavored to do.  Through the long hours of many nights I have waited patiently  and passively the automatic movement of my hand to write  the subjective definitions without receiving a word or a single  manifestation of intelligence, and again the mysterious forces  would write as fast as my hand could move over the paper.    I will leave it for my readers to draw their own conclusions  as to whether automatic writing is the work of extraneous spirits,  through the brain and intelligence of the medium, or the result  of auto-suggestive influence upon the subjective personality.    It is argued by the Materialist, with some degree of strength,  that the healthy man does not dream, This is, perhaps, true, in a way,  but the whole man comprises the past, present, and future.  The past  and future always embrace more of the conditions that surround him than  the present.  The present is only the acute stage, while the chronic stage,  considered from a personal view, is the past and future combined.  Man cannot eliminate entirely these states from himself, for, while they  are past and future to the personal mind, they are ever present  to the higher subjective senses; he is, therefore, never in perfect  health unless these states are in harmony with the present.  The personal self, in a normal state, cannot free itself from the past  or from the anxieties of the future.    The reader should ever keep before his mind the fact that no man  ever had the same dream twice.  He may have had very similar dreams,  but some detail will be missing.  Nature seems to abhor duplicates.  You could no more find two dreams alike than you could find facsimiles  in two blades of grass.  A man cannot live two days exactly alike.  Different influences and passions will possess him.  Consequently, no two  dreams can be had under exactly the same influences.  Stereotypes are  peculiarly the invention of man and not of God or nature.    Since it is impossible to find a man twice in exactly the same  mental state, it is equally impossible for him to dream the same  dream twice; therefore, it is only possible to approximate  dream interpretation by classing them into families.  This I have attempted to do in a more comprehensive way than  other writers who have preceded me.    All men are acquainted with health and sickness, love and hate,  success and failure.  Sickness, hate and failure belong to kindred families,  and often ally their forces in such a way that it is hard to say whether  the dreamer will fail in love, health or some business undertaking.  But at all times a bad symbol is a warning of evil, though that evil may  be minimized or exaggerated, or _vice versa_, according as signs are good.    Thus, if the dream symbol indicates wealth or fortune to the peasant,  his waking life may be gladdened by receiving or seeing a fifty-cent piece,  or finding assuring work, while the same symbol to a wealthy man would  mean many dollars, or a favorable turn in affairs.    It is the same in physical life.  A man may hear the sound of a wagon.  He cannot determine by the rattle of the wheels whether it is laden  with laundry, groceries or dry goods.  He may judge as to its size  and whether it is bearing a heavy or a light burden.  When it  objectifies he will be able to know its full import and not before.  So with dream symbols.  We may know they are fraught with evil or good,  as in the case of Pilate's wife, but we cannot tell their full meaning  until their reflections materialize before the objective sense.    Death is more frequently foretold by dream messages or visions,  as explained in another part of this chapter.    During sleep the will is suspended, leaving the mind often a prey  to its own fancy.  The slightest attack of an enemy may be foretold  by the unbridled imagination exaggerating the mental picture into  a monstrous shark or snake, when, indeed, a much less portentous  sign was cast from the dream mold.    A woman may see a serpent in waking life and through fright lose reason  or self-control. She imagines it pursues her when in reality it is going  an opposite direction; in a like way dreams may be many times unreal.    The mind loses its reason or will in sleep, but a supersensitive  perception is awakened, and, as it regains consciousness from sleep,  the sound of a knock on the wall may be magnified into a pistol shot.    The sleeping mind is not only supersensitive as to existing external sounds  and light, but it frequently sees hours and days ahead of the waking mind.    Nor is this contradictory to the laws of nature.  The ant housed  in the depth of the earth, away from atmospheric changes,  knows of the approach of the harvest, and comes forth to lay  by his store.    In a like manner, the pet squirrel is a better barometer of the local weather  than the Weather Bureau.  With unerring foresight, when a wintry frown nowhere  mars the horizon, he is able to apprehend a cold wave twenty-four hours ahead,  and build his house accordingly.    So in sleep, man dreams the future by intuitive perception of invisible  signs or influences, while awake he reasons it out by cause and effect.  The former seems to be the law of the spiritual world, while the latter  would appear to be the law of the material world.  Man should not depend  alone upon either.  Together they proclaim the male and female principle  of existence and should find harmonious consummation.    In this manner only can man hope to achieve that perfect normal  state to which the best thought of the human race is aspiring,  where he can create and control influences instead of being  created and controlled by them, as the majority of us are at  the present day.    God, the highest subjective source of intelligence, may in a  dream leave impressions or presentiments on the mind of man,  the highest objective source of intelligence.    The physical sun sends its light into the dark corners of the earth,  and God, the Spiritual Sun, imparts spiritual light into the passive  and receptive soul.    Man, by hiding in a cave, or closing the windows and doors of his house,  may shut out all physical light; so he may steep his soul in sensual  debauchery until all spiritual light is shut out.    Just as the vital essence of the soil, the mother of nature,  may be extracted by abuse, either from omission or commission,  until neither the light of the sun, nor the moisture of the heavens  will wake the flush of life, so may the spiritual essence  be deadened when the soil of the soul is filled with the aged  and multiplying weeds of ravishing materiality.    The dream mind is often influenced by the waking mind.  When the waking mind dwells upon any subject, the dream mind  is more or less influenced by it, and it often assists the waking  mind in solving difficult problems.  The personal future,  embodied in the active states of the universal mind,  may affect the dream mind, producing premonitions of death,  accidents and misfortune.    The objective mind rejoices or laments over the aspects of the past  and present, while the spiritual mind, striving with the personal future,  either laments or rejoices over the prospective conditions.    One is the barometer of the past, while the other is the barometer  of the future.    If we study carefully the spiritual impressions left upon the dream mind,  through the interpretations of this book, we will be able to shape our future  in accordance with spiritual law.    Thus our temporal events will contribute to our spiritual development,  and in turn our spiritual knowledge will contribute to our temporal welfare.  Without this harmonious interaction of the two great forces in man,  the Divine plan of destiny cannot be reached.    This can only be accomplished through the material mind  or reason dominating the animal emotions of the heart.  In this way we would not covet our neighbor's goods, or grow  angry with our brother over trifles.    The house vacated by the sefish{sic} appetites of the world would  be filled with the whispers of spiritual love and wisdom necessary  to the mutual welfare and development of body and soul.    The theory used in this book to interpret dreams is both simple and rational.  By the using of it you will be surprised to find so many of the predictions  fulfilled in your waking life.  We deal with both the thought and the dream.  The thought or sign implied in the object dreamed of and the influence  surrounding it are always considered in the interpretation.    Thoughts proceed from the visible mind and dreams from the invisible mind.  The average waking mind receives and retains only a few of the lessons  of life.  It is largely filled with idle and incoherent thoughts that  are soon forgotten.  The same may be truly said of the dream mind.  Many of our day thoughts are day dreams, just as many of our night dreams  are night thoughts.  Our day deeds of evil or good pierce or soothe  the conscience, just as our night symbols of sorrow and joy sadden or please  the objective senses.  Our day's thoughts are filled with the warnings  and presence of the inner mind and our night's thoughts are tinctured  and often controlled by our external mind.    Some writer has said:  ``Everything that exists upon earth has its  ethereal counterpart.''  Christ said:  ``As a man thinketh so is he.''  A Hindu proverb says:  ``Man is a creature of reflection; he becomes  that upon which he reflects.''  A modern metaphysicist says:  ``Our thoughts are real substance and leave their images upon  our personality, they fill our aura with beauty or ugliness according  to our intents and purposes in life.''  Each evil thought or action  has its pursuing phantom, each smile or kindly deed its guiding angel,  we leave wherever we "]]]
