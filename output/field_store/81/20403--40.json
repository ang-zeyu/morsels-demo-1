Of the twenty odd who were upon the steamer at the time of the  explosion, nearly one-half were killed; they sinking to the bottom  almost as suddenly as the wrecked steamer, of which not a single trace  now remained.    The survivors made their way to land, reaching it a short distance  below their starting-point, and here they assembled, to commiserate  with each other upon their hapless lot and determine how they were to  reach home.    Our three friends had remained upon shore about half an hour, the two  waiting for the third to recover, when the latter raised himself upon  his elbow in the attitude of listening. At the same time he waved his  hand for the others to hold their peace.    A moment later he said:    'I  hear Injins.''    'Begorrah! where bees the same?' demanded Mickey, starting to his  feet, while Ethan gazed alarmedly about.    'Jist take a squint up the river, and tell me ef they ain't pitchin'  into the poor critters thar.'    Through the sheltering trees and undergrowth, which partly protected  them, the two men gazed up-stream. To their horror, they saw fully  fifty Indians massacring the survivors of the wreck, whooping,  screeching and yelling like demons, while their poor victims were  vainly endeavoring to escape them.    'Begorrah, now, but that looks bad!' exclaimed the Irishman. 'Be the  same towken, what is it that we can do?'    'Jerusalem!  They'll be sure to pay us a visit.  I'll be gumtued if they  won't,' added the Yankee, in some trepidation, as he cowered down  again by the side of the hunter, and said to him in a lower Voice:    'The worst of it is, we haven't got a gun atwixt us. Of course we  shall stick by you if we have to lose our heads fur it. But don't you  think they'll pay us a visit?'    'Like 'noughtin',' was the indifferent reply of the hunter, as he laid  his head back again, as if tired of listening to the tumult.    'Can't we do anything to get you out of danger!'    'Can't see that you kin; you two fellers have done me a good turn in  gittin' me ashore, so jist leave me yere, and it don't make no  difference about me one way or t'other, Ef I hear 'em comin' I'll jist  roll into the water and go under in that style.'    'May the Howly Vargin niver smile upon us if we dissart you in this  extremity,' was the reply of the fervent-hearted Irishman.    'And by the jumpin' jingo! if we was consarnedly mean enough to do it,  there ain't no need of it.'    As the Yankee spoke, he ran down to the river, and walking out a short  distance, caught a log drifting by and drew it in.    'Naow, Mr. Baldy, or Mr. Bicknell, as you call yourself, we'll all  three git hold of that and float down the river till we git beyond  fear of the savages.'    The plan was a good one, and the hunter so expressed himself. With  some help he managed to crawl to the river bank, where one arm was  placed over the log, in such a manner that he could easily float,  without any danger of sinking.    'Keep as close to shore as you kin,' he said, as they were about  shoving off.    'We can go faster in the middle,' said Hopkins.    'But the reds'll see us, and it'll be all up then.'    This was the warning of prudence, and it was heeded.                               CHAPTER VI. THE MINERS.    IT WAS late in the afternoon when the explosion occurred, and it was  just beginning to grow dark when the three friends began drifting down  the Yellowstone.    This fact was greatly in their favor, although there remained an hour  or two of great danger, in case the Indians made any search for them.  In case of discovery, there was hardly an earthly chance for escape.    The log or raft, as it might be termed, had floated very quietly  down-stream for about half an hour, when the wonderfully acute ears of  the trapper detected danger.    'Thar be some of the skunks that are creep-in 'long shore,' said he;  'you'd better run in under this yar tree and hold fast awhile.'    The warning was heeded. Just below them, the luxuriant branches of an  oak, dipped in the current, formed an impenetrable screen. As the log,  guided thither, floated beneath this, Mickey and Ethan both caught  hold of the branches and held themselves motionless.    'Now wait till it's dark, and then thar'll be no fear of the  varmints,' added the trapper.    ''Sh! I haars sumfin'!' whispered the Irishman    'What is it?' asked Ethan.    'How does I know till yees kaaps still?'    'It's the reds goin' long the banks,' said the trapper.    The words were yet in his mouth, when the voice of one Indian was  heard calling to another. Neither Mickey nor Ethan had the remotest  idea of the meaning of the words uttered, but the trapper told them  that they were inquiring of each other whether anything had been  discovered of more fugitives. The answer being in the negative, our  friends considered their present position safe.    When it was fairly dark, and nothing more was seen or heard of the  Indians, the raft was permitted to float free, and they drifted with  the current. They kept the river until daylight, when, having been in  the water so long, they concluded it best to land and rest themselves.  By the aid of their revolvers they succeeded in' kindling a fire, the  warmth of which proved exceedingly grateful to all.    They would have had a very rough time had they not encountered a party  of hunters who accompanied them to St. Louis, where the trapper had  friends, and where, also, he had a good sum of money in the bank.    Here Baldy remained all winter, before he entirely recovered from the  hurt which he received during the explosion and sinking of the  steamer. When the Irishman and Yankee were about to depart, he asked  them where they were going.    'I'm goin' home in Connecticut and goin' to work on the farm, and  that's where I'm goin' to stay. I was a fool ever to leave it for this  confounded place. I could live decent put there, and that's more than  I can do in this blamed country.'    'And I shall go back to work on the Erie railroad, at thirty-siven  cents a day and boord myself,' replied the Irishman.    'If yer were sartin of findin' all the gold yor want, would yer go  back to Califony?''    'Arrah. Now, what are yees talkin' about?' asked McSquizzle, somewhat  impatiently. 'What is the good of talkin'?'    'I didn't ax yer to fool with yer,' replied the trapper, 'thar's a place  that I know away out West, that I call Wolf Ravine, whar thar's enough  gold to make both of yer richer than yer ever war afore, and then  leave some for yer children.'    'Jerusalem! but you're a lucky dog!' exclaimed Ethan Hopkins, not  daring to hope that he would reveal the place. 'Why don't you dig it  up naow, yourself?'    'I only found it a month ago, and I made a purty good haul of it, as  it was. When that old boss of mine went down with the steamer, he  carried a powerful heft of gold with him, and if anybody finds his  carcass, it'll be the most vallyable one they ever come across.'    'Jingo! if I'd know'd that, I'd taken a hunt for him myself.'    'Howsumever, that's neither yar nor thar. You both done me a good turn  when I got into trouble on the river, and I mud' up my mind to do what  I could toward payin' it back the first chance I got. I didn't say  nothin' of it when we was on our way, 'cause I was afeard it would  make you too crazy to go back ag'in: but if you'll come back this way  next spring I'll make the trip with you.'    'Why not go naow?' eagerly inquired Hopkins.    'It's too late in the season. I don't want to be thar when thar's too  much snow onto the ground, and then I must stay yar till I git well  over that whack I got on the boat.'    It is hardly necessary to say that the offer of the kind-hearted  trapper was accepted with the utmost enthusiasm. Mickey and Ethan were  more anxious to go out upon the prairies than they had been a year and  a half before, when they started so full of fife and hope for that  vast wilderness, and had come back with such discouragement and  disgust.    It was arranged that as soon as the succeeding spring had fairly set  in, they would set out on their return for St. Louis, where the  trapper would meet and accompany them to the wonderful gold region of  which he had spoken.    Before continuing their journey homeward, Baldy presented each with a  complete outfit, paid their passage to their homes, and gave them a  snug sum over. Like the Indian, he never could forget a kindness shown  him, nor do too great a favor to those who had so signally benefited  him.    So the separation took place again; and, on the following spring  Mickey and Ethan appeared in St. Louis, where they had no difficulty  in finding their old friend, the trapper.    He had recovered entirely from his prostrating blow, and was expecting  them, anxious and glad to join in the promised search for gold. As the  fair weather had really begun, there was no time lost in unnecessary  delay. The purse of Baldy Bicknell was deep, and he had not the common  habit of intoxication, which takes so much substance from a man. He  purchased a horse and accouterments for each of his friends; and,  before they started westward, saw that nothing at all was lacking in  their outfit.    Three weeks later the men drew rein in a tort of valley, very deep but  not very wide. It was on the edge of an immense prairie, while a river  of considerable size flowed by the rear, and by a curious circuit  found its way into the lower portion of the ravine, dashing and  roaring forward in a furious canyon.    The edge and interior of the ravine was lined with immense bowlders  and rocks, while large and stunted trees seemed to grow everywhere.    'Yar's what I call Wolf Ravine,' said Baldy when they had spent some  time in looking; about them.    'And be the same towken, where is the goold?' inquired"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7509"],[0,"The Logbooks of the Lady Nelson (#5)"],[1,"soil, plenty of grass, and fine woods.  Towards evening saw many fires a little way inland. Many seals and  porpoises about to-day. At 5 A.M. saw another cape not unlike the Deadman  in the English Channel: it runs a considerable way into the sea. When to  the west it appears like a long barn arched on the top with a high bluff  and next the sea resembling the gable end of a house. I named the land  Sir William Grant's Cape.* (* Lieutenant Grant also called this cape,  Cape Solicitor. This name did not survive--the cape being known as Cape  Sir W. Grant.) Off this Cape are two small islands (the largest appears  like two) having two hummocks joined together by a neck of low land which  is not seen till pretty close. On approaching, the smaller island is  seen--a little nearer the shore. These I called Lawrence's Islands after  Captain Lawrence, one of the Elder Brethren of Trinity House. As they  will be an excellent mark for making this part...and Cape Northumberland,  and being very remarkable, navigators will know where they are as they  draw abreast of them, the largest being to the Southwards. Its outer end  appears like a square-topt tower, very high, with a white spot in the  middle of it. The other end is also very high. Lawrence's Islands bear  from Cape Sir William Grant south-east or south-east by south 12 miles  distant and there appears no danger between them and the shore. The cape  now loses its long form as the vessel gets to the eastward and its  particular shape changes to a high bluff point, steep and inaccessible.  Many fires were seen about this cape. The land from it runs to the  northward as far as the eye can reach or discern from the masthead.    \"December 6th. At three made a considerable large island high and  inaccessible on all sides. It was covered with grass, but no trees. This  island bears east-south-east from Cape Sir William Grant. By a good  observation at noon following I made its latitude to be 38 degrees 29  minutes south longitude...I made 144 degrees 40 minutes east. I named  this island Lady Julia's Island in honour of Lady Julia Percy. Observed  we ran faster along the land than our distance by log gave us, probably  owing to drift from the East.    \"December 7th. At daylight we saw the land making a cape ahead; hauled up  to clear it. This cape is due east-south-east with a moderate offing from  Cape Sir William Grant, distant by log 70 miles. It is the eastern  promontory of this deep and extensive bay. I named it Cape Albany Otway  (now Cape Otway) in honour of William Albany Otway, Esquire, Captain in  the Royal Navy and one of the commissioners of the Transport Board.* (*  Governor King says that Lieutenant Grant placed the longitude of Cape  Otway in about \"a degree and a half in error\": he also made the land to  trend away on the west side of Cape Otway to a bay in 38 degrees south  latitude which he named Portland Bay.) Another very high and considerable  cape I called Patton's Cape. I also distinguished the bay by the name of  Portland Bay in honour of His Grace the Duke of Portland. The land is  here truly picturesque and beautiful, resembling very much that about  Mount Edgcumbe, near Plymouth, which faces the Sound. It abounds in wood,  very thick groves and large trees. It is moderately high, but not  mountainous. We did not see any fires on it, probably from the shore  being inaccessible and much surf breaking on it. From Cape Albany Otway  east-north-east 10 or 12 miles is another point of land which appears as  a vessel rounds the former cape to the east. It is rather high land with  a clump of trees--as if regularly planted on its brow. Thinking we could  find an anchorage, I bore in pretty close, but as we approached I found  several heavy breakers at least 6 miles from the shore, but not a rock to  be seen. I therefore hauled and named the point of land Point Danger. In  getting to the eastward I could not find any shelter nor any place where  there was a likelihood of anchoring but from the number of little juts  and low points of land further to the north and east I was determined to  try if any such place could be got.    \"I never saw a finer country, the valleys appeared to have plenty of  fresh water meandering through them. At 11 A.M. I ordered the boats out  manned and armed, and went in search of a place to land or anchor in. We  got within a cable's length and a half of the beach, but finding the surf  breaking heavy I deemed it not prudent to attempt a landing. The shore  was a sandy beach with small rocks interspersed here and there. In trying  for soundings with a lead line none could be found, so that I really  think the beach is steep also. I was very disappointed in being so near  and obliged to return on board without setting foot on this beautiful  spot. It resembles the Isle of Wight as near as possible from the water.  I called this part of the coast (which falls into the bottom of a small  bay from Cape Danger to the very low land), Wight's Land in honour of  Captain Wight, R.N., son-in-law to Commissioner Schanck.    \"December 8th. At one made sail to the eastward. At 8 P.M. Cape Albany  Otway bearing west 18 or 20 miles we made a very high and lofty cape  covered with trees to the water's edge as is all the country round it.  From this cape the land breaks short round to the northward when I lost  it. We had now a fair wind and might have done a great deal during the  night but I had my doubts whether this land which fell off to the  northward should not have been followed and kept on board, as from a  small chart given to me by Sir Joseph Banks I found that, as far as the  coast had been surveyed the land trained off to the northward in the same  form nearly as it did here from Cape Patton--with this difference that  the cape I allude to on the chart had several islands lying off it.  Neither did the latitude exactly correspond and the land which it laid  down running to the northward was low and bushy, whereas that which I saw  was high with large forests of trees and no islands near it. I therefore  chose the middle road. Made sail and ran 60 miles eastward judging if it  was a bay I should see the eastern extremity of it. At daylight, however,  we could see nothing anywhere from the masthead, but the looming of the  land we had left behind. We now bore up and ran north by west and at six  we saw the land again ahead forming a very deep bay, which I could not  see the bottom of from the masthead.* (* (Note in log.) Had Grant  penetrated this bay he would have made a great discovery for he would  have found Port Phillip. However, from the evidence contained in his  chart he named the indentation in the coast Governor King's Bay. In  Grant's narrative appears the following note by Governor King. \"If such a  deep bay as this actually exists it favours the idea of New South Wales  being insulated by a Mediterranean sea. However, this the Lady Nelson  must determine in the voyage she is now gone upon. P.G.K.\") At eight the  land was observed bearing from us east-south-east extending farther to  the southward than I could see. Being now certain of our route I hauled  up east-south-east and named this bay after Governor King. It is one of  the longest we have yet met with. Cape Albany Otway forms the westernmost  and the South Cape the easternmost headlands, the distance of about 120  miles due east-south-east.    \"December 9th. At 4 P.M. saw several islands bearing east-south-east. The  mainland seemed to have an opening in it to the northward of them, which  we stood in for, but I found it was another bay with low land. I named  the northernmost cape after my friend, John Liptrap, Esquire, of London.  The mainland now extended a considerable way to the southward with  several islands off the cape. Judging this was the point of land we  looked for, from the colour of the water, we sounded and had 50 fathoms  with fine sand. South Cape distant 9 or 10 miles. The land abreast of the  ship appearing to be at no great distance, and it being quite calm I got  the boats out and sent the launch ahead to tow.    \"Thinking I should have the pleasure of setting my foot in this fine  country, I set off in the gig with two hands ordering the vessel to tow  in after me and should a breeze spring up to get the launch in and stand  after me for the bay. We pulled inshore for some islands lying off from  the main at the western side of the South Cape. Making for the largest of  them, which appeared to be the most fertile, on it I meant to have sown  some seeds which I took with me should I be able to land. The distance I  could not have believed was so great as it proved to be--at least 12  miles from where we quitted the vessel, which we lost sight of before  getting near the shore. Although we had not a breath of wind we found it  impossible to land on this side, the shore being very steep and a heavy  surf running on it. Therefore as the ship was not in sight, and as it was  2 P.M., I judged it prudent to get back as soon as possible, which we  effected at 4 P.M.    \"In the morning it was calm with hot sultry weather. At noon I had a good  observation in latitude 39 degrees 30 minutes south. The south part of  the main or South Cape bearing north-west by north distant 20 miles and  the longitude 147 degrees 18 minutes from a good lunar observation taken  on the 8th instant. All round the western side and even thus far south of  the cape there are soundings of fifty fathoms, 45 and 40 white sand and  shells. I called that space between Cape Liptrap and the South Cape, King  George's Sound.\"    I have no doubt but that there is good anchorage in the bight to the  northward of South Cape on the western side of which Cape Liptrap makes  the northern head. The land here is high and the mountains covered with  wood. Cape Liptrap is low and flat as is the land in this Bight where I  suppose there is shelter. There is an island bearing from the"]]]
