But ye perversely to religion strain  Him, who was born to gird on him the sword,  And of the fluent phrasemen make your king;  Therefore your steps have wander'd from the paths.\"          CANTO IX    After solution of my doubt, thy Charles,  O fair Clemenza, of the treachery spake  That must befall his seed: but, \"Tell it not,\"  Said he, \"and let the destin'd years come round.\"  Nor may I tell thee more, save that the meed  Of sorrow well-deserv'd shall quit your wrongs.    And now the visage of that saintly light  Was to the sun, that fills it, turn'd again,  As to the good, whose plenitude of bliss  Sufficeth all.  O ye misguided souls!  Infatuate, who from such a good estrange  Your hearts, and bend your gaze on vanity,  Alas for you!--And lo! toward me, next,  Another of those splendent forms approach'd,  That, by its outward bright'ning, testified  The will it had to pleasure me.  The eyes  Of Beatrice, resting, as before,  Firmly upon me, manifested forth  Approval of my wish.  \"And O,\" I cried,  \"Blest spirit! quickly be my will perform'd;  And prove thou to me, that my inmost thoughts  I can reflect on thee.\"  Thereat the light,  That yet was new to me, from the recess,  Where it before was singing, thus began,  As one who joys in kindness: \"In that part  Of the deprav'd Italian land, which lies  Between Rialto, and the fountain-springs  Of Brenta and of Piava, there doth rise,  But to no lofty eminence, a hill,  From whence erewhile a firebrand did descend,  That sorely sheet the region.  From one root  I and it sprang; my name on earth Cunizza:  And here I glitter, for that by its light  This star o'ercame me.  Yet I naught repine,  Nor grudge myself the cause of this my lot,  Which haply vulgar hearts can scarce conceive.    \"This jewel, that is next me in our heaven,  Lustrous and costly, great renown hath left,  And not to perish, ere these hundred years  Five times absolve their round.  Consider thou,  If to excel be worthy man's endeavour,  When such life may attend the first.  Yet they  Care not for this, the crowd that now are girt  By Adice and Tagliamento, still  Impenitent, tho' scourg'd.  The hour is near,  When for their stubbornness at Padua's marsh  The water shall be chang'd, that laves Vicena  And where Cagnano meets with Sile, one  Lords it, and bears his head aloft, for whom  The web is now a-warping.  Feltro too  Shall sorrow for its godless shepherd's fault,  Of so deep stain, that never, for the like,  Was Malta's bar unclos'd.  Too large should be  The skillet, that would hold Ferrara's blood,  And wearied he, who ounce by ounce would weight it,  The which this priest, in show of party-zeal,  Courteous will give; nor will the gift ill suit  The country's custom.  We descry above,  Mirrors, ye call them thrones, from which to us  Reflected shine the judgments of our God:  Whence these our sayings we avouch for good.\"    She ended, and appear'd on other thoughts  Intent, re-ent'ring on the wheel she late  Had left.  That other joyance meanwhile wax'd  A thing to marvel at, in splendour glowing,  Like choicest ruby stricken by the sun,  For, in that upper clime, effulgence comes  Of gladness, as here laughter: and below,  As the mind saddens, murkier grows the shade.    \"God seeth all: and in him is thy sight,\"  Said I, \"blest Spirit!  Therefore will of his  Cannot to thee be dark.  Why then delays  Thy voice to satisfy my wish untold,  That voice which joins the inexpressive song,  Pastime of heav'n, the which those ardours sing,  That cowl them with six shadowing wings outspread?  I would not wait thy asking, wert thou known  To me, as thoroughly I to thee am known.\"    He forthwith answ'ring, thus his words began:  \"The valley' of waters, widest next to that  Which doth the earth engarland, shapes its course,  Between discordant shores, against the sun  Inward so far, it makes meridian there,  Where was before th' horizon.  Of that vale  Dwelt I upon the shore, 'twixt Ebro's stream  And Macra's, that divides with passage brief  Genoan bounds from Tuscan.  East and west  Are nearly one to Begga and my land,  Whose haven erst was with its own blood warm.  Who knew my name were wont to call me Folco:  And I did bear impression of this heav'n,  That now bears mine: for not with fiercer flame  Glow'd Belus' daughter, injuring alike  Sichaeus and Creusa, than did I,  Long as it suited the unripen'd down  That fledg'd my cheek: nor she of Rhodope,  That was beguiled of Demophoon;  Nor Jove's son, when the charms of Iole  Were shrin'd within his heart.  And yet there hides  No sorrowful repentance here, but mirth,  Not for the fault (that doth not come to mind),  But for the virtue, whose o'erruling sway  And providence have wrought thus quaintly.  Here  The skill is look'd into, that fashioneth  With such effectual working, and the good  Discern'd, accruing to this upper world  From that below.  But fully to content  Thy wishes, all that in this sphere have birth,  Demands my further parle.  Inquire thou wouldst,  Who of this light is denizen, that here  Beside me sparkles, as the sun-beam doth  On the clear wave.  Know then, the soul of Rahab  Is in that gladsome harbour, to our tribe  United, and the foremost rank assign'd.  He to that heav'n, at which the shadow ends  Of your sublunar world, was taken up,  First, in Christ's triumph, of all souls redeem'd:  For well behoov'd, that, in some part of heav'n,  She should remain a trophy, to declare  The mighty contest won with either palm;  For that she favour'd first the high exploit  Of Joshua on the holy land, whereof  The Pope recks little now.  Thy city, plant  Of him, that on his Maker turn'd the back,  And of whose envying so much woe hath sprung,  Engenders and expands the cursed flower,  That hath made wander both the sheep and lambs,  Turning the shepherd to a wolf.  For this,  The gospel and great teachers laid aside,  The decretals, as their stuft margins show,  Are the sole study.  Pope and Cardinals,  Intent on these, ne'er journey but in thought  To Nazareth, where Gabriel op'd his wings.  Yet it may chance, erelong, the Vatican,  And other most selected parts of Rome,  That were the grave of Peter's soldiery,  Shall be deliver'd from the adult'rous bond.\"          CANTO X    Looking into his first-born with the love,  Which breathes from both eternal, the first Might  Ineffable, whence eye or mind  Can roam, hath in such order all dispos'd,  As none may see and fail to enjoy.  Raise, then,  O reader! to the lofty wheels, with me,  Thy ken directed to the point, whereat  One motion strikes on th' other.  There begin  Thy wonder of the mighty Architect,  Who loves his work so inwardly, his eye  Doth ever watch it.  See, how thence oblique  Brancheth the circle, where the planets roll  To pour their wished influence on the world;  Whose path not bending thus, in heav'n above  Much virtue would be lost, and here on earth,  All power well nigh extinct: or, from direct  Were its departure distant more or less,  I' th' universal order, great defect  Must, both in heav'n and here beneath, ensue.    Now rest thee, reader! on thy bench, and muse  Anticipative of the feast to come;  So shall delight make thee not feel thy toil.  Lo! I have set before thee, for thyself  Feed now: the matter I indite, henceforth  Demands entire my thought.  Join'd with the part,  Which late we told of, the great minister  Of nature, that upon the world imprints  The virtue of the heaven, and doles out  Time for us with his beam, went circling on  Along the spires, where each hour sooner comes;  And I was with him, weetless of ascent,  As one, who till arriv'd, weets not his coming.    For Beatrice, she who passeth on  So suddenly from good to better, time  Counts not the act, oh then how great must needs  Have been her brightness!  What she was i' th' sun  (Where I had enter'd), not through change of hue,  But light transparent--did I summon up  Genius, art, practice--I might not so speak,  It should be e'er imagin'd: yet believ'd  It may be, and the sight be justly crav'd.  And if our fantasy fail of such height,  What marvel, since no eye above the sun  Hath ever travel'd?  Such are they dwell here,  Fourth family of the Omnipotent Sire,  Who of his spirit and of his offspring shows;  And holds them still enraptur'd with the view.  And thus to me Beatrice: \"Thank, oh thank,  The Sun of angels, him, who by his grace  To this perceptible hath lifted thee.\"    Never was heart in such devotion bound,  And with complacency so absolute  Dispos'd to render up itself to God,  As mine was at those words: and so entire  The love for Him, that held me, it eclips'd  Beatrice in oblivion.  Naught displeas'd  Was she, but smil'd thereat so joyously,  That of her laughing eyes the radiance brake  And scatter'd my collected mind abroad.    Then saw I a bright band, in liveliness  Surpassing, who themselves did make the crown,  And us their centre: yet more sweet in voice,  Than in their visage beaming.  Cinctur'd thus,  Sometime Latona's daughter we behold,  When the impregnate air retains the thread,  That weaves her zone.  In the celestial court,  Whence I return, are many jewels found,  So dear and beautiful, they cannot brook  Transporting from that realm: and of these lights  Such was the song.  Who doth not prune his wing  To soar up thither, let him look from thence  For tidings from the dumb.  When, singing thus,  Those burning suns that circled round us thrice,  As nearest stars around the fixed pole,  Then seem'd they like to ladies, from the dance  Not ceasing, but suspense, in silent pause,  List'ning, till they have caught the strain anew:  Suspended so they stood: and, from within,  Thus heard I one, who spake: \"Since with its beam  The grace, whence true love lighteth first his flame,  That after doth increase by loving, shines "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1008"],[0,"Divine Comedy, Cary's Translation, Complete (#6)"],[1,"exhaling, round  The city' of grief encompasses, which now  We may not enter without rage.\"  Yet more  He added:  but I hold it not in mind,  For that mine eye toward the lofty tower  Had drawn me wholly, to its burning top.  Where in an instant I beheld uprisen  At once three hellish furies stain'd with blood:  In limb and motion feminine they seem'd;  Around them greenest hydras twisting roll'd  Their volumes; adders and cerastes crept  Instead of hair, and their fierce temples bound.       He knowing well the miserable hags  Who tend the queen of endless woe, thus spake:  \"Mark thou each dire Erinnys. To the left  This is Megaera; on the right hand she,  Who wails, Alecto; and Tisiphone  I' th' midst.\"  This said, in silence he remain'd  Their breast they each one clawing tore; themselves  Smote with their palms, and such shrill clamour rais'd,  That to the bard I clung, suspicion-bound.  \"Hasten Medusa: so to adamant  Him shall we change;\" all looking down exclaim'd.  \"E'en when by Theseus' might assail'd, we took  No ill revenge.\"  \"Turn thyself round, and keep  Thy count'nance hid; for if the Gorgon dire  Be shown, and thou shouldst view it, thy return  Upwards would be for ever lost.\"  This said,  Himself my gentle master turn'd me round,  Nor trusted he my hands, but with his own  He also hid me.  Ye of intellect  Sound and entire, mark well the lore conceal'd  Under close texture of the mystic strain!       And now there came o'er the perturbed waves  Loud-crashing, terrible, a sound that made  Either shore tremble, as if of a wind  Impetuous, from conflicting vapours sprung,  That 'gainst some forest driving all its might,  Plucks off the branches, beats them down and hurls  Afar; then onward passing proudly sweeps  Its whirlwind rage, while beasts and shepherds fly.       Mine eyes he loos'd, and spake: \"And now direct  Thy visual nerve along that ancient foam,  There, thickest where the smoke ascends.\" As frogs  Before their foe the serpent, through the wave  Ply swiftly all, till at the ground each one  Lies on a heap; more than a thousand spirits  Destroy'd, so saw I fleeing before one  Who pass'd with unwet feet the Stygian sound.  He, from his face removing the gross air,  Oft his left hand forth stretch'd, and seem'd alone  By that annoyance wearied.  I perceiv'd  That he was sent from heav'n, and to my guide  Turn'd me, who signal made that I should stand  Quiet, and bend to him. Ah me!  how full  Of noble anger seem'd he!  To the gate  He came, and with his wand touch'd it, whereat  Open without impediment it flew.       \"Outcasts of heav'n!  O abject race and scorn'd!\"  Began he on the horrid grunsel standing,  \"Whence doth this wild excess of insolence  Lodge in you? wherefore kick you 'gainst that will  Ne'er frustrate of its end, and which so oft  Hath laid on you enforcement of your pangs?  What profits at the fays to but the horn?  Your Cerberus, if ye remember, hence  Bears still, peel'd of their hair, his throat and maw.\"       This said, he turn'd back o'er the filthy way,  And syllable to us spake none, but wore  The semblance of a man by other care  Beset, and keenly press'd, than thought of him  Who in his presence stands.  Then we our steps  Toward that territory mov'd, secure  After the hallow'd words.  We unoppos'd  There enter'd; and my mind eager to learn  What state a fortress like to that might hold,  I soon as enter'd throw mine eye around,  And see on every part wide-stretching space  Replete with bitter pain and torment ill.       As where Rhone stagnates on the plains of Arles,  Or as at Pola, near Quarnaro's gulf,  That closes Italy and laves her bounds,  The place is all thick spread with sepulchres;  So was it here, save what in horror here  Excell'd:  for 'midst the graves were scattered flames,  Wherewith intensely all throughout they burn'd,  That iron for no craft there hotter needs.       Their lids all hung suspended, and beneath  From them forth issu'd lamentable moans,  Such as the sad and tortur'd well might raise.       I thus:  \"Master! say who are these, interr'd  Within these vaults, of whom distinct we hear  The dolorous sighs?\"  He answer thus return'd:       \"The arch-heretics are here, accompanied  By every sect their followers; and much more,  Than thou believest, tombs are freighted:  like  With like is buried; and the monuments  Are different in degrees of heat. \"This said,  He to the right hand turning, on we pass'd  Betwixt the afflicted and the ramparts high.        CANTO X    NOW by a secret pathway we proceed,  Between the walls, that hem the region round,  And the tormented souls:  my master first,  I close behind his steps.  \"Virtue supreme!\"  I thus began; \"who through these ample orbs  In circuit lead'st me, even as thou will'st,  Speak thou, and satisfy my wish.  May those,  Who lie within these sepulchres, be seen?  Already all the lids are rais'd, and none  O'er them keeps watch.\"  He thus in answer spake  \"They shall be closed all, what-time they here  From Josaphat return'd shall come, and bring  Their bodies, which above they now have left.  The cemetery on this part obtain  With Epicurus all his followers,  Who with the body make the spirit die.  Here therefore satisfaction shall be soon  Both to the question ask'd, and to the wish,  Which thou conceal'st in silence.\"  I replied:  \"I keep not, guide belov'd! from thee my heart  Secreted, but to shun vain length of words,  A lesson erewhile taught me by thyself.\"       \"O Tuscan! thou who through the city of fire  Alive art passing, so discreet of speech!  Here please thee stay awhile. Thy utterance  Declares the place of thy nativity  To be that noble land, with which perchance  I too severely dealt.\"  Sudden that sound  Forth issu'd from a vault, whereat in fear  I somewhat closer to my leader's side  Approaching, he thus spake:  \"What dost thou?  Turn.  Lo, Farinata, there! who hath himself  Uplifted:  from his girdle upwards all  Expos'd behold him.\"  On his face was mine  Already fix'd; his breast and forehead there  Erecting, seem'd as in high scorn he held  E'en hell.  Between the sepulchres to him  My guide thrust me with fearless hands and prompt,  This warning added:  \"See thy words be clear!\"       He, soon as there I stood at the tomb's foot,  Ey'd me a space, then in disdainful mood  Address'd me:  \"Say, what ancestors were thine?\"       I, willing to obey him, straight reveal'd  The whole, nor kept back aught: whence he, his brow  Somewhat uplifting, cried:  \"Fiercely were they  Adverse to me, my party, and the blood  From whence I sprang:  twice therefore I abroad  Scatter'd them.\"  \"Though driv'n out, yet they each time  From all parts,\" answer'd I, \"return'd; an art  Which yours have shown, they are not skill'd to learn.\"       Then, peering forth from the unclosed jaw,  Rose from his side a shade, high as the chin,  Leaning, methought, upon its knees uprais'd.  It look'd around, as eager to explore  If there were other with me; but perceiving  That fond imagination quench'd, with tears  Thus spake:  \"If thou through this blind prison go'st.  Led by thy lofty genius and profound,  Where is my son? and wherefore not with thee?\"       I straight replied:  \"Not of myself I come,  By him, who there expects me, through this clime  Conducted, whom perchance Guido thy son  Had in contempt.\"  Already had his words  And mode of punishment read me his name,  Whence I so fully answer'd.  He at once  Exclaim'd, up starting, \"How! said'st thou he HAD?  No longer lives he?  Strikes not on his eye  The blessed daylight?\"  Then of some delay  I made ere my reply aware, down fell  Supine, not after forth appear'd he more.       Meanwhile the other, great of soul, near whom  I yet was station'd, chang'd not count'nance stern,  Nor mov'd the neck, nor bent his ribbed side.  \"And if,\" continuing the first discourse,  \"They in this art,\" he cried, \"small skill have shown,  That doth torment me more e'en than this bed.  But not yet fifty times shall be relum'd  Her aspect, who reigns here Queen of this realm,  Ere thou shalt know the full weight of that art.  So to the pleasant world mayst thou return,  As thou shalt tell me, why in all their laws,  Against my kin this people is so fell?\"       \"The slaughter and great havoc,\" I replied,  \"That colour'd Arbia's flood with crimson stain--  To these impute, that in our hallow'd dome  Such orisons ascend.\"  Sighing he shook  The head, then thus resum'd:  \"In that affray  I stood not singly, nor without just cause  Assuredly should with the rest have stirr'd;  But singly there I stood, when by consent  Of all, Florence had to the ground been raz'd,  The one who openly forbad the deed.\"       \"So may thy lineage find at last repose,\"  I thus adjur'd him, \"as thou solve this knot,  Which now involves my mind.  If right I hear,  Ye seem to view beforehand, that which time  Leads with him, of the present uninform'd.\"       \"We view, as one who hath an evil sight,\"  He answer'd, \"plainly, objects far remote:  So much of his large spendour yet imparts  The' Almighty Ruler; but when they approach  Or actually exist, our intellect  Then wholly fails, nor of your human state  Except what others bring us know we aught.  Hence therefore mayst thou understand, that all  Our knowledge in that instant shall expire,  When on futurity the portals close.\"       Then conscious of my fault, and by remorse  Smitten, I added thus:  \"Now shalt thou say  To him there fallen, that his offspring still  Is to the living join'd; and bid him know,  That if from answer silent I abstain'd,  'Twas that my thought was occupied intent  Upon that error, which thy help hath solv'd.\"       But now my master summoning me back  I heard, and with more eager haste besought  The spirit to inform me, who with him  Partook his lot.  He answer thus return'd:       \"More than a thousand with me here are laid  Within is Frederick, second of that name,  And the Lord Cardinal, and"]]]
