Here it was necessary for me to change my ship, for in the interests of  economy I was going by sea to Delagoa Bay, and thence by the cheap  railway journey into the Transvaal.  I sought out my cousin, who lived  in a fine house on the Berea, and found a comfortable lodging for the  three days of my stay there.  I made inquiries about Mr Laputa, but  could hear nothing.  There was no native minister of that name, said my  cousin, who was a great authority on all native questions.  I described  the man, but got no further light.  No one had seen or heard of such a  being, 'unless,' said my cousin, 'he is one of those American Ethiopian  rascals.'    My second task was to see the Durban manager of the firm which I had  undertaken to serve.  He was a certain Mr Colles, a big fat man, who  welcomed me in his shirt-sleeves, with a cigar in his mouth.  He  received me pleasantly, and took me home to dinner with him.    'Mr Mackenzie has written about you,' he said.  'I'll be quite frank  with you, Mr Crawfurd.  The firm is not exactly satisfied about the way  business has been going lately at Blaauwildebeestefontein. There's a  grand country up there, and a grand opportunity for the man who can  take it.  Japp, who is in charge, is an old man now and past his best,  but he has been long with the firm, and we don't want to hurt his  feelings.  When he goes, which must be pretty soon, you'll have a good  chance of the place, if you show yourself an active young fellow.'    He told me a great deal more about Blaauwildebeestefontein, principally  trading details.  Incidentally he let drop that Mr Japp had had several  assistants in the last few years.  I asked him why they had left, and  he hesitated.    'It's a lonely place, and they didn't like the life.  You see, there  are few white men near, and young fellows want society. They  complained, and were moved on.  But the firm didn't think the more of  them.'    I told him I had come out with the new schoolmaster.    'Yes,' he said reflectively, 'the school.  That's been vacant pretty  often lately.  What sort of fellow is this Wardlaw?  Will he stay, I  wonder?'    'From all accounts,' I said, 'Blaauwildebeestefontein does not seem  popular.'    'It isn't.  That's why we've got you out from home.  The colonial-born  doesn't find it fit in with his idea of comfort.  He wants society, and  he doesn't like too many natives.  There's nothing up there but natives  and a few back-veld Dutchmen with native blood in them.  You fellows  from home are less set on an easy life, or you wouldn't be here.'    There was something in Mr Colles's tone which made me risk another  question.    'What's the matter with the place?  There must be more wrong with it  than loneliness to make everybody clear out.  I have taken on this job,  and I mean to stick to it, so you needn't be afraid to tell me.'    The manager looked at me sharply.  'That's the way to talk, my lad.  You look as if you had a stiff back, so I'll be frank with you.  There  is something about the place.  It gives the ordinary man the jumps.  What it is, I don't know, and the men who come back don't know  themselves.  I want you to find out for me.  You'll be doing the firm  an enormous service if you can get on the track of it.  It may be the  natives, or it may be the takhaars, or it may be something else.  Only  old Japp can stick it out, and he's too old and doddering to care about  moving.  I want you to keep your eyes skinned, and write privately to  me if you want any help.  You're not out here for your health, I can  see, and here's a chance for you to get your foot on the ladder.    'Remember, I'm your friend,' he said to me again at the garden gate.  'Take my advice and lie very low.  Don't talk, don't meddle with drink,  learn all you can of the native jabber, but don't let on you understand  a word.  You're sure to get on the track of something.  Good-bye, my  boy,' and he waved a fat hand to me.    That night I embarked on a cargo-boat which was going round the coast  to Delagoa Bay.  It is a small world--at least for us far-wandering  Scots.  For who should I find when I got on board but my old friend Tam  Dyke, who was second mate on the vessel?  We wrung each other's hands,  and I answered, as best I could, his questions about Kirkcaple.  I had  supper with him in the cabin, and went on deck to see the moorings cast.    Suddenly there was a bustle on the quay, and a big man with a handbag  forced his way up the gangway.  The men who were getting ready to cast  off tried to stop him, but he elbowed his way forward, declaring he  must see the captain.  Tam went up to him and asked civilly if he had a  passage taken.  He admitted he had not, but said he would make it right  in two minutes with the captain himself.  The Rev. John Laputa, for  some reason of his own, was leaving Durban with more haste than he had  entered it.    I do not know what passed with the captain, but the minister got his  passage right enough, and Tam was even turned out of his cabin to make  room for him.  This annoyed my friend intensely.    'That black brute must be made of money, for he paid through the nose  for this, or I'm a Dutchman.  My old man doesn't take to his black  brethren any more than I do.  Hang it all, what are we coming to, when  we're turning into a blooming cargo boat for niggers?'    I had all too little of Tam's good company, for on the afternoon of the  second day we reached the little town of Lourenco Marques.  This was my  final landing in Africa, and I mind how eagerly I looked at the low,  green shores and the bush-covered slopes of the mainland.  We were  landed from boats while the ship lay out in the bay, and Tam came  ashore with me to spend the evening.  By this time I had lost every  remnant of homesickness.  I had got a job before me which promised  better things than colleging at Edinburgh, and I was as keen to get up  country now as I had been loth to leave England.  My mind being full of  mysteries, I scanned every Portuguese loafer on the quay as if he had  been a spy, and when Tam and I had had a bottle of Collates in a cafe I  felt that at last I had got to foreign parts and a new world.    Tam took me to supper with a friend of his, a Scot by the name of  Aitken, who was landing-agent for some big mining house on the Rand.  He hailed from Fife and gave me a hearty welcome, for he had heard my  father preach in his young days. Aitken was a strong, broad-shouldered  fellow who had been a sergeant in the Gordons, and during the war he  had done secret-service work in Delagoa.  He had hunted, too, and  traded up and down Mozambique, and knew every dialect of the Kaffirs.  He asked me where I was bound for, and when I told him there was the  same look in his eyes as I had seen with the Durban manager.    'You're going to a rum place, Mr Crawfurd,' he said.    'So I'm told.  Do you know anything about it?  You're not the first who  has looked queer when I've spoken the name.'    'I've never been there,' he said, 'though I've been pretty near it from  the Portuguese side.  That's the funny thing about  Blaauwildebeestefontein.  Everybody has heard of it, and nobody knows  it.'    'I wish you would tell me what you have heard.'    'Well, the natives are queer up thereaways.  There's some kind of a  holy place which every Kaffir from Algoa Bay to the Zambesi and away  beyond knows about.  When I've been hunting in the bush-veld I've often  met strings of Kaffirs from hundreds of miles distant, and they've all  been going or coming from Blaauwildebeestefontein.  It's like Mecca to  the Mohammedans, a place they go to on pilgrimage.  I've heard of an  old man up there who is believed to be two hundred years old. Anyway,  there's some sort of great witch or wizard living in the mountains.'    Aitken smoked in silence for a time; then he said, 'I'll tell you  another thing.  I believe there's a diamond mine.  I've often meant to  go up and look for it.'    Tam and I pressed him to explain, which he did slowly after his fashion.    'Did you ever hear of I.D.B.--illicit diamond broking?' he asked me.  'Well, it's notorious that the Kaffirs on the diamond fields get away  with a fair number of stones, and they are bought by Jew and Portuguese  traders.  It's against the law to deal in them, and when I was in the  intelligence here we used to have a lot of trouble with the vermin.  But I discovered that most of the stones came from natives in one part  of the country--more or less round Blaauwildebeestefontein--and I see  no reason to think that they had all been stolen from Kimberley or the  Premier.  Indeed some of the stones I got hold of were quite different  from any I had seen in South Africa before.  I shouldn't wonder if the  Kaffirs in the Zoutpansberg had struck some rich pipe, and had the  sense to keep quiet about it.  Maybe some day I'll take a run up to see  you and look into the matter.'    After this the talk turned on other topics till Tam, still nursing his  grievance, asked a question on his own account. 'Did you ever come  across a great big native parson called Laputa?  He came on board as we  were leaving Durban, and I had to turn out of my cabin for him.'  Tam  described him accurately but vindictively, and added that 'he was sure  he was up to no good.'    Aitken shook his head.  'No, I don't know the man.  You say he landed  here?  Well, I'll keep a look-out for him.  Big native parsons are not  so common.'    Then I asked about Henriques, of whom Tam knew nothing. I described his  face, his clothes, and his habits.  Aitken laughed uproariously.    'Tut, my man, most of the subjects of his Majesty the King of Portugal  would answer to that description.

And by the same  trail of thought we must give one or two of these Blue-Noses now and  then a cast on board with us to draw them out. \"Well, if you want to  read, you can go and turn in and take a book, and solitudinise to it,  and there is no one to disturb you. I actilly learned French in a  voyage to Calcutta, and German on my way home. I got enough for common  use. It warn't all pure gold; but it was kind of small change, and  answered every purpose of trade or travel. Oh, it's no use a talkin';  where time ain't the main object, there's nothin' like a sailin'  vessel to a man who ain't sea-sick, and such fellows ought to be  cloriformed, put to bed, and left there till the voyage is over. They  have no business to go to sea, if they are such fools as not to know  how to enjoy themselves.    \"Then sailors are characters; they are men of the world, there is  great self-reliance in them. They have to fight their way in life  through many trials and difficulties, and their trust is in God and  their own strong arm. They are so much in their own element, they seem  as if they were born on the sea, cradled on its billows, and, like  Mother Carey's chickens, delighted in its storms and mountain waves.  They walk, talk, and dress differently from landsmen. They straddle as  they pace the deck, so as to brace the body and keep their trowsers up  at the same time; their gait is loose, and their dress loose, and  their limbs loose; indeed, they are rather too fond of slack. They  climb like monkeys, and depend more on their paws than their legs.  They tumble up, but never down. They count, not by fingers, it is  tedious, but by hands; they put a part for the whole, and call  themselves hands, for they are paid for the use of them, and not their  heads.    \"Though they are two-handed they are not close-fisted fellows. They  despise science, but are fond of practical knowledge. When the sun is  over the foreyard, they know the time of day as well as the captain,  and call for their grog, and when they lay back their heads, and turn  up the bottom of the mug to the sky, they call it in derision taking  an observation. But though they have many characteristics in common,  there is an individuality in each that distinguishes him from the  rest. He stands out in bold relief--I by myself, I. He feels and  appreciates his importance. He knows no plural. The word 'our' belongs  to landsmen; 'my' is the sailor's phrase--my ship, my captain, my  messmate, my watch on deck, 'my eyes!' 'you lubber, don't you know  that's me?' I like to listen to their yarns and their jokes, and to  hear them sing their simple ditties. The odd mixture of manliness and  childishness--of boldness and superstitious fears; of preposterous  claims for wages and thoughtless extravagance; of obedience and  discontent--all goes to make the queer compound called 'Jack.' How  often have I laughed over the fun of the forecastle in these small  fore and aft packets of ourn! and I think I would back that place for  wit against any bar-room in New York or New Orleans, and I believe  they take the rag off of all creation.    \"But the cook is my favourite. He is a scientific man, and so skilful  in compounds, he generally goes by the name of doctor. I like the  daily consultation with him about dinner: not that I am an epicure;  but at sea, as the business of life is eating, it is as well to be  master of one's calling. Indeed, it appears to be a law of nature,  that those who have mouths should understand what to put in them. It  gratifies the doctor to confer with him, and who does it not please to  be considered a man of importance? He is therefore a member of the  Privy Council, and a more useful member he is too than many Right  Honourables I know of--who have more acres than ideas. The Board  assembles after breakfast, and a new dish is a great item in the  budget. It keeps people in good humour the rest of the day, and  affords topics for the table. To eat to support existence is only fit  for criminals. Bread and water will do that; but to support and  gratify nature at the same time is a noble effort of art, and well  deserves the thanks of mankind. The cook too enlivens the consultation  by telling marvellous stories about strange dishes he has seen. He has  eaten serpents with the Siamese, monkeys in the West Indies,  crocodiles and sloths in South America, and cats, rats, and dogs with  the Chinese; and of course, as nobody can contradict him, says they  are delicious. Like a salmon, you must give him the line, even if it  wearies you, before you bag him; but when you do bring him to land his  dishes are savoury. They have a relish that is peculiar to the sea,  for where there is no garden, vegetables are always most prized. The  glorious onion is duly valued, for as there is no mistress to be  kissed, who will dare to object to its aroma?    \"Then I like a Sunday at sea in a vessel like this, and a day like  this, when the men are all clean and tidy, and the bell rings for  prayers, and all hands are assembled aft to listen to the captain as  he reads the Church Service. It seems like a family scene. It reminds  me of dear old Minister and days gone by, when he used to call us  round him, and repeated to us the promise 'that when two or three were  gathered together in God's name, he would grant their request.' The  only difference is, sailors are more attentive and devout than  landsmen. They seem more conscious that they are in the Divine  presence. They have little to look upon but the heavens above and the  boundless ocean around them. Both seem made on purpose for them--the  sun to guide them by day, and the stars by night, the sea to bear them  on its bosom, and the breeze to waft them on their course. They feel  how powerless they are of themselves; how frail their bark; how  dependent they are on the goodness and mercy of their Creator, and  that it is He alone who can rule the tempest and control the stormy  deep. Their impressions are few, but they are strong. It is the world  that hardens the heart, and the ocean seems apart from it.    \"They are noble fellows, sailors, and I love them; but, Cutler, how  are they used, especially where they ought to be treated best, on  board of men-of-war? The moment a ship arrives in port, the anchor  cast and the sails furled--what dees the captain do? the popular  captain too, the idol of the men; he who is so kind and so fond of  them? Why, he calls them aft, and says, 'Here, my lads, here is lots  of cash for you, now be off ashore and enjoy yourselves.' And they  give three cheers for their noble commander--their good-hearted  officer--the sailor's friend--the jolly old blue jacket,--and they  bundle into the boats, and on to the beach, like school-boys. And  where do they go? Well, we won't follow them, for I never was in them  places where they do go, and so I can't describe them, and one thing I  must say, I never yet found any place answer the picture drawn of it.  But if half only of the accounts are true that I have heerd of them,  they must be the devil's own seminaries of vice--that's a fact. Every  mite and morsel as bad as the barrack scenes that we read of lately.    \"Well, at the end of a week back come the sailors. They have had a  glorious lark and enjoyed themselves beyond anything in the world, for  they are pale, sick, sleepy, tired out, cleaned out, and kicked out,  with black eyes, broken heads, swelled cheeks, minus a few teeth, half  their clothes, and all their money.    \"'What,' says the captain, 'what's the matter with you, Tom Marlin,  that you limp so like a lame duck?'    \"'Nothing, your honour,' says Tom, twitching his forelock, and making  a scrape with his hind leg, 'nothing, your honour, but a scratch from  a bagganet.'    \"'What! a fight with the soldiers, eh? The cowardly rascals to use  their side arms!'    \"'We cleared the house of them, Sir, in no time.'    \"'That's right. Now go below, my lads, and turn in and get a good  sleep. I like to see my lambs enjoy themselves. It does my heart  good.'    \"And yet, Cutler, that man is said to be a father to his crew.\"    \"Slick,\" said Cutler, \"what a pity it is you wouldn't always talk that  way!\" Now if there is any created thing that makes me mad, it is to  have a feller look admiren at me, when I utter a piece of plain common  sense like that, and turn up the whites of his eyes like a duck in  thunder, as much as to say, what a pity it is you weren't broughten up  a preacher. It ryles me considerable, I tell you.    \"Cutler,\" said I, \"did you ever see a colt in a pasture, how he would  race and chase round the field, head, ears, and tail up, and stop  short, snort as if he had seen the ghost of a bridle, and off again  hot foot?\"    \"Yes,\" said he, \"I have, but you are not a colt, nor a boy either.\"    \"Well, did you ever see a horse when unharnessed from a little, light  waggon, and turned out to grass, do nearly the same identical thing,  and kick up his heels like mad, as much as to say, I am a free nigger  now?\"    \"Well, I have,\" said he.    \"Stop,\" said I, a touchin' of him on his arm; \"what in the world is  that?\" and I pointed over the taffrail to the weather-bow.    \"Porpoises,\" said he.    \"What are they a doin' of?\"    \"Sportin' of themselves.\"    \"Exactly,\" sais I, \"and do you place man below the beasts of the field  and the fishes of the sea?
