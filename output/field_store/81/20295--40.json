[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5308"],[0,"The Paradise Mystery (#5)"],[1,"a postern  door in the west porch--so hastily that Bryce checked himself to look at  him. And though they were twenty yards apart, Bryce saw that Ransford's  face was very pale, almost to whiteness, and that he was unmistakably  agitated. Instantly he connected that agitation with the man who had  come to the surgery door.    \"They've met!\" mused Bryce, and stopped, staring after Ransford's  retreating figure. \"Now what is it in that man's mere presence that's  upset Ransford? He looks like a man who's had a nasty, unexpected  shock--a bad 'un!\"    He remained standing in the archway, gazing after the retreating figure,  until Ransford had disappeared within his own garden; still wondering  and speculating, but not about his own affairs, he turned across  Paradise at last and made his way towards the farther corner. There was  a little wicket-gate there, set in the ivied wall; as Bryce opened it,  a man in the working dress of a stone-mason, whom he recognized as being  one of the master-mason's staff, came running out of the bushes.  His face, too, was white, and his eyes were big with excitement. And  recognizing Bryce, he halted, panting.    \"What is it, Varner?\" asked Bryce calmly. \"Something happened?\"    The man swept his hand across his forehead as if he were dazed, and then  jerked his thumb over his shoulder.    \"A man!\" he gasped. \"Foot of St. Wrytha's Stair there, doctor. Dead--or  if not dead, near it. I saw it!\"    Bryce seized Varner's arm and gave it a shake.    \"You saw--what?\" he demanded.    \"Saw him--fall. Or rather--flung!\" panted Varner. \"Somebody--couldn't  see who, nohow--flung him right through yon doorway, up there. He fell  right over the steps--crash!\" Bryce looked over the tops of the yews and  cypresses at the doorway in the clerestory to which Varner pointed--a  low, open archway gained by the half-ruinous stair. It was forty feet at  least from the ground.    \"You saw him--thrown!\" he exclaimed. \"Thrown--down there? Impossible,  man!\"    \"Tell you I saw it!\" asserted Varner doggedly. \"I was looking at one  of those old tombs yonder--somebody wants some repairs doing--and the  jackdaws were making such a to-do up there by the roof I glanced up at  them. And I saw this man thrown through that door--fairly flung through  it! God!--do you think I could mistake my own eyes?\"    \"Did you see who flung him?\" asked Bryce.    \"No; I saw a hand--just for one second, as it might be--by the edge of  the doorway,\" answered Varner. \"I was more for watching him! He sort  of tottered for a second on the step outside the door, turned over and  screamed--I can hear it now!--and crashed down on the flags beneath.\"    \"How long since?\" demanded Bryce.    \"Five or six minutes,\" said Varner. \"I rushed to him--I've been doing  what I could. But I saw it was no good, so I was running for help--\"    Bryce pushed him towards the bushes by which they were standing.    \"Take me to him,\" he said. \"Come on!\"    Varner turned back, making a way through the cypresses. He led Bryce to  the foot of the great wall of the nave. There in the corner formed by  the angle of nave and transept, on a broad pavement of flagstones, lay  the body of a man crumpled up in a curiously twisted position. And with  one glance, even before he reached it, Bryce knew what body it was--that  of the man who had come, shyly and furtively, to Ransford's door.    \"Look!\" exclaimed Varner, suddenly pointing. \"He's stirring!\"    Bryce, whose gaze was fastened on the twisted figure, saw a slight  movement which relaxed as suddenly as it had occurred. Then came  stillness. \"That's the end!\" he muttered. \"The man's dead! I'll  guarantee that before I put a hand on him. Dead enough!\" he went on, as  he reached the body and dropped on one knee by it. \"His neck's broken.\"    The mason bent down and looked, half-curiously, half-fearfully, at the  dead man. Then he glanced upward--at the open door high above them in  the walls.    \"It's a fearful drop, that, sir,\" he said. \"And he came down with such  violence. You're sure it's over with him?\"    \"He died just as we came up,\" answered Bryce. \"That movement we saw was  the last effort--involuntary, of course. Look here, Varner!--you'll have  to get help. You'd better fetch some of the cathedral people--some of  the vergers. No!\" he broke off suddenly, as the low strains of an organ  came from within the great building. \"They're just beginning the morning  service--of course, it's ten o'clock. Never mind them--go straight to  the police. Bring them back--I'll stay here.\"    The mason turned off towards the gateway of the Close, and while  the strains of the organ grew louder, Bryce bent over the dead man,  wondering what had really happened. Thrown from an open doorway in the  clerestory over St. Wrytha's Stair?--it seemed almost impossible! But a  sudden thought struck him: supposing two men, wishing to talk in privacy  unobserved, had gone up into the clerestory of the Cathedral--as  they easily could, by more than one door, by more than one stair--and  supposing they had quarrelled, and one of them had flung or pushed  the other through the door above--what then? And on the heels of that  thought hurried another--this man, now lying dead, had come to the  surgery, seeking Ransford, and had subsequently gone away, presumably  in search of him, and Bryce himself had just seen Ransford, obviously  agitated and pale of cheek, leaving the west porch; what did it all  mean? what was the apparently obvious inference to be drawn? Here was  the stranger dead--and Varner was ready to swear that he had seen  him thrown, flung violently, through the door forty feet above. That  was--murder! Then--who was the murderer?    Bryce looked carefully and narrowly around him. Now that Varner had gone  away, there was not a human being in sight, nor anywhere near, so far as  he knew. On one side of him and the dead man rose the grey walls of nave  and transept; on the other, the cypresses and yews rising amongst the  old tombs and monuments. Assuring himself that no one was near, no eye  watching, he slipped his hand into the inner breast pocket of the dead  man's smart morning coat. Such a man must carry papers--papers would  reveal something. And Bryce wanted to know anything--anything that would  give information and let him into whatever secret there might be between  this unlucky stranger and Ransford.    But the breast pocket was empty; there was no pocket-book there; there  were no papers there. Nor were there any papers elsewhere in the other  pockets which he hastily searched: there was not even a card with a name  on it. But he found a purse, full of money--banknotes, gold, silver--and  in one of its compartments a scrap of paper folded curiously, after the  fashion of the cocked-hat missives of another age in which envelopes had  not been invented. Bryce hurriedly unfolded this, and after one glance  at its contents, made haste to secrete it in his own pocket. He had only  just done this and put back the purse when he heard Varner's voice, and  a second later the voice of Inspector Mitchington, a well-known police  official. And at that Bryce sprang to his feet, and when the mason and  his companions emerged from the bushes was standing looking thoughtfully  at the dead man. He turned to Mitchington with a shake of the head.    \"Dead!\" he said in a hushed voice. \"Died as we got to him. Broken--all  to pieces, I should say--neck and spine certainly. I suppose Varner's  told you what he saw.\"    Mitchington, a sharp-eyed, dark-complexioned man, quick of movement,  nodded, and after one glance at the body, looked up at the open doorway  high above them.    \"That the door?\" he asked, turning to Varner. \"And--it was open?\"    \"It's always open,\" answered Varner. \"Least-ways, it's been open, like  that, all this spring, to my knowledge.\"    \"What is there behind it?\" inquired Mitchington.    \"Sort of gallery, that runs all round the nave,\" replied Varner.  \"Clerestory gallery--that's what it is. People can go up there and walk  around--lots of 'em do--tourists, you know. There's two or three ways up  to it--staircases in the turrets.\"    Mitchington turned to one of the two constables who had followed him.    \"Let Varner show you the way up there,\" he said. \"Go quietly--don't  make any fuss--the morning service is just beginning. Say nothing to  anybody--just take a quiet look around, along that gallery, especially  near the door there--and come back here.\" He looked down at the dead man  again as the mason and the constable went away. \"A stranger, I should  think, doctor--tourist, most likely. But--thrown down! That man Varner  is positive. That looks like foul play.\"    \"Oh, there's no doubt of that!\" asserted Bryce. \"You'll have to go  into that pretty deeply. But the inside of the Cathedral's like a  rabbit-warren, and whoever threw the man through that doorway no doubt  knew how to slip away unobserved. Now, you'll have to remove the body to  the mortuary, of course--but just let me fetch Dr. Ransford first.  I'd like some other medical man than myself to see him before he's  moved--I'll have him here in five minutes.\"    He turned away through the bushes and emerging upon the Close ran across  the lawns in the direction of the house which he had left not twenty  minutes before. He had but one idea as he ran--he wanted to see Ransford  face to face with the dead man--wanted to watch him, to observe him,  to see how he looked, how he behaved. Then he, Bryce, would  know--something.    But he was to know something before that. He opened the door of the  surgery suddenly, but with his usual quietness of touch. And on the  threshold he paused. Ransford, the very picture of despair, stood just  within, his face convulsed, beating one hand upon the other.          CHAPTER IV. THE ROOM AT THE MITRE      In the few seconds which elapsed before Ransford recognized Bryce's  presence, Bryce took a careful, if"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5311"],[0,"Parnassus on Wheels (#5)"],[1," dust. First thing you  know I'll sell half a dozen books that put the love of life into  them, and they don't forget Parnassus in a hurry. Take O. Henry, for  instance--there isn't anybody so dog-gone sleepy that he won't enjoy  that man's stories. He understood life, you bet, and he could write  it down with all its little twists. I've spent an evening reading O.  Henry and Wilkie Collins to people and had them buy out all their  books I had and clamour for more.\"    \"What do you do in winter?\" I asked--a practical question, as most  of mine are.    \"That depends on where I am when bad weather sets in,\" said Mr.  Mifflin. \"Two winters I was down south and managed to keep Parnassus  going all through the season. Otherwise, I just lay up wherever I  am. I've never found it hard to get lodging for Peg and a job for  myself, if I had to have them. Last winter I worked in a bookstore  in Boston. Winter before, I was in a country drugstore down in  Pennsylvania. Winter before that, I tutored a couple of small boys  in English literature. Winter before that, I was a steward on a  steamer; you see how it goes. I've had a fairly miscellaneous  experience. As far as I can see, a man who's fond of books never  need starve! But this winter I'm planning to live with my brother in  Brooklyn and slog away at my book. Lord, how I've pondered over that  thing! Long summer afternoons I've sat here, jogging along in the  dust, thinking it out until it seemed as if my forehead would burst.  You see, my idea is that the common people--in the country, that  is--never have had any chance to get hold of books, and never have  had any one to explain what books can mean. It's all right for  college presidents to draw up their five-foot shelves of great  literature, and for the publishers to advertise sets of their  Linoleum Classics, but what the people need is the good, homely,  honest stuff--something that'll stick to their ribs--make them laugh  and tremble and feel sick to think of the littleness of this popcorn  ball spinning in space without ever even getting a hot-box! And  something that'll spur 'em on to keep the hearth well swept and the  wood pile split into kindling and the dishes washed and dried and  put away. Any one who can get the country people to read something  worth while is doing his nation a real service. And that's what  this caravan of culture aspires to.... You must be weary of this  harangue! Does the Sage of Redfield ever run on like that?\"    \"Not to me,\" I said. \"He's known me so long that he thinks of me as  a kind of animated bread-baking and cake-mixing machine. I guess he  doesn't put much stock in my judgment in literary matters. But he  puts his digestion in my hands without reserve. There's Mason's  farm over there. I guess we'd better sell them some books--hadn't  we? Just for a starter.\"    We turned into the lane that runs up to the Mason farmhouse. Bock  trotted on ahead--very stiff on his legs and his tail gently  wagging--to interview the mastiff, and Mrs. Mason who was sitting  on the porch, peeling potatoes, laid down the pan. She's a big,  buxom woman with jolly, brown eyes like a cow's.    \"For heaven's sake, Miss McGill,\" she called out in a cheerful  voice--\"I'm glad to see you. Got a lift, did you?\"    She hadn't really noticed the inscription on Parnassus, and thought  it was a regular huckster's wagon.    \"Well, Mrs. Mason,\" I said, \"I've gone into the book business. This  is Mr. Mifflin. I've bought out his stock. We've come to sell you  some books.\"    She laughed. \"Go on, Helen,\" she said, \"you can't kid me! I bought  a whole set of books last year from an agent--'The World's Great  Funeral Orations'--twenty volumes. Sam and I ain't read more'n the  first volume yet. It's awful uneasy reading!\"    Mifflin jumped down, and raised the side flap of the wagon. Mrs.  Mason came closer. I was tickled to see how the little man perked  up at the sight of a customer. Evidently selling books was meat  and drink to him.    \"Madam,\" he said, \"'Funeral Orations' (bound in sackcloth, I  suppose?) have their place, but Miss McGill and I have got some real  books here to which I invite your attention. Winter will be here  soon, and you will need something more cheerful to beguile your  evenings. Very possibly you have growing children who would profit  by a good book or two. A book of fairy tales for the little girl I  see on the porch? Or stories of inventors for that boy who is about  to break his neck jumping from the barn loft? Or a book about road  making for your husband? Surely there is something here you need?  Miss McGill probably knows your tastes.\"    That little red-bearded man was surely a born salesman. How he  guessed that Mr. Mason was the road commissioner in our township,  goodness only knows. Perhaps it was just a lucky shot. By this  time most of the family had gathered around the van, and I saw Mr.  Mason coming from the barn with his twelve-year-old Billy.    \"Sam,\" shouted Mrs. Mason, \"here's Miss McGill turned book pedlar  and got a preacher with her!\"    \"Hello, Miss McGill,\" said Mr. Mason. He is a big, slow-moving man  of great gravity and solidity. \"Where's Andrew?\"    \"Andrew's coming home for roast pork and apple sauce,\" I said, \"and  I'm going off to sell books for a living. Mr. Mifflin here is  teaching me how. We've got a book on road mending that's just what  you need.\"    I saw Mr. and Mrs. Mason exchange glances. Evidently they thought me  crazy. I began to wonder whether we had made a mistake in calling on  people I knew so well. The situation was a trifle embarrassing.    Mr. Mifflin came to the rescue.    \"Don't be alarmed, sir,\" he said to Mr. Mason. \"I haven't kidnapped  Miss McGill.\" (As he is about half my size this was amusing.) \"We  are trying to increase her brother's income by selling his books for  him. As a matter of fact, we have a wager with him that we can sell  fifty copies of 'Happiness and Hayseed' before Hallowe'en. Now I'm  sure your sporting instinct will assist us by taking at least one  copy. Andrew McGill is probably the greatest author in this State,  and every taxpayer ought to possess his books. May I show you a  copy?\"    \"That sounds reasonable,\" said Mr. Mason, and he almost smiled.  \"What do you say, Emma, think we better buy a book or two? You know  those 'Funeral Orations.'...\" \"Well,\" said Emma, \"you know we've  always said we ought to read one of Andrew McGill's books but we  didn't rightly know how to get hold of one. That fellow that sold us  the funeral speeches didn't seem to know about 'em. I tell you what,  you folks better stop and have dinner with us and you can tell us  what we'd ought to buy. I'm just ready to put the potatoes on the  stove now.\"    I must confess that the prospect of sitting down to a meal I hadn't  cooked myself appealed to me strongly; and I was keen to see what  kind of grub Mrs. Mason provided for her household; but I was  afraid that if we dallied there too long Andrew would be after us. I  was about to say that we would have to be getting on, and couldn't  stay; but apparently the zest of expounding his philosophy to new  listeners was too much for Mifflin. I heard him saying:    \"That's mighty kind of you, Mrs. Mason, and we'd like very much to  stay. Perhaps I can put Peg up in your barn for a while. Then we can  tell you all about our books.\" And to my amazement I found myself  chiming in with assent.    Mifflin certainly surpassed himself at dinner. The fact that  Mrs. Mason's hot biscuits tasted of saleratus gave me far less  satisfaction than it otherwise would, because I was absorbed in  listening to the little vagabond's talk. Mr. Mason came to the table  grumbling something about his telephone being out of order--(I  wondered whether he had been trying to get Andrew on the wire; he  was a little afraid that I was being run away with, I think)--but  he was soon won over by the current of the little man's cheery wit.  Nothing daunted Mifflin. He talked to the old grandmother about  quilts; offered to cut off a strip of his necktie for her new  patchwork; and told all about the illustrated book on quilts that he  had in the van. He discussed cookery and the Bible with Mrs. Mason;  and she being a leading light in the Greenbriar Sunday School, was  pleasantly scandalized by his account of the best detective stories  in the Old Testament. With Mr. Mason he was all scientific farming,  chemical manures, macadam roads, and crop rotation; and to little  Billy (who sat next him) he told extraordinary yarns about Daniel  Boone, Davy Crockett, Kit Carson, Buffalo Bill, and what not.  Honestly I was amazed at the little man. He was as genial as a  cricket on the hearth, and yet every now and then his earnestness  would break through. I don't wonder he was a success at selling  books. That man could sell clothes pins or Paris garters, I guess,  and make them seem romantic.    \"You know, Mr. Mason,\" he said, \"you certainly owe it to these  youngsters of yours to put a few really good books into their hands.  City kids have the libraries to go to, but in the country there's  only old Doc Hostetter's Almanac and the letters written by ladies  with backache telling how Peruna did for them. Give this boy and  girl of yours a few good books and you're starting them on the  double-track, block-signal line to happiness. Now there's 'Little  Women'--that girl of yours can learn more about real girlhood and  fine womanhood out of that book than from a year's paper dolls in  the attic.\"    \"That's right, Pa,\" assented Mrs. Mason. (\"Go on with your meal,  Professor, the meat'll be cold.\") She was completely won by the  travelling bookseller, and had given him the highest title of honour  in her ken. \"Why, I read that story when I was a girl, and I still  remember it. That's better readin' for Dorothy than those funeral  speeches, I reckon. I believe the Professor's right: we'd ought to  have more books"]]]
