Above you, too, doth hang the tyrant's sword.  You, too, have striven to alienate the land  From Austria. This was all my father's crime:  You share his guilt and may his punishment.    STAUFFACHER (to FURST).  Do then resolve! I am prepared to follow.    FURST.  First let us learn what steps the noble lords  Von Sillinen and Attinghaus propose.  Their names would rally thousands in the cause.    MELCHTHAL.  Is there a name within the Forest Mountains  That carries more respect than thine--and thine?  To names like these the people cling for help  With confidence--such names are household words.  Rich was your heritage of manly virtue,  And richly have you added to its stores.  What need of nobles? Let us do the work  Ourselves. Although we stood alone, methinks  We should be able to maintain our rights.    STAUFFACHER.  The nobles' wrongs are not so great as ours.  The torrent that lays waste the lower grounds  Hath not ascended to the uplands yet.  But let them see the country once in arms  They'll not refuse to lend a helping hand.    FURST.  Were there an umpire 'twixt ourselves and Austria,  Justice and law might then decide our quarrel.  But our oppressor is our emperor, too,  And judge supreme. 'Tis God must help us, then,  And our own arm! Be yours the task to rouse  The men of Schwytz; I'll rally friends in Uri.  But whom are we to send to Unterwald?    MELCHTHAL.  Thither send me. Whom should it more concern?    FURST.  No, Melchthal, no; thou art my guest, and I  Must answer for thy safety.    MELCHTHAL.                 Let me go.  I know each forest track and mountain pass;  Friends too I'll find, be sure, on every hand,  To give me willing shelter from the foe.    STAUFFACHER.  Nay, let him go; no traitors harbor there:  For tyranny is so abhorred in Unterwald  No minions can be found to work her will.  In the low valleys, too, the Alzeller  Will gain confederates and rouse the country.    MELCHTHAL.  But how shall we communicate, and not  Awaken the suspicion of the tyrants?    STAUFFACHER.  Might we not meet at Brunnen or at Treib,  Hard by the spot where merchant-vessels land?    FURST.  We must not go so openly to work.  Hear my opinion. On the lake's left bank,  As we sail hence to Brunnen, right against  The Mytenstein, deep-hidden in the wood  A meadow lies, by shepherds called the Rootli,  Because the wood has been uprooted there.  'Tis where our Canton boundaries verge on yours;--       [To MELCHTHAL.    Your boat will carry you across from Schwytz.       [To STAUFFACHER.    Thither by lonely by-paths let us wend  At midnight and deliberate o'er our plans.  Let each bring with him there ten trusty men,  All one at heart with us; and then we may  Consult together for the general weal,  And, with God's guidance, fix our onward course.    STAUFFACHER.  So let it be. And now your true right hand!  Yours, too, young man! and as we now three men  Among ourselves thus knit our hands together  In all sincerity and truth, e'en so  Shall we three Cantons, too, together stand  In victory and defeat, in life and death.    FURST and MELCHTHAL.  In life and death.      [They hold their hands clasped together for some moments in silence.    MELCHTHAL.            Alas, my old blind father!  Thou canst no more behold the day of freedom;  But thou shalt hear it. When from Alp to Alp  The beacon-fires throw up their flaming signs,  And the proud castles of the tyrants fall,  Into thy cottage shall the Switzer burst,  Bear the glad tidings to thine ear, and o'er  Thy darkened way shall Freedom's radiance pour.          ACT II.    SCENE I.       The Mansion of the BARON OF ATTINGHAUSEN. A Gothic hall,     decorated with escutcheons and helmets. The BARON, a     gray-headed man, eighty-five years old, tall, and of a     commanding mien, clad in a furred pelisse, and leaning     on a staff tipped with chamois horn. KUONI and six hinds     standing round him, with rakes and scythes. ULRICH OF RUDENZ     enters in the costume of a knight.    RUDENZ.  Uncle, I'm here! Your will?    ATTINGHAUSEN.                 First let me share,  After the ancient custom of our house,  The morning-cup with these my faithful servants!       [He drinks from a cup, which is then passed round.    Time was I stood myself in field and wood,  With mine own eyes directing all their toil,  Even as my banner led them in the fight,  Now I am only fit to play the steward;  And, if the genial sun come not to me,  I can no longer seek it on the mountains.  Thus slowly, in an ever-narrowing sphere,  I move on to the narrowest and the last,  Where all life's pulses cease. I now am but  The shadow of my former self, and that  Is fading fast--'twill soon be but a name.    KUONI (offering RUDENZ the cup).  A pledge, young master!     [RUDENZ hesitates to take the cup.               Nay, sir, drink it off!  One cup, one heart! You know our proverb, sir!    ATTINGHAUSEN.  Go, children, and at eve, when work is done,  We'll meet and talk the country's business over.                     [Exeunt Servants.    Belted and plumed, and all thy bravery on!  Thou art for Altdorf--for the castle, boy?    RUDENZ.  Yes, uncle. Longer may I not delay----    ATTINGHAUSEN (sitting down).  Why in such haste? Say, are thy youthful hours  Doled in such niggard measure that thou must  Be chary of then to thy aged uncle?    RUDENZ.  I see, my presence is not needed here,  I am but as a stranger in this house.    ATTINGHAUSEN (gazes fixedly at him for a considerable time).  Alas, thou art indeed! Alas, that home  To thee has grown so strange! Oh, Uly! Uly!  I scarce do know thee now, thus decked in silks,  The peacock's feather [9] flaunting in thy cap,  And purple mantle round thy shoulders flung;  Thou lookest upon the peasant with disdain,  And takest with a blush his honest greeting.    RUDENZ.  All honor due to him I gladly pay,  But must deny the right he would usurp.    ATTINGHAUSEN.  The sore displeasure of the king is resting  Upon the land, and every true man's heart  Is full of sadness for the grievous wrongs  We suffer from our tyrants. Thou alone  Art all unmoved amid the general grief.  Abandoning thy friends, thou takest thy stand  Beside thy country's foes, and, as in scorn  Of our distress, pursuest giddy joys,  Courting the smiles of princes, all the while  Thy country bleeds beneath their cruel scourge.    RUDENZ.  The land is sore oppressed; I know it, uncle.  But why? Who plunged it into this distress?  A word, one little easy word, might buy  Instant deliverance from such dire oppression,  And win the good-will of the emperor.  Woe unto those who seal the people's eyes,  And make them adverse to their country's good;  The men who, for their own vile, selfish ends,  Are seeking to prevent the Forest States  From swearing fealty to Austria's house,  As all the countries round about have done.  It fits their humor well, to take their seats  Amid the nobles on the Herrenbank; [10]  They'll have the Caesar for their lord, forsooth,  That is to say, they'll have no lord at all.    ATTINGHAUSEN.  Must I hear this, and from thy lips, rash boy!    RUDENZ.  You urged me to this answer. Hear me out.  What, uncle, is the character you've stooped  To fill contentedly through life? Have you  No higher pride, than in these lonely wilds  To be the Landamman or Banneret, [11]  The petty chieftain of a shepherd race?  How! Were it not a far more glorious choice  To bend in homage to our royal lord,  And swell the princely splendors of his court,  Than sit at home, the peer of your own vassals,  And share the judgment-seat with vulgar clowns?    ATTINGHAUSEN.  Ah, Uly, Uly; all too well I see,  The tempter's voice has caught thy willing ear,  And poured its subtle poison in thy heart.    RUDENZ.  Yes, I conceal it not. It doth offend  My inmost soul to hear the stranger's gibes,  That taunt us with the name of \"Peasant Nobles.\"  Think you the heart that's stirring here can brook,  While all the young nobility around  Are reaping honor under Hapsburg's banner,  That I should loiter, in inglorious ease,  Here on the heritage my fathers left,  And, in the dull routine of vulgar toil,  Lose all life's glorious spring? In other lands  Deeds are achieved. A world of fair renown  Beyond these mountains stirs in martial pomp.  My helm and shield are rusting in the hall;  The martial trumpet's spirit-stirring blast,  The herald's call, inviting to the lists,  Rouse not the echoes of these vales, where naught  Save cowherd's horn and cattle-bell is heard,  In one unvarying, dull monotony.    ATTINGHAUSEN.  Deluded boy, seduced by empty show!  Despise the land that gave thee birth! Ashamed  Of the good ancient customs of thy sires!  The day will come, when thou, with burning tears,  Wilt long for home, and for thy native hills,  And that dear melody of tuneful herds,  Which now, in proud disgust, thou dost despise!  A day when thou wilt drink its tones in sadness,  Hearing their music in a foreign land.  Oh! potent is the spell that binds to home!  No, no, the cold, false world is not for thee.  At the proud court, with thy true heart thou wilt  Forever feel a stranger among strangers.  The world asks virtues of far other stamp  Than thou hast learned within these simple vales.  But go--go thither; barter thy free soul,  Take land in fief, become a prince's vassal,  Where thou might'st be lord paramount, and prince  Of all thine own unburdened heritage!  O, Uly, Uly, stay among thy people!  Go not to Altdorf. Oh, abandon not  The sacred cause of thy wronged native land!  I am the last of all my race. My name  Ends with me. Yonder hang my helm and shield;  They will be buried with me in the grave. [12]  And must I think, when yielding up my breath,  That thou but wait'st the closing of mine eyes,  To stoop thy knee to this new feudal court,  And take in vassalage"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6791"],[0,"Mary Stuart: A Tragedy (#5)"],[1,"people  In liberty and justice; men, whose names  I need but mention to dispel each doubt,  Each mean suspicion which is raised against them?  Stands not the reverend primate at their head,  The pious shepherd of his faithful people,  The learned Talbot, keeper of the seals,  And Howard, who commands our conquering fleets?  Say, then, could England's sovereign do more  Than, out of all the monarchy, elect  The very noblest, and appoint them judges  In this great suit? And were it probable  That party hatred could corrupt one heart;  Can forty chosen men unite to speak  A sentence just as passion gives command?    MARY (after a short pause).  I am struck dumb by that tongue's eloquence,  Which ever was so ominous to me.  And how shall I, a weak, untutored woman,  Cope with so subtle, learned an orator?  Yes truly; were these lords as you describe them,  I must be mute; my cause were lost indeed,  Beyond all hope, if they pronounce me guilty.  But, sir, these names, which you are pleased to praise,  These very men, whose weight you think will crush me,  I see performing in the history  Of these dominions very different parts:  I see this high nobility of England,  This grave majestic senate of the realm,  Like to an eastern monarch's vilest slaves,  Flatter my uncle Henry's sultan fancies:  I see this noble, reverend House of Lords,  Venal alike with the corrupted Commons,  Make statutes and annul them, ratify  A marriage and dissolve it, as the voice  Of power commands: to-day it disinherits,  And brands the royal daughters of the realm  With the vile name of bastards, and to-morrow  Crowns them as queens, and leads them to the throne.  I see them in four reigns, with pliant conscience,  Four times abjure their faith; renounce the pope  With Henry, yet retain the old belief;  Reform themselves with Edward; hear the mass  Again with Mary; with Elizabeth,  Who governs now, reform themselves again.    BURLEIGH.  You say you are not versed in England's laws,  You seem well read, methinks, in her disasters.    MARY.  And these men are my judges?     [As LORD BURLEIGH seems to wish to speak.                 My lord treasurer,  Towards you I will be just, be you but just  To me. 'Tis said that you consult with zeal  The good of England, and of England's queen;  Are honest, watchful, indefatigable;  I will believe it. Not your private ends,  Your sovereign and your country's weal alone,  Inspire your counsels and direct your deeds.  Therefore, my noble lord, you should the more  Distrust your heart; should see that you mistake not  The welfare of the government for justice.  I do not doubt, besides yourself, there are  Among my judges many upright men:  But they are Protestants, are eager all  For England's quiet, and they sit in judgment  On me, the Queen of Scotland, and the papist.  It is an ancient saying, that the Scots  And England to each other are unjust;  And hence the rightful custom that a Scot  Against an Englishman, or Englishman  Against a Scot, cannot be heard in judgment.  Necessity prescribed this cautious law;  Deep policy oft lies in ancient customs:  My lord, we must respect them. Nature cast  Into the ocean these two fiery nations  Upon this plank, and she divided it  Unequally, and bade them fight for it.  The narrow bed of Tweed alone divides  These daring spirits; often hath the blood  Of the contending parties dyed its waves.  Threatening, and sword in hand, these thousand years,  From both its banks they watch their rival's motions,  Most vigilant and true confederates,  With every enemy of the neighbor state.  No foe oppresses England, but the Scot  Becomes his firm ally; no civil war  Inflames the towns of Scotland, but the English  Add fuel to the fire: this raging hate  Will never be extinguished till, at last,  One parliament in concord shall unite them,  One common sceptre rule throughout the isle.    BURLEIGH.  And from a Stuart, then, should England hope  This happiness?    MARY.           Oh! why should I deny it?  Yes, I confess, I cherished the fond hope;  I thought myself the happy instrument  To join in freedom, 'neath the olive's shade,  Two generous realms in lasting happiness!  I little thought I should become the victim  Of their old hate, their long-lived jealousy;  And the sad flames of that unhappy strife,  I hoped at last to smother, and forever:  And, as my ancestor, great Richmond, joined  The rival roses after bloody contest,  To join in peace the Scotch and English crowns.    BURLEIGH.  An evil way you took to this good end,  To set the realm on fire, and through the flames  Of civil war to strive to mount the throne.    MARY.  I wished not that:--I wished it not, by Heaven!  When did I strive at that? Where are your proofs?    BURLEIGH.  I came not hither to dispute; your cause  Is no more subject to a war of words.  The great majority of forty voices  Hath found that you have contravened the law  Last year enacted, and have now incurred  Its penalty.       [Producing the verdict.    MARY.         Upon this statute, then,  My lord, is built the verdict of my judges?    BURLEIGH (reading).  Last year it was enacted, \"If a plot  Henceforth should rise in England, in the name  Or for the benefit of any claimant  To England's crown, that justice should be done  On such pretender, and the guilty party  Be prosecuted unto death.\" Now, since  It has been proved----    MARY.             Lord Burleigh, I can well  Imagine that a law expressly aimed  At me, and framed to compass my destruction  May to my prejudice be used. Oh! Woe  To the unhappy victim, when the tongue  That frames the law shall execute the sentence.  Can you deny it, sir, that this same statute  Was made for my destruction, and naught else?    BURLEIGH.  It should have acted as a warning to you:  By your imprudence it became a snare.  You saw the precipice which yawned before you;  Yet, truly warned, you plunged into the deep.  With Babington, the traitor, and his bands  Of murderous companions, were you leagued.  You knew of all, and from your prison led  Their treasonous plottings with a deep-laid plan.    MARY.  When did I that, my lord? Let them produce  The documents.    BURLEIGH.          You have already seen them  They were before the court, presented to you.    MARY.  Mere copies written by another hand;  Show me the proof that they were dictated  By me, that they proceeded from my lips,  And in those very terms in which you read them.    BURLEIGH.  Before his execution, Babington  Confessed they were the same which he received.    MARY.  Why was he in his lifetime not produced  Before my face? Why was he then despatched  So quickly that he could not be confronted  With her whom he accused?    BURLEIGH.                Besides, my lady,  Your secretaries, Curl and Nau, declare  On oath, they are the very selfsame letters  Which from your lips they faithfully transcribed.    MARY.  And on my menials' testimony, then,  I am condemned; upon the word of those  Who have betrayed me, me, their rightful queen!  Who in that very moment, when they came  As witnesses against me, broke their faith!    BURLEIGH.  You said yourself, you held your countryman  To be an upright, conscientious man.    MARY.  I thought him such; but 'tis the hour of danger  Alone, which tries the virtue of a man.  [He ever was an honest man, but weak  In understanding; and his subtle comrade,  Whose faith, observe, I never answered for,  Might easily seduce him to write down  More than he should;] the rack may have compelled him  To say and to confess more than he knew.  He hoped to save himself by this false witness,  And thought it could not injure me--a queen.    BURLEIGH.  The oath he swore was free and unconstrained.    MARY.  But not before my face! How now, my lord?  The witnesses you name are still alive;  Let them appear against me face to face,  And there repeat what they have testified.  Why am I then denied that privilege,  That right which e'en the murderer enjoys?  I know from Talbot's mouth, my former keeper,  That in this reign a statute has been passed  Which orders that the plaintiff be confronted  With the defendant; is it so, good Paulet?  I e'er have known you as an honest man;  Now prove it to me; tell me, on your conscience,  If such a law exist or not in England?    PAULET.  Madam, there does: that is the law in England.  I must declare the truth.    MARY.                Well, then, my lord,  If I am treated by the law of England  So hardly, when that law oppresses me,  Say, why avoid this selfsame country's law,  When 'tis for my advantage? Answer me;  Why was not Babington confronted with me?  Why not my servants, who are both alive?    BURLEIGH.  Be not so hasty, lady; 'tis not only  Your plot with Babington----    MARY.                'Tis that alone  Which arms the law against me; that alone  From which I'm called upon to clear myself.  Stick to the point, my lord; evade it not.    BURLEIGH.  It has been proved that you have corresponded  With the ambassador of Spain, Mendoza----    MARY.  Stick to the point, my lord.    BURLEIGH.                 That you have formed  Conspiracies to overturn the fixed  Religion of the realm; that you have called  Into this kingdom foreign powers, and roused  All kings in Europe to a war with England.    MARY.  And were it so, my lord--though I deny it--  But e'en suppose it were so: I am kept  Imprisoned here against all laws of nations.  I came not into England sword in hand;  I came a suppliant; and at the hands  Of my imperial kinswoman I claimed  The sacred rights of hospitality,  When power seized upon me, and prepared  To rivet fetters where I hoped protection.  Say, is my conscience bound, then, to this realm?  What are the duties that I owe to England?  I should but exercise a sacred right,  Derived from sad necessity, if I  Warred with these bonds, encountered might with might,  Roused and incited every state in Europe  For my protection to unite in arms.
