CHAPTER II    POLITICAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL    My commission read, \"Ambassador to Germany.\"    It is characteristic of our deep ignorance of all foreign affairs  that I was appointed Ambassador to a place which does not exist.  Politically, there is no such place as \"Germany.\" There are the  twenty-five States, Prussia, Bavaria, Württemberg, Saxony, etc.,  which make up the \"German Empire,\" but there is no such political  entity as \"Germany.\"    These twenty-five States have votes in the Bundesrat, a body  which may be said to correspond remotely to our United States  Senate. But each State has a different number of votes. Prussia  has seventeen, Bavaria six, Württemberg and Saxony four each,  Baden and Hesse three each, Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Brunswick  two each, and the rest one each. Prussia controls Brunswick.    The Reichstag, or Imperial Parliament, corresponds to our House  of Representatives. The members are elected by manhood suffrage of  those over twenty-five. But in practice the Reichstag is nothing  but a debating society because of the preponderating power of the  Bundesrat, or upper chamber. At the head of the ministry is the  Chancellor, appointed by the Emperor; and the other Ministers, such  as Colonies, Interior, Education, Justice and Foreign Affairs,  are but underlings of the Chancellor and appointed by him. The  Chancellor is not responsible to the Reichstag, as Bethmann-Hollweg  clearly stated at the time of the Zabern affair, but only to the  Emperor.    It is true that an innovation properly belonging only to a  parliamentary government was introduced some seven years ago,  viz., that the ministers must answer questions (as in Great Britain)  put them by the members of the Reichstag. But there the likeness  to a parliamentary government begins and ends.    The members of the Bundesrat are named by the Princes of the  twenty-five States making up the German Empire. Prussia, which  has seventeen votes, may name seventeen members of the Bundesrat  or one member, who, however, when he votes casts seventeen votes.  The votes of a State must always be cast as a unit. In the usual  procedure bills are prepared and adopted in the Bundesrat and  then sent to the Reichstag whence, if passed, they return to the  Bundesrat where the final approval must take place. Therefore,  in practice, the Bundesrat makes the laws with the assent of  the Reichstag. The members of the Bundesrat have the right to  appear and make speeches in the Reichstag. The fundamental  constitution of the German Empire is not changed, as with us, by  a separate body but is changed in the same way that an ordinary  law is passed; except that if there are fourteen votes against  the proposed change in the Bundesrat the proposition is defeated,  and, further, the constitution cannot be changed with respect  to rights expressly granted by it to anyone of the twenty-five  States without the assent of that State.    In order to pass a law a majority vote in the Bundesrat and Reichstag  is sufficient if there is a quorum present, and a quorum is a  majority of the members elected in the Reichstag: in the Bundesrat  the quorum consists of such members as are present at a regularly  called meeting, providing the Chancellor or the Vice-Chancellor  attends.    The boundaries of the districts sending members to the Reichstag  have not been changed since 1872, while, in the meantime, a great  shifting of population, as well as great increase of population  has taken place. And because of this, the Reichstag to-day does  not represent the people of Germany in the sense intended by the  framers of the Imperial Constitution.    Much of the legislation that affects the everyday life of a German  emanates from the parliaments of Prussia, Bavaria and Saxony,  etc., as with us in our State Legislatures. The purely legislative  power of the ministers and Bundesrat is, however, large. These  German States have constitutions of some sort. The Grand Duchies  of Mecklenburg have no constitution whatever. It is understood  that the people themselves do not want one, on financial grounds,  fearing that many expenses now borne by the Grand Duke out of  his large private income, would be saddled on the people. The  other States have Constitutions varying in form. In Prussia there  are a House of Lords and a House of Deputies. The members of  the latter are elected by a system of circle votes, by which  the vote of one rich man voting in circle number one counts as  much as thousands voting in circle number three. It is the  recognition by Bethmann-Hollweg that this vicious system must  be changed that brought down on him the wrath of the Prussian  country squires, who for so long have ruled the German Empire,  filling places, civil and military, with their children and  relatives.    In considering Germany, the immense influence of the military  party must not be left out of account; and, with the developments  of the navy, that branch of the service also claimed a share in  guiding the policy of the Government.    The administrative, executive and judicial officers of Prussia  are not elected. The country is governed and judged by men who  enter this branch of the government service exactly as others  enter the army or navy. These are gradually promoted through  the various grades. This applies to judges, clerks of courts,  district attorneys and the officials who govern the political  divisions of Prussia, for Prussia is divided into circles,  presidencies and provinces. For instance, a young man may enter  the government service as assistant to the clerk of some court.  He may then become district attorney in a small town, then clerk  of a larger court, possibly attached to the police presidency  of a large city; he may then become a minor judge, etc., until  finally he becomes a judge of one of the higher courts or an  over-president of a province. Practically the only elective officers  who have any power are members of the Reichstag and the Prussian  Legislature, and there, as I have shown, the power is very small.  Mayors and City Councillors are elected in Prussia, but have  little power; and are elected by the vicious system of circle  voting.    Time and again during the course of the Great War when I made  some complaint or request affecting the interests of one of the  various nations I represented, I was met in the Foreign Office  by the statement, \"We can do nothing with the military. Please  read Bismarck's memoirs and you will see what difficulty he had  with the military.\" Undoubtedly, owing to the fact that the  Chancellor seldom took strong ground, the influence which both  the army and navy claimed in dictating the policy of the Empire  was greatly increased.    Roughly speaking there are three great political divisions or  parties in the German Reichstag. To the right of the presiding  officer sit the Conservatives. Most of these are members from the  Prussian Junker or squire class. They are strong for the rights  of the crown and against any extension of the suffrage in Prussia  or anywhere else. They form probably the most important body of  conservatives now existing in any country in the world. Their  leader, Heydebrand, is known as the uncrowned king of Prussia. On  the left side the Social Democrats sit. As they evidently oppose  the kingship and favour a republic, no Social Democratic member  has ever been called into the government. They represent the great  industrial populations of Germany. Roughly, they constitute about  one-third of the Reichstag, and would sit there in greater numbers  if Germany were again redistricted so that proper representation  were given to the cities, to which there has been a great rush  of population since the time when the Reichstag districts were  originally constituted.    In the centre, and holding the balance of power, sit the members  of the Centrum or Catholic body. Among them are many priests. It  is noteworthy that in this war Roman Catholic opinion in neutral  countries, like Spain, inclines to the side of Germany; while  in Germany, to protect their religious liberties, the Catholic  population vote as Catholics to send Catholic members to the  Reichstag, and these sit and vote as Catholics alone.    Germans high in rank in the government often told me that no part  of conquered Poland would ever be incorporated in Prussia or the  Empire, because it was not desirable to add to the Roman Catholic  population; that they had troubles enough with the Catholics now  in Germany and had no desire to add to their numbers. This, and  the desire to lure the Poles into the creation of a national  army which could be utilised by the German machine, were the  reasons for the creation by Germany (with the assent of Austria)  of the new country of Poland.    This Catholic party is the result in Germany of the  _Kulturkampf_ or War for Civilisation, as it was called by  Bismarck, a contest dating from 1870 between the State in Germany  and the Roman Catholic Church.    Prussia has always been the centre of Protestantism in Germany,  although there are many Roman Catholics in the Rhine Provinces  of Prussia, and in that part of Prussia inhabited principally  by Poles, originally part of the Kingdom of Poland.    Baden and Bavaria, the two principal South German States, and  others are Catholic. In 1870, on the withdrawal of the French  garrison from Rome, the Temporal Power of the Pope ended, and  Bismarck, though appealed to by Catholics, took no interest in the  defence of the Papacy. The conflict between the Roman Catholics  and the Government in Germany was precipitated by the promulgation  by the Vatican Council, in 1870, of the Dogma of the Infallibility  of the Pope.    A certain number of German pastors and bishops refused to subscribe  to the new dogma. In the conflict that ensued these pastors and  bishops were backed by the government.

So Sir Arthur and Merlin alight, and  tied their horses to two trees, and so they went into the ship,  and when they came to the sword that the hand held, Sir Arthur  took it up by the handles, and took it with him.  And the arm  and the hand went under the water; and so they came unto the land  and rode forth.  And then Sir Arthur saw a rich pavilion.  What  signifieth yonder pavilion?  It is the knight's pavilion, said  Merlin, that ye fought with last, Sir Pellinore, but he is out,  he is not there; he hath ado with a knight of yours, that hight  Egglame, and they have fought together, but at the last Egglame  fled, and else he had been dead, and he hath chased him even  to Carlion, and we shall meet with him anon in the highway.  That  is well said, said Arthur, now have I a sword, now will I wage  battle with him, and be avenged on him.  Sir, ye shall not so,  said Merlin, for the knight is weary of fighting and chasing, so  that ye shall have no worship to have ado with him; also, he will  not lightly be matched of one knight living; and therefore it is my  counsel, let him pass, for he shall do you good service in short  time, and his sons, after his days.  Also ye shall see that day  in short space ye shall be right glad to give him your sister  to wed.  When I see him, I will do as ye advise me, said Arthur.  Then Sir Arthur looked on the sword, and liked it passing well.  Whether liketh you better, said Merlin, the sword or the scabbard?  Me liketh better the sword, said Arthur.  Ye are more unwise,  said Merlin, for the scabbard is worth ten of the sword, for while  ye have the scabbard upon you ye shall never lose no blood, be ye  never so sore wounded; therefore, keep well the scabbard always  with you.  So they rode into Carlion, and by the way they met with  Sir Pellinore; but Merlin had done such a craft that Pellinore saw  not Arthur, and he passed by without any words.  I marvel, said  Arthur, that the knight would not speak.  Sir, said Merlin, he saw  you not; for and he had seen you ye had not lightly departed.  So  they came unto Carlion, whereof his knights were passing glad.  And when they heard of his adventures they marveled that he would  jeopard his person so alone.  But all men of worship said it was  merry to be under such a chieftain that would put his person in  adventure as other poor knights did.\"        CHAPTER IV    SIR DINADAN THE HUMORIST    It seemed to me that this quaint lie was most simply and beautifully  told; but then I had heard it only once, and that makes a difference;  it was pleasant to the others when it was fresh, no doubt.    Sir Dinadan the Humorist was the first to awake, and he soon roused  the rest with a practical joke of a sufficiently poor quality.  He tied some metal mugs to a dog's tail and turned him loose,  and he tore around and around the place in a frenzy of fright,  with all the other dogs bellowing after him and battering and  crashing against everything that came in their way and making  altogether a chaos of confusion and a most deafening din and  turmoil; at which every man and woman of the multitude laughed  till the tears flowed, and some fell out of their chairs and  wallowed on the floor in ecstasy.  It was just like so many children.  Sir Dinadan was so proud of his exploit that he could not keep  from telling over and over again, to weariness, how the immortal  idea happened to occur to him; and as is the way with humorists  of his breed, he was still laughing at it after everybody else had  got through.  He was so set up that he concluded to make a speech  --of course a humorous speech.  I think I never heard so many old  played-out jokes strung together in my life.  He was worse than  the minstrels, worse than the clown in the circus.  It seemed  peculiarly sad to sit here, thirteen hundred years before I was  born, and listen again to poor, flat, worm-eaten jokes that had  given me the dry gripes when I was a boy thirteen hundred years  afterwards.  It about convinced me that there isn't any such thing  as a new joke possible.  Everybody laughed at these antiquities  --but then they always do; I had noticed that, centuries later.  However, of course the scoffer didn't laugh--I mean the boy.  No,  he scoffed; there wasn't anything he wouldn't scoff at. He said  the most of Sir Dinadan's jokes were rotten and the rest were  petrified.  I said \"petrified\" was good; as I believed, myself,  that the only right way to classify the majestic ages of some of  those jokes was by geologic periods.  But that neat idea hit  the boy in a blank place, for geology hadn't been invented yet.  However, I made a note of the remark, and calculated to educate  the commonwealth up to it if I pulled through.  It is no use  to throw a good thing away merely because the market isn't ripe yet.    Now Sir Kay arose and began to fire up on his history-mill with me  for fuel.  It was time for me to feel serious, and I did.  Sir Kay  told how he had encountered me in a far land of barbarians, who  all wore the same ridiculous garb that I did--a garb that was a work  of enchantment, and intended to make the wearer secure from hurt  by human hands.  However he had nullified the force of the  enchantment by prayer, and had killed my thirteen knights in  a three hours' battle, and taken me prisoner, sparing my life  in order that so strange a curiosity as I was might be exhibited  to the wonder and admiration of the king and the court.  He spoke  of me all the time, in the blandest way, as \"this prodigious giant,\"  and \"this horrible sky-towering monster,\" and \"this tusked and  taloned man-devouring ogre\", and everybody took in all this bosh  in the naivest way, and never smiled or seemed to notice that  there was any discrepancy between these watered statistics and me.  He said that in trying to escape from him I sprang into the top of  a tree two hundred cubits high at a single bound, but he dislodged  me with a stone the size of a cow, which \"all-to brast\" the most  of my bones, and then swore me to appear at Arthur's court for  sentence.  He ended by condemning me to die at noon on the 21st;  and was so little concerned about it that he stopped to yawn before  he named the date.    I was in a dismal state by this time; indeed, I was hardly enough  in my right mind to keep the run of a dispute that sprung up as  to how I had better be killed, the possibility of the killing being  doubted by some, because of the enchantment in my clothes. And yet  it was nothing but an ordinary suit of fifteen-dollar slop-shops.  Still, I was sane enough to notice this detail, to wit: many of  the terms used in the most matter-of-fact way by this great  assemblage of the first ladies and gentlemen in the land would  have made a Comanche blush.  Indelicacy is too mild a term to convey  the idea.  However, I had read \"Tom Jones,\" and \"Roderick Random,\"  and other books of that kind, and knew that the highest and first  ladies and gentlemen in England had remained little or no cleaner  in their talk, and in the morals and conduct which such talk  implies, clear up to a hundred years ago; in fact clear into our  own nineteenth century--in which century, broadly speaking,  the earliest samples of the real lady and real gentleman discoverable  in English history--or in European history, for that matter--may be  said to have made their appearance.  Suppose Sir Walter, instead  of putting the conversations into the mouths of his characters,  had allowed the characters to speak for themselves?  We should  have had talk from Rebecca and Ivanhoe and the soft lady Rowena  which would embarrass a tramp in our day.  However, to the  unconsciously indelicate all things are delicate.  King Arthur's  people were not aware that they were indecent and I had presence  of mind enough not to mention it.    They were so troubled about my enchanted clothes that they were  mightily relieved, at last, when old Merlin swept the difficulty  away for them with a common-sense hint.  He asked them why they  were so dull--why didn't it occur to them to strip me.  In half a  minute I was as naked as a pair of tongs!  And dear, dear, to think  of it: I was the only embarrassed person there.  Everybody discussed  me; and did it as unconcernedly as if I had been a cabbage.  Queen Guenever was as naively interested as the rest, and said  she had never seen anybody with legs just like mine before.  It was  the only compliment I got--if it was a compliment.    Finally I was carried off in one direction, and my perilous clothes  in another.  I was shoved into a dark and narrow cell in a dungeon,  with some scant remnants for dinner, some moldy straw for a bed,  and no end of rats for company.        CHAPTER V    AN INSPIRATION    I was so tired that even my fears were not able to keep me awake long.    When I next came to myself, I seemed to have been asleep a very  long time.  My first thought was, \"Well, what an astonishing dream  I've had!  I reckon I've waked only just in time to keep from  being hanged or drowned or burned or something....  I'll nap again  till the whistle blows, and then I'll go down to the arms factory  and have it out with Hercules.\"    But just then I heard the harsh music of rusty chains and bolts,  a light flashed in my eyes, and that butterfly, Clarence, stood  before me!  I gasped with surprise; my breath almost got away from me.    \"What!\" I said, \"you here yet?  Go along with the rest of  the dream! scatter!\"    But he only laughed, in his light-hearted way, and fell to making  fun of my sorry plight.    \"All right,\" I said resignedly, \"let the dream go on; I'm in no hurry.\"    \"Prithee what dream?\"    \"What dream?  Why, the dream that I am in Arthur's court--a person  who never existed; and that I am talking to you, who are nothing  but a work of the"]]]
