Divested of its  mythological embellishments, the picture rudely represents the interview  which actually took place. The immediate result was unpromising. The  Onondaga chief coldly refused to entertain the project, which he had  already rejected when proposed by Hiawatha. The ambassadors were not  discouraged. Beyond the Onondagas were scattered the villages of the  Cayugas, a people described by the Jesuit missionaries, at a later day,  as the most mild and tractable of the Iroquois. They were considered an  offshoot of the Onondagas, to whom they bore the same filial relation  which the Oneidas bore to the Caniengas. The journey of the advocates of  peace through the forest to the Cayuga capital, and their reception, are  minutely detailed in the traditionary narrative. The Cayugas, who had  suffered from the prowess and cruelty of the Onondaga chief, needed  little persuasion. They readily consented to come into the league, and  their chief, Akahenyonk (\"The Wary Spy\"), joined the Canienga and Oneida  representatives in a new embassy to the Onondagas. Acting probably upon  the advice of Hiawatha, who knew better than any other the character of  the community and the chief with whom they had to deal, they made  proposals highly flattering to the self-esteem which was the most  notable trait of both ruler and people. The Onondagas should be the  leading nation of the confederacy. Their chief town should be the  federal capital, where the great councils of the league should be held,  and where its records should be preserved. The nation should be  represented in the council by fourteen senators, while no other nation  should have more than ten. And as the Onondagas should be the leading  tribe, so Atotarho should be the leading chief. He alone should have the  right of summoning the federal council, and no act of the council to  which he objected should be valid. In other words, an absolute veto was  given to him. To enhance his personal dignity, two high chiefs were  appointed as his special aids and counselors, his \"Secretaries of  State,\" so to speak. Other insignia of preeminence were to be possessed  by him; and, in view of all these distinctions, it is not surprising  that his successor, who two centuries later retained the same  prerogatives, should have been occasionally styled by the English  colonists \"the Emperor of the Five Nations.\" It might seem, indeed, at  first thought, that the founders of the confederacy had voluntarily  placed themselves and their tribes in a position of almost abject  subserviency to Atotarho and his followers. But they knew too well the  qualities of their people to fear for them any political subjection. It  was certain that when once the league was established, and its  representatives had met in council, character and intelligence would  assume their natural sway, and mere artificial rank and dignity would be  little regarded. Atotarho and his people, however, yielded either to  these specious offers, or to the pressure which the combined urgency of  the three allied nations now brought to bear upon them. They finally  accepted the league; and the great chief, who had originally opposed it,  now naturally became eager to see it as widely extended as possible. He  advised its representatives to go on at once to the westward, and enlist  the populous Seneca towns, pointing out how this might best be done.  This advice was followed, and the adhesion of the Senecas was secured by  giving to their two leading chiefs, Kanya-dariyo (\"Beautiful Lake\") and  Shadekaronyes (\"The Equal Skies\"), the offices of military commanders of  the confederacy, with the title of doorkeepers of the \"Long-house,\" that  being the figure by which the league was known.    The six national leaders who have been mentioned--Dekanawidah for the  Caniengas, Odatsehte for the Oneidas, Atotarho for the Onondagas,  Akahenyonk for the Cayugas, Kanyadariyo and Shadekaronyes for the two  great divisions of the Senecas--met in convention near the Onondaga  Lake, with Hiawatha for their adviser, and a vast concourse of their  followers, to settle the terms and rules of their confederacy, and to  nominate its first council. Of this council, nine members (or ten, if  Dekanawidah be included) were assigned to the Caniengas, a like number  to the Oneidas, fourteen to the lordly Onondagas, ten to the Cayugas,  and eight to the Senecas. Except in the way of compliment, the number  assigned to each nation was really of little consequence; inasmuch as,  by the rule of the league, unanimity was exacted in all their decisions.  This unanimity, however, did not require the suffrage of every member of  the council. The representatives of each nation first deliberated apart  upon the question proposed. In this separate council the majority  decided; and the leading chief then expressed in the great council the  voice of his nation. Thus the veto of Atotarho ceased at once to be  peculiar to him, and became a right exercised by each of the allied  nations. This requirement of unanimity, embarrassing as it might seem,  did not prove to be so in practice. Whenever a question arose on which  opinions were divided, its decision was either postponed, or some  compromise was reached which left all parties contented.    The first members of the council were appointed by the convention--under  what precise rule is unknown; but their successors came in by a method  in which the hereditary and the elective systems were singularly  combined, and in which female suffrage had an important place. When a  chief died or (as sometimes happened) was deposed for incapacity or  misconduct, some member of the same family succeeded him. Rank followed  the female line; and this successor might be any descendant of the late  chief's mother or grandmother--his brother, his cousin or his  nephew--but never his son. Among many persons who might thus be  eligible, the selection was made in the first instance by a family  council. In this council the \"chief matron\" of the family, a noble dame  whose position and right were well defined, had the deciding voice. This  remarkable fact is affirmed by the Jesuit mission-ary Lafitau, and the  usage remains in full vigor among the Canadian Iroquois to this day.  [Footnote: \"La dignite de chef est perpetuelle et hereditaire dans sa  Cabane, passant toujours aux enfans de ses tantes, de ses soeurs, on de  ses nieces du cote maternel. Des que l'arbre est tombe, il fault, disent  ils, le relever. La matrone, qui a la principale autorite, apres en  avoir confere avec ceux de sa Cabane, en confere de nouveau avec ceux de  sa Tribu [clan], a qui elle fait agreer oelui qu'elle a choisi pour  succeder, ce qui lui est assez libre. Elle n'a pas toujours egard au  droit d'ainesse, et d'ordinaire, elle prend celui qui paroit le plus  propre a soutenir ce rang par ses bonnes qualites.\"--_Lafitau: Maurs des  Savages Ameriquains_, p. 471.] If there are two or more members of the  family who seem to have equal claims, the nominating matron sometimes  declines to decide between them, and names them both or all, leaving the  ultimate choice to the nation or the federal council. The council of the  nation next considers the nomination, and, if dissatisfied, refers it  back to the family for a new designation. If content, the national  council reports the name of the candidate to the federal senate, in  which resides the power of ratifying or rejecting the choice of the  nation; but the power of rejection is rarely exercised, though that of  expulsion for good cause is not unfrequently exerted. The new chief  inherits the name of his predecessor. In this respect, as in some  others, the resemblance of the Great Council to the English House of  Peers is striking. As Norfolk succeeds to Norfolk, so Tekarihoken  succeeds Tekarihoken. The great names of Hiawatha and Atotarho are still  borne by plain farmer-councillors on the Canadian Reservation.    When the League was established, Hiawatha had been adopted by the  Canienga nation as one of their chiefs. The honor in which he was held  by them is shown by his position on the roll of councillors, as it has  been handed down from the earliest times. As the Canienga nation is the  \"elder brother,\" the names of its chiefs are first recited. At the head  of the list is the leading Canienga chief, Tekarihoken, who represents  the noblest lineage of the Iroquois stock. Next to him, and second on  the roll, is the name of Hiawatha. That of his great colleague,  Dekanawidah, nowhere appears. He was a member of the first council; but  he forbade his people to appoint a successor to him. \"Let the others  have successors,\" he said proudly, \"for others can advise you like them.  But I am the founder of your league, and no one else can do what I have  done.\" [Footnote: In Mr. Morgan's admirable work, \"_The League of the  Iroquois_,\" the list of Councillors (whom he styles _sachems_),  comprises the name of Dekanawidah--in his orthography, Daganoweda.  During my last visit to my lamented friend (in September, 1880), when we  examined together my copy of the then newly discovered Book of Rites, in  which he was greatly interested, this point was considered. The original  notes which he made for his work were examined. It appeared that in the  list as it was first written by him, from the dictation of a  well-informed Seneca chief, the name of Dekanawidah was not comprised. A  later, but erroneous suggestion, from another source, led him to believe  that his first informant was mistaken, or that he had misunderstood him,  and to substitute the name of Dekanawidah for the somewhat similar name  of Shatekariwate (in Seneca Sadekeiwadeh), which stands third on the  roll, immediately following that of Hiawatha. The term _sachem_, it may  be added, is an Algonkin word, and one which Iroquois speakers have a  difficulty in pronouncing. Their own name for a member of their Senate  is _Royaner_,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8578"],[0,"The Grand Inquisitor (#5)"],[1," of man's conscience, and hold in their hand  man's daily bread? Having accepted Caesar's glaive and purple, we  had, of course, but to deny Thee, to henceforth follow him alone.  Oh, centuries of intellectual riot and rebellious free thought  are yet before us, and their science will end by anthropophagy,  for having begun to build their Babylonian tower without our help  they will have to end by anthropophagy. But it is precisely at  that time that the Beast will crawl up to us in full submission,  and lick the soles of our feet, and sprinkle them with tears of  blood and we shall sit upon the scarlet-colored Beast, and  lifting up high the golden cup \"full of abomination and  filthiness,\" shall show written upon it the word \"Mystery\"! But  it is only then that men will see the beginning of a kingdom of  peace and happiness. Thou art proud of Thine own elect, but Thou  has none other but these elect, and we--we will give rest to  all. But that is not the end. Many are those among thine elect  and the laborers of Thy vineyard, who, tired of waiting for Thy  coming, already have carried and will yet carry, the great fervor  of their hearts and their spiritual strength into another field,  and will end by lifting up against Thee Thine own banner of  freedom. But it is Thyself Thou hast to thank. Under our rule and  sway all will be happy, and will neither rebel nor destroy each  other as they did while under Thy free banner. Oh, we will take  good care to prove to them that they will become absolutely free  only when they have abjured their freedom in our favor and submit  to us absolutely. Thinkest Thou we shall be right or still lying?  They will convince themselves of our rightness, for they will see  what a depth of degrading slavery and strife that liberty of  Thine has led them into. Liberty, Freedom of Thought and  Conscience, and Science will lead them into such impassable  chasms, place them face to face before such wonders and insoluble  mysteries, that some of them--more rebellious and ferocious than  the rest--will destroy themselves; others--rebellious but  weak--will destroy each other; while the remainder, weak, helpless  and miserable, will crawl back to our feet and cry: \"'Yes; right  were ye, oh Fathers of Jesus; ye alone are in possession of His  mystery, and we return to you, praying that ye save us from  ourselves!\" Receiving their bread from us, they will clearly see  that we take the bread from them, the bread made by their own  hands, but to give it back to them in equal shares and that  without any miracle; and having ascertained that, though we have  not changed stones  into bread, yet bread they have, while every  other bread turned verily in their own hands into stones, they  will be only to glad to have it so. Until that day, they will  never be happy. And who is it that helped the most to blind them,  tell me? Who separated the flock and scattered it over ways  unknown if it be not Thee? But we will gather the sheep once more  and subject them to our will for ever. We will prove to them  their own weakness and make them humble again, whilst with Thee  they have learnt but pride, for Thou hast made more of them than  they ever were worth. We will give them that quiet, humble  happiness, which alone benefits such weak, foolish creatures as  they are, and having once had proved to them their weakness, they  will become timid and obedient, and gather around us as chickens  around their hen. They will wonder at and feel a superstitious  admiration for us, and feel proud to be led by men so powerful  and wise that a handful of them can subject a flock a thousand  millions strong. Gradually men will begin to fear us. They will  nervously dread our slightest anger, their intellects will  weaken, their eyes become as easily accessible to tears as those  of children and women; but we will teach them an easy transition  from grief and tears to laughter, childish joy and mirthful song.  Yes; we will make them work like slaves, but during their  recreation hours they shall have an innocent child-like life,  full of play and merry laughter. We will even permit them sin,  for, weak and helpless, they will feel the more love for us for  permitting them to indulge in it. We will tell them that every  kind of sin will be remitted to them, so long as it is done with  our permission; that we take all these sins upon ourselves, for  we so love the world, that we are even willing to sacrifice our  souls for its satisfaction. And, appearing before them in the  light of their scapegoats and redeemers, we shall be adored the  more for it. They will have no secrets from us. It will rest with  us to permit them to live with their wives and concubines, or to  forbid them, to have children or remain childless, either way  depending on the degree of their obedience to us; and they will  submit most joyfully to us the most agonizing secrets of their  souls--all, all will they lay down at our feet, and we will  authorize and remit them all in Thy name, and they will believe  us and accept our mediation with rapture, as it will deliver them  from their greatest anxiety and torture--that of having to  decide freely for themselves. And all will be happy, all except  the one or two hundred thousands of their rulers. For it is but  we, we the keepers of the great Mystery who will be miserable.  There will be thousands of millions of happy infants, and one  hundred thousand martyrs who have taken upon themselves the curse  of knowledge of good and evil. Peaceable will be their end, and  peacefully will they die, in Thy name, to find behind the portals  of the grave--but death. But we will keep the secret inviolate,  and deceive them for their own good with the mirage of life  eternal in Thy kingdom. For, were there really anything like life  beyond the grave, surely it would never fall to the lot of such  as they! People tell us and prophesy of Thy coming and triumphing  once more on earth; of Thy appearing with the army of Thy elect,  with Thy proud and mighty ones; but we will answer Thee that they  have saved but themselves while we have saved all. We are also  threatened with the great disgrace which awaits the whore,  \"Babylon the great, the mother of harlots\"--who sits upon the  Beast, holding in her hands the Mystery, the word written upon  her forehead; and we are told that the weak ones, the lambs shall  rebel against her and shall make her desolate and naked. But then  will I arise, and point out to Thee the thousands of millions of  happy infants free from any sin. And we who have taken their sins  upon us, for their own good, shall stand before Thee and say:  \"Judge us if Thou canst and darest!\" Know then that I fear Thee  not. Know that I too have lived in the dreary wilderness, where I  fed upon locusts and roots, that I too have blessed freedom with  which thou hast blessed men, and that I too have once prepared to  join the ranks of Thy elect, the proud and the mighty. But I  awoke from my delusion and refused since then to serve insanity.  I returned to join the legion of those who corrected Thy  mistakes. I left the proud and returned to the really humble, and  for their own happiness. What I now tell thee will come to pass,  and our kingdom shall be built, I tell Thee not later than  to-morrow Thou shalt see that obedient flock which at one simple  motion of my hand will rush to add burning coals to Thy stake, on  which I will burn Thee for having dared to come and trouble us in  our work. For, if there ever was one who deserved more than any  of the others our inquisitorial fires--it is Thee! To-morrow I  will burn Thee. Dixi'.\"    Ivan paused. He had entered into the situation and had spoken  with great animation, but now he suddenly burst out laughing.    \"But all that is absurd!\" suddenly exclaimed Alyosha, who had  hitherto listened perplexed and agitated but in profound silence.  \"Your poem is a glorification of Christ, not an accusation, as  you, perhaps, meant to be. And who will believe you when you  speak of 'freedom'? Is it thus that we Christians must understand  it? It is Rome (not all Rome, for that would be unjust), but the  worst of the Roman Catholics, the Inquisitors and Jesuits, that  you have been exposing! Your Inquisitor is an impossible  character. What are these sins they are taking upon themselves?  Who are those keepers of mystery who took upon themselves a curse  for the good of mankind? Who ever met them? We all know the  Jesuits, and no one has a good word to say in their favor; but  when were they as you depict them? Never, never! The Jesuits are  merely a Romish army making ready for their future temporal  kingdom, with a mitred emperor--a Roman high priest at their  head. That is their ideal and object, without any mystery or  elevated suffering. The most prosaic thirsting for power, for the  sake of the mean and earthly pleasures of life, a desire to  enslave their fellow-men, something like our late system of  serfs, with themselves at the head as landed proprietors--that  is all that they can be accused of. They may not believe in God,  that is also possible, but your suffering Inquisitor is simply--a  fancy!\"    \"Hold, hold!\" interrupted Ivan, smiling. \"Do not be so excited. A  fancy, you say; be it so! Of course, it is a fancy. But stop. Do  you really imagine that all this Catholic movement during the  last centuries is naught but a desire for power for the mere  purpose of 'mean pleasures'? Is this what your Father Paissiy  taught you?\"    \"No, no, quite the reverse, for Father Paissiy once told me  something very similar to what you yourself  say, though, of  course, not that--something quite different,\" suddenly added  Alexis, blushing.    \"A precious piece of information, notwithstanding your 'not  that.' I ask you, why should the Inquisitors and the Jesuits of  your imagination live but for the attainment of 'mean material  pleasures?' Why should there not "]]]
