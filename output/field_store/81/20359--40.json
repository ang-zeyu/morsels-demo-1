Thought, on the other hand, is shown in all they say when proving  or disproving some particular point, or enunciating some universal  proposition. Fourth among the literary elements is the Diction of the  personages, i.e. as before explained, the expression of their thoughts  in words, which is practically the same thing with verse as with prose.  As for the two remaining parts, the Melody is the greatest of the  pleasurable accessories of Tragedy. The Spectacle, though an attraction,  is the least artistic of all the parts, and has least to do with the  art of poetry. The tragic effect is quite possible without a public  performance and actors; and besides, the getting-up of the Spectacle is  more a matter for the costumier than the poet.          7      Having thus distinguished the parts, let us now consider the proper  construction of the Fable or Plot, as that is at once the first and the  most important thing in Tragedy. We have laid it down that a tragedy is  an imitation of an action that is complete in itself, as a whole of some  magnitude; for a whole may be of no magnitude to speak of. Now a whole  is that which has beginning, middle, and end. A beginning is that which  is not itself necessarily after anything else, and which has naturally  something else after it; an end is that which is naturally after  something itself, either as its necessary or usual consequent, and with  nothing else after it; and a middle, that which is by nature after one  thing and has also another after it. A well-constructed Plot, therefore,  cannot either begin or end at any point one likes; beginning and end in  it must be of the forms just described. Again: to be beautiful, a living  creature, and every whole made up of parts, must not only present a  certain order in its arrangement of parts, but also be of a certain  definite magnitude. Beauty is a matter of size and order, and therefore  impossible either (1) in a very minute creature, since our perception  becomes indistinct as it approaches instantaneity; or (2) in a creature  of vast size--one, say, 1,000 miles long--as in that case, instead of  the object being seen all at once, the unity and wholeness of it is lost  to the beholder.    Just in the same way, then, as a beautiful whole made up of parts, or a  beautiful living creature, must be of some size, a size to be taken in  by the eye, so a story or Plot must be of some length, but of a length  to be taken in by the memory. As for the limit of its length, so far as  that is relative to public performances and spectators, it does not fall  within the theory of poetry. If they had to perform a hundred tragedies,  they would be timed by water-clocks, as they are said to have been at  one period. The limit, however, set by the actual nature of the thing is  this: the longer the story, consistently with its being comprehensible  as a whole, the finer it is by reason of its magnitude. As a rough  general formula, 'a length which allows of the hero passing by a series  of probable or necessary stages from misfortune to happiness, or from  happiness to misfortune', may suffice as a limit for the magnitude of  the story.          8      The Unity of a Plot does not consist, as some suppose, in its having one  man as its subject. An infinity of things befall that one man, some of  which it is impossible to reduce to unity; and in like manner there are  many actions of one man which cannot be made to form one action.  One sees, therefore, the mistake of all the poets who have written a  _Heracleid_, a _Theseid_, or similar poems; they suppose that, because  Heracles was one man, the story also of Heracles must be one story.  Homer, however, evidently understood this point quite well, whether  by art or instinct, just in the same way as he excels the rest in every  other respect. In writing an _Odyssey_, he did not make the poem cover  all that ever befell his hero--it befell him, for instance, to get  wounded on Parnassus and also to feign madness at the time of the call  to arms, but the two incidents had no probable or necessary connexion  with one another--instead of doing that, he took an action with a Unity  of the kind we are describing as the subject of the _Odyssey_, as also  of the _Iliad_. The truth is that, just as in the other imitative arts  one imitation is always of one thing, so in poetry the story, as an  imitation of action, must represent one action, a complete whole,  with its several incidents so closely connected that the transposal or  withdrawal of any one of them will disjoin and dislocate the whole. For  that which makes no perceptible difference by its presence or absence is  no real part of the whole.          9      From what we have said it will be seen that the poet's function is to  describe, not the thing that has happened, but a kind of thing that  might happen, i.e. what is possible as being probable or necessary. The  distinction between historian and poet is not in the one writing prose  and the other verse--you might put the work of Herodotus into verse, and  it would still be a species of history; it consists really in this, that  the one describes the thing that has been, and the other a kind of thing  that might be. Hence poetry is something more philosophic and of graver  import than history, since its statements are of the nature rather  of universals, whereas those of history are singulars. By a universal  statement I mean one as to what such or such a kind of man will probably  or necessarily say or do--which is the aim of poetry, though it affixes  proper names to the characters; by a singular statement, one as to what,  say, Alcibiades did or had done to him. In Comedy this has become clear  by this time; it is only when their plot is already made up of probable  incidents that they give it a basis of proper names, choosing for the  purpose any names that may occur to them, instead of writing like the  old iambic poets about particular persons. In Tragedy, however, they  still adhere to the historic names; and for this reason: what convinces  is the possible; now whereas we are not yet sure as to the possibility  of that which has not happened, that which has happened is manifestly  possible, else it would not have come to pass. Nevertheless even in  Tragedy there are some plays with but one or two known names in them,  the rest being inventions; and there are some without a single known  name, e.g. Agathon's Anthens, in which both incidents and names are of  the poet's invention; and it is no less delightful on that account. So  that one must not aim at a rigid adherence to the traditional stories  on which tragedies are based. It would be absurd, in fact, to do so,  as even the known stories are only known to a few, though they are a  delight none the less to all.    It is evident from the above that, the poet must be more the poet of his  stories or Plots than of his verses, inasmuch as he is a poet by  virtue of the imitative element in his work, and it is actions that he  imitates. And if he should come to take a subject from actual history,  he is none the less a poet for that; since some historic occurrences may  very well be in the probable and possible order of things; and it is in  that aspect of them that he is their poet.    Of simple Plots and actions the episodic are the worst. I call a Plot  episodic when there is neither probability nor necessity in the sequence  of episodes. Actions of this sort bad poets construct through their  own fault, and good ones on account of the players. His work being for  public performance, a good poet often stretches out a Plot beyond its  capabilities, and is thus obliged to twist the sequence of incident.    Tragedy, however, is an imitation not only of a complete action, but  also of incidents arousing pity and fear. Such incidents have the very  greatest effect on the mind when they occur unexpectedly and at the same  time in consequence of one another; there is more of the marvellous in  them then than if they happened of themselves or by mere chance. Even  matters of chance seem most marvellous if there is an appearance of  design as it were in them; as for instance the statue of Mitys at  Argos killed the author of Mitys' death by falling down on him when a  looker-on at a public spectacle; for incidents like that we think to be  not without a meaning. A Plot, therefore, of this sort is necessarily  finer than others.          10      Plots are either simple or complex, since the actions they represent are  naturally of this twofold description. The action, proceeding in the way  defined, as one continuous whole, I call simple, when the change in the  hero's fortunes takes place without Peripety or Discovery; and complex,  when it involves one or the other, or both. These should each of  them arise out of the structure of the Plot itself, so as to be the  consequence, necessary or probable, of the antecedents. There is a great  difference between a thing happening _propter hoc_ and _post hoc_.          11      A Peripety is the change from one state of things within the play to its  opposite of the kind described, and that too in the way we are saying,  in the probable or necessary sequence of events; as it is for instance  in _Oedipus_: here the opposite state of things is produced by the  Messenger, who, coming to gladden Oedipus and to remove his fears as to  his mother, reveals the secret of his birth. And in _Lynceus_: just as  he is being led off for execution, with Danaus at his side to put him to  death, the incidents preceding this bring it about that he is saved and  Danaus put to death. A Discovery is, as the very word implies, a change  from ignorance to knowledge, and thus to either"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6764"],[0,"Army Life in a Black Regiment (#5)"],[1,"rs; give the  men an empty barrel for a stump, and they will do their own exhortation.      December 11, 1862.    Haroun Alraschid, wandering in disguise through his imperial streets,  scarcely happened upon a greater variety of groups than I, in my evening  strolls among our own camp-fires.    Beside some of these fires the men are cleaning their guns or rehearsing  their drill,--beside others, smoking in silence their very scanty supply  of the beloved tobacco,--beside others, telling stories and shouting  with laughter over the broadest mimicry, in which they excel, and in  which the officers come in for a full share. The everlasting \"shout\"  is always within hearing, with its mixture of piety and polka, and  its castanet-like clapping of the hands. Then there are quieter  prayer-meetings, with pious invocations and slow psalms, \"deaconed out\"  from memory by the leader, two lines at a time, in a sort of wailing  chant. Elsewhere, there are _conversazioni_ around fires, with a woman  for queen of the circle,--her Nubian face, gay headdress, gilt necklace,  and white teeth, all resplendent in the glowing light. Sometimes the  woman is spelling slow monosyllables out of a primer, a feat which  always commands all ears,--they rightly recognizing a mighty spell,  equal to the overthrowing of monarchs, in the magic assonance of _cat,  hat, pat, bat_, and the rest of it. Elsewhere, it is some solitary old  cook, some aged Uncle Tiff, with enormous spectacles, who is perusing a  hymn-book by the light of a pine splinter, in his deserted cooking booth  of palmetto leaves. By another fire there is an actual dance, red-legged  soldiers doing right-and-left, and \"now-lead-de-lady-ober,\" to the music  of a violin which is rather artistically played, and which may have  guided the steps, in other days, of Barnwells and Hugers. And yonder is  a stump-orator perched on his barrel, pouring out his exhortations to  fidelity in war and in religion. To-night for the first time I have  heard an harangue in a different strain, quite saucy, sceptical, and  defiant, appealing to them in a sort of French materialistic style, and  claiming some personal experience of warfare. \"You don't know notin'  about it, boys. You tink you's brave enough; how you tink, if you stan'  clar in de open field,--here you, and dar de Secesh? You's got to hab  de right ting inside o' you. You must hab it 'served [preserved] in you,  like dese yer sour plums dey 'serve in de barr'l; you's got to harden  it down inside o' you, or it's notin'.\" Then he hit hard at the  religionists: \"When a man's got de sperit ob de Lord in him, it weakens  him all out, can't hoe de corn.\" He had a great deal of broad sense in  his speech; but presently some others began praying vociferously close  by, as if to drown this free-thinker, when at last he exclaimed, \"I mean  to fight de war through, an' die a good sojer wid de last kick, dat's  _my_ prayer!\" and suddenly jumped off the barrel. I was quite interested  at discovering this reverse side of the temperament, the devotional side  preponderates so enormously, and the greatest scamps kneel and groan in  their prayer-meetings with such entire zest. It shows that there is some  individuality developed among them, and that they will not become too  exclusively pietistic.    Their love of the spelling-book is perfectly inexhaustible,--they  stumbling on by themselves, or the blind leading the blind, with the  same pathetic patience which they carry into everything. The chaplain is  getting up a schoolhouse, where he will soon teach them as regularly as  he can. But the alphabet must always be a very incidental business in a  camp.      December 14.    Passages from prayers in the camp:--    \"Let me so lib dat when I die I shall _hab manners_, dat I shall know  what to say when I see my Heabenly Lord.\"    \"Let me lib wid de musket in one hand an' de Bible in de oder,--dat if  I die at de muzzle ob de musket, die in de water, die on de land, I may  know I hab de bressed Jesus in my hand, an' hab no fear.\"    \"I hab lef my wife in de land o' bondage; my little ones dey say eb'ry  night, Whar is my fader? But when I die, when de bressed mornin' rises,  when I shall stan' in de glory, wid one foot on de water an' one foot  on de land, den, O Lord, I shall see my wife an' my little chil'en once  more.\"    These sentences I noted down, as best I could, beside the glimmering  camp-fire last night. The same person was the hero of a singular little  _contre-temps_ at a funeral in the afternoon. It was our first  funeral. The man had died in hospital, and we had chosen a picturesque  burial-place above the river, near the old church, and beside a little  nameless cemetery, used by generations of slaves. It was a regular  military funeral, the coffin being draped with the American flag, the  escort marching behind, and three volleys fired over the grave. During  the services there was singing, the chaplain deaconing out the hymn in  their favorite way. This ended, he announced his text,--\"This poor  man cried, and the Lord heard him, and delivered him out of all his  trouble.\" Instantly, to my great amazement, the cracked voice of the  chorister was uplifted, intoning the text, as if it were the first verse  of another hymn. So calmly was it done, so imperturbable were all the  black countenances, that I half began to conjecture that the chaplain  himself intended it for a hymn, though I could imagine no prospective  rhyme for _trouble_ unless it were approximated by _debbil_, which is,  indeed, a favorite reference, both with the men and with his Reverence.  But the chaplain, peacefully awaiting, gently repeated his text after  the chant, and to my great relief the old chorister waived all further  recitative, and let the funeral discourse proceed.    Their memories are a vast bewildered chaos of Jewish history and  biography; and most of the great events of the past, down to the period  of the American Revolution, they instinctively attribute to Moses.  There is a fine bold confidence in all their citations, however, and the  record never loses piquancy in their hands, though strict accuracy may  suffer. Thus, one of my captains, last Sunday, heard a colored exhorter  at Beaufort proclaim, \"Paul may plant, _and may polish wid water_, but  it won't do,\" in which the sainted Apollos would hardly have recognized  himself.    Just now one of the soldiers came to me to say that he was about to  be married to a girl in Beaufort, and would I lend him a dollar and  seventy-five cents to buy the wedding outfit? It seemed as if matrimony  on such moderate terms ought to be encouraged in these days; and so I  responded to the appeal.      December 16.    To-day a young recruit appeared here, who had been the slave of Colonel  Sammis, one of the leading Florida refugees. Two white companions came  with him, who also appeared to be retainers of the Colonel, and I asked  them to dine. Being likewise refugees, they had stories to tell, and  were quite agreeable: one was English born, the other Floridian, a dark,  sallow Southerner, very well bred. After they had gone, the Colonel  himself appeared, I told him that I had been entertaining his white  friends, and after a while he quietly let out the remark,--    \"Yes, one of those white friends of whom you speak is a boy raised on  one of my plantations; he has travelled with me to the North, and passed  for white, and he always keeps away from the negroes.\"    Certainly no such suspicion had ever crossed my mind.    I have noticed one man in the regiment who would easily pass for  white,--a little sickly drummer, aged fifty at least, with brown eyes  and reddish hair, who is said to be the son of one of our commodores.  I have seen perhaps a dozen persons as fair, or fairer, among fugitive  slaves, but they were usually young children. It touched me far more  to see this man, who had spent more than half a lifetime in this  low estate, and for whom it now seemed too late to be anything but a  \"nigger.\" This offensive word, by the way, is almost as common with them  as at the North, and far more common than with well-bred slaveholders.  They have meekly accepted it. \"Want to go out to de nigger houses, Sah,\"  is the universal impulse of sociability, when they wish to cross the  lines. \"He hab twenty house-servants, an' two hundred head o' nigger,\"  is a still more degrading form of phrase, in which the epithet is  limited to the field-hands, and they estimated like so many cattle.  This want of self-respect of course interferes with the authority of the  non-commissioned officers, which is always difficult to sustain, even in  white regiments. \"He needn't try to play de white man ober me,\" was the  protest of a soldier against his corporal the other day. To counteract  this I have often to remind them that they do not obey their officers  because they are white, but because they are their officers; and guard  duty is an admirable school for this, because they readily understand  that the sergeant or corporal of the guard has for the time more  authority than any commissioned officer who is not on duty. It is  necessary also for their superiors to treat the non-commissioned  officers with careful courtesy, and I often caution the line officers  never to call them \"Sam\" or \"Will,\" nor omit the proper handle to their  names. The value of the habitual courtesies of the regular army is  exceedingly apparent with these men: an officer of polished manners can  wind them round his finger, while white soldiers seem rather to prefer  a certain roughness. The demeanor of my men to each other is very  courteous, and yet I see none of that sort of upstart conceit which is  sometimes offensive among free negroes at the North, the dandy-barber  strut. This is an agreeable surprise, for I feared that freedom and  regimentals would produce precisely that.    They seem the world's perpetual children, docile, gay, "]]]
