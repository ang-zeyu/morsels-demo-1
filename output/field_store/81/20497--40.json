Again Robin  warded two of the strokes, but at the third, his staff broke beneath the  mighty blows of the Tinker.  \"Now, ill betide thee, traitor staff,\"  cried Robin, as it fell from his hands; \"a foul stick art thou to serve  me thus in mine hour of need.\"    \"Now yield thee,\" quoth the Tinker, \"for thou art my captive; and if  thou do not, I will beat thy pate to a pudding.\"    To this Robin Hood made no answer, but, clapping his horn to his lips,  he blew three blasts, loud and clear.    \"Ay,\" quoth the Tinker, \"blow thou mayest, but go thou must with me to  Nottingham Town, for the Sheriff would fain see thee there. Now wilt  thou yield thee, or shall I have to break thy pretty head?\"    \"An I must drink sour ale, I must,\" quoth Robin, \"but never have I  yielded me to man before, and that without wound or mark upon my body.  Nor, when I bethink me, will I yield now. Ho, my merry men!  Come  quickly!\"    Then from out the forest leaped Little John and six stout yeomen clad in  Lincoln green.    \"How now, good master,\" cried Little John, \"what need hast thou that  thou dost wind thy horn so loudly?\"    \"There stands a tinker,\" quoth Robin, \"that would fain take me to  Nottingham, there to hang upon the gallows tree.\"    \"Then shall he himself hang forthwith,\" cried Little John, and he and  the others made at the Tinker, to seize him.    \"Nay, touch him not,\" said Robin, \"for a right stout man is he. A metal  man he is by trade, and a mettled man by nature; moreover, he doth sing  a lovely ballad.  Say, good fellow, wilt thou join my merry men all?  Three suits of Lincoln green shalt thou have a year, besides forty marks  in fee; thou shalt share all with us and lead a right merry life in the  greenwood; for cares have we not, and misfortune cometh not upon us  within the sweet shades of Sherwood, where we shoot the dun deer and  feed upon venison and sweet oaten cakes, and curds and honey. Wilt thou  come with me?\"    \"Ay, marry, will I join with you all,\" quoth the Tinker, \"for I love a  merry life, and I love thee, good master, though thou didst thwack my  ribs and cheat me into the bargain. Fain am I to own thou art both a  stouter and a slyer man than I; so I will obey thee and be thine own  true servant.\"    So all turned their steps to the forest depths, where the Tinker was to  live henceforth.  For many a day he sang ballads to the band, until the  famous Allan a Dale joined them, before whose sweet voice all others  seemed as harsh as a raven's; but of him we will learn hereafter.          The Shooting Match at Nottingham Town    THEN THE SHERIFF was very wroth because of this failure to take jolly  Robin, for it came to his ears, as ill news always does, that the people  laughed at him and made a jest of his thinking to serve a warrant upon  such a one as the bold outlaw. And a man hates nothing so much as being  made a jest of; so he said: \"Our gracious lord and sovereign King  himself shall know of this, and how his laws are perverted and despised  by this band of rebel outlaws. As for yon traitor Tinker, him will I  hang, if I catch him, upon the very highest gallows tree in all  Nottinghamshire.\"    Then he bade all his servants and retainers to make ready to go to  London Town, to see and speak with the King.    At this there was bustling at the Sheriff's castle, and men ran hither  and thither upon this business and upon that, while the forge fires of  Nottingham glowed red far into the night like twinkling stars, for all  the smiths of the town were busy making or mending armor for the  Sheriff's troop of escort. For two days this labor lasted, then, on the  third, all was ready for the journey.  So forth they started in the  bright sunlight, from Nottingham Town to Fosse Way and thence to Watling  Street; and so they journeyed for two days, until they saw at last the  spires and towers of great London Town; and many folks stopped, as they  journeyed along, and gazed at the show they made riding along the  highways with their flashing armor and gay plumes and trappings.    In London King Henry and his fair Queen Eleanor held their court, gay  with ladies in silks and satins and velvets and cloth of gold, and also  brave knights and gallant courtiers.    Thither came the Sheriff and was shown into the King's presence.    \"A boon, a boon,\" quoth he, as he knelt upon the ground.    \"Now what wouldst thou have?\" said the King.  \"Let us hear what may be  thy desires.\"    \"O good my Lord and Sovereign,\" spake the Sheriff, \"in Sherwood Forest  in our own good shire of Nottingham, liveth a bold outlaw whose name is  Robin Hood.\"    \"In good sooth,\" said the King, \"his doings have reached even our own  royal ears.  He is a saucy, rebellious varlet, yet, I am fain to own, a  right merry soul withal.\"    \"But hearken, O my most gracious Sovereign,\" said the Sheriff.  \"I sent  a warrant to him with thine own royal seal attached, by a right lusty  knave, but he beat the messenger and stole the warrant. And he killeth  thy deer and robbeth thine own liege subjects even upon the great  highways.\"    \"Why, how now,\" quoth the King wrathfully.  \"What wouldst thou have me  do? Comest thou not to me with a great array of men-at-arms and  retainers, and yet art not able to take a single band of lusty knaves  without armor on breast, in thine own county!  What wouldst thou have me  do?  Art thou not my Sheriff?  Are not my laws in force in  Nottinghamshire?  Canst thou not take thine own course against those  that break the laws or do any injury to thee or thine?  Go, get thee  gone, and think well; devise some plan of thine own, but trouble me no  further.  But look well to it, Master Sheriff, for I will have my laws  obeyed by all men within my kingdom, and if thou art not able to enforce  them thou art no sheriff for me. So look well to thyself, I say, or ill  may befall thee as well as all the thieving knaves in Nottinghamshire.  When the flood cometh it sweepeth away grain as well as chaff.\"    Then the Sheriff turned away with a sore and troubled heart, and sadly  he rued his fine show of retainers, for he saw that the King was angry  because he had so many men about him and yet could not enforce the laws.  So, as they all rode slowly back to Nottingham, the Sheriff was  thoughtful and full of care. Not a word did he speak to anyone, and no  one of his men spoke to him, but all the time he was busy devising some  plan to take Robin Hood.    \"Aha!\" cried he suddenly, smiting his hand upon his thigh \"I have it  now! Ride on, my merry men all, and let us get back to Nottingham Town  as speedily as we may.  And mark well my words:  before a fortnight is  passed, that evil knave Robin Hood will be safely clapped into  Nottingham gaol.\"    But what was the Sheriff's plan?    As a usurer takes each one of a bag of silver angels, feeling each coin  to find whether it be clipped or not, so the Sheriff, as all rode slowly  and sadly back toward Nottingham, took up thought after thought in turn,  feeling around the edges of each but finding in every one some flaw. At  last he thought of the daring soul of jolly Robin and how, as he the  Sheriff knew, he often came even within the walls of Nottingham.    \"Now,\" thought the Sheriff, \"could I but persuade Robin nigh to  Nottingham Town so that I could find him, I warrant I would lay hands  upon him so stoutly that he would never get away again.\" Then of a  sudden it came to him like a flash that were he to proclaim a great  shooting match and offer some grand prize, Robin Hood might be  overpersuaded by his spirit to come to the butts; and it was this  thought which caused him to cry \"Aha!\" and smite his palm upon his  thigh.    So, as soon as he had returned safely to Nottingham, he sent messengers  north and south, and east and west, to proclaim through town, hamlet,  and countryside, this grand shooting match, and everyone was bidden that  could draw a longbow, and the prize was to be an arrow of pure beaten  gold.    When Robin Hood first heard the news of this he was in Lincoln Town, and  hastening back to Sherwood Forest he soon called all his merry men about  him and spoke to them thus:    \"Now hearken, my merry men all, to the news that I have brought from  Lincoln Town today.  Our friend the Sheriff of Nottingham hath  proclaimed a shooting match, and hath sent messengers to tell of it  through all the countryside, and the prize is to be a bright golden  arrow. Now I fain would have one of us win it, both because of the  fairness of the prize and because our sweet friend the Sheriff hath  offered it. So we will take our bows and shafts and go there to shoot,  for I know right well that merriment will be a-going. What say ye,  lads?\"    Then young David of Doncaster spoke up and said, \"Now listen, I pray  thee, good master, unto what I say.  I have come straight from our  friend Eadom o' the Blue Boar, and there I heard the full news of this  same match. But, master, I know from him, and he got it from the  Sheriff's man Ralph o' the Scar, that this same knavish Sheriff hath but  laid a trap for thee in this shooting match and wishes nothing so much  as to see thee there. So go not, good master, for I know right well he  doth seek to beguile thee, but stay within the greenwood lest we all  meet dole and woe.\"    \"Now,\" quoth Robin, \"thou art a wise lad and keepest thine ears open and  thy mouth shut, as becometh a wise and crafty woodsman. But shall we let  it be said that the Sheriff of Nottingham did cow bold Robin Hood and  sevenscore as fair archers as are in all merry England?  Nay, good  David, what thou tellest me maketh me to desire the prize even more than  I else should do. But what sayeth our good gossip Swanthold?  Is it not  'A hasty man burneth his mouth, and the fool that keepeth his eyes shut  falleth into the pit'? Thus he says, truly, therefore we must meet guile  with guile.
