He put it in a little pot and a little water in it, and laid it on the  fire until the water was boiling, and then he took a cup, filled it  half up with the juice, and put it to his own mouth. It came into his  head then that perhaps it was poison that was in it, and that the good  people were only tempting him that he might kill himself with that  trick, or put the girl to death without meaning it. He put down the cup  again, raised a couple of drops on the top of his finger, and put it to  his mouth. It was not bitter, and, indeed, had a sweet, agreeable  taste. He grew bolder then, and drank the full of a thimble of it, and  then as much again, and he never stopped till he had half the cup  drunk. He fell asleep after that, and did not wake till it was night,  and there was great hunger and great thirst on him.    He had to wait, then, till the day rose; but he determined, as soon as  he should wake in the morning, that he would go to the king's daughter  and give her a drink of the juice of the herb.    As soon as he got up in the morning, he went over to the priest's house  with the drink in his hand, and he never felt himself so bold and  valiant, and spirited and light, as he was that day, and he was quite  certain that it was the drink he drank which made him so hearty.    When he came to the house, he found the priest and the young lady  within, and they were wondering greatly why he had not visited them for  two days.    He told them all his news, and said that he was certain that there was  great power in that herb, and that it would do the lady no hurt, for he  tried it himself and got good from it, and then he made her taste it,  for he vowed and swore that there was no harm in it.    Guleesh handed her the cup, and she drank half of it, and then fell  back on her bed and a heavy sleep came on her, and she never woke out  of that sleep till the day on the morrow.    Guleesh and the priest sat up the entire night with her, waiting till  she should awake, and they between hope and unhope, between expectation  of saving her and fear of hurting her.    She awoke at last when the sun had gone half its way through the  heavens. She rubbed her eyes and looked like a person who did not know  where she was. She was like one astonished when she saw Guleesh and the  priest in the same room with her, and she sat up doing her best to  collect her thoughts.    The two men were in great anxiety waiting to see would she speak, or  would she not speak, and when they remained silent for a couple of  minutes, the priest said to her: \"Did you sleep well, Mary?\"    And she answered him: \"I slept, thank you.\"    No sooner did Guleesh hear her talking than he put a shout of joy out  of him, and ran over to her and fell on his two knees, and said: \"A  thousand thanks to God, who has given you back the talk; lady of my  heart, speak again to me.\"    The lady answered him that she understood it was he who boiled that  drink for her, and gave it to her; that she was obliged to him from her  heart for all the kindness he showed her since the day she first came  to Ireland, and that he might be certain that she never would forget it.    Guleesh was ready to die with satisfaction and delight. Then they  brought her food, and she ate with a good appetite, and was merry and  joyous, and never left off talking with the priest while she was eating.    After that Guleesh went home to his house, and stretched himself on the  bed and fell asleep again, for the force of the herb was not all spent,  and he passed another day and a night sleeping. When he woke up he went  back to the priest's house, and found that the young lady was in the  same state, and that she was asleep almost since the time that he left  the house.    He went into her chamber with the priest, and they remained watching  beside her till she awoke the second time, and she had her talk as well  as ever, and Guleesh was greatly rejoiced. The priest put food on the  table again, and they ate together, and Guleesh used after that to come  to the house from day to day, and the friendship that was between him  and the king's daughter increased, because she had no one to speak to  except Guleesh and the priest, and she liked Guleesh best.    So they married one another, and that was the fine wedding they had,  and if I were to be there then, I would not be here now; but I heard it  from a birdeen that there was neither cark nor care, sickness nor  sorrow, mishap nor misfortune on them till the hour of their death, and  may the same be with me, and with us all!          THE FIELD OF BOLIAUNS    One fine day in harvest--it was indeed Lady-day in harvest, that  everybody knows to be one of the greatest holidays in the year--Tom  Fitzpatrick was taking a ramble through the ground, and went along the  sunny side of a hedge; when all of a sudden he heard a clacking sort of  noise a little before him in the hedge. \"Dear me,\" said Tom, \"but isn't  it surprising to hear the stonechatters singing so late in the season?\"  So Tom stole on, going on the tops of his toes to try if he could get a  sight of what was making the noise, to see if he was right in his  guess. The noise stopped; but as Tom looked sharply through the bushes,  what should he see in a nook of the hedge but a brown pitcher, that  might hold about a gallon and a half of liquor; and by-and-by a little  wee teeny tiny bit of an old man, with a little _motty_ of a cocked hat  stuck upon the top of his head, a deeshy daushy leather apron hanging  before him, pulled out a little wooden stool, and stood up upon it, and  dipped a little piggin into the pitcher, and took out the full of it,  and put it beside the stool, and then sat down under the pitcher, and  began to work at putting a heel-piece on a bit of a brogue just fit for  himself. \"Well, by the powers,\" said Tom to himself, \"I often heard  tell of the Lepracauns, and, to tell God's truth, I never rightly  believed in them--but here's one of them in real earnest. If I go  knowingly to work, I'm a made man. They say a body must never take  their eyes off them, or they'll escape.\"    Tom now stole on a little further, with his eye fixed on the little man  just as a cat does with a mouse. So when he got up quite close to him,  \"God bless your work, neighbour,\" said Tom.    The little man raised up his head, and \"Thank you kindly,\" said he.    \"I wonder you'd be working on the holiday!\" said Tom.    \"That's my own business, not yours,\" was the reply.    \"Well, may be you'd be civil enough to tell _us_ what you've got in the  pitcher there?\" said Tom.    \"That I will, with pleasure,\" said he; \"it's good beer.\"    \"Beer!\" said Tom. \"Thunder and fire! where did you get it?\"    \"Where did I get it, is it?  Why, I made it. And what do you think I  made it of?\"    \"Devil a one of me knows,\" said Tom; \"but of malt, I suppose, what  else?\"    \"There you're out. I made it of heath.\"    \"Of heath!\" said Tom, bursting out laughing; \"sure you don't think me  to be such a fool as to believe that?\"    \"Do as you please,\" said he, \"but what I tell you is the truth. Did you  never hear tell of the Danes?\"    \"Well, what about _them_?\" said Tom.    \"Why, all the about them there is, is that when they were here they  taught us to make beer out of the heath, and the secret's in my family  ever since.\"    \"Will you give a body a taste of your beer?\" said Tom.    \"I'll tell you what it is, young man, it would be fitter for you to be  looking after your father's property than to be bothering decent quiet  people with your foolish questions. There now, while you're idling away  your time here, there's the cows have broke into the oats, and are  knocking the corn all about.\"    Tom was taken so by surprise with this that he was just on the very  point of turning round when he recollected himself; so, afraid that the  like might happen again, he made a grab at the Lepracaun, and caught  him up in his hand; but in his hurry he overset the pitcher, and spilt  all the beer, so that he could not get a taste of it to tell what sort  it was. He then swore that he would kill him if he did not show him  where his money was. Tom looked so wicked and so bloody-minded that the  little man was quite frightened; so says he, \"Come along with me a  couple of fields off, and I'll show you a crock of gold.\"    So they went, and Tom held the Lepracaun fast in his hand, and never  took his eyes from off him, though they had to cross hedges and  ditches, and a crooked bit of bog, till at last they came to a great  field all full of boliauns, and the Lepracaun pointed to a big boliaun,  and says he, \"Dig under that boliaun, and you'll get the great crock  all full of guineas.\"    Tom in his hurry had never thought of bringing a spade with him, so he  made up his mind to run home and fetch one; and that he might know the  place again he took off one of his red garters, and tied it round the  boliaun.    Then he said to the Lepracaun, \"Swear ye'll not take that garter away  from that boliaun.\" And the Lepracaun swore right away not to touch it.    \"I suppose,\" said the Lepracaun, very civilly, \"you have no further  occasion for me?\"    \"No,\" says Tom; \"you may go away now, if you please, and God speed you,  and may good luck attend you wherever you go.\"    \"Well, good-bye to you, Tom Fitzpatrick,\" said the Lepracaun; \"and much  good may it do you when you get it.\"    So Tom ran for dear life, till he came home and got a spade, and then  away with him, as hard as he could go, back to the field of boliauns;  but when he got there, lo and behold! not a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7889"],[0,"Erotica Romana (#5)"],[1,"by Goethe at all, although they are in the same hand as the  rest.  To be sure, these two are not numbered, so that I was long  undecided as to just what their proper position might be.  At one time I  imagined they must belong at the middle of the cycle where at the end of  Elegy XIII Priapus' mother summons her son.  Obviously Goethe, just  returned north from his two years in Italy (1786-88), and alienated from  prim, courtly friends (especially since he had taken a girlfriend into  his cottage), had no thought of publication when he indited these  remembrances of Ancient Rome.  But he did show them to close friends,  one of whom was the wonderful dramatist Friedrich Schiller.  In 1795,  Schiller undertook a new periodical, Die Horen.  This thoughtful and  responsible man initiated the journal with an essay of his own,  explaining how forms of entertainment are actually at the same time our  primary modes of education.  It makes for pretty difficult reading in  our present, less interested epoch.  But he did break the essay up with  diversions solicited from the best minds of his era.  For a discussion  of all this, see    _Professor Worthy's Page_    For now, it is enough to say that among Schiller's examples for  \"aesthetic education,\" as he called it, were these Elegies by his much  admired friend, Wolfgang Goethe.  Editor and author made substantial  changes for propriety's sake--despite Goethe's having lashed out to the  contrary in the first Elegy (which he now suppressed, along with the  final one).  My attempt has been--for the very first time by the way, in  any language--to restore Goethe's cycle to his early conception.  Since  I have been unwilling to intrude with learned notes, I must apologize  for Goethe's many classical allusions, which were as familiar to his own  readership as are, in our publications today, the dense references to  media celebrities.  Modern editors of what they call the \"Roman Elegies\"  bring abundant annotation, and often detail Goethe's own emendations.  What I bring here is merely translated from his manuscript in the  Goethe-Schiller Archive in Weimar."]]]
