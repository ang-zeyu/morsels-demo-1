We shall be very glad of your assistance.\"    \"I could bring out a stereopticon,\" said Jack; \"no very new idea, but  I've a few pictures of places I've seen, and maybe the children would  like it for a half-hour or so.\"    \"Capital, capital,\" pronounced the old gentleman quite as if he had  proposed it. And before any one knew how it had come about, there was  Jack Loughead talking over the run down to Bedford with them all on  Christmas morning, as a matter of course, and as if it had been the  annual affair to him, that it was to all the others.    \"Quite a fine young man,\" said Mr. King, when Jack had at last run off  with a bright smile and word for all, \"and Phronsie will be so pleased  to think of his doing all this for her poor children. Bless her! Well,  David, my man, are you back so soon?\"    \"So soon, Grandpapa?\" cried David, hurrying in from a morning down town  with another \"Harvard Fresh,\" also home for the holidays. \"Why, it is  luncheon time.\"    \"Impossible!\" exclaimed old Mr. King, pulling out his watch. \"Er--bless  me! the boy is right. Now, Polly, my child, you and I must put off our  engagement till afternoon. Then we'll have our Christmasing!\"          CHAPTER III.    CHRISTMAS AT DUNRAVEN.      \"Grandpapa,\" cried Phronsie, flying down the platform, \"the box of dolls  isn't here!\"    \"Goodness me!\" exclaimed old Mr. King, whirling around, \"'tisn't  possible, child, that we've come off without that. It must be with the  other luggage.\"    \"O, no, Grandpapa dear!\" declared Phronsie in great distress, and  clasping her hands to keep the tears back, \"it really, surely hasn't  come; Polly says so.\"    \"Well, then, if Polly says so, it must have been left at home,\" said the  old gentleman, \"and there's no use in my going to look over the  luggage,\" he groaned.    \"What's the matter?\" cried Joel, rushing up, his jolly face aglow.    \"The worst thing that could possibly happen,\" said Mr. King irritably;  \"Phronsie's box of dolls is left behind.\" Then he began to fume up and  down the platform, wholly lost to everything but his indignation.    \"Whew!\" ejaculated Joel, \"that is a miss!\" and he looked down at  Phronsie, but her broad hat had drooped, the brown eyes seeking the  platform floor. \"See here, Phronsie.\"    Phronsie didn't speak for a breathing-space. \"What is it, Joey?\" then  she said, not looking up.    \"I'll go back after it; don't you worry, child.\"    \"Oh, but you can't,\" cried Phronsie, throwing her head back quickly,  \"the train will come, and then you won't be here.\"    \"I'll take the next train; of course I can't get back for this,\" said  Joel, swallowing hard. \"I'll bring the box all right,\" and he dashed  off.    \"Joel--oh, Joel!\" cried Phronsie, running after him, \"don't go!\" she  implored.    \"Here! here! what's the matter?\" cried old Mr. King, forgetting his  indignation to hurry after her. \"Phronsie, wait; what is it, dear?\"    \"Joel's gone,\" panted Phronsie, flying back, her broad hat falling off  to her shoulders, \"oh, do stop him, Grandpapa dear! I'd rather not take  the dolls than to have Joel left.\"    \"Stop him? I can't. Bless me, here--somebody!\" turning off to the little  knots of his party scattered over the platform, \"where are you all?\"    Polly came running up at this, with a pale face. \"Oh, Grandpapa!\" she  began at sight of him.    \"Joel's gone home,\" announced Phronsie, clasping her hands in distress,  \"after the box of dolls, and\"--    \"Joel's gone home!\" echoed Polly, standing quite still.    \"Yes,\" said Phronsie, \"oh, Polly, do stop him and bring him back.\"    \"She can't,\" cried the old gentleman; \"that boy's legs have carried him  half over the town by this time. Nobody could stop him, child.\"    And then, most of the little knots heard the commotion, and came  hurrying up with \"What is it?\" and \"Oh dear, what's the matter?\" in time  to hear Polly groan, \"And Joe thought so much of going down to Dunraven  with us!\"    [Illustration: \"JOEL'S GONE,\" PANTED PHRONSIE, FLYING BACK.]    \"Well, where is he?\" cried Jasper, whirling around to look in all  directions; while Ben took a few long strides to peer around the  station, and David and the other \"Harvard Fresh.\" who had been invited  to keep him company, ran, one up, and the other down, the long platform.    \"See here now,\" shouted old Mr. King so sharply that all the flying feet  were arrested at once, \"every one of you come back! Goodness me, the  idea of the Bedford party being scattered to the four winds in this  fashion!\"    \"I'd help if I could,\" said Mr. Hamilton Dyce, \"but I really don't know  what it's all about yet.\"    \"Oh dear--dear!\" Polly was yet wailing. Then she remembered, and threw  her arms around Phronsie who was standing quite still by her side.  \"Phronsie, precious pet,\" and she picked up her pretty stuff gown to  kneel on the platform-floor to look into the little face, \"don't feel  badly, dear. Joel will come on the next train.\"    \"But he won't be with us,\" said Phronsie slowly, and turning her brown  eyes piteously to Polly.    \"I know it,\" Polly smothered a sigh, \"but we can't help it now.  Grandpapa is feeling dreadfully; oh, Phronsie, you wouldn't make him  sick, dear, for all the world!\"    Phronsie unclasped her hands, and went unsteadily over to the old  gentleman. \"Joel will come on the next train, Grandpapa,\" she said.    \"Bless me, yes, of course,\" said Mr. King, seizing her hand; \"I don't  see what we are making such a fuss for. He'll come on the next train.\"    \"What's the riot?\" asked Livingston Bayley, sauntering up, and whirling  his walking-stick, \"eh?\"    \"Joel's absconded,\" said Mr. Dyce briefly.    \"Eh?\"    \"Gone back after Phronsie's box of dolls,\" explained somebody else.    \"Oh dear me,\" cried Alexia Rhys, trying to get near Polly, \"just like  that boy.\" She still called him that, in spite of his being a Harvard  man, \"He's always making some sort of a fuss.\"    \"Perhaps the train will be late,\" suggested Mrs. Dyce, who, as Mary  Taylor, never could bear to see Phronsie unhappy. \"Hamilton, if you  don't do something to help that child, I shall be sorry I married you,\"  she whispered in her husband's ear.    \"Late? it's late already,\" said Ben, pulling out his watch, \"it's five  minutes past time.\"    \"Well, it may be our luck to have it late enough,\" said Jasper, with a  glance at Polly, \"as it's Christmas day and a big train; so he may  possibly get here--he'll find a cabby that can make good time,\" he  added, with a forlorn attempt at comfort.    Jack Loughead sauntered up and down, on the edge of the group, longing  to be of service, but feeling himself too new a friend to offer his  sympathy.    \"Who the Dickens is that cad?\" asked Mr. Bayley in smothered wrath, to  Mrs. Dyce.    \"Why, don't you know? He's another friend of Polly's,\" said Mary Taylor  Dyce, smiling up sweetly into his face, \"and he's going down to help  entertain Phronsie's poor children. Isn't he nice?\"    \"Nice?\" repeated Livingston Bayley with a black look at the tall figure  stalking on. \"How do I know? Who is the fellow, any way?\"    But there was no time to reply.    \"Here comes the train!\" cried Alexia. The warning bell struck, and the  rush of travelers from the waiting-room, began. \"Oh dear me!\" Then she  forgot all about her late unpleasantness with Pickering Dodge, and  running up to him, she seized his arm, \"Oh, Pickering, do make the  conductor wait for that horrid boy.\"    \"I can't,\" said Pickering, \"the train's late, any way. There, get on,  Alexia,\" putting out his hand to help her up the steps.    \"Oh, I forgot,\" she cried, drawing back, \"that we'd had a fight. Tisn't  proper for you to help me, Pickering, and you oughtn't to ask it, till  you've begged my pardon.\"    \"Then it will be a long day before you receive my assistance,\" said  Pickering, lifting his cap, and turning on his heel at the same time.    Jasper tried to get up to Polly's side, as she was hurrying Phronsie to  the car, old Mr. King holding fast to Phronsie's other hand, but  Livingston Bayley got there first.    \"Allow me, Miss Phronsie,\" he was saying, with extended hand. \"'Pon me  word, it's a beastly crowd going to-day, sir.\"    \"She will do very well with my assistance,\" said the old gentleman,  still holding Phronsie's little glove. \"And I suppose Christmas Day  belongs to everybody, eh, Bayley?\" hurrying in.    Polly, her foot on the lower step, turned and sent a despairing glance  down the platform, and Jasper who saw it through the crowd, fell back a  little to give a last look for Joel.    \"All aboard!\" sang out the conductor, waving his hand.    \"Come--oh, come!\" called Polly with a frantic gesture, from the doorway  of the car, as the train moved off. \"Oh, Jasper!\" as he swung himself up  beside her.    \"The next train runs down in an hour; don't feel badly, Polly,\" Jasper  had time to beg before they were drawn into the confusion of the car.    But no one could pretend, with any sort of success, that Joel wasn't  missed; and Polly had all that she could do to chase away the sorrowful  expression of Phronsie's little face. And everybody tried his and her  best to make it as festive a time as possible; and the other passengers  nudged one another, and sent many an envious glance at the merry party.    \"It's Mr. King's family going down to Bedford,\" said the conductor to  one inquiring mind. \"I take 'em every year,\" proudly. \"He's powerful  rich; but this ain't his affair. It all b'longs to that little girl with  the big hat.\" Then he dashed off, and called a station; and after the  stopping and moving of the train again, he came back and sat on the arm  of the seat to finish his account.    \"You see, there was an old lady, a cousin of the old gentleman's, and  she made a will in favor of this child with the big hat.\" The conductor  pointed his thumb at Phronsie, leaning over Mr. King's shoulder, the  better to hear a wonderful story"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7499"],[0,"Through Five Republics on Horseback, Being an Account of Many Wanderings in (#5)"],[1,"imes, and 30 persons spat in my face. Those who struck  me on the upper part of the body were 6,666, and 100 Jews struck me on  the head. I sighed 125 times. The wounds on the head numbered 20; from  the crown of thorns, 72; points of thorns on the forehead, 100. The  wounds on the body were 100. There came out of my body 28,430 drops of  blood.\" This letter, the tract states, was found in the Holy Sepulchre  and is preserved by his holiness the Pope. Intelligent, thinking men  can only smile at such an utter absurdity.    An \"Echoes from Argentina\" extract reads: \"Not many months ago,  Argentina was blessed by the Pope. Note what has happened since:--The  Archbishop, who was the bearer of the blessing and brought it from  Rome, has since died very suddenly; we have had a terrible visitation  of heat suffocation, hundreds being attacked and very many dying; we  have had the bubonic pest in our midst; a bloody provincial revolution  in Entre Rios; and now at the time of writing there is an outbreak of a  serious cattle disease, and England has closed her ports against  Argentine live stock. Of course, we do not say that these calamities  are the _result_ of the Pope's blessing, but we would that Catholics  would open their eyes and see that it is a fact that whereas Protestant  countries, _anathematized_ by the Pope, prosper, Catholic countries  which have been blessed by him are in a lamentable condition.\"    BUENOS AYRES AT THE PRESENT TIME.    Perhaps no city of the world has grown and progressed more during this  last decade than the city of Buenos Ayres. To-day passengers land in  the centre of the city and step on \"the most expensive system of  artificial docks in all America, representing an expenditure of seventy  million dollars.\"    To this city there is a large emigration. It has grown at the rate of  4,000 adults a week, with a birthrate of 1,000 a week added. The  population is now fast climbing up to 1 1-2 millions of inhabitants.  There are 300,000 Italians, 100,000 Spaniards, a colony of 20,000  Britishers, and, of course, Jews and other foreigners in proportion.  \"Buenos Ayres is one of the most cosmopolitan cities of the world.  There are 189 newspapers, printed in almost every language of the  globe. Probably the only Syrian newspaper in America, _The Assudk_, is  issued in this city.\" To keep pace with the rush of newcomers has  necessitated the building of 30,000 houses every year. There is here  \"the finest and costliest structure ever built, used exclusively by one  newspaper, the home of _La Prensa_; the most magnificent opera house of  the western hemisphere, erected by the government at the cost of ten  million dollars; one of the largest banks in the world, and the  handsomest and largest clubhouse in the world.\" [Footnote: John  Barrett, In Munsey's Magazine.] The entrance fee to this club is  $1,500. The Y.M.C.A. is now erecting a commodious building, for which  $200,000 has already been raised, and there is a Y.W.C.A., with a  membership of five hundred. Dr. Clark, in \"The Continent of  Opportunity,\" says, \"More millionaires live in Buenos Ayres than in any  other city of the world of its size. The proportion of well-clothed,  well-fed people is greater than in American cities, the slums are  smaller, and the submerged classes less in proportion. The constant  movement of carriages and automobiles here quite surpasses that of  Fifth Avenue.\" The street cars are of the latest and most improved  electric types, equal to any seen in New York or London, and seat one  hundred people, inside and out. Besides these there is an excellent  service of motor cabs, and _tubes_ are being commenced. Level crossings  for the steam roads are not permitted in the city limits, so all trains  run over or under the streets.    \"The Post Office handles 40,000,000 pieces of mail and 125,000 parcel  post packages a month. The city has 1,209 automobiles, 27 theatres and  50 moving picture shows. Five thousand vessels enter the port of Buenos  Ayres every year, and the export of meat in 1910 was valued at  $31,000,000. No other section of the world shows such growth.\"  [Footnote: C. H. Furlong, in The World's Work.]    The city, once so unhealthy, is now, through proper drainage, \"the  second healthiest large city of the world.\" The streets, as I first saw  them, were roughly cobbled, now they are asphalt paved, and made into  beautiful avenues, such as would grace any capital of the world.  Avenida de Mayo, cut right through the old city, is famed as being one  of the most costly and beautiful avenues of the world.    On those streets the equestrian milkman is no longer seen. Beautiful  sanitary white-tiled _tambos_, where pure milk and butter are sold,  have taken his place. The old has been transformed and PROGRESS is  written everywhere.          CHAPTER II.    _REVOLUTION._      South America, of all lands, has been most torn asunder by war.  Revolutions may be numbered by hundreds, and the slaughter has been  incredible. Even since the opening of the year 1900, thirty thousand  Colombians have been slain and there have been dozens of revolutions.  Darwin relates the fact that in 1832 Argentina underwent fifteen  changes of government in nine months, owing to internal strife, and  since then Argentina has had its full share.    During my residence in Buenos Ayres there occurred one of those  disastrous revolutions which have from time to time shaken the whole  Republic. The President, Don Juarez Celman, had long been unpopular,  and, the mass of the people being against him, as well as nearly half  of the standing army, and all the fleet then anchored in the river, the  time was considered ripe to strike a blow.    On the morning of July 26, 1890, the sun rose upon thousands of  stern-looking men bivouacking in the streets and public squares of the  city. The revolution had commenced, and was led by one of the most  distinguished Argentine citizens, General Joseph Mary Campos. The  battle-cry of these men was \"_Sangre! Sangre!_\" [Footnote: \"Blood!  Blood!\"] The war fiend stalked forth. Trenches were dug in the streets.  Guns were placed at every point of vantage. Men mounted their steeds  with a careless laugh, while the rising sun shone on their burnished  arms, so soon to be stained with blood. Battalions of men marched up  and down the streets to the sound of martial music, and the low,  flat-roofed housetops were quickly filled with sharpshooters.    The Government House and residence of the President was guarded in all  directions by the 2nd Battalion of the Line, the firemen and a  detachment of police, but on the river side were four gunboats of the  revolutionary party.    The average South American is a man of quick impulses and little  thought. The first shot fired by the Government troops was the signal  for a fusilade that literally shook the city. Rifle shots cracked, big  guns roared, and shells screaming overhead descended in all directions,  carrying death and destruction. Street-cars, wagons and cabs were  overturned to form barricades. In the narrow, straight streets the  carnage was fearful, and blood soon trickled down the watercourses and  dyed the pavements. That morning the sun had risen for the last time  upon six hundred strong men; it set upon their mangled remains. Six  hundred souls! The Argentine soldier knows little of the science of  \"hide and seek\" warfare. When he goes forth to battle, it is to  fight--or die. Of the future life he unfortunately thinks little, and  of Christ, the world's Redeemer, he seldom or never hears. The Roman  Catholic chaplain mumbles a few Latin prayers to them at times, but as  the knowledge of these _resos_ does not seem to improve the priest's  life, the men prefer to remain in ignorance.    The average Argentine soldier is a man of little intelligence. The  regiments are composed of Patagonian Indians or semi-civilized  Guaranis, mixed with all classes of criminals from the state prisons.  Nature has imprinted upon them the unmistakable marks of the  savage--sullen, stupid ferocity, indifference to pain, bestial  instincts. As for his fighting qualities, they more resemble those of  the tiger than of the cool, brave and trained soldier. When his blood  is roused, fighting is with him a matter of blind and indiscriminate  carnage of friend or foe. A more villainous-looking horde it would be  difficult to find in any army. The splendid accoutrements of the  generals and superior officers, and the glittering equipments of their  chargers, offer a vivid contrast to the mean and dirty uniforms of the  troops.    During the day the whole territory of the Republic was declared to be  in a state of siege. Business was at a complete standstill. The stores  were all closed, and many of them fortified with the first means that  came to hand. Mattresses, doors, furniture, everything was  requisitioned, and the greatest excitement prevailed in commercial  circles generally. All the gun-makers' shops had soon been cleared of  their contents, which were in the hands of the adherents of the  revolution.    That evening the news of the insurrection was flashed by \"Reuter's\" to  all parts of the civilized world. The following appeared in one of the  largest British dailies:    \"BUENOS AYRES, July 27, 5.40 p.m.    \"The fighting in the streets between the Government troops and the  insurgents has been of the most desperate character.    \"The forces of the Government have been defeated.    \"The losses in killed and wounded are estimated at 1,000.    \"The fleet is in favor of the Revolutionists.    \"Government house and the barracks occupied by the Government troops  have been bombarded by the insurgent artillery.\"    That night as I went in and out of the squads of men on the  revolutionary side, seeking to do some acts of mercy, I saw many  strange and awful sights. There were wounded men who refused to leave  the field, although the rain poured. Others"]]]
