Later, when referring to the purchase of lands about Commerce, the  Prophet Joseph said:        The place was literally a wilderness. The land was mostly covered      with trees and bushes, and much of it was so wet that it was with      the utmost difficulty that a footman could get through, and totally      impossible for teams. Commerce was unhealthy, very few could live      there; but believing that it might become a healthy place by the      blessing of heaven to the Saints, and no more eligible place      presenting itself, I considered it wisdom to make an attempt to      build up a city.    Having spoken of the first purchase of lands at Commerce, it may not  be amiss here to say that subsequently more extensive purchases were  made of Dr. Galland and Messrs. Hubbard, Wells, Hotchkiss and others.  Considerable difficulty and embarrassment to Joseph personally and to  The Church in general arose over misunderstandings about the Hotchkiss  land purchase. Hotchkiss sold to Joseph for The Church upwards of  five hundred acres of land in Commerce, for which he was to receive  fifty-three thousand five hundred dollars, half to be paid in ten  years, and the remainder in twenty years. This amount was secured to  Hotchkiss & Company by two notes, one payable in ten years and the  other in twenty, signed by Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith and Sidney Rigdon.  The difficulty connected with this extensive land purchase arose from  some exchanges that were made of property in the east, by some of  the Saints, for its equivalent in value in land out of the Hotchkiss  purchase in Commerce; the matter, however, was finally amicably settled.    The terms on which Dr. Galland let The Church have lands were extremely  advantageous to the Saints. He sold at a reasonable rate, and on long  credit, that the people might not be distressed in paying for the  inheritance they purchased. In addition to the first purchase, he  exchanged lands with the Saints in the vicinity of Commerce for lands  in Missouri, to the value of eighty thousand dollars. And he gave  them a good title to the same. He is described as a man of literary  attainments and extensive information and influence. All of which he  used for the good of the exiled Saints in giving them a standing among  his friends. Finally he joined The Church, thus casting his lot with  the exiled people he had assisted, and from that time until his death,  partook of their joys and their sorrows; shared their fortunes and  reverses.    In addition to these land purchases, The Church made others; some of  them even more extensive than those already mentioned. The village  of Nashville, in Lee County, Iowa, and twenty thousand acres of land  adjoining, was bought, though upon what terms the purchase was made  cannot be learned. Another purchase also in Iowa was made by Bishop  Knight, and a settlement was started there called Zarahemla, which was  opposite Nauvoo. This place was organized into a stake [1] of Zion,  but in January, 1842, the stake organization was discontinued; though  Zarahemla continued as an organized branch of The Church.    Stakes of Zion in the following year were organized at Lima, in  Illinois; also at Quincy, in Adams County, for the benefit of the  Saints who continued there. Another stake was organized at Columbus,  in Adams County, Illinois, known as Mount Hope stake; besides these  stakes, branches of the Church were organized in various parts of  Lee County, Iowa, and Adams and Hancock counties, Illinois. But as  Nauvoo rose from the swamps and underbrush of Commerce, and, under the  industry and enterprise of the Saints, and the blessings of a kindly  disposed Providence, developed into a healthy, beautiful and prosperous  commercial and manufacturing city, these stake organizations in the  surrounding country were discontinued, and Nauvoo became the one great  gathering place of the Saints.    Footnotes    1. A stake of Zion is a territorial division of The Church that  embraces several wards or branches. The stake is presided over by a  president, who must be a High Priest, assisted by two counselors, also  High Priests. There must also be in each stake of Zion a high council,  consisting of twelve High Priests, over which council the presidency  of the stake preside. This high council constitutes the judicial power  (ecclesiastical) of the stake, to which appeals lie from the bishops'  courts.        CHAPTER IV.    \"AS FLIES IN THE OINTMENT.\"    HAVING described the site of Nauvoo, and related the circumstances  connected with its establishment as a gathering place of the Saints,  it is necessary to return to the consideration of some events which  occurred at Quincy during the sojourn of the Saints at that place.    Paul, in his day, told the Hebrews that all were not Israel that were  of Israel: so all were not Saints that flocked into Quincy with the  exiles from Missouri; many of them were altogether unworthy of the  association of the people of God. These preyed upon the hospitality  of the people of Quincy to such an extent, that The Church by action  of a conference authorized Elder John Taylor, then one of the Twelve  Apostles, and who afterwards became President of the Church, to write  the following letter, which was printed in the Quincy _Argus_:        In consequence of so great an influx of strangers, arriving in      this place daily, owing to their late expulsion from the State      of Missouri, there must of necessity be, and we wish to state to      the citizens of Quincy and the vicinity, through the medium of      your columns, that there are many individuals among the numbers      who have already arrived, as well as among those who are now on      their way here, who never did belong to our Church, and others who      once did, but who, for various reasons, have been expelled from      our fellowship. Among these are some who have contracted habits      which are at variance with principles of moral rectitude (such      as swearing, dram-drinking, etc.,) which immoralities the Church      of Latter-day Saints is liable to be charged with, owing to our      amalgamation under our late existing circumstances. And as we as a      people do not wish to lay under any such imputation, we would also      state, that such individuals do not hold a name or a place amongst      us; that we altogether discountenance everything of the kind,      that every person once belonging to our community, contracting or      persisting in such immoral habits, have hitherto been expelled from      our society; and that such as we may hereafter be informed of, we      will hold no communion with, but will withdraw our fellowship from      them.        We wish further to state, that we feel laid under peculiar      obligations to the citizens of this place for the patriotic      feelings which have been manifested, and for the hand of liberality      and friendship which was extended to us, in our late difficulties;      and should feel sorry to see that philanthropy and benevolence      abused by the wicked and designing people, who under pretense of      poverty and distress, should try to work up the feelings of the      charitable and humane, get into their debt without any prospect      or intention of paying, and finally, perhaps, we as a people be      charged with dishonesty.        We say that we altogether disapprove of such practices, and we warn      the citizens of Quincy against such individuals who may pretend to      belong to our community.    I have given this letter _in extenso_, because it bears upon its face  the evidence of the honesty of The Church, and its disposition to  treat the people of Illinois, who had so nobly and kindly received its  members in the days of their distress, with candor. It also tells us  of a class even then in The Church, who by the vileness of their lives  gave some coloring to the charges subsequently so unjustly made against  the whole Church; a class who brought upon The Church reproach; an  unrighteous, apostate element, which lingered with The Church for the  sake of advantage--the bane of the body religious.        CHAPTER V.    POLITICAL AGITATION.    ABOUT this time, too, the good feeling entertained toward the Saints by  the people of Quincy and vicinity was not a little endangered through  the unwise course of Lyman Wight. He began the publication of a series  of letters in the Quincy _Whig_, in which he laid the responsibility  of the outrages perpetrated against the Saints in Missouri upon the  Democratic party, implicating not only the Democrats of Missouri,  but indirectly the National Democratic party. This gave much  dissatisfaction to members of that party in the vicinity of Quincy, a  number of whom had been very active in assisting the Saints; and some  of the leading men approached prominent brethren, who still remained in  Quincy, and desired to know if The Church sustained the assertions of  Lyman Wight. Elder R. B. Thompson wrote a letter to President Joseph  Smith on the subject, in which he protested against the course taken by  Lyman Wight, because of the influence it was having on many of those  who had so nobly befriended the Saints in the day of their distress.  Besides, it was altogether unjust, for no particular political party  in Missouri was responsible for the cruelty practiced towards the  Saints. Those who were in the mobs which robbed them of their homes,  burned their houses, ran off their stock, and who whipped, murdered and  finally drove the people from the State of Missouri, were made up of  individuals of every shade of political faith, and of every religion,  and many of no religion whatever. It was unfair, then, under these  circumstances, that the responsibility should be laid at the charge of  any one party or sect of religion. So that Wight's course was not only  doing much"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50357"],[0,"Origin of the 'Reorganized' Church and the Question of Succession (#5)"],[1,"the building of a hotel, called the 'Lord's boarding-house,' for Joseph  Smith and posterity to dwell in from generation to generation, as  also the promise contained therein, viz: 'And as I said unto Abraham  concerning the kindreds of the earth, even so I say to my servant  Joseph, in thee and thy seed shall the kindreds of the earth be  blessed.\"    \"This coupled with the provisions in section 43, that 'none else should  or could receive revelation for the Church' and the provision of  section 19, that the Church shall receive Joseph's words and commands  the same as if from God's own mouth,--establish in our judgment a  lineal descent of authority, equivalent to an imperial dynasty, which  is foreign to the spirit and genius of the Gospel of Christ.\"    This communication was dated March 28, 1886, and was signed by Jason  W. Briggs, (president of their apostles); Zenas H. Gurley, (a member  of that quorum); Gracie Gurley, Margaret Gurley, Edwin H. Gurley, Mida  Gurley.    We see that this Mr. Briggs repudiated the fundamental portions of  his alleged revelation. In the \"revelation\" he teaches the gathering,  but here he says he does not believe in the gathering, either to  Jackson county or to any other place to be known as a local Zion. In  his \"revelation\" he teaches lineal Priesthood, but when he withdraws  from the church one reason was that he could not believe in \"a sole  mouth-piece of God to the Church,\" and in an \"imperial dynasty,\" which  he erroneously thought was taught in the revelation. Thus he repudiates  his \"revelation,\" denies the divine mission of the Prophet Joseph  Smith, and repudiates the standard works of the Church.[7] Unstable to  the last, this man would not rest content in this organization which he  was such a potent instrument in bringing into existence.[8]    There is another thing in his so-called \"revelation\" that is  interesting. He declares that the Lord would raise up one of the seed  of Joseph Smith who would be mighty and strong. Now, evidently this  refers to Joseph Smith, president of that organization. Joseph Smith  of the \"Reorganized\" Church declares that he is not the one mighty and  strong and the \"Reorganized\" Church has backed him up by resolution in  that conclusion.[9]      QUESTION OF REJECTION.    We now come to the question of the rejection of the Church. Our friends  tell us that the Church was rejected for the reason that they failed  to complete the Nauvoo Temple \"in the sufficient time granted by the  Lord.\" They say that the Temple was not finished. The president of the  \"Reorganization\" has made the following statement in this connection:        \"The basement was fitted for occupation and the baptismal font was      ready for use. The auditorium on the first floor was completed      sufficiently to be seated and occupied for assembly purposes. The      stairway on the south side was completed for use. The auditorium      on the second floor, the stairway on the north side, nor any other      portion of the building except those above named were completed;      though the small rooms above the second floor auditorium were used      by President Young and the resident Church authorities for various      purposes.\" (History of Reorganized Church, 2:562).    His brother Alexander makes a similar statement.    In reply to this it is only necessary to say that it made no difference  whether the Temple was finished or not. The revelation of January 19,  1841, provided,        \"That when I (the Lord) give a commandment to any of the sons of      men, to do a work unto my name, and those sons of men go with all      their might, and with all they have, to perform that work, and      cease not their diligence, and their enemies come upon them, and      hinder them from performing that work; behold, it behooveth me to      require that work no more at the hands of those sons of men, but to      accept of their offerings:        \"And the iniquity and transgression of my holy laws and      commandments, I will visit upon the heads of those who hindered my      work, unto the third and fourth generation, so long as they repent      not, and hate me, saith the Lord God.        \"Therefore for this cause have I accepted the offerings of those      whom I commanded to build up a city and a house unto my name, in      Jackson county, Missouri, and were hindered by their enemies, saith      the Lord your God:        \"And I will answer judgment, wrath, and indignation, wailing and      anguish and gnashing of teeth upon their heads, unto the third and      fourth generation, so long as they repent not and hate me, saith      the Lord your God.        \"And this I make an example unto you for your consolation      concerning all those who have been commanded to do a work, and have      been hindered by the hands of their enemies, and by oppression      saith the Lord your God.\"[10]    No sane man will dare say that the Saints were not hindered by their  enemies in the building of the Nauvoo Temple, both before and after the  martyrdom. Nevertheless, I maintain that they were diligent in their  labors as the following references will show, furthermore that the  Temple was completed. In the Times and Seasons, volume 3, page 775, is  to be found an editorial written by the Prophet Joseph in which he says:        \"This noble edifice is progressing with great rapidity; strenuous      exertions are being made on every hand to facilitate its erection;      and materials of all kinds are in great state of forwardness. * * *      *        \"While the busy multitudes have thus been engaged in their several      avocations, performing their daily labor, and working one-tenth of      their time, others have not been less forward in bringing in their      tithings and consecrations for the same great object. Never since      the formation of this Church was laid have we seen manifested a      greater willingness to comply with the requisitions of Jehovah; a      more ardent desire to do the will of God; more strenuous exertions      used, or greater sacrifices made, then there have been since the      Lord said: Let the Temple be built by the tithing of my people.      It seemed as though the spirit of enterprise, philanthropy, and      obedience rested simultaneously upon old and young; and brethren      and sisters, boys and girls, and even strangers, who were not      in the Church, united with an unprecedented liberality in the      accomplishment of this great work; nor could the widow in many      instances, be prevented, out of her scanty pittance, from throwing      in her two mites.\"    This was written in May, 1842. Remember the date, for I will have  occasion to refer to this again before we are through.    This editorial reveals to us what is meant by laboring with your  might and \"to cease not their diligence.\" The Lord did not require  all the time of the Saints to be devoted on that building, but a  tithing--one-tenth of their time or means. That is all He required of  them in order that they should fulfill the commandment. This is also  set forth in the second vol. of the Times and Seasons, page 567, and in  vol., 3 pages 938-9, but I take it for granted that the reference given  is sufficient to cover this ground.      TEMPLE BUILT BY SACRIFICE.    Let us here pause a moment and see what it took to build the Temple.  That structure cost more than one million dollars; the Saints were  poor, and a great deal of the time the Temple was in course of erection  they were harassed by their enemies. The Prophet Joseph was forced  into exile to avoid his enemies who tried to drag him to Missouri, and  therefore he could not devote his personal attention to the building of  the Temple as he otherwise would have done; and in this way the work  was retarded to some degree by the enemies of the people. Moreover,  the building of that structure was not like building one today. The  Saints could not order their timber from the lumber yard in a state of  preparation for the Temple. There were no iron foundries from which  they could obtain the required metal properly prepared; but on the  contrary, every detail had to be performed by the Saints. The timber  had to be hewed in the far off forests of Wisconsin, carried to Nauvoo,  and cut into boards and for the various uses of the Temple. The stone  had to be cut and polished from the quarries, and the whole work had to  be supplied out of the tithing of the people. If the Lord had required  all of their time how would they have supported their families? Of  course, He could have cared for them, but it was but the tenth, mark  you, of their time and means that was required. And yet some of our  friends complain that the Temple was not completed inside of six  months! Naturally under these conditions it would take a number of  years to complete the building.    We have seen that the Saints were diligent up to May, 1842.[11] Let us  now see if they did not continue their diligence. Of course, there were  some who were not diligent; but not of the faithful, not of those who  followed the Twelve. At the April conference, 1844, the Patriarch Hyrum  Smith, addressing the Saints, said:        \"I am one of the committee (i. e., Temple committee); the committee      tell me the quarry is blockaded, it is filled with rock, the stone      cutters are wanting work; come on with your teams as soon as      conference is over. It is not necessary for me to tell who will      come and do it; I will prophesy that you will do it. There is not      one in the city but that will do right if they know it, only one or      two exceptions, and they are not worth notice; God will take care      of them, and if He doesn't, the devil will.\" (T. & S., 5:597).    Now, I know that Hyrum Smith was a prophet of God, the Lord declared  it, and his prophecy did not fail. This shows the willingness of the  Saints to do this work as late as 1844.    In a"]]]
