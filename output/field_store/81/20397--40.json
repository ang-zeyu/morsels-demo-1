The smell of the lock of hair entered into the clothes of Pharaoh; and  they were wroth with the fullers of Pharaoh, saying, \"The smell of  ointment is in the clothes of Pharaoh.\" And the people were rebuked  every day, they knew not what they should do. And the chief fuller of  Pharaoh walked by the bank, and his heart was very evil within him after  the daily quarrel with him. He stood still, he stood upon the sand  opposite to the lock of hair, which was in the water, and he made one  enter into the water and bring it to him; and there was found in it a  smell, exceeding sweet. He took it to Pharaoh; and they brought the  scribes and the wise men, and they said unto Pharaoh, \"This lock of hair  belongs to a daughter of Ra Harakhti: the essence of every god is in  her, and it is a tribute to thee from another land. Let messengers go to  every strange land to seek her: and as for the messenger who shall go to  the valley of the acacia, let many men go with him to bring her.\" Then  said his majesty, \"Excellent exceedingly is what has been said to us;\"  and they sent them. And many days after these things the people who were  sent to strange lands came to give report unto the king: but there came  not those who went to the valley of the acacia, for Bata had slain them,  but let one of them return to give a report to the king. His majesty  sent many men and soldiers, as well as horsemen, to bring her back. And  there was a woman amongst them, and to her had been given in her hand  beautiful ornaments of a woman. And the girl came back with her, and  they rejoiced over her in the whole land.    And his majesty loved her exceedingly, and raised her to high estate;  and he spake unto her that she should tell him concerning her husband.  And she said, \"Let the acacia be cut down, and let one chop it up.\" And  they sent men and soldiers with their weapons to cut down the acacia;  and they came to the acacia, and they cut the flower upon which was the  soul of Bata, and he fell dead suddenly.    And when the next day came, and the earth was lightened, the acacia was  cut down. And Anpu, the elder brother of Bata, entered his house, and  washed his hands; and one gave him a cup of beer, and it became  troubled; and one gave him another of wine, and the smell of it was  evil. Then he took his staff, and his sandals, and likewise his clothes,  with his weapons of war; and he betook himself forth to the valley of  the acacia. He entered the tower of his younger brother, and he found  him lying upon his mat; he was dead. And he wept when he saw his younger  brother verily lying dead. And he went out to seek the soul of his  younger brother under the acacia tree, under which his younger brother  lay in the evening.    He spent three years in seeking for it, but found it not. And when he  began the fourth year, he desired in his heart to return into Egypt; he  said \"I will go to-morrow morn:\" thus spake he in his heart.    Now when the land lightened, and the next day appeared, he was walking  under the acacia; he was spending his time in seeking it. And he  returned in the evening, and laboured at seeking it again. He found a  seed. He returned with it. Behold this was the soul of his younger  brother. He brought a cup of cold water, and he cast the seed into it:  and he sat down, as he was wont. Now when the night came his soul sucked  up the water; Bata shuddered in all his limbs, and he looked on his  elder brother; his soul was in the cup. Then Anpu took the cup of cold  water, in which the soul of his younger brother was; Bata drank it, his  soul stood again in its place, and he became as he had been. They  embraced each other, and they conversed together.    And Bata said to his elder brother, \"Behold I am to become as a great  bull, which bears every good mark; no one knoweth its history, and thou  must sit upon my back. When the sun arises I shall be in the place where  my wife is, that I may return answer to her; and thou must take me to  the place where the king is. For all good things shall be done for thee;  for one shall lade thee with silver and gold, because thou bringest me  to Pharaoh, for I become a great marvel, and they shall rejoice for me  in all the land. And thou shalt go to thy village.\"    And when the land was lightened, and the next day appeared, Bata became  in the form which he had told to his elder brother. And Anpu sat upon  his back until the dawn. He came to the place where the king was, and  they made his majesty to know of him; he saw him, and he was exceeding  joyful with him. He made for him great offerings, saying,    \"This is a great wonder which has come to pass.\" There were rejoicings  over him in the whole land. They presented unto him silver and gold for  his elder brother, who went and stayed in his village. They gave to the  bull many men and many things, and Pharaoh loved him exceedingly above  all that is in this land.    And after many days after these things, the bull entered the purified  place; he stood in the place where the princess was; he began to speak  with her, saying, \"Behold, I am alive indeed.\" And she said to him,  \"And, pray, who art thou?\" He said to her, \"I am Bata. I perceived when  thou causedst that they should destroy the acacia of Pharaoh, which was  my abode, that I might not be suffered to live. Behold, I am alive  indeed, I am as an ox.\" Then the princess feared exceedingly for the  words that her husband had spoken to her. And he went out from the  purified place.    And his majesty was sitting, making a good day with her: she was at the  table of his majesty, and the king was exceeding pleased with her. And  she said to his majesty, \"Swear to me by God, saying, 'What thou shalt  say, I will obey it for thy sake.'\" He hearkened unto all that she said,  even this. \"Let me eat of the liver of the ox, because he is fit for  nought:\" thus spake she to him. And the king was exceeding sad at her  words, the heart of Pharaoh grieved him greatly. And after the land was  lightened, and the next day appeared, they proclaimed a great feast with  offerings to the ox. And the king sent one of the chief butchers of his  majesty, to cause the ox to be sacrificed. And when he was sacrificed,  as he was upon the shoulders of the people, he shook his neck, and he  threw two drops of blood over against the two doors of his majesty. The  one fell upon the one side, on the great door of Pharaoh, and the other  upon the other door. They grew as two great Persea trees, and each of  them was excellent.    And one went to tell unto his majesty, \"Two great Persea trees have  grown, as a great marvel of his majesty, in the night by the side of the  great gate of his majesty.\" And there was rejoicing for them in all the  land, and there were offerings made to them.    And when the days were multiplied after these things, his majesty was  adorned with the blue crown, with garlands of flowers on his neck, and  he was upon the chariot of pale gold, and he went out from the palace to  behold the Persea trees: the princess also was going out with horses  behind his majesty. And his majesty sat beneath one of the Persea trees,  and it spake thus with his wife: \"Oh thou deceitful one, I am Bata, I am  alive, though I have been evilly entreated. I knew who caused the acacia  to be cut down by Pharaoh at my dwelling. I then became an ox, and thou  causedst that I should be killed.\"    And many days after these things the princess stood at the table of  Pharaoh, and the king was pleased with her. And she said to his majesty,  \"Swear to me by God, saying, 'That which the princess shall say to me I  will obey it for her.'\" And he hearkened unto all she said. And he  commanded, \"Let these two Persea trees be cut down, and let them be made  into goodly planks.\" And he hearkened unto all she said. And after this  his majesty sent skilful craftsmen, and they cut down the Persea trees  of Pharaoh; and the princess, the royal wife, was standing looking on,  and they did all that was in her heart unto the trees. But a chip flew  up, and it entered into the mouth of the princess; she swallowed it, and  after many days she bore a son. And one went to tell his majesty, \"There  is born to thee a son.\" And they brought him, and gave to him a nurse  and servants; and there were rejoicings in the whole land. And the king  sat making a merry day, as they were about the naming of him, and his  majesty loved him exceedingly at that moment, and the king raised him to  be the royal son of Kush.    Now after the days had multiplied after these things, his majesty made  him heir of all the land. And many days after that, when he had  fulfilled many years as heir, his majesty flew up to heaven. And the  heir said, \"Let my great nobles of his majesty be brought before me,  that I may make them to know all that has happened to me.\" And they  brought also before him his wife, and he judged with her before him, and  they agreed with him. They brought to him his elder brother; he made him  hereditary prince in all his land. He was thirty years king of Egypt,  and he died, and his elder brother stood in his place on the day of  burial.    _Excellently finished in peace, for the_ ka _of the scribe of the  treasury Kagabu, of the treasury of Pharaoh, and for the scribe Hora,  and the scribe Meremapt.

Mike had seen enough of  Wyatt's bowling to know that it was merely ordinary \"slow tosh,\" and  the professional did not look as difficult as Saunders. The first  half-dozen balls he played carefully. He was on trial, and he meant to  take no risks. Then the professional over-pitched one slightly on the  off. Mike jumped out, and got the full face of the bat on to it. The  ball hit one of the ropes of the net, and nearly broke it.    \"How's that?\" said Wyatt, with the smile of an impresario on the first  night of a successful piece.    \"Not bad,\" admitted Burgess.    A few moments later he was still more complimentary. He got up and  took a ball himself.    Mike braced himself up as Burgess began his run. This time he was more  than a trifle nervous. The bowling he had had so far had been tame.  This would be the real ordeal.    As the ball left Burgess's hand he began instinctively to shape for a  forward stroke. Then suddenly he realised that the thing was going to  be a yorker, and banged his bat down in the block just as the ball  arrived. An unpleasant sensation as of having been struck by a  thunderbolt was succeeded by a feeling of relief that he had kept the  ball out of his wicket. There are easier things in the world than  stopping a fast yorker.    \"Well played,\" said Burgess.    Mike felt like a successful general receiving the thanks of the  nation.    The fact that Burgess's next ball knocked middle and off stumps out of  the ground saddened him somewhat; but this was the last tragedy that  occurred. He could not do much with the bowling beyond stopping it and  feeling repetitions of the thunderbolt experience, but he kept up his  end; and a short conversation which he had with Burgess at the end of  his innings was full of encouragement to one skilled in reading  between the lines.    \"Thanks awfully,\" said Mike, referring to the square manner in which  the captain had behaved in letting him bat.    \"What school were you at before you came here?\" asked Burgess.    \"A private school in Hampshire,\" said Mike. \"King-Hall's. At a place  called Emsworth.\"    \"Get much cricket there?\"    \"Yes, a good lot. One of the masters, a chap called Westbrook, was an  awfully good slow bowler.\"    Burgess nodded.    \"You don't run away, which is something,\" he said.    Mike turned purple with pleasure at this stately compliment. Then,  having waited for further remarks, but gathering from the captain's  silence that the audience was at an end, he proceeded to unbuckle his  pads. Wyatt overtook him on his way to the house.    \"Well played,\" he said. \"I'd no idea you were such hot stuff. You're a  regular pro.\"    \"I say,\" said Mike gratefully, \"it was most awfully decent of you  getting Burgess to let me go in. It was simply ripping of you.\"    \"Oh, that's all right. If you don't get pushed a bit here you stay for  ages in the hundredth game with the cripples and the kids. Now you've  shown them what you can do you ought to get into the Under Sixteen  team straight away. Probably into the third, too.\"    \"By Jove, that would be all right.\"    \"I asked Burgess afterwards what he thought of your batting, and he  said, 'Not bad.' But he says that about everything. It's his highest  form of praise. He says it when he wants to let himself go and simply  butter up a thing. If you took him to see N. A. Knox bowl, he'd say he  wasn't bad. What he meant was that he was jolly struck with your  batting, and is going to play you for the Under Sixteen.\"    \"I hope so,\" said Mike.    The prophecy was fulfilled. On the following Wednesday there was a  match between the Under Sixteen and a scratch side. Mike's name was  among the Under Sixteen. And on the Saturday he was playing for the  third eleven in a trial game.    \"This place is ripping,\" he said to himself, as he saw his name on the  list. \"Thought I should like it.\"    And that night he wrote a letter to his father, notifying him of the  fact.          CHAPTER V    REVELRY BY NIGHT      A succession of events combined to upset Mike during his first  fortnight at school. He was far more successful than he had any right  to be at his age. There is nothing more heady than success, and if it  comes before we are prepared for it, it is apt to throw us off our  balance. As a rule, at school, years of wholesome obscurity make us  ready for any small triumphs we may achieve at the end of our time  there. Mike had skipped these years. He was older than the average new  boy, and his batting was undeniable. He knew quite well that he was  regarded as a find by the cricket authorities; and the knowledge was  not particularly good for him. It did not make him conceited, for his  was not a nature at all addicted to conceit. The effect it had on him  was to make him excessively pleased with life. And when Mike was  pleased with life he always found a difficulty in obeying Authority  and its rules. His state of mind was not improved by an interview with  Bob.    Some evil genius put it into Bob's mind that it was his duty to be, if  only for one performance, the Heavy Elder Brother to Mike; to give him  good advice. It is never the smallest use for an elder brother to  attempt to do anything for the good of a younger brother at school,  for the latter rebels automatically against such interference in his  concerns; but Bob did not know this. He only knew that he had received  a letter from home, in which his mother had assumed without evidence  that he was leading Mike by the hand round the pitfalls of life at  Wrykyn; and his conscience smote him. Beyond asking him occasionally,  when they met, how he was getting on (a question to which Mike  invariably replied, \"Oh, all right\"), he was not aware of having done  anything brotherly towards the youngster. So he asked Mike to tea in  his study one afternoon before going to the nets.    Mike arrived, sidling into the study in the half-sheepish, half-defiant  manner peculiar to small brothers in the presence of their elders, and  stared in silence at the photographs on the walls. Bob was changing into  his cricket things. The atmosphere was one of constraint and awkwardness.    The arrival of tea was the cue for conversation.    \"Well, how are you getting on?\" asked Bob.    \"Oh, all right,\" said Mike.    Silence.    \"Sugar?\" asked Bob.    \"Thanks,\" said Mike.    \"How many lumps?\"    \"Two, please.\"    \"Cake?\"    \"Thanks.\"    Silence.    Bob pulled himself together.    \"Like Wain's?\"    \"Ripping.\"    \"I asked Firby-Smith to keep an eye on you,\" said Bob.    \"What!\" said Mike.    The mere idea of a worm like the Gazeka being told to keep an eye on  _him_ was degrading.    \"He said he'd look after you,\" added Bob, making things worse.    Look after him! Him!! M. Jackson, of the third eleven!!!    Mike helped himself to another chunk of cake, and spoke crushingly.    \"He needn't trouble,\" he said. \"I can look after myself all right,  thanks.\"    Bob saw an opening for the entry of the Heavy Elder Brother.    \"Look here, Mike,\" he said, \"I'm only saying it for your good----\"    I should like to state here that it was not Bob's habit to go about  the world telling people things solely for their good. He was only  doing it now to ease his conscience.    \"Yes?\" said Mike coldly.    \"It's only this. You know, I should keep an eye on myself if I were  you. There's nothing that gets a chap so barred here as side.\"    \"What do you mean?\" said Mike, outraged.    \"Oh, I'm not saying anything against you so far,\" said Bob. \"You've  been all right up to now. What I mean to say is, you've got on so well  at cricket, in the third and so on, there's just a chance you might  start to side about a bit soon, if you don't watch yourself. I'm not  saying a word against you so far, of course. Only you see what I  mean.\"    Mike's feelings were too deep for words. In sombre silence he reached  out for the jam; while Bob, satisfied that he had delivered his  message in a pleasant and tactful manner, filled his cup, and cast  about him for further words of wisdom.    \"Seen you about with Wyatt a good deal,\" he said at length.    \"Yes,\" said Mike.    \"Like him?\"    \"Yes,\" said Mike cautiously.    \"You know,\" said Bob, \"I shouldn't--I mean, I should take care what  you're doing with Wyatt.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"Well, he's an awfully good chap, of course, but still----\"    \"Still what?\"    \"Well, I mean, he's the sort of chap who'll probably get into some  thundering row before he leaves. He doesn't care a hang what he does.  He's that sort of chap. He's never been dropped on yet, but if you go  on breaking rules you're bound to be sooner or later. Thing is, it  doesn't matter much for him, because he's leaving at the end of the  term. But don't let him drag you into anything. Not that he would try  to. But you might think it was the blood thing to do to imitate him,  and the first thing you knew you'd be dropped on by Wain or somebody.  See what I mean?\"    Bob was well-intentioned, but tact did not enter greatly into his  composition.    \"What rot!\" said Mike.    \"All right. But don't you go doing it. I'm going over to the nets. I  see Burgess has shoved you down for them. You'd better be going and  changing. Stick on here a bit, though, if you want any more tea. I've  got to be off myself.\"    Mike changed for net-practice in a ferment of spiritual injury. It was  maddening to be treated as an infant who had to be looked after. He  felt very sore against Bob.    A good innings at the third eleven net, followed by some strenuous  fielding in the deep, soothed his ruffled feelings to a large extent;  and all might have been well but for the intervention of Firby-Smith.    That youth, all spectacles and front teeth, met Mike at the door of  Wain's.    \"Ah, I wanted to see you, young man,\" he said. (Mike disliked being  called \"young man.\") \"Come up to my study.\""]]]
