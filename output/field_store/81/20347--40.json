Upon their heads grows an enormous shock of bristly hair.    It was into the eyes of such as these and the terrible plant men that I  gazed above the shoulder of my foe, and then, in a mighty wave of  snarling, snapping, screaming, purring rage, they swept over me--and of  all the sounds that assailed my ears as I went down beneath them, to me  the most hideous was the horrid purring of the plant men.    Instantly a score of cruel fangs and keen talons were sunk into my  flesh; cold, sucking lips fastened themselves upon my arteries.  I  struggled to free myself, and even though weighed down by these immense  bodies, I succeeded in struggling to my feet, where, still grasping my  long-sword, and shortening my grip upon it until I could use it as a  dagger, I wrought such havoc among them that at one time I stood for an  instant free.    What it has taken minutes to write occurred in but a few seconds, but  during that time Tars Tarkas had seen my plight and had dropped from  the lower branches, which he had reached with such infinite labour, and  as I flung the last of my immediate antagonists from me the great Thark  leaped to my side, and again we fought, back to back, as we had done a  hundred times before.    Time and again the ferocious apes sprang in to close with us, and time  and again we beat them back with our swords.  The great tails of the  plant men lashed with tremendous power about us as they charged from  various directions or sprang with the agility of greyhounds above our  heads; but every attack met a gleaming blade in sword hands that had  been reputed for twenty years the best that Mars ever had known; for  Tars Tarkas and John Carter were names that the fighting men of the  world of warriors loved best to speak.    But even the two best swords in a world of fighters can avail not for  ever against overwhelming numbers of fierce and savage brutes that know  not what defeat means until cold steel teaches their hearts no longer  to beat, and so, step by step, we were forced back.  At length we stood  against the giant tree that we had chosen for our ascent, and then, as  charge after charge hurled its weight upon us, we gave back again and  again, until we had been forced half-way around the huge base of the  colossal trunk.    Tars Tarkas was in the lead, and suddenly I heard a little cry of  exultation from him.    \"Here is shelter for one at least, John Carter,\" he said, and, glancing  down, I saw an opening in the base of the tree about three feet in  diameter.    \"In with you, Tars Tarkas,\" I cried, but he would not go; saying that  his bulk was too great for the little aperture, while I might slip in  easily.    \"We shall both die if we remain without, John Carter; here is a slight  chance for one of us.  Take it and you may live to avenge me, it is  useless for me to attempt to worm my way into so small an opening with  this horde of demons besetting us on all sides.\"    \"Then we shall die together, Tars Tarkas,\" I replied, \"for I shall not  go first.  Let me defend the opening while you get in, then my smaller  stature will permit me to slip in with you before they can prevent.\"    We still were fighting furiously as we talked in broken sentences,  punctured with vicious cuts and thrusts at our swarming enemy.    At length he yielded, for it seemed the only way in which either of us  might be saved from the ever-increasing numbers of our assailants, who  were still swarming upon us from all directions across the broad valley.    \"It was ever your way, John Carter, to think last of your own life,\" he  said; \"but still more your way to command the lives and actions of  others, even to the greatest of Jeddaks who rule upon Barsoom.\"    There was a grim smile upon his cruel, hard face, as he, the greatest  Jeddak of them all, turned to obey the dictates of a creature of  another world--of a man whose stature was less than half his own.    \"If you fail, John Carter,\" he said, \"know that the cruel and heartless  Thark, to whom you taught the meaning of friendship, will come out to  die beside you.\"    \"As you will, my friend,\" I replied; \"but quickly now, head first,  while I cover your retreat.\"    He hesitated a little at that word, for never before in his whole life  of continual strife had he turned his back upon aught than a dead or  defeated enemy.    \"Haste, Tars Tarkas,\" I urged, \"or we shall both go down to profitless  defeat; I cannot hold them for ever alone.\"    As he dropped to the ground to force his way into the tree, the whole  howling pack of hideous devils hurled themselves upon me.  To right and  left flew my shimmering blade, now green with the sticky juice of a  plant man, now red with the crimson blood of a great white ape; but  always flying from one opponent to another, hesitating but the barest  fraction of a second to drink the lifeblood in the centre of some  savage heart.    And thus I fought as I never had fought before, against such frightful  odds that I cannot realize even now that human muscles could have  withstood that awful onslaught, that terrific weight of hurtling tons  of ferocious, battling flesh.    With the fear that we would escape them, the creatures redoubled their  efforts to pull me down, and though the ground about me was piled high  with their dead and dying comrades, they succeeded at last in  overwhelming me, and I went down beneath them for the second time that  day, and once again felt those awful sucking lips against my flesh.    But scarce had I fallen ere I felt powerful hands grip my ankles, and  in another second I was being drawn within the shelter of the tree's  interior.  For a moment it was a tug of war between Tars Tarkas and a  great plant man, who clung tenaciously to my breast, but presently I  got the point of my long-sword beneath him and with a mighty thrust  pierced his vitals.    Torn and bleeding from many cruel wounds, I lay panting upon the ground  within the hollow of the tree, while Tars Tarkas defended the opening  from the furious mob without.    For an hour they howled about the tree, but after a few attempts to  reach us they confined their efforts to terrorizing shrieks and  screams, to horrid growling on the part of the great white apes, and  the fearsome and indescribable purring by the plant men.    At length, all but a score, who had apparently been left to prevent our  escape, had left us, and our adventure seemed destined to result in a  siege, the only outcome of which could be our death by starvation; for  even should we be able to slip out after dark, whither in this unknown  and hostile valley could we hope to turn our steps toward possible  escape?    As the attacks of our enemies ceased and our eyes became accustomed to  the semi-darkness of the interior of our strange retreat, I took the  opportunity to explore our shelter.    The tree was hollow to an extent of about fifty feet in diameter, and  from its flat, hard floor I judged that it had often been used to  domicile others before our occupancy.  As I raised my eyes toward its  roof to note the height I saw far above me a faint glow of light.    There was an opening above.  If we could but reach it we might still  hope to make the shelter of the cliff caves.  My eyes had now become  quite used to the subdued light of the interior, and as I pursued my  investigation I presently came upon a rough ladder at the far side of  the cave.    Quickly I mounted it, only to find that it connected at the top with  the lower of a series of horizontal wooden bars that spanned the now  narrow and shaft-like interior of the tree's stem.  These bars were set  one above another about three feet apart, and formed a perfect ladder  as far above me as I could see.    Dropping to the floor once more, I detailed my discovery to Tars  Tarkas, who suggested that I explore aloft as far as I could go in  safety while he guarded the entrance against a possible attack.    As I hastened above to explore the strange shaft I found that the  ladder of horizontal bars mounted always as far above me as my eyes  could reach, and as I ascended, the light from above grew brighter and  brighter.    For fully five hundred feet I continued to climb, until at length I  reached the opening in the stem which admitted the light.  It was of  about the same diameter as the entrance at the foot of the tree, and  opened directly upon a large flat limb, the well worn surface of which  testified to its long continued use as an avenue for some creature to  and from this remarkable shaft.    I did not venture out upon the limb for fear that I might be discovered  and our retreat in this direction cut off; but instead hurried to  retrace my steps to Tars Tarkas.    I soon reached him and presently we were both ascending the long ladder  toward the opening above.    Tars Tarkas went in advance and as I reached the first of the  horizontal bars I drew the ladder up after me and, handing it to him,  he carried it a hundred feet further aloft, where he wedged it safely  between one of the bars and the side of the shaft.  In like manner I  dislodged the lower bars as I passed them, so that we soon had the  interior of the tree denuded of all possible means of ascent for a  distance of a hundred feet from the base; thus precluding possible  pursuit and attack from the rear.    As we were to learn later, this precaution saved us from dire  predicament, and was eventually the means of our salvation.    When we reached the opening at the top Tars Tarkas drew to one side  that I might pass out and investigate, as, owing to my lesser weight  and greater agility, I was better fitted for the perilous threading of  this dizzy, hanging pathway.    The limb upon which I found myself ascended at a slight angle toward  the cliff, and as I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6422"],[0,"The Life, Adventures & Piracies of the Famous Captain Singleton (#5)"],[1,"fellow that had no solid thought ever placed in his  mind could be supposed to be. Education, as you have heard, I had none;  and all the little scenes of life I had passed through had been full  of dangers and desperate circumstances; but I was either so young or so  stupid, that I escaped the grief and anxiety of them, for want of having  a sense of their tendency and consequences.    This thoughtless, unconcerned temper had one felicity indeed in it, that  it made me daring and ready for doing any mischief, and kept off the  sorrow which otherwise ought to have attended me when I fell into any  mischief; that this stupidity was instead of a happiness to me, for it  left my thoughts free to act upon means of escape and deliverance in my  distress, however great it might be; whereas my companions in the misery  were so sunk by their fear and grief, that they abandoned themselves to  the misery of their condition, and gave over all thought but of their  perishing and starving, being devoured by wild beasts, murdered, and  perhaps eaten by cannibals, and the like.    I was but a young fellow, about seventeen or eighteen; but hearing what  was to be my fate, I received it with no appearance of discouragement;  but I asked what my master said to it, and being told that he had used  his utmost interest to save me, but the captain had answered I should  either go on shore or be hanged on board, which he pleased, I then gave  over all hope of being received again. I was not very thankful in my  thoughts to my master for his soliciting the captain for me, because I  knew that what he did was not in kindness to me so much as in kindness  to himself; I mean, to preserve the wages which he got for me, which  amounted to above six dollars a month, including what the captain  allowed him for my particular service to him.    When I understood that my master was so apparently kind, I asked if I  might not be admitted to speak with him, and they told me I might, if my  master would come down to me, but I could not be allowed to come up to  him; so then I desired my master might be spoke to to come to me, and he  accordingly came to me. I fell on my knees to him, and begged he would  forgive me what I had done to displease him; and indeed the resolution  I had taken to murder him lay with some horror upon my mind just at  that time, so that I was once just a-going to confess it, and beg him  to forgive me, but I kept it in. He told me he had done all he could to  obtain my pardon of the captain, but could not and he knew no way for me  but to have patience, and submit to my fate; and if they came to speak  with any ship of their nation at the Cape, he would endeavour to have  them stand in, and fetch us off again, if we might be found.    Then I begged I might have my clothes on shore with me. He told me he  was afraid I should have little need of clothes, for he did not see how  we could long subsist on the island, and that he had been told that the  inhabitants were cannibals or men-eaters (though he had no reason for  that suggestion), and we should not be able to live among them. I  told him I was not so afraid of that as I was of starving for want of  victuals; and as for the inhabitants being cannibals, I believed we  should be more likely to eat them than they us, if we could but get at  them. But I was mightily concerned, I said, we should have no weapons  with us to defend ourselves, and I begged nothing now, but that he would  give me a gun and a sword, with a little powder and shot.    He smiled, and said they would signify nothing to us, for it was  impossible for us to pretend to preserve our lives among such a populous  and desperate nation as the people of this island were. I told him that,  however, it would do us this good, for we should not be devoured or  destroyed immediately; so I begged hard for the gun. At last he told me  he did not know whether the captain would give him leave to give me a  gun, and if not, he durst not do it; but he promised to use his interest  to obtain it for me, which he did, and the next day he sent me a gun,  with some ammunition, but told me the captain would not suffer the  ammunition to be given us till we were set all on shore, and till he  was just going to set sail. He also sent me the few clothes I had in the  ship, which indeed were not many.    Two days after this, we were all carried on shore together; the rest  of my fellow-criminals hearing I had a gun, and some powder and shot,  solicited for liberty to carry the like with them, which was also  granted them; and thus we were set on shore to shift for ourselves.    At our first coming into the island we were terrified exceedingly with  the sight of the barbarous people, whose figure was made more terrible  to us than it really was by the report we had of them from the seamen;  but when we came to converse with them awhile, we found they were not  cannibals, as was reported, or such as would fall immediately upon us  and eat us up; but they came and sat down by us, and wondered much at  our clothes and arms, and made signs to give us some victuals, such as  they had, which was only roots and plants dug out of the ground for the  present, but they brought us fowls and flesh afterwards in good plenty.    This encouraged the other four men that were with me very much, for they  were quite dejected before; but now they began to be very familiar with  them, and made signs, that if they would use us kindly, we would stay  and live with them; which they seemed glad of, though they knew little  of the necessity we were under to do so, or how much we were afraid of  them.    However, upon second thoughts we resolved that we would only stay in  that part so long as the ship rid in the bay, and then making them  believe we were gone with the ship, we would go and place ourselves, if  possible, where there were no inhabitants to be seen, and so live as we  could, or perhaps watch for a ship that might be driven upon the coast  as we were.    The ship continued a fortnight in the roads, repairing some damage which  had been done her in the late storm, and taking in wood and water; and  during this time, the boat coming often on shore, the men brought us  several refreshments, and the natives believing we only belonged to the  ship, were civil enough. We lived in a kind of a tent on the shore, or  rather a hut, which we made with the boughs of trees, and sometimes in  the night retired to a wood a little out of their way, to let them  think we were gone on board the ship. However, we found them barbarous,  treacherous, and villainous enough in their nature, only civil from  fear, and therefore concluded we should soon fall into their hands when  the ship was gone.    The sense of this wrought upon my fellow-sufferers even to distraction;  and one of them, being a carpenter, in his mad fit, swam off to the ship  in the night, though she lay then a league to sea, and made such pitiful  moan to be taken in, that the captain was prevailed with at last to take  him in, though they let him lie swimming three hours in the water before  he consented to it.    Upon this, and his humble submission, the captain received him, and, in  a word, the importunity of this man (who for some time petitioned to be  taken in, though they hanged him as soon as they had him) was such as  could not be resisted; for, after he had swam so long about the ship,  he was not able to reach the shore again; and the captain saw evidently  that the man must be taken on board or suffered to drown, and the whole  ship's company offering to be bound for him for his good behaviour, the  captain at last yielded, and he was taken up, but almost dead with his  being so long in the water.    When this man was got in, he never left importuning the captain, and all  the rest of the officers, in behalf of us that were behind, but to  the very last day the captain was inexorable; when, at the time their  preparations were making to sail, and orders given to hoist the boats  into the ship, all the seamen in a body came up to the rail of the  quarter-deck, where the captain was walking with some of his officers,  and appointing the boatswain to speak for them, he went up, and falling  on his knees to the captain, begged of him, in the humblest manner  possible, to receive the four men on board again, offering to answer for  their fidelity, or to have them kept in chains till they came to Lisbon,  and there to be delivered up to justice, rather than, as they said, to  have them left to be murdered by savages, or devoured by wild beasts. It  was a great while ere the captain took any notice of them, but when he  did, he ordered the boatswain to be seized, and threatened to bring him  to the capstan for speaking for them.    Upon this severity, one of the seamen, bolder than the rest, but still  with all possible respect to the captain, besought his honour, as he  called him, that he would give leave to some more of them to go on  shore, and die with their companions, or, if possible, to assist them  to resist the barbarians. The captain, rather provoked than cowed with  this, came to the barricade of the quarter-deck, and speaking very  prudently to the men (for had he spoken roughly, two-thirds of them  would have left the ship, if not all of them), he told them, it was  for their safety as well as his own that he had been obliged to that  severity; that mutiny on board a ship was the same thing as treason in a  king's palace, and he could not answer it to his owners and employers  to trust the ship and goods committed to his charge with men who had  entertained thoughts of the worst and blackest nature; that he wished  heartily that it had been anywhere else that they had been set on shore,  where they might have been in less hazard from the savages; that, if he  had designed they should be destroyed, he could as well have executed  them on board as the other two; that he"]]]
