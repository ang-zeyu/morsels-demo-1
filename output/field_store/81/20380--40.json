It was but yesterday that I set my men-at-arms to try and bend  one of these English bows, and not one of them could draw an arrow  anywhere near the head with all their efforts; while these men seem to do  so with the greatest ease, and the speed with which they can shoot off  arrow after arrow well-nigh passes belief. That tall fellow, who is their  chief, but now sent twenty arrows into a space no greater than a hand's-breadth, at a hundred and twenty yards, and that so quickly that he scarce  seemed to take time to aim at all, and the others are well-nigh as  skilful. Yesterday I put up a breastplate such as is worn by our men-at-arms and asked them to shoot at it at eighty yards. They fired a volley  together at it. It was riddled like a colander; not one of the five-and-twenty arrows had failed to pierce it.\"    \"Ay, at that distance, Captain, an English archer of fair skill could not  miss it, and it needs Milan armour, and that of the best, to keep out  their arrows.\"    \"By our Lady,\" the captain remarked, \"I should be sorry to attack a castle  defended by them, and our lord has done well indeed to bring them over  with him. Your men-at-arms are stalwart fellows. My own men feel well-nigh  abashed when they see how these men take up a stone that they themselves  can with difficulty lift from the ground, and hurl it twenty yards away;  and they whirl their heavy axes round their heads as if they were reeds.\"    \"They are all picked men,\" Guy said with a laugh. \"You must not take it  that all Englishmen are of equal strength, though no doubt Sir Eustace  could have gathered five hundred as strong had he wished it.\"    \"If that be so,\" the captain said, \"I can well believe that if France and  England meet again on a field of battle France shall be beaten as she was  before. However, there is one comfort, we shall not be among the defeated;  for our lord, and his father and his grandfather before, him, have ever  been with England, and Sir Eustace, having an English wife and mother, and  being a vassal of the English crown for his estates in England, will  assuredly take their part in case of a quarrel. Of course, at present we  hold ourselves to be neutrals, and though our lord's leanings towards  England give some umbrage to his neighbours, their enmity finds no  expression, since for years now there has been no righting to speak of  between the two nations. How it will be if Orleans and Burgundy come to  blows I know not; but if they do so, methinks our lord will have to  declare for one or the other, or he may have both upon him. A man with  broad estates, on which many cast covetous eyes, can scarce stand  altogether aloof. However, if Villeroy is attacked, methinks that with the  following Sir Eustace has brought with him across the sea even Burgundy  himself will find that it would cost him so dearly to capture the castle  that it were best left alone.\"    \"How about the vassals?\"    \"They will fight for their lord,\" Jean Bouvard answered confidently. \"You  see their fathers and grandfathers fought under the Black Prince, and it  is natural that their leanings should be on that side. Then they know that  there is no better lord in all Artois than Sir Eustace, and his dame has  made herself much beloved among them all. There is no fear that they will  disobey our lord's orders whatever they be, and will fight as he bids  them, for Orleans or Burgundy, England or France. He has never exercised  to the full his rights of seigneur; he has never called upon them for  their full quota of work; no man has even been hung on his estate for two  generations save for crime committed; no vassal's daughter has ever been  carried into the castle. I tell you there is not a man for over fifty  miles round who does not envy the vassals of Villeroy, and this would be a  happy land indeed were all lords like ours. Were we to hoist the flag on  the keep and fire a gun, every man on the estate would muster here before  sunset, and would march against the King of France himself did Sir Eustace  order them to do so.\"    \"In that case what force could we put on the walls, Captain?\"    \"Two hundred men besides the garrison, and we have provisions stored away  in the keep sufficient for them and their women and children for a three  months' siege. Sir Eustace gave me orders yesterday to procure wood of the  kind used for arrows, and to lay in a great store of it; also to set the  smiths to work to make arrow-heads. I asked him how many, and he said,  'Let them go on at it until further orders. I should like a store  sufficient at least for a hundred rounds for each of these English  archers, and if we had double that it would be all the better. They can  make their own arrows if they have suitable wood.' It seemed to me that  two hundred rounds was beyond all necessity, but now when I see that these  men can shoot nigh twenty rounds a minute, I can well understand that a  great supply for them is needful.\"    The time passed very pleasantly at Villeroy. Sometimes Guy rode with his  lord and lady when they went out hawking or paid visits to neighbouring  castles. Regularly every day they practised for two hours in arms, and  although well instructed before, Guy gained much additional skill from the  teaching of Jean Bouvard, who was a famous swordsman. The latter was  surprised at finding that the page was able to draw the English bows as  well as the archers, and that, although inferior to Long Tom and three or  four of the best shots, he was quite as good a marksman as the majority.  Moreover, though of gentle blood he would join with the men in their bouts  of quarter-staff, and took no more heed of a broken head than they did.    [Illustration: GUY HAS HIS HEAD BOUND UP AFTER A BOUT AT QUARTER-STAFF.]    \"_Pardieu_, master page,\" he said one day when Guy came in from the  court-yard to have his head, which was streaming with blood, bound up,  \"our French pages would marvel indeed if they saw you. They all practise  in arms as you do, save with the shooting; but they would consider it  would demean them sorely to join in such rough sports with their  inferiors, or to run the risk of getting their beauty spoiled by a rough  blow. No wonder your knights strike so mightily in battle when they are  accustomed to strike so heavily in sport. I saw one of your men-at-arms  yesterday bury his axe to the very head in a block of oak; he wagered a  stoup of wine that no two of my men-at-arms would get the axe out, and he  won fairly, for indeed it took four of the knaves at the handle to tug it  out, and then indeed it needed all their strength. No armour ever forged  could have withstood such a blow; it-would have cracked both the casque  and the skull inside like egg-shells. It seemed to me that a thousand such  men, with as many archers, could march through France from end to end, if  they kept well together, and were well supplied with meat and drink by the  way--they would need that, for they are as good trenchermen as they are  fighters, and indeed each man amongst them eats as much as three of my  fellows.\"    \"Yes, they want to be well fed,\" Guy laughed, \"and they are rarely pleased  with the provision that you make for them; surely not one of them ever fed  so well before.\"    \"Food does not cost much,\" the captain said; \"we have herds of our own  which run half wild on the low ground near the river, which our lords  always keep in hand for their own uses, and they multiply so fast that  they are all the better for thinning; we sell a few occasionally, but they  are so wild that it scarce pays the trouble of driving them to the nearest  market, and we are always ready to grant permission to any of the vassals,  whose cattle have not done as well as usual, to go out and kill one or two  for meat.\"    \"I hear from the Governor of Calais,\" Sir Eustace said, when he returned  from a visit to that town, \"that a truce has been agreed upon between  England and France for a year; it is France who asked for it, I suppose.  Both parties here wanted to be able to fight it out without interference.  Here, in Artois, where the Burgundians are most numerous, they will  profit, as they will have no fear of England trying to regain some of her  lost territory, while in the south it will leave Armagnac and his friends  equally free from English incursions from Guienne.\"    \"And how will it affect us, Eustace?\" his wife asked.    \"That I have not been able fully to determine. At any rate they will have  no excuse for attacking us upon the ground that we are partly English, and  wholly so in feeling; but upon the other hand, if we are attacked either  by Burgundians or Orleanists, we cannot hope, as we should have done  before, for aid from Calais, lying as we do some fifteen miles beyond the  frontier. Amiens has already declared for Burgundy, in spite of the fact  that a royal proclamation has been issued, and sent to every town and  bailiwick through France, strictly commanding all persons whatsoever not  to interfere, or in any manner to assist the Dukes of Orleans or Burgundy  in their quarrels with each other. I hear that the Duke of Burgundy has  seized Roye, Nesle, and Ham, and a number of other places, and that both  parties are fortifying all their towns. They say, too, that there is news  that the king has again been seized with one of his fits of madness.  However, that matters little. He has of late been a tool in the hands of  Burgundy, and the royal signature has no weight one way or the other.  However, now that hostilities have begun, we must lose no time, for at any  moment one party or the other may make a sudden attack upon us. Burgundy  and Orleans may quarrel, but it is not for love of one or the other that  most of the nobles will join in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7065"],[0,"Children of the Bush (#5)"],[1," There's the shearer, fresh with his cheque from a cut-out shed,  gloriously drunk and happy, in love with all the world, and ready to  subscribe towards any creed and shout for all hands--including Old  Nick if he happened to come along. There's the shearer, half-drunk and  inclined to be nasty, who has got the wrong end of all things with  a tight grip, and who flings a shilling in the face of out-back  conventionality (as he thinks) by chucking a bob into the Salvation Army  ring. Then he glares round to see if he can catch anybody winking behind  his back. There's the cynical joker, a queer mixture, who contributes  generously and tempts the reformed boozer afterwards. There's the  severe-faced old station-hand--in clean shirt and neckerchief and white  moleskins--in for his annual or semi-annual spree, who contributes on  principle, and then drinks religiously until his cheque is gone and the  horrors are come. There's the shearer, feeling mighty bad after a spree,  and in danger of seeing things when he tries to go to sleep. He has  dropped ten or twenty pounds over bar counters and at cards, and he now  \"chucks\" a repentant shilling into the ring, with a very private and  rather vague sort of feeling that something might come of it. There's  the stout, contented, good-natured publican, who tips the Army as if it  were a barrel-organ. And there are others and other reasons--black sheep  and ne'er-do-wells--and faint echoes of other times in Salvation Army  tunes.    Bourke, the metropolis of the Great Scrubs, on the banks of the Darling  River, about five hundred miles from Sydney, was suffering from a long  drought when I was there in ninety-two; and the heat may or may not have  been another cause contributing to the success, from a business point of  view, of the Bourke garrison. There was much beer boozing--and, besides,  it was vaguely understood (as most things are vaguely understood out  there in the drought-haze) that the place the Army came to save us from  was hotter than Bourke. We didn't hanker to go to a hotter place than  Bourke. But that year there was an extraordinary reason for the Army's  great financial success there.    She was a little girl, nineteen or twenty, I should judge, the prettiest  girl I ever saw in the Army, and one of the prettiest I've ever seen  out of it. She had the features of an angel, but her expression was  wonderfully human, sweet and sympathetic. Her big grey eyes were sad  with sympathy for sufferers and sinners, and her poke bonnet was full  of bunchy, red-gold hair. Her first appearance was somewhat  dramatic--perhaps the Army arranged it so.    The Army used to pray, and thump the drum, and sing, and take up  collections every evening outside Watty Bothways' Hotel, the Carriers'  Arms. They performed longer and more often outside Watty's than any  other pub in town--perhaps because Watty was considered the most  hopeless publican and his customers the hardest crowd of boozers in  Bourke. The band generally began to play about dusk. Watty would lean  back comfortably in a basket easy-chair on his wide veranda, and clasp  his hands, in a calm, contented way, while the Army banged the drum and  got steam up, and whilst, perhaps, there was a barney going on in the  bar, or a bloodthirsty fight in the backyard. On such occasions there  was something like an indulgent or fatherly expression on his fat and  usually emotionless face. And by and by he'd move his head gently and  doze. The banging and the singing seemed to soothe him, and the praying,  which was often very personal, never seemed to disturb him in the least.    Well, it was about dusk one day; it had been a terrible day, a hundred  and something startling in the shade, but there came a breeze after  sunset. There had been several dozen of buckets of water thrown on the  veranda floor and the ground outside. Watty was seated in his accustomed  place when the Army arrived. There was no barney in the bar because  there was a fight in the backyard, and that claimed the attention of all  the customers.    The Army prayed for Watty and his clients; then a reformed drunkard  started to testify against publicans and all their works. Watty settled  himself comfortably, folded his hands, and leaned back and dozed.    The fight was over, and the chaps began to drop round to the bar. The  man who was saved waved his arms, and danced round and howled.    \"Ye-es!\" he shouted hoarsely. \"The publicans, and boozers, and gamblers,  and sinners may think that Bourke is hot, but hell is a thousand times  hotter! I tell you\"    \"Oh, Lord!\" said Mitchell, the shearer, and he threw a penny into the  ring.    \"Ye-es! I tell you that hell is a million times hotter than Bourke! I  tell you----\"    \"Oh, look here,\" said a voice from the background, \"that won't wash.  Why, don't you know that when the Bourke people die they send back for  their blankets?\"    The saved brother glared round.    \"I hear a freethinker speaking, my friends,\" he said. Then, with sudden  inspiration and renewed energy, \"I hear the voice of a freethinker. Show  me the face of a freethinker,\" he yelled, glaring round like a hunted,  hungry man. \"Show me the face of a freethinker, and I'll tell you what  he is.\"    Watty hitched himself into a more comfortable position and clasped his  hands on his knee and closed his eyes again.    \"Ya-a-a-s!\" shrieked the brand. \"I tell you, my friends, I can tell a  freethinker by his face. Show me the face of a----\"    At this point there was an interruption. One-eyed, or Wall-eyed, Bogan,  who had a broken nose, and the best side of whose face was reckoned the  ugliest and most sinister--One-eyed Bogan thrust his face forward from  the ring of darkness into the torchlight of salvation. He had got the  worst of a drawn battle; his nose and mouth were bleeding, and his good  eye was damaged.    \"Look at my face!\" he snarled, with dangerous earnestness. \"Look at my  face! That's the face of a freethinker, and I don't care who knows it.  Now! what have you got to say against my face, `Man-without-a-Shirt?'\"    The brother drew back. He had been known in the northwest in his sinful  days as \"Man-without-a-Shirt,\" alias \"Shirty,\" or \"The Dirty Man,\" and  was flabbergasted at being recognized in speech. Also, he had been in  a shearing-shed and in a shanty orgy with One-eyed Bogan, and knew the  man.    Now most of the chaps respected the Army, and, indeed, anything  that looked like religion, but the Bogan's face, as representing  free-thought, was a bit too sudden for them. There were sounds on the  opposite side of the ring as from men being smitten repeatedly and  rapidly below the belt, and long Tom Hall and one or two others got away  into the darkness in the background, where Tom rolled helplessly on the  grass and sobbed.    It struck me that Bogan's face was more the result of free speech than  anything else.    The Army was about to pray when the Pretty Girl stepped forward, her  eyes shining with indignation and enthusiasm. She had arrived by the  evening train, and had been standing shrinkingly behind an Army lass of  fifty Australian summers, who was about six feet high, flat and broad,  and had a square face, and a mouth like a joint in boiler plates.    The Pretty Girl stamped her pretty foot on the gravel, and her eyes  flashed in the torchlight.    \"You ought to be ashamed of yourselves,\" she said. \"Great big men like  you to be going on the way you are. If you were ignorant or poor, as  I've seen people, there might be some excuse for you. Haven't you got  any mothers, or sisters, or wives to think of? What sort of a life is  this you lead? Drinking, and gambling, and fighting, and swearing  your lives away! Do you ever think of God and the time when you were  children? Why don't you make homes? Look at that man's face!\" (she  pointed suddenly at Bogan, who collapsed and sidled behind his mates out  of the light). \"Look at that man's face! Is it a face for a Christian?  And you help and encourage him to fight. You're worse than he is. Oh,  it's brutal. It's--it's wicked. Great big men like you, you ought to be  ashamed of yourselves.\"    Long Bob Brothers--about six-foot-four--the longest and most innocent  there, shrunk down by the wall and got his inquiring face out of the  light. The Pretty Girl fluttered on for a few moments longer, greatly  excited, and then stepped back, seemingly much upset, and was taken  under the wing of the woman with the boiler-plate mouth.    It was a surprise, and very sudden. Bogan slipped round to the backyard,  and was seen bathing his battered features at the pump. The rest wore  the expression of men who knew that something unusual has happened, but  don't know what, and are waiting vacantly for developments.--Except Tom  Hall, who had recovered and returned. He stood looking over the head of  the ring of bushmen, and apparently taking the same critical interest in  the girl as he would in a fight--his expression was such as a journalist  might wear who is getting exciting copy.    The Army had it all their own way for the rest of the evening, and made  a good collection. The Pretty Girl stood smiling round with shining eyes  as the bobs and tanners dropped in, and then, being shoved forward by  the flat woman, she thanked us sweetly, and said we were good fellows,  and that she was sorry for some things she'd said to us. Then she  retired, fluttering and very much flushed, and hid herself behind the  hard woman--who, by the way, had an excrescence on her upper lip which  might have stood for a rivet.    Presently the Pretty Girl came from behind the big woman and stood  watching things with glistening eyes. Some of the chaps on the opposite  side of the ring moved a little to one side and all were careful not  to meet her eye--not to be caught looking at her--lest she should be  embarrassed. Watty had roused himself a little at the sound of a strange  voice in the"]]]
