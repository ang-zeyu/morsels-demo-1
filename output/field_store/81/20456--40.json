The creek seems to drain the large  stony plains that we crossed; the water is three and a half feet deep,  ten yards wide, by forty yards long.    Monday, 21st June, Water Creek. Started at 9.30 a.m. on a course of 25  degrees. At a mile passed a small table-topped hill to the west of our  line; at three miles and a half crossed the creek; at four miles passed  another table-topped hill connected with the low range to the east, and  passed the first ironstone hill; at seven miles changed to 55 degrees; at  eight miles halted at a large permanent water hole (Andamoka). I can with  safety say that this is permanent; it is a splendid water hole, nearly as  large as the one at the mouth of the gorge in the John. The low range to  the east of our course, and running nearly parallel with it, is composed  of conglomerate, quartz, and a little ironstone. Part of to-day's journey  was over low undulating sandy and very well grassed country. There seems  to have been a little rain here lately; the grass is springing  beautifully. At eleven miles we came upon a salt lagoon (Wealaroo) two  miles long by one broad. From the north end of it, on a bearing of 55  degrees, one mile and a half will strike Andamoka. I think we have now  left the western sand hills behind us; and now that we have permanent  water to fall back on, I shall strike into the north-west to-morrow. The  distance travelled to-day was fifteen miles. The country around this  water consists of bold stony rises and sand, with salt bush and grass; no  timber except mulga and a few myall bushes in the creek. On an  examination of the creek, we have found salt water above and below this  hole. In one place above there are cakes of salt one inch and a half  thick, a convincing proof that this is supplied by springs.    Tuesday, 22nd June, Andamoka. Started on a bearing of 342 degrees. At  seven miles and a half, crossed a low stony range running east-north-east  and west-south-west, which turned out to be table land, with sand hills  crossing our line, bearing to a high range east of us 93 degrees 30  minutes. About eight miles in the same direction there is the appearance  of a long salt lake. At nine miles and a half, on a sand hill, I obtained  the following bearings: Mount North-west, 60 degrees 30 minutes; Mount  Deception, 95 degrees. At eleven miles and a half passed a large reedy  swamp on our left, dry. At seventeen miles sand hills ceased. At eighteen  miles and a half the sand hills again commenced, and we changed our  course to north for three miles. Camped for the night at a creek of  permanent water, very good. The last four miles of to-day's journey have  been over very stony rises with salt bush and a little grass.    Wednesday, 23rd June, Permanent Water Creek. The horses had strayed so  far that we did not get a start until 10 a.m. Bearing to-day, 318  degrees. At two miles crossed a tea-tree creek, in which there is water,  coming from the stony rises, and running to the north of east. At six  miles the sand hills again commence. To this place we have come over a  stony plain, covered on the surface with fragments of limestone, quartz,  and ironstone, with salt bush and grass. In a watery season it must be  well covered with grass; the old grass is lying between the salt bushes.  We have a view of part of the lake (Torrens) bearing north-east about  fifteen or twenty miles from us; to the west again the stony rises,  apparently more open. At ten miles, in the sand hills, we have again a  view of Flinders range. The bearings are: Mount North-west, 78 degrees 35  minutes; Mount Deception, 107 degrees. At fourteen and a half miles we  found a clay-pan of water, with beautiful green feed for the horses. As  we don't know when we shall find more water, and as Forster has a damper  to bake, I decide to camp for the rest of the day. Our route has lain  over heavy sand hills for the last eight miles.    Thursday, 24th June, Sand Hills. At 8.30 we left on a course of 340  degrees, commencing with about two miles of rather heavy sand hills. At  eight miles these sand hills diminished, and the valleys between them  became much wider--both sand hills and valleys being well covered with  grass and salt bush, with courses of lime and ironstone cropping out and  running east and west. At twelve miles changed our course to 79 degrees,  to examine a gum creek (Yarraout), which we ran down for water, but did  not obtain it before four miles, when we found a small hole of rain  water. This creek seems to be a hunting-ground of the natives, as we saw  a great many summer worleys on its banks. They had evidently been here  to-day, for, a little above where we first struck the creek, we saw some  smoke, but on following it up, we found they had gone; most likely they  had seen us and run away. The latter part of our journey to-day was over  a stony plain, bounded on the west by the stony table land with the sand  hills on the top. All this country seems to have been under water, and is  most likely the bed of Lake Torrens, or Captain Sturt's inland sea. In  travelling over the plains, one is reminded of going over a rough,  gravelly beach; the stones are all rounded and smooth. Distance to-day,  thirty miles.    Friday, 25th June, Yarraout Gum Creek. Started at 9.40 from the point  where we first struck the creek last night, bearing 20 degrees for two  miles, thence 61 degrees for one mile to a high sand hill, thence 39  degrees for one mile to a stony rise. My doubt of the black fellow's  knowledge of the country is now confirmed; he seems to be quite lost, and  knows nothing of the country, except what he has heard other blacks  relate; he is quite bewildered and points all round when I ask him the  direction of Wingillpin. I have determined to push into the westward,  keeping a little north of west. Bearing 292 degrees for five miles, sand  hills; thence 327 degrees to a table-hill nine miles. Camped without  water. Our route to-day has been through sand hills, with a few miles of  stones and dry reedy swamp, all well grassed, but no water. We came  across some natives, who kept a long distance off. I sent our black up to  them, to ask in which direction Wingillpin lay. They pointed to the  course I was then steering, and said, \"Five sleeps.\" They would not come  near to us. About three-quarters of an hour afterwards I came suddenly  upon another native, who was hunting in the sand hills. My attention  being engaged in keeping the bearing, I did not observe him until he  moved, but I pulled up at once, lest he should run away, and called to  him. What he imagined I was I do not know; but when he turned round and  saw me, I never beheld a finer picture of astonishment and fear. He was a  fine muscular fellow, about six feet in height, and stood as if riveted  to the spot, with his mouth wide open, and his eyes staring. I sent our  black forward to speak with him, but omitted to tell him to dismount. The  terrified native remained motionless, allowing our black to ride within a  few yards of him, when, in an instant, he threw down his waddies, and  jumped up into a mulga bush as high as he could, one foot being about  three feet from the ground, and the other about two feet higher, and kept  waving us off with his hand as we advanced. I expected every moment to  see the bush break with his weight. When close under the bush, I told our  black to inquire if he were a Wingillpin native. He was so frightened he  could not utter a word, and trembled from head to foot. We then asked him  where Wingillpin was. He mustered courage to let go one hand, and  emphatically snapping his fingers in a north-west direction, again waved  us off. I take this emphatic snapping of his fingers to mean a long  distance. Probably this Wingillpin may be Cooper's Creek. We then left  him, and proceeded on our way through the sand hills. About an hour  before sunset, we came in full sight of a number of tent and table-topped  hills to the north-west, the stony table land being to the south of us,  and the dip of the country still towards Lake Torrens. I shall keep a  little more to the west to-morrow if possible, to get the fall of the  country the other way. The horses' shoes have been worn quite thin by the  stones, and will not last above a day or two. Nay, some of the poor  animals are already shoeless. It is most unfortunate that we did not  bring another set with us. Distance to-day, twenty-four miles.    Saturday, 26th June, Edge of Plain. Started at 9.30 a.m., on a bearing of  314 degrees 30 minutes, over an undulating plain, with low sand hills and  wide valleys, with plenty of grass and salt bush. After ten miles the  sand hills ceased, and at thirteen miles we reached the point of the  stony table land. Here we saw, to the north-north-west, what was  apparently a large gum creek, running north-east and south-west. Changing  our bearing to 285 degrees, after seven miles of very bad stony plain,  thinly covered with salt bush and grass, we came upon the creek, and  found long reaches of permanent water, divided here and there by only a  few yards of rocks, and bordered by reeds and rushes. The water hole, by  which we camped, is from forty to fifty feet wide, and half a mile in  length; the water is excellent, and I could see small fish in it about  two inches long. About ten miles down the creek the country seems to be  more open, and the gum-trees much larger, and in a distant bend of the  creek I can perceive a large body of water. The first of the seven or  eight tent-like hills that were to the east of our route to-day presents  a somewhat remarkable appearance. Of a conical form, it comes to a point  like a Chinaman's hat, and is encircled near the top by a black ring,  while some rocks resembling a white tower"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8914"],[0,"England, My England (#5)"],[1," 'Ah, there now! That's the style! That's what I like to hear from a  little lady in bed because she's cut her knee. That's the style--'    The comfortable and prolix doctor dressed and bandaged the knee and  recommended bed and a light diet for the little lady. He thought  a week or a fortnight would put it right. No bones or ligatures  damaged--fortunately. Only a flesh cut. He would come again in a day or  two.    So Joyce was reassured and stayed in bed and had all her toys up. Her  father often played with her. The doctor came the third day. He was  fairly pleased with the knee. It was healing. It was healing--yes--yes.  Let the child continue in bed. He came again after a day or two. Winifred  was a trifle uneasy. The wound seemed to be healing on the top, but it  hurt the child too much. It didn't look quite right. She said so to  Egbert.    'Egbert, I'm sure Joyce's knee isn't healing properly.'    'I think it is,' he said. 'I think it's all right.'    'I'd rather Doctor Wing came again--I don't feel satisfied.'    'Aren't you trying to imagine it worse than it really is?'    'You would say so, of course. But I shall write a post-card to Doctor  Wing now.'    The doctor came next day. He examined the knee. Yes, there was  inflammation. Yes, there _might_ be a little septic poisoning--there  might. There might. Was the child feverish?    So a fortnight passed by, and the child _was_ feverish, and the knee was  more inflamed and grew worse and was painful, painful. She cried in the  night, and her mother had to sit up with her. Egbert still insisted it  was nothing, really--it would pass. But in his heart he was anxious.    Winifred wrote again to her father. On Saturday the elderly man appeared.  And no sooner did Winifred see the thick, rather short figure in its grey  suit than a great yearning came over her.    'Father, I'm not satisfied with Joyce. I'm not satisfied with Doctor  Wing.'    'Well, Winnie, dear, if you're not satisfied we must have further advice,  that is all.'    The sturdy, powerful, elderly man went upstairs, his voice sounding  rather grating through the house, as if it cut upon the tense atmosphere.    'How are you, Joyce, darling?' he said to the child. 'Does your knee hurt  you? Does it hurt you, dear?'    'It does sometimes.' The child was shy of him, cold towards him.    'Well, dear, I'm sorry for that. I hope you try to bear it, and not  trouble mother too much.'    There was no answer. He looked at the knee. It was red and stiff.    'Of course,' he said, 'I think we must have another doctor's opinion. And  if we're going to have it, we had better have it at once. Egbert, do you  think you might cycle in to Bingham for Doctor Wayne? I found him very  satisfactory for Winnie's mother.'    'I can go if you think it necessary,' said Egbert.    'Certainly I think it necessary. Even if there if nothing, we can have  peace of mind. Certainly I think it necessary. I should like Doctor Wayne  to come this evening if possible.'    So Egbert set off on his bicycle through the wind, like a boy sent on an  errand, leaving his father-in-law a pillar of assurance, with Winifred.    Doctor Wayne came, and looked grave. Yes, the knee was certainly taking  the wrong way. The child might be lame for life.    Up went the fire and fear and anger in every heart. Doctor Wayne came  again the next day for a proper examination. And, yes, the knee had  really taken bad ways. It should be X-rayed. It was very important.    Godfrey Marshall walked up and down the lane with the doctor, beside the  standing motor-car: up and down, up and down in one of those  consultations of which he had had so many in his life.    As a result he came indoors to Winifred.    'Well, Winnie, dear, the best thing to do is to take Joyce up to London,  to a nursing home where she can have proper treatment. Of course this  knee has been allowed to go wrong. And apparently there is a risk that  the child may even lose her leg. What do you think, dear? You agree to  our taking her up to town and putting her under the best care?'    'Oh, father, you _know_ I would do anything on earth for her.'    'I know you would, Winnie darling. The pity is that there has been this  unfortunate delay already. I can't think what Doctor Wing was doing.  Apparently the child is in danger of losing her leg. Well then, if you  will have everything ready, we will take her up to town tomorrow. I will  order the large car from Denley's to be here at ten. Egbert, will you  take a telegram at once to Doctor Jackson? It is a small nursing home for  children and for surgical cases, not far from Baker Street. I'm sure  Joyce will be all right there.'    'Oh, father, can't I nurse her myself!'    'Well, darling, if she is to have proper treatment, she had best be in a  home. The X-ray treatment, and the electric treatment, and whatever is  necessary.'    'It will cost a great deal--' said Winifred.    'We can't think of cost, if the child's leg is in danger--or even her  life. No use speaking of cost,' said the elder man impatiently.    And so it was. Poor Joyce, stretched out on a bed in the big closed  motor-car--the mother sitting by her head, the grandfather in his short  grey beard and a bowler hat, sitting by her feet, thick, and implacable  in his responsibility--they rolled slowly away from Crockham, and from  Egbert who stood there bareheaded and a little ignominious, left behind.  He was to shut up the house and bring the rest of the family back to  town, by train, the next day.    Followed a dark and bitter time. The poor child. The poor, poor child,  how she suffered, an agony and a long crucifixion in that nursing home.  It was a bitter six weeks which changed the soul of Winifred for ever. As  she sat by the bed of her poor, tortured little child, tortured with the  agony of the knee, and the still worse agony of these diabolic, but  perhaps necessary modern treatments, she felt her heart killed and going  cold in her breast. Her little Joyce, her frail, brave, wonderful, little  Joyce, frail and small and pale as a white flower! Ah, how had she,  Winifred, dared to be so wicked, so wicked, so careless, so sensual.    'Let my heart die! Let my woman's heart of flesh die! Saviour, let my  heart die. And save my child. Let my heart die from the world and from  the flesh. Oh, destroy my heart that is so wayward. Let my heart of pride  die. Let my heart die.'    So she prayed beside the bed of her child. And like the Mother with the  seven swords in her breast, slowly her heart of pride and passion died in  her breast, bleeding away. Slowly it died, bleeding away, and she turned  to the Church for comfort, to Jesus, to the Mother of God, but most of  all, to that great and enduring institution, the Roman Catholic Church.  She withdrew into the shadow of the Church. She was a mother with three  children. But in her soul she died, her heart of pride and passion and  desire bled to death, her soul belonged to her church, her body belonged  to her duty as a mother.    Her duty as a wife did not enter. As a wife she had no sense of duty:  only a certain bitterness towards the man with whom she had known such  sensuality and distraction. She was purely the _Mater Dolorata_. To the  man she was closed as a tomb.    Egbert came to see his child. But Winifred seemed to be always seated  there, like the tomb of his manhood and his fatherhood. Poor Winifred:  she was still young, still strong and ruddy and beautiful like a ruddy  hard flower of the field. Strange--her ruddy, healthy face, so sombre,  and her strong, heavy, full-blooded body, so still. She, a nun! Never.  And yet the gates of her heart and soul had shut in his face with a slow,  resonant clang, shutting him out for ever. There was no need for her to  go into a convent. Her will had done it.    And between this young mother and this young father lay the crippled  child, like a bit of pale silk floss on the pillow, and a little white  pain-quenched face. He could not bear it. He just could not bear it. He  turned aside. There was nothing to do but to turn aside. He turned aside,  and went hither and thither, desultory. He was still attractive and  desirable. But there was a little frown between his brow as if he had  been cleft there with a hatchet: cleft right in, for ever, and that was  the stigma.    The child's leg was saved: but the knee was locked stiff. The fear now  was lest the lower leg should wither, or cease to grow. There must be  long-continued massage and treatment, daily treatment, even when the  child left the nursing home. And the whole of the expense was borne by  the grandfather.    Egbert now had no real home. Winifred with the children and nurse was  tied to the little flat in London. He could not live there: he could not  contain himself. The cottage was shut-up--or lent to friends. He went  down sometimes to work in his garden and keep the place in order. Then  with the empty house around him at night, all the empty rooms, he felt  his heart go wicked. The sense of frustration and futility, like some  slow, torpid snake, slowly bit right through his heart. Futility,  futility: the horrible marsh-poison went through his veins and killed  him.    As he worked in the garden in the silence of day he would listen for a  sound. No sound. No sound of Winifred from the dark inside of the  cottage: no sound of children's voices from the air, from the common,  from the near distance. No sound, nothing but the old dark marsh-venomous  atmosphere of the place. So he worked spasmodically through the day, and  at night made a fire and cooked some food alone.    He was alone. He himself cleaned the cottage and made his bed. But his  mending he did not do. His shirts were slit on the shoulders, when he had  been working, and the white flesh showed through. He would feel the air  and the spots of rain on his exposed flesh. And he would look again  across the common, where the dark,"]]]
