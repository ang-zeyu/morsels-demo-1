This is illustrated by the following examples:    _eating--table_  _mountain--floor_    _Mountain--floor_ is an individual reaction; _table--floor_    is found in the frequency tables; _floor_ is, therefore, classed  as an association to preceding reaction.    _beautiful--flowers_  _window--red_    _Window--red_ is an individual reaction; _red--flowers_ is  found in the frequency tables; therefore, _red_ is classed as an  association to preceding reaction.    In cases in which neither the reaction in question nor the preceding  reaction happens to be one of our stimulus words, but a relationship  between them may be judged to exist without considerable doubt, the  reaction in question is also classed here. Example:    _priest--father_  _ocean--mother_    _Ocean--mother_ is an individual reaction; neither the word  _father_ nor the word _mother_ is among our stimulus words;  but the association between the words _father_ and _mother_  may be judged to exist without considerable doubt; therefore, in this  case _mother_ is classed as an association to preceding reaction.    In such cases as this personal equation must necessarily come into  play; comparative uniformity of judgment may, however, be attained by  systematically excluding any reaction the relationship of which to the  preceding reaction is subject to any considerable doubt and by placing  any such reaction in the unclassified group.    *Repetition of Previous Stimulus.*--Here we place any reaction  which is a repetition of any previous stimulus from amongst the ten  next preceding, at the same time placing *repetition of preceding  stimulus* under a separate heading.    *Neologisms.*--Here we place the newly coined words, so commonly  given by the insane, excepting such as possess a sound relationship to  the stimulus word, for which, as already stated, a special place in  the classification has been provided.    Neologisms might be divided into three types, as follows: (1) those  which arise from ignorance of language (_comfort--uncomfort,  short--diminiature_); (2) distortions of actual words, apparently  of pathological origin and not due to ignorance (_hungry--foodation,  thief--dissteal_); and (3) those which seem to be without any  meaning whatever (_scack, gehimper, hanrow, dicut_). It is,  however, impossible to draw clear-cut distinctions between these  types, and for this reason we have made no provision in our  classification for such division.    *Unclassified Reactions.*--This group is important, in the first  place, because it is numerically a large one, and in the second place,  because it contains certain fairly definite types of reactions which  are placed here for the sole reason that we have not been able to find  strictly objective criteria for their differentiation from other  types.    It has already been stated that the frequency tables, even together  with the appendix, fail to exhaust all normal possibilities of  association, so that a certain small number of perfectly normal  reactions must fall into the unclassified group. We submit the  following examples:    _music--listen_  _smooth--suave_  _sour--curdled_  _earth--mound_    Another type of reactions found in the unclassified group, though also  normal, yet not obviously so until explained by the subject, is  represented by those which originate from purely personal experiences,  such as the following, given by normal subjects:    _blossom--T....._  _hammer--J....._    The first of these reactions is explained by the subject's acquaintance  with a young lady, Miss T...., who has been nick-named \"Blossom,\" and  the second is explained by the subject's having among her pupils at  school a boy by the name of J.... Hammer.    It would be difficult to estimate the proportion of such reactions in  the unclassified group, but we have gained the general impression that  it is small. An attempt to place them in a separate group could be  made only with the aid of explanations from the subjects; such aid in  the case of insane subjects is generally unreliable. Moreover, to  class these reactions as strictly normal would perhaps be going too  far, since their general value is obviously inferior to that of the  common reactions; and in any case in which they are given in unusually  large numbers they must be regarded as manifestation of a tendency to  depart from the normal to the extent to which they displace common  reactions. The next type of reactions met with in the unclassified  group is characterized by a peculiarly superficial, or non-essential,  or purely _circumstantial_ relationship to the stimulus. Such  reactions, though occasionally given by normal subjects, are more  often given by insane ones, and seem to be somewhat characteristic of  states of mental deterioration which are clinically rather loosely  described as puerilism. We offer the following examples, given by  normal subjects:    _music--town_  _sickness--summer_  _child--unknown_  _house--enter_    Still another type of reactions to be considered in this connection  consists of words which are in no way related to the corresponding  stimulus words, but which arise from _distraction_ of the subject  by surrounding objects, sounds, and the like. In some cases the  experimenter may be able to judge from the direction of the subject's  gaze, from a listening attitude, and so on, that certain reactions are  due to distraction. In other cases, particularly in cases of normal  subjects, the fact that certain reactions are due to distraction may  be determined by questioning the subject on this point immediately  after making the test; In work with insane subjects, as we have  several times had occasion to point out, such aid is generally not  available.    The group of unclassified reactions includes also one more type of  reactions which are of great importance both numerically and  otherwise. These are the *incoherent reactions*, that is to say,  reactions which are determined neither by the stimulus words, nor by  the agency of perseveration, nor by distraction.    Although the occurrence of incoherent reactions is hardly subject to  doubt, yet in no instance is it possible to establish with certainty  that a given reaction is of this type, for in no instance can a  remote, or an imagined, or a merely symbolic relationship between  stimulus and reaction be positively excluded. Some, indeed, would  assert that some such relationship must necessarily exist in every  instance, at least in the domain of the subconscious. This  circumstance necessitates the placing of this type of reactions in the  unclassified group.    In practice it may be found advisable in some cases to analyze the  unclassified reactions with a view to ascertaining to what extent each  of the various types is represented among them. But one here treads on  slippery ground, and one must be continually warned against the danger  of erroneous conclusions.        ยง 5. ORDER OF PREFERENCE.      After having developed the classification here proposed we found that  there was still considerable room for difference of opinion in the  placing of many reactions, owing to the circumstance that in many  cases a reaction presents features which render it assignable under  any one of two or more headings. To leave the matter of preference in  grouping: to be decided in each case according to the best judgment of  the experimenter would mean introducing again the play of personal  equation, and would thus court failure of all our efforts to  accomplish a standardization of the association test. Therefore, the  necessity of establishing a proper order of preference for guidance in  the application of the classification became to us quite apparent.    In the arrangement of the order of preference we were guided mainly by  two principles, namely: (i) as between two groups of unequal  definition, the one which is more clearly defined and which,  therefore, leaves less play for personal equation is to be preferred;  (2) as between two groups of equal definition, the one which possesses  the greater pathological significance is to be preferred. In  accordance with these principles we have adopted the order of  preference shown in Table III., placing every reaction under the  highest heading on the list under which it may be properly classed.

ERRORS INVOLVED IN THE USE OF ARBITRARY OBJECTIVE STANDARDS.      It may readily be seen that such definiteness and uniformity as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9173"],[0,"Youth: Its Education, Regimen, and Hygiene (#5)"],[1,"the less it suffers from localization, and  the lower is the level to which any one function can exhaust the  whole. The tendency of each group of cells to discharge or overflow  into those of lower tension than themselves increases as  correspondence in time and space widens. The more one of a number of  activities gains in power to draw on all the brain, or the more  readily the active parts are fed at cost of the resting parts, the  less is rest to be found in change from one of these activities to  another, and the less do concentration and specialization prove to be  dangerous. Before, the aim was to wake all parts to function; now it  is to connect them. Intensity of this cross-section activity now tends  to unity, so that all parts of the brain energize together. In a brain  with this switchboard function well organized, each reaction has grown  independent of its own stimulus and may result from any stimulation,  and each act, e.g., a finger movement of a peculiar nature, may tire  the whole brain. This helps us to understand why brain-workers so  often excel laborers not only in sudden dynamometric strength test,  but in sustained and long-enduring effort. In a good brain or in a  good machine, power may thus be developed over a large surface, and  all of it applied to a small one, and hence the dangers of  specialization are lessened in exact proportion as the elements of our  ego are thus compacted together. It is in the variety and delicacy of  these combinations and all that they imply, far more than in the  elements of which they are composed, that man rises farthest above the  higher animals; and of these powers later adolescence is the golden  age. The aimless and archaic movements of infancy, whether massive and  complex or in the form of isolated automatic tweaks or twinges, are  thus, by slow processes of combined analysis and synthesis, involving  changes as radical as any in all the world of growth, made over into  habits and conduct that fit the world of present environment.    But, thirdly, this long process carried out with all degrees of  completeness may be arrested at any unfinished stage. Some automatisms  refuse to be controlled by the will, and both they and it are often  overworked. Here we must distinguish constantly between (1) those  growing rankly in order to be later organized under the will, and (2)  those that have become feral after this domestication of them has lost  power from disease or fatigue, and (3) those that have never been  subjugated because the central power that should have used them to  weave the texture of willed action--the proper language of complete  manhood--was itself arrested or degenerate. With regard to many of  these movements these distinctions can be made with confidence, and in  some children more certainly than in others. In childhood, before  twelve, the efferent patterns should be developed into many more or  less indelible habits, and their colors set fast. Motor specialties  requiring exactness and grace like piano-playing, drawing, writing,  pronunciation of a foreign tongue, dancing, acting, singing, and a  host of virtuosities, must be well begun before the relative arrest of  accessory growth at the dawn of the ephebic regeneration and before  its great afflux of strength. The facts seem to show that children of  this age, such as Hancock[10] described, who could not stand with feet  close together and eyes closed without swaying much, could not walk  backward, sit still half a minute, dress alone, tie two ends of a  string together, interlace slats, wind thread, spin a top, stand on  toes or heels, hop on each foot, drive a nail, roll a hoop, skate, hit  fingers together rapidly in succession beginning at the little finger  and then reversing, etc., are the very ones in whom automatisms are  most marked or else they are those constitutionally inert, dull, or  uneducable.    In children these motor residua may persist as characteristic features  of inflection, accent, or manners; automatisms may become morbid in  stammering or stuttering, or they may be seen in gait, handwriting,  tics or tweaks, etc. Instead of disappearing with age, as they should,  they are seen in the blind as facial grimaces uncorrected by the  mirror or facial consciousness, in the deaf as inarticulate noises;  and they may tend to grow monstrous with age as if they were  disintegrated fragments of our personality, split off and aborted, or  motor parasites leaving our psycho-physic ego poorer in energy and  plasticity of adaptation, till the distraction and anarchy of the  individual nature becomes conspicuous and pathetic.    At puberty, however, when muscle habits are so plastic, when there is  a new relation between quantity or volume of motor energy and  qualitative differentiation, and between volitional control and reflex  activities, these kinetic remnants strongly tend to shoot together  into wrong aggregates if right ones are not formed. Good manners and  correct motor form generally, as well as skill, are the most economic  ways of doing things; but this is the age of wasteful ways,  awkwardness mannerisms, tensions that are a constant leakage of vital  energy, perhaps semi-imperative acts, contortions, quaint movements,  more elaborated than in childhood and often highly anesthetic and  disagreeable, motor coordinations that will need laborious  decomposition later. The avoidable factor in their causation is, with  some modification, not unlike that of the simpler feral movements and  faulty attitudes, carriage, and postures in children; viz., some form  of overpressure or misfit between environment and nature. As during  the years from four to eight there is great danger that overemphasis  of the activities of the accessory muscles will sow the seeds of  chorea, or aggravate predispositions to it, now again comes a greatly  increased danger, hardly existing from eight to twelve, that  overprecision, especially if fundamental activities are neglected,  will bring nervous strain and stunting precocity. This is again the  age of the basal, e.g., hill-climbing muscle, of leg and back and  shoulder work, and of the yet more fundamental heart, lung, and chest  muscles. Now again, the study of a book, under the usual conditions of  sitting in a closed space and using pen, tongue, and eye combined, has  a tendency to overstimulate the accessory muscles. This is especially  harmful for city children who are too prone to the distraction of  overmobility at an age especially exposed to maladjustment of motor  income and expenditure; and it constitutes not a liberal or  power-generating, but a highly and prematurely specialized, narrowing,  and weakening education unless offset by safeguards better than any  system of gymnastics, which is at best artificial and exaggerated.    As Bryan well says, \"The efficiency of a machine depends so far as we  know upon the maximum force, rate, amplitude, and variety of direction  of its movements and upon the exactness with which below these maxima  the force, rate, amplitude, and direction of the movements can be  controlled.\" The motor efficiency of a man depends upon his ability in  all these respects. Moreover, the education of the small muscles and  fine adjustments of larger ones is as near mental training as physical  culture can get; for these are the thought-muscles and movements, and  their perfected function is to reflect and express by slight  modifications of tension and tone every psychic change. Only the brain  itself is more closely and immediately an organ of thought than are  these muscles and their activity, reflex, spontaneous, or imitative in  origin. Whether any of them are of value, as Lindley thinks, in  arousing the brain to activity, or as Mueller suggests, in drawing off  sensations or venting efferent impulses that would otherwise distract,  we need not here discuss. If so, this is, of course, a secondary and  late function--nature's way of making the best of things and utilizing  remnants.    With these facts and their implications in mind we can next pass to  consider the conditions under which the adolescent muscles best  develop. Here we confront one of the greatest and most difficult  problems of our age. Changes in modern motor life have been so vast  and sudden as to present some of the most comprehensive and  all-conditioning dangers that threaten civilized races. Not only have  the forms of labor been radically changed within a generation or two,  but the basal activities that shaped the body of primitive man have  been suddenly swept away by the new methods of modern industry. Even  popular sports, games, and recreations, so abundant in the early life  of all progressive peoples, have been reduced and transformed; and the  play age, that once extended on to middle life and often old age, has  been restricted. Sedentary life in schools and offices, as we have  seen, is reducing the vigor and size of our lower limbs. Our industry  is no longer under hygienic conditions; and instead of being out of  doors, in the country, or of highly diversified kinds, it is now  specialized, monotonous, carried on in closed spaces, bad air, and  perhaps poor light, especially in cities. The diseases and arrest bred  in the young by life in shops, offices, factories, and schools  increase. Work is rigidly bound to fixed hours, uniform standards,  stints and piece-products; and instead of a finished article, each  individual now achieves a part of a single process and knows little of  those that precede or follow. Machinery has relieved the large basal  muscles and laid more stress upon fine and exact movements that  involve nerve strain. The coarser forms of work that involve hard  lifting, carrying, digging, etc., are themselves specialized, and  skilled labor requires more and more brain-work. It has been estimated  that \"the diminution of manual labor required to do a given quantity  of work in"]]]
