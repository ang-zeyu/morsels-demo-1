He seemed to see Christine,  Ringed by the pine-trees on that distant hill,  A small white figure, lost in space and time,  Yet gazing at the sky, and conquering all,  Height, depth, and heaven itself, by the sheer power  Of love at one with everlasting laws,  A love that shared the constancy of heaven,  And spoke to him across, above, the world.          III      Not till he crossed the Danube did he find  Among the fountains and the storied eaves  Of Augsburg, one to share his task with him.  Paul Hainzel, of that city, greatly loved  To talk with Tycho of the strange new dreams  Copernicus had kindled. Did this earth  Move? Was the sun the centre of our scheme?  And Tycho told him, there is but one way  To know the truth, and that's to sweep aside  All the dark cobwebs of old sophistry,  And watch and learn that moving alphabet,  Each smallest silver character inscribed  Upon the skies themselves, noting them down,  Till on a day we find them taking shape  In phrases, with a meaning; and, at last,  The hard-won beauty of that celestial book  With all its epic harmonies unfold  Like some great poet's universal song.    He was a great magician, Tycho Brahe.  \"Hainzel,\" he said, \"we have no magic wand,  But what the truth can give us. If we find  Even with a compass, through a bedroom window,  That half the glittering Almagest is wrong,  Think you, what noble conquests might be ours,  Had we but nobler instruments.\"                                  He showed  Quivering with eagerness, his first rude plan  For that great quadrant,--not the wooden toy  Of old Scultetus, but a kingly weapon,  Huge as a Roman battering-ram, and fine  In its divisions as any goldsmith's work.  \"It could be built,\" said Tycho, \"but the cost  Would buy a dozen culverin for your wars.\"  Then Hainzel, fired by Tycho's burning brain,  Answered, \"We'll make it. We've a war to wage  On Chaos, and his kingdoms of the night.\"  They chose the cunningest artists of the town,  Clock-makers, jewellers, carpenters, and smiths,  And, setting them all afire with Tycho's dream,  Within a month his dream was oak and brass.  Its beams were fourteen cubits, solid oak,  Banded with iron. Its arch was polished brass  Whereon five thousand exquisite divisions  Were marked to show the minutes of degrees.    So huge and heavy it was, a score of men,  Could hardly drag and fix it to its place  In Hainzel's garden.                       Many a shining night,  Tycho and Hainzel, out of that maze of flowers,  Charted the stars, discovering point by point,  How all the records erred, until the fame  Of this new master, hovering above the schools  Like a strange hawk, threatened the creeping dreams  Of all the Aristotelians, and began  To set their mouse-holes twittering \"Tycho Brahe!\"    Then Tycho Brahe came home, to find Christine.  Up to that whispering glade of ferns he sped,  At the first wink of Hesperus.                                  He stood  In shadow, under the darkest pine, to hide  The little golden mask upon his face.  He wondered, will she shrink from me in fear  Or loathing? Will she even come at all?  And, as he wondered, like a light she moved  Before him.              \"Is it you?\"--                             \"Christine! Christine,\"  He whispered, \"It is I, the mountebank,  Playing a jest upon you. It's only a mask!  Do not be frightened. I am here behind it.\"    Her red lips parted, and between them shone,  The little teeth like white pomegranate seeds.  He saw her frightened eyes.                              Then, with a cry,  Her arms went round him, and her eyelids closed.  Lying against his heart, she set her lips  Against his lips, and claimed him for her own.          IV      One frosty night, as Tycho bent his way  Home to the dark old abbey, he upraised  His eyes, and saw a portent in the sky.  There, in its most familiar patch of blue,  Where Cassiopeia's five-fold glory burned,  An unknown brilliance quivered, a huge star  Unseen before, a strange new visitant  To heavens unchangeable, as the world believed,  Since the creation.                      Could new stars be born?  Night after night he watched that miracle  Growing and changing colour as it grew;  White at the first, and large as Jupiter;  And, in the third month, yellow, and larger yet;  Red in the fifth month, like Aldebaran,  And larger even than Lyra. In the seventh,  Bluish like Saturn; whence it dulled and dwined  Little by little, till after eight months more  Into the dark abysmal blue of night,  Whence it arose, the wonder died away.  But, while it blazed above him, Tycho brought  Those delicate records of two hundred nights  To Copenhagen. There, in his golden mask,  At supper with Pratensis, who believed  Only what old books told him, Tycho met  Dancey, the French Ambassador, rainbow-gay  In satin hose and doublet, supple and thin,  Brown-eyed, and bearded with a soft black tuft  Neat as a blackbird's wing,--a spirit as keen  And swift as France on all the starry trails  Of thought.              He saw the deep and simple fire,  The mystery of all genius in those eyes  Above that golden wizard.                            Tycho raised  His wine-cup, brimming--they thought--with purple dreams;  And bade them drink to their triumphant Queen  Of all the Muses, to their Lady of Light  Urania, and the great new star.                                  They laughed,  Thinking the young astrologer's golden mask  Hid a sardonic jest.                       \"The skies are clear,\"  Said Tycho Brahe, \"and we have eyes to see.  Put out your candles. Open those windows there!\"  The colder darkness breathed upon their brows,  And Tycho pointed, into the deep blue night.  There, in their most immutable height of heaven,  In _ipso caelo_, in the ethereal realm,  Beyond all planets, red as Mars it burned,  The one impossible glory.                            \"But it's true!\"  Pratensis gasped; then, clutching the first straw,  \"Now I recall how Pliny the Elder said,  Hipparchus also saw a strange new star,  Not where the comets, not where the _Rosae_ bloom  And fade, but in that solid crystal sphere  Where nothing changes.\"                          Tycho smiled, and showed  The record of his watchings.                               \"But the world  Must know all this,\" cried Dancey. \"You must print it.\"  \"Print it?\" said Tycho, turning that golden mask  On both his friends. \"Could I, a noble, print  This trafficking with Urania in a book?  They'd hound me out of Denmark! This disgrace  Of work, with hands or brain, no matter why,  No matter how, in one who ought to dwell  Fixed to the solid upper sphere, my friends,  Would never be forgiven.\"                            Dancey stared  In mute amazement, but that mask of gold  Outstared him, sphinx-like, and inscrutable.    Soon through all Europe, like the blinded moths,  Roused by a lantern in old palaces  Among the mouldering tapestries of thought,  Weird fables woke and fluttered to and fro,  And wild-eyed sages hunted them for truth.  The Italian, Frangipani, thought the star  The lost Electra, that had left her throne  Among the Pleiads, and plunged into the night  Like a veiled mourner, when Troy town was burned.  The German painter, Busch, of Erfurt, wrote,  \"It was a comet, made of mortal sins;  A poisonous mist, touched by the wrath of God  To fire; from which there would descend on earth  All manner of evil--plagues and sudden death,  Frenchmen and famine.\"                         Preachers thumped and raved.  Theodore Beza in Calvin's pulpit tore  His grim black gown, and vowed it was the Star  That led the Magi. It had now returned  To mark the world's end and the Judgment Day.  Then, in this hubbub, Dancey told the king  Of Denmark, \"There is one who knows the truth--  Your subject Tycho Brahe, who, night by night,  Watched and recorded all that truth could see.  It would bring honour to all Denmark, sire,  If Tycho could forget his rank awhile,  And print these great discoveries in a book,  For all the world to read.\"                              So Tycho Brahe  Received a letter in the king's own hand,  Urging him, \"Truth is the one pure fountain-head  Of all nobility. Pray forget your rank.\"  His noble kinsmen echoed, \"If you wish  To please His Majesty and ourselves, forget  Your rank.\"              \"I will,\" said Tycho Brahe;  \"Your reasoning has convinced me. I will print  My book, '_De Nova Stella._' And to prove  All you have said concerning temporal rank  And this eternal truth you love so well,  I marry, to-day,\"--they foamed, but all their mouths  Were stopped and stuffed and sealed with their own words,--  \"I marry to-day my own true love, Christine.\"          V      They thought him a magician, Tycho Brahe.  Perhaps he was. There's magic all around us  In rocks and trees, and in the minds of men,  Deep hidden springs of magic.                                He that strikes  The rock aright, may find them where he will.    And Tycho tasted happiness in his hour.  There was a prince in Denmark in those days;  And, when he heard how other kings desired  The secrets of this new astrology,  He said, \"This man, in after years, will bring  Glory to Denmark, honour to her prince.  He is a Dane. Give him this isle of Wheen,  And let him make his great discoveries there.  Let him have gold to buy his instruments,  And build his house and his observatory.\"    So Tycho set this island where he lived  Whispering with wizardry; and, in its heart,  He lighted that strange lanthorn of the law,  And built himself that wonder of the world,  Uraniborg, a fortress for the truth,  A city of the heavens.                         Around it ran  A mighty rampart twenty-two feet high,  And twenty feet in thickness at the base.  Its angles pointed north, south, east and west,  With gates and turrets; and, within this wall,  Were fruitful"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6585"],[0,"The Works of Lucian of Samosata — Volume 02 (#5)"],[1,"pression,  my smiles arouse his contempt and disgust. As well attempt to act a comic  part in the mask of tragedy! And what is the end of it all? My present  life has been another's: do I look to have a new life which shall be my  own?'    Your soliloquy is interrupted by the bell. The old routine awaits you:  you must trudge, and you must stand; and first anoint your limbs, if you  would hold out to the end. Dinner will be the same as ever, and go on as  late as ever. The change from all your former habits, the wakeful night,  the violent exercise, the exhaustion, are slowly undermining your health  at this moment, and preparing you for consumption or colic, for asthma or  the delights of gout. However, you hold out in spite of all, though many  a time your right place would be in bed. But that would never do: that  looks like shamming, like shirking your work. The result is that you grow  as pallid as a man at the point of death.    So much for your city life. And now for an excursion into the country.  I will content myself with a single detail. As likely as not it is a wet  day. Your turn for the carriage (as might be expected) comes last. You  wait and wait, till at last its return is out of the question, and you  are squeezed into some vehicle with the cook, or with my lady's _friseur_,  without even a proper allowance of straw. I shall make no scruple of  relating to you an experience of Thesmopolis the Stoic, which I had from  his own mouth; a most amusing incident, and just the sort of thing one  might expect to find happening again. He was in the service of a certain  wealthy and luxurious lady of quality, whom on one occasion he had to  accompany on a journey from Rome. The fun began at once. The philosopher  received as his travelling companion a beardless exquisite of the  pitch-plastering persuasion, by whom, you may be certain, my lady set  great store; his name, she informed the philosopher, was 'Robinetta.' Is  not this a promising start?--the grave and reverend Thesmopolis, with his  hoary beard (you know what a long, venerable affair it is), side by side  with this rouged and painted ogler, whose drooping neck and plucked  throat suggested the vulture rather than the robin! 'Twas all that  Thesmopolis could do to persuade him not to wear his hair-net; and as it  was he had a sad journey of it, with the fellow singing and whistling all  the time--I daresay he would have danced there and then, if Thesmopolis  had not prevented him. But there was more to come, as you will see.  'Thesmopolis,' cries my lady, calling him to her, 'I have a great favour  to ask of you; now please don't say no, and don't wait to be asked twice,  there's a good creature.' Of course, he said he would do anything she  wished. 'I only ask you, because I know you are to be trusted; you are so  good-natured and affectionate! I want you to take my little dog Myrrhina  in with you, and see that she wants for nothing. Poor little lady! she is  soon to become a mother. These hateful, inattentive servants take no  notice of _me_ when we are travelling, much less of her. You will be doing  me a great kindness, I assure you, in taking charge of her; I am so fond  of the sweet little pet!' She prayed and almost wept; and Thesmopolis  promised. Imagine the ludicrous picture. The little beast peeping out from  beneath the philosophic cloak; within licking distance of that beard,  which perhaps still held traces of the thick soup of yesterday; yapping  away with its shrill pipe of a voice, as Maltese terriers will; and no  doubt taking other liberties, which Thesmopolis did not think worth  mentioning. That night at dinner, the exquisite, his fellow traveller,  after cracking a passable joke here and there at the expense of the other  guests, came to Thesmopolis. 'Of him,' he remarked, 'I have only this to  say, that our Stoic has turned Cynic.' According to what I heard, the  little animal actually littered in his mantle!    Such are the caprices, nay, the insults, let me rather say, with which  the patron gradually breaks the spirit of his dependants. I know myself  of an orator, a very free speaker, who was actually ordered to stand up  and deliver a speech at table; and a masterly speech it was, trenchant  and terse. He received the congratulations of the company on being timed  by a _wine_--instead of a _water_-clock; and this affront, it is said, he  was content to put up, for the consideration of 8 pounds. But what of  that? Wait till you get a patron who has poetical or historical  tendencies, and spouts passages of his own works all through dinner: you  must praise, you must flatter, you must devise original compliments for  him,--or die in the attempt. Then there are the beaux, the Adonises and  Hyacinths, as you must be careful to call them, undeterred by the  eighteen inches or so of nose that some of them carry on their faces. Do  your praises halt? 'Tis envy, 'tis treason! Away with you, Philoxenus  that you are, to Syracusan quarries!--Let them be orators, let them be  philosophers, if they will: what matter for a solecism here and there?  Find Attic elegance, find honey of Hymettus in every word; and pronounce  it law henceforth, to speak as they speak.    If we had only men to deal with, it would be something: but there are the  women too. For among the objects of feminine ambition is this, of having  a scholar or two in their pay, to dance attendance at the litter's side;  it adds one more to the list of their adornments, if they can get the  reputation of culture and philosophy, of turning a song which will bear  comparison with Sappho's. So they too keep their philosopher, their  orator, or their _litterateur_; and give him audience--when, think  you? Why, at the toilet, by all that is ridiculous, among the rouge-pots  and hair-brushes; or else at the dinner-table. They have no leisure at  other times. As it is, the philosopher is often interrupted by the  entrance of a maid with a billet-doux. Virtue has then to bide her time;  for the audience will not be resumed till the gallant has his answer.    At rare intervals, at the Saturnalia or the Feast of Minerva, you will be  presented with a sorry cloak, or a worn-out tunic; and a world of  ceremony will go to the presentation. The first who gets wind of the  great man's intention flies to you with the news of what is in store  for you; and the bringer of glad tidings does not go away empty-handed. The  next morning a dozen of them arrive, conveying the present, each with his  tale of how he spoke up for you, or the hints he threw out, or how he was  entrusted with the choice, and chose the best. Not a man of them but  departs with your money in his pocket, grumbling that it is no more.    As to that salary, it will be paid to you sixpence at a time, and there  will be black looks when you ask for it. Still, you must get it somehow.  Ply your patron therefore with flatteries and entreaties, and pay due  observance to his steward, and let it be the kind of observance that  stewards like best; nor must you forget your kind introducer. You do get  something at last; but it all goes to pay the tailor, the doctor, or the  shoemaker, and you are left the proud possessor of nothing at all.    Meanwhile, jealousy is rife, and some slander is perhaps working its  stealthy way to ears which are predisposed to hear anything to your  discredit. For your employer perceives that by this time incessant  fatigues have worn you out; you are crippled, you are good for nothing  more, and gout is coming on. All the profit that was to be had of you, he  has effectually sucked out. Your prime has gone by, your bodily vigour is  exhausted, you are a tattered remnant. He begins to look about for a  convenient dunghill whereon to deposit you, and for an able-bodied  substitute to do your work. You have attempted the honour of one of his  minions: you have been trying to corrupt his wife's maid, venerable  sinner that you are!--any accusation will serve. You are gagged and  turned out neck and crop into the darkness. Away you go, helpless and  destitute, with gout for the cheering companion of your old age. Whatever  you once knew, you have unlearnt in all these years: on the other hand,  you have developed a paunch like a balloon; a monster insatiable,  inexorable, which has acquired a habit of asking for more, and likes not  at all the unlearning process. It is not to be supposed that any one else  will give you employment, at your age; you are like an old horse, whose  very hide has deteriorated in value. Not to mention that the worst  interpretation will be put upon your late dismissal; you will be credited  with adultery, or poisoning, or something of that kind. Your accuser, you  see, is convincing even in silence; whereas you--you are a loose-  principled, unscrupulous _Greek_. That is the character we Greeks  bear; and it serves us right; I see excellent grounds for the opinion  they have of us. Greek after Greek who enters their service sets up (in  default of any other practical knowledge) for wizard or poisoner, and  deals in love-charms and evil spells; and these are they who talk of  culture, who wear grey beards and philosophic cloaks! When these, who are  accounted the best of us, stand thus exposed, when men observe their  interested servility, their gross flatteries at table and elsewhere, it  is not to be wondered at that we have all fallen under suspicion. Those  whom they have cast off, they hate, and seek to make an end of them  altogether; arguing, naturally enough, that men who know their secrets,  and have seen them in all their nakedness, may divulge many a foible  which will not bear the light; and the thought is torment to them. The  fact is, that these great men are for all the world like handsomely bound  books.
