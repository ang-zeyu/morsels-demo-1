And they had brick for stone, and slime             had they for morter.    01:011:004 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower,             whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name,             lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.    01:011:005 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which             the children of men builded.    01:011:006 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have             all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing             will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.    01:011:007 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that             they may not understand one another's speech.    01:011:008 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of             all the earth: and they left off to build the city.    01:011:009 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did             there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence             did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the             earth.    01:011:010 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years             old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:    01:011:011 And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and             begat sons and daughters.    01:011:012 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:    01:011:013 And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three             years, and begat sons and daughters.    01:011:014 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:    01:011:015 And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three             years, and begat sons and daughters.    01:011:016 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:    01:011:017 And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty             years, and begat sons and daughters.    01:011:018 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:    01:011:019 And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years,             and begat sons and daughters.    01:011:020 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:    01:011:021 And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven             years, and begat sons and daughters.    01:011:022 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:    01:011:023 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and             begat sons and daughters.    01:011:024 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:    01:011:025 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen             years, and begat sons and daughters.    01:011:026 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and             Haran.    01:011:027 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,             Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.    01:011:028 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his             nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.    01:011:029 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife             was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter             of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.    01:011:030 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.    01:011:031 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his             son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's             wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees,             to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and             dwelt there.    01:011:032 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and             Terah died in Haran.    01:012:001 Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country,             and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land             that I will shew thee:    01:012:002 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee,             and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:    01:012:003 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that             curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be             blessed.    01:012:004 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot             went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when             he departed out of Haran.    01:012:005 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and             all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that             they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the             land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.    01:012:006 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem,             unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the             land.    01:012:007 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will             I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD,             who appeared unto him.    01:012:008 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of             Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and             Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD,             and called upon the name of the LORD.    01:012:009 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.    01:012:010 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into             Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the             land.    01:012:011 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into             Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know             that thou art a fair woman to look upon:    01:012:012 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see             thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will             kill me, but they will save thee alive.    01:012:013 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with             me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.    01:012:014 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the             Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.    01:012:015 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before             Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.    01:012:016 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep,             and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and             she asses, and camels.    01:012:017 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues             because of Sarai Abram's wife.    01:012:018 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast             done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy             wife?    01:012:019 Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her             to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go             thy way.    01:012:020 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent             him away, and his wife, and all that he had.    01:013:001 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that             he had, and Lot with him, into the south.    01:013:002 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.    01:013:003 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel,             unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning,             between Bethel and Hai;    01:013:004 Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the             first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.    01:013:005 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds,             and tents.    01:013:006 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell             together: for their substance was great, so that they could             not dwell together.    01:013:007 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle             and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the             Perizzite dwelled then in the land.    01:013:008 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee,             between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen;             for we be brethren.    01:013:009 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray             thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go             to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will             go to the left.    01:013:010 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of             Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD             destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD,             like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.    01:013:011 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed             east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.    01:013:012 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the             cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.    01:013:013 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD             exceedingly.    01:013:014 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated             from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place             where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and             westward:    01:013:015 For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and             to thy seed for ever.    01:013:016 And I will make thy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8003"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 3: Leviticus (#5)"],[1,"said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at             the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat             it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I             commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.    03:008:032 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall             ye burn with fire.    03:008:033 And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the             congregation in seven days, until the days of your             consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate             you.    03:008:034 As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to             make an atonement for you.    03:008:035 Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the             congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of             the LORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.    03:008:036 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded             by the hand of Moses.    03:009:001 And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron             and his sons, and the elders of Israel;    03:009:002 And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin             offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and             offer them before the LORD.    03:009:003 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take             ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a             lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt             offering;    03:009:004 Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice             before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to             day the LORD will appear unto you.    03:009:005 And they brought that which Moses commanded before the             tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew             near and stood before the LORD.    03:009:006 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded             that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto             you.    03:009:007 And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy             sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement             for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the             people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.    03:009:008 Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the             sin offering, which was for himself.    03:009:009 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he             dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of             the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the             altar:    03:009:010 But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of             the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD             commanded Moses.    03:009:011 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the             camp.    03:009:012 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented             unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the             altar.    03:009:013 And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the             pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the             altar.    03:009:014 And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon             the burnt offering on the altar.    03:009:015 And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which             was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered             it for sin, as the first.    03:009:016 And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to             the manner.    03:009:017 And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof,             and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the             morning.    03:009:018 He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace             offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons             presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the             altar round about,    03:009:019 And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that             which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul             above the liver:    03:009:020 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat             upon the altar:    03:009:021 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave             offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.    03:009:022 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed             them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the             burnt offering, and peace offerings.    03:009:023 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the             congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the             glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.    03:009:024 And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed             upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all             the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.    03:010:001 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them             his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and             offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them             not.    03:010:002 And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and             they died before the LORD.    03:010:003 Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake,             saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and             before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his             peace.    03:010:004 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the             uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your             brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.    03:010:005 So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the             camp; as Moses had said.    03:010:006 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,             his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes;             lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let             your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning             which the LORD hath kindled.    03:010:007 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the             congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD             is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.    03:010:008 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying,    03:010:009 Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with             thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest             ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your             generations:    03:010:010 And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and             between unclean and clean;    03:010:011 And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes             which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.    03:010:012 And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,             his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth             of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without             leaven beside the altar: for it is most holy:    03:010:013 And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due,             and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire:             for so I am commanded.    03:010:014 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean             place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for             they be thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the             sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.    03:010:015 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with             the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave             offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons'             with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.    03:010:016 And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and,             behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and             Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying,    03:010:017 Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy             place, seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to             bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for             them before the LORD?    03:010:018 Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy             place: ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I             commanded.    03:010:019 And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered             their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD;             and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin             offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of             the LORD?    03:010:020 And when Moses heard that, he was content.    03:011:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,    03:011:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the             beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the             earth.    03:011:003 Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth             the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.    03:011:004 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud,             or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he             cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto             you.    03:011:005 And the coney, because he cheweth the cud,"]]]
