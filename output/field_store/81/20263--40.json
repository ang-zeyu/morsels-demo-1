At  present, owing to the fact that all industrial changes tend to cause  hardships to some section of wage-earners, there is a tendency to  technical conservatism on the part of labor, a dislike of innovations,  new processes, and new methods.  But such changes, if they are in the  permanent interest of the community, ought to be carried out without  allowing them to bring unmerited loss to those sections of the  community whose labor is no longer wanted in the old form.  The  instinctive conservatism of mankind is sure to make all processes of  production change more slowly than they should.  It is a pity to add  to this by the avoidable conservatism which is forced upon organized  labor at present through the unjust workings of a change.    It will be said that men will not work well if the fear of dismissal  does not spur them on.  I think it is only a small percentage of whom  this would be true at present.  And those of whom it would be true  might easily become industrious if they were given more congenial work  or a wiser training.  The residue who cannot be coaxed into industry  by any such methods are probably to be regarded as pathological cases,  requiring medical rather than penal treatment.  And against this  residue must be set the very much larger number who are now ruined in  health or in morale by the terrible uncertainty of their livelihood  and the great irregularity of their employment.  To very many,  security would bring a quite new possibility of physical and moral  health.    The most dangerous aspect of the tyranny of the employer is the power  which it gives him of interfering with men's activities outside their  working hours.  A man may be dismissed because the employer dislikes  his religion or his politics, or chooses to think his private life  immoral.  He may be dismissed because he tries to produce a spirit of  independence among his fellow employees.  He may fail completely to  find employment merely on the ground that he is better educated than  most and therefore more dangerous.  Such cases actually occur at  present.  This evil would not be remedied, but rather intensified,  under state socialism, because, where the State is the only employer,  there is no refuge from its prejudices such as may now accidentally  arise through the differing opinions of different men.  The State  would be able to enforce any system of beliefs it happened to like,  and it is almost certain that it would do so.  Freedom of thought  would be penalized, and all independence of spirit would die out.    Any rigid system would involve this evil.  It is very necessary that  there should be diversity and lack of complete systematization.  Minorities must be able to live and develop their opinions freely.  If  this is not secured, the instinct of persecution and conformity will  force all men into one mold and make all vital progress impossible.    For these reasons, no one ought to be allowed to suffer destitution so  long as he or she is _willing_ to work.  And no kind of inquiry ought  to be made into opinion or private life.  It is only on this basis  that it is possible to build up an economic system not founded upon  tyranny and terror.      II    The power of the economic reformer is limited by the technical  productivity of labor.  So long as it was necessary to the bare  subsistence of the human race that most men should work very long  hours for a pittance, so long no civilization was possible except an  aristocratic one; if there were to be men with sufficient leisure for  any mental life, there had to be others who were sacrificed for the  good of the few.  But the time when such a system was necessary has  passed away with the progress of machinery.  It would be possible now,  if we had a wise economic system, for all who have mental needs to  find satisfaction for them.  By a few hours a day of manual work, a  man can produce as much as is necessary for his own subsistence; and  if he is willing to forgo luxuries, that is all that the community has  a right to demand of him.  It ought to be open to all who so desire to  do short hours of work for little pay, and devote their leisure to  whatever pursuit happens to attract them.  No doubt the great majority  of those who chose this course would spend their time in mere  amusement, as most of the rich do at present.  But it could not be  said, in such a society, that they were parasites upon the labor of  others.  And there would be a minority who would give their hours of  nominal idleness to science or art or literature, or some other  pursuit out of which fundamental progress may come.  In all such  matters, organization and system can only do harm.  The one thing that  can be done is to provide opportunity, without repining at the waste  that results from most men failing to make good use of the  opportunity.    But except in cases of unusual laziness or eccentric ambition, most  men would elect to do a full day's work for a full day's pay.  For  these, who would form the immense majority, the important thing is  that ordinary work should, as far as possible, afford interest and  independence and scope for initiative.  These things are more  important than income, as soon as a certain minimum has been reached.  They can be secured by gild socialism, by industrial self-government  subject to state control as regards the relations of a trade to the  rest of the community.  So far as I know, they cannot be secured in  any other way.    Guild socialism, as advocated by Mr. Orage and the \"New Age,\" is  associated with a polemic against \"political\" action, and in favor of  direct economic action by trade-unions.  It shares this with  syndicalism, from which most of what is new in it is derived.  But I  see no reason for this attitude; political and economic action seem to  me equally necessary, each in its own time and place.  I think there  is danger in the attempt to use the machinery of the present  capitalist state for socialistic purposes.  But there is need of  political action to transform the machinery of the state, side by side  with the transformation which we hope to see in economic institutions.  In this country, neither transformation is likely to be brought about  by a sudden revolution; we must expect each to come step by step, if  at all, and I doubt if either could or should advance very far without  the other.    The economic system we should ultimately wish to see would be one in  which the state would be the sole recipient of economic rent, while  private capitalistic enterprises should be replaced by self-governing  combinations of those who actually do the work.  It ought to be  optional whether a man does a whole day's work for a whole day's pay,  or half a day's work for half a day's pay, except in cases where such  an arrangement would cause practical inconvenience.  A man's pay  should not cease through the accident of his work being no longer  needed, but should continue so long as he is willing to work, a new  trade being taught him at the public expense, if necessary.  Unwillingness to work should be treated medically or educationally,  when it could not be overcome by a change to some more congenial  occupation.    The workers in a given industry should all be combined in one  autonomous unit, and their work should not be subject to any outside  control.  The state should fix the price at which they produce, but  should leave the industry self-governing in all other respects.  In  fixing prices, the state should, as far as possible, allow each  industry to profit by any improvements which it might introduce into  its own processes, but should endeavor to prevent undeserved loss or  gain through changes in external economic conditions.  In this way  there would be every incentive to progress, with the least possible  danger of unmerited destitution.  And although large economic  organizations will continue, as they are bound to do, there will be a  diffusion of power which will take away the sense of individual  impotence from which men and women suffer at present.      III    Some men, though they may admit that such a system would be desirable,  will argue that it is impossible to bring it about, and that therefore  we must concentrate on more immediate objects.    I think it must be conceded that a political party ought to have  proximate aims, measures which it hopes to carry in the next session  or the next parliament, as well as a more distant goal.  Marxian  socialism, as it existed in Germany, seemed to me to suffer in this  way: although the party was numerically powerful, it was politically  weak, because it had no minor measures to demand while waiting for the  revolution.  And when, at last, German socialism was captured by those  who desired a less impracticable policy, the modification which  occurred was of exactly the wrong kind: acquiescence in bad policies,  such as militarism and imperialism, rather than advocacy of partial  reforms which, however inadequate, would still have been steps in the  right direction.    A similar defect was inherent in the policy of French syndicalism as  it existed before the war.  Everything was to wait for the general  strike; after adequate preparation, one day the whole proletariat  would unanimously refuse to work, the property owners would  acknowledge their defeat, and agree to abandon all their privileges  rather than starve.  This is a dramatic conception; but love of drama  is a great enemy of true vision.  Men cannot be trained, except under  very rare circumstances, to do something suddenly which is very  different from what they have been doing before.  If the general  strike were to succeed, the victors, despite their anarchism, would be  compelled at once to form an administration, to create a new police"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/479"],[0,"Little Lord Fauntleroy (#5)"],[1,"little Lord Fauntleroy's fortunes made him notice Ceddie  more than he had noticed other children; but, however that was, he  certainly found himself noticing him a great deal.    Cedric did not know he was being observed, and he only behaved himself  in his ordinary manner. He shook hands with Mr. Havisham in his friendly  way when they were introduced to each other, and he answered all his  questions with the unhesitating readiness with which he answered Mr.  Hobbs. He was neither shy nor bold, and when Mr. Havisham was talking to  his mother, the lawyer noticed that he listened to the conversation with  as much interest as if he had been quite grown up.    \"He seems to be a very mature little fellow,\" Mr. Havisham said to the  mother.    \"I think he is, in some things,\" she answered. \"He has always been very  quick to learn, and he has lived a great deal with grownup people. He  has a funny little habit of using long words and expressions he has read  in books, or has heard others use, but he is very fond of childish  play. I think he is rather clever, but he is a very boyish little boy,  sometimes.\"    The next time Mr. Havisham met him, he saw that this last was quite  true. As his coupe turned the corner, he caught sight of a group of  small boys, who were evidently much excited. Two of them were about to  run a race, and one of them was his young lordship, and he was shouting  and making as much noise as the noisiest of his companions. He stood  side by side with another boy, one little red leg advanced a step.    \"One, to make ready!\" yelled the starter. \"Two, to be steady. Three--and  away!\"    Mr. Havisham found himself leaning out of the window of his coupe with  a curious feeling of interest. He really never remembered having seen  anything quite like the way in which his lordship's lordly little red  legs flew up behind his knickerbockers and tore over the ground as he  shot out in the race at the signal word. He shut his small hands and set  his face against the wind; his bright hair streamed out behind.    \"Hooray, Ced Errol!\" all the boys shouted, dancing and shrieking with  excitement. \"Hooray, Billy Williams! Hooray, Ceddie! Hooray, Billy!  Hooray! 'Ray! 'Ray!\"    \"I really believe he is going to win,\" said Mr. Havisham. The way in  which the red legs flew and flashed up and down, the shrieks of the  boys, the wild efforts of Billy Williams, whose brown legs were not to  be despised, as they followed closely in the rear of the red legs, made  him feel some excitement. \"I really--I really can't help hoping he will  win!\" he said, with an apologetic sort of cough. At that moment, the  wildest yell of all went up from the dancing, hopping boys. With  one last frantic leap the future Earl of Dorincourt had reached the  lamp-post at the end of the block and touched it, just two seconds  before Billy Williams flung himself at it, panting.    \"Three cheers for Ceddie Errol!\" yelled the little boys. \"Hooray for  Ceddie Errol!\"    Mr. Havisham drew his head in at the window of his coupe and leaned back  with a dry smile.    \"Bravo, Lord Fauntleroy!\" he said.    As his carriage stopped before the door of Mrs. Errol's house, the  victor and the vanquished were coming toward it, attended by the  clamoring crew. Cedric walked by Billy Williams and was speaking to him.  His elated little face was very red, his curls clung to his hot, moist  forehead, his hands were in his pockets.    \"You see,\" he was saying, evidently with the intention of making defeat  easy for his unsuccessful rival, \"I guess I won because my legs are a  little longer than yours. I guess that was it. You see, I'm three days  older than you, and that gives me a 'vantage. I'm three days older.\"    And this view of the case seemed to cheer Billy Williams so much that  he began to smile on the world again, and felt able to swagger a little,  almost as if he had won the race instead of losing it. Somehow, Ceddie  Errol had a way of making people feel comfortable. Even in the first  flush of his triumphs, he remembered that the person who was beaten  might not feel so gay as he did, and might like to think that he MIGHT  have been the winner under different circumstances.    That morning Mr. Havisham had quite a long conversation with the winner  of the race--a conversation which made him smile his dry smile, and rub  his chin with his bony hand several times.    Mrs. Errol had been called out of the parlor, and the lawyer and Cedric  were left together. At first Mr. Havisham wondered what he should say to  his small companion. He had an idea that perhaps it would be best to say  several things which might prepare Cedric for meeting his grandfather,  and, perhaps, for the great change that was to come to him. He could see  that Cedric had not the least idea of the sort of thing he was to see  when he reached England, or of the sort of home that waited for him  there. He did not even know yet that his mother was not to live in the  same house with him. They had thought it best to let him get over the  first shock before telling him.    Mr. Havisham sat in an arm-chair on one side of the open window; on the  other side was another still larger chair, and Cedric sat in that and  looked at Mr. Havisham. He sat well back in the depths of his big seat,  his curly head against the cushioned back, his legs crossed, and his  hands thrust deep into his pockets, in a quite Mr. Hobbs-like way. He  had been watching Mr. Havisham very steadily when his mamma had been in  the room, and after she was gone he still looked at him in respectful  thoughtfulness. There was a short silence after Mrs. Errol went out,  and Cedric seemed to be studying Mr. Havisham, and Mr. Havisham was  certainly studying Cedric. He could not make up his mind as to what an  elderly gentleman should say to a little boy who won races, and wore  short knickerbockers and red stockings on legs which were not long  enough to hang over a big chair when he sat well back in it.    But Cedric relieved him by suddenly beginning the conversation himself.    \"Do you know,\" he said, \"I don't know what an earl is?\"    \"Don't you?\" said Mr. Havisham.    \"No,\" replied Ceddie. \"And I think when a boy is going to be one, he  ought to know. Don't you?\"    \"Well--yes,\" answered Mr. Havisham.    \"Would you mind,\" said Ceddie respectfully--\"would you mind 'splaining  it to me?\" (Sometimes when he used his long words he did not pronounce  them quite correctly.) \"What made him an earl?\"    \"A king or queen, in the first place,\" said Mr. Havisham. \"Generally,  he is made an earl because he has done some service to his sovereign, or  some great deed.\"    \"Oh!\" said Cedric; \"that's like the President.\"    \"Is it?\" said Mr. Havisham. \"Is that why your presidents are elected?\"    \"Yes,\" answered Ceddie cheerfully. \"When a man is very good and knows a  great deal, he is elected president. They have torch-light processions  and bands, and everybody makes speeches. I used to think I might perhaps  be a president, but I never thought of being an earl. I didn't know  about earls,\" he said, rather hastily, lest Mr. Havisham might feel it  impolite in him not to have wished to be one,--\"if I'd known about them,  I dare say I should have thought I should like to be one.\"    \"It is rather different from being a president,\" said Mr. Havisham.    \"Is it?\" asked Cedric. \"How? Are there no torch-light processions?\"    Mr. Havisham crossed his own legs and put the tips of his fingers  carefully together. He thought perhaps the time had come to explain  matters rather more clearly.    \"An earl is--is a very important person,\" he began.    \"So is a president!\" put in Ceddie. \"The torch-light processions are  five miles long, and they shoot up rockets, and the band plays! Mr.  Hobbs took me to see them.\"    \"An earl,\" Mr. Havisham went on, feeling rather uncertain of his ground,  \"is frequently of very ancient lineage----\"    \"What's that?\" asked Ceddie.    \"Of very old family--extremely old.\"    \"Ah!\" said Cedric, thrusting his hands deeper into his pockets. \"I  suppose that is the way with the apple-woman near the park. I dare say  she is of ancient lin-lenage. She is so old it would surprise you how  she can stand up. She's a hundred, I should think, and yet she is out  there when it rains, even. I'm sorry for her, and so are the other boys.  Billy Williams once had nearly a dollar, and I asked him to buy five  cents' worth of apples from her every day until he had spent it all.  That made twenty days, and he grew tired of apples after a week; but  then--it was quite fortunate--a gentleman gave me fifty cents and I  bought apples from her instead. You feel sorry for any one that's so  poor and has such ancient lin-lenage. She says hers has gone into her  bones and the rain makes it worse.\"    Mr. Havisham felt rather at a loss as he looked at his companion's  innocent, serious little face.    \"I am afraid you did not quite understand me,\" he explained. \"When I  said 'ancient lineage' I did not mean old age; I meant that the name  of such a family has been known in the world a long time; perhaps for  hundreds of years persons bearing that name have been known and spoken  of in the history of their country.\"    \"Like George Washington,\" said Ceddie. \"I've heard of him ever since I  was born, and he was known about, long before that. Mr. Hobbs says  he will never be forgotten. That's because of the Declaration of  Independence, you know, and the Fourth of July. You see, he was a very  brave man.\"    \"The first Earl of Dorincourt,\" said Mr. Havisham solemnly, \"was created  an earl four hundred years ago.\"    \"Well, well!\" said Ceddie. \"That was a long time ago! Did you tell  Dearest that? It would int'rust her very much. We'll tell her when she  comes in. She always likes to hear cur'us things. What else does an earl  do besides being created?\"    \"A great many of them have helped to govern England. Some of them have  been"]]]
