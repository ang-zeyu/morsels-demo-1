Only the shreds and patches of  authority were left. Gradually the union fell apart. Of the Continental  Congress only fifteen members, representing seven colonies, remained to  transact the affairs of the new nation. The army, which previously to  the termination of the war had dissolved by the hundreds, was now unpaid  and in a stale of revolt. Measure after measure was proposed in Congress  to raise money to pay the interest on the bonded indebtedness, which was  in arrears, and to provide funds for the most necessary expenses, but  these failed, in Congress for the want of the necessary nine votes or,  if enacted, the States treated the requisitions with indifference. The  currency of the United States had fallen almost as low as the Austrian  kronen, and men derisively plastered the walls of their houses with the  worthless paper of the Continental Congress. Adequate authority no  longer remained to carry out the terms of the treaties with England and  France, and they were nullified by the failure of the infant nation to  comply with its own obligations and the consequent refusal of the other  contracting parties to comply with theirs. The government made a call  upon the States to raise $8,000,000 for the most vital needs, but only  $400,000 was actually received. Then Congress asked the States to vest  in it the power to levy a tax of five per cent, on imports for a limited  period, but, after waiting two years for the action of the States, less  than nine concurred. The States were then asked to pledge their own  internal revenue for twenty-five years to meet the national  indebtedness, but this could only be done by unanimous consent, and  while twelve States concurred, Rhode Island refused and the measure was  defeated. It was again the infinite folly of the _liberum veto_ which,  prior to the great partition, condemned Poland to chronic anarchy.    The impotence of the new government, which was still sitting in  Philadelphia, can be measured by the fact that on June 9, 1783, word  came that eighty soldiers were on their way to Philadelphia to demand  relief. They stacked their arms in front of the State House, where the  Congress was then sitting, and refused to disband, when requested by  Col. Alexander Hamilton, as the representative of the Congress, to do  so. When Congress appealed to the government of Pennsylvania for  protection, it was advised that the Pennsylvania militia was likewise  insubordinate. The Congress then hastily fled by night and became a  fugitive.    The impotence of the Confederation can be measured by the fact that in  the last fourteen months of its existence its receipts were less than  $400,000, while the interest on the foreign debt alone was over  $2,400,000, and the interest on the internal debt was five-fold greater.    In the absence of any government and in the period of general  prostration it was not unnatural that the spirit of Bolshevism grew with  alarming rapidity. It even permeated the officers of the Army. In March,  1783, an anonymous communication was sent to Washington's officers to  meet in secret conference to take some action, possibly to overthrow the  government. A copy fell into Washington's hands and, while he forbade  the assemblage of the officers under the anonymous call, he himself  directed the officers to assemble. He unexpectedly appeared at the  meeting and, being no speaker, he had reduced his appeal to writing. As  he adjusted his spectacles to read it, he pathetically said: \"I have not  only grown gray but blind in your service.\" He then made a touching  appeal to them not to increase by example the spreading spirit of  revolt. The very sight of their old commander turned the hearts of the  revolting element and the officers remained loyal to their noble leader.    Where the spirit of disaffection was thus found in high places it  naturally prevailed more widely among the masses who had been driven to  frenzy by their sufferings. This culminated in a revolt in Massachusetts  under the leadership of an old soldier named Shays, and it spread with  such rapidity that not only did one-fifth of the people join in  attempting to overthrow the remnant of established authority in  Massachusetts, but it rapidly spread to other States. The offices of  government and the courthouses were seized, the collection of debts was  forbidden, and private property was forcibly appropriated to meet the  common needs.    Chaos had come again. It filled Washington's heart with disgust and  despair. After surrendering his commission to the pitiful remnant of the  government he had retired to Mount Vernon, and for a time declined to  act further as the leader of his people. Thus, in October, 1785, he  wrote James Warren, of Massachusetts:        \"The war, as you have very justly observed, has terminated most      advantageously for America, and a fair field is presented to our      view; but I confess to you freely, my dear sir, that I do not think      we possess wisdom or justice enough to cultivate it properly.      Illiberality, jealousy, and local policy mix too much in all our      public councils for good government of the union. In a word, the      Confederation appears to me to be little more than a shadow without      the substance, and Congress a nugatory body, their ordinances being      little attended to.... By such policy as this the wheels of      government are clogged, and our brightest prospects, and that high      expectation which was entertained of us by the wondering world, are      turned into astonishment; and, from the high ground on which we      stood, we are descending into the vale of confusion and darkness.\"    Again he wrote to George Mason:        \"I have seen without despondency, even for a moment, the hours which      America has styled its gloomy ones, but I have beheld no day since      the commencement of hostilities that I thought our liberties in such      imminent danger as at present. Indeed, we are verging so fast to      destruction that I am feeling that sense to which I have been a      stranger until within these three months.\"    Again in 1786 he writes:        \"I think often of our situation, and view it with concern. From the      high ground we stood upon, from the plain path which invited our      footsteps, to be so fallen, so lost, is mortifying; but everything      of virtue has, in a degree, taken its departure from our land....      What, gracious God, is man that there should be such inconsistency,      and perfidiousness in his conduct! It was but the other day that we      were shedding our blood to obtain the Constitutions under which we      now live, and now we are unsheathing our swords to overturn them.      The thing is so unaccountable that I hardly know how to realize it      or to persuade myself that I am not under an illusion of a dream.\"    It was, however, the darkest hour before the dawn, and again it was  Washington who became his country's saviour. In 1785, some commissioners  from the States of Virginia and Maryland visited Mount Vernon to pay  their respects to the well-loved commander. After conferring with him  upon the chaos of the times, they decided to issue a call for a general  conference of the representatives of the States to be held on September  11, 1786, at Annapolis, Maryland, to discuss how far the States  themselves could agree on common regulations of commerce. At the  appointed time the delegates assembled from Virginia, Pennsylvania,  Delaware, New York and New Jersey, and finding themselves too few in  number to achieve the great objective, the convention contented itself  by issuing another call, drafted by Alexander Hamilton, then under  thirty years of age, to all the States to send delegates to a convention  to be held in Philadelphia on the second Monday in May, 1787, \"to take  into consideration the situation of the United States, to devise such  further provisions as should appear to them necessary to render the  Constitution of the Federal Government adequate to the exigencies of the  Union.\"    The dying Congress tardily approved of this suggestion, but finally, on  January 21, 1787, grudgingly adopted a resolution that--        \"It is expedient that on the second Monday in May next a convention      of delegates, who shall have been appointed by the several States,      be held at Philadelphia _for the sole and express purpose of      revising the Articles of Confederation_ and reporting to Congress      and the several legislatures such alterations and provisions therein      as shall, _when agreed to in Congress_ and conformed to by the      States, render the Federal Constitution adequate to the exigency of      the government and the preservation of the union.\"    It will be noted by the italicized portions of the resolution that this  impotent body thus vainly attempted to cling to the shadow of its  vanished authority by stating that the proposed constitutional  convention should merely revise the worthless Articles of Confederation  and that such amendments should not have validity until adopted by  Congress as well as by the people of the several States. How this  mandate was disregarded and how the convention was formed, and  proceeded to create a new government with a new Constitution, and how  it achieved its mighty work, will be the subject of the next lecture.    Anticipating the masterly ability with which a seemingly impotent and  dying nation plucked from the nettle of danger the flower of safety, let  me conclude this first address by quoting the words of de Tocqueville,  in his remarkable work _Democracy in America_, where he says:        \"The Federal Government, condemned to impotence by its Constitution      and no longer sustained by the presence of common danger ... was      already on the verge of destruction when it officially proclaimed      its inability "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10066"],[0,"Gunman's Reckoning (#6)"],[1,"'s all\"--Donnegan actually began to mount the steps--\"I'll go in  and talk to your father myself.\"    She had retired one pace as he began advancing, but as the import of  what he said became clear to her she was rooted to one position by  astonishment.    \"Colonel Macon--my father--\" she began. Then: \"Do you really wish to see  him?\"    The hushed voice made Donnegan smile--it was such a voice as one boy  uses when he asks the other if he really dares enter the pasture of the  red bull. He chuckled again, and this time she smiled, and her eyes were  widened, partly by fear of his purpose and partly from his nearness.  They seemed to be suddenly closer together. As though they were on one  side against a common enemy, and that enemy was her father. The old  woman was cackling sharply from the bottom of the stairs, and then  bobbing in pursuit and calling on Donnegan to come back. At length the  girl raised her hand and silenced her with a gesture.    Donnegan was now hardly a pace away; and he saw that she lived up to all  the promise of that first glance. Yet still she seemed unreal. There is  a quality of the unearthly about a girl's beauty; it is, after all, only  a gay moment between the formlessness of childhood and the hardness of  middle age. This girl was pale, Donnegan saw, and yet she had color. She  had the luster, say, of a white rose, and the same bloom. Lou, the old  woman had called her, and Macon was her father's name. Lou Macon--the  name fitted her, Donnegan thought. For that matter, if her name had been  Sally Smith, Donnegan would probably have thought it beautiful. The  keener a man's mind is and the more he knows about men and women and the  ways of the world, the more apt he is to be intoxicated by a touch of  grace and thoughtfulness; and all these age-long seconds the perfume of  girlhood had been striking up to Donnegan's brain.    She brushed her timidity away and with the same gesture accepted  Donnegan as something more than a dangerous vagrant. She took the lamp  from the hands of the crone and sent her about her business,  disregarding the mutterings and the warnings which trailed behind the  departing form. Now she faced Donnegan, screening the light from her  eyes with a cupped hand and by the same device focusing it upon the face  of Donnegan. He mutely noted the small maneuver and gave her credit; but  for the pleasure of seeing the white of her fingers and the way they  tapered to a pink transparency at the tips, he forgot the poor figure he  must make with his soiled, ragged shirt, his unshaven face, his gaunt  cheeks.    Indeed, he looked so straight at her that in spite of her advantage with  the light she had to avoid his glance.    \"I am sorry,\" said Lou Macon, \"and ashamed because we can't take you in.  The only house on the range where you wouldn't be welcome, I know. But  my father leads a very close life; he has set ways. The ways of an  invalid, Mr. Donnegan.\"    \"And you're bothered about speaking to him of me?\"    \"I'm almost afraid of letting you go in yourself.\"    \"Let me take the risk.\"    She considered him again for a moment, and then turned with a nod and he  followed her up the stairs into the upper hall. The moment they stepped  into it he heard her clothes flutter and a small gale poured on them. It  was criminal to allow such a building to fall into this ruinous  condition. And a gloomy picture rose in Donnegan's mind of the invalid,  thin-faced, sallow-eyed, white-haired, lying in his bed listening to the  storm and silently gathering bitterness out of the pain of living. Lou  Macon paused again in the hall, close to a door on the right.    \"I'm going to send you in to speak to my father,\" she said gravely.  \"First I have to tell you that he's different.\"    Donnegan replied by looking straight at her, and this time she did not  wince from the glance. Indeed, she seemed to be probing him, searching  with a peculiar hope. What could she expect to find in him? What that  was useful to her? Not once in all his life had such a sense of  impotence descended upon Donnegan. Her father? Bah! Invalid or no  invalid he would handle that fellow, and if the old man had an acrid  temper, Donnegan at will could file his own speech to a point. But the  girl! In the meager hand which held the lamp there was a power which all  the muscles of Donnegan could not compass; and in his weakness he looked  wistfully at her.    \"I hope your talk will be pleasant. I hope so.\" She laid her hand on the  knob of the door and withdrew it hastily; then, summoning great  resolution, she opened the door and showed Donnegan in.    \"Father,\" she said, \"this is Mr. Donnegan. He wishes to speak to you.\"    The door closed behind Donnegan, and hearing that whishing sound which  the door of a heavy safe will make, he looked down at this, and saw that  it was actually inches thick! Once more the sense of being in a trap  descended upon him.          7      He found himself in a large room which, before he could examine a single  feature of it, was effectively curtained from his sight. Straight into  his face shot a current of violent white light that made him blink.  There was the natural recoil, but in Donnegan recoils were generally  protected by several strata of willpower and seldom showed in any  physical action. On the present occasion his first dismay was swiftly  overwhelmed by a cold anger at the insulting trick. This was not the  trick of a helpless invalid; Donnegan could not see a single thing  before him, but he obeyed a very deep instinct and advanced straight  into the current of light.    He was glad to see the light switched away. The comparative darkness  washed across his eyes in a pleasant wave and he was now able to  distinguish a few things in the room. It was, as he had first surmised,  quite large. The ceiling was high; the proportions comfortably spacious;  but what astounded Donnegan was the real elegance of the furnishings.  There was no mistaking the deep, silken texture of the rug upon which he  stepped; the glow of light barely reached the wall, and there showed  faintly in streaks along yellowish hangings. Beside a table which  supported a big reading lamp--gasoline, no doubt, from the intensity of  its light--sat Colonel Macon with a large volume spread across his  knees. Donnegan saw two highlights--fine silver hair that covered the  head of the invalid and a pair of white hands fallen idly upon the  surface of the big book, for if the silver hair suggested age the  smoothly finished hands suggested perennial youth. They were strong,  carefully tended, complacent hands. They suggested to Donnegan a man  sufficient unto himself.    \"Mr. Donnegan, I am sorry that I cannot rise to receive you. Now, what  pleasant accident has brought me the favor of this call?\"    Donnegan was taken aback again, and this time more strongly than by the  flare of light against his eyes. For in the voice he recognized the  quality of the girl--the same softness, the same velvety richness,  though the pitch was a bass. In the voice of this man there was the same  suggestion that the tone would crack if it were forced either up or  down. With this great difference, one could hardly conceive of a  situation which would push that man's voice beyond its monotone. It  flowed with deadly, all-embracing softness. It clung about one; it  fascinated and baffled the mind of the listener.    But Donnegan was not in the habit of being baffled by voices. Neither  was he a lover of formality. He looked about for a place to sit down,  and immediately discovered that while the invalid sat in an enormous  easy-chair bordered by shelves and supplied with wheels for raising and  lowering the back and for propelling the chair about the room on its  rubber tires, it was the only chair in the room which could make any  pretensions toward comfort. As a matter of fact, aside from this one  immense chair, devoted to the pleasure of the invalid, there was nothing  in the room for his visitors to sit upon except two or three miserable  backless stools.    But Donnegan was not long taken aback. He tucked his cap under his arm,  bowed profoundly in honor of the colonel's compliments, and brought one  of the stools to a place where it was no nearer the rather ominous  circle of the lamplight than was the invalid himself. With his eyes  accustomed to the new light, Donnegan could now take better stock of his  host. He saw a rather handsome face, with eyes exceedingly blue, young,  and active; but the features of Macon as well as his body were blurred  and obscured by a great fatness. He was truly a prodigious man, and one  could understand the stoutness with which the invalid chair was made.  His great wrist dimpled like the wrist of a healthy baby, and his face  was so enlarged with superfluous flesh that the lower part of it quite  dwarfed the upper. He seemed, at first glance, a man with a low forehead  and bright, careless eyes and a body made immobile by flesh and  sickness. A man whose spirits despised and defied pain. Yet a second  glance showed that the forehead was, after all, a nobly proportioned  one, and for all the bulk of that figure, for all the cripple-chair,  Donnegan would not have been surprised to see the bulk spring lightly  out of the chair to meet him.    For his own part, sitting back on the stool with his cap tucked under  his arm and his hands folded about one knee, he met the faint, cold  smile of the colonel with a broad grin of his own.    \"I can put it in a nutshell,\" said Donnegan. \"I was tired; dead beat;  needed a handout, and rapped at your door. Along comes a mystery in the  shape of an ugly-looking woman and opens the door to me. Tries to shut  me out; I decided to come in. She insists on keeping me outside; all at  once I see that I have to get into the house. I am brought in; your  daughter tries to steer me off, sees that the job is more than she can  get away with, and"]]]
