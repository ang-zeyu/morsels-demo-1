[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51547"],[0,"The Story of the Airship (Non-rigid) (#5)"],[1," legend of the  airship service. Nothing new developed in war had subtracted anything  from the ability of American airships to do in this war what British  non-rigids had done in the last. Commander J. L. Kenworthy and after him  Commander G. H. Mills as commanding officer at Lakehurst turned to  non-rigids.    Under Mills was instituted, quietly, unostentatiously, with what ships  he had, a series of practice patrols to determine the usefulness of  airships in this field, to discover and perfect technique, and to train  officers and men.    Lakehurst had a curious conglomeration of airships to start with. There  were two J ships of immediate post-war type, with open cockpits, 210,000  cubic feet capacity; two TC ships, inherited from the Army, of more  modern design, and larger size; the ZMC2, an experimental job built to  study the use of a metal cover, and about to be scrapped after nine  years of existence; the L-1, the same size as the Goodyear ships,  123,000 cubic feet, the first modern training ship, which would be  joined later by the L-2 and L-3; the G-1, a larger trainer of Goodyear  Defender size, useful for group instruction, and the 320,000 cubic foot  K-1, which had been built for experiments in the use of fuel gas. Only  the K-2, prototype of the 416,000 cubic foot patrol ships later ordered  could be called a modern airship, though the Army dirigibles also had  good cruising radius.    Yet with this curious assortment of airships of various sizes, types and  ages, the Navy carried on practice patrols covering the areas between  Montauk and the Virginia Capes, flying day after day, built an  impressive accumulation of flight data, missed very few days on account  of weather, made it a point not to miss a rendezvous with the surface  fleet. More than any one thing it was this demonstration, over an  18-month period, which led to the revival of an airship program in this  country, the ordering of ships and land bases.    Let us see what a blimp patrol is like. The airship can fly up to 65  knots or better, but this is no speed flight. The motors are throttled  down to 40 knots, so that the crew may see clearly, take its time, study  the moving surface underneath, scrutinize every trace of oil smear on  the surface, alert for the tell-tale \"feather\" of the submarine's wake,  air bubbles, a phosphorescent glow at night, for even a bit of debris  which might conceal a periscope.    A school of whales, a lone hammerhead shark on the surface or submerged  stirs the interest of the patrol, offers a tempting live target for the  bombs,--light charges with little more powder than a shot gun shell  uses. Now a ship records a direct hit on a shark's back 500 feet below.  He shakes his head, dives to escape this unseen enemy aloft. The airship  gives chase, follows the moving shadow below, so strikingly resembling a  submarine, finds the practice useful.    Of the crew of eight, everyone on the airship is on watch, with an  observation tower open on all sides, without interference of wings, as  in the airplane. Compared with surface craft, the airship can patrol  more area in a dawn to dusk patrol because of its speed and its wide  range of unbroken observation.    The submarine is more efficient in relatively shallow depths, but  airships have spotted the silhouetted shadow of U-boats in clear water  as deep as 70 feet below the surface. The submarine will attempt to  maneuver within a mile of its target to launch its torpedoes  effectively. But even at a mile away the ten inches of periscope which  projects above the surface is difficult for other craft to  detect,--either for a cruiser at sea level, or an airplane, flying at  relatively high speed, a threat either may miss.    Airship crews are at action stations even during peace time, on the  alert against the appearance of strange craft. They identify each  passing ship through binoculars, by voice or radio, taking no chances  that attack without warning by a seeming peaceful ship might not be a  declaration of war. As many as 40 or 50 ships may be encountered and  identified in a day's patrol. The airships are off at sun-up, back at  sundown, unless on more extended reconnaissance, move quietly into the  big dock.    Patrol is tedious work. Occasionally there is a break in the routine.  Lt. Boyd has been assigned command of the big TC-14 for the next day's  patrol. He is up late studying the curious tracks he is to follow in  coordination with the other airships. At midnight however the radio  brings startling word. An airplane leaving Norfolk with a crew of ten  for Newport, is reported missing. Nearby destroyers, airplanes,  airships, are ordered out as a searching party. The TC-14, having the  longest cruising radius, 52 hours without refueling, is sent off at  once, with a senior officer, Lt. Trotter, in charge. Men's lives may be  at stake.    By daylight, the TC-14 has flown over the entire northern half of the  plane's track and back, watching intently for distress signals or flares  or any sign of the distressed plane. Three miles north of Hog Island  light outside Norfolk, the ship encounters fog extending clear to the  water. Search of this area is hopeless and the ship scouts the edges,  waits for the fog to burn off. At noon as it lifts, pieces of wreckage  are spotted at the very area which it had hidden, and which the TC-14  had flown over five hours earlier.    The airship cruised around, hoping that some bit of wreckage might  support a survivor, finally returned to its station after 20 hours,  during which time it had covered 1,000 miles, intensively in parallel  courses 20 miles wide. Had the luckless plane or any of its crew been  able to send up flares anywhere within an area of 20,000 square miles of  water, the airship could have come up alongside and effected a rescue in  a matter of minutes.    In the meantime, Lt. Boyd, originally assigned to TC-14, was up at dawn  only to learn of the change in plans. He was assigned to pilot the  smaller G-1 trainer to New London, keep a sharp look-out enroute for the  missing plane, then work with the destroyers on torpedo exercises. The  G-1 had no galley aboard and in the rush the matter of food for an  18-hour cruise was somehow overlooked, and Boyd and his crew set off  with only a couple of sardine sandwiches apiece and a pot of coffee,  which quickly grew cold.    Late in the afternoon, seeing his crew growing hungrier and  hungrier,--for airshipping is excellent for the appetite,--Boyd had an  idea. He radioed the Destroyer Division Commander: \"After last torpedo  recovered, would you be able to furnish us with some hot coffee and a  loaf of bread, if we lower a container on a 200-foot line across your  after deck?\"    Never in naval history had an airship borrowed chow from a surface  craft. But the answer came promptly. \"Affirmative. Do you wish cream and  sugar?\"    There was nothing in the books giving the procedure for borrowing a meal  from the air, but the crew rigged up a line from a target sleeve reel,  fastened a hook with a quick release at the end, attached a monkey  wrench to weight it down, stood by for the word to come alongside.    Then while the crews of three destroyers watched, the G-1 swung slowly  over the destroyer's deck. One sailor caught the line held it while a  second filled the coffee pot, and a third attached a load of sandwiches.  Then the airship sailors hauled away, radioed their thanks, set off for  the 200 mile trip back to Lakehurst, while hundreds of sailors below  waved their white caps and cheered, a little inter-ship courtesy between  sky and sea which all hands will long remember.                                         CHAPTER IV                          The Beginnings of Flight          [Illustration: Hot-air balloon]    In the spring of 1783, as the American Revolution was nearing a  successful conclusion, two brothers named Montgolfier sitting before a  fire at a little town in France found themselves wondering why smoke  went up into the air.    That was just as foolish as Newton wondering why an apple, detached from  the tree, fell down. Smoke had always gone up and apples had always come  down. That was all there was to it.    But when men wonder momentous events may be in the making. In these  instances epochal discoveries resulted: the law of gravitation and the  possibility of human flight.    The legends of Icarus and the narrative of Darius Green are symbols of  the long ambition of earth-bound men, even before the days of recorded  history, to leave the earth and soar into the air. The Montgolfiers had  found the key.    But a hundred years would pass before the discovery would be put to use.  It was in 1903 that another pair of brothers, the Wrights, made their  first flight from Kill Devil Hill in North Carolina. The first Zeppelin  took off from the shores of Lake Constance in 1900.    The Montgolfiers wasted no time testing out their conclusion that smoke  rose because it was lighter than the air. They built a great paper bag  35 feet high, hung a brazier of burning charcoal under it, and off it  went. Annonnay is a small town but the story of that miracle spread far  and wide. The Academy of Science invited them to the capital to repeat  the experiment.    But while they were building a new bag a French physicist, Prof. J. A.  C. Charles, stole a march on them. He knew that hydrogen was also  lighter than air, so constructed a bag of silk, inflated it with  hydrogen, sent it aloft before the Montgolfiers were ready.    Still the countrymen were not to lose their hour of glory. Merely to  repeat what had already been done was not enough. Their balloon was to  be flown from the grounds of the Palace of Versailles, before the king  and court and all the great folk of Paris, with half the people of the  city craning their necks to watch it pass over. So they loaded aboard a  basket containing a sheep, a duck and a rooster, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5157"],[0,"How I Found Livingstone (#5)"],[1,"a saddle to be manufactured by myself and my white  man Farquhar, wholly from canvas, rope, and cotton.    Three or four frasilahs of cotton, and ten bolts of canvas were required  for the saddles. A specimen saddle was made by myself in order to test  its efficiency. A donkey was taken and saddled, and a load of 140  lbs. was fastened to it, and though the animal--a wild creature of  Unyamwezi--struggled and reared frantic ally, not a particle gave  way. After this experiment, Farquhar was set to work to manufacture  twenty-one more after the same pattern. Woollen pads were also purchased  to protect the animals from being galled. It ought to be mentioned here,  perhaps, that the idea of such a saddle as I manufactured, was first  derived from the Otago saddle, in use among the transport-trains of the  English army in Abyssinia.    A man named John William Shaw--a native of London, England, lately  third-mate of the American ship 'Nevada'--applied to me for work. Though  his discharge from the 'Nevada' was rather suspicious, yet he possessed  all the requirements of such a man as I needed, and was an experienced  hand with the palm and needle, could cut canvas to fit anything, was  a pretty good navigator, ready and willing, so far as his professions  went.. I saw no reason to refuse his services, and he was accordingly  engaged at $300 per annum, to rank second to William L. Farquhar.  Farquhar was a capital navigator and excellent mathematician; was  strong, energetic, and clever.    The next thing I was engaged upon was to enlist, arm, and equip, a  faithful escort of twenty men for the road. Johari, the chief dragoman  of the American Consulate, informed me that he knew where certain of  Speke's \"Faithfuls\" were yet to be found. The idea had struck me before,  that if I could obtain the services of a few men acquainted with the  ways of white men, and who could induce other good men to join the  expedition I was organizing, I might consider myself fortunate. More  especially had I thought of Seedy Mbarak Mombay, commonly called  \"Bombay,\" who though his head was \"woodeny,\" and his hands \"clumsy,\" was  considered to be the \"faithfulest\" of the \"Faithfuls.\"    With the aid of the dragoman Johari, I secured in a few hours the  services of Uledi (Capt. Grant's former valet), Ulimengo, Baruti,  Ambari, Mabruki (Muinyi Mabruki--Bull-headed Mabruki, Capt. Burton's  former unhappy valet)--five of Speke's \"Faithfuls.\" When I asked them if  they were willing to join another white man's expedition to Ujiji,  they replied very readily that they were willing to join any brother  of \"Speke's.\" Dr. John Kirk, Her Majesty's Consul at Zanzibar, who was  present, told them that though I was no brother of \"Speke's,\" I spoke  his language. This distinction mattered little to them: and I heard  them, with great delight, declare their readiness to go anywhere with  me, or do anything I wished.    Mombay, as they called him, or Bombay, as we know him, had gone to  Pemba, an island lying north of Zanzibar. Uledi was sure Mombay  would jump with joy at the prospect of another expedition. Johari was  therefore commissioned to write to him at Pemba, to inform him of the  good fortune in store for him.    On the fourth morning after the letter had been despatched, the famous  Bombay made his appearance, followed in decent order and due rank by  the \"Faithfuls\" of \"Speke.\" I looked in vain for the \"woodeny head\" and  \"alligator teeth\" with which his former master had endowed him. I saw  a slender short man of fifty or thereabouts, with a grizzled head, an  uncommonly high, narrow forehead, with a very large mouth, showing teeth  very irregular, and wide apart. An ugly rent in the upper front row of  Bombay's teeth was made with the clenched fist of Capt. Speke in Uganda  when his master's patience was worn out, and prompt punishment became  necessary. That Capt. Speke had spoiled him with kindness was  evident, from the fact that Bombay had the audacity to stand up for a  boxing-match with him. But these things I only found out, when, months  afterwards, I was called upon to administer punishment to him myself.  But, at his first appearance, I was favourably impressed with Bombay,  though his face was rugged, his mouth large, his eyes small, and his  nose flat.    \"Salaam aliekum,\" were the words he greeted me with. \"Aliekum salaam,\"  I replied, with all the gravity I could muster. I then informed him I  required him as captain of my soldiers to Ujiji. His reply was that he  was ready to do whatever I told him, go wherever I liked in short, be a  pattern to servants, and a model to soldiers. He hoped I would give him  a uniform, and a good gun, both of which were promised.    Upon inquiring for the rest of the \"Faithfuls\" who accompanied Speke  into Egypt, I was told that at Zanzibar there were but six. Ferrajji,  Maktub, Sadik, Sunguru, Manyu, Matajari, Mkata, and Almas, were dead;  Uledi and Mtamani were in Unyanyembe; Hassan had gone to Kilwa, and  Ferahan was supposed to be in Ujiji.    Out of the six \"Faithfuls,\" each of whom still retained his medal for  assisting in the \"Discovery of the Sources of the Nile,\" one,  poor Mabruki, had met with a sad misfortune, which I feared would  incapacitate him from active usefulness.    Mabruki the \"Bull-headed,\" owned a shamba (or a house with a garden  attached to it), of which he was very proud. Close to him lived a  neighbour in similar circumstances, who was a soldier of Seyd Majid,  with whom Mabruki, who was of a quarrelsome disposition, had a feud,  which culminated in the soldier inducing two or three of his comrades to  assist him in punishing the malevolent Mabruki, and this was done in a  manner that only the heart of an African could conceive. They tied  the unfortunate fellow by his wrists to a branch of a tree, and after  indulging their brutal appetite for revenge in torturing him, left him  to hang in that position for two days. At the expiration of the second  day, he was accidentally discovered in a most pitiable condition. His  hands had swollen to an immense size, and the veins of one hand having  been ruptured, he had lost its use. It is needless to say that, when the  affair came to Seyd Majid's ears, the miscreants were severely punished.  Dr. Kirk, who attended the poor fellow, succeeded in restoring one hand  to something of a resemblance of its former shape, but the other hand is  sadly marred, and its former usefulness gone for ever.    However, I engaged Mabruki, despite his deformed hands, his ugliness and  vanity, because he was one of Speke's \"Faithfuls.\" For if he but wagged  his tongue in my service, kept his eyes open, and opened his mouth at  the proper time, I assured myself I could make him useful.    Bombay, my captain of escort, succeeded in getting eighteen more free  men to volunteer as \"askari\" (soldiers), men whom he knew would not  desert, and for whom he declared himself responsible. They were an  exceedingly fine-looking body of men, far more intelligent in appearance  than I could ever have believed African barbarians could be. They hailed  principally from Uhiyow, others from Unyamwezi, some came from Useguhha  and Ugindo.    Their wages were set down at $36 each man per annum, or $3 each per  month. Each soldier was provided with a flintlock musket, powder horn,  bullet-pouch, knife, and hatchet, besides enough powder and ball for 200  rounds.    Bombay, in consideration of his rank, and previous faithful services  to Burton, Speke and Grant, was engaged at $80 a year, half that sum  in advance, a good muzzle-loading rifle, besides, a pistol, knife, and  hatchet were given to him, while the other five \"Faithfuls,\" Ambari,  Mabruki, Ulimengo, Baruti, and Uledi, were engaged at $40 a year, with  proper equipments as soldiers.    Having studied fairly well all the East African travellers' books  regarding Eastern and Central Africa, my mind had conceived the  difficulties which would present themselves during the prosecution of my  search after Dr. Livingstone.    To obviate all of these, as well as human wit could suggest, was my  constant thought and aim.    \"Shall I permit myself, while looking from Ujiji over the waters of  the Tanganika Lake to the other side, to be balked on the threshold of  success by the insolence of a King Kannena or the caprice of a Hamed  bin Sulayyam?\" was a question I asked myself. To guard against such a  contingency I determined to carry my own boats. \"Then,\" I thought, \"if  I hear of Livingstone being on the Tanganika, I can launch my boat and  proceed after him.\"    I procured one large boat, capable of carrying twenty persons, with  stores and goods sufficient for a cruise, from the American Consul, for  the sum of $80, and a smaller one from another American gentleman for  $40. The latter would hold comfortably six men, with suitable stores.    I did not intend to carry the boats whole or bodily, but to strip them  of their boards, and carry the timbers and thwarts only. As a substitute  for the boards, I proposed to cover each boat with a double canvas skin  well tarred. The work of stripping them and taking them to pieces fell  to me. This little job occupied me five days.    I also packed them up, for the pagazis. Each load was carefully weighed,  and none exceeded 68 lbs. in weight. John Shaw excelled himself in the  workmanship displayed on the canvas boats; when finished, they fitted  their frames admirably. The canvas--six bolts of English hemp, No.  3--was procured from Ludha Damji, who furnished it from the Sultan's  storeroom.    An insuperable obstacle to rapid transit in Africa is the want of  carriers, and as speed was the main object of the Expedition under my  command, my duty was to lessen this difficulty as much as possible.  My carriers could only be engaged after arriving at Bagamoyo, on the  mainland. I had over twenty good donkeys ready, and I thought a  cart adapted for the"]]]
