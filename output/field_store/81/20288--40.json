Oh, boo-hoo! boo-hoo! boo-hoo!  It is a terrible disgrace!\"    \"You will not have to bear it long,\" said the prince, soothingly.  \"I  am going to hang you in a few minutes.\"    \"Thanks!  Thank you very much!\" answered the king, ceasing to weep.  \"I  have always expected to be hanged some day, and I am glad no one but  you two boys will witness me when my feet begin kicking about.\"    \"I shall not kick,\" declared another of the thieves, who had also  regained his senses.  \"I shall sing while I am being hanged.\"    \"But you can not, my good Gunder,\" protested the king; \"for the rope  will cut off your breath, and no man can sing without breath.\"    \"Then I shall whistle,\" said Gunder, composedly.    The king cast at him a look of reproach, and turning to Prince Marvel  he said:    \"It will be a great task to string up so many thieves.  You look tired.  Permit me to assist you to hang the others, and then I will climb into  a tree and hang myself from a strong branch, with as little bother as  possible.\"    \"Oh, I won't think of troubling you,\" exclaimed Marvel, with a laugh.  \"Having conquered you alone, I feel it my duty to hang you without  assistance--save that of my esquire.\"    \"It's no trouble, I assure you; but suit your own convenience,\" said  the thief, carelessly.  Then he cast his eye toward the cave and asked:  \"What will you do with all our treasure?\"    \"Give it to the poor,\" said Prince Marvel, promptly.    \"What poor?\"    \"Oh, the poorest people I can find.\"    \"Will you permit me to advise you in this matter?\" asked the king of  thieves, politely.    \"Yes, indeed; for I am a stranger in this land,\" returned the prince.    \"Well, I know a lot of people who are so poor that they have no  possessions whatever, neither food to eat, houses to live in, nor any  clothing but that which covers their bodies.  They can call no man  friend, nor will any lift a hand to help them.  Indeed, good sir, I  verily believe they will soon perish miserably unless you come to their  assistance!\"    \"Poor creatures!\" exclaimed Prince Marvel, with ready sympathy; \"tell  me who they are, and I will divide amongst them all your ill-gotten  gains.\"    \"They are ourselves,\" replied the king of thieves, with a sigh.    Marvel looked at him in amazement, and then burst into joyous laughter.    \"Yourselves!\" he cried, greatly amused.    \"Indeed, yes!\" said Wul-Takim, sadly.  \"There are no poorer people in  all the world, for we have ropes about our necks and are soon to be  hanged.  To-morrow we shall not have even our flesh left, for the crows  will pick our bones.\"    \"That is true,\" remarked Marvel, thoughtfully.  \"But, if I restore to  you the treasure, how will it benefit you, since you are about to die?\"    \"Must you really hang us?\" asked the thief.    \"Yes; I have decreed it, and you deserve your fate.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Because you have wickedly taken from helpless people their property,  and committed many other crimes besides.\"    \"But I have reformed!  We have all reformed--have we not, brothers?\"    \"We have!\" answered the other thieves, who, having regained their  senses, were listening to this conversation with much interest.    \"And, if you will return to us our treasure, we will promise never to  steal again, but to remain honest men and enjoy our wealth in peace,\"  promised the king.    \"Honest men could not enjoy treasures they have stolen,\" said Prince  Marvel.    \"True; but this treasure is now yours, having been won by you in fair  battle.  And if you present it to us it will no longer be stolen  treasure, but a generous gift from a mighty prince, which we may enjoy  with clear consciences.\"    \"Yet there remains the fact that I have promised to hang you,\"  suggested Prince Marvel, with a smile, for the king amused him greatly.    \"Not at all!  Not at all!\" cried Wul-Takim.  \"You promised to hang  fifty-nine thieves, and there is no doubt the fifty-nine thieves  deserved to be hung.  But, consider!  We have all reformed our ways and  become honest men; so it would be a sad and unkindly act to hang  fifty-nine honest men!\"    \"What think you, Nerle?\" asked the Prince, turning to his esquire.    \"Why, the rogue seems to speak truth,\" said Nerle, scratching his head  with a puzzled air, \"yet, if he speaks truth, there is little  difference between a rogue and an honest man.  Ask him, my master, what  caused them all to reform so suddenly.\"    \"Because we were about to die, and we thought it a good way to save our  lives,\" replied the robber king.    \"That's an honest answer, anyway,\" said Nerle.  \"Perhaps, sir, they  have really reformed.\"    \"And if so, I will not have the death of fifty-nine honest men on my  conscience,\" declared the prince.  Then he turned to Wul-Takim and  added: \"I will release you and give you the treasure, as you request.  But you owe me allegiance from this time forth, and if I ever hear of  your becoming thieves again, I promise to return and hang every one of  you.\"    \"Never fear!\" answered Wul-Takim, joyfully.  \"It is hard work to steal,  and while we have so much treasure it is wholly unnecessary.  Moreover,  having accepted from you our lives and our fortunes, we shall hereafter  be your devoted servants, and whenever you need our services you have  but to call upon us, and we will support you loyally and gladly.\"    \"I accept your service,\" answered the prince, graciously.    And then he unbound the fifty-nine honest men and took the ropes from  their necks.  As nightfall was fast approaching the new servants set to  work to prepare a great feast in honor of their master.  It was laid in  the middle of the grassy clearing, that all might sit around and  celebrate the joyous occasion.    \"Do you think you can trust these men?\" asked Nerle, suspiciously.    \"Why not?\" replied the prince.  \"They have been exceedingly wicked, it  is true; but they are now intent upon being exceedingly good.  Let us  encourage them in this.  If we mistrusted all who have ever done an  evil act there would be fewer honest people in the world.  And if it  were as interesting to do a good act as an evil one there is no doubt  every one would choose the good.\"        6.  The Troubles of Nerle    That night Prince Marvel slept within the cave, surrounded by the  fifty-nine reformed thieves, and suffered no harm at their hands.  In  the morning, accompanied by his esquire, Nerle, who was mounted upon a  spirited horse brought him by Wul-Takim, he charged the honest men to  remember their promises, bade them good by, and set out in search of  further adventure.    As they left the clearing by the narrow passage that led between the  overhanging rocks, the prince looked back and saw that the sign above  the gate of the cave, which had told of the thieves' treasure house,  had been changed.  It now read as follows:                  WUL-TAKIM          KING OF HONEST MEN                ------          HIS PLEASURE HOUSE               WALK IN      \"That is much better,\" laughed the prince.  \"I accomplished some good  by my adventure, anyway!\"    Nerle did not reply.  He seemed especially quiet and thoughtful as he  rode by his master's side, and after they had traveled some distance in  silence Prince Marvel said:    \"Tell me how you came to be in the cave of thieves, and perched upon  the casks where I found you.\"    \"It is a sad story,\" returned Nerle, with a sigh; \"but since you  request me to tell it, the tale may serve to relieve the tedium of your  journey.    \"My father is a mighty baron, very wealthy and with a heart so kind  that he has ever taken pleasure in thrusting on me whatever gift he  could think of.  I had not a single desire unsatisfied, for before I  could wish for anything it was given me.    \"My mother was much like my father.  She and her women were always  making jams, jellies, candies, cakes and the like for me to eat; so I  never knew the pleasure of hunger.  My clothes were the gayest satins  and velvets, richly made and sewn with gold and silver braid; so it was  impossible to wish for more in the way of apparel.  They let me study  my lessons whenever I felt like it and go fishing or hunting as I  pleased; so I could not complain that I was unable to do just as I  wanted to.  All the servants obeyed my slightest wish: if I wanted to  sit up late at night no one objected; if I wished to lie in bed till  noon they kept the house quiet so as not to disturb me.    \"This condition of affairs, as you may imagine, grew more and more  tedious and exasperating the older I became.  Try as I might, I could  find nothing to complain of.  I once saw the son of one of our servants  receive a flogging; and my heart grew light.  I immediately begged my  father to flog me, by way of variety; and he, who could refuse me  nothing, at once consented.  For this reason there was less  satisfaction in the operation than I had expected, although for the  time being it was a distinct novelty.    \"Now, no one could expect a high-spirited boy to put up with such a  life as mine.  With nothing to desire and no chance of doing anything  that would annoy my parents, my days were dreary indeed.\"    He paused to wipe the tears from his eyes, and the prince murmured,  sympathetically: \"Poor boy!  Poor boy!\"    \"Ah, you may well say that!\" continued Nerle.  \"But one day a stranger  came to my father's castle with tales of many troubles he had met with.  He had been lost in a forest and nearly starved to death.  He had been  robbed and beaten and left wounded and sore by the wayside.  He had  begged from door to door and been refused food or assistance.

Background  As we noted at the outset, the Internet is a vast,  interactive medium consisting of a decentralized network of  computers around the world.  The Internet presents low entry  barriers to anyone who wishes to provide or distribute  information.  Unlike television, cable, radio, newspapers,  magazines or books, the Internet provides an opportunity for  those with access to it to communicate with a worldwide audience  at little cost.  At least 400 million people use the Internet  worldwide, and approximately 143 million Americans were using the  Internet as of September 2001.  Nat'l Telecomm. & Info. Admin., A  Nation Online: How Americans Are Expanding Their Use of the  Internet  (February 2002), available at  http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/dn/.      The World Wide Web is a part of the Internet that consists  of a network of computers, called \"Web servers,\" that host  \"pages\" of content accessible via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol  or \"HTTP.\"  Anyone with a computer connected to the Internet can  search for and retrieve information stored on Web servers located  around the world.  Computer users typically access the Web by  running a program called a \"browser\" on their computers.  The  browser displays, as individual pages on the computer screen, the  various types of content found on the Web and lets the user  follow the connections built into Web pages  called \"hypertext  links,\" \"hyperlinks,\" or \"links\"  to additional content.  Two  popular browsers are Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape  Navigator.  A \"Web page\" is one or more files a browser graphically  assembles to make a viewable whole when a user requests content  over the Internet.  A Web page may contain a variety of different  elements, including text, images, buttons, form fields that the  user can fill in, and links to other Web pages.  A \"Web site\" is  a term that can be used in several different ways.  It may refer  to all of the pages and resources available on a particular Web  server.  It may also refer to all the pages and resources  associated with a particular organization, company or person,  even if these are located on different servers, or in a  subdirectory on a single server shared with other, unrelated  sites.  Typically, a Web site has as an intended point of entry,  a \"home page,\" which includes links to other pages on the same  Web site or to pages on other sites.  Online discussion groups  and chat rooms relating to a variety of subjects are available  through many Web sites.      Users may find content on the Web using engines that search  for requested keywords.  In response to a keyword request, a  search engine will display a list of Web sites that may contain  relevant content and provide links to those sites.  Search  engines and directories often return a limited number of sites in  their search results (e.g., the Google search engine will return  only 2,000 sites in response to a search, even if it has found,  for example, 530,000 sites in its index that meet the search  criteria).  A user may also access content on the Web by typing a URL  (Uniform Resource Locator) into the address line of the browser.   A URL is an address that points to some resource located on a  Web server that is accessible over the Internet.  This resource  may be a Web site, a Web page, an image, a sound or video file,  or other resource.  A URL can be either a numeric Internet  Protocol or \"IP\" address, or an alphanumeric \"domain name\"  address.  Every Web server connected to the Internet is assigned  an IP address.  A typical IP address looks like \"13.1.64.14.\"  Typing the URL \"http://13.1.64.14/\" into a browser will bring the  user to the Web server that corresponds to that address.  For  convenience, most Web servers have alphanumeric domain name  addresses in addition to IP addresses.  For example, typing in  \"http://www.paed.uscourts.gov\" will bring the user to the same  Web server as typing in \"http://204.170.64.143.\"  Every time a user attempts to access material located on a  Web server by entering a domain name address into a Web browser,  a request is made to a Domain Name Server, which is a directory  of domain names and IP addresses, to \"resolve,\" or translate, the  domain name address into an IP address.  That IP address is then  used to locate the Web server from which content is being  requested.  A Web site may be accessed by using either its domain  name address or its IP address.      A domain name address typically consists of several parts.  For example, the alphanumeric URL  http://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents/opinions can be broken  down into three parts.  The first part is the transfer protocol  the computer will use in accessing the content (e.g., \"http\" for  Hypertext Transfer Protocol); next is the name of the host server  on which the information is stored (e.g., www.paed.uscourts.gov);  and then the name of the particular file or directory on that  server (e.g., /documents/opinions).  A single Web page may be associated with more than one URL.   For example, the URLs http://www.newyorktimes.com and  http://www.nytimes.com will both take the user to the New York  Times home page.  The topmost directory in a Web site is often  referred to as that Web site's root directory or root URL.  For  example, in http://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents, the root URL  is http://www.paed.uscourts.gov.  There may be hundreds or  thousands of pages under a single root URL, or there may be one  or only a few.      There are a number of Web hosting companies that maintain  Web sites for other businesses and individuals, which can lead to  vast amounts of diverse content being located at the same IP  address.  Hosting services are offered either for a fee, or in  some cases, for free, allowing any individual with Internet  access to create a Web site.  Some hosting services are provided  through the process of \"IP-based hosting,\" where each domain name  is assigned a unique IP number.  For example, www.baseball.com  might map to the IP address \"10.3.5.9\" and www.XXX.com might map  to the IP address \"10.0.42.5.\"  Other hosting services are  provided through the process of \"name-based hosting,\" where  multiple domain name addresses are mapped to a single IP address.   If the hosting company were using this method, both  www.baseball.com and www.XXX.com could map to a single IP  address, e.g., \"10.3.5.9.\"  As a result of the \"name-based  hosting\" process, up to tens of thousands of pages with  heterogeneous content may share a single IP address.  2.        The Indexable Web, the \"Deep Web\"; Their Size  and Rates of Growth and Change    The universe of content on the Web that could be indexed, in  theory, by standard search engines is known as the \"publicly  indexable Web.\"  The publicly indexable Web is limited to those  pages that are accessible by following a link from another Web  page that is recognized by a search engine.  This limitation  exists because online indexing techniques used by popular search  engines and directories such as Yahoo, Lycos and AltaVista, are  based on \"spidering\" technology, which finds sites to index by  following links from site to site in a continuous search for new  content.  If a Web page or site is not linked by others, then  spidering will not discover that page or site.      Furthermore, many larger Web sites contain instructions,  through software, that prevent spiders from investigating that  site, and therefore the contents of such sites also cannot be  indexed using spidering technology.  Because of the vast size and  decentralized structure of the Web, no search engine or directory  indexes all of the content on the publicly indexable Web.  We  credit current estimates that no more than 50% of the content  currently on the publicly indexable Web has been indexed by "]]]
