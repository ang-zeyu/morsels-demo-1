And, besides, it was long odds that Thompson, the Sixth Form  master, would not have the notes, as he had dictated them partly out of  his head and partly from the works of various eminent scholars. The  second course was out of the question. The only other Sixth Form boy in  the House, Tony and Welch being away at Aldershot, was Charteris, and  Charteris, who never worked much except the night before an exam, but  worked then under forced draught, was appalled at the mere suggestion  of letting his note-book out of his hands. Jim had sounded him on the  subject and had met with the reply, 'Kill my father and burn my  ancestral home, and I will look on and smile. But touch these notes and  you rouse the British Lion.' After which he had given up the borrowing  idea.    There remained the third course, and there was an excitement and  sporting interest about it that took him immensely. But how was he to  get out to start with? He opened his study-window and calculated the  risks of a drop to the ground. No, it was too far. Not worth risking a  sprained ankle on the eve of the mile. Then he thought of the Matron's  sitting-room. This was on the ground-floor, and if its owner happened  to be out, exit would be easy. As luck would have it she was out, and  in another minute Jim had crossed the Rubicon and was standing on the  gravel drive which led to the front gate.    A sharp sprint took him to the Pavilion. Now the difficulty was not how  to get out, but how to get in. Theoretically, it should have been the  easiest of tasks, but in practice there were plenty of obstacles to  success. He tried the lower windows, but they were firmly fixed. There  had been a time when one of them would yield to a hard kick and fly  bodily out of its frame, but somebody had been caught playing that game  not long before, and Jim remembered with a pang that not only had the  window been securely fastened up, but the culprit had had a spell of  extra tuition and other punishments which had turned him for the time  into a hater of his species. His own fate, he knew, would be even  worse, for a prefect is supposed to have something better to do in his  spare time than breaking into pavilions. It would mean expulsion  perhaps, or, at the least, the loss of his prefect's cap, and Jim did  not want to lose that. Still the thing had to be done if he meant to  score any marks at all in the forthcoming exam. He wavered a while  between a choice of methods, and finally fixed on the crudest of all.  No one was likely to be within earshot, thought he, so he picked up the  largest stone he could find, took as careful aim as the dim light would  allow, and hove it. There was a sickening crash, loud enough, he  thought, to bring the whole School down on him, followed by a prolonged  rattle as the broken pieces of glass fell to the ground.    He held his breath and listened. For a moment all was still, uncannily  still. He could hear the tops of the trees groaning in the slight  breeze that had sprung up, and far away the distant roar of a train.  Then a queer thing happened. He heard a quiet thud, as if somebody had  jumped from a height on to grass, and then quick footsteps.    He waited breathless and rigid, expecting every moment to see a form  loom up beside him in the darkness. It was useless to run. His only  chance was to stay perfectly quiet.    Then it dawned upon him that the man was running away from him, not  towards him. His first impulse was to give chase, but prudence  restrained him. Catching burglars is an exhilarating sport, but it is  best to indulge in it when one is not on a burgling expedition oneself.    Besides he had come out to get his book, and business is business.    There was no time to be lost now, for someone might have heard one or  both of the noises and given the alarm.    Once the window was broken the rest was fairly easy, the only danger  being the pieces of glass. He took off his coat and flung it on to the  sill of the upper window. In a few seconds he was up himself without  injury. He found it a trifle hard to keep his balance, as there was  nothing to hold on to, but he managed it long enough to enable him to  thrust an arm through the gap and turn the handle. After this there was  a bolt to draw, which he managed without difficulty.    The window swung open. Jim jumped in, and groped his way round the room  till he found his book. The other window of the room was wide open. He  shut it for no definite reason, and noticed that a pane had been cut  out entire. The professional cracksman had done his work more neatly  than the amateur.    'Poor chap,' thought Jim, with a chuckle, as he effected a retreat, 'I  must have given him a bit of a start with my half-brick.' After bolting  the window behind him, he climbed down.    As he reached earth again the clock struck a quarter to nine. In  another quarter of an hour prep, would be over and the House door  unlocked, and he would be able to get in again. Nor would the fact of  his being out excite remark, for it was the custom of the  House-Prefects to take the air for the few minutes which elapsed  between the opening of the door and the final locking-up for the night.    The rest of his adventures ran too smoothly to require a detailed  description. Everything succeeded excellently. The only reminiscences  of his escapade were a few cuts in his coat, which went unnoticed, and  the precious book of notes, to which he applied himself with such  vigour in the watches of the night, with a surreptitious candle and a  hamper of apples as aids to study, that, though tired next day, he  managed to do quite well enough in the exam, to pass muster. And, as he  had never had the least prospect of coming out top, or even in the  first five, this satisfied him completely.    Tony listened with breathless interest to Jim's recital of his  adventures, and at the conclusion laughed.    'What a mad thing to go and do,' he said. 'Jolly sporting, though.'    Jim did not join in his laughter.    'Yes, but don't you see,' he said, ruefully, 'what a mess I'm in? If  they find out that I was in the Pav. at the time when the cups were  bagged, how on earth am I to prove I didn't take them myself?'    'By Jove, I never thought of that. But, hang it all, they'd never dream  of accusing a Coll. chap of stealing Sports prizes. This isn't a  reformatory for juvenile hooligans.'    'No, perhaps not.'    'Of course not.'    'Well, even if they didn't, the Old Man would be frightfully sick if he  got to know about it. I'd lose my prefect's cap for a cert.'    'You might, certainly.'    'I should. There wouldn't be any question about it. Why, don't you  remember that business last summer about Cairns? He used to stay out  after lock-up. That was absolutely all he did. Well, the Old 'Un  dropped on him like a hundredweight of bricks. Multiply that by about  ten and you get what he'll do to me if he books me over this job.'    Tony looked thoughtful. The case of Cairns _versus_ The Powers  that were, was too recent to have escaped his memory. Even now Cairns  was to be seen on the grounds with a common School House cap at the  back of his head in place of the prefect's cap which had once adorned  it.    'Yes,' he said, 'you'd lose your cap all right, I'm afraid.'    'Rather. And the sickening part of the business is that this real,  copper-bottomed burglary'll make them hunt about all over the shop for  clues and things, and the odds are they'll find me out, even if they  don't book the real man. Shouldn't wonder if they had a detective down  for a big thing of this sort.'    'They are having one, I heard.'    'There you are, then,' said Jim, dejectedly. 'I'm done, you see.'    'I don't know. I don't believe detectives are much class.'    'Anyhow, he'll probably have gumption enough to spot me.'    Jim's respect for the abilities of our national sleuth-hounds was  greater than Tony's, and a good deal greater than that of most people.          [5]    CONCERNING THE MUTUAL FRIEND      'I wonder where the dear Mutual gets to these afternoons,' said Dallas.    'The who?' asked MacArthur. MacArthur, commonly known as the Babe, was  a day boy. Dallas and Vaughan had invited him to tea in their study.    'Plunkett, you know.'    'Why the Mutual?'    'Mutual Friend, Vaughan's and mine. Shares this study with us. I call  him dear partly because he's head of the House, and therefore, of  course, we respect and admire him.'    'And partly,' put in Vaughan, beaming at the Babe over a frying-pan  full of sausages, 'partly because we love him so. Oh, he's a beauty.'    'No, but rotting apart,' said the Babe, 'what sort of a chap is he? I  hardly know him by sight, even.'    'Should describe him roughly,' said Dallas, 'as a hopeless, forsaken  unspeakable worm.'    'Understates it considerably,' remarked Vaughan. 'His manners are  patronizing, and his customs beastly.'    'He wears spectacles, and reads Herodotus in the original Greek for  pleasure.'    'He sneers at footer, and jeers at cricket. Croquet is his form, I  should say. Should doubt, though, if he even plays that.'    'But why on earth,' said the Babe, 'do you have him in your study?'    Vaughan looked wildly and speechlessly at Dallas, who looked helplessly  back at Vaughan.    'Don't, Babe, please!' said Dallas. 'You've no idea how a remark of  that sort infuriates us. You surely don't suppose we'd have the man in  the study if we could help it?'    'It's another instance of Ward at his worst,' said Vaughan. 'Have you  never heard the story of the Mutual Friend's arrival?'    'No.'    'It was like this. At the beginning of this term I came back expecting  to be head of this show. You see, Richards left at Christmas and I was  next man in. Dallas and I had made all sorts of arrangements for having  a good time. Well, I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6985"],[0,"A Prefect's Uncle (#5)"],[1,"takes me away after a couple of terms. I went to four private  schools before I started on the public schools. My pater took me away  from the first two because he thought the drains were bad, the third  because they wouldn't teach me shorthand, and the fourth because he  didn't like the headmaster's face. I worked off those schools in a year  and a half.' Having finished this piece of autobiography, he relapsed  into silence, leaving Gethryn to recollect various tales he had heard  of his grandfather's eccentricity. The silence lasted until the College  was reached, when the matron took charge of Farnie, and Gethryn went  off to tell Marriott of these strange happenings.    Marriott was amused, nor did he attempt to conceal the fact. When he  had finished laughing, which was not for some time, he favoured the  Bishop with a very sound piece of advice. 'If I were you,' he said, 'I  should try and hush this affair up. It's all fearfully funny, but I  think you'd enjoy life more if nobody knew this kid was your uncle. To  see the head of the House going about with a juvenile uncle in his wake  might amuse the chaps rather, and you might find it harder to keep  order; I won't let it out, and nobody else knows apparently. Go and  square the kid. Oh, I say though, what's his name? If it's Gethryn,  you're done. Unless you like to swear he's a cousin.'    'No; his name's Farnie, thank goodness.'    'That's all right then. Go and talk to him.'    Gethryn went to the junior study. Farnie was holding forth to a knot of  fags at one end of the room. His audience appeared to be amused at  something.    'I say, Farnie,' said the Bishop, 'half a second.'    Farnie came out, and Gethryn proceeded to inform him that, all things  considered, and proud as he was of the relationship, it was not  absolutely essential that he should tell everybody that he was his  uncle. In fact, it would be rather better on the whole if he did not.  Did he follow?    Farnie begged to observe that he did follow, but that, to his sorrow,  the warning came too late.    'I'm very sorry,' he said, 'I hadn't the least idea you wanted the  thing kept dark. How was I to know? I've just been telling it to some  of the chaps in there. Awfully decent chaps. They seemed to think it  rather funny. Anyhow, I'm not ashamed of the relationship. Not yet, at  any rate.'    For a moment Gethryn seemed about to speak. He looked fixedly at his  uncle as he stood framed in the doorway, a cheerful column of cool,  calm, concentrated cheek. Then, as if realizing that no words that he  knew could do justice to the situation, he raised his foot in silence,  and 'booted' his own flesh and blood with marked emphasis. After which  ceremony he went, still without a word, upstairs again.    As for Farnie, he returned to the junior day-room whistling 'Down  South' in a soft but cheerful key, and solidified his growing  popularity with doles of food from a hamper which he had brought with  him. Finally, on retiring to bed and being pressed by the rest of his  dormitory for a story, he embarked upon the history of a certain  Pollock and an individual referred to throughout as the Porroh Man, the  former of whom caused the latter to be decapitated, and was ever  afterwards haunted by his head, which appeared to him all day and every  day (not excepting Sundays and Bank Holidays) in an upside-down  position and wearing a horrible grin. In the end Pollock very sensibly  committed suicide (with ghastly details), and the dormitory thanked  Farnie in a subdued and chastened manner, and tried, with small  success, to go to sleep. In short, Farnie's first evening at Beckford  had been quite a triumph.          [4]    PRINGLE MAKES A SPORTING OFFER      Estimating it roughly, it takes a new boy at a public school about a  week to find his legs and shed his skin of newness. The period is, of  course, longer in the case of some and shorter in the case of others.  Both Farnie and Wilson had made themselves at home immediately. In the  case of the latter, directly the Skinner episode had been noised  abroad, and it was discovered in addition that he was a promising bat,  public opinion recognized that here was a youth out of the common run  of new boys, and the Lower Fourth--the form in which he had been placed  on arrival--took him to its bosom as an equal. Farnie's case was  exceptional. A career at Harrow, Clifton, and Wellington, however short  and abruptly terminated, gives one some sort of grip on the way public  school life is conducted. At an early date, moreover, he gave signs of  what almost amounted to genius in the Indoor Game department. Now,  success in the field is a good thing, and undoubtedly makes for  popularity. But if you desire to command the respect and admiration of  your fellow-beings to a degree stretched almost to the point of  idolatry, make yourself proficient in the art of whiling away the hours  of afternoon school. Before Farnie's arrival, his form, the Upper  Fourth, with the best intentions in the world, had not been skilful  'raggers'. They had ragged in an intermittent, once-a-week sort of way.  When, however, he came on the scene, he introduced a welcome element of  science into the sport. As witness the following. Mr Strudwick, the  regular master of the form, happened on one occasion to be away for a  couple of days, and a stop-gap was put in in his place. The name of the  stop-gap was Mr Somerville Smith. He and Farnie exchanged an unspoken  declaration of war almost immediately. The first round went in Mr  Smith's favour. He contrived to catch Farnie in the act of performing  some ingenious breach of the peace, and, it being a Wednesday and a  half-holiday, sent him into extra lesson. On the following morning,  more by design than accident, Farnie upset an inkpot. Mr Smith observed  icily that unless the stain was wiped away before the beginning of  afternoon school, there would be trouble. Farnie observed (to himself)  that there would be trouble in any case, for he had hit upon the  central idea for the most colossal 'rag' that, in his opinion, ever  was. After morning school he gathered the form around him, and  disclosed his idea. The floor of the form-room, he pointed out, was  some dozen inches below the level of the door. Would it not be a  pleasant and profitable notion, he asked, to flood the floor with water  to the depth of those dozen inches? On the wall outside the form-room  hung a row of buckets, placed there in case of fire, and the lavatory  was not too far off for practical purposes. Mr Smith had bidden him  wash the floor. It was obviously his duty to do so. The form thought so  too. For a solid hour, thirty weary but enthusiastic reprobates  laboured without ceasing, and by the time the bell rang all was  prepared. The floor was one still, silent pool. Two caps and a few  notebooks floated sluggishly on the surface, relieving the picture of  any tendency to monotony. The form crept silently to their places along  the desks. As Mr Smith's footsteps were heard approaching, they began  to beat vigorously upon the desks, with the result that Mr Smith,  quickening his pace, dashed into the form-room at a hard gallop. The  immediate results were absolutely satisfactory, and if matters  subsequently (when Mr Smith, having changed his clothes, returned with  the Headmaster) did get somewhat warm for the thirty criminals, they  had the satisfying feeling that their duty had been done, and a hearty  and unanimous vote of thanks was passed to Farnie. From which it will  be seen that Master Reginald Farnie was managing to extract more or  less enjoyment out of his life at Beckford.    Another person who was enjoying life was Pringle of the School House.  The keynote of Pringle's character was superiority. At an early period  of his life--he was still unable to speak at the time--his grandmother  had died. This is probably the sole reason why he had never taught that  relative to suck eggs. Had she lived, her education in that direction  must have been taken in hand. Baffled in this, Pringle had turned his  attention to the rest of the human race. He had a rooted conviction  that he did everything a shade better than anybody else. This belief  did not make him arrogant at all, and certainly not offensive, for he  was exceedingly popular in the School. But still there were people who  thought that he might occasionally draw the line somewhere. Watson, the  ground-man, for example, thought so when Pringle primed him with advice  on the subject of preparing a wicket. And Langdale, who had been  captain of the team five years before, had thought so most decidedly,  and had not hesitated to say so when Pringle, then in his first term  and aged twelve, had stood behind the First Eleven net and requested  him peremptorily to 'keep 'em down, sir, keep 'em down'. Indeed, the  great man had very nearly had a fit on that occasion, and was wont  afterwards to attribute to the effects of the shock so received a  sequence of three 'ducks' which befell him in the next three matches.    In short, in every department of life, Pringle's advice was always (and  generally unsought) at everybody's disposal. To round the position off  neatly, it would be necessary to picture him as a total failure in the  practical side of all the subjects in which he was so brilliant a  theorist. Strangely enough, however, this was not the case. There were  few better bats in the School than Pringle. Norris on his day was more  stylish, and Marriott not infrequently made more runs, but for  consistency Pringle was unrivalled.    That was partly the reason why at this time he was feeling pleased with  life. The School had played three matches up to date, and had won them  all. In the first, an Oxford college team, containing several Old  Beckfordians, had been met and routed, Pringle contributing thirty-one  to a total of three hundred odd. But Norris had made a century,"]]]
