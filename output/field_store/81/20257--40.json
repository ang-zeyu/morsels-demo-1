He had not gone a hundred  feet when he stopped suddenly before a heart-rending spectacle.    On a stone bench, near the monumental doorway of a wealthy residence,  sat a little girl six or seven years old, barely covered by a ragged  black gown. She had fallen asleep there in spite of the bitter cold,  her body bent forward in a pitiful posture of resigned exhaustion.  Her poor little head and her dainty shoulder had moulded themselves  into the angle of the freezing wall. One of her worn slippers had  fallen from her dangling foot and lay in the snow before her. Lucien  de Hem mechanically thrust his hand into his vest-pocket, but he  remembered that he had not even been able to fee the club waiter. He  went up to the child, however, impelled by an instinct of pity. He  meant, no doubt, to pick her up and take her home with him, to give  her shelter for the night, when suddenly he saw something glitter in  the little slipper at his feet. He stooped. It was a louis-d'or.    Some charitable soul--a woman, no doubt--had passed there, and at  the pathetic sight of that little shoe in the snow had remembered  the poetic Christmas legend, and with discreet fingers had dropped a  splendid gift, so that the forsaken little one might still believe in  the presents of the Child-Christ, and might awake with renewed faith  in the midst of her misery.    A gold louis! That meant many days of rest and comfort for the little  beggar. Lucien was just about to awaken her and surprise her with  her good fortune when, in a strange hallucination, he heard a voice  in his ear, which whispered with the drawling inflection of the old  Pole: \"I haven't stirred from this place for two days, and for two  whole days seventeen hasn't come out once. I'll bet you my fist that  when the clock strikes twelve, seventeen will be the winning number.\"    Then this youth, who was twenty-three years of age, the descendant  of a race of honest men,--this youth who bore a great military name,  and had never been guilty of an unmanly act,--conceived a monstrous  thought; an insane desire took possession of him. He looked anxiously  up and down the street, and having assured himself that he had  no witness, he knelt, and reaching out cautiously with trembling  fingers, stole the treasure from the little shoe, then rose with a  spring and ran breathlessly down the street. He rushed like a madman  up the stairs of the gambling-house, flung open the door with his  fist, and burst into the room at the first stroke of midnight. He  threw the gold-piece on the table and cried,--    \"Seventeen!\"    Seventeen won. He then pushed the whole pile on the \"red.\" The red  won. He left the seventy-two louis on the same color. The red came  out again. He doubled the stakes, twice, three times, and always with  the same success. Before him was a huge pile of gold and bank-notes.  He tried the \"twelve,\" the \"column,\"--he worked every combination.  His luck was something unheard of, something almost supernatural. One  might have believed that the little ivory ball, in its frenzied dance  around the table, had been bewitched, magnetized by this feverish  gambler, and obeyed his will. With a few bold strokes he had won back  the bundle of bank-notes which he had lost in the early part of the  evening. Then he staked two and three hundred louis at a time, and  as his fantastic luck never failed him, he soon won back the whole  capital that had constituted his inherited fortune.    In his haste to begin the game he had not even thought of taking off  his fur-lined coat, the great pockets of which were now swollen with  the rolls of bank-notes, and heavy with the weight of the gold. Not  knowing where to put the money that was steadily accumulating before  him, he stuffed it away in the inside and outside pockets of his  coat, his vest, his trousers, in his cigar-case, his handkerchief.  Everything became a recipient. And still he played and still he won,  his brain whirling the while like that of a drunkard or a madman. It  was amazing to see him stand there throwing gold on the table by the  handful, with that haughty gesture of absolute certainty and disdain.  But withal there was a gnawing at his heart, something that felt like  a red-hot iron there, and he could not rid himself of the vision of  the child asleep in the snow,--the child whom he had robbed.    \"In just a few minutes,\" said he, \"I will go back to her. She must  be there in the same place. Of course she must be there. It is no  crime, after all. I will make it right to her,--it will be no crime.  Quite the contrary. I will leave here in a few moments, when the  clock strikes again, I swear it. Just as soon as the clock strikes  again I will stop, I will go straight to where she is, I will take  her up in my arms and will carry her home with me asleep. I have done  her no harm; I have made a fortune for her. I will keep her with me  and educate her; I will love her as I would a child of my own, and I  will take care of her,--always, as long as she lives!\"    But the clock struck one, a quarter past, half-past, and Lucien was  still there. Finally, a few minutes before two the man opposite him  rose brusquely and said in a loud voice,--    \"The bank is broken, gentlemen; this will do for to-night.\"    Lucien started, and wedging his way brutally through the group of  gamblers, who pressed around him in envious admiration, hurried out  into the street and ran as fast as he could toward the stone bench.  In a moment he saw by the light of the gas that the child was still  there.    \"God be praised!\" said he, and his heart gave a great throb of joy.  Yes, here she was! He took her little hand in his. Poor little  hand, how cold it was! He caught her under the arms and lifted her.  Her head fell back, but she did not awake. \"The happy sleep of  childhood!\" thought he. He pressed her close to his breast to warm  her, and with a vague presentiment he tried to rouse her from this  heavy sleep by kissing her eyelids. But he realized then with horror  that through the child's half-open lids her eyes were dull, glassy,  fixed. A distracting suspicion flashed through his mind. He put his  lips to the child's mouth; he felt no breath.    While Lucien had been building a fortune with the louis stolen from  this little one, she, homeless and forsaken, had perished with cold.    Lucien felt a suffocating knot at his throat. In his anguish he  tried to cry out; and in the effort which he made he awoke from  his nightmare, and found himself on the leather lounge in the  gambling-room, where he had fallen asleep a little before midnight.  The _garçon_ of the den had gone home at about five o'clock, and out  of pity had not wakened him.    A misty December dawn made the window-panes pale. Lucien went out,  pawned his watch, took a bath, then went over to the Bureau of  Recruits, and enlisted as a volunteer in the First Regiment of the  Chasseurs d'Afrique.    Lucien de Hem is now a lieutenant. He has not a cent in the world but  his pay. He manages to make that do, however, for he is a steady  officer, and never touches a card. He even contrives to economize, it  would seem; for a few days ago a comrade, who was following him up  one of the steep streets of the Kasba, saw him stop to lay a piece  of money in the lap of a little Spanish girl who had fallen asleep  in a doorway. His comrade was startled at the poor lieutenant's  generosity, for this piece of money was a gold louis.    [Illustration]          A CHRISTMAS SUPPER IN THE MARAIS.    From the French of ALPHONSE DAUDET.      M. Majesté, a seltzer-water manufacturer of the Marais, has just  indulged in a little Christmas supper with a few friends of the Place  Royale, and walks home humming. The clock at St. Paul's strikes two.  \"How late it is!\" thinks the good man as he hurries along. But the  pavement is slippery, the streets are dark, and then, in this devil  of an old neighborhood which belongs to the time when carriages were  scarce, there are the greatest number of turns, corners, steps, and  posts in front of the houses for the accommodation of horsemen, all  of which are calculated to impede a man's progress, particularly when  his legs are heavy and his sight somewhat blurred by the toasts of  the Christmas supper. M. Majesté reaches his destination at last,  however. He stops before a great doorway above which gleams in the  moonlight the freshly gilded coat-of-arms, the recently retouched  armorial-bearings which he has converted into a trade-mark.                                   Former                            Hôtel de Nesmond.                              MAJESTÉ, JR.,                       Seltzer-water Manufacturer.    The old Nesmond coat-of-arms stands out, resplendent, on all the  siphons of the factory, on all the memoranda and letter-heads.    The doorway leads directly to the court,--a large, sunny court which  floods the narrow street with light even at noon, when the portals  are thrown open. Far back in this court stands a great and ancient  structure,--blackened walls covered with lace-work and embroideries  of stone, bulging iron balconies, stone balconies with pilasters,  great high windows crowned with pediments, and capitals rearing  their heads along the upper stories like so many little roofs within  the roof, then above it all, set in the very slate, the mansard  dormer-windows, like the round mirrors of a boudoir, daintily framed  with garlands. From the court to the first story rises a great stone  stairway gnawed and worn green by the rains. A meagre vine dangles  along the wall, lifeless and black like the rope that swings from  the pulley in the attic; and the whole has an indescribable air of  sad grandeur and decay.    This is the ancient Hôtel de Nesmond. In the broad light of day it  has quite a different aspect.

CHAPTER III.    THE RENCONTRE.      THE quaint old cathedral town of A---- is some twenty-five miles from  Carrington, and often an excursion-point to the inhabitants of the  latter, as an excellent hotel rendered them tolerably secure of a good  dinner. I had often threatened a sketching visit to it, which bad  weather, and a strict routine of duty, in consequence of the expected  disturbances, had hitherto prevented my fulfilling. It was, therefore,  with no common alacrity I started on my expedition, armed with a  large sketch book, which bid defiance to the suspicion of my brother  officers. The weather though gloomy was no longer wet, and a walk of  about half a mile brought me from the railway to the walls of the  old city. Rough, red, and weather beaten, they, at the first glance,  showed many a point equally available to a draughtsman or an enemy.  Once considered almost impregnable, they are now chiefly valued as a  dry and pleasant promenade for the citizens. I am no great antiquarian,  but I believe those splendid old Romans, who have supplied all Europe  with interesting relics, are accountable for the original foundation of  A----. Various princes and potentates have added their endeavours, and  at present it is, perhaps, the most picturesque old town in England.    At each step I took, some delicious carved gable or galleried front,  overhung the street, mingled with modernised shops, it is true; yet  as a whole, charming to my eye, of late accustomed only to the  unmitigated squareness of modern brick and modern iron, accompanied,  as they are at Carrington, by all the abominations of _soi disant_  civilisation without one of its beauties.    Over all rose with a grave paternal air the Abbey towers, which seemed  to infect the atmosphere of the place with a calm ecclesiastical repose  well suited to its aspect; these general views I took in while pursuing  my way towards the principal hotel, where I intended to put up more as  an excuse for pushing my enquiries than for any other reason. During  my way thither, diverted by the various sketchable points I constantly  passed, the immense difficulties of my search did not so strikingly  present themselves, till, entering the hotel I called for the landlord  and the _carté_, and endeavoured to describe the man with the seals  as a most agreeable individual whose acquaintance I wished to renew,  but could only remember the first letter of his name; mine host was  impenetrable, he knew many who answered to my description; but none  I was likely to have met: there was Wilkins, the first butcher in the  city; Wiggins, the tobacconist; Dr. Worthington, a highly respectable  chemist; Mr. White, the methodist parson? No, no, it could be none of  these. What! my beautiful incognita under the chaperonage of a butcher,  a tobacconist, or a chemist. The landlord was departing, when a sudden  spasm of memory seemed to seize him, \"Could it be Winter? There was  a very pleasant gentleman of that name lived in the Abbey garden; he  painted pictures, grand pictures, and had a nice farm in right of his  wife?\" \"Was he a gentleman?\" \"Oh yes, he used often to dine at the  Dean's, and sometimes with the Bishop. Mr. Winter was thought a deal  of?\"    \"Perhaps Winter was the name; well I will try. Let me have dinner at  six, and now for the Abbey.\"    I spent two or three hours very agreeably in exploring the aisles and  passages and beautiful choir of this irregular but impressive old  pile, feeling the deep effect which may be produced by the simple  sense of weight and size. The Town Hall, quaint enough, a subterranean  chapel, the remains of the castle and a Roman bath, made up the sum of  sight seeing, and still I pondered on the chances of \"Winter\" turning  out to be the veritable \"man with the seals.\" I walked on the walls and  saw Prince Rupert's and King Charles' towers, and finally asked my way  to the Abbey garden; it was a good sized square, near the Cathedral,  full of substantial houses, and walking round I saw the name of J.  Winter on the hall door of one of them. Should I knock? No, for that  beautiful girl was not their daughter; indeed she seemed to exercise  more authority over them than they over her, and I should only land  myself in a scrape, perhaps lose by precipitancy. \"No, I will not  knock, but like the sage captain in 'Ali Baba or the Forty Thieves,' I  will mark the house, and next week being off duty, take up my abode,  sketch book, and all in the old city for a few days; and 'the Devil's  in the dice,' as poor O'Brien of the 88th used to say, if I do not  make the plump little artist's acquaintance before they are over.\" Thus  resolving, I again turned to the walls, which here approached a river  sufficiently broad and winding for beauty, though not for grandeur.  This was the only side at which the town appeared to overflow the  limits of its walls; but here a straggling and inconsiderable suburb  stretched for a short distance, and even one unusually large church,  with a lofty detached tower, seemed to have burst bounds and sought the  vicinity of the river, towards which the ground sloped rather abruptly,  and was altogether lower than that within the walls, from which a  flight of rude steps led to the road beneath. A few remarkably fine old  trees, a broken rocky red bank, scarcely high enough to be dignified  with the name of cliff, at the other side of the river, with undulating  meadows, and a distant line of blue hills beyond, made up a scene of  much unpretending beauty. I gazed at it long with quiet pleasure,  anticipating my _séjour_ among its attractions, and trying to persuade  myself I had much better give up the pursuit I had embarked in with  such ardour. \"One throw more,\" said I half aloud, \"and if this Winter  does not turn out to be my man of the seals, I'll give it up; though by  all the saints that adorn that old gateway, it would be for the good  of my soul to see those eyes and hear that voice again; but pshaw!  I've been in love before and found it not insurmountable, and now I  am not in love, only curious.\" And with this wise conclusion I ate my  dinner and returned to Carrington, where I was met by Burton's rather  anxious, \"Well, what success?\" \"Why, not much, but I'am going over next  week.\"--He smiled.    A few days after, I fulfilled my intention, and installed myself and  a formidable array of sketching materials at the Royal; and about  noon the following day sallied forth to revisit the walls where they  command the view which had so much pleased me. Proceeding leisurely  along the thinly peopled streets, my eye was caught by a figure in  strong contrast to all that had hitherto passed me; it was that of an  old gentleman, tall, erect, and still vigorous; the greatest symptom of  his age being the perfect whiteness of the profuse hair which curled,  or rather waved, under his hat; the old fashioned buff waistcoat, blue  coat, and gilt buttons, together with his colored cravat and frilled  shirt, had an air of perfect freshness, making a _tout ensemble_  thorough-bred and remarkable. An expression of easy benevolence sat on  his aquiline and aristocratic features, and his bright blue eyes had  an eagle look, not unmingled with humour. While I gazed unobservedly,  for he was at the opposite side of the street, the countenance grew  strangely familiar to me, and in a moment a curtain seemed, as it were,  raised from my memory, and scenes in which we had both been actors  stood before me with all the startling vividness that sometimes invests  circumstances which the rush of life jostle for a while into hidden  nooks of memory, where they are preserved, as it were, by darkness,  from loss of their pristine colors.    Some ten years before, a raw stripling, I joined my regiment, when  quartered in a singularly remote and beautiful district in the west  of Ireland, where still, though much diminished, some remnants of the  old national custom of duelling remained, chiefly among the inferior  gentry. At a large gathering of the magnates and smaller fry too, some  anniversary dinner, it was my ill-fate to get into an absurd dispute,  which a little manly self-command would have soon concluded, but  which the impetuosity and inexperience of boyhood rapidly fanned into  a promising quarrel; my antagonist, a man sufficiently qualified by  birth to associate with gentlemen, had not as yet by character quite  forfeited the claim, so that affairs soon wore an unpleasant aspect.  With heightened complexion and quickening pulse, stung by his insolent  assumption of superior experience, I was imperiously reiterating some  not very amiable opinion; when a gentleman of striking appearance  begged, with polished courtesy, to know the subject in dispute, a  mere trifle, the folly of which struck me as I explained it; then in  few words, and with the consummate tact of a man of feeling, as well  as of the world, backed by a tone of kindly authority his dignified  appearance fully warranted, he stilled our dispute without one scratch  to the _amour propre_ of either party. Presenting himself as Colonel  D'Arcy Vernon, he begged to have the pleasure of knowing me, adding,  with "]]]
