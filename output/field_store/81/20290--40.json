The great Ak has spoken to us of you.  There  is better work for you in life than to labor for food, and though, not  being of the Forest, Ak has no command over us, nevertheless are we  glad to favor one he loves.  Live, therefore, to do the good work you  are resolved to undertake.  We, the Field Ryls, will attend to your  food supplies.\"    After this speech the Ryls were no longer to be seen, and Claus drove  from his mind the thought of tilling the earth.    When next he wandered back to his dwelling a bowl of fresh milk stood  upon the table; bread was in the cupboard and sweet honey filled a dish  beside it.  A pretty basket of rosy apples and new-plucked grapes was  also awaiting him.  He called out \"Thanks, my friends!\" to the  invisible Ryls, and straightway began to eat of the food.    Thereafter, when hungry, he had but to look into the cupboard to find  goodly supplies brought by the kindly Ryls.  And the Knooks cut and  stacked much wood for his fireplace.  And the Fairies brought him warm  blankets and clothing.    So began his life in the Laughing Valley, with the favor and friendship  of the immortals to minister to his every want.        2.  How Claus Made the First Toy    Truly our Claus had wisdom, for his good fortune but strengthened his  resolve to befriend the little ones of his own race.  He knew his plan  was approved by the immortals, else they would not have favored him so  greatly.    So he began at once to make acquaintance with mankind.  He walked  through the Valley to the plain beyond, and crossed the plain in many  directions to reach the abodes of men.  These stood singly or in groups  of dwellings called villages, and in nearly all the houses, whether big  or little, Claus found children.    The youngsters soon came to know his merry, laughing face and the kind  glance of his bright eyes; and the parents, while they regarded the  young man with some scorn for loving children more than their elders,  were content that the girls and boys had found a playfellow who seemed  willing to amuse them.    So the children romped and played games with Claus, and the boys rode  upon his shoulders, and the girls nestled in his strong arms, and the  babies clung fondly to his knees.  Wherever the young man chanced to  be, the sound of childish laughter followed him; and to understand this  better you must know that children were much neglected in those days  and received little attention from their parents, so that it became to  them a marvel that so goodly a man as Claus devoted his time to making  them happy.  And those who knew him were, you may be sure, very happy  indeed.  The sad faces of the poor and abused grew bright for once; the  cripple smiled despite his misfortune; the ailing ones hushed their  moans and the grieved ones their cries when their merry friend came  nigh to comfort them.    Only at the beautiful palace of the Lord of Lerd and at the frowning  castle of the Baron Braun was Claus refused admittance.  There were  children at both places; but the servants at the palace shut the door  in the young stranger's face, and the fierce Baron threatened to hang  him from an iron hook on the castle walls.  Whereupon Claus sighed and  went back to the poorer dwellings where he was welcome.    After a time the winter drew near.    The flowers lived out their lives and faded and disappeared; the  beetles burrowed far into the warm earth; the butterflies deserted the  meadows; and the voice of the brook grew hoarse, as if it had taken  cold.    One day snowflakes filled all the air in the Laughing Valley, dancing  boisterously toward the earth and clothing in pure white raiment the  roof of Claus's dwelling.    At night Jack Frost rapped at the door.    \"Come in!\" cried Claus.    \"Come out!\" answered Jack, \"for you have a fire inside.\"    So Claus came out.  He had known Jack Frost in the Forest, and liked  the jolly rogue, even while he mistrusted him.    \"There will be rare sport for me to-night, Claus!\" shouted the sprite.  \"Isn't this glorious weather?  I shall nip scores of noses and ears and  toes before daybreak.\"    \"If you love me, Jack, spare the children,\" begged Claus.    \"And why?\" asked the other, in surprise.    \"They are tender and helpless,\" answered Claus.    \"But I love to nip the tender ones!\" declared Jack.  \"The older ones  are tough, and tire my fingers.\"    \"The young ones are weak, and can not fight you,\" said Claus.    \"True,\" agreed Jack, thoughtfully.  \"Well, I will not pinch a child  this night--if I can resist the temptation,\" he promised.  \"Good night,  Claus!\"    \"Good night.\"    The young man went in and closed the door, and Jack Frost ran on to the  nearest village.    Claus threw a log on the fire, which burned up brightly.  Beside the  hearth sat Blinkie, a big cat give him by Peter the Knook.  Her fur was  soft and glossy, and she purred never-ending songs of contentment.    \"I shall not see the children again soon,\" said Claus to the cat, who  kindly paused in her song to listen.  \"The winter is upon us, the snow  will be deep for many days, and I shall be unable to play with my  little friends.\"    The cat raised a paw and stroked her nose thoughtfully, but made no  reply.  So long as the fire burned and Claus sat in his easy chair by  the hearth she did not mind the weather.    So passed many days and many long evenings.  The cupboard was always  full, but Claus became weary with having nothing to do more than to  feed the fire from the big wood-pile the Knooks had brought him.    One evening he picked up a stick of wood and began to cut it with his  sharp knife.  He had no thought, at first, except to occupy his time,  and he whistled and sang to the cat as he carved away portions of the  stick.  Puss sat up on her haunches and watched him, listening at the  same time to her master's merry whistle, which she loved to hear even  more than her own purring songs.    Claus glanced at puss and then at the stick he was whittling, until  presently the wood began to have a shape, and the shape was like the  head of a cat, with two ears sticking upward.    Claus stopped whistling to laugh, and then both he and the cat looked  at the wooden image in some surprise.  Then he carved out the eyes and  the nose, and rounded the lower part of the head so that it rested upon  a neck.    Puss hardly knew what to make of it now, and sat up stiffly, as if  watching with some suspicion what would come next.    Claus knew.  The head gave him an idea.  He plied his knife carefully  and with skill, forming slowly the body of the cat, which he made to  sit upon its haunches as the real cat did, with her tail wound around  her two front legs.    The work cost him much time, but the evening was long and he had  nothing better to do.  Finally he gave a loud and delighted laugh at  the result of his labors and placed the wooden cat, now completed, upon  the hearth opposite the real one.    Puss thereupon glared at her image, raised her hair in anger, and  uttered a defiant mew.  The wooden cat paid no attention, and Claus,  much amused, laughed again.    Then Blinkie advanced toward the wooden image to eye it closely and  smell of it intelligently:  Eyes and nose told her the creature was  wood, in spite of its natural appearance; so puss resumed her seat and  her purring, but as she neatly washed her face with her padded paw she  cast more than one admiring glance at her clever master.  Perhaps she  felt the same satisfaction we feel when we look upon good photographs  of ourselves.    The cat's master was himself pleased with his handiwork, without  knowing exactly why.  Indeed, he had great cause to congratulate  himself that night, and all the children throughout the world should  have joined him rejoicing.  For Claus had made his first toy.        3.  How the Ryls Colored the Toys    A hush lay on the Laughing Valley now.  Snow covered it like a white  spread and pillows of downy flakes drifted before the dwelling where  Claus sat feeding the blaze of the fire.  The brook gurgled on beneath  a heavy sheet of ice and all living plants and insects nestled close to  Mother Earth to keep warm.  The face of the moon was hid by dark  clouds, and the wind, delighting in the wintry sport, pushed and  whirled the snowflakes in so many directions that they could get no  chance to fall to the ground.    Claus heard the wind whistling and shrieking in its play and thanked  the good Knooks again for his comfortable shelter.  Blinkie washed her  face lazily and stared at the coals with a look of perfect content.  The toy cat sat opposite the real one and gazed straight ahead, as toy  cats should.    Suddenly Claus heard a noise that sounded different from the voice of  the wind.  It was more like a wail of suffering and despair.    He stood up and listened, but the wind, growing boisterous, shook the  door and rattled the windows to distract his attention.  He waited  until the wind was tired and then, still listening, he heard once more  the shrill cry of distress.    Quickly he drew on his coat, pulled his cap over his eyes and opened  the door.  The wind dashed in and scattered the embers over the hearth,  at the same time blowing Blinkie's fur so furiously that she crept  under the table to escape.  Then the door was closed and Claus was  outside, peering anxiously into the darkness.    The wind laughed and scolded and tried to push him over, but he stood  firm.  The helpless flakes stumbled against his eyes and dimmed his  sight, but he rubbed them away and looked again.  Snow was everywhere,  white and glittering.  It covered the earth and filled the air.    The cry was not repeated.    Claus turned to go back into the house, but the wind "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5201"],[0,"Don Juan Tenorio (#5)"],[1,"sois don Luis Mejía.    Then you are Don Luis Mejía.

Y, pues, sobre Italia luego             And so, now to Italy  buscando a sangre y a fuego             for blood and fire, fuelling  amores y desafíos.                      love affairs and duelling.
