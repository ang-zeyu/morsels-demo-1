Reader, canst thou not be induced to dedicate a few months to the good  of the public, and examine with thy scientific eye the productions  which the vast and well-stored colony of Demerara presents to thee?    What an immense range of forest is there from the rock Saba to the  great fall! and what an uninterrupted extent before thee from it to the  banks of the Essequibo! No doubt there is many a balsam and many a  medicinal root yet to be discovered, and many a resin, gum and oil yet  unnoticed. Thy work would be a pleasing one, and thou mightest make  several useful observations in it.    Would it be thought impertinent in thee to hazard a conjecture that,  with the resources the Government of Demerara has, stones might be  conveyed from the rock Saba to Stabroek to stem the equinoctial tides  which are for ever sweeping away the expensive wooden piles round the  mounds of the fort? Or would the timber-merchant point at thee in  passing by and call thee a descendant of La Mancha's knight, because  thou maintainest that the stones which form the rapids might be removed  with little expense, and thus open the navigation to the wood-cutter  from Stabroek to the great fall? Or wouldst thou be deemed enthusiastic  or biassed because thou givest it as thy opinion that the climate in  these high-lands is exceedingly wholesome, and the lands themselves  capable of nourishing and maintaining any number of settlers? In thy  dissertation on the Indians thou mightest hint that possibly they could  be induced to help the new settlers a little; and that, finding their  labours well requited, it would be the means of their keeping up a  constant communication with us which probably might be the means of  laying the first stone towards their Christianity. They are a poor  harmless, inoffensive set of people, and their wandering and  ill-provided way of living seems more to ask for pity from us than to  fill our heads with thoughts that they would be hostile to us.    What a noble field, kind reader, for thy experimental philosophy and  speculations, for thy learning, for thy perseverance, for thy  kindheartedness, for everything that is great and good within thee!    The accidental traveller who has journeyed on from Stabroek to the rock  Saba, and from thence to the banks of the Essequibo, in pursuit of  other things, as he told thee at the beginning, with but an indifferent  interpreter to talk to, no friend to converse with, and totally unfit  for that which he wishes thee to do, can merely mark the outlines of  the path he has trodden, or tell thee the sounds he has heard, or  faintly describe what he has seen in the environs of his  resting-places; but if this be enough to induce thee to undertake the  journey, and give the world a description of it, he will be amply  satisfied.    It will be two days and a half from the time of entering the path on  the western bank of the Demerara till all be ready and the canoe fairly  afloat on the Essequibo. The new rigging it, and putting every little  thing to rights and in its proper place, cannot well be done in less  than a day.    After being night and day in the forest, impervious to the sun's and  moon's rays, the sudden transition to light has a fine heart-cheering  effect. Welcome as a lost friend, the solar beam makes the frame  rejoice, and with it a thousand enlivening thoughts rush at once on the  soul and disperse, as a vapour, every sad and sorrowful idea which the  deep gloom had helped to collect there. In coming out of the woods you  see the western bank of the Essequibo before you, low and flat. Here  the river is two-thirds as broad as the Demerara at Stabroek.    To the northward there is a hill higher than any in the Demerara; and  in the south-south-west quarter a mountain. It is far away, and appears  like a bluish cloud in the horizon. There is not the least opening on  either side. Hills, valleys and low-lands are all linked together by a  chain of forest. Ascend the highest mountain, climb the loftiest tree,  as far as the eye can extend, whichever way it directs itself, all is  luxuriant and unbroken forest.    In about nine or ten hours from this you get to an Indian habitation of  three huts, on the point of an island. It is said that a Dutch post  once stood here. But there is not the smallest vestige of it remaining  and, except that the trees appear younger than those on the other  islands, which shows that the place has been cleared some time or  other, there is no mark left by which you can conjecture that ever this  was a post.    The many islands which you meet with in the way enliven and change the  scene, by the avenues which they make, which look like the mouths of  other rivers, and break that long-extended sameness which is seen in  the Demerara.    Proceeding onwards you get to the falls and rapids. In the rainy season  they are very tedious to pass, and often stop your course. In the dry  season, by stepping from rock to rock, the Indians soon manage to get a  canoe over them. But when the river is swollen, as it was in May 1812,  it is then a difficult task, and often a dangerous one, too. At that  time many of the islands were over-flowed, the rocks covered and the  lower branches of the trees in the water. Sometimes the Indians were  obliged to take everything out of the canoe, cut a passage through the  branches which hung over into the river, and then drag up the canoe by  main force.    At one place the falls form an oblique line quite across the river  impassable to the ascending canoe, and you are forced to have it  dragged four or five hundred yards by land.    It will take you five days, from the Indian habitation on the point of  the island, to where these falls and rapids terminate.    There are no huts in the way. You must bring your own cassava bread  along with you, hunt in the forest for your meat and make the night's  shelter for yourself.    Here is a noble range of hills, all covered with the finest trees  rising majestically one above the other, on the western bank, and  presenting as rich a scene as ever the eye would wish to look on.  Nothing in vegetable nature can be conceived more charming, grand and  luxuriant.    How the heart rejoices in viewing this beautiful landscape when the sky  is serene, the air cool and the sun just sunk behind the mountain's top!    The hayawa-tree perfumes the woods around: pairs of scarlet aras are  continually crossing the river. The maam sends forth its plaintive  note, the wren chants its evening song. The caprimulgus wheels in busy  flight around the canoe, while \"Whip-poor-will\" sits on the broken  stump near the water's edge, complaining as the shades of night set in.    A little before you pass the last of these rapids two immense rocks  appear, nearly on the summit of one of the many hills which form this  far-extending range where it begins to fall off gradually to the south.    They look like two ancient stately towers of some Gothic potentate  rearing their heads above the surrounding trees. What with their  situation and their shape together, they strike the beholder with an  idea of antiquated grandeur which he will never forget. He may travel  far and near and see nothing like them. On looking at them through a  glass the summit of the southern one appeared crowned with bushes. The  one to the north was quite bare. The Indians have it from their  ancestors that they are the abode of an evil genius, and they pass in  the river below with a reverential awe.    In about seven hours from these stupendous sons of the hill you leave  the Essequibo and enter the River Apoura-poura, which falls into it  from the south. The Apoura-poura is nearly one-third the size of the  Demerara at Stabroek. For two days you see nothing but level ground  richly clothed in timber. You leave the Siparouni to the right hand,  and on the third day come to a little hill. The Indians have cleared  about an acre of ground on it and erected a temporary shed. If it be  not intended for provision-ground alone, perhaps the next white man who  travels through these remote wilds will find an Indian settlement here.    Two days after leaving this you get to a rising ground on the western  bank where stands a single hut, and about half a mile in the forest  there are a few more: some of them square and some round, with spiral  roofs.    Here the fish called pacou is very plentiful: it is perhaps the fattest  and most delicious fish in Guiana. It does not take the hook, but the  Indians decoy it to the surface of the water by means of the seeds of  the crab-wood tree and then shoot it with an arrow.    You are now within the borders of Macoushia, inhabited by a different  tribe of people called Macoushi Indians, uncommonly dexterous in the  use of the blow-pipe and famous for their skill in preparing the deadly  vegetable-poison commonly called wourali.    It is from this country that those beautiful paroquets named  kessi-kessi are procured. Here the crystal mountains are found; and  here the three different species of the ara are seen in great  abundance. Here too grows the tree from which the gum-elastic is got:  it is large and as tall as any in the forest. The wood has much the  appearance of sycamore. The gum is contained in the bark: when that is  cut through it oozes out very freely; it is quite white and looks as  rich as cream; it hardens almost immediately as it issues from the  tree, so that it is very easy to collect a ball by forming the juice  into a globular shape as fast as it comes out.

[3]    (4) The orientation of Egyptian temples and Druidical stones is such  that possibly they were so placed as to assist in the observation of  the heliacal risings [4] of certain stars. If the star were known,  this would give an approximate date. Up to the present the results of  these investigations are far from being conclusive.    Ptolemy (130 A.D.) wrote the Suntaxis, or Almagest, which includes a  cyclopedia of astronomy, containing a summary of knowledge at that  date. We have no evidence beyond his own statement that he was a  practical observer. He theorised on the planetary motions, and held  that the earth is fixed in the centre of the universe. He adopted the  excentric and equant of Hipparchus to explain the unequal motions of  the sun and moon. He adopted the epicycles and deferents which had  been used by Apollonius and others to explain the retrograde motions  of the planets. We, who know that the earth revolves round the sun  once in a year, can understand that the apparent motion of a planet is  only its motion relative to the earth. If, then, we suppose the earth  fixed and the sun to revolve round it once a year, and the planets  each in its own period, it is only necessary to impose upon each of  these an additional _annual_ motion to enable us to represent truly  the apparent motions. This way of looking at the apparent motions  shows why each planet, when nearest to the earth, seems to move for a  time in a retrograde direction. The attempts of Ptolemy and others of  his time to explain the retrograde motion in this way were only  approximate. Let us suppose each planet to have a bar with one end  centred at the earth.  If at the other end of the bar one end of a  shorter bar is pivotted, having the planet at its other end, then the  planet is given an annual motion in the secondary circle (the  epicycle), whose centre revolves round the earth on the primary circle  (the _deferent_), at a uniform rate round the excentric. Ptolemy  supposed the centres of the epicycles of Mercury and Venus to be on a  bar passing through the sun, and to be between the earth and the  sun. The centres of the epicycles of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn were  supposed to be further away than the sun.  Mercury and Venus were  supposed to revolve in their epicycles in their own periodic times and  in the deferent round the earth in a year. The major planets were  supposed to revolve in the deferent round the earth in their own  periodic times, and in their epicycles once in a year.    It did not occur to Ptolemy to place the centres of the epicycles of  Mercury and Venus at the sun, and to extend the same system to the  major planets. Something of this sort had been proposed by the  Egyptians (we are told by Cicero and others), and was accepted by  Tycho Brahe; and was as true a representation of the relative motions  in the solar system as when we suppose the sun to be fixed and the  earth to revolve.    The cumbrous system advocated by Ptolemy answered its purpose,  enabling him to predict astronomical events approximately. He improved  the lunar theory considerably, and discovered minor inequalities which  could be allowed for by the addition of new epicycles.  We may look  upon these epicycles of Apollonius, and the excentric of Hipparchus,  as the responses of these astronomers to the demand of Plato for  uniform circular motions. Their use became more and more confirmed,  until the seventeenth century, when the accurate observations of Tycho  Brahe enabled Kepler to abolish these purely geometrical makeshifts,  and to substitute a system in which the sun became physically its  controller.

After Ptolemy had published his book there seemed to be nothing more  to do for the solar system except to go on observing and finding more  and more accurate values for the constants involved--viz., the periods  of revolution, the diameter of the deferent,[1] and its ratio to that  of the epicycle,[2] the distance of the excentric[3] from the centre  of the deferent, and the position of the line of apses,[4] besides the  inclination and position of the plane of the planet's orbit. The only  object ever aimed at in those days was to prepare tables for  predicting the places of the planets. It was not a mechanical problem;  there was no notion of a governing law of forces.    From this time onwards all interest in astronomy seemed, in Europe at  least, to sink to a low ebb.  When the Caliph Omar, in the middle of  the seventh century, burnt the library of Alexandria, which had been  the centre of intellectual progress, that centre migrated to Baghdad,  and the Arabs became the leaders of science and philosophy. In  astronomy they made careful observations. In the middle of the ninth  century Albategnius, a Syrian prince, improved the value of  excentricity of the sun's orbit, observed the motion of the moon's  apse, and thought he detected a smaller progression of the sun's  apse. His tables were much more accurate than Ptolemy's. Abul Wefa, in  the tenth century, seems to have discovered the moon's \"variation.\"  Meanwhile the Moors were leaders of science in the west, and Arzachel  of Toledo improved the solar tables very much. Ulugh Begh, grandson of  the great Tamerlane the Tartar, built a fine observatory at Samarcand  in the fifteenth century, and made a great catalogue of stars, the  first since the time of Hipparchus.    At the close of the fifteenth century King Alphonso of Spain employed  computers to produce the Alphonsine Tables (1488 A.D.), Purbach  translated Ptolemy's book, and observations were carried out in  Germany by Mueller, known as Regiomontanus, and Waltherus.    Nicolai Copernicus, a Sclav, was born in 1473 at Thorn, in Polish  Prussia. He studied at Cracow and in Italy. He was a priest, and  settled at Frauenberg.  He did not undertake continuous observations,  but devoted himself to simplifying the planetary systems and devising  means for more accurately predicting the positions of the sun, moon,  and planets. He had no idea of framing a solar system on a dynamical  basis.  His great object was to increase the accuracy of the  calculations and the tables. The results of his cogitations were  printed just before his death in an interesting book, _De  Revolutionibus Orbium Celestium_. It is only by careful reading of  this book that the true position of Copernicus can be realised. He  noticed that Nicetas and others had ascribed the apparent diurnal  rotation of the heavens to a real daily rotation of the earth about  its axis, in the opposite direction to the apparent motion of the  stars. Also in the writings of Martianus Capella he learnt that the  Egyptians had supposed Mercury and Venus to revolve round the sun, and  to be carried with him in his annual motion round the earth. He  noticed that the same supposition, if extended to Mars, Jupiter, and  Saturn, would explain easily why they, and especially Mars, seem so  much brighter in opposition.  For Mars would then be a great deal  nearer to the earth than at other times. It would also explain the  retrograde motion of planets when in opposition.    We must here notice that at this stage Copernicus was actually  confronted with the system accepted later by Tycho Brahe, with the  earth fixed. But he now recalled and accepted the views of Pythagoras  and others, according to which the sun is fixed and the earth  revolves; and it must be noted that, geometrically, there is no  difference of any sort between the Egyptian or Tychonic system and  that of Pythagoras as revived by Copernicus, except that on the latter  theory the stars ought to seem to move when the earth changes its  position--a test which failed completely with the rough means of  observation then available. The radical defect of all solar systems  previous to the time of Kepler (1609 A.D.) was the slavish yielding to  Plato's dictum demanding uniform circular motion for the planets, and  the consequent evolution of the epicycle, which was fatal to any  conception of a dynamical theory.    Copernicus could not sever himself from this obnoxious tradition.[5]  It is true that neither the Pythagorean nor the Egypto-Tychonic system  required epicycles for explaining retrograde motion, as the Ptolemaic  theory did. Furthermore, either system could use the excentric of  Hipparchus to explain the irregular motion known as the equation of  the centre.  But Copernicus remarked that he could also use an  epicycle for this purpose, or that he could use both an excentric and  an epicycle for each planet, and so bring theory still closer into  accord with observation. And this he proceeded to do.[6] Moreover,  observers had found irregularities in the moon's motion, due, as we  now know, to the disturbing attraction of the sun.  To correct for  these irregularities Copernicus introduced epicycle on epicycle in the  lunar orbit.    This is in its main features the system propounded by Copernicus.
