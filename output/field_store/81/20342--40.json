Then he appears  as an exponent of a vaster mind and will. The opaque self becomes  transparent with the light of the First Cause.    Yet, within the limits of human education and agency, we may say, great  men exist that there may be greater men. The destiny of organized  nature is amelioration, and who can tell its limits? It is for man to  tame the chaos; on every side, whilst he lives, to scatter the seeds  of science and of song, that climate, corn, animals, men, may be milder,  and the germs of love and benefit may be multiplied.          II. PLATO; OR, THE PHILOSOPHER.      Among books, Plato only is entitled to Omar's fanatical compliment to  the Koran, when he said, \"Burn the libraries; for, their value is in  this book.\" These sentences contain the culture of nations; these are  the corner-stone of schools; these are the fountain-head of literatures.  A discipline it is in logic, arithmetic, taste, symmetry, poetry,  language, rhetoric, ontology, morals, or practical wisdom. There was  never such range of speculation. Out of Plato come all things that are  still written and debated among men of thought. Great havoc makes he  among our originalities. We have reached the mountain from which all  these drift bowlders were detached. The Bible of the learned for twenty-  two hundred years, every brisk young man, who says in succession fine  things to each reluctant generation,--Boethius, Rabelais, Erasmus,  Bruno, Locke, Rousseau, Alfieri, Coleridge,--is some reader of Plato,  translating into the vernacular, wittily, his good things. Even the  men of grander proportion suffer some deduction from the misfortune  (shall I say?) of coming after this exhausting generalizer. St.  Augustine, Copernicus, Newton, Behmen, Swedenborg, Goethe, are likewise  his debtors, and must say after him. For it is fair to credit the  broadest generalizer with all the particulars deducible from his thesis.    Plato is philosophy, and philosophy, Plato,--at once the glory and the  shame of mankind, since neither Saxon nor Roman have availed to add  any idea to his categories. No wife, no children had he, and the  thinkers of all civilized nations are his posterity, and are tinged  with his mind. How many great men Nature is incessantly sending up out  of night, to be his men,--Platonists! the Alexandrians, a constellation  of genius; the Elizabethans, not less; Sir Thomas More, Henry More,  John Hales, John Smith, Lord Bacon, Jeremy Taylor, Ralph Cudworth,  Sydenham, Thomas Taylor; Marcilius Ficinus, and Picus Mirandola.  Calvinism is in his Phaedo: Christianity is in it. Mahometanism draws  all its philosophy, in its hand-book of morals, the Akhlak-y-Jalaly,  from him. Mysticism finds in Plato all its texts. This citizen of a  town in Greece is no villager nor patriot. An Englishman reads and  says, \"how English!\" a German--\"how Teutonic!\" an Italian--\"how Roman  and how Greek!\" As they say that Helen of Argos had that universal  beauty that everybody felt related to her, so Plato seems, to a reader  in New England, an American genius. His broad humanity transcends all  sectional lines.    This range of Plato instructs us what to think of the vexed question  concerning his reputed works,--what are genuine, what spurious. It is  singular that wherever we find a man higher, by a whole head, than any  of his contemporaries, it is sure to come into doubt, what are his  real works. Thus, Homer, Plato, Raffaelle, Shakspeare. For these men  magnetize their contemporaries, so that their companions can do for  them what they can never do for themselves; and the great man does  thus live in several bodies; and write, or paint, or act, by many  hands; and after some time, it is not easy to say what is the authentic  work of the master, and what is only of his school.    Plato, too, like every great man, consumed his own times. What is a  great man, but one of great affinities, who takes up into himself all  arts, sciences, all knowables, as his food? He can spare nothing; he  can dispose of everything. What is not good for virtue is good for  knowledge. Hence his contemporaries tax him with plagiarism. But the  inventor only knows how to borrow; and society is glad to forget the  innumerable laborers who ministered to this architect, and reserves  all its gratitude for him. When we are praising Plato, it seems we are  praising quotations from Solon, and Sophron, and Philolaus. Be it so.  Every book is a quotation; and every house is a quotation out of all  forests, and mines, and stone quarries; and every man is a quotation  from all his ancestors. And this grasping inventor puts all nations  under contribution.    Plato absorbed the learning of his times,--Philolaus, Timaeus,  Heraclitus, Parmenides, and what else; then his master, Socrates; and  finding himself still capable of a larger synthesis,--beyond all example  then or since,--he traveled into Italy, to gain what Pythagoras had  for him; then into Egypt, and perhaps still further east, to import  the other element, which Europe wanted, into the European mind. This  breadth entitles him to stand as the representative of philosophy. He  says, in the Republic, \"Such a genius as philosophers must of necessity  have, is wont but seldom, in all its parts, to meet in one man; but  its different parts generally spring up in different persons.\" Every  man, who would do anything well, must come to it from a higher ground.  A philosopher must be more than a philosopher. Plato is clothed with  the powers of a poet, stands upon the highest place of the poet, and  (though I doubt he wanted the decisive gift of lyric expression) mainly  is not a poet, because he chose to use the poetic gift to an ulterior  purpose.    Great geniuses have the shortest biographies. Their cousins can tell  you nothing about them. They lived in their writings, and so their  house and street life was trivial and commonplace. If you would know  their tastes and complexions, the most admiring of their readers most  resembles them. Plato, especially, has no external biography. If he  had lover, wife, or children, we hear nothing of them. He ground them  all into paint. As a good chimney burns its smoke, so a philosopher  converts the value of all his fortunes into his intellectual  performances.    He was born 430 A. C., about the time of the death of Pericles; was  of patrician connection in his times and city; and is said to have had  an early inclination for war; but in his twentieth year, meeting with  Socrates, was easily dissuaded from this pursuit, and remained for ten  years his scholar, until the death of Socrates. He then went to Megara;  accepted the invitations of Dion and of Dionysius, to the court of  Sicily; and went thither three times, though very capriciously treated.  He traveled into Italy; then into Egypt, where he stayed a long time;  some say three,--some say thirteen years. It is said, he went farther,  into Babylonia: this is uncertain. Returning to Athens, he gave lessons,  in the Academy, to those whom his fame drew thither; and died, as we  have received it, in the act of writing, at eighty-one years.    But the biography of Plato is interior. We are to account for the  supreme elevation of this man, in the intellectual history of our  race,--how it happens that, in proportion to the culture of men, they  become his scholars; that, as our Jewish Bible has implanted itself  in the table-talk and household life of every man and woman in the  European and American nations, so the writings of Plato have  pre-occupied every school of learning, every lover of thought, every  church, every poet,--making it impossible to think, on certain levels,  except through him. He stands between the truth and every man's mind,  and has almost impressed language, and the primary forms of thought,  with his name and seal. I am struck, in reading him, with the extreme  modernness of his style and spirit. Here is the germ of that Europe  we know so well, in its long history of arts and arms; here are all  its traits, already discernible in the mind of Plato,--and in none  before him. It has spread itself since into a hundred histories, but  has added no new element. This perpetual modernness is the measure of  merit, in every work of art; since the author of it was not misled by  anything shortlived or local, but abode by real and abiding traits.  How Plato came thus to be Europe, and philosophy, and almost literature,  is the problem for us to solve.    This could not have happened, without a sound, sincere, and catholic  man, able to honor, at the same time, the ideal, or laws of the mind,  and fate, or the order of nature. The first period of a nation, as of  an individual, is the period of unconscious strength. Children cry,  scream and stamp with fury, unable to express their desires. As soon  as they can speak and tell their want, and the reason of it, they  become gentle. In adult life, whilst the perceptions are obtuse, men  and women talk vehemently and superlatively, blunder and quarrel; their  manners are full of desperation; their speech is full of oaths. As  soon as, with culture, things have cleared up a little, and they see  them no longer in lumps and masses, but accurately distributed, they  desist from that weak vehemence, and explain their meaning in detail.  If the tongue had not been framed for articulation, man would still  be a beast in the forest. The same weakness and want, on a higher  plane, occurs daily in the education of ardent young men and women.  \"Ah! you don't understand me; I have never met with any one who  comprehends me:\" and they sigh and weep, write verses, and walk  alone,--fault of power to express their precise meaning. In a month  or two, through the favor of their good genius, they meet some one so  related as to assist their volcanic estate; and, good communication"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6317"],[0,"Sailing Alone Around the World (#5)"],[1," propitious  for a good run. On the following day, the head sea having gone down, I  sailed from Yarmouth, and let go my last hold on America. The log of  my first day on the Atlantic in the _Spray_ reads briefly: \"9:30 A.M.  sailed from Yarmouth. 4:30 P.M. passed Cape Sable; distance, three  cables from the land. The sloop making eight knots. Fresh breeze N.W.\"  Before the sun went down I was taking my supper of strawberries and  tea in smooth water under the lee of the east-coast land, along which  the _Spray_ was now leisurely skirting.    At noon on July 3 Ironbound Island was abeam. The _Spray_ was again at  her best. A large schooner came out of Liverpool, Nova Scotia, this  morning, steering eastward. The _Spray_ put her hull down astern in  five hours. At 6:45 P.M. I was in close under Chebucto Head light,  near Halifax harbor. I set my flag and squared away, taking my  departure from George's Island before dark to sail east of Sable  Island. There are many beacon lights along the coast. Sambro, the Rock  of Lamentations, carries a noble light, which, however, the liner  _Atlantic_, on the night of her terrible disaster, did not see. I  watched light after light sink astern as I sailed into the unbounded  sea, till Sambro, the last of them all, was below the horizon. The  _Spray_ was then alone, and sailing on, she held her course. July 4,  at 6 A.M., I put in double reefs, and at 8:30 A.M. turned out all  reefs. At 9:40 P.M. I raised the sheen only of the light on the west  end of Sable Island, which may also be called the Island of Tragedies.  The fog, which till this moment had held off, now lowered over the sea  like a pall. I was in a world of fog, shut off from the universe. I  did not see any more of the light. By the lead, which I cast often, I  found that a little after midnight I was passing the east point of the  island, and should soon be clear of dangers of land and shoals. The  wind was holding free, though it was from the foggy point,  south-southwest. It is said that within a few years Sable Island has  been reduced from forty miles in length to twenty, and that of three  lighthouses built on it since 1880, two have been washed away and the  third will soon be engulfed.    [Illustration: \"'Good evening, sir.'\"]    On the evening of July 5 the _Spray_, after having steered all day  over a lumpy sea, took it into her head to go without the helmsman's  aid. I had been steering southeast by south, but the wind hauling  forward a bit, she dropped into a smooth lane, heading southeast, and  making about eight knots, her very best work. I crowded on sail to  cross the track of the liners without loss of time, and to reach as  soon as possible the friendly Gulf Stream. The fog lifting before  night, I was afforded a look at the sun just as it was touching the  sea. I watched it go down and out of sight. Then I turned my face  eastward, and there, apparently at the very end of the bowsprit, was  the smiling full moon rising out of the sea. Neptune himself coming  over the bows could not have startled me more. \"Good evening, sir,\" I  cried; \"I'm glad to see you.\" Many a long talk since then I have had  with the man in the moon; he had my confidence on the voyage.    About midnight the fog shut down again denser than ever before. One  could almost \"stand on it.\" It continued so for a number of days, the  wind increasing to a gale. The waves rose high, but I had a good ship.  Still, in the dismal fog I felt myself drifting into loneliness, an  insect on a straw in the midst of the elements. I lashed the helm, and  my vessel held her course, and while she sailed I slept.    During these days a feeling of awe crept over me. My memory worked  with startling power. The ominous, the insignificant, the great, the  small, the wonderful, the commonplace--all appeared before my mental  vision in magical succession. Pages of my history were recalled which  had been so long forgotten that they seemed to belong to a previous  existence. I heard all the voices of the past laughing, crying,  telling what I had heard them tell in many corners of the earth.    The loneliness of my state wore off when the gale was high and I found  much work to do. When fine weather returned, then came the sense of  solitude, which I could not shake off. I used my voice often, at first  giving some order about the affairs of a ship, for I had been told  that from disuse I should lose my speech. At the meridian altitude of  the sun I called aloud, \"Eight bells,\" after the custom on a ship at  sea. Again from my cabin I cried to an imaginary man at the helm, \"How  does she head, there?\" and again, \"Is she on her course?\" But getting  no reply, I was reminded the more palpably of my condition. My voice  sounded hollow on the empty air, and I dropped the practice. However,  it was not long before the thought came to me that when I was a lad I  used to sing; why not try that now, where it would disturb no one? My  musical talent had never bred envy in others, but out on the Atlantic,  to realize what it meant, you should have heard me sing. You should  have seen the porpoises leap when I pitched my voice for the waves and  the sea and all that was in it. Old turtles, with large eyes, poked  their heads up out of the sea as I sang \"Johnny Boker,\" and \"We'll Pay  Darby Doyl for his Boots,\" and the like. But the porpoises were, on  the whole, vastly more appreciative than the turtles; they jumped a  deal higher. One day when I was humming a favorite chant, I think it  was \"Babylon's a-Fallin',\" a porpoise jumped higher than the bowsprit.  Had the _Spray_ been going a little faster she would have scooped  him in. The sea-birds sailed around rather shy.    July 10, eight days at sea, the _Spray_ was twelve hundred miles east  of Cape Sable. One hundred and fifty miles a day for so small a vessel  must be considered good sailing. It was the greatest run the _Spray_  ever made before or since in so few days. On the evening of July 14,  in better humor than ever before, all hands cried, \"Sail ho!\" The sail  was a barkantine, three points on the weather bow, hull down. Then  came the night. My ship was sailing along now without attention to the  helm. The wind was south; she was heading east. Her sails were trimmed  like the sails of the nautilus. They drew steadily all night. I went  frequently on deck, but found all well. A merry breeze kept on from  the south. Early in the morning of the 15th the _Spray_ was close  aboard the stranger, which proved to be _La Vaguisa_ of Vigo,  twenty-three days from Philadelphia, bound for Vigo. A lookout from  his masthead had spied the _Spray_ the evening before. The captain,  when I came near enough, threw a line to me and sent a bottle of wine  across slung by the neck, and very good wine it was. He also sent his  card, which bore the name of Juan Gantes. I think he was a good man,  as Spaniards go. But when I asked him to report me \"all well\" (the  _Spray_ passing him in a lively manner), he hauled his shoulders much  above his head; and when his mate, who knew of my expedition, told him  that I was alone, he crossed himself and made for his cabin. I did not  see him again. By sundown he was as far astern as he had been ahead  the evening before.    [Illustration: \"He also sent his card.\"]    There was now less and less monotony. On July 16 the wind was  northwest and clear, the sea smooth, and a large bark, hull down, came  in sight on the lee bow, and at 2:30 P.M. I spoke the stranger. She  was the bark _Java_ of Glasgow, from Peru for Queenstown for orders.  Her old captain was bearish, but I met a bear once in Alaska that  looked pleasanter. At least, the bear seemed pleased to meet me, but  this grizzly old man! Well, I suppose my hail disturbed his siesta,  and my little sloop passing his great ship had somewhat the effect on  him that a red rag has upon a bull. I had the advantage over heavy  ships, by long odds, in the light winds of this and the two previous  days. The wind was light; his ship was heavy and foul, making poor  headway, while the _Spray_, with a great mainsail bellying even to  light winds, was just skipping along as nimbly as one could wish. \"How  long has it been calm about here?\" roared the captain of the _Java_,  as I came within hail of him. \"Dunno, cap'n,\" I shouted back as loud  as I could bawl. \"I haven't been here long.\" At this the mate on the  forecastle wore a broad grin. \"I left Cape Sable fourteen days ago,\" I  added. (I was now well across toward the Azores.) \"Mate,\" he roared to  his chief officer--\"mate, come here and listen to the Yankee's yarn.  Haul down the flag, mate, haul down the flag!\" In the best of humor,  after all, the _Java_ surrendered to the _Spray_.    [Illustration: Chart of the _Spray's_ course around the world--April  24, 1895, to July 3, 1898]    The acute pain of solitude experienced at first never returned. I had  penetrated a mystery, and, by the way, I had sailed through a fog. I  had met Neptune in his wrath, but he found that I had not treated him  with contempt, and so he suffered me to go on and explore.    In the log for July 18 there is this entry: \"Fine weather, wind  south-southwest. Porpoises gamboling all about. The S.S. _Olympia_  passed at 11:30 A.M., long. W. 34 degrees 50'.\"    \"It lacks now three minutes of the half-hour,\" shouted the captain, as  he gave me the longitude and the time. I admired the businesslike air  of the _Olympia_; but I have the feeling still that the captain was  just a little too precise in his reckoning. That may be all well  enough, however, where there is plenty of sea-room. But  over-confidence, I believe, was the cause of the disaster to the liner  _Atlantic_, and many more like her. The captain knew too well where he  was. There were no porpoises at all skipping along with the _Olympia_!  Porpoises always prefer sailing-ships. The captain was a young man, I  observed, and had before him, I hope, "]]]
