Thus, if the Lord--who  is the light of all things--vouchsafe to enlighten me, I will treat  of Light; wherefore I will divide the present work into 3 Parts  [Footnote: 10. In the middle ages--for instance, by ROGER BACON, by  VITELLONE, with whose works Leonardo was certainly familiar, and by  all the writers of the Renaissance Perspective and Optics were not  regarded as distinct sciences. Perspective, indeed, is in its widest  application the science of seeing. Although to Leonardo the two  sciences were clearly separate, it is not so as to their names; thus  we find axioms in Optics under the heading Perspective. According to  this arrangement of the materials for the theoretical portion of the  _libro di pittura_ propositions in Perspective and in Optics stand  side by side or occur alternately. Although this particular chapter  deals only with Optics, it is not improbable that the words _partirò  la presente opera in 3 parti_ may refer to the same division into  three sections which is spoken of in chapters 14 to 17.].    The plan of the book on Painting (14--17).    14.    ON THE THREE BRANCHES OF PERSPECTIVE.    There are three branches of perspective; the first deals with the  reasons of the (apparent) diminution of objects as they recede from  the eye, and is known as Diminishing Perspective.--The second  contains the way in which colours vary as they recede from the eye.  The third and last is concerned with the explanation of how the  objects [in a picture] ought to be less finished in proportion as  they are remote (and the names are as follows):    Linear Perspective. The Perspective of Colour. The Perspective of  Disappearance.    [Footnote: 13. From the character of the handwriting I infer that  this passage was written before the year 1490.].    15.    ON PAINTING AND PERSPECTIVE.    The divisions of Perspective are 3, as used in drawing; of these,  the first includes the diminution in size of opaque objects; the  second treats of the diminution and loss of outline in such opaque  objects; the third, of the diminution and loss of colour at long  distances.    [Footnote: The division is here the same as in the previous chapter  No. 14, and this is worthy of note when we connect it with the fact  that a space of about 20 years must have intervened between the  writing of the two passages.]    16.    THE DISCOURSE ON PAINTING.    Perspective, as bearing on drawing, is divided into three principal  sections; of which the first treats of the diminution in the size of  bodies at different distances. The second part is that which treats  of the diminution in colour in these objects. The third [deals with]  the diminished distinctness of the forms and outlines displayed by  the objects at various distances.    17.    ON THE SECTIONS OF [THE BOOK ON] PAINTING.    The first thing in painting is that the objects it represents should  appear in relief, and that the grounds surrounding them at different  distances shall appear within the vertical plane of the foreground  of the picture by means of the 3 branches of Perspective, which are:  the diminution in the distinctness of the forms of the objects, the  diminution in their magnitude; and the diminution in their colour.  And of these 3 classes of Perspective the first results from [the  structure of] the eye, while the other two are caused by the  atmosphere which intervenes between the eye and the objects seen by  it. The second essential in painting is appropriate action and a due  variety in the figures, so that the men may not all look like  brothers, &c.    [Footnote: This and the two foregoing chapters must have been  written in 1513 to 1516. They undoubtedly indicate the scheme which  Leonardo wished to carry out in arranging his researches on  Perspective as applied to Painting. This is important because it is  an evidence against the supposition of H. LUDWIG and others, that  Leonardo had collected his principles of Perspective in one book so  early as before 1500; a Book which, according to the hypothesis,  must have been lost at a very early period, or destroyed possibly,  by the French (!) in 1500 (see H. LUDWIG. L. da Vinci: _Das Buch van  der Malerei_. Vienna 1882 III, 7 and 8).]    The use of the book on Painting.    18.    These rules are of use only in correcting the figures; since every  man makes some mistakes in his first compositions and he who knows  them not, cannot amend them. But you, knowing your errors, will  correct your works and where you find mistakes amend them, and  remember never to fall into them again. But if you try to apply  these rules in composition you will never make an end, and will  produce confusion in your works.    These rules will enable you to have a free and sound judgment; since  good judgment is born of clear understanding, and a clear  understanding comes of reasons derived from sound rules, and sound  rules are the issue of sound experience--the common mother of all  the sciences and arts. Hence, bearing in mind the precepts of my  rules, you will be able, merely by your amended judgment, to  criticise and recognise every thing that is out of proportion in a  work, whether in the perspective or in the figures or any thing  else.    Necessity of theoretical knowledge (19. 20).    19.    OF THE MISTAKES MADE BY THOSE WHO PRACTISE WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE.    Those who are in love with practice without knowledge are like the  sailor who gets into a ship without rudder or compass and who never  can be certain whether he is going. Practice must always be founded  on sound theory, and to this Perspective is the guide and the  gateway; and without this nothing can be done well in the matter of  drawing.    20.    The painter who draws merely by practice and by eye, without any  reason, is like a mirror which copies every thing placed in front of  it without being conscious of their existence.    The function of the eye (21-23).    21.    INTRODUCTION TO PERSPECTIVE:--THAT IS OF THE FUNCTION OF THE EYE.    Behold here O reader! a thing concerning which we cannot trust our  forefathers, the ancients, who tried to define what the Soul and  Life are--which are beyond proof, whereas those things, which can at  any time be clearly known and proved by experience, remained for  many ages unknown or falsely understood. The eye, whose function we  so certainly know by experience, has, down to my own time, been  defined by an infinite number of authors as one thing; but I find,  by experience, that it is quite another. [Footnote 13: Compare the  note to No. 70.]    [Footnote: In section 13 we already find it indicated that the study  of Perspective and of Optics is to be based on that of the functions  of the eye. Leonardo also refers to the science of the eye, in his  astronomical researches, for instance in MS. F 25b '_Ordine del  provare la terra essere una stella: Imprima difinisce l'occhio'_,  &c. Compare also MS. E 15b and F 60b. The principles of astronomical  perspective.]    22.    Here [in the eye] forms, here colours, here the character of every  part of the universe are concentrated to a point; and that point is  so marvellous a thing ... Oh! marvellous, O stupendous Necessity--by  thy laws thou dost compel every effect to be the direct result of  its cause, by the shortest path. These [indeed] are miracles;...    In so small a space it can be reproduced and rearranged in its whole  expanse. Describe in your anatomy what proportion there is between  the diameters of all the images in the eye and the distance from  them of the crystalline lens.    23.    OF THE 10 ATTRIBUTES OF THE EYE, ALL CONCERNED IN PAINTING.    Painting is concerned with all the 10 attributes of sight; which  are:--Darkness, Light, Solidity and Colour, Form and Position,  Distance and Propinquity, Motion and Rest. This little work of mine  will be a tissue [of the studies] of these attributes, reminding the  painter of the rules and methods by which he should use his art to  imitate all the works of Nature which adorn the world.    24.    ON PAINTING.    Variability of the eye.    1st. The pupil of the eye contracts, in proportion to the increase  of light which is reflected in it. 2nd. The pupil of the eye expands  in proportion to the diminution in the day light, or any other  light, that is reflected in it. 3rd. [Footnote: 8. The subject of  this third proposition we find fully discussed in MS. G. 44a.]. The  eye perceives and recognises the objects of its vision with greater  intensity in proportion as the pupil is more widely dilated; and  this can be proved by the case of nocturnal animals, such as cats,  and certain birds--as the owl and others--in which the pupil varies  in a high degree from large to small, &c., when in the dark or in  the light. 4th. The eye [out of doors] in an illuminated atmosphere  sees darkness behind the windows of houses which [nevertheless] are  light. 5th. All colours when placed in the shade appear of an equal  degree of darkness, among themselves. 6th. But all colours when  placed in a full light, never vary from their true and essential  hue.    25.    OF THE EYE.    Focus of sight.    If the eye is required to look at an object placed too near to it,  it cannot judge of it well--as happens to a man who tries to see the  tip of his nose. Hence, as a general rule, Nature teaches us that an  object can never be seen perfectly unless the space between it and  the eye is equal, at least, to the length of the face.    Differences of perception by one eye and by both eyes (26-29).    26.    OF THE EYE.    When both eyes direct the pyramid of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50133"],[0,"The Dunwich Horror (#5)"],[1,"think  it a common Dunwich scandal! But what thing--what cursed shapeless  influence on or off this three-dimensioned earth--was Wilbur Whateley's  father? Born on Candlemas--nine months after May Eve of 1912, when the  talk about the queer earth noises reached clear to Arkham--what walked  on the mountains that May Night? What Roodmas horror fastened itself on  the world in half-human flesh and blood?\"    During the ensuing weeks Dr. Armitage set about to collect all possible  data on Wilbur Whateley and the formless presences around Dunwich. He  got in communication with Dr. Houghton of Aylesbury, who had attended  Old Whateley in his last illness, and found much to ponder over in the  grandfather's last words as quoted by the physician. A visit to Dunwich  Village failed to bring out much that was new; but a close survey of  the _Necronomicon_, in those parts which Wilbur had sought so avidly,  seemed to supply new and terrible clues to the nature, methods, and  desires of the strange evil so vaguely threatening this planet. Talks  with several students of archaic lore in Boston, and letters to many  others elsewhere, gave him a growing amazement which passed slowly  through varied degrees of alarm to a state of really acute spiritual  fear. As the summer drew on he felt dimly that something ought to be  done about the lurking terrors of the upper Miskatonic valley, and  about the monstrous being known to the human world as Wilbur Whateley.      6    The Dunwich horror itself came between Lammas and the equinox in 1928,  and Dr. Armitage was among those who witnessed its monstrous prologue.  He had heard, meanwhile, of Whateley's grotesque trip to Cambridge,  and of his frantic efforts to borrow or copy from the _Necronomicon_  at the Widener Library. Those efforts had been in vain, since Armitage  had issued warnings of the keenest intensity to all librarians having  charge of the dreaded volume. Wilbur had been shockingly nervous at  Cambridge; anxious for the book, yet almost equally anxious to get  home again, as if he feared the results of being away long.    Early in August the half-expected outcome developed, and in the small  hours of the third Dr. Armitage was awakened suddenly by the wild,  fierce cries of the savage watchdog on the college campus. Deep and  terrible, the snarling, half-mad growls and barks continued; always  in mounting volume, but with hideously significant pauses. Then there  rang out a scream from a wholly different throat--such a scream as  roused half the sleepers of Arkham and haunted their dreams ever  afterward--such a scream as could come from no being born of earth, or  wholly of earth.    Armitage hastened into some clothing and rushed across the street and  lawn to the college buildings, saw that others were ahead of him; and  heard the echoes of a burglar-alarm still shrilling from the library.  An open window showed black and gaping in the moonlight. What had come  had indeed completed its entrance; for the barking and the screaming,  now fast fading into a mixed low growling and moaning, proceeded  unmistakably from within. Some instinct warned Armitage that what was  taking place was not a thing for unfortified eyes to see, so he brushed  back the crowd with authority as he unlocked the vestibule door. Among  the others he saw Professor Warren Rice and Dr. Francis Morgan, men to  whom he had told some of his conjectures and misgivings; and these two  he motioned to accompany him inside. The inward sounds, except for a  watchful, droning whine from the dog, had by this time quite subsided;  but Armitage now perceived with a sudden start that a loud chorus of  whippoorwills among the shrubbery had commenced a damnably rhythmical  piping, as if in unison with the last breath of a dying man.    The building was full of a frightful stench which Dr. Armitage knew  too well, and the three men rushed across the hall to the small  genealogical reading-room whence the low whining came. For a second  nobody dared to turn on the light; then Armitage summoned up his  courage and snapped the switch. One of the three--it is not certain  which--shrieked aloud at what sprawled before them among disordered  tables and overturned chairs. Professor Rice declares that he wholly  lost consciousness for an instant, though he did not stumble or fall.    The thing that lay half-bent on its side in a fetid pool of  greenish-yellow ichor and tarry stickiness was almost nine feet tall,  and the dog had torn off all the clothing and some of the skin. It  was not quite dead, but twitched silently and spasmodically while its  chest heaved in monstrous unison with the mad piping of the expectant  whippoorwills outside. Bits of shoe-leather and fragments of apparel  were scattered about the room, and just inside the window an empty  canvas sack lay where it had evidently been thrown. Near the central  desk a revolver had fallen, a dented but undischarged cartridge later  explaining why it had not been fired. The thing itself, however,  crowded out all other images at the time. It would be trite and not  wholly accurate to say that no human pen could describe it, but one may  properly say that it could not be vividly visualized by anyone whose  ideas of aspect and contour are too closely bound up with the common  life-forms of this planet and of the three known dimensions. It was  partly human, beyond a doubt, with very manlike hands and head, and the  goatish, chinless face had the stamp of the Whateleys upon it. But the  torso and lower parts of the body were teratologically fabulous, so  that only generous clothing could ever have enabled it to walk on earth  unchallenged or uneradicated.    Above the waist it was semi-anthropomorphic; though its chest, where  the dog's rending paws still rested watchfully, had the leathery,  reticulated hide of a crocodile or alligator. The back was piebald  with yellow and black, and dimly suggested the squamous covering of  certain snakes. Below the waist, though, it was the worst; for here  all human resemblance left off and sheer fantasy began. The skin was  thickly covered with coarse black fur, and from the abdomen a score of  long greenish-gray tentacles with red sucking mouths protruded limply.  Their arrangement was odd, and seemed to follow the symmetries of some  cosmic geometry unknown to earth or the solar system. On each of the  hips, deep set in a kind of pinkish, ciliated orbit, was what seemed to  be a rudimentary eye; whilst in lieu of a tail there depended a kind of  trunk or feeler with purple annular markings, and with many evidences  of being an undeveloped mouth or throat. The limbs, save for their  black fur, roughly resembled the hind legs of prehistoric earth's giant  saurians; and terminated in ridgy-veined pads that were neither hooves  nor claws. When the thing breathed, its tail and tentacles rhythmically  changed color, as if from some circulatory cause normal to the  non-human side of its ancestry. In the tentacles this was observable as  a deepening of the greenish tinge, whilst in the tail it was manifest  as a yellowish appearance which alternated with a sickly grayish-white  in the spaces between the purple rings. Of genuine blood there was  none; only the fetid greenish-yellow ichor which trickled along the  painted floor beyond the radius of the stickiness, and left a curious  discoloration behind it.    As the presence of the three men seemed to rouse the dying thing, it  began to mumble without turning or raising its head. Dr. Armitage  made no written record of its mouthings, but asserts confidently that  nothing in English was uttered. At first the syllables defied all  correlation with any speech of earth, but toward the last there came  some disjointed fragments evidently taken from the _Necronomicon_,  that monstrous blasphemy in quest of which the thing had perished.  Those fragments, as Armitage recalls them, ran something like \"_N'gai,  n'gha'ghaa, bugg-shoggog, y'hah; Yog-Sothoth, Yog-Sothoth...._\"  They trailed off into nothingness as the whippoorwills shrieked in  rhythmical crescendoes of unholy anticipation.    Then came a halt in the gasping, and the dog raised his head in a long,  lugubrious howl. A change came over the yellow, goatish face of the  prostrate thing, and the great black eyes fell in appallingly. Outside  the window the shrilling of the whippoorwills had suddenly ceased, and  above the murmurs of the gathering crowd there came the sound of a  panic-struck whirring and fluttering. Against the moon vast clouds of  feathery watchers rose and raced from sight, frantic at that which they  had sought for prey.    All at once the dog started up abruptly, gave a frightened bark, and  leaped nervously out the window by which it had entered. A cry rose  from the crowd, and Dr. Armitage shouted to the men outside that no  one must be admitted till the police or medical examiner came. He was  thankful that the windows were just too high to permit of peering  in, and drew the dark curtains carefully down over each one. By this  time two policemen had arrived; and Dr. Morgan, meeting them in the  vestibule, was urging them for their own sakes to postpone entrance to  the stench-filled reading-room till the examiner came and the prostrate  thing could be covered up.    Meanwhile frightful changes were taking place on the floor. One need  not describe the _kind_ and _rate_ of shrinkage and disintegration that  occurred before the eyes of Dr. Armitage and Professor Rice; but it is  permissible to say that, aside from the external appearance of face  and hands, the really human elements in Wilbur Whateley must have been  very small. When the medical examiner came, there was only a sticky  whitish mass on the painted boards, and the monstrous odor had nearly  disappeared. Apparently Whateley had had no skull or bony skeleton; at  least, in any true or stable sense. He had taken somewhat after his  unknown"]]]
