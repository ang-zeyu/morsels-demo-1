In that moment, down came the Invincible, with the rush  of a whirlwind--the courtly world rose to its feet and bent forward  --the fateful coils went circling through the air, and before you  could wink I was towing Sir Launcelot across the field on his  back, and kissing my hand to the storm of waving kerchiefs and  the thunder-crash of applause that greeted me!    Said I to myself, as I coiled my lariat and hung it on my saddle-horn,  and sat there drunk with glory, \"The victory is perfect--no other  will venture against me--knight-errantry is dead.\"  Now imagine my  astonishment--and everybody else's, too--to hear the peculiar  bugle-call which announces that another competitor is about to  enter the lists!  There was a mystery here; I couldn't account for  this thing.  Next, I noticed Merlin gliding away from me; and then  I noticed that my lasso was gone!  The old sleight-of-hand expert  had stolen it, sure, and slipped it under his robe.    The bugle blew again.  I looked, and down came Sagramor riding  again, with his dust brushed off and his veil nicely re-arranged.  I trotted up to meet him, and pretended to find him by the sound  of his horse's hoofs.  He said:    \"Thou'rt quick of ear, but it will not save thee from this!\" and  he touched the hilt of his great sword.  \"An ye are not able to see  it, because of the influence of the veil, know that it is no cumbrous  lance, but a sword--and I ween ye will not be able to avoid it.\"    His visor was up; there was death in his smile.  I should never  be able to dodge his sword, that was plain.  Somebody was going  to die this time.  If he got the drop on me, I could name the  corpse.  We rode forward together, and saluted the royalties.  This time the king was disturbed.  He said:    \"Where is thy strange weapon?\"    \"It is stolen, sire.\"    \"Hast another at hand?\"    \"No, sire, I brought only the one.\"    Then Merlin mixed in:    \"He brought but the one because there was but the one to bring.  There exists none other but that one.  It belongeth to the king  of the Demons of the Sea.  This man is a pretender, and ignorant,  else he had known that that weapon can be used in but eight bouts  only, and then it vanisheth away to its home under the sea.\"    \"Then is he weaponless,\" said the king.  \"Sir Sagramore, ye will  grant him leave to borrow.\"    \"And I will lend!\" said Sir Launcelot, limping up.  \"He is as  brave a knight of his hands as any that be on live, and he shall  have mine.\"    He put his hand on his sword to draw it, but Sir Sagramor said:    \"Stay, it may not be.  He shall fight with his own weapons; it  was his privilege to choose them and bring them.  If he has erred,  on his head be it.\"    \"Knight!\" said the king.  \"Thou'rt overwrought with passion; it  disorders thy mind.  Wouldst kill a naked man?\"    \"An he do it, he shall answer it to me,\" said Sir Launcelot.    \"I will answer it to any he that desireth!\" retorted Sir Sagramor hotly.    Merlin broke in, rubbing his hands and smiling his lowdownest  smile of malicious gratification:    \"'Tis well said, right well said!  And 'tis enough of parleying,  let my lord the king deliver the battle signal.\"    The king had to yield.  The bugle made proclamation, and we turned  apart and rode to our stations.  There we stood, a hundred yards  apart, facing each other, rigid and motionless, like horsed statues.  And so we remained, in a soundless hush, as much as a full minute,  everybody gazing, nobody stirring.  It seemed as if the king could  not take heart to give the signal.  But at last he lifted his hand,  the clear note of the bugle followed, Sir Sagramor's long blade  described a flashing curve in the air, and it was superb to see him  come.  I sat still.  On he came.  I did not move.  People got so  excited that they shouted to me:    \"Fly, fly!  Save thyself!  This is murther!\"    I never budged so much as an inch till that thundering apparition  had got within fifteen paces of me; then I snatched a dragoon  revolver out of my holster, there was a flash and a roar, and  the revolver was back in the holster before anybody could tell  what had happened.    Here was a riderless horse plunging by, and yonder lay Sir Sagramor,  stone dead.    The people that ran to him were stricken dumb to find that the life  was actually gone out of the man and no reason for it visible,  no hurt upon his body, nothing like a wound.  There was a hole  through the breast of his chain-mail, but they attached no importance  to a little thing like that; and as a bullet wound there produces  but little blood, none came in sight because of the clothing and  swaddlings under the armor.  The body was dragged over to let  the king and the swells look down upon it.  They were stupefied  with astonishment naturally.  I was requested to come and explain  the miracle.  But I remained in my tracks, like a statue, and said:    \"If it is a command, I will come, but my lord the king knows that  I am where the laws of combat require me to remain while any desire  to come against me.\"    I waited.  Nobody challenged.  Then I said:    \"If there are any who doubt that this field is well and fairly won,  I do not wait for them to challenge me, I challenge them.\"    \"It is a gallant offer,\" said the king, \"and well beseems you.  Whom will you name first?\"    \"I name none, I challenge all!  Here I stand, and dare the chivalry  of England to come against me--not by individuals, but in mass!\"    \"What!\" shouted a score of knights.    \"You have heard the challenge.  Take it, or I proclaim you recreant  knights and vanquished, every one!\"    It was a \"bluff\" you know.  At such a time it is sound judgment  to put on a bold face and play your hand for a hundred times what  it is worth; forty-nine times out of fifty nobody dares to \"call,\"  and you rake in the chips.  But just this once--well, things looked  squally!  In just no time, five hundred knights were scrambling  into their saddles, and before you could wink a widely scattering  drove were under way and clattering down upon me.  I snatched  both revolvers from the holsters and began to measure distances  and calculate chances.    Bang!  One saddle empty.  Bang! another one.  Bang--bang, and  I bagged two.  Well, it was nip and tuck with us, and I knew it.  If I spent the eleventh shot without convincing these people,  the twelfth man would kill me, sure.  And so I never did feel  so happy as I did when my ninth downed its man and I detected  the wavering in the crowd which is premonitory of panic.  An instant  lost now could knock out my last chance.  But I didn't lose it.  I raised both revolvers and pointed them--the halted host stood  their ground just about one good square moment, then broke and fled.    The day was mine.  Knight-errantry was a doomed institution.  The  march of civilization was begun.  How did I feel?  Ah, you never  could imagine it.    And Brer Merlin?  His stock was flat again.  Somehow, every time  the magic of fol-de-rol tried conclusions with the magic of science,  the magic of fol-de-rol got left.        CHAPTER XL    THREE YEARS LATER    When I broke the back of knight-errantry that time, I no longer  felt obliged to work in secret.  So, the very next day I exposed  my hidden schools, my mines, and my vast system of clandestine  factories and workshops to an astonished world.  That is to say,  I exposed the nineteenth century to the inspection of the sixth.    Well, it is always a good plan to follow up an advantage promptly.  The knights were temporarily down, but if I would keep them so  I must just simply paralyze them--nothing short of that would  answer.  You see, I was \"bluffing\" that last time in the field;  it would be natural for them to work around to that conclusion,  if I gave them a chance.  So I must not give them time; and I didn't.    I renewed my challenge, engraved it on brass, posted it up where  any priest could read it to them, and also kept it standing in  the advertising columns of the paper.    I not only renewed it, but added to its proportions.  I said,  name the day, and I would take fifty assistants and stand up  _against the massed chivalry of the whole earth and destroy it_.    I was not bluffing this time.  I meant what I said; I could do  what I promised.  There wasn't any way to misunderstand the language  of that challenge.  Even the dullest of the chivalry perceived  that this was a plain case of \"put up, or shut up.\"  They were  wise and did the latter.  In all the next three years they gave  me no trouble worth mentioning.    Consider the three years sped.  Now look around on England.  A happy  and prosperous country, and strangely altered.  Schools everywhere,  and several colleges; a number of pretty good newspapers.  Even  authorship was taking a start; Sir Dinadan the Humorist was first  in the field, with a volume of gray-headed jokes which I had been  familiar with during thirteen centuries.  If he had left out that  old rancid one about the lecturer I wouldn't have said anything;  but I couldn't stand that one.  I suppressed the book and hanged  the author.    Slavery was dead and gone; all men were equal before the law;  taxation had been equalized.  The telegraph, the telephone, the  phonograph, the typewriter, the sewing-machine, and all the thousand  willing and handy servants of steam and electricity were working  their way into favor.  We had a steamboat or two on the Thames,  we had steam warships, and the beginnings of a steam commercial  marine; I was getting ready to send out an expedition to discover  America.    We were building several lines of railway, and our line from  Camelot to London was already finished and in operation.  I was  shrewd enough to make all offices connected with the passenger  service places of high and distinguished honor.  My idea was  to attract the chivalry and nobility, and make"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7250"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 9. (#5)"],[1,"to let the enemy turn our own  weapons against us.    Now ensued one of the dullest quarter-hours I had ever endured.  We waited in a silent solitude enclosed by our circles of wire,  and by a circle of heavy smoke outside of these.  We couldn't  see over the wall of smoke, and we couldn't see through it.  But  at last it began to shred away lazily, and by the end of another  quarter-hour the land was clear and our curiosity was enabled  to satisfy itself.  No living creature was in sight!  We now  perceived that additions had been made to our defenses.  The  dynamite had dug a ditch more than a hundred feet wide, all around  us, and cast up an embankment some twenty-five feet high on both  borders of it.  As to destruction of life, it was amazing.  Moreover,  it was beyond estimate.  Of course, we could not _count_ the dead,  because they did not exist as individuals, but merely as homogeneous  protoplasm, with alloys of iron and buttons.    No life was in sight, but necessarily there must have been some  wounded in the rear ranks, who were carried off the field under  cover of the wall of smoke; there would be sickness among the  others--there always is, after an episode like that.  But there  would be no reinforcements; this was the last stand of the chivalry  of England; it was all that was left of the order, after the recent  annihilating wars.  So I felt quite safe in believing that the  utmost force that could for the future be brought against us  would be but small; that is, of knights.  I therefore issued a  congratulatory proclamation to my army in these words:       SOLDIERS, CHAMPIONS OF HUMAN LIBERTY AND EQUALITY:     Your General congratulates you!  In the pride of his     strength and the vanity of his renown, an arrogant     enemy came against you.  You were ready.  The conflict     was brief; on your side, glorious.  This mighty     victory, having been achieved utterly without loss,     stands without example in history.  So long as the     planets shall continue to move in their orbits, the     BATTLE OF THE SAND-BELT will not perish out of the     memories of men.                                    THE BOSS.    I read it well, and the applause I got was very gratifying to me.  I then wound up with these remarks:    \"The war with the English nation, as a nation, is at an end.  The nation has retired from the field and the war.  Before it can  be persuaded to return, war will have ceased.  This campaign is  the only one that is going to be fought.  It will be brief  --the briefest in history.  Also the most destructive to life,  considered from the standpoint of proportion of casualties to  numbers engaged.  We are done with the nation; henceforth we deal  only with the knights.  English knights can be killed, but they  cannot be conquered.  We know what is before us.  While one of  these men remains alive, our task is not finished, the war is not  ended.  We will kill them all.\"  [Loud and long continued applause.]    I picketed the great embankments thrown up around our lines by  the dynamite explosion--merely a lookout of a couple of boys  to announce the enemy when he should appear again.    Next, I sent an engineer and forty men to a point just beyond  our lines on the south, to turn a mountain brook that was there,  and bring it within our lines and under our command, arranging  it in such a way that I could make instant use of it in an emergency.  The forty men were divided into two shifts of twenty each, and  were to relieve each other every two hours.  In ten hours the  work was accomplished.    It was nightfall now, and I withdrew my pickets.  The one who  had had the northern outlook reported a camp in sight, but visible  with the glass only.  He also reported that a few knights had been  feeling their way toward us, and had driven some cattle across our  lines, but that the knights themselves had not come very near.  That was what I had been expecting.  They were feeling us, you  see; they wanted to know if we were going to play that red terror  on them again.  They would grow bolder in the night, perhaps.  I believed I knew what project they would attempt, because it was  plainly the thing I would attempt myself if I were in their places  and as ignorant as they were.  I mentioned it to Clarence.    \"I think you are right,\" said he; \"it is the obvious thing for  them to try.\"    \"Well, then,\" I said, \"if they do it they are doomed.\"    \"Certainly.\"    \"They won't have the slightest show in the world.\"    \"Of course they won't.\"    \"It's dreadful, Clarence.  It seems an awful pity.\"    The thing disturbed me so that I couldn't get any peace of mind  for thinking of it and worrying over it.  So, at last, to quiet  my conscience, I framed this message to the knights:       TO THE HONORABLE THE COMMANDER OF THE INSURGENT     CHIVALRY OF ENGLAND: YOU fight in vain.  We know     your strength--if one may call it by that name.     We know that at the utmost you cannot bring     against us above five and twenty thousand knights.     Therefore, you have no chance--none whatever.     Reflect: we are well equipped, well fortified, we     number 54.  Fifty-four what?  Men?  No, MINDS--the     capablest in the world; a force against which     mere animal might may no more hope to prevail than     may the idle waves of the sea hope to prevail     against the granite barriers of England.  Be advised.     We offer you your lives; for the sake of your     families, do not reject the gift.  We offer you     this chance, and it is the last: throw down your     arms; surrender unconditionally to the Republic,     and all will be forgiven.                              (Signed) THE BOSS.    I read it to Clarence, and said I proposed to send it by a flag  of truce.  He laughed the sarcastic laugh he was born with, and said:    \"Somehow it seems impossible for you to ever fully realize what  these nobilities are.  Now let us save a little time and trouble.  Consider me the commander of the knights yonder.  Now, then,  you are the flag of truce; approach and deliver me your message,  and I will give you your answer.\"    I humored the idea.  I came forward under an imaginary guard of  the enemy's soldiers, produced my paper, and read it through.  For answer, Clarence struck the paper out of my hand, pursed up  a scornful lip and said with lofty disdain:    \"Dismember me this animal, and return him in a basket to the  base-born knave who sent him; other answer have I none!\"    How empty is theory in presence of fact!  And this was just fact,  and nothing else.  It was the thing that would have happened,  there was no getting around that.  I tore up the paper and granted  my mistimed sentimentalities a permanent rest.    Then, to business.  I tested the electric signals from the gatling  platform to the cave, and made sure that they were all right;  I tested and retested those which commanded the fences--these  were signals whereby I could break and renew the electric current  in each fence independently of the others at will.  I placed the  brook-connection under the guard and authority of three of my  best boys, who would alternate in two-hour watches all night and  promptly obey my signal, if I should have occasion to give it  --three revolver-shots in quick succession.  Sentry-duty was discarded  for the night, and the corral left empty of life; I ordered that  quiet be maintained in the cave, and the electric lights turned  down to a glimmer.    As soon as it was good and dark, I shut off the current from all  the fences, and then groped my way out to the embankment bordering  our side of the great dynamite ditch.  I crept to the top of it  and lay there on the slant of the muck to watch.  But it was  too dark to see anything.  As for sounds, there were none.  The  stillness was deathlike.  True, there were the usual night-sounds  of the country--the whir of night-birds, the buzzing of insects,  the barking of distant dogs, the mellow lowing of far-off kine  --but these didn't seem to break the stillness, they only intensified  it, and added a grewsome melancholy to it into the bargain.    I presently gave up looking, the night shut down so black, but  I kept my ears strained to catch the least suspicious sound, for  I judged I had only to wait, and I shouldn't be disappointed.  However, I had to wait a long time.  At last I caught what you  may call in distinct glimpses of sound dulled metallic sound.  I pricked up my ears, then, and held my breath, for this was the  sort of thing I had been waiting for.  This sound thickened, and  approached--from toward the north.  Presently, I heard it at my  own level--the ridge-top of the opposite embankment, a hundred  feet or more away.  Then I seemed to see a row of black dots appear  along that ridge--human heads?  I couldn't tell; it mightn't be  anything at all; you can't depend on your eyes when your imagination  is out of focus.  However, the question was soon settled.  I heard  that metallic noise descending into the great ditch.  It augmented  fast, it spread all along, and it unmistakably furnished me this  fact: an armed host was taking up its quarters in the ditch.  Yes,  these people were arranging a little surprise party for us.  We  could expect entertainment about dawn, possibly earlier.    I groped my way back to the corral now; I had seen enough.  I went  to the platform and signaled to turn the current on to the two  inner fences.  Then I went into the cave, and found everything  satisfactory there--nobody awake but the working-watch.  I woke  Clarence and told him the great ditch was filling up with men,  and that I believed all the knights were coming for us in a body.  It was my notion that as soon as dawn approached we could expect  the ditch's ambuscaded thousands to swarm up over the embankment  and make an assault, and be followed immediately by the rest  of their army.    Clarence said:    \"They will be wanting to send a scout"]]]
