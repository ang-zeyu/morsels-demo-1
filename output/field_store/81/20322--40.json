People soon began to assemble, some on foot, and others  on horseback and in waggons--Pugnose's tavern was all  bustle and confusion--Plaintiffs, Defendants, and witnesses,  all talking, quarreling, explaining, and drinking. Here  comes the Squire, said one--I'm thinking his horse carries  more roguery than law, said another; they must have been  in proper want of timber to make a justice of, said a  third, when they took such a crooked stick as that; sap  headed enough too for refuse, said a stout looking farmer;  may be so, said another, but as bard at the heart as a  log of elm; howsomever, said a third, I hope it wont be  long afore he has the wainy edge scored off of him, any  how. Many more such remarks were made, all drawn from  familiar objects, but all expressive of bitterness and  contempt.    He carried one or two large books with him in his gig,  and a considerable roll of papers. As soon as the  obsequious Mr. Pugnose saw him at the door, he assisted  him to alight, ushered him into the \"best room,\" and  desired the constable to attend \"the Squire.\" The crowd  immediately entered, and the Constable opened the Court  in due form, and commanded silence. Taking out a long  list of causes, Mr. Pettifog commenced reading the  names--James Sharp versus John Slug--call John Slug:  John Slug being duly called and not answering, was  defaulted. In this manner he proceeded to default some  20 or 30 persons; at last he came to a cause, William  Hare versus Dennis O'Brien--call Dennis O'Brien--here  I am, said a voice from the other room--here I am, who  has any thing to say to Dennis O'Brien? Make less noise,  sir, said the Justice, or I'll commit you. Commit me, is  it, said Dennis, take care then, Squire, you don't commit  yourself You are sued by William Hare for three pounds  for a month's board and lodging, what have you to say to  it? Say to it, said Dennis, did you ever hear what Tim  Doyle said when be was going to be hanged for stealing  a pig' says he, if the pig had'nt squeeled in the bag  I'd never have been found out, so I would'nt--so I'll  take warning by Tim Doyle's fate, I say nothing, let him  prove it. Here Mr. Hare was called on for his proof,  but taking it for granted that the board would be admitted,  and the defence opened, he was not prepared with proof.  I demand, said Dennis, I demand an unsuit. Here there  was a consultation between the Justice and the Plaintiff,  when the Justice said, I shall not nonsuit him, I shall  continue the cause. What, hang it up till next Court  --you had better hang me up then at once--how can a poor  man come here so often--this may be the entertainment  Pugnose advertises for horses, but by Jacquers, it is no  entertainment for me--I admit then, sooner than come  again, I admit it. You admit you owe him three pounds  then for a month's board? I admit no such thing, I say  I boarded with him a month, and was like Pat Moran's cow  at the end of it, at the lifting, bad luck to him. A  neighbour was here called who proved that the three pounds  might be the usual price. And do you know I taught his  children to write at the school, said Dennis--you might,  answered the witness--and what is that worth? I don't  know--you don't know, faith I believe you're right, said  Dennis, for if the children are half as big rogues as  the father, they might leave writing alone, or they'd be  like to be hanged for forgery. Here Dennis produced his  account for teaching five children, two quarters, at 9  shillings a quarter each, 4 pounds 10s. I am sorry, Mr.  O'Brien, said the Justice, very sorry, but your defence  will not avail you, your account is too large for one  Justice, any sum over three pounds must be sued before  two magistrates--but I only want to offset as much as  will pay the board--it can't be done in this shape, said  the magistrate; I will consult Justice Dolittle, my  neighbour, and if Mr. Hare won't settle with you, I will  sue it for you. Well, said Dennis, all I have to say  is, that there is not so big a rogue as Hare on the whole  river, save and except one scoundrel who shall be nameless,  making a significant and humble bow to the Justice. Here  there was a general laugh throughout the Court--Dennis  retired to the next room to indemnify himself by another  glass of grog, and venting his abuse against Hare and  the Magistrate. Disgusted at the gross partiality of the  Justice, I also quitted the Court, fully concurring in  the opinion, though not in the language, that Dennis was  giving utterance to in the bar room.    Pettifog owed his elevation to his interest at an election.  It is to be hoped that his subsequent merits will be as  promptly rewarded, by his dismissal from a bench which  he disgraces and defiles by his presence.          No. VI    Anecdotes.    As we mounted our horses to proceed to Amherst, groups  of country people were to be seen standing about Pugnose's  inn, talking over the events of the morning, while others  were dispersing to their several homes. A pretty prime  superfine scoundrel, that Pettifog, said the Clockmaker;  he and his constable are well mated, and they've travelled  in the same gear so long together, that they make about  as nice a yoke of rascals, as you'll meet in a day's  ride. They pull together like one rope reeved through  two blocks. That are constable was een almost strangled  t'other day; and if he had'nt had a little grain more  wit than his master, I guess he'd had his wind-pipe  stopped as tight as a bladder. There is an outlaw of a  feller here, for all the world like one of our Kentucky  Squatters, one Bill Smith--a critter that neither fears  man nor devil. Sheriff and constable can make no hand of  him--they can't catch him no how; and if they do come up  with him, he slips through their fingers like an eel:  and then, he goes armed, and he can knock the eye out of  a squirrel with a ball, at fifty yards hand running--a  regular ugly customer. Well, Nabb, the constable, had a  writ agin him, and he was cyphering a good while how he  should catch him; at last he hit on a plan that he thought  was pretty clever, and he scheemed for a chance to try  it. So one day he heard that Bill was up at Pugnose's  Inn, a settling some business, and was likely to be there  all night. Nabb waits till it was considerable late in  the evening, and then he takes his horse and rides down  to the inn, and hitches his beast behind the hay stack.  Then he crawls up to the window and peeps in, and watches  there till Bill should go to bed, thinking the best way  to catch them are sort of animals is to catch them asleep.  Well, he kept Nabb a waiting outside so long, with his  talking and singing, that he well nigh fell asleep fist  himself; at last Bill began to strip for bed. First he  takes out a long pocket pistol, examines the priming,  and lays it down on the table, near the head of the bed.    When Nabb sees this, he begins to creep like all over,  and feel kinder ugly, and rather sick of his job; but  when he seed him jump into bed, and heerd him snore out  a noise like a man driving pigs to market, he plucked up  courage, and thought he might do it easy arter all if he  was to open the door softly, and make one spring on him  afore he could wake. So round he goes, lifts up the latch  of his door as soft as soap, and makes a jump right atop  of him, as he lay on the bed. I guess I got you this  time, said Nabb: I guess so too, said Bill, but I wish  you would'nt lay so plaguy heavy on me--jist turn over,  that's a good fellow, will you? With that Bill lays his  arm on him to raise him up, for he said he was squeezed  as flat as a pancake, and afore Nabb knew where he was,  Bill rolled him right over and was atop of him. Then he  seized him by the throat, and twisted his pipe till his  eyes were, as big as saucers, and his tongue grew six  inches longer, while he kept making faces for all the  world like the pirate that was hanged on Monument Hill  at Boston. It was pretty near over with him, when Nabb  thought of his spurs; so he just curled up both heels,  and drove the spurs right into him; he let him have it  jist below his cruper; as Bill was naked he had a fair  chance, and he ragged him like the leaf of a book cut  open with your finger. At last, Bill could stand it no  longer; he let go his hold and roared like a bull, and  clapping both hands ahind him, he out of the door like  a shot. If it had'nt been for them are spurs, I guess  Bill would have saved the hangman a job of Nabb that  time.    The Clockmaker was an observing man, and communicative.  Nothing escaped his notice; he knew every body's genealogy,  history and means, and like a driver of an English Stage  Coach, was not unwilling to impart what he knew. Do you  see that snug looking house there, said he, with a short  sarce garden afore it, that belongs to Elder Thomson.  The Elder is pretty close fisted, and holds special fast  to all he gets. He is a just man and very pious, but I  have observed when a man becomes near about too good, he  is apt, sometimes, to slip a head into avarice, unless  he looks sharp arter his girths. A friend of mine in  Connecticut, an old sea Captain, who was once let in for  it pretty deep, by a man with a broader brim than common,  said to me, friend Sam, says he, \"I don't like those  folks who are too d--n good.\" There is, I expect, some  truth in it, tho' he need'nt have swore at all, but he  was an awful hand to swear. Howsomever that may be, there  is a story about the Elder, that's not so coarse neither.  It appears, an old Minister came there once, to hold a  meetin at his house--well, after meetin was over, the  Elder took the minister all over his farm, which is pretty  tidy, I tell you; and he shewed him a great Ox he had,  and a swingeing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/582"],[0,"A Collection of Beatrix Potter Stories (#5)"],[1,"and began to climb the  hill; the tracks of Tommy Brock were plainly to be seen. He seemed to  have put down the sack every dozen yards, to rest.    \"He must be very puffed; we are close behind him, by the scent. What a  nasty person!\" said Peter.    The sunshine was still warm and slanting on the hill pastures. Half way  up, Cottontail was sitting in her doorway, with four or five half-grown  little rabbits playing about her; one black and the others brown.    Cottontail had seen Tommy Brock passing in the distance. Asked whether  her husband was at home she replied that Tommy Brock had rested twice  while she watched him.    He had nodded, and pointed to the sack, and seemed doubled up with  laughing.--\"Come away, Peter; he will be cooking them; come quicker!\"  said Benjamin Bunny.    They climbed up and up;--\"He was at home; I saw his black ears peeping  out of the hole.\" \"They live too near the rocks to quarrel with their  neighbours. Come on Cousin Benjamin!\"    When they came near the wood at the top of Bull Banks, they went  cautiously. The trees grew amongst heaped up rocks; and there, beneath a  crag--Mr. Tod had made one of his homes. It was at the top of a steep  bank; the rocks and bushes overhung it. The rabbits crept up carefully,  listening and peeping.    This house was something between a cave, a prison, and a tumble-down  pig-stye. There was a strong door, which was shut and locked.    The setting sun made the window panes glow like red flame; but the  kitchen fire was not alight. It was neatly laid with dry sticks, as the  rabbits could see, when they peeped through the window.    Benjamin sighed with relief.    But there were preparations upon the kitchen table which made him  shudder. There was an immense empty pie-dish of blue willow pattern, and  a large carving knife and fork, and a chopper.    At the other end of the table was a partly unfolded tablecloth, a plate,  a tumbler, a knife and fork, salt-cellar, mustard and a chair--in short,  preparations for one person's supper.    No person was to be seen, and no young rabbits. The kitchen was empty  and silent; the clock had run down. Peter and Benjamin flattened their  noses against the window, and stared into the dusk.    Then they scrambled round the rocks to the other side of the house. It  was damp and smelly, and over-grown with thorns and briars.    The rabbits shivered in their shoes.    \"Oh my poor rabbit babies! What a dreadful place; I shall never see them  again!\" sighed Benjamin.    They crept up to the bedroom window. It was closed and bolted like the  kitchen. But there were signs that this window had been recently open;  the cobwebs were disturbed, and there were fresh dirty footmarks upon  the window-sill.    The room inside was so dark, that at first they could make out nothing;  but they could hear a noise--a slow deep regular snoring grunt. And as  their eyes became accustomed to the darkness, they perceived that  somebody was asleep on Mr. Tod's bed, curled up under the blanket.--\"He  has gone to bed in his boots,\" whispered Peter.    Benjamin, who was all of a twitter, pulled Peter off the window-sill.    Tommy Brock's snores continued, grunty and regular from Mr. Tod's bed.  Nothing could be seen of the young family.    The sun had set; an owl began to hoot in the wood. There were many  unpleasant things lying about, that had much better have been buried;  rabbit bones and skulls, and chickens' legs and other horrors. It was a  shocking place, and very dark.    They went back to the front of the house, and tried in every way to move  the bolt of the kitchen window. They tried to push up a rusty nail  between the window sashes; but it was of no use, especially without a  light.    They sat side by side outside the window, whispering and listening.    In half an hour the moon rose over the wood. It shone full and clear and  cold, upon the house amongst the rocks, and in at the kitchen window.  But alas, no little rabbit babies were to be seen!    The moonbeams twinkled on the carving knife and the pie dish, and made a  path of brightness across the dirty floor.    The light showed a little door in a wall beside the kitchen fireplace--a  little iron door belonging to a brick oven, of that old-fashioned sort  that used to be heated with faggots of wood.    And presently at the same moment Peter and Benjamin noticed that  whenever they shook the window--the little door opposite shook in  answer. The young family were alive; shut up in the oven!    Benjamin was so excited that it was a mercy he did not awake Tommy  Brock, whose snores continued solemnly in Mr. Tod's bed.    But there really was not very much comfort in the discovery. They could  not open the window; and although the young family was alive--the little  rabbits were quite incapable of letting themselves out; they were not  old enough to crawl.    After much whispering, Peter and Benjamin decided to dig a tunnel. They  began to burrow a yard or two lower down the bank. They hoped that they  might be able to work between the large stones under the house; the  kitchen floor was so dirty that it was impossible to say whether it was  made of earth or flags.    They dug and dug for hours. They could not tunnel straight on account of  stones; but by the end of the night they were under the kitchen floor.  Benjamin was on his back, scratching upwards. Peter's claws were worn  down; he was outside the tunnel, shuffling sand away. He called out that  it was morning--sunrise; and that the jays were making a noise down  below in the woods.    Benjamin Bunny came out of the dark tunnel, shaking the sand from his  ears; he cleaned his face with his paws. Every minute the sun shone  warmer on the top of the hill. In the valley there was a sea of white  mist, with golden tops of trees showing through.    Again from the fields down below in the mist there came the angry cry of  a jay--followed by the sharp yelping bark of a fox!    Then those two rabbits lost their heads completely. They did the most  foolish thing that they could have done. They rushed into their short  new tunnel, and hid themselves at the top end of it, under Mr. Tod's  kitchen floor.    Mr. Tod was coming up Bull Banks, and he was in the very worst of  tempers. First he had been upset by breaking the plate. It was his own  fault; but it was a china plate, the last of the dinner service that had  belonged to his grandmother, old Vixen Tod. Then the midges had been  very bad. And he had failed to catch a hen pheasant on her nest; and it  had contained only five eggs, two of them addled. Mr. Tod had had an  unsatisfactory night.    As usual, when out of humour, he determined to move house. First he  tried the pollard willow, but it was damp; and the otters had left a  dead fish near it. Mr. Tod likes nobody's leavings but his own.    He made his way up the hill; his temper was not improved by noticing  unmistakable marks of badger. No one else grubs up the moss so wantonly  as Tommy Brock.    Mr. Tod slapped his stick upon the earth and fumed; he guessed where  Tommy Brock had gone to. He was further annoyed by the jay bird which  followed him persistently. It flew from tree to tree and scolded,  warning every rabbit within hearing that either a cat or a fox was  coming up the plantation. Once when it flew screaming over his head--Mr.  Tod snapped at it, and barked.    He approached his house very carefully, with a large rusty key. He  sniffed and his whiskers bristled. The house was locked up, but Mr. Tod  had his doubts whether it was empty. He turned the rusty key in the  lock; the rabbits below could hear it. Mr. Tod opened the door  cautiously and went in.    The sight that met Mr. Tod's eyes in Mr. Tod's kitchen made Mr. Tod  furious. There was Mr. Tod's chair, and Mr. Tod's pie dish, and his  knife and fork and mustard and salt cellar and his table-cloth that he  had left folded up in the dresser--all set out for supper (or  breakfast)--without doubt for that odious Tommy Brock.    There was a smell of fresh earth and dirty badger, which fortunately  overpowered all smell of rabbit.    But what absorbed Mr. Tod's attention was a noise--a deep slow regular  snoring grunting noise, coming from his own bed.    He peeped through the hinges of the half-open bedroom door. Then he  turned and came out of the house in a hurry. His whiskers bristled and  his coat-collar stood on end with rage.    For the next twenty minutes Mr. Tod kept creeping cautiously into the  house, and retreating hurriedly out again. By degrees he ventured  further in--right into the bedroom. When he was outside the house, he  scratched up the earth with fury. But when he was inside--he did not  like the look of Tommy Brock's teeth.    He was lying on his back with his mouth open, grinning from ear to ear.  He snored peacefully and regularly; but one eye was not perfectly shut.    Mr. Tod came in and out of the bedroom. Twice he brought in his  walking-stick, and once he brought in the coal-scuttle. But he thought  better of it, and took them away.    When he came back after removing the coal-scuttle, Tommy Brock was lying  a little more sideways; but he seemed even sounder asleep. He was an  incurably indolent person; he was not in the least afraid of Mr. Tod; he  was simply too lazy and comfortable to move.    Mr. Tod came back yet again into the bedroom with a clothes line. He  stood a minute watching Tommy Brock and listening attentively to the  snores. They were very loud indeed, but seemed quite natural.    Mr. Tod turned his back towards the bed, and undid the window. It  creaked; he turned round with a jump. Tommy Brock, who had opened one  eye--shut it hastily. The snores continued.    Mr. Tod's proceedings were peculiar, and rather uneasy, (because the bed  was between the window and the door of the bedroom). He opened the  window a little way, and pushed out the greater part of the clothes line  on to the window"]]]
