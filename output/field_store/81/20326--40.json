Stevenson I knew well as a lad and often met him and talked     with him.  He acted in private theatricals got up by the late     Professor Fleeming Jenkin.  But he had then, as always, a pretty guid     conceit o' himsel'--which his clique have done nothing to check.  His     father and his grandfather (I have danced with his mother before her     marriage) I knew better; but 'the family theologian,' as some of R. L.     Stevenson's friends dabbed his father, was a very touchy theologian,     and denounced any one who in the least differed from his extreme     Calvinistic views.  I came under his lash most unwittingly in this way     myself.  But for this twist, he was a good fellow--kind and     hospitable--and a really able man in his profession.  His father-in-     law, R. L. Stevenson's maternal grandfather, was the Rev. Dr Balfour,     minister of Colinton--one of the finest-looking old men I ever     saw--tall, upright, and ruddy at eighty.  But he was marvellously     feeble as a preacher, and often said things that were deliciously,     unconsciously, unintentionally laughable, if not witty.  We were near     Colinton for some years; and Mr Russell (of the _Scotsman_), who once     attended the Parish Church with us, was greatly tickled by Balfour     discoursing on the story of Joseph and Potiphar's wife, remarking that     Mrs P-'s conduct was 'highly improper'!\"    The estimate of R. L. Stevenson was not and could not be final in this  case, for _Weir of Hermiston_ and _Catriona_ were yet unwritten, not to  speak of others, but the passages reflect a certain side of Edinburgh  opinion, illustrating the old Scripture doctrine that a prophet has  honour everywhere but in his own country.  And the passages themselves  bear evidence that I violate no confidence then, for they were given to  me to be worked into any after-effort I might make on Stevenson.  My  friend was a good and an acute critic who had done some acceptable  literary work in his day.          CHAPTER III--THE CHILD FATHER OF THE MAN      R. L. Stevenson was born on 13th November 1850, the very year of the  death of his grandfather, Robert Stevenson, whom he has so finely  celebrated.  As a mere child he gave token of his character.  As soon as  he could read, he was keen for books, and, before very long, had read all  the story-books he could lay hands on; and, when the stock ran out, he  would go and look in at all the shop windows within reach, and try to  piece out the stories from the bits exposed in open pages and the  woodcuts.    He had a nurse of very remarkable character--evidently a paragon--who  deeply influenced him and did much to form his young mind--Alison  Cunningham, who, in his juvenile lingo, became \"Cumy,\" and who not only  was never forgotten, but to the end was treated as his \"second mother.\"  In his dedication of his _Child's Garden of Verses_ to her, he says:       \"My second mother, my first wife,     The angel of my infant life.\"    Her copy of _Kidnapped_ was inscribed to her by the hand of Stevenson,  thus:       \"TO CUMY, FROM HER BOY, THE AUTHOR.     SKERRYVORE, 18_th_ _July_ 1888.\"    Skerryvore was the name of Stevenson's Bournemouth home, so named after  one of the Stevenson lighthouses.  His first volume, _An Inland Voyage_  has this pretty dedication, inscribed in a neat, small hand:       \"MY DEAR CUMY,--If you had not taken so much trouble with me all the     years of my childhood, this little book would never have been written.     Many a long night you sat up with me when I was ill.  I wish I could     hope, by way of return, to amuse a single evening for you with my     little book.  But whatever you think of it, I know you will think     kindly of       THE AUTHOR.\"    \"Cumy\" was perhaps the most influential teacher Stevenson had.  What she  and his mother taught took effect and abode with him, which was hardly  the case with any other of his teachers.       \"In contrast to Goethe,\" says Mr Baildon, \"Stevenson was but little     affected by his relations to women, and, when this point is fully gone     into, it will probably be found that his mother and nurse in     childhood, and his wife and step-daughter in later life, are about the     only women who seriously influenced either his character or his art.\"     (p. 32).    When Mr Kelman is celebrating Stevenson for the consistency and  continuity of his undogmatic religion, he is almost throughout  celebrating \"Cumy\" and her influence, though unconsciously.  Here, again,  we have an apt and yet more striking illustration, after that of the good  Lord Shaftesbury and many others, of the deep and lasting effect a good  and earnest woman, of whom the world may never hear, may have had upon a  youngster of whom all the world shall hear.  When Mr Kelman says that  \"the religious element in Stevenson was not a thing of late growth, but  an integral part and vital interest of his life,\" he but points us back  to the earlier religious influences to which he had been effectually  subject.  \"His faith was not for himself alone, and the phases of  Christianity which it has asserted are peculiarly suited to the spiritual  needs of many in the present time.\"    We should not lay so much weight as Mr Kelman does on the mere number of  times \"the Divine name\" is found in Stevenson's writings, but there is  something in such confessions as the following to his father, when he  was, amid hardship and illness, in Paris in 1878:       \"Still I believe in myself and my fellow-men and the God who made us     all. . . . I am lonely and sick and out of heart.  Well, I still hope;     I still believe; I still see the good in the inch, and cling to it.  It     is not much, perhaps, but it is always something.\"    Yes, \"Cumy\" was a very effective teacher, whose influence and teaching  long remained.  His other teachers, however famous and highly gifted, did  not attain to such success with him.  And because of this non-success  they blamed him, as is usual.  He was fond of playing truant--declared,  indeed, that he was about as methodic a truant as ever could have  existed.  He much loved to go on long wanderings by himself on the  Pentland Hills and read about the Covenanters, and while yet a youth of  sixteen he wrote _The Pentland Rising_--a pamphlet in size and a piece of  fine work--which was duly published, is now scarce, and fetches a high  price.  He had made himself thoroughly familiar with all the odd old  corners of Edinburgh--John Knox's haunts and so on, all which he has  turned to account in essays, descriptions and in stories--especially in  _Catriona_.  When a mere youth at school, as he tells us himself, he had  little or no desire to carry off prizes and do just as other boys did; he  was always wishing to observe, and to see, and try things for  himself--was, in fact, in the eyes of schoolmasters and tutors something  of an _idler_, with splendid gifts which he would not rightly apply.  He  was applying them rightly, though not in their way.  It is not only in  his _Apology for Idlers_ that this confession is made, but elsewhere, as  in his essay on _A College Magazine_, where he says, \"I was always busy  on my own private end, which was to learn to write.  I kept always two  books in my pocket, one to read and one to write in!\"    When he went to College it was still the same--he tells us in the  funniest way how he managed to wheedle a certificate for Greek out of  Professor Blackie, though the Professor owned \"his face was not familiar  to him\"!  He fared very differently when, afterwards his father, eager  that he should follow his profession, got him to enter the civil  engineering class under Professor Fleeming Jenkin.  He still stuck to his  old courses--wandering about, and, in sheltered corners, writing in the  open air, and was not present in class more than a dozen times.  When the  session was ended he went up to try for a certificate from Fleeming  Jenkin.  \"No, no, Mr Stevenson,\" said the Professor; \"I might give it in  a doubtful case, but yours is not doubtful: you have not kept my  classes.\"  And the most characteristic thing--honourable to both men--is  to come; for this was the beginning of a friendship which grew and  strengthened and is finally celebrated in the younger man's sketch of the  elder.  He learned from Professor Fleeming Jenkin, perhaps unconsciously,  more of the _humaniores_, than consciously he did of engineering.  A  friend of mine, who knew well both the Stevenson family and the Balfours,  to which R. L. Stevenson's mother belonged, recalls, as we have seen, his  acting in the private theatricals that were got up by the Professor, and  adds, \"He was then a very handsome fellow, and looked splendidly as Sir  Charles Pomander, and essayed, not wholly without success, Sir Peter  Teazle,\" which one can well believe, no less than that he acted such  parts splendidly as well as looked them.    _Longman's Magazine_, immediately after his death, published the  following poem, which took a very pathetic touch from the circumstances  of its appearance--the more that, while it imaginatively and finely  commemorated these days of truant wanderings, it showed the ruling  passion for home and the old haunts, strongly and vividly, even not  unnigh to death:       \"The tropics vanish, and meseems that I,     From Halkerside, from topmost Allermuir,     Or steep Caerketton, dreaming gaze again.     Far set in fields and woods, the town I see     Spring gallant from the shallows of her smoke,     Cragg'd, spired, and turreted, her virgin fort     Beflagg'd.  About, on seaward drooping hills,     New folds of city glitter.  Last, the Forth     Wheels ample waters set with sacred isles,     And populous Fife smokes with a score of towns,     There, on the sunny frontage of a hill,     Hard by the house of kings, repose the dead,     My dead, the ready and the strong of word.     Their works, the salt-encrusted,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5921"],[0,"The History of Don Quixote, Volume 1, Complete (#5)"],[1,"fellows in the garden were exulting in  the thought that in a few moments more freedom would be within their  grasp, they found themselves surrounded by Turkish troops, horse and  foot. The Dorador had revealed the whole scheme to the Dey Hassan.    When Cervantes saw what had befallen them, he charged his companions to  lay all the blame upon him, and as they were being bound he declared  aloud that the whole plot was of his contriving, and that nobody else had  any share in it. Brought before the Dey, he said the same. He was  threatened with impalement and with torture; and as cutting off ears and  noses were playful freaks with the Algerines, it may be conceived what  their tortures were like; but nothing could make him swerve from his  original statement that he and he alone was responsible. The upshot was  that the unhappy gardener was hanged by his master, and the prisoners  taken possession of by the Dey, who, however, afterwards restored most of  them to their masters, but kept Cervantes, paying Dali Mami 500 crowns  for him. He felt, no doubt, that a man of such resource, energy, and  daring, was too dangerous a piece of property to be left in private  hands; and he had him heavily ironed and lodged in his own prison. If he  thought that by these means he could break the spirit or shake the  resolution of his prisoner, he was soon undeceived, for Cervantes  contrived before long to despatch a letter to the Governor of Oran,  entreating him to send him some one that could be trusted, to enable him  and three other gentlemen, fellow-captives of his, to make their escape;  intending evidently to renew his first attempt with a more trustworthy  guide. Unfortunately the Moor who carried the letter was stopped just  outside Oran, and the letter being found upon him, he was sent back to  Algiers, where by the order of the Dey he was promptly impaled as a  warning to others, while Cervantes was condemned to receive two thousand  blows of the stick, a number which most likely would have deprived the  world of \"Don Quixote,\" had not some persons, who they were we know not,  interceded on his behalf.    After this he seems to have been kept in still closer confinement than  before, for nearly two years passed before he made another attempt. This  time his plan was to purchase, by the aid of a Spanish renegade and two  Valencian merchants resident in Algiers, an armed vessel in which he and  about sixty of the leading captives were to make their escape; but just  as they were about to put it into execution one Doctor Juan Blanco de  Paz, an ecclesiastic and a compatriot, informed the Dey of the plot.  Cervantes by force of character, by his self-devotion, by his untiring  energy and his exertions to lighten the lot of his companions in misery,  had endeared himself to all, and become the leading spirit in the captive  colony, and, incredible as it may seem, jealousy of his influence and the  esteem in which he was held, moved this man to compass his destruction by  a cruel death. The merchants finding that the Dey knew all, and fearing  that Cervantes under torture might make disclosures that would imperil  their own lives, tried to persuade him to slip away on board a vessel  that was on the point of sailing for Spain; but he told them they had  nothing to fear, for no tortures would make him compromise anybody, and  he went at once and gave himself up to the Dey.    As before, the Dey tried to force him to name his accomplices. Everything  was made ready for his immediate execution; the halter was put round his  neck and his hands tied behind him, but all that could be got from him  was that he himself, with the help of four gentlemen who had since left  Algiers, had arranged the whole, and that the sixty who were to accompany  him were not to know anything of it until the last moment. Finding he  could make nothing of him, the Dey sent him back to prison more heavily  ironed than before.    The poverty-stricken Cervantes family had been all this time trying once  more to raise the ransom money, and at last a sum of three hundred ducats  was got together and entrusted to the Redemptorist Father Juan Gil, who  was about to sail for Algiers. The Dey, however, demanded more than  double the sum offered, and as his term of office had expired and he was  about to sail for Constantinople, taking all his slaves with him, the  case of Cervantes was critical. He was already on board heavily ironed,  when the Dey at length agreed to reduce his demand by one-half, and  Father Gil by borrowing was able to make up the amount, and on September  19, 1580, after a captivity of five years all but a week, Cervantes was  at last set free. Before long he discovered that Blanco de Paz, who  claimed to be an officer of the Inquisition, was now concocting on false  evidence a charge of misconduct to be brought against him on his return  to Spain. To checkmate him Cervantes drew up a series of twenty-five  questions, covering the whole period of his captivity, upon which he  requested Father Gil to take the depositions of credible witnesses before  a notary. Eleven witnesses taken from among the principal captives in  Algiers deposed to all the facts above stated and to a great deal more  besides. There is something touching in the admiration, love, and  gratitude we see struggling to find expression in the formal language of  the notary, as they testify one after another to the good deeds of  Cervantes, how he comforted and helped the weak-hearted, how he kept up  their drooping courage, how he shared his poor purse with this deponent,  and how \"in him this deponent found father and mother.\"    On his return to Spain he found his old regiment about to march for  Portugal to support Philip's claim to the crown, and utterly penniless  now, had no choice but to rejoin it. He was in the expeditions to the  Azores in 1582 and the following year, and on the conclusion of the war  returned to Spain in the autumn of 1583, bringing with him the manuscript  of his pastoral romance, the \"Galatea,\" and probably also, to judge by  internal evidence, that of the first portion of \"Persiles and  Sigismunda.\" He also brought back with him, his biographers assert, an  infant daughter, the offspring of an amour, as some of them with great  circumstantiality inform us, with a Lisbon lady of noble birth, whose  name, however, as well as that of the street she lived in, they omit to  mention. The sole foundation for all this is that in 1605 there certainly  was living in the family of Cervantes a Dona Isabel de Saavedra, who is  described in an official document as his natural daughter, and then  twenty years of age.    With his crippled left hand promotion in the army was hopeless, now that  Don John was dead and he had no one to press his claims and services, and  for a man drawing on to forty life in the ranks was a dismal prospect; he  had already a certain reputation as a poet; he made up his mind,  therefore, to cast his lot with literature, and for a first venture  committed his \"Galatea\" to the press. It was published, as Salva y Mallen  shows conclusively, at Alcala, his own birth-place, in 1585 and no doubt  helped to make his name more widely known, but certainly did not do him  much good in any other way.    While it was going through the press, he married Dona Catalina de  Palacios Salazar y Vozmediano, a lady of Esquivias near Madrid, and  apparently a friend of the family, who brought him a fortune which may  possibly have served to keep the wolf from the door, but if so, that was  all. The drama had by this time outgrown market-place stages and  strolling companies, and with his old love for it he naturally turned to  it for a congenial employment. In about three years he wrote twenty or  thirty plays, which he tells us were performed without any throwing of  cucumbers or other missiles, and ran their course without any hisses,  outcries, or disturbance. In other words, his plays were not bad enough  to be hissed off the stage, but not good enough to hold their own upon  it. Only two of them have been preserved, but as they happen to be two of  the seven or eight he mentions with complacency, we may assume they are  favourable specimens, and no one who reads the \"Numancia\" and the \"Trato  de Argel\" will feel any surprise that they failed as acting dramas.  Whatever merits they may have, whatever occasional they may show, they  are, as regards construction, incurably clumsy. How completely they  failed is manifest from the fact that with all his sanguine temperament  and indomitable perseverance he was unable to maintain the struggle to  gain a livelihood as a dramatist for more than three years; nor was the  rising popularity of Lope the cause, as is often said, notwithstanding  his own words to the contrary. When Lope began to write for the stage is  uncertain, but it was certainly after Cervantes went to Seville.    Among the \"Nuevos Documentos\" printed by Senor Asensio y Toledo is one  dated 1592, and curiously characteristic of Cervantes. It is an agreement  with one Rodrigo Osorio, a manager, who was to accept six comedies at  fifty ducats (about 6l.) apiece, not to be paid in any case unless it  appeared on representation that the said comedy was one of the best that  had ever been represented in Spain. The test does not seem to have been  ever applied; perhaps it was sufficiently apparent to Rodrigo Osorio that  the comedies were not among the best that had ever been represented.  Among the correspondence of Cervantes there might have been found, no  doubt, more than one letter like that we see in the \"Rake's Progress,\"  \"Sir, I have read your play, and it will not doo.\"    He was more successful in a literary contest at Saragossa in 1595 in  honour of the canonisation of St. Jacinto, when his composition won the  first prize, three silver spoons. The year before this he had been  appointed a collector of revenues for the"]]]
