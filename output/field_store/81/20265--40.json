An estimated 13 million      tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its      summer and winter resorts. Agricultural production is limited by a scarcity      of arable land, and most food has to be imported. The principal livestock      activity is sheep raising. Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes,      cigars, and furniture. The rapid pace of European economic integration is a      potential threat to Andorra's advantages from its duty-free status.

ALBERICH [_Invisible and laughing._          Ha! ha! ha!        Ha! ha! ha!        I thank thee, blockhead;    Thy work has stood the test.        Hoho! Hoho!        Nibelungs all        Bow now to Alberich!

[_Harshly._          Hoho! hoho!        Hearken, he nears:        The Nibelung's lord!            [_The pillar of cloud disappears in the background.          Alberich's scolding voice is heard more and more          faintly. Mime lies huddled up in pain. Wotan and          Loge come down through a cleft in the rock._    LOGE        Nibelheim here.

[Illustration: Plate 11, Mime writhes under the lashes he receives.]    LOGE [_Bends over Mime._          Why all this whimpering noise?    MIME          Ohé! Ohé!        Oh! Oh!

MIME          By evil arts        Fashioned Alberich        A yellow ring,        From the Rhinegold forged,        At whose mighty magic        Trembling we marvel;    This spell puts in his power    The Nibelung hosts of night.        Happy we smiths        Moulded and hammered,        Making our women        Trinkets to wear--    Exquisite Nibelung toys--    And lightly laughed at our toil.        The rogue now compels us        To creep into caverns,        For him alone        To labour unthanked.        Through the golden ring        His greed can divine        Where untouched treasure        In hidden gorge gleams.        We still must keep spying,        Peering and delving:        Must melt the booty,        Which, molten, we forge        Without pause or peace,    To heap up higher his hoard.    LOGE          Just now, then, an idler        Roused him to wrath?    MIME          Poor Mime, ah!        My lot was the hardest.        I had to work,        Forging a helmet,        With strict instructions        How to contrive it;        And well I marked        The wondrous might        Bestowed by the helm        That from steel I wrought.        Hence I had gladly        Held it as mine,        And, by its virtue    Risen at last in revolt:        Perchance, yes, perchance    The master himself I had mastered,    And, he in my power, had wrested    The ring from him and used it    That he might serve me, the free man,            [_Harshly_        As now"]]]
