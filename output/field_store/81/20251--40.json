[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/470"],[0,"Heretics (#5)"],[1,"these things are written,  briefly indeed, but quite legibly, on the visiting-card of Mr. Smith.  Yet our novelists call their hero \"Aylmer Valence,\" which means  nothing, or \"Vernon Raymond,\" which means nothing, when it is in their  power to give him this sacred name of Smith--this name made of iron and  flame. It would be very natural if a certain hauteur, a certain  carriage of the head, a certain curl of the lip, distinguished every  one whose name is Smith.  Perhaps it does; I trust so. Whoever else are  parvenus, the Smiths are not parvenus. From the darkest dawn of history  this clan has gone forth to battle; its trophies are on every hand; its  name is everywhere; it is older than the nations, and its sign is the  Hammer of Thor. But as I also remarked, it is not quite the usual case.  It is common enough that common things should be poetical; it is not so  common that common names should be poetical. In most cases it is the  name that is the obstacle. A great many people talk as if this claim of  ours, that all things are poetical, were a mere literary ingenuity, a  play on words. Precisely the contrary is true.  It is the idea that  some things are not poetical which is literary, which is a mere product  of words. The word \"signal-box\" is unpoetical.  But the thing  signal-box is not unpoetical; it is a place where men, in an agony of  vigilance, light blood-red and sea-green fires to keep other men from  death. That is the plain, genuine description of what it is; the prose  only comes in with what it is called.  The word \"pillar-box\" is  unpoetical. But the thing pillar-box is not unpoetical; it is the place  to which friends and lovers commit their messages, conscious that when  they have done so they are sacred, and not to be touched, not only by  others, but even (religious touch!) by themselves. That red turret is  one of the last of the temples.  Posting a letter and getting married  are among the few things left that are entirely romantic; for to be  entirely romantic a thing must be irrevocable. We think a pillar-box  prosaic, because there is no rhyme to it. We think a pillar-box  unpoetical, because we have never seen it in a poem.  But the bold fact  is entirely on the side of poetry. A signal-box is only called a  signal-box; it is a house of life and death. A pillar-box is only  called a pillar-box; it is a sanctuary of human words.  If you think  the name of \"Smith\" prosaic, it is not because you are practical and  sensible; it is because you are too much affected with literary  refinements.  The name shouts poetry at you. If you think of it  otherwise, it is because you are steeped and sodden with verbal  reminiscences, because you remember everything in Punch or Comic Cuts  about Mr. Smith being drunk or Mr. Smith being henpecked.  All these  things were given to you poetical. It is only by a long and elaborate  process of literary effort that you have made them prosaic.    Now, the first and fairest thing to say about Rudyard Kipling is that  he has borne a brilliant part in thus recovering the lost provinces of  poetry.  He has not been frightened by that brutal materialistic air  which clings only to words; he has pierced through to the romantic,  imaginative matter of the things themselves. He has perceived the  significance and philosophy of steam and of slang. Steam may be, if you  like, a dirty by-product of science. Slang may be, if you like, a dirty  by-product of language. But at least he has been among the few who saw  the divine parentage of these things, and knew that where there is  smoke there is fire--that is, that wherever there is the foulest of  things, there also is the purest. Above all, he has had something to  say, a definite view of things to utter, and that always means that a  man is fearless and faces everything. For the moment we have a view of  the universe, we possess it.    Now, the message of Rudyard Kipling, that upon which he has really  concentrated, is the only thing worth worrying about in him or in any  other man.  He has often written bad poetry, like Wordsworth.  He has  often said silly things, like Plato. He has often given way to mere  political hysteria, like Gladstone. But no one can reasonably doubt  that he means steadily and sincerely to say something, and the only  serious question is, What is that which he has tried to say?  Perhaps  the best way of stating this fairly will be to begin with that element  which has been most insisted by himself and by his opponents--I mean  his interest in militarism. But when we are seeking for the real merits  of a man it is unwise to go to his enemies, and much more foolish to go  to himself.    Now, Mr. Kipling is certainly wrong in his worship of militarism, but  his opponents are, generally speaking, quite as wrong as he. The evil  of militarism is not that it shows certain men to be fierce and haughty  and excessively warlike.  The evil of militarism is that it shows most  men to be tame and timid and excessively peaceable. The professional  soldier gains more and more power as the general courage of a community  declines.  Thus the Pretorian guard became more and more important in  Rome as Rome became more and more luxurious and feeble.  The military  man gains the civil power in proportion as the civilian loses the  military virtues. And as it was in ancient Rome so it is in  contemporary Europe. There never was a time when nations were more  militarist. There never was a time when men were less brave.  All ages  and all epics have sung of arms and the man; but we have effected  simultaneously the deterioration of the man and the fantastic  perfection of the arms. Militarism demonstrated the decadence of Rome,  and it demonstrates the decadence of Prussia.    And unconsciously Mr. Kipling has proved this, and proved it admirably.  For in so far as his work is earnestly understood the military trade  does not by any means emerge as the most important or attractive. He  has not written so well about soldiers as he has about railway men or  bridge builders, or even journalists. The fact is that what attracts  Mr. Kipling to militarism is not the idea of courage, but the idea of  discipline. There was far more courage to the square mile in the Middle  Ages, when no king had a standing army, but every man had a bow or  sword. But the fascination of the standing army upon Mr. Kipling is not  courage, which scarcely interests him, but discipline, which is, when  all is said and done, his primary theme.  The modern army is not a  miracle of courage; it has not enough opportunities, owing to the  cowardice of everybody else.  But it is really a miracle of  organization, and that is the truly Kiplingite ideal. Kipling's subject  is not that valour which properly belongs to war, but that  interdependence and efficiency which belongs quite as much to  engineers, or sailors, or mules, or railway engines. And thus it is  that when he writes of engineers, or sailors, or mules, or  steam-engines, he writes at his best.  The real poetry, the \"true  romance\" which Mr. Kipling has taught, is the romance of the division  of labour and the discipline of all the trades. He sings the arts of  peace much more accurately than the arts of war. And his main  contention is vital and valuable.  Every thing is military in the sense  that everything depends upon obedience.  There is no perfectly  epicurean corner; there is no perfectly irresponsible place. Everywhere  men have made the way for us with sweat and submission. We may fling  ourselves into a hammock in a fit of divine carelessness. But we are  glad that the net-maker did not make the hammock in a fit of divine  carelessness.  We may jump upon a child's rocking-horse for a joke. But  we are glad that the carpenter did not leave the legs of it unglued for  a joke.  So far from having merely preached that a soldier cleaning his  side-arm is to be adored because he is military, Kipling at his best  and clearest has preached that the baker baking loaves and the tailor  cutting coats is as military as anybody.    Being devoted to this multitudinous vision of duty, Mr. Kipling is  naturally a cosmopolitan.  He happens to find his examples in the  British Empire, but almost any other empire would do as well, or,  indeed, any other highly civilized country. That which he admires in  the British army he would find even more apparent in the German army;  that which he desires in the British police he would find flourishing,  in the French police. The ideal of discipline is not the whole of life,  but it is spread over the whole of the world.  And the worship of it  tends to confirm in Mr. Kipling a certain note of worldly wisdom, of  the experience of the wanderer, which is one of the genuine charms of  his best work.    The great gap in his mind is what may be roughly called the lack of  patriotism--that is to say, he lacks altogether the faculty of  attaching himself to any cause or community finally and tragically; for  all finality must be tragic.  He admires England, but he does not love  her; for we admire things with reasons, but love them without reasons.  He admires England because she is strong, not because she is English.  There is no harshness in saying this, for, to do him justice, he avows  it with his usual picturesque candour.  In a very interesting poem, he  says that--      \"If England was what England seems\"    --that is, weak and inefficient; if England were not what (as he  believes) she is--that is, powerful and practical--      \"How quick we'd chuck 'er! But she ain't!\"    He admits, that is, that his devotion is the result of a criticism, and  this is quite enough to put it in another category altogether from the  patriotism of the Boers, whom he hounded down in South Africa. In  speaking of the really patriotic peoples, such as the Irish, he has  some difficulty in keeping a shrill irritation out of his language. The  frame of mind which he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47109"],[0,"Gospel Doctrine: Selections from the Sermons and Writings of Joseph F. Smith (#5)"],[1," and until doubt and fear had been absolutely purged from me. He  did not have to send an angel from the heavens to do this, nor did he  have to speak with the trump of an archangel. By the whisperings of  the still small voice of the Spirit of the living God, he gave to me  the testimony I possess. And by this principle and power he will give  to all the children of men a knowledge of the truth that will stay  with them, and it will make them to know the truth, as God knows it,  and to do the will of the Father as Christ does it. And no amount of  marvelous manifestations will ever accomplish this. It is obedience,  humility, and submission to the requirements of heaven and to the order  established in the kingdom of God upon the earth, that will establish  men in the truth. Men may receive the visitation of angels; they may  speak in tongues; they may heal the sick by the laying on of hands;  they may have visions and dreams; but except they are faithful and pure  in heart, they become an easy prey to the adversary of their souls,  and he will lead them into darkness and unbelief more easily than  others.--_Apr. C. R.,_ 1900, pp. 40, 41.    HOW MAN LAYS AN IMPERISHABLE FOUNDATION OF TRUTH. But the men and  the women who are honest before God, who humbly plod along, doing  their duty, paying their tithing, and exercising that pure religion  and undefiled before {10} God and the Father, which is to visit the  fatherless and the widows in their afflictions and to keep oneself  unspotted from the world, and who help look after the poor; and who  honor the holy Priesthood, who do not run into excesses, who are  prayerful in their families, and who acknowledge the Lord in their  hearts, they will build up a foundation that the gates of hell cannot  prevail against; and if the floods come and the storms beat upon  their house, it shall not fall, for it will be built upon the rock of  eternal truth. I pray that this vast congregation will build upon this  imperishable foundation, upon the principle expressed by the words  of Joshua, \"as for me and my house, we will serve God,\" and as also  expressed by Job, \"though he slay me, yet will I trust in him.\" If you  have that spirit toward God and his work in these latter days, you will  build steadily and slowly, it may be, but surely, upon a foundation  that will endure throughout the countless ages of eternity. And if you  do not get any great manifestations, you need not worry about it. You  will get the testimony of Jesus Christ in your hearts, and you will  know God and Jesus whom he has sent, whom to know is life eternal, just  as well as those who receive visions. For those who do receive visions,  the devil will try to make them believe that they were delusions, and  if they commit sin, he will be sure to make them believe it. God bless  you, is my prayer. Amen.--_Apr. C. R.,_ 1900, p. 42.    REWARD OF ALL HONEST PEOPLE. In some instances you will find examples  of people out in the world who do not know as much as you do of the  gospel of Jesus Christ, who have not the testimony of the Spirit in  their hearts, as you have, of the divinity of Christ and of Joseph  Smith, who are just as devout, just as humble, just as contrite in  spirit, and as devoted to what they know, as some of us are, and they  will be rewarded according to their works, every one of them, and will  receive reward far surpassing anything that they dream of.--_Apr. C.  R.,_ 1912, p. 8.    {11} THE GOSPEL IS SIMPLE. Some subjects are in themselves, perhaps,  perfectly harmless, and any amount of discussion over them would  not be injurious to the faith of our young people. We are told, for  example, that the theory of gravitation is at best a hypothesis, and  that such is the atomic theory. These theories help to explain certain  things about nature. Whether they are ultimately true can not make  much difference to the religious convictions of our young people.  On the other hand, there are speculations which touch the origin of  life and the relationship of God to his children. In a very limited  degree that relationship has been defined by revelation, and until we  receive more light upon the subject we deem it best to refrain from the  discussion of certain philosophical theories which rather destroy than  build up the faith of our young people. One thing about this so-called  philosophy of religion that is very undesirable lies in the fact that  as soon as we convert our religion into a system of philosophy, none  but philosophers can understand, appreciate, or enjoy it. God, in  his revelation to man, has made his word so simple that the humblest  of men, without special training, may enjoy great faith, comprehend  the teachings of the gospel, and enjoy undisturbed their religious  convictions. For that reason we are averse to the discussion of certain  philosophical theories in our religious instructions.--_Juvenile  Instructor,_ Vol. 46, pp. 208, 209, April, 1911.    OUR KNOWLEDGE IS LIMITED. Our methods in speculation and reasoning  about the things of God may often be harmless; but if we depart from  the simplicity of God's word into a spirit of rationalism, we become  the victims of vanity, which endangers the true spirit of worship in  the human heart. It is not easy for men to give up their vanities, to  overcome their preconceived notions, and surrender themselves heart  and soul to the will of God which is always higher than their own. The  dangers of religious {12} speculations are as great today as they were  in the days of Christ, and if we would avoid these dangers we must  adhere to the simplicity of our religious beliefs and practices. When  men and women realize they are getting into deep water where their  footing is insecure, they should retreat, for they may be sure that  the course they have been taking will lead them more and more away  from their bearings which are not always easy to regain. The religion  of the heart, the unaffected and simple communion which we should hold  with God, is the highest safeguard of the Latter-day Saints. It is no  discredit to our intelligence or to our integrity to say frankly in the  face of a hundred speculative questions, \"I do not know.\"    One thing is certain, and that is, God has revealed enough to our  understanding for our exaltation and for our happiness. Let the Saints,  then, utilize what they already have; be simple and unaffected in their  religion, both in thought and word, and they will not easily lose their  bearings and be subjected to the vain philosophies of man.--_Juvenile  Instructor,_ Vol. 46, p. 269, May, 1911.    BLESSINGS FOR THE LOVE OF TRUTH. If you love the truth, if you have  received the gospel in your hearts, and love it, your intelligence  will be added upon, your understanding of truth will be expanded,  become larger than in any other way. Truth is the thing, above all  other things in the world, that makes men free--free from indolence  and carelessness, free from the fearful consequences of neglect, for  it will be a fearful consequence, if we neglect our duty before the  living God. If you will learn the truth and walk in the light of truth,  you shall be made free from the errors of men and of crafts; you will  be above suspicion and above wrong-doing of every description. God  will approve of you and bless you and your inheritances, and make you  prosper and flourish like a green bay tree.--_Improvement Era,_ Vol.  21, p. 102, December, 1917.    {13}        CHAPTER II    THE ETERNAL NATURE OF THE CHURCH, THE PRIESTHOOD, AND MAN    ETERNAL NATURE OF THE PLAN OF SALVATION. I feel this morning as I  have felt all my life, but I feel it stronger this morning, perhaps,  than ever before, that there is nothing under the heavens of so much  importance to me or to the children of men as the great plan of life  and salvation which was devised in the heavens in the beginning,  and which has been handed down from period to period through the  inspiration of holy men called of God until the day of the coming of  the Son of Man, for this gospel and this plan of salvation was revealed  to our first parents. The angel of God carried to them the plan of  redemption, and of salvation from death and sin that has been revealed  from time to time by divine authority to the children of men, and it  has undergone no change. There was nothing in it, in the beginning,  that was superfluous or unnecessary; nothing in it that could be  dispensed with; it was a complete plan devised in the beginning by  the wisdom of the Father and the holy ones for the redemption of the  human race and for their salvation and exaltation in the presence of  God. It was taught more fully, and exemplified more perfectly in the  being, the life and mission, the instruction and doctrine, of the Son  of God, than ever before, unless there may be an exception in the days  of Enoch; but through all the generations of time, the same gospel,  the same plan of life and salvation, the same ordinances, burial with  Christ, remembrance of the great sacrifice to be offered for the sins  of the world and for man's redemption, have been handed down from time  to time, from the time of the creation.--_Oct. C. R.,_ 1913, p. 2.    {14} GOSPEL PRINCIPLES ARE ETERNAL. Faith in God is an irrevocable  principle, just as much as \"thou shalt not kill;\" \"thou shalt not  steal;\" \"thou shalt not commit adultery.\" Repentance of a sin is an  eternal principle, and is as essential in its place, and is as much an  integral part of the gospel of Jesus Christ as: \"thou shalt not kill,\"  or, \"thou shalt have no other gods before me.\"    Baptism for the remission of sin, by one having authority, is an  eternal principle, for God devised it, and commanded it, and Christ  himself was not above obeying it; he had to obey it in order to fulfil  the law of righteousness.
