The next day, by hard  work, tacking up the wind, which still continued easterly, we  succeeded in reaching Bunder Héis, which, like the last place, was  occupied by the Musa Abokr. There were four small craft lying here,  waiting for cargoes, under lee of a spur of low hills which  constituted the harbour; in which, fortunately, there was very good  fishing to be obtained. We were detained here by adverse and light  winds two days, during which time I went on shore and paid my respects  to the Akil (chief) of the place, who lived in a small box-shaped  stone fort, on the west flank of the village of Héis, which was very  small, composed, as usual, of square mat huts, all built together, and  occupied only by a few women, who made mats, collected gums, and  stored the produce of the interior, as sheep, cows, and ghee, which  their men constantly brought down to them, for shipping off to  Arabia.[9] The Akil's reception was very warm and polite. He offered  me everything at his disposal, and gave as an honorary present a Dumba  sheep and a bowl of sour camel's milk, which I thought at the time the  most delicious thing I ever drank. It is sharp and rough, like  labourers' cider, and, drunk in the heat of the day, is most  refreshing. When first taken, and until the stomach becomes accustomed  to it, it operates like medicine, and I on this occasion was fairly  taken in. The fish we caught were not very good, but comical in  appearance, and of a great variety of the most beautiful prismatic  colours, changing in tint as different lights and shades struck upon  them.    We left Héis on the 25th, with very light and unfavourable winds, and  tracked along shore to the eastward, making very little way. The  weather continuing the same, on the 26th I forced the Nahkoda, much  against his will, on at night, as during the darker hours the winds  were much stronger, and by this means we arrived at our destination,  Bunder Gori on the Warsingali frontier, at sundown on the 27th of  October. I had now seen the Somali shore, and must confess I was much  disappointed. All that was visible, besides the village mentioned, was  a sandy tract of ground, the maritime plain, which extended in breadth  from the sea-shore to some brown-looking hills in the background, from  a few hundred yards to one or two miles distant; and hills and  plains--for I could, by my close approximation to them, only see the  brown folds of the hills near the base--were alike almost destitute of  any vegetation; whilst not one animal or any other living creature  could be seen.    28th October.--The Abban would not allow anybody to go on shore until  certain parties came off to welcome us and invite us to land, such  being the etiquette of the country when any big-wigs arrive. After the  sun rose we were duly honoured by the arrival of many half-naked  dignitaries, who tenderly inquired after the state of our health, the  prosperity or otherwise of our voyage, the purpose of our coming  there, and a variety of other such interesting matters. Then again  they were questioned by our people as to the state of the country,  whether in peace or war; how and where the Sultan Gerad Mahamed Ali  was residing; if rain had lately fallen, and where; if the cattle were  well in milk;--to which it was responded that everything was in the  most promising order; the cattle were flourishing in the hills, where  rain had lately fallen, about twenty miles distant from that place;  and the sultan, with all the royal family,[10] were there, revelling  on milk, under the shade of favouring trees, or reposedly basking in  the warm morning sun--the height of Somali bliss. The order was now  given to go ashore, and we all moved off to a fort which the Abban  said was his own property, in Goriat (little Bunder Gori), three miles  to the westward of Bunder Gori. There were two of these little forts  near, and a small collection of mat huts, like those already  described, and of the same material as all Somali forts and huts. The  kit was now brought across and placed within the fort I occupied, all  except the salt, which afterwards proved a bone of contention between  me and the Abban, and the sultan was at once sent for. No one could  move a yard inland, or purchase anything, without his sanction being  first obtained.    Although Gerad Mahamed Ali was living only twenty miles distant from  Goriat, it was not until repeated messages had been sent to him, and  eleven days had elapsed, that he answered the summons by his presence.  In the meanwhile, having nothing better to do during this tedious  interval, as no people would bring cattle or anything for sale, I took  walks about the plain, shooting, and killed a new variety of gazelle,  called Déra[11] by the Somali, and Salt's antelopes, here called  Sagaro, which fortunately were very abundant, though rather wild;  catching fish, drawing with the camera, bathing in the sea,  luxuriating on milk, dates, and rice, or talking and gossiping with  the natives.    On one occasion my interpreter came to me with a mysterious air, and  whispered in my ear that he knew of some hidden treasures of vast  amount, which had been buried not far off, under rocky ground, in such  a way that nobody had been able to dig them up, and he wished that I,  being an Englishman, and consequently knowing secret arts, as well as  _hikmat_ (scientific dodges), would direct how to search for these  treasures. By inquiring farther into the matter, it appeared that an  old man, a miser, who had been hoarding all his life, was suddenly  taken ill about forty years ago, and feared he would die. Seeing this,  his relatives assembled round him to ask his blessing; and the old  man, then fearing all his worldly exertions would end to no good  purpose, asked them to draw near that he might tell them where his  riches were hidden; but even then he would not disclose the secret,  until he was in the last dying gasp, when he said, \"Go to a pathway  lying between two trees, and stretch out a walking-stick to the full  length of your arm, and the place where the end of your wand touches  is that in which my treasures are hidden.\" The wretched man then gave  up the ghost, and his family commenced the search; but though they  toiled hard for many days and weeks, turning up the stones in every  direction, they never succeeded in finding the treasure, and had now  given up the search in despair. The fact was, they omitted to ask  their parent on which side of the path it was concealed, and hence  their discomfiture. At my request the said family came to me,  corroborated the statements of the interpreter, and begged imploringly  I would direct them how to search for the money; saying at the same  time they would work again, if I thought it of any use; and, moreover,  they would give me half if the search proved successful. I lent them  some English pick-axes, and went to see the place, which certainly  showed traces of very severe exertions; but the strong nature of the  soil was too much for them, even when armed with tools, unless they  were fortunate enough to hit upon the exact spot, which they did not,  and therefore toiled in vain again.    The Warsingali complained to me sadly of their decline in power since  the English had interfered in their fights with the Habr Teljala,  which took place near Aden about seven years ago, and had deprived  them of their vessels for creating a disturbance, which interfered  with the ordinary routine of traffic. They said that on that occasion  they had not only beaten the Habr Teljala, but had seized one of their  vessels; and that prior to this rupture they had enjoyed paramount  superiority over all the tribes of the Somali; but now that they were  forbidden to transport soldiers or make reprisals on the sea, every  tribe was on an equality with them.    They further spoke of the decline of their tribe's morals since the  time when the English took possession of Aden and brought in  civilisation with them. This they in most part attributed to our weak  manner in prosecuting crime, by requiring too accurate evidence before  inflicting punishment; saying that many a dishonest person escaped the  vengeance of law from the simple fact of there being no eyewitnesses  to his crime, although there existed such strong presumptive evidence  as to render the accusation proved. When speaking against our laws,  and about their insufficiency to carry out all governmental points  with a strong and spirited hand, they never forget to laud their own  sultan's despotic powers and equity in justice.    Of course no mortal man was like their Gerad Mahamed Ali. In leading  them to war he was like the English French,[12] and in settling  disputes he required no writing office, but, sitting on the woolsack,  he listened to the narration of prosecution and defence with his head  buried in his hands, and never uttering a word until the trial was  over, when he gave his final decision in one word only, ay or nay,  without comment of any sort. In confirmation of their statements, they  gave the description of a recent trial, when a boy was accused of  having attempted to steal some rice from a granary; the lad had put  his hand through a chink in the door of it, and had succeeded in  getting one finger, up to the second joint, in the grain; this, during  the trial, he frankly acknowledged having done, and the sultan  appointed that much of his finger exactly to be cut off, and no  more--punishing the deed exactly according to its deserts.
