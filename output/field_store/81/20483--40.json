He let the pinto go down the steep slope at a  walk, for there is nothing like a fast pace downhill to tear the heart  out of a horse. Besides, it came to him after he started, were not the  men of Bill Dozier apt to miss this sudden swinging of the trail?    In the floor of the valley he sent the pinto again into the stretching  canter, found the road, and went on with a thin cloud of the alkali dust  about him until the house rose suddenly out of the ground, a black mass  whose gables seemed to look at him like so many heads above the  tree-tops.          CHAPTER 6      The house would have been more in place on the main street of a town  than here in the mountain desert; but when the first John Merchant had  made his stake and could build his home as it pleased him to build, his  imagination harked back to a mid-Victorian model, built of wood, with  high, pointed roofs, many carved balconies and windows, and several  towers. Here the second John Merchant lived with his son Charles, whose  taste had quite outgrown the house.    But to the uneducated eye of Andrew Lanning it was a great and dignified  building. He reined the pinto under the trees to look up at that tall,  black mass. It was doubly dark against the sky, for now the first  streaks of gray light were pale along the eastern horizon, and the house  seemed to tower up into the center of the heavens. Andy sighed at the  thought of stealing through the great halls within. Even if he could  find an open window, or if the door were unlatched, how could he  find the girl?    Another thing troubled him. He kept canting his ear with eternal  expectation of hearing the chorus of many hoofs swinging toward him out  of the darkness. After all, it was not a simple thing to put Bill Dozier  off the trail. When a horse neighed in one of the corrals, Andy started  violently and laid his fingertips on his revolver butt.    That false alarm determined him to make his attempt without further  waste of time. He swung from the stirrups and went lightly up the front  steps. His footfall was a feathery thing that carried him like a shadow  to the door. It yielded at once under his hand, and, stepping through,  he found himself lost in utter blackness.    He closed the door, taking care that the spring did not make the lock  click, and then stood perfectly motionless, listening, probing the dark.    After a time the shadows gave way before his eyes, and he could make out  that he was in a hall with lofty ceiling. Something wound down from  above at a little distance, and he made out that this was the stairway.  Obviously the bedrooms would be in the second story.    Andy began the ascent.    He had occasion to bless the thick carpet before he was at the head of  the stairs; he could have run up if he had wished, and never have made a  sound. At the edge of the second hall he paused again. The sense of  people surrounded him. Then directly behind him a man cleared his  throat. As though a great hand had seized his shoulder and wrenched him  down, Andy whirled and dropped to his knees, the revolver in his hand  pointing uneasily here and there like the head of a snake laboring to  find its enemy.    But there was nothing in the hall. The voice became a murmur, and then  Andy knew that it had been some man speaking in his sleep.    At least that room was not the room of the girl. Or was she, perhaps,  married? Weak and sick, Andy rested his hand against the wall and waited  for his brain to clear. \"She won't be married,\" he whispered to himself  in the darkness.    But of all those doors up and down the hall, which would be hers? There  was no reasoning which could help him in the midst of that puzzle. He  walked to what he judged to be the middle of the hall, turned to his  right, and opened the first door. A hinge creaked, but it was no louder  than the rustle of silk against silk.    There were two windows in that room, and each was gray with the dawn,  but in the room itself the blackness was unrelieved. There was the one  dim stretch of white, which was the covering of the bed; the furniture,  the chairs, and the table were half merged with the shadows around them.  Andy slipped across the floor, evaded a chair by instinct rather than by  sight, and leaned over the bed. It was a man, as he could tell by the  heavy breathing; yet he leaned closer in a vain effort to make surer by  the use of his eyes.    Then something changed in the face of the man in the bed. It was an  indescribable change, but Andrew knew that the man had opened his eyes.  Before he could straighten or stir, hands were thrown up. One struck at  his face, and the fingers were stiff; one arm was cast over his  shoulders, and Andy heard the intake of breath which precedes a shriek.  Not a long interval--no more, say, than the space required for the lash  of a snapping blacksnake to flick back on itself--but in that interim  the hands of Andy were buried in the throat of his victim.    His fingers, accustomed to the sway and quiver of eight-pound hammers  and fourteen-pound sledges, sank through the flesh and found the  windpipe. And the hands of the other grappled at his wrists, smashed  into his face. Andy could have laughed at the effort. He jammed the shin  of his right leg just above the knees of the other, and at once the  writhing body was quiet. With all of his blood turned to ice, Andy  found, what he had discovered when he faced the crowd in Martindale,  that his nerves did not jump and that his heart, instead of trembling,  merely beat with greater pulses. Fear cleared his brain; it sent a  tremendous nervous power thrilling in his wrists and elbows. All the  while he was watching mercilessly for the cessation of the struggles.  And when the wrenching at his forearms ceased he instantly relaxed  his grip.    For a time there was a harsh sound filling the room, the rough intake of  the man's breath; he was for the time being paralyzed and incapable of  any effort except the effort to fill his lungs. By the glint of the  metal work about the bits Andy made out two bridles hanging on the wall  near the bed. Taking them down, he worked swiftly. As soon as the fellow  on the bed would have his breath he would scream. Yet the time sufficed  Andy; he had his knife out, flicked the blade open, and cut off the long  reins of the bridles. Then he went back to the bed and shoved the cold  muzzle of his revolver into the throat of the other.    There was a tremor through the whole body of the man, and Andy knew that  at that moment the senses of his victim had cleared.    He leaned close to the ear of the man and whispered: \"Don't make no loud  talk, partner. Keep cool and steady. I don't aim to hurt you unless you  play the fool.\"    Instantly the man answered in a similar whisper, though it was broken  with panting: \"Get that coat of mine out the closet. There--the door is  open. You'll find my wallet in the inside pocket and about all you can  want will be in it.\"    \"That's the way,\" reassured Andy. \"Keep your head and use sense. But it  isn't the coin I want. You've got a red-headed girl in this house.  Where's her room?\"    His hand which held the revolver was resting on the breast of the man,  and he felt the heart of the other leap. Then there was a current of  curses, a swift hissing of invective. And suddenly it came over Andy  that since he had killed one man, as he thought, the penalty would be no  greater if he killed ten. All at once the life of this prostrate fellow  on the bed was nothing to him.    When he cut into that profanity he meant what he said. \"Partner, I've  got a pull on this trigger. There's a slug in this gun just trembling to  get at you. And I tell you honest, friend, I'd as soon drill you as turn  around. Now tell me where that girl's room is?\"    \"Anne Withero?\" Only his breathing was heard for a moment. Then: \"Two  doors down, on this side of the hall. If you lay a hand on her I'll  live to--\"    \"Partner, so help me heaven, I wouldn't touch a lock of her hair. Now  lie easy while I make sure of you.\"    And he promptly trussed the other in the bridle reins. Out of a  pillowcase folded hard he made a gag and tied it into the mouth of the  man. Then he ran his hands over the straps; they were drawn taut.    \"If you make any noise,\" he warned the other, \"I'll come back to find  out why. S'long.\"          CHAPTER 7      Every moment was bringing on the dawn more swiftly, and the eyes of Andy  were growing more accustomed to the gloom in the house. He found the  door of the girl's room at once. When he entered he had only to pause a  moment before he had all the details clearly in mind. Other senses than  that of sight informed him in her room. There was in the gray gloom a  touch of fragrance such as blows out of gardens across a road; yet here  the air was perfectly quiet and chill. The dawn advanced. But all that  he could make out was a faint touch of color againt the pillow--and that  would be her hair. Then with astonishing clearness he saw her hand  resting against her breast. Andy stood for a moment with his eyes  closed, a great tenderness falling around him. The hush kept deepening,  and the sense of the girl drew out to him as if a light were brightening  about her.    He stepped back to the table against the wall, took the chimney from the  lamp, and flicked a match along his trousers, for in that way a match  would make the least noise. Yet to the hair-trigger nerves of Andy the  spurt and flare of the match was like the explosion of a gun. He lighted  the lamp, turned down the wick, and replaced the chimney. Then he turned  as though someone had shouted behind him. He whirled as he had whirled  in the hall, crouching, and he found himself looking straight into the  eyes of the girl as she sat up in bed.    Truly he did not see her face at first, but only the fear in it, parting  her lips and widening her eyes. She did not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9909"],[0,"Nightmare Abbey (#5)"],[1,"to her  presence at the summons of the billet, which she never failed to  send with many expressions of penitence and promises of amendment.  Scythrop's schemes for regenerating the world, and detecting his seven  golden candle-sticks, went on very slowly in this fever of his spirit.    Things proceeded in this train for several days; and Mr Glowry began  to be uneasy at receiving no intelligence from Mr Toobad; when one  evening the latter rushed into the library, where the family and the  visitors were assembled, vociferating, 'The devil is come among  you, having great wrath!' He then drew Mr Glowry aside into another  apartment, and after remaining some time together, they re-entered the  library with faces of great dismay, but did not condescend to explain  to any one the cause of their discomfiture.    The next morning, early, Mr Toobad departed. Mr Glowry sighed and  groaned all day, and said not a word to any one. Scythrop had  quarrelled, as usual, with Marionetta, and was enclosed in his tower,  in a fit of morbid sensibility. Marionetta was comforting herself at  the piano, with singing the airs of _Nina pazza per amore_; and the  Honourable Mr Listless was listening to the harmony, as he lay  supine on the sofa, with a book in his hand, into which he peeped at  intervals. The Reverend Mr Larynx approached the sofa, and proposed a  game at billiards.      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    Billiards! Really I should be very happy; but, in my present exhausted  state, the exertion is too much for me. I do not know when I have been  equal to such an effort. (_He rang the bell for his valet. Fatout  entered_.) Fatout! when did I play at billiards last?      FATOUT    De fourteen December de last year, Monsieur. (_Fatout bowed and  retired_.)      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    So it was. Seven months ago. You see, Mr Larynx; you see, sir. My  nerves, Miss O'Carroll, my nerves are shattered. I have been advised  to try Bath. Some of the faculty recommend Cheltenham. I think of  trying both, as the seasons don't clash. The season, you know, Mr  Larynx--the season, Miss O'Carroll--the season is every thing.      MARIONETTA    And health is something. _N'est-ce pas_, Mr Larynx?      THE REVEREND MR LARYNX    Most assuredly, Miss O'Carroll. For, however reasoners may dispute  about the _summum bonum_, none of them will deny that a very good  dinner is a very good thing: and what is a good dinner without a good  appetite? and whence is a good appetite but from good health? Now,  Cheltenham, Mr Listless, is famous for good appetites.      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    The best piece of logic I ever heard, Mr Larynx; the very best,  I assure you. I have thought very seriously of Cheltenham: very  seriously and profoundly. I thought of it--let me see--when did I  think of it? (_He rang again, and Fatout reappeared._) Fatout! when  did I think of going to Cheltenham, and did not go?      FATOUT    De Juillet twenty-von, de last summer, Monsieur. (_Fatout retired._)      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    So it was. An invaluable fellow that, Mr Larynx--invaluable, Miss  O'Carroll.      MARIONETTA    So I should judge, indeed. He seems to serve you as a walking memory,  and to be a living chronicle, not of your actions only, but of your  thoughts.      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    An excellent definition of the fellow, Miss O'Carroll,--excellent,  upon my honour. Ha! ha! he! Heigho! Laughter is pleasant, but the  exertion is too much for me.      A parcel was brought in for Mr Listless; it had been sent express.  Fatout was summoned to unpack it; and it proved to contain a new  novel, and a new poem, both of which had long been anxiously expected  by the whole host of fashionable readers; and the last number of a  popular Review, of which the editor and his coadjutors were in high  favour at court, and enjoyed ample pensions[5] for their services to  church and state. As Fatout left the room, Mr Flosky entered, and  curiously inspected the literary arrivals.      MR FLOSKY    (_Turning over the leaves._) 'Devilman, a novel.' Hm. Hatred--revenge--  misanthropy--and quotations from the Bible. Hm. This is the morbid  anatomy of black bile.--'Paul Jones, a poem.' Hm. I see how it is.  Paul Jones, an amiable enthusiast--disappointed in his affections--  turns pirate from ennui and magnanimity--cuts various masculine  throats, wins various feminine hearts--is hanged at the yard-arm! The  catastrophe is very awkward, and very unpoetical.--'The Downing Street  Review.' Hm. First article--An Ode to the Red Book, by Roderick  Sackbut, Esquire. Hm. His own poem reviewed by himself. Hm--m--m.      (_Mr Flosky proceeded in silence to look over the other articles  of the review; Marionetta inspected the novel, and Mr Listless the  poem._)      THE REVEREND MR LARYNX    For a young man of fashion and family, Mr Listless, you seem to be of  a very studious turn.      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    Studious! You are pleased to be facetious, Mr Larynx. I hope you do  not suspect me of being studious. I have finished my education. But  there are some fashionable books that one must read, because they are  ingredients of the talk of the day; otherwise, I am no fonder of books  than I dare say you yourself are, Mr Larynx.      THE REVEREND MR LARYNX    Why, sir, I cannot say that I am indeed particularly fond of books;  yet neither can I say that I never do read. A tale or a poem, now and  then, to a circle of ladies over their work, is no very heterodox  employment of the vocal energy. And I must say, for myself, that  few men have a more Job-like endurance of the eternally recurring  questions and answers that interweave themselves, on these occasions,  with the crisis of an adventure, and heighten the distress of a  tragedy.      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    And very often make the distress when the author has omitted it.      MARIONETTA    I shall try your patience some rainy morning, Mr Larynx; and Mr  Listless shall recommend us the very newest new book, that every body  reads.      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    You shall receive it, Miss O'Carroll, with all the gloss of novelty;  fresh as a ripe green-gage in all the downiness of its bloom. A  mail-coach copy from Edinburgh, forwarded express from London.      MR FLOSKY    This rage for novelty is the bane of literature. Except my works and  those of my particular friends, nothing is good that is not as old as  Jeremy Taylor: and, _entre nous_, the best parts of my friends' books  were either written or suggested by myself.      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    Sir, I reverence you. But I must say, modern books are very  consolatory and congenial to my feelings. There is, as it were, a  delightful north-east wind, an intellectual blight breathing through  them; a delicious misanthropy and discontent, that demonstrates the  nullity of virtue and energy, and puts me in good humour with myself  and my sofa.      MR FLOSKY    Very true, sir. Modern literature is a north-east wind--a blight of  the human soul. I take credit to myself for having helped to make it  so. The way to produce fine fruit is to blight the flower. You call  this a paradox. Marry, so be it. Ponder thereon.      The conversation was interrupted by the re-appearance of Mr Toobad,  covered with mud. He just showed himself at the door, muttered 'The  devil is come among you!' and vanished. The road which connected  Nightmare Abbey with the civilised world, was artificially raised  above the level of the fens, and ran through them in a straight line  as far as the eye could reach, with a ditch on each side, of which the  water was rendered invisible by the aquatic vegetation that covered  the surface. Into one of these ditches the sudden action of a  shy horse, which took fright at a windmill, had precipitated the  travelling chariot of Mr Toobad, who had been reduced to the necessity  of scrambling in dismal plight through the window. One of the wheels  was found to be broken; and Mr Toobad, leaving the postilion to  get the chariot as well as he could to Claydyke for the purpose of  cleaning and repairing, had walked back to Nightmare Abbey, followed  by his servant with the imperial, and repeating all the way his  favourite quotation from the Revelations.           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER VI      Mr Toobad had found his daughter Celinda in London, and after the  first joy of meeting was over, told her he had a husband ready for  her. The young lady replied, very gravely, that she should take the  liberty to choose for herself. Mr Toobad said he saw the devil was  determined to interfere with all his projects, but he was resolved  on his own part, not to have on his conscience the crime of passive  obedience and non-resistance to Lucifer, and therefore she should  marry the person he had chosen for her. Miss Toobad replied, _tres  posement_, she assuredly would not. 'Celinda, Celinda,' said Mr  Toobad, 'you most assuredly shall.'--'Have I not a fortune in my own  right, sir?' said Celinda. 'The more is the pity,' said Mr Toobad:  'but I can find means, miss; I can find means. There are more ways  than one of breaking in obstinate girls.' They parted for the night  with the expression of opposite resolutions, and in the morning the  young lady's chamber was found empty, and what was become of her Mr  Toobad had no clue to conjecture. He continued to investigate town and  country in search of her; visiting and revisiting Nightmare Abbey at  intervals, to consult with his friend, Mr Glowry. Mr Glowry agreed  with Mr Toobad that this was a very flagrant instance of filial  disobedience and rebellion; and Mr Toobad declared, that when he  discovered the fugitive, she should find that 'the devil was come unto  her, having great wrath.'    In the evening, the whole party met, as usual, in the library.  Marionetta sat at the harp; the Honourable Mr Listless sat by her and  turned over her music,"]]]
