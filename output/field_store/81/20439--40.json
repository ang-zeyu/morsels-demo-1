One of the younger apes, a huge, splendidly muscled brute, was edging  threateningly closer to the ape-man.  Through his bared fighting fangs  there issued a low, sullen growl.    Tarzan watched his every move, standing rigid as a statue.   To have  fallen back a step would have been to precipitate an immediate charge;  to have rushed forward to meet the other might have had the same  result, or it might have put the bellicose one to flight--it all  depended upon the young bull's stock of courage.    To stand perfectly still, waiting, was the middle course.   In this  event the bull would, according to custom, approach quite close to the  object of his attention, growling hideously and baring slavering fangs.  Slowly he would circle about the other, as though with a chip upon his  shoulder; and this he did, even as Tarzan had foreseen.    It might be a bluff royal, or, on the other hand, so unstable is the  mind of an ape, a passing impulse might hurl the hairy mass, tearing  and rending, upon the man without an instant's warning.    As the brute circled him Tarzan turned slowly, keeping his eyes ever  upon the eyes of his antagonist.  He had appraised the young bull as  one who had never quite felt equal to the task of overthrowing his  former king, but who one day would have done so.  Tarzan saw that the  beast was of wondrous proportions, standing over seven feet upon his  short, bowed legs.    His great, hairy arms reached almost to the ground even when he stood  erect, and his fighting fangs, now quite close to Tarzan's face, were  exceptionally long and sharp.  Like the others of his tribe, he  differed in several minor essentials from the apes of Tarzan's boyhood.    At first the ape-man had experienced a thrill of hope at sight of the  shaggy bodies of the anthropoids--a hope that by some strange freak of  fate he had been again returned to his own tribe; but a closer  inspection had convinced him that these were another species.    As the threatening bull continued his stiff and jerky circling of the  ape-man, much after the manner that you have noted among dogs when a  strange canine comes among them, it occurred to Tarzan to discover if  the language of his own tribe was identical with that of this other  family, and so he addressed the brute in the language of the tribe of  Kerchak.    \"Who are you,\" he asked, \"who threatens Tarzan of the Apes?\"    The hairy brute looked his surprise.    \"I am Akut,\" replied the other in the same simple, primal tongue which  is so low in the scale of spoken languages that, as Tarzan had  surmised, it was identical with that of the tribe in which the first  twenty years of his life had been spent.    \"I am Akut,\" said the ape.  \"Molak is dead.  I am king.  Go away or I  shall kill you!\"    \"You saw how easily I killed Molak,\" replied Tarzan.  \"So I could kill  you if I cared to be king.  But Tarzan of the Apes would not be king of  the tribe of Akut.  All he wishes is to live in peace in this country.  Let us be friends.   Tarzan of the Apes can help you, and you can help  Tarzan of the Apes.\"    \"You cannot kill Akut,\" replied the other.  \"None is so great as Akut.  Had you not killed Molak, Akut would have done so, for Akut was ready  to be king.\"    For answer the ape-man hurled himself upon the great brute who during  the conversation had slightly relaxed his vigilance.    In the twinkling of an eye the man had seized the wrist of the great  ape, and before the other could grapple with him had whirled him about  and leaped upon his broad back.    Down they went together, but so well had Tarzan's plan worked out that  before ever they touched the ground he had gained the same hold upon  Akut that had broken Molak's neck.    Slowly he brought the pressure to bear, and then as in days gone by he  had given Kerchak the chance to surrender and live, so now he gave to  Akut--in whom he saw a possible ally of great strength and  resource--the option of living in amity with him or dying as he had  just seen his savage and heretofore invincible king die.    \"Ka-Goda?\" whispered Tarzan to the ape beneath him.    It was the same question that he had whispered to Kerchak, and in the  language of the apes it means, broadly, \"Do you surrender?\"    Akut thought of the creaking sound he had heard just before Molak's  thick neck had snapped, and he shuddered.    He hated to give up the kingship, though, so again he struggled to free  himself; but a sudden torturing pressure upon his vertebra brought an  agonized \"ka-goda!\" from his lips.    Tarzan relaxed his grip a trifle.    \"You may still be king, Akut,\" he said.  \"Tarzan told you that he did  not wish to be king.  If any question your right, Tarzan of the Apes  will help you in your battles.\"    The ape-man rose, and Akut came slowly to his feet.   Shaking his  bullet head and growling angrily, he waddled toward his tribe, looking  first at one and then at another of the larger bulls who might be  expected to challenge his leadership.    But none did so; instead, they drew away as he approached, and  presently the whole pack moved off into the jungle, and Tarzan was left  alone once more upon the beach.    The ape-man was sore from the wounds that Molak had inflicted upon him,  but he was inured to physical suffering and endured it with the calm  and fortitude of the wild beasts that had taught him to lead the jungle  life after the manner of all those that are born to it.    His first need, he realized, was for weapons of offence and defence,  for his encounter with the apes, and the distant notes of the savage  voices of Numa the lion, and Sheeta, the panther, warned him that his  was to be no life of indolent ease and security.    It was but a return to the old existence of constant bloodshed and  danger--to the hunting and the being hunted.  Grim beasts would stalk  him, as they had stalked him in the past, and never would there be a  moment, by savage day or by cruel night, that he might not have instant  need of such crude weapons as he could fashion from the materials at  hand.    Upon the shore he found an out-cropping of brittle, igneous rock.  By  dint of much labour he managed to chip off a narrow sliver some twelve  inches long by a quarter of an inch thick.  One edge was quite thin for  a few inches near the tip.  It was the rudiment of a knife.    With it he went into the jungle, searching until he found a fallen tree  of a certain species of hardwood with which he was familiar.  From this  he cut a small straight branch, which he pointed at one end.    Then he scooped a small, round hole in the surface of the prostrate  trunk.  Into this he crumbled a few bits of dry bark, minutely  shredded, after which he inserted the tip of his pointed stick, and,  sitting astride the bole of the tree, spun the slender rod rapidly  between his palms.    After a time a thin smoke rose from the little mass of tinder, and a  moment later the whole broke into flame.   Heaping some larger twigs  and sticks upon the tiny fire, Tarzan soon had quite a respectable  blaze roaring in the enlarging cavity of the dead tree.    Into this he thrust the blade of his stone knife, and as it became  superheated he would withdraw it, touching a spot near the thin edge  with a drop of moisture.  Beneath the wetted area a little flake of the  glassy material would crack and scale away.    Thus, very slowly, the ape-man commenced the tedious operation of  putting a thin edge upon his primitive hunting-knife.    He did not attempt to accomplish the feat all in one sitting.  At first  he was content to achieve a cutting edge of a couple of inches, with  which he cut a long, pliable bow, a handle for his knife, a stout  cudgel, and a goodly supply of arrows.    These he cached in a tall tree beside a little stream, and here also he  constructed a platform with a roof of palm-leaves above it.    When all these things had been finished it was growing dusk, and Tarzan  felt a strong desire to eat.    He had noted during the brief incursion he had made into the forest  that a short distance up-stream from his tree there was a much-used  watering place, where, from the trampled mud of either bank, it was  evident beasts of all sorts and in great numbers came to drink.  To  this spot the hungry ape-man made his silent way.    Through the upper terrace of the tree-tops he swung with the grace and  ease of a monkey.  But for the heavy burden upon his heart he would  have been happy in this return to the old free life of his boyhood.    Yet even with that burden he fell into the little habits and manners of  his early life that were in reality more a part of him than the thin  veneer of civilization that the past three years of his association  with the white men of the outer world had spread lightly over him--a  veneer that only hid the crudities of the beast that Tarzan of the Apes  had been.    Could his fellow-peers of the House of Lords have seen him then they  would have held up their noble hands in holy horror.    Silently he crouched in the lower branches of a great forest giant that  overhung the trail, his keen eyes and sensitive ears strained into the  distant jungle, from which he knew his dinner would presently emerge.    Nor had he long to wait.    Scarce had he settled himself to a comfortable position, his lithe,  muscular legs drawn well up beneath him as the panther draws his  hindquarters in preparation for the spring, than Bara, the deer, came  daintily down to drink.    But more than Bara was coming.  Behind the graceful buck came another  which the deer could neither see nor scent, but whose movements were  apparent to Tarzan of the Apes because of the elevated position of the  ape-man's ambush.    He knew not yet exactly the nature of the thing that moved so  stealthily through the jungle a few hundred yards behind the deer; but  he was convinced"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8502"],[0,"Common Diseases of Farm Animals (#5)"],[1," enema, the rectum should be emptied out  with the hand and the nozzle of the syringe carried as far forward as  possible. The operator should be careful not to irritate or tear the wall  of the rectum.    Size of the Dose.--The doses recommended in the treatment of the different  diseases, unless otherwise stated, are for mature animals. The dose for a  colt one year of age is about one-third the quantity given the adult, two  years of age one-half, and three years of age two-thirds. In well-matured  colts a larger dose may be given. In cattle, the doses recommended are  about the same. In the smaller animals the size of the dose may be based on  the development and age of the animal. When the drug is administered at  short intervals or repeated, the size of the dose should be reduced. The  physiological action of some drugs may be changed by varying the size of  the dose.      QUESTIONS    1. Give a general description of preventive treatment.    2. By what channels may drugs be administered?    3. How are drenches administered?    4. How are solid drugs administered?    5. What kind of drugs are administered hypodermically?    6. What is an enema?    7.

PART II.--NON-SPECIFIC OR GENERAL DISEASES        CHAPTER IV    DISEASES OF THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM      The organs that form the digestive tract are the mouth, pharynx,  oesophagus, stomach, intestines and the annexed glands, viz.: the salivary,  liver, and pancreas. The development of these organs differs in the  different species of animals. For example, solipeds possess a small, simple  stomach and capacious, complicated intestines. Just the opposite is true of  ruminants. The different species of ruminants possess a large, complicated  stomach, and comparatively simple intestines. In swine we meet with a more  highly developed stomach than that of solipeds and a more simple intestinal  tract. Of all domestic animals the most simple digestive tract occurs in  the dog. These variations in the development of the different organs of  digestion, together with the difference in the character of the feed and  method of feeding, cause a variation in the kind of diseases met with in  the different species. The complicated stomach of ruminants predispose them  to diseases of this portion of the digestive tract. Because of their  complicated intestinal tract solipeds are prone to intestinal disease.    DISEASES OF THE MOUTH    GENERAL DISCUSSION.--The mouth is the first division of the digestive  tract. It is formed by the lips, cheeks, palate, soft palate, tongue and  teeth. Here the feed is acted on mechanically. It is broken up by the teeth  and moved about until mixed with the saliva and put into condition to pass  through the pharynx and along the oesophagus to the stomach. The mechanical  change that the feed is subject to is very imperfect in dogs. In the horse  it is a slow, thorough process, although greedy feeders are not uncommon.  The first mastication in the ox is three times quicker than in horses, but  the process of rumination is slow and thorough.    STOMATITIS.--Simple inflammation of the mouth is frequently met with in  horses. Ulcerative or infectious inflammation commonly occurs in young, and  occasionally in old, debilitated animals. This form of sore mouth will be  discussed along with other infectious diseases, and the following  discussion will be confined to the non-infectious form of the disease.    _The causes_ are irritation from the bit, sharp teeth, irritating drenches,  roughage that contains beards or awns of grasses and grains, and burrs that  wound the lining membrane of the mouth. Febrile, or digestive disorders, or  any condition that may interfere with feeding, may cause this disorder. In  the latter cases the mucous membrane of the mouth is not cleansed by the  saliva. Particles of feed may decompose and irritating organisms set up an  inflammation. Putrid or decomposed slops, hot feeds, irritating drenches  and drinking from filthy wallows are common causes of inflammation of the  mouth in hogs.    _The symptoms_ vary in the different cases and species. Slight or localized  inflammation of the mouth is usually overlooked by the attendant. Lampas of  horses may be considered a local inflammation involving the palate.  Lacerations of the cheek or tongue by the teeth, or irritating feed,  usually result in a slight interference with prehension and mastication and  more or less salivation. Salivation from this cause should not be confused  with salivation resulting from feeding on white clover.    In generalized inflammation of the mucous membrane, the first symptom  usually noticed is the inability to eat. On examining the mouth we find the  mucous membrane inflamed, hot and dry. A part may appear coated. In a short  time the odor from the mouth is fetid. Following this dry stage of the  inflammation is the period of salivation. Saliva dribbles from the mouth,  and in severe cases it is mixed with white, stringy shreds of epithelium  and tinged with blood. In less acute forms of the disease, we may notice  little blisters or vesicles scattered over the lining membrane of the lips,  cheeks and tongue.    The acute form of stomatitis runs a short course, usually a few days, and  responds readily to treatment. Localized inflammation caused by irritation  from teeth, or feeding irritating feeds, does not respond so readily to  treatment.    _The treatment_ is largely preventive and consists largely in removing the  cause. When the mouth is inflamed, roughage should be fed rather sparingly,  and soft feeds such as slops, mashes, or gruels given in place of the  regular diet. Plenty of clean drinking water should be provided. In the way  of medicinal treatment antiseptic and astringent washes are indicated. A  four per cent water solution of boric acid may be used, or a one-half per  cent water solution of a high grade coal-tar disinfectant. The mouth should  be thoroughly irrigated twice daily until the mucous surfaces appear  normal.    DEPRAVED APPETITE    A depraved appetite is met with in all species of farm animals, but it is  especially common in ruminants. It should not be classed as a disease, but  more correctly as a bad habit, or symptom of innutrition or indigestion.  The animals affected seem to have an irresistible desire to lick, chew and  swallow indigestible and disgusting objects.    _The common cause_ of depraved appetite is the feeding of a ration  deficient in certain food elements. A ration deficient in protein or in  salts is said to cause this disorder. Lack of exercise, or confinement,  innutrition, and a depraved sense of taste may favor the development of  this disease. For example, when sheep are housed closely they may contract  the habit of chewing one another's fleeces. Lambs are especially apt to  contract this habit when suckling ewes that have on their udders long wool  soiled with urine and faeces.    _The first symptom_ is the desire to chew, lick or eat indigestible or  filthy substances. Horses and cattle may stand and lick a board for an hour  or more; cattle may chew the long hair from the tails of horses; sheep may  nibble wool; sows may within a short time after giving birth to their pigs,  kill and eat them; chickens may pick and eat feathers. Innutrition may  accompany the abnormal appetite, as very frequently the affected animal  shows a disposition to leave its feed in order to eat these injurious and  innutritions substances. In ruminants, the wool or hair may form balls and  obstruct the opening into the third compartment, causing chronic  indigestion and death.    _The treatment_ consists in the removal of the cause. Feeding a ration that  meets the needs of the system, clean quarters and plenty of exercise are  the most important preventive lines of treatment. In such cases medicinal  treatment (saline and bitter tonics) may be indicated. It is usually  advisable to remove the affected animals from the herd or flock in order to  prevent others from imitating them.    DISEASES OF THE STOMACH    There is a remarkable difference in the development of the stomachs of  solipeds and ruminants.    The horse's stomach (Fig. 8) is simple and has a capacity of three or four  gallons. The left portion is lined with a cuticular mucous membrane, and  the right portion with a glandular mucous membrane that has in it the  glands that secrete the gastric juice. The most important digestive change  in the feed is the action of the gastric juice on the proteids and their  conversion into the simpler products, proteoses and peptones.    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Photograph of model of horse's stomach: left  portion, oesophagus, right portion, and intestine.]    [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Photograph of model of stomach of ruminant: rumen,  reticulum, omasum, and abomasum.]    [Illustration: FIG. 10.--A section of the wall of the rumen and reticulum,  showing the oesophageal groove: lips of groove; opening from  oesophagus; and opening into omasum.]    RUMINANTS have a compound stomach (Figs. 9 and 10). The capacity of the  stomach of the ox is between twenty and thirty gallons. The four  compartments into which it is divided are the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and  abomasum or true stomach. The rumen is the largest compartment, with a  capacity of more than twenty gallons. The reticulum is the smallest, with a  capacity of about one-half gallon.    After a brief mastication, the food passes directly to the _rumen_. Here it  is subjected to a churning movement that mixes and presses the contents of  the rumen forward in the direction of the oesophageal opening, where it is  ready for regurgitation. It is then carried back to the mouth, remasticated  and returned to the rumen. This is termed rumination. All food material  that is sufficiently broken up is directed toward the opening into the  third"]]]
