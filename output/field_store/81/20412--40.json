You will be all right in a day or two.\"    \"Is it possible that I am on the island where Robinson Crusoe spent his  lonely years?\"    \"It is so.\"    \"I can hardly believe it.\"    \"Nevertheless it is a fact.\"    \"If I ever get away from it I will read the story all over again.\"    The man laughed.    \"That's natural.    \"But do you live here alone?\"    \"Oh, no; there are six Chilian families here with me. But you are beating  me at asking questions, for you have learned all there is to be learned of  me, while I cannot name you from any descendant of old Adam.\"    Without further delay Jack told his companion the story of his adventures.          Chapter VI    A Terrible Mistake        Jack found Robinson Crusoe's island a pleasanter place than he had  expected. Among the ridges were many pretty valleys which were covered  with patches of woods or grass. Everything bore a peculiar hue of green,  from the groves of myrtle, pimento and corkwood to the grassy plots, the  natural fields of oats and even to the moss-covered rocks of the spinelike  mountains.    The coast, as far as he could see, overhung the sea or rose perpendicular  to such a height as to make it inaccessible, except at one place where a  rent in the wall allowed man to enter the almost sacred domain.    The rude, picturesque huts of Mr. Pearce and his associates stood in a  romantic valley, where the American told him had stood the \"castle\" of the  Crusoe inhabitant of the island, Alexander Selkirk, whose strange story  has been read the wide world over.    Jack had been at the island nearly a week, and he was looking forward to  an opportunity to go to the mainland in a few days, when Mr. Pearce  informed him that something singular had transpired during the night.    \"Though no vessel is in sight this morning, I am sure some one landed here  last night between midnight and daylight.\"    \"Do you think there is anything to fear from such a visit, providing some  one has been here?\" asked Jack.    \"I don't know. This island was used several years as a penal colony for  Chili, but an earthquake so upset things that the one hundred and fifty  odd prisoners escaped, and since that no one has been sent here. But it  has been the refuge of two or three outlaws since, as if the place had a  strange fascination for them. Perhaps they think it is a safe place to  flee to after what has occurred here. I have had no trouble with them  worth mentioning.\"    \"Do you think one came last night?\"    \"Looks like it. But I will find out before I am much older. I will get the  Chilians to go with us and we will explore the cells.\"    Jack was not kept in suspense long as to Mr. Pearce's meaning.    Upon reaching the foot of a bluff about half a mile from the ruins of what  looked like an old fort, but which was now embedded in banks of clay and  overgrown with moss and rank weeds, he found that the whole structure had  been built of stone.    \"It was done by the Chilian government in 1767,\" said Mr. Pearce, \"and was  undone by an earthquake in 1835. This you see here nearest was the front  wall of the main rampart. But here is the greatest wonder in the hillside.  This old building--fortress, as it might be truthfully called--was the  abode of the officers and their men who were stationed here to watch and  guard the island, while these other retreats which are marked by those  black mouths were used for an altogether different purpose.\"    Mr. Pearce pointed, as he spoke, to numerous dark openings in the side of  the hill, there being many completely hidden by the rank ferns hanging in  festoons at their entrance.    \"It was in these pits, dug into the earth to the depth of two or three  hundred feet, that the Chilian government confined their convicts, and  where, if all reports be true, they underwent tortures that made life a  living death. The earthquake tore down all the heavy doors, as if the  elements were in league with the poor captives, every one of whom thus  managed to escape.    \"It is in these places the fugitives who seek this island for safety  conceal themselves. We can find some sign at the mouth if any one has  entered a cell since yesterday.\"    He then led the way along the broken-down entrances of the underground  excavations, now occupied by bats, toads and vermin, but where once  miserable wrecks of manhood had found a terrible punishment for their  crimes.    A wild goat sprang out from one of the cells and bounded away, but no  trace of a human being was found, until at last Mr. Pearce stopped before  one cell which was reached by descending several stone steps.    \"This was one of the cells for exceptionally bad prisoners,\" said Mr.  Pearce. \"It is not as deep as some of the others, but reeks with a cold  sweat, and the air is so damp and chilly as to make one shiver the moment  he enters. Just think of the poor wretches confined here, where no ray of  sunlight could ever reach them, and no living soul to pity them in their  hopeless despair! This does not run into the earth more than twenty-five  feet. Your eyes are younger and sharper than mine; see if those are not  fresh footprints.\"    \"They are,\" replied Jack, as soon as he had made a hasty examination; \"and  I am sure they are made by an American shoe!\"    \"Whew!\" exclaimed Mr. Pearce, \"that makes it more mysterious, and it  behooves us to move with great caution. One of us had better remain on the  outside, while the other makes an exploration of the den. Which will you  do?\"    \"I will go inside, if it makes no difference to you, only I wish you would  let me have one of your pistols.\"    \"Of course, and you can take this knife, too. Move cautiously, for if  there is an American run to earth in there, you may count on it that he  will fight for his life. It will be different from facing one of those  Chilians, who make a good deal of noise and but a little resistance.\"    Jack promised to act with caution, and taking the weapons tended him by  his companion, he boldly pushed his way down the rough stairway leading to  the dark dungeon.    \"Give the signal at the least sign of danger, and I will be there in a  trice,\" were Mr. Pearce's parting words. \"Meanwhile if you hear me  whistle, don't fail to come back as quickly as possible.\"    By this time Jack was at the foot of the descent, and parting the damp  ferns that overhung the mouth of the cell, he was about to enter the  dismal passage, when his foot struck something that rustled.    Reaching down in the darkness, his hand touched a sheet of paper or  parchment, which he picked up.    He had hardly done this before Mr. Pearce gave a shrill whistle, which  caused Jack to return to his side, wondering what had happened.    His surprise may be imagined when he saw a squad of armed men drawn up in  front of them!    \"They are Government soldiers in search of the fugitive,\" whispered Mr.  Pearce. \"Don't do anything rash if you value your life. Let me speak to  them.\"    A short consultation then followed in Spanish, the new-comers all the time  covering the twain with their cocked carbines.    Finally Mr. Pearce turned to Jack, saying: \"It is just as I thought. They  are looking for an escaped prisoner-an Englishman, or rather youth, as  they tell me. They think you are the one and demand your immediate  surrender. The best thing you can do is to give up without resistance. I  will stand by you when the time comes for the need of my help. They won't  believe a word I say now. See they are getting impatient. What answer  shall I give them?\"    Jack, who did not understand a word that they had said, realized from  their manner that he could expect no mercy from the Chilians. If Mr.  Pearce could not benefit him now, how could he later? Still his only  alternative seemed to be to surrender, upon the condition that he be given  fair treatment at the hands of the government.    But notwithstanding this stipulation, no sooner had he signified his  intention of yielding without resistance than he was roughly siezed and  bound. Then some of his captors dragged him back against the side of the  bluff. The leader gave a few words of command to his followers, who obeyed  by instantly bringing their firearms to their shoulders, pointed at Jack!    \"Great sun!\" exclaimed Mr. Pearce, his face turning white as marble as he  witnessed this summary threat, \"they mean to shoot you on the spot!\" He  had barely uttered these startling words before the leader of the squad  raised his right hand, as a signal for the marksmen to fire.          Chapter VII    A Plea of the Enemy        Jack realized that only a desperate effort could save him.    Mr. Pearce, whose friendship he had no reason to doubt, stood speechless  and horrified at the inhuman act of the Chilians, unable to lift a finger  if it would have saved his life.    Jack was standing near to the entrance of the convict cell and as the  Chilian commander raised a hand for his men to fire, he suddenly doubled  himself up like a jack-knife, turning a complete somersault in the  direction of the underground stairway.    His feet had not been secured, though his hands were fastened behind him.    Acting on the impulse of the moment, without any consideration for the  result other than an escape from the murderous fire, he plunged head-first  into the entrance at the very instant the volley of bullets sped on their  deadly mission.    So closely timed were the two actions that the Chilians mistook his jump  for the result of their shots, and an exclamation of satisfaction left the  leader's lips, while no immediate attempt was made to reach the side of  their victim. This enabled Jack to regain his feet and to disappear into  the dark mouth of the cavern before his enemies had recovered from their  surprise.    Though severely shaken up by his precipitation into this retreat,  unheeding the creeping"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7849"],[0,"The Trial (#5)"],[1," then nothing more would have happened, everything  that was waiting to happen would have been stifled.  People are so often  unprepared.  In the bank, for example, I am well prepared, nothing of  this sort could possibly happen to me there, I have my own assistant  there, there are telephones for internal and external calls in front of  me on the desk, I continually receive visits from people,  representatives, officials, but besides that, and most importantly, I'm  always occupied with my work, that's to say I'm always alert, it would  even be a pleasure for me to find myself faced with something of that  sort.  But now it's over with, and I didn't really even want to talk  about it any more, only I wanted to hear what you, as a sensible woman,  thought about it all, and I'm very glad to hear that we're in agreement.  But now you must give me your hand, an agreement of this sort needs to  be confirmed with a handshake.\"            Will she shake hands with me?  The supervisor didn't shake hands,  he thought, and looked at the woman differently from before, examining  her.  She stood up, as he had also stood up, and was a little self-  conscious, she hadn't been able to understand everything that K.  said.  As a result of this self consciousness she said something that  she certainly did not intend and certainly was not appropriate.  \"Don't  take it so hard, Mr. K.,\" she said, with tears in her voice and also, of  course, forgetting the handshake.  \"I didn't know I was taking it hard,\"  said K., feeling suddenly tired and seeing that if this woman did agree  with him it was of very little value.            Before going out the door he asked, \"Is Miss Buerstner home?\"  \"No,\" said Mrs. Grubach, smiling as she gave this simple piece of  information, saying something sensible at last.  \"She's at the theatre.  Did you want to see her?  Should I give her a message?\"  \"I, er, I just  wanted to have a few words with her.\"  \"I'm afraid I don't know when  she's coming in; she usually gets back late when she's been to the  theatre.\"  \"It really doesn't matter,\" said K. his head hanging as he  turned to the door to leave, \"I just wanted to give her my apology for  taking over her room today.\"  \"There's no need for that, Mr. K., you're  too conscientious, the young lady doesn't know anything about it, she  hasn't been home since early this morning and everything's been tidied  up again, you can see for yourself.\"  And she opened the door to Miss  Buerstner's room.  \"Thank you, I'll take your word for it,\" said K, but  went nonetheless over to the open door.  The moon shone quietly into the  unlit room.  As far as could be seen, everything was indeed in its  place, not even the blouse was hanging on the window handle.  The  pillows on the bed looked remarkably plump as they lay half in the  moonlight.  \"Miss Buerstner often comes home late,\" said K., looking at  Mrs. Grubach as if that were her responsibility.  \"That's how young  people are!\" said Mrs. Grubach to excuse herself.  \"Of course, of  course,\" said K., \"but it can be taken too far.\"  \"Yes, it can be,\" said  Mrs. Grubach, \"you're so right, Mr. K.  Perhaps it is in this case.  I  certainly wouldn't want to say anything nasty about Miss Buerstner, she  is a good, sweet girl, friendly, tidy, punctual, works hard, I  appreciate all that very much, but one thing is true, she ought to have  more pride, be a bit less forthcoming.  Twice this month already, in the  street over the way, I've seen her with a different gentleman.  I really  don't like saying this, you're the only one I've said this to, Mr. K., I  swear to God, but I'm going to have no choice but to have a few words  with Miss Buerstner about it myself.  And it's not the only thing about  her that I'm worried about.\"  \"Mrs. Grubach, you are on quite the wrong  track,\" said K., so angry that he was hardly able to hide it, \"and you  have moreover misunderstood what I was saying about Miss Buerstner, that  is not what I meant.  In fact I warn you quite directly not to say  anything to her, you are quite mistaken, I know Miss Buerstner very well  and there is no truth at all in what you say.  And what's more, perhaps  I'm going to far, I don't want to get in your way, say to her whatever  you see fit.  Good night.\"  \"Mr. K.,\" said Mrs. Grubach as if asking him  for something and hurrying to his door which he had already opened, \"I  don't want to speak to Miss Buerstner at all, not yet, of course I'll  continue to keep an eye on her but you're the only one I've told what I  know.  And it is, after all something that everyone who lets rooms has  to do if she's to keep the house decent, that's all I'm trying to do.\"  \"Decent!\" called out K. through the crack in the door, \"if you want to  keep the house decent you'll first have to give me notice.\"  Then he  slammed the door shut, there was a gentle knocking to which he paid no  more attention.            He did not feel at all like going to bed, so he decided to stay  up, and this would also give him the chance to find out when Miss  Buerstner would arrive home.  Perhaps it would also still be possible,  even if a little inappropriate, to have a few words with her.  As he lay  there by the window, pressing his hands to his tired eyes, he even  thought for a moment that he might punish Mrs. Grubach by persuading  Miss Buerstner to give in her notice at the same time as he would.  But  he immediately realised that that would be shockingly excessive, and  there would even be the suspicion that he was moving house because of  the incidents of that morning.  Nothing would have been more nonsensical  and, above all, more pointless and contemptible.            When he had become tired of looking out onto the empty street he  slightly opened the door to the living room so that he could see anyone  who entered the flat from where he was and lay down on the couch.  He  lay there, quietly smoking a cigar, until about eleven o'clock.  He  wasn't able to hold out longer than that, and went a little way into the  hallway as if in that way he could make Miss Buerstner arrive sooner.  He  had no particular desire for her, he could not even remember what she  looked like, but now he wanted to speak to her and it irritated him that  her late arrival home meant this day would be full of unease and  disorder right to its very end.  It was also her fault that he had not  had any dinner that evening and that he had been unable to visit Elsa as  he had intended.  He could still make up for both of those things,  though, if he went to the wine bar where Elsa worked.  He wanted to do  so even later, after the discussion with Miss Buerstner.            It was already gone half past eleven when someone could be heard  in the stairway.  K., who had been lost in his thoughts in the hallway,  walking up and down loudly as if it were his own room, fled behind his  door.  Miss Buerstner had arrived.  Shivering, she pulled a silk shawl  over her slender shoulders as she locked the door.  The next moment she  would certainly go into her room, where K. ought not to intrude in the  middle of the night; that meant he would have to speak to her now, but,  unfortunately, he had not put the electric light on in his room so that  when he stepped out of the dark it would give the impression of being an  attack and would certainly, at the very least, have been quite alarming.  There was no time to lose, and in his helplessness he whispered through  the crack of the door, \"Miss Buerstner.\"  It sounded like he was pleading  with her, not calling to her.  \"Is there someone there?\" asked Miss  Buerstner, looking round with her eyes wide open.  \"It's me,\" said K. and  came out.  \"Oh, Mr. K.!\" said Miss Buerstner with a smile. \"Good  Evening,\" and offered him her hand.  \"I wanted to have a word with you,  if you would allow me?\"  \"Now?\" asked Miss Buerstner, \"does it have to be  now? It is a little odd, isn't it?\"  \"I've been waiting for you since  nine o'clock.\"  \"Well, I was at the theatre, I didn't know anything  about you waiting for me.\"  \"The reason I need to speak to you only came  up today\"  \"I see, well I don't see why not, I suppose, apart from being  so tired I could drop.  Come into my room for a few minutes then.  We  certainly can't talk out here, we'd wake everyone up and I think that  would be more unpleasant for us than for them.  Wait here till I've put  the light on in my room, and then turn the light down out here.\"  K. did  as he was told, and then even waited until Miss Buerstner came out of her  room and quietly invited him, once more, to come in.  \"Sit down,\" she  said, indicating the ottoman, while she herself remained standing by the  bedpost despite the tiredness she had spoken of; she did not even take  off her hat, which was small but decorated with an abundance of flowers.  \"What is it you wanted, then?  I'm really quite curious.\"  She gently  crossed her legs.  \"I expect you'll say,\" K. began, \"that the matter really isn't all that  urgent and we don't need to talk about it right now, but ...\"  \"I never  listen to introductions,\" said Miss Buerstner.  \"That makes my job so  much easier,\" said K.  \"This morning, to some extent through my fault,  your room was made a little untidy, this happened because of people I  did not know and against my will but, as I said, because of my fault; I  wanted to apologise for it.\"  \"My room?\" asked Miss Buerstner, and  instead of looking round the room scrutinised K.  \"It is true,\" said K.,  and now, for the first time, they looked each other in the eyes,  \"there's no point in saying exactly how this came about.\"  \"But that's  the interesting thing about it,\" said Miss Buerstner.  \"No,\" said K.  \"Well then,\" said Miss Buerstner, \"I don't want to force my way into any  secrets, if you insist that it's of no interest I won't insist.  I'm  quite happy to forgive you for it, as you ask, especially as I can't see  anything at all that's been left untidy."]]]
