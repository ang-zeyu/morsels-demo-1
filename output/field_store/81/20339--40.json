They say she has a family of young wolves  up there; and that is why she kills so many lambs.\"    \"Here are the tracks again,\" said Putnam.    They could be seen very plainly, for here the ground was quite muddy.  The four men followed them for some distance, and then lost them on  the hillside.    \"Let us call the neighbors together and have a grand wolf hunt to-  morrow,\" said Putnam. \"We must put an end to this killing of lambs.\"    All the other men agreed to this, and they parted.        II      The next day twenty men and boys came together for the grand wolf hunt.  They tracked the beast to the mouth of a cave, far up on the hills.    They shouted and threw stones into the cave. But the wolf was too wise  to show herself. She lay hidden among some rocks, and nothing could  make her stir.    \"I will fetch her out,\" said Israel Putnam.    The opening to the cave was only a narrow hole between two rocks.  Putnam stooped down and looked in. It was very dark there, and he could  not see anything.    Then he tied a rope around his waist and said to his friends, \"Take  hold of the other end, boys. When I jerk it, then pull me out as  quickly as you can.\" He got down on his hands and knees and crawled  into the cave. He crawled very slowly and carefully.    At last he saw something in the darkness that looked like two balls  of fire. He knew that these were the eyes of the wolf. The wolf gave  a low growl and made ready to meet him.    Putnam gave the rope a quick jerk and his friends pulled him out in  great haste. They feared that the wolf was upon him; but he wished  only to get his gun.    Soon, with the gun in one hand, he crept back into the cave. The wolf  saw him. She growled so loudly that the men and boys outside were  frightened. But Putnam was not afraid. He raised his gun and fired at  the great beast. When his friends heard the gun they pulled the  rope quickly and drew him out. It was no fun to be pulled over the  sharp stones in that way; but it was better than to be bitten by the wolf.  Putnam loaded his gun again. Then he listened. There was not a sound  inside of the cave. Perhaps the wolf was waiting to spring upon him.  He crept into the cave for the third time. There were no balls of fire  to be seen now. No angry growl was heard. The wolf was dead.    Putnam stayed in the cave so long that his friends began to be alarmed.  After a while, however, he gave the rope a quick jerk. Men and boys  pulled with all their might; and Putnam and the wolf were drawn out  together.    This happened when Israel Putnam was a young man. When the  Revolutionary War began he was one of the first to hurry to Boston to  help the people defend themselves against the British soldiers. He  became famous as one of the bravest and best of the generals who fought  to make our country free.          THE HORSESHOE NAILS    I        A blacksmith was shoeing a horse.    \"Shoe him quickly, for the king wishes to ride him to battle,\" said  the groom who had brought him.    \"Do you think there will be a battle?\" asked the blacksmith.    \"Most certainly, and very soon, too,\" answered the man. \"The king's  enemies are even now advancing, and all are ready for the fight. To-  day will decide whether Richard or Henry shall be king of England.\"    The smith went on with his work. From a bar of iron he made four  horseshoes. These he hammered and shaped and fitted to the horse's  feet. Then he began to nail them on.    But after he had nailed on two shoes, he found that he had not nails  enough for the other two. \"I have only six nails,\" he said, \"and it  will take a little time to hammer out ten more.\"    \"Oh, well,\" said the groom, \"won't six nails do? Put three in each  shoe. I hear the trumpets now. King Richard will be impatient.\"    \"Three nails in each shoe will hold them on,\" said the smith. \"Yes,  I think we may risk it.\"    So he quickly finished the shoeing, and the groom hurried to lead the  horse to the king.        II      The battle had been raging for some time. King Richard rode hither and  thither, cheering his men and fighting his foes. His enemy, Henry, who  wished to be king, was pressing him hard.    Far away, at the other side of the field, King Richard saw his men  falling back. Without his help they would soon be beaten. So he spurred  his horse to ride to their aid.    He was hardly halfway across the stony field when one of the horse's  shoes flew off. The horse was lamed on a rock. Then another shoe came  off. The horse stumbled, and his rider was thrown heavily to the  ground.    Before the king could rise, his frightened horse, although lame, had  galloped away. The king looked, and saw that his soldiers were beaten,  and that the battle was everywhere going against him.    [Illustration]    He waved his sword in the air. He shouted, \"A horse! A horse! My  kingdom for a horse.\" But there was no horse for him. His soldiers  were intent on saving themselves. They could not give him any help.    The battle was lost. King Richard was lost. Henry became king of  England.            \"For the want of a nail the shoe was lost;        For the want of a shoe the horse was lost;        For the want of a horse the battle was lost;        For the failure of battle the kingdom was lost;--        And all for the want of a horseshoe nail.\"      Richard the Third was one of England's worst kings. Henry, the Duke  of Richmond, made war upon him and defeated him in a great battle.          THE LANDLORD'S MISTAKE        When John Adams was president and Thomas Jefferson was vice president  of the United States, there was not a railroad in all the world.    People did not travel very much. There were no broad, smooth highways  as there are now. The roads were crooked and muddy and rough.    If a man was obliged to go from one city to another, he often rode on  horseback. Instead of a trunk for his clothing, he carried a pair of  saddlebags. Instead of sitting at his ease in a parlor car, he went  jolting along through mud and mire, exposed to wind and weather.    One day some men were sitting by the door of a hotel in Baltimore. As  they looked down the street they saw a horseman coming. He was riding  very slowly, and both he and his horse were bespattered with mud.    \"There comes old Farmer Mossback,\" said one of the men, laughing. \"He's  just in from the backwoods.\"    \"He seems to have had a hard time of it,\" said another; \"I wonder where  he'll put up for the night.\"    \"Oh, any kind of a place will suit him,\" answered the landlord. \"He's  one of those country fellows who can sleep in the haymow and eat with  the horses.\"    The traveler was soon at the door. He was dressed plainly, and, with  his reddish-brown hair and mud-bespattered face, looked like a hard-  working countryman just in from the backwoods.    \"Have you a room here for me?\" he asked the landlord.    Now the landlord prided himself upon keeping a first-class hotel, and  he feared that his guests would not like the rough-looking traveler.  So he answered: \"No, sir. Every room is full. The only place I could  put you would be in the barn.\"    \"Well, then,\" answered the stranger, \"I will see what they can do for  me at the Planters' Tavern, round the corner;\" and he rode away.    About an hour later, a well-dressed gentleman came into the hotel and  said, \"I wish to see Mr. Jefferson.\"    \"Mr. Jefferson!\" said the landlord.    \"Yes, sir. Thomas Jefferson, the vice president of the United States.\"    \"He isn't here.\"    \"Oh, but he must be. I met him as he rode into town, and he said that  he intended to stop at this hotel. He has been here about an hour.\"    \"No, he hasn't. The only man that has been here for lodging to-day was  an old clodhopper who was so spattered with mud that you couldn't see  the color of his coat. I sent him round to the Planters'.\"    \"Did he have reddish-brown hair, and did he ride a gray horse?\"    \"Yes, and he was quite tall.\"    \"That was Mr. Jefferson,\" said the gentleman.    \"Mr. Jefferson!\" cried the landlord. \"Was that the vice president?  Here, Dick! build a fire in the best room. Put everything in tiptop  order, Sally. What a dunce I was to turn Mr. Jefferson away! He shall  have all the rooms in the house, and the ladies' parlor, too, I'll go  right round to the Planters' and fetch him back.\"    So he went to the other hotel, where he found the vice president  sitting with some friends in the parlor.    \"Mr. Jefferson,\" he said, \"I have come to ask your pardon. You were  so bespattered with mud that I thought you were some old farmer. If  you'll come back to my house, you shall have the best room in it--yes,  all the rooms if you wish. Won't you come?\"    \"No,\" answered Mr. Jefferson. \"A farmer is as good as any other man;  and where there's no room for a farmer, there can be no room for me.\"          A LESSON IN MANNERS        One morning there was a loud knock at Dean Swift's door. The servant  opened it. A man who was outside handed her a fine duck that had lately  been killed, and said,--\"Here's a present for the Dean. It's from Mr.  Boyle.\"    Then, without another word, he turned and walked away.    A few days afterward the man came again. This time he brought a  partridge. \"Here's another bird from Mr. Boyle.\"    Now, Mr. Boyle was a sporting neighbor who spent a good deal of time  in shooting. He was a great admirer of Dean Swift, and took pleasure  in sending him presents of game.    The third time, the man brought a quail. \"Here's something else for  the Dean,\" he said roughly, and tossed it into the servant's arms.    The servant complained to her master. \"That fellow has no manners,\"  she said.    \"The next time he comes,\" said the Dean, \"let me know, and I will go  to the door.\"    It was not long until the man came with another present. The Dean went  to the door.    \"Here's a rabbit from Mr. Boyle,\" said the man.    \"See here,\" said the Dean in a stern voice, \"that is not the way to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/62"],[0,"A Princess of Mars (#5)"],[1,"I have described at length, made  but one terrible and swift impression on me as I turned to meet it.    Unarmed and naked as I was, the first law of nature manifested itself  in the only possible solution of my immediate problem, and that was to  get out of the vicinity of the point of the charging spear.  Consequently I gave a very earthly and at the same time superhuman leap  to reach the top of the Martian incubator, for such I had determined it  must be.    My effort was crowned with a success which appalled me no less than it  seemed to surprise the Martian warriors, for it carried me fully thirty  feet into the air and landed me a hundred feet from my pursuers and on  the opposite side of the enclosure.    I alighted upon the soft moss easily and without mishap, and turning  saw my enemies lined up along the further wall.  Some were surveying me  with expressions which I afterward discovered marked extreme  astonishment, and the others were evidently satisfying themselves that  I had not molested their young.    They were conversing together in low tones, and gesticulating and  pointing toward me.  Their discovery that I had not harmed the little  Martians, and that I was unarmed, must have caused them to look upon me  with less ferocity; but, as I was to learn later, the thing which  weighed most in my favor was my exhibition of hurdling.    While the Martians are immense, their bones are very large and they are  muscled only in proportion to the gravitation which they must overcome.  The result is that they are infinitely less agile and less powerful, in  proportion to their weight, than an Earth man, and I doubt that were  one of them suddenly to be transported to Earth he could lift his own  weight from the ground; in fact, I am convinced that he could not do so.    My feat then was as marvelous upon Mars as it would have been upon  Earth, and from desiring to annihilate me they suddenly looked upon me  as a wonderful discovery to be captured and exhibited among their  fellows.    The respite my unexpected agility had given me permitted me to  formulate plans for the immediate future and to note more closely the  appearance of the warriors, for I could not disassociate these people  in my mind from those other warriors who, only the day before, had been  pursuing me.    I noted that each was armed with several other weapons in addition to  the huge spear which I have described.  The weapon which caused me to  decide against an attempt at escape by flight was what was evidently a  rifle of some description, and which I felt, for some reason, they were  peculiarly efficient in handling.    These rifles were of a white metal stocked with wood, which I learned  later was a very light and intensely hard growth much prized on Mars,  and entirely unknown to us denizens of Earth.  The metal of the barrel  is an alloy composed principally of aluminum and steel which they have  learned to temper to a hardness far exceeding that of the steel with  which we are familiar.  The weight of these rifles is comparatively  little, and with the small caliber, explosive, radium projectiles which  they use, and the great length of the barrel, they are deadly in the  extreme and at ranges which would be unthinkable on Earth.  The  theoretic effective radius of this rifle is three hundred miles, but  the best they can do in actual service when equipped with their  wireless finders and sighters is but a trifle over two hundred miles.    This is quite far enough to imbue me with great respect for the Martian  firearm, and some telepathic force must have warned me against an  attempt to escape in broad daylight from under the muzzles of twenty of  these death-dealing machines.    The Martians, after conversing for a short time, turned and rode away  in the direction from which they had come, leaving one of their number  alone by the enclosure.  When they had covered perhaps two hundred  yards they halted, and turning their mounts toward us sat watching the  warrior by the enclosure.    He was the one whose spear had so nearly transfixed me, and was  evidently the leader of the band, as I had noted that they seemed to  have moved to their present position at his direction.  When his force  had come to a halt he dismounted, threw down his spear and small arms,  and came around the end of the incubator toward me, entirely unarmed  and as naked as I, except for the ornaments strapped upon his head,  limbs, and breast.    When he was within about fifty feet of me he unclasped an enormous  metal armlet, and holding it toward me in the open palm of his hand,  addressed me in a clear, resonant voice, but in a language, it is  needless to say, I could not understand.  He then stopped as though  waiting for my reply, pricking up his antennae-like ears and cocking  his strange-looking eyes still further toward me.    As the silence became painful I concluded to hazard a little  conversation on my own part, as I had guessed that he was making  overtures of peace.  The throwing down of his weapons and the  withdrawing of his troop before his advance toward me would have  signified a peaceful mission anywhere on Earth, so why not, then, on  Mars!    Placing my hand over my heart I bowed low to the Martian and explained  to him that while I did not understand his language, his actions spoke  for the peace and friendship that at the present moment were most dear  to my heart.  Of course I might have been a babbling brook for all the  intelligence my speech carried to him, but he understood the action  with which I immediately followed my words.    Stretching my hand toward him, I advanced and took the armlet from his  open palm, clasping it about my arm above the elbow; smiled at him and  stood waiting.  His wide mouth spread into an answering smile, and  locking one of his intermediary arms in mine we turned and walked back  toward his mount.  At the same time he motioned his followers to  advance.  They started toward us on a wild run, but were checked by a  signal from him.  Evidently he feared that were I to be really  frightened again I might jump entirely out of the landscape.    He exchanged a few words with his men, motioned to me that I would ride  behind one of them, and then mounted his own animal.  The fellow  designated reached down two or three hands and lifted me up behind him  on the glossy back of his mount, where I hung on as best I could by the  belts and straps which held the Martian's weapons and ornaments.    The entire cavalcade then turned and galloped away toward the range of  hills in the distance.          CHAPTER IV    A PRISONER      We had gone perhaps ten miles when the ground began to rise very  rapidly.  We were, as I was later to learn, nearing the edge of one of  Mars' long-dead seas, in the bottom of which my encounter with the  Martians had taken place.    In a short time we gained the foot of the mountains, and after  traversing a narrow gorge came to an open valley, at the far extremity  of which was a low table land upon which I beheld an enormous city.  Toward this we galloped, entering it by what appeared to be a ruined  roadway leading out from the city, but only to the edge of the table  land, where it ended abruptly in a flight of broad steps.    Upon closer observation I saw as we passed them that the buildings were  deserted, and while not greatly decayed had the appearance of not  having been tenanted for years, possibly for ages.  Toward the center  of the city was a large plaza, and upon this and in the buildings  immediately surrounding it were camped some nine or ten hundred  creatures of the same breed as my captors, for such I now considered  them despite the suave manner in which I had been trapped.    With the exception of their ornaments all were naked.  The women varied  in appearance but little from the men, except that their tusks were  much larger in proportion to their height, in some instances curving  nearly to their high-set ears.  Their bodies were smaller and lighter  in color, and their fingers and toes bore the rudiments of nails, which  were entirely lacking among the males.  The adult females ranged in  height from ten to twelve feet.    The children were light in color, even lighter than the women, and all  looked precisely alike to me, except that some were taller than others;  older, I presumed.    I saw no signs of extreme age among them, nor is there any appreciable  difference in their appearance from the age of maturity, about forty,  until, at about the age of one thousand years, they go voluntarily upon  their last strange pilgrimage down the river Iss, which leads no living  Martian knows whither and from whose bosom no Martian has ever  returned, or would be allowed to live did he return after once  embarking upon its cold, dark waters.    Only about one Martian in a thousand dies of sickness or disease, and  possibly about twenty take the voluntary pilgrimage.  The other nine  hundred and seventy-nine die violent deaths in duels, in hunting, in  aviation and in war; but perhaps by far the greatest death loss comes  during the age of childhood, when vast numbers of the little Martians  fall victims to the great white apes of Mars.    The average life expectancy of a Martian after the age of maturity is  about three hundred years, but would be nearer the one-thousand mark  were it not for the various means leading to violent death.  Owing to  the waning resources of the planet it evidently became necessary to  counteract the increasing longevity which their remarkable skill in  therapeutics and surgery produced, and so human life has come to be  considered but lightly on Mars, as is evidenced by their dangerous  sports and the almost continual warfare between the various communities.    There are other and natural causes tending toward a diminution of  population, but nothing contributes so greatly to this end as the fact  that no male or female Martian is"]]]
