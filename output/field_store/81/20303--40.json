It was clear that after all the Englishmen had not  forgotten how to fight.    The efforts of the English fleet were successful in securing the  peaceful landing of the army at Calais, where Henry arrived at the end  of June. With him went Wolsey, commanding two hundred men, and now a  necessary personage in the king's train. Such confidence was placed in  him by Queen Katharine that she requested him to write to her frequently  and inform her of the king's health, while in return she poured her  household troubles into his sympathetic ear. No doubt Wolsey's hands  were full of business of many kinds during this brief and glorious  campaign, glorious in the sense that success attended its operations,  but fruitless because the things done were scarcely worth the doing. The  English army took Terouenne, more owing to the feebleness of the French  than to their own valour. Louis XII. was prematurely old and ailing;  things had gone against him in Italy, and there was little spirit in the  French army. The defeat of the French outside Terouenne was so rapid  that the battle was derisively called the Battle of Spurs. Henry's  desire for martial glory was satisfied by the surrender of Terouenne,  and his vanity was gratified by the presence of Maximilian, who in  return for a large subsidy brought a few German soldiers, and professed  to serve under the English king. From Terouenne he advanced to Tournai,  which surrendered at the end of September. Maximilian was delighted at  these conquests, of which he reaped all the benefit; with Tournai in the  hands of England, Flanders had a strong protection against France. So  Maximilian would gladly have led Henry to continue the campaign in the  interests of the Flemish frontier. But Henry had no taste for spending a  winter in the field; he pleaded that his presence was needed in England,  and departed, promising to return next year.    In truth the arms of England had won a greater victory on English ground  than anything they had achieved abroad. The war against France awakened  the old hostility of Scotland, and no sooner was Henry VIII. encamped  before Terouenne than he received a Scottish herald bringing a message  of defiance. \"I do not believe that my brother of Scotland will break  his oath,\" said Henry, \"but if he does, he will live to repent it.\"  Repentance came rapidly on the Field of Flodden, where the Scottish army  was almost cut to pieces. This brilliant victory was greatly due to the  energy of Queen Katharine, who wrote to Wolsey, \"My heart is very good  to it, and I am horribly busy with making standards, banners, and  badges.\" She addressed the English leaders before they started for the  war, bade them remember that the English courage excelled that of other  nations, and that the Lord smiled on those who stood in defence of their  own. With a proud heart she sent her husband the blood-stained plaid of  the Scottish king, taken from his corpse. \"In this,\" she wrote, \"your  Grace shall see how I keep my promise, sending you for your banner a  king's coat.\"    The victory of Flodden Field was of great importance, for it delivered  England from the fear of a troublesome neighbour, and showed Europe that  England could not be muzzled by the need of care for her own borders.  The Scottish power was broken for many years to come, and England was  free to act as she would. Europe began to respect the power of England,  though there was little reason to rate highly the wisdom of her king.  Henry had won little by his campaign; he had gratified his vanity, but  he had not advanced towards any definite end.    Henry VIII. was young and simple. He expected to captivate the world by  brilliant deeds, and fascinate it by unselfish exploits. He soon found  that his pretended allies were only seeking their own advantage. The  name of the \"Holy League\" was the merest pretext. The new Pope, Leo X.,  a supple time-serving intriguer, trained in the deceitful policy of the  Medici House, was willing to patch up the quarrel between France and the  Papacy. Ferdinand of Spain wished only to keep things as they were. As  he grew older he grew more suspicious, and clung to the power which he  possessed. His one dread was lest Charles, the grandson of himself and  Maximilian, should demand his maternal heritage of Castile. Ferdinand  was resolved to keep the two Spanish kingdoms united under his own rule  until his death, and considered European affairs in the first instance  as they were likely to affect that issue. He was of opinion that France  was no longer formidable to Spanish interests in Italy, while English  successes on the Flemish frontier might make Charles more powerful than  he wished him to be. Accordingly he set to work to undermine Henry's  position by making an alliance with France. He was still Henry's ally,  and had promised him to help him to continue the war in the spring of  1514. None the less he entered into secret negotiations with France, and  cautiously endeavoured to persuade Maximilian to join him. Maximilian  was still at war with Venice, and was aggrieved that he was the only  member of the plundering gang who had not gained by the League of  Cambrai. Ferdinand allured him from his interest in Flanders by the  prospect of a renewal of the League against Venice in his special  behalf, and Maximilian was sanguine enough to listen to the temptation.  He faintly stipulated that the consent of England should be obtained,  but was satisfied with Ferdinand's assurance that Henry would have no  objection to a truce with France. Early in April 1514 a truce for a year  was made between Louis XII., Maximilian, and Ferdinand. Henry found  himself tricked by his father-in-law, and abandoned by the ally whom he  had largely subsidised, and had greatly benefited.    It is no wonder that Henry was greatly angered at this result, and  declared that he would trust no man any more. He had taken the measure  of the good faith of European rulers, and had learned the futility of  great undertakings for the general welfare. In truth, the difficulty of  European politics always lies in the fact that the general welfare can  only be promoted by the furtherance of particular interests, which  threaten in their turn to become dangerous. The interests of the  sixteenth century were purely dynastic interests, and seem trivial and  unworthy. We are not, however, justified in inferring that dynastic  interests, because they are concerned with small arrangements, are in  their nature more selfish or more iniquitous than interests which clothe  themselves in more fair-sounding phrases. Their selfishness is more  apparent; it does not follow that it is less profound.    However that may be, the desertion of Maximilian and Ferdinand put a  stop to Henry's warlike projects, and restored England to peace. Henry  had had enough of fighting other people's battles. He was willing to  pursue his own course by the means which others used, and trust  henceforth to the bloodless battles of diplomacy. In this new field  Wolsey was the English champion, and for the next sixteen years the  history of England is the history of Wolsey's achievements.    Wolsey's services in the campaign of 1513 gave him a firm hold of the  king's favour, and secured for him large rewards. As he was an  ecclesiastic his salary was paid out of the revenues of the Church. When  Tournai became an English possession its bishopric was conferred on  Wolsey, and on a vacancy in the bishopric of Lincoln in the beginning of  1514 that see was given him in addition. How the offices of the Church  were in those days used as rewards for service to the State may be seen  by the fact that the English representative in Rome was the Archbishop  of York, Thomas Bainbridge, who lived as Cardinal in the Papal Court.  Moreover, an Italian, Silvestro de' Gigli, held the bishopric of  Worcester, though he lived habitually in Rome, and devoted his energies  to the furtherance of the interests of England. In July 1514 Cardinal  Bainbridge died in Rome, poisoned by one of his servants. The Bishop of  Worcester was suspected of being privy to the deed for the purpose of  removing out of the way a troublesome rival. It would seem, however,  that the murder was prompted by vengeful feelings and the desire to hide  peculations. The charge against the Bishop of Worcester was investigated  by the Pope, and he was acquitted; but the story gives a poor picture of  morality and security of life at Rome. On the death of Bainbridge the  vacant archbishopric of York was also conferred on Wolsey, who was now  enriched by the revenues of three sees, and was clearly marked out as  the foremost man in England.    He rose to this position solely by the king's favour, as the king alone  chose his own ministers and counsellors, and there existed no external  pressure which could influence his decisions. The Wars of the Roses had  seen the downfall of the baronial power, and Henry VII. had accustomed  men to see affairs managed almost entirely by a new class of officials.  The ministers and counsellors of Henry VIII. were chosen from a desire  to balance the old and the new system. The remnants of the baronial  party were associated with officials, that they might be assimilated  into the same class. The Duke of Norfolk, as the greatest nobleman in  England, was powerful, and was jealous of the men with whom he found  himself called upon to work. Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, was the  personal friend of the king, and shared in his private more than in his  public life. The Earl of Surrey had done good service at Flodden Field,  and was a man of practical capacity. The other ministers were most of  them ecclesiastics. Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury, was respected  rather than trusted. Fox, Bishop of Winchester, was a capable and  painstaking official.

Eliphalet Hopper's mental  insides in as many words as I have taken to chronicle his arrival in St.  Louis. They invite us to attend a clinic, and the horrible skill with  which they wield the scalpel holds us spellbound. For God has made all  of us, rogue and saint, burglar and burgomaster, marvellously alike.  We read a patent medicine circular and shudder with seven diseases. We  peruse one of Mr. So and So's intellectual tonics and are sure we are  complicated scandals, fearfully and wonderfully made.    Alas, I have neither the skill nor the scalpel to show the diseases of  Mr. Hopper's mind; if, indeed, he had any. Conscience, when contracted,  is just as troublesome as croup. Mr. Hopper was thoroughly healthy. He  had ambition, as I have said. But he was not morbidly sensitive. He was  calm enough when he got back to the boarding-house, which he found in as  high a pitch of excitement as New Englanders ever reach.    And over what?    Over the prospective arrival that evening of the Brices, mother and  son, from Boston. Miss Crane had received the message in the morning.  Palpitating with the news; she had hurried rustling to Mrs. Abner Reed,  with the paper in her hand.    \"I guess you don't mean Mrs. Appleton Brice,\" said Mrs. Reed.    \"That's just who I mean,\" answered Miss Crane, triumphantly,--nay,  aggressively.    Mrs. Abner shook her curls in a way that made people overwhelm her with  proofs.    \"Mirandy, you're cracked,\" said she. \"Ain't you never been to Boston?\"    Miss Crane bridled. This was an uncalled-for insult.    \"I guess I visited down Boston-way oftener than you, Eliza Reed. You  never had any clothes.\"    Mrs. Reed's strength was her imperturbability.    \"And you never set eyes on the Brice house, opposite the Common, with  the swelled front? I'd like to find out where you were a-visitin'. And  you've never heard tell of the Brice homestead, at Westbury, that was  Colonel Wilton Brice's, who fought in the Revolution? I'm astonished at  you, Mirandy. When I used to be at the Dales', in Mount Vernon Street,  in thirty-seven, Mrs. Charles Atterbury Brice used to come there in  her carriage, a-callin'. She was Appleton's mother. Severe! Save us,\"  exclaimed Mrs. Reed, \"but she was stiff as starched crepe. His father  was minister to France. The Brices were in the India trade, and they had  money enough to buy the whole of St. Louis.\"    Miss Crane rattled the letter in her hand. She brought forth her  reserves.    \"Yes, and Appleton Brice lost it all, in the panic. And then he died,  and left the widow and son without a cent.\"    Mrs. Reed took off her spectacles.    \"I want to know!\" she exclaimed. \"The durned fool! Well, Appleton Brice  didn't have the family brains, ands he was kind of soft-hearted. I've  heard Mehitabel Dale say that.\" She paused to reflect. \"So they're  coming here?\" she added. \"I wonder why.\"    Miss Crane's triumph was not over.    \"Because Silas Whipple was some kin to Appleton Brice, and he has  offered the boy a place in his law office.\"    Miss Reed laid down her knitting.    \"Save us!\" she said. \"This is a day of wonders, Mirandy. Now Lord help  the boy if he's gain' to work for the Judge.\"    \"The Judge has a soft heart, if he is crabbed,\" declared the spinster.  \"I've heard say of a good bit of charity he's done. He's a soft heart.\"    \"Soft as a green quince!\" said Mrs. Abner, scornfully. \"How many friends  has he?\"    \"Those he has are warm enough,\" Miss Crane retorted. \"Look at Colonel  Carvel, who has him to dinner every Sunday.\"    \"That's plain as your nose, Mirandy Crane. They both like quarrellin'  better than anything in this world.\"    \"Well,\" said Miss Crane, \"I must go make ready for the Brices.\"    Such was the importance of the occasion, however, that she could  not resist calling at Mrs. Merrill's room, and she knocked at Mrs.  Chandler's door to tell that lady and her daughter.    No Burke has as yet arisen in this country of ours to write a Peerage.  Fame awaits him. Indeed, it was even then awaiting him, at the time  of the panic of 1857. With what infinite pains were the pedigree  and possessions of the Brice family pieced together that day by the  scattered residents from Puritan-land in the City of St. Louis. And few  buildings would have borne the wear and tear of many house-cleanings of  the kind Miss Crane indulged in throughout the morning and afternoon.    Mr. Eliphalet Hopper, on his return from business, was met on the steps  and requested to wear his Sunday clothes. Like the good republican that  he was, Mr. Hopper refused. He had ascertained that the golden charm  which made the Brices worthy of tribute had been lost. Commercial  supremacy,--that was Mr. Hopper's creed. Family is a good thing, but  of what use is a crest without the panels on which to paint it? Can  a diamond brooch shine on a calico gown? Mr. Hopper deemed church the  place for worship. He likewise had his own idol in his closet.    Eliphalet at Willesden had heard a great deal of Boston airs and graces  and intellectuality, of the favored few of that city who lived in  mysterious houses, and who crossed the sea in ships. He pictured Mrs.  Brice asking for a spoon, and young Stephen sniffing at Mrs. Crane's  boarding-house. And he resolved with democratic spirit that he would  teach Stephen a lesson, if opportunity offered. His own discrepancy  between the real and the imagined was no greater than that of the rest  of his fellow-boarders.    Barring Eliphalet, there was a dress parade that evening,--silks and  bombazines and broadcloths, and Miss Crane's special preserves on the  tea-table. Alas, that most of the deserved honors of this world should  fall upon barren ground!    The quality which baffled Mr. Hopper, and some other boarders, was  simplicity. None save the truly great possess it (but this is not  generally known). Mrs. Brice was so natural, that first evening at tea,  that all were disappointed. The hero upon the reviewing stand with the  halo of the Unknown behind his head is one thing; the lady of Family who  sits beside you at a boarding-house and discusses the weather and the  journey is quite another. They were prepared to hear Mrs. Brice rail  at the dirt of St. Louis and the crudity of the West. They pictured  her referring with sighs to her Connections, and bewailing that Stephen  could not have finished his course at Harvard.    She did nothing of the sort.    The first shock was so great that Mrs. Abner Reed cried in the privacy  of her chamber, and the Widow Crane confessed her disappointment to the  confiding ear of her bosom friend, Mrs. Merrill. Not many years later a  man named Grant was to be in Springfield, with a carpet bag, despised as  a vagabond. A very homely man named Lincoln went to Cincinnati to try a  case before the Supreme Court, and was snubbed by a man named Stanton.    When we meet the truly great, several things may happen. In the first  place, we begin to believe in their luck, or fate, or whatever we choose  to call it, and to curse our own. We begin to respect ourselves the  more, and to realize that they are merely clay like us, that we are  great men without Opportunity. Sometimes, if we live long enough near  the Great, we begin to have misgivings. Then there is hope for us.    Mrs. Brice, with her simple black gowns, quiet manner, and serene face,  with her interest in others and none in herself, had a wonderful effect  upon the boarders. They were nearly all prepared to be humble. They grew  arrogant and pretentious. They asked Mrs. Brice if she knew this  and that person of consequence in Boston, with whom they claimed  relationship or intimacy. Her answers were amiable and self-contained.    But what shall we say of Stephen Brice? Let us confess at once that it  is he who is the hero of this story, and not Eliphalet Hopper. It  would be so easy to paint Stephen in shining colors, and to make him a  first-class prig (the horror of all novelists), that we must begin with  the drawbacks. First and worst, it must be confessed that Stephen had  at that time what has been called \"the Boston manner.\" This was not  Stephen's fault, but Boston's. Young Mr. Brice possessed that  wonderful power of expressing distance in other terms besides ells and  furlongs,--and yet he was simple enough with it all.    Many a furtive stare he drew from the table that evening. There were one  or two of discernment present, and they noted that his were the generous  features of a marked man,--if he chose to become marked. He inherited  his mother's look; hers was the face of a strong woman, wide of  sympathy, broad of experience, showing peace of mind amid troubles--the  touch of femininity was there to soften it.    Her son had the air of the college-bred. In these surroundings he  escaped arrogance by the wonderful kindliness of his eye, which lighted  when his mother spoke to him. But he was not at home at Miss Crane's  table, and he made no attempt to appear at his ease.    This was an unexpected pleasure for Mr. Eliphalet Hopper. Let it not be  thought that he was the only one at that table to indulge in a little  secret rejoicing. But it was a peculiar satisfaction to him to reflect  that these people, who had held up their heads for so many generations,  were humbled at last. To be humbled meant, in Mr. Hopper's philosophy,  to lose one's money. It was thus he gauged the importance of his  acquaintances; it was thus he hoped some day to be gauged. And he  trusted and believed that the time would come when he could give  his fillip to the upper rim of fortune's wheel, and send it spinning  downward.    Mr. Hopper was drinking his tea and silently forming an estimate. He  concluded that young Brice was not the type to acquire the money which  his father had lost. And he reflected that Stephen must feel as strange  in St. Louis as a cod might amongst the cat-fish in the Mississippi.  So the assistant manager of Carvel &"]]]
