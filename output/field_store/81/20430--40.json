In the examples already given the verbs ending in \"-as\", \"-is\", \"-os\"  express \"action\" or \"being\" (\"state\") going on in present, past, or  future time, as \"Mi skribas\", I am writing; \"Li legis\", He read; \"Ni  iros\", We shall go.    If we wish merely to express the idea of action or state indefinitely,  without reference to any time or any subject, the verb must end in \"-i,\"  as \"Vivi\", To live; \"Mi deziras lerni\", I wish to learn; \"Ni devas  labori\", We must work.    (This is called the INDEFINITE or INFINITIVE Mood (manner of  expression), because not limited by reference to time or subject).    To give an \"order\" or \"command\", or to express \"will, desire, purpose\",  etc., the verb must end in \"u\", as \"Donu al mi panon\", Give (to) me  bread; \"Iru for\", Go away; \"Estu felicxa\", May you be happy! \"Vivu la  regxo!\" (Long) live the king!    In such cases as Tell \"him to come\", I want \"you to sing\", Allow \"her to  speak\", we have to use a second sentence with the verb ending in \"u\",  and beginning with \"ke\", that, as \"Diru al li, ke li venu\", Tell (say  to) him, that he come; \"Mi deziras, ke vi kantu\", I wish, that you sing;  \"Permesu al sxi, ke sxi parolu\", Allow her, that she speak. Sentences  like the last are often contracted, only the last subject and verb being  used, as \"Sxi parolu\", Let her speak; \"Gxi kusxu\", Let it lie; \"Ni iru\",  Let us go; \"Ili dormu\", Let them sleep. \"Cxu vi volas ke mi tion faru?\"  Do you wish me to do that? \"Cxu mi tion faru?\" Shall I do that?

Mi jam havas mian cxapelon; nun sercxu vi vian.                                     LESSON 11.                            VERBS (continued), -us.    Sometimes we want to express a \"supposition\", to say that something  \"would\" take place, supposing that something else, which is not likely  to occur, were to do so, or that something \"would have\" taken place if  something else which did not occur had done so. In this case the verb  must end with \"-us\", as, If I were well (which I am not) I should be  happy (which also I am not), \"Se mi estus sana, mi estus felicxa\". If  he knew (supposition) that I am here (a fact) he would immediately come  to me (supposition), \"Se li scius, ke mi estas tie cxi, li tuj venus  al mi\". Compare the two following sentences:-- (i.). \"Kvankam vi estas  ricxa, mi dubas, cxu vi estas felicxa\", Though you are (in fact) rich, I  doubt whether you are (in fact) happy, (ii.). \"Kvankam vi estus ricxa,  mi dubas, cxu, vi estus felicxa\", Though (supposing that) you were rich,  I doubt whether you would be happy.

When we tell of someone doing a certain action we often want to allude  to some circumstance concerning that action, such as the time, or place,  or manner in which it was done, that is, when, or where, or how it was  done.    In the sentences--Yesterday I met your son, \"Hieraux mi renkontis vian  filon\"; He will go in the evening, \"Li iros vespere\"; They sat there,  \"Ili sidis tie\"; She will remain at home, \"Sxi restos hejme\"; Good  children learn diligently, \"Bonaj infanoj lernas diligente\"; I will do  it with pleasure, \"Mi faros gxin plezure\", the words \"hieraux, vespere\",  show the time, \"tie, hejme\", show the place, and \"diligente, plezure\",  show the manner of the action.    (Because these words relate to the verb they are called ADVERBS).    Adverbs may be formed from any word whose sense admits of it, and  especially from adjectives, by means of the termination \"e\", as \"bona\",  good, \"bone\", well; \"antaux\" before, \"antauxe\", previously or formerly;  \"mateno\", morning, \"matene\", in the morning; \"sekvi\", to follow,  \"sekve\", consequently.    When we want the adverb to show \"direction towards\" any place, time,  etc., either actually or figuratively, \"n\" is added, as \"Li alkuris  hejmen\", He ran home. \"Ili levis unu manon supren\", They raised one  hand upwards. \"Antauxen\"! Forward! (\"n\" is also added to nouns to show  direction towards. \"Li eniris en la domon\", He entered into the house).    Some adverbs are used with adjectives and other adverbs to show the  \"degree\" of the quality, quantity, etc., as The paper is \"very\" white,  La papero estas \"tre\" blanka. \"Too\" much speaking tires him, La \"tro\"  multa parolado lacigas lin. I am \"as\" strong \"as\" you, Mi estas \"tiel\"  forta, \"kiel\" vi (estas forta). He came \"very\" early, Li venis \"tre\"  frue.    The following words are in themselves adverbs, and need no special  ending:--                                  VOCABULARY.       hodiaux : to-day.                  tre : very.     hieraux : yesterday.               tro : too.     morgaux : to-morrow.               tute : quite.     baldaux : soon.                    nur : only.     ankoraux : yet.                    nepre : surely, without fail.     jam :"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8178"],[0,"The Politeness of Princes, and Other School Stories (#5)"],[1," good sorts, and this is bound to make them lose a tremendous  lot. The school's simply crawling with chaps who'd do anything to get  a good tea cheaper than they're getting now. They'll simply scrum in  to this new place.\"    \"Well, I don't see what we can do,\" said Linton, \"except keep on going  to Cook's ourselves. Let's be going now, by the way. We'll get as many  chaps as we can to promise to stick to them. But we can't prevent the  rest going where they like. Come on.\"    The atmosphere at Cook's that evening was heavily charged with gloom.  ExSergeant Cook, usually a treasury of jest and anecdote, was silent  and thoughtful. Mrs. Cook bustled about with her customary vigour, but  she too was disinclined for conversation. The place was ominously  empty. A quartette of school house juniors in one corner and a  solitary prefect from Donaldson's completed the sum of the customers.  Nobody seemed to want to talk a great deal. There was something in the  air which        _said as plain as whisper in the ear,      \"The place is haunted._\"    and so it was. Haunted by the spectre of that hideous, new, glaring  red-brick building down the street, which had opened its doors to the  public on the previous afternoon.    \"Look there,\" said Dunstable, as they came out. He pointed along the  street. The doors of the new establishment were congested. A crowd,  made up of members of various houses, was pushing to get past another  crowd which was trying to get out. The \"public-school tea at one  shilling\" appeared to have proved attractive.    \"Look at 'em,\" said Dunstable. \"Sordid beasts! All they care about is  filling themselves. There goes that man Merrett. Rand-Brown with him.  Here come four more. Come on. It makes me sick.\"    \"I wish it would make _them_ sick,\" said Linton.    \"Perhaps it will.... By George!\"    He started.    \"What's up?\" said Linton.    \"Oh, nothing. I was only thinking of something.\"    They walked on without further conversation. Dunstable's brain was  working fast. He had an idea, and was busy developing it.            *       *       *       *       *    The manager of the Wrykyn Branch of Ring's Come-one Come-all Stores  stood at the entrance to his shop on the following afternoon spitting  with energy and precision on to the pavement--he was a free-born  American citizen--and eyeing the High Street as a monarch might gaze  at his kingdom. He had just completed a highly satisfactory report to  headquarters, and was feeling contented with the universe, and the way  in which it was managed. Even in the short time since the opening of  the store he had managed to wake up the sluggish Britishers as if they  had had an electric shock.    \"We,\" he observed epigrammatically to a passing cat, which had stopped  on its way to look at him, \"are it.\"    As he spoke he perceived a youth coming towards him down the street.  He wore a cap of divers colours, from which the manager argued that  he belonged to the school. Evidently a devotee of the advertised  \"public-school\" shillingsworth, and one who, as urged by the small  bills, had come early to avoid the rush. \"Step right in, mister,\" he  said, moving aside from the doorway. \"And what can I do for _you_?\"    \"Are you the manager of this place?\" asked Dunstable--for the youth  was that strategist, and no other.    \"On the bull's eye first time,\" replied the manager with easy  courtesy. \"Will you take a cigar or a cocoa-nut?\"    \"Can I have a bit of a talk with you, if you aren't busy?\"    \"Sure. Step right in.\"    \"Now, sir,\" said the manager, \"what's _your_ little trouble?\"    \"It's about this public school tea business,\" said Dunstable. \"It's  rather a shame, you see. Before you came bargeing in, everybody used  to go to Cook's.\"    \"And now,\" interrupted the manager, \"they come to us. Correct, sir. We  _are_ the main stem. And why not?\"    \"Cook's such a good sort.\"    \"I should like to know him,\" said the manager politely.    \"You see,\" said Dunstable, \"it doesn't so much matter about the other  things you sell; but Cook's simply relies on giving fellows tea in the  afternoon----\"    \"One moment, sir,\" said the man from the States. \"Let me remind you of  a little rule which will be useful to you when you butt into the big,  cold world. That is, never let sentiment interfere with business. See?  Either Ring's Stores or your friend has got to be on top, and, if I  know anything, it's going to be We. We! And I'm afraid that's all I  can do for you, unless you've that hungry feeling, and want to sample  our public-school tea at twenty-five cents.\"    \"No, thanks,\" said Dunstable. \"Here come some chaps, though, who look  as if they might.\"    He stepped aside as half a dozen School House juniors raced up.    \"For one day only,\" said the manager to Dunstable, \"you may partake  free, if you care to. You have man's most priceless possession, Cool  Cheek. And Cool Cheek, when recognised, should not go unrewarded. Step  in.\"    \"No thanks,\" said Dunstable. \"You'll find me at Cook's if you want  me.\"    \"Kindness,\" said he to himself, as Mrs. Cook served him in the  depressed way which had now become habitual with her, \"kindness having  failed, we must try severity.\"      PART 2    Those who knew and liked Dunstable were both pained and disgusted at  his behaviour during the ensuing three days. He suddenly exhibited a  weird fondness for some of Wrykyn's least deserving inmates. He walked  over to school with Merrett, of Seymour's, and Ruthven, of  Donaldson's, both notorious outsiders. When Linton wanted him to come  and play fives after school, he declined on the ground that he was  teaing with Chadwick, of Appleby's. Now in the matter of absolute  outsiderishness Chadwick, of Appleby's, was to Merrett, of Seymour's,  as captain is to subaltern. Linton was horrified, and said so.    \"What do you want to do it for?\" he asked. \"What's the point of it?  You can't like those chaps.\"    \"Awfully good sorts when you get to know them,\" said Dunstable.    \"You've been some time finding it out.\"    \"I know. Chadwick's an acquired taste. By the way, I'm giving a tea on  Thursday. Will you come?\"    \"Who's going to be there?\" inquired Linton warily.    \"Well, Chadwick for one; and Merrett and Ruthven and three other  chaps.\"    \"Then,\" said Linton with some warmth, \"I think you'll have to do  without me. I believe you're mad.\"    And he went off in disgust to the fives-courts.    When on the following Thursday Dunstable walked into Ring's Stores  with his five guests, and demanded six public-school teas, the manager  was perhaps justified in allowing a triumphant smile to wander across  his face. It was a signal victory for him.  \"No free list to-day,  sir,\" he said. \"Entirely suspended.\"    \"Never mind,\" said Dunstable, \"I'm good for six shillings.\"    \"Free list?\" said Merrett, as the manager retired, \"I didn't know  there was one.\"    \"There isn't. Only he and I palled up so much the other day that he  offered me a tea for nothing.\"    \"Didn't you take it?\"    \"No. I went to Cook's.\"    \"Rotten hole, Cook's. I'm never going there again,\" said Chadwick.  \"You take my tip, Dun, old chap, and come here.\"    \"Dun, old chap,\" smiled amiably.    \"I don't know,\" he said, looking up from the tea-pot, into which he  had been pouring water; \"you can be certain of the food at Cook's.\"    \"What do you mean? So you can here.\"    \"Oh,\" said Dunstable, \"I didn't know. I've never had tea here before.  But I've often heard that American food upsets one sometimes.\"    By this time, the tea having stood long enough, he poured out, and the  meal began.    Merrett and his friends were hearty feeders, and conversation  languished for some time. Then Chadwick leaned back in his chair, and  breathed heavily.    \"You couldn't get stuff like that at Cook's,\" he said.    \"I suppose it is a bit different,\" said Dunstable. \"Have any of  you ... noticed something queer...?\"    Merrett stared at Ruthven. Ruthven stared at Merrett.    \"I....\" said Merrett.    \"D'you know....\" said Ruthven.    Chadwick's face was a delicate green.    \"I believe,\" said Dunstable, \"the stuff ... was ... poisoned. I....\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"Drink this,\" said the school doctor, briskly, bending over  Dunstable's bed with a medicine-glass in his hand, \"and be ashamed of  yourself. The fact is you've over-eaten yourself. Nothing more and  nothing less. Why can't you boys be content to feed moderately?\"    \"I don't think I ate much, sir,\" protested Dunstable. \"It must have  been what I ate. I went to that new American place.\"    \"So _you_ went there, too? Why, I've just come from attending a  bilious boy in Mr. Seymour's house. He said he had been at the  American place, too.\"    \"Was that Merrett, sir? He was one of the party. We were all bad. We  can't all have eaten too much.\"    The doctor looked thoughtful.    \"H'm. Curious. Very curious. Do you remember what you had?\"    \"I had some things the man called buckwheat cakes, with some stuff he  said was maple syrup.\"    \"Bah. American trash.\" The doctor was a staunch Briton, conservative  in his views both on politics and on food. \"Why can't you boys eat  good English food? I must tell the headmaster of this. I haven't time  to look after the school if all the boys are going to poison  themselves. You lie still and try to go to sleep, and you'll be right  enough in no time.\"    But Dunstable did not go to sleep. He stayed awake to interview  Linton, who came to pay him a visit.    \"Well,\" said Linton, looking down at the sufferer with an expression  that was a delicate blend of pity and contempt, \"you've made a nice  sort of ass of yourself, haven't you! I don't know if it's any  consolation to you, but Merrett's just as bad as you are. And I hear  the others are, too. So now you see what comes of going to Ring's  instead of Cook's.\"    \"And now,\" said Dunstable, \"if you've quite finished, you can listen  to me for a bit....\"    \"So now "]]]
