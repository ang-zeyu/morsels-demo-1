[See plate4.gif]    The fable of the twelve labors constituted the sacred records or  scriptures of the older forms of Astrolatry, one version of which,  written with the cuneiform character upon twelve tablets of burnt clay,  exhumed from the ruins of an Assyrian city, and now on exhibition in  the British Museum, is ascribed to Nimroud, the prototype of the  Grecian Hercules, and of Nimrod, the Mighty Hunter of the Old  Testament.        ANNIVERSARIES OF SOLAR WORSHIP.    The Nativity.    Applying the anniversaries inculcated in the worship of God Sol to his  imaginary incarnations, the founders of the ancient Astrolatry made  them refer to the several stages of human existence from infancy to  mature age. Hence, comparing the first day of infantile life to the  shortest day of the year, it would naturally be expected that they  would have placed the anniversary of the Nativity exactly at the Winter  solstice; but, having conceived the idea that the sun stood still for  the space of three days at each of the cardinal points, and making it  represent the figurative death of the genius of that luminary, they  fixed the date for its observance three days later, or on the 25th of  December. The Gnostic adherents to the ancient solar worship, or those  who were conversant with the teachings of the Esoteric philosophy,  knowing that the dramatis personae of the fable of incarnation were  pictured with stars upon the azure vault, recognized the woman \"clothed  with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of  twelve stars,\" referred to in Revelations xii. 1, as the Virgo of the  Zodiac; they also knew that she was the true queen of heaven and mother  of God; and that the infant, anciently represented in her arms, and  with whom, in their day, she arose on the Eastern horizon at midnight  on the 24th of December, was the same of whom the people were taught to  sing at Christmas \"Unto us a child is born this day.\"    With the knowledge of these facts we can readily see that this is the  Virgin and child which constituted the originals of those exquisite  paintings, by the old masters, known as the Madonna and Child.      Epiphany or Twelfth Day.    In reference to the twelve signs through which the sun makes his  apparent annual revolution, the twelfth day after Christmas, answering  to the 6th of January, was observed by the votaries of the ancient  Astrolatry as the anniversary of the Epiphany or Twelfth Day. In the  solar fables, it was taught that a star appeared in the heavens on that  day to manifest the birthplace of the infant Saviour to the Magi or  Wise Men of the East, who came to pay him homage, and to present him  with the gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh, as related in Matthew  ii. 11.    The reason for presenting these gifts is explained by the facts that of  the seven metals dedicated to the genii of the planets, gold was the  one consecrated to God Sol; and frankincense and myrrh were the gums  burned in censers in his worship.    In reading the account of the Magi's visit to the infant Saviour, we  have but to exercise our thinking faculties to realize that it is  allegory instead of literal history.      Lent or Lenten Season.    In the ancient solar fables it was taught that the persecutions to  which the incarnate Saviours were subjected while passing through the  dominion of God Sol as Lord of Evil, raged with greatest fury during  the forty days preceding the festival of Easter, which period,  beginning when the days were perceptibly lengthening, was called Lent,  or the Lenten season. It was during this season that the votaries of  the ancient religion were taught to manifest their sympathy for the  Saviour in his imaginary conflict with the Devil by abstaining from all  festivities, and by fasting and prayer; and, as that was the season in  which the flocks and herds were poor in flesh, while the seas and  rivers abounded with fish in good condition, the ancient priests,  making a virtue of necessity, enjoined a diet principally of fish, and  for that reason placed the constellation Pisces at the point in the  Zodiac in which the Lenten season anciently began; which, without  regard to the day of the week, was always observed on the 15th day of  February, the name of that month having been derived from the Februa,  or feast of purification and expiation of the old Roman calendar.    At the council of Nice the Lenten season was made to begin on the  fourth day of the week, and in reference to the ancient custom of the  more devout sprinkling ashes upon their heads at the feast of the  Februa, it is called Ash Wednesday.    Hence we see that all years in which Ash Wednesday does not come on the  15th of February, the Lenten season must necessarily contain a greater  or lesser number than the original assignment of forty days.      Passion Week.    The last seven days of Lent is called Passion Week, in reference to the  apparent passage of the sun across the Celestial equator at the Vernal  Equinox or 21st of March; the ancient astrologers having conceived the  idea that the sun stood still for the space of three days at each of  the cardinal points, and making it represent the figurative death of  the genius of that luminary, it was observed as the anniversary of the  Vernal crucifixion or passion of the incarnate Saviours; and in  commemoration of their imaginary sufferings and death it was the custom  to expose in the temples during the last three days of Passion Week  figures representing their dead bodies, over which the votaries of  solar worship, especially the women, made great lamentation. It was in  reference to one of these images, laid out in the temple at Jerusalem,  to which the jealous Jehovah, considering it a great abomination in his  own house, is made to direct the attention of Ezekiel, the prophet,  who, looking, beheld \"Women weeping for Tammuz\" as recorded in the  eighth chapter. This divinity was the Phoenician prototype of the  Grecian Adonis, to whom the women of Judea preferred to pay homage.    It was during the last three days of Passion Week that the votaries of  solar worship performed their severest penance. Besides fasting and  prayer, the more devout flagellated and slashed themselves and others  with knives and thongs, and carried heavy crosses up steep acclivities.  In all ultra-Catholic countries the priests, in imitation of the  ancient custom, expose in the churches figures representing the dead  Saviour, over which the laity, especially the women, weep and mourn;  and the more devout men cut and slash themselves, and each other, with  knives and thongs; and, in imitation of the imaginary tramp of Jesus  with his cross up Calvary's rugged side, bear heavy crosses up steep  acclivities.      Passion Plays.    Anciently dramas representing the passion of incarnate saviours, called  Passion plays, were enacted upon the stage. The most celebrated of  these divine tragedies, known as Prometheus Bound, and composed by the  Greek poet AEschylus, was played at Athens 500 years before the  beginning of the Christian era. To show that this sin-atoning saviour  was not chained to a rock, while vultures preyed upon his vitals, as  popularly taught, but was nailed to a tree; we quote front Potter's  translation of the play, that passage which, readily recognized as the  original of a Christian song, reads as follows:                \"Lo, streaming from the fatal tree,                 His all atoning blood:               Is this the infinite? 'Tis he--                 Prometheus and a God.               Well might the sun in darkness hide,                 And veil his glories in,               When God the great Prometheus died                 For man, the creature's sin.\"    The veiling of the sun, as represented in these plays, having reference  to the imaginary sympathy expressed by God Sol for the sufferings of  his incarnate son, was shown upon the stage by shading the lights. The  monks of the Middle Ages enacted plays representing the passion of the  Christian Saviour, and the Bavarian peasantry, perpetuating this  custom, perform the play every tenth year.      Resurrection and Easter Festival.    In conformity to the ancient teachings, the incarnate saviours,  considered as figuratively dead for the space of three days at the  Vernal Equinox, or 21st of March, were raised to newness of life after  the expiration of that time. Hence, the 25th of March, without regard  to the day of the week, was celebrated as the anniversary of the Vernal  resurrection. On the morning of this day it was the custom of the  astrologers to say to the mourners assembled in the temples, \"Be of  good cheer, sacred band of initiates; your God has risen from the dead,  his pains and his sufferings shall be your salvation.\" Another form of  this admonition, quoted from an ancient poem in reference to the  Phoenician Tammuz, reads as follows:                \"Trust ye saints, your God restored,               Trust ye in your risen Lord,               For the pains which he endured,               Your salvation hath procured.\"    Then would begin the festivities of Easter, which corrupted from  Eostre, and derived from the Teutonic mythology, was one of the many  names given to the goddess of Spring. In the observance of this  festival the temples were adorned with floral offerings; the Hilaries  sang their joyful lays; the fires upon the pyres, or the fire-altars,  were extinguished and rekindled with new fire, or sacred fire of the  stars, which the Astrologers taught was brought down from heaven by the  winged genius Perseus, the constellation which, anciently, was in  conjunction with the Vernal Equinox; Paschal candles, lit from the new  fire, were distributed to the faithful and the Paschal feast, Easter  feast, or the feast of the passover, was eaten in commemoration of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8866"],[0,"Wild Flowers Worth Knowing (#5)"],[1," petals may  exceed two inches; and in Michigan a monstrous form has been found. The  broadly rhombic leaves, tapering to a point, and lacking petioles, are  seated in the usual whorl of three, at the summit of the stem, which may  attain a foot and a half in height; from the centre the decorative  flower arises on a long peduncle.    Certainly the commonest trillium in the East, although it thrives as far  westward as Ontario and Missouri, and south to Georgia, is the Nodding  Wake-Robin (_T. cernuum_), whose white or pinkish flower droops from its  peduncle until it is all but hidden under the whorl of broadly rhombic,  tapering leaves. The wavy margined petals, about as long as the  sepals--that is to say, half an inch long or over--curve backward at  maturity. One finds the plant in bloom from April to June, according to  the climate of its long range.           *       *       *       *       *    Perhaps the most strikingly beautiful member of the tribe is the Painted  Trillium (_T. undulatum_ or _T. erythrocarpum_). At the summit of the  slender stem, rising perhaps only eight inches, or maybe twice as high,  this charming flower spreads its long, wavy-edged, waxy-white petals  veined and striped with deep pink or wine color. The large ovate leaves,  long-tapering to a point, are rounded at the base into short petioles.  The rounded, three-angled, bright red, shining berry is seated in the  persistent calyx. With the same range as the nodding trillium's, the  Painted Wake-Robin comes into bloom nearly a month later--in May and  June--when all the birds are not only wide awake, but have finished  courting, and are busily engaged in the most serious business of life.      Purple Trillium, Ill-scented Wake-Robin, or Birth-root    _Trillium erectum_    _Flowers_--Solitary, dark, dull purple, or purplish red; rarely  greenish, white, or pinkish; on erect or slightly inclined footstalk.  Calyx of 3 spreading sepals, 1 to 1-1/2 in. long, or about length of 3  pointed, oval petals; stamens, 6; anthers longer than filaments; pistil  spreading into 3 short, recurved stigmas. _Stem:_ Stout, 8 to 16 in.  high, from tuber-like rootstock. _Leaves:_ In a whorl of 3; broadly  ovate, abruptly pointed, netted-veined. _Fruit:_ A 6-angled, ovate,  reddish berry.    _Preferred Habitat--Rich_, moist woods.    _Flowering Season_--April-June.    _Distribution_--Nova Scotia westward to Manitoba, southward to North  Carolina and Missouri.    Some weeks after the jubilant, alert robins have returned from the  South, the Purple Trillium unfurls its unattractive, carrion-scented  flower. In the variable colors found in different regions, one can  almost trace its evolution from green, white, and red to purple, which,  we are told, is the course all flowers must follow to attain to blue.  The white and pink forms, however attractive to the eye, are never more  agreeable to the nose than the reddish-purple ones. Bees and  butterflies, with delicate appreciation of color and fragrance, let the  blossom alone, since it secretes no nectar; and one would naturally  infer either that it can fertilize itself without insect aid--a theory  which closer study of its organs goes far to disprove--or that the  carrion-scent, so repellent to us, is in itself an attraction to certain  insects needful for cross-pollination. Which are they? Beetles have been  observed crawling over the flower, but without effecting any methodical  result. One inclines to accept Mr. Clarence M. Weed's theory of special  adaptation to the common green flesh-flies (_Lucilia carnicina_), which  would naturally be attracted to a flower resembling in color and odor a  raw beefsteak of uncertain age. These little creatures, seen in every  butcher shop throughout the summer, the flower furnishes with a free  lunch of pollen in consideration of the transportation of a few grains  to another blossom. Absence of the usual floral attractions gives the  carrion flies a practical monopoly of the pollen food, which no doubt  tastes as it smells.    The Sessile-flowered Wake-Robin (_T. sessile_), whose dark purple,  purplish-red, or greenish blossom, narrower of sepal and petals than the  preceding, is seated in a whorl of three egg-shaped, sometimes blotched,  leaves, possesses a rather pleasant odor; nevertheless, it seems to have  no great attraction for insects. The stigmas, which are very large,  almost touch the anthers surrounding them; therefore the beetles which  one frequently sees crawling over them to feed on the pollen so jar  them, no doubt, as to self-fertilize the flower; but it is scarcely  probable these slow crawlers often transfer the grains from one blossom  to another. A degraded flower like this has little need of color and  perfume, one would suppose; yet it may be even now slowly perfecting its  way toward an ideal of which we see a part only complete. In deep, rich,  moist woods and thickets the sessile trillium blooms in April or May,  from Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Minnesota southward nearly to the Gulf.      Carrion-flower    _Smilax herbacea_    _Flowers_--Carrion-scented, yellowish-green, 15 to 80 small, 6-parted  ones clustered in an umbel on a long peduncle. _Stem:_ Smooth, unarmed,  climbing with the help of tendril-like appendages from the base of  leafstalks. _Leaves:_ Egg-shaped, heart-shaped, or rounded, pointed  tipped, parallel-nerved, petioled. _Fruit:_ Bluish-black berries.    _Preferred Habitat_--Moist soil, thickets, woods, roadside fences.    _Flowering Season_--April-June.    _Distribution_--Northern Canada to the Gulf states, westward to  Nebraska.    \"It would be safe to say,\" says John Burroughs, \"that there is a species  of smilax with an unsavory name, that the bee does not visit,  _herbacea_. The production of this plant is a curious freak of  nature.... It would be a cruel joke to offer it to any person not  acquainted with it, to smell. It is like the vent of a charnel-house.\"  (Thoreau compared its odor to that of a dead rat in a wall!) \"It is  first cousin to the trilliums, among the prettiest of our native wild  flowers,\" continues Burroughs, \"and the same bad blood crops out in the  Purple Trillium or Birth-root.\"    Strange that so close an observer as Burroughs or Thoreau should not  have credited the carrion-flower with being something more intelligent  than a mere repellent freak! Like the Purple Trillium, it has  deliberately adapted itself to please its benefactors, the little green  flesh-flies so commonly seen about untidy butcher shops in summer.          AMARYLLIS FAMILY _(Amaryllidaceae)_      Yellow Star-grass    _Hypoxis hirsuta (H. erecta)_    _Flowers_--Bright yellow within, greenish and hairy outside, about 1/2  in. across, 6-parted; the perianth divisions spreading, narrowly oblong;  a few flowers at the summit of a rough, hairy scape 2 to 6 in. high.  _Leaves:_ All from an egg-shaped corm; mostly longer than scapes,  slender, grass-like, more or less hairy.    _Preferred Habitat_--Dry, open woods, prairies, grassy waste  places, fields.    _Flowering Season_--May-October.    _Distribution_--From Maine far westward, and south to the Gulf of  Mexico.    Usually only one of these little blossoms in a cluster on each plant  opens at a time; but that one peers upward so brightly from among the  grass it cannot well be overlooked. Sitting in a meadow sprinkled over  with these yellow stars, we see coming to them many small bees--chiefly  Halictus--to gather pollen for their unhatched babies' bread. Of course  they do not carry all the pollen to their tunnelled nurseries; some must  often be rubbed off on the sticky pistil tip in the centre of other  stars. The stamens radiate, that self-fertilization need not take place  except as a last extremity. Visitors failing, the little flower closes,  bringing its pollen-laden anthers in contact with its own stigma.            IRIS FAMILY _(Iridaceae)_      Larger Blue Flag; Blue Iris; Fleur-de-lis; Flower-de-luce    _Iris versicolor_    _Flowers_--Several, 2 to 3 in. long, violet-blue variegated with yellow,  green, or white, and purple veined. Six divisions of the perianth: 3  outer ones spreading, recurved; 1 of them bearded, much longer and wider  than the 3 erect inner divisions; all united into a short tube. Three  stamens under 3 overhanging petal-like divisions of the style, notched  at end; under each notch is a thin plate, smooth on one side, rough and  moist (stigma) on side turned away from anther. _Stem:_ 2 to 3 ft. high,  stout, straight, almost circular, sometimes branching above. _Leaves:_  Erect, sword-shaped, shorter than stem, somewhat hoary, from 1/2 to 1  in. wide, folded, and in a compact flat cluster at base; bracts usually  longer than stem of flower. _Fruit:_ Oblong capsule, not prominently  3-lobed, and with 2 rows of round, flat seeds closely packed in each  cell. _Rootstock:_ Creeping, horizontal, fleshy.    _Preferred Habitat_--Marshes, wet meadows.    _Flowering Season_--May-July.    _Distribution_--Newfoundland and Manitoba to Arkansas and Florida.    This gorgeous flower is thought by scientists to be all that it is for  the bees' benefit, which, of course, is its own also. Abundant moisture,  from which to manufacture nectar--a prime necessity with most  irises--certainly is for our blue flag. The large, showy blossom cannot  but attract the passing bee, whose favorite color (according to Sir John  Lubbock) it waves. The bee alights on the convenient, spreading  platform, and, guided by the dark veining and golden lines leading to  the nectar, sips the delectable fluid shortly to be changed to honey.  Now, as he raises his head and withdraws it from the nectary, he must  rub it against the pollen-laden anther above, and some of the pollen  necessarily falls on the visitor. As the sticky side of the plate  (stigma), just under the petal-like division of the style, faces away  from the anther, which is below it in any case, the flower is"]]]
