My only excuse for mentioning these details about the  Carters--now and later in the day--is that, while they have perhaps  not much interest for the average reader, they will no doubt be some  comfort to the parish over which he presided and where I am sure he  was loved. He next mentioned the absence of a service in the evening  and asked if I knew the purser well enough to request the use of the  saloon in the evening where he would like to have a \"hymn sing-song\";  the purser gave his consent at once, and Mr. Carter made preparations  during the afternoon by asking all he knew--and many he did not--to  come to the saloon at 8.30 P.M.    The library was crowded that afternoon, owing to the cold on deck: but  through the windows we could see the clear sky with brilliant sunlight  that seemed to augur a fine night and a clear day to-morrow, and the  prospect of landing in two days, with calm weather all the way to New  York, was a matter of general satisfaction among us all. I can look  back and see every detail of the library that afternoon--the  beautifully furnished room, with lounges, armchairs, and small writing  or card-tables scattered about, writing-bureaus round the walls of the  room, and the library in glass-cased shelves flanking one side,--the  whole finished in mahogany relieved with white fluted wooden columns  that supported the deck above. Through the windows there is the  covered corridor, reserved by general consent as the children's  playground, and here are playing the two Navatril children with their  father,--devoted to them, never absent from them. Who would have  thought of the dramatic history of the happy group at play in the  corridor that afternoon!--the abduction of the children in Nice, the  assumed name, the separation of father and children in a few hours,  his death and their subsequent union with their mother after a period  of doubt as to their parentage! How many more similar secrets the  Titanic revealed in the privacy of family life, or carried down with  her untold, we shall never know.    In the same corridor is a man and his wife with two children, and one  of them he is generally carrying: they are all young and happy: he is  dressed always in a grey knickerbocker suit--with a camera slung over  his shoulder. I have not seen any of them since that afternoon.    Close beside me--so near that I cannot avoid hearing scraps of their  conversation--are two American ladies, both dressed in white, young,  probably friends only: one has been to India and is returning by way  of England, the other is a school-teacher in America, a graceful girl  with a distinguished air heightened by a pair of _pince-nez_.  Engaged in conversation with them is a gentleman whom I subsequently  identified from a photograph as a well-known resident of Cambridge,  Massachusetts, genial, polished, and with a courtly air towards the  two ladies, whom he has known but a few hours; from time to time as  they talk, a child acquaintance breaks in on their conversation and  insists on their taking notice of a large doll clasped in her arms; I  have seen none of this group since then. In the opposite corner are  the young American kinematograph photographer and his young wife,  evidently French, very fond of playing patience, which she is doing  now, while he sits back in his chair watching the game and interposing  from time to time with suggestions. I did not see them again. In the  middle of the room are two Catholic priests, one quietly  reading,--either English or Irish, and probably the latter,--the  other, dark, bearded, with broad-brimmed hat, talking earnestly to a  friend in German and evidently explaining some verse in the open Bible  before him; near them a young fire engineer on his way to Mexico, and  of the same religion as the rest of the group. None of them were  saved. It may be noted here that the percentage of men saved in the  second-class is the lowest of any other division--only eight per cent.    Many other faces recur to thought, but it is impossible to describe  them all in the space of a short book: of all those in the library  that Sunday afternoon, I can remember only two or three persons who  found their way to the Carpathia. Looking over this room, with his  back to the library shelves, is the library steward, thin, stooping,  sad-faced, and generally with nothing to do but serve out books; but  this afternoon he is busier than I have ever seen him, serving out  baggage declaration-forms for passengers to fill in. Mine is before me  as I write: \"Form for nonresidents in the United States. Steamship  Titanic: No. 31444, D,\" etc. I had filled it in that afternoon and  slipped it in my pocket-book instead of returning it to the steward.  Before me, too, is a small cardboard square: \"White Star Line. R.M.S.  Titanic. 208. This label must be given up when the article is  returned. The property will be deposited in the Purser's safe. The  Company will not be liable to passengers for the loss of money,  jewels, or ornaments, by theft or otherwise, not so deposited.\" The  \"property deposited\" in my case was money, placed in an envelope,  sealed, with my name written across the flap, and handed to the  purser; the \"label\" is my receipt. Along with other similar envelopes  it may be still intact in the safe at the bottom of the sea, but in  all probability it is not, as will be seen presently.    After dinner, Mr. Carter invited all who wished to the saloon, and  with the assistance at the piano of a gentleman who sat at the  purser's table opposite me (a young Scotch engineer going out to join  his brother fruit-farming at the foot of the Rockies), he started some  hundred passengers singing hymns. They were asked to choose whichever  hymn they wished, and with so many to choose, it was impossible for  him to do more than have the greatest favourites sung. As he announced  each hymn, it was evident that he was thoroughly versed in their  history: no hymn was sung but that he gave a short sketch of its  author and in some cases a description of the circumstances in which  it was composed. I think all were impressed with his knowledge of  hymns and with his eagerness to tell us all he knew of them. It was  curious to see how many chose hymns dealing with dangers at sea. I  noticed the hushed tone with which all sang the hymn, \"For those in  peril on the Sea.\"    The singing must have gone on until after ten o'clock, when, seeing  the stewards standing about waiting to serve biscuits and coffee  before going off duty, Mr. Carter brought the evening to a close by a  few words of thanks to the purser for the use of the saloon, a short  sketch of the happiness and safety of the voyage hitherto, the great  confidence all felt on board this great liner with her steadiness and  her size, and the happy outlook of landing in a few hours in New York  at the close of a delightful voyage; and all the time he spoke, a few  miles ahead of us lay the \"peril on the sea\" that was to sink this  same great liner with many of those on board who listened with  gratitude to his simple, heartfelt words. So much for the frailty of  human hopes and for the confidence reposed in material human designs.    Think of the shame of it, that a mass of ice of no use to any one or  anything should have the power fatally to injure the beautiful  Titanic! That an insensible block should be able to threaten, even in  the smallest degree, the lives of many good men and women who think  and plan and hope and love--and not only to threaten, but to end their  lives. It is unbearable! Are we never to educate ourselves to foresee  such dangers and to prevent them before they happen? All the evidence  of history shows that laws unknown and unsuspected are being  discovered day by day: as this knowledge accumulates for the use of  man, is it not certain that the ability to see and destroy beforehand  the threat of danger will be one of the privileges the whole world  will utilize? May that day come soon. Until it does, no precaution too  rigorous can be taken, no safety appliance, however costly, must be  omitted from a ship's equipment.    After the meeting had broken up, I talked with the Carters over a cup  of coffee, said good-night to them, and retired to my cabin at about  quarter to eleven. They were good people and this world is much poorer  by their loss.    It may be a matter of pleasure to many people to know that their  friends were perhaps among that gathering of people in the saloon, and  that at the last the sound of the hymns still echoed in their ears as  they stood on the deck so quietly and courageously. Who can tell how  much it had to do with the demeanour of some of them and the example  this would set to others?          CHAPTER III    THE COLLISION AND EMBARKATION IN LIFEBOATS      I had been fortunate enough to secure a two-berth cabin to myself,--D  56,--quite close to the saloon and most convenient in every way for  getting about the ship; and on a big ship like the Titanic it was  quite a consideration to be on D deck, only three decks below the top  or boat-deck. Below D again were cabins on E and F decks, and to walk  from a cabin on F up to the top deck, climbing five flights of stairs  on the way, was certainly a considerable task for those not able to  take much exercise. The Titanic management has been criticised, among  other things, for supplying the boat with lifts: it has been said they  were an expensive luxury and the room they took up might have been  utilized in some way for more life-saving appliances. Whatever else  may have been superfluous, lifts certainly were not: old ladies, for  example, in cabins on F deck, would hardly have got to the top deck  during the whole voyage had they not been able to ring for the  lift-boy. Perhaps nothing gave one a greater impression of the size of  the ship than to take the lift from the top and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6677"],[0,"Seventy-Five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes and Sweetmeats, (#5)"],[1,"peach-leaves or kernels in the milk, and set it away to  cool. When cold, strain out the leaves or kernels, and stir in the  sugar. Beat the eggs very light, and stir them gradually into the  milk when it is quite cold. Bake it in cups, or in a large white  dish.    When cool, grate nutmeg over the top.      RICE CUSTARDS.      Half a pound of rice.    Half a pound of raisins or currants.    Eight yolks of eggs or six whole eggs.    Six ounces of powdered sugar.    A quart of rich milk.    A handful of peach-leaves, or half an ounce of peach-kernels,      broken in pieces.    Half an ounce of cinnamon, broken in pieces.    Boil the rice with the raisins or currants, which must first be  floured. Butter some cups or a mould, and when the rice is quite  soft, drain it, and put it into them. Set it away to get cold.    Beat the eggs well. Boil the milk with the cinnamon and  peach-leaves, or kernels. As soon as it has come to a boil, take  it off and strain it through a sieve. Then set it again on the  fire, stir into it alternately, the egg and sugar, taking it off  frequently and stirring it hard, lest it become a curd. Take care  not to boil it too long, or it will be lumpy and lose its flavour.  When done, set it away to cool. Turn out the rice from the cups or  mould, into a deep dish. Pour some of the boiled custard over it,  and send up the remainder of the custard in a sauce-boat.    You may, if you choose, ornament the lumps of rice, (after the  custard is poured round them) by making a stiff froth of white of  egg (beaten till it stands alone) and a few drops of essence of  lemon, with a very little powdered loaf-sugar. Heap the froth on  the top of each lump of rice.      COLD CUSTARDS.      A quart of new milk, and a half a pint of cream, mixed.    A quarter of a pound of powdered white sugar.    A large glass of white wine, in which an inch of washed rennet has      been soaked.    A nutmeg.    Mix together the milk, cream, and sugar. Stir the wine into it,  and pour the mixture into your custard-cups. Set them in a warm  place near the fire, till they become a firm curd. Then set them  on ice, or in a very cold place. Grate nutmeg over them.      CURDS AND WHEY.    Take a small piece of rennet about two inches square. Wash it very  clean in cold water, to get all the salt off, and wipe it dry. Put  it in a tea-cup, and pour on it just enough of lukewarm water to  cover it. Let it set all night, or, for several hours. Then take  out the rennet, and stir the water in which it was soaked, into a  quart of milk, which should be in a broad dish.    Set the milk in a warm place, till it becomes a firm curd. As soon  as the curd is completely made, set it in a cool place, or on ice  (if in summer) for two or three hours before you want to use it.    Eat it with wine, sugar, and nutmeg.    The whey, drained from the curd, is an excellent drink for  invalids.      A TRIFLE.      A quart of cream.    A quarter of a pound of loaf sugar, powdered.    Half a pint of white wine and Half a gill of brandy mixed.    Eight maccaroons, or more if you choose.    Four small sponge-cakes or Naples biscuit.    Two ounces of blanched sweet almonds, pounded in a mortar.    One ounce of blanched bitter almonds or peach-kernels.    The juice and grated peel of two lemons.    A nutmeg, grated.    A glass of noyau.    A pint of rich baked custard, made of the yolks of eggs.    Pound the sweet and bitter almonds to a smooth paste, adding a  little rose-water as you pound them.    Grate the yellow peels of the lemons, and squeeze the juice into a  saucer.    Break the sponge cake and maccaroons into small pieces, mix them  with the almonds, and lay them in the bottom of a large glass  bowl. Grate a nutmeg over them, and the juice and peel of the  lemons. Add the wine and brandy, and let the mixture remain  untouched, till the cakes are dissolved in the liquor. Then stir  it a little.    Mix the cream and sugar with a glass of noyau, and beat it with a  whisk or rods, till it stands alone.    As the froth rises, take it off with a spoon, and lay it on a  sieve (with a large dish under it) to drain. The cream, that  drains into the dish, must be poured back into the pan with the  rest, and beaten over again. When the cream is finished, set it in  a cool place.    When the custard is cold, poor it into the glass bowl upon the  dissolved cakes, &c. and when the cream is ready, fill up the bowl  with it, heaping it high in the middle. You may ornament it with  nonpareils.    If you choose, you can put in, between the custard and the frothed  cream, a layer of fruit jelly, or small fruit preserved.      WHIPT CREAM.      A quart of cream.    The whites of four eggs.    Half a pint of white wine.    A quarter of a pound of powdered loaf-sugar.    Tea drops of strong essence of lemon, or two lemons cut in thin      slices, or the juice of a large lemon.    Mix together, in a broad pan, all the ingredients, unless you use  slices of lemon, and then they must be laid at intervals among the  froth, as you heap it in the bowl.    With a whisk or rods, beat the cream to a strong froth. Have  beside your pan a sieve (bottom upwards) with a large dish under  it. As the froth rises, take it lightly off with a spoon, and lay  it on the sieve to drain. When the top of the sieve is full,  transfer the froth to a large glass or china bowl. Continue to do  this till the bowl is full.    The cream which has dropped through the sieve into the dish, must  be poured into the pan, and beaten over again. When all the cream  is converted into froth, pile it up in the bowl, making it highest  in the middle.    If you choose, you may ornament it with red and green nonpareils.    If you put it in glasses, lay a little jelly in the bottom of each  glass, and pile the cream on it.    Keep it in a cool place till you want to use it.      FLOATING ISLAND.      Six whites of eggs.    Six large table-spoonfuls of jelly.    A pint of cream.    Put the jelly and white of egg into a pan, and beat it together  with a whisk, till it becomes a stiff froth and stands alone.    Have ready the cream, in a broad shallow dish. Just before you  send it to table, pile up the froth in the centre of the cream.      ICE CREAM.      A quart of rich cream.    Half a pound of powdered loaf sugar.    The juice of two large lemons, or a pint of strawberries or      raspberries.    Put the cream into a broad pan. Then stir in the sugar by degrees,  and when all is well mixed, strain it through a sieve.    Put it into a tin that has a close cover, and set it in a tub.  Fill the tub with ice broken into very small pieces, and strew  among the ice a large quantity of salt, taking care that none of  the salt gets into the cream. Scrape the cream down with a spoon  as it freezes round the edges of the tin. While the cream is  freezing, stir in gradually the lemon-juice, or the juice of a  pint of mashed strawberries or raspberries. When it is all frozen,  dip the tin in lukewarm water; take out the cream, and fill your  glasses; but not till a few minutes before you want to use it, as  it will very soon melt.    You may heighten the colour of the red fruit, by a little  cochineal.    If you wish to have it in moulds, put the cream into them as soon  as it has frozen in the tin. Set the moulds in a tub of ice and  salt. Just before you want to use the cream, take the moulds out  of the tub, wipe or wash the salt carefully from the outside, dip  the moulds in lukewarm water, and turn out the cream.    You may flavour a quart of ice-cream with two ounces of sweet  almonds and one ounce of bitter almonds, blanched and beaten in a  mortar with a little rose-water to a smooth paste. Stir in the  almonds gradually while the cream is freezing.      ANOTHER KIND OF ICE-CREAM.      A pint and a half of rich cream.    A quart and a half-pint of morning's milk.    One pound of loaf sugar.    Two eggs.    One table-spoonful of flour.    Two lemons.    Or half a Vanilla bean, split into small pieces.    Or two ounces of sweet almonds and once ounce of bitter almonds,      blanched and split into pieces.    Take half of the milk and put in the ingredient that is to flavour  it, either the vanilla, the almonds, or the grated rind of the  lemons. Boil it, stirring in gradually the sugar.    Having beaten the eggs well, add to them two table-spoonfuls of  cold milk, and pour them into the boiling milk. Let them simmer  two or three minutes, stirring them all the time. Then take the  mixture off the fire and strain it through book-muslin into a pan.  Add the cream and the remainder of the milk, and put the whole  into the tin freezer, which must be set in a tub filled with ice,  among which must be scattered a great deal of salt.    Squeeze the juice from the two lemons and stir it into the cream,  by degrees, while it is freezing.    When it is all frozen, turn it out, first dipping the tin for a  moment in warm water.    If you wish to flavour it with strawberry or raspberry juice,  that, like the lemon-juice, must be stirred gradually in while the  cream is freezing.    In places where cream is not abundant, this receipt (though  inferior in richness) will be found more economical than the  preceding one. It is, however, less easy and expeditious.      CALF'S-FEET JELLY.      Eight calf's feet.    Three quarts of water.    A pint of white wine.    Three lemons.    The whites of six eggs.    Half an ounce of cinnamon.    Half a pound of loaf-sugar, broken into lumps.    Endeavour to procure calf's-feet, that have been nicely singed,  but not skinned, as the skin being left on, makes the jelly much  firmer.    The day before you want to use the jelly, boil the eight  calf's-feet in three quarts of water, till the meat drops from the  bone. When sufficiently done, put it into a collender or sieve,  and let the liquid drain from the meat, into a broad pan or dish.  Skim off the fat. Let the jelly stand till "]]]
