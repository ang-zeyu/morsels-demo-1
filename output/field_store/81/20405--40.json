[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/754"],[0,"The Story of Mankind (#5)"],[1,"what we now call \"phonetic  writing\"--a system of characters which reproduce the \"sound\" (or phone)  of the spoken word and which make it possible for us to translate all  our spoken words into a written form, with the help of only a few dots  and dashes and pothooks.    Let us return for a moment to the little fellow with the saw. The word  \"saw\" either means a certain tool which you will find in a carpenter's  shop, or it means the past tense of the verb \"to see.\"    This is what had happened to the word during the course of centuries.  First of all it had meant only the particular tool which it represented.  Then that meaning had been lost and it had become the past participle  of a verb. After several hundred years, the Egyptians lost sight of  both these meanings and the picture {illust.} came to stand for a single  letter, the letter S. A short sentence will show you what I mean.  Here is a modern English sentence as it would have been written in  hieroglyphics. {illust.}    The {illust.} either means one of these two round objects in your head,  which allow you to see or it means \"I,\" the person who is talking.    A {illust.} is either an insect which gathers honey, or it represents  the verb \"to be\" which means to exist. Again, it may be the first part  of a verb like \"be-come\" or \"be-have.\" In this particular instance it  is followed by {illust.} which means a \"leaf\" or \"leave\" or \"lieve\" (the  sound of all three words is the same).    The \"eye\" you know all about.    Finally you get the picture of a {illust.}. It is a giraffe It is part  of the old sign-language out of which the hieroglyphics developed.    You can now read that sentence without much difficulty.    \"I believe I saw a giraffe.\"    Having invented this system the Egyptians developed it during thousands  of years until they could write anything they wanted, and they used  these \"canned words\" to send messages to friends, to keep business  accounts and to keep a record of the history of their country, that  future generations might benefit by the mistakes of the past.          THE NILE VALLEY    THE BEGINNING OF CIVILISATION IN THE VALLEY OF THE NILE      THE history of man is the record of a hungry creature in search of food.  Wherever food was plentiful, thither man has travelled to make his home.    The fame of the Valley of the Nile must have spread at an early date.  From the interior of Africa and from the desert of Arabia and from the  western part of Asia people had flocked to Egypt to claim their share  of the rich farms. Together these invaders had formed a new race which  called itself \"Remi\" or \"the Men\" just as we sometimes call America  \"God's own country.\" They had good reason to be grateful to a Fate which  had carried them to this narrow strip of land. In the summer of each  year the Nile turned the valley into a shallow lake and when the waters  receded all the grainfields and the pastures were covered with several  inches of the most fertile clay.    In Egypt a kindly river did the work of a million men and made it  possible to feed the teeming population of the first large cities of  which we have any record. It is true that all the arable land was not  in the valley. But a complicated system of small canals and well-sweeps  carried water from the river-level to the top of the highest banks  and an even more intricate system of irrigation trenches spread it  throughout the land.    While man of the prehistoric age had been obliged to spend sixteen hours  out of every twenty-four gathering food for himself and the members of  his tribe, the Egyptian peasant or the inhabitant of the Egyptian city  found himself possessed of a certain leisure. He used this spare time  to make himself many things that were merely ornamental and not in the  least bit useful.    More than that. One day he discovered that his brain was capable of  thinking all kinds of thoughts which had nothing to do with the problems  of eating and sleeping and finding a home for the children. The Egyptian  began to speculate upon many strange problems that confronted him.  Where did the stars come from? Who made the noise of the thunder which  frightened him so terribly? Who made the River Nile rise with such  regularity that it was possible to base the calendar upon the appearance  and the disappearance of the annual floods? Who was he, himself, a  strange little creature surrounded on all sides by death and sickness  and yet happy and full of laughter?    He asked these many questions and certain people obligingly stepped  forward to answer these inquiries to the best of their ability. The  Egyptians called them \"priests\" and they became the guardians of his  thoughts and gained great respect in the community. They were highly  learned men who were entrusted with the sacred task of keeping the  written records. They understood that it is not good for man to  think only of his immediate advantage in this world and they drew his  attention to the days of the future when his soul would dwell beyond the  mountains of the west and must give an account of his deeds to Osiris,  the mighty God who was the Ruler of the Living and the Dead and who  judged the acts of men according to their merits. Indeed, the priests  made so much of that future day in the realm of Isis and Osiris that  the Egyptians began to regard life merely as a short preparation for the  Hereafter and turned the teeming valley of the Nile into a land devoted  to the Dead.    In a strange way, the Egyptians had come to believe that no soul could  enter the realm of Osiris without the possession of the body which had  been its place of residence in this world. Therefore as soon as a man  was dead his relatives took his corpse and had it embalmed. For weeks  it was soaked in a solution of natron and then it was filled with pitch.  The Persian word for pitch was \"Mumiai\" and the embalmed body was called  a \"Mummy.\" It was wrapped in yards and yards of specially prepared linen  and it was placed in a specially prepared coffin ready to be removed to  its final home. But an Egyptian grave was a real home where the body was  surrounded by pieces of furniture and musical instruments (to while away  the dreary hours of waiting) and by little statues of cooks and bakers  and barbers (that the occupant of this dark home might be decently  provided with food and need not go about unshaven).    Originally these graves had been dug into the rocks of the western  mountains but as the Egyptians moved northward they were obliged to  build their cemeteries in the desert. The desert however is full of  wild animals and equally wild robbers and they broke into the graves and  disturbed the mummy or stole the jewelry that had been buried with the  body. To prevent such unholy desecration the Egyptians used to build  small mounds of stones on top of the graves. These little mounds  gradually grew in size, because the rich people built higher mounds than  the poor and there was a good deal of competition to see who could make  the highest hill of stones. The record was made by King Khufu, whom the  Greeks called Cheops and who lived thirty centuries before our era. His  mound, which the Greeks called a pyramid (because the Egyptian word for  high was pir-em-us) was over five hundred feet high.    It covered more than thirteen acres of desert which is three times as  much space as that occupied by the church of St. Peter, the largest  edifice of the Christian world.    During twenty years, over a hundred thousand men were busy carrying the  necessary stones from the other side of the river--ferrying them across  the Nile (how they ever managed to do this, we do not understand),  dragging them in many instances a long distance across the desert and  finally hoisting them into their correct position. But so well did  the King's architects and engineers perform their task that the narrow  passage-way which leads to the royal tomb in the heart of the stone  monster has never yet been pushed out of shape by the weight of those  thousands of tons of stone which press upon it from all sides.          THE STORY OF EGYPT    THE RISE AND FALL OF EGYPT      THE river Nile was a kind friend but occasionally it was a hard  taskmaster. It taught the people who lived along its banks the noble art  of \"team-work.\" They depended upon each other to build their irrigation  trenches and keep their dikes in repair. In this way they learned how  to get along with their neighbours and their mutual-benefit-association  quite easily developed into an organised state.    Then one man grew more powerful than most of his neighbours and he  became the leader of the community and their commander-in-chief when the  envious neighbours of western Asia invaded the prosperous valley. In  due course of time he became their King and ruled all the land from the  Mediterranean to the mountains of the west.    But these political adventures of the old Pharaohs (the word meant  \"the Man who lived in the Big House\") rarely interested the patient and  toiling peasant of the grain fields. Provided he was not obliged to pay  more taxes to his King than he thought just, he accepted the rule of  Pharaoh as he accepted the rule of Mighty Osiris.    It was different however when a foreign invader came and robbed him of  his possessions. After twenty centuries of independent life, a savage  Arab tribe of shepherds, called the Hyksos, attacked Egypt and for five  hundred years they were the masters of the valley of the Nile. They were  highly un-popular and great hate was also felt for the Hebrews who  came to the land of Goshen to find a shelter after their long wandering  through the desert and who helped the foreign usurper by acting as his  tax-gatherers and his civil servants.    But shortly after the year 1700 B.C. the people of Thebes began a  revolution and after a long struggle the Hyksos were driven out of the  country and Egypt was free once more.

I had reached that stage of  sleepiness when Peggotty seemed to swell and grow immensely large.  I propped my eyelids open with my two forefingers, and looked  perseveringly at her as she sat at work; at the little bit of wax-candle  she kept for her thread--how old it looked, being so wrinkled in  all directions!--at the little house with a thatched roof, where the  yard-measure lived; at her work-box with a sliding lid, with a view of  St. Paul's Cathedral (with a pink dome) painted on the top; at the brass  thimble on her finger; at herself, whom I thought lovely. I felt so  sleepy, that I knew if I lost sight of anything for a moment, I was  gone.    'Peggotty,' says I, suddenly, 'were you ever married?'    'Lord, Master Davy,' replied Peggotty. 'What's put marriage in your  head?'    She answered with such a start, that it quite awoke me. And then she  stopped in her work, and looked at me, with her needle drawn out to its  thread's length.    'But WERE you ever married, Peggotty?' says I. 'You are a very handsome  woman, an't you?'    I thought her in a different style from my mother, certainly; but of  another school of beauty, I considered her a perfect example. There  was a red velvet footstool in the best parlour, on which my mother  had painted a nosegay. The ground-work of that stool, and Peggotty's  complexion appeared to me to be one and the same thing. The stool was  smooth, and Peggotty was rough, but that made no difference.    'Me handsome, Davy!' said Peggotty. 'Lawk, no, my dear! But what put  marriage in your head?'    'I don't know!--You mustn't marry more than one person at a time, may  you, Peggotty?'    'Certainly not,' says Peggotty, with the promptest decision.    'But if you marry a person, and the person dies, why then you may marry  another person, mayn't you, Peggotty?'    'YOU MAY,' says Peggotty, 'if you choose, my dear. That's a matter of  opinion.'    'But what is your opinion, Peggotty?' said I.    I asked her, and looked curiously at her, because she looked so  curiously at me.    'My opinion is,' said Peggotty, taking her eyes from me, after a little  indecision and going on with her work, 'that I never was married myself,  Master Davy, and that I don't expect to be. That's all I know about the  subject.'    'You an't cross, I suppose, Peggotty, are you?' said I, after sitting  quiet for a minute.    I really thought she was, she had been so short with me; but I was quite  mistaken: for she laid aside her work (which was a stocking of her own),  and opening her arms wide, took my curly head within them, and gave it  a good squeeze. I know it was a good squeeze, because, being very plump,  whenever she made any little exertion after she was dressed, some of the  buttons on the back of her gown flew off. And I recollect two bursting  to the opposite side of the parlour, while she was hugging me.    'Now let me hear some more about the Crorkindills,' said Peggotty, who  was not quite right in the name yet, 'for I an't heard half enough.'    I couldn't quite understand why Peggotty looked so queer, or why she  was so ready to go back to the crocodiles. However, we returned to those  monsters, with fresh wakefulness on my part, and we left their eggs in  the sand for the sun to hatch; and we ran away from them, and baffled  them by constantly turning, which they were unable to do quickly, on  account of their unwieldy make; and we went into the water after them,  as natives, and put sharp pieces of timber down their throats; and in  short we ran the whole crocodile gauntlet. I did, at least; but I had  my doubts of Peggotty, who was thoughtfully sticking her needle into  various parts of her face and arms, all the time.    We had exhausted the crocodiles, and begun with the alligators, when  the garden-bell rang. We went out to the door; and there was my mother,  looking unusually pretty, I thought, and with her a gentleman with  beautiful black hair and whiskers, who had walked home with us from  church last Sunday.    As my mother stooped down on the threshold to take me in her arms and  kiss me, the gentleman said I was a more highly privileged little fellow  than a monarch--or something like that; for my later understanding  comes, I am sensible, to my aid here.    'What does that mean?' I asked him, over her shoulder.    He patted me on the head; but somehow, I didn't like him or his deep  voice, and I was jealous that his hand should touch my mother's in  touching me--which it did. I put it away, as well as I could.    'Oh, Davy!' remonstrated my mother.    'Dear boy!' said the gentleman. 'I cannot wonder at his devotion!'    I never saw such a beautiful colour on my mother's face before. She  gently chid me for being rude; and, keeping me close to her shawl,  turned to thank the gentleman for taking so much trouble as to bring her  home. She put out her hand to him as she spoke, and, as he met it with  his own, she glanced, I thought, at me.    'Let us say \"good night\", my fine boy,' said the gentleman, when he had  bent his head--I saw him!--over my mother's little glove.    'Good night!' said I.    'Come! Let us be the best friends in the world!' said the gentleman,  laughing. 'Shake hands!'    My right hand was in my mother's left, so I gave him the other.    'Why, that's the Wrong hand, Davy!' laughed the gentleman.    My mother drew my right hand forward, but I was resolved, for my former  reason, not to give it him, and I did not. I gave him the other, and he  shook it heartily, and said I was a brave fellow, and went away.    At this minute I see him turn round in the garden, and give us a last  look with his ill-omened black eyes, before the door was shut.    Peggotty, who had not said a word or moved a finger, secured the  fastenings instantly, and we all went into the parlour. My mother,  contrary to her usual habit, instead of coming to the elbow-chair by the  fire, remained at the other end of the room, and sat singing to herself.  --'Hope you have had a pleasant evening, ma'am,' said Peggotty, standing  as stiff as a barrel in the centre of the room, with a candlestick in  her hand.    'Much obliged to you, Peggotty,' returned my mother, in a cheerful  voice, 'I have had a VERY pleasant evening.'    'A stranger or so makes an agreeable change,' suggested Peggotty.    'A very agreeable change, indeed,' returned my mother.    Peggotty continuing to stand motionless in the middle of the room, and  my mother resuming her singing, I fell asleep, though I was not so sound  asleep but that I could hear voices, without hearing what they said.  When I half awoke from this uncomfortable doze, I found Peggotty and my  mother both in tears, and both talking.    'Not such a one as this, Mr. Copperfield wouldn't have liked,' said  Peggotty. 'That I say, and that I swear!'    'Good Heavens!' cried my mother, 'you'll drive me mad! Was ever any  poor girl so ill-used by her servants as I am! Why do I do myself  the injustice of calling myself a girl? Have I never been married,  Peggotty?'    'God knows you have, ma'am,' returned Peggotty. 'Then, how can you  dare,' said my mother--'you know I don't mean how can you dare,  Peggotty, but how can you have the heart--to make me so uncomfortable  and say such bitter things to me, when you are well aware that I  haven't, out of this place, a single friend to turn to?'    'The more's the reason,' returned Peggotty, 'for saying that it won't  do. No! That it won't do. No! No price could make it do. No!'--I thought  Peggotty would have thrown the candlestick away, she was so emphatic  with it.    'How can you be so aggravating,' said my mother, shedding more tears  than before, 'as to talk in such an unjust manner! How can you go on as  if it was all settled and arranged, Peggotty, when I tell you over  and over again, you cruel thing, that beyond the commonest civilities  nothing has passed! You talk of admiration. What am I to do? If people  are so silly as to indulge the sentiment, is it my fault? What am I to  do, I ask you? Would you wish me to shave my head and black my face, or  disfigure myself with a burn, or a scald, or something of that sort? I  dare say you would, Peggotty. I dare say you'd quite enjoy it.'    Peggotty seemed to take this aspersion very much to heart, I thought.    'And my dear boy,' cried my mother, coming to the elbow-chair in which  I was, and caressing me, 'my own little Davy! Is it to be hinted to me  that I am wanting in affection for my precious treasure, the dearest  little fellow that ever was!'    'Nobody never went and hinted no such a thing,' said Peggotty.    'You did, Peggotty!' returned my mother. 'You know you did. What else  was it possible to infer from what you said, you unkind creature,  when you know as well as I do, that on his account only last quarter I  wouldn't buy myself a new parasol, though that old green one is frayed  the whole way up, and the fringe is perfectly mangy? You know it is,  Peggotty. You can't deny it.' Then, turning affectionately to me, with  her cheek against mine, 'Am I a naughty mama to you, Davy? Am I a nasty,  cruel, selfish, bad mama? Say I am, my child; say \"yes\", dear boy, and  Peggotty will love you; and Peggotty's love is a great deal better than  mine, Davy. I don't love you at all, do I?'    At this, we all fell a-crying together. I think I was the loudest of  the party, but I am sure we were all sincere about it. I was quite  heart-broken myself, and am afraid that in the first transports of  wounded tenderness I called Peggotty a 'Beast'. That honest creature was  in deep affliction, I remember, and must have become quite buttonless  on the occasion; for a little volley of those explosives went off,  when, after having made it up with my mother, she kneeled down by the  elbow-chair, and made it up with me.    We went to bed greatly dejected. My sobs kept waking me, for a long  time; and when one very strong sob quite"]]]
