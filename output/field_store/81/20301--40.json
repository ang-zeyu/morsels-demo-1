Ghosts were unchancy folk, even if they  were our family ghosts. The Story Girl had made the tale very real to  us. We were glad we had not heard it in the evening. How could we ever  have got back to the house through the shadows and swaying branches of a  darkening orchard? As it was, we were almost afraid to look up it, lest  we should see the waiting, blue-clad Emily under Uncle Alec's tree.  But all we saw was Felicity, tearing over the green sward, her curls  streaming behind her in a golden cloud.    \"Felicity's afraid she's missed something,\" remarked the Story Girl in  a tone of quiet amusement. \"Is your breakfast ready, Felicity, or have I  time to tell the boys the Story of the Poet Who Was Kissed?\"    \"Breakfast is ready, but we can't have it till father is through  attending to the sick cow, so you will likely have time,\" answered  Felicity.    Felix and I couldn't keep our eyes off her. Crimson-cheeked,  shining-eyed from her haste, her face was like a rose of youth. But when  the Story Girl spoke, we forgot to look at Felicity.    \"About ten years after Grandfather and Grandmother King were married, a  young man came to visit them. He was a distant relative of grandmother's  and he was a Poet. He was just beginning to be famous. He was VERY  famous afterward. He came into the orchard to write a poem, and he fell  asleep with his head on a bench that used to be under grandfather's  tree. Then Great-Aunt Edith came into the orchard. She was not a  Great-Aunt then, of course. She was only eighteen, with red lips and  black, black hair and eyes. They say she was always full of mischief.  She had been away and had just come home, and she didn't know about the  Poet. But when she saw him, sleeping there, she thought he was a cousin  they had been expecting from Scotland. And she tiptoed up--so--and bent  over--so--and kissed his cheek. Then he opened his big blue eyes and  looked up into Edith's face. She blushed as red as a rose, for she  knew she had done a dreadful thing. This could not be her cousin from  Scotland. She knew, for he had written so to her, that he had eyes as  black as her own. Edith ran away and hid; and of course she felt still  worse when she found out that he was a famous poet. But he wrote one of  his most beautiful poems on it afterwards and sent it to her--and it was  published in one of his books.\"    We had SEEN it all--the sleeping genius--the roguish, red-lipped  girl--the kiss dropped as lightly as a rose-petal on the sunburned  cheek.    \"They should have got married,\" said Felix.    \"Well, in a book they would have, but you see this was in real life,\"  said the Story Girl. \"We sometimes act the story out. I like it when  Peter plays the poet. I don't like it when Dan is the poet because he  is so freckled and screws his eyes up so tight. But you can hardly ever  coax Peter to be the poet--except when Felicity is Edith--and Dan is so  obliging that way.\"    \"What is Peter like?\" I asked.    \"Peter is splendid. His mother lives on the Markdale road and washes  for a living. Peter's father ran away and left them when Peter was only  three years old. He has never come back, and they don't know whether he  is alive or dead. Isn't that a nice way to behave to your family? Peter  has worked for his board ever since he was six. Uncle Roger sends him  to school, and pays him wages in summer. We all like Peter, except  Felicity.\"    \"I like Peter well enough in his place,\" said Felicity primly, \"but you  make far too much of him, mother says. He is only a hired boy, and he  hasn't been well brought up, and hasn't much education. I don't think  you should make such an equal of him as you do.\"    Laughter rippled over the Story Girl's face as shadow waves go over ripe  wheat before a wind.    \"Peter is a real gentleman, and he is more interesting than YOU could  ever be, if you were brought up and educated for a hundred years,\" she  said.    \"He can hardly write,\" said Felicity.    \"William the Conqueror couldn't write at all,\" said the Story Girl  crushingly.    \"He never goes to church, and he never says his prayers,\" retorted  Felicity, uncrushed.    \"I do, too,\" said Peter himself, suddenly appearing through a little gap  in the hedge. \"I say my prayers sometimes.\"    This Peter was a slim, shapely fellow, with laughing black eyes and  thick black curls. Early in the season as it was, he was barefooted. His  attire consisted of a faded, gingham shirt and a scanty pair of corduroy  knickerbockers; but he wore it with such an unconscious air of purple  and fine linen that he seemed to be much better dressed than he really  was.    \"You don't pray very often,\" insisted Felicity.    \"Well, God will be all the more likely to listen to me if I don't pester  Him all the time,\" argued Peter.    This was rank heresy to Felicity, but the Story Girl looked as if she  thought there might be something in it.    \"You NEVER go to church, anyhow,\" continued Felicity, determined not to  be argued down.    \"Well, I ain't going to church till I've made up my mind whether I'm  going to be a Methodist or a Presbyterian. Aunt Jane was a Methodist.  My mother ain't much of anything but I mean to be something. It's more  respectable to be a Methodist or a Presbyterian, or SOMETHING, than not  to be anything. When I've settled what I'm to be I'm going to church  same as you.\"    \"That's not the same as being BORN something,\" said Felicity loftily.    \"I think it's a good deal better to pick your own religion than have to  take it just because it was what your folks had,\" retorted Peter.    \"Now, never mind quarrelling,\" said Cecily. \"You leave Peter alone,  Felicity. Peter, this is Beverley King, and this is Felix. And we're all  going to be good friends and have a lovely summer together. Think of the  games we can have! But if you go squabbling you'll spoil it all. Peter,  what are you going to do to-day?\"    \"Harrow the wood field and dig your Aunt Olivia's flower beds.\"    \"Aunt Olivia and I planted sweet peas yesterday,\" said the Story Girl,  \"and I planted a little bed of my own. I am NOT going to dig them up  this year to see if they have sprouted. It is bad for them. I shall try  to cultivate patience, no matter how long they are coming up.\"    \"I am going to help mother plant the vegetable garden to-day,\" said  Felicity.    \"Oh, I never like the vegetable garden,\" said the Story Girl. \"Except  when I am hungry. Then I DO like to go and look at the nice little rows  of onions and beets. But I love a flower garden. I think I could be  always good if I lived in a garden all the time.\"    \"Adam and Eve lived in a garden all the time,\" said Felicity, \"and THEY  were far from being always good.\"    \"They mightn't have kept good as long as they did if they hadn't lived  in a garden,\" said the Story Girl.    We were now summoned to breakfast. Peter and the Story Girl slipped away  through the gap, followed by Paddy, and the rest of us walked up the  orchard to the house.    \"Well, what do you think of the Story Girl?\" asked Felicity.    \"She's just fine,\" said Felix, enthusiastically. \"I never heard anything  like her to tell stories.\"    \"She can't cook,\" said Felicity, \"and she hasn't a good complexion. Mind  you, she says she's going to be an actress when she grows up. Isn't that  dreadful?\"    We didn't exactly see why.    \"Oh, because actresses are always wicked people,\" said Felicity in a  shocked tone. \"But I daresay the Story Girl will go and be one just as  soon as she can. Her father will back her up in it. He is an artist, you  know.\"    Evidently Felicity thought artists and actresses and all such poor trash  were members one of another.    \"Aunt Olivia says the Story Girl is fascinating,\" said Cecily.    The very adjective! Felix and I recognized its beautiful fitness at  once. Yes, the Story Girl WAS fascinating and that was the final word to  be said on the subject.    Dan did not come down until breakfast was half over, and Aunt Janet  talked to him after a fashion which made us realize that it would be  well to keep, as the piquant country phrase went, from the rough side  of her tongue. But all things considered, we liked the prospect of our  summer very much. Felicity to look at--the Story Girl to tell us tales  of wonder--Cecily to admire us--Dan and Peter to play with--what more  could reasonable fellows want?        CHAPTER IV. THE WEDDING VEIL OF THE PROUD PRINCESS    When we had lived for a fortnight in Carlisle we belonged there, and the  freedom of all its small fry was conferred on us. With Peter and Dan,  with Felicity and Cecily and the Story Girl, with pale, gray-eyed little  Sara Ray, we were boon companions. We went to school, of course;  and certain home chores were assigned to each of us for the faithful  performance of which we were held responsible. But we had long hours for  play. Even Peter had plenty of spare time when the planting was over.    We got along very well with each other in the main, in spite of some  minor differences of opinion. As for the grown-up denizens of our small  world, they suited us also.    We adored Aunt Olivia; she was pretty and merry and kind; and, above  all, she had mastered to perfection the rare art of letting children  alone. If we kept ourselves tolerably clean, and refrained from  quarrelling or talking slang, Aunt Olivia did not worry us. Aunt Janet,  on the contrary, gave us so much good advice and was so constantly  telling us to do this or not to do the other thing, that we could not  remember half her instructions, and did not try.    Uncle Roger was, as we had been informed, quite jolly and fond of  teasing. We liked him; but we had an uncomfortable feeling that the  meaning of his remarks was not always that which met the ear. Sometimes  we believed Uncle Roger was making fun of us, and the deadly seriousness  of youth in us resented that.    To Uncle"]]]
