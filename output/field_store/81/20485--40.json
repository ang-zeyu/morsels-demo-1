And not a day goes by that he  doesn't handle them.\"    \"Certainly the effect of blood, eh?\" suggested Vance.    She glanced sharply at him.    \"You're determined to be disagreeable today, Vance. As a matter of fact,  I've convinced him that for the very reason he is so accurate with a gun  he must never enter a gun fight. The advantage would be too much on his  side against any ordinary man. That appeals to Terry's sense of fair  play. No, he's absolutely safe, no matter how you look at it.\"    \"No doubt.\"    He looked away from her and over the valley. The day had worn into the  late afternoon. Bear Creek ran dull and dark in the shadow, and Mount  Discovery was robed in blue to the very edge of its shining crown of  snow. In this dimmer, richer light the Cornish ranch had never seemed so  desirable to Vance. It was not a ranch; it was a little kingdom. And  Vance was the dispossessed heir.    He knew that he was being watched, however, and all that evening he was  at his best. At the dinner table he guided the talk so that Terence Colby  was the lion of the conversation. Afterward, when he was packing his  things in his room for his journey of the next day, he was careful to  sing at the top of his voice. He reaped a reward for this cautious  acting, for the next morning, when he climbed into the buckboard that was  to take him down the Blue Mountain road and over to the railroad, his  sister came down the steps and stood beside the wagon.    \"You _will_ come back for the birthday party, Vance?\" she pleaded.    \"You want me to?\"    \"You were with me when I got Terry. In fact, you got him for me. And I  want you to be here when he steps into his own.\"    In this he found enough to keep him thoughtful all the way to the  railroad while the buckskins grunted up the grade and then spun away down  the long slope beyond. It was one of those little ironies of fate that he  should have picked up the very man who was to disinherit him some twenty-  four years later.    He carried no grudge against Elizabeth, but he certainly retained no  tenderness. Hereafter he would act his part as well as he could to  extract the last possible penny out of her. And in the meantime he must  concentrate on tripping up Terence Colby, alias Hollis.    Vance saw nothing particularly vicious in this. He had been idle so long  that he rejoiced in a work which was within his mental range. It included  scheming, working always behind the scenes, pulling strings to make  others jump. And if he could trip Terry and actually make him shoot a man  on or before that birthday, he had no doubt that his sister would  actually throw the boy out of her house and out of her life. A woman who  could give twenty-four years to a theory would be capable of grim things  when the theory went wrong.    It was early evening when he climbed off the train at Garrison City. He  had not visited the place since that cattle-buying trip of twenty-four  years ago that brought the son of Black Jack into the affairs of the  Cornish family. Garrison City had become a city. There were two solid  blocks of brick buildings next to the station, a network of paved  streets, and no less than three hotels. It was so new to the eye and so  obviously full of the \"booster\" spirit that he was appalled at the idea  of prying through this modern shell and getting back to the heart and the  memory of the old days of the town.    At the restaurant he forced himself upon a grave-looking gentleman across  the table. He found that the solemn-faced man was a travelling drummer.  The venerable loafer in front of the blacksmith's shop was feeble-minded,  and merely gaped at the name of Black Jack. The proprietor of the hotel  shook his head with positive antagonism.    \"Of course, Garrison City has its past,\" he admitted, \"but we are living  it down, and have succeeded pretty well. I think I've heard of a ruffian  of the last generation named Jack Hollis; but I don't know anything, and  I don't care to know anything, about him. But if you're interested in  Garrison City, I'd like to show you a little plot of ground in a place  that is going to be the center of the--\"    Vance Cornish made his mind a blank, let the smooth current of words slip  off his memory as from an oiled surface, and gave up Garrison City as a  hopeless job. Nevertheless, it was the hotel proprietor who dropped a  valuable hint.    \"If you're interested in the early legends, why don't you go to the State  Capitol? They have every magazine and every book that so much as mentions  any place in the state.\" So Vance Cornish went to the capitol and entered  the library. It was a sweaty task and a most discouraging one. The name  \"Black Jack\" revealed nothing; and the name of Hollis was an equal blank,  so far as the indices were concerned. He was preserved in legend only,  and Vance Cornish could make no vital use of legend. He wanted something  in cold print.    So he began an exhaustive search. He went through volume after volume,  but though he came upon mention of Black Jack, he never reached the  account of an eyewitness of any of those stirring holdups or train  robberies.    And then he began on the old files of magazines. And still nothing. He  was about to give up with four days of patient labor wasted when he  struck gold in the desert--the very mine of information which he wanted.    \"How I Painted Black Jack,\" by Lawrence Montgomery.    There was the photograph of the painter, to begin with--a man who had  discovered the beauty of the deserts of the Southwest. But there was  more--much more. It told how, in his wandering across the desert, he had  hunted for something more than raw-colored sands and purple mesas  blooming in the distance.    He had searched for a human being to fit into the picture and give the  softening touch of life. But he never found the face for which he had  been looking. And then luck came and tapped him on the shoulder. A lone  rider came out of the dusk and the desert and loomed beside his campfire.  The moment the firelight flushed on the face of the man, he knew this was  the face for which he had been searching. He told how they fried bacon  and ate it together; he told of the soft voice and the winning smile of  the rider; he told of his eyes, unspeakably soft and unspeakably bold,  and the agile, nervous hands, forever shifting and moving in the  firelight.    The next morning he had asked his visitor to sit for a picture, and his  request had been granted. All day he labored at the canvas, and by night  the work was far enough along for him to dismiss his visitor. So the  stranger asked for a small brush with black paint on it, and in the  corner of the canvas drew in the words \"Yours, Black Jack.\" Then he rode  into the night.    Black Jack! Lawrence Montgomery had made up his pack and struck straight  back for the nearest town. There he asked for tidings of a certain Black  Jack, and there he got what he wanted in heaps. Everyone knew Black  Jack--too well! There followed a brief summary of the history of the  desperado and his countless crimes, unspeakable tales of cunning and  courage and merciless vengeance taken.    Vance Cornish turned the last page of the article, and there was the  reproduction of the painting. He held his breath when he saw it. The  outlaw sat on his horse with his head raised and turned, and it was the  very replica of Terence Colby as the boy had waved to them from the back  of Le Sangre. More than a family, sketchy resemblance--far more.    There was the same large, dark eye; the same smile, half proud and half  joyous; the same imperious lift of the head; the same bold carving of the  features. There were differences, to be sure. The nose of Black Jack had  been more cruelly arched, for instance, and his cheekbones were higher  and more pronounced. But in spite of the dissimilarities the resemblance  was more than striking. It might have stood for an actual portrait of  Terence Colby masquerading in long hair.    When the full meaning of this photograph had sunk into his mind, Vance  Cornish closed his eyes. \"Eureka!\" he whispered to himself.    There was something more to be done. But it was very simple. It merely  consisted in covertly cutting out the pages of the article in question.  Then, carefully, for fear of loss, he jotted down the name and date of  the magazine, folded his stolen pages, and fitted them snugly into his  breast pocket. That night he ate his first hearty dinner in four days.        CHAPTER 5      Vance's work was not by any means accomplished. Rather, it might be said  that he was in the position of a man with a dangerous charge for a gun  and no weapon to shoot it. He started out to find the gun.    In fact, he already had it in mind. Twenty-four hours later he was in  Craterville. Five days out of the ten before the twenty-fifth birthday of  Terence had elapsed, and Vance was still far from his goal, but he felt  that the lion's share of the work had been accomplished.    Craterville was a day's ride across the mountains from the Cornish ranch,  and it was the county seat. It was one of those towns which spring into  existence for no reason that can be discovered, and cling to life  generations after they should have died. But Craterville held one thing  of which Vance Cornish was in great need, and that was Sheriff Joe  Minter, familiarly called Uncle Joe. His reason for wanting the sheriff  was perfectly simple. Uncle Joe Minter was the man who killed Black Jack  Hollis.    He had been a boy of eighteen then, shooting with a rifle across a window  sill. That shot had formed his life. He was now forty-two and he had  spent the interval as the professional enemy of criminals in the  mountains. For the glory which came from the killing of Black Jack had  been sweet to the youthful palate of Minter, and he had cultivated "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9932"],[0,"The Last Trail (#5)"],[1,"was to her a new and  novel character. She was amused at learning that here was a young man  absolutely indifferent to the charms of the opposite sex, and although  hardly admitting such a thing, she believed it would be possible to  win him from his indifference. On raising her eyelids, it was with the  unconcern which a woman feigns when suspecting she is being regarded  with admiring eyes. But Jonathan Zane might not have known of her  presence, for all the attention he paid her. Therefore, having a good  opportunity to gaze at this borderman of daring deeds, Helen regarded  him closely.    He was clad from head to foot in smooth, soft buckskin which fitted  well his powerful frame. Beaded moccasins, leggings bound high above  the knees, hunting coat laced and fringed, all had the neat, tidy  appearance due to good care. He wore no weapons. His hair fell in a  raven mass over his shoulders. His profile was regular, with a long,  straight nose, strong chin, and eyes black as night. They were now  fixed intently on the valley. The whole face gave an impression of  serenity, of calmness.    Helen was wondering if the sad, almost stern, tranquility of that face  ever changed, when the baby cooed and held out its chubby little  hands. Jonathan's smile, which came quickly, accompanied by a warm  light in the eyes, relieved Helen of an unaccountable repugnance she  had begun to feel toward the borderman. That smile, brief as a flash,  showed his gentle kindness and told that he was not a creature who had  set himself apart from human life and love.    As he took little Rebecca, one of his hands touched Helen's. If he had  taken heed of the contact, as any ordinary man might well have, she  would, perhaps, have thought nothing about it, but because he did not  appear to realize that her hand had been almost inclosed in his, she  could not help again feeling his singular personality. She saw that  this man had absolutely no thought of her. At the moment this did not  awaken resentment, for with all her fire and pride she was not vain;  but amusement gave place to a respect which came involuntarily.    Little Rebecca presently manifested the faithlessness peculiar to her  sex, and had no sooner been taken upon Jonathan's knee than she cried  out to go back to Helen.    \"Girls are uncommon coy critters,\" said he, with a grave smile in his  eyes. He handed back the child, and once more was absorbed in the  setting sun.    Helen looked down the valley to behold the most beautiful spectacle  she had ever seen. Between the hills far to the west, the sky flamed  with a red and gold light. The sun was poised above the river, and the  shimmering waters merged into a ruddy horizon. Long rays of crimson  fire crossed the smooth waters. A few purple clouds above caught the  refulgence, until aided by the delicate rose and blue space beyond,  they became many hued ships sailing on a rainbow sea. Each second saw  a gorgeous transformation. Slowly the sun dipped into the golden  flood; one by one the clouds changed from crimson to gold, from gold  to rose, and then to gray; slowly all the tints faded until, as the  sun slipped out of sight, the brilliance gave way to the soft  afterglow of warm lights. These in turn slowly toned down into  gray twilight.    Helen retired to her room soon afterward, and, being unusually  thoughtful, sat down by the window. She reviewed the events of this  first day of her new life on the border. Her impressions had been so  many, so varied, that she wanted to distinguish them. First she felt  glad, with a sweet, warm thankfulness, that her father seemed so  happy, so encouraged by the outlook. Breaking old ties had been, she  knew, no child's play for him. She realized also that it had been done  solely because there had been nothing left to offer her in the old  home, and in a new one were hope and possibilities. Then she was  relieved at getting away from the attentions of a man whose  persistence had been most annoying to her. From thoughts of her  father, and the old life, she came to her new friends of the present.  She was so grateful for their kindness. She certainly would do all in  her power to win and keep their esteem.    Somewhat of a surprise was it to her, that she reserved for Jonathan  Zane the last and most prominent place in her meditations. She  suddenly asked herself how she regarded this fighting borderman. She  recalled her unbounded enthusiasm for the man as Colonel Zane had told  of him; then her first glimpse, and her surprise and admiration at the  lithe-limbed young giant; then incredulity, amusement, and respect  followed in swift order, after which an unaccountable coldness that  was almost resentment. Helen was forced to admit that she did not know  how to regard him, but surely he was a man, throughout every inch of  his superb frame, and one who took life seriously, with neither  thought nor time for the opposite sex. And this last brought a blush  to her cheek, for she distinctly remembered she had expected, if not  admiration, more than passing notice from this hero of the border.    Presently she took a little mirror from a table near where she sat.  Holding it to catch the fast-fading light, she studied her face  seriously.    \"Helen Sheppard, I think on the occasion of your arrival in a new  country a little plain talk will be wholesome. Somehow or other,  perhaps because of a crowd of idle men back there in the colonies,  possibly from your own misguided fancy, you imagined you were fair to  look at. It is well to be undeceived.\"    Scorn spoke in Helen's voice. She was angry because of having been  interested in a man, and allowed that interest to betray her into a  girlish expectation that he would treat her as all other men had. The  mirror, even in the dim light, spoke more truly than she, for it  caught the golden tints of her luxuriant hair, the thousand beautiful  shadows in her great, dark eyes, the white glory of a face fair as a  star, and the swelling outline of neck and shoulders.    With a sudden fiery impetuosity she flung the glass to the floor,  where it was broken into several pieces.    \"How foolish of me! What a temper I have!\" she exclaimed repentantly.  \"I'm glad I have another glass. Wouldn't Mr. Jonathan Zane, borderman,  Indian fighter, hero of a hundred battles and never a sweetheart, be  flattered? No, most decidedly he wouldn't. He never looked at me. I  don't think I expected that; I'm sure I didn't want it; but still he  might have--Oh! what am I thinking, and he a stranger?\"    Before Helen lost herself in slumber on that eventful evening, she  vowed to ignore the borderman; assured herself that she did not want  to see him again, and, rather inconsistently, that she would cure him  of his indifference.           *       *       *       *       *    When Colonel Zane's guests had retired, and the villagers were gone to  their homes, he was free to consult with Jonathan.    \"Well, Jack,\" he said, \"I'm ready to hear about the horse thieves.\"    \"Wetzel makes it out the man who's runnin' this hoss-stealin' is  located right here in Fort Henry,\" answered the borderman.    The colonel had lived too long on the frontier to show surprise; he  hummed a tune while the genial expression faded slowly from his face.    \"Last count there were one hundred and ten men at the fort,\" he  replied thoughtfully. \"I know over a hundred, and can trust them.  There are some new fellows on the boats, and several strangers hanging  round Metzar's.\"    \"'Pears to Lew an' me that this fellar is a slick customer, an' one  who's been here long enough to know our hosses an' where we  keep them.\"    \"I see. Like Miller, who fooled us all, even Betty, when he stole our  powder and then sold us to Girty,\" rejoined Colonel Zane grimly.    \"Exactly, only this fellar is slicker an' more desperate than Miller.\"    \"Right you are, Jack, for the man who is trusted and betrays us, must  be desperate. Does he realize what he'll get if we ever find out, or  is he underrating us?\"    \"He knows all right, an' is matchin' his cunnin' against our'n.\"    \"Tell me what you and Wetzel learned.\"    The borderman proceeded to relate the events that had occurred during  a recent tramp in the forest with Wetzel. While returning from a hunt  in a swamp several miles over the ridge, back of Fort Henry, they ran  across the trail of three Indians. They followed this until darkness  set in, when both laid down to rest and wait for the early dawn, that  time most propitious for taking the savage by surprise. On resuming  the trail they found that other Indians had joined the party they were  tracking. To the bordermen this was significant of some unusual  activity directed toward the settlement. Unable to learn anything  definite from the moccasin traces, they hurried up on the trail to  find that the Indians had halted.    Wetzel and Jonathan saw from their covert that the savages had a woman  prisoner. A singular feature about it all was that the Indians  remained in the same place all day, did not light a camp-fire, and  kept a sharp lookout. The bordermen crept up as close as safe, and  remained on watch during the day and night.    Early next morning, when the air was fading from black to gray, the  silence was broken by the snapping of twigs and a tremor of the  ground. The bordermen believed another company of Indians was  approaching; but they soon saw it was a single white man leading a  number of horses. He departed before daybreak. Wetzel and Jonathan  could not get a clear view of him owing to the dim light; but they  heard his voice, and afterwards found the imprint of his moccasins.  They did, however, recognize the six horses as belonging to settlers  in Yellow Creek.    While Jonathan and Wetzel were consulting as to what it was best to  do, the party of Indians divided, four going directly west, and the  others north. Wetzel immediately took the trail of the"]]]
