There was a pile of red flower-pots under the window and one very large  one was on the window-ledge. It seemed as if it was the hand of Destiny  had placed it there, and the geranium in it was dead, and there was  nothing to stop your standing on it--so Oswald did. He went first  because he is the eldest, and though Dicky tried to stop him because he  thought of it first it could not be, on account of not being able to say  anything.    So Oswald stood on the flower-pot and tried to look through one of the  holes. He did not really expect to see the coiners at their fell work,  though he had pretended to when we were talking in the tree. But if he  had seen them pouring the base molten metal into tin moulds the shape of  half-crowns he would not have been half so astonished as he was at the  spectacle now revealed.    At first he could see little, because the hole had unfortunately been  made a little too high, so that the eye of the detective could only see  the Prodigal Son in a shiny frame on the opposite wall. But Oswald held  on to the window-frame and stood on tiptoe and then he _saw_.    There was no furnace, and no base metal, no bearded men in leathern  aprons with tongs and things, but just a table with a table-cloth on it  for supper, and a tin of salmon and a lettuce and some bottled beer. And  there on a chair was the cloak and the hat of the mysterious stranger,  and the two people sitting at the table were the two youngest grown-up  daughters of the lady next door, and one of them was saying--    'So I got the salmon three-halfpence cheaper, and the lettuces are only  six a penny in the Broadway, just fancy! We must save as much as ever we  can on our housekeeping money if we want to go away decent next year.'    And the other said, 'I wish we could _all_ go _every_ year, or  else--Really, I almost wish--'    And all the time Oswald was looking Dicky was pulling at his jacket to  make him get down and let Dicky have a squint. And just as she said 'I  almost,' Dicky pulled too hard and Oswald felt himself toppling on the  giddy verge of the big flower-pots. Putting forth all his strength our  hero strove to recover his equi-what's-its-name, but it was now lost  beyond recall.    'You've done it this time!' he said, then he fell heavily among the  flower-pots piled below. He heard them crash and rattle and crack, and  then his head struck against an iron pillar used for holding up the  next-door veranda. His eyes closed and he knew no more.    Now you will perhaps expect that at this moment Alice would have cried  'Murder!' If you think so you little know what girls are. Directly she  was left alone in that tree she made a bolt to tell Albert's uncle all  about it and bring him to our rescue in case the coiner's gang was a  very desperate one. And just when I fell, Albert's uncle was getting  over the wall. Alice never screamed at all when Oswald fell, but Dicky  thinks he heard Albert's uncle say, 'Confound those kids!' which would  not have been kind or polite, so I hope he did not say it.    The people next door did not come out to see what the row was. Albert's  uncle did not wait for them to come out. He picked up Oswald and carried  the insensible body of the gallant young detective to the wall, laid it  on the top, and then climbed over and bore his lifeless burden into our  house and put it on the sofa in Father's study. Father was out, so  we needn't have _crept_ so when we were getting into the garden. Then  Oswald was restored to consciousness, and his head tied up, and sent  to bed, and next day there was a lump on his young brow as big as a  turkey's egg, and very uncomfortable.    Albert's uncle came in next day and talked to each of us separately.  To Oswald he said many unpleasant things about ungentlemanly to spy on  ladies, and about minding your own business; and when I began to tell  him what I had heard he told me to shut up, and altogether he made me  more uncomfortable than the bump did.    Oswald did not say anything to any one, but next day, as the shadows of  eve were falling, he crept away, and wrote on a piece of paper, 'I want  to speak to you,' and shoved it through the hole like a heart in the top  of the next-door shutters. And the youngest young lady put an eye to  the heart-shaped hole, and then opened the shutter and said 'Well?' very  crossly. Then Oswald said--    'I am very sorry, and I beg your pardon. We wanted to be detectives, and  we thought a gang of coiners infested your house, so we looked through  your window last night. I saw the lettuce, and I heard what you said  about the salmon being three-halfpence cheaper, and I know it is very  dishonourable to pry into other people's secrets, especially ladies',  and I never will again if you will forgive me this once.'    Then the lady frowned and then she laughed, and then she said--    'So it was you tumbling into the flower-pots last night? We thought it  was burglars. It frightened us horribly. Why, what a bump on your poor  head!'    And then she talked to me a bit, and presently she said she and her  sister had not wished people to know they were at home, because--And  then she stopped short and grew very red, and I said, 'I thought you  were all at Scarborough; your servant told Eliza so. Why didn't you want  people to know you were at home?'    The lady got redder still, and then she laughed and said--    'Never mind the reason why. I hope your head doesn't hurt much. Thank  you for your nice, manly little speech. _You've_ nothing to be ashamed  of, at any rate.' Then she kissed me, and I did not mind. And then she  said, 'Run away now, dear. I'm going to--I'm going to pull up the blinds  and open the shutters, and I want to do it at _once_, before it gets  dark, so that every one can see we're at home, and not at Scarborough.'        CHAPTER 4. GOOD HUNTING    When we had got that four shillings by digging for treasure we ought, by  rights, to have tried Dicky's idea of answering the advertisement about  ladies and gentlemen and spare time and two pounds a week, but there  were several things we rather wanted.    Dora wanted a new pair of scissors, and she said she was going to get  them with her eight-pence. But Alice said--    'You ought to get her those, Oswald, because you know you broke the  points off hers getting the marble out of the brass thimble.'    It was quite true, though I had almost forgotten it, but then it was H.  O. who jammed the marble into the thimble first of all. So I said--    'It's H. O.'s fault as much as mine, anyhow. Why shouldn't he pay?'    Oswald didn't so much mind paying for the beastly scissors, but he hates  injustice of every kind.    'He's such a little kid,' said Dicky, and of course H. O. said he wasn't  a little kid, and it very nearly came to being a row between them. But  Oswald knows when to be generous; so he said--    'Look here! I'll pay sixpence of the scissors, and H. O. shall pay the  rest, to teach him to be careful.'    H. O. agreed: he is not at all a mean kid, but I found out afterwards  that Alice paid his share out of her own money.    Then we wanted some new paints, and Noel wanted a pencil and a halfpenny  account-book to write poetry with, and it does seem hard never to have  any apples. So, somehow or other nearly all the money got spent, and we  agreed that we must let the advertisement run loose a little longer.    'I only hope,' Alice said, 'that they won't have got all the ladies and  gentlemen they want before we have got the money to write for the sample  and instructions.'    And I was a little afraid myself, because it seemed such a splendid  chance; but we looked in the paper every day, and the advertisement was  always there, so we thought it was all right.    Then we had the detective try-on--and it proved no go; and then, when  all the money was gone, except a halfpenny of mine and twopence of  Noel's and three-pence of Dicky's and a few pennies that the girls had  left, we held another council.    Dora was sewing the buttons on H. O.'s Sunday things. He got himself a  knife with his money, and he cut every single one of his best buttons  off. You've no idea how many buttons there are on a suit. Dora counted  them. There are twenty-four, counting the little ones on the sleeves  that don't undo.    Alice was trying to teach Pincher to beg; but he has too much sense  when he knows you've got nothing in your hands, and the rest of us were  roasting potatoes under the fire. We had made a fire on purpose,  though it was rather warm. They are very good if you cut away the burnt  parts--but you ought to wash them first, or you are a dirty boy.    'Well, what can we do?' said Dicky. 'You are so fond of saying \"Let's do  something!\" and never saying what.'    'We can't try the advertisement yet. Shall we try rescuing some one?'  said Oswald. It was his own idea, but he didn't insist on doing it,  though he is next to the eldest, for he knows it is bad manners to make  people do what you want, when they would rather not.    'What was Noel's plan?' Alice asked.    'A Princess or a poetry book,' said Noel sleepily. He was lying on his  back on the sofa, kicking his legs. 'Only I shall look for the Princess  all by myself. But I'll let you see her when we're married.'    'Have you got enough poetry to make a book?' Dicky asked that, and it  was rather sensible of him, because when Noel came to look there were  only seven of his poems that any of us could understand. There was the  'Wreck of the Malabar', and the poem he wrote when Eliza took us to hear  the Reviving Preacher, and everybody cried, and Father said it must have  been the Preacher's Eloquence. So Noel wrote:        O Eloquence and what art thou?      Ay what art thou? because we cried      And everybody cried inside      When they came out their eyes were red--      And it was your doing Father said.    But Noel told Alice he got the first line and a half"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7700"],[0,"Lysistrata (#5)"],[1,"ckle, and you didn't guess  The thirst for glory ardent in our blood.    MAGISTRATE    By Apollo, I know well the thirst that heats you--  Especially when a wine-skin's close.    MEN    You waste your breath, dear magistrate, I fear, in answering back.  What's the good of argument with such a rampageous pack?  Remember how they washed us down (these very clothes I wore)  With water that looked nasty and that smelt so even more.    WOMEN    What else to do, since you advanced too dangerously nigh.  If you should do the same again, I'll punch you in the eye.  Though I'm a stay-at-home and most a quiet life enjoy,  Polite to all and every (for I'm naturally coy),  Still if you wake a wasps' nest then of wasps you must beware.    MEN    How may this ferocity be tamed? It grows too great to bear.  Let us question them and find if they'll perchance declare  The reason why they strangely dare  To seize on Cranaos' citadel,  This eyrie inaccessible,  This shrine above the precipice,  The Acropolis.  Probe them and find what they mean with this idle talk; listen,  but watch they don't try to deceive.  You'd be neglecting your duty most certainly if now this mystery  unplumbed you leave.    MAGISTRATE    Women there! Tell what I ask you, directly....  Come, without rambling, I wish you to state  What's your rebellious intention in barring up thus on our noses  our own temple-gate.    LYSISTRATA    To take first the treasury out of your management, and so stop the war  through the absence of gold.    MAGISTRATE    Is gold then the cause of the war?    LYSISTRATA    Yes, gold caused it and miseries more, too many to be told.  'Twas for money, and money alone, that Pisander with all of the army of  mob-agitators.  Raised up revolutions. But, as for the future, it won't be worth while  to set up to be traitors.  Not an obol they'll get as their loot, not an obol! while we have the  treasure-chest in our command.    MAGISTRATE    What then is that you propose?    LYSISTRATA    Just this--merely to take the exchequer henceforth in hand.    MAGISTRATE    The exchequer!    LYSISTRATA    Yes, why not? Of our capabilities you have had various clear evidences.  Firstly remember we have always administered soundly the budget of all  home-expenses.    MAGISTRATE    But this matter's different.    LYSISTRATA    How is it different?    MAGISTRATE    Why, it deals chiefly with war-time supplies.    LYSISTRATA    But we abolish war straight by our policy.    MAGISTRATE    What will you do if emergencies arise?    LYSISTRATA    Face them our own way.    MAGISTRATE    What _you_ will?    LYSISTRATA    Yes _we_ will!    MAGISTRATE    Then there's no help for it; we're all destroyed.    LYSISTRATA    No, willy-nilly you must be safeguarded.    MAGISTRATE    What madness is this?    LYSISTRATA    Why, it seems you're annoyed.  It must be done, that's all.    MAGISTRATE    Such awful oppression never,  O never in the past yet I bore.    LYSISTRATA    You must be saved, sirrah--that's all there is to it.    MAGISTRATE    If we don't want to be saved?    LYSISTRATA    All the more.    MAGISTRATE    Why do you women come prying and meddling in matters of state touching  war-time and peace?    LYSISTRATA    That I will tell you.    MAGISTRATE    O tell me or quickly I'll--    LYSISTRATA    Hearken awhile and from threatening cease.    MAGISTRATE    I cannot, I cannot; it's growing too insolent.    WOMEN    Come on; you've far more than we have to dread.    MAGISTRATE    Stop from your croaking, old carrion-crow there....  Continue.    LYSISTRATA    Be calm then and I'll go ahead.  All the long years when the hopeless war dragged along we, unassuming,  forgotten in quiet,  Endured without question, endured in our loneliness all your incessant  child's antics and riot.  Our lips we kept tied, though aching with silence, though well all the  while in our silence we knew  How wretchedly everything still was progressing by listening dumbly the  day long to you.  For always at home you continued discussing the war and its politics  loudly, and we  Sometimes would ask you, our hearts deep with sorrowing though we spoke  lightly, though happy to see,  \"What's to be inscribed on the side of the Treaty-stone  What, dear, was said in the Assembly today?\"  \"Mind your own business,\" he'd answer me growlingly  \"hold your tongue, woman, or else go away.\"  And so I would hold it.    WOMEN    I'd not be silent for any man living on earth, no, not I!    MAGISTRATE    Not for a staff?    LYSISTRATA    Well, so I did nothing but sit in the house, feeling dreary, and sigh,  While ever arrived some fresh tale of decisions more foolish by far and  presaging disaster.  Then I would say to him, \"O my dear husband, why still do they rush on  destruction the faster?\"  At which he would look at me sideways, exclaiming, \"Keep for your web  and your shuttle your care,  Or for some hours hence your cheeks will be sore and hot; leave this  alone, war is Man's sole affair!\"    MAGISTRATE    By Zeus, but a man of fine sense, he.    LYSISTRATA    How sensible?  You dotard, because he at no time had lent  His intractable ears to absorb from our counsel one temperate word of  advice, kindly meant?  But when at the last in the streets we heard shouted (everywhere ringing  the ominous cry)  \"Is there no one to help us, no saviour in Athens?\" and, \"No, there is  no one,\" come back in reply.  At once a convention of all wives through Hellas here for a serious  purpose was held,  To determine how husbands might yet back to wisdom despite their  reluctance in time be compelled.  Why then delay any longer? It's settled. For the future you'll take  up our old occupation.  Now in turn you're to hold tongue, as we did, and listen while we show  the way to recover the nation.    MAGISTRATE    _You_ talk to _us!_ Why, you're mad. I'll not stand it.    LYSISTRATA    Cease babbling, you fool; till I end, hold your tongue.    MAGISTRATE    If I should take orders from one who wears veils, may my  neck straightaway be deservedly wrung.    LYSISTRATA    O if that keeps pestering you,  I've a veil here for your hair,  I'll fit you out in everything  As is only fair.    CALONICE    Here's a spindle that will do.    MYRRHINE    I'll add a wool-basket too.    LYSISTRATA    Girdled now sit humbly at home,  Munching beans, while you card wool and comb. For war from now on  is the Women's affair.    WOMEN.    Come then, down pitchers, all,  And on, courageous of heart,  In our comradely venture  Each taking her due part.    I could dance, dance, dance, and be fresher after,  I could dance away numberless suns,  To no weariness let my knees bend.  Earth I could brave with laughter,  Having such wonderful girls here to friend.  O the daring, the gracious, the beautiful ones!  Their courage unswerving and witty  Will rescue our city.    O sprung from the seed of most valiant-wombed grand-mothers,  scions of savage and dangerous nettles!  Prepare for the battle, all. Gird up your angers. Our way  the wind of sweet victory settles.    LYSISTRATA    O tender Eros and Lady of Cyprus, some flush of beauty I  pray you devise  To flash on our bosoms and, O Aphrodite, rosily gleam on  our valorous thighs!  Joy will raise up its head through the legions warring and  all of the far-serried ranks of mad-love  Bristle the earth to the pillared horizon, pointing in vain to  the heavens above.  I think that perhaps then they'll give us our title--  Peace-makers.    MAGISTRATE              What do you mean? Please explain.    LYSISTRATA      First, we'll not see you now flourishing arms about into the      Marketing-place clang again.    WOMEN    No, by the Paphian.    LYSISTRATA    Still I can conjure them as past were the herbs stand or crockery's sold  Like Corybants jingling (poor sots) fully armoured, they noisily round  on their promenade strolled.    MAGISTRATE    And rightly; that's discipline, they--    LYSISTRATA    But what's sillier than to go on an errand of buying a fish  Carrying along an immense. Gorgon-buckler instead the usual platter  or dish?  A phylarch I lately saw, mounted on horse-back, dressed for the part  with long ringlets and all,  Stow in his helmet the omelet bought steaming from an old woman who  kept a food-stall.  Nearby a soldier, a Thracian, was shaking wildly his spear like Tereus  in the play,  To frighten a fig-girl while unseen the ruffian filched from her  fruit-trays the ripest away.    MAGISTRATE    How, may I ask, will your rule re-establish order and justice in lands  so tormented?    LYSISTRATA    Nothing is easier.    MAGISTRATE    Out with it speedily--what is this plan that you boast you've invented?    LYSISTRATA    If, when yarn we are winding, It chances to tangle, then, as perchance you  may know, through the skein  This way and that still the spool we keep passing till it is finally clear  all again:  So to untangle the War and its errors, ambassadors out on all sides we will  send  This way and that, here, there and round about--soon you will find that the  War has an end.    MAGISTRATE    So with these trivial tricks of the household, domestic analogies of  threads, skeins and spools,  You think that you'll solve such a bitter complexity, unwind such political  problems, you fools!    LYSISTRATA    Well, first as we wash dirty wool so's to cleanse it, so with a pitiless  zeal we will scrub  Through the whole city for all greasy fellows; burrs too, the parasites,  off we will rub.  That verminous plague of insensate place-seekers soon between thumb and  forefinger we'll crack.  All who inside Athens' walls have their dwelling into one great common  basket we'll pack.  Disenfranchised or citizens, allies or aliens, pell-mell the lot of them  in we will squeeze.  Till they discover humanity's meaning.... As for disjointed and far  colonies,  Them you must never from this time imagine as scattered about just like  lost hanks of wool.  Each portion we'll take and wind in"]]]
