For many years, in short during  the greater part of nearly a quarter of a century of journalistic work,  he had celebrated in prose and verse, and always in his happiest and  most delightful vein, the pleasures of book-hunting.  Himself an  indefatigable collector of books, the possessor of a library as  valuable as it was interesting, a library containing volumes obtained  only at the cost of great personal sacrifice, he was in the most active  sympathy with the disease called bibliomania, and knew, as few  comparatively poor men have known, the half-pathetic, half-humorous  side of that incurable mental infirmity.    The newspaper column, to which he contributed almost daily for twelve  years, comprehended many sly digs and gentle scoffings at those of his  unhappy fellow citizens who became notorious, through his  instrumentality, in their devotion to old book-shelves and auction  sales.  And all the time none was more assiduous than this same  good-natured cynic in running down a musty prize, no matter what its  cost or what the attending difficulties.  \"I save others, myself I  cannot save,\" was his humorous cry.    In his published writings are many evidences of my brother's  appreciation of what he has somewhere characterized the \"soothing  affliction of bibliomania.\"  Nothing of book-hunting love has been more  happily expressed than \"The Bibliomaniac's Prayer,\" in which the  troubled petitioner fervently asserts:        \"But if, O Lord, it pleaseth Thee      To keep me in temptation's way,      I humbly ask that I may be      Most notably beset to-day;      Let my temptation be a book,      Which I shall purchase, hold and keep,      Whereon, when other men shall look,      They'll wail to know I got it cheap.\"    And again, in \"The Bibliomaniac's Bride,\" nothing breathes better the  spirit of the incurable patient than this:        \"Prose for me when I wished for prose,      Verse when to verse inclined,--      Forever bringing sweet repose      To body, heart and mind.      Oh, I should bind this priceless prize      In bindings full and fine,      And keep her where no human eyes      Should see her charms, but mine!\"    In \"Dear Old London\" the poet wailed that \"a splendid Horace cheap for  cash\" laughed at his poverty, and in \"Dibdin's Ghost\" he revelled in  the delights that await the bibliomaniac in the future state, where  there is no admission to the women folk who, \"wanting victuals, make a  fuss if we buy books instead\"; while in \"Flail, Trask and Bisland\" is  the very essence of bibliomania, the unquenchable thirst for  possession. And yet, despite these self-accusations, bibliophily rather  than bibliomania would be the word to characterize his conscientious  purpose.  If he purchased quaint and rare books it was to own them to  the  full extent, inwardly as well as outwardly.  The mania for books  kept him continually buying; the love of books supervened to make them  a part of himself and his life.    Toward the close of August of the present year my brother wrote the  first chapter of   \"The Love Affairs of a Bibliomaniac.\" At that time  he was in an exhausted physical condition and apparently unfit for any  protracted literary labor.  But the prospect of gratifying a  long-cherished ambition, the delight of beginning the story he had  planned so hopefully, seemed to give him new strength, and he threw  himself into the work with an enthusiasm that was, alas, misleading to  those who had noted fearfully his declining vigor of body.  For years  no literary occupation had seemed to give him equal pleasure, and in  the discussion of the progress of his writing from day to day his eye  would brighten, all of his old animation would return, and everything  would betray the lively interest he felt in the creature of his  imagination in whom he was living over the delights of the  book-hunter's chase.  It was his ardent wish that this work, for the  fulfilment of which he had been so long preparing, should be, as he  playfully expressed it, a monument of apologetic compensation to a  class of people he had so humorously maligned, and those who knew him  intimately will recognize in the shortcomings of the bibliomaniac the  humble confession of his own weaknesses.    It is easy to understand from the very nature of the undertaking that  it was practically limitless; that a bibliomaniac of so many years'  experience could prattle on indefinitely concerning his \"love affairs,\"  and at the same time be in no danger of repetition.  Indeed my  brother's plans at the outset were not definitely formed.  He would  say, when questioned or joked about these amours, that he was in the  easy position of Sam Weller when he indited his famous valentine, and  could \"pull up\" at any moment.  One week he would contend that a  book-hunter ought to be good for a year at least, and the next week he  would argue as strongly that it was time to send the old man into  winter quarters and go to press.  But though the approach of cold  weather  increased his physical indisposition, he was not the less  interested in his prescribed hours of labor, howbeit his weakness  warned him that he should say to his book, as his much-loved Horace had  written:                      \"Fuge quo descendere gestis:              Non erit emisso reditis tibi.\"      Was it strange that his heart should relent, and that he should write  on, unwilling to give the word of dismissal to the book whose  preparation had been a work of such love and solace?    During the afternoon of Saturday, November 2, the nineteenth instalment  of \"The Love Affairs\" was written.  It was the conclusion of his  literary life.  The verses supposably contributed by Judge Methuen's  friend, with which the chapter ends, were the last words written by  Eugene Field.  He was at that time apparently quite as well as on any  day during the fall months, and neither he nor any member of his family  had the slightest premonition that death was hovering about the  household.  The next day, though still feeling indisposed, he was at  times up and about, always cheerful and full of that sweetness and  sunshine which, in his last years, seem now to have been the  preparation for the life beyond.  He spoke of the chapter he had  written the day before, and it was then that he outlined his plan of  completing the work.  One chapter only remained to be written, and it  was to chronicle the death of the old bibliomaniac, but not until he  had unexpectedly fallen heir to a very rare and almost priceless copy  of Horace, which acquisition marked the pinnacle of the book-hunter's  conquest. True to his love for the Sabine singer, the western poet  characterized the immortal odes of twenty centuries gone the greatest  happiness of bibliomania.    In the early morning of November 4 the soul of Eugene Field passed  upward.  On the table, folded and sealed, were the memoirs of the old  man upon whom the sentence of death had been pronounced.  On the bed in  the corner of the room, with one arm thrown over his breast, and the  smile of peace and rest on his tranquil face, the poet lay.  All around  him, on the shelves  and in the cases, were the books he loved so well.  Ah, who shall say that on that morning his fancy was not verified, and  that as the gray light came reverently through the window, those  cherished volumes did not bestir themselves, awaiting the cheery voice:  \"Good day to you, my sweet friends.  How lovingly they beam upon me,  and how glad they are that my rest has been unbroken.\"    Could they beam upon you less lovingly, great heart, in the chamber  warmed by your affection and now sanctified by death? Were they less  glad to know that the repose would be unbroken forevermore, since it  came the glorious reward, my brother, of the friend who went gladly to  it through his faith, having striven for it through his works?

These boastings have always shocked me, for I  reverence love as the noblest of the passions, and it is impossible for  me to conceive how one who has truly fallen victim to its benign  influence can ever thereafter speak flippantly of it.    Yet there have been, and there still are, many who take a seeming  delight in telling you how many conquests they have made, and they not  infrequently have the bad taste to explain with wearisome prolixity the  ways and the means whereby those conquests were wrought; as, forsooth,  an unfeeling huntsman is forever boasting of the game he has  slaughtered and is forever dilating upon the repulsive details of his  butcheries.
