Frank Baum and his correspondents,\" for I have used many suggestions  conveyed to me in letters from children.  Once on a time I really  imagined myself \"an author of fairy tales,\" but now I am merely an  editor or private secretary for a host of youngsters whose ideas I am  requestsed to weave into the thread of my stories.    These ideas are often clever.  They are also logical and interesting.  So I have used them whenever I could find an opportunity, and it is but  just that I acknowledge my indebtedness to my little friends.    My, what imaginations these children have developed!  Sometimes I am  fairly astounded by their daring and genius.  There will be no lack of  fairy-tale authors in the future, I am sure.  My readers have told me  what to do with Dorothy, and Aunt Em and Uncle Henry, and I have obeyed  their mandates.  They have also given me a variety of subjects to write  about in the future: enough, in fact, to keep me busy for some time.  I  am very proud of this alliance.  Children love these stories because  children have helped to create them.  My readers know what they want  and realize that I try to please them.  The result is very satisfactory  to the publishers, to me, and (I am quite sure) to the children.    I hope, my dears, it will be a long time before we are obliged to  dissolve partnership.      L. FRANK BAUM.    Coronado, 1910        1.  How the Nome King Became Angry    The Nome King was in an angry mood, and at such times he was very  disagreeable.  Every one kept away from him, even his Chief Steward  Kaliko.    Therefore the King stormed and raved all by himself, walking up and  down in his jewel-studded cavern and getting angrier all the time.  Then he remembered that it was no fun being angry unless he had some  one to frighten and make miserable, and he rushed to his big gong and  made it clatter as loud as he could.    In came the Chief Steward, trying not to show the Nome King how  frightened he was.    \"Send the Chief Counselor here!\" shouted the angry monarch.    Kaliko ran out as fast as his spindle legs could carry his fat, round  body, and soon the Chief Counselor entered the cavern.  The King  scowled and said to him:    \"I'm in great trouble over the loss of my Magic Belt.  Every little  while I want to do something magical, and find I can't because the Belt  is gone.  That makes me angry, and when I'm angry I can't have a good  time.  Now, what do you advise?\"    \"Some people,\" said the Chief Counselor, \"enjoy getting angry.\"    \"But not all the time,\" declared the King.  \"To be angry once in a  while is really good fun, because it makes others so miserable.  But to  be angry morning, noon and night, as I am, grows monotonous and  prevents my gaining any other pleasure in life.  Now what do you  advise?\"    \"Why, if you are angry because you want to do magical things and can't,  and if you don't want to get angry at all, my advice is not to want to  do magical things.\"    Hearing this, the King glared at his Counselor with a furious  expression and tugged at his own long white whiskers until he pulled  them so hard that he yelled with pain.    \"You are a fool!\" he exclaimed.    \"I share that honor with your Majesty,\" said the Chief Counselor.    The King roared with rage and stamped his foot.    \"Ho, there, my guards!\" he cried.  \"Ho\" is a royal way of saying, \"Come  here.\"   So, when the guards had hoed, the King said to them:    \"Take this Chief Counselor and throw him away.\"    Then the guards took the Chief Counselor, and bound him with chains to  prevent his struggling, and threw him away.  And the King paced up and  down his cavern more angry than before.    Finally he rushed to his big gong and made it clatter like a fire  alarm.  Kaliko appeared again, trembling and white with fear.    \"Fetch my pipe!\" yelled the King.    \"Your pipe is already here, your Majesty,\" replied Kaliko.    \"Then get my tobacco!\" roared the King.    \"The tobacco is in your pipe, your Majesty,\" returned the Steward.    \"Then bring a live coal from the furnace!\" commanded the King.    \"The tobacco is lighted, and your Majesty is already smoking your  pipe,\" answered the Steward.    \"Why, so I am!\" said the King, who had forgotten this fact; \"but you  are very rude to remind me of it.\"    \"I am a lowborn, miserable villain,\" declared the Chief Steward, humbly.    The Nome King could think of nothing to say next, so he puffed away at  his pipe and paced up and down the room.  Finally, he remembered how  angry he was, and cried out:    \"What do you mean, Kaliko, by being so contented when your monarch is  unhappy?\"    \"What makes you unhappy?\" asked the Steward.    \"I've lost my Magic Belt.  A little girl named Dorothy, who was here  with Ozma of Oz, stole my Belt and carried it away with her,\" said the  King, grinding his teeth with rage.    \"She captured it in a fair fight,\" Kaliko ventured to say.    \"But I want it!  I must have it!  Half my power is gone with that  Belt!\" roared the King.    \"You will have to go to the Land of Oz to recover it, and your Majesty  can't get to the Land of Oz in any possible way,\" said the Steward,  yawning because he had been on duty ninety-six hours, and was sleepy.    \"Why not?\" asked the King.    \"Because there is a deadly desert all around that fairy country, which  no one is able to cross.  You know that fact as well as I do, your  Majesty.  Never mind the lost Belt.  You have plenty of power left, for  you rule this underground kingdom like a tyrant, and thousands of Nomes  obey your commands.  I advise you to drink a glass of melted silver, to  quiet your nerves, and then go to bed.\"    The King grabbed a big ruby and threw it at Kaliko's head.  The Steward  ducked to escape the heavy jewel, which crashed against the door just  over his left ear.    \"Get out of my sight!  Vanish!  Go away--and send General Blug here,\"  screamed the Nome King.    Kaliko hastily withdrew, and the Nome King stamped up and down until  the General of his armies appeared.    This Nome was known far and wide as a terrible fighter and a cruel,  desperate commander.  He had fifty thousand Nome soldiers, all well  drilled, who feared nothing but their stern master.  Yet General Blug  was a trifle uneasy when he arrived and saw how angry the Nome King was.    \"Ha!  So you're here!\" cried the King.    \"So I am,\" said the General.    \"March your army at once to the Land of Oz, capture and destroy the  Emerald City, and bring back to me my Magic Belt!\" roared the King.    \"You're crazy,\" calmly remarked the General.    \"What's that?  What's that?  What's that?\"  And the Nome King danced  around on his pointed toes, he was so enraged.    \"You don't know what you're talking about,\" continued the General,  seating himself upon a large cut diamond.  \"I advise you to stand in a  corner and count sixty before you speak again.  By that time you may be  more sensible.\"    The King looked around for something to throw at General Blug, but as  nothing was handy he began to consider that perhaps the man was right  and he had been talking foolishly.  So he merely threw himself into his  glittering throne and tipped his crown over his ear and curled his feet  up under him and glared wickedly at Blug.    \"In the first place,\" said the General, \"we cannot march across the  deadly desert to the Land of Oz.  And if we could, the Ruler of that  country, Princess Ozma, has certain fairy powers that would render my  army helpless.  Had you not lost your Magic Belt we might have some  chance of defeating Ozma; but the Belt is gone.\"    \"I want it!\" screamed the King.  \"I must have it.\"    \"Well, then, let us try in a sensible way to get it,\" replied the  General.  \"The Belt was captured by a little girl named Dorothy, who  lives in Kansas, in the United States of America.\"    \"But she left it in the Emerald City, with Ozma,\" declared the King.    \"How do you know that?\" asked the General.    \"One of my spies, who is a Blackbird, flew over the desert to the Land  of Oz, and saw the Magic Belt in Ozma's palace,\" replied the King with  a groan.    \"Now that gives me an idea,\" said General Blug, thoughtfully.  \"There  are two ways to get to the Land of Oz without traveling across the  sandy desert.\"    \"What are they?\" demanded the King, eagerly.    \"One way is OVER the desert, through the air; and the other way is  UNDER the desert, through the earth.\"    Hearing this the Nome King uttered a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5173"],[0,"The Religion of the Samurai (#1)"],[1,"eBook was produced by John B.

The Ekayana Doctrine that Teaches the Ultimate Reality        CHAPTER IV      RECONCILIATION OF THE TEMPORARY WITH THE REAL DOCTRINE            INTRODUCTION      Buddhism is geographically divided into two schools[FN#1]--the  Southern, the older and simpler, and the Northern, the later and more  developed faith.  The former, based mainly on the Pali texts[FN#2] is  known as Hinayana[FN#3] (small vehicle), or the inferior doctrine;  while the latter, based on the various Sanskrit texts,[4] is known as  Mahayana (large vehicle), or superior doctrine.  The chief tenets of  the Southern School are so well known to occidental scholars that  they almost always mean the Southern School by the word Buddhism.  But with regard to the Northern School very little is known to the  West, owing to the fact that most of its original texts were lost,  and that the teachings based on these texts are written in Chinese,  or Tibetan, or Japanese languages unfamiliar to non-Buddhist  investigators.      [FN#1]  The Southern School has its adherents in Ceylon, Burma, Siam,  Anan, etc.; while the Northern School is found in Nepal, China,  Japan, Tibet, etc.    [FN#2]  They chiefly consist of the Four Nikayas: (1) Digha Nikaya  (Dirghagamas, translated into Chinese by Buddhaya?as, A.D. 412-413);  (2) Majjhima Nikaya (Madhyamagamas, translated into Chinese by  Gautama Sanghadeva, A.D. 397-398); (3) Sanyutta Nikaya  (Samyuktagamas, translated into Chinese by Gunabhadra, of the earlier  Sung dynasty, A.D. 420 479); (4) Anguttara Nikaya (Ekottaragamas,  translated into Chinese by Dharmanandi, A.D. 384-385).  Out of these  Hinayana books, the English translation of twenty-three suttas by  Rhys Davids exist in 'Sacred Books of Buddhist,' vols. ii.-iii., and  of seven suttas by the same author in 'Sacred Books of the East,'  vol. xi.    [FN#3]  The Southern Buddhists never call their faith Hinayana, the  name being an invention of later Buddhists, who call their doctrine  Mahayana in contradistinction to the earlier form of Buddhism.  We  have to notice that the word Hinayana frequently occurs in Mahayana  books, while it does not in Hinayana books.    [FN#4]  A catalogue of the Buddhist Canon, K'-yuen-luh, gives the  titles of 897 Mahayana sutras, yet the most important books often  quoted by Northern Buddhist teachers amount to little more than  twenty.  There exist the English translation of Larger  Sukhavati-vyuha-sutra, Smaller Sukhavati-vyuha-sutra,  Vajracchedika-sutra, Larger Prajna-paramita-hradya-sutra, Smaller  Prajna-paramita-hrdaya-sutra, by Max M?ller, and  Amitayur-dhyana-sutra, by J. Takakusu, in 'Sacred Books of the East,'  vol. xlix.  An English translation of Saddharma-pundarika-sutra, by  Kern, is given in 'Sacred Books of the East,' Vol. xxi.  Compare  these books with 'Outlines of Mahayana Buddhism,' by D. Suzuki.      It is hardly justifiable to cover the whole system of Buddhism with a  single epithet[FN#5] 'pessimistic' or "]]]
